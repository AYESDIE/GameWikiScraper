Stonefalls has a detailed history of war and conflict, from the &lt;a href=\"Nede-Chimer%20War\"&gt;Nede-Chimer War&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;Second Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt;. One of their most well-known stories is the tale of the &lt;a href=\"Brothers%20of%20Strife\"&gt;Brothers of Strife&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;i warriors that sacrificed themselves to defeat the warmongering &lt;a href=\"Nedic\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; warriors.\nDescription.\nGeography.\n&lt;a href=\"Daen%20Seeth\"&gt;Daen Seeth&lt;/a&gt;.\nDaen Seeth is the eastern ashlands, with various ruins dating back to the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;i, from the crypts of &lt;a href=\"Othrenis\"&gt;Othrenis&lt;/a&gt; to the ruined battlefield of the &lt;a href=\"Starved%20Plain\"&gt;Starved Plain&lt;/a&gt;. The city-state of &lt;a href=\"Davon%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Davon's Watch&lt;/a&gt; is the capital of &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt; in Stonefalls, serving as a port city. Within the center of Daen Seeth is the volcano called &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Mountain\"&gt;Ash Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Foyada\"&gt;Foyada&lt;/a&gt;s flowing near the townships of &lt;a href=\"Senie\"&gt;Senie&lt;/a&gt; and the Zabamatian city of Ebonheart. Along the mountain is a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20ruin\"&gt;Daedric ruin&lt;/a&gt;, which contains the seal of &lt;a href=\"Balreth\"&gt;Balreth&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Brothers of Strife. The stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Arand\"&gt;Fort Arand&lt;/a&gt;, is situated on the outskirts of Ebonheart, being south of a large quarry containing &lt;a href=\"Emberflint%20Mine\"&gt;Emberflint Mine&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Varanis\"&gt;Varanis&lt;/a&gt;.\nVaranis is the western hills of Stonefalls, stretching from the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Tormented%20Spire\"&gt;Tormented Spire&lt;/a&gt;, the biggest landmark in Varanis. The city-state of &lt;a href=\"Kragenmoor\"&gt;Kragenmoor&lt;/a&gt; is situated in the center of Varanis, along the main road. West of the city is the &lt;a href=\"Iliath%20Temple\"&gt;Iliath Temple&lt;/a&gt;, which is the center of worship for the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; in Stonefalls. There are &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; temples throughout Varanis dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath%27s%20Tongue\"&gt;Sheogorath's Tongue&lt;/a&gt;. The cavern of &lt;a href=\"Fungal%20Grotto\"&gt;Fungal Grotto&lt;/a&gt; houses the &lt;a href=\"Murkwater%20Tribe\"&gt;Murkwater Tribe&lt;/a&gt;, a prominent &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt; tribe throughout Stonefalls, fighting against the local &lt;a href=\"Dreugh\"&gt;Dreugh&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Kagesh%20Tribe\"&gt;Kagesh Tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ashlander\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt;s live in the area, near the Iliath Temple.\n&lt;a href=\"Zabamat\"&gt;Zabamat&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe fertile lands of Zabamat are situated on the north coastal region of Stonefalls, with the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; in the eastern bay, on the &lt;a href=\"Thir%20River\"&gt;Thir River&lt;/a&gt; estuary. On the western border lies &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Virak\"&gt;Fort Virak&lt;/a&gt;, which is the border stronghold between Morrowind and &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Shadowsilk%20Tribe\"&gt;Shadowsilk Tribe&lt;/a&gt; is heavily prominent in Zabamat, raiding local farmlands along the Inner Sea. The fortress of &lt;a href=\"Heimlyn%20Keep\"&gt;Heimlyn Keep&lt;/a&gt; holds ancient relics dating back to the Chimer. It is under the occupation of &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;. West of Ebonheart is &lt;a href=\"Vivec%27s%20Antlers\"&gt;Vivec's Antlers&lt;/a&gt;, which is filled to the brim with land-coral, supposedly holding the &lt;a href=\"Coral%20Heart\"&gt;Coral Heart&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful artifact.\nFauna.\nNetches.\nThe Netch is found throughout the waterways of Morrowind, and especially along the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt;. They are large docile creatures with large tendrils and a blue glow. There are three variations of the Netch. The &lt;a href=\"Bull%20Netch\"&gt;Bull Netch&lt;/a&gt; is the alpha and the leader of the pack. When the time comes, the Bull Netch defends their family. Another is the &lt;a href=\"Betty%20Netch\"&gt;Betty Netch&lt;/a&gt;, which is not as large and is usually tending to their kin. Finally, there is the &lt;a href=\"Netch%20Calf\"&gt;Netch Calf&lt;/a&gt;, the young Netch. These Netch are completely harmless and can be gathered for their guts, which is used in fishing. Netches are hunted for the Leather and their Jelly. The Leather is used to make &lt;a href=\"Medium%20Armor\"&gt;Medium Armor&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;a href=\"Bonemold%20Armor\"&gt;Bonemold Armor&lt;/a&gt; or Hlaalu brand armor. The Jelly is used in paralysis poisons and magicka potions. Most Netches are found in bundles of three; some would even be alone in caves or alcoves. In Stonefalls, Netches are commonly found in regions such as Zabamat or Daen Seeth, rarely deep in the mainland in Varanis or Deep Daen Seeth.\nShalks.\n&lt;a href=\"Shalk\"&gt;Shalk&lt;/a&gt;s are large beetles with aggressive tendencies. These insects have an affinity with fire, being able to spew fire and living along &lt;a href=\"Foyada\"&gt;Foyada&lt;/a&gt;s and volcanoes. These creatures resemble the typical Beetle, albeit with a red and orange hue. In places such as Stonefalls or Deshaan, the Shalk are herded and prized for their meat and resin. Typically, the Shalk are found in groups of three, nestled along the lava beds in the twin spires. In other places throughout Morrowind, the Shalk are found in open Grazelands, like in &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. Pockets of Shalk can be found underground, typical where the lava flows more. These caves can be far from the volcanoes they usually inhabit. Many people also kill Shalk for their &lt;a href=\"Beetle%20Scuttle\"&gt;Beetle Scuttle&lt;/a&gt;, which can be used in potions of Protection, which allows the consumer to take less damage.\nGoblins.\n&lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s are common throughout Tamriel, though there are prevalent tribes in Stonefalls, specifically in the west. There are two major Goblin tribes, the &lt;a href=\"Shadowsilk%20Tribe\"&gt;Shadowsilk Tribe&lt;/a&gt; live in the region of Zabamat, on the road between Ebonheart and &lt;a href=\"Deshaan\"&gt;Deshaan&lt;/a&gt;. These Goblins utilize &lt;a href=\"Spider\"&gt;Spider&lt;/a&gt;s in their assaults on local farms. Considering their affiliate of Spiders and the occupation of the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Mephala%27s%20Nest\"&gt;Mephala's Nest&lt;/a&gt;, these Goblins may have a connection with &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Sin. Another tribe is the &lt;a href=\"Murkwater%20Tribe\"&gt;Murkwater Tribe&lt;/a&gt;, which hails from the region of Varanis, specifically deep within the &lt;a href=\"Fungal%20Grotto\"&gt;Fungal Grotto&lt;/a&gt;. These Goblins remain within the shadows and have constant feuds with the Dreughs of Stonefalls. Because of this, the Fungal Grotto is disputed territory. Because of a Temple of Mephala in Fungal Grotto, the Murkwater Tribe are terrified with delving deeper into the cave.\nAlit.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alit\"&gt;Alit&lt;/a&gt; is a rather common creature amidst the wastes of Morrowind and Stonefalls is no different. The Alit is a part of a family of creatures that share the same type of body. Among these creatures are the &lt;a href=\"Kagouti\"&gt;Kagouti&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Wormmouth\"&gt;Wormmouth&lt;/a&gt;. The Alit are large hulking reptiles that lack arms, which they compensate with powerful legs. These Alit have gruesome large teeth that can ravage through anything. These creatures have the ability to attack groups of other animals, having the ability to raid &lt;a href=\"Thunderbug\"&gt;Thunderbug&lt;/a&gt; nests. The Alit's leather is prized among the &lt;a href=\"Ashlander\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt;s yet the actual Alit meat is tough and gamey, even poisonous. Typical, the Alit can be found in groups of two or three, in hill areas, i.e. Daen Seeth or the Ebonheart area. These creatures are vicious and relentless. When one large one is taken out, the runts would attack all out.\nDreughs.\n&lt;a href=\"Dreugh\"&gt;Dreugh&lt;/a&gt;s are large crustacean creatures that are found throughout the North and central riverways of Tamriel. Dreughs are magnificent creatures with intriguing history surrounding them. Dreughs are taller than the ten major races of Tamriel and come in two variations. The &lt;a href=\"Land%20Dreugh\"&gt;Land Dreugh&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Dreugh\"&gt;Sea Dreugh&lt;/a&gt;, with the formal having crab-like features and the latter having octopus-like features. These creatures undergo a process called &lt;a href=\"Karvinasim\"&gt;Karvinasim&lt;/a&gt;, which has the Sea Dreugh emerge onto land, becoming Land Dreughs. The &lt;a href=\"Ruddy%20Man\"&gt;Ruddy Man&lt;/a&gt; is a legendary monster that had come face to face with &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; of the Tribunal, which ended with the creation of the &lt;a href=\"West%20Gash\"&gt;West Gash&lt;/a&gt;. According to legend, the Dreughs were the superior race of the previous &lt;a href=\"Kalpa\"&gt;Kalpa&lt;/a&gt;, an Epoch of Time.\nFlora.\nThe region of Stonefalls is mostly volcanic, though, areas away from the twin spires are abundant in &lt;a href=\"flora\"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt;. The most notable area in this regard is the &lt;a href=\"Fungal%20Grotto\"&gt;Fungal Grotto&lt;/a&gt;, which is filled with the large mushrooms and colorful trees of Stonefalls. Deep into the cavern is a huge grove with waterways and ancient Daedric ruins. The creatures primarily inhabiting it are Dreughs and the Murkwater Goblins. The city-state of Ebonheart holds significant plants within its grasp. The Argonian district has a &lt;a href=\"Hist%20Tree\"&gt;Hist Tree&lt;/a&gt; in the center of the area. This district has various plants including &lt;a href=\"Ashreed\"&gt;Ashreed&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Spiky%20Grass\"&gt;Spiky Grass&lt;/a&gt;. Along the outskirts of Ebonheart are shrines of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this, the area is known to have patches of &lt;a href=\"Roland%27s%20Tears\"&gt;Roland's Tears&lt;/a&gt;, a sacred variation of the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Kanet\"&gt;Gold Kanet&lt;/a&gt; that is used in prayers of the Tribunal. Other than that, in Eastern Stonefalls, specifically around &lt;a href=\"Davon%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Davon's Watch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bal%20Foyen\"&gt;Bal Foyen&lt;/a&gt;, there are various spiraling trees with a wide variety of colors, including pink, purple, and orange. Not only that but the grass is more fertile, typically for the Grazelands of Morrowind. The &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Parasol\"&gt;Emperor Parasol&lt;/a&gt; is very common throughout Stonefalls, as it is throughout the province.\nGovernment.\nThe province of Morrowind is ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt;, legendary and ancient Dunmeri clans whose spheres of influence revolve around the different aspects of civilization. These Houses govern portions of Morrowind, from the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Padomaic%20Ocean\"&gt;Padomaic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. In Stonefalls, it is ruled by the Houses of &lt;a href=\"Hlaalu\"&gt;Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Indoril\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, with more a presence of the former, though it would not come until later. The city-state of Davon's Watch is under the control of House Indoril, whose sphere of influence is centered around religion, and their undevoted worship of the Tribunal. Their capital is the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;. House Indoril is very orthodox and conservative in their own respect. They do not inherently hate Outlander, but they have upheld ancient Dark Elven traditions and keep a sharp and vigilant look on them.\nHouse Hlaalu has traditionally been located in the west-central lands, with their capital being the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Narsis\"&gt;Narsis&lt;/a&gt;. Their sphere of influence revolves around the economy and trade. From a book called &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Grasping%20Fortune\"&gt;Book of Grasping Fortune&lt;/a&gt;, the Hlaalu follow the saying, \"Seize every chance to make a profit, but remember that your reputation also has value.\" Because of this mentality, the House Hlaalu have an open relationship with the Empires of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, taking in their culture and lifestyle, as opposed to the rest of Morrowind. The city-states of Ebonheart and Kragenmoor are colloquially known to be Hlaalu territory but sometime in the Second Era, these areas were occupied by &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt;. House Dres typically holds the southeastern marshlands, and even parts of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Their sphere of influence is agriculture and the working citizen. Their plantations are vast, growing the crop seen throughout Morrowind. The Dres have often used slaves, primarily &lt;a href=\"beastfolk\"&gt;beastfolk&lt;/a&gt; like the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;. Their capital is the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Tear\"&gt;Tear&lt;/a&gt;.\nHouse Hlaalu has had various notable figures become leaders of Morrowind, specifically in the Third Era. These leaders include &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Athyn%20Llethan\"&gt;Athyn Llethan&lt;/a&gt;, what these elves have in common is their lineage. The Great &lt;a href=\"House%20Ra%27athim\"&gt;House Ra'athim&lt;/a&gt; has ruled over the Kingdom of Ebonheart for generations, with family welded into legend. The Ra'athim are known for being miners of Mithril and Gold, eventually taking control of Ebonheart. Of these people, &lt;a href=\"Katariah%20Septim\"&gt;Katariah Septim&lt;/a&gt; is the most notable, having been the Duchess of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; and later the wife of &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pelagius Septim III&lt;/a&gt;. People have considered Katariah's reign as the golden years of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;, but she eventually moved on and gave the throne to &lt;a href=\"Cassynder%20Septim\"&gt;Cassynder Septim&lt;/a&gt;. Another Ra'athim was &lt;a href=\"Moraelyn\"&gt;Moraelyn&lt;/a&gt;, the youngest of three children, and a legendary explorer. Moraelyn's tales spread across the continent, as those his travels. Moraelyn and his family had fought against the Nords that had conquered the province in the first era. House Ra'athim was eventually absorbed in &lt;a href=\"House%20Mora\"&gt;House Mora&lt;/a&gt;, which would be brought into House Hlaalu.\nReligion.\nThe Chimeri of old had worshipped the Good &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, which consisted of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;. These Daedra have been involved with the history and overall way of life in Morrowind, including the founding of Resdayn and the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;Nerevarine Prophecy&lt;/a&gt;. But as time went on, the Dark Elves adopted a new Tribunal of deities, which was called the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;. The Tribunal consists of three living gods, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, the Mother God of Morrowind, who represents compassion and sympathy. Her domain is the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28City%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, colloquially known as Mournhold. &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, the Tinkerer, who represents the scholar and engineer. His domain is the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt;, a realm hidden from the residents of Morrowind and ahead of its time, utilizing technology and automatons. Then there is &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, the Warrior-Poet, who represents the spirit and vigor of the Dunmeri people. His domain is &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, the floating capital of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec has a history in Stonefalls, having the land-coral battlefield of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%27s%20Antlers\"&gt;Vivec's Antlers&lt;/a&gt; named after him and garnering inspiration from Ebonheart. But worship for the Tribunal fell with the passing of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Nerevarine Prophecy was a prophecy that foretold the fall of the Tribunal, which eventually came in &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, with the death of both &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; and Almalexia at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;. A demented Almalexia killed Sotha Sil, and Vivec fell into obscurity. Because of Vivec's waning powers, the &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt; fell and crashed into Vivec City, starting the Red Year. The Red Year was the last straw for Morrowind, and change was in the wind. The &lt;a href=\"Dissident%20Priests\"&gt;Dissident Priests&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Holamayan\"&gt;Holamayan&lt;/a&gt; arrived before the Tribunal Temple, rising into the Temple hierarchy and establishing the &lt;a href=\"New%20Temple\"&gt;New Temple&lt;/a&gt;. The New Temple revolves around the Good Daedra, the original Tribunal of Morrowind. The &lt;a href=\"Ashlander\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt;s that were exiled from Dunmeri society were brought back in with the foundation of the New Temple. House Indoril, in particular, was affected, since they revered the False Tribunal. The power in House Indoril was shifted to the Tribunal Temple, making them one of the same entity. Davon's Watch was likely affected by this change. But before that, Stonefalls has had temples dedicated to the Good Daedra. The temple of &lt;a href=\"Stonefang%20Isle\"&gt;Stonefang Isle&lt;/a&gt; had revered the Good Daedra. The old temple around Ash Mountain had worshipped Boethiah. Western Stonefalls had a massive influence of Mephala, where the &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Cult\"&gt;Spider Cult&lt;/a&gt; had built a temple deep in Fungal Grotto.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Prophet Veloth &amp; his journey to Resdayn.\nDuring the Merethic Era, the elven population of Tamriel lived in the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, when it was only the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;. One of these Chimer was &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;, an elf born of nobility. Veloth observed the world around him and was disgusted, seeing the blatant corruption and spiritual bankruptcy in the world. One day, he was visited by &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Plots, who told him that even mortals could ascend to godhood. When he told his peers, he was rejected and exiled. Throughout his time, he gathered followers who felt the power in his words, and so he traveled off the Isles and the promised land guided by Boethiah, called &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;. The Chimer had founded modern-day Morrowind, establishing temples all across the land, including in modern-day Stonefalls. On &lt;a href=\"Stonefang%20Isle\"&gt;Stonefang Isle&lt;/a&gt;, an old temple was erected, dedicated to the Good Daedra, which consists of Boethiah, &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;. Southwest of Davon's Watch is the ancient necropolis called &lt;a href=\"Othrenis\"&gt;Othrenis&lt;/a&gt;, which houses the remains of several Chimer including &lt;a href=\"Mavos%20Siloreth\"&gt;Mavos Siloreth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Brothers of Strife &amp; the Nede-Chimer War.\nThe Chimer-folk were not the only people living in Morrowind or Stonefalls, the &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; live throughout &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, establishing city-states such as &lt;a href=\"Nchuleft\"&gt;Nchuleft&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Morrowind%20Location%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;. Another race called the &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nede&lt;/a&gt;s have lived throughout Northern Tamriel, including Morrowind, albeit a minority. The Nedes of Stonefalls were utmost savages, desiring conquest and spoils. The Chimer of Stonefalls were blocking their path, and so the Nedes attacked them. The Elves sought diplomatic resolve, but the Nedes denied it, waging war in the &lt;a href=\"Nede-Chimer%20War\"&gt;Nede-Chimer War&lt;/a&gt;, where no one was spared their wrath, including women and children. Leading the Chimeri forces were brothers, &lt;a href=\"General%20Balreth\"&gt;General Balreth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Sadal\"&gt;Legate Sadal&lt;/a&gt;, both well-renowned to the Chimer. Their actions were solely defensive, protecting as much Chimeri innocence as possible. Eventually, the war was in the Nedic favor, separating the Chimer's connection to the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt;, forcing them into undisclosed ruins south of modern-day &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;. The Chimer took serious measures by having Balreth, and Sadal turns into twin hulking &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Colossus\"&gt;Bone Colossus&lt;/a&gt;, which wiped out the Nedic Horde and the Chimer Forces. The Brothers of Strife spared nobody. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Mavos%20Siloreth\"&gt;Mavos Siloreth&lt;/a&gt;, Balreth was sealed in &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Mountain\"&gt;Ash Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, while Sadal were sealed in the &lt;a href=\"Tormented%20Spire\"&gt;Tormented Spire&lt;/a&gt; by Chimeri Mages. A large statue was erected at the ruins, naming it the &lt;a href=\"Brothers%20of%20Strife\"&gt;Brothers of Strife&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nHouse Ra'athim &amp; the Nordic Occupation.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%20222\"&gt;1E 222&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vrage%20the%20Gifted\"&gt;Vrage the Gifted&lt;/a&gt; had assumed the throne of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; after the death of his brother, &lt;a href=\"Hjalmer\"&gt;Hjalmer&lt;/a&gt;. Not long after his assumption, Vrage had proclaimed the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Conquest\"&gt;Nordic Conquest&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Empire\"&gt;Nordic Empire&lt;/a&gt;'s conquest over northern Tamriel, taking hold of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; (as far as &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay Valley&lt;/a&gt;, and the province of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; (excluding &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;). At the time, the royal clan of &lt;a href=\"House%20Ra%27athim\"&gt;House Ra'athim&lt;/a&gt; had control over the city of &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;, the de-facto capital of the region of Stonefalls. When the Nordic Occupation moved into Stonefalls, House Ra'athim was cast out of Ebonheart. The Nords took both Ebonheart and &lt;a href=\"Kragenmoor\"&gt;Kragenmoor&lt;/a&gt;. Years later, &lt;a href=\"King%20Kronin\"&gt;King Kronin&lt;/a&gt;, and his three sons, Cruethys, &lt;a href=\"Moraelyn\"&gt;Moraelyn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"S%27ephen\"&gt;S'ephen&lt;/a&gt; led the charge against the Nords, utilizing guerrilla warfare in their efforts. Ultimately, the Nords were cast out of Stonefalls, with Cruethys assuming reign over Ebonheart, and &lt;a href=\"Yoriss\"&gt;Yoriss&lt;/a&gt;, Kronin's sister became the Queen of Kragenmoor. The conflict would be resolved in &lt;a href=\"1E%20416\"&gt;1E 416&lt;/a&gt;, when the combined forces of &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dumac%20Dwarfking\"&gt;Dumac Dwarfking&lt;/a&gt; defeated the Nords. With their defeat came the formation of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;First Council&lt;/a&gt;, an alliance between the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;. Ebonheart and Kragenmoor were most likely members of the First Council, as were the rest of Resdayn. As time went on, Cruethys' reign would be over and his brother, Moraelyn, a revered champion became the King of Ebonheart. His two grandsons would go on to rule joint kingdoms that became modern-day Ebonheart and &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Battle of Stonefalls &amp; the Ebonheart Pact.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20572\"&gt;2E 572&lt;/a&gt;, the continent of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; was invaded by the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Demons%20of%20Kamal\"&gt;Snow Demons of Kamal&lt;/a&gt;, under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Ada%27Soom%20Dir-Kamal\"&gt;Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal&lt;/a&gt;, whose invasion force had wreaked havoc across Northern Tamriel. The &lt;a href=\"Second%20Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;Second Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt; had attacked areas such as the &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Peninsula\"&gt;Telvanni Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; and eventually the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;. After brazing through the Nords in Skyrim, Dir-Kamal's army encountered the Dark Elves at the borders, near &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Virak\"&gt;Fort Virak&lt;/a&gt;. The Akaviri Army had pushed the Dark Elves to the central Stonefalls, where they staged a fighting retreat to eastern Stonefalls, it was under the command of both &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tanval%20Indoril\"&gt;Tanval Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, the latter being the Grandmaster of &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;. The Elves stopped their retreat, preparing for defense at &lt;a href=\"Vivec%27s%20Antlers\"&gt;Vivec's Antlers&lt;/a&gt;. The Elves were overwhelmed by the Kamali until the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; attacked from the west. Even then, it was not enough for the Akaviri, until the &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shellbacks\"&gt;Shellbacks&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Heita-Meen\"&gt;Heita-Meen&lt;/a&gt; attacked from the north, destroying the Akaviri in the process. In the end, the three armies emerged victoriously and formed the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, out of survival. The battle would known as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Stonefalls\"&gt;Battle of Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Stonefalls Campaign; Siege of Davon's Watch.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; under the command of &lt;a href=\"General%20Serien\"&gt;General Serien&lt;/a&gt; had invaded Pact Territory in Morrowind, from &lt;a href=\"Bleakrock%20Isle\"&gt;Bleakrock Isle&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Bal%20Foyen\"&gt;Bal Foyen&lt;/a&gt;. After the attack on Bal Foyen, the Ebonheart Pact had sounded an alarm for the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Davon%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Davon's Watch&lt;/a&gt;, prompting the city to prepare for battle. &lt;a href=\"Holgunn%20One-Eye\"&gt;Holgunn One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; led the defense against the Covenant along with Tanval Indoril, the Grandmaster of House Indoril. The Covenant barrage was relentless, forcing Tanval to take extra measures. He uses the help of an &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; of the Pact to retrieve the skull of &lt;a href=\"Nam%20Indoril\"&gt;Nam Indoril&lt;/a&gt; so that Tanval can summon &lt;a href=\"Balreth\"&gt;Balreth&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Brothers of Strife. As Tanval prepares the summoning ritual, the Agent traveled to the beachfront, burning Covenant siege weapons. Eventually, Tanval finished, and Balreth wrecked havoc on the Covenant Armada. Davon's Watch was saved from Balreth roamed Stonefalls, destroying the township of &lt;a href=\"Senie\"&gt;Senie&lt;/a&gt; in the process. The Pact sought a way to quell Balreth before he continues his wrath.\nJourney to Othrenis &amp; Suppressing Balreth at Ash Mountain.\nAn Argonian soldier named &lt;a href=\"Onuja\"&gt;Onuja&lt;/a&gt; believed that the Chimeri necropolis, &lt;a href=\"Othrenis\"&gt;Othrenis&lt;/a&gt; held the key to rebind Balreth and utilizing the help of the Agent. Through various chants, the two were able to arrive the tomb of &lt;a href=\"Mavos%20Siloreth\"&gt;Mavos Siloreth&lt;/a&gt;, where the Agent relived the memories of Mavos when he sealed Balreth and Sadal. With these memories, the Pact was able to gain the knowledge of sealing the Brothers of Strife. The Pact, under the command of &lt;a href=\"Garyn%20Indoril\"&gt;Garyn Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, have positioned themselves at the base of &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Mountain\"&gt;Ash Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, as they prepare to seal away Balreth in his original home. The Agent was once again tasked with leading the charge forward, defeating Daedra roaming the mountain. To seal Balreth, the Agent must summon &lt;a href=\"Ragebinder\"&gt;Ragebinder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blaze%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Blaze&lt;/a&gt; have them become the protectors of Balreth once again. Eventually, the Agent garnered the necessary things to seal Balreth properly. With the power of the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Talisman\"&gt;Storm Talisman&lt;/a&gt;, Ragebinder and Blaze were able to bind Balreth as Mavos Siloreth trapped him in Ash Mountain. Stonefalls was saved from a greater threat but the Daggerfall Covenant still roams the land, being seen near &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;, where a traitor was revealed.\nThe Stonefalls Campaign; Battle of Vivec's Antlers.\nWith Balreth out of the picture, the Ebonheart Pact battle with the Daggerfall Covenant, where it led to a full-scale battle at &lt;a href=\"Vivec%27s%20Antlers\"&gt;Vivec's Antlers&lt;/a&gt;, a land riddled with land-coral. At that point, &lt;a href=\"General%20Serien\"&gt;General Serien&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the offensive campaign had marched onto the mainland towards &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Virak\"&gt;Fort Virak&lt;/a&gt;, while his troops harassed the locals from &lt;a href=\"Heimlyn%20Keep\"&gt;Heimlyn Keep&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Lukiul%20Uxith\"&gt;Lukiul Uxith&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Alexandra%20Conele\"&gt;Alexandra Conele&lt;/a&gt; leads the Covenant Armada that was stationed at Vivec's Antlers. She intended to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Coral%20Heart\"&gt;Coral Heart&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful artifact that can be used to control &lt;a href=\"Sadal\"&gt;Sadal&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Brothers of Strife. The Pact and the Covenant fought relentlessly, agitating the local &lt;a href=\"Dreugh\"&gt;Dreugh&lt;/a&gt; that inhabit the area. The Dreughs captured many soldiers. Conele captured &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Galyn\"&gt;Lieutenant Galyn&lt;/a&gt; to garnered an entrance into the Inner Sanctum, and was able to get what she needed; she advanced. The Agent of the Pact and an Argonian pyromancer, &lt;a href=\"Sings-With-Reed\"&gt;Sings-With-Reed&lt;/a&gt; travel forth to the Coral Heart Chamber, where they encountered Alexandra. In the end, Conele was defeated, but the Coral Heart was taken out and need to be healed. Sings-With-Reed sacrifices herself and becomes one with the Heart. With Covenant defeated, Holgunn One-Eye takes hold of the Heart, as the Pact continues west towards Fort Virak, where General Serien was held up at.\nThe Stonefalls Campaign; Battle of Fort Virak.\nGaryn Indoril is leading the charge against Fort Virak, as General Serien begins to utilize the dead soldiers on both sides as a reusable militia. The Pact Siege is making no progress, considering the nigh-impenetrable walls of Virak. With no other way to defeat the Covenant, the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; of the Pact consumed an elixir that turned them into a &lt;a href=\"Wisp\"&gt;Wisp&lt;/a&gt;, since the Agent lacked a soul it made them more malleable than the regular soldier. The Agent was able to infiltrate Fort Virak and open the gates to let the Pact on both sides of Virak, to storm the Fort. Serien had taken wounded Pact soldiers, using them in necromantic rituals. With the courtyard secured, the Agent, Holgunn, and both Garyn and &lt;a href=\"Tanval%20Indoril\"&gt;Tanval Indoril&lt;/a&gt; confronted Serien. After defeating the General, he turns into a hulking &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Atronach\"&gt;Flesh Atronach&lt;/a&gt;, though he is still defeated, ending the Covenant's campaign over Stonefalls. As his spirit leaves his body, Serien kills Garyn Indoril, mortifying his father, Tanval. Enraged, Tanval steals the Coral Heart from Holgunn and travels to the &lt;a href=\"Tormented%20Spire\"&gt;Tormented Spire&lt;/a&gt;, to summon Sadal and destroy the Daggerfall Covenant. Before he can revive the beast, he must gain access from the leader of &lt;a href=\"Kragenmoor\"&gt;Kragenmoor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Vanguard's Plot on Kragenmoor.\nThe path to the Tormented Spire is inaccessible, only given to the leader of Kragenmoor. At the time, the Dark Elves of &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt; controlled over Kragenmoor and their Grandmaster, &lt;a href=\"Omin%20Dres\"&gt;Omin Dres&lt;/a&gt; resided in the city at this time. Tanval's Vanguard took control over Kragenmoor when they kidnapped Omin's son, &lt;a href=\"Sen%20Dres\"&gt;Sen Dres&lt;/a&gt;, taking him to the nearby &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres%20Crypts\"&gt;House Dres Crypts&lt;/a&gt;, knowing that the people wouldn't dare to disturb the ancestral tomb. Knowing that Omin Dres had the key, Tanval had his vanguard kidnap Sen, giving the Grandmaster an ultimatum. Even when Omin gave Tanval what he needed, Sen remained imprisoned in the Crypt. The Pact would step in and by order of Grandmaster Dres, the Agent of the Pact traversed the Dres Crypt and rescued Sen Dres. With the situation dealt with, Omin Dres gave the Pact the entrance to the Tormented Spire, following Tanval Indoril to the prison of Sadal.\nTanval's Endeavor &amp; Suppressing Sadal at the Tormented Spire.\nAs Tanval Indoril traversed the Tormented Spire, he was killed when he had brought back Sadal. The Pact and Tanval's spirit sought a way to re-seal Sadal into the Tormented Spire. The Ancient Chimeri spirits that imprisoned the Brother of Strife had awakened, defending the prison so that no one brings Sadal back. The Agent of the Pact traveled throughout the caldera of the volcano, seeking the approval of entering the prison, by the Chimer spirits that sealed Sadal. Eventually, the Pact and their strongest fighters entered Sadal's Prison, where they fought the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Colossus\"&gt;Bone Colossus&lt;/a&gt;, sealing it into the volcano forever. With both the Covenant and Sadal put to rest, the Stonefalls region was saved, though a new threat would arise from the region of &lt;a href=\"Deshaan\"&gt;Deshaan&lt;/a&gt;.\nConquest over Morrowind &amp; the Talosian Empire.\nAs time went on, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; that had plagued the provinces of Tamriel had faded into obscurity. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20854\"&gt;2E 854&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; had elevated himself to the throne of Emperor and began an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;Tiber Wars&lt;/a&gt;, which absorbed the provinces of Tamriel into his own Empire. After successfully bringing in the province of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, Septim was pressured by his companion, &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; to invade Morrowind. And so, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; advanced across the eastern borders, attacking the province of Morrowind. Leading the defense were three of the five major houses, &lt;a href=\"Redoran\"&gt;Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dres\"&gt;Dres&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Indoril\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt;. The battle for Morrowind took place along the western border, near places such as &lt;a href=\"Kragenmoor\"&gt;Kragenmoor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt;, towards townships like &lt;a href=\"Silgrad%20Tower\"&gt;Silgrad Tower&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cormaris%20View\"&gt;Cormaris View&lt;/a&gt;. Though things would change when the warriors of Indoril and Dres would rather withdraw and fight through guerrilla warfare, instead of defending the border like the Redoran-folk. Eventually, only the Elves of House Redoran were fighting the Empire. Fortunately, the tides would shift when &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; himself, appeared before his people in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, proclaiming that a peace treaty was in the works. In the end, the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20the%20Armistice\"&gt;Treaty of the Armistice&lt;/a&gt; was signed by the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Morrowind was an official Imperial Province.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nKatariah Ra'athim &amp; her Rise as Regent Empress.\nThe city-state of Ebonheart under House Ra'athim were allies of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Solitude\"&gt;Kingdom of Solitude&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;, and this was not a well-kept secret. Once &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema Septim&lt;/a&gt; was defeated, her nephew, &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pelagius Septim III&lt;/a&gt; assumed the throne of Solitude and would eventually inherit the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt; should his father, &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Septim\"&gt;Magnus Septim&lt;/a&gt; pass away. During his reign, Pelagius III committed various questionable acts such as stripping naked during public speeches and locking the princes of &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28City%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt; in rooms, slipping declarations of war through the door. By order of Magnus Septim, Pelagius the Mad was married to &lt;a href=\"Katariah%20Ra%27athim\"&gt;Katariah Ra'athim&lt;/a&gt;, the Duchess of Ebonheart. Very few Nordic Kings marry Dark Elves and garner popularity, but with Ebonheart's history with Potema and Katariah's natural talent in politics, she was the perfect candidate for someone like Pelagius III. On the 8th of &lt;a href=\"Second%20Seed\"&gt;Second Seed&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20145\"&gt;3E 145&lt;/a&gt;, Emperor Magnus Septim had passed, and both Pelagius III and Katariah Septim assumed the Ruby Throne. But while Pelagius descended into unfathomable madness, Katariah and the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; essentially took over. The forty-six years of her reign were the most celebrated throughout Tamriel. When Pelagius the Mad would bite people visiting him, he was sent to a private asylum. Eventually, Pelagius Septim III passed away in the Isle of &lt;a href=\"Betony\"&gt;Betony&lt;/a&gt;. Katariah had only one child with Pelagius III named &lt;a href=\"Cassynder%20Septim\"&gt;Cassynder Septim&lt;/a&gt;. Though she would have a second child with her consort, &lt;a href=\"Gallivere%20Lariat\"&gt;Gallivere Lariat&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;. This child, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20IV\"&gt;Uriel Septim IV&lt;/a&gt; would become the first Emperor that is not a direct descendant of Tiber Septim. Katariah would pass away in a minor skirmish in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; but she left a legacy in Tamriel for Ebonheart and House Ra'athim.\nStonefalls during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the village of Stonefalls in their quest to recover the pieces.\nThe Eternal Champion reached the city of Ebonheart on their quest to find the seventh piece of the Staff. Through the visions of &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt; and rumors from the people, the Champion had traveled to the central ashlands, to the city of Ebonheart in the province of Morrowind. There the traveler ventured to the local seat of power where they met &lt;a href=\"King%20Casik\"&gt;King Casik&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of Ebonheart. Casik gives the Eternal Champion a proposition where if they retrieved the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Gharen\"&gt;Hammer of Gharen&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Black%20Gate\"&gt;Black Gate&lt;/a&gt;, then he would reveal the location of the piece. After bringing the hammer, Casik showed the way to &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Morrowind%20Location%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient stronghold deep within &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. It was there that the Eternal Champion had obtained the seventh piece of the staff. The Champion had all the necessary parts of the staff and so he traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; to defeat Jagar Tharn and end his tirade.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Fall of House Hlaalu &amp; Rise of House Sadras.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, Morrowind was in a state of despair unlike anytime before. The &lt;a href=\"Fall%20of%20Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Fall of Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt; was especially devastating when the folks of &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; were forced to resurrect &lt;a href=\"Skar\"&gt;Skar&lt;/a&gt;. When the province of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; was being invaded, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; from all over were forced to defend their homeland, and because of this, Morrowind suffered greatly. Because of &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;'s connection with the Empire, the Great House was the source of blame for Morrowind's fate, to the point, it was used as a scapegoat. By order of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Council\"&gt;Grand Council&lt;/a&gt; under House Redoran, House Hlaalu was demoted from their position as a Great House, much to the dismay of the Hlaalu-kin. They were replaced by &lt;a href=\"House%20Sadras\"&gt;House Sadras&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this, the Elves of House Hlaalu had held a grudge on House Redoran, holding it for a couple of hundred years. One of their well-known attacks was on the Redoran settlement of &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Vilur%20Ulen\"&gt;Vilur Ulen&lt;/a&gt; would make a failed assassination attempt on &lt;a href=\"Councilor%20Lleril%20Morvayn\"&gt;Councilor Lleril Morvayn&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, Ulen was captured and put on the execution block. Several years later around &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, Ulen's family migrated to &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; as members of &lt;a href=\"House%20Severin\"&gt;House Severin&lt;/a&gt;. Though their second attempt on Morvayn would fail, even with involvement with the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;.\nEven now, House Hlaalu is still referred to as a Great House, implying that their revoked status is not entirely lost. But even then, House Hlaalu has a presence outside of Morrowind, owning several farmsteads in the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Holds\"&gt;Old Holds&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim, specifically along the &lt;a href=\"Yorgrim%20River\"&gt;Yorgrim River&lt;/a&gt; in Skyrim, near the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;. During the early fourth era, the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt; was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Count%20Andel%20Indarys\"&gt;Count Andel Indarys&lt;/a&gt;, who was a member of the House Hlaalu court. His family were prevalent in Cheydinhal, with people in the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Thorn\"&gt;Knights of the Thorn&lt;/a&gt;."}

Stonefalls is home to the namesake city of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, as it is where the invading &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; forces were defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; alliance.\nBackground.\nIn the final battle of the Akaviri invasion, the Nords of &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Skyrim\"&gt;Eastern Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Jorunn\"&gt;Jorunn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, and a phalanx of &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shellbacks\"&gt;shellbacks&lt;/a&gt; led by a trio of reptilian &lt;a href=\"battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s, broke the Akaviri line and drove them into the sea, where they drowned by the thousands.\nStonefalls' geography varies from place to place. &lt;a href=\"Daen%20Seeth\"&gt;Daen Seeth&lt;/a&gt;, a region in the east, is home to the great volcano &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Mountain\"&gt;Ash Mountain&lt;/a&gt; which is constantly erupting, and thus the surrounding land is burned and charred, but in the city of &lt;a href=\"Davon%27s%20Watch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Davon's Watch&lt;/a&gt;, not far off from Ash Mountain, the land is green and hilly with fungal features, like the neighboring zone &lt;a href=\"Bal%20Foyen\"&gt;Bal Foyen&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Zabamat\"&gt;Zabamat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varanis%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Varanis&lt;/a&gt;, regions in the west and in central Stonefalls respectively, are mostly hilly, barren volcanic landscapes. Another great volcano, the &lt;a href=\"Tormented%20Spire\"&gt;Tormented Spire&lt;/a&gt;, looms over the city of &lt;a href=\"Kragenmoor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kragenmoor&lt;/a&gt; in the southwest, but unlike Ash Mountain, it is not constantly churning out molten rock and lava. In northern Zabamat lies the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;-owned &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Virak\"&gt;Fort Virak&lt;/a&gt;, which protects the border with Skyrim from the wild creatures of Stonefalls. Also in Zabamat is the &lt;a href=\"Fungal%20Grotto\"&gt;Fungal Grotto&lt;/a&gt;, the enormous base of the &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Murkwater Goblins&lt;/a&gt; and a hidden shrine to &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Varanis, the central region of Stonefalls, lies the city of &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;, which is home to a large population of &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;, who are highly distrustful of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; living in the city.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Stonefalls and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralised areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nStonefalls features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests tie into the Ebonheart Pact's overarching storyline and carries on from &lt;a href=\"Bal%20Foyen\"&gt;Bal Foyen&lt;/a&gt; before continuing to &lt;a href=\"Deshaan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Deshaan&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in Stonefalls. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others. Pointer quests are optional zone quests that send the Vestige to the tarting location of another zone quest.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nSixteen Skyshards can be found in Stonefalls totaling in five &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt; with one left over. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nThirty-two books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Stonefalls and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

There were numerous passages in the walls to the south, and tunnels dug through the ground (most which have flooded).\nLarge amounts of flooding in the main section of the prison suggest Stonekeep was built next to a river, or lake.\nHistory.\nStonekeep was originally a palace run by a group of peace-keeping knights, led by a king. It was required to surrender all weapons to the guards upon entering, for the protectors of Stonekeep were the \"keepers of the peace.\"\nAt an unknown point in time, Stonekeep was attacked by Golthog the Dark and his band of &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s who tunneled their way into the fortress. After the goblins had killed the king with a bronze-colored dagger through the chest, the remaining survivors tried to escape through the goblins' caves to the south, etching their statuses onto the walls:\n\"\"An old faded sign reads \"The king and palace are lost. We, the last survivors of the court of Stonekeep, are heading south through the goblins' caves.\"\"\"\"\nFailing, however, the survivors followed the tunnels back to the north to make their last stand, where they were wiped out, their corpses littering the dungeon:\n\"\"An old faded sign reads \"We are following the goblins' tunnels to the north to make our last stand.\"\"\"\"\nAfterward, the fortress became the home to numerous creatures: Rats, Wolves, Orcs, Skeletons, Minotaurs, giant Spiders and Ghouls, as well as Golthog the Dark and his band of Goblins. Golthog's infestation set the stage for the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Rihad%20Palace\"&gt;Rihad Palace&lt;/a&gt;, in turn stealing a document said to reveal part of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scrolls\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Blubamka\"&gt;Queen Blubamka&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Rihad\"&gt;Rihad&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Stonekeep%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Stonekeep&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first part to the second quest of \"Arena\".

I am Queen Blubamka, and I agree to tell you about Fang Lair, for a favor. You see, not too long ago a band of goblins, led by Golthog the Dark attacked this stronghold. They carried away with them much treasure, including a parchment which held within its writings clues to decipher the part of the Elder Scrolls which spoke of the location of the legendary Fang Lair. Golthog and his goblins fled to an ancient and ruined fortress called Stonekeep, outside the city. I fear that a large band of mercenaries or soldiers will be unable to find them. A single person however, would be much more successful. Perhaps your arrival is fortuitous. If you would agree to try and recover this parchment, I will inscribe the location of the Stonekeep onto your map. If you are successful and return with the parchment, I will be able to decipher the location of Fang Lair. I promise to give you that location as reward for your help. Do you agree?\"\nThe Champion should accept:\n\"\"Excellent. Stonekeep lies near Rihad. Be careful, Golthog is crafty and evil. It is even rumored that he is a necromancer serving the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt;.

Again entering the last door on that side in the new hallway. Enter the room, and jump through the passage in the room's west wall. Descending, there is a group of up to ten &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Skeletons&lt;/a&gt; to be dispatched. The Champion should then swim to the central island, where the parchment resides.\nThe island is guarded by a number of &lt;a href=\"Ghoul\"&gt;Ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s, who cause Disease frequently, more so than rats.\nAt the center of the island, there are treasure chests with &lt;a href=\"Luck%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt;-based loot, which may need to be &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;lockpicked&lt;/a&gt;. The parchment lies in the back. After claiming the parchment, a prompt will appear, restating its purpose:\n\"You have found the Parchment the court at Rihad can use to discover the location of the Fang Lair...\"\nThe Champion can then proceed to leave and return to Rihad, or choose to explore Stonekeep further. Stonekeep is relatively low-level, as there are only goblins, &lt;a href=\"Orc%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;, and sometimes even &lt;a href=\"Lizard%20Men\"&gt;Lizard Men&lt;/a&gt; in the main sections.\nThere is an iron key on the middle island due south of the entrance that can be used to open a locked door the farthest back of the conference room that is south of the island. If they choose to go further south into Stonekeep, the Champion will encounter large groups of &lt;a href=\"Spider%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Spiders&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Champion should eventually find their way out and will head back to Rihad, where Blubamka will celebrate and reveal the Fang Lair's location.\nThe Elder Scroll.\nUpon returning to Rihad Palace and seeking Blubamka's audience, she greets the Champion:\n\"\"You have recovered the parchment! I hope you put Golthog into an early grave as well. Still, I will complete my end of the bargain...\" Queen Blubamka motions to a courtier who respectfully bows and brings forward a pen. Staring intently at the parchment, the Queen takes a few moments and then inscribes the location of Fang Lair, somewhere in the province of Hammerfell, onto your map...\"\nSignalling the Champion to take their leave, they should continue to the Fang Lair, and to the first piece of the Staff of Chaos."}

The path is partially submerged and leads to the southeast. The first open area has a &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; lying over a pole. The path continues upstream to the southeast, then turns left (northeast) where eventually two &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt; will appear. On the right hand side further up is a wooden ramp protected by another bandit leading up to the southeast. Near the top is a passage heading left (northeast) to an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy lab&lt;/a&gt; with a random &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;. The path to the lab can be easy to miss, and has a tripwire trap. The room with the lab also has a &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; against the west wall containing &lt;a href=\"Random%20Loot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;random loot&lt;/a&gt;.\nBack on the main path, it eventually leads to a large cave with a waterfall and a bandit mining the moonstone ore veins. An apprentice-locked chest can be found beside the bandit.\nThroughout the cave, there is a wavering distortion in the air, similar to heat distortion around a fire. This indicates the presence of flammable gas, which can be ignited with a flame spell, &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Torch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;. This will have about the same damage as oil on the ground; however, it will be in the air and thus less avoidable. Note that simply holding a fire spell (not charging or firing/fired) will ignite the gas, so caution is needed.\nEntrance to Kagrenzel.\nThe map shows that the path continues further beyond the waterfall. By climbing the rocks opposite the opening (in the east corner of the room) and then using the &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;Whirlwind Sprint&lt;/a&gt; shout, it is possible to reach the top of the waterfall. At the end of the corridor there is a passage to Kagrenzel.\nIn the entrance tunnel for Kagrenzel, there is a Falmer chest on the left side. Climb the wall on the right side and find a &lt;a href=\"Centurion%20Dynamo%20Core\"&gt;Centurion Dynamo Core&lt;/a&gt; at the top of the small waterfall. Turn around and find a &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;flawless diamond&lt;/a&gt; on top of the stone arc, which can be obtained either by shooting it down with an arrow, using the &lt;a href=\"Telekinesis%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Telekinesis&lt;/a&gt; spell, or by jumping and quickly grabbing it while still in the air. Another way to get the diamond is to use the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0shout to blast it down off the ledge or use the whirlwind sprint shout to reach the waterfall and parkour to it.\nThe tunnel eventually leads to a large cave with a bridge over water leading to another tunnel to the left (southeast). There is an adept-locked chest to the left behind the altar. From the bridge &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; will begin to appear from their wall mounted tubes behind the Dragonborn. Sneaking backwards to remain undetected can be effective here. Further down the tunnel, the Dragonborn will be ambushed by several leveled Falmer - due to the cramped tunnel, this can be quite tricky if taken by surprise. Near the location of the ambush is a moonstone ore vein.\nAt the end of the tunnel is a Falmer chest, and a large body of water. In the depths of this pool, to the left (west) of the stone pillar supporting the bridge is an expert-locked &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; chest. Finding it may require &lt;a href=\"Waterbreathing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;waterbreathing&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0spells or potions or the &lt;a href=\"Volsung%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;Volsung Mask&lt;/a&gt;, as water visibility is low. The chest contains leveled loot.\nBoth the tunnel and pool area are prone to rockfalls, although the tunnel rockfall may be fairly harmless due to a bug where the rocks hover just above the tunnel floor. The pool rockfall may cover the Dwemer chest.\nAt this point, it is impossible to go any further, and backtracking is required in order to exit. One cannot gain access to Kagrenzel's main hall by entering through the cave; Kagrenzel's main entrance up the mountain will need to be found."}

One of those assignments is to send frequent reports to Carnius. Carnius will ask the Nerevarine to meet up with Hroldar the Strange in the courtyard and make sure the next messenger never arrives.\nGo to the courtyard and speak with Hroldar. He will tell you to follow him. Follow him to an area a little distance from Fort Frostmoth.

He will ask you to escort him to fort Frostmoth. Lead him to where Hroldar is, and Hroldar's wolves will make short work of him. Getting him killed by any other wildlife will also do the job.\nwhen Tirvel is dead, speak with Hroldar. He will give you three &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Savage%20Tyranny\"&gt;Scrolls of Savage Tyranny&lt;/a&gt; and a note from Carnius. The note will mention that Hroldar has outgrown his usefulness to Carnius, and that Carnius wants you to kill Hroldar. The scrolls may be used to turn his own wolves against him, but using them is not necessary.\nOnce Hroldar is dead, return to Carnius to get your reward."}

He represents logical order and deduction and has taken account of every detail of the world and of every action that has ever taken place on &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, long before they actually happen. As a result, he believes in certainty and determinism, and that the concept of individuality is an illusion.\nGreymarch.\nTies with Sheogorath.\nJyggalag was at one time one of the most powerful of the Daedric Princes; he was so powerful that the other Princes began to fear him and his power. He was believed by some to be the only Prince who knew his nature, and the knowing made him go mad. As a result, they cursed him to live in opposition of everything he stood for, to live the life of a madman and bring chaos and insanity rather than order and logic. Henceforth, Jyggalag became known as the Daedric Prince of Madness, &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, Jyggalag is allowed to return to his original form once at the end of every &lt;a href=\"era\"&gt;era&lt;/a&gt;, an event known in the &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;Shivering Isles&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Greymarch\"&gt;Greymarch&lt;/a&gt;. During this period, Jyggalag's personality resurfaces and exerts control over \"his\" realm to summon the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20Order\"&gt;Knights of Order&lt;/a&gt;\u2014his emotionless, vicious minions\u2014to attack and burn everything in the Isles to the ground. Near the end of the Greymarch, Sheogorath \"leaves\" the Isles and Jyggalag appears in person to finish the Isles off. In reality, Sheogorath simply transforms into Jyggalag. Sheogorath then \"returns\" to recreate the Isles and its inhabitants, causing both identities suffering.\n&lt;a href=\"Apotheosis%20%28Term%29\"&gt;Apotheosis&lt;/a&gt; of the Champion of Cyrodiil.\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;, the Greymarch began once again. This time, however, Sheogorath sent an \"invitation\" of sorts to &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; in the form of a strange door. The &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; went through and met with Sheogorath, who appointed them his champion. Through the Champion's actions, Jyggalag's plans were foiled. Jyggalag was forced to confront the Champion one-on-one and was defeated. His defeat, however, released Jyggalag from his curse. Jyggalag, again free to wander Oblivion in his true form, disclosed his story to the Champion and named them the new Prince of Madness before departing.\nDialogue.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20End%20of%20Order\"&gt;The End of Order&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"You hold the staff, but you are no Daedric Prince!\"\n\"Enough! I am beaten. The Greymarch is ended. For millennia this drama has unfolded, and each time, I have conquered this land, only to be transformed back into that gibbering fool, Sheogorath. It was not always so. Once, I ruled this Realm, a world of perfect Order. My dominion expanded across the seas of Oblivion with each passing era. The other Princes, fearful of my power, cursed me with Madness, doomed me to live as Sheogorath, a broken soul reigning in a broken land. Once each era, I was allowed my true form, conquering this world anew. And each time I did, the curse was renewed, damning me to exist as Sheogorath. Now, though, you have ended the cycle. You now hold the mantle of madness, and Jyggalag is free to roam the voids of Oblivion once more. I will take my leave, and you will remain here, mortal. Mortal...? King? God? It seems uncertain. This Realm is yours. Perhaps you will grow to your station. Fare thee well, Sheogorath. Prince of Madness.\""}

He runs past Jyrik and begins\u00a0shooting bolts of lightning at &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;the orb&lt;/a&gt;, draining it of some of its power, which lowers Jyrik's defenses and\u00a0leaves him vulnerable.

It is suggested that they are similar to Khajiit in terms of body structure as a humanoid cat-like design, and in appearance with stripes in the place of spots. Their leader, &lt;a href=\"Tosh%20Raka\"&gt;Tosh Raka&lt;/a&gt;, is said to have transformed himself into a large orange and black &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;, but it is unknown how similar he looks compared to the regular dragons of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt; consumed all the men on Akavir, they attempted to consume all the dragons. The red dragons were enslaved, but the black dragons fled to the Po'Tun. A great war was raged which left both the Tsaesci and Po' Tun weak, and resulted in all the remaining dragons of Akavir killed. Since then, the tiger people have attempted to transform into dragons themselves. Their leader, &lt;a href=\"Tosh%20Raka\"&gt;Tosh Raka&lt;/a&gt;, is the only one known to have successfully done so.\u00a0Under his rulership, the race renamed themselves from the Po' Tun to the Ka Po' Tun to symbolize their rise above the Tsaesci Empire.\nWhile they have had many feuds, battles, and wars with all the other races in Akavir, the Ka'Po'Tun consider the &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt; their greatest enemies. Following Tosh Raka's coronation as the Tiger-Dragon Emperor, the Ka Po' Tun have managed to become the most powerful Empire in Akavir, and have become more powerful than the Tsaesci themselves. In latest reports, it is said that the Ka'Po'Tun have recently allied with the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Monkey%20People%20of%20Tang%20Mo\"&gt;Monkey People of Tang Mo&lt;/a&gt; in order to fight the Tsaesci. It is also reported that Tosh Raka desired to invade &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; itself after defeating the Tsaesci."}

By diverse methods, Lord &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt;, High Priest and Magecrafter of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, determined that this magical stone was the heart of the god &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, cast here in the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt; as punishment for his mischief in creating the mortal world. Determined to use its divine powers to create a new god for the exclusive benefit of the Dwemer, &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt; forged three great enchanted artifacts, which are called Kagrenac's Tools. &lt;a href=\"Wraithguard\"&gt;Wraithguard&lt;/a&gt; is an enchanted gauntlet to protect its wearer from destruction when tapping the heart's power. &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt; is an enchanted hammer to strike the heart and produce the exact volume and quality of power desired. &lt;a href=\"Keening%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt; is an enchanted blade that is used to flay and focus the power that rises from the heart.\nWhen Kagrenac used these tools on the heart in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, no one knows what happened, but the Dwemer race disappeared entirely from the mortal world. Lord &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; and Lord &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; retrieved these tools, and didn't know what to do with them. Nerevar asked Dagoth to guard the tools while he went to consult with his counselors, &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;. He left and spoke with his three counselors, and they decided to return together to &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; to decide what to do.\nBut whilst Nerevar was gone, Dagoth was tempted and confused by the powers of the tools. When Nerevar and the counselors arrived, he refused to give up the tools, claiming he had sworn to Nerevar to protect them. Then Dagoth fought with Nerevar and the counselors, and was mortally wounded and driven off, and the tools were recovered.\nThen Nerevar and his counselors decided to take the tools for safekeeping. They all swore a great oath never to use the tools, but after Nerevar's death, Vivec, Almalexia, and Sotha Sil yielded to temptation. They took these tools themselves and went to Lorkhan's heart buried beneath Red Mountain, and gave themselves divine powers.\nBut Dagoth had not died. We do not know what happened, but this is what we believe. His experiements with Kagrenac's Tools had joined him to the heart's divine nature in some way, so that he learned to draw power directly from the heart.\nWe conjecture that Dagoth Ur, driven by anger and greed, used the heart without caution and restraint, and, as a result, he has become terribly powerful, and terribly mad. But the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; showed great care and restraint in their use of the tools, and so they were not driven mad, and they did many good things. Nonetheless, the Tribunal, too, appear to have been corrupted by the heart's power, though more subtly.\nKagrenac's Tools are cursed. Stealing power from the heart of a god is a terrible folly, and fated to disaster. The Tribunal is losing its battle to control the power of the heart. They are sustained by the same tainted power that drives Dagoth Ur mad. They grow weak, and cannot protect us from Dagoth Ur. But even if they could, would we be wise to worship gods such as these? They conceal the truth from us out of shame. They persecute the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dissident%20Priests\"&gt;Dissident Priests&lt;/a&gt; out of shame, when they should be welcoming and enlisting their aid against Dagoth Ur.\nThe Tribunal have done much good for Morrowind and the Dunmer. But they succumbed to the temptation of Kagrenac's Tools, and though these tools once may have seemed the instruments of salvation, now they must be seen as instruments of doom."}

The orb will periodically glow even brighter, lighting up the chamber. Two dead &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt; and several urns lie near it.\nActivating the orb triggers a circular gate surrounding the area where the dead bandits are. The orb starts revolving around the gate beeping rapidly at the Dragonborn. After a time, the floor under the gate shifts and opens, dropping anything on it down a long shaft, which ends in an underground lake surrounded by several waterfalls. It is important for the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to be near the exact center of the circular pedestal where the orb sits; if not, they may get killed on the way down. There is an &lt;a href=\"Lock%20Level\"&gt;Expert-locked&lt;/a&gt; Dwarven chest at the bottom of the lake, and an invisibility potion nearby. The only way out is through an upward sloping passageway. There is a &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;falmer&lt;/a&gt; chest to the right of the entrance to this cave. The passageway leads to a bridge spanning the lake and another cave. In the corner of the bridge, between the rocks on the left there is a chest with an adept lock. There is another falmer chest to the right of the Dwarven gateway leading to Stony Creek Cave.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Technology\"&gt;Ancient Technology&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis is one of the possible locations &lt;a href=\"Sorine%20Jurard\"&gt;Sorine Jurard&lt;/a&gt; sends the Dragonborn to recover Dwemer Schematics to improve &lt;a href=\"Crossbows%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;crossbows&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Family%20Heirloom\"&gt;Family Heirloom&lt;/a&gt;.\nA noble family in &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt; had a valuable stolen. They believe the culprits took it to Kagrenzel, and the Dragonborn is asked by &lt;a href=\"Vilkas\"&gt;Vilkas&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve it.\n&lt;a href=\"Shalidor%27s%20Insights%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Shalidor's Insights&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis is one of the possible locations &lt;a href=\"Urag%20gro-Shub\"&gt;Urag gro-Shub&lt;/a&gt; may send the Dragonborn to recover &lt;a href=\"Shalidor%27s%20Insights%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Shalidor's work&lt;/a&gt;."}

The elevator into the ruin is located in a large square shaped pit. The purpose of this ruin seems to be for the &lt;a href=\"Kagrumez%20Trials\"&gt;Kagrumez Trials&lt;/a&gt;, as there are spectator chairs in a balcony, which are accessible once you complete the third trial.\nWalkthrough.\nResonance stone puzzle.\nThe solution for the puzzle is as follows:\nAlternately can be found on each door.\nThe Trials.\nAfter inserting the correct pattern, a \"cage\" will surround the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; while the traps are set, then will retract. After this retraction, the Dragonborn will have to defeat numerous enemies to win the Trial. Each Trial also has various traps that differ in type and arrangement between the Trials.

This unique automaton is named &lt;a href=\"Steadfast%20Dwarven%20Spider\"&gt;Steadfast Dwarven Spider&lt;/a&gt;. In the next chamber, one can acquire a &lt;a href=\"Steadfast%20Dwarven%20Sphere\"&gt;Steadfast Dwarven Sphere&lt;/a&gt; as a secondary companion, both of which are locked inside a small chamber easily opened by a nearby lever. Asking one to follow the Dragonborn while the other one is a follower will cause the first one to go back to its pen: both cannot be followers at the same time. These companions are the only ones of their kind and are not quest-essential. If the Dragonborn happens to lose one during their travels, they can re-spawn. In order to reacquire them, the Dragonborn must pull the lever in front of the place where automaton was found and wait. After one day the pet will be back in the place where it was first found."}

Some sources indicate that at the end of the kalpa, time resets to a new &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt;. Various creation myths prescribe certain deities to the role of destroying the world in order to create it anew; &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic beliefs state that \"our gods are as cyclical as the world itself,\" and attribute this role of destruction to &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; tradition involves &lt;a href=\"Satakal\"&gt;Satakal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; tradition involves &lt;a href=\"Atakota\"&gt;Atakota&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Skaal\"&gt;Skaal&lt;/a&gt; beliefs involve &lt;a href=\"Thartaag\"&gt;Thartaag&lt;/a&gt;. In both Yokudan and Argonian myths the deity associated with the cycle is also the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt; and forms from the conflict between the equivalents of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt; in these myths.\nDue to the age resetting at a new Dawn Era, the creation of &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; can emerge in different ways each kalpa, with different &lt;a href=\"et%27Ada\"&gt;et'Ada&lt;/a&gt; playing different roles. For example, &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; recounts &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; being prince of the &lt;a href=\"Dreugh\"&gt;Dreugh&lt;/a&gt; in what may be a previous kalpa, and &lt;a href=\"Umaril\"&gt;Umaril&lt;/a&gt;'s father is claimed to be god of the world river in a previous kalpa. This is apparently possible because the &lt;a href=\"Leaper%20Demon%20King\"&gt;Leaper Demon King&lt;/a&gt; hides parts of the world from Alduin each cycle, which are then stuck into the world by the Greedy Man, who is likely to be &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Yokudan\"&gt;Yokudan&lt;/a&gt; creation myth states that &lt;a href=\"Satakal\"&gt;Satakal&lt;/a&gt; sheds its skin to create a new world, a cycle that enabled spirits that ultimately learned to travel between worldskins to form. These spirits were able to stride between worldskins through the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Walkabout\"&gt;Walkabout&lt;/a&gt;, a way of \"moving at strange angles\". The Walkabout became so easy for these spirits that it became a place called the Far Shores, which is considered to be \"a time of waiting until the next skin.\"\nThe process has been described as \"a never-ending cycle of rebirth\" and a \"reincarnation of Mundus itself,\", and is believed to be something that Satakal has done and still does many times over, in Yokudan mythology.\n&lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; speak of &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; fighting with them at the \"end of all days\" as the Dark Heart spreads an all-consuming darkness that will leave only &lt;a href=\"Namira\"&gt;Namira&lt;/a&gt;'s worshippers.\nThe end of a kalpa is believed to be the end of the &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; as well as the end of Time, past which even the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;, who \"ride the currents of Time\" cannot see. The outer realms also experience the end of the kalpa. The only realm known to endure the end of a kalpa is the &lt;a href=\"Far%20Shores\"&gt;Far Shores&lt;/a&gt;."}

The Hero is asked to find out who stole it so she can regain her senses.\nAsking Kalthar, he will note that he doesn't know or care where the amulet is, and that Dagail is only allowed to keep her post because of her connections. He also reviles knowledge of Dagail's father, who shared the same condition. He will also state that he hopes that once word gets out she is unable to preform her duties, the guild will step in and remove her.\nAfter further investigations lead to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Blueblood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fort Blueblood&lt;/a&gt;, Kalthar will confront the hero after finding &lt;a href=\"Manduin%27s%20Amulet\"&gt;Manduin's Amulet&lt;/a&gt;. He will confess to stealing Dagails Seer's stone. He notes that he intended to give it back once she was removed, and he advanced in the guild, he would return the stone. After this he will attack and must be killed.\nDialogue.\n\"Well met.\"\n\"Farewell.\"\n\"Well met.\"\n\"You'll see.

But Father would never allow me to marry a commoner, much less a poor &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; miner. &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, what to do?\n11th of Sun's Dawn\nAnother letter from Talvur, the third this week. He says he can't live without me, that he'd rather die than lose me to another. Oh, I feel the same way!\nI can't abide this any longer. Father is sure to find out eventually - the maids are all aflutter over my \"secret love.\" Something will slip. Talvur and I must be long gone by then, or Father will have all &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; up in arms against him.\n22nd of First Seed\nI've convinced Father to take me on his next trip out east. When we reach the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hroldan%20Inn\"&gt;inn at Old Hroldan&lt;/a&gt;, I'll slip out at night and meet Talvur in the hills above &lt;a href=\"Soljund%27s%20Sinkhole%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Soljund's&lt;/a&gt;.\nTalvur says he's been saving his wages for the last few months, stowing them away in the old stump up there. With that, we should be able to buy passage to &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, and our freedom. Oh, love, I can't wait another hour!"}

I guess they found him, because it's collecting dust in the embassy.\n&lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;: A wealthy innkeeper out in the desert has some antique bowl he claims is a family heirloom tracing his line back to some &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt; hero. Looks can be deceiving, but I have my doubts.\n&lt;a href=\"Stormhaven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt;: The first king of Wayrest might have been a good king, but he was a terrible poet.

We won't make you recite it.\n&lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;: One of the more organized &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;n conquerors had to use massive paperweights to wrangle all of his inventories.

The thing's undergoing repair at their local Mages Guild.\n&lt;a href=\"Stonefalls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;: One of the inns had an old coat-of-arms from the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;'s formation sitting in the basement. Seems they aren't sentimental about it.\n&lt;a href=\"Shadowfen\"&gt;Shadowfen&lt;/a&gt;: There was some strange tribe that lived out in Black Marsh alongside the &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;. Unsurprisingly, they're all dead, but the Argonians still keep some artifacts around. There's some religious shovel their people prayed to, I guess.\n&lt;a href=\"Deshaan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Deshaan&lt;/a&gt;: Most of the time Dwarven artifacts are highly prized, but I have a lead on some banner that got taken down and thrown in storage around &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;. Probably more to the story.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Online%29\"&gt;The Rift&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; is basically worshiped by the Fighters Guild. They'd give their sword arms to drink from the same vessel he did, but there's one of his old wine skins that's been sitting untouched."}

Since then, she prepared to take vengeance on him for Gallus' murder and framing her for it, along with betraying Nocturnal and the Thieves Guild with using his lies to become Guildmaster.\nPhysical appearance.\nKarliah is the only Dunmer in the game whose eyes are violet. Her armor is a lighter shade of gray than the &lt;a href=\"Guild%20Master%27s%20Armor%20Set\"&gt;Guild Master's Armor Set&lt;/a&gt; and has the same brown-colored straps and satchels of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20Armor\"&gt;Thieves Guild Armor&lt;/a&gt;. Parts of it can appear purplish in some light, and it also appears to have a unique dagger strapped to the left shoulder, though it is for aesthetic purposes.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Speaking%20With%20Silence\"&gt;Speaking With Silence&lt;/a&gt;.\nMercer Frey and the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; hunt for Karliah in the dungeon &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Veil%20Sanctum\"&gt;Snow Veil Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, after she hinted that is where she wanted to face Mercer due to being the place where Gallus was murdered.\nOnce Mercer &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;picks&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Claws%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon claw&lt;/a&gt; door, the Dragonborn walks in first. Karliah shoots the Dragonborn with a poisoned arrow, and the Dragonborn passes out soon after. Awakening again, their vision is blurry, and Mercer and Karliah are heard talking. From their dialogue, it is learned that Mercer is guilty of committing many &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;crimes&lt;/a&gt; against the guild. Karliah escapes thanks to using an invisibility potion since she knew facing Mercer now was a death sentence and Mercer notices the Dragonborn is still alive.\nHe stabs the Dragonborn, attempting to kill them to ensure the truth is never exposed, but because of the poison on Karliah's arrow, made to slow the victim's heartbeat and stop them from bleeding out, they survive. Karliah then takes them back to her camp outside the Sanctum to nurse them back to health. After the Dragonborn regains their strength, Karliah sends them to &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; to figure out how to decode \"&lt;a href=\"Gallus%27s%20Encoded%20Journal\"&gt;Gallus's Encoded Journal&lt;/a&gt;\".\n&lt;a href=\"Hard%20Answers\"&gt;Hard Answers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn is sent to &lt;a href=\"Calcelmo\"&gt;Calcelmo&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Enthir\"&gt;Enthir&lt;/a&gt; to duplicate the writings on Calcelmo's stone, in &lt;a href=\"Calcelmo%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Calcelmo's Tower&lt;/a&gt;. He will not let them in, so the Dragonborn has to gain entry to the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Museum\"&gt;museum&lt;/a&gt; in another way. Once the translation is acquired, Karliah will be present at the Frozen Hearth inn with Enthir who will translate the passages, confirming that Mercer not only stole vast amounts of gold from the Guild, but desecrated something called the \"Twilight Sepulcher.\" Karliah will express utter shock at this but cannot elaborate just yet. With the evidence in hand, Karliah asks the Dragonborn to meet her in The Ragged Flagon to confront Mercer and reveal the truth to the guild, awarding them with an item which once belonged to Gallus: a level-dependent Nightingale Blade.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Pursuit\"&gt;The Pursuit&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn meets Karliah and faces the guild with her, who are still in the belief she was Gallus' murderer due to Mercer's lies. Karliah hands over Gallus' journal as proof of her innocence and joins &lt;a href=\"Brynjolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Brynjolf&lt;/a&gt; and the others as the vault is opened to reveal that Mercer robbed it dry. Though this vindicates her, she is just as angry as the rest of them and refers the Dragonborn to Brynjolf, who asks them to find evidence of Mercer Frey's whereabouts and will have to infiltrate &lt;a href=\"Riftweald%20Manor\"&gt;his house&lt;/a&gt; to get his &lt;a href=\"Mercer%27s%20Plans\"&gt;plans&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Trinity%20Restored\"&gt;Trinity Restored&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn learns about the Nightingales and is taken to the &lt;a href=\"Nightingale%20Hall\"&gt;Nightingale Hall&lt;/a&gt; by Karliah and Brynjolf to become a Nightingale. She wants them to be prepared for the task of killing Mercer Frey for his betrayal. Once there, after all three suit up in their &lt;a href=\"Nightingale%20Armor\"&gt;Nightingale Armor&lt;/a&gt;, Karliah summons Nocturnal, patron Daedric Prince of thieves, and asks to reinstate her Nightingale status along with granting it to the Dragonborn and Brynjolf. Nocturnal grants her blessing, making them all Nightingales, and they set off to take vengeance on Mercer.\n&lt;a href=\"Blindsighted\"&gt;Blindsighted&lt;/a&gt;.\nKarliah and Brynjolf have traveled to &lt;a href=\"Irkngthand\"&gt;Irkngthand&lt;/a&gt; in their pursuit of Mercer Frey. They want the Dragonborn to meet them there. Inside they need to locate and eliminate Mercer and take the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skeleton Key&lt;/a&gt; he has stolen from &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;. When they find him attempting to secure the &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20the%20Falmer\"&gt;Eyes of the Falmer&lt;/a&gt; before making good his escape from Skyrim, he separates the Dragonborn from Karliah and Brynjolf, before using a Frenzy-type spell on Brynjolf, forcing him into fighting Karliah against his will. The spell is broken once the Dragonborn slays Mercer, and all three escape the flooding chamber when a hole opens in the ceiling, leading them safely out to &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Water%20Cave\"&gt;Bronze Water Cave&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Darkness%20Returns\"&gt;Darkness Returns&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn must return the Skeleton Key, and in order to do so, they have to follow the &lt;a href=\"Pilgrim%27s%20Path\"&gt;Pilgrim's Path&lt;/a&gt; inside the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Sepulcher\"&gt;Twilight Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt;. After this is done, The Dragonborn can go back to the cave and choose a &lt;a href=\"Darkness%20Returns%23Powers\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; each day. Karliah is also allowed a chance to make peace with the spirit of Gallus before he departs to return to Nocturnal's realm.\nConversations.\nMercer Frey: \"Do you honestly think your arrow will reach me before my blade finds your heart?\"\nKarliah: \"Give me a reason to try.\"\nMercer Frey: \"You're a clever girl, Karliah. Buying Goldenglow Estate and funding Honningbrew Meadery was inspired.\"\nKarliah: \"\"\"To ensure an enemy's defeat, you must first undermine his allies.\" It was the first lesson Gallus taught us.\"\"\nMercer Frey: \"You always were a quick study.\"\nKarliah: \"Not quick enough, otherwise Gallus would still be alive.\"\nMercer Frey: \"Gallus had his wealth and he had you. All he had to do was look the other way.\"\nKarliah: \"Did you forget your oath we took as Nightingales? Did you expect him to simply ignore your methods?\"\nMercer Frey: \"Enough of all this mindless banter! Come on, Karliah. It's time for you and Gallus to become reunited!\"\nKarliah: \"I'm no fool, Mercer. Crossing blades with you would be a death sentence. But I can promise the next time we meet, it will be your undoing.\"\nEnthir: \"\"Hmm. This is intriguing, but highly disturbing. It appears that Gallus had suspicions about Mercer Frey's allegiance to the Guild for months. Gallus had begun to uncover what he calls an \"... unduly lavish lifestyle replete with spending vast amounts of gold on personal pleasures.\"\"\"\nKarliah: \"Does the journal say where this wealth came from?\"\nEnthir: \"Yes. Gallus seems certain that Mercer had been removing funds from the Guild's treasury without anyone's knowledge.\"\nKarliah: \"Anything else, Enthir? Anything about... the Nightingales?\"\nEnthir: \"\"Hmm. Yes, here it is. The last few pages seem to describe \"the failure of the Nightingales\" although it doesn't go into great detail. Gallus also repeatedly mentions his strong belief that Mercer desecrated something known as the Twilight Sepulcher.\"\"\nKarliah: \"Shadows preserve us. So it's true...\"\nEnthir: \"I'm not familiar with the Twilight Sepulcher. What is it? What's Mercer Frey done?\"\nKarliah: \"I'm sorry Enthir, I can't say. All that matters is we deliver your translation to the Guild immediately. Farewell, Enthir... words can't express...\"\nEnthir: \"It's alright Karliah. You don't have to say a word.\"\nBrynjolf: \"You better have a damn good reason to be here with that murderer.\"\nKarliah: \"Please, lower your weapons so we can speak. I have proof that you've all been misled!\"\nBrynjolf: \"No tricks, Karliah or I'll cut you down where you stand. Now what's this so-called proof you speak of?\"\nKarliah: \"I have Gallus' journal. I think you'll find its contents disturbing.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Let me see. No, it... it can't be. This can't be true. I've known Mercer too long...\"\nKarliah: \"It's true, Brynjolf. Every word. Mercer's been stealing from the Guild for years, right under your noses.\"\nBrynjolf: \"There's only one way to find out if what the lass says is true. Delvin, I'll need you to open the Vault.\"\nDelvin: \"Wait just a blessed moment, Bryn. What's in that book? What did it say?\"\nBrynjolf: \"It says Mercer's been stealing from our vault for years. Gallus was looking into it before he was murdered.\"\nDelvin: \"How can Mercer open up a vault that needs two keys? It's impossible. Could he pick his way in?\"\nVex: \"That door has the best puzzle locks money can buy. There's no way it can be picked open.\"\nKarliah: \"He didn't need to pick the lock.\"\nDelvin: \"What's she on about?\"\nBrynjolf: \"Use your key on the vault, Delvin. We'll open it up and find out the truth.\"\nDelvin: \"I've used my key, but the vault's still locked up tighter than a drum. Now use yours.\"\nBrynjolf: \"By the Eight! It's gone, everything's gone! Get in here, all of you!\"\nDelvin: \"The gold, the jewels... it's all gone.\"\nVex: \"That son-of-a-bitch! I'll kill him!\"\nBrynjolf: \"Vex! Put it away... right now. We can't afford to lose our heads... we need to calm down and focus.\"\nDelvin: \"Do what he says, Vex. This isn't helpin' right now.\"\nVex: \"Fine. We do it your way. For now.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Delvin, Vex... watch the Flagon. If you see Mercer, come tell me right away.\"\nKarliah: \"Brynjolf, the time has come to decide Mercer's fate. Until a new Guild Master is chosen, the decision falls to you.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Aye, lass... and I've come to a decision. Mercer Frey tried to kill both of you, he betrayed the Guild, murdered Gallus and made us question our future. He needs to die.\"\nKarliah: \"We have to be very careful, Brynjolf. Mercer is a Nightingale, an Agent of Nocturnal.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Then it's all true... everything I heard in the stories. The Nightingales, their allegiance to Nocturnal and the Twilight Sepulcher.\"\nKarliah: \"Yes. That's why we need to prepare ourselves and meet Mercer on equal footing. Just outside of Riften, beyond the Southeast Gate is a small path cut up the mountainside. At the end of that path is a clearing and an old standing stone. I'd ask you both meet me there.\"\nBrynjolf: \"So, this is Nightingale Hall. I heard about this place when I joined the Guild, but I never believed it existed.\"\nKarliah: \"The assumption that the Nightingales were just a myth was seeded within the Guild on purpose. It helped avert attention from our true nature. What's wrong, Brynjolf? I can almost hear your brow furrowing.\"\nBrynjolf: \"I'm trying to understand why I'm here, lass. I'm no priest, and I'm certainly not religious. Why pick me?\"\nKarliah: \"This isn't about religion, Brynjolf... it's business. This is Nightingale Hall. You're the first of the uninitiated to set foot inside in over a century. Now, if you'll both proceed to the armory to don your Nightingale Armor, we can begin the Oath.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Okay, lass. We've got these getups on... now what?\"\nKarliah: \"Beyond this gate is the first step in becoming a Nightingale.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Woah there, lass. I appreciate the armor, but becoming a Nightingale? That was never discussed.\"\nKarliah: \"To hold any hope of defeating Mercer, we must have Nocturnal at our backs. If she's to accept you as one of her own, an arrangement must be struck.\"\nBrynjolf: \"What sort of arrangement? I need to know the terms.\"\nKarliah: \"The terms are quite simple, Brynjolf. Nocturnal will allow you to become a Nightingale and use your abilities for whatever you wish. And in return, both in life and in death, you must serve as a guardian of the Twilight Sepulcher.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Aye, there's always a catch. But at this point, I suppose there isn't much to lose. If it means the end of Mercer Frey, you can count me in.\"\nKarliah: \"I call upon you Lady Nocturnal, Queen of Murk and Empress of Shadow... hear my voice!\"\nNocturnal: \"Ah, Karliah. I was wondering when I'd hear from you again. Lose something did we?\"\nKarliah: \"My Lady, I've come before you to throw myself upon your mercy and to accept responsibility for my failure.\"\nNocturnal: \"You're already mine, Karliah. Your terms were struck long ago. What could you possibly offer me now?\"\nKarliah: \"I have two others that wish to transact the Oath; to serve you both in life and in death.\"\nNocturnal: \"You surprise me, Karliah. This offer is definitely weighted in my favor.\"\nKarliah: \"My appetite for Mercer's demise exceeds my craving for wealth, Your Grace.\"\nNocturnal: \"Revenge? How interesting... Very well, the conditions are acceptable. You may proceed.\"\nKarliah: \"Lady Nocturnal, we accept your terms. We dedicate ourselves to you as both your avengers and your sentinels. We will honor our agreement in this life and the next until your conditions have been met.\"\nNocturnal: \"Very well. I name your initiates Nightingale and I restore your status to the same, Karliah. And in the future, I'd suggest you refrain from disappointing me again.\"\nKarliah: \"Wait a moment... what's that? It's Mercer! Look... down there!\"\nBrynjolf: \"I'm on it, lass. Damn it! There's no way through.\"\nKarliah: \"He's toying with us. He wants us to follow.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Aye, lass... and we'll be ready for him. Let's keep moving.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Look at the size of this place. Have you ever seen anything like it in your life, lass?\"\nKarliah: \"Can't say that I have. Imagine the riches hidden within these walls.\"\nBrynjolf: \"So this is what we heard. The entire tower collapsed.\"\nKarliah: \"The only reason to do that would be to block pursuit. It must be Mercer. We'll have to find another way around.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Mercer was able to knock this thing down? Gods...\"\nKarliah: \"It's the Key, Brynjolf. In his hands, there's no telling what he's capable of.\"\nKarliah: \"Mercer must have triggered these pistons. We're going to have to search for a way to open them.\"\nBrynjolf: \"I'll bet my last septim that there's a mechanism around here somewhere.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Shor's Bones! Look at that monstrosity.\"\nKarliah: \"It's a Dwarven Centurion. Very tough and very deadly.\"\nBrynjolf: \"We can take the beast on or sneak around. It's your call, . We're right behind you.\"\nBrynjolf: \"The stench... this place reeks of Falmer.\"\nKarliah: \"This must be their hive. We'll have to keep silent if we want to avoid drawing their attention.\"\nKarliah: \"There's a mass of the Falmer in this chamber. We can sneak through or take them down... I don't care. As long as we get to Mercer.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Aye. Whatever want to do, we're with you.\"\nKarliah: \"He's close. I'm certain of it. We must prepare ourselves.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Then this is it. We do this for Gallus and for the Guild.\"\nKarliah: \"He's here and he hasn't seen us yet. Brynjolf, watch the door.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Aye, lass. Nothing's getting by me.\"\nKarliah: \"Climb down that ledge and see if you can...\"\nMercer: \"Karliah, when will you learn you can't get the drop on me?\"\nMercer: \"Karliah, I'll deal with you after I rid myself of your irksome companions. In the meantime, perhaps you and Brynjolf should get better acquainted.\"\nBrynjolf: \"What's... what's happening... I can't stop myself.\"\nKarliah: \"Damn you, Mercer! Fight it, Brynjolf... he's taken control of you!\"\nBrynjolf: \"I'm sorry lass, I... I can't...\"\nKarliah: \"Damn! This place is coming down! Quick, get the Skeleton Key and the Eye and lets get out of here!\"\nBrynjolf: \"No luck there, lass. Something must have fallen on the other side of the door because it isn't moving!\"\nKarliah: \"We have to find another way out of here before the place fills with water!\"\nBrynjolf: \"\"Look, I've never been good at these things, so I'm just going to keep it short. Being Guild Master means more than just getting a cut of all the loot, it's about being a leader and keeping this rabble in order.

I don't care if the others are too scared, I'm not going to leave good people starve to death in a dank hole because of silly superstition.\nFound tracks that stop near one of those sinkholes, so someone definitely took a trip down one. Voluntarily or otherwise. Didn't get any response to my calls and the torch I tossed down guttered out almost immediately. Think I hear moving water, so it must be flooded. I don't trust trying to climb down myself, even if I had rope, but maybe there's another way down there. Water's got to be going somewhere.\nLooks like that old manor slid off its foundation, or something, because there's a wall that's come down and a stream leading right into a natural cavern. Think we'll head down until we find a dry place to camp and keep exploring.\nFound a tunnel leading into a massive open cavern. Think I see some columns or something the &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt; who used to live here must have carved out of the bedrock. Looks like that rock's been creeping back to claim it.

Karnwasten is the home of Summerset's criminal underground, where many pirates and smugglers travel to bring in goods from beyond the main island, ideally drugs and outlawed items.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nKarnwasten is hidden among the northern coast of the Isle of Summerset, underneath the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Eton%20Nir\"&gt;Eton Nir&lt;/a&gt;, overlooking the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt; in the north. The entrance to Karnwasten is very well-hidden, which is the point, considering Karnwasten's purpose. The western entrance of the cave is on the outskirts of the ruined city-state of &lt;a href=\"Corgrad%20Wastes\"&gt;Corgrad Wastes&lt;/a&gt;, and near the gateway to the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt;. The eastern entrance is completely isolated, in a path from &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20Run\"&gt;Gryphon Run&lt;/a&gt;. Karnwasten is a maze of sea caves, with coral all throughout the halls. Various creatures, more notably the &lt;a href=\"Salamander\"&gt;Salamander&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Yaghra\"&gt;Yaghra&lt;/a&gt; live in the area. The central area is a shanty port, with small warehouses and docks for the ships.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the area of Karnwasten was under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Runners\"&gt;Night Runners&lt;/a&gt;, a group of outlaws that are prominent all throughout Summerset. At around the same time, a group of &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Sload\"&gt;Sea Sload&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Cabal\"&gt;Abyssal Cabal&lt;/a&gt; had appeared throughout the region, attempting to sink the island into the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Pearls\"&gt;Sea of Pearls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Battlereeve%20Tanerline\"&gt;Battlereeve Tanerline&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt; had sent a group of adventurers to Karnwasten, to investigate the Cabal's threat over Summerset further. The Sea Sload, &lt;a href=\"K%27Garza\"&gt;K'Garza&lt;/a&gt; had taken refuge in Karnwasten, raising the dead of the sea to her bidding. When the group had gone silent, Tanerline had sent a &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Nebarra&lt;/a&gt; to Karnwasten, to rendezvous with the group. With the group secured, K'Garza was dispatched, and the Cabal's plot had weakened. All the while, the Night Runners were originally led by &lt;a href=\"Renzir\"&gt;Renzir&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;i that smuggles illegal goods via Karnwasten. Unfortunately for him, Renzir's crew had suffered a mutiny led by &lt;a href=\"Madja\"&gt;Madja&lt;/a&gt;, his former first mate. Eventually, Madja was killed although the fate of Renzir's goods is unknown. Renzir had left Karnwasten with his wife, &lt;a href=\"Nubani\"&gt;Nubani&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the town of Karnwasten Moor in their quest to recover the pieces."}

During the events of , he was slain by the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;, but his ghost can be summoned with &lt;a href=\"Karstaag%27s%20Skull\"&gt;his skull&lt;/a&gt;.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Summoning%20Karstaag\"&gt;Summoning Karstaag&lt;/a&gt;.\nKarstaag can be fought as part of the unmarked quest \"&lt;a href=\"Summoning%20Karstaag\"&gt;Summoning Karstaag&lt;/a&gt;.\" It requires traveling to &lt;a href=\"Glacial%20Cave\"&gt;Glacial Cave&lt;/a&gt; and retrieving his skull. Once it has been obtained from the cave, it must be taken to &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Karstaag%20Ruins\"&gt;Castle Karstaag Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, which can be unlocked on a Master level, or traveling through the &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Karstaag%20Caverns\"&gt;Castle Karstaag Caverns&lt;/a&gt;, and placed upon his throne. Several &lt;a href=\"Riekling%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;rieklings&lt;/a&gt; have taken up residence in the ruins, and must be defeated first.\nOnce the skull is placed on the throne, the ruins will rumble and begin to shake. A spectral Karstaag will appear from the throne and immediately attack. Once he has been defeated, he will vanish, leaving only his ghostly remains.\nAs a reward for defeating Karstaag, the power &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Karstaag\"&gt;Summon Karstaag&lt;/a&gt; will be granted, which allows the Dragonborn to summon the beast to aid them in battle. This power is unique in that it can only be used three times, after which it is no longer available.\nCombat.\nKarstaag is a powerful foe and can prove to be quite a challenge, making him one of the hardest bosses in the game. He attacks much like a regular &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Giant%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Frost Giant&lt;/a&gt;, using his club, fists and stomp attack, however, these inflict much greater damage. His stomp attack is so strong that it can throw the Dragonborn across the room, much like an &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt; shout.\nHe also has a permanent &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Cloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost cloak&lt;/a&gt; with a large radius that inflicts &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost damage&lt;/a&gt;, the severity of which is dependent upon game difficulty. Occasionally during Karstaag's stomp attack, a &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;blizzard&lt;/a&gt; will begin to swirl in the courtyard, inflicting additional damage to health and stamina over time, which itself can be fatal. Because of this, some form of &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Frost%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Magic%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magic resistance&lt;/a&gt; is useful, especially as stamina can be depleted within seconds.\nKarstaag is completely immune to &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost damage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;paralysis&lt;/a&gt;, however he does have a slight weakness to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire damage&lt;/a&gt;. Once he begins to take damage, he summons three &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Wraith%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ice Wraith&lt;/a&gt;s to aid him in battle, if given the chance. He also regenerates health very quickly. During the entire battle, the ground will shake violently, much like when staggered.\nOne can counter Karstaag's high health regeneration and armor by using all three words of the &lt;a href=\"Marked%20for%20Death\"&gt;Marked for Death&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt;. With repeated use, the effects stack and will greatly reduce his armor value and his maximum health. This will reduce his health regeneration as well as add a damage boost due to the negative armor value caused by the shout. Using the &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Talos%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blessing of Talos&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Talos%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Amulet of Talos&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the shout's cooldown is also recommended. Karstaag's stomp attack knocks away any follower the player may have during the battle, with the only exception being the &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Guardian\"&gt;Ash Guardian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Storm Atronach&lt;/a&gt;. Due to Karstaag's 75% resistance to shock damage, it is recommended to summon Ash Guardians during the battle, so it is important to have a number of &lt;a href=\"heart%20stone\"&gt;heart stone&lt;/a&gt;s at hand. It is also recommended to acquire the &lt;a href=\"Companion%27s%20Insight\"&gt;Companion's Insight&lt;/a&gt; perk to stop the Dragonborn accidentally hurting or killing the followers."}

Kastav was considered to be a poor commander and an incompetent ruler, resulting in his deposition and succession by &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20II\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil II&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nWith Reman Cyrodiil's death in &lt;a href=\"1E%202762\"&gt;1E 2762&lt;/a&gt;, Kastav was at some point crowned Emperor. In the year &lt;a href=\"1E%202801\"&gt;1E 2801&lt;/a&gt;, Kastav ordered the &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; to seize hostages from &lt;a href=\"Markarth\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hroldan\"&gt;Hroldan&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;s \"meet their conscription quotas.\" The Master of the Dragonguard at that time protested against this but his protest was denied by the Emperor. The hostages were housed and trained. Later, in &lt;a href=\"1E%202804\"&gt;1E 2804&lt;/a&gt;, Emperor Kastav ordered the Dragonguard to suppress the &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20Rebellion\"&gt;Winterhold Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; but the Master refused to do so.

In &lt;a href=\"1E%202806\"&gt;1E 2806&lt;/a&gt;, Sky Haven Temple learned that Reman II was crowned after the siege was lifted, and the new Emperor ordered for the siege to end when he was crowned.

They reportedly developed &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; hunting weaponry and techniques, and it was by their blades that Dragons became almost extinct in our lands. Unfortunately, the great Dragonguard order of old has long since been disbanded. If I am to gain their wisdom, it must be from the histories, documents, and artifacts they left behind.\nI believe I have discovered two Dragonguard tombs, fairly close together. It was common for soldiers to be buried with their personal possessions, which I hope will provide the information we seek. Each journal I find, each relic I uncover, provides another tool to aid us against the Dragons invading &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoth tombs seem to be protected by a powerful magic which hides the entrances from sight. Luckily, my former student was able to find a journal describing Dragonguard burial practices. It outlines the custom of placing three glyphs near a tomb's entrance, which will activate in the presence of a Dragonguard seal.These three glyphs should provide the key to the entrance to the tomb.\nHowever, both tombs are located in perilous locations. I worry that visiting both will take up far too much time, and my abbey and students await me back in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. For this task, I require the aid of another. This helper must locate the northern, southern, and eastern glyph, then use what they find to open the tomb.\nI also came across a most curious phrase. I'm certain it's integral to entering the tomb, though I'm unsure how. It is my hope that once the entrance is revealed, the phrase's meaning will also become clear.\n\"With our Blades, Honor is sealed. With Bravery, the Way is revealed.\""}

They turn immediately violent and consider everything that moves to be an enemy. Or food.\nThese husks also demonstrated a total disregard for the husk scent we apply when working in close proximity to them.

The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; cast Merien's White Mask, a spell to hide the villages from the &lt;a href=\"Bloodthorn%20Cult\"&gt;Bloodthorn&lt;/a&gt; invaders. Now &lt;a href=\"Merien%20Sellan\"&gt;Merien&lt;/a&gt; wants the help from them to stop the Bloodthorn activity in &lt;a href=\"Eagle%27s%20Brook%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Eagle's Brook&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nMerien continues to tell the Vestige, the Bloodthorn have been draining his essence to fuel their necromantic rituals. They are transporting the animated dead from the docks, as far as &lt;a href=\"Cath%20Bedraud\"&gt;Cath Bedraud&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; is next.\nWhat can be done to stop them, he is trapped in a pocket place of Oblivion and he thinks he can use the magic he still posses to collapse the plane and end the ritual. But if he fails, the Vestige must burn the Bloodthorn's boats and don't let the zombies leave the village.\nHead downstairs and talk to Tamien, who has been released by Dame Clarique. He thinks his father's foolish plan is too dangerous. He does think the plan will work but he will kill himself in the process. Here the Vestige must make a choice, to either save Merien or stop the Bloodthorns.\nSaving Merien.\nIf the Vestige chooses to save Merien, Tamien is relieved of this choice and adds that the cultists have taken control of a house in the middle of the village. He'll just gather some things and will meet up there. Head over to the house, sneaking if possible, to avoid any cultist and enter the building.\nTamien isn't at the house yet, but the Vestige must locate the portal to the pocket plane by going downstairs and try to find Merien. Enter the portal to the pocket plane, exit the house and look for Merien. The plane is dark and reddish in the air, but it's still the village. Follow the marker to find Merien on the ground outside inside a circle. The Shade of Lord Velian is guarding him and he needs to be killed to free Merien.\nAfter defeating Lord Velian, talk to Merien. He is upset as the Vestige followed him in here instead of taking care of the Bloodthorn. But he soon cools down and is forgiving when he hears his son thought he was too valuable to lose. Merien can still collapse the plane and both return to the portal and walk through it.\nMerien is grateful for the help saving him and promises to make everything right again. Head upstairs to find Tamien who was worried for them. He had been followed by cultists into the house and fought them to protect the portal until both of them returned. He's talking about leaving &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt; now, but he doesn't want Dame Clarique to put him back in chains so he suggests the Vestige go and talk to her while he spends some time with his father.\nHead outside to fine Dame Clarique and tell her that together with Tamien they stopped the necromantic ritual and saved his father, but the Bloodthorn escaped. She hopes it was worth it but agrees that taking care of the cultists and the zombies will not be a problem, it was good they stopped the ritual.\nStopping the Bloodthorns.\nIf the vestige decides that stopping the Bloodthorns is more important, Tamien will be disappointed but he will understand your choice. While Tamien goes into the pocket dimension to save his father, the Vestige should head north to the docks and burn the boats. Take care, as these boats are guarded by many necromancers and zombies. You will be saving villagers by killing these necromancers, but this is of no consequence for the quest. Once you have burned all four of the boats, return to the Sellan House.\nAt the house, you will see Tamien sitting by the dead body of his father. Speak with him, and you will learn that he failed to save his father. They were overtaken by &lt;a href=\"Banekin\"&gt;Banekin&lt;/a&gt; on their way out of the plane, when his father cast a spell to save Tamien. Tamien made it out alive, but Merien did not. Tamien will ask you to speak to Dame Clarique for him; he needs a moment alone to process what has happened. Head outside and tell Clarique what has happened to finish the quest; she will be by the &lt;a href=\"Eagle%27s%20Brook%20Wayshrine\"&gt;Eagle's Brook Wayshrine&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "1441", "revid": "1907256", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1441", "title": "Cyrodiil", "text": "Cyrodiil, also known as Cyrod or the Imperial Province for much of its history, has been the capital province of three human empires in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, and is the homeland of the &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Minotaur\"&gt;Minotaur&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIt is situated in the center of Tamriel, and has had a varied climate throughout its history. Cyrodiil is a wealthy and powerful nation and is the center of the Empire. Cyrodiil serves as the setting for . The demonym is \"Cyrodilic.\"\nPeople.\nImperials.\nAlso known by the demonym \"Cyrodiils,\" the natives of Cyrodiil that comprise the \"&lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt;\" are divided into two ethno-cultural groups; the &lt;a href=\"Nibenese\"&gt;Nibenese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Colovians\"&gt;Colovians&lt;/a&gt;. Colovian Imperials in Western Cyrodiil have a less complicated outlook, and are more self-reliant and independent. Nibeneans are closer in heritage to pure &lt;a href=\"Nedes\"&gt;Nedes&lt;/a&gt; than Colovians, and are generally more concerned with aesthetic and spiritual pursuits than their western brethren. Both groups reflect the Empire's culture; a hybrid of Nordic, Aldmeri, and Akaviri culture. When there is a schism within the Imperial province, it tends to divide along Colovian-Nibenese lines.\nAyleids.\nAyleids, also known as Wild Elves or Heartland High Elves, were a group of &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; who immigrated to the province in the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;. Ayleids worshiped both &lt;a href=\"Aedric\"&gt;Aedric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Et%27Ada\"&gt;deities&lt;/a&gt;, and forced the &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nede&lt;/a&gt;s in slavery. The Ayleids had many cities scattered across Cyrodiil, all now turned to ruin. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20242\"&gt;1E 242&lt;/a&gt;, the Nedic slave queen &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; led &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;a rebellion&lt;/a&gt; which overthrew the Ayleids. Following this, many Ayleids fled to neighboring provinces, most notably Valenwood. By the end of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, most Ayleids were extinct, and &lt;a href=\"Laloriaran%20Dynar\"&gt;the last Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; died in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;.\nNedes.\nRecords of a &lt;a href=\"Nedic\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; civilization during the Merethic Era exist. However Ayleids had started to migrate to Cyrodiil, where they enslaved them into their service.\nMinotaurs.\nMinotaurs are a race of &lt;a href=\"beastfolk\"&gt;beastfolk&lt;/a&gt; to reside in Cyrodiil, and are identified as having the body of a &lt;a href=\"Man\"&gt;Man&lt;/a&gt; and the head of a &lt;a href=\"bull\"&gt;bull&lt;/a&gt;. By the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, Minotaurs are said to not be particularly intelligent, and are described as \"cruel Man-eaters.\"\nBird Men.\n&lt;a href=\"Topal%20the%20Pilot\"&gt;Topal the Pilot&lt;/a&gt; was said to have found an extraordinary race of \"bird creatures\" inhabiting what is now the &lt;a href=\"City%20Isle\"&gt;City Isle&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;. They could not be saved from the hands of the \"cat demons,\" believed to be ancient &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;.\nGovernment.\nCentral government.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; functions as the primary legislative authority of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; of Tamriel. The Council convenes at its chambers in the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;, in the Imperial City. The Council passes a variety of legislation, and has the power to levy taxes from Imperial provinces. The Emperor possesses a veto power over any legislation passed by the Council.\nAppointed by the Emperor, the Council is typically made up of the wealthiest and most powerful men in the Empire. In times where the succession of the Empire is disputed, the Elder Council has both ruled as an interim government and confirmed the final choice of successor. This state of affairs has persisted between the various Cyrodilic empires.\nLocal government.\nEach major city has its own &lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Countess\"&gt;Countess&lt;/a&gt; who rules over the city, and the surrounding county. The Imperial City doesn't have a Count as it is ruled directly by the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;.\nMilitary.\nAs the Imperial Province, the region has unrivaled access to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The force itself comprises several Legions, and is the main fighting force in Cyrodiil and the Empire. Although the majority of the Legion's soldiers come from western Cyrodiil, the Legion is composed of many races from throughout the empire. The Legion's tactics and organization come, to a large degree, from Akaviri practices learned from slaves captured after the Akaviri invasion in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. Its headquarters is located in the Imperial City's Prison District.\nMost of the Legion wears armor that is a combination of leather and chain mail, resembling Roman auxiliary armor called &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Light%20Armor\"&gt;Imperial Light Armor&lt;/a&gt;. The Legion Legates, however, wear &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Armor\"&gt;Imperial Armor&lt;/a&gt; which largely resemble Roman Lorica Segmentata armor or Roman Legionnaire armor. These show the status of each soldier. Imperial legionnaires are trained in a variety of weapons, from polearms to all forms of blades, as well as having specialized cavalry, archers and healers. Imperial battlemages form a specialized corps within the Legion.\nHistory.\nMerethic Era.\nThe earliest accounts of Cyrodiil is the ballad of &lt;a href=\"Topal%20the%20Pilot\"&gt;Topal the Pilot&lt;/a&gt; in the Middle Merethic Era, an &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; explorer who navigated much of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. The ballad mentions a range of creatures in the Nibenay valley, mostly birds and beasts. There are records of &lt;a href=\"Nedic\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; civilization in Cyrodiil during a similar period, however. This was apparently quite advanced, with a series of ruined cities containing catacombs built within mountains and other advanced structures.\nDuring this time the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleids&lt;/a&gt; migrated to Cyrodiil, enslaving the Nedes in the service of their empire.\nFirst Era.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%20242\"&gt;1E 242&lt;/a&gt;, during a period of civil strife between the Ayleid lords, &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; received a vision from &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt; and began a revolt against Ayleid rule. The &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; was forged at this time, as a sign of the pact between them and a reminder that Akatosh would \"hold fast the gates of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;,\" limiting &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; access to &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; and thereby assisting Alessia's rebellion. She was joined her revolt by the heroes &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt;. This rebellion overthrew the Ayleids in less than two years, aided by Nords and uniting the Colovian and Nibenese peoples into one, the empire of Cyrodiil. There also appears to be some revenant of the Ayleids holding land under Alessian rule for some years after the initial rebellion. Due to this patchwork of different cultures and beliefs, most particularly Alessia's &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; allies and the culturally merish slaves she had liberated, Alessia created the pantheon of the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt; at this time as a compromise between merish and Nordic beliefs.\nIn an alliance with Skyrim, the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt; pushed far west towards High Rock, which, at the time, was under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Direnni\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt;, a clan of &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;. This expansion, taking place in the centuries following the rebellion, also saw the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt;, a monotheistic organization led by the prophet &lt;a href=\"Marukh\"&gt;Marukh&lt;/a&gt;. These doctrines held sway over Cyrodiil for many centuries, and during this time a particularly fanatical sect, known as the &lt;a href=\"Marukhati%20Selective\"&gt;Marukhati Selective&lt;/a&gt;, attempted to purge the merish elements from Akatosh. This resulted in the 1,008 year &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Dawn\"&gt;Middle Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, the Alessian Order and the empire it supported fell to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Righteousness\"&gt;War of Righteousness&lt;/a&gt; within ten years.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%202703\"&gt;1E 2703&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; invaded Tamriel. The Akaviri were defeated at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Battle of Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, where the Tsaesci swore loyalty to him and became the &lt;a href=\"dragonguard\"&gt;dragonguard&lt;/a&gt;, forerunners to the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;. Also from this point on until the end of the First Era, &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt; would serve in the Imperial government, most noticeably as the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Potentate\"&gt;Akaviri Potentate&lt;/a&gt;. Under the new rule of Emperor Reman I, Cyrodiil became cosmopolitan, and incorporated architectural and geometrical aspects of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, Colovian, Nibenese, and even Akaviri culture.\nThe Reman dynasty ruled Cyrodiil for more than 200 years after the Akaviri invasion, and under &lt;a href=\"Reman%20II\"&gt;Reman II&lt;/a&gt; brought all of Tamriel save for &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; into the Empire. Reman II also began the inconclusive &lt;a href=\"Four-Score%20War\"&gt;Four-Score War&lt;/a&gt; with Morrowind, which ended in a truce after with the death of &lt;a href=\"Reman%20III\"&gt;Reman III&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond Era.\nAlthough the Reman Dynasty ended in the First Era, the Second Empire endured under the control of Akaviri Potentates. This period saw the outlawing of private armies, and the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; from the Akaviri Syffim in 2E 321 as the weakening Potentate attempted to maintain its power. &lt;a href=\"Savirien-Chorak\"&gt;Savirien-Chorak&lt;/a&gt;, last Potentate, was killed by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; in the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20430\"&gt;2E 430&lt;/a&gt;.\nThroughout the rest of the Second Era, Tamriel was in a state of chaos known as the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; which lasted four hundred years. Nibenay and Colovia split apart, and much Imperial infrastructure fell into disrepair. Many petty warlords tried to claim the Imperial throne. A warlord known as &lt;a href=\"Cuhlecain\"&gt;Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt; arose and, with the help of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, his general, reclaimed much of the First Empire's territories. Following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Battle of Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;, which saw many Nords join Culecain's cause, he was assassinated, either by Talos or an unknown Breton assassin. Talos subsequently took the name Tiber Septim and was crowned Emperor by &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt;. In doing so, he declared the first year of his rule to the be the first of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird Era.\nAfter his coronation, Tiber Septim embarked on a period of restoration for Cyrodiil, in addition to solidifying the provinces of High Rock, Skyrim and Hammerfell under his rule for the first twenty years of his reign. He died in 3E 38, and was succeeded by his grandson, &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20I\"&gt;Pelagius I&lt;/a&gt;.\nA succession of emperors and empresses followed, with &lt;a href=\"Potema\"&gt;Potema&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; attempting to claim the Ruby Throne for her son &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Uriel&lt;/a&gt;, beginning the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt; in 3E 120. The Imperial City was invaded by Uriel in 3E 121 as part of the initial attack, resulting in the seizure of the city and his coronation as emperor. The tide was turned when &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20I\"&gt;Cephorus&lt;/a&gt;, another claimant to the throne, agreed to loosen centralised control over certain provinces in exchange for their support against Potema. Although some consider the war to have been over by 3E 127, Potema held out for a further ten years, supported by undead and Daedric minions, before dying during a siege of her castle.\nA variety of crises in the following years continued to weaken the authority of the Empire, although only some of these touched the Imperial Province itself. The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; imprisoned the Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; in 3E 389. The time of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; that followed resulted in a general decline in relations between Cyrodiil and its provinces, as Tharn's mismanagement caused provincial authorities to rise up against the Empire.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, Uriel Septim VII was assassinated by the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt; cult, precipitating the Oblivion Crisis whereby &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; attempted to invade Tamriel. &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; stopped this, by destroying the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; and defeating Dagon on the streets of the Imperial City itself. Following the Crisis, Chancellor &lt;a href=\"Ocato\"&gt;Ocato&lt;/a&gt;, acting as Potentate, declared the end of the Third Era.\nFourth Era.\nAfter the death of Potentate Ocato in &lt;a href=\"4E%2010\"&gt;4E 10&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Stormcrown%20Interregnum\"&gt;Stormcrown Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; began, which saw a series of pretenders attempt to claim the throne of Tamriel. The Mede dynasty rose to power in &lt;a href=\"4E%2017\"&gt;4E 17&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20I\"&gt;Titus Mede I&lt;/a&gt;, a Colovian warlord at the time, captured the Imperial City from the Nibenese pretender &lt;a href=\"Thules%20the%20Gibbering\"&gt;Thules the Gibbering&lt;/a&gt;, ending the Stormcrown Interregnum. Soon after the Imperial City fell to Mede another pretender, &lt;a href=\"Eddar%20Olin\"&gt;Eddar Olin&lt;/a&gt;, attempted to seize control but was swiftly defeated by the Emperor, solidifying the Mede dynasty's hold on the Empire. In &lt;a href=\"4E%2049\"&gt;4E 49&lt;/a&gt; Cyrodiil was under threat once again, this time by the floating city of &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt; but Titus Mede I was victorious in the end thanks to his son, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Attrebus%20Mede\"&gt;Prince Attrebus Mede&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20168\"&gt;4E 168&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt; ascended to the Imperial throne. By this time Cyrodiil's empire had been heavily weakened. &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; were captured by the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, and in Hammerfell a civil war was being fought between the Crowns and Forebears, though still part of the Empire. In 4E 168, the Empire consists of Cyrodiil, Skyrim, High Rock, Morrowind and Hammerfell. Black Marsh had created its own state which later captured parts of southern Morrowind in the &lt;a href=\"Argonian%20Invasion\"&gt;Argonian Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, and Morrowind was still rebuilding following the eruption of Red Mountain in the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt; of 4E 5.\nOn the 30th of Frostfall, &lt;a href=\"4E%20171\"&gt;4E 171&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; sent an ambassador to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; with a list of demands which &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt; rejected, precipitating the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;, which saw the invasion of Cyrodiil and the sacking of the Imperial City and occupation of &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; before it ended with the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt; in 4E 175.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"4E%20188\"&gt;4E 188&lt;/a&gt;, the city of &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; erupts into violence as a result of a war between two &lt;a href=\"skooma\"&gt;skooma&lt;/a&gt; traffickers. &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt; follows suit and falls to violence sometime during 4E 189 \u2013 4E 200. According to &lt;a href=\"Cicero\"&gt;Cicero&lt;/a&gt;, he claimed that \"The Imperial Province is ravaged by strife. Nowhere there is safe, at present.\" It is implied that many cities in Cyrodiil fell to violence and chaos.\nGeography.\nThe central region of Cyrodiil, the Nibenay Valley, has for much of its history been a temperate region that supports the crops and livestock which feed the remainder of the province. This is enclosed by forests and broken by the rivers which feed the plain. The North and West gives way to mountains, while the south becomes more thickly forested as moves to the borders of Valenwood and Black Marsh. The &lt;a href=\"Valus%20Mountains\"&gt;Valus Mountains&lt;/a&gt; are an extension of the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to the east. While there is a road network, much travel in the province has historically been by river. Major cities in this area include the Imperial City itself, Bravil, Leyawiin, and Cheydinhal.\nThe Nibenay Valley is the most prominent area of the land, a great grassland with &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Rumare\"&gt;Lake Rumare&lt;/a&gt; in its heart. Several small islands dot the surface of this lake, and between them stand great bridges. It is on these islands that the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; stands. The rest of Cyrodiil also contains the cities of &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bruma\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe west of Cyrodiil is named Colovia and includes the areas of the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"West%20Weald\"&gt;West Weald&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Highlands\"&gt;Colovian Highlands&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Reserve\"&gt;Imperial Reserve&lt;/a&gt;. This area includes the cities of &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. This area has rolling countryside and slopes down to a warm coastline to the West and rises to more rugged hills in the North. This area is also noted for its wealth and prosperity.\nCyrodiil as jungle.\nFor parts of its history, Cyrodiil has been described as being primarily composed of jungle. This has been noted by some as being a transcription error from ancient texts, while others consider that a climatic change took place, either as a result of the actions of a person with &lt;a href=\"CHIM\"&gt;CHIM&lt;/a&gt; (most likely Tiber Septim) or through the White-Gold Tower adjusting the climate depending on who rules the land at a given time.\nFormer Bethesda employee &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Kirkbride\"&gt;Michael Kirkbride&lt;/a&gt; has noted that Cyrodiil was originally going to be depicted in as a jungle, but that this was changed during the game's development.\n\"Cyrodiil was going to be as described in the first PGE. [...] The heart of the province being what you think of when you think of a traditional jungle, tumbling down to the fields of large rice paddies that fed the Empire, guarded by Romanesque troops and dragons everywhere. The Imperial City was to be vast, rolling across wetlands and swamps, with large sections lost and overgrown, full of too many cults to count, the oldest temples having obviously been around since the Merethic.\"\nHe attributed the final appearance of the province to influence from \"The Lord of the Rings\" films that had been released around that time.\nCounty capitals.\nAnvil.\nThe port of Anvil is the westernmost city in Cyrodiil, located along the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Dibella\"&gt;Chapel of Dibella&lt;/a&gt; dominates its skyline. It is divided into five districts, including several markets and &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Anvil\"&gt;Castle Anvil&lt;/a&gt;, which lies outside the town walls. Following a decree of the Elder Council in 3E 431, the Anvil Mages Guild is responsible for the sale of &lt;a href=\"Restoration\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; spells.\nBravil.\nBravil is located in southern Cyrodiil on a small peninsula at the mouth of the Larsius River as it empties into Niben Bay. It has been thought to be one of the least well-off cities in Cyrodiil. According to one legend, it is the place where &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt; had the encounter which began the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. In 4E 187, it was also the place of the private residence of the Dark Brotherhood's &lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener&lt;/a&gt;, until the almost total destruction of the Brotherhood in Cyrodiil in 4E 200.\nBruma.\nBruma is the northernmost city in the province of Cyrodiil, located in the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt; along the border to Skyrim. Bruma's northern latitude, combined with its high altitude, results in poor soils and harsh weather. The city is perpetually covered in snow, with clear, sunny days a rarity. The city, being heavily influenced by the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, has adapted to the climate with a much simpler, hardier way of life.\nCheydinhal.\nCheydinhal is the city closest to the Morrowind border near the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Being so close to Morrowind, Cheydinhal is populated and influenced considerably by the Dunmer. To the north is Lake Arrius; to the south, the Reed River; to the southeast, Lake Poppad. The city serves as the centre for &lt;a href=\"Alteration\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; magic for the Cyrodiil Mages Guild.\nChorrol.\nChorrol is a major city in Cyrodiil, located in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Forest\"&gt;Great Forest&lt;/a&gt;, near the &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; border. The city itself is heavily fortified as it serves as county seat for County Chorrol. &lt;a href=\"Weynon%20Priory\"&gt;Weynon Priory&lt;/a&gt;, a monastery of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Talos\"&gt;Order of Talos&lt;/a&gt;, is located nearby. To the east is &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Chorrol\"&gt;Castle Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;.\nImperial City.\nThe Imperial City, in the heartland of Tamriel, is the ancient seat of power and the capital of the Empire of Tamriel. It was once the center of an Ayleid city, noticeable in the gleaming white architecture and magnificent statues.\nKvatch.\nKvatch is a city located on the Gold Road between Anvil and Skingrad. The Count of Kvatch was Ormellius Goldwine, before being killed by the armies of Mehrunes Dagon, along with most of the citizens. The city was the site of the only Arena other than the one in the Imperial City. It is the location of one of the first Daedric incursions into Cyrodiil during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. Before its destruction, Kvatch was the second largest city in Cyrodiil, in front of Skingrad and behind the Imperial City. Kvatch was rebuilt by the time of the Great War.\nLeyawiin.\nLeyawiin is a fortified coastal city and capital of County Leyawiin, in the &lt;a href=\"Blackwood\"&gt;Blackwood&lt;/a&gt; region of southern Cyrodiil. County Lewayiin is nestled around the Southern Nibenay Basin, bordered by Black Marsh to the east, Elsweyr to the west, and the Topal Bay to the south. Situated on the southern west bank of the Lower Niben Bay, the city of Leyawiin guards the passage up the Niben River from Topal Bay to the Imperial City.\nSkingrad.\nSkingrad is a large city located southwest of the Imperial City on the Gold Road, near the border with Valenwood. Skingrad is noted for its wealth and this is reflected in the appearance of the city and its citizens. The city is divided into two sections: North and South. The North contains many upper-class homes, shops and the guild halls. The South is where the chapel is located and many other residences. It is separated by a huge trench running through the city. Before Kvatch was destroyed, Skingrad seemed to have been the third largest city in Cyrodiil. Now it seems to be the second largest city. Most of the city can be viewed from the bridge.\nEconomy.\nThe economy of Cyrodiil is split between the different areas of the province. The center, focused around the Imperial City, is the wealthiest region, as it was here that merchants started to make their fortunes in the First Era. The west of Cyrodiil is very self-reliant, as reflected in the independent attitude of Chorrol and &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt; as a whole. Skingrad, Leyawiin and Anvil are some of the wealthier cities, whilst Bravil, in contrast, is the poorest. The economy of Cyrodiil has been used as the model for economies throughout the rest of the Empire. Rice and textiles are its main exports, along with more esoteric treasure-goods, such as hide armor, moon sugar, and ancestor-silk.\nReligion.\nDivines.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; combines the syncretic Eight Divines pantheon with the founder of the Third Empire, Tiber Septim (&lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;). There are six gods and three goddesses, each of which technically forms their own cult of worship. These cults are typically quite impersonal and the gods considered distant, although there are few exceptions, such as the cults of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is a chapel in each major city in Cyrodiil, venerating one of the Divines. There are also wayshrines along the roads that are devoted to the Divines. These gods also tend to appear in various combinations in the pantheons of other cultures.\nBecause Talos was not originally one of the Divines, in some religious sects they are referred to as \"The Eight And One.\" Following the signing of the White-Gold Concordat, Talos was effectively removed from the pantheon of the Gods and The Eight Divines worship resumed.\nThe Cyrodilic Pantheon.\nIn addition to the Divines, Cyrodiils also worship a range of heroes. This is particularly common practice among the Nibenese, who are famed for their many small cults.\nAlessian Order.\nThe Alessian Order was a once popular monotheistic religion created by the prophet &lt;a href=\"Marukh\"&gt;Marukh&lt;/a&gt; in the early &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. By the time of the Second Era, the religion had lost almost all of its followers. The Alessians were often said to be very strict, humorless people, with their reign over the Empire often remembered for its cruelty and follies, and sometimes referred to as a 'dark age'.\nDaedra worship.\nAlthough technically legal, and referred to as the \"acceptable blasphemies,\" at least at one point in Cyrodiil's history, the practice of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; worship is frowned upon in Cyrodiil, meaning that those who do worship them tend to construct their shrines in remote places, away from major population centers.\nCulture.\nEducation and wealth are broadly distributed across all social classes where Imperial culture has flourished. Many citizens are literate. As the seat of the Empire, Cyrodiil has absorbed the cultures of many places on Tamriel, as well as taking onboard several Akaviri elements.\nCyrodiil's own native culture is split between the Colovians and Nibenese. The former are pragmatic and hardy in outlook, while the latter foster asethetics and lean towards religious mysticism. The Nibenese typically form the ruling classes of Cyrodiil and the Imperial City, although the Imperial line itself has often been drawn from Colovia."}

{"id": "158163", "revid": "32911304", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=158163", "title": "Cyrodiil (Online)", "text": "Cyrodiil is a &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt; in and is the capital &lt;a href=\"province\"&gt;province&lt;/a&gt; and central battleground of the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; fight for control of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;, and the province of Cyrodiil itself.\nBackground.\nCyrodiil is the center of player versus player content where members of each alliance vie for control over &lt;a href=\"Fortifications\"&gt;keeps&lt;/a&gt;, milegates, bridges, mines, mills, farms, towns and temples that each contribute to control over the province.\nThe Alliance War in Cyrodiil is centralized around seizing, holding and controlling strongholds and their resources, utilizing &lt;a href=\"siege%20weapons\"&gt;siege weapons&lt;/a&gt;, taking powerful &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;, and crowning an &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; for the respective Alliance.\nGameplay.\nCyrodiil is accessible after reaching &lt;a href=\"Character%20level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; 10, where one of multiple Campaigns, each acting as different instances with different parameters, can be joined. Characters below level 50 are boosted to the stats that they would have as if they were level 50 to neutralise the level disparity between players, although level 50 characters still have a greater advantage in &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt;, equipment and skill level.\nTransitus Network.\nUnlike other zones, Cyrodiil does not feature any wayshrines beyond the safe zones of each alliance. Instead, keeps, outposts and towns have Transitus Shrines that can only be traveled to from another connected Transitus Shrine. Transitus connections are formed between adjacent Shrines controlled by the same alliance. A Shrine controlled by one alliance cannot be accessed by another alliance until its location is captured. Transitus Shrines in keeps will become inaccessible if the resources around it have been captured by a different alliance than that which owns the keep.\nCampaigns.\nA Campaign consists of a group of players battling for control of Cyrodiil for a set period of time. Campaigns can last from a week to a month, and multiple Campaigns in Cyrodiil occur at the same time but characters can only see others from their own campaign. Characters can assign themselves to 2 campaigns at a time: a home Campaign, in which full rewards are recieved; and a guest Campaign, in which reduced rewards are recieved. Characters are be able to visit other Campaigns at a cost of 15,000 . During a Campaign, an alliance's performance will affect bonuses characters can receive while in Cyrodiil such as increased stats.\nAt the end of a Campaign, players receive rewards depending on how well their allinace performed. Cyrodiil will always remain open, even at the end of a Campaign, and Alliances do not lose any ownership of their fortifications. The only thing that changes at the end of a Campaign is the alliances' scores, which are reset to zero. Individual rewards are also based on the contribution a character made to their alliance's performance. Being among the top 50 of any alliance will award a random epic-quality item, and being among the top 10 grants a significantly boosted set.\nFortifications.\nAlliance wide bonuses are awarded for taking and maintaining &lt;a href=\"fortifications\"&gt;fortifications&lt;/a&gt;, their resources and smaller fortifications such as outposts and towns. There are 18 in total, with six owned by default (but can still be taken by other alliances) in each of the three alliance territories, known as \"Home Keeps.\"\nEvery wall, gate and, in certain fortifications, the roof, in a fortification is destructible. Once it is taken, it stays in the condition in which it was after an attack, meaning that any walls and gates that were destroyed or damaged will need to be rebuilt or repaired. Masonry and woodworking kits can be purchased from the fortification quartermasters to repair damages. There are two flags in the interior of a fortification which must both be held by the same Alliance to capture it.\nThere are three resources around a fortification: a lumber mills, farm and mine, which fuel its upgrade process. Lumber mills help make fortification doors stronger and allow them to repair themselves automatically. Farms make fortification guards tougher and stronger. Mines help reinforce the walls, making them harder to destroy and allowing them to repair themselves over time. Taking control of resources around fortifications also shuts off various patrols in the vicinity. There are capture banners at each resource, and resources are captured independently of fortifications. If all three resources are controlled by an enemy alliance to that which controls the fortification, the Transitus Network link will be broken and teleporting to the fortification is disabled.\nTowns.\nThe citizens of towns in Cyrodiil are neutral towards characters, but guards from the Alliance that holds nearby fortifications will patrol the streets. Each town offers different repeatable quests available to characters of any alliance regardless of who controls the town.\nEmperor.\nThe title of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; is given to the player highest on the Alliance leaderboards while their Alliance controls all of the six fortifications surrounding the Imperial City: &lt;a href=\"Chalman%20Keep\"&gt;Chalman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Aleswell\"&gt;Aleswell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Ash%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Roebeck\"&gt;Roebeck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Road%20Keep\"&gt;Blue Road&lt;/a&gt;. Once crowned, the Emperor will receive a &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20%28Skill%20Tree%29\"&gt;skill line&lt;/a&gt; which can only be gained through achieving Emperor status. Powers warded include being able to make siege more effective, being able to knock down walls quicker, improved attributes and having reduced ability costs. An Emperor is dethroned when their alliance loses all the fortifications necessary to crown an emperor. Losing one or five fortifications will not dethrone the Emperor, all 6 are required. The dethroned Emperor will still have access to the Emperor skill line with reduced benefits and will have their title of \"Emperor\" changed to \"Former Emperor\"\nAlliance Points.\n&lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Points\"&gt;Alliance Points&lt;/a&gt; can be used to purchase armor, weapons, siege weapons and to join a new campaign. The highest amount of Alliance points are awarded for participating in fortification battles and contributing to the fortification's capture, but can be earned through any combat activity or by questing.\nSiege weapons.\n&lt;a href=\"Siege%20weapons\"&gt;Siege weapons&lt;/a&gt; are used to break down walls and gates, collapse the fortification's roof and damage the armies of their opponents. Trebuchets (Firepot and Iceball), catapults (Meatbag, Oil and Scattershot), ballistae (Fire, Ice and Lightning), flaming oil, forward camps and battering rams are available for characters, and they can be obtained and constructed by anyone that has the Alliance Points to purchase them. Rams are mobile, and ballistae, catapults, flaming oil and trebuchets can be packed up after they are deployed so that they can be repositioned for further use. If an enemy siege operator is killed, enemy characters can set the weapon on fire and it will be destroyed; however, players of the alliance owning the weapon can douse the flames and continue using it.\nElder Scrolls.\n&lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt; are artifacts of immense power which provide alliance-wide bonuses. Each alliance has two Elder Scrolls by default and may only receive their bonuses while they are kept in special strongholds or fortifications held by that alliance in Cyrodiil. Enemies from the opposing Alliances can break into these strongholds and take the Elder Scrolls back to their own strongholds and fortifications.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Cyrodiil and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralised areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nCyrodiil does not feature a series of zone story quests in the same way other zones do, but does feature repeatable side quests in its three towns. It is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in Cyrodiil. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another.\nItem Sets.\n&lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War%20Sets\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Alliance War Sets are acquired from merchants in towns in Cyrodiil or as repeatable quest rewards. Some sets consist of rings and necklaces part of the set, rather than weapons and armor also, and have only two set bonuses. Elite Gear Sets are acquired from &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Gear%20Vendors\"&gt;Elite Gear Vendors&lt;/a&gt; in Cyrodiil. Equipment acquired as part of Elite Gear Sets require Alliance Points to purchase. Elite Gear Set items come in specific styles and types, and some sets can be acquired through the &lt;a href=\"Rewards%20for%20the%20Worthy\"&gt;Rewards for the Worthy&lt;/a&gt;. Rewards for the Worthy Set items are earned due to Campaign participation in Cyrodiil. These items are delivered via mail and are often accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Transmutation%20Crystals\"&gt;Transmutation Crystals&lt;/a&gt;. Crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nForty-six Skyshards can be found in Cyrodiil totaling in 15 &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt; with one left over. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nOne hundred and thirteen books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Cyrodiil and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

The cult was created to bring the vampires of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; together into a brotherhood. They are ruthless and will kill anyone who gets in their way.\nThe Order.\nThey are no simple tribe of savages, tearing throats with the orgiastic abandon of their scattered, tribal brethren. Theirs is a civil fraternity, to which they are bound, all of them, by their dual hunger for flesh and influence. By the virtue of Imperial structure and bureaucracy, Cyrodiil has become their stronghold in the third era, and they suffer no savage rivals within their boundaries, they reveal themselves to none, and manipulate society to meet their agendas.\nDual Patrons.\nTo kin-father &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, who brought forth the Bloodmatron Lamae to spite &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, they owe their existence, as do all vampires, though not all honor him. For him, they revel in the feast, and acknowledge the gift adrift in their veins.\nTo patron &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;, beacon of their affairs, they owe their successes and social stature. Their bond with Vile makes them unique among their kind, for his guidance steels their savage craving with reason and savvy. For him they live amidst mankind, and twist them to their will from offices of power.\nRivals.\nMost barbaric tribes think themselves powerful by the gift of Bal's blood alone, and squander the gift. There are those however who show signs of enlightenment and earn their attention, such as the Glenmoril Wryd, who live within the walls of &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; cities, or the Whet-Fang sodality of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, who use magicka to keep captives catatonic and harvest from them the red nectar. These foes may one day threaten to impugn their sovereignty in Cyrodiil. If any encroach upon their border, they kill them.\nConduct.\nTo preserve their ideals and their way of life, they observe two primary edicts. They reveal themselves and their order to no one, for discretion is one of their greatest virtues. Do not feed where they may be found out, or on those who may suspect your passing. Avoid daylight by lifestyle, dispel common belief in vampires, and maintain supple appearance through satisfaction of the thirst. Secondly, they devote themselves to the pursuits of procurement of influence, political and otherwise."}

A ruthlessly effective faction, the Order has monopolized &lt;a href=\"Vampirism\"&gt;Vampirism&lt;/a&gt; within the province, ousting all other bloodlines. Members are experts of concealment and political manipulation; having infiltrated almost every other faction in Cyrodiil; the vampires of the Order, under the guise of mortal men and women, infiltrated politics and the highest echelons of society to consolidate their own power and establish themselves as influential entrepreneurs. Despite being a powerful bloodline of vampires that have managed to make Cyrodiil their stronghold during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, the Order's strength is not in physical numbers, but instead the skillful manipulation of &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; society.\nThe Order demands a strict code of conduct among its members:\n\"Firstly, reveal thyself and our Order to no other, for discretion is the greatest of our virtues. Do not feed where you may be found out, or on those who may suspect your passing. Avoid daylight by lifestyle; dispel common belief in our kind, and maintain supple appearance through satisfaction of the thirst. Second, devote your pursuits to the procurement of influence, political and otherwise.\"\nThe Order views all other vampiric tribes as inferior, although they remain wary of more \"enlightened\" clans such as the &lt;a href=\"Glenmoril%20Wyrd\"&gt;Glenmoril Wyrd&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Whet-Fang\"&gt;Whet-Fang&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Argonia\"&gt;Argonia&lt;/a&gt;. The Order honors two main patrons: &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Kin-father,\" who brought forth the &lt;a href=\"Lamae%20Bal\"&gt;Bloodmatron Lamae&lt;/a&gt; to spite &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, and is the source of their vampiric infection. And &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;, who taught them the arts of concealment and social manipulation, and who helps them control their blood craving. The Order's bond with Vile makes them unique among other vampiric bloodlines. For Him, they live amongst mankind, and twist them to their will to meet their own agendas.\nThe true name of the Vampyrum Order was lost in history, likely as a result of their efforts to remain as secretive as possible."}

The story of starts with Cyrus returning to &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt; in search of his sister &lt;a href=\"Iszara\"&gt;Iszara&lt;/a&gt;, who had gone missing.\nHistory.\nEarly Life.\nCyrus was born in &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; in either &lt;a href=\"2E%20831\"&gt;2E 831&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"2E%20834\"&gt;2E 834&lt;/a&gt;, and was the younger brother of Izsara. During his younger years he often met and spoke with &lt;a href=\"Tobias\"&gt;Tobias&lt;/a&gt;, a half-&lt;a href=\"nord\"&gt;nord&lt;/a&gt; merchant and pirate, and had aspirations to become a pirate.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20852\"&gt;2E 852&lt;/a&gt; he attended a play with his sister, which featured the actor &lt;a href=\"Hakan\"&gt;Hakan&lt;/a&gt;. Hakan and Izsara soon fell in love and married later the same year. Hakan often spoke to Cyrus, and trained him with the sword in combat to teach him a few tricks. Hakan's influence was often on the political situations, such as the &lt;a href=\"The%20Forebears\"&gt;Forebear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Crowns\"&gt;Crown&lt;/a&gt; conflict and the ongoing Tiber wars.\nCyrus then confronted &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20and%20Iszara%27s%20Father\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt; on the matter. His father was a loyal crown who had negative opinions on his son-in-law for his Forebear affiliation. His father explained the conflict between the two factions.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20854\"&gt;2E 854&lt;/a&gt;, his father wrote a play in the night about the ancient &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; defeating the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; to claim the land for their &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt;. This play was an attempt to solve the conflict between the two factions. The play was a huge success, and a celebration party was held in a local tavern after it finished where both Crowns and Forebears attended in equal numbers.\nA 23-year-old Cyrus hosted the celebration. His brother-in-law Hakan was not so impressed. In his drunken state Hakan insulted the old playwright and challenged the also drunken Cyrus in sword combat. Iszara pleaded Hakan to stop, to which he responded Iszara with a slap to the face. They fought and Cyrus emerged the victor, plunging his sword right into Hakan's chest. Following that event, Cyrus ran away, and Tobias took him in.\nLife as a mercenary.\nBetween &lt;a href=\"2E%20855\"&gt;2E 855&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2E%20864\"&gt;2E 864&lt;/a&gt;, Cyrus worked for a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"S%27rathra\"&gt;S'rathra&lt;/a&gt; as a mercenary. S'rathra had sent him and Tobias to do missions in High Rock and Skyrim, as well as Black Marsh. At some point he sent Cyrus and Tobias to the slavery plantation of Tear in Morrowind to free the Khajiit slaves held there. In a surprise attack they ambushed Tear and freed the slaves, but resulted in Tobias experiencing an arm injury. Following the event Cyrus and Tobias went their separate ways, but still kept in touch via their employer S'rathra.\nMeeting in Wayrest.\nIn 2E 864, Cyrus met with S'rathra in &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28City%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; at a tavern. Cyrus asked him about the next job he was to be assigned. Instead, S'rathra showed him a letter sent by Tobias. The letter involved his sister, who he said no one had seen for three months. This prompted Cyrus to buy passage to travel to Stros M'kai. He went with Captain &lt;a href=\"Brennan\"&gt;Brennan&lt;/a&gt; on the journey to the island.\nOn his way to the island Cyrus was confronted by two pirates of the &lt;a href=\"Restless%20League\"&gt;Restless League&lt;/a&gt; who attempted to claim his ship. After defeating the pirates, the Restless League retreated.\nArriving on Stros M'kai.\nUpon arrival to the island, Cyrus received a letter from Tobias, telling him that he was at the &lt;a href=\"Draggin%20Tale%20Inn\"&gt;Draggin Tale Inn&lt;/a&gt;. He later met with his old friend and had a conversation with him, which also mentioned the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Argonia%20%28Artifact%29\"&gt;Eye of Argonia&lt;/a&gt;.\nCyrus met with &lt;a href=\"Kotaro\"&gt;Kotaro&lt;/a&gt;, who tasked Cyrus with retrieving the Amulet of N'Gasta from the &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"N%27Gasta\"&gt;N'Gasta&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20N%27Gasta\"&gt;his island&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for gold.\nCyrus went and retrieved the amulet from &lt;a href=\"N%27Gasta\"&gt;N'Gasta&lt;/a&gt;. He then returned it to &lt;a href=\"Amiel%20Richton\"&gt;Amiel Richton&lt;/a&gt;, though Cyrus asked for information on his sister in return. After Richton refused to give any, Cyrus threatened him and killed his guards but was later knocked out by &lt;a href=\"Dram\"&gt;Dram&lt;/a&gt; and imprisoned in the catacombs beneath the palace.\nFreeing Iszara.\nCyrus went on to negotiate with the Restless League to see what they knew. He then learnt that they were rebel pirates fighting against the oppressive Imperial rule on the island, and that Iszara had become a member of the faction.\nCyrus found out that the Daedric prince &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt; was keeping his sister captive. He killed N'Gasta and entered the realm. After freeing her from her sleep, they escaped his realm.\nRetrieving the Soul Gem.\nCyrus then discovered that N'Gasta's amulet was in fact the Soul Gem of Prince &lt;a href=\"A%27Tor\"&gt;A'Tor&lt;/a&gt; and that the Restless League had been keeping the prince in stasis.\nCyrus then traveled to the palace to retrieve the Soul Gem. He discovered that the gem was being guarded by the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nafaalilargus\"&gt;Nafaalilargus&lt;/a&gt;. Cyrus killed the dragon and took the soul gem back to the Restless League.\nResurrecting Prince A'Tor.\nCyrus, Iszara, &lt;a href=\"Coyle\"&gt;Coyle&lt;/a&gt;, his mother, Saban, and the Restless League then attempted to resurrect the Prince by using the Soul Gem. Saban cast a spell which broke the soul gem. After the ritual they presumed that the spell failed.\nInstead, the prince chose to enchant his sword with his soul. The sword became known as the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Sword\"&gt;Soul Sword&lt;/a&gt;. Disappointed, the Restless League lost faith in their cause. Cyrus instead gave a speech on how it was a victory. It was then discovered that the sword was capable of thinking and moving on its own. The sword guided Cyrus to the palace.\nKilling Amiel Richton.\nCyrus fought against the guards in the palace with the sword. He defeated the assassin &lt;a href=\"Dram\"&gt;Dram&lt;/a&gt;, who then ran off. He climbed out of the palace and fought Amiel Richton on the airship.\nHe defeated the Admiral, who in his last moments distracted Cyrus. This allowed the assassin Dram to hold a dagger to Cyrus' throat, telling him to drop the sword. Cyrus dropped the sword, which then moved on its own accord and killed Amiel Richton. The sword then flew up and killed Dram. Cyrus took up Dram's dagger and used it to break his fall off the airship as it ripped through the fabric. He landed safely as the airship exploded, and the Soul Sword landed at his side.\nRestoring peace to Stros M'kai.\nCyrus then met with Iszara after the victory. She was crowned the new governor of Stros M'kai, but still negotiated with the Empire in order to have the island treated better, having it become an autonomous vassal-state.\nLater life and Legacy.\nIt is unknown what happened to Cyrus after the events of Stros M'kai, but he did return to do some mercenary work. His life remained as a tale by many sailors and pirates, and a hero to the Crowns.\nAccording to one such legend, Cyrus set sail upon his ship \"The\" \"Carrick\" with a crew of men in search of a long lost temple on the remnants of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; and the famed \"Glass Opal of Nogru\". There he supposedly encountered and fought with the very &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;chimeri&lt;/a&gt; God-King of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; himself &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, ultimately to a stalemate.\nCyrus became a legend at least among the inhabitants of the pirate ship in Oblivion\u2019s &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Waterfront\"&gt;Imperial City Waterfront&lt;/a&gt; docks; the pirates can be heard singing songs about Cyrus."}

{"id": "1503", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1503", "title": "Daedra", "text": "Daedra (singular: Daedroth) is the term for the entities who inhabit the &lt;a href=\"realms%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;realms of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; in . They are viewed variously as gods or demons by the inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, although scholarly consensus discourages the use of the latter term. The most powerful of the Daedra are referred to as &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt; or Daedra Lords, and rule over their own planes of Oblivion, which they shaped. Because they have no connection to &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, they cannot be permanently killed, only banished.\nDaedra can be summoned to Nirn through a variety of techniques, which forms the basis for much of the school of &lt;a href=\"Conjuration\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; magic.\nVarious Daedra have, on several occasions, attempted to invade Nirn. The most infamous events of this type are the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"Daedra\" is of &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt;ish origin. Its literal translation is \"not our ancestors,\" as opposed to &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; - \"our ancestors.\" This harks back to their refusal to take part in the creation of Mundus, and as a result are not part of the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;, the ancestors of men and mer.\nThe term \"Daedra\" can be used for both plural and singular forms, although the latter is more correctly \"Daedroth,\" not to be confused with the species of lesser Daedra that go by the same name.\nOrigins.\nSeveral different religions and cultures explain the Daedra and their Princes in different ways, making the distinction difficult to properly define, especially due to certain Daedra discrediting some explanations.\nIn many cultures, Daedra are considered to be \"&lt;a href=\"Padomaic\"&gt;Padomaic&lt;/a&gt;\" beings, as described in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Annotated%20Anuad\"&gt;The Annotated Anuad&lt;/a&gt;\", which claims that the Daedra were formed of the blood of Padomay, prior to the creation of Nirn. This is contradicted by the fact that &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;, a Daedric Prince, was once Merid-Nunda, one of the &lt;a href=\"Magna%20Ge\"&gt;Magna Ge&lt;/a&gt; (including &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;) that withdrew from the world as it was being created. Since these beings were considered \"&lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anuic&lt;/a&gt;\" beings in the same myth, it would mean that Meridia was formed of the blood of Anu instead of Padomay, despite being classified as a Daedric Prince.\nOther accounts describe the Daedric Princes as those &lt;a href=\"et%27Ada\"&gt;et'Ada&lt;/a&gt; who, when &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; proposed the creation of Nirn, outright refused to take part. &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath's&lt;/a&gt; very existence discredits this, as he was once &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Aedra, who was corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; (this process is often said to consist of his literal consumption and eventual excretion by Boethiah).\nIn both cases, however, the conversion of Merid-Nunda and Trinimac into Daedric Princes are both the result of the influence of other Daedra, with the former being \"cast down\" after consorting with them, and the latter changed by one in some fundamental way. It should be noted, however, that it is said Malacath is not considered a true Daedra Lord by his peers, who despise him.\n\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Monomyth\"&gt;The Monomyth&lt;/a&gt;\" provides a slightly clearer definition, stating that the Daedra and the Daedric Princes are all members of the et'Ada that formed with closer ties to Oblivion, stated to be closer to the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; from which they reincarnate new forms upon their deaths, which could account for Meridia's later reclassification.\nLesser Daedric entities were mostly created by the Princes, but the \"&lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20the%20Daedra\"&gt;Spirit of the Daedra&lt;/a&gt;\" implies that a few types were formed naturally, which may account for the Daedra that do not claim loyalty to any particular Prince, such as the Atronachs. The Monomyth states that the Daedra consisted of both \"spirits and Gods,\" further implying that some Lesser Daedra were formed alongside the Princes.\nAncient history.\nWhen Lorkhan proposed to the et'Ada the creation of the mortal plane, Mundus, the Daedric Princes felt it foolish to sacrifice so much power unto a world, and chose instead to create worlds of their own. These \"Daedric Realms,\" created in the chaos of Oblivion, used their own essences to create them, but did not cut that power and matter off from themselves as the Aedra did, allowing them to retain full power and maintain full control over their worlds.\nLesser Daedra created by the Princes served as servants and worshippers, and often as playthings, and the Daedra Lords were content and mostly happy with their realms. Finding the activities of Mundus' mortal races to be far more piquing, the Daedra began to meddle with mortal life, seducing the most promising individuals to spite the Aedra.\nClassification of Daedra.\nDaedra appear in many different forms. The most important are the Daedric Princes, among the oldest and most powerful of their kind. The rest are the \"Lesser Daedra,\" beings who inhabit Oblivion and may or may not be in league with these greater powers.\nDaedric princes.\nThere are considered to be either 16 or 17 Daedric Princes, although records on this vary. Each Daedric prince has a concept or set of concepts associated with them, termed their \"sphere.\" Note that this does not necessarily mean that each Daedra has control over their sphere; rather, they are their particular areas of concern or interest.\nNot all of the Princes were always so. Malacath was once &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;, champion of &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;, but became Malacath after being eaten by Boethiah when he tried to stop the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; from leaving &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset Isle&lt;/a&gt;. Meridia was once counted among the &lt;a href=\"Magna%20Ge\"&gt;Magna Ge&lt;/a&gt;, but became a Daedric Prince when she bent the light of Magnus through herself, carving out her own realm of Oblivion in the process.\nA list of most of the Daedric Princes, their titles, realms, and spheres are listed below:\nLesser Daedra.\nThere are many types of lesser Daedra, most of which were created by the Princes as warriors, servants, playthings, and worshippers. It should be noted that the descriptions of appearances given here are not necessarily always accurate, as to many Daedra, appearance is a matter of choice. Belonging to a particular grouping is, however, said to shape their bodies and minds, and thus common traits are established.\nHumanoids.\nMany Daedra of greater mental capacity have a humanoid shape and appearance. The Daedric Princes and their servants are usually among them. Daedra who usually have a humanoid form are:\nReptilians.\nDaedra have amongst their ranks some reptilian creatures, outlined below.\nAtronachs.\nAtronach are Daedra associated with a particular element, substance or natural phenomenon. They are not nominally aligned with any Prince, and serve them according to opportunity, fancy and circumstance dictate.\nTheir types are: \nAlthough nominally unaligned, these Daedra may have home planes, as Flame Atronachs are noted to originate from a plane known as \"Infernace.\" The home planes of other atronach are currently unknown.\nThere also exist &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Atronach\"&gt;Flesh Atronach&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Atronach\"&gt;Iron Atronach&lt;/a&gt;s, which are creations of mortals, and more correctly golems than any kind of Daedra.\nDaedric artifacts.\nThe spirits of Daedra can be summoned and reshaped into items on a short-term basis, to create &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Weapons\"&gt;bound weapons&lt;/a&gt;, or permanently, to create Daedric artifacts. The text is not clear on whether the Daedric Prince who is lord over the spirit creates bound weapons in Oblivion, which is then summoned to Mundus, or whether the summoner reshapes the Daedra in question.\nDaedric artifacts can be either made by a Daedric Prince, such as the &lt;a href=\"Masque%20of%20Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Masque of Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;, or infused with the spirit of a Daedra, as with the case of the quill &lt;a href=\"Feyfolken\"&gt;Feyfolken&lt;/a&gt;. Still other artifacts become associated with the Daedra over time, despite no known connection to the Daedra, such as &lt;a href=\"Volendrung\"&gt;Volendrung&lt;/a&gt;, which was crafted by the &lt;a href=\"Rourken%20Clan\"&gt;Rourken Clan&lt;/a&gt; of the Dwemer but later became to be associated with Malacath.\nA list of known Daedric artifacts, their forms and their associations, given here: \nAppearance and invocation.\nDaedra can appear on Nirn through summons by both worshippers and conjurers. These can be either short-term summons, or rituals/pacts designed to bind the Daedra to Nirn on a more permanent basis. There are claims that this art originated with the &lt;a href=\"Direnni\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt; clan in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, but the exodus of the Daedra-worshipping &lt;a href=\"Velothi\"&gt;Velothi&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset Isle&lt;/a&gt; in the Merethic Era means this is in all likelihood false.\nThere are no definite restrictions on when or where Daedra may be summoned, although certain dates and circumstances either make this easier or are the conventional times that Daedra-worshiping cults do so, and a summoning is less a command and more an invitation in the case of more powerful Daedra. Daedra of sufficient power may also be able to manifest on their own, although this may also be summoned Daedra who have escaped their bindings.\nIt was theoretically impossible for both lesser Daedra and Daedric princes to manifest while &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;'s covenant with &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; was in force. However, Daedric summoning has been possible throughout Tamriel's history, indicating this was not the case. The extinguishing of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; in 3E 433 did however allow Daedra to manifest Oblivion Gates on Tamriel, allowing large scale Daedric entrance onto Nirn, and for Daedric Princes to appear unimpeded on Nirn. This was remedied when Martin Septim broke the Amulet of Kings and became the avatar of Akatosh, defeating Mehrunes Dagon and sealing the Oblivion Gates. However, small-scale Daedric summonings are still possible.\nCharacteristics and behavior.\nThough all Daedric races have their own characteristics and behavior, there are many traits consistent throughout almost all of them, partially described in \"Spirit of the Daedra\". Firstly the book states that Daedra do not truly fear death or dying, for their \"Animus,\" that conscious essence that could be considered their \"spirit,\" is cast into the Void and reincarnates a new vessel for itself. Due to this, they have no fear of death, but they do have other fears. Many Daedra refer to the Void as the Darkness, and some admit to the shared fear of it that the Daedra have, and they hate it, though the reasons why are unknown.\nDaedra are also stated to feel pain, shame, failure, and loss, and so fear all of these things. Daedra of lesser intellect, such as &lt;a href=\"Scamp%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Scamps&lt;/a&gt;, have very little capacity for fear, while mindless Daedra like &lt;a href=\"Vermai\"&gt;Vermai&lt;/a&gt; cannot fear at all. Daedra such as Dremora, Golden Saints, and Dark Seducers, all have higher intelligence and the capacity for deep thought, and so can only master the fears they have to overcome them.\nDaedric spirits, whether or not they were created by Princes or existing alongside them, are not biologically related to each other, but shape themselves in accordance to the \"clan-form.\" This powerful force causes the bodies their spirits incarnate into from the Void, giving form to the thought, and possibly influencing their psychological states. The clan-form is the cause of differentiation, with the clan-form of a race like the Dremora triggering the reformation of the spirit as a Dremora and the clan-form of the Aurorans causing the reformation as an Auroran. By this reasoning, a Daedra that ends one life as a Dremora could reform as an Auroran, and vice versa. Due to the implication of minds being altered, and the Daedric belief that the clan-form gives them meaning and strength, such a decision is very unlikely to be made.\nDaedra return from the Void through \"cynosures,\" conduits of power that allow the reincarnating Daedroth to return to its realm of residence, and retake its body, shaped in the clan-form. In their fear of the Void, Daedric spirits use the conduits as beacons, to find their way back to their home worlds. Without access to a cynosure, a Daedroth in the Void will simply reside there until the cynosure reopens, or a new and compatible one opens for them. Examples of such structures include the Wellsprings of the Aureals and the Mazken, and the &lt;a href=\"Obelisk%20of%20Order\"&gt;obelisks&lt;/a&gt; of the Knights of Order. While the deactivation of an obelisk does not affect an incarnated Knight of Order, the sealing of the Wellsprings caused either the Golden Saints or the Dark Seducers to instantly die, returning to their bodies when the obstruction was removed. This could be due to the manner of the sealing, using the Daedric crystals of Order, or a characteristic that the two of Sheogorath's races have, and do not share with the Knights.\nNo Daedroth is truly bound to a Prince or other powerful master. Instead they seek out who they perceive as the strongest and greatest amongst the powerful, mostly so that they can be protected by a strong master. The Daedric races serve their masters by clan tradition, but traditions have been known to change, and one individual Daedroth serving a master unlike their race's own is not unheard of. For example, Dremora as a whole have chosen to be in the service of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, but have not always done so, and particular groups of Dremora serve other masters instead. Practice is also known to change based on the \"oath-bond\" between the Prince and its servants, and when this bond is weak, the Lesser Daedra are subjected to their fears.\nMost of the Daedra and their Princes have little heed for mortals, viewing them as little more than toys, and considering themselves to be the huntsmen and the mortals as prey. Daedra of lesser intellect are seen as hounds and work animals to those of higher intellect. Some consider the taste of mortals to be pleasant, and to torment them is seen as \"diverting,\" possibly implying that Daedra toy with mortals as a distraction or to relieve woes and stress.\nDespite their callous torment of mortals, Daedra and their Princes have been known to truly admire mortals at certain times, and feel displeasure when they finally fail. Some will secretly, or even openly, give praise those that can foil their plans and resists their seduction, and even applaud when mortals can find a way to slay them.\nThey acknowledge the frailty and gradual decay of mortals, and consider their victories small things that only require temporary reconstitution at the worst, though even the risk of that makes their torment of Mundus all the sweeter. But the Daedra do sometimes consider mortals a mysterious thing, for they live mostly content lives, despite all the horrid things that they experience, such as failure, death, and loss. Most, if not all, of the Daedra cannot comprehend how mortal races, despite their doom of suffering being painfully obvious, are not consumed by despair when the Daedra, who never experience death and cannot truly understand the concept, despair at failure and pain. Nevertheless, many of the Daedra find this mystery to be one of the most enticing things about mortals, giving them more cause to meddle in their affairs and take interest in their lives.\nDaedric alphabet.\nThe script used in the games is referred to as the \"Daedric alphabet.\" It appears to be most frequently used in relation to magical texts (such as spell scrolls as they appear in ), or esoteric works like the &lt;a href=\"Mysterium%20Xarxes\"&gt;Mysterium Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;.\nDaedra worship.\nDaedra are worshiped in a variety of ways across Tamriel. The most common of these are detailed below.\nDaedra cults.\nThis is the most common way Daedra are worshipped on Tamriel for most of history, because there have been times where such worship has been prohibited in many provinces, and even when it is legal, such as in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; during the Third Era, it is generally not approved of by most of society. However, even if their worship is not condoned, it appears that the celebration of their feast days by non-adherents on some occasions. These cults typically focus on a single Daedric Prince as their prime deity, although given the nature of the cosmos such cults should probably be described as henotheistic or monolatristic, rather than truly monotheistic.\nThese groups are typically quite small and inconsequential because of their size and isolation. However, in the late Third Era, the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, a Daedra cult dedicated to the worship of Mehrunes Dagon, assassinated &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; and precipitated the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dunmer.\nThe Dunmer as a culture have worshipped the Daedra at various points in their history. This has changed over time, and this progression is discussed below.\nChimeri Daedra worship.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; were led away from Summerset by &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; and Boethiah, who ate Trinimac to aid their exodus. Boethiah was joined by Azura and Mephala in leading the Chimer to &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfel\"&gt;Vvardenfel&lt;/a&gt;, and accompanied by Malacath, Mehrunes Dagon, Molag Bal and Sheogorath.\nAzura, Boethiah and Mephala are credited with bringing a particular form of advancement to the Chimer, Boethiah in areas as diverse as philosophy to architecture, Mephala in devising the House system that would define later Chimer and Dunmer society, and Azura taught them how to be different to the Altmer. These are seen as the \"Good Daedra\" in much Dunmeri folklore. The other four Daedra are traditionally seen as testing and opposing figures, although this may be a later elaboration originating during the Tribunal period.\nThe Anticipations and the House of Troubles.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Apotheosis%20%28Term%29\"&gt;apotheosis&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, Daedra took a lesser role in house Dunmeri society, and their worship was prohibited by the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; because it they claimed the Daedra were unworthy due to their inconsistent and dangerous natures. This led to a decline in Daedra worship among the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt;, although the &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; carried on worshipping the Daedra as they had always done. Azura, Boethiah and Mephala allegedly consented to be replaced, and became the \"Anticipations\" of the Tribunal, sharing certain aspects with the Tribunal member who replaced them. &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; replaced Boethiah, &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; replaced Azura, and &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; took the place of Mephala.\nThe other four Daedra previously worshiped by the Chimer did not accept this however, becoming the Four Corners of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;House of Troubles&lt;/a&gt;. Their roles as testing figures and obstacles to be overcome was solidified at this point.\nThe Reclamations.\nFollowing the events of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt; in 4E 5, the Dunmer began to lose faith in the now missing Tribunal, and schisms broke out within the Temple. Eventually the Dissident Priests emerged predominant, and re-instituted the worship of the three Good Daedra, with the Tribunal venerated as saints. As part of this, they were named the Reclamations, and the Ashlanders heralded as the guardians of the truth path of worship.\nThe Khajiit.\nThe Khajiit recognize the Daedra as one of two \"litters\" of spirits created by &lt;a href=\"Ahnurr\"&gt;Ahnurr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fadomai\"&gt;Fadomai&lt;/a&gt;. The Daedra do not differ much from their portrayals in other faiths, but the Khajiit believe that they were created by Azurah out of a single line of \"forest people,\" some of whom were later corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffer\"&gt;Y'ffer&lt;/a&gt; to become the Bosmer.\nThe Orcs.\nThe orcs are derived from the changed followers of &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;, after he was turned into Malacath by Boethiah. Orcs typically follow their changed god exclusively, and his laws form the &lt;a href=\"Code%20of%20Malacath\"&gt;Code of Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, which lay down the basic rules for orc society. This was only different in &lt;a href=\"Gortwog\"&gt;Gortwog&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, where some orcs worship Trinimac in his original form, considering Malacath a demon and an imposter, much to the displeasure of orcs elsewhere.\nThe Ayleids.\nThe now-extinct &lt;a href=\"Ayleids\"&gt;Ayleids&lt;/a&gt; of Cyrodiil worshipped the Daedra alongside the Aedra, forming a variety of cults to worship many Princes. However, they seem to hold Meridia in particular reverence due to her association with light, which the Ayleids considered one of the prime elements of creation. Some claim that they revered Meridia above all other gods.\nDaggerfall Description.\nWithin &lt;a href=\"the%20Daggerfall%20Chronicles\"&gt;the Daggerfall Chronicles&lt;/a&gt;, Daedra have been given a description."}

They're holed up in an old ruin, digging it out in between raids on the caravans.\nJoined up with &lt;a href=\"Kyr\"&gt;Kyr&lt;/a&gt;'s band. Their treasure-hunting dig is a disaster: three months of work have barely cleared a single hall, and six men have died from the cave-ins. I've taken charge of the dig, while Ra'jirr is leading the raids topside. Maybe that year in &lt;a href=\"Cidhna%20Mine\"&gt;Cidhna Mine&lt;/a&gt; will pay off after all.\nYou'd think a man who could swing a sword could use a &lt;a href=\"Pickaxe%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, but these louts are exhausted after barely an hour. No wonder this tunnel's taking forever. I've set up round-the-clock shifts, and ordered double rations for the best diggers.

It's huge, like a whole forest was just swallowed up by the earth, with a big old monument out in the center. Kyr took the sword from it as a trophy, proof his whole plan was finally paying off. For once, he might be right.\nRa'jirr's been having nightmares over the past few days. He keeps muttering about a \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Pale%20Lady%20%28Creature%29\"&gt;Pale Lady&lt;/a&gt;\" - one of those swamp women who steal children away at night, I think. To think some fool story could turn the toughest bandit I know into a cowering kitten, frightened of his own shadow, I'm just glad none of the others see him like this.\nIt's getting worse. Ra'jirr can barely sleep at all now, and whenever he dozes off, he wakes up screaming- woke the whole place last night. He says the \"Pale Lady\" is coming for us- she's down in the forest, we have to return the sword or she'll kill us all. Not a chance- the boss clings to that thing like he was born with it.

After these many years of searching, I'm sure I've located the proper caverns. The Crystals are just as the stories describe; \"...wrapped in crystalline embrace, the silver pierced brow of the Traitors shall ward his sleep.\" This must be the place! This must be &lt;a href=\"Mordrin%20Hanin\"&gt;Mordrin Hanin&lt;/a&gt;'s tomb!\n&lt;a href=\"Badama%20Andarys\"&gt;Badama&lt;/a&gt; and I have established quarters here. No one shall steal my discovery. To imagine what treasures are hidden within this stone. Those &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Guild fools&lt;/a&gt;! Mocking my studies. The Powers I shall unleash upon their miserable skins. Tomorrow we will summon workers to begin excavation.\nThe Summoning was successful, although Badama lacks concentration. We nearly had a &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Atronach%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Storm Atronach&lt;/a&gt;, but her poor skills allowed it to escape. We shall make do with vermin. To think of the earth we could have riven with the Atronach. Now we are forced to watch the &lt;a href=\"Scamp%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Scamps&lt;/a&gt; scrape the surface with picks and shovels. Hideous, miserable creatures.\nOtherworldly, vermin, bastards! Fodder for my cauldron! Scamps are the most untrue of servants. I should enlist the efforts of the Giant Rats of the wilderness and have greater success. Whining, thieving, lazy and treacherous...Scamps! One attempted to flee, stealing a number of potions in his flight. I made short work of him. Perhaps the others will think deeply before following his path. Unfortunately, I was unable to locate one of my best Potions of Rising Force.\nSuccess! I discovered the traces of worked stone, which when inspected closely were obviously of &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; workmanship. After great effort and much moving of earth and stone, the remaining blockage fell away with a great splash into a pool of loathsome water. The foul and noisome air which escaped nearly choked me. The Scamps broke into a great frenzy, trying to hurl themselves through the opening, shrieking with either terror or joy. The creatures are clearly insane.\nI've been forced to erect a gate at the opening. The Scamps still attempt to escape into its maw. I've placed Badama as sentry to monitor the worthless creatures. Perhaps they'll tear her to pieces in her sleep. No, I still require her talents in the upcoming search.\nThe baleful effects of this place are telling on me. I've only just managed to distill some potions to aid us in our endeavor. Soon though, we will enter the chambers and finally realize a life's ambition. Still, though we find the tomb, it may be for naught if we cannot locate the \"Key Guardian.\" Sometimes I hear voices in my dreams calling on name. Is it terror or adulation?"}

The innards of the Elden Grove are described in myth with a misty and labyrinth-esque landscape. The First Tree itself is confused with &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;, which is a &lt;a href=\"Graht-oak\"&gt;Graht-oak&lt;/a&gt; on the other side of the province. The vast forests are not easy to traverse, requiring several lights to see. Traveling further down the dungeon will eventually take you to the inner ruins of the area, filled with water canals that are necessary to use, to reach the inner sanctum. On the northwestern hall is the deepest part of the dungeon, filled with water. In some instances, the term \"Elden Grove\" has been used as a greater region, since city-states such as &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28City%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Greenheart\"&gt;Greenheart&lt;/a&gt; are known to be located in this area.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with General &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;.

The staff was the only thing keeping the Emperor and the General in Oblivion. A lone man escaped Tharn's clutches, and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the Elden Grove, to recover the third piece of the Staff of Chaos.\nIn the search for the pieces of the Staff of Chaos, the Eternal Champion had recently exploited &lt;a href=\"Selene%27s%20Web%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Selene's Web&lt;/a&gt; for the queen of &lt;a href=\"Eldenroot%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Eldenroot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ulandra\"&gt;Ulandra&lt;/a&gt;, and stole a jewel called the \"&lt;a href=\"Quest%20Items%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Heart of Selene&lt;/a&gt;\" so he could learn of the Elden Grove's location. The Grove held the third piece of the Staff of Chaos, which the Champion had already two: the &lt;a href=\"Fang%20Lair%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Fang Lair&lt;/a&gt;'s piece, and the &lt;a href=\"Labyrinthian%20%28Arena%20Location%29\"&gt;Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt;'s.\nThe Champion raided the Grove, and claimed the third Staff Piece for himself. After sleeping once more, &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt; came to the Champion in his dreams, using her dream bridge technique, and explained her divination of the fourth Staff Piece's location."}

The First Level is a great and complex dungeon surrounded by fog with easy enemies, and the Second Level is just as complex as the first, however it has stronger enemies.\n&lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Wraiths&lt;/a&gt; roam the first level, and it is also covered in fog. However, the Champion should not have too much difficulty as long as they refer to a map (the Second Level door is marked blue). An easy way to reach the Second Level is walking on the southern areas of the map and then entering on the corridors which lead to the door, but there are Wraiths and Ghosts that are close to the passages. However, they can be easily avoided or defeated if the Champion knows their locations.\nThe Second Level is an underground area with rivers surrounded by terrain. In this area, &lt;a href=\"Rat%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Rats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Zombies&lt;/a&gt;, and more Wraiths roam the corridors and make the way to the Third Piece dangerous.

Elden Root is the largest city in Valenwood, being built around the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Tree\"&gt;Elden Tree&lt;/a&gt;, a large &lt;a href=\"graht-oak\"&gt;graht-oak&lt;/a&gt; tree that is said to have seeded all of Valenwood.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nElden Root is situated in the central basin of &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt;, which is the southeastern quadrant of the province of Valenwood. East of Elden Root is a large lake with branches of the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Tree\"&gt;Elden Tree&lt;/a&gt; looming over the western bank. A waterway flowing down from the Green Hall region leaks into the basin and areas around the Elden Tree, spewing into the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Hollow\"&gt;Elden Hollow&lt;/a&gt; and the outside marshes on the southwest end of the tree. On the road in Elden Root North is the local Temple, which is situated on a small lake overlooking the greater basin outside of Elden Root. Elden Root South houses various merchants and even the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20Embassy\"&gt;Altmer Embassy&lt;/a&gt;, which is walled-off in the typical High Elven style of architecture. The road along the Elden Tree has the local stables and the &lt;a href=\"Outside%20Inn\"&gt;Outside Inn&lt;/a&gt;, where commoners and passersby go to relax.\nThe city-state of Elden Root takes place mainly within the Elden Tree, a sizeable graht-oak tree in the center of the region. There are two known floors of the Elden Tree. The Ground Level connects to the road surrounding Elden Root, and it is where many merchants settle in Elden Root. The center of the rooms houses a Wayshrine, where people and local tour guides would gather to talk. East of that is the Rededication Shrine, with shrines dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; respectively. Northwest of it is an Ancient Bosmer Shrine where the local &lt;a href=\"Spinner\"&gt;Spinner&lt;/a&gt; would tell stories to the local populous. South of the Wayshrine is various merchants about weapons and army. A kitchen can be found west of the Spinner's Shrine. The Upper Level is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Trunk%20Artisans%20Court\"&gt;Great Trunk Artisans Court&lt;/a&gt;, a vast marketplace with various artisans and crafters operating out of it. In the center of the court is a healthy, blooming tree. North and West of the Court are the Treasury of the Tree, which has two vaults on each side of the floor. Above the Court is the local &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; with the path to the Throne Room in between them.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nGreen-Sap &amp; Early Elden Root.\nThe earliest records of Elden Root have existed in the first era, and it revolves around the stories of &lt;a href=\"the%20Towers\"&gt;the Towers&lt;/a&gt;. The Towers are either natural or artificial structures that stabilize the barrier protecting Nirn from the threats of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. Green-Sap is one of the towers, and it was grown from the &lt;a href=\"Perchance%20Acorn\"&gt;Perchance Acorn&lt;/a&gt;, which was the origin of the Graht-oak tree, of which there are many in Valenwood. Elden Root is one of these trees, along with &lt;a href=\"Falinesti\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28City%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;, among other settlements. Graht-oak trees are meant to move throughout Valenwood with their own seasonal sites, but Elden Root was bound in Grahtwood. As time went on, the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s had immigrated to the province of Valenwood in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;Alessian Slave Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, living with the Wood Elves of Valenwood. The Ayleid refugees had built a massive city around the Elden Tree, establishing the city-state of Elden Root.\nKing Anumaril &amp; the Maormer Invasion.\nOne of these refugees was &lt;a href=\"King%20Anumaril\"&gt;King Anumaril&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Abagarlas\"&gt;Abagarlas&lt;/a&gt;, a worshipper of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;. Anumaril had met with &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;King Camoran&lt;/a&gt;, who showed him the Perchance Acorn deep inside the Elden Root. With Segment One, a piece of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;, Anumaril created the Definite Acorn, and Elden Root was no longer able to move. His purpose was to turn Green-Sap into the new White-Gold Tower, but his plan failed, though it didn't fail either. It is a story that is still going on today. But regardless, the city-state of Elden Root had grown to exponential heights until it was sacked by the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; of the Western Seas, along with other cities like &lt;a href=\"Woodhearth\"&gt;Woodhearth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Haven\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt;. The Elden Tree was besieged, forming the ancient ruins of &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Hollow\"&gt;Elden Hollow&lt;/a&gt;.\nModern-Day Valenwood &amp; the Second Empire.\nAs time went on, the Ayleids had integrated themselves into Bosmeri society, eventually leading to the extinction of the Ayleids. Eldenroot had become a trading post amidst the reign of the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, in the north, the province of Valenwood waged war with the &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt;, who would then ally with the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;. This combined force and the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt;, lead to the Camoran's defeat in &lt;a href=\"1E%202714\"&gt;1E 2714&lt;/a&gt;. In order to prevent an uprising in Valenwood, the Empire had given each &lt;a href=\"Treethane\"&gt;Treethane&lt;/a&gt; throughout Valenwood an independent state within their Empire. Elden Root was one of these settlements along with other townships with Treethanes. The Camoran Dynasty lost substantial influence in Valenwood when the Reman Empire had given the Treethanes influence. The Wood Elves remained obedient, albeit not entirely loyal to the Empire.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Rise of King Aeradan &amp; the Aldmeri Dominion.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20580\"&gt;2E 580&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Elden Root was under the reign of &lt;a href=\"King%20Camoran%20Aeradan\"&gt;King Camoran Aeradan&lt;/a&gt;, who had inherited the throne as a part of the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. It was at this time; the Colovians had invaded the northern end of the province, leaving Aeradan in a dire situation. Looking for help, King Aeradan signed the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Accord\"&gt;Elden Accord&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Gharesh-ri\"&gt;Lord Gharesh-ri&lt;/a&gt;, thus joining the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; and bringing peace into Valenwood. This forced the Colovians out of the province. Aeradan's decision to join the Dominion has left controversy throughout Valenwood. The city-state of &lt;a href=\"Marbruk\"&gt;Marbruk&lt;/a&gt; had left many Wood Elves in the west disgruntled towards the Dominion. At this time, &lt;a href=\"General%20Endare\"&gt;General Endare&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Dragoons\"&gt;Jade Dragoons&lt;/a&gt; had advanced onto the township of &lt;a href=\"Cormount\"&gt;Cormount&lt;/a&gt;, committing one of the most heinous acts in Dominion history, the &lt;a href=\"Massacre%20of%20Cormount\"&gt;Massacre of Cormount&lt;/a&gt;. This brought about the second generation of the &lt;a href=\"Blacksap%20Movement\"&gt;Blacksap Movement&lt;/a&gt; from Cormount, which sought to bring down Aeradan's reign in Elden Root. It was, however, brought down by the hands of the Dominion. Elden Root was named the capital of the Aldmeri Dominion due to the city's proximity to the warfront in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlot against the Queen &amp; the Khajiiti Embassy.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; of the Dominion traveled to the city-state of Elden Root with the intent to enter &lt;a href=\"The%20Orrery%20%28Elden%20Root%29\"&gt;the Orrery&lt;/a&gt;, where it would reveal whether she was a capable leader in the eyes of the Dominion. King Camoran Aeradan prepared for the arrival of Elden Root, where they established an &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20Embassy\"&gt;Altmer Embassy&lt;/a&gt; for the High Elves of the Dominion. Ayrenn ordered for the construction of the Khajiiti Embassy, but the project was delayed, prompting unrest in the city-state. An &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Elite Agent&lt;/a&gt; of the Dominion had approached the Elden Root Throne Room and spoke with both the King and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Naemon\"&gt;Prince Naemon&lt;/a&gt;, Ayrenn's younger brother. Naemon tasked an &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Elite Agent&lt;/a&gt; with investigating the situation and &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Tarinwe\"&gt;Ambassador Tarinwe&lt;/a&gt;, who was at the Altmeri Embassy. The Agent revealed that the Khajiiti Embassy was never planned, it was only an empty promise to make Ayrenn look bad in front of the people. The Agent, with the help of &lt;a href=\"Azareth\"&gt;Azareth&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Vinedusk%20Rangers\"&gt;Vinedusk Rangers&lt;/a&gt;, were able to expose Tarinwe as an Agent of the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Veiled Heritance&lt;/a&gt;, and so her trial had begun in Elden Root. But with that out of the way, the Dominion needed to prepare for the official ratification ceremony at the Orrery.\nThe Orrery of Elden Root &amp; the Tragedy of Naemon.\nWith the situation in Elden Root finished, Queen Ayrenn sends the Agent to retrieve three items that could operate the Orrery. To the &lt;a href=\"Long%20Coast\"&gt;Long Coast&lt;/a&gt;, the Agent had to bring &lt;a href=\"Daraneth\"&gt;Daraneth&lt;/a&gt;, the conservator of the Orrery from &lt;a href=\"Southpoint\"&gt;Southpoint&lt;/a&gt;. To &lt;a href=\"Green%20Hall\"&gt;Green Hall&lt;/a&gt;, the Agent was tasked to find the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Anumaril\"&gt;Heart of Anumaril&lt;/a&gt;, from the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Reliquary%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Reliquary of Stars&lt;/a&gt;. And from &lt;a href=\"Tarlain%20Heights\"&gt;Tarlain Heights&lt;/a&gt;, the Agent was tasked to find &lt;a href=\"Rajhin%27s%20Mantle\"&gt;Rajhin's Mantle&lt;/a&gt; from the ruins of the &lt;a href=\"Falinesti%20Winter%20Site\"&gt;Falinesti Winter Site&lt;/a&gt;. As time went on, the Elite Agent had gathered the three items, and Daraneth was able to operate the Orrery, and the nobility of the Dominion gathered to witness such an event. One of the people who was denied entrance into the Orrery Chamber was &lt;a href=\"Vicereeve%20Pelidil\"&gt;Vicereeve Pelidil&lt;/a&gt;, who would later leave for &lt;a href=\"Marbruk\"&gt;Marbruk&lt;/a&gt;. As the Daraneth prepared the Orrery, the Elite Agent had placed the Heart in its respective position. The Agent had donned Rajhin's Mantle so that they would not be bound when the process had begun. As the ritual began, Prince Naemon had hastily entered the Orrery to learn whether he was Emperor material. But when he came out, he turned into a vile &lt;a href=\"Ogrim\"&gt;Ogrim&lt;/a&gt; and attacked the bounded ritual attendees including Ayrenn. With Rajhin's Mantle, the Elite Agent was freed from the magical bounds and defeated Prince Naemon. Saddened by her brother's death, Ayrenn entered the Orrery where she was shown a future, where the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; was under the banner of the Aldmeri Dominion. Ayrenn had fully-established herself as the Queen of the Aldmeri Dominion. Queen Ayrenn sends the Elite Agent to Marbruk, to find the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;.\nCamoran Anaxemes &amp; the Second Aldmeri Dominion.\nDuring the waning years of the Interregnum in &lt;a href=\"2E%20830\"&gt;2E 830&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Anaxemes\"&gt;Camoran Anaxemes&lt;/a&gt; and other heirs to the Camoran Throne had fought for it for quite some time. Sometime later, the Summerset Isles had invaded Valenwood and established a provisional government which would become the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Second Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, which would then be lead by the Isles' claimant to the throne, which is Anaxemes. The Thalmor of the Second Dominion was able to hold the borders along the &lt;a href=\"Strid%20River\"&gt;Strid River&lt;/a&gt; and eventually incorporated the &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20Confederacy\"&gt;Elsweyr Confederacy&lt;/a&gt; to the east. The city-state of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt; served as the capital of the Aldmeri Dominion, while the city-state of Elden Root was made into the capital of Valenwood, taking the position from Falinesti. Since the city-state of Falinesti is changing locations after every season, for convenience sake, Elden Root was made the capital. Elden Root was at one point the seat of power for the Camoran Dynasty, as seen in 2E 582, but it was changed back to Falinesti when the city had returned from wherever it had disappeared to.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Staff of Chaos &amp; the Elden Grove.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Eldenroot in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Eldenroot was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ulandra\"&gt;Queen Ulandra&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Eternal Champion reached the city of Eldenroot on their quest to find the third piece of the Staff. Through the visions of &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt; and rumors from the people, the Champion had traveled to the southern forest, to the city of Eldenroot in the province of Valenwood. There the traveler ventured to the local Castle where they met Queen Ulandra, the wood elven queen of the Kingdom. Ulandra gives the Eternal Champion a proposition where if they defeated &lt;a href=\"Selene\"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt; the sorceress from her home at &lt;a href=\"Selene%27s%20Web\"&gt;Selene's Web&lt;/a&gt;, then she would reveal the location of the piece. After defeating the Selene at her stronghold, Ulandra showed the way to the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Grove\"&gt;Elden Grove&lt;/a&gt;, a mystical labyrinth located in the western end of Valenwood. It was there that the Eternal Champion had obtained the third piece of the staff. The Champion had moved on to find the fourth piece of the staff somewhere in Tamriel."}

The &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt; proposed Elden Root as the capital of the Aldmeri Dominion for strategic reasons \u2013 by allowing for the continental races located on the mainland of Tamriel to be bound to the Elves of &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 and for mystical reasons.\nElden Tree.\nThe city is centered around a large graht-oak tree known as the \"Elden Tree\" which contains the vast bulk of the city's shops, workstations, shrines and the Elden Root Wayshire.\nSouth of the Elden Tree.\nTo the south of the Elden Tree is seven Guild Traders, an Undaunted Enclave and the Altmer Embassy.\n&lt;a href=\"Altmer%20Embassy\"&gt;Altmer Embassy&lt;/a&gt;.\nAcross the south of the city is the Altmer Embassy which was created to establish relations between the Altmer of the Summerset Isles and the Bosmer of Valenwood. It is intended to unite the two races of the Dominion.

Here the potentate declared universal martial law, and demanded the princes of Tamriel to dissolve their armies, which resulted in a war which would take a heavy toll on the Empire, but would end up in reforms regarding the Fighters Guild and Mages Guild.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, following &lt;a href=\"Varen%27s%20Rebellion\"&gt;Varen's Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; the Elder Council was temporarily disbanded due to the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;, an attempted invasion by &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to fuse the &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; with his realm, &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;. During this crisis, several members of the Council had fled south towards &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;. The Daedric Cultists of &lt;a href=\"The%20Order%20of%20the%20Waking%20Flame\"&gt;the Order of the Waking Flame&lt;/a&gt; killed several council members in an attempt to send a message, where Councilor Vandacia betrayed the rest of the council and revealed himself as a member of the cult.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%2082\"&gt;3E 82&lt;/a&gt;, the Emperor &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Pelagius Septim II&lt;/a&gt; inherited the Ruby Throne from his father, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Uriel Septim II&lt;/a&gt;. His father had caused a great debt for the Empire due to his poor financial and judicial management. In order to resolve the debt of the Empire, Pelagius dismissed the entire Elder Council, allowing only those willing to pay great sums of &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;septims&lt;/a&gt; to keep their seats, and encouraged similar acts among his vassals. Though the reforms of Pelagius did resolve the economic troubles of the Empire, it was said that Pelagius may have sent away important advisors who could not afford the sums, which may have led to some of the troubles his heir, &lt;a href=\"Antiochus%20Septim\"&gt;Antiochus Septim&lt;/a&gt;, had to face during his rule. Pelagius died in &lt;a href=\"3E%2098\"&gt;3E 98&lt;/a&gt;, and his death may have been at the hands of one of the vengeful Council members he sent away.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%2099\"&gt;3E 99&lt;/a&gt;, the Council had not yet convened to name Antiochus Emperor. Antiochus blamed &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema Septim&lt;/a&gt; for the delay, as she supported the claim of her son, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Uriel Septim III&lt;/a&gt;, for the throne. Six weeks had passed since the Emperor's death, and the Council claimed the delay was related to the updating of records and preparation for the coronation. Potema would eventually try to blackmail Antiochus through a forged letter, which stated the father of Antiochus was not Pelagius Septim II, but failed in convincing Antiochus to give up his claim. Shortly after, Antiochus would be crowned Emperor, and as an Emperor he was not interested in the politics of the Empire. Unlike the Emperor himself, his children did play in the political field, &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Septim\"&gt;Magnus Septim&lt;/a&gt; had married &lt;a href=\"Hellena\"&gt;Hellena&lt;/a&gt;, the Imperial Queen of &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt; after the original Argonian priest-king was executed. Magnus would represent Imperial interests in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; admirably. &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus Septim&lt;/a&gt; and his wife, &lt;a href=\"Bianki\"&gt;Bianki&lt;/a&gt; ruled over &lt;a href=\"Gilane\"&gt;Gilane&lt;/a&gt; in Hammerfell. But the most active of all the Septims of this time period was the Wolf Queen of Solitude, Potema.\nYears later, in &lt;a href=\"3E%20119\"&gt;3E 119&lt;/a&gt;, Antiochus had fallen into a coma. After months, the Elder Council prepared for the coronation of his daughter, the fifteen-year-old Kintyra Septim II, who was engaged with Council member Modellus. Potema, however, disagreed with the notion that Kintyra would become Empress. She went to the Elder Council, and held a speech there. Starting off with flattery and humility, and following up with praise of Antiochus Septim, emphasizing on the importance he had with the Elder Council during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Isle\"&gt;War of the Isle&lt;/a&gt;. Not long after, Potema spoke of the true motif she had arrived. She made Antiochus out as a man who bedded many whores within the city, and as such, claimed his children were bastards. After saying this, she proposed her own son, Uriel III, be named the rightful heir. This proposal would be refused by the Council, and Potema would be sent back to Skyrim.\nOn the third of First Seed, &lt;a href=\"3E%20120\"&gt;3E 120&lt;/a&gt;, Kintyra Septim II was crowned, with her uncles, Magnus and Cephorus both being attendance, but her aunt, Potema being in Skyrim. Because of this coronation, Potema started the assembling of a rebellion, which would be involved in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;. Originally, Potema had the support of Skyrim, High Rock, and northern Morrowind, but High Rock switched allegiances due to the influence of Cephorus and Magnus. Hammerfell, Summerset, Valenwood, Elsweyr and Black Marsh were divided, however, the majority of its kings supported Cephorus and Magnus. The Council would be involved in the war, having some authority over the Imperial armies, they split up the Imperial forces to attack western High Rock and eastern Morrowind after the advances of Potema and Uriel's armies, resulting in the Imperial City being besieged and conqeured by Uriel III's forces, and Uriel's proclamation of Emperor. The war would end up with the deaths of Potema Septim and Uriel Septim III, and the coronation of &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pelagius Septim III&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20145\"&gt;3E 145&lt;/a&gt;, Pelagius was proclaimed Emperor, and his behavior was noted down from the start. From embarrassing dignitaries and offending kings, to an attempt of hanging himself following a ball. As such, the throne would be handed over to his wife, &lt;a href=\"Katariah%20Septim%20I\"&gt;Katariah Septim I&lt;/a&gt;, with Pelagius himself meeting death in &lt;a href=\"3E%20153\"&gt;3E 153&lt;/a&gt; at the age of thirty-four.\nKatariah was shunned by many for being a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, and considered her ascendancy the true mark of the decline of the Septim bloodline. Others, who supported Katariah, stated that despite her not being related to Tiber, her son was. Katariah would end being well-liked by the people of the Empire, but the Council greatly opposed her. Due to unrest in Black Marsh, and the massacring of Imperial troops within the land, the Council and Katariah had to find a solution to the problem of the Imperial armor used in the land, as it would endanger them during summertime. Whereas Katariah proposed a former slave, a member of the council named &lt;a href=\"Hazadir\"&gt;Hazadir&lt;/a&gt; proposed &lt;a href=\"Sirollus%20Saccus\"&gt;Sirollus Saccus&lt;/a&gt;, the finest armorer in the Imperial City. The two would both craft armor, which would be tested by a champion in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%2C%20Arena%20District\"&gt;Imperial City Arena&lt;/a&gt;. The armorer who would come out on top would receive the commission. The Arena was slightly flooded to simulate the climate of Black Marsh, and would end with the armor of Hazadir coming out on top, and Katariah obtaining the support of the Council. Katariah would later die in a minor skirmish in Black Marsh, which was in part caused by a disenfranchised branch of the Septim family.\nThe real aftermath of the decision by Pelagius Septim II are apparent under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20IV\"&gt;Uriel Septim IV&lt;/a&gt;. Due to Uriel IV being adopted into the Septim family, many members of the Council refused to accept him as a blood descendant of Tiber Septim. Under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Katariah%20Septim\"&gt;Katariah Septim&lt;/a&gt; the Council had taken over much responsibility, and due to the alien and strong-willed nature of Uriel IV it was nearly impossible to command their unswerving fealty. This resulted in the Council and the Emperor being at odds many times, with the majority of the time the Council coming out on top. Since the days of Pelagius II, the Council had consisted of the wealthiest men and women within the Empire, and they wielded true, and conclusive, power. Due to the dislike between the Council and the Emperor, the Council voted to disinherit the son of Uriel IV, named &lt;a href=\"Andorak%20Septim\"&gt;Andorak Septim&lt;/a&gt;, and a cousin who was more closely related to Tiber Septim was instead chosen to be the heir in &lt;a href=\"3E%20247\"&gt;3E 247&lt;/a&gt;, named &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Cephorus Septim II&lt;/a&gt;. This would result a war between the forces loyal to Cephorus and those loyal to Andorak, which eventually ended when the Elder Council gave a part of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, the Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;, to Andorak.\nBy &lt;a href=\"3E%20268\"&gt;3E 268&lt;/a&gt;, the throne had been taken over by &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20V\"&gt;Uriel Septim V&lt;/a&gt;, who returned favor to the Empire after many wars. He turned the attention of Tamriel away from strive within itself by conqeuring &lt;a href=\"Roscrea\"&gt;Roscrea&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20271\"&gt;3E 271&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cathnoquey\"&gt;Cathnoquey&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20276\"&gt;3E 276&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yneslea\"&gt;Yneslea&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20279\"&gt;3E 279&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Esroniet\"&gt;Esroniet&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20284\"&gt;3E 284&lt;/a&gt;. Four years later, he set out on an expedition for &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;, which would ultimately result in the death of the Emperor.\nFollowing the death of the Emperor, his son, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VI\"&gt;Uriel Septim VI&lt;/a&gt; was only five years old. As such, the throne was provided to his mother, &lt;a href=\"Thonica\"&gt;Thonica&lt;/a&gt;, under certain restrictions. The Elder Council kept the real power in the Empire, as they had done ever since Katariah I. The Council enjoyed their freedom and power so much, that Uriel was only given the throne in &lt;a href=\"3E%20307\"&gt;3E 307&lt;/a&gt;, when he was 22 years of age. The Emperor has slowly been taking over position of responsibility, but both the Council and his mother were hesitant to give up their power. By the time he was crowned Emperor, he held little power, save for the imperial veto. Uriel would frequently take advantage of this power, however, and by &lt;a href=\"3E%20313\"&gt;3E 313&lt;/a&gt;, the Emperor truly held power in the empire. Through the use of defunct spy networks and guard units, he bullied and coerced difficult members of the Elder Council, and he had the support of his half-sister &lt;a href=\"Morihatha%20Septim\"&gt;Morihatha Septim&lt;/a&gt;. It was later said by the sage &lt;a href=\"Ugaridge\"&gt;Ugaridge&lt;/a&gt; that \"Uriel V conquered &lt;a href=\"Esroniet\"&gt;Esroniet&lt;/a&gt;, but Uriel VI conquered the Elder Council.\" Following the death of Uriel VI, Morihatha would continue where he had left off. She returned the power in the Imperial province to the Emperor and Empresses of the land. She took action against rebellions in the Empire which had been ongoing since the days of Cephorus II. Despite her success in these battles, her slow pace frustrated the Council. An Argonian councilman known as &lt;a href=\"Thoricles%20Romus\"&gt;Thoricles Romus&lt;/a&gt; is commonly believed to have been responsible for her death at the hands of assassins in &lt;a href=\"3E%20339\"&gt;3E 339&lt;/a&gt;, following her refusal to send troops to his troubled homeland of Black Marsh. Thoricles was summarily tried and executed, but protested innocence until his death.\nDuring the Oblivion Crisis of &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, it was said that the Elder Council held the real power in the Empire, and that the Council, being led by &lt;a href=\"High%20Chancellor%20Ocato\"&gt;High Chancellor Ocato&lt;/a&gt;, had been running the Empire for the past 15 years. Following the murder of the Emperor and his heirs, the Empire was left without a Septim to put on the throne. Ocato insisted the Council could govern the Empire perfectly fine, and that most of the Council had returned to their home provinces to deal with local matters, with only the Inner Council meeting regularly. At this same time, the Council could not pull the Legions back from the provinces due to the entire Imperial army being fully commited and the political aftermath it would have to pull the troops away. Eventually, the Elder Council would accept &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt; as the Emperor, but before the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; could be relit and the official coronation could take place, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; invaded the Imperial City. Martin would eventually smash the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt; and take on the shape of an avatar of Akatosh to fight Dagon. Martin came out victorious, but at the cost of his own life. The Oblivion Crisis was over, and the Septim dynasty had ended.\nFollowing the crisis, many provinces began to consider about seceding from the Empire, and even the High Chancellor himself was uncertain about the future of the Empire.\nFollowing the crisis, opinions were divided regarding Ocato. Some counts supported the High Chancellor, as he was the de-facto ruler of the Empire, the count of &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; feared Ocato would attempt to make himself Emperor. Others pointed out that Ocato, and the rest of the Council, cared nothing for Cyrodiil, as they focused on the other provinces and left Cyrodiil to fend for itself.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the early Fourth Era, the full Elder Council tried their best to find an heir to the throne, but failed. Because of this, the Empire beyond Cyrodiil began to splinter, and Ocato reluctantly agreed to become the Potentate following the terms of the Elder Council Charter until Imperial rule could be reestablished. The Potentate did the best he could to combat the circumstances which were tearing the Empire apart, and making headway until the eruption of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. The eruption resulted in Morrowind being thrown into chaos, and Black Marsh suffering from destroyed roads and Imperial garrisons being cut off. While Morrowind and the Imperial forces within Black Marsh were still in shock due to the Oblivion Crisis and the eruption of Red Mountain, the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; incited the Argonians to form a massive uprising, resulting in Black Marsh becoming independent and southern Morrowind falling to the Argonians. Not long afterwards, Ocato was assassinated by the Thalmor, resulting in the &lt;a href=\"Stormcrown%20Interregnum\"&gt;Stormcrown Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; and the Elder Council fracturing. The interregnum was filled with violence, plots, and back-stabbing alongside violent unnatural storms, which were speculated to be the judgement of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;. With the Empire lacking a ruler, the Thalmor took over &lt;a href=\"Summerset\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt; and renamed it Alinor. Only after seven years did the Interregnum end, with &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede\"&gt;Titus Mede&lt;/a&gt; taking the throne. Titus Mede proved a shrewd and capable leader, and was endorsed by Skyrim because of it.\nMany years later in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt; would rule over what remained of the Empire, consisting of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Amaund%20Motierre\"&gt;Amaund Motierre&lt;/a&gt;, sought the death of the Emperor, and paid for the deed by offering an Amulet given to members of the Council. Amaund elaborated that upon the death of &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim\"&gt;Pelagius Septim&lt;/a&gt;, a necessary change took place in Imperial policy, and that some now sought a similar change. Amaund claimed the death of the Emperor would serve the Empire and all of Tamriel in ways which could not be imagined. Whether the Emperor was assassinated or not is unclear.\nLaws.\nThe following are laws and decrees either agreed upon or established by the Elder Council.\nDuties.\nThe Elder Council's task is to keep the Empire running. Their responsibilities consist of the day-to-day management of the Empire, such as the administration and overseeing provinces, advising the Emperor, and the creation of laws. They are also tasked with handling the specific ruling of the Empire. Where the Emperor rules, the Council deals with all the details. The Council also holds some power over the Empire's military actions, and has the authority to pull forces from the provinces if needed. If a member of the Council is forced to participate in a war, they wear the traditional armor of the Elder Council.\nDuring absence of an Emperor, the Council is supposed to rule the Empire as an interim under the leadership of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Chancellor\"&gt;High Chancellor&lt;/a&gt;. The Council may elect an Emperor/Empress Regent with restricted powers should the incumbent Emperor not yet reach an age of majority or be incompetent. They are also responsible for recognizing and crowning the next ruler after an Emperor's death. Normally this is the heir of the previous Emperor.\nIn unique situations, the Elder Council can be forced to take regency for a long time, thus allowing them complete control over all military forces of the Empire. The Elder Council, alongside the Emperor, can also implement a War Tax during times of war to fund the Legions.\nHeadquarters.\nThe Council convenes at its chambers in the center of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt; complex, within the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. The Council chamber is comprised of a large circular table, encircled by tall chairs. The table is in the exact center of a dome-shaped room. The palace is built inside the ancient &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;, which extends hundreds of feet into the air.\nRanking.\nThe exact details of what makes up the council is unknown. Known members are:\nThe Council is further sub-divided into two groups. The Elder Council as a whole, which includes representatives of all the provinces, convenes when necessary, but in general its representatives are in the provinces they represent to deal with local matters. The Inner Council is the second body of the Council, and holds regular meetings. Each of these members is provided with an amulet as a token of office. This amulet is worth a small fortune of 15,000 &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;Septims&lt;/a&gt; when fenced."}

Elder dragons can use both &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Breath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fire Breath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Breath\"&gt;Frost Breath&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey are considered middle-class compared to other dragons, the strongest being the &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Dragon\"&gt;Legendary Dragon&lt;/a&gt; (if the &lt;a href=\"Official%20Add-ons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;add-on&lt;/a&gt; is installed) and the weakest being a generic &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;. Spawning on the &lt;a href=\"world%20map\"&gt;world map&lt;/a&gt;, Elder Dragons can be encountered at &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt;s as low as 22 and as high as 50.\nPhysical appearance.\nThese dragons undergo a massive change in design from Frost to Elder. Not only are they larger, and obviously more intimidating, but they feature a more noticeable bronze colored body, with spots of black dotting the skin.\u00a0\nInstead of a row of spines, or a sail, these dragons have a mere row of bony bumps dotting their spine, however, they essentially trade that for a meaner, more aggressive looking facial structure. They have two massive, curved horns on their heads, with a more angular, pointy face.\u00a0\nLastly, these dragons also possess the regular spaded tail that the generic and Frost dragons also have.\nGameplay.\nThese dragons do not have a set elemental shout, instead using either a Fire Breath shout, or a Frost Breath shout. They are far more powerful than previous dragon variants in terms of attacks, both ranged and physical, meaning engaging these dragons is quite a battle if the Dragonborn does not have a set of armor capable of defense, or a weapon capable of quickly downing the dragon.\nEssentially, one of the best strategies would be to try and keep the dragon still, while hammering it from afar, pelting it with any kind of arrow. &lt;a href=\"Dragonrend\"&gt;Dragonrend&lt;/a&gt; is especially useful for this purpose and can easily give the Dragonborn the upperhand if used effectively."}

The quest is the twelfth in the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;main questline&lt;/a&gt; of . The quest is particularly long, spanning five different locations, including two &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwemer Ruins&lt;/a&gt;. During the quest, much of the lore behind &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt; themselves is revealed.\nBackground.\n\"I met the master of the Greybeards, the dragon Paarthurnax. He told me that the ancient Nords used an Elder Scroll to cast Alduin forward in time. If I can recover that same Elder Scroll, I may be able to use it to learn the \"Dragonrend\" Shout directly from the ancient heroes.\"\nWalkthrough.\nPaarthurnax.\nSpeak with &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt; and ask about the Elder Scroll.\nArngeir/Esbern.\nTo learn more about the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Dragon%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt;, visit &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt; and speak with &lt;a href=\"Arngeir\"&gt;Arngeir&lt;/a&gt;, or speak with &lt;a href=\"Esbern%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Esbern&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of who is asked, both will say to visit the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nCollege of Winterhold.\nUpon arrival to the College of Winterhold, the Dragonborn will be met by an &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Faralda%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Faralda&lt;/a&gt;. If the College of Winterhold was not yet joined, the Dragonborn will be prevented from entering the college. There are several options to gain entry:\nShould the Dragonborn succeed in one of these actions, Faralda will allow entrance into the College.\nOnce access to the college has been granted, the Dragonborn needs to locate &lt;a href=\"Urag%20gro-Shub\"&gt;Urag gro-Shub&lt;/a&gt;, an Orsimer mage who runs &lt;a href=\"the%20Arcanaeum\"&gt;the Arcanaeum&lt;/a&gt;, the library located in the College. Then, he should be asked about the Elder Scrolls. Urag will place the two books written about them on his desk for the Dragonborn to take. If one has not yet started the side quest \"&lt;a href=\"Discerning%20the%20Transmundane\"&gt;Discerning the Transmundane&lt;/a&gt;,\" reading \"&lt;a href=\"Ruminations%20on%20the%20Elder%20Scrolls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ruminations on the Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;\" will begin that quest. After telling Urag that the \"Ruminations on the Elder Scrolls\" is incomprehensible, he will say that the book was written by an expert on the Elder Scrolls, &lt;a href=\"Septimus%20Signus\"&gt;Septimus Signus&lt;/a&gt;. He gives the Dragonborn the last known location of Septimus.\nAlternatively, one can simply go to &lt;a href=\"Septimus%20Signus%27%20Outpost\"&gt;Septimus Signus' Outpost&lt;/a&gt;, and avoid entering the College altogether.\nSeptimus Signus.\nGo to Septimus Signus's Outpost, the northern iceberg where Septimus has made his home. Climb down the ladder to find Septimus working on a &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; Box. Ask Septimus about the Elder Scroll, and he will say that it is hidden in the depths of &lt;a href=\"Blackreach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt;, a large underground Dwemer city that lies underneath the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Alftand\"&gt;Alftand&lt;/a&gt; and many other Dwemer ruins. He will give an &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20Sphere\"&gt;Attunement Sphere&lt;/a&gt; needed to gain entry to Blackreach, and the &lt;a href=\"Blank%20Lexicon\"&gt;Blank Lexicon&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlftand.\nThe next stage of the mission leads to Alftand, leading on to the ancient underground city of Blackreach. This portion of the quest can be difficult for lower-level characters, as Blackreach contains many &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; and Dwarven &lt;a href=\"Animunculi\"&gt;Animunculi&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlftand is located in the glacial mountains southwest of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. When entering Alftand, one will need to travel through large glacial tunnels. Follow the tunnel until reaching the Dwemer Ruins. When reaching the barred door, proceed to the passage that heads west up a ramp.\nContinue north, and there will be two &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Sphere%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven Spheres&lt;/a&gt;. Kill or avoid them and head through the door and up to a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven Spider&lt;/a&gt;\u2013infested passage stretching south. This main passage leads east, above the room with the Dwemer Spheres in it. Dodge the pistons and continue on to the &lt;a href=\"Alftand%20Animonculory\"&gt;Alftand Animonculory&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlftand Animonculory.\nTravel through the &lt;a href=\"Alftand%20Animonculory\"&gt;Alftand Animonculory&lt;/a&gt;, past the spinning blades, to find a locked gate. There is a lever on the right by the big pipe and on the other side of the gate that is accessible from the far left position. Open the gate and proceed to a massive shaft in the Animonculory. Travel down this shaft and within it are four Falmer.\u00a0Dispatch or sneak by them. Alternatively, use the &lt;a href=\"Become%20Ethereal\"&gt;Become Ethereal&lt;/a&gt; shout to jump straight to the bottom. Taking this course could potentially cause the Dragonborn to be overwhelmed by the number of Falmer at the bottom, and bypasses valuable items on the way down.\nMidway down the shaft, one of the ramps is broken, requiring a jump down to the platform below. This could potentially result in taking some damage. To minimize damage, jump to the pipe on the right side to descend approximately halfway down prior to jumping. At this point returning to the levels above is only possible by continuing to another exit and re-entering Alftand.\nOnce at the bottom there is an entrance to a door preceded by fire jets. While it is possible to walk through the fire jets to the door, it is also possible to avoid taking fire damage by passing through a small gap between the pipes on the left side. Enter the door, which leads to a Falmer nest. Go through the nest, dispatching or avoiding the Falmer inside. Go though the door on the southwest. This leads to a bridge, followed by another looping walkway containing several Falmer and at least one Frostbite Spider.\nAlftand Cathedral.\nNow enter the Alftand Cathedral. Battle or avoid the two Falmer. Travel up the stairs and activate the switch, then pass through the newly opened gate. There will be a Dwarven Centurion that must be defeated, as it holds the key needed to proceed. A simple way to defeat the Centurion is to lean in the left part of the gate, and firing an arrow at the Centurion. As it comes close, it will try to fire steam at the Dragonborn. Go backward\u00a0until the Dragonborn is out of the steam's range, and fire arrows from there. The Fire Breath Shout is also effective with the same strategy, but arrows make the fight go faster. Another option is to walk back down the stairs. The Centurion will follow. Let it try to catch up around the round \"water well.\"\nA Frostbite spider will appear and start attacking the Centurion. Wait, and the spider will damage or destroy the Centurion. Next, proceed to the gate on the southwest where there will be two hostile adventurers, Sulla and Umanan, arguing. Engage or sneak past them to continue. If remaining concealed, they will eventually fight, leaving one survivor. Proceed to the Dwarven Mechanism and insert the Attunement Sphere. The floor will part, revealing stairs down to a hidden door and an entrance into the undercity of Blackreach.\nBlackreach.\nOne can exit Blackreach using the Dwarven Elevator just left of their location. There are several Dwarven Centurion along the road, but it is possible to avoid them. Dispatch or sneak by the Dwemer Sphere and the Falmer (a very easy way to dispose of the sphere is to activate the nearby crossbow before the sphere activates, as this kills it instantly), and follow the cobblestone path southeast to a button encased on a Dwarven head pedestal. Press it, and the elevator behind lights up, allowing access to the elevator to ascend and exit back outside. Open the gate to allow later entry from the Great Lift of Alftand.\nFollow the quest marker to the far southwest corner of the map. This will lead to the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Mzark\"&gt;Tower of Mzark&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Dragon%29\"&gt;the Scroll&lt;/a&gt; resides.\nOculory Operation.\nOnce inside the Tower of Mzark, one will come to a room with a number of alchemical ingredients and other items. The &lt;a href=\"Oculory\"&gt;Oculory&lt;/a&gt; is through the door on the far side of the room. Go up the spiral ramp. Near the top is a level area with desks, ruined books, and a door to an elevator to the surface. Near the door is a dead body, &lt;a href=\"Drokt\"&gt;Drokt&lt;/a&gt;. The \"&lt;a href=\"Journal%20of%20Drokt\"&gt;Journal of Drokt&lt;/a&gt;\"\u00a0is next to his skeletal remains.\nGo up the ramp above the elevator door to the controls. The controls consist of a Lexicon Receptacle and four positioning buttons embedded in pedestals.\nActivate the Lexicon Receptacle, so the &lt;a href=\"Blank%20Lexicon\"&gt;Blank Lexicon&lt;/a&gt; rests on top of it. The two pedestals to the Receptacle's left, the only ones currently active, open and close the Oculory lenses. Press the taller of the two pedestals (right of the pedestal with the lens chart on it in the middle of the buttons) until the pedestal with the blue button to the left of the middle one starts to glow. Move to this new pedestal (at this point, the Blank Lexicon may be glowing blue). The two pedestals to the left of the lens chart, the taller of which is now active, control the ceiling lens array. Press the button of the taller, left pedestal twice, until the button on the left of that (the smaller pedestal) begins to glow. Note, if the left button is pressed too many times, one may have to start over with the farthest right button pedestal (as a reset). Now press that button, and a large set of lens crystals descends from the ceiling and stops. The main crystal rotates and splits apart to reveal a tube-like carrying device, which contains the Elder Scroll.\nAcquiring the scroll completes this quest. Retrieve the Lexicon in order to continue \"Discerning the Transmundane\" to acquire the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Artifacts%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedric Artifact&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt; if the Dragonborn chooses to do so or continue with the main quest line."}

When the three alliances invaded Cyrodiil, each took two from the cult and built Elder Scroll Temples to house them.\nDescription.\nThere are three offensive scrolls and three defensive scrolls. Each alliance has one of each, housed in an Elder Scroll temple of the same name as the scroll within.\nUsage.\nAn Elder Scroll can be captured by picking it up from its pedestal and bringing it to one of the players' alliance's six home &lt;a href=\"fortifications\"&gt;fortifications&lt;/a&gt;. While carrying it, the player is visible on the Cyrodiil map to all players of all alliances. Additionally, the player carrying the Scroll has a distinctive aura that can be seen from afar, and they cannot use certain abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Bolt%20Escape\"&gt;Bolt Escape&lt;/a&gt;, nor can they use a mount.\nOnce placed, the Elder Scroll will confer a bonus to the entire alliance. Offensive scrolls provide bonuses to weapon and spell damage, while defensive scrolls provide bonuses to armor and spell resistance. They also provide a bonus to hourly gained points on the Alliance War leaderboard on certain campaigns.\nAn Elder Scroll can only be picked up by a player if that type of scroll is still housed in their Scroll Temple. For example, a Covenant player could not pick up the scrolls of Mnem or Chim if their own alliance's defensive Scroll, Alma Ruma, is in enemy hands, but could pick up those of Altadoon or Ghartok if their offensive Scroll, Ni-Mohk, was still in its Temple."}

{"id": "1703", "revid": "26893431", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1703", "title": "Elder Scrolls", "text": "The Elder Scrolls are artifacts of unknown origin and quantity, being simultaneously archives of historic, past and future events. They often tell of events that require a Hero to resolve them, although the Scrolls themselves do not select such individuals. They are also known as the \"Aedric Prophecies,\" suggesting that they may have been created by the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;, although this designation may be inaccurate. For most, the Elder Scrolls cannot be read without extreme side-effects, among which are blindness and insanity.\nThey are also the namesake for series.\nNature.\nThe Elder Scrolls are said to \"exceed both &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;,\" implying that neither group of &lt;a href=\"deities\"&gt;deities&lt;/a&gt; created them.\nUntil the events each Scroll describes comes to pass, they contain information about possible events in the future, with each viewing containing a possible version of events. Once a prophecy contained in an Elder Scroll is enacted in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, the text of the parchment becomes fixed. After that time, all readers ingest the same divine message, creating a historical document declaring the unequivocal truth of a past event. The contents of a scroll, once solidified, cannot be altered by any known magic.\nThe Scrolls have some relation to time, and offer a view through a fixed point in time to the flow to time itself. However, they appear to be dependent on the flow of time in order to function; events which alter the linearity of time, known as &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Breaks&lt;/a&gt;, cannot be recorded or predicted by the Elder Scrolls.\nDragons are the children of Akatosh, the time god. As such, they are uniquely attuned and vulnerable to the flow of Time, which may explain how an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Dragon%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt; could banish Alduin into the future by casting him adrift on the currents of Time, and create the &lt;a href=\"Time%20Wound\"&gt;Time Wound&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;location&lt;/a&gt; of his banishment.\nThe Elder Scrolls can affect all possible futures, and they can be used to bind entities to specific ones.\nReading an Elder Scroll.\nReading an Elder Scrolls correctly takes time, preparation and training. It is said that those with no ability see only unknown etchings and runes, often claiming to recognize constellations and birth signs. With increasing levels of knowledge a reader can gain insight, but also risks both their sight and their sanity.\nTrue insight into the divine contents comes at a price as each new foretelling and interpretation strikes the reader with blindness that gradually increases with each reading, while simultaneously granting them a broader view of the scroll's contents. Ultimately, the reader, having engaged in frequent acts of prophecy, is left bereft of their vision, forever after removed of their right to read the scrolls.\nBy time-honored tradition only those of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Ancestor%20Moth\"&gt;Cult of the Ancestor Moth&lt;/a&gt; may read from the scrolls, the younger members caring for the elder as they gradually lose their sight for eternity. The loss of sight for the reading of an Elder Scroll is described as \"a price,\" probably for the learning of what the Elder Scroll chooses to reveal to the reader. Some go insane from reading an Elder Scroll because it is too much knowledge for some to handle.\nThe Dwemer were so technologically advanced that they were able to develop a device, called a &lt;a href=\"Lexicon\"&gt;Lexicon&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed someone to read an Elder Scroll without going blind or insane.\nRitual of the Ancestor Moth.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20of%20the%20Ancestor%20Moth\"&gt;Ritual of the Ancestor Moth&lt;/a&gt; is a rite performed by &lt;a href=\"Moth%20Priest\"&gt;Moth Priest&lt;/a&gt;s in order to read an Elder Scroll. It usually takes place within one of the many secluded &lt;a href=\"Ancestor%20Glade\"&gt;Ancestor Glade&lt;/a&gt;s scattered across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Usually Moth Priests take months to prepare themselves for reading an Elder Scroll as only the most resilient of the Moth Priests can read an Elder Scroll with this ritual and it takes years to interpret the harmony. As such, only a few get the chance to perform this ritual.\nThe voice of the &lt;a href=\"Ancestor%20Moth%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Ancestor Moth&lt;/a&gt; has always been an integral part of reading an Elder Scroll. They maintain a connection to the ancient magic that allows a Moth Priest to decipher them. Moths within an Ancestor Glade emanate a soft harmonious trilling that when amplified tap into a form of primal augur. This allows the moths themselves to become a conduit for deciphering the scrolls. By having the moths close to the Moth Priest, they can utilize the conduit and share the moth's augury.\nThe ritual itself involves carefully removing &lt;a href=\"Canticle%20Bark\"&gt;the bark&lt;/a&gt; of a Canticle Tree with a traditional tool called a &lt;a href=\"draw%20knife\"&gt;draw knife&lt;/a&gt; which in turn attracts the Ancestor Moths. Once enough moths are in the vicinity, they grant the reader with the second sight needed to decipher the scroll.\nOpinions of the Scrolls.\nThe exact number of Elder Scrolls itself cannot be counted, as was proven by the Cult of the Ancestor Moth. Each attempt to quantify their number or even location causes the scrolls to change place and number, for no discernible reason.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; consider seeking and studying the Elder Scrolls to be a blasphemy.\nThe dragon Paarthurnax describes the scrolls as being \"artifacts that exist outside of time\" as well as \"fragments of creation.\"\nHistory.\nMerethic Era.\nTyranny of the Sun.\nDuring the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, the remaining\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0who had not been massacred by the &lt;a href=\"Atmorans\"&gt;Atmorans&lt;/a&gt; or had fled to the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; for help had fallen back to the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Vale\"&gt;Forgotten Vale&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0as a new safe haven for them. The Snow Elves who had gone to the Dwemer for help had been enslaved by them, and had been forced to ingest a toxic fungus which blinded them. Over time, those Snow Elves had evolved into the &lt;a href=\"Falmer\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, a large group of the Falmer had discovered the Forgotten Vale, and they began to massacre all of the Snow Elves in the Vale. Ironically, the genocide the Falmer were committing was against their own former brothers and sisters, who had not been affected by the actions of the Atmorans and Dwemer. Early before when one of the initiates came before &lt;a href=\"Arch-Curate%20Vyrthur\"&gt;Arch-Curate Vyrthur&lt;/a&gt; and bit him turning him into a vampire despite the fact that he was supposed to be protected by &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;. In revenge, Vyrthur created the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Tyranny%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;Tyranny of the Sun&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0prophecy foretold in three Elder Scrolls. In the end, Vyrthur and his brother,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Knight-Paladin%20Gelebor\"&gt;Knight-Paladin Gelebor&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0were the only known survivors of the attack, and the Tyranny of the Sun prophecy would continue to be unfulfilled until the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Clan\"&gt;Volkihar Clan&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0discovered the prophecy and began to uncover it.\nTime Wound.\nDuring the Merethic Era, Alduin led the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; in a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; against all of the people of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Atop the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tongues\"&gt;Tongues&lt;/a&gt;, three Nord heroes, fought against Alduin and his dragons. When Alduin arrived, the Tongues used the &lt;a href=\"Dragonrend\"&gt;Dragonrend&lt;/a&gt; shout to face him. After Alduin killed one of the Tongues and proved too strong for the heroes to defeat, the others decided to use an Elder Scroll to defeat him. Alduin was banished by the scroll, and returned to Skyrim in 4E 201. The usage of the Elder Scroll broke time and resulted in the formation of the Time Wound.\nSecond Era.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt;, the Elder Scrolls were an important aspect of the battles waged in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. The three factions would steal each other's scrolls back and forth, and as such power shifted between them. &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; prior to the &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt;, had begun studying with the Moth Priests and read the scrolls. He gained a significant amount of knowledge, but had soon lost his sight.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, a moth priestess known as &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Terran%20Arminus\"&gt;Sister Terran Arminus&lt;/a&gt; tasked the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; with retrieving an Elder Scroll from the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; in order for them to fulfill the prophecy written in the scroll.

Talk to her, and she will tell you that the Mages Guild tried to summon Atronachs to destroy the Proving Grounds Dolmen, but the Atronachs turned on the mages under the influence of one of the &lt;a href=\"Celestial\"&gt;Celestial&lt;/a&gt;s. She will ask you to investigate the site to find out what happened. \nHead to the Proving Grounds Dolmen, which is between the &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Overlook%20Wayshrine\"&gt;Mountain Overlook Wayshrine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chiselshriek%20Mine\"&gt;Chiselshriek Mine&lt;/a&gt;. Once you arrive there, the Thief will appear; speak with her and she will tell you that one of the mages, Kelmen Locke, survived the Atronach attack and is now being held captive at &lt;a href=\"Haddock%27s%20Market\"&gt;Haddock's Market&lt;/a&gt;, east of Belkarth. \nHead to Haddock's Market and proceed into the tower to find Kelmen Locke tied up. The Thief will ask him some questions, but he will refuse to answer her. Talk to him yourself; if you agree to free him, he will tell you how to find out why the atronachs turned on the mages. You will have to find the most ancient of the atronachs; they can be communicated with to some extent. They can be controlled using a Gem of Celestial Command that Kelmen Locke will give you, but they must be beaten first. \nThese atronach monarchs can be found throughout eastern Craglorn. the Flame Monarch Magdra Ibrai is in &lt;a href=\"Molavar\"&gt;Molavar&lt;/a&gt;, west of &lt;a href=\"Elinhir%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt;. You will find its lair in the southern part of the dungeon. The Storm Monarch's lair is not in a dungeon; it is located just northwest of the &lt;a href=\"Elinhir%20Wayshrine\"&gt;Elinhir Wayshrine&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, the Frost Monarch's lair can be found northeast of &lt;a href=\"Inazzur%27s%20Hold\"&gt;Inazzur's Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Once all three have been subdued, head to the site where the mages performed the ritual to summon the atronachs, just south of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt;. There, you will meet with Kelmen Locke again, who will instruct you to use the Gem on each of the crystals here to summon the atronachs. The atronachs will tell you that they serve &lt;a href=\"The%20Mage%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;the Mage&lt;/a&gt;, but that she has been corrupted by &lt;a href=\"The%20Serpent%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;the Serpent&lt;/a&gt;. the Serpent has used their power to create a new monarch, the Monarch of Air. He is located in &lt;a href=\"Balamath\"&gt;Balamath&lt;/a&gt;. \nSpeak with Kelmen Locke about this and he will tell you what the monarchs just told you. Balamath is located east of the &lt;a href=\"Fulminant%20Anomaly\"&gt;Fulminant Anomaly&lt;/a&gt;; head in and proceed to the west of the ruins. There, you will find the Air Monarch Parel Nirus in his own room; kill him, then head back out. You will find Kelmen talking to the Thief; talk to him afterward to finish the quest. "}

It can also speed up weapon skill training against unkillable targets.\nWhen dual wielding weapons, the shout's effect is applied to both hands. If an enchanted weapon is used in one hand, speed is only gained by the hand without an enchanted weapon.\nWhile dual wielding daggers, using the &lt;a href=\"Critical%20Charge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Critical Charge&lt;/a&gt; and Dual Flurry perks, this shout can be the fastest way to travel in Skyrim besides &lt;a href=\"Fast%20Travel%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fast travel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;console commands&lt;/a&gt;.

A single elemental resistance item of armor can make other races without a base elemental resistance incredibly hardy against it as well.\nNeedless to say, the benefit of having a shield is invaluable when fighting elemental &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt; as well. However, having the shield raised when approaching a mage may not be as effective as simply charging at them without other block perks.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; is equipped with enchanted apparel that reduces fire, frost and shock damage by 50%, blocking with a shield will potentially make you immune to all Destruction spells, since the enchanted apparel reduces the damage in half, and the Elemental Protection perk blocks the other half. However, elemental resistances can never be higher than 85%.\nCombining this perk along with the &lt;a href=\"Spellbreaker%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Spellbreaker&lt;/a&gt; shield renders not only almost all &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt; magic useless, but dragon breath attacks useless as well.

New Life, new roads, and all! I wonder if the Yokudans had an equivalent celebration, for it is the Yokudans I pay a visit:\nI quest for the &lt;a href=\"Hel%20Ra%20Citadel\"&gt;Hel Ra Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, a fabled fortress built by those vicious and mysterious ancestors of the Redguard. As the Ayleid ruins serve to my people as a window to my ancestors, so, too, do I expect the Citadel to teach me about Redguard culture.\nThey say no one has entered the Citadel in many lifetimes, though rumors of the cultural treasures waiting inside have reached my ears. I flush to think of them.\nSun's Dawn 3rd,\nAnd so I arrive! The roads of Tamriel are as treacherous as ever\u2014the wildlife especially. The &lt;a href=\"Welwas\"&gt;Welwas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt; are akin to my Bosmer cousins: fetid, petulant, and possessing of lethal denture. But at last I spy the stone spires of Yokudan architecture. The Citadel must be just up ahead.\nSun's Dawn 4th,\nI can barely keep the quill straight as I pen this, but, for the first time in what must be a millennia, the antechamber that precedes the Citadel has opened! I'll see to it that someone alerts the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Society\"&gt;Merethic Society&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Stargazers\"&gt;Stargazers&lt;/a&gt;\u2014all of Tamriel! Once I survey it, of course.\nOne of the many legends that surround Hel Ra Citadel claims the Yokudans used it as a training ground for their &lt;a href=\"Ansei\"&gt;Ansei&lt;/a&gt; (literally \"sword saints\")\u2014blade masters capable of dazzling feats. In myth, the Ansei required much meditation and training to form their &lt;a href=\"Shehai\"&gt;Shehai&lt;/a&gt;, supernatural blades constructed out of sheer force of will.\nI think the antechamber preceding the road to the Citadel gives credence to the story, as do the ancient weapons left on the dais here (and not a single one marred by rust\u2014perhaps a magical property of the chamber?) According to legend, Ansei wishing to earn the elite title of First Rank were required to give up their most treasured weapons and war materiel before undertaking the grueling initiation ritual. If they succeeded, they would no longer need conventional weapons.\nMy friends say I have spent too much time researching the Yokudans and that I should find a husband. I think they are envious of my magnificent brain.\nTerms:\nYokeda- Leader? Lord of war?\nHel Shira- Blade Noble?\nYarban- A measurement of time? Unsure. Archaeologist, not a bean counter.\nAnka-Ra- Former warrior? Old warrior?\nKotu- Weapon? Edge?\nSun's Dawn 5th,\nFascinating as the antechamber has proven to be, it's time I gleaned the Citadel itself. What could await me there? &lt;a href=\"Mirimdin%27s%20Ninth%20Blade\"&gt;Mirimdin's Ninth Blade&lt;/a&gt;? The Shehai of a First-Rank &lt;a href=\"Ansei\"&gt;Ansei&lt;/a&gt;? I carry no sword, but I shall leave my journal here, as the Ansei left their swords. Perhaps, like them, I'll find the means to form my own &lt;a href=\"Shehai\"&gt;Shehai&lt;/a&gt;."}

Once inside the dungeon of the castle, &lt;a href=\"Nirai\"&gt;Nirai&lt;/a&gt; closed the gate of the dungeon, trapping both Attrebus and Sul. Nirai had ordered Irinja to reveal where Elhul was, so that they could kill him. Unlike her father, she could not agree keeping Elhul alive.\nSul faced Elhul while Attrebus talked to Nirai. Attrebus heard Sul shouting, so he ran to aid him. Attrebus unsheathed &lt;a href=\"Flashing\"&gt;Flashing&lt;/a&gt; and fought Elhul. Elhul's skin was so hard that it did not break when Flashing hit him. Sul casted a spell that made Elhul break into pieces and dissolve. After Elhul was defeated once and for all, Attrebus wrapped sword in order to take it without going mad."}

He will ask you to help get into the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Contempt\"&gt;Court of Contempt&lt;/a&gt; and rescue his friends. \nTo dispel the barrier blocking your entry into the Court, you'll need to destroy three elemental crystals. You'll also need to collect the gate key to get inside. You can do these things in any order. For the Air Crystal, head into the ruins from the west, then turn south. Don't forget to pick up the skyskard just east of the crystal, behind the collapsed wall. The crystal will be in the tower, up a few stairs. The earth crystal is found on the southeastern end of the ruins, once again in a tower. Finally, you'll find the fire crystal in the west of the ruins, north of where you entered. Your last target is the gate key, which is in the northern section of the ruins, in the northwest. Take care though, as this area is guarded by quite a bit more daedra than the rest of the ruins and the chest containing the key is guarded by a powerful dremora called &lt;a href=\"Kyngogurth\"&gt;Kyngogurth&lt;/a&gt;. \nOnce you've destroyed the crystals and obtained the key, meet Malkur in front of the Hall of Judgment, in the eastern part of the ruins. Don't be alarmed by the flame atronachs; they are friendly. Speak with Malkur and he'll tell you that his companions have been given the death sentence, and are currently being held in the dungeons as the preparations for their execution are being made. Head inside and face off against &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Bogtro\"&gt;Magistrate Bogtro&lt;/a&gt;, then make your way into the holding cells. Grab the key from the pack on the table and rescue the prisoners, tell &lt;a href=\"Tarrami\"&gt;Tarrami&lt;/a&gt; that Malkur will cover their escape. Head outside, and you'll find that the way out of the hall has been blocked by a magical barrier. You will be set upon by several waves of daedra while the mages deal with the barrier. These can overwhelm you if you're not paying much attention, so take care. \nOnce the barrier has been dealt with, head out of the hall. You'll find that the daedra in the rest of the ruins are distracted by Malkur's flame atronachs, so you can leave safely. Outside the ruins, you'll find the mages standing by a portal to the &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20City\"&gt;Hollow City&lt;/a&gt;.

Who was the greatest master of all weaponry?\"\n\"I can't think of one greatest master of all weaponry,\" said Hallgerd. \"&lt;a href=\"Balaxes\"&gt;Balaxes&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Agia%20Nero\"&gt;Agia Nero&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; was the greatest wielder of a &lt;a href=\"Spear\"&gt;lance&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ernse%20Llervu\"&gt;Ernse Llervu&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Ashlands%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlands&lt;/a&gt; is the greatest master of the club I've ever seen. The greatest master of the katana is probably an &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; warlord we've never heard of.

But there are all sorts of great warriors of the modern eras. The &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Camoran Usurper&lt;/a&gt;? The &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;unknown hero&lt;/a&gt; who brought the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"We can't declare an unknown champion as the greatest warrior. What about &lt;a href=\"Nandor%20Beraid\"&gt;Nandor Beraid&lt;/a&gt;, the Empress &lt;a href=\"Katariah\"&gt;Katariah&lt;/a&gt;'s champion?\" suggested Xiomara. \"They said he could use any weapon ever invented.\"\n\"But what happened to him?\" smiled Garaz. \"He was drowned in the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; because he couldn't get his armor off. Call me overly particular, but I think the greatest warrior in the world should know how to take armor off.\"\n\"It's kinda hard to judge ability to wear armor as a skill,\" said Xiomara. \"Either you have basic functionality in a suit of armor or you don't.\"\n\"That's not true,\" said Hallgerd. \"There are masters in that as well, people who can do things while wearing armor better than we can out of armor. Have you ever heard of &lt;a href=\"Hlaalu%20Pasoroth\"&gt;Hlaalu Pasoroth&lt;/a&gt;, the King's great grandfather?\"\nXiomara and Garaz admitted that they had not.\n\"This was hundreds and hundreds of years ago, and Pasoroth was the ruler of a great estate which he had won by right of being the greatest warrior in the land. It's been said, and truly, that much of the House's current power is based on Pasoroth's earnings as a warrior. Every week he held games at his castle, pitting his skill against the champions of the neighboring estates, and every week, he won something.\nHis great skill wasn't in the use of weaponry, though he was decent enough with an axe and a &lt;a href=\"Long%20Blade\"&gt;long sword&lt;/a&gt;, but in his ability to move quickly and with great agility wearing a full suit of &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor\"&gt;heavy mail&lt;/a&gt;. There were some who said that he moved faster while wearing armor than he did out of it.\n\"Some months before this story begins, he had won the daughter of one of his neighbors, a beautiful creature named &lt;a href=\"Mena\"&gt;Mena&lt;/a&gt; who he had made his wife. He loved her very much, but he was intensely jealous, and with good reason. She wasn't very pleased with his husbandly skills, and the only reason Mena never strayed was because Pasoroth kept a close eye on her. She was, to put it kindly, naturally amorous and resentful of her position as a prize. Wherever he went, he always brought her with him. At the games, she was placed in a special box so that he could see her even while he competed.\n\"But his real competition though he didn't know it, was from a handsome young armorer he also had won at one of his competitions. Mena had noticed him, and the armorer, whose name was Taren, had certainly noticed her.\"\n\"This has all the makings of a dirty joke, Hallgerd,\" said Xiomara, with a smile.\n\"I swear that it's entirely true,\" said Hallgerd. \"The problem facing the lovers was, of course, that they could never be alone. Perhaps because of this, it became a burning obsession to both of them. Taren decided that the best time for them to consummate their love was during the games. Mena feigned illness, so she didn't have to stay in the box, but Pasoroth visited the sickroom every few minutes between fights, so Taren and Mena could never get together. The sound of Pasoroth's armor clunking up the stairs to visit his sick wife gave Taren the idea.\n\"He crafted his lord a new suit of armor, strong, and bright, and beautifully decorated. For his purposes, Taren rubbed the leg joints with luca dust so the more he sweated and the more he moved them, the more they'd get stick together. After a little while, Taren figured, Pasoroth wouldn't be able to walk very quickly, and wouldn't have enough time in between fights to visit his wife. But just in case, Taren also added bells to the legs which rung loudly when they moved, so the couple would be able to hear him coming in plenty of time.\n\"When the games commenced the following week, Mena feigned illness again and Taren presented his lord with the new armor. Pasoroth was delighted with it, as Taren hoped he would be, and donned it for his first fight, Taren then stole upstairs to Mena's bedchamber.\n\"All was silent outside as the two began to make love. Suddenly, Mena noticed a peculiar expression on Taren's face and before she had a chance to ask him about it, his head fell off at the neck. Pasoroth was standing behind him with his axe in hand.\"\n\"How did he get upstairs so quickly, with his leg joints gummed up? And didn't they hear the bells ringing?\" asked Garaz.\n\"Well, you see, when Pasoroth realized he couldn't walk on his legs very quickly, he walked on his hands.\"\n\"I don't believe it,\" laughed Xiomara.\n\"What happened next?\" asked Garaz. \"Did Pasoroth kill Mena also?\"\n\"No one knows exactly what happened next,\" said Hallgerd. \"Pasoroth didn't return for the next game, nor for the next. Finally, at the fourth game, he returned to fight, and Mena appeared in the box to watch. She didn't appear to be sick anymore. In fact, she was smiling and had a light flush to her face.\"\n\"They did it?\" cried Xiomara.\n\"I don't have all the salacious details, except that after the battle, it took ten squires thirteen hours to get Pasoroth's armor off because of all the luca dust mixed with sweat.\"\n\"I don't understand, you mean, he didn't take his armor off when they -- but how?\"\n\"Like I said,\" replied Hallgerd. \"This is a story about someone who was more agile and accomplished in his armor than out of it.\"\n\"Now, that's skill,\" said Garaz."}
