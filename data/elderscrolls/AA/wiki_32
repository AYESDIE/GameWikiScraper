As a boy, the village priests foresaw his destiny. He was to become a great warrior and leader, who would unite and lead the ten warring kings who ruled the Reach at the time. As the years passed, Red Eagle grew in power and influence and became a prosperous and well known leader.\nInvasion.\nAround 1E 1055, &lt;a href=\"Hestra\"&gt;Hestra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Empress&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, attempted an invasion of The Reach. The old kings resisted, but were either killed or bribed to fall under the banner of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, Hestra's legions arrived at Sundered Hills and envoys were sent to bargain for their surrender.\nRed Eagle refused to yield the freedom of his people, but the elders were afraid, cast him out, and accepted the Imperial yoke.\nResistance.\nDespite his expulsion from &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Hills\"&gt;Sundered Hills&lt;/a&gt;, Red Eagle still held great influence among his people. He gathered Reachmen loyal to himself and his belief that the Reach should be free from Imperial oppression. Together they formed a resistance and successfully carried out raids on the seemingly endless number of Imperial patrols and garrisons throughout The Reach.\nBriarheart.\nOne night Red Eagle was approached by a cloaked stranger who revealed herself to be a &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Hagraven&lt;/a&gt;. She offered him power, for a price. Red Eagle agreed to the pact and sacrificed his heart, his will and his humanity to become a &lt;a href=\"Briarheart\"&gt;Briarheart&lt;/a&gt;. The Reachmen are allied with &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not known if his deal was with the lord of discord specifically. Nevertheless, from that day forth, his was a spirit of vengeance; he was pitiless and beyond remorse. The Reachmen resistance grew in strength and numbers, and within two years Red Eagle managed to drive the Imperial Legions from The Reach.\nHestra's return.\nDespite Red Eagle's initial victory, Empress Hestra returned to The Reach with an army unlike any before. For two weeks Hestra's generals laid siege to Red Eagle's stronghold until he emerged, alone and robed in nothing but his &lt;a href=\"Red%20Eagle%27s%20Fury%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;flaming sword&lt;/a&gt;. It was said that he fought well into the night and slaughtered a thousand Imperials before he was slain. His kin buried his body in &lt;a href=\"Rebel%27s%20Cairn\"&gt;Rebel's Cairn&lt;/a&gt;, a hidden tomb deep within the rock.\nAccording to legend, he presented his legendary sword to his people, and swore an oath: Fight on, and when at last The Reach was free, his blade should be returned to his tomb so that he might rise and lead them again.\nLegacy.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, the descendants of the Reachmen, the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;, draw several parallels to the struggles of Red Eagle and his oppression under an occupying force. As such, many of them extol the teachings and practices of Red Eagle and look up to him as a paragon. Indeed, the &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Towers\"&gt;Sundered Towers&lt;/a&gt; became a stronghold for the Forsworn and Red Eagle's Fury was even wielded by their Briarheart leader. This leader was slain by the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; and the sword was claimed. It was then used to open Red Eagle's tomb and the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; Reachman was defeated. His sword then became Red Eagle's Bane.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Legend%20of%20Red%20Eagle%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Legend of Red Eagle&lt;/a&gt;.\nRed Eagle can be encountered in &lt;a href=\"Rebel%27s%20Cairn\"&gt;Rebel's Cairn&lt;/a&gt; at the conclusion of this quest, which is initiated by reading the book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Legend%20of%20Red%20Eagle%20%28Book%29\"&gt;The Legend of Red Eagle&lt;/a&gt;\".\nApproaching the coffin at the back of the room will cause Red Eagle to rise up along with four skeletal archers at different points around the room. He will typically appear as a leveled draugr boss, but may appear as a common &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon priest&lt;/a&gt; at higher levels.\nWalkthrough.\nRed Eagle wields a &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;unique&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20sword\"&gt;Nordic sword&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Red%20Eagle%27s%20Fury%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Red Eagle's Fury&lt;/a&gt;, but sometimes it can be a Honed &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Greatsword\"&gt;Nordic Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; of Burning. At higher levels (approx. 40), Red Eagle can be encountered as a dragon priest, though he will not drop a mask. Red Eagle uses the &lt;a href=\"shouts\"&gt;shouts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Disarm\"&gt;Disarm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt;. If the Dragonborn is having trouble defeating him, circling around his coffin and using a bow or spells to damage him may be useful. Unrelenting Force or &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Form\"&gt;Ice Form&lt;/a&gt; shouts can be used to knock him down, giving free rein to the Dragonborn to attack while Red Eagle is down. Another possibility is using a &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt;-type staff such as &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Fireballs\"&gt;Staff of Fireballs&lt;/a&gt;. Using it will make the battle a bit easier. &lt;a href=\"Summon%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Summons&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt; can be very useful as well, distracting Red Eagle or his skeletons.\nAn extremely effective way of defeating him is to back-track up the stairs, to the doorway of the secret door. Then use Unrelenting Force to throw him down the stairs, which will damage him quite a lot due to the height of the fall. Then run back and take back &lt;a href=\"Red%20Eagle%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Red Eagle's Bane&lt;/a&gt; from the altar which you put Red Eagle's Fury into. This action results in the door shutting in his face. He will be stuck down there, giving the Dragonborn time to recharge dragon shouts. The door can then be opened when needed to shout him back down again. Repeat until he is defeated. &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; magic and shouts can be used to seriously harm him, as &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; are weak to fire."}

The &lt;a href=\"volcano\"&gt;volcano&lt;/a&gt; is known to have erupted on two occasions, the first being in &lt;a href=\"1E%20688\"&gt;1E 688&lt;/a&gt;. Since, it has remained dormant until the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, following the crash of &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;. As of &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the volcano is still experiencing ongoing eruptions.\nHistory.\nDawn Era.\nNear the end of the creation process, as many of the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; began their exodus from &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, a smaller group chose to stay and forfeit their divine existence to give life to the planet. Among these was &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, the Aedra generally credited with devising the original plan for the mortal plane. According to &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i legend, the remaining &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; were furious with what they considered Lorkhan's trickery and tried to destroy him. However, the physical manifestation of Nirn, known as the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt; or \"Earth Bones,\" came from Lorkhan himself, and so his true destruction was impossible. Instead, &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;his heart&lt;/a&gt; was torn from him and cast to Tamriel, where the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; hoped it would never be found. Over the place where the heart landed, a vast mountain formed, which the many &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s of Tamriel call the Red Mountain.\nMerethic Era.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, the Aldmer left their home and traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; on Tamriel. One particular group of them, led by their prophet &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;, chose to split from the core population, and traveled across the continent to their new home which they named &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, these &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt;, now called &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;, were somewhat surprised to see that the caves and tunnels under Red Mountain were already inhabited. These inhabitants, also Mer, called themselves the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;. An uneasy peace was formed among these races, primarily motivated by their drive to keep the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; out of the land.\nFirst Era.\nSometime during the early &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, the Dwemer located &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan's Heart&lt;/a&gt; beneath Red Mountain and began trying to use its power to achieve godhood. The Chimer, driven by fear, attempted to stop their brethren--an act that quickly led to war. This vast war eventually ended with the complete disappearance of the Dwemer, the emergence of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, and Red Mountain's first known eruption in &lt;a href=\"1E%20668\"&gt;1E 668&lt;/a&gt; in an event called &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Death\"&gt;Sun's Death&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird Era.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Red Mountain via a secret passageway in &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;. There they found the eighth and final piece of the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; hid it.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, ash storms began around Red Mountain due to &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; was then tasked with defeating him. They went to the heart of the volcano and confronted Dagoth Ur. There they destroyed the Heart of Lorkhan and defeat Dagoth Ur and his minions.\nFourth Era.\nBy at least &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt; fell and caused Red Mountain to erupt once again, having nearly completely devastated all of Vvardenfell and Morrowind. This caused much of Vvardenfell to be covered in lava and destroyed many of the settlements. Solstheim was also affected as its southern half became ash and fire. Many unprecedented effects and aftershocks could be felt across Tamriel, and heart stones appeared along affected areas. As a result, most of Vvardenfell remains a volcanic wasteland, forcing many of its surviving residents to migrate into the nearby provinces of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, and to Skyrim through &lt;a href=\"Dunmeth%20Pass\"&gt;Dunmeth Pass&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"4E%2016\"&gt;4E 16&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim gave Solstheim to Morrowind for refugees of the eruption.\nClimate.\nFor centuries, the mountain spat ash into the air, covering most of northern Vvardenfell, which was aptly named the &lt;a href=\"Ashlands\"&gt;Ashlands&lt;/a&gt;. The rocky, cavernous foothills of the mountain dominate nearly three quarters of the island. Cooled, once constant, lava flows have created deep, smooth channels that are often used as roads by the &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt;. The land to both the north and east of the mountain is arid and barely habitable, all the way to the Padomaic Sea.\nNear the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, the climate around the volcano grew increasingly hostile. Violent ash storms began thundering down the mountain faces, blasting high winds and tons of ash at the nearby cities and settlements. The storms appeared to be partly magical in nature, as they would often corrupt wildlife, and even people, in their wake. These storms ended after another battle occurred in the caverns beneath the volcano. Among the most notable outcomes of this battle was that Red Mountain had reverted to, presumably, its pre-volcanic form. The area continued to be rocky and cavernous, but the ash storms and hard weather subsided.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%2005\"&gt;4E 05&lt;/a&gt; the mountain erupted causing Vvardenfell to be covered in lava and destroyed some of the settlements. Since then, the mountain remained dormant but still spews out ash and smoke as of &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;.\nReligious significance.\nRed Mountain holds different religious significance to the various factions on Morrowind.\nFor a brief period of time, a cult known as the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;Sixth House&lt;/a&gt;, led by a reanimated Dagoth Ur, used many of the long-abandoned Dwemer workshops beneath Red Mountain as their home. The members often spoke of the mountain as an animate object, which spoke to them in their dreams. In this sense, the mountain symbolized Dagoth Ur himself, attempting to control his subjects from within his undermountain prison.\nFor the Ashlanders, the mountain was viewed as a haunted place, containing the remnants of the hated Dwemer.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; taught that Red Mountain was a place of trials and great evil. The Tribunal themselves built a huge magical barrier, the Ghostfence, around the mountain to contain Dagoth Ur and his attacks on Morrowind. The Ghostfence became a religious symbol of the Tribunal itself, and was a popular pilgrimage destination."}

I always awake in a cold sweat.\nMy &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; companions smirk at me when I speak of it. They talk of the power of their great god &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, of his might and glory and magic. I know magic and I know of its end. Of its limits. What is their idol's limit? I fear to find out.\nRumors swirl around the mountain like the ashy wind. Legends. Myth. But I have walked across &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; once ruled.

There's something about seeing your god, about being his neighbor, that gives those in &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; a sense of entitlement. But what belief is to be had in what you can see? Faith is not given to what is provable in the world, but rather what can only be truly felt in your gut.\nStill, they tell me what they know. Of greedy Dark Elf hands which found the Heart, which used it for their own ends. A magical stone, some say, nothing more. What it was used for I do not know, or if it still exists. So goes legends of a true God, which goes beyond mere mortal flesh.\nSome say the Heart still lies beneath that great Red Tower, but my Dark Elf companions remain unusually silent on the matter. I hear stories of treasure hunters delving deep into the dark passages, of the screams that never reach the surface.\nI know in my heart that the great Red Mountain will never be defeated, will never give up its prize. Not until a true force of good emerges to claim it. Or, perhaps, a true force of evil."}

What farm girl hasn't dreamed of a life of adventure? And we started out with a cause and a purpose. Turmoil throughout the land had left our livelihoods shattered and our families in desperate straits. My family couldn't even afford to feed me, let alone care for my six brothers and sisters. So I left home with nothing but the clothes on my back and a rusty old sword that had belonged to my mother, and I went looking for the Red Rooks.\nOh, I had heard rumors about the Red Rooks. Simple trappers and farmers just like me who had had enough of the high-and-mighty nobles making life impossible for the common folk of the land. They had banded together to steal from the rich and give to the poor. At least, that's what the rumors told me. I couldn't wait to join them, to live a life of action and purpose.\nIt wasn't hard to hook up with a band of Red Rooks, and they welcomed me into their fold well enough. They gave me a uniform, and I felt a mix of pride and embarrassment as I put it on. I guess the Red Rook leaders want us to look like an army, but I couldn't help wondering if it was such a good idea to advertise our presence in such a bold and obvious manner. But who was I to second guess those who were older and far more experienced than I?\nThings were going fine for a while, although it seemed like we were robbing whoever was available and keeping whatever we earned for ourselves. Still, I was a valued member of the group and I had started to develop some strong friendships\u2014especially with Kala and Morin. We were becoming inseparable!\nJust when things were really looking good, I started to suspect that there was something more ominous at play than a bunch of farmers trying to be noble bandits.\nMy suspicions were confirmed when I saw our leaders meeting with those &lt;a href=\"Bloodthorn%20Cultist\"&gt;Bloodthorn maniacs&lt;/a&gt;. I hope we aren't really considering an alliance with the cultists. That's not what I signed on for! I want to have a little fun and earn some gold. I certainly don't want to see &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt; destroyed and covered in corrupted vegetation!\nNow I don't know what to do. Maybe I should talk to Kala and Morin. They'll know what we should do."}

It was created and led by &lt;a href=\"Torradan%20ap%20Dugal\"&gt;Torradan ap Dugal&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord of Pirates and &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;'s most powerful pirate king. The fleet was founded as a way for the various groups of pirates to take advantage of the chaos of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Usurper\"&gt;War of the Usurper&lt;/a&gt; to plunder riches beyond their wildest dreams.\nThe fleet fought in the &lt;a href=\"Pirate%20War\"&gt;Pirate War&lt;/a&gt; where it was defeated. Dugal and his flagship, the Black Flag, were buried alive after battlemages collapsed a cliff over them. The crew survived but died out after several months, and the rest of the Red Sabre scattered or were destroyed. In 4E an unknown thief found &lt;a href=\"Dunbarrow%20Cove%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Dunbarrow Cove&lt;/a&gt; and resurrected the Red Sabre. He recruited many pirates, spies, thieves, and blackmarket members and transformed the Red Sabre into a criminal organization that rivaled the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nWar of the Usurper.\nCaptain &lt;a href=\"Torradan%20ap%20Dugal\"&gt;Torradan ap Dugal&lt;/a&gt; was in &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; when the war against the Usurper broke out. He was out on hire with a rickety tub and her worthless rot of a captain when the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Navy&lt;/a&gt; stole every pirate ship in Anvil to go and fight in the war. Dugal and the crew were coming back to the ship when they heard about it. The captain was going to hand his ship over to the Navy. But the crew didn't like that.\nThey cut his throat and tossed his carcass into the water. The crew then stole the ship and made way to the nearest cove to lay low for a while.\nWhile the Navy was putting down the revolution, they were too busy to worry about a bunch of pirates running up and down the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;. And even better for Dugal, the Navy was needing a stream of supplies up in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; to fight and did not have the ships to escort them with.\nIn just a couple of years Dugal had every buccaneer from &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; flying under his flag. They had dozens of ships and crew and more men joined every day. The Red Sabre at the time was made up of soldiers, sailors, castoffs from the war, and escaped prisoners.\nBut even better than the men were the ships, captured navy cutters, and refitted privateer galleons. They even had a few of those &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; ships with the funny living sails in their fleet. The finest ship Dugal saved for himself. The &lt;a href=\"Black%20Flag\"&gt;Black Flag&lt;/a&gt; in that day could outrun and out fight any ship.\nThe Red Sabre got to be so feared that most crew just abandoned ship when they saw the flag of the Red Sabre on the horizon. With no navy to stop them, Captain Torradan ap Dugal and the Red Sabre was known all over the east.\nCaptain Dugal by this time had a bounty on him of forty thousand septims. Anvil being the wretched den it was, and since most of the sailors there worked for Dugal anyways, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; could not ever get anyone to give him up.\nPirate War.\nA couple of months after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Usurper\"&gt;War of the Usurper&lt;/a&gt;, Commodore &lt;a href=\"Fasil%20Umbranox\"&gt;Fasil Umbranox&lt;/a&gt; turned his attention to the Red Sabre. He decided to come down to &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; and took up port in Dugal's mainbase. The &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; gave him whatever he asked for to campaign against the Red Sabre, despite the treasury bring empty from the war in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Umbranox could not get what he needed from Dugal's men in Anvil, he set out looking all over the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Flag\"&gt;Black Flag&lt;/a&gt;. There are hundreds of islands in the Abecean, and he landed a crew on each one. He rooted out Dugal's men when he could find them, hung those who were not willing to go peacefully and jailed those who laid down arms.\nNo matter how many ships it cost him, Umbranox kept coming with more and more. The Red Sabre could not ever get ahead of him and could never mount a counterattack. It took Umbranox four years and a lot of ships, but he finally tracked Dugal down.\nUmbranox had his main force out of port following a lead that Dugal had planted. Dugal then set sail back to Anvil, hoping to catch Umbranox off guard, capture the boats he left behind, and fight him with his own ships in Anvil Bay, but Umbranox had his men in Anvil waiting there for Dugal.\nThe Red Sabre fought bravely, but they were trapped in the bay. The Legion set Anvil on fire to keep the pirates from fleeing on to land.\nThe main force of Imperial ships held the Red Sabre until Umbranox showed up in his flagship. Umbranox fought Dugal to the last ship and in the end, the Bay was filled with sunken and burning ships. So the Black Flag and Umbranox's flagship were the only ones still floating and fighting when dawn came. So then Dugal tried to run.\nThe Black Flag cut across the south side of the bay, along the huge cliff wall that used to be there. Dugal had his helmsman stay as close as he could to the cliff. The mages from Umbranox's ship yelled something into the wind. A few rocks fell onto the Black Flag's deck, a few more, and then the whole cliff came crashing down ontop of the last ship of the Red Sabre.\nDeath of Dugal and his crew.\nDugal and his crew were trapped in &lt;a href=\"Dunbarrow%20Cove%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Dunbarrow Cove&lt;/a&gt;, never to see the light again. They tried digging out. They tried blasting out. They even tried calling out to the nine and the Daedric princes for help. They made the remains of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Flag\"&gt;Black Flag&lt;/a&gt; into the best home they could, accepting their fate.\nThey had plenty of stores with them and since most of the crew was killed in the fight, it was more than enough to go around. Then a sailor named &lt;a href=\"Grim\"&gt;Grim&lt;/a&gt; died off. Grim was the first and one by one, the other crew members began to die. They all got the same sickness. The survivors buried them when they could, and threw them in the water when they didn't have enough strength to bury them. Then Dugal caught the sickness and died as well.\nReformation.\nFor the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; the Red Sabre remained destroyed and Dunbarrow Cove was never found. But then later in the 1st year of the Fourth Era, rumors began circulating about Dunbarrow Cove. An unknown thief heard the rumors and decided to make good on them. He found the cove, and drew thieves, spies, criminals, blackmarket members, and pirates to him, and the Red Sabre was rebuilt. It was not until later in the same year that the Red Sabre truly became known again. The events around the reformation are confusing, namely because of the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. The unknown thief turned the Red Sabre into a criminal organization that rivaled the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; in size and scope.\nRanks within the Red Sabre.\nLord Captain.\nAt the head of the Red Sabre hierarchy is the Lord Captain, Torradan ap Dugal, and later the unknown thief. The Lord Captain gives orders directly to his members. The Lord Captain gets his own cabin in Dunbarrow Cove.\nFirst Mate.\nBelow the Lord Captain are the First Mates, who are basically lieutenants who carry out the orders of the Lord Captain. They are given command if a Lord Captain is killed and choose the next Lord Captain.\nMidshipmen.\nThe midshipmen are basically in charge of just different areas of the organization when the unknown thief was in control, but during Dugal's reign, midshipmen were basically quartermasters.\nSmuggler.\nThe smugglers help the organization move any stolen goods that its members pick up on their travels.\nBlack Market Fletcher.\nThe Black Market Fletchers provide members of the organization with marksmen supplies and training that they won't be able to find elsewhere.\nHousebreaker.\nThe housebreakers train the crew in the subtle art of security and provide members with specialty training and items that will make it possible for them to slip in and out of any place they want to go.\nSpymaster.\nThe spymasters train the members in the subtle art of sneaking and assassination. They also provide information for the Lord Captain.\nSupplier.\nThe suppliers can get all manner of things that are difficult to find in Cyrodiil, but never reveal their sources.\nBases.\nDunbarrow Cove.\n&lt;a href=\"Dunbarrow%20Cove%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Dunbarrow Cove&lt;/a&gt; is a cave located behind and under &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Anvil\"&gt;Castle Anvil&lt;/a&gt;. The first section of the cove is called &lt;a href=\"Smuggler%27s%20Cave\"&gt;Smuggler's Cave&lt;/a&gt; and contains some crates, barrels, and chests. The lower passage leads to Dunbarrow Cove itself, while the upper passage leads to a secret passageway in Castle Anvil and ends up in the Umbranox private bedchambers.\nDunbarrow Cove houses the remains of the infamous &lt;a href=\"Black%20Flag\"&gt;Black Flag&lt;/a&gt; and becomes a base for the reformed Red Sabre after it has been cleared of Red Sabre Skeletons."}

The first zone, Red Scar Cavern, starts off with a cave that includes a waterfall and several &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn%20Guard%20%28Skyrim%20Creation%20Club%29\"&gt;Mythic Dawn Guards&lt;/a&gt; patrolling about. They are not hostile if the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; is wearing the same outfit. If attacked or not wearing the uniform, they are unarmored, wearing cloaks and hoods and rely primarily on spell casting for offence. At the north end of the cave is a tunnel that leads to a mine with more guards, six &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ore%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron ore veins&lt;/a&gt; iron ore nodes and two &lt;a href=\"Quicksilver%20Ore%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;quicksilver veins&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the northwest corner of the mine is a locked door that leads to the Mythic Dawn Temple. This locked can be bypassed by using the &lt;a href=\"Keys%20%28Skyrim%20Creation%20Club%29\"&gt;Mythic Dawn Chamber Key&lt;/a&gt; pickpocketed or looted from the last guard before the door.\nMythic Dawn Temple.\nThe temple consists of a single large cavern with mining scaffolding on either side. Immediately west of the entrance is an altar with a levelled weapon on it. Straight ahead beyond the altar is an &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20gate\"&gt;Oblivion gate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vonos\"&gt;Vonos&lt;/a&gt; is standing in front of the gate with his back turned to the entrance. While better armored than the guards, he is still lightly armored, so a sneak archery attack has a decent shot of taking him down depending on the Dragonborn's level and skill perks. There are also two other guards here. Killing Vonos ends The Cause and immediately begins The Consequences.\nOn Vonos' body is his journal explaining what was done at previous locations, his plans and how the Dragonborn fits into those plans as an unwitting agent of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;. Reading it unlocks the Oblivion gate.\nOn return from Oblivion, both sublocations will be respawned with &lt;a href=\"Vigilants%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Vigilants of Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; fighting Mythic Dawn Guards and there will be a few &lt;a href=\"Spiddal%20Stick%20%28Skyrim%20Creation%20Club%29\"&gt;spiddal stick&lt;/a&gt; plants in the temple itself. Oddly, in the cavern, Vigilants will have taken over as miners."}

When the last member of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, the warrior-poet &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, mysteriously disappeared, the power that kept the meteor &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt; floating over the city of Vivec began to diminish over time. In order to keep the moon from crashing down, a device known as the &lt;a href=\"Ingenium\"&gt;Ingenium&lt;/a&gt; kept it afloat. After the device was destroyed, Baar Dau fell from the sky and crashed into &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;. This resulted in a chain reaction of events that caused &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; to erupt, laying waste to Vvardenfell and covering a large portion of Morrowind in ash, with many Dunmer dying in the carnage or losing their homes.\nHistory.\nPrelude.\nShortly after the founding of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; tricked the meteor &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt; to change its course through &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; and head towards the city in response to the blasphemy of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, as he believed &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; built the city in a mockery of the heavens. In response, Vivec merely lifted his hand, immediately causing Baar Dau to freeze in place above the city. Vivec left the meteor to remain frozen above the city, so that if the people ever stopped loving him, the force keeping the meteor at bay would also stop. Baar Dau was later mined out and became the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt;, where it would remain in place for centuries.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, Vivec mysteriously disappeared, and much of the faith and love the people had for him diminished. Some followers of &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; were warned of the impending eruption by the goddess' prophecies, and fled west to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. In order to keep the Ministry afloat and prevent it from crashing into Vivec City, two Dunmer, named &lt;a href=\"Ezhmaar%20Sul\"&gt;Ezhmaar Sul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vuhon\"&gt;Vuhon&lt;/a&gt;, made a deal with &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt; for a device known as the &lt;a href=\"Ingenium\"&gt;Ingenium&lt;/a&gt;, which would keep the Baar Dau suspended in the sky without the need for Vivec. In return, the Ingenium would need to be powered by souls to keep it running. Initially, only the souls of outlaws, prisoners, and other undesirables were sacrificed for the Ingenium. Eventually, citizens were needed to be used as a source as well. The Ingenium was powered for five years until the wife of Sul, &lt;a href=\"Ilzheven\"&gt;Ilzheven&lt;/a&gt;, was about to be sacrificed. Sul attempted to save his wife, but the result ended up inevitably destroying the Ingenium. Without anything holding it up, Baar Dau began to fall towards the ground.\nThe Eruption.\nBaar Dau collided into the very heart of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, wiping it out completely. This caused the Red Mountain to erupt, devastating cities such as &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gnisis\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;, and regions like &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Amur\"&gt;Molag Amur&lt;/a&gt; being diminished to ash. The devastation was not limited to Vvardenfell, as even some parts of the mainland, like &lt;a href=\"Tear\"&gt;Tear&lt;/a&gt;, suffered from continuous earthquakes and floods caused by the eruption. A month later, a &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; councilor, who was living in &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, which was spared from the destruction, issued relief efforts to the ruined island. Vvardenfell was later on the road of recovery, where some of the settlements had been rebuilt over the years.\nAftermath.\nFollowing the eruption, Morrowind became less habitable, and even the air was difficult to breathe in. Two hundred years after the event, the waters in the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; still remained too tainted with ash for fish to live in them. Mysterious compounds known as &lt;a href=\"Heart%20Stone\"&gt;Heart Stone&lt;/a&gt;s and violent creatures called &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Spawn\"&gt;Ash Spawn&lt;/a&gt;s also arose from debris spread by the eruption. The &lt;a href=\"Silt%20Strider\"&gt;Silt Strider&lt;/a&gt; species was nearly wiped out, as many of them were native to Vvardenfell. Many Dunmer fled to &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, which had its climate drastically changed in the southern areas, and was later given to Morrowind by the High King of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%2016\"&gt;4E 16&lt;/a&gt;. Others decided to settle in Skyrim, mainly in &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%206\"&gt;4E 6&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; took advantage of Morrowind's weakened state, and launched &lt;a href=\"Accession%20War\"&gt;an invasion&lt;/a&gt; as revenge for centuries of &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt; under the Dunmer, killing hundreds of innocents. Under the command of the &lt;a href=\"An-Xileel\"&gt;An-Xileel&lt;/a&gt;, they captured territories in southern Morrowind, but were then halted by the armies of &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;. The Argonians cursed the waters near the ruins of Vivec City forever, turning it into a boiling hot area known as &lt;a href=\"Scathing%20Bay\"&gt;Scathing Bay&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt; flew over Morrowind in &lt;a href=\"4E%2040\"&gt;4E 40&lt;/a&gt;, it resurrected the bodies of the many Red Year victims buried in the waters of the Inner Sea as zombies. &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; lost their status as one of Morrowind's &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt;, and they were removed from the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Council\"&gt;Grand Council&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Collapse\"&gt;The Great Collapse&lt;/a&gt;, which occurred in &lt;a href=\"4E%20122\"&gt;4E 122&lt;/a&gt; and had destroyed large portions of Winterhold, resulting in the deaths of many civilians, is suspected to be caused by late-term aftershocks from the eruption of Red Mountain. Many of the locals, however, disagree, and blame the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; for the Great Collapse."}

Their swordmasters, though, were so skilled in the Best Known Cuts as to be matched evenly. Leki introduced the &lt;a href=\"Ephemeral%20Feint\"&gt;Ephemeral Feint&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, a victor emerged and the war against the elves began.\n&lt;a href=\"Malooc\"&gt;Malooc&lt;/a&gt;.\n(Horde King): An enemy god of the &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt;. Led the goblins against the Redguards during the first era. Fled east when the army of the HoonDing overtook his goblin hordes.\n&lt;a href=\"Morwha\"&gt;Morwha&lt;/a&gt;.\n(Teat God): Yokudan fertility goddess. A fundamental deity in the Yokudan pantheon, and the favorite of Tall Papa's wives. Still worshipped in various areas of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;. Morwha is always portrayed as four-armed so that she can \"grab more husbands.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Onsi\"&gt;Onsi&lt;/a&gt;.\n(Boneshaver): Notable warrior god of the Yokudan &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt;, Onsi taught Mankind how to pull their knives into swords.\n&lt;a href=\"Ruptga\"&gt;Ruptga&lt;/a&gt;.\n(Tall Papa): Chief deity of the Yokudan pantheon. Ruptga, more commonly 'Tall Papa', was the first god to figure out how to survive the hunger of &lt;a href=\"Satakal\"&gt;Satakal&lt;/a&gt;. Following his lead, the other gods learned the 'Walkabout', or a process by which they can persist beyond one lifetime. Tall Papa set the stars in the sky to show lesser spirits how to do this, too. When there were too many spirits to keep track of, though, Ruptga created a helper out the dead skin of past worlds. This helper is Sep (see below), who later creates the world of mortals.\n&lt;a href=\"Satakal\"&gt;Satakal&lt;/a&gt;.\n(The Worldskin): Yokudan god of everything. A fusion of the concepts of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, Satakal is much like the Nordic &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, who destroys one world to begin the next. In Yokudan mythology, Satakal had done (and still does) this many times over, a cycle which prompted the birth of spirits that could survive the transition. These spirits ultimately become the Yokudan pantheon. Popular god of the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r\"&gt;Alik'r&lt;/a&gt; nomads.\n&lt;a href=\"Sep\"&gt;Sep&lt;/a&gt;.\n(The Snake): Yokudan version of &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;. Sep is born when &lt;a href=\"Ruptga\"&gt;Tall Papa&lt;/a&gt; creates someone to help him regulate the spirit trade. Sep, though, is driven crazy by the hunger of &lt;a href=\"Satakal\"&gt;Satakal&lt;/a&gt;, and he convinces some of the gods to help him make an easier alternative to the Walkabout. This, of course, is the world as we know it, and the spirits who followed Sep become trapped here, to live out their lives as mortals. Sep is punished by Tall Papa for his transgressions, but his hunger lives on as a void in the stars, a 'non-space' that tries to upset mortal entry into the Far Shores.\n&lt;a href=\"Tava\"&gt;Tava&lt;/a&gt;.\n(Bird God): &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;n spirit of the air and goddess of the weather who \"has dominion over all elements of sun and storm.\" Tava is most famous for leading the Yokudans to the &lt;a href=\"Herne%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;isle of Herne&lt;/a&gt; after the destruction of their homeland. She has since become assimilated into the mythology of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;. She is still very popular in Hammerfell among sailors, and her shrines can be found in most port cities.\n&lt;a href=\"Tu%27whacca\"&gt;Tu'whacca&lt;/a&gt;.\n(Tricky God): Yokudan god of souls. Tu'whacca, before the creation of the world, was the god of nothingness. When Tall Papa undertook the creation of the Walkabout, Tu'whacca found a purpose; he became the caretaker of the Far Shores and continues to help Redguards find their way into the afterlife. His cult is sometimes associated with &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt; in the more cosmopolitan regions of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Zeht\"&gt;Zeht&lt;/a&gt;.\n(God of Farms): Yokudan god of agriculture. Renounced his father after the world was created, which is why Tall Papa makes it so hard to grow food.\nZeqqi.\n(Madonna of Tears): Yokudan water goddess and daughter of Zeht. Although Zeht forsakes the desert land she takes pity on those who live there."}

{"id": "1449", "revid": "35838578", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1449", "title": "Redguards", "text": "The Redguards are a race of &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; who hail from the lost continent of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; and now reside primarily in the province of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. While officially Yokudans, they acquired their current name through the corruption of the native Yokudan term \"&lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt;,\" which (loosely translated) means \"&lt;a href=\"warrior%20wave\"&gt;warrior wave&lt;/a&gt;.\" Due to their swift and decisive conquest of Hammerfell, the Redguards are renowned as the most naturally gifted &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20%28Class%29\"&gt;warriors&lt;/a&gt; in Tamriel. Their ferocity and versatility is also manifested in their personality, which lends itself to why they are most effective as &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s and in small units as opposed to being deployed as rank and file soldiers. They are masterful smiths, and are capable of making armor out of enchanted porcelain.\nHammerfell.\nHammerfell is an arid land consisting mostly of jungles, deserts, mountains, and grasslands. The &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt; takes up the northwestern corner of Hammerfell, and is widely regarded as the most inhospitable region in all of Tamriel. The &lt;a href=\"Banthan\"&gt;Banthan&lt;/a&gt; Jungle is much more lively in comparison. Until the coming of the Ra Gada in the ninth century of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, the deserts were populated only by monstrous beasts, including &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Scorpion\"&gt;giant scorpions&lt;/a&gt;. While the fauna of the Alik'r Desert remained deadly into the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, the Redguards had managed to significantly reduce the presence and threat of those creatures. The Alik'r Desert is also the home to ruins of countless civilizations that had perished beneath its sands. Its blazing heat, ferocious sandstorms, and lack of water, makes it nearly impossible to survive in the Alik'r Desert. The desert was inhabited only by the nomadic Redguards.\nPhysiology.\nThe Redguards' innate agility and high level of endurance allows them to excel in any activity that demands sustained effort, most notably &lt;a href=\"combat\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt;. They are generally average in height, with a well-muscled and sturdy physique. They possess a hardy constitution which allows them to resist &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;. In appearance, the Redguards' skin tone can range from light brown to black, while their hair texture ranges from thick and wavy to tightly curled and wiry.\nHistory.\nFirst Era.\nRedguards are former inhabitants of the continent to the west, &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;. Around &lt;a href=\"1E%20792\"&gt;1E 792&lt;/a&gt;, much of Yokuda sank into the ocean after a group of &lt;a href=\"Sword-Singers\"&gt;Ansei&lt;/a&gt; called the Hiradirge sought revenge on the land after their defeat in battle. The surviving Yokudans sailed to the east and settled in &lt;a href=\"Volenfell\"&gt;Volenfell&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; name for the region), what would later be known as &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. Most of these refugees would stay on the island of &lt;a href=\"Herne%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Herne&lt;/a&gt;, but a group of warrior Yokudans known as the &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the mainland in 1E 808 and swept across the country to claim as much land as they could, slaughtering or enslaving the local &lt;a href=\"beastfolk\"&gt;beastfolk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; tribes. Eventually, Yokudan royalty known as Na-Totambu left the island of Herne and made their place in Hammerfell after the Ra Gada drove off the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;. The name \"Redguard\" originates from \"Ra Gada.\"\nAt first, this newcomer race did not open up to the rest of Tamrielic culture. They kept their Yokudan language intact and refused to trade with neighboring societies. Only when the Redguards and the &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; found a common enemy in the Orcs of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; did they begin open trade with High Rock. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20950\"&gt;1E 950&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Siege of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; began with an outcome of Redguard and Breton victory. Their language was eventually replaced because of the need to easily communicate with trading partners and create treaties, but the language was still spoken by some.\nSecond Era.\nOver time, Redguard society split into two factions, &lt;a href=\"the%20Crowns\"&gt;the Crowns&lt;/a&gt;, who followed the royal Na-Totambu and strove to hold onto traditional Yokudan culture, and &lt;a href=\"the%20Forebears\"&gt;the Forebears&lt;/a&gt;, descendants of the Ra Gada who wished to fully assimilate into Tamriel for the purposes of commerce and politics. A civil war soon broke out and in &lt;a href=\"2E%20864\"&gt;2E 864&lt;/a&gt;, the Redguard king &lt;a href=\"Thassad%20II\"&gt;Thassad II&lt;/a&gt; was killed. His son, &lt;a href=\"A%27Tor\"&gt;A'Tor&lt;/a&gt;, would go on to lead the Crowns' effort, but ultimately the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; backed Forebears won. Hammerfell was absorbed by the Septim Empire, although some concessions were made after a successful revolt in &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;. Redguard society remained split for a vast amount of time, with the northern parts of Hammerfell keeping with Yokudan traditions, dress, and personality, and the southern parts tending to be more open to the rest of Tamrielic culture.\nThird Era.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20249\"&gt;3E 249&lt;/a&gt;, a pretender to the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran throne&lt;/a&gt;, called the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Camoran Usurper&lt;/a&gt;, freed &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt; control. After gaining control over Valenwood, the Camoran Usurper marched northward seizing control of any land he could conquer. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20253\"&gt;3E 253&lt;/a&gt;, the Redguard cities &lt;a href=\"Rihad\"&gt;Rihad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taneth\"&gt;Taneth&lt;/a&gt; sent a call for help to &lt;a href=\"Elinhir\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt; to the north that went unanswered because of the tension that still existed between the Crowns and the Forebears. Later, because of this, Forebear cities would not aid Crown cities that were overrun by Nords during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Bend%27r-Mahk\"&gt;War of Bend'r-Mahk&lt;/a&gt; around the time of 3E 397. The reign of the Camoran Usurper ended in 3E 267 after his defeat.\nRedguards of eastern Hammerfell held a grudge against the Nords of Skyrim and continued to try to regain land lost during the War of Bend'r-Mahk throughout the end of the Third Era, but to no avail.\nThe &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Betony\"&gt;War of Betony&lt;/a&gt;, a land dispute over the island of &lt;a href=\"Betony\"&gt;Betony&lt;/a&gt; between the Bretons of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; and the Redguards of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, saw the death of the King of Sentinel, &lt;a href=\"Camaron\"&gt;Camaron&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20403\"&gt;3E 403&lt;/a&gt;. The aftermath of the war left tension between the Redguards and Bretons of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; area.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;The Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; occurred.\nFourth Era.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20171\"&gt;4E 171&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; broke out when Emperor &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt; refused to cede large tracts of land including southern Hammerfell to the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; won and the Empire gave over the rights to occupy parts of Tamriel to the Aldmeri Dominion as part of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20175\"&gt;4E 175&lt;/a&gt;. The Redguards of Hammerfell, however, refused to accept this and fought on against the Thalmor. After years of bloodshed, they were successful in their repulsion of the Dominion's invasion, and in &lt;a href=\"4E%20180\"&gt;4E 180&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Second Treaty of Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt; was signed to end the fighting between the Redguards and the Dominion. After the treaty was signed, the Thalmor forces withdrew from Hammerfell. Many Redguards remained bitter toward the Empire for what they considered a betrayal, and claimed that their victory was proof that the Concordat was a mistake and the Empire would have eventually won if it had kept fighting.\nCulture.\nThe Redguard (or \"Yokudan\") culture is martial by nature. Every man, woman and child is schooled in the art of war and combat from a very young age. This would explain why they have never truly been defeated by any invading force since their arrival in Tamriel. From &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; to the Aldmeri Dominion, none have been able to completely assimilate the Redguards, much less defeat them outright. Despite the schism in their culture that produced the Crown and Forebear factions, the Redguards of Hammerfell have proven time and again that they are more than capable of putting their differences aside for the sake of their lives and culture. Redguards have an affinity towards horses with breeds such as the yokudan charger. \nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Trayvond%20the%20Redguard\"&gt;Trayvond the Redguard&lt;/a&gt;, in Hammerfell, they \"Don't much like spellcasters, because Wizards &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Trap\"&gt;steal souls&lt;/a&gt; and tamper with minds. If you use &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, you're weak or wicked.\" They particularly hate &lt;a href=\"Conjuration\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt;, relating it to &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illusion\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; because it tampers with the mind. However, he does mention that he and other Redguards are fond of &lt;a href=\"Destruction\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"spells\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; which suits their culture well. They also believe that no true redguard will stoop down to magic. The constellation of the warrior is held in high regard, having three charges: the lord, the lady, the steed. most Redguard holidays and traditions center around great warriors.\nRedguard clothing is diverse, differing by which district they hail from. however they share one common appearance: they tend to be light, long and flowing to tolerate the desert's heat. This style has also been carried into their weaponry. This form of dress was first developed in yokuda. It is claimed that the redguards of rihad go about naked. The people roaming the Alik'r favor lightweight leather clothing and face coverings to cope with the harsh climate.\nReligion.\nThe main religion of Hammerfell is primarily based in the traditional &lt;a href=\"Redguard%20Pantheon\"&gt;Yokudan pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, though there are pockets of those who've embraced the gods of Tamriel."}

The traditional rule of &lt;a href=\"emperor\"&gt;emperor&lt;/a&gt;s had been overthrown in &lt;a href=\"1E%20376\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;, and although each successive emperor remained the figurehead of the empire, his powers were very much reduced. Since that time, our people saw three hundred years of almost continuous civil war between the provincial lords, warrior monks, and brigands, all fighting each other for land and power. Our people were once artisans, poets, and scholars, but the ever-evolving strife made the way of the sword inevitable. The song of the blade through the air, through flesh and bone, its ring against armor\u2014it was an answer to our prayers.\nIn the time of Lord Frandar the first Warrior Prince, lords called &lt;a href=\"Yokeda\"&gt;Yokeda&lt;/a&gt; built huge stone castles to protect themselves and their lands, and castle towns outside the walls begin to grow up. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20609\"&gt;2245&lt;/a&gt;, however, &lt;a href=\"Mansel%20Sesnit\"&gt;Mansel Sesnit&lt;/a&gt; came to the fore. He became the Elden Yokeda, or military dictator, and for eight years succeeded in gaining control of almost the whole empire. When Sesnit was assassinated in &lt;a href=\"1E%20617\"&gt;2253&lt;/a&gt;,a commoner took over the government. &lt;a href=\"Randic%20Torn\"&gt;Randic Torn&lt;/a&gt; continued the work of unifying the empire that Sesnit had begun, ruthlessly putting down any traces of insurrection. He revived the old gulf between the warriors\u2014the &lt;a href=\"sword%20singers\"&gt;sword singers&lt;/a&gt; \u2014and the commoners by introducing restrictions on the wearing of swords. \"&lt;a href=\"Torn%27s%20Sword-Hunt\"&gt;Torn's Sword-Hunt&lt;/a&gt;,\" as it was known, meant that only the singers were allowed to wear swords, which distinguished them from the rest of the population.\nAlthough Torn did much to settle the empire into its pre-strife ways, by the time of his death in &lt;a href=\"1E%20737\"&gt;2373&lt;/a&gt; internal disturbances still had not been completely eliminated.

The greatest among them became known as &lt;a href=\"Ansei\"&gt;Ansei&lt;/a&gt;, or \"Saints of the Sword.\" Each of these began their own training schools teaching their individual way of the sword. Ansei of the highest virtue wandered the countryside engaging in battle, righting wrongs, and seeking to end the strife.\nTo sum it up: Hunding was a sword-singer, a master, a Master Ansei at a time when the peak of the strife was reborn out of the chaos of Torn's death.

Others, like Hunding, pursued the ideal of the warrior searching for enlightenment through the perilous paths of the Sword.

His grandfather was a retainer of the Elden &lt;a href=\"Yokeda\"&gt;Yokeda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mansel%20Sesnit\"&gt;Mansel Sesnit&lt;/a&gt;, and led many of the battles of unification prior to Sesnit's assassination.\nWhen he was 14, Hunding's father died in the one of the many insurrections, and he was left to support his mother and four brothers. His prowess with the sword, however, made his life both difficult and easy. It was easy in that his services came in great demand as a guardian and escort. It was hard in that his reputation preceded him, and many awaited their turn to face him in battle, hoping to gain instant fame through his defeat.\nBy the time Hunding was thirty, he had fought and won more than ninety duels, killing all his opponents. He became virtually invincible with the sword, gaining such skill and mastery that he finally stopped using the real swords created through the artistry of his people and began using the Shehai or \"way of the spirit sword.\"\nAll &lt;a href=\"sword-singers\"&gt;sword-singers&lt;/a&gt; learn through their intense training and devotion to the gods of war and way of the sword, the forms of discipline that allow the creation of the spirit sword. This is a simple form of magic or mind mastery whereby an image of a sword is formed from pure thought. The sword singer forms the sword by concentrating, and it takes shape in his hand. It is usually a pale thing of light, misty and insubstantial, a thing of beauty perhaps, or a symbol of devotion to the Way and the gods, but no weapon. However, those Ansei of the highest level and sensitivity and those with talent in magic can in times of stress form a spirit sword: a Shehai that is far more than light and air. It is an unstoppable weapon of great might, a weapon that can never be taken from the owner without also taking his mind.\nThe Shehai became Hunding's weapon, and with this, he killed bands of brigands and wandering monsters infesting the land. Finally upon finishing his ninetieth duel, defeating the evil &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Janic\"&gt;Lord Janic&lt;/a&gt; and his seven lich followers, he was satisfied that he was indeed invincible. Hunding then turned to formulating his philosophy of \"the Way of the Sword.\" He wrote his learnings down in the Book of Circles while living as a hermit in a cave in the mountains of the high desert in his sixtieth year.\nIn that year Hunding, having enlisted in the many battles of the empire, and having defeated all opponents, had thought himself ready for death. He retired to his cave to capture his strategy and mystical visions to share with other sword-singers. It was after his completion of the scroll of the Circle that the singers found him composing his death poem and preparing to join the gods of war in final rest.\nAt sixty, he was a vigorous man who thought himself through with life, but his people, the sword-singers, needed him. They needed him as never before."}

Hunding called his plan the \"Hammer and the Anvil.\" With each battle Hunding's Singers would further learn his strategies and tactics, grow strong in the use of the Shehai, and be ready to defeat their opponents in the seventh battle.

Hunding knew that the singers who lived would be few, but Hira and his empire of evil would not live\u2014and so it went.\nAt the end Hunding and less that twenty thousand singers survived the day, but no army of evil was left to pillage and murder\u2014more than three hundred thousand fell that day on Hattu. Of those who were left to run and live, all were scattered to the four winds, an organized force no more.\nThe singers packed their lives, folded their tents, mourned their dead, and followed Hunding to the great port city of &lt;a href=\"Arch\"&gt;Arch&lt;/a&gt;, in the province of &lt;a href=\"Seawind\"&gt;Seawind&lt;/a&gt;.

Red, red with blood they were in the eyes of the gentle citizenry, never mind that they had saved them from a great evil.\nThe singers vowed to learn new ways as they traveled across the great ocean to their new land. To adopt a new name, but to honor the past. In honor of their final battle, they named their new land &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and adopted the name &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn honor to Hunding the great warrior prince, each household in Hammerfell has a place by the hearth, an alcove really, just a niche, big enough to hold the scroll: The Book of Circles."}

The traditional rule of emperors had been overthrown in 2012, and although each successive emperor remained the figurehead of the &lt;a href=\"Yokudan%20Empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt;, his powers were very much reduced. Since that time, our people saw 300 years of almost continuous civil war between the provincial lords, warrior monks and brigands, all fighting each other for land and power. Our people once were artisans, poets, and scholars, but the ever evolving strife made the way the sword inevitable - the song of the blade through the air, through flesh and bone, its ring against armor: an answer to our prayers.\nIn the time of Lord Frandar the first Warrior Prince, lords called &lt;a href=\"Yokeda\"&gt;Yokeda&lt;/a&gt; built huge stone castles to protect themselves and their lands, and castle towns outside the walls begin to grow up. In 2245, however, &lt;a href=\"Mansel%20Sesnit\"&gt;Mansel Sesnit&lt;/a&gt; came to the fore. He became the Elden Yokeda, or military dictator, and for eight years succeeded in gaining control of almost the whole empire. When Sesnit was assassinated in 2253,a commoner took over the government. &lt;a href=\"Randic%20Torn\"&gt;Randic Torn&lt;/a&gt; continued the work of unifying the Empire which Sesnit had begun, ruthlessly putting down any traces of insurrection. He revived the old gulf between the warriors - the &lt;a href=\"sword%20singers\"&gt;sword singers&lt;/a&gt; - and the commoners by introducing restrictions on the wearing of swords. \"Torn's Sword-hunt,\" as it was known, meant that only the singers were allowed to wear swords, which distinguished them from the rest of the population.\nAlthough Torn did much to settle the empire into its pre-strife ways, by the time of his death in 2373 internal disturbances still had not been completely eliminated. Upon his death, civil war broke out in earnest; war that made the prior 300 year turmoil pale in comparison. It was in this period that Frandar Hunding grew up.\nHunding belonged to the sword-singers. This element of empire society grew from the desert artisans and was initially recruited from the young sons and daughters of the high families. They built the first temple to the unknown gods of War and build a training hall \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Hall%20of%20the%20Virtues%20of%20War\"&gt;The Hall of the Virtues of War&lt;/a&gt;.\" Within a few generations the way of the sword - the song of the blade - had become their life. The people of the blade kept their poetry and artisanship in building beautiful swords woven with magic and powers from the unknown gods. The greatest among them became known as &lt;a href=\"Ansei\"&gt;Ansei&lt;/a&gt; or \"Saints of the Sword.\" Each of these began their own training schools teaching their individual way of the sword. Those Ansei of the highest virtue wandered the country side engaging in battle, righting wrongs, and seeking to end the strife.\nTo sum it up. Hunding, was a sword-singer, a master, no, a Master Ansei at a time when the peak of the strife was reborn out of the chaos of Torn's death. Many singers put up their swords and became artists, for the pull of the artisan heritage was strong; but others, like Hunding pursued the ideal of the warrior searching for enlightenment through the perilous paths of the Sword.

They are naturally distrustful of magic, especially &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt;.\nRogue.\nBecause of their bonuses to &lt;a href=\"Athletics%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Athletics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blade\"&gt;Blade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Light Armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mercantile%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mercantile&lt;/a&gt;, Redguards make excellent Rogues. Due to their high Strength, they are able to carry a lot of loot, which will help the player to make more money, and a high endurance permits them to not fully rely on Light Armor to cope with heavy damage. Depending on the playstyle you like to use, you will have to choose whether you want your character to be male or female. A male character allows for more Strength, and will be stronger in combat. Female characters on the other hand, will grant the player a higher &lt;a href=\"Personality%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Personality&lt;/a&gt;, which allows them to buy and sell items for better prices, and helps the player to develop the merchant aspect of the Rogue class. This goes to show that even though Redguards are generally considered to be one-sided, they can be very versatile with the right perks.\nBarbarian.\nRedguards also make decent &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Barbarians&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0due to their racial bonuses to Strength, Blade, &lt;a href=\"Blunt\"&gt;Blunt&lt;/a&gt;, Light Armor, and Athletics, but they do suffer from the lack of boosts to &lt;a href=\"Block%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Armorer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Armorer&lt;/a&gt;, and female Redguards do not get a Strength bonus at all.\u00a0Their racial ability &lt;a href=\"Adrenaline%20Rush%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Adrenaline Rush&lt;/a&gt; makes up for these weaknesses to a certain degree, because it temporarily buffs the Redguard's Strength, Endurance, &lt;a href=\"Agility%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Agility&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;, and, the Barbarian's most valuable tool: &lt;a href=\"Speed%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Speed&lt;/a&gt;. This allows a Redguard Barbarian to charge into combat and quickly dispatch any foes who stand in his way."}

They are descended from a long line of &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20%28Class%29\"&gt;warriors&lt;/a&gt; and mystic seers. Legend has it that Redguards are innately more proficient with the use of &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weaponry&lt;/a&gt; than any other &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;. They excel in all arts concerning &lt;a href=\"Swords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;blade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe most naturally talented warriors in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, the Redguards of Hammerfell seem born to battle. However, their pride and fierce independence of spirit makes them more suitable as &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s or skirmishers, or as free ranging heroes and adventurers, than as rank and file soldiers. In addition to their cultural affinities for many weapon and &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; styles, Redguards are also blessed with hardy constitutions and fleetness of foot.\nHistory.\nFourth Era.\nHammerfell, the Redguard's homeland, had recently survived a massive invasion by the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. Though they were aided by the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the following peace treaty gave a large chunk of the region to the elves. The Redguards refused to accept those terms, and succeeded in reclaiming their homeland from the Dominion, which lead to the separation of Hammerfell from the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Empire\"&gt;Mede Empire&lt;/a&gt; as an independent nation. There is now distrust between the Redguards and the &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is interesting to note that the Redguards pushed back the &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; armies twice before, and would have dominated Tamriel if not for the opposition in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; during the Empire's formation. With the signing of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Second Treaty of Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20180\"&gt;4E 180&lt;/a&gt;, the Aldmeri Dominion completely withdrew from Hammerfell. This makes Hammerfell the only country to have actually defeated the Aldmeri Dominion, and this largely without the aid of the Empire. The history of Hammerfell was filled with war until finally, because of forced cooperation between &lt;a href=\"The%20Forebears\"&gt;Forebears&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Crowns\"&gt;Crowns&lt;/a&gt;, the civil war in Hammerfell has ended, which is likely to lead to a prosperous future.\nReligion and culture.\nThe main religion of Hammerfell is a mix between ancestor worship and faith in the traditional &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;n pantheon. According to &lt;a href=\"Trayvond%20the%20Redguard\"&gt;Trayvond the Redguard&lt;/a&gt;, in Hammerfell, they \"don't much like spell casters, because Wizards steal souls and tamper with minds. If you use magic, you're weak or wicked.\" They are not fond of &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt;, relating it to &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt;, because it unwillingly alters the mind of an opponent. However, he does mention that he and other Redguards are rather fond of &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; spells, as that school of magic suits their culture well.\nPopular usage and unique gameplay.\nAs in previous \"Elder Scrolls\" games, the Redguards excel in &lt;a href=\"Combat%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt;. In , unlike previous games, they are more magically inclined than Nords or &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;. With Orcs as a possible exception, they make for the best defensive fighters due to having the best starting skill in &lt;a href=\"One-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;One-Handed&lt;/a&gt; in addition to their skill in &lt;a href=\"Block%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt;. Their poison resistance helps to withstand deadly biological agents of any kind, while the &lt;a href=\"Adrenaline%20Rush%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Adrenaline Rush&lt;/a&gt; ability allows for a continuous offensive onslaught. The fact that they also favor &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; alongside their traditional warrior abilities makes Redguards a great choice for a spellsword or battlemage.\nNaming convention.\nMost Redguard names in are based on Arabic names, such as Nazir (\"observer\"). This is a departure from previous installments in which Redguard names were commonly of western European origins."}

The dog can be killed in one hit, so using a bow is advised. The archer is a low-level bandit, so he is relatively simple to defeat. Killing this bandit will not alert the other bandits in the cave. The bandit protects a chest, as well as some &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo the left of the bandit is a passageway that leads down to the main chamber of the Retreat, where a bandit is patrolling while the &lt;a href=\"bandit%20chief\"&gt;bandit chief&lt;/a&gt; works at the far side of the room. The easiest way to deal with the bandit is by an arrow, and this will alert the chief.\nAlternatively, if the Dragonborn is at a low level and unable to handle the bandit chief, they can attempt to &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt; past the patrolling bandit and go for the chest with the quest item. Wait for the bandit to move far to the left, where they will walk into some bones on a string (making a noise). Start sneaking to the right and hide in the shadowed nook against the wall. Wait again for the bandit to come back and move away again. Now, sneak forward to the chest and grab the loot. From this point, it is probably not necessary to sneak any more: just run for the exit, avoiding the bandit chief. They will not follow the Dragonborn out of the cave.\nIf the chief searches for the Dragonborn, they will hold position where they lose the trail (when the Dragonborn is hidden again); if this is a chokepoint on the map, getting to the treasure unhindered may become impossible.\nOutside of the cave, on top of the rock formation that the door is fitted into, is an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ore%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron ore&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ore%20Veins%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vein&lt;/a&gt;."}

Then you are a heretic, as the Temple says, and you can expect no welcome from House Redoran.\"\nIn Ald'ruhn, the Nerevarine will go to &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn-under-Skar\"&gt;Under-Skar&lt;/a&gt; to find the councilors. The first person met in the Council Hall Entrance is Neminda, who will advise to speak with Athyn Sarethi and give the book \"&lt;a href=\"Red%20Book%20of%203E%20426\"&gt;Red Book of 3E 426&lt;/a&gt;\" which lists the name of all councilors and their location.\nAthyn Sarethi.\nAthyn Sarethi, a council member of the Great House of Redoran, can be found in the Sarethi Manor in the Manor district of Ald'ruhn. To gain his support, the Nerevarine must rescue his son, &lt;a href=\"Varvur%20Sarethi\"&gt;Varvur Sarethi&lt;/a&gt;, from the Venim Manor and return him to his father (provided the Nerevarine has not already done so during the House Redoran quest line). Varvur is incarcerated in a room with a locked door, hidden behind a tapestry. The key is on a bench with a note, taking the key will cause the guards to attack the Nerevarine. Once Varvur has been returned, Athyn Sarethi will grant his support and speak to the Nerevarine about the other Council members. If Varvur dies at any point during this quest, the Nerevarine will be unable to gain Sarethi's support, and the Main Quest will become impossible to complete.\nRedoran Council Members.\nHaving gained the vote of Athyn Sarethi the Nerevarine must then obtain the other votes from the other members of the Redoran Council. This can be accomplished simply by talking to them inside their Manor's within Ald'ruhn (apart from &lt;a href=\"Brara%20Morvayn\"&gt;Brara Morvayn&lt;/a&gt;, who can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn%20Council%20Club\"&gt;Ald'ruhn Council Hall&lt;/a&gt;). The Council members include &lt;a href=\"Miner%20Arobar\"&gt;Miner Arobar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garisa%20Llethri\"&gt;Garisa Llethri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hlaren%20Ramoran\"&gt;Hlaren Ramoran&lt;/a&gt; and Brara Morvayn.\nDuel with Bolvyn Venim.\nOnce the other Council Members have been spoken to, the Nerevarine must, then, speak to Bolvyn Venim, Archmaster of the House of Redoran. Venim, however, will refuse to give his support to the Nerevarine and instead challenges them to a duel. The duel itself is held in the Arena in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;. Venim is a tough opponent, wielding a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Dai-katana%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Daedric Dai-katana&lt;/a&gt; and wearing (mostly) ebony armor.\u00a0\nFollowing the defeat of Bolvyn Venim, the Nerevarine must return to Athyn Sarethi to be named Hortator of House Redoran and receive the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Hortator\"&gt;Ring of the Hortator&lt;/a&gt;. Sarethi will also give the Nerevarine a sealed package containing a &lt;a href=\"Note%20from%20the%20Archcanon\"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Archcanon\"&gt;Archcanon&lt;/a&gt;."}

The quest will begin once the Nerevarine has spoken with &lt;a href=\"Galsa%20Gindu\"&gt;Galsa Gindu&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\n\"Galsa Gindu told me that in order to build my stronghold, I must pay 5000 gold and get a construction contract from Duke Dren in Ebonheart.\"\nWalkthrough.\nTo begin the quest, the Nerevarine must have first reached the rank of Kinsman in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20House\"&gt;Great House&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Redoran&lt;/a&gt;. At this point the quest givers and council members of Redoran will tell the Nerevarine that to progress further in the House they must build their own Stronghold. They suggest speaking to Galsa Gindu in Ald'ruhn to get the ball rolling on the Nerevarine's Stronghold.\nPhase I.\nSpeaking to Gindu reveals the basic requirements for the project. The Nerevarine must hand her a Construction Contract from &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Vedam%20Dren%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Duke Vedam Dren&lt;/a&gt; (in &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;) and 5,000 gold to start the construction of the Stronghold at &lt;a href=\"Bal%20Isra\"&gt;Bal Isra&lt;/a&gt;. Duke Dren will require the Nerevarine to swear that they will aid the people of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; at any cost before handing over the Construction Contract. Having acquired these items, the Nerevarine must hand them to Gindu so that building can begin.\nAfter a few days have passed Gindu will request that the Nerevarine travel to Bal Isra to check on the progress of the Stronghold. The forman at the site, &lt;a href=\"Bugdul%20gro-Kharbush\"&gt;Bugdul gro-Kharbush&lt;/a&gt;, will tell the Nerevarine that the project is on target for completion within the next week. Having informed Gindu of this information, the first phase of the Nerevarine's Stronghold should be completed a few days later.\nPhase II.\nThe next phase of the build requires that the Nerevarine find some guards to protect the Stronghold. Gindu suggests speaking to the local &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; leader, &lt;a href=\"Percius%20Mercius\"&gt;Percius Mercius&lt;/a&gt;, to find some guards. Mercius agrees, on principle, to give the Nerevarine some guards, although the Nerevarine must first rescue his friend &lt;a href=\"Frelene%20Acques\"&gt;Frelene Acques&lt;/a&gt;. Acques has been captured by &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; and is currently being held in the prison in the Treasury in the &lt;a href=\"Vivec%2C%20Hlaalu%20Canton\"&gt;Hlaalu Canton&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;. Once the Nerevarine has rescued Acques, a grateful Mercius will agree to send the guards.\nHaving solved the issue of guarding the Stronghold, the Nerevarine may return to Gindu to begin the construction of the second phase of the Stronghold. This should be completed a few days later.\nPhase III.\nPhase III can only begin once the Nerevarine has reached the rank of House Father in Redoran. Gindu suggests that you speak to &lt;a href=\"Hetman%20Guls\"&gt;Hetman Guls&lt;/a&gt; at the site to find out what the people of Bal Isra require next. Guls states that the men around the Stronghold site are worried that they will not be able to find wives, so it is up to the Nerevarine to solve this issue.\nWomen for Bal Isra.\nThe Nerevarine has a number of different ways available to them to solve this pressing issue. One method is to speak with &lt;a href=\"Fathusa%20Girethi\"&gt;Fathusa Girethi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aryni%20Orethi\"&gt;Aryni Orethi&lt;/a&gt; (at the &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Skar%20Inn\"&gt;Ald Skar Inn&lt;/a&gt; and outside her Ald'ruhn home respectively) whom will agree to join the Stronghold's population if their &lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt; is above 90.\nA second method is to buy two slaves from &lt;a href=\"Savile%20Imayn\"&gt;Savile Imayn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt; (1,000 gold each), although an alternative to this is open to the Nerevarine if they have freed 21 slaves (and become entwined with &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Lamps\"&gt;Twin Lamps&lt;/a&gt;). In this case the Nerevarine may speak to &lt;a href=\"Galyn%20Arvel\"&gt;Galyn Arvel&lt;/a&gt; whom will agree to send two former slaves from &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Velothi%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ald Velothi&lt;/a&gt;.\nA final method of attracting women to the site is to head to &lt;a href=\"Suran\"&gt;Suran&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically the Nerevarine should head to &lt;a href=\"Helviane%20Desele\"&gt;Helviane Desele's&lt;/a&gt; \"establishment\" in the town, where she inform the Nerevarine (if her disposition is above 70) that a couple of her dancers are ready to retire. Having followed one of the above methods the Nerevarine may return to Gindu.\nCompleting the Stronghold.\nHaving arranged for the women to arrive at the site with Hetman Guls (whom will be most pleased with the Nerevarine's work), Gindu will order the final construction phase of the Stronghold to begin. A few days later the final phase of construction will be complete and the Stronghold at Bal Isra will be finished."}

However, they were forced inside the ruin by a storm. J'darr began to go into withdrawal, and the other party members believed him responsible for the disappearance of the mage, Valie. As written in J'zhar's journal:\n\"I've run out of the little skooma I brought and J'darr is getting pretty bad. He's started hallucinating creatures coming out of the ice and the ruins, the others are starting to think he may be behind Valie's disappearance, but I know he would never do something like that.\"\nHowever, in spite of his Skooma withdrawal, the 'hallucinations' are implied to (in part) be the &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; who inhabit the ruins, and it is in fact the Falmer who took Valie. J'darr and his brother are apparently the only two of the group to avoid the Falmer's grasp, but it is unclear whether J'darr killed J'zhar or if the latter died from unrecorded wounds.\u00a0\nJ'darr can be heard shouting at his brother when first entering Alftand, and later talking to his brother when he sees the player:\n\"\"Where is it? I know you are trying to keep it for your self, J'zhar... You always try to keep it for yourself! No! There's got to be more Skooma... Shut up! Shut up! Don't lie to me, J'zhar! You hid it! You always try to hide it from me!\"\n\"[seeing player] What? Who is this, brother? Another of the smoothskins looking for food? But this one wasn't trapped with us...\""}

I'm supposed to test out Flame Cloak scrolls he made, and report back to him when I've tried them out on several undead creatures.\"\nWalkthrough.\nTalk to J'zargo after the Dragonborn has completed \"&lt;a href=\"Under%20Saarthal\"&gt;Under Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;\" and agree to help with his experiment, he will then proceed to explain how he needs the Dragonborn to test his scrolls. J'zargo's scrolls must be used in melee range of undead; they will last for thirty seconds, and kill undead almost instantly. Furthermore, due to the potency of these scrolls, the undead explode and damage everyone nearby upon exploding.\nA somewhat convenient place to test the scrolls is &lt;a href=\"The%20Midden\"&gt;The Midden&lt;/a&gt;, which is located in the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Skytemple%20Ruins\"&gt;Skytemple Ruins&lt;/a&gt; just north of the College, though keep in mind any underground barrow or other ruin is just as appropriate provided &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; are present. A &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt; lair may also work, due to the overwhelming abundance of undead enemies. This is a decent quest to undertake while the Dragonborn is seeking out a &lt;a href=\"Word%20of%20Power\"&gt;Word of Power&lt;/a&gt;, or in conjunction with a \"find an item\" quest.\nUnfortunately, the scrolls do not quite work correctly; they not only hurt the undead, they also hurt the Dragonborn and any &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce complete, the Dragonborn can return to J'zargo for a reward, and also gets to keep the leftover scrolls, unless all were used. Additionally, he becomes available as a follower. The scrolls are not considered quest items and can be accidentally stored; in which case they will disappear (after some time) and the quest will fail."}

He is a potential &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; and is eligible to become a member of the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;. When not accompanying the Dragonborn, he can be found at the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; either in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Attainment\"&gt;Hall of Attainment&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Hall of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality.\nA skilled mage, J'zargo is confident to the point of arrogance, offering few words of praise for the work of others. He is highly competitive and strives to be the best of the College's students, using any means available, including theft and reckless experimentation. Despite his great ambition, he has no qualms accepting that he still has a long way to go before becoming a powerful wizard.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Lessons\"&gt;First Lessons&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlong with &lt;a href=\"Onmund\"&gt;Onmund&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brelyna%20Maryon\"&gt;Brelyna Maryon&lt;/a&gt;, he criticizes &lt;a href=\"Tolfdir\"&gt;Tolfdir&lt;/a&gt; for not teaching them enough magic during their first meeting, though depending on how the Dragonborn responds when Tolfdir asks them for their opinion, J'zargo or one of the others will respond accordingly.\n&lt;a href=\"Under%20Saarthal\"&gt;Under Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe accompanies the &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt; excavation along with &lt;a href=\"Onmund\"&gt;Onmund&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tolfdir\"&gt;Tolfdir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brelyna%20Maryon\"&gt;Brelyna Maryon&lt;/a&gt;. He is tasked with checking to make sure they are the first arrivals and that no tombs have been tampered with.\n&lt;a href=\"J%27zargo%27s%20Experiment\"&gt;J'zargo's Experiment&lt;/a&gt;.\nAgreeing to help J'zargo experiment with a batch of &lt;a href=\"J%27zargo%27s%20Flame%20Cloak%20Scroll\"&gt;scrolls&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; uses them on &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; as instructed. Serving as a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Cloak\"&gt;Flame Cloak&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;, the scrolls deal extra damage to undead creatures, but upon coming into contact with undead also cause an explosion that damages the Dragonborn and any followers, which can cause the follower to turn on the Dragonborn. Reporting to J'zargo the results of the experiment opens him up as a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt;. Afterward, he will ask the Dragonborn to test later iterations of the scrolls, eventually resulting in a working version.\nCombat.\nHe is equipped with non removable &lt;a href=\"novice%20robes\"&gt;novice robes&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"novice%20hood\"&gt;novice hood&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Hunting%20Bow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;hunting bow&lt;/a&gt;. However, if he is hired as a follower and provided with other armor, should he equip the new armor, it is possible to pickpocket the default one after dismissing him.\nJ'zargo equips one-handed weapons, heavy armor, and light armor if they are given to him, but in combat, he tends to use dual cast destruction spells until his magicka runs out. He favors &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shock&lt;/a&gt; spells. Despite being a mage, he has an unusually high skill in heavy armor as well as one-handed weaponry. Giving him the &lt;a href=\"Nahkriin%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;Nahkriin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Zahkriisos%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;Zahkriisos&lt;/a&gt; mask may be helpful. (Zahkriisos can only be obtained if the &lt;a href=\"Official%20Add-ons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;add-on&lt;/a&gt; is installed.) The former in general allows him to cast more spells, while the latter can significantly increase his damage output at higher levels.\nWhile in &lt;a href=\"Combat%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt; with higher level foes, he appears to use more powerful versions of the normal spells that he uses, or a spell crafted for him; that gives an appearance as a normal destruction class spell. For example, when fighting dragons on adept difficulty or lower, he will do a significant amount of damage, often killing the dragon before the Dragonborn has the chance to inflict notable damage.\nWhile in prolonged combat, he may run out of magicka and will use his fists regardless of any weapon or &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; the Dragonborn gave him. While he does equip such items, &lt;a href=\"Dual%20Wielding\"&gt;dual-cast&lt;/a&gt; Sparks is equipped as soon as a combat is started. When he regenerates magicka after fist fighting for a few seconds, he will start casting fireball spells. At a long distance in the open, he will use Ice Spikes as his preferred spell.\nWhile in combat with melee opponents, he will hold out for himself very well, backing up as he is casting rather than standing still; placing him in top tier heavy armor only improves his combat usefulness. However, he will not survive for long while fighting other mage class foes that cast magic.\nJ'zargo will always use a unique dagger like the Blade of Woe or Mehrunes Razor if it is given to him. He will also always use any bow with a lightning enchantment instead of his default hunting bow.\nJ'zargo's health is high and regenerates fast, giving the Dragonborn no need to heal him during combat. This is a reason for J'zargo's state as one of the most durable followers. It should be noted that unlike most other followers, he levels with the Dragonborn all the way to level 81 until patch 1.9, and he has no level cap after the patch. His only weakness is that he favors low level shock spells, hindering his damage performance.\nSpells and perks.\nJ'zargo knows a total of thirteen spells, but will only cast nine as a follower, and the others as a regular character in combat. Spells marked with an asterisk are the only spells he will use as a follower. Whether this is a bug or scripted behavior is unknown.\nDialogue.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Lessons\"&gt;First Lessons&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"You are new, yes? Have you mastered the Expert level destruction spells yet?\"\n(Or, at a lower level of skill and not owning the spells:\n&lt;a href=\"Under%20Saarthal\"&gt;Under Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"You know, there might be gold somewhere in here.\"\n(If approached again:\n\"J'zargo finds nothing but dust in these ruins.\"\n\"Do you think there's treasure here? Something to make J'zargo a powerful wizard?\"\nConversations.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Lessons\"&gt;First Lessons&lt;/a&gt;.\nTolfdir: \"Welcome, welcome! We were just beginning. Please, stay and listen. So, as I was saying, the first thing to understand is that magic is, by its very nature, volatile and dangerous. Unless you can control it, it can and will destroy you.\"\nBrelyna: \"Sir, I think we all understand that fairly well. We wouldn't be here if we couldn't control magic!\"\nTolfdir: \"Of course, my dear. Of course. You all certainly possess some inherent natural ability. That much is not being questioned. What I'm talking about is true control, mastery of magic. It takes years, if not decades, of practice and study.\"\nJ'zargo: \"Then what are we waiting for? Let's get started!\"\nTolfdir: \"Please, please! This is exactly what I'm talking about. Eagerness must be tempered with caution, or else disaster is inevitable.\"\nOnmund: \"But we've only just arrived here -- you've no idea what any of us are capable of. Why not give us a chance to show you what we can do?\"\nOnmund: \"We're all pretty new to this, right? Let's just give it a chance. What's the worst that could happen?\"\nTolfdir: \"All right, let's settle down. I suppose we can try something practical... In continuing with our theme of safety, we'll start with Wards. Wards are protective spells that block magic. I'll teach you all a ward, and we'll see if you can successfully use it to block spells, all right?\"\nBrelyna: \"See? agrees with us too! Why don't you actually show us something?\"\nTolfdir: \"All right, let's settle down. I suppose we can try something practical... In continuing with our theme of safety, we'll start with Wards. Wards are protective spells that block magic. I'll teach you all a ward, and we'll see if you can successfully use it to block spells, all right?\"\nJ'zargo: \"Oh, don't listen to . We can do it, just give us a chance!\"\nTolfdir: \"All right, let's settle down. I suppose we can try something practical... In continuing with our theme of safety, we'll start with Wards. Wards are protective spells that block magic. I'll teach you all a ward, and we'll see if you can successfully use it to block spells, all right?\"\nTolfdir: \"Well, I think this is an excellent start. I'd like you all to continue practicing with wards, please. I think perhaps we're ready to begin exploring some of the various applications of magic throughout history. The College has undertaken a fascinating excavation in the ruins of Saarthal nearby. It's an excellent learning opportunity. I suggest we meet there in a few hours and see what awaits us inside. That's all for now, thank you.\""}

He is said to be a mix of &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly other blood. After months of plotting, Tharn used the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; to trap Septim in &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Plane of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; out of jealousy and desire for the throne, and copied his look by using &lt;a href=\"Illusion\"&gt;Illusion magic&lt;/a&gt;, marking the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;.\nTharn usurped the throne as &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Emperor of the Septim Empire of Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; until his ultimate demise in &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt; at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, by the unification of the Staff of Chaos and the &lt;a href=\"Jewel%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Jewel of Fire&lt;/a&gt;'s power.\nBackground.\nEarly life.\nTharn's life before Imperial service is highly ambiguous. Tharn claimed to be born in southern &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; mother, which according to \"&lt;a href=\"Notes%20on%20Racial%20Phylogeny\"&gt;Notes on Racial Phylogeny&lt;/a&gt;\", would likely make him Bosmer in appearance. According to &lt;a href=\"Symmachus\"&gt;Symmachus&lt;/a&gt;, Tharn was also part-&lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, part-&lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, and \"part the gods only know what.\" According to \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Fort%20Faleria\"&gt;The Lost Fort Faleria&lt;/a&gt;\", even minor physical features can be passed down from the father, likely explaining Tharn's red eyes that are common in most Dunmer. Symmachus also claimed that &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Human blood&lt;/a&gt; was absent from Tharn's ancestry. This, however, is untrue if he is a member by birth of &lt;a href=\"House%20Tharn\"&gt;House Tharn&lt;/a&gt; whose other members have been notable &lt;a href=\"Nibenese\"&gt;Nibenese&lt;/a&gt; rulers. Tharn also claimed to be the heir of &lt;a href=\"Moraelyn\"&gt;Moraelyn&lt;/a&gt;, a Dunmer of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; whose brother was the &lt;a href=\"King\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;.\nTharn was a mage-priest at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Sethiete\"&gt;Temple of Sethiete&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. He turned to thievery for a short period of time after leaving the temple's circle, stealing many books of old, powerful, and forgotten spells along with lore and articles about many ancient tools and magical items. Included among these texts was information on the Staff of Chaos, an immensely powerful magical staff said to be made with the land itself. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20376\"&gt;3E 376&lt;/a&gt;, Tharn had either traveled to &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; under one of his alter-egos, an enigmatic bard named \"Nightingale,\" or tasked &lt;a href=\"Drayven%20Indoril\"&gt;Drayven Indoril&lt;/a&gt; to do so, and stole the Staff of Chaos from its hiding place in the Mournhold mines.\nUsurper of the throne.\nLater in his life, Tharn had been appointed Imperial Battlemage of the Empire and adviser to Uriel Septim VII. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt;, Tharn used the Staff of Chaos to trap the Emperor and banished him to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. After his apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt;, threatened that she would warn the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; of his treachery, Tharn used the staff to eliminate her corporeal form, though she was still able to communicate intermittently with Tamriel's inhabitants.\nTharn, using Illusion magic, took the Emperor's appearance and usurped the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;, replacing the Emperor's guards and servants with &lt;a href=\"lesser%20Daedra\"&gt;lesser Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and other foul creatures, also using Illusion magic to disguise them and remain beyond suspicion. Later, he split the staff into eight pieces, as the land itself split. He then drained the pieces of the staff of its power, and put it into the Jewel of Fire, as a sustainable lifeforce.\nThe only fallacy with his plan would've been the true emperor, Uriel Septim VII, himself. Normally when the Emperor of Tamriel dies, the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; is magically informed by the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; and meets to select a successor. By imprisoning Septim in another dimension where time ran slower, Tharn prevented this from happening. He then shattered the staff into eight pieces, which Ria Silmane explained was done by Tharn \"splitting the land,\" and hid them in all of Tamriel's provinces, excluding the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Province%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Imperial Province&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shadowkeys.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20397\"&gt;3E 397&lt;/a&gt;, Tharn and &lt;a href=\"Shadowmage\"&gt;Shadowmage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pergan%20Asuul\"&gt;Pergan Asuul&lt;/a&gt; tried to manipulate the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Bend%27r%20Mahk\"&gt;War of the Bend'r-Mahk&lt;/a&gt; to create the Shadow of War, the powerful creature known as &lt;a href=\"Umbra%27%20Keth\"&gt;Umbra' Keth&lt;/a&gt;. However, a &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Azra%27s%20Crossing\"&gt;mysterious hero&lt;/a&gt; with the help of &lt;a href=\"Skelos%20Undriel\"&gt;Skelos Undriel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azra%20Nightwielder\"&gt;Azra Nightwielder&lt;/a&gt;, thwarted his plan.\nDestroying the Battlespire.\nThe following year, in &lt;a href=\"3E%20398\"&gt;3E 398&lt;/a&gt;, Tharn made a bargain with the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; to invade the &lt;a href=\"Battlespire\"&gt;Battlespire&lt;/a&gt;, the Imperial training facility and bastion of the Imperial Battlemages.\nEssential to protect himself, Tharn had to eliminate any and all threats to his reign. As some circles of battlemages were aware that Tharn was impersonating the Emperor they clearly posed a threat. Mehrunes Dagon was defeated and cast back into Oblivion by a &lt;a href=\"The%20Apprentice%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;mysterious hero&lt;/a&gt;, but the Battlespire\u00a0was destroyed. The Imperial Battlemages were no longer capable of thwarting Tharn's reign.\nFinal battle and death.\nTharn's reign ended in &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion, with the help of Ria Silmane and Lady Barenziah, managed to gather the eight hidden pieces of the Staff of Chaos. During the final battle in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;, the Eternal Champion managed to unite the Jewel of Fire and the Staff of Chaos, which while the former infused with the Staff's power, served as Tharn's lifeforce. Jagar Tharn disintegrated into a red liquid, his clothes burning into dust. Uriel Septim VII returned via a portal generated by the staff, and declared the hero who saved him the Eternal Champion of Tamriel."}

An example of this can be seen in the Thieves Guild quest, &lt;a href=\"Ahdarji%27s%20Heirloom\"&gt;Ahdarji's Heirloom&lt;/a&gt; in , where the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; must sneak into &lt;a href=\"jail\"&gt;jail&lt;/a&gt; in order to obtain a ring stolen by a freelance thief who had been previously caught."}

This guide\u00a0will cover\u00a0the multiple methods of escaping prisons including: the\u00a0most direct ways of escape, alternate\u00a0escape routes\u00a0and secret passageways in short detail.\nMajor cities (with keeps).\nMarkarth.\nSee &lt;a href=\"No%20One%20Escapes%20Cidhna%20Mine\"&gt;No One Escapes Cidhna Mine&lt;/a&gt; article. Basic walkthrough: Ask anyone who &lt;a href=\"Madanach\"&gt;Madanach&lt;/a&gt; is and follow the questline.\nAfter completing the mission \"No One Escapes Cidhna Mine\" it is impossible to ever get out without serving time. (However, there is a bug in which\u00a0the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0can trap themselves in Cidhna Mine forever by hitting the ore with a pickaxe,\u00a0they can deplete the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Ore%20Vein\"&gt;silver veins&lt;/a&gt; and since the ore does not reset after a certain amount of time;\u00a0they will never be able to get the option to serve time. See the &lt;a href=\"Cidhna%20Mine\"&gt;Cidhna Mine&lt;/a&gt; article for a fix to this bug.) \u00a0\nOne possible way, however, is to kill Madanach and &lt;a href=\"Borkul%20the%20Beast\"&gt;Borkul&lt;/a&gt; within the main area of the mine. Both of their bodies are permanent, and their &lt;a href=\"Keys%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;keys&lt;/a&gt; can be stashed on them for future use.\u00a0\nRiften.\nThe Dragonborn\u00a0starts off in what looks more like an ill-treated hotel room than a cell. To\u00a0the right there is a desk with a &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lockpick&lt;/a&gt; hidden amongst the food. Behind is the bed, and to\u00a0the left is a dresser and a bucket. If\u00a0they notice on the back wall, there is a shackle. Activate it and it will move the wall; revealing a tunnel.\u00a0Enter them, and\u00a0keep moving through the tunnels (sometimes when activating\u00a0the shackle;\u00a0the wall will stay up but the guards will turn hostile and attack).\u00a0Eventually there\u00a0will be a sewer grate, open it and there sits\u00a0the Dragonborn's confiscated items. Travel through the sewers until\u00a0there is an\u00a0exit. This does not work on the Xbox as of patch 1.6.\nFirstly pick the lock of your jail cell or &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt; it off the guard who will be standing next to\u00a0the cell\u00a0when\u00a0the Dragonborn\u00a0is jailed. &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; towards the passageway to\u00a0the left, then enter a door on the left hand side (not in front). Turn left, enter another door, and\u00a0there will\u00a0the confiscated\u00a0belongings chest in the top right hand corner.\nExit out the same way but turn right and go through the door seen when entering the passageway. Head up the steps, turn right and there will be the door leading out to &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;.\nSolitude.\n&lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; is perhaps the hardest of the jails to escape.\nFirst, after being jailed, in\u00a0the cell under a bucket in the corner on the left side of\u00a0the door there is a lockpick which is very useful if\u00a0the Dragonborn's\u00a0breaks, turn and check the wall on the left side of the windows towards the bottom. It should say \"Activate Crumbling Mortar.\" After activating it, the wall will crumble. Follow the path and\u00a0they will be brought to a hole in the wall from which\u00a0one can access the Prisoner's Possessions box, which has an &lt;a href=\"Lock%20Level\"&gt;adept lock&lt;/a&gt;. The key\u00a0can be\u00a0looted off the guards once they have been killed, or alternatively, pickpocket the key. Be careful to wait, as guards will come through the crumbling wall and exit\u00a0through\u00a0the Dragonborn's\u00a0prison door, leaving it wide open. Do not go that way though. If\u00a0the Dragonborn\u00a0has a high Sneak skill, just step by the hay pile and let them go through (there are two guards.)\nThen, take a right, around the corner, and head for the manhole exit. It\u00a0will\u00a0exit onto\u00a0on a platform of land behind a house.\u00a0Jump down from the ledge to be\u00a0free. If there is no\u00a0option to activate the crumbling wall,\u00a0the player\u00a0can also phase through the wall very easily using the wooden plate on the table.\nEscaping without using secret passages is much more difficult. Unfortunately, the steps are too complicated to mention, due to guards being everywhere, but there are a few basic things to have. Firstly, the Dragonborn will\u00a0need to have a good level of magic, and must be able to\u00a0cast &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Life%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Detect Life&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Muffle\"&gt;Muffle&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; also works).\nTo escape, the basic route is to escape the jail cell, walk to the passageway directly ahead, follow the path up the steps, turn first left, down the steps, and the belongings chest will be on a table. Follow the path onwards and eventually reach the door into Castle Dour, and then Solitude.\nThe Dragonborn can also wait\u00a0for the guard to\u00a0patrol\u00a0around and pickpocket the jail key from the guard to unlock all the cells or\u00a0just their own.\u00a0The key can\u00a0also be\u00a0used to take their belongings from the chest rather than picking the lock.\nWhiterun.\nOnce a &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;crime&lt;/a&gt; is committed\u00a0in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; and the guards catch the criminal,\u00a0they can choose to end up in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach%20Dungeon\"&gt;Dragonsreach Dungeon&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce\u00a0the Dragonborn\u00a0is inside their cell,\u00a0they are stripped of all items except for one &lt;a href=\"lockpick%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lockpick&lt;/a&gt;. There are two possible ways to escape from the prison. The first one is shorter but much riskier. When out of sight of any guards, pick the lock to the main door of\u00a0the cell (an adept level lock). Then reclaim\u00a0any confiscated\u00a0equipment from the evidence\u00a0chest.\nAny belongings can be found in\u00a0the evidence chest, but a &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Guard\"&gt;guard&lt;/a&gt; patrols the area the chest is held in. Once\u00a0the equipment is retrieved,\u00a0the\u00a0Dragonborn\u00a0must carefully escape through the main door, because there are several guards patrolling there as well.\nThe other way of escaping is longer and safer, but it is still not that easy. In\u00a0the cell, there will be a dead bandit lying on the ground. The bandit will be lying on top of a sewer grate with a novice level Lock. Open it and\u00a0drop into the sewers.\nWhile progressing,\u00a0there should\u00a0be a set of stairs leading to a hole in the wall. Through the hole, the lock on the evidence and prisoner belongings chest can be picked\u00a0to retrieve any confiscated equipment. Deeper into the dungeon,\u00a0there will\u00a0be\u00a0an exit into the guard barracks. Exit the sewers to safety.\nNote: Proceed with caution as the guards may become hostile after\u00a0the jailbreak.\nAnother way is much more action worthy. Equip the spell &lt;a href=\"Sparks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sparks&lt;/a&gt; and wait for a guard to come by and attack them with Sparks.\u00a0Continue\u00a0attacking\u00a0until the guards\u00a0become hostile.\u00a0They will unlock and\u00a0open the cell door,\u00a0allowing an alternate\u00a0escape route for the prisoner (try to get\u00a0confiscated equipment first before escaping).\nWindhelm.\nEscaping &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; prison is quite difficult, and a high Sneak skill\u00a0is recommended.\nTo breakout, the prisoner needs to pick the lock of\u00a0their jail cell. There is only one exit, so head up the path and up the stairs. There will be a fork in the hall, so just head out of the keep.\nRaven Rock (\"Dragonborn\" DLC).\nEscaping &lt;a href=\"The%20Bulwark%20Jail\"&gt;the Bulwark prison&lt;/a&gt; is quite easy, as even low level thieves can escape without alerting the guards.\nTo escape, look under the firewood of the fireplace. Unlock the novice level grate and drop down. Run to the right and head to the edge of the walkway. Unlock the prisoner belongings chest to\u00a0retrieve confiscated belongings\u00a0and then drop down again. Continue through the sewers until there is a\u00a0door to &lt;a href=\"Coldcinder%20Cave\"&gt;Coldcinder Cave&lt;/a&gt;. Enter the medium-sized cave (there are &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeevers&lt;/a&gt; and a few &lt;a href=\"Netch%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Netch&lt;/a&gt; here, which help for the quest to find &lt;a href=\"Netch%C2%A0Jelly\"&gt;Netch\u00a0Jelly&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt; alchemist.) and walk out into &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther cities (without keeps).\nDawnstar.\nThe jail layout of &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt; is the same as &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst, as with most cities,\u00a0the Dragonborn\u00a0will start in a cell with one lockpick. Be careful when picking the lock because once\u00a0the lock is picked,\u00a0the guard will know and come over to\u00a0the cell.\u00a0The key\u00a0can also be\u00a0pickpocketed off of the guard.\nNote that in the back right corner of the cell there is the lockpicking skill book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Wolf%20Queen%2C%20Book%20I\"&gt;The Wolf Queen, Book I&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAn easier way is to shout at the wall. The guard will come over,\u00a0asking to stop shouting\u00a0and leave the door open. Also, if\u00a0the Dragonborn\u00a0leaves\u00a0the cell, the guards will\u00a0not be hostile.\nOnce\u00a0out of the cell, turn left to find a desk and the evidence and belongings chests which contain\u00a0all confiscated\u00a0equipment.\u00a0The key\u00a0can be\u00a0stolen off the desk or lockpick the chests to get\u00a0the belongings back.\nThe exit out of jail is right in front of\u00a0the\u00a0cell.\nThe key to the jail is on the table where the prison guard sits. The key can be taken by using the Telekinesis spell to bring it over to you.\nFalkreath.\nThe jail layout of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; is the same as Dawnstar.\nFirst, as with most cities,\u00a0the Dragonborn\u00a0will start in a cell with one lockpick. Be careful when picking the lock because once\u00a0the lock is picked,\u00a0the guard will know and come over to\u00a0the cell. The key\u00a0can also be\u00a0pickpocketed off of the guard.\nA second, much better way is to shout at the wall. The guard will come over,\u00a0asking to stop shouting\u00a0and leave the door open. Also, if\u00a0the Dragonborn\u00a0leaves\u00a0the cell, the guards will\u00a0not be hostile.\nOnce out of the cell, turn left to find a desk and the evidence and belongings chests which contain\u00a0all confiscated\u00a0equipment.\u00a0The key\u00a0can be\u00a0stolen off the desk or lockpick the chests to get\u00a0the belongings back.\nThe exit out of jail is right in front of\u00a0the cell.\nMorthal.\nThe jail layout of &lt;a href=\"Morthal%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt; is similar to Dawnstar and Falkreath.\nAs always, the Dragonborn starts with one lockpick. Either pick the lock or shout at the wall, the guard will come over and request to stop, walking away without locking the door.\nBe careful when opening the cell door as the guard will come over. Hide in the opposite corner of the bed and he will not notice. Proceed to either sneak around or kill the guard.\nConfiscated belongings will be in a chest just a little in front of the cell. One can walk out a little, and find a barrel with three extra lockpicks to help in picking the chest lock.\nThe exit is in front of the cell door. There are four guards on duty here, and escape is almost impossible unless the Dragonborn has a high sneak skill or casts a Muffle or Invisibility spell.\nAlternatively, use Whirlwind Sprint at the wall to go through it and spawn next to the door, but do not forget any confiscated items. This may not work every time (tested only on Xbox 360).\nWinterhold.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Chill\"&gt;The Chill&lt;/a&gt; is rather unique as the Dragonborn retains all of their items, even the stolen goods. This is probably the easiest jail to escape from, especially if going for the \"Wanted\" achievement after acquiring enough bounty in all nine holds for the \"Master Criminal\" achievement and paying it off in the other holds.\nFirst off, after being arrested the Dragonborn is transported very far north, past &lt;a href=\"Septimus%20Signus%27s%20Outpost\"&gt;Septimus Signus's Outpost&lt;/a&gt;. They will be in a small cage with one &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frost Atronach&lt;/a&gt; acting as a guard. Kill it using &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;shouts&lt;/a&gt; if at a low level, or open the gate and battle it, or use the spell Flames on it from inside the cage (it will not attack if it is killed in this way). Note: spells other than &lt;a href=\"Flames%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Flames&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sparks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sparks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frostbite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arniel%27s%20Convection\"&gt;Arniel's Convection&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Drain%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampiric Drain&lt;/a&gt; will impact on the cage walls (i.e. concentration spells).\nThe cage itself is an adept lock so, before being jailed, bring lockpicks. Outside are three other frost atronachs and there is a chance to see a &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20Cat%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sabre Cat&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Horker%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Horker&lt;/a&gt; depending on the level.\nTo escape, just turn around and run up the small mountain onto an ore vein. The enemies will not follow and will eventually give up, allowing the ability to fast travel away.\nHowever, if the Dragonborn is not yet strong enough to fight &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frost Atronachs&lt;/a&gt;, the simplest thing to do, since they have all of their inventory, is to pick the lock and sprint out of the cave and into the ocean, where the atronachs will not try to fight."}

Regular enemies throughout the dungeon have a small chance of dropping any set item. &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Chests&lt;/a&gt; will sometimes contain an armor piece, the chance being higher for harder to unlock chests and if the &lt;a href=\"Treasure%20Hunter%20%28Champion%29\"&gt;Treasure Hunter&lt;/a&gt; perk is active. Dropped Set items will always be of superior quality in normal difficulty and epic quality in veteran difficulty."}

I was entrusted with a page from an ancient &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; text, retrieved from a researcher in &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;.\nMy Ayleidoon is not very good, but I was able to understand something about elemental shards and \"sleeping guardians\" within the ruins. None of this would be a problem if Vonos had granted me more time, but he and &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;our Lord&lt;/a&gt; are impatient. But I will make do. My research is what matters.\nThe Ayleids believed the four elements to be Earth, Water, Air, and Light. From what I understand, shards representing these four elements may serve as \"keys\" to certain hidden chambers. It is fascinating to ponder how many &lt;a href=\"Great%20Welkynd%20Stone\"&gt;Great Welkynd Stone&lt;/a&gt;s may be hidden among ruins thought to be barren.\nIf there is a hidden chamber within Rielle, this might be how they are opened. But how? Where? At the cost of their lives, many of our disciples have searched nearly every corner of the ruin, but have yet to discover anything. I will study the texts further.\n17th Last Seed, 4E 201\nVonos has issued urgent orders to descend on Rielle with the last of our expedition to try and find the Great Welkynd Stone. I am to go with the team and lead them. The &lt;a href=\"Vigilants%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Vigil of Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; are assumed to be on our trail so we must act quickly.\nI must not allow this wrinkle to deter my research. It is almost within my grasp.\n17th Last Seed, 4E 201\nWoe to those who entered before me and met their fate. I imagined not the horrors that awaited me.\nOur persistence in this expedition has awoken Ayleid Wights - guardians who have lied in wait for untold centuries, sealed in their sarcophagi, awakening to protect the ancient powers within.\nAnd yet, all is not lost. I found four Welkynd Stone holders in the Rielle Crypt, each colored gold and positioned to the north, south, east, and west. The directions correspond with each of the four elements.\nNorth, upward to the Air (&lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Shard%20-%20Wel\"&gt;Wel&lt;/a&gt;) in the sky.\nSouth, for the Earth (&lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Shard%20-%20Sercen\"&gt;Sercen&lt;/a&gt;) under our feet.\nEast, for the Light (&lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Shard%20-%20Alata\"&gt;Alata&lt;/a&gt;) of the rising sun.\nWest, for when the Water (&lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Shard%20-%20Nen\"&gt;Nen&lt;/a&gt;) devours it.\nA diagram in the Ayleid text matches this pattern. If these shards are retrieved and placed in the correct holders, I believe the secret chamber containing the Great Welkynd Stone will make itself known.\nMy team has been slain, and I have been injured. A pity, as I have heard rumors of an &lt;a href=\"The%20Midden\"&gt;area&lt;/a&gt; underneath the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;college&lt;/a&gt; where this stone could have been put to better use. I just need to hold out a little longer..."}

Both survived, but were infected with the &lt;a href=\"Diseases%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Porphyric%20Hemophilia%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Porphyric Hemophilia&lt;/a&gt; and became vampires themselves. While Janus came to accept his new life, Rona saw her vampiric existence as only a curse and refused to drink the blood needed to keep her healthy; she soon fell into a coma caused by despair and malnutrition. Janus has been looking for a way to cure his wife to help her find the peace she craves.\nAs a count, Janus has proven to be very successful. Despite his private life away from the world, his people have come to love and respect him. Only a few people are aware that the count is a vampire. Two of his advisors, &lt;a href=\"Shum%20gro-Yarug\"&gt;Shum gro-Yarug&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hal-Liurz\"&gt;Hal-Liurz&lt;/a&gt;, know and keep his secret. They work as his representatives and handle almost everything on his behalf. It is these two that are commonly encountered when visiting the castle. Visitors with appointments are the only ones able to see the Count.\nHe feels no kinship toward and even hates other vampires, seeing them as mindless creatures who have given in to animal instinct. He also does not want to bring suspicion upon himself by fraternizing with them. Because of this, he has no tolerance for other vampires who enter the area.\nDespite his abhorrence to his kin, he also dislikes vampire hunters, as evidenced in the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Information%20at%20a%20Price\"&gt;Information at a Price&lt;/a&gt;.\" Ultimately, he orders the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; to deal with them with any method necessary as long as they leave the city, regardless of if they live or die. However, he cannot defend the Hero if murder is chosen to eliminate the hunters.\nHis feelings toward the Mages Guild is neutral at best, but he does provide valuable information about the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;necromancers&lt;/a&gt;, a group Hassildor does not want to succeed and destroy the guild.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Allies%20for%20Bruma\"&gt;Allies for Bruma&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen spoken to, Hassildor will refuse to send troops to &lt;a href=\"Bruma\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt; as there is an &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt; outside the walls and cannot afford to lose any men. Upon closing the gate, Hassildor will agree to send some of his guards to Bruma.\n&lt;a href=\"Ulterior%20Motives\"&gt;Ulterior Motives&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; sends the Hero to obtain a book from Hassildor. Upon speaking to one of his stewards, &lt;a href=\"Mercator%20Hosidus\"&gt;Mercator Hosidus&lt;/a&gt;, Mercator will direct them to a location away from the city and will ambush them, revealing that he was actually a &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;. After the ambush Hassildor will appear and speak to the Hero, revealing that he suspected Mercator to be a necromancer but made no move against him because he knew nothing of Mercator's necromancers allies. He also reveals to the Hero that they weren't sent for a book, but they were actually sent to spy on him because the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Mages\"&gt;Council&lt;/a&gt; suspected that he was affiliated with the Necromancers. He tells them that he isn't and sends them back to the Council.\n&lt;a href=\"Information%20at%20a%20Price\"&gt;Information at a Price&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Hero is sent back to Hassildor because he has told the Council that he has valuable information for them. He tells the Hero that \"nothing is for free\" and tasks the hero to clear out a &lt;a href=\"Bloodcrust%20Cavern\"&gt;vampire hideout&lt;/a&gt; and to get rid of a troublesome group of vampire hunters in the city. He then tells the Hero that he found out that the legendary &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt; has returned.\n&lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Cure%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Vampire Cure&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring this quest, the Hero is sent to Hassildor in order to help find a cure for vampirism. Hassildor will explain that he and his wife became infected and how his wife slipped into a coma. He tells them that his research has told that a group of witches are rumored to know the cure, and that his scouts report that they found one in Cyrodiil. He tells them to go find the cure and bring it back. The Hero finds the cure and both himself and his wife drink it, however his wife dies because of her weak condition. Hassildor sends the Hero away and tells them to come back after he's \"set her affairs in order.\" He will then award the player with leveled ."}

One Blood Horker and two &lt;a href=\"Mudcrab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mudcrabs&lt;/a&gt; are encountered upon entering the cave. A chest filled with random loot can be found near the entrance to Japhet's Folly Towers.\nJaphet's Folly Towers.\nIt is accessible via a frontal assault and &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lockpicking&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Lock%20Level\"&gt;master-level&lt;/a&gt; door. If one follows the perimeter from the main gate to the left, round both of the towers, there is a section of the wall with logs slanted in on an angle where it is possible to jump over the wall. However, the door to the fort requires a key, so the Dragonborn must take the more roundabout route through the sea cave to get inside.\nUpon entering Japhet's Folley Towers through the sea cave, the Dragonborn encounters a tower staircase to the left and a dead end to the right. A &lt;a href=\"woodcutter%27s%20axe\"&gt;woodcutter's axe&lt;/a&gt; lies on top of several crates at the dead end. When using the staircases ahead, several Blood Horkers attack the Dragonborn. When the top of the tower is reached, a passageway with a door can be seen. If the hallway is followed, the Dragonborn reaches a locked exit to Skyrim, and another tower.\n&lt;a href=\"Haldyn\"&gt;Haldyn&lt;/a&gt; is at the top of this tower.\nFrom here, the Dragonborn can choose to go up the staircase on the left and kill Haldyn, thus making it impossible to loot the rest of the fort, or go down the staircase to the right to continue exploring the area. Note that the fort can still be looted before the Dragonborn exits the tower.\nIf the lower staircase is chosen, the Dragonborn is met with numerous Blood Horkers who will attack on sight. At the bottom of the tower there is an &lt;a href=\"Lock%20Level\"&gt;apprentice-level&lt;/a&gt; locked chest filled with random loot and an &lt;a href=\"Lock%20Level\"&gt;expert-level&lt;/a&gt; wooden door. Behind the door lies a level-dependent locked chest and the body of &lt;a href=\"Japhet\"&gt;Japhet&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Japhet%27s%20Journal\"&gt;his journal&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter walking up every staircase in the tower, the Dragonborn reaches Haldyn. The top room has a \"boss\" chest, an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arcane enchanter&lt;/a&gt;, and four books, along with various other items.\nAfter the Dragonborn kills Haldyn and exits the tower in which he resides, the island will be assaulted with explosive arrows by the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt; mercenaries, thus destroying the settlement and killing all the pirates, making the island completely uninhabitable."}

The Jarls are largely independent, but they swear fealty to Skyrim's &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt;.\nAscension.\nThe position of Jarl is hereditary, passing from parent to their first-born child. Daughters are equal in the line of succession, as &lt;a href=\"Idgrod%20the%20Younger\"&gt;Idgrod the Younger&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Morthal%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt; clearly states that she is to inherit the office of Jarl from her mother, Jarl &lt;a href=\"Idgrod%20Ravencrone\"&gt;Idgrod Ravencrone&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanes are also members of the Jarl's Court. The number of Thanes a Hold has varies largely depending on its size.\nResidence and apparel.\nJarls reside in lavish palaces in the main cities of the holds in which they govern. There, they sit upon the throne, surrounded by their subjects. Jarls also wear specific coronets, similar to &lt;a href=\"circlets\"&gt;circlets&lt;/a&gt;, with the exception of Ulfric Stormcloak and Idgrod Ravencrone. Jarls from all holds wear &lt;a href=\"Noble%20Clothes\"&gt;Noble Clothes&lt;/a&gt;, a set of which can be found on a shelf in the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company%20Warehouse\"&gt;East Empire Company Warehouse&lt;/a&gt;.\nForm of address.\nAs a title, Jarls are addressed to as Jarl (Name) i.e. \"What do you say on this matter, &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Jarl Ulfric&lt;/a&gt;?\" The full name is not required when addressing to a Jarl.

It comes from a rare, poisonous plant found only on the island of &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;.

It is supposed to be used during the assassination quest, however, as this is the only sample that is obtainable, the target may be killed by other means and the root saved for later.\nWhile closely resembling &lt;a href=\"Canis%20Root%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Canis Root&lt;/a&gt; in appearance, Jarrin Root has no actual plant data of its own and therefore cannot be planted in a &lt;a href=\"garden\"&gt;garden&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"greenhouse\"&gt;greenhouse&lt;/a&gt; in , making it non-replenishable without using &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Console Commands&lt;/a&gt;.\nEffects.\nWhen ingested raw, it causes 200 points of &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;health damage&lt;/a&gt;, enough to kill some characters, even the Dragonborn depending on their health.\nUsefulness.\nCombining Jarrin Root together with ingredients such as &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Nirnroot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Crimson Nirnroot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Glow%20Dust%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Glow Dust&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Human%20Heart%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Human Heart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blisterwort\"&gt;Blisterwort&lt;/a&gt; will create a devastating poison. With a sufficient &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt; skill, the right &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29%23Perks\"&gt;alchemist perks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Alchemy\"&gt;Fortify Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; enchantments, the damage done by Jarrin root poison can number in the thousands, making it capable of instantly killing many powerful characters or enemies.\nBecause only one sample exists, it is advisable to first complete the quest \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Return%20To%20Your%20Roots\"&gt;A Return To Your Roots&lt;/a&gt;\" as the reward will grant the active power &lt;a href=\"Sinderion%27s%20Serendipity\"&gt;Sinderion's Serendipity&lt;/a&gt;, a power which gives a 25% chance of receiving two potions when working at the alchemy lab. This makes it possible to create two vials of potent poisons.\nIn addition, by pickpocketing the Jarrin Root from Astrid and then turning it into a potion before talking to her, the Dragonborn can receive a second root. Note that simply pickpocketing it without using it does not yield this result; dropping the item results in it disappearing off the ground when Astrid gives you the 'second' root, and storing it in a container results in Astrid not giving a root at all. When done correctly, one can obtain four vials of potent poisons through this and Sinderion's Serendipity."}

He is the &lt;a href=\"grandmaster\"&gt;grandmaster&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nFriendship with Uriel Septim.\nHaving continuously proven a valuable asset to the Blades, he soon was promoted to Captain of the Palace Squadron, a group of Blades charged with the security of the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; within the walls of &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;. As a captain of the Blades, he was the main guardian and became a trusted friend of Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne night, Uriel asked for Jauffre's presence in his chambers. As Jauffre entered the room, a small basket caught his attention, for inside lay a &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;baby boy&lt;/a&gt;. At once Jauffre knew that the boy was the son of the Emperor, yet an illegitimate heir to the throne. Uriel ordered Jauffre to take the boy, Martin, to a secret location where he could grow up free from the machinations of the palace. Jauffre took upon this task unquestioningly and left the basket on the doorstep of a farmer whom he deemed appropriate. Over the course of the following years, Uriel would ask about the boy's progress from time to time.\nWeynon Priory.\nEventually, Jauffre was promoted to Grandmaster of the Blades. As he became older, Jauffre retired to live as a monk in Weynon Priory.\nPersonality and traits.\nJauffre was very dedicated to Uriel Septim VII and to the Empire. He held some disdain for the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, stating that they had no power over him or the other Blades members. He held the safety and regard of the land above all else and would do anything to see Tamriel free from the hordes of Oblivion. Despite his age, Jauffre was also an exceptional fighter, possessing skills akin to that of a master warrior. Wielding an &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Dai-Katana\"&gt;Akaviri Dai-Katana&lt;/a&gt; and specializing in both &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;heavy armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, Jauffre is more than an average fighter capable of fighting the toughest of opponents.\nJauffre acts as a mentor to Martin and the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; throughout the crisis and did whatever he could in the way of guidance so that the two could ultimately stop the forces of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, he was deemed a hero.\n\"The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion\".\nSeveral years later, in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, Uriel Septim was assassinated in the secret escape route out of the Imperial City. Upon learning this, Jauffre despaired until the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; brought the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; to him. At first, Jauffre assumed the only way for the Hero to have the amulet would be if he had played a part in the murder of the Emperor, but as the Hero conveyed Uriel Septim's last words, Jauffre understood that such message could only come from the deceased ruler. Eventually, Jauffre told the Hero of Martin's whereabouts: Martin was a Priest of Akatosh in the city of Kvatch. The Hero was to travel to Kvatch and bring Martin back safely so they could seek refuge within the walls of the Blade's headquarters of Cloud Ruler Temple, and trace a plan of action to overturn the Mythic Dawn.\nWhile the Hero was away, the Priory came under attack. &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt; assassins rushed in and attempted to kill Jauffre, who was alerted to their presence by a fellow monk's scream. Jauffre managed to defend himself and met with the Hero and a young man, who had just arrived at the Priory. Together they took care of the remaining assassins and rushed to Jauffre's study, only to find that the Amulet of Kings had been stolen. He had almost given up hope when he recognized the young man brought by the Hero as Martin, and decided to leave for Cloud Ruler Temple immediately as to ensure Martin's safety.\nOblivion Crisis.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Ruler%20Temple%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cloud Ruler Temple&lt;/a&gt; in northern Cyrodiil, Jauffre presented Martin to the Blades and recruited the Hero of Kvatch as a Knight Brother of the Blades. Several days later, he dispatched the Hero to meet with &lt;a href=\"Baurus\"&gt;Baurus&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. After the Hero had returned Jauffre sent him to kill some Mythic Dawn spies and close an Oblivion gate outside of Bruma. Jauffre would also take an integral part in making sure Martin was protected and that every effort against the Mythic Dawn was attended too.\nJauffre would then be one of the chief defenders in the Second Battle of Bruma alongside Baurus, Martin and the Hero, fighting bravely and fiercely despite his old age until the Hero would manage to close the Great Gate and claim victory for the battle. Jauffre then expresses joy at the victory, but also notes that the crisis is not yet over.\nWhen the Hero went into Paradise, Jauffre dispatched Baurus to the Imperial City in order to tell the Elder Council of Martin and how he is the only chance that Tamriel has. When the Hero returned, Jauffre accompanied him and Martin to the Imperial City where he could light the Dragonfires and be crowned emperor.\nDespite their best efforts the forces of destruction launch one final, massive assault on the Imperial City. Jauffre would take up the defense and fight once more alongside Martin, Baurus and the Hero and the group fought their way through the Imperial City. While Jauffre and Baurus fought off the hordes of Daedra, Martin and the Hero then entered the Temple of the One and saw the end of the forces of Oblivion and Mehrunes Dagon.\nJauffre arrived alongside Baurus and &lt;a href=\"High%20Chancellor%20Ocato\"&gt;High Chancellor Ocato&lt;/a&gt; to congratulate Martin and the Hero only to discover that Martin sacrificed himself in order to defeat Mehrunes Dagon and seal the portals to Oblivion forever. He would personally congratulate the Hero and note that he was more a Champion of Tamriel than just &lt;a href=\"Champion%20of%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Champion of Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Crisis.\nJauffre and Baurus would return to Cloud Ruler Temple where he stated gave him some sense of certainty in such uncertain times. He also notes that Martin was probably the greatest emperor who ever lived, perhaps even rivaling &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; himself. His fate after these events is unknown other than that he remained as the Grandmaster of the Blades and would see them in their future as they return to their ancient role until the next &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; arises.\nConversations.\nCyrus: \"Grandmaster, is this ... ?\"\nJauffre: \"Yes, Cyrus. This is the Emperor's son. Martin Septim.\"\nCyrus: \"My lord! Welcome to Cloud Ruler Temple! We have not had the honor of an Emperor's visit in in many years!\"\nMartin: \"Ah, well, thank you! The honor is mine.\"\nJauffre: \"Come. Your Blades are waiting to greet you.\"\nJauffre: \"Blades! Dark times are upon us. The Emperor and his sons were slain on our watch. The Empire is in chaos. But there is yet hope. Here is Martin Septim, true son of Uriel Septim!\"\nBelisarius: \"Hail, Dragonborn! Hail Martin Septim! Hail!\"\nCaptain Steffan: \"Hail, Dragonborn! Hail Martin Septim!

You will be safe here until you can take up your throne.\"\nMartin: \"Jauffre. All of you. I know you all expect me to be Emperor. I'll do my best. But this is all new to me. I'm not used to giving speeches. But I wanted you to know that I appreciate your welcome here. I hope I prove myself worthy of your loyalty in the coming days. That's it. Thank you.\"\nJauffre: \"Well, then. Thank you, Martin. We'd all best get back to our duties, eh, Captain?\"\nJauffre: \"With all due respect, sire, there must be another way. The risk is too great!\"\nMartin Septim: \"I know the risk. I was at Kvatch. But there is no other way. We have no choice.\"\nJauffre: \"The Countess will never agree to it...\"\nMartin Septim: \"She will. She must.\"\nJauffre: \"Very well. The Blades are, as always, at your disposal.\""}

This brew may prove vital for the company's explorers in Murkmire. Apparently, the ingredients\u2014and Mindileth\u2014can be found in Grahtwood.\"\nWalkthrough.\nTalk to Jee-Lar in &lt;a href=\"Stormhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stormhold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadowfen\"&gt;Shadowfen&lt;/a&gt;, next to &lt;a href=\"Nielsold%27s%20Steeds\"&gt;Nielsold's Steeds&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Stormhold%20Wayshrine\"&gt;wayshrine&lt;/a&gt; to begin the quest. He will explain that Cyrodilic Collections will need anti-venom for the expedition to Murkmire and a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; named Mindileth in &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt; has created an effective concoction.\nHow can I help? \"Our agents in Murkmire are always in danger of being bitten by some gross snake or spiky snail. We need to supply them with reliable curatives. Luckily, I know a brilliant Wood Elf alchemist named Mindileth. She makes a really good-good anti-venom!\"\nFrom here, you will need to travel to Grahtwood and collect the three components: five spider sacs, barbleberry juice, and gloom morel; they can be collected in any order.

Said he'd send somebody with guts, and that about sizes you up. Hope he's right. Did you bring the stuff I need?\"\nAfter vomiting into the cauldron, you can immediately return to Jee-Lar in Shadowfen to complete the quest and earn your reward. If you wait too long to vomit into the cauldron, you will end up vomiting on the ground, but the quest will still advance as normal, and you can return to Jee-Lar.

The regional deity is &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;. Anticlere has been a prominent settlement throughout &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;'s history, from being one of the original settlements during the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Conquest\"&gt;Nordic Conquest&lt;/a&gt;, to being a major party in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Betony\"&gt;War of Betony&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe city of Anticlere is the capital of the Fiefdom of Anticlere, which is among the many political nations that inhabit the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The fiefdom is located east of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Kingdom of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, and it is relatively large, rivaling the likes of the &lt;a href=\"Barony%20of%20Dwynnen\"&gt;Barony of Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Tigonus\"&gt;Fiefdom of Tigonus&lt;/a&gt;. Anticlere has an island located off the coast of the Anticlere City coast. Southeast of the city is a large peninsula; further east is a small river that goes deep within the fiefdom. Bordering the region is &lt;a href=\"Shalgora\"&gt;Shalgora&lt;/a&gt; to the west, &lt;a href=\"Daenia\"&gt;Daenia&lt;/a&gt; to the north, &lt;a href=\"Urvaius\"&gt;Urvaius&lt;/a&gt; to the northeast, and &lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt; to the east. After the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;, the Fiefdom of Anticlere was integrated into the Kingdom of Wayrest, but only halfway, the rest was mostly taken by the Kingdom of Daggerfall. Among the region are several areas notable during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Betony\"&gt;War of Betony&lt;/a&gt; including the &lt;a href=\"Cryngaine%20Field\"&gt;Cryngaine Field&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ravennian%20Forest\"&gt;Ravennian Forest&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Yeorth%20Burrowland\"&gt;Yeorth Burrowland&lt;/a&gt;. The local knightly order is the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Knights of the Flame&lt;/a&gt;, which extends as far as the &lt;a href=\"Alcaire\"&gt;Fiefdom of Alcaire&lt;/a&gt;. The local temple of the Divines is the &lt;a href=\"Benevolence%20of%20Mara\"&gt;Benevolence of Mara&lt;/a&gt;, which is seen in places such as &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20Moors\"&gt;Glenumbra Moors&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Haarvenu\"&gt;Haarvenu Vampire Clan&lt;/a&gt; also occupies the fiefdom.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Nordic Conquest &amp; the Direnni Elves of Balfiera.\nThe town of Reich Gradkeep was founded by the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; along with several other cities including &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Empire\"&gt;First Empire&lt;/a&gt; of Nords had expanded far beyond the &lt;a href=\"Druadach%20Mountains\"&gt;Druadach Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and created settlements across modern-day Greater Bretony as well as areas of the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Several years later, the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Clan\"&gt;Direnni Clan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"High%20Elves\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt; moved into the Iliac Bay and settled on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balfiera\"&gt;Isle of Balfiera&lt;/a&gt;. Ever since then, the Direnni Hegemony would take control of Greater Bretony and even areas of the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;. The town of Reich Gradkeep was under Direnni control. They were able to do this when the Nords had an internal conflict in the form of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt;. Reich Gradkeep eventually became a home for the Breton populace at the end of the First Era.\nThe Modern Rivalry between Anticlere and Sensford.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%201427\"&gt;1E 1427&lt;/a&gt;, the town of Reich Gradkeep and the hamlet of &lt;a href=\"Sensford\"&gt;Sensford&lt;/a&gt; went to war against each other, which ended with the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Duncreigh%20Bridge\"&gt;Battle of Duncreigh Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. The conflict sadly did not accomplish anything between both nations since both villages constantly bragged about their ancient lineages that ruled their home. The burghers of Reich Gradkeep travel to the streets of Sensford to loudly commemorate their victory over the township. This event would cause several brawls and riots across the street. Anticlere has been doing this for several years, even into the Third Era.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Rise of the Usurper; the Battle of Firewaves.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20266\"&gt;3E 266&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haymon%20Camoran\"&gt;Haymon Camoran&lt;/a&gt; raised an army of undead warriors and Daedra to conquer the continent along the western coast, from as far as &lt;a href=\"Arenthia\"&gt;Arenthia&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Northpoint\"&gt;Northpoint&lt;/a&gt;. It was around this year where the Camoran Armada had reached the province of High Rock and the Iliac Bay. Turmoil was erupting throughout Bretony, and it had caused strife between the many kingdoms of the Iliac. The then, Lord of Reich Gradkeep had fallen ill and was on his death bed, he had passed away at the end of the year. Haymon would eventually perish at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Firewaves\"&gt;Battle of Firewaves&lt;/a&gt; at the hand of &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Othrok\"&gt;Baron Othrok&lt;/a&gt; and a united naval force of the Iliac Bay. The Camoran Usurper's legacy would not die out after the Usurper Invasion, his son, &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt; would become the orchestrator of the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; and the end of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;.\nReich Gradkeep during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the town of Reich Gradkeep in their quest to recover the pieces.\nConflict across the Iliac; the War of Betony.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20403\"&gt;3E 403&lt;/a&gt;, the Kingdoms of Daggerfall and Sentinel waged war against each other for the &lt;a href=\"Protectorate%20of%20Betony\"&gt;Protectorate of Betony&lt;/a&gt;, located on the western end of the Iliac Bay. The city of Reich Gradkeep was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Graddock\"&gt;Lord Graddock&lt;/a&gt;, he was neutral in the war and wanted to serve as a neutral facilitator for a treaty between the two. After several confrontations, the two parties met with Lord Graddock at the castle in Reich Gradkeep. A member of the Daggerfall Court, &lt;a href=\"Vanech\"&gt;Lord Vanech&lt;/a&gt; wrote a faulty treaty that gave the city of Daggerfall a majority of the rights to Daggerfall, &lt;a href=\"King%20Camaron\"&gt;King Camaron&lt;/a&gt; had a very keen eye on the situation and realized the deception within the treat. Camaron reacted negatively, and both his and &lt;a href=\"King%20Lysandus\"&gt;King Lysandus&lt;/a&gt;' guards attacked each other, the halls of Castle Reich Gradkeep were covered in blood at the &lt;a href=\"Riot%20in%20Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Riot in Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt;.\nRiot of Reich Gradkeep &amp; the Tragedy of King Lysandus.\nThe armies of both Daggerfall and Sentinel moved into the Anticlere fiefdom, bypassing the &lt;a href=\"Ravennian%20Forest\"&gt;Ravennian Forest&lt;/a&gt; and into the &lt;a href=\"Cryngaine%20Field\"&gt;Cryngaine Field&lt;/a&gt; of Anticlere. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cryngaine%20Field\"&gt;Battle of Cryngaine Field&lt;/a&gt; was a decisive battle in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Betony\"&gt;War of Betony&lt;/a&gt; as it affected both nations for several years, even into the Oblivion Crisis and the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;. The battle went even between Daggerfall and Sentinel; the tables had turned when a large thick fog created &lt;a href=\"Skakmat\"&gt;Skakmat&lt;/a&gt; had enveloped the battlefield, blinding both armies in the process. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Woodborne\"&gt;Lord Woodborne&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; used the fog to assassinate King Lysandus with an arrow of poison. Upon this news, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Gothryd\"&gt;Prince Gothryd&lt;/a&gt;, who was present on the battlefield, was made the King of Daggerfall during the battle and moved into the fight to kill &lt;a href=\"King%20Camaron\"&gt;King Camaron&lt;/a&gt;, who everyone believed to kill Lysandus. Gothryd and Camaron dueled to the death, and Gothryd emerged victoriously.\nLord and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Graddock\"&gt;Lady Graddock&lt;/a&gt;, along with their heir to the throne, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Mara%20Graddock\"&gt;Lady Mara Graddock&lt;/a&gt; were casualties to the Riot in Reich Gradkeep. The city was ravaged by this conflict, not only did soldiers attack each other, but looters and pillagers ransacked the homes and took advantage of the situation. After Graddock, the only person to inherit the throne was a then sickly infant. Graddock's cousin, &lt;a href=\"Auberon%20Flyte\"&gt;Auberon Flyte&lt;/a&gt; assumed the throne of Reich Gradkeep and renamed the city into Anticlere, after their ancestral home.\nAnticlere during the Warp in the West.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Anticlere was under the control of Lord Auberon Flyte and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Doryanna%20Flyte\"&gt;Lady Doryanna Flyte&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom were the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Knights of the Flame&lt;/a&gt;. Auberon had sadly contracted the &lt;a href=\"Guedilioc%20Plague\"&gt;Guedilioc Plague&lt;/a&gt; from an &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; diplomat from &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; and it caused excessive aging, to the point where he appears to be his nineties. Doryanna Flyte would become the de facto leader of Anticlere while her husband was sickly. Doryanna was talented in politics and used the seal of Anticlere to enforce her beliefs and ideals for the fiefdom. &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20Perwright\"&gt;Mayor Perwright&lt;/a&gt; of Anticlere was against her notions and her actions but was fearful of speaking out. Rumor has it that Doryanna was seducing the imprisoned guildmaster of the Anticlere &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;, even going as far as freeing him from prison. Doryanna would rule Anticlere for several years.\nAnticlere's integration into the Kingdom of Wayrest.\nThe Fiefdom of Anticlere, along with other regions, were annexed into the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Wayrest\"&gt;Kingdom of Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; during the Warp in the West. The Wayrest Kingdom was vast, and it extended from half of Anticlere to the &lt;a href=\"Gavaudon\"&gt;Gavaudon&lt;/a&gt; fiefdom all the way to the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt;. The other half of Anticlere was ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Kingdom of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; which was under the control of &lt;a href=\"King%20Gothryd\"&gt;King Gothryd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Aubk%27i\"&gt;Queen Aubk'i&lt;/a&gt;. The Wayrest Kingdom had recently dealt with the loss of &lt;a href=\"King%20Eadwyre\"&gt;King Eadwyre&lt;/a&gt;. Eadwyre's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Elysana\"&gt;Elysana&lt;/a&gt; was named the Queen of Wayrest and had ties with her step-mother, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Barenziah\"&gt;Queen Barenziah&lt;/a&gt; and her half-brother, &lt;a href=\"Helseth%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Helseth Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;. Elysana was a feared ruler and allied with the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Orsinium\"&gt;Third Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;\nand &lt;a href=\"Gortwog%20gro-Nagorm\"&gt;Gortwog gro-Nagorm&lt;/a&gt;."}

Possibly due to being neglected by his parents, Antiochus became known to many &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; as a drunkard and womanizer by the age of sixteen.

They must then begin the &lt;a href=\"Excavation\"&gt;Excavation&lt;/a&gt; process to finally obtain them.\nLeads.\nLeads are temporary items found in fixed locations across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; that are required for Scrying. They provide clues to where antiquities can be found elsewhere in the game world. Leads possessed by the Vestige can be viewed in the \"Antiquities Codex\" section of the Journal. After obtaining a Lead, it will expire after 30 real-world days pass, but can be reacquired later.\nAcquisition.\nAfter joining the Antiquarian Circle, the Vestige will receive several Leads for free. Leads can also be obtained as drops from &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Online%29\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt; and loot from treasure chests, and are also sold by some &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeads can be obtained without joining the Antiquarian Circle, or even without owning the \"Greymoor\" chapter, but require membership in the Circle to be used. They cannot be acquired from other players.\nScrying.\nScrying is the process of using the Antiquarian's Eye on a specific Lead in order to locate dig sites on the map. In order to Scry a Lead, the Vestige must be in the zone from which the Lead originated and then visit the \"Antiquities Codex\" menu in the Journal.\nFacets and foci.\nThe actual Scrying process involves playing a mini-game with the Antiquarian's Eye. In this game, the Vestige is faced with a board of hexagons, which are either facets or foci. Facets have one of five designs on them, and make up the majority of the board. Foci glow brightly, and make up a smaller portion of the board.\nStarting at the center-bottom of the board, the Vestige must select adjacent facet cells in order to reach the foci. Once one focus point is captured, it will become possible to excavate an antiquity, but the map will still contain several false dig sites. With each additional foci captured through this process, the number of false dig sites on the map will be reduced.\nHowever, the Vestige may only make a limited number of moves on the board, and must therefore capture facets strategically; if they capture a facet that has one or more facets with the same design adjacent to it, this single move will capture multiple hexagons. The process can become easier by leveling up and using the Scrying &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Online%29\"&gt;skill line&lt;/a&gt;. Using such an ability does not use a turn in the mini-game. Once a focus point is claimed, abilities are 50% recharged, allowing them to be reused.\nIf the Vestige fails to discover all foci on their first go, they may attempt to scry a Lead multiple times. However, only one focus point is necessary to excavate dig sites.\nExcavation.\nExcavation is the process of uncovering antiquities at dig sites that were discovered after Scrying. Dig sites are distinguishable by a glowing mound of dirt covering the hidden relic. If the dig site proves difficult to find in a given area, the Vestige may quickslot and use the Antiquarian's Eye, which will point them to the nearest dig site. This can be done once every 30 seconds.\nBy using tools like the Anqtiquarian's Eye and &lt;a href=\"Hand%20Brush\"&gt;Hand Brush&lt;/a&gt;, the Vestige may move dirt from the dig site to uncover an antiquity Like Scrying, the Excavation process includes a mini-game containing a board of squares covered with dirt. The Vestige has a limited number of moves to uncover the antiquity hidden at the site, although they may find other loot as well. More tools to improve the process can be unlocked by upgrading the Excavation skill line.\nIf the Vestige fails to dig up an antiquity while excavating, they can try again at another dig site within the same general vicinity, as marked on the map.\nAntiquities.\nAntiquities themselves may be various pieces of powerful &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Items\"&gt;mythic equipment&lt;/a&gt;, new &lt;a href=\"markings\"&gt;markings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"adornments\"&gt;adornments&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Emotes%20%28Online%29\"&gt;emotes&lt;/a&gt;, valuable trinkets that can be sold for a large amount of &lt;a href=\"Gold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, new ancestral &lt;a href=\"crafting%20motif\"&gt;crafting motif&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"siege%20weapons\"&gt;siege weapons&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20Lances\"&gt;Magicka Lances&lt;/a&gt;, a new &lt;a href=\"Mount%20%28Online%29\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Dwarven%20Wolf\"&gt;Ebon Dwarven Wolf&lt;/a&gt;, and new &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrafting motif and bonus loot rune antiquities can be &lt;a href=\"trade\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt;d with other players, but the rest cannot."}

Anu is an equal and opposite force to his counterpart, most commonly called &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt;, and is often considered to exist within all things and personifies order, stasis, and light. According to some, most notably those who worship Padomaic beings, Anu was nothing but a static force incapable of consciousness, personality, intent or will, being depicted as an immutable static force that does not change. Other accounts of Anu testify to him as encompassing everything.\nHistory.\nAnu is neither an &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; nor a &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;; he predates the creation of both groups and played a part in their creation with his counterpart Padomay. In \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Annotated%20Anuad\"&gt;The Annotated Anuad&lt;/a&gt;\", it is stated that, when Anu and Padomay came into being, they both engaged in combat over &lt;a href=\"Nir\"&gt;Nir&lt;/a&gt;, who was \"created from their interplay\" and birthed the Twelve Worlds of Creation. Anu and Padomay fought over Nir, who died in the process. Anu then created &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; out of the remainder of the Twelve Worlds. Padomay, who Anu already thought dead, stabbed him through the chest, resulting in Anu pulling himself and Padomay out of time forever.\nAccording to this account, the &lt;a href=\"et%27Ada\"&gt;et'Ada&lt;/a&gt; were created when Anu and Padomay's blood was spilled. Their mixed blood supposedly gave birth to the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;, while Anu's blood became the &lt;a href=\"Magna%20Ge\"&gt;Magna Ge&lt;/a&gt; and Padomay's blood would end up giving birth to the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. However, the authenticity of this clash is still debatable.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i belief, Anu birthed his own soul after his battle with Padomay, so that he could understand himself and self-reflect. This reborn soul was known as &lt;a href=\"Anui-El\"&gt;Anui-El&lt;/a&gt; and, in turn, became the soul of all things. However, as Anu created Anui-El, Padomay birthed his own soul, &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;, who represented all the limitations of Anui-El. Anui-El then noticed that the world created in their conflict, the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt;, was turbulent and chaotic. In order to stabilize the Aurbis and further his self-reflection, Anui-El birthed his own soul in the same way as Anu before him. Anui-El's soul was known as &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; and began a new force known as &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;. Time allowed the realm of Aurbis to realize its natures and limitations, and thus the et'Ada born from the blood finally began to take forms and names."}

Anui-El is the soul of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt;, and in turn &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; is the soul of Anui-El. Anui-El is also known to be the opposite force to &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;, just as Anu is the opposite force of Padomay.\nHistory.\nAfter the clash of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt;, Anu birthed his own soul so that he could know himself and self-reflect. This soul of his was known as Anui-El and in turn became the soul of all things. But as Anu created Anui-El, Padomay birthed his soul, &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;, who represented all the limitations of Anui-El. The interplay between Anui-El and Sithis created what is known as the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Aurbis at first was turbulent and confusing. In order to stabilize the Aurbis, as well as self-reflect, Anui-El birthed his own soul like his father before him. Anui-El's soul was known as &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; and began a new force known as time. Time allowed the Aurbis to realize its natures and limitations and in turn the &lt;a href=\"Et%27Ada\"&gt;Original Spirits&lt;/a&gt; began to form and take names. At the same time Anui-El birthed Auri-El, Sithis birthed his soul, &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, a being based more on limitation than nature. Sithis begot Lorkhan to destroy Anui-El and the Aurbis with him. When Lorkhan was created he filled the universe with a myriad of ideas and deceived Anui-El and his aspects into thinking he was one of them, but unknown to Anui-El Lorkhan's ideas were based solely on limitation. Lorkhan gained many followers, including Auri-El, after forming the idea to create a \"soul\" for the Aurbis (&lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;) which would allow other Original Spirits to form many aspects and self-reflect. Mundus, however, was a trick and was filled with limitation, the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;aspects&lt;/a&gt; of the Et'Ada began to die off and with them their respective deities. &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; and a few other Et'Ada, later known as the &lt;a href=\"Magna%20Ge\"&gt;Magna Ge&lt;/a&gt;, escaped Mundus, but Auri-El and a few other Et'Ada were trapped in the realm. Auri-El begged Anu to free them from Mundus but Anu had already filled Auri-El's place with another aspect. Anui-El, on the other hand, gave Auri-El his &lt;a href=\"Auriel%27s%20Bow\"&gt;Bow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Auriel%27s%20Shield\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt; to defeat &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnui-El and the All-Maker.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;i concept of Anui-El is very similar to the &lt;a href=\"Skaal\"&gt;Skaal&lt;/a&gt; concept of the &lt;a href=\"All-Maker\"&gt;All-Maker&lt;/a&gt;. A few parallels can be drawn between the two forces such as each of them being considered beings that encompass the souls of all living things. Anui-El and the All-Maker are also known to have equal yet opposite forces, in Anui-El's case being Sithis, and the All-Maker's case, &lt;a href=\"The%20Adversary\"&gt;The Adversary&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible that Anui-El and the All-Maker are the same deity just worshiped differently.\nConflicts.\nIn the book \"&lt;a href=\"Sithis%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;\", it is implied that Anui-El was merely an idea of &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt; formed after he broke &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt;'s endless stasis, but unlike his other ideas Anui-El would not die and \"enslaved\" the universe, creating everlasting imperfection. This is contradicted by the book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Monomyth\"&gt;The Monomyth&lt;/a&gt;\", which states that Sithis was originated from Anui-El's self-reflection, being the sum of all limitations Anui-El needed to ponder himself. However, \"&lt;a href=\"Vehk%27s%20Teaching\"&gt;Vehk's Teaching&lt;/a&gt;\" maintains that Sithis is just the offspring of &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt; and Anui-El is just the offspring of Anu. It could somehow be that each of these is true in a certain way as the events took place in the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; was not linear."}

It is on one end of the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Road\"&gt;Gold Road&lt;/a&gt; that leads to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Ring%20Road\"&gt;Red Ring Road&lt;/a&gt;. Anvil's main gate is located on its northern wall and that is its only entrance. Anvil's town square is surrounded by the storefronts of craftsmen and &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt;s. From there, the city continues to the west and east. To the west is the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20Trading%20Company%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Gold Coast Trading Company&lt;/a&gt; building and residential houses. To the east is the &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Dibella\"&gt;Chapel of Dibella&lt;/a&gt;, the local &lt;a href=\"bank\"&gt;bank&lt;/a&gt;, and the statue of &lt;a href=\"Selkie%20of%20West%20Skerry\"&gt;Selkie of West Skerry&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFirst Era.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%202200\"&gt;1E 2200&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt; affected Western &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; in multiple ways. &lt;a href=\"Bendu%20Olo\"&gt;Bendu Olo&lt;/a&gt; of West Anvil accumulated an army known as the &lt;a href=\"All%20Flags%20Navy\"&gt;All Flags Navy&lt;/a&gt; to fight the &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sails\"&gt;Red Sails&lt;/a&gt; Pirates of the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt; arrived into the Anvil Bay with a large fleet and took control of Anvil with &lt;a href=\"Governor%20Fortunata%20ap%20Dugal\"&gt;Fortunata ap Dugal&lt;/a&gt; as Provincial Governor of Anvil.\nFortunata ruled Anvil with an iron grip and was considered a ruthless dictator among her people. However, Dugal's reign kept the region controlled and prevented anarchy on multiple occasions. Her Red Sails became a private militia in a manner similar vein to the much later &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; in Eastern &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; made a resurgence in the Gold Coast and committed several notable assassinations in places such as Anvil and &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. Two of their first assassinations were &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Quintus%20Jarol\"&gt;Lord Quintus Jarol&lt;/a&gt; at his &lt;a href=\"Jarol%20Estate\"&gt;Estate&lt;/a&gt; north of Anvil and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Sermonizer%20Fithia\"&gt;Grand Sermonizer Fithia at-Himah&lt;/a&gt;. Groups such as the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Hour\"&gt;Order of the Hour&lt;/a&gt; began to antagonize the Brotherhood in the hope of destroying them.\nOddly enough, Fortunata contracted the Dark Brotherhood to assassinate &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Marcus%20Scipio\"&gt;Commander Marcus Scipio&lt;/a&gt; of the Kvatch guard to which the Brotherhood agreed to. The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; was sent to &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Kvatch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Castle Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; to complete the contract. After murdering Scipio, the Vestige encountered &lt;a href=\"Count%20Carolus%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Count Carolus Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; in his chamber. The Count had contracted the Dark Brotherhood to assassinate Dugal in return and so &lt;a href=\"Speaker%20Terenus%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Speaker Terenus&lt;/a&gt; gave the contract to the Vestige and they returned to Anvil. Upon arriving at Anvil Castle, the Vestige was greeted by Dugal, and they both shared a drink on the castle balcony. Dugal's wine was poisoned and she collapsed over the balcony, falling to her death and completing the second contract.\nThird Era.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, Anvil prospered along with the other eight cities in Cyrodiil. The city was under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Millona%20Umbranox\"&gt;Countess Millona Umbranox&lt;/a&gt;, who was well beloved by her people. Her husband, &lt;a href=\"Corvus%20Umbranox\"&gt;Corvus Umbranox&lt;/a&gt; went missing years ago, yet people believe she was better off without him.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; caused by &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; occurred in the late third era. An &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt; opened up outside the main gate of Anvil, and it let out an army of &lt;a href=\"Dremora\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clannfear\"&gt;Clannfear&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Scamp\"&gt;Scamp&lt;/a&gt;s to attack the city. The &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Ruler%20Temple\"&gt;Cloud Ruler Temple&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Jauffre%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Grandmaster Jauffre&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20Guard\"&gt;Bruma Guard&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Burd\"&gt;Burd&lt;/a&gt; managed to push the daedric army back into the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt;. A greater army later returned, one similar to the one that destroyed Kvatch. The &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; closed the Gate, thus freeing Anvil's forces to join the Hero, &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;, and the combined forces of the eight other cities in Cyrodiil in destroying the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Siege%20Crawler\"&gt;Daedric Siege Crawler&lt;/a&gt; that was heading for Bruma.\nFourth Era.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20171\"&gt;4E 171&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; ravaged Cyrodiil and left the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Empire\"&gt;Mede Empire&lt;/a&gt; in shambles. &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Arannelya\"&gt;Lady Arannelya&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; traveled from &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; through Anvil to get to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. In her wake, the cities of Anvil and Kvatch were besieged, leaving the western Imperial front open to attack. The Siege of Anvil was hard on the Imperials as exemplified by a veteran named &lt;a href=\"Noster%20Eagle-Eye\"&gt;Noster Eagle-Eye&lt;/a&gt; who lost his eye and many comrades at the battle."}

It is the westernmost city in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, located along the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Dibella\"&gt;Chapel of Dibella&lt;/a&gt;, where followers of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; seek her blessing, dominates its skyline. Anvil is home to guildhalls for the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0as well as the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;. In the northeast portion of Anvil lies the statue of the Selkie of West Ferry, who is said to guide sailors along the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20Castle%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil Castle&lt;/a&gt;, home of Countess &lt;a href=\"Millona%20Umbranox\"&gt;Millona Umbranox&lt;/a&gt;, lies on a small island just to the south of the city. Anvil and &lt;a href=\"Skingrad%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt; are the only two cities in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; in which the castle lies outside of the walls. Another landmark in Anvil is the &lt;a href=\"Benirus%20Manor\"&gt;Benirus Manor&lt;/a&gt;, one of the largest houses in Cyrodiil. Anvil has built up a very active trade industry (both legal and otherwise), and much of the town caters directly to sailors. Also, many &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; inhabit Anvil because, according to &lt;a href=\"Sten%20the%20Ugly\"&gt;Sten the Ugly&lt;/a&gt;, they are \"sick of freezing their asses off in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nAnvil is one of the smaller cities in Cyrodiil, with a small residential area and few shops. While the dockside population is usually a varied mix of races, &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; are rarely seen (with the notable exception of famous author &lt;a href=\"Quill-Weave\"&gt;Quill-Weave&lt;/a&gt;) within the city proper. The architecture is comprised of large stone buildings with decorative facades and multiple stories; the image is only slightly marred by a few rundown wooden structures. Outside on the docks, the harbor buildings are much less decorative, clearly emphasizing function over form.\nThe city is ruled by &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Millona%20Umbranox\"&gt;Countess Millona Umbranox&lt;/a&gt;, who has been the sole ruler since the mysterious disappearance of her husband, Count &lt;a href=\"Corvus%20Umbranox\"&gt;Corvus Umbranox&lt;/a&gt;, years earlier. The Umbranox family has always ruled Anvil, dating back to Fasil Umbranox and his defeat of an infamous smuggling ring outside of Anvil Harbor. The Countess herself is well-liked, with many residents expressing their belief that leaving her to rule was the best thing her husband could ever do.\nDescription.\nThe seat of &lt;a href=\"County%20Anvil\"&gt;County Anvil&lt;/a&gt; is by the sea and has quite a diverse population, including several Elves, but also boasts a large population of Nords and &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;, two traditionally sea-going peoples. &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20Castle%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil Castle&lt;/a&gt; is clean and well-ordered, and within the town walls, some houses are bright and cheerful, but others are derelict and abandoned, or shabby and neglected, with plaster fallen in patches from the stonework. The city is ruled by &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Millona%20Umbranox\"&gt;Countess Millona Umbranox&lt;/a&gt;, whose husband, &lt;a href=\"Count%20Corvus%20Umbranox\"&gt;the Count&lt;/a&gt;, went missing some time ago.\nShops, inns, and guilds.\nAnvil is home to both a &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild hall&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild hall&lt;/a&gt;, where guild members can find rest and training. In addition, travelers will find two &lt;a href=\"Taverns%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;taverns&lt;/a&gt;:\nShopping in Anvil is somewhat limited compared to many other cities. There are only two shops in business at the present time:\nCount and Countess.\nThe ruler of Anvil is Countess &lt;a href=\"Millona%20Umbranox\"&gt;Millona Umbranox&lt;/a&gt;. Her husband, &lt;a href=\"Corvus%20Umbranox\"&gt;Corvus Umbranox&lt;/a&gt;, disappeared many years ago, and most of Anvil (and Cyrodiil) think that this was for the best since he was regarded as a loose and frivolous person. The Countess herself does not really share this view and misses her husband dearly, but is an excellent ruler and well-loved by her people. If the Thieves Guild questline is completed, the Grey Fox will resume his previous identity of Corvus and rule alongside his wife. This will be noticed and commented on, but most people are indifferent.\nDistricts of Anvil.\n&lt;a href=\"Anvil%20Castle%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil Castle&lt;/a&gt; lies outside the town walls, South of the town, overlooking the harbor, and is reached by gate from Chapelgate. Within the town wall there are three districts: Chapelgate in the East, Westgate in the West, and Guildgate between Chapelgate and Westgate. Harborside lies outside the town walls, south of the town, and is reached by gate from Westgate District.\nLayout.\nAnvil Castle lies outside the town walls, south of the town, overlooking the harbor, and is reached by gate from Chapelgate. Within the town wall there are three districts: Chapelgate in the east, Westgate in the west, and Guildgate between Chapelgate and Westgate. Harborside lies outside the town walls, south of the town, and is reached by gate from Westgate District.\nOther points of interest.\nOne of the most prominent buildings in Anvil is the large &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Dibella\"&gt;Chapel of Dibella&lt;/a&gt; along the eastern road, complemented by two meditation gardens and an arcade. Recently, rumors have begun circulating of attacks on this lovely chapel, and the appearance of a &lt;a href=\"The%20Prophet%20%28Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%29\"&gt;strange preacher&lt;/a&gt; in the arcade area, located across the road from the chapel. Near the chapel is Anvil's largest private home, the spacious &lt;a href=\"Benirus%20Manor\"&gt;Benirus Manor&lt;/a&gt;, which has been for sale by &lt;a href=\"Velwyn%20Benirus\"&gt;owner&lt;/a&gt; (and apparently not lived in) for quite some time. It is currently inhabited by spirits (can be fixed by doing the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Where%20Spirits%20Have%20Lease\"&gt;Where Spirits Have Lease&lt;/a&gt;,\" from &lt;a href=\"Velwyn%20Benirus\"&gt;Velwyn Benirus&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;). A second &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20House%20%28Anvil%29\"&gt;abandoned house&lt;/a&gt;, significantly less well-kept, is tucked away behind the Fighter's Guild hall.\nDockside.\nThe Anvil Harbor is one of the major access ports to the Abecean Sea, and frequently hosts sailing vessels. As such, the docks house a number of buildings that support the sea-bound shipping industry. The harbor boats can\u00a0be rented by the Hero.\nOff to the southeast of the harbor, on a large hill jutting out from the harbor, sits &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20Castle%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil Castle&lt;/a&gt; itself. A small cove, &lt;a href=\"The%20Lady%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;The Lady Stone&lt;/a&gt; is on the western cliff near the harbor, overlooking the sea.\nChapelgate.\nThis is dominated by the large and imposing Chapel of Dibella. A quiet garden for meditation with a fine statue of &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt; lies between the chapel and the town wall, and across from the chapel is a lovely garden and covered arcade where worshippers are protected from the elements. A cobbled road leads to the gate itself.\nGuildgate.\nThe most prosperous part of Anvil is entered by Guildgate, or Main Gate, or North Gate. The chapterhouses for the Mages and Fighters Guilds are located side-by-side here, with Morvayn's Peacemakers being located to the right immediately upon entering. The Anvil Mages Guild specialises in Restoration magic (with Trainers in Alchemy, Illusion and Destruction) and is led by &lt;a href=\"Carahil\"&gt;Carahil&lt;/a&gt;, who is both an excellent leader and outspoken opponent of Necromancy and other black magics. The Anvil Fighters Guild is led by Azzan and offers Basic and Advanced Trainers in Blade, Block, Blunt and Hand-to-Hand.\nWestgate.\nThis is the residential district of Anvil. The houses here are modest two-story semi-detached dwellings and unassuming. One notable resident is the &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; author &lt;a href=\"Quill-Weave\"&gt;Quill-Weave&lt;/a&gt;.\nHarborside.\nThe dock buildings are mostly built for function and aren't as picturesque as the rest of the town. The general store, Lelles' Quality Mercandise, is located here with its infamously misspelled sign. &lt;a href=\"Mirabelle%20Monet\"&gt;Mirabelle Monet&lt;/a&gt; runs a boarding house which caters solely to sailors. Two ships are currently moored here, both with interesting and slightly disturbing secrets; \"The Serpent's Wake\" and \"The Sea Tub Clarabella\". There is a &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20Lighthouse%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; south of the harbor which is operated by Ulfgar Fog-Eye, though the cellar hides a dark secret.\nCharacters.\nAs a shipping town, Anvil's population constantly changes as sailors come and go. At present, the following citizens are usually found living, or working, in and around Anvil:\nQuests.\nThe city of Anvil is the start of the following quests:\n&lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nFighters Guild quests in Anvil are given by &lt;a href=\"Azzan\"&gt;Azzan&lt;/a&gt;:"}

Anvil was the seat of Imperial Prefect and Count of Anvil &lt;a href=\"Ephrem%20Benirus\"&gt;Ephrem Benirus&lt;/a&gt; as well as the home port of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Navy&lt;/a&gt;.\nDue to the pleasant climate Anvil was an incredibly popular vacation spot among commoners, nobles and even the Emperor Leovic himself. Thanks to the Gold Road and safety of the Abecean Sea enforced by the Navy, Anvil was a center of commerce offering luxury, spawning many taverns and hostels, and attracting entertainers.\nVaren's Rebellion.\nDuring early stages of &lt;a href=\"Varen%27s%20Rebellion\"&gt;Varen's Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Varen%27s%20Wall%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Varen's Wall&lt;/a&gt; was built. &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; was popular among the commoners of the region, who helped to build the wall voluntarily. The purpose of the wall was to protect the Gold Coast against the possible retaliation by the Emperor Leovic.\nThe wall, however, also separated the Gold Coast from the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Highlands\"&gt;Colovian Highlands&lt;/a&gt; and ultimately from the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, diminishing trade and decreasing the stream of travelers. As a result, businesses suffered and many goods that were once common became unavailable.\nAfter Varen Aquilarious led the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Legion\"&gt;Second Legion&lt;/a&gt; out of the Gold Cost to take his rebellion into the heart of the Empire, Count Ephrem Benirus lead four attacks on the city of Kvatch in hopes to seize Varen's property. These attacks, however, were successfully repelled by Varen's nephew &lt;a href=\"Count%20Carolus%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Carolus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20Warders\"&gt;Kvatch Warders&lt;/a&gt;. Each attempted attack significantly reduced the number of available forces stationed in Anvil. Once present Imperial Navy was sent away to deal with the rebellions in the north and east. These events combined rendered the city of Anvil nearly defenseless.\nLocations.\nLandmarks.\n&lt;a href=\"Anvil%20Castle%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Anvil Castle&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnvil Castle is a palace located south of the Anvil, near the eastern end of the harbor. It is built on top of a small island and is accessible by a bridge. The palace was once a defensive fortress, but has been since rebuilt as a luxurious palace.\nAnvil Castle is split into several halls. The audience hall is open to the public. West, east and central halls are closed and only members of the Red Sails, servants and inhabitants are allowed there. Entering the restricted halls will be considered trespassing, and in case of detection a Red Sails Protector will be summoned. The governor's suite can be found at the end of the central halls, and can be accessed by picking a simple lock. The castle has a large balcony connected to the governor's suite.\nAt the southern side of the castle an entrance to a cave system can be found. It leads directly into the restricted parts of the castle. A secret passage from the governors suite leads into these caves as well. It has been used by &lt;a href=\"Governor%20Fortunata%20ap%20Dugal\"&gt;Governor Fortunata ap Dugal&lt;/a&gt; herself to sneak out of the castle. In an effort to prevent someone from sneaking in, &lt;a href=\"River%20Troll\"&gt;River Troll&lt;/a&gt;s were made to inhabit it.\nThe castle was once home to the Imperial Prefect and Count of Anvil, Count Ephrem Benirus. He was a loyal subject of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Leovic\"&gt;Emperor Leovic&lt;/a&gt; and had the Emperor over for visits frequently during summers.\n&lt;a href=\"Anvil%20Lighthouse%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Anvil Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnvil Lighthouse is situated on a small peninsula southwest of the town, south from the &lt;a href=\"%23Anvil%20Wayshrine\"&gt;Anvil Wayshrine&lt;/a&gt;. Ground level of the lighthouse and a &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skeever&lt;/a&gt;-infested cellar have been left unlocked.\nThe lighthouse is surrounded by dark rumors. Some vague evidence that the previous family of residents have been murdered by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Online%20Faction%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; can be found. Keeper of the lighthouse refused to play along the local mob to sink ships coming into harbor, setting himself up as a target for a contract.\n&lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20Trading%20Company%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Gold Coast Trading Company&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocal headquarters of the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20Trading%20Company%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Gold Coast Trading Company&lt;/a&gt; is located at the western part of a city, overlooking the residential square. Much like other guilds the headquarters are located in a relatively large manor house.\nGold Coast Trading Company was once a very influential guild of merchants. It has several operations in the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere. It played a large role in the Red Sails invasion, as the current Governor &lt;a href=\"Governor%20Fortunata%20ap%20Dugal\"&gt;Fortunata ap Dugal&lt;/a&gt; was once a member of the merchant faction. Under her rule, however, company has lost some of its influence.\n&lt;a href=\"Great%20Chapel%20of%20Dibella%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Great Chapel of Dibella&lt;/a&gt;.\nGreat Chapel of Dibella is a massive chapel dedicated to the divine Dibella located at the eastern part of the city, just by the southeastern gate.\nThe Chapel is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Anvil. Local worship of the goddess has changed over time and has now become far more reserved than elsewhere in Tamriel, to some visitors and resident disappointment. Half-naked priests can still be seen dancing inside the chapel.\nFacilities.\nSpecial.\nBounty Board.\nAnvil's Bounty Board can be used to take daily, repeatable quests related to the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt; locations. As a reward the player receives ."}

It is inhabited by &lt;a href=\"slaughterfish%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe city of Anvil lies on the western coast of Cyrodiil, in a region known as the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;. Its ancient walls granite and gray marble have stood for millennia, a testament to the genius and skill of their builders, as they have repelled numerous attacks throughout the city's long history.\nSettlement and founding.\nThe true beginning of Anvil as it is known today is not altogether clear. Popular belief is that it was the first major port town established by &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt; after the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; invasion. But some of the oldest scrolls in the castle library offer obscure counts that the city was actually one of the first &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; settlements on Tamriel after the unknown fate of their ancestral homeland of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;. Other counts argue instead that it was an &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; outpost and later taken over by Reman's forces after his rout and defeat of the Akaviri forces at &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt;.\nMore reliable historical accounts place the city's founding sometime in the first century of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. At first, it was only a stopover, a way station where maritime crews could rest and take on supplies during long voyages. As time went on, a few farsighted people recognized and took advantage of the business opportunity at a maritime way station and built a tavern and an inn for wayfaring seamen. It wasn't long before a town and market sprang up to accommodate the overland travelers and their caravans.\nAs the town grew, so did the docks. By &lt;a href=\"1E%20345\"&gt;1E 345&lt;/a&gt;, it had grown into a prosperous port with commerce from every corner of the continent flowing through it: exotic spices from &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;; rare metals from &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;; potent medicines from &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;; unique armor and weapons from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;; trained warriors and from &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;; expert trackers and hunters from &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;; and master magicians from the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;. By the end of the First Era, it had survived several assaults and sieges, cementing its reputation as indestructible.\nResources and industry.\nAnvil is a port town centered around the sizable harbor outside its western wall and has few resources of its own beyond hunting, fishing and the few silver and iron mines that dot the region, relying instead on the flow of maritime trade crossing its docks. Industry banks mainly on the refinement of these metals and then forming them into weapons and farming equipment.\nMilitary power and defense.\nDue to its position on the western coast, Anvil has a formidable city guard as well as a garrison of Imperial Legionnaires and a small fleet of warships consisting of sloops and frigates. Its walls are thick and constructed of granite and gray marble, two of the hardest and heaviest stones in existence, capable of withstanding withering punishment. The &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; laid siege to the city in &lt;a href=\"2E%20878\"&gt;2E 878&lt;/a&gt; and fled a month later when the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Navy&lt;/a&gt; arrived. While not the most defensible position, being at the crossroads of all western naval forces makes it a much sought-after prize."}

Due to frost and signs of freezing found on the victims, &lt;a href=\"Carahil\"&gt;Carahil&lt;/a&gt; suspects a mage. Because the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Mages\"&gt;Council of Mages&lt;/a&gt; has given the task of investigating the crime to Carahil, she wants the Hero to deal with it and supplies them with intelligence and &lt;a href=\"Scrolls%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;scrolls&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Shield%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Frost Shield&lt;/a&gt; to help with the task.\nWalkthrough.\nRogue mage and Frost Scrolls.\n&lt;a href=\"Travel%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Travel&lt;/a&gt; to Anvil and speak with Carahil; she is a tall Altmeri woman at the front desk of the Anvil Mages Guild. Select the \"Recommendation\" option and learn about a mage who is killing merchants along the Gold Road north of Anvil and west of Kvatch. She instructs the Hero to travel to &lt;a href=\"Brina%20Cross%20Inn\"&gt;Brina Cross Inn&lt;/a&gt; and speak with &lt;a href=\"Arielle%20Jurard%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Arielle Jurard&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt; from the Arcane University. Selecting the \"Rogue Mage\" dialogue option prompts Carahil to explain that the corpses of the mage's victims were burned by frost &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and give three scrolls of frost shield to improve the Hero's chance of victory in the coming fight.\nBrina Cross Inn.\nWalk, ride a &lt;a href=\"Horse%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Fast%20Travel%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fast Travel&lt;/a&gt; to Brina Cross Inn, enter, and speak with Arielle, a brunette &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; woman in brown clothing. As per her instruction, speak with the innkeeper, &lt;a href=\"Christophe%20Marane\"&gt;Christophe Marane&lt;/a&gt;, and rent a room for the night. When he asks about the Hero's destination, select the option of being a merchant. Upon doing so, an unavoidable conversation with &lt;a href=\"Caminalda\"&gt;Caminalda&lt;/a&gt; occurs where she expresses concern for the Hero due to the recent murders.\nGo up the stairs and open the last door on the right. Arielle follows and tells the Hero to get some\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Rest%23Oblivion\"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;, then\u00a0start traveling down the Gold Road first thing upon rising. It is mandatory to sleep for at least one hour; sleeping more does not alter the coming events much.\nPreparing.\nLeave the inn. Two battlemages, Arielle and &lt;a href=\"Roliand%20Hanus\"&gt;Roliand Hanus&lt;/a&gt;, will be waiting outside. While Arielle says not to talk to them, it does not alter the events if either is spoken to. Exit the inn's enclosure via the gate and head towards Kvatch along the road. Eventually the murderous mage will approach the Hero and initiate dialogue.\nThe Battle.\nThe murderous mage is Caminalda. &lt;a href=\"Leveled\"&gt;Leveled&lt;/a&gt;, she employs a frost &lt;a href=\"touch\"&gt;touch&lt;/a&gt; spell, a &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Skeleton\"&gt;summon skeleton&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Clannfear%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;clannfear&lt;/a&gt; spell, and &lt;a href=\"Reflect%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Reflect Magicka&lt;/a&gt;. Roliand and Arielle join the battle immediately, wearing leveled &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;heavy armor&lt;/a&gt; that caps at &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;steel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Summon%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Summoned&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt; and offensive scrolls can help, since regular spells deplete &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;heath&lt;/a&gt; if used on her. If Arielle or Roliand die in the battle, the outcome is not altered.\nUsing &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchanted weapons&lt;/a&gt; can help, since she reflects spells cast at her. Basic weapons are also sufficient, as she only wears a &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Velvet%20Outfit\"&gt;Blue Velvet Outfit&lt;/a&gt;. Dispatch the mage and take the key from her corpse. She also carries health and sorcery &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, Arielle expresses her gratitude.\nReward.\nReturn to Carahil to be rewarded with the recommendation. If the key was looted from Caminalda's corpse, it opens her room at the inn, where a &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold coins&lt;/a&gt; awaits."}

The plane is first seen in the add-on . The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; has to visit the realm as part of the main questline in &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; for the add-on.\nBlack Books.\nApocrypha can only be accessed by reading the Black Books while in Solstheim. There are seven Black Books. Many can be found through the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Lost%20Knowledge\"&gt;Lost Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nLocation.\nAs with Hermaeus Mora, Apocrypha is always changing and never constant. Its environment is filled with hidden and forbidden knowledge, and dangerous to the unwary. This infinite plane of reality is dominated by an endless, roiling sea of toxic green liquid, where giant oily tentacles slither and writhe about the waves, whipping at anyone who gets too close. What little solid ground there is consists of several archipelagos and cathedral-like buildings composed of heavily weathered stone, connected by constantly-shifting bridges built of greasy black metal. Several bridges and hallways even move on their own, stretching and bending like tentacles to render other areas accessible or hinder intruders.\nThe most prominent feature of Apocrypha, however, is the overwhelming abundance of books that make up Hermaeus Mora's library. Giant stacks of reading material break the surface of the poisonous sea, numerous shelves that line the halls and walls are literally crammed to bursting with ancient scrolls and smoldering journals, heaps of books and papers litter the floors, and even entire buildings are constructed from twisting stacks of books. These books are protected and maintained by the &lt;a href=\"Seeker\"&gt;Seeker&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Lurker\"&gt;Lurker&lt;/a&gt;s, who act as the principal security force of Apocrypha.\nApocrypha is divided into several isolated regions, each accessible by a different black book. These regions are then separated into one or more chapters, each reachable by a book that teleports the Dragonborn from one chapter to another. At the end of the last chapter is a larger book which provides the hidden knowledge of the black book for the region and acts as a portal to return to Solstheim. Some chapters may be accessed out of numerical order and some can be completely ignored.\nContainers called \"pods\" and \"vessels\" can be looted in Apocrypha. Wall-mounted stations called \"&lt;a href=\"Font%20of%20Magicka\"&gt;fonts of Magicka&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Font%20of%20Stamina\"&gt;fonts of Stamina&lt;/a&gt;\" can be used to restore Magicka and Stamina, respectively.\nAtmosphere.\nThe sky is defined by a hazy green cloud cover with a huge swirling void in the center similar to the one seen in the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cairn\"&gt;Soul Cairn&lt;/a&gt;. There are various places in the sky where what appears to be a portal is open and the ever-present tentacles are sprouting out. Hermaeus Mora himself also uses these portals when he wishes to communicate with anyone while they are in his realm and sometimes even when they are not in his realm.\nDangers and threats.\nThe realm is very dangerous, as the black liquid is toxic and will kill anyone in seconds who happens to fall into it. Even venturing close to the edge of the liquid is dangerous, as tentacles may emerge from the water to strike at the Dragonborn. There are also shifting areas of darkness in some books of Apocrypha which will continuously damage the Dragonborn while they are in the darkness. The simplest solution is to move quickly from one patch of light to another. However, any illumination of the darkness such as using a &lt;a href=\"Torch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt; or spells such as &lt;a href=\"Candlelight%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Candlelight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magelight%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Magelight&lt;/a&gt; will prevent the damage effect for as long as the illumination lasts and the Dragonborn is within the area of illumination. Thus, Candlelight is particularly effective as it moves with the Dragonborn and unlike a torch, does not require being equipped. Floating wisp-like lanterns can also be used to shield the Dragonborn from darkness-based damage. The &lt;a href=\"Become%20Ethereal\"&gt;Become Ethereal&lt;/a&gt; shout will protect the Dragonborn from the toxic black liquid, but not the dark areas.\nThe Seekers and Lurkers are also potent in combat. The more common Seekers are easily capable of protecting themselves and can create doubles of themselves to assist in combat, as well as being able to turn invisible and even teleport. The Lurkers, though rarer, are far more dangerous to lower-level players, dealing serious melee damage with their claws and brandishing a variety of tentacle-based attacks, including spewing out tentacle-sprouting liquid that can ensnare the player or spawning a mass of damaging tentacles from their foot.

In return to access to the infinite knowledge stored in Apocrypha, the ciphers tend to the archives and assist in cataloging and sorting. Many scholars and mages visit Apocrypha and do so in solitude, seeking their own knowledge for their own ends, but few mortals find themselves becoming a cipher. In Cipher's Midden, the scribes are given a safe haven and a place to form a community based on knowledge and mutual veneration of Hermaeus Mora.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Apocrypha and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralized areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nApocrypha features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests are shared with the Telvanni Peninsula and tie into the overarching Shadow Over Morrowind story, but it is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in Apocrypha. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another. &lt;a href=\"Repeatable%20quests\"&gt;Repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nEleven Skyshards can be found in Apocrypha totaling in three &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt; and two left over. The rest of the Skyshards shown in the zone guide can be found in the Telvanni Peninsula. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected. Note that the number of the Skyshard is preserved according to its order in the &lt;a href=\"Necrom%20Skyshard%20Hunter\"&gt;Necrom Skyshard Hunter&lt;/a&gt; achievement.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\n books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Apocrypha and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

They are also found in the vicinity of &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;necromancers&lt;/a&gt;, as well as battling &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Mage\"&gt;Ice Mage&lt;/a&gt;s in the wilds of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nCombat.\nOut of the mages stationed at Fellglow Keep, these foes are the most dangerous. They are difficult to kill with a melee &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;, because they keep their distance from the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, and shoot deadly blasts of fire from long range. These attacks do quite a bit of damage (unless you are a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, then the attacks are only half as damaging), and to make matters worse, they can summon &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Flame Atronachs&lt;/a&gt;, who are tough enemies to kill, and explode if you manage to do so, dealing even more &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire damage&lt;/a&gt; if you are in melee range. If you even attempt to charge a Fire Mage to kill him with a melee weapon you are a sitting duck. They will kill you in seconds with their high-powered fire spells. Because of these reasons, they should be highest priority target in any encounter.\nThe recommended weapon to use against the Apprentice Fire Mage is the &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Arrows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; fired inflict heavy damage, and it is best used from a long range, so you can snipe the Fire Mage to death. Because mages tend to have low health and wear robes, a single &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt; attack from a bow is the best way to take them out, especially if you have high &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Archery&lt;/a&gt; and/or Sneak skill. Magic is also recommended, because of the damage it does. However, it can't reach a target from a very long range.\nLoot.\nThe Apprentice Fire Mage drops the following:"}

Since coming to Elsweyr, Taz has grown fond of the land and does not intend to return to Hammerfell soon, despite being confident that he can now best all six of his brothers at once.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Bane%20of%20Dragons\"&gt;Bane of Dragons&lt;/a&gt;.\nTaz provides the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; with information on the training program and the trails they need to complete as a part of it, including the optional objectives. After the Vestige recovers the tablet as part of the trial of knowledge, Taz can be found in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Stitches\"&gt;Stitches&lt;/a&gt; where he can administer a three question test to the Vestige on dragon lore. After the Vestige has completed all of the trials, Taz can be found outside Rimmen again with Samara.\nDialogue.\nTell me about yourself. Why did you join the Defense Force? \"Me? I come from a long line of swordmasters that go all the way back to Yokuda. In Hammerfell, my father always complained that my blade skills paled in comparison to those of my six brothers. Recently, he decided to send my to Elsweyr to train.\"\nAfter talking with Captain Samara:\n\"I see you've agreed to the trials, how exiting! You will not regret you efforts, I promise you. Captain Samara has put her heart and soul into the Elsweyr Defense Force. Each trial was thought through with care.\"\nAfter recovering the Tablet of Dragon Slaying:\n\"Oh, there you are! Lovely to see you again. Do you have a tablet for me to inspect?\""}

When the Vestige informs her of what happened to &lt;a href=\"Wuuthrad%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wuuthrad&lt;/a&gt; and ask who is in charge of the fort, she will point them to &lt;a href=\"Thane%20Unnvald%20Ironhand\"&gt;Thane Unnvald Ironhand&lt;/a&gt;, though she will warn you that he may not be willing to meet visitors at this time. \nThe Vestige can head into the Thane's Manor and speak with Unnvald; he will not believe that harm has come to Wuuthrad and will tell them to leave. His housecarl, &lt;a href=\"Housecarl%20Thorulf\"&gt;Thorulf&lt;/a&gt;, will reassure him that it is impossible that Wuuthrad has been shattered. The Vestige can speak to the housecarl and he will tell them that there are no rumors of shards of wuuthrad in the area, and that they should leave. As the Vestige heads off, the thane's granddaughter, &lt;a href=\"Hallfrida\"&gt;Hallfrida&lt;/a&gt;, will tell the Vestige to meet her outside. She will tell them that her grandfather and his housecarl have changed recently, and that Thorulf has been directing the household, telling Unnvald what to do. Hallfrida suspects something sinister and asks the Vestige to search Thorulf's quarters. \nThe Vestige can then head back inside. The door to Thorulf's quarters will be locked, so it is necessary to ask around to see who has the key. While exploring the house, the Vestige can find a copy of \"&lt;a href=\"Homilies%20of%20Blessed%20Almalexia\"&gt;Homilies of Blessed Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;\", on the top floor to the east. The key can be obtained from &lt;a href=\"Domar\"&gt;Domar&lt;/a&gt;; he can be intimidated or bribed to retrieve the key. Once the Vestige has it, they can head into Thorulf's quarters. They will find three clues here that Thorulf is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Worm Cult&lt;/a&gt;. On the bookshelf to the right of the door is a copy of \"&lt;a href=\"Arkay%20the%20Enemy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Arkay the Enemy&lt;/a&gt;\", in the cabinet is a bloodstained dagger, and on the desk there is a \"&lt;a href=\"Note%20from%20Gullveig\"&gt;Note from Gullveig&lt;/a&gt;\", the necromancer from &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Vestige can bring these pieces of evidence to Hallfrida on the top floor. She will come up with a plan to expose Thorulf as a liar and a necromancer. Thorulf has apparently claimed that the Thane's sword, &lt;a href=\"Bonebane\"&gt;Bonebane&lt;/a&gt;, was destroyed in an undead attack. Hallfrida asks you to find and retrieve this sword from its resting place at the monument south of Fullhelm. \nThe monument is actually to the southeast rather than south, at the &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; border. It will be guarded by three undead. After the Vestige dispatches them, they can head up the ladder and retrieve Bonebane from the chest. With Bonebane, the Vestige can head back to Fullhelm and speak with Hallfrida. After showing her the blade, Sergeant Sjarakki will come running into the hall to announce that the undead are attacking. She will order everyone who can fight to get outside and defend the fort. The Vestige can talk to Hallfrida again and she will tell them that exposing Thorulf will have to wait until the undead are dealt with. This will finish the quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Thunder%20Breaks\"&gt;The Thunder Breaks&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

Speaking to an aprax Elf may result in being shunned as well.\nIn contrast to apraxis, one's praxis, or inclusion in Altmeri society, is represented by a \"calian,\" a small, fragile sphere of \"milky aethequartz and sun-blown glass,\" which Mer safeguard dearly. When a Mer is deemed apraxic, their calian is symbolically shattered.

This will lower their defense and make them flee from the attacker. Try to separate them from their group to make the battle easier. While waiting for the Shout to recharge, provoke them to attack the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; and quickly sprint behind them.

Maybe it's vain, but I like the idea of some anthropologist in the far future learning even just a bit more about the lives we live because I took the time to jot down my thoughts and feelings. I could probably fill this journal with just what's racing through my head at this moment, so I'll just say that \"elated\" doesn't begin to describe it.\nThere's so much history here. Thousands of years' worth of relics and texts outlining the history of our people back before &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Saint Veloth&lt;/a&gt; lead us to holy Resdayn. It's not so neat as all that, of course, it's thousands of pieces of the puzzle all strewn and scattered, in need of a guiding hand to fit it all together. It's almost overwhelming. I'm so honored that I get to be part of piecing it all together.\nI must sound like a great fool to Tythis. Always rambling on about the implications of some small fragment of kwama shell's significance to the agrarian development of our early settlements. But he smiles regardless. I like to think he still wears that smile underneath his mask.\nSo much of the Temple's attention goes into the building of the holy city. It's important work, I know, but expeditions of historical sites are practically non-existent these days. The Master Historian has begun accepting relics brought to us by treasure hunters. I have reservations about encouraging laymen to plunder tombs. Can we be certain these treasures really came from unclaimed ruins? What delicate clues did these enterprising adventurers destroy in their reckless hunt for valuables? It's not my place to question the Master Historian though, he knows far far more about these matters than I do.\nA find! Oh, what a find! A band of relic hunters braved some of the worst of the Ashlands and returned with a statue like nothing I've ever seen. The Master Historian's eyes widened two-fold at the sight of it. I'd never seen him react so obviously to anything, really, and he assigned its study to me! I'm honored he entrusts me with something of such obvious significance. I must have really impressed him with my report on the Dwemeri influence on &lt;a href=\"Chimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; garb in the latter half of the Merethic Era. I can't wait to tell Tythis.\nSometimes I forget my brother is an &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ordinator&lt;/a&gt;. The moment I mentioned the new find he was practically interrogating me. Now that I'm involved in something groundbreaking, he's suddenly interested in hearing the details. He's so protective sometimes. I think his position only makes it worse. I assured him that the Master Historian would never expose me to anything dangerous. I'm sure he'll be supervising my study closely anyway.\nCare to guess who got their own private study? Why am I posing myself rhetorical questions? Please disregard that future anthropologists. It was me, by the way. The Master Historian wanted to ensure I was kept away from any distractions while I began my study of the relic. He gave me some encouraging words before leaving me to my work, but I could tell he was nervous. He's taking a great risk leaving this find to a novice. I have to prove that his faith in me was not misplaced.\nI think there's some jealousy among the historians. I catch a few side-long glances when heading to my study these days and I swear I can hear them whispering just out of earshot. I can't make out what they're saying, but I can guess. I hope we're beyond that kind of pettiness by the time anyone reads this. I've managed to brush away most of the caked ash that was obscuring the details of the statue. It's a much more advanced piece of art than we see from Ashlander tribes. The tool work alone implies access to metalworking facilities. The symbols adorning the body aren't familiar to me though.\nI found some old reference to a settlement called Kogoruhn that was roughly near where the statue was found, but much of the pages describing it were marked out. I asked permission from the Master Historian to see the restricted texts, but he told me to focus on the statue. He promised to bring me the relevant texts when he had the chance. For now, I think I'll start taking rubbings of the statue. I'll have to close the door tonight. The others are getting bolder in their spying and the sotto voce is becoming distracting.\nI know what it is. I know what I am. The naked stone in my hands was electric. Jolting me awake and out of the hollow stupor I was cursed to live through all this time. The Temple thinks it can bury the truth, but the only ones they are blinding are themselves. Our legacy lives on. Our House will be made whole again. It's been calling to me all this time, I just couldn't hear it.\nThe old man's footsteps approach. Here to deliver more of his lies and cover up the great betrayal at the heart of this false Temple. He will pay for his crimes against us. I've wasted enough time in the thrall of these deceivers. Home is calling."}

She plans to call the series \"The Paths of the Doomstones.\"The Argonian authoress declined to reveal any details of the characters and themes of these books. However, Quill-Weave clearly has quite ambitious plans for this series, since she plans titles to correspond with each of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;'s twenty-one Doomstones. These ancient monuments are scattered throughout Cyrodiil, and each is known in legend by its own name.\"I always carefully research my subjects,\" Quill-Weave says, \"and I find no evidence at all to support the popular notion that these runestones were once artifacts of great magical power.\" She noted that thirteen of these stones are associated with the common birthsigns by which people have always marked the aspects of the heavens when children are born. \"Such stones as the '&lt;a href=\"The%20Mage%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mage Stone&lt;/a&gt;' and the '&lt;a href=\"The%20Serpent%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Serpent Stone&lt;/a&gt;' were certainly associated with the primitive sky worships of the Beast Folk of the Mythic Era. Other stones, like the '&lt;a href=\"Aetherius%20Stone\"&gt;Aetherius Stone&lt;/a&gt;' and the '&lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Stone\"&gt;Magnus Stone&lt;/a&gt;' were also doubtless associated with other long-forgotten cults.\"The Courier asked Quill-Weave why she might choose to abandon the popular tales of thieves, outlaws, murderers, and low-lifes that have made her so famous in Cyrodiil and throughout the Empire. She explained that she has long sought material with more mature and epic themes to celebrate the noble virtues of Cyrodiil and the Empire. She assured the Courier that she will fill the Doomstones series with the lusty and colorful characters we've come to know and love. \"But this time,\" Quill-Weave says, \"my characters will uproot trees, devastate cities, and summon rains of boiling blood before slipping away to explore the private and intimate mysteries of the heart.\"\"\""}

This one decided to take a different approach. Does the Order of the New Moon represent a new cult born out of the chaos of the &lt;a href=\"rage%20of%20Dragons\"&gt;rage of Dragons&lt;/a&gt;, or is it an ancient religion resurfacing from the depths of history?\nThis one was able to speak to a recruiter, who was more than happy to describe in vivid detail the creeds and tenets of their beliefs. While these &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; acknowledge &lt;a href=\"Jone\"&gt;Jone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jode\"&gt;Jode&lt;/a&gt;, they believe that a &lt;a href=\"New%20Moon\"&gt;New Moon&lt;/a&gt; will soon rise that will outshine them both. They believe that the path to salvation and power lies in this New Moon and not in the worship of &lt;a href=\"gods\"&gt;gods&lt;/a&gt; that remain silent and distant despite the desperate prayers of the faithful.\nThe Order of the New Moon definitely attempts to appeal to those suffering under the current troubles that have been compounded by the appearance of the Dragons. For this reason, they have attracted mostly the poor and the homeless to their ranks. This one observes that the cult uses false promises and fear as a recruitment also seem intent on appeasing the Dragons rather than in combating them. Very curious.\nThis one has found references to a similar group that was active in the ancient past. Which brings us back to the original question: Is the Order of the New Moon a recently organized cult or does it represent the resurgence of an ancient religion that was biding its time before making a return?

Recruiting\nRecruitment must be undertaken by those who are good judges of character. Too many underfed candidates have entered our ranks. These weak ones will not carry us forward to our goals.

Only with a clear and determined mind will the Order give rise to the New Moon.\nV. Ritual\nAt some point, every recruit will be called upon to attend our special rituals.

You will learn why soon enough.\nUntil the New Moon rises, work tirelessly. Work effortlessly. And revere the Dragons that revere our New Moon!"}

It accentuates this fact with its distinctive greenery and landscaping.\nFounded by pure whim of &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Lord Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, the city is a model of the Madgod's own perfectly envisioned epicenter and city.\nAtmosphere.\nFirst time visitors to New Sheoth are often impressed by the warmth, generosity, and general good humor of its residents. Visitors are welcomed with open arms, and generally made to feel as if they are part of the large New Sheoth family. The sheer scope of the sights and sounds in the city can be daunting to the new visitor.\nDistricts.\nVisitors will find the city is divided into three main sections: &lt;a href=\"Bliss\"&gt;Bliss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crucible\"&gt;Crucible&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"New%20Sheoth%20Palace\"&gt;Palace&lt;/a&gt;. Bliss and Crucible house the majority of residential and commercial buildings in the city, while the Palace area houses the magnificent Palace of Sheogorath, as well as the residences of the reigning dukes of &lt;a href=\"Mania\"&gt;Mania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dementia\"&gt;Dementia&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough located in the same city, it will soon be found that Bliss and Crucible offer distinct experiences. The shining parapets and golden roads of Bliss stand in stark contrast to the rustic buildings and unpaved streets of Crucible.\nTravelers interested in a bustling nightlife and fine cuisine might prefer time spent in Bliss, renowned for its extravagant galas and spirited affairs. Visitors who seek a quieter experience would do well to spend their time exploring Crucible, where &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Seducer%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Dark Seducer&lt;/a&gt; patrols encourage a more serene way of life. No matter the taste, New Sheoth promises an experience like no other.\nArriving in New Sheoth.\nTravelers in New Sheoth will arrive at its gate from either the highlands of &lt;a href=\"Mania\"&gt;Mania&lt;/a&gt; or the swampy lowlands of &lt;a href=\"Dementia\"&gt;Dementia&lt;/a&gt;. Many make the mistake of hurrying directly to the gates of the city without exploring the beautiful and majestic countryside outside the city walls. This is certainly a mistake, as the forests and glades of the Shivering Isles are unlike those found anywhere else in all the realms.\nAccommodations.\nThis is a list of all of the accommodations in New Sheoth.\nExpensive.\n&lt;a href=\"Raven%20Biter\"&gt;Raven Biter&lt;/a&gt; and his wife, &lt;a href=\"Sheer%20Meedish\"&gt;Sheer Meedish&lt;/a&gt; run a fine restaurant and inn in the Bliss district of New Sheoth. The rooms are nicely appointed, and the food is above average for the area. Its wine is highly recommended, it is some of the best in the city. Many travelers find lunch to be an especially good time to visit the Choosy Beggar. Though the prices are no lower, the earlier hour often finds Sheer Meedish in a more accommodating mood.\nModerate.\nDon't be fooled by the name. Sickly Bernice's Taphouse is exactly what a traveler would expect of an inn located in downtown Crucible. The lodgings, while not as opulent as those found at the nearby Choosy Beggar, are satisfactory. &lt;a href=\"Sickly%20Bernice\"&gt;Sickly Bernice&lt;/a&gt; is an affable hostess, when she is well enough to work. The food is palatable, as are the beverages.\nShopping.\nIf looking for...well...anything, Common Treasures in Bliss is a good place to start. Trader &lt;a href=\"Tilse%20Areleth\"&gt;Tilse Areleth&lt;/a&gt; has a wide assortment of wares available to the discerning customer. She is also more than willing to negotiate a good price for those unwanted items one may find in their travels.\nThere is not a finer weapon shop to be found in all of New Sheoth. &lt;a href=\"Cutter\"&gt;Cutter&lt;/a&gt; runs a fine establishment, and usually keeps a good variety of weapons in stock and ready for use. She will do repairs on the spot, and she seems to take extra care with the bladed weapons. This shop is not to be missed.\nIf looking for reading material on ones journey, this is the place to get it. &lt;a href=\"Sontaire\"&gt;Sontaire&lt;/a&gt; is a very, very friendly bookseller with a keen eye for more than just books. People won't be disappointed if they spend some of their hard earned gold in this establishment.\nIf it is armor one is in the mood to buy, look no further than the Missing Pauldron in Bliss. Recently reopened under new manager &lt;a href=\"Dumag%20gro-Bonk\"&gt;Dumag gro-Bonk&lt;/a&gt;, the shop seems to be doing quite well. Dumag will be happy to sell some new armor, repair old favorites, or just sit awhile and tell the rather long and interesting story of his life.\nMany adventurers don't like to travel without a full spell book, and &lt;a href=\"Earil\"&gt;Earil's&lt;/a&gt; is the place to go in New Sheoth to stock up on the latest in spell making. He sells a wide assortment of magicks, including some wonderful, low cost &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Disease%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;cure disease&lt;/a&gt; spells. It sometimes seems as if time stands still as one browse through his excellent selection of spells. Highly recommended.\nIt is an odd assortment of items, to be sure, but it is never a dull day when one visits Things Found in Crucible. Owner &lt;a href=\"Ahjazda\"&gt;Ahjazda&lt;/a&gt; has scoured the realm in search of the most intriguing and varied assortment of magical items not to be found almost anywhere else. Take some time and browse around. One never knows what might be there."}

The courtyard is divided in half between Dementia and Mania with connections to &lt;a href=\"Crucible\"&gt;Crucible&lt;/a&gt; in the south, and &lt;a href=\"Bliss\"&gt;Bliss&lt;/a&gt; to the north.\nIn the House of Mania, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Thadon\"&gt;Lord Thadon&lt;/a&gt; lives with his servants.

Behind the throne chair is the Font of Madness and the Fountainhead with plants from Mania on one side and Dementia on the other.\nOn each side are several pedestals. Each time the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; completes a part of the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;main questline&lt;/a&gt;, a trophy of their triumph will be placed on them.\nHouse of Mania.\nThe House of Mania's courtroom exits to the Halcyon Conservatory where Lord Thadon can usually be found painting or relaxing. In the conservatory are specimens of typical plant life in Mania.\nLord Thadon's private quarters can be accessed from here, but it is locked until a key is acquired or the lock has been picked. In his quarters one can find his bedroom, a small room for relaxing and making the drug &lt;a href=\"Felldew%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Felldew&lt;/a&gt; and a dining area.\nAnother exit leads to the sleeping quarters for the servants, both Wide-Eye and Gundlar can be seen sleeping in the same bed.\nHouse of Dementia.\nThe House of Dementia's courtroom exits out to the Duchess' private quarters. A private garden with specimens of typical plant life in Dementia can be found here. This part is locked until access is made during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Ritual%20of%20Dementia\"&gt;Ritual of Dementia&lt;/a&gt;\" when a key is given to the Hero so they can proceed and hunt Lady Syl.\nOther exits lead to the servant's quarters. There is also an exit to the torture chamber with cages and other equipment used to torture victims. &lt;a href=\"Herdir\"&gt;Herdir&lt;/a&gt; is usually found here as he is the torturer for Lady Syl.\nPalace Grounds.\nThe palace grounds lead to the House of Mania, House of Dementia, &lt;a href=\"Crucible\"&gt;Crucible&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bliss\"&gt;Bliss&lt;/a&gt;, and Sheogorath's palace. Two Obelisks of Order stand on both sides with a small garden depicting which House they belong to.\nThe entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Greenmote%20Silo\"&gt;Greenmote Silo&lt;/a&gt;, featured in the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Ritual%20of%20Mania\"&gt;Ritual of Mania&lt;/a&gt;,\" is hidden beneath a bust of Sheogorath on the west side of the grounds. If you are there before, there is a chance that a Golden Saint will be standing outside of the bust that Wide-Eye opens and will tell the Hero the area is off limits. \nThe Palace Grounds are the battlefield for the confrontation with Jyggalag and the Forces of Order. The origins of the two Obelisks of Order in the grounds are unknown, though it is likely they are leftovers from a previous &lt;a href=\"Greymarch%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Greymarch&lt;/a&gt;."}

King &lt;a href=\"Lysandus\"&gt;Lysandus&lt;/a&gt; agreed to be Betony's liege, on advice of many, including his archpriest of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, Lord &lt;a href=\"Vanech\"&gt;Vanech&lt;/a&gt;. While Betony is a prosperous fishing island and well-placed strategically, the vassalage of Betony was primarily an act of charity. Lysandus knew that if someone did not help Betony, it would fall to the pirates, if not to someone worse.\nUnfortunately, &lt;a href=\"Camaron%20of%20Sentinel\"&gt;King Camaron&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; did not agree. Citing a two hundred year old contract, obliquely if not illegally written to suggest that Betony was a traditional holding of the Kingdom of Sentinel, Camaron declared war. The majority of his advisors, being warlords in a traditionally bellicose country, supported their king in this. The Chief Counselor, a woman called &lt;a href=\"The%20Oracle\"&gt;The Oracle&lt;/a&gt;, foresaw death and defeat in the war, but her wisdom was stifled and she was banished from court. Camaron should have listened to her.\nA few scrimages of the War of Betony went to Sentinel, but the major battles were all won by Daggerfall. King Lysandus, his heir Prince &lt;a href=\"Gothryd\"&gt;Gothryd&lt;/a&gt;, and the general of the army &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Bridwell\"&gt;Lord Bridwell&lt;/a&gt; were fine leaders and warriors as well, and the Battle of the Bluffs and the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Craghold\"&gt;Siege of Craghold&lt;/a&gt; both went to Daggerfall.\nThe war might have been won with one more victory, but for an unusual domestic incident in King Lysandus' court. The king's mother, the dowager queen &lt;a href=\"Nulfaga\"&gt;Nulfaga&lt;/a&gt;, had been uneasy about the war since its beginning, but she now began to have visions of cataclysm. She saw the death of her beloved son should the war continue. Ebullient by his success, King Lysandus refused to listen to her fears until Nulfaga left court. Lysandus then realized how certain she was about his impending death. He began to actively negotiate a peace treaty with Sentinel, using the neutral lordship of &lt;a href=\"Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt; as facilitator.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Treaty of Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt; was never to be. King Camaron was initially civil, as the losing side of a war is often civil, but when he realized that the proposed treaty would have included a formal declaration that the kingdoms of Sentinel and Daggerfall would share Betony, he flew into a rage. With no thought for the protocol of attacking a neutral peaceable lordship, Camaron order his army to riot through Reich Gradkeep. First the halls of the palace, and then the streets of the capitol ran red with blood. It was only with the support of the Daggerfall army that the chaos was brought under relative control. The Sentinel army fled to the &lt;a href=\"Yeorth%20Burrowland\"&gt;Yeorth Burrowland&lt;/a&gt;, and the Daggerfall army chased them as far as the &lt;a href=\"Ravennian%20Forest\"&gt;Ravennian Forest&lt;/a&gt; before making camp.\nOne week later, after each had a chance to send for reinforcements and plan their strategies, the armies met in the field that separated them, the flowering meadowland called &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cryngaine%20Field\"&gt;Cryngaine Field&lt;/a&gt;. In the heat of the clash, an unnatural fog spread over the field, blinding all combatants. When the mist finally lifted, King Lysandus' body was found, his throat pierced by an unmarked arrow.\nDaggerfall did not waste any time in mourning; young prince Gothryd, who had shown great bravery in battle and was very popular among the troops, was crowned King of Daggerfall just behind the battle lines, and he ordered the army onward. Perhaps it was the sight of the brave young warrior turned king appearing on the battlefield in full regalia that inspired the Daggerfall army, perhaps the battle would have turned regardless, Sentinel began to panic. King Gothryd met King Camaron before the &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; had retreated, and the two monarchs fought. Both were excellent warriors, but Gothryd was a more skillful swordsman, and Camaron fell that day. Lord &lt;a href=\"Oresme\"&gt;Oresme&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; formally surrendered to Daggerfall, giving up all rights to Betony officially. He later commited suicide on the ship back to Sentinel.\nPeace was a difficult process for the cities and towns on both sides of the Iliac Bay. As part of the formal peace treaty, King Gothryd asked for the hand of Princess &lt;a href=\"Aubk-i\"&gt;Aubk-i&lt;/a&gt;, only daughter of the late King Camaron and the Queen Regent &lt;a href=\"Akorithi\"&gt;Akorithi&lt;/a&gt;. The request was intended to restore friendship between the kingdoms, and it was partially successful though many in the royal court of Sentinel viewed the princess as more a prisoner of war than a bond to &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe only surviving member of the ruling family of Reich Gradkeep was a sickly infant, so the councilors of state appealed to Lord &lt;a href=\"Auberon%20Flyte\"&gt;Auberon Flyte&lt;/a&gt;, a cousin of Lord Graddock, to rule the lordship in regency. Lord Flyte accepted, and his strong, almost dictatorial style was just what Reich Gradkeep needed to restore order after the bloody Treaty of Reich Gradkeep. His subjects were grateful that when the infant heir died, they not only elevated his wife &lt;a href=\"Doryanna\"&gt;Doryanna&lt;/a&gt; and him from regents to rulers, they agreed to rename the lordship in his honor. Reich Gradkeep became &lt;a href=\"Anticlere%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Anticlere&lt;/a&gt;, named after his ancestral home.\nThe horrors of the War of Betony still live on, even in Anticlere. Whether Daggerfall and Sentinel will be able to use the marriage of King &lt;a href=\"Gothryd\"&gt;Gothryd&lt;/a&gt; and Princess Aubk-i as a symbol of peace rather than discord is something that only the future can show.\n-- 14 &lt;a href=\"Suns%20Dawn\"&gt;Suns Dawn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"3E%20404\"&gt;3E 404&lt;/a&gt;"}

The objective of this quest for the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt;, is to eliminate the entire Draconis family, five targets in total.\nThe only information given at the start of the mission is the location of &lt;a href=\"Perennia%20Draconis\"&gt;Perennia Draconis&lt;/a&gt;, the mother of the family. She is located at &lt;a href=\"Applewatch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Applewatch&lt;/a&gt; farm just west of &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\n&lt;a href=\"Perennia%20Draconis\"&gt;Perennia Draconis&lt;/a&gt;.\nHead to Applewatch and speak to her, extract the location of her children, and then kill her. The best way to do this is to pretend to be the shopping service she has hired to send gifts to all her kids. She'll &lt;a href=\"Draconis%20Gift%20List\"&gt;provide a list&lt;/a&gt; of all the other Draconis family members as well as 100 for the errand. Kill her and then move on.\nIf she is killed without being asked about the children, the list can still be found on her body. If she isn't killed in one go, she will run out of the cottage and run fast and it can be hard to keep up with her. Not only is it difficult to catch her, one of the possible roads she may run on will pass an Imperial Guard, who she will call for help. This adds a bounty, and the Imperial Guard to deal with.\n&lt;a href=\"Caelia%20Draconis\"&gt;Caelia Draconis&lt;/a&gt;.\nCaelia is a city watch guard in &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt; who works a night shift. She is constantly armed and armored, making her difficult to take down in one strike. Because of this, there are several possible methods to kill her without earning a large bounty or provoking the other Leyawiin guards.\nCaelia finishes her watch at 7 am. She will then go to a private room upstairs in the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Sisters%20Inn\"&gt;Three Sisters Inn&lt;/a&gt;, where she will be alone. This is the ideal time to attack her, as it is the only time there are no other guards in the area.\nMethods.\nAt any point, the Hero can talk to her and taunt her by saying that they need her dead, causing her to attack. If the Hero is not strong enough to kill her alone, there are a number of ways to get others to kill her:\n&lt;a href=\"Andreas%20Draconis\"&gt;Andreas Draconis&lt;/a&gt;.\nAndreas is located at &lt;a href=\"The%20Drunken%20Dragon%20Inn\"&gt;The Drunken Dragon Inn&lt;/a&gt;. There is a guard always posted in his room facing him most times (on some VERY RARE occasions he will turn away allowing the Hero to sneak up on Andreas). This makes it very difficult to kill him directly. However, there are several ways to trick him into attacking the Hero, allowing them to kill him in self-defense:\nIt is possible to kill him directly. When he's asleep, the Hero can hide from the guard behind the counter, and can use a sneak attack to kill Andreas. They can also hide on the steps behind the guard and use a bow to attack (a &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Paralyze&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Health%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Damage Health&lt;/a&gt; effects can help non-archers, while still preserving their stealth).\n&lt;a href=\"Sibylla%20Draconis\"&gt;Sibylla Draconis&lt;/a&gt;.\nSibylla lives in &lt;a href=\"Muck%20Valley%20Cavern%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Muck Valley Cavern&lt;/a&gt; with her surrogate family of wild animals. Killing her carries no risk of a bounty, so only standard dungeon-crawling and boss strategies are necessary. The cavern consists of 3 zones, with Sibylla in the final zone. However, it's also possible that the Hero will encounter Sibylla facing away from them as soon as they enter the cavern.\nThe creatures in the cave are &lt;a href=\"Leveled%20Creatures%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;level-dependent&lt;/a&gt;. At lower levels, there will be only &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Rat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt; to contend with, but by level 10+, Sibylla will be guarded by &lt;a href=\"Black%20Bear%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;black bears&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Matthias%20Draconis\"&gt;Matthias Draconis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe final family member can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Talos%20Plaza%20District\"&gt;Talos Plaza District&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. Matthias works as a guard in &lt;a href=\"Umbacano%20Manor\"&gt;Umbacano Manor&lt;/a&gt;, where he can be found in the basement. Like his siblings, he can be goaded into attacking the Hero through conversation, and the other guard nearby will attempt to kill him.\nWhen he leaves the manor, he will eventually enter a stonewalled garden. He will be isolated here, making it a good place to attack him.\nMatthias sleeps upstairs in his house from 12 am - 5 am. If the Hero can defeat the lock on the door, this is the ideal time to kill him. This task is further complicated by &lt;a href=\"Collatinus%20Vedius\"&gt;Collatinus Vedius&lt;/a&gt;, who also lives in the house. Having a high &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt; score, and certain spells (such as &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Chameleon%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Chameleon&lt;/a&gt;) will make the infiltration easier.\nMatthias can also be killed by &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;conjuring&lt;/a&gt; a creature and attacking him. The guard will, in turn, attack the Hero but will change to attacking the conjured creature if the Hero yields. The conjured creature will continue attacking Matthias. This may have to be repeated several times to kill Matthias, as the guard may easily kill the conjured creature. This method will incur a bounty of 80 for each assault.\nConclusion.\nWhen the entire family lies dead, the Hero can pick up their reward and new orders at the next dead drop in Skingrad Castle courtyard, inside the well."}

He will assist the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; in cleansing the water and defeating the city's defenses, on the condition that they free him of his own curse.\nBackground.\nNhalan was present during &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Tarish-Zi\"&gt;Emperor Tarish-Zi&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Yokudan\"&gt;Yokudan&lt;/a&gt; invasion of &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, and suggested that the city sought out the help of the &lt;a href=\"Celestial\"&gt;Celestial&lt;/a&gt;s, having been strongly against taking the &lt;a href=\"Nereid%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nereid&lt;/a&gt;s' offer. General &lt;a href=\"Zal%27ik\"&gt;Zal'ik&lt;/a&gt; took him to &lt;a href=\"Shada\"&gt;Shada&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Nereids, on the charge of treason. She forced him to drink from the enchanted water, turning him into a &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt;. Shada then cursed him again to remain lucid during the events, and bound the curse to Zal'ik's soul. He has since remained in the city for thousands of years.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Reason%20We%20Fight\"&gt;The Reason We Fight&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the Burial ruins, Nhalan will be standing in the hall. He will task the Vestige with witnessing visions of the past. In the second vision, a captured Nhalan is seen speaking to Zal'ik, shortly before being taken to Shada:\nZal'ik: \"Nhalan, you speak of treason! Do you want the Yokudans to come here, pillage everything we've built, murder us all? Do you want that?\"\nNhalan: \"\"Better a quick death to Yokudan steel than a lifetime as slaves to those creatures. We should call on &lt;a href=\"Celestial\"&gt;the star&lt;/a&gt;s for protection\u2015as our ancestors did\u2015and have nothing to do with these Nereids and their sorcery!\"\"\nZal'ik: \"I've heard enough. Take him to Shada.\"\nAfter killing the &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Atronach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Flesh atronach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Debruz\"&gt;Debruz&lt;/a&gt;, Nhalan will be waiting by the stairs. He is surprised the atronach was defeated so easily, considering it killed thousands of Yokudans during the invasion, and suspects that Zal'ik's magic is weakening. He will also notify the Vestige that the poison cloud has merely moved, and tasks them with defeating Zal'ik.\nOnce Zal'ik is defeated, Nhalan will give the Vestige the book \"Speculations on a Cure for the Dreadful Corruption, Imposed by Shada on the City of Water, On the Eve of the Invasion of Tarish-Zi\", containing information on how to cure people who have drank Shada's cursed water.\nConversations.\nAt the start of the quest:\n\"I thought I heard the tell-tale sounds of the living outside these doors. Be warned: the once-refreshing waters of this place run rancid with an unholy magic\u2014a curse that grants great strength and unnatural long life, but for a price.\"\nAfter slaying Debruz:\n\"\"That &lt;a href=\"Debruz\"&gt;flesh abomination&lt;/a&gt; killed thousands of Yokudans as they assaulted this place. That you took it down so easily\u2014could Zal'ik's magic be weakening? In any case, the cloud of poison has begun to move.\"\"\nAfter slayin Zal'ik:\n\"You have done what the Yokudans could not. You have slain Zal'ik. You have given me my freedom. And yet, forgive me if I feel no joy. Zal'ik was a brave man. He only wanted to save his people.\""}

Follow the Blue Road away from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; to get to Cheydinhal. &lt;a href=\"Alessia%20Ottus\"&gt;Alessia Ottus'&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Guide%20to%20Cheydinhal\"&gt;Guide to Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt; initially praises the city, noting its \"broad green parklands, graceful willows along the banks of the Corbolo, neatly groomed gardens and flowering shrubs ... clean, well-trimmed houses and neat stonework, ornamented with striking designs in glass, metal, and wood.\" In typical Ottus fashion, however, she then writes, \"But what lurks beneath this pleasing appearance? Crime! Scandal! Corruption!\" and accuses &lt;a href=\"Count%20Andel%20Indarys\"&gt;Count Andel Indarys&lt;/a&gt; of murdering his wife.\nWeary travelers can also find rest at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Bridge%20Inn\"&gt;Imperial Bridge Inn&lt;/a&gt;, which lies on the north bank of the Silverfish River. The foreboding &lt;a href=\"Cadlew%20Chapel\"&gt;Cadlew Chapel&lt;/a&gt; sits on the banks of the Niben, very close to the Nibenay Valley. &lt;a href=\"Cropsford%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cropsford&lt;/a&gt;, the early stage of a farm, can be found at the end of a path that branches off the Yellow Road.\nPoints of interest.\nThe Basin hosts two shrines, the &lt;a href=\"Peryite%27s%20Shrine%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Shrine of Peryite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vaermina%27s%20Shrine%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt;. For the flat-broke adventurer who is desperate to level up, a tent with a sleeping mat can be found northwest of &lt;a href=\"Deserted%20Mine\"&gt;Deserted Mine&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"Rune%20Stones\"&gt;Rune Stone&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0sits on a hill east of Vaermina's Shrine \u2014 it is notable for the wide variety of flowering plants growing around it. Activating it will summon a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Dagger%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Daedric Dagger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Gauntlets%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gauntlets&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "1021729", "revid": "47534447", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1021729", "title": "Nibenay Valley", "text": "The Nibenay Valley, the Niben Valley, or the Nibenean Valley is a small region situated in the eastern rainforests of the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt;, within the province of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. The Nibenay Valley has a rich history and even a beautiful landscape. It is the centerpiece of the Nibenay East, containing the &lt;a href=\"Niben%20Bay\"&gt;Niben Bay&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nWestern Niben Valley.\nThe Western Niben Valley is where the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; is located, as well as, where the entire valley meets the much larger region of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Forest\"&gt;Great Forest&lt;/a&gt;. The West Valley is where the population is practically found here, as the only important settlement, Bravil is found. The &lt;a href=\"Green%20Road\"&gt;Green Road&lt;/a&gt; runs through here, going around Bravil and &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20ruins\"&gt;Ayleid ruins&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;-related history is unique in the Western Valley, as the site of Bravil contained a fully-established city that was sacked during the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;Alessian Slave Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. The people from the city of &lt;a href=\"Anutwyll\"&gt;Anutwyll&lt;/a&gt; were among the few that escaped the Alessians, and entering the province of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, integrating with the &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Elves\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nCentral Niben Valley.\nThe Central Niben Valley consists of the lower &lt;a href=\"Niben%20Bay\"&gt;Niben Bay&lt;/a&gt;, as well as, the land east of the Green Road, and the strip coast found west of the &lt;a href=\"Yellow%20Road\"&gt;Yellow Road&lt;/a&gt;. The only settlement is the &lt;a href=\"Cadlew%20Chapel\"&gt;Cadlew Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, which is of an unknown origin. The ruined city-state of &lt;a href=\"Nenalata\"&gt;Nenalata&lt;/a&gt; was one of the last Ayleid kingdoms as their leader, &lt;a href=\"Laloriaran%20Dynar\"&gt;Laloriaran Dynar&lt;/a&gt; pledged allegiance with the Alessian Empire. But like the other Ayleid settlements, it was abandoned when the Nenalata Elves traveled to the far northwest in the region of &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;. The estuaries of both the &lt;a href=\"Panther%20River\"&gt;Panther River&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Silverfish%20River\"&gt;Silverfish River&lt;/a&gt; are found here and continue into towards the border.\nEastern Niben Valley.\nThe Eastern Niben Valley is a stretch of open woodlands that eventually goes into the southern edge of the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Basin\"&gt;Nibenay Basin&lt;/a&gt;. The Panther River makes up the northern border, while banks of the Silverfish create the south. The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Bridge%20Inn\"&gt;Imperial Bridge Inn&lt;/a&gt; is the only settlement in the area, being found just off the Yellow Road, near the &lt;a href=\"Mouth%20of%20the%20Panther\"&gt;Mouth of the Panther&lt;/a&gt;. But because of the abundance of ruins and other anomalies, scholars tend to be found in the inn. Beyond that, the bulwark of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Gold-Throat\"&gt;Fort Gold-Throat&lt;/a&gt; is found on the Silverfish River, south of the Imperial Bridge. Other than that, there is nothing worth mentioning about the Eastern Niben Valley.\nFauna.\nMudcrabs.\nDespite the criminal activity present in Bravil, the Nibenay Valley has an immersive culture regarding sea transport and one that surrounds the Niben Bay, in general. The &lt;a href=\"Mudcrab\"&gt;Mudcrab&lt;/a&gt; exemplifies this, due to their abundance in the Niben River. They live in clusters throughout the shore, and are either harmless or attack on sight. They seek to defend their home from anything they deem a threat. One Bear would not be able to withstand a fleet of fledgling Mudcrabs, who bubble at the sight of their foes. Their legs are commonly used in food, fried or grilled, and their chitin is used in &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; for medicine and potions.\nWill-o-the-Wisp.\nSouthern mainland Tamriel, for the most part, consists of dense swamps, and endless forests. Nature here is at its most primal, and dangerous. The Nibenay Valley is just the beginning of what lies south in &lt;a href=\"Blackwood\"&gt;Blackwood&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Tenmar%20Forest\"&gt;Tenmar Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Magical creatures such as the &lt;a href=\"Will-o-the-Wisp\"&gt;Will-o-the-Wisp&lt;/a&gt; reside in the forest and haunt the rainforests of Bravil. The Will-o-the-Wisp appear as a glowing light, swarming with magical specks of light energy. They are fast and can turn invisible when confronting prey. Unlike most creatures, the Will-o-the-Wisp cannot be harmed by normal means, only with Silver or Magical weaponry (i.e., Daedric or Enchanted weapons). They are rare in general, but one will most likely encounter one in the Nibenay, or the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Forest\"&gt;Great Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrolls.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt; are a common predator, as well as, a feared one throughout the provinces of Tamriel. Trolls are animals that live in isolated in caves and other areas. Trolls in Cyrodiil are notably smaller than other variants in Skyrim or Valenwood but are faster and louder. The Niben River, as well as, other riverways in the Imperial Province are the homes of &lt;a href=\"River%20Troll\"&gt;River Troll&lt;/a&gt;s, a more orange-silver blue colored variant that are rare and almost unheard of. River Troll hide is extremely valuable, making them a prime target for hunters. Trolls, in general, have a weakness to &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;. One of the speculated reasons as to why is that, Trolls regenerate very quickly, but when it comes to burns, it struggles in that field. &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Fat\"&gt;Troll Fat&lt;/a&gt; is a commonly used alchemic ingredient, used in poisons and tonics.\nDreughs.\n&lt;a href=\"Dreugh\"&gt;Dreugh&lt;/a&gt;s are aquatic &lt;a href=\"beastfolk\"&gt;beastfolk&lt;/a&gt; that live in the waters of Tamriel, such as the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; in the Northwest, and the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt; in Morrowind. They begin as a Dreugh Shrimp that eventually grows into a Water Dreugh, with tentacles like an Octopus, but with the upper body that people would recognize. But eventually, the Dreugh undergo a process called &lt;a href=\"Karvinasim\"&gt;Karvinasim&lt;/a&gt;, where the Water Dreugh grows legs and becomes a Land Dreugh, who are colloquially called \"Billies\" in Cyrodiil. According to some myths, the Dreughs were a remnant of the previous &lt;a href=\"Kalpa\"&gt;Kalpa&lt;/a&gt;, which is an epoch of time. In this myth, Dreughs controlled the seas of &lt;a href=\"Lyg\"&gt;Lyg&lt;/a&gt;, under the control of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, or at least his form at the time. However, that Kalpa was destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;. The modern-day Dreugh were considered remnants of this, denounced to the mere fauna of Tamriel in the current Kalpa.\nGhosts &amp; Wraiths.\nThe Niben Bay houses dangers such as ravenous creatures and notorious pirates, resulting in several shipwrecks throughout the Niben River and other riverways. These wrecks contain &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;s, and some having &lt;a href=\"Wraith\"&gt;Wraith&lt;/a&gt;s. These spirits stay on the physical plane until they are put to rest, either completing an unfinished tasked or being defeated. The ghost of &lt;a href=\"Grantham%20Blakeley\"&gt;Grantham Blakeley&lt;/a&gt; haunted the Niben Bay, around &lt;a href=\"Bawnwatch%20Camp\"&gt;Bawnwatch Camp&lt;/a&gt;, remaining a legend known as the Forlorn Watchmen. His lost ship contained Wraiths of the former crew and &lt;a href=\"Gable%20the%20Traitor\"&gt;Gable the Traitor&lt;/a&gt;, the one who caused mutiny on the ship. These creatures are made out of &lt;a href=\"Ectoplasm\"&gt;Ectoplasm&lt;/a&gt;, which is used in alchemy for potions or poisons.\nFlora.\nThe Niben River and the Niben Bay are perhaps the largest water sources on the mainland, other than the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt; in Morrowind or the Deep Marshes around &lt;a href=\"Helstrom\"&gt;Helstrom&lt;/a&gt;, and as a result, a strong variety of flora grows along the river, from &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Rumare\"&gt;Lake Rumare&lt;/a&gt;, all the way into the &lt;a href=\"Topal%20Sea\"&gt;Topal Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Coincidentally, since the Western Niben is traditionally part of Elsweyr, throughout the river grows abundant patches of Cattails and Water Lillies, and deeper south becomes more swamp-like, but with that Cyrod-Climate. All around Bravil and the entirety of the Western Niben Valley are &lt;a href=\"Mandrake\"&gt;Mandrake&lt;/a&gt;s, even though they are primarily found in the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Highlands\"&gt;Colovian Highlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut like other waterfronts in Tamriel, the Nibenay Valley is known to contain &lt;a href=\"Nirnroot\"&gt;Nirnroot&lt;/a&gt;s, which held little significance until &lt;a href=\"1E%20668\"&gt;1E 668&lt;/a&gt;, which is known as &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Death\"&gt;Sun's Death&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first known eruption of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. Because of a magical anomaly, the Nirnroot used the ash salt as their sole source of food, as Sun's Death caused to blot the sky in hellish clouds. They knew that this sudden natural disaster would have ended in their extinction. Nirnroot is said not to be able to grow back and even appear enormously. But around &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, the Altmer alchemist, &lt;a href=\"Sinderion\"&gt;Sinderion&lt;/a&gt; was able to learn how to cultivate them, with his apprentice growing them somewhere in &lt;a href=\"the%20Rift\"&gt;the Rift&lt;/a&gt;. In general, the Eastern Niben Valley is nothing but forest, with very few ruins and caverns. The waterfront of the Valley is open with low bushes and open roads. Moving away from the road would lead into open and free areas.\nGovernment.\nThe city-state of Bravil is practically the largest settlement in the Nibenay Valley, and by default, the region's capital. To the rest of Cyrodiil, Bravil is unanimously the worst city in what is the heartlands of the continent. Bravil is ruled by a Count/Countess out of &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Bravil\"&gt;Castle Bravil&lt;/a&gt;, which overlooks the Niben Bay. The County takes up the entirety of the Nibenay Valley, and upwards towards the Heartlands, and south into Blackwood. It borders &lt;a href=\"County%20Skingrad\"&gt;County Skingrad&lt;/a&gt; in the west, and &lt;a href=\"County%20Leyawiin\"&gt;County Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt; in the south. The criminal activity in Bravil is dangerously bad, as &lt;a href=\"Skooma\"&gt;Skooma&lt;/a&gt; is prominent, and even a prime trade in Bravil. Crimelords and Kingpins operate out of Bravil and even have favor over the entire city. The City Guard is said to be paid out by these figures so that their actions can run smoothly. But despite Bravil's bad reputation, there is some nobility worth noting, such as the Imperials of &lt;a href=\"House%20Terentius\"&gt;House Terentius&lt;/a&gt;, who were royal scribes by nature, and even ruled Bravil in the late Third Era. Minor settlements under the control of County Bravil are unknown, but it can be assumed that settlements surrounding Bravil, such as &lt;a href=\"Ione\"&gt;Ione&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Bridge%20Inn\"&gt;Imperial Bridge Inn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Faregyl\"&gt;Faregyl&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the early years of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, there were several Ayleid vassal-states that pledged their allegiance to the First Empire, some living as far as the reign of &lt;a href=\"Ami-El\"&gt;Ami-El&lt;/a&gt;, the third Emperor of the Alessians. The city-state of &lt;a href=\"Nenalata\"&gt;Nenalata&lt;/a&gt; was one of these vassal-states, as well as, the most well-known. They were forced to adopt the doctrines of the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt;, the exact opposite of their Daedric worship. They remained in the Alessian Empire until the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt; ordered for their extinction, to which the Nenalata Elves left for &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt; and the region of &lt;a href=\"Mournoth\"&gt;Mournoth&lt;/a&gt;. The last known leader of Nenalata, and by extension, the Ayleids was &lt;a href=\"Laloriaran%20Dynar\"&gt;Laloriaran Dynar&lt;/a&gt;. The Greater Nibenay is the home of the original Imperials, which consisted of Cyro-Nordic Tribes that separated themselves from Skyrim both economically, and culturally. The early Alessian Empire began in the Nibenay Valley, eventually growing into the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. The fall of Bravil was the most well-known battle in the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;Alessian Slave Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, as it not only resulted in Bravil's founding, but it was the first known record of &lt;a href=\"Alteration\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; magic. The First Empire had made the &lt;a href=\"Nibenese\"&gt;Nibenese&lt;/a&gt; people into a mercantile group, one that heavily benefits from the Niben River, using gondolas and ships to move between the Imperial City, to Bravil, and Leyawiin.\nReligion.\nEvery county in the Imperial Province has a chapel dedicated to the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;, a pantheon that is worshipped throughout the continent, as a generalization of all the provincial pantheons that are revered. The city-state of Bravil has a Chapel of &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, the Goddess of Love and Fertility. The primary faction that follows Mara is the &lt;a href=\"Benevolence%20of%20Mara\"&gt;Benevolence of Mara&lt;/a&gt;, who spread the teachings of Mara, which revolves around the concept of love and being a good patron in general. Love gives people nourishment and life to everyone. Mara is a universally praised Goddess as Mara, or another variation (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Morwha\"&gt;Morwha&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe Benevolence of Mara has chapters throughout the Empire, in places such as &lt;a href=\"Anticlere\"&gt;Anticlere&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ephesus\"&gt;Ephesus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;. The Great Chapel of Mara in Bravil, is a significant place of worship for the deity, as several artifacts including the &lt;a href=\"Chalice%20of%20Mara\"&gt;Chalice of Mara&lt;/a&gt;, which was a wedding gift from Mara herself, to &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Alessia\"&gt;Saint Alessia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt;. Like other religious temples, the Benevolence of Mara has a militant arm, in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Maran%20Knights\"&gt;Maran Knights&lt;/a&gt;. On the other side of the Niben Bay is the &lt;a href=\"Cadlew%20Chapel\"&gt;Cadlew Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, an otherwise isolated Imperial Chapel just off the &lt;a href=\"Yellow%20Road\"&gt;Yellow Road&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Cropsford\"&gt;Cropsford&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond that, the former vassal-state of &lt;a href=\"Nenalata\"&gt;Nenalata&lt;/a&gt; was a city of &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Infinite Energies. Meridia is a very prominent deity in the Ayleid kingdoms, as seen in other settlements like &lt;a href=\"Garlas%20Malatar\"&gt;Garlas Malatar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Delodiil\"&gt;Delodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Alessian Slave Rebellion; The Battle for Ancient Bravil.\nLike the other elven races, the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s migrated out of their home of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, settling on the mainland of Tamriel. In this case, the province of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. The land surrounding Bravil was the heart of trade, as the Niben River runs to the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;, into the waves of the ocean. While the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Ceyatatar\"&gt;Ceyatatar&lt;/a&gt; was the main trading post of the west, Ancient Bravil was the eastern equivalent. The Ayleid city that existed where Bravil now stands was a juggernaut, with minor cities such as &lt;a href=\"Bawn\"&gt;Bawn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morahame\"&gt;Morahame&lt;/a&gt; surrounding it. The name that original settlement held translates to \"Home,\" meaning it was called \"Hame.\" But considering that the faraway settlement of &lt;a href=\"Hame\"&gt;Hame&lt;/a&gt; exists, it was either called the former, or \"Math,\" which also means \"Home\". But like the rest of the Ayleid kingdoms, Ancient Bravil practiced &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;Slavery&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nede&lt;/a&gt;s. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20242\"&gt;1E 242&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; rebels against the Ayleid settlements, for a whole year with the &lt;a href=\"Fall%20of%20White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;Fall of White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;. Ancient Bravil was one of the last settlements to fall to the Alessians, withstanding roughly four attacks, with each attack leading slowly to its demise.\nAfter every battle, all of the Imperial Centurions would be killed, and the Ayleid people would re-populate the city. On the second invasion, escape tunnels were discovered, prompting to be buried and closed in, ultimately, the same scenario occurred. After the third one, the Imperials secured the roads and walls, but their corpses would later be tossed out of the wall. &lt;a href=\"Teo%20Bravillius%20Tasus\"&gt;Teo Bravillius Tasus&lt;/a&gt; was the leader of the invasion force, after the fourth invasion, Tasus speculated that the Ayleids were hiding somewhere, killing the centurions at night. And so, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; was forced to investigate every nook and cranny until they discovered that Ayleid sorcerers using &lt;a href=\"Alteration\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; magic to teleport into the city. Then it became easy, as the Imperials were able to root out the Ayleids from all of their hiding places, and adequately destroy the town. Many scholars attribute this event to the earliest forms of Alteration, as at the time, the school of magic was not recognized. The site would later become the foundation of the modern-day city-state of &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Rebellion Aftermath; Nenalata &amp; the Ayleid Diaspora.\nThe fall of &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; had created the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Diaspora\"&gt;Ayleid Diaspora&lt;/a&gt;, where the remaining clans of Ayleids were forced to evacuate Cyrodiil before they were slaughtered by the Imperials. The city-state of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Bravil\"&gt;Ancient Bravil&lt;/a&gt; was among the last standing ones until it was ultimately sacked. But the other Ayleid settlements around it were not as unfortunate. The Ayleids of the Nibenay Valley were the ones to escape the wrath of the Alessians efficiently. The Elves of both &lt;a href=\"Anutwyll\"&gt;Anutwyll&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bawn\"&gt;Bawn&lt;/a&gt; were able to escape into &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, as did a couple of other clans, while the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Nenalata\"&gt;Nenalata&lt;/a&gt; had sworn allegiance into the First Empire. The Ayleids that escaped into Valenwood would eventually integrate themselves into &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;i customs until they were assimilated and absorbed into their people, but Nenalata would continue their Ayleid culture, to a minimum at the very least. These events that transpired are known as the &lt;a href=\"Late%20Ayleid%20Period\"&gt;Late Ayleid Period&lt;/a&gt;, which continues until the death of &lt;a href=\"Laloriaran%20Dynar\"&gt;Laloriaran Dynar&lt;/a&gt;. King Dynar became the leader of Nenalata sometime after &lt;a href=\"1E%20263\"&gt;1E 263&lt;/a&gt;, but before &lt;a href=\"1E%20331\"&gt;1E 331&lt;/a&gt;. His father was forced to make Nenalata a vassal-kingdom, all the while transition to a slave-less economy and the worship of the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt;. As time went on, animosity towards Nenalata had grown when a coup d'etat occurs in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, and the vassal-states began to dwindle, with Nenalata being the remaining few. Ultimately, the Imperials were at Nenalata's doorstep, telling them to get out of Cyrodiil or face the consequences, and so they did. The Nenalata Elves traveled to the northwest, to the region of &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, where they founded the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Bisnensel\"&gt;Bisnensel&lt;/a&gt;. But even then, the &lt;a href=\"Primeval%20Seekers\"&gt;Primeval Seekers&lt;/a&gt; forced the royal family out of Bisnensel, and into the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balfiera\"&gt;Isle of Balfiera&lt;/a&gt;. One day, King Laloriaran Dynar returns to Nenalata alone, only to be imprisoned into the depths of &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;, for the rest of eternity. And as history repeated itself, Bisnensel was abandoned, and the Dynar family integrated into the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Clan\"&gt;Direnni Clan&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Anchors of Coldharbour; the Planemeld.\nWith the death of &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20III\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil III&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; had occurred, with various warlords and champions seeking claim over the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;. Among them was &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt;, the Duke of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;, who amassed a rebellion against the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperors&lt;/a&gt; for ownership of the Throne. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20577\"&gt;2E 577&lt;/a&gt;, Aquilarios had taken over the Imperial City and would have likely ended the Interregnum at that, but he was not &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;. Only the Dragonborn can lit the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; that protects the barrier between Nirn and Oblivion, prompting him and his &lt;a href=\"Five%20Companions\"&gt;Five Companions&lt;/a&gt; to search for the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;. But things would turn for the worst when the &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt; occurred, and Emperor Varen had disappeared. &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, the King of Worms, had unleashed the dark anchors of &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt; onto the Imperial City, thus beginning the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion over Tamriel. Bravil was one of the first targets of the Daedric Invasion, with the town burned to the ground by Daedra and undead creatures. Survivors took refuge in places like &lt;a href=\"a%20Warlock%27s%20Luck\"&gt;a Warlock's Luck&lt;/a&gt;, but they were not saved from the destruction. The Imperial City was basically a pocket of Oblivion, as the Dark Anchors surrounded the city walls, and the bridges are floating in mid-air. &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Titan\"&gt;Daedric Titan&lt;/a&gt;s were flying around the countryside, and &lt;a href=\"Dremora\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; were burning villages. This state has left Cyrodiil war-torn, to which the surrounding provinces decided to take advantage of. &lt;a href=\"Clivia%20Tharn\"&gt;Clivia Tharn&lt;/a&gt; of the Nibenay was left as the Regent-Empress, forcing to take refuge in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Prison\"&gt;Imperial City Prison&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe War-Torn Province; the Three-Banners War.\nBy &lt;a href=\"2E%20580\"&gt;2E 580&lt;/a&gt;, things had not changed, while the cities of Cyrodiil were slowly attempting to rebuild and making ends meet on their own. The Empress-Regent was still in hiding as the wretches of Coldharbour still took control over the Imperial City. However, a war was in the air as alliances from the three corners of the world attempt to claim the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; of the southwest was the youngest of the three, having hold of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. The Nibenay Valley, as well as, the city-state of Bravil was situated in what was considered Territory of the Aldmeri Dominion, which consists of the Western Niben River, to the southern outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Elsweyr%20Gate\"&gt;Eastern Elsweyr Gate&lt;/a&gt; was located just south of the Larsius River, rather close to the Green Road of Bravil. All the while, various bandit groups took advantage of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;, sacking and raiding settlements all throughout Central Cyrodiil, with groups such as the &lt;a href=\"Shadowed%20Path\"&gt;Shadowed Path&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Vipers\"&gt;Gray Vipers&lt;/a&gt; were active in the Nibenay Valley. Notoriously, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Jena%20Apinia\"&gt;Captain Jena Apinia&lt;/a&gt;, of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; was left astray with her legion, asking for help from the Mayor of Bravil, but when he refused to help, she ordered her soldiers to attack, killing half of the population. She thought it would help, but the Bravilian people rose up in anger, forcing her to leave. She would become known as the \"Butcher of Bravil\" and she lived in infamy, even taking items of importance from Bravil. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, she was defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20the%20Queen\"&gt;Eyes of the Queen&lt;/a&gt;, in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Garlas%20Agea\"&gt;Garlas Agea&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;. This era of constant feuding would continue, as it did in the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom the Deadlands; the Gates of Oblivion.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Harvest%27s%20End%20%28Holiday%29\"&gt;Harvest's End&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt; marked the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, as the Emperor, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated deep within the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Prison\"&gt;Imperial City Prison&lt;/a&gt;, en route to escaping the capital. Both the Emperor, as well as, his three children were killed by the group known as the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, a cult of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;. Ever since then, gates of Oblivion opened all throughout the continent, laying waste to the illustrious Empire, with the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; being one of the more well-known attacks. At the time, the County of Bravil was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Regulus%20Terentius\"&gt;Regulus Terentius&lt;/a&gt;, a former champion of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Arena\"&gt;Imperial City Arena&lt;/a&gt;, hailing from the esteemed &lt;a href=\"House%20Terentius\"&gt;House Terentius&lt;/a&gt;, but is now just a drunken ne'er-do-well. The Oblivion Gate that threatened Bravil appeared in the ruined tower of &lt;a href=\"Beriel%27s%20Lament\"&gt;Beriel's Lament&lt;/a&gt;, which held little significance in the first place. But the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, traveled to all the Counties of Cyrodiil, to build an army to fight a greater Daedra force heading for &lt;a href=\"Bruma\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;. The Hero destroyed the Gate in Bravil, which gave Count Terentius the ability to send soldiers. In the end, the Hero of Kvatch, and &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt; were able to defeat Mehrunes Dagon and end the Oblivion Crisis.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Great War &amp; Lord Naarifin's Campaign.\nOn the 30th of &lt;a href=\"Frostfall\"&gt;Frostfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"4E%20171\"&gt;4E 171&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; waged war against the weakened &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; in the event known as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;. While the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt; suffered greatly at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Arannelya\"&gt;Lady Arannelya&lt;/a&gt;, the Nibenay was fighting the Dominion under the command of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Naarifin\"&gt;Lord Naarifin&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful Magus-General that began his campaign in the northern Elsweyr hills, laying waste to the Niben River and besieging both Bravil and &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;. Naarifin was able to cut off the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; from Bravil, which ultimately led to the fall of the city. Naarifin's success in the Nibenay had left the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; thinking the Empire was weaker than realized, and so the full-scale battle had begun. In &lt;a href=\"4E%20172\"&gt;4E 172&lt;/a&gt;, Lord Naarifin had surrounded the Imperial City, large-scale water battles occurred throughout &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Rumare\"&gt;Lake Rumare&lt;/a&gt; and the Niben Bay. In &lt;a href=\"4E%20174\"&gt;4E 174&lt;/a&gt;, Lord Naarifin had taken control of the Imperial City and &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt; was forced to evacuate into the north. But by &lt;a href=\"4E%20175\"&gt;4E 175&lt;/a&gt;, Lord Naarifin was defeated, and the Empire recovered the Imperial City. Bravil and Leyawiin were rebuilt sometime afterward.\nThe Bravilian Drug War; the Eclipse &amp; the Claw.\nCounty of Bravil, and by extension, the Nibenay Valley is the &lt;a href=\"Skooma\"&gt;Skooma&lt;/a&gt; capital of the Imperial Province, for not only being a prime port along the Niben River but for its proximity to the crime city of &lt;a href=\"Senchal\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt;. Skooma runs freely throughout Bravil, and so many drug lords and kingpins take refuge in the walls of Bravil. The two most prevalent groups to appear in recent times are &lt;a href=\"the%20Eclipse\"&gt;the Eclipse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20Claws\"&gt;the Claws&lt;/a&gt;. The Eclipse are a group primarily of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elves\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt;, while the Claws consist of &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;. Both were feuding clans that eventually took to arms in &lt;a href=\"4E%20188\"&gt;4E 188&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in the Bravilian Drug War. Amidst the riots, the &lt;a href=\"Lucky%20Old%20Lady\"&gt;Lucky Old Lady&lt;/a&gt; statue was wrecked, leaving the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20of%20the%20Night%20Mother\"&gt;Crypt of the Night Mother&lt;/a&gt; exposed to the destruction, albeit hidden amidst the fires. The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; had been sent to eliminate the Baroness of the Eclipse, and the Kingpin of the Claws, to which both were exterminated. Turmoil between both factions intensified and so &lt;a href=\"Alisanne%20Dupre\"&gt;Alisanne Dupre&lt;/a&gt;, Listener of the Brotherhood rushed to the Night Mother's crypt to protect her. Ultimately, Dupre was killed in action, but the Night Mother was saved. &lt;a href=\"Garnag\"&gt;Garnag the Dark Adherent&lt;/a&gt; had successfully brought the Night Mother to &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;. But eventually, the conflict in Bravil had subsided."}

The path of one's fortune turns often and unpredictably, without any rhyme or reason to mortal minds, though the series of events that led me to this place speak to an intelligence arranging the scenes. Like so many great discoveries, this one was made by accident, leading me to believe &lt;a href=\"Julianos\"&gt;Julianos&lt;/a&gt; has a mischievous streak.\nHampered by delays, my expedition to &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt; did not even begin until &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Fall\"&gt;Frost Fall&lt;/a&gt;. A wiser person would have put off the trek for the next year, but I'd been held up long enough and let spite rule me. Fiery determination kept me warm through the first few nights ascending the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, but like any savvy highwayman, the cold chose to rob me of that determination once I'd come too far to turn and flee.\nWith little choice other than brave the nearest dry cave and pray that it was home to neither &lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Online%29\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt; nor &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Online%29\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;, I discovered a natural cavern extending some distance into the rock. I nearly leapt out of my skin as a chilling howl rolled through the stony interior, but it was only a stiff wind that tugged at my clothes in the darkness. Curious, I temporarily abandoned my search for the most comfortable patch of granite to bed down upon to search for the source.\nWhat I discovered was a secluded valley surrounded on all sides by the mountain, and that might have been the end of it, had the bear I'd blundered past not roused from its stupor. Weary as I was, the anger of the sluggish beast was more than enough incentive for me to brave the cold a little longer. Unlike the hinterlands along the mountain path, the wilderness I found myself in was still clinging to life in spite of the bitter cold.\nThe land might have been weathering the chill with grace, but I was still likely to die of exposure without some form of shelter, so I soldiered on in search of a quiet nook to stuff my bedroll into. I thought I might collapse on more than one occasion, which would have certainly spelled death for me in this frigid clime, but my perseverance was rewarded soon enough. At the far end of the valley stood an ancient ruin, carved right from the mountain. Without the energy to marvel or the sense to concern myself with what dangers might lie within, I heaved the massive stone doors open with the last of my strength and collapsed into a heap. My last thoughts lingered on the gust of warm air that greeted me as I slipped out of consciousness.\nI woke to find myself face down, not on frigid stone, but warm earth and lush grass. At first I took the dampness of my clothes for thawed frost, but it was my sweat that had the cloth clinging to my skin. The ruins, it seemed, were constructed throughout a cavern filled with active lava flows coursing through it. I attempted to justify the presence of such vibrant plant life to myself as symptom of the tropical warmth, but that excuse didn't hold up to scrutiny. Something about this place was causing the unusual growth and these ruins were either the cause, or likely built here because of the caverns unique properties.\nNo longer at risk of dying from exposure, I settled in at the mouth of the cavern and studied the exterior of the ruin in great detail. They were &lt;a href=\"Nede%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; in origin, that much was obvious to me, but less refined than other architecture I'd seen around &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Pre-&lt;a href=\"Alessian\"&gt;Alessian&lt;/a&gt;, even. I could have spent months in Craglorn hunting for a find as significant as this, and I stumbled upon it\u2014quite literally\u2014barely a few days after embarking. Fate is a strange thing indeed."}

He serves as the main antagonist of .\nBackground.\nNicolas was born around &lt;a href=\"2E%20534\"&gt;2E 534&lt;/a&gt;, joining the guild in 549 at the age of 15. Having served as the Guildmaster of the Thieves Guild since the age of 23, Nicolas commanded great respect and power from his guild members, who looked up to him for guidance. Under his reign, the guild soared to great heights and most of the veteran members saw the organization as a tight-knit family whose influence scared even Abah's Landing's merchant lords.\nFollowing a failed heist in &lt;a href=\"Taneth\"&gt;Taneth&lt;/a&gt; involving Magnifica Falora's dowry inside her family tomb, Nicolas was believed to have been killed, though in truth it is revealed he betrayed the guild and faked his death. He is later found imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"No%20Shira%20Citadel\"&gt;No Shira Citadel&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wheel\"&gt;Iron Wheel&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was supposed to be shipped off to Taneth to face justice but was reportedly thrown off the ship and lost to the waves. He survived the incident and left his past life of thieving and intrigue for good, having promised marriage to an unsuspecting widow named &lt;a href=\"Volunidai\"&gt;Volunidai&lt;/a&gt; and living in her mansion away from civilization.\nNicolas later claimed that he had not intended to betray the guild at all, but due to everyone not acting as they should such as Velsa retiring and Zeira not returning to the guild earlier to warm them of the Iron Wheel, the Thieves Guild was decimated and left ruined by the invading police force.\nHis fate is left to the Vestige's decision \u2013 either kill him for vengeance for the guild, or leave him alive and decide whether or not to reveal to Volunidai of his past expoits.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Forever%20Hold%20Your%20Peace\"&gt;Forever Hold Your Peace&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Thieves Guild wishes to crash Merchant Lord Cosh's wedding ceremony inside Hubalajad Palace and prevent him from marrying &lt;a href=\"Magnifica%20Falorah\"&gt;Magnifica Falorah&lt;/a&gt;. Zeira suspects Nicolas is behind it all.\n&lt;a href=\"Prison%20Break\"&gt;Prison Break&lt;/a&gt;.\nNicolas can be found in &lt;a href=\"Zeira\"&gt;Zeira&lt;/a&gt;'s presumed cell block in the No Shira Prison. The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; is given the option of deciding his fate, though it is recommended to consult with the guild members beforehand.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20One%20That%20Got%20Away\"&gt;The One That Got Away&lt;/a&gt;.\nZeira tasks the Vestige with finding Nicolas whom she believes survived an accident on the ship that was supposed to carry him to Taneth.\nDialogue.\n\"You certainly don't belong. Who are you, and why are you here?\"\n\"Well? Is there honor among thieves, or will you prove Zeira wrong?\"\n\"You are not who I expected to see. I knew my time here wouldn't last. I hoped it would take longer, though. Zeira wanted to make sure I was truly dead, yes? I taught her too well.\"\nThe Vestige may tell Volunidai, or simply leave. Either way, these are the last words exchanged between the two.\nConversations.\nNicolas: \"Ah, Walks-Softly. So good to see you again. How have you been?\"\nWalks-Softly. \"Hunted. Missing too many dead friends.\"\nNicolas: \"And Velsa as well? I thought you'd retired!\"\nVelsa: \"And I thought you were dead.

Nicolene was living in &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; docks at the time, picking pockets to get by. Kaleen came walking by, with a huge bag of gold swinging from the belt. She didn't even notice Nicolene stole it.\nBut when she did, she came after her down the street so fast Nicolene thought her days were numbered. But she was offered a job instead as Kaleen was impressed. Though she says that she thinks Kaleen is an incredible mentor, it is shown in Nicolene's diary (located in the guts of the Spearhead) that she hopes for a more romantic relationship with her, also saying that she thinks \"Kaleen's too strong and independent to marry some stupid man, just like me.\"\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Bloodthorn%20Plot\"&gt;The Bloodthorn Plot&lt;/a&gt;.\nNicolene once again catches up to you to inform you that the assault on Carzog's Demise has begun and that Lambur is waiting for you in Stonetooth Fortress.\nWayrest.\nAfter her adventures in Stros M'Kai and &lt;a href=\"Betnikh\"&gt;Betnikh&lt;/a&gt; are over, she is found again later in &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; aboard the Spearhead where she is now working on behalf of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; as a privateer in Captain Kaleen's splintered crew.\nIf the Vestige chose to destroy the relic of Betnikh, they would find out that her two siblings have been killed by the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion's&lt;/a&gt; assault on &lt;a href=\"Farwatch%20Tower\"&gt;Farwatch Tower&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20Yokuda\"&gt;Children of Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;.\nFinding Nicolene inside Dead Wolf Inn in &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;, she asks for the Vestige's help once again, this time to find Captain Kaleen and the deserters known as the &lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20Yokuda\"&gt;Children of Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;.\nSentinel.\nShe is later found in Sentinel, where she shares to the Vestige that she has been promoted as Captain Kaleen's first mate.

I thought the Dark Elves were crazy, but the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt; build like they want to prove something. You can't take two steps without seeing some crazy spire thing. They're nuts.\n&lt;Nicolene sketched a bunch of towers here, all in a row. They might be made of crystal.&gt;\nGall and pox, the High Elves are so snooty! I could tell the motherless sods didn't want to deal with the captain, but in five minutes she had them eating from her hand. She's amazing.\nI wanted to see more of the city, but the sodding Elves are really picky about outsiders, so we had to stay on the docks. But we spent the whole day together! I took notes and carried her stuff.\n4 Last Seed\nWe got attacked! &lt;a href=\"Master%20Kasan\"&gt;Master Kasan&lt;/a&gt; said it was a Dunmer slave ship. They had mages on the decks, throwing giant fireballs at us. It was terrifying!\nOne of the masts caught on fire, but Tumma-Shah climbed up and put it out. The captain turned us into the wind, laughing like it was all a game. They couldn't keep up. &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, how does she do it?\nI was shaking so bad after. Kasan has told me horrible things about Dark Elf slavers. I think some of his family are still in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. I wonder if he misses them.\nAnyway, this is the best part. After we were safe, the captain saw me shaking and took me aside. She told me I was brave and did well. Then she hugged me. Hugged me!\nMara, I'm still tingly. It felt so good!\n8 Last Seed\nAs soon as we put into &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; again, I'm going to take all my savings and buy some new clothes. Something nice and proper, something the captain will like.\nI asked Tumma-Shah if Kaleen's ever been married. She just flicked her tongue at me, but I bet not. Kaleen's too strong and independent to marry some stupid man, just like me."}

The Ring of Nighteye can also be crafted by combining a &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sigil Stone&lt;/a&gt; with an ordinary ring.

If anyone were less otherwise occupied, the sight of the young &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; woman in a fine black velvet cape might have aroused surprise. Even suspicion. As it were, the strange figure, out of place in an underground cellar so modest it had no sign, blended into the shadows.\n\"Are you Jomic?\"\nThe stout, middle-aged man with a face older than his years looked up and nodded. He returned to his drink. The young woman took the seat next to him.\n\"My name is Haballa,\" she said and pulled out a small bag of gold, placing it next to his mug.\n\"Sure it be,\" snarled Jomic, and met her eyes again. \"Who d'you want dead?\"\nShe did not turn away, but merely asked, \"Is it safe to talk here?\"\n\"No one cares about nobody else's problems but their own here. You could take off your cuirass and dance bare-breasted on the table, and no one'd even spit,\" the man smiled. \"So who d'you want dead?\"\n\"No one, actually,\" said Haballa. \"The truth is, I only want someone ... removed, for a while. Not harmed, you understand, and that's why I need a professional. You come highly recommended.\"\n\"Who you been talking to?\" asked Jomic dully, returning to his drink.\n\"A friend of a friend of a friend of a friend.\"\n\"One of them friends don't know what he's talking about,\" grumbled the man. \"I don't do that any more.\"\nHaballa quietly took out another purse of gold and then another, placing them at the man's elbow. He looked at her for a moment and then poured the gold out and began counting. As he did, he asked, \"Who d'you want removed?\"\n\"Just a moment,\" smiled Haballa, shaking her head. \"Before we talk details, I want to know that you're a professional, and you won't harm this person very much. And that you'll be discreet.\"\n\"You want discreet?\" the man paused in his counting. \"Awright, I'll tell you about an old job of mine. It's been - by &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, I can hardly believe it - more 'n twenty years, and no one but me's alive who had anything to do with the job. This is back afore the time of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Betony\"&gt;War of Betony&lt;/a&gt;, remember that?\"\n\"I was just a baby.\"\n\"'Course you was,\" Jomic smiled. \"Everyone knows that King &lt;a href=\"Lhotun\"&gt;Lhotun&lt;/a&gt; had an older brother &lt;a href=\"Greklith\"&gt;Greklith&lt;/a&gt; what died, right? And then he's got his older sister &lt;a href=\"Aubki\"&gt;Aubki&lt;/a&gt;, what married that King fella in &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;. But the truth's that he had two elder brothers.\"\n\"Really?\" Haballa's eyes glistened with interest.\n\"No lie,\" he chuckled. \"Weedy, feeble fella called &lt;a href=\"Arthago\"&gt;Arthago&lt;/a&gt;, the King and Queen's first born. Anyhow, this prince was heir to the throne, which his parents wasn't too thrilled about, but then the Queen she squeezed out two more princes who looked a lot more fit. That's when me and my boys got hired on, to make it look like the first prince got took off by the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt; or some such story.\"\n\"I had no idea!\" the young woman whispered.\n\"Of course you didn't, that's the point,\" Jomic shook his head. \"Discretion, like you said. We bagged the boy, dropped him off deep in an old ruin, and that was that. No fuss. Just a couple fellas, a bag, and a club.\"\n\"That's what I'm interested in,\" said Haballa. \"Technique. My... friend who needs to be taken away is weak also, like this Prince. What is the club for?\"\n\"It's a tool. So many things what was better in the past ain't around no more, just 'cause people today prefer ease of use to what works right. Let me explain: there're seventy-one prime pain centers in an average fella's body. &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;i, being so sensitive and all, got three and four more respectively. &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt;s, almost as many at fifty-two and sixty-seven,\" Jomic used his short stubby finger to point out each region on Haballa's body. \"Six in your forehead, two in your brow, two on your nose, seven in your throat, ten in your chest, nine in your abdomen, three on each arm, twelve in your groin, four in your favored leg, five in the other.\"\n\"That's sixty-three,\" replied Haballa.\n\"No, it's not,\" growled Jomic.\n\"Yes, it is,\" the young lady cried back, indignant that her mathematical skills were being question: \"Six plus two plus two plus seven plus ten plus nine plus three for one arm and three for the other plus twelve plus four plus five. Sixty-three.\"\n\"I must've left some out,\" shrugged Jomic. \"The important thing is that to become skilled with a staff or club, you gotta be a master of these pain centers. Done right, a light tap could kill, or knock out without so much as a bruise.\"\n\"Fascinating,\" smiled Haballa. \"And no one ever found out?\"\n\"Why would they? The boy's parents, the King and Queen, they're both dead now. The other children always thought their brother got carried off by the Underking. That's what everyone thinks. And all my partners are dead.\"\n\"Of natural causes?\"\n\"Ain't nothing natural that ever happens in the Bay, you know that. One fella got sucked up by one of them Selenu. Another died a that same plague that took the Queen and Prince &lt;a href=\"Greklith\"&gt;Greklith&lt;/a&gt;. 'Nother fella got hisself beat up to death by a &lt;a href=\"burglar\"&gt;burglar&lt;/a&gt;. You gotta keep low, outta sight, like me, if you wanna stay alive.\" Jomic finished counting the coins. \"You must want this fella out of the way bad. Who is it?\"\n\"It's better if I show you,\" said Haballa, standing up. Without a look back, she strode out of the Nameless Tavern.\nJomic drained his beer and went out. The night was cool with an unrestrained wind surging off the water of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;, sending leaves flying like whirling shards. Haballa stepped out of the alleyway next to the tavern, and gestured to him. As he approached her, the breeze blew open her cape, revealing the armor beneath and the crest of the King of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe fat man stepped back to flee, but she was too fast. In a blur, he found himself in the alley on his back, the woman's knee pressed firmly against his throat.\n\"The King has spent years since he took the throne looking for you and your collaborators, Jomic. His instructions to me what to do when I found you were not specific, but you've given me an idea.\"\nFrom her belt, Haballa removed a small sturdy cudgel.\nA drunk stumbling out of the bar heard a whimpered moan accompanied by a soft whisper coming from the darkness of the alley: \"Let's keep better count this time. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven...\""}
