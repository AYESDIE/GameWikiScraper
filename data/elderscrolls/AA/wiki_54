With the installation of the &lt;a href=\"Official%20Add-ons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;expansion pack&lt;/a&gt;, children become available for &lt;a href=\"adoption\"&gt;adoption&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spouse&lt;/a&gt;.\nWithout the use of &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;console commands&lt;/a&gt;, exploits, or &lt;a href=\"Bugs%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;glitches&lt;/a&gt;, all children are &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;invincible&lt;/a&gt;, unable to be harmed, killed, knocked unconscious, or &lt;a href=\"Pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocketed&lt;/a&gt;. They are, therefore, flagged as &lt;a href=\"Essential%20Characters%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;essential characters&lt;/a&gt;. All children carry a key to the house they live in, except for the ones at Honorhall Orphanage.\nEquipment.\nRegardless of a child's race or economic status, all boys wear a collared sweater with brown trousers, and all girls wear a simple belted dress. However, the color of the sweater or dress varies from child to child. All children have the same physical features regardless of gender and race.\nAll children have similar &lt;a href=\"Inventory\"&gt;inventories&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Items%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Items&lt;/a&gt; they tend to carry include:\nThey may also be given certain gifts:\nInteractions.\nSome children can be given a coin. If given a coin, Sond and Bottar reveal a &lt;a href=\"Map%20%28Skyrim%29/Locations\"&gt;map location&lt;/a&gt;. Svari thanks the Dragonborn greatly if given a coin.\nAlthough &lt;a href=\"%23Invincibility\"&gt;invincible&lt;/a&gt; under normal circumstances, if attacked repeatedly, some children draw &lt;a href=\"Daggers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;daggers&lt;/a&gt; and defend themselves. Some children may hire mercenaries or the Dark Brotherhood to kill the Dragonborn if they are caught committing a crime.\n&lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; spells do not work on adopted children when they arrive home. Typically undetectable while invisible, children are always able to interact with the Dragonborn when they enter the door of their home, similarly to how the &lt;a href=\"City%20Watch\"&gt;City Watch&lt;/a&gt; in can interact with invisible players due to the scripting of their dialogue.\nHearthfire.\nWith the addition of downloadable content, the Dragonborn may adopt children. When adopted, they may be sent to any &lt;a href=\"Houses%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; owned by the Dragonborn that has the appropriate child's room upgrade. In the houses in Markarth, Whiterun, and Riften, the &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy lab&lt;/a&gt; (enchanting lab in Riften) can be upgraded to a child's bedroom at the cost of storage loss. The houses in Solitude and Windhelm will create entirely separate living quarters for the child, resulting in more minimal storage loss. After becoming a parent, the Dragonborn can engage in various activities with their progeny.\nBelow is a list of all adoptable children. Four orphans appear at Honorhall Orphanage by default, some are sent to Honorhall due to the death of their parent(s) or guardian(s), and four adoptable children are made available upon installing \"Hearthfire\".\nInvincibility.\nChildren cannot be killed, injured, or knocked unconscious, nor can they be &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;ed. However, when hit, a child's name and health will pop up, but the child will still be at full health. Additionally, children will run away when hit. &lt;a href=\"Shouts\"&gt;Shouts&lt;/a&gt; do not affect children. If a child is a witness to a crime, they will warn the nearest adult.\nHowever, changing a child's race using &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;console commands&lt;/a&gt; revokes their imperviousness. For example, entering codice_1 allows the child to be killed. Doing so causes cosmetic glitches. In this example, the child appears as a Khajiit with a human head; if the child is female, breasts and a bra appear on it. If the child's race is changed, they become naked. As they do not have &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt; in their inventory, children are skinned with garments on their avatar. As a result, their clothing cannot be removed, even with console commands.\nDoing a &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Skyrim%29%23Attacks\"&gt;charged attack&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lycanthrope&lt;/a&gt; can sling back children like any other character; however, they remain unharmed as they get up. When using a &lt;a href=\"Frenzy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frenzy&lt;/a&gt; spell near a child, they receive the &lt;a href=\"effects%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;effect&lt;/a&gt;, and every guard in the city tries to kill the child, eventually chasing them out of town. It is possible that the child may actually attack the guards back and kill them all, due to their inability to be harmed.\nDialogue.\n\"What... what am I going to do? (Sigh)\"\n\"\"\", look what followed me home!\"\n\"Look,\" \"! I have a new friend!\"\n\"A dog! Wow, I didn't know you had a dog! Could I... could I keep him?

She and Captain Kaleen are here looking for one of King Fahara'jad's former spies, Naruk. Naruk has turned against the Daggerfall Covenant and is now inciting war, but Kaleen is missing.\"\nWalkthrough.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Wolf%20Inn\"&gt;Dead Wolf Inn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;, you will run into &lt;a href=\"Nicolene\"&gt;Nicolene&lt;/a&gt;. Speak with her and she will tell you that &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Kaleen\"&gt;Captain Kaleen&lt;/a&gt; has gone missing. Kaleen and her crew are currently working directly for &lt;a href=\"Fahara%27jad\"&gt;Fahara'jad&lt;/a&gt; and are tracking a rogue spy named &lt;a href=\"Naruk\"&gt;Naruk&lt;/a&gt;. Kaleen was going to meet a contact on the road southwest of Shornhelm. \nHead southwest of Shornhelm. Once you arrive there, &lt;a href=\"Crafty%20Lerisa\"&gt;Crafty Lerisa&lt;/a&gt; will reveal herself; she was apparently Kaleen's contact. She does not know what happened to Kaleen though; she has not seen her. The only advice she can give is to talk to the town guard and ask if they saw Kaleen leaving the city. The guard at the southern gates will reveal that he saw her leave the city and come back with another redguard. He did not see anything else, so he advises you to ask around in town. Asking &lt;a href=\"Nirine%20Geric\"&gt;Nirine Geric&lt;/a&gt; will reveal that the two have gone up the eastern road. The beggar &lt;a href=\"Lazy%20Ludippe\"&gt;Lazy Ludippe&lt;/a&gt; can be bribed or intimidated into revealing that they're in the house behind him; head in and you will find a trap door to a hidden basement. Lerisa will open the lock for you; when she is done, head inside.\nHead through the big door ahead. You will find Kaleen lying on the ground; speak with her and she will tell you that Naruk saw through her and has been trying to torture her for information. Kaleen will tell you that she has gathered that Naruk is looking to poison Shornhelm's water supply. Naruk is in the sewers beyond the fighters guild. Head outside and follow the path north, past &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20and%20Saw%20Carpentry\"&gt;Hammer and Saw Carpentry&lt;/a&gt;. Then turn right to find the entrance to the sewers. Inside, you will run into many enemies, so come prepared. Your task here is to close the cistern gates and kill Naruk while Kaleen deals with the poison. The levers to close the gates will be on both ends of the room. Naruk will be standing on the other side of the water and will attack on sight. Once these tasks have been dealt with, destroy the barrels of poison on both sides of the water. \nWhen all of this is done, head to the Dead Wolf Inn and speak with Kaleen to finish the quest."}

They welcomed me into their homes, one and all, without the slightest hint of suspicion or uncertainty. Trust, it seems, comes readily to the Skaal.\nIn appearance, the Skaal are clearly of &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; ancestry. However, they are culturally distinct in several significant ways, the most notable of which is their faith. Having never adopted the pantheon of the Empire, the Skaal recognize only a single deity whom they call the &lt;a href=\"All-Maker\"&gt;All-Maker&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor the Skaal, the All-Maker is the source of all life and creation. When a creature dies, its spirit returns to the All-Maker, who shapes it into something new and returns it to &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;. The concept of death as an ending to life is unknown to the Skaal. Rather, death is seen as simply the beginning of the next stage of an endless journey.\nThis great respect for life is evident in one of the most important Skaal beliefs, a concept the villagers call \"one-ness with the land\". The Skaal try to live in harmony with their surroundings, making as small an impact on their environment as possible. When a Skaal villager sets out to collect firewood, for example, he or she takes it from fallen, dead trees. When the Skaal hunt, it is only out of necessity, and not for sport. Because they hold all life in great reverence, the Skaal people will resort to violence only as a last resort.\nThis has understandably led to a rather austere lifestyle for these simple, good-natured folk. For the Skaal, the word \"luxury\" is nearly an alien concept, though I was intrigued to note that one villager, &lt;a href=\"Edla\"&gt;Edla&lt;/a&gt;, has taken to trading basic goods with travelers who pass through the village in exchange for small luxury items. Such an enterprising outlook is something of a novelty for the Skaal.\nThough it saddens me to conclude this account on such a somber note, it is impossible to deny the hard truth that the Skaal people are dwindling. In a century or two, it is possible that their unique way of life will be lost to the world forever, reduced to little more than a footnote in the great epoch of history.\nThis comes as little surprise, given the immense hardships of a life lived in such an extreme environment. For the Skaal, it is a daily struggle to survive the perpetual wintry climate of northern Solstheim, but other challenges have recently appeared.\nThe ashfall from &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; has taken its toll on the plants and animals upon which the Skaal depend for their survival, and life is now a struggle for all who call Solstheim home.\nTherefore, I humbly beseech any students of history who might encounter this modest text to travel to Solstheim and learn all that can be learned of this noble people and their ancient customs. The Skaal people might not be long for this world, but let us assure that their proud and noble legacy lasts well into the future."}

It knew of nothing but itself, so it decided to be everything. It grew and grew, trying to fill the nothing with itself. As it grew it formed new roots, and those roots took names, and they wanted space of their own to grow.\nThen Atak learned that there were things other than itself. They were just like Atak, but went a different way from it. They saw and made strange new things that did not last except in how it changed them.\nAtak continued to grow until something came back from the nothing. It was like a root but had scales and eyes and a mouth. It told Atak that it was called &lt;a href=\"Kota\"&gt;Kota&lt;/a&gt;, and it had been growing, too. Now that it had a mouth, it was hungry.\nAtak named Kota for what it was: serpent! It put roots through the serpent's eyes. But Kota was old and strong like the root, and had grown fangs while it was away. It bit Atak. They coiled around each other. From their struggle, new things came to be. Atak learned things Kota had learned, including hunger, and so it bit Kota back. They ate and roiled for so long they became one and forgot their conflict.\nThey shed their skin and severed their roots and called themselves &lt;a href=\"Atakota\"&gt;Atakota&lt;/a&gt;, who said \"Maybe.\"\nWhen Atakota said this, the skin it had shed knew itself. It ate the severed roots and even though it was dead, it followed Atakota like a &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt;.\nAtakota continued to roil, and each of its scales was a world that it devoured. But now Atakota was not in conflict, and things had time to begin and end. The shadow wished it could eat these things, but its belly was full of roots that were growing.\nWhen the shadow could bear it no longer, it swam closer to Atakota and spat out the roots. Now that its belly was empty, the shadow almost ate them again and everything else it saw. But it had come to see the roots as its own after carrying them, so instead it told them secrets and went to sleep.\nThe roots found others and told them how they had survived in the belly of the shadow and how they were still able to grow there. When they shared this knowledge with the others it changed them, and they took on new forms with new names.\nSome of these spirits wanted to keep the names and forms they had chosen, but they had learned them through the shadow, and it was now in all of them, making them temporary. They learned of hunger and conflict, and they learned to fear change and called it Death.\nThese spirits were angry and afraid, but the roots showed the spirits ways between places from when Atak had made paths out of nothing. They could use these riverways to hide from Death.\nThe spirits were content and set about to make things that looked like them and shared in their aspects and loved them. They kept growing until they were as big as Atakota, and they forgot it came before them, and that it had a shadow that was sleeping.\nIn time, the worlds were too big and there was no more room. Again the spirits went to the roots to ask for more. But the roots had gone to sleep content with what they had made, because it changed so often that it did not need to grow.\nThe spirits grew so desperate and hungry that they tore at Atakota's skin and drank of its blood. They ate until they broke Atakota, so that Atak remembered growing, and Kota remembered being nothing. There was conflict again, and from the spirits Atak and Kota learned about Death, so there was violence, blood, and sap.\nIn the chaos the spirits were lost and afraid, so they ate others and themselves. They drank of blood and sap, and they grew scales and fangs and wings. And these spirits forgot why they had made anything other than to eat it.\nThere were other spirits that still clung to what they were and what they had made. A &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;forest spirit&lt;/a&gt; came and saw that the roots loved their children like she loved hers, so she taught them to walk and talk. They told her secrets with new words, and she sang the song back to them. The roots woke up when they heard this, and joined with the forest.\nThe roots saw that Kota's blood had made oceans, and Atak's sap had made stones, and each of these spirits had never known the shadow. The roots knew what this would mean, and asked the shadow to protect its children.\nThe shadow woke. It looked upon Kota and Atak and saw how different the nothing had become and how it was becoming the same as before. It remembered it was the skin of Atakota, and it was bigger than Kota or Atak alone, so it decided it would eat them both.\nAnd it did. The shadow ate the snake and the root, and the sap and stone, and the oceans of blood, and all of the spirits. It had eaten everything before it remembered the roots that were its children, so it looked unto itself to find them. When the shadow saw this, it remembered that it was a skin of something that came before, and it had eaten what came after, and this would be an end that always was.\nAnd so the shadow shed its skin, even though that was all it was, and it fell like a shroud over the roots, promising to keep them safe within its secrets."}

They call &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;, because it is where &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;the sky&lt;/a&gt; exhaled the North Winds on the land and formed them. They see themselves as eternal outsiders and invaders, and even when they conquer and rule another people; they feel no kinship with them (this especially with the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; in the days of the &lt;a href=\"Dwemereth\"&gt;Dwemereth&lt;/a&gt; and the first forming of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe breath and the voice are the vital essence of a Nord. When they defeat great enemies they take their tongues as trophies. These are woven into ropes and can hold &lt;a href=\"speech\"&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt; like an &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;. The power of a Nord can be articulated into a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;\"dragon\" shout&lt;/a&gt;, like the kiai of an &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; swordsman. The strongest of their warriors are called \"&lt;a href=\"Tongues\"&gt;Tongues&lt;/a&gt;.\" When the Nords attack a city, they take no siege engines or cavalry; the Tongues form in a wedge in front of the gatehouse, and draw in breath. When the leader lets it out in a kiai, the doors are blown in, and the axemen rush into the city. Shouts can be used to sharpen blades or to strike enemies. A common effect is the shout that &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;knocks an enemy back&lt;/a&gt;, or the power of command. A strong Nord can instill bravery in men with his battle-cry, or stop a charging warrior with a roar. The greatest of the Nords can call to specific people over hundreds of miles, and can &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;move by casting a shout&lt;/a&gt;, appearing where it lands.\nThe most powerful Nords cannot speak without causing destruction. They must go gagged, and communicate through a sign language and through scribing runes.\nThe further north you go into Skyrim, the more powerful and elemental the people become, and the less they require dwellings and shelters. Wind is fundamental to Skyrim and the Nords; those that live in the far wastes always carry a wind with them."}

The sword can be obtained as early as level one.\nPhysical appearance.\nChillrend is similar to a standard &lt;a href=\"glass%20sword\"&gt;glass sword&lt;/a&gt;, but the blade is pale blue instead of green, giving it the appearance of being covered in frost. While drawn, the blade emanates a vapor as if it were experiencing , and also makes a constant hissing noise, similar to .\nAcquisition.\nThe blade is found inside the tunnels under the &lt;a href=\"Riftweald%20Manor\"&gt;Riftweald Manor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Pursuit\"&gt;The Pursuit&lt;/a&gt;.\" Alternatively, it is possible to jump onto the roof of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Mara%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Temple of Mara&lt;/a&gt; by jumping onto the brazier or barrel on the left of the door, then by simply jumping onto the roof. If done properly, it is possible to use the shout, &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;Whirlwind Sprint&lt;/a&gt;, to reach the balcony of the &lt;a href=\"Riftweald%20Manor\"&gt;Riftweald Manor&lt;/a&gt;. The door on the balcony has a level-dependent lock which needs to be &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;picked&lt;/a&gt; before entering the manor. After fighting past the &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt; inside, the entrance to the tunnels can be accessed behind the false backing of the wardrobe on the first floor.\nNear the end of the tunnels is a small room with a display case that contains the blade. The case, which has an expert-level lock, needs to be picked. Also in this room is the &lt;a href=\"Bust%20of%20the%20Gray%20Fox\"&gt;Bust of the Gray Fox&lt;/a&gt;, a bowl with various &lt;a href=\"Precious%20Gems%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;precious gems&lt;/a&gt;, a valuable &lt;a href=\"Rings%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt;, a chest containing a valuable &lt;a href=\"circlet\"&gt;circlet&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; skill book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Red%20Kitchen%20Reader\"&gt;The Red Kitchen Reader&lt;/a&gt;\".\nEnchantment.\nChillrend bears a unique &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt; named \"Frostfeed.\" The enchantment for all versions of the sword is:\nLike all weapons that bear a frost damage enchantment, Chillrend is affected by the &lt;a href=\"Augmented%20Frost%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Augmented Frost&lt;/a&gt; perk in the Destruction skill tree. With a level 46+ Chillrend, the first rank raises the frost damage from 30 points to 37. The second rank raises it to 45 points. Due to its unique enchantment, it cannot be disenchanted at an &lt;a href=\"arcane%20enchanter\"&gt;arcane enchanter&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsefulness.\nChillrend can be said to be the equivalent of &lt;a href=\"Dawnbreaker%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnbreaker&lt;/a&gt; in frost enchantments. It is very useful for taking on Fire &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spriggan\"&gt;Spriggans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach\"&gt;Flame Atronachs&lt;/a&gt; and opponents weak against ice. Even against frost-resistance foes, the secondary effect of rendering enemies paralysed makes it invaluable in general combat scenarios. Additionally, investing perks into the &lt;a href=\"One-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;One-Handed&lt;/a&gt; skill would increase the base damage which the weapon inflicts.\nFast-moving enemies like &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;giants&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mammoths&lt;/a&gt; can quickly overwhelm the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, which is where Chillrend is also good for freezing them in place, especially when used with the &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Time\"&gt;Slow Time&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt;.\nFurthermore, unlike Dawnbreaker, it has increased effectiveness against the &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Spawn\"&gt;ash spawns&lt;/a&gt; in the DLC location of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, since they are immune to fire but presumably have an innate weakness against frost. \nDual-wielding Dawnbreaker along with this weapon allows the Dragonborn with a high enough One-handed skill level to overwhelm opponents, even if one's enemies are immune to Fire or Ice. \nSmithing.\nChillrend can be upgraded at a &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"refined%20malachite\"&gt;refined malachite&lt;/a&gt; ingot and the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Blacksmith\"&gt;Arcane Blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; perk. It also benefits from the &lt;a href=\"Glass%20Smithing\"&gt;Glass Smithing&lt;/a&gt; perk, which doubles the improvement.\nLevels.\nThe damage, weight, value as well as the magnitude of the enchantment are based on the Dragonborn's &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; the first time &lt;a href=\"Riftweald%20Manor\"&gt;Riftweald Manor&lt;/a&gt; is entered. The best possible version is available at level 46."}

The cave entrance is next to a small waterfall.\nThis cave contains the highest number of &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fungi%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mushrooms&lt;/a&gt; in all of , with notably high numbers of &lt;a href=\"blisterwort\"&gt;blisterwort&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Imp%20Stool%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;imp stool&lt;/a&gt;.\nInterior.\nThe initial chambers of Chillwind Depths are infested with &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frostbite spiders&lt;/a&gt;. It is, however, a good place for harvesting Alchemy ingredients; there are numerous mushrooms growing throughout the entire cave, and many nests of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"chaurus%20eggs\"&gt;chaurus eggs&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0There are &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt; veins as well.\nMany of its tunnels are flooded or partially filled with water. There is a hidden underwater chamber which can only be reached by diving. There are some breathing spots, making it possible to reach this chamber without using water breathing potions. The underwater chamber has a locked (apprentice) &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Random%20Loot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;random leveled loot&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeeper inside the cave is a small Falmer settlement, populated by &lt;a href=\"leveled\"&gt;leveled&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Chaurus&lt;/a&gt;. The bodies of adventurers and prisoners are scattered throughout the cave; among these is the body of &lt;a href=\"Firir\"&gt;Firir&lt;/a&gt;, on whom a &lt;a href=\"Torn%20Note%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;torn note&lt;/a&gt; can be found, which reads:\n\"\"They fell upon us at dusk. Dozens of them. The caravan guards were dead in moments. They took everyone else back to the pens. Blinded those who tried to resist.\"\n\"One by one they've taken the others away - feeding us to those monstrosities, or worse. I don't have much time left. &lt;a href=\"Eydis%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Eydis&lt;/a&gt;, my love, if you ever get this, forgive me.\"\n\"Firir\"\"\nThe last chamber appears to be a place where sacrifice rituals were held, with a stone altar and a dead prisoner body over it. There are blood stains and a &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20sword\"&gt;Falmer sword&lt;/a&gt; on the altar, as well as dozens of human skeletons in the water beneath it. Beyond it there is a room with good loot inside an unlocked chest to the left and on a table to the right.\nAlternative route.\nInside the cave, directly in front of the entrance, is a pillar of rock leaning to the left. The Dragonborn can circle around this pillar and jump onto it, then use &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;Whirlwind Sprint&lt;/a&gt; to jump to a spider web covered doorway (the shortcut exit to the cave). This allows looting the end room without combat and also provides an opportunity to get a sneak attack on the boss enemy at the end of the corridor (he spawns with his back to the corridor)."}

One is the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt; skill book, and the second is just a book. They have two distinct IDs but have the same content. They also have two different values: 20 and 70 .\nQuests.\nChimarvamidium is required in the following Quests:\nContents.\nAfter many battles, it was clear who would win the War. The &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; had great skills in &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;magick&lt;/a&gt; and bladery, but against the armored battalions of the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, clad in the finest shielding wrought by &lt;a href=\"Jnaggo\"&gt;Jnaggo&lt;/a&gt;, there was little hope of their ever winning. In the interests of keeping some measure of peace in the Land, &lt;a href=\"Sthovin%20the%20Warlord\"&gt;Sthovin the Warlord&lt;/a&gt; agreed to a truce with &lt;a href=\"Karenithil%20Barif%20the%20Beast\"&gt;Karenithil Barif the Beast&lt;/a&gt;. In exchange for the Disputed Lands, Sthovin gave Barif a mighty golem, which would protect the Chimer's territory from the excursions of the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Northern Barbarians&lt;/a&gt;.\nBarif was delighted with his gift and brought it back to his camp, where all his warriors gaped in awe at it. Sparkling gold in hue, it resembled a Dwemer cavalier with a proud aspect. To test its strength, they placed the golem in the center of an arena and flung magickal bolts of lightning at it. Its agility was such that few of the bolts struck it. It had the wherewithal to pivot on its hips to avoid the brunt of the attacks without losing its balance, feet firmly planted on the ground. A vault of fireballs followed, which the golem ably dodged, bending its knees and its legs to spin around the blasts. The few times it was struck, it made certain to be hit in the chest and waist, the strongest parts of its body.\nThe troops cheered at the sight of such an agile and powerful creation. With it leading the defense, the Barbarians of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; would never again successfully raid their villages. They named it Chimarvamidium, the Hope of the Chimer.\nBarif has the golem brought to his chambers with all his housethanes. There they tested Chimarvamidium further, its strength, its speed, its resiliency. They could find no flaw with its design.\n\u201cImagine when the naked barbarians first meet this on one of their raids,\u201d laughed one of the housethanes.\n\u201cIt is only unfortunate that it resembles a Dwemer instead of one of our own,\u201d mused Karenithil Barif. \u201cIt is revolting to think that they will have a greater respect for our other enemies than us.\u201d\n\u201cI think we should never accepted the peace terms that we did,\u201d said another, one of the most aggressive of the housethanes. \u201cIs it too late to surprise the warlord Sthovin with an attack?\u201d\n\u201cIt is never too late to attack,\u201d said Barif. \u201cBut what of his great armored warriors?\u201d\n\u201cI understand,\u201d said Barif's spymaster. \u201cThat his soldiers always wake at dawn. If we strike an hour before, we can catch them defenseless, before they've had a chance to bathe, let alone don their armor.\u201d\n\u201cIf we capture their armorer Jnaggo, then we too would know the secrets of blacksmithery,\u201d said Barif. \u201cLet it be done. We attack tomorrow, an hour before dawn.\u201d\nSo it was settled. The Chimer army marched at night, and swarmed into the Dwemer camp. They were relying on Chimarvamidium to lead the first wave, but it malfunctioned and began attacking the Chimer's own troops. Added to that, the Dwemer were fully armored, well-rested, and eager for battle. The surprise was turned, and most of the high-ranking Chimer, including Karenithil Barif the Beast, were captured.\nThough they were too proud to ask, Sthovin explained to them that he had been warned of their attack by a Calling by one of his men.\n\u201cWhat man of yours is in our camp?\u201d sneered Barif.\nChimarvamidium, standing erect by the side of the captured, removed its head. Within its metal body was Jnaggo, the armorer.\n\u201cA Dwemer child of eight can create a golem,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut only a truly great warrior and armorer can pretend to be one.\u201d\nPublisher's Note\nThis is one of the few tales in this collection, which can actually be traced to the Dwemer. The wording of the story is quite different from older versions in &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;is, but the essence is the same. \"Chimarvamidium\" may be the Dwemer \"Nchmarthurnidamz.\" This word occurs several times in plans of Dwemer armor and Animunculi, but it's meaning is not known. It is almost certainly not \"Hope of the Chimer,\" however.\nThe Dwemer were probably the first to use heavy armors. It is important to note how a man dressed in armor could fool many of the Chimer in this story. Also note how the Chimer warriors react. When this story was first told, armor that covered the whole body must have still been uncommon and new, whereas even then, Dwemer creations like golems and centurions were well known.\nIn a rare scholarly moment, &lt;a href=\"Marobar%20Sul\"&gt;Marobar Sul&lt;/a&gt; leaves a few pieces of the original story intact, such as parts of the original line in Aldmeris, \"A Dwemer of eight can create a golem, but an eight of Dwemer can become one.\"\nAnother aspect of this legend that scholars like myself find interesting is the mention of \u201cthe Calling.\u201d In this legend and in others, there is a suggestion that the Dwemer race as a whole had some sort of silent and magickal communication. There are records of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; which suggest they, too, share this secret. Whatever the case, there are no documented spells of \"calling.\" The &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; historian &lt;a href=\"Borgusilus%20Malier\"&gt;Borgusilus Malier&lt;/a&gt; first proposed this as a solution to the disappearance of the Dwemer. He theorized that in &lt;a href=\"1E%20668\"&gt;1E 668&lt;/a&gt;, the Dwemer enclaves were called together by one of their powerful philosopher-sorcerers (\"&lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrnak&lt;/a&gt;\" in some documents) to embark on a great journey, one of such sublime profundity that they abandoned all their cities and lands to join the quest to foreign climes as an entire culture."}

The Chimer clans followed the Prophet &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; out of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;ancestral Elven homelands&lt;/a&gt; in the southwest to settle in the lands now known as &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. As evidenced by Almalexia and Vivec, the Chimer had golden skin color similar to that of the Altmer.\nHistory.\nThe Chimer were one of several &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0who are descendants of the Aldmer. But unlike the rest of their Elven kin, especially the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, they appear to have more interest in worshipping the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, whom they consider to be more powerful, therefore more worthy of their worship, than the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0Due to conflicts about their religious beliefs, the Chimer eventually left the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; to search for a new homeland.\u00a0They are described as being \"dynamic, ambitious, long-lived Elven clans devoted to fundamentalist ancestor worship.\"\nVeloth's People.\nThe prophet &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; led his people out of their ancestral homelands in the southwest to settle in the lands now known as Morrowind (which was known as \"Resdayn\" at the time Veloth and his people arrived there). There they encountered the Dwemer, a group of technologically advanced Elves who mocked the Chimeri religion. These religious disagreements would eventually lead to serious conflicts with the native Dwemer.\nWar with the Nedes.\nAt some point the Chimer were known to have gone to war with the &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nede&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0After a few years, the Nedes controlled an area known as the &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;. Then the Chimer army came from the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt; and brought reinforcements from &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. Brothers &lt;a href=\"Balreth\"&gt;General Balreth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Sadal\"&gt;Legate Sadal&lt;/a&gt; were with a small elite force that took refuge in a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Ruins\"&gt;Daedric Ruin&lt;/a&gt;. The brothers sacrificed themselves to create the Brothers of Strife and defeated much of the Nedic army.\u00a0Because the Chimer had become the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; following &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;'s curse in 1E 700, it can be understood that this battle had taken place prior to the Chimer's transformation.\nDisputes with Dwemer.\nEventually, the Dwemer and the Chimer ran into conflict. Most of it was due to disagreements about the gods, but in addition it is said that the Chimer longed for the land the Dwemer controlled. At first the Dwemer experienced minor raids from the Chimer, but as time went on, the feuds between the two races started getting much more heated.\nWhile the Dwemer were an agnostic people, preferring reason to faith, the Chimer were staunch &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;-worshippers, and considered the Dwemer's lack of belief an affront to their gods.\nFirst Council.\nOwing to the threat posed by the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic Empire, an alliance was created between the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;. The High Dwemer King &lt;a href=\"Dumac\"&gt;Dumac&lt;/a&gt;, and the Chimer &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; of the Great Houses, &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0were chosen to repel the Nordic invaders. They were able to do this successfully.\nRed Mountain.\nThe final battle the Chimer had with the Dwemer was at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, where the Dwemer wanted to harness the power of the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; and attempt to achieve divinity. As the Chimer and Dwemer fought along the side of the mountain, suddenly all the Dwemer disappeared and were never heard from again (except for &lt;a href=\"Yagrum%20Bagarn\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;). After the battle,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; decided to try and use the Dwemer tools to see if godhood could actually be achieved through the Heart. He eventually found out it could be done, and convinced &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; to become gods with him. As the three used the tools on the heart, they betrayed Azura, breaking their pledge to her and used the heart to become the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, in her fury over this, turned the whole Chimer race's skin dark as ash and their eyes red. On this day, almost all Chimer became the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, or the \"Cursed Ones.\"\nRemaining Chimer.\nThe last known remaining members of the Chimer after Azura's transformation were the Tribunal, who after using the Heart of Lorkhan, became gods. Sotha Sil turned into a Dunmer after the curse, and Vivec chose to become part Chimer and Dunmer, resulting in Almalexia being the last pure Chimer alive. Almalexia later died at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;, who in self-defense killed her, after she lost her godhood and sanity. All that remained of the Tribunal was Vivec, who after the completion of the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;Nerevarine Prophecy&lt;/a&gt;, may or may not have lived past the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt; after losing his godhood."}

Chorrol was built specifically at the intersection of the two roads and it is built around a large Oak tree that is Chorrol's de facto mascot. Three streets in the city connect to the center: the northern street leads to the Orange Road and eventually &lt;a href=\"Bruma\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;, the eastern street leads to &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Chorrol\"&gt;Castle Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;, and the western street leads to Chorrol's residential district and the &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Chapel of Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the early second era, &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt; was the Duke of Chorrol. At the same time, the then &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Leovic\"&gt;Emperor Leovic&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperors&lt;/a&gt; legalized the worship of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt;s which lit the flames of revolution. Aquilarios banded together with the Colovian Cities and rebelled against Leovic in a conflict known as the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Revolt\"&gt;Colovian Revolt&lt;/a&gt;. Chorrol, along with the towns of &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bruma\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;, fought Leovic and surrounded the Imperial City. The rebellion eventually defeated the Emperor and took control of the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, when &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; Varen Aquilarios was tricked into triggering an explosion known as the &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, the blast broke the barrier between &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. This rupture allowed &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; to invade &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Since Mannimarco summoned Molag Bal from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, the Daedric Prince began to lay his wrath on the surrounding regions of Cyrodiil from the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Basin\"&gt;Nibenay East&lt;/a&gt;. Cities such as &lt;a href=\"Bruma\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;, Chorrol, and &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; were destroyed in the midst of the conquest and this event became known as the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;. Tremors from &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Rumare\"&gt;Lake Rumare&lt;/a&gt; ravaged the countryside in the Great Forest by destroying many settlements such as &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Rayles\"&gt;Fort Rayles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hackdirt\"&gt;Hackdirt&lt;/a&gt;, but it hit Chorrol the hardest.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20579\"&gt;2E 579&lt;/a&gt;, Chorrol was hit with a series of earthquakes that toppled buildings and even Castle Chorrol to the ground. Eventually, a chasm broke out from the middle of Chorrol, and it revealed the inner magma inside the planet. Many citizens fell into the fissure, and due to Chorrol's lack of resources, they built rickety bridges through the chasm so people would not fall although it probably did not help. &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach\"&gt;Flame Atronach&lt;/a&gt;s started to lurk out of the ravine and attacked passersby. Chorrol, despite its poor condition, was a sought out settlement for the alliances of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;. Chorrol's control was determined by whoever held the nearby &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Rayles\"&gt;Fort Rayles&lt;/a&gt;. The area had colloquially been known as &lt;a href=\"Covenant%20Territory\"&gt;Covenant Territory&lt;/a&gt;, and it was owned by the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, Chorrol prospered along with other eight cities in Cyrodiil. The city was under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Arriana%20Valga\"&gt;Countess Arriana Valga&lt;/a&gt;, a prideful woman who is a firm believer of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; and her husband, &lt;a href=\"Count%20Charus%20Valga\"&gt;Count Charus Valga&lt;/a&gt; was a defender of the faith and a follower of Stendarr. He left an enormous impact on Chorrol, and there is a statue that was built in northern Chorrol in his likeness.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%200\"&gt;4E 0&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; had planned to reform the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Knights of the Nine&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"West%20Weald\"&gt;West Weald&lt;/a&gt; and needed to gather the &lt;a href=\"Relics%20of%20the%20Crusader%20%28Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%29\"&gt;Relics of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt; in order to defeat the rising threat of &lt;a href=\"Umaril%20the%20Unfeathered\"&gt;Umaril the Unfeathered&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Auroran\"&gt;Auroran&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Gauntlets%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Gauntlets of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt; were last seen in Chorrol's Chapel of Stendarr when the ancient &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Casimir\"&gt;Sir Casimir&lt;/a&gt; stowed away the gauntlets in the chapel."}

There are two possible \"good\" outcomes. Depending on the choice you make at the end of the first quest, the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; will get one of the two outcomes and the second \"half\" of the quest will allow the Hero to accomplish the other.\nWalkthrough.\nFingers of the Mountain, Part I.\n&lt;a href=\"Teekeeus\"&gt;Teekeeus&lt;/a&gt; asks you to find out more about &lt;a href=\"Earana\"&gt;Earana&lt;/a&gt; who he had an argument with long ago and who now wanders around outside the Mage's Guild every day. When you speak with her she will ask you to find the book \"&lt;a href=\"Fingers%20of%20the%20Mountain%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Fingers of the Mountain&lt;/a&gt;\" on &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Top\"&gt;Cloud Top&lt;/a&gt;. You can report to Teekeeus and tell him Earana is looking for the book and he will tell you where Cloud Top is (placing it on the map). You only have to go there and retrieve the book from a charred corpse.\nThe Hero has a choice at this point. One possibility is to follow orders and give the book to Teekeeus. He will then give you your recommendation, and Fingers of the Mountain, Part I is complete.\nAlternatively, the Hero can give the book to Earana. She will tell the Hero to return in a day once she has studied the notes. True to her word, when the Hero returns, she hands over a piece of parchment containing her translation. Following the instructions will complete Fingers of the Mountain, Part I.\nFingers of the Mountain, Part II.\nThis \"quest\" is actually one of two different quests, depending upon the outcome of Fingers of the Mountain, Part I.\nThe first possible quest assumed the first option in Part I. &lt;a href=\"Earana\"&gt;Earana&lt;/a&gt; is upset that the Hero gave the recovered \"&lt;a href=\"Fingers%20of%20the%20Mountain%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Fingers of the Mountain&lt;/a&gt;\" book to &lt;a href=\"Teekeeus\"&gt;Teekeeus&lt;/a&gt;. In that instance, she asks the Hero to \"acquire\" the book for her. If the Hero agrees, they must sneak into Teekeeus's chambers and take it (easy way to do it early is to follow Teekeeus up to his room after giving him the book, he will open the door for you and then just wait inside the room and steal it back the chest will not be locked this way). Alternatively, the Hero can try to pickpocket the key from Teekeeus. If successful, Part II will end with Earana handing over her notes a day later, at which point the Hero can go and acquire the &lt;a href=\"Finger%20of%20the%20Mountain\"&gt;Finger of the Mountain&lt;/a&gt; spell and complete the quest. If Teekeeus is asked, he will reveal that the book is now missing, but he will not accuse the Hero of stealing it.\nThe second possible quest variant assumes the second choice was made in Part I. In this case, Teekeeus orders the Hero to recover the book from Earana's room at the &lt;a href=\"Grey%20Mare\"&gt;Grey Mare&lt;/a&gt;. Doing so is much easier than stealing the key from Teekeeus, as her door has only an average lock. Alternatively, the Hero can wait at her door in the morning before 8 AM or before midnight. Earana will go into the room at that point, conveniently opening the door, and it is a simple matter to run in and block it open (this same method works for Teekeeus). You have to come back to &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Top\"&gt;Cloud Top&lt;/a&gt; to cast the shock spell in the middle broken pillar. It will take some of your health, with the exact amount depending on your level. Her casualness with the book might be surprising, unless the Hero remembers her previous statement of having memorized its contents. Take the book back to Teekeeus to complete the quest and gain the Chorrol Recommendation.\nRefusing the \"theft\" for either character lowers that character's &lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt;. Refusing Earana merely results in the Hero being unable to acquire Finger of the Mountain and the quest will end immediately. Refusing Teekeeus prevents the Hero from gaining the Recommendation."}

Wheels creaked below the howling of the desert winds.\nMercenaries, swathed in chain and boiled leather, cursed the sweltering heat that broiled them under the unblinking sun.\nHearing their muttered oaths, Ehtelar was thankful for &lt;a href=\"Rahad\"&gt;Rahad&lt;/a&gt;, her trusted contact in &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;. The burly &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; was blessed with an unflappable practicality, born of his upbringing in the desert wastes.\n\"Dress lightly,\" he'd said,\"Loosely woven tunics will be your friend in &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alik'r&lt;/a&gt;. Wearing much more will see you cooked in your shell faster than &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;dreugh&lt;/a&gt; shrimp in a fishmonger's pot.\"\nShe had taken his advice to heart, dressing only in linens and investing in an enchanted waistband that kept her cool despite the oppressive heat.\nTrundling forward, the wagon train crested a windswept ridge and came to a rumbling halt.\nCurious, Ehtelar dismounted. As she made her way toward the front of the train, merchants confused by the sudden stop peered out from the awnings that kept the sun from their backs.\n\"My friend,\" Rahad said as she passed the head carriage, \"Your travels have taken you to many shores, but tell me: Have you ever encountered such a sight?\"\nAs he spoke, he gestured out past the road to the valley below. There, amid burnt stone and winding trails, great alabaster spires protruded from the sand like arrows fallen into thick sod, stretching for miles in the space between the ridge and its twin across the span.\n\"What is it?\" she asked, regaining her composure.\n\"I was hoping you could tell me,\" he replied, \"This pass is normally home to nothing but sand heaped in dunes for miles. Who can say how long that was buried here?\"\nRealizing an opportunity to make a profit, Ehtelar insisted they camp among the ruins for the night. The mercenaries, glad for a reprieve from the noonday sun, were all too happy for a break from their grueling trek.\nNight fell and their carousing was heard into the early hours of the morning. If there were anything untoward about the ruins around them, it went unnoticed in the din.\nDawn found Ehtelar and her companion picking a path through the spires in search of an entrance. It was almost noon before they found one.\n\"Here!\" Rahad cried out, excitement barely concealed beneath the deep timbre of his voice, \"I found a way through!\"\nRunning now, to reach her friend and see what he had found, Ehtelar rounded a bend in the stone. As she did, she was greeted by a terrible sight.\nHanging limp from a great spear thrust out from the crack was Rahad. His scabbard was empty, the sword that filled it thrust into a nearby dune.\nShe stood there, gaping in horror, as Rahad was lifted into the air, a great scaly head emerging from the sand heaped in piles about the ruined doorway. With one fluid motion the creature shifted its weight, throwing Rahad to one side as it began to clean the gore from its weapon.\nEhtelar shook her head in disbelief. She thought to call out, but realized the creature would probably kill her before she issued a second syllable. Slowly, carefully, she took a step back, then another. For a moment it seemed she would escape, but as her third step met ground, the creature turned.\nDodging back from a thrust spearpoint, Ehtelar found her ears deafened by a sudden burst of shrill music. Clapping her hands over them defensively, she stumbled back as her adversary uncoiled before her.\nRising, expanding its ribs until it had nearly doubled in size, its multitonal voice joined itself in chorus. Its shrieking harmony resounded through the sand until tiny grains fell away from the ruins in sheets. As it shifted, the stone beneath her collapsed, spilling her out toward her foe.\nIt was all she could do to grab Rahad's sword, buried to the pommel in sand. Suddenly within striking distance, she thrust the sword through the fiend's blackened maw. As steel met skull, the terrible crescendo of its voice began to falter.\nIn that moment, her opponent realized a simple truth: It no longer hungered for blood and flesh. It no longer wanted much of anything at all. \"How wonderful!\" it thought as the ground rushed up to meet it. If its reptilian mouth allowed, it would have smiled.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Lamia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;lamia&lt;/a&gt; spiraled to the ground, its hooked spear caught Ehtelar in the calf. Feeling the cold bite of steel, she was thrown off balance. For a moment it seemed she would right herself, but the stone she stood upon suddenly gave way.\nDown into the dark she fell, suspended within a cloud of sand that swept past the jutting stones and crenelated spires peering out from the shadows below.\nAs the bright, desert sky abandoned her, she found herself bathed in scintillating light. A field of stars sparkled around her\u2014not stars, for they were far underground. They were the &lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20Stone%20%28Online%29\"&gt;bright crystals&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;oon.\nShe fell for what seemed like days, her only company the flickering lights careening up at her from the darkness. \"If I could only grasp one of those tiny stars,\" she thought, her hands reaching toward them, \"I might become as ethereal as they are and leave this world behind.\"\nFrom below, a whisper grew to a rustling, wind like sound. Looking down, it seemed her flight of stars came to a hard edge\u2014rushing up at her in the dark."}

Memories of her short battle in the ruins above flashed through her mind.\nRahad, the &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; merchant who had accompanied her into the desert, was dead, taken unaware in the ruins above. His sword lay buried in the skull of the creature that did him in.\nShe remembered the sickening crunch it had made as steel met skull, the hideous scraping vibration in her arm as she drove it home. Then the ground had opened up, devouring the world to send her tumbling into the abyssal void below.\nHow far had she fallen, and for how long? Sand, then stars had accompanied her fall before the deepest darkness had swallowed her up, but she had no memory of landing.\nDeprived of sight, she felt around her to gather what she could of her surroundings. While her arms were free, her legs felt leaden under the sand that covered them and she immediately began excavating herself.\nAs she worked, the metallic tang of blood filled the air. Feeling her leg, she felt the warm grating wet that could only be sand in clotting blood.\nCursing under her breath, she undid her belt and cinched its cold leather just above the gouge in her calf. Feeling her way in the dark, she tore several strips of fabric from her tunic, winding it surely about the wound.\nIf it held, her handiwork would stop the bleeding, but she had no potions to stave off infection. She would need to find a way back to her caravan soon.\nStill blinded by the depthless shadow around her, she exhumed her other leg and began feeling in her pack for a token Rahad had given her.\n\"Nights in the waste are deeper than &lt;a href=\"Satakal\"&gt;Satakal&lt;/a&gt;'s belly,\" he'd said. \"When you lose yourself, pray to &lt;a href=\"Tall%20Papa\"&gt;Tall Papa&lt;/a&gt;. He will show you the way.\"\nHer fingers closed about the tiny coin. Pulling it from its hiding place, she closed her eyes and mouthed, \"Ruptga.\" Eyelids flushing coral from the sudden light, she opened them to survey the cavern sprawling out before her.\nHeavy stone blocks, shattered from the fall, lay in shards all around her. Further out, enormous pillars reached like trees up into darkness, casting long shadows out into the black.\nLooking up, her breath caught in her throat as the bright eyes and maw of the lamia gaped out at her from the dark. Though unmoving, Rahad's sword still embedded in its skull, it was half a hundred heartbeats before she could look away.\nStill recovering from the shock, she resumed her search and found several long, hooked spears scattered about the sand. Taking one up, she grabbed hold of her pack and slid down the lonely dune.\nBoots met stone and she braced her spear against one of the mighty pillars. Using it to steady herself, she stood upright.\nShe took a moment to test her wounded leg. When it became clear it would not fail her, she gathered up her pack, dusted herself off, and struck out into the darkness.\nIn the deep quiet, muffled by the vast expanse of nothing reaching out around her, her passage was marked only by a steady staccato of steel on stone."}

With a tongue full of platitude and supplication, he begged Juha-ri to share his knowledge, for the young one believed a dance capable of moving the Moons must be beautiful to behold.\nAnd Juha-ri gave the youth the smile he always gave to the young, one of sadness and pity. He asked the youth, how does one instruct a serpent to walk? How does one tell an owl to make fire, or an ape to pray? The youth took Juha-ri's meaning. He thanked the great Sage of White Sand for his words and began his long walk home.\nJuha-ri called to the young one, and though the Sage of White Sand spoke only the barest whisper the wind carried the voice as though it had descended from &lt;a href=\"Jone\"&gt;Jone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jode\"&gt;Jode&lt;/a&gt; themselves. Juha-ri offered to share with the youth his knowledge of the Dance. The young one was confused. No serpent could be instructed to walk. No owl can make fire. Were these not likened to teaching the Dance of Shadows?\nThe Sage of White Sand nodded. A serpent will always be a serpent, an owl always an owl. But the soul may become many things, though it may take lifetimes to become them. Many consider such a price too dear to pay, and they will never come to know the Dance of Shadows.\nThe youth nodded and stood in contemplation. And when Juha-ri returned to the Dancing Shadow temple, the youth followed."}

Years as acolyte to the Sage of White Sand had left a mark upon his corporeal self: a face that knew the vitality of youth was sunken. Fur was matted and coarse without its daily oiling. But the acolyte's eyes showed something of &lt;a href=\"Juha-ri\"&gt;Juha-ri&lt;/a&gt;'s wisdom, though it was muted by the hunger of the acolyte's remaining worldliness.\nThe Sage of White Sand offered instruction as the soul of his acolyte formed into its needed a shape that could heed the wisdom. Together they would experience moonlight in its distilled form, and walk paths that took strange angles through places tangential to dreams, but never dreaming. Juha-ri took care that his Acolyte see only the reflection of the &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Lattice\"&gt;Lunar Lattice&lt;/a&gt; off his eyes, for the Sage of White Sand had known too many that gazed on the glory and horror and went mad.\nBut even the reflection of the Lattice in the eyes of the Sage of White Sands was enough for the acolyte. In its myriad contortions and rhythms was found the bastion of existence such that could not be found elsewhere.\nThey returned to the temple, bodies caked in sweat, mouths tasting of lingering sweetness. The acolyte turned to Juha-ri, Sage of White Sand, and asked how the Dance of Shadows could impact the enormity of the Lattice.\nBecause they are the same size, came Juha-ri's reply. Because they are the same size."}

The eldest, who by the dutiful teachings of his master and the savagery of time had grown wretched and wise, went to the banks of the Darkarn River to fashion a litter of reeds.\nThe eldest bore the Sage of White Sand up the steps of the Dancing Moon Temple, and as he did so the brothers and sisters of our order followed. They burned moonlight in their censers. Fume and chanting wreathed the stone and sand and bodies. When the eldest had borne him to the mountaintop, to the vault where Anequina Sharp-Tongue had danced the last Dance of Shadows, the chanting stopped. The smoke of moonlight poured from our censers and the room was shrouded in silent gloam.\nJuha-ri, who was made lame through his long years of devotion, stood and tottered before the eldest on unsteady paws. He asked if the eldest recalled what brought him to the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Dance%20Ruins\"&gt;Dancing Shadow Temple&lt;/a&gt; all those years before. And the eldest nodded, for he had studied the sutras and knew that years were as brief as a single flap of a wings in winter.\nAnd returning the eldest's nod with his own, Juha-ri stood perfectly still. In the soul of the Sage of White Sand the eldest saw movement, chaotic and beautiful. It echoed through the lattice, swelling with reverberation off the fumes of moonlight and the great and small vertices. As the fuming moonlight burned his lungs, the eldest saw the Dance of Shadows was no demand nor supplication. It was an existence, nearly close to perfection. The lattice mirrored and perfected the form, and in doing so was changed, for a time.\nAnd as it started, so did the Dance of Shadows end. Juha-ri collapsed, his soul gone to the Sand Behind the Stars. The eldest heeded the lesson well."}

The Death of Lord Ihlendam\nIt happened in &lt;a href=\"Second%20Planting\"&gt;Second Planting&lt;/a&gt; (P.D. 1220) that Lord Ihlendam, on a journey in the Western Uplands, came to Nchuleft; and &lt;a href=\"Protector%20Anchard\"&gt;Protector Anchard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"General%20Rkungthunch\"&gt;General Rkungthunch&lt;/a&gt; met him there, and &lt;a href=\"Dalen-Zanchu\"&gt;Dalen-Zanchu&lt;/a&gt; also came to the meeting. They talked together long by themselves; but this only was known of their business, that they were to be friends of each other. They parted, and each went home to his own colony.\nBluthanch and her sons came to hear of this meeting, and saw in this secret meeting a treasonable plot against the Councils; and they often talked of this among themselves. When spring came, the Councils proclaimed, as usual, a Council Meet, in the halls of &lt;a href=\"Bamz-Amschend\"&gt;Bamz-Amschend&lt;/a&gt;. The people accordingly assembled, handfasted with ale and song, drinking bravely, and much and many things were talked over at the drink-table, and, among other things, were comparisons between different dwemer, and at last among the Councilors themselves.\nOne said that &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Ihlendam\"&gt;Lord Ihlendam&lt;/a&gt; excelled his fellow Councilors by far, and in every way. At this &lt;a href=\"Councilor%20Bluthanch\"&gt;Councilor Bluthanch&lt;/a&gt; was very angry, and said that she was in no way less than Lord Ihlendam, and that she was eager to prove it. Instantly both parties were so inflamed that they challenged each other to battle, and ran to their arms. But some citizens who were less drunk, and more understanding, came between them, and quieted them; and each went back to his colony, but nobody expected that they would ever meet in peace again together.\nBut then, in the fall, Lord Ihlendam received a message from Councilor Bluthanch, inviting him to a parlay at &lt;a href=\"Hendor-Stardumz\"&gt;Hendor-Stardumz&lt;/a&gt;. And all Ihlendam's kin and citizens strongly urged him not to come, fearing treachery, but Lord Ihlendam would not listen to counsel, not even to carrying with him his honor guard. And sadly, it came to pass that, while traveling to Hendor-Stardumz, in &lt;a href=\"Chinzinch%20Pass\"&gt;Chinzinch Pass&lt;/a&gt;, a host of foul creatures set upon Lord Ihlendam and killed him, and all of his party. And many citizens said thereafter that Bluthanch and her sons had conjured these beasts and set them upon Lord Ihlendam, but nothing was proven. Lord Ihlendam lies buried at a place called &lt;a href=\"Leftunch\"&gt;Leftunch&lt;/a&gt;."}

Originally Duke of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;, Varen became &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; of Tamriel by right of conquest. With Mannimarco's counsel, Varen led a revolt against the previous dynasty, the savage regime of &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperors&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, despite his conquest and victory, Varen was not the true emperor. Like the former Emperor &lt;a href=\"Leovic\"&gt;Leovic&lt;/a&gt;, the blood of the dragon didn't flow through Varen's veins. He was unable to light the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt;, as a true emperor must, by tradition.\nThe Dragonfires have remained unlit for generations. This is because the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a relic of the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Divines&lt;/a&gt; gifted onto &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Alessia\"&gt;Saint Alessia&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;\u2014was lost in the centuries following the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Dynasty\"&gt;Reman Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. Only this relic, traditionally worn by the &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Emperors of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, would allow a true-blooded ruler to spark the Dragonfires anew.\nAt Mannimarco's urging, Valen formed a group of companions to join him on an epic quest to locate this relic. These companions included myself, the &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; swordmaster &lt;a href=\"Sai%20Sahan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sai Sahan&lt;/a&gt;, Grand Chancellor &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, and Mannimarco himself. For years we scoured the face of Tamriel, following countless leads until we finally managed to located it.\nWhen we returned to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, Mannimarco played upon Varen's insecurities and convinced him that the coronation ritual, properly modified, could not only light the Dragonfires, but persuade Akatosh to invest him with Divine agency and gift him with the &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;blood of the dragon&lt;/a&gt;. It was only after the coronation ritual was attempted that we learned the extent of Mannimarco's deception.\nThe King of Worms used his magic to corrupt the power of the Amulet, causing the calamity which came to be known as the Soulburst. Sai Sahan and I were unjustly implicated in his death, made all the more suspicious because Sai fled as soon as he recovered, taking the Amulet of Kings with him. Grand Chancellor Tharn was an opportunist, and immediately cast his lot with Mannimarco.\nThe Prophet's story is one of mystery - he appeared one day on the steps of an abbey of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Ancestor%20Moth\"&gt;Moth Priests&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. They took him in and fed him, thinking him nothing more than a vagabond. They were shocked when they found him in the libraries late that night, poring over the eldritch etchings of an Elder Scroll. Only the Moth Priests themselves had the ability to read the scrolls, and they saw his arrival as a prophetic sign from the divines.\nAs they all do who read them, the Elder Scrolls eventually took the Prophet's eyesight, leaving him permanently blinded. And yet he continued to study them in his mind's eye, and eventually foresaw the great and terrible thread we are now faced with.\nWord of his prophecies spread far and wide, eventually reaching the Imperial City and the ears of Mannimarco. The King of Worms immediately arrested the Prophet for rumor-mongering and treason, and had the abbey, and all of its contents, burned to the ground.\nThe catastrophe that the Prophet predicted began to take shape almost immediately. Vast swaths of the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; were consumed by &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; fire, and the first &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors\"&gt;Dark Anchors&lt;/a&gt; fell the land.\nMolag Bal's invasion of our world had begun, made possible by Mannimarco's betrayal."}

In truth, he didn't ask me to write this entry, but I feel the need to keep a record of these events, whatever the outcome may be.\nThe Prophet's visions and nightmares are getting worse. He continues to witness horrifying visions of a future in which &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; rules our world. These don't seem to have a profound effect on him when he is awake, but at night, in those precious few hours where he manages to drift off, the visions become increasingly disturbing. He refuses to describe them to me in great detail, but he awakens violently, in a cold sweat, and it's obvious that they are wearing away at his sanity.\nOur ally, , has already proven extremely capable. The &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shriven%20in%20Coldharbour\"&gt;escape&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"the%20Wailing%20Prison\"&gt;the Wailing Prison&lt;/a&gt; was only the beginning. &lt;a href=\"The%20Vestige\"&gt;The Vestige&lt;/a&gt; risked everything to rescue me from &lt;a href=\"the%20Foundry%20of%20Woe\"&gt;the Foundry of Woe&lt;/a&gt;. I owe our new friend my life, my soul, and perhaps my very sanity.\nWe're now chasing every available lead in our attempts to find &lt;a href=\"Sai%20Sahan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sai Sahan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;. If we can regain the amulet, the Prophet believes that we might be able to challenge Molag Bal and save our world. As usual, he used a bunch of flowery words and obscure phrases I didn't understand, but his general meaning was clear.\nSometimes I wish I'd never left Skyrim and gone to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. I fought for a great man that I believed in, met another man that I came to cherish dearly, and had my share of blood and glory, but was it worth it? Cyrodiil will always be the place where I first laid eyes on that traitorous &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Online%29\"&gt;skeever&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt; and his sniveling toady &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. I don't know which is worse, Mannimarco's charm and eloquence as he prepared to backstab us, or Tharn's endless insults and irritating condescension. At least with Tharn we always knew where we stood.\nThe Prophet said that Tharn's part in this isn't finished. I can't imagine any good coming of that. After all, that sniveling son of a goat went right back to licking Mannimarco's boot after the &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt;. He'd do anything to save his own hide and preserve his family's status in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;.\nI must bring this entry to a close, I hear the Prophet stirring."}

Cadwell's like a wisp\u2014a little \"light in the upper marsh,\" if you get my meaning\u2014but he can be damned useful at times. And he shows up in the damnedest places!\nWhile we risked our necks fighting through &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Worm Cultist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Atronach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Flesh Atronachs&lt;/a&gt;, Tharn projected his smirking image to different parts of the castle, goading us on. We eventually got to the tower where he was being held, but &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt; was ready for us, and raised all manner of &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Online%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; to challenge us. In the end we defeated them and escaped with Tharn, but here's the topper: Tharn lied to us! He has no idea where &lt;a href=\"Sai%20Sahan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sai&lt;/a&gt; is being held, or where the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; is hidden!\nOf course, he claims he can help us find both, but when he admitted his lie, I lost my temper and laid him out on the floor with a single punch. Gods, it felt good! That was a long time coming.\nThat's when Tharn spilled the beans. He told that we'd been lying, and revealed &lt;a href=\"The%20Prophet%20%28Online%29\"&gt;the Prophet's&lt;/a&gt; true identity. Lord Varen immediately admitted everything, of course. I hope it wasn't too soon. It's vital that we maintain trust, and now I can see doubt behind the Vestige's eyes.\nTharn is such a lying &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skeever&lt;/a&gt;. All he cares about is his &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; and his family's status. Lord Varen believes Tharn's here for a reason, but I don't trust him and I never will. I plan to keep a close eye on him."}

I did not come by my position of influence through luck or nepotism, but rather through extreme discipline, ambition, and cunning. And yet, here I am, conspiring with idiots and fools in a musty hole in the ground. How the mighty have fallen.\nThe year is &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, but I am unsure of the precise date. I've lost track, given the gravity of the monumental task that is before us. After reading the previous entries in this chronicle, I felt it necessary to offer my side of the story, so that I am not misrepresented by future historians.\nWe &lt;a href=\"Tharn%20Family\"&gt;Tharns&lt;/a&gt; have held positions of power throughout &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; since the days of the &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt;. We are prized for our loyalty to the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, our deft political machinations, and our ruthless subjugation or elimination of dissenters within &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; territories. What we do is grim work, but it is necessary if the Empire is to endure.\nDo I sound boastful and egotistical? Perhaps I am. But I shall put these words to paper so that you, the reader, might understand my views and my actions and their place in the long view of history.\nFor nearly thirty years I advised the savage &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;men of the Reach&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=\"Durcorach\"&gt;Durcorach&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Leovic\"&gt;Leovic&lt;/a&gt;, as their long, brutish dynasty ravaged the Empire. They lasted longer than many of the would-be conquerors that came before them, but their alien nature and low heritage made them unfit to stand in the presence of the true-blooded sons of &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt; or Nibenay. Their most grave insult came when Leovic, youngest of their line, sought the hand of my sixteenth daughter, Clivia, in marriage, that she might rule with him as Empress. Like his grandfather before him, who married &lt;a href=\"Veraxia%20Tharn\"&gt;Veraxia Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, Leovic hoped that our family's connections and pure Nibenese bloodline would somehow legitimize his claim to the Ruby Throne. It was an exercise in futility, and it exasperated me to no end.\nSo, when &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt;, the son of a Colovian Duke and a powerful military leader in his own right, contacted me in secret and sought my assistance to depose those foul strangers from the north, I eagerly agreed. The war was long and bloody, but armed with my knowledge of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, Varen eventually led his army of rebels to the palace gates. Varen drove his sword into Leovic's black-blooded heart and watched him die, choking on his own life blood, at the foot of the Ruby Throne, and immediately declared himself to be Emperor. For my loyalty and assistance, he agreed to take my daughter &lt;a href=\"Clivia%20Tharn\"&gt;Clivia&lt;/a&gt; as his bride.\nAfter Varen's betrayal at &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;'s hand, it pained me to hand the reins of the Empire over to another outlander, but The King of Worms is a dangerous enemy. To insure the dominance of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; over all other forms of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, Mannimarco immediately cast the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; out of the Imperial City, then had all remaining dissenters arrested as enemies of the state. I did not wish for my name to appear on that very long list\u2014which only grew shorter when the executions began\u2014so I pledged my loyalty. In return, I was granted stewardship of the Imperial City. My daughter Clivia, still the Empress-Regent, became the titular ruler of the Empire. But Mannimarco remained the power behind the throne.\nOf course, Mannimarco turned on me the moment my usefulness was expended. I was marginalized and cloistered away in a tower of bones, and my daughter was turned against me, lured by Mannimarco's promise to teach her the dark arts that would give her mastery over life and death.\nBut know this, dear reader. I will take the Empire back. I will restore order out of chaos. That is my only ambition, and my ultimate desire. I will strike down any who stand in my way with all the fires of &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; sorcery I can command, and those who dare to thwart me shall be damned to the pits of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; for all eternity."}

I find it curious that &lt;a href=\"Sai%20Sahan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sai Sahan&lt;/a&gt; was affected so by his experiences with the other members of the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Companions\"&gt;Companions&lt;/a&gt;. Though I find his tolerance of\u2014and affection for\u2014that hulking &lt;a href=\"Lyris%20Titanborn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;she-troll&lt;/a&gt; distasteful, it cannot be denied that his willpower throughout his imprisonment was nothing short of legendary.\nWe now know where the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; resides. It is perhaps fitting that he returned it there. Sahan is better-read than I expected, but perhaps a bit too poetic. A clever and patriotic man of &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; descent might have immediately thought of the ancient citadel of &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt; and its association with &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; and the covenant of the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Divines&lt;/a&gt;. It is perhaps a great blessing that the &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt; has no such love for &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodilic&lt;/a&gt; history.\nSai Sahan is a curious individual. I have never considered the Redguards quite as contemptible as many &lt;a href=\"Nibenese\"&gt;Nibenese&lt;/a&gt; lords might, and I find him the most agreeable of the surviving Companions. He understands duty and dedication, serves those he knows to be his betters, and hones his craft with singular dedication. Despite his inability to resurrect &lt;a href=\"Sword-Singing\"&gt;a lost tradition&lt;/a&gt;\u2014for the best, probably, given its supposed implication in the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Redguard homeland&lt;/a&gt;\u2014Sai Sahan's abilities with a longsword are awe-inspiring.\nI recall a time during the war against the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperors&lt;/a&gt; when he rode at the head of a column of mercenary soldiers tasked by &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen&lt;/a&gt; to assist in the liberation of &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;. It turned out that &lt;a href=\"Leovic\"&gt;Leovic&lt;/a&gt;, scion of the Tagh Droiloch and then-emperor of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, employed those mercenaries as double agents. When Sai came before the gates of Leyawiin with his \"loyal\" troops, they turned on him, hoping to deliver the severed head of Varen's legendary &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt; Commander to Emperor Leovic.\nSecond-hand accounts of the citizens are often difficult to trust, but even if one takes simple peasant exaggeration into account, it is clear that Sai fought his way through two forces intent on separating his skull from his neck. When he returned to the rebellion base at &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt; weeks later, he did so with the scalps of eighty-six men and the news that Leyawiin had been freed.\nHe's never really spoken of it to me, despite my pressuring. Varen, of course, did not pry\u2014he used his own charisma and the overactive imaginations of the levies to spin a tale of glorious combat. One man against two armies. Sai Sahan, who single-handedly freed Leyawiin from Leovic's control.\nThe truth, I suspect, is far more brutal and bloody. One does not saw the skin off of eighty-six skulls unless one is burdened with a great deal of suppressed anger and bloodlust. One man does not take on six hundred at once. I think it far more likely that the Redguard fought a brutal, running battle throughout the city for days, murdering commanders and guardsmen alike until the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; and their mercenaries eventually quit the settlement.\nThat is what makes Sai Sahan so dangerous. He does not look to be the sort who would remain hidden away in dark alleys and backstreets, surviving by eating garbage, butchering, one-by-one, men so savage that the only way to frighten them is to become a murderous, invisible ghost, haunting the shadows of an occupied city. And yet, that is precisely who he is, and what he has done."}

I have been asked to add my words to these chronicles, and though I am no scribe, I will do my best.\nThe teachings of &lt;a href=\"Divad%20Hunding\"&gt;Divad&lt;/a&gt;, of &lt;a href=\"Abah\"&gt;Abah&lt;/a&gt;, of &lt;a href=\"Kalam\"&gt;Kalam&lt;/a&gt;, and of &lt;a href=\"Satameh\"&gt;Satameh&lt;/a&gt; tell us that while a warrior may hone his craft to perfection, or sharpen his sword to where it may cleave stone and steel as though it were air, the true worth of a swordsman is denoted by the quality of the enemies he draws to him. I find myself idly wondering if the great &lt;a href=\"Forebears\"&gt;Forebears&lt;/a&gt; would reconsider this philosophy if they could see us now, and witness our enemy, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Prince&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt first, I thought to write that my training did not prepare me for this, but after hours of meditation and the counsel of my once-&lt;a href=\"emperor\"&gt;emperor&lt;/a&gt;, I have come to realize that this is exactly why &lt;a href=\"Kasura\"&gt;Kasura&lt;/a&gt; and I trained and studied for so many years. The sword-singers of old &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; were said to be more than mortal, possessed of focus and skill far beyond what other men might achieve in a dozen lifetimes. While I cannot claim to have reached such greatness, perhaps my final test was not to wage wars alongside emperors, but to bring righteous steel to bear against the foes of all life.\nI harbor some doubts about whether I am ready for the coming struggle. I did not break under the tortures of the betrayer, but I did not emerge from the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Torment%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Halls of Torment&lt;/a&gt; unscathed. Torn flesh knits under the ministrations of my lord's healing magic, and my savage dreams are soothed by &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Lily\"&gt;Snow Lily&lt;/a&gt;'s warm voice in my ear as I startle awake in the dead of night, but still I am not whole.\n&lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tharn&lt;/a&gt; and I speak at length over games of skill and strategy while I recover, and I have spoken plainly about my worries. His contempt at my perceived weaknesses serves as a much-needed counterpoint to Snow Lily's tender words. I endure and accept it, for a warrior without humility is as flawed as a sword blade forged too rigidly. His words harden my resolve and keep my wit sharp.\nIt is difficult to set aside the many deaths at the &lt;a href=\"Abbey%20of%20Blades\"&gt;Abbey of Blades&lt;/a&gt;, and though we did what we could in the wake of the attack, it will be many years before Kasura is ready to train more students in the way of the blade and the mind. When all of this is ended\u2014should we survive, of course\u2014I would very much like to return there and help rebuild.\nPerhaps I will ask Snow Lily to come with me."}

Though the sons and daughters of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; are not my people, it is precisely the ruination of something so deeply, culturally significant that causes my heart to ache. In many ways, though neither &lt;a href=\"The%20Crowns\"&gt;Crown&lt;/a&gt; nor &lt;a href=\"Forebear\"&gt;Forebear&lt;/a&gt; will admit it, we are more alike to the &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; than we are different.\n&lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Varen&lt;/a&gt; honored me when he asked me to captain his &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt;. I trained many of the captains myself, drilling them in the arts of swordplay, leadership, and tactics. They were of many races and many creeds\u2014there was devout Nethynal of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, who would quietly recite the sermons of his heathen demigods each dawn. I also recall young Lucas Evane, outcast from his family holdings in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; over some political squabble. Not all of us were Imperial, and yet we took readily to their traditions, their learned ways, and even their food. We believed in the vision of the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, once.\nThis day it seems the Empire was just a dream, and &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt; merely a ruined shadow of that dream. I swore an oath to Varen Aquilarios to protect him and see his own dream of a reunited Empire come to pass, but as we now witness and I must admit, it will be impossible to fulfill that oath. Even now, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; is by those who would see their own petty leaders seated upon the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;, and very few of them are of its native soil.\nI mourn the loss of Sancre Tor and the broken Empire to the ravages of conflicts both cosmic and mundane, not because I hold any special love for Imperial ways, but because it is much like the fate of the &lt;a href=\"sword-singers\"&gt;sword-singers&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a broken line that only a scant few seek to mend for reasons that are unselfish or incorruptible."}

Without a duly-ordained emperor sitting on the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;, many prophesied the doom of the world. But like many such prognostications from provincial soothsayers, their predictions did not come to pass. Not yet.\nWithout the Amulet of Kings, &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; endured just as it did when the \"divinely-chosen\" wore it around their necks. The sun rose, people killed each other over greed and petty ambitions, powerful men dictated the fates of those beneath their stations, and they all woke up the next day to do it all again.\nI'm not hopeful about our chances against the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt;. It is the most ridiculous of follies to believe that, even if the spell works, one might actually challenge such a powerful entity and emerge victorious. The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; is a formidable warrior, but still flawed. In truth, I'd rather send &lt;a href=\"Lyris%20Titanborn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Titanborn&lt;/a&gt; on this fool's errand and save the Vestige for when we are better prepared. She, at least, is expendable.\nI realize just how foolish such a sentiment is\u2014and Titanborn, if you are reading this, try not to twist your ridiculous pigtails in a knot. I am a Tharn. Humility does not suit us. There can be no doubt. Our one chance is here and now. We take it, or perish forever.\nMuch of Tamriel has been spared the horrors of this engagement, and already the land recovers from the impact of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors\"&gt;Anchors&lt;/a&gt; in the places where they fell. Common peasantry would accept this as providence and laud the efforts of those who ended the Daedric melding of worlds, but their ignorance is bliss. My knowledge of the &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; affords me a terrible glimpse into the nightmare world that awaits us, should we not wholly dislodge &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal's&lt;/a&gt; grasp on this &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;.\nConsider, dear reader: Tamriel is a ripe apple, dangling precariously from the flowering branches of a great tree. For eons it has hung far above, well out of reach of the hungry teeth\u2014the Daedra\u2014who would feast upon it. But the rending of the cosmic veil caused by the &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco's&lt;/a&gt; tainted coronation ritual, cracked the branch upon which our aforementioned apple grows.\nPicture then, as we continue our quaint, agricultural metaphors, Molag Bal as the hog who grasps the nearest leaves of the stricken branch. His dung-stained trotters give him leverage as he pulls, hoping to tear the entire branch down so that he may feast upon the apple.\nThe efforts of those who stopped the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt; and shattered Molag Bal's anchors staggered the footing of the hog, sweeping his legs out from beneath him. Nevertheless, his fetid teeth still dig into the branch. If he is allowed to recover, he will begin his struggle yet again.\nWe must dislodge Molag Bal's teeth, as it were, through application of incredible force. Of course, we cannot use the Amulet a second time in the same fashion as we did at the Soulburst, but if I am correct\u2014and I always am\u2014a modification of the spell will allow a mortal to become a vessel of the &lt;a href=\"Divines\"&gt;Divines&lt;/a&gt;, an imbue him with the power of the Amulet.\nThe particulars of the magic itself could fill a book in and of itself, so I shall spare the reader the specifics, which are undoubtedly above the understanding of even learned scholars. It takes the formidable intellect of a Tharn\u2014and there are none alive greater than I\u2014to comprehend its complexities.\nIf we succeed, history shall record that it was the knowledge and ambition of Abnur Tharn that brought about the salvation of this world by guiding the hand of the Vestige. If we fail, then none will be the wiser, for we shall all become the lifeless, mindless servants of the Daedric Prince until the end of time."}

Can you imagine it?\nMy good friend, , has done an excellent job, though I find their name coarse and unpleasant to pronounce. Still, far be it from me to judge!

Her eyes of shining gold fill me with inspiration! It is her I shall now serve, for what is a knight without a lady love to protect? She was rather adamant that I bring her Light to the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; so that they can use it to traverse the length and breadth of Tamriel. I daresay there was a hint of fear in her voice as she spoke of the days to come, as though the destruction of Tamriel under the clawed, palsied talon of Molag Bal was somehow not the worst of it!\nIt is, of course, not my place to pry details from her that she is not already willing to share. A simple no\u2014punctuated, naturally, with the typical booming voice and flashing magic of &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; wrath\u2014convinced me that it was a poor idea to press the matter further. Lovely and radiant, but not kind or gentle. The Daedra, even the most benign of them, are like a hurricane off the coast. It is a dark sort of beauty, but you pray it does not come onto land and crash the ball, what?\nThe Harborage will do for a home, for now. Venturing outside is difficult for me\u2014I daresay Tamriel has gotten uglier in the years since I have been separated from it. Meridia's warm Light keeps my spirit soothed ever more.\nI must bring this entry to a close. I hear &lt;a href=\"The%20Prophet%20%28Online%29\"&gt;the Prophet&lt;/a&gt; stirring."}

Chrysamere is an \"unaligned\" artifact and not Daedric in nature.\nHistory.\nChrysamere was forged late in the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; by Asterie Bedel, an accomplished &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; swordsmith of some renown who was delighted in using the techniques of both &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; in crafting her wares. The heart of the blade itself lies her maker's mark: a mage's knot, which harkens back to the earliest days of Bretonic culture. It was influenced by the magic of Breton society\u2019s Elven forebearers, gaining enchantments as it was passed from hand to hand. It fought in the wars to secure &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Direnni\"&gt;Clan Direnni&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s role as lords of High Rock and was present at the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;first sacking&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. Its defensive enchantments were sharpened and retooled to protect its bearer in a protracted siege of the &lt;a href=\"Fellthunder%20Clan\"&gt;Fellthunder Clan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"giants\"&gt;giants&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt;, and it played a small but important role in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Glenumbra%20Moors\"&gt;Battle of Glenumbra Moors&lt;/a&gt;.\nArena.\nChrysamere, a scribe in &lt;a href=\"Alabaster\"&gt;Alabaster&lt;/a&gt;, a port city in &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, found a clue related to the location of Chrysamere. The location was inscribed on a tablet somewhere in Elsweyr. The &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt; found this tablet, and with its help, recovered Chrysamere from the province of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\nDaggerfall.\nLater on, the sword came to be in possession of the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Hero of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, either after they slew an ancient lich during a mission for the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;'s Knights' Guild, or granted as a gift from &lt;a href=\"Gortwog%20gro-Nagorm%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Gortwog&lt;/a&gt; for giving him the &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;.\nMorrowind.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; was asked by &lt;a href=\"Varus%20Vantinius\"&gt;Varus Vantinius&lt;/a&gt;, the Knight of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Dragon in &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, to bring him the sword from the sorceress, &lt;a href=\"Draramu%20Hloran\"&gt;Draramu Hloran&lt;/a&gt;, who dwelt in &lt;a href=\"Abanabi\"&gt;Abanabi&lt;/a&gt; Cave. The Abanabi Cave can be found southwest of the city &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;, Vvardenfell, Morrowind. In order for the Nerevarine to become a Knight of the Imperial Dragon in Vvardenfell, they had to fight Vatinius in a duel.

He is found on the road north of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Loreius%20Farm\"&gt;Loreius Farm&lt;/a&gt;, transporting the coffin of his \"mother.\" After this encounter, he may be found within the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; and later the &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Dawnstar Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, depending on the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn's&lt;/a&gt; progress through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; questline.\nBackground.\nCicero has &lt;a href=\"Cicero%27s%20Journal\"&gt;five journals&lt;/a&gt; that are scattered throughout his room at the Falkreath Sanctuary, telling the story of his slow descent into madness.\nAs is detailed by his journals, Cicero was once a member of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Bruma%29\"&gt;Bruma Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; before it was destroyed and later a member of the &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Cheydinhal Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, and was renowned for his cloak-and-dagger killing style. He mentions riots in &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; leading to the death of &lt;a href=\"Alisanne%20Dupre\"&gt;Alisanne Dupre&lt;/a&gt;, the Night Mother's previous Listener, and the desecration of the Night Mother's crypt beneath &lt;a href=\"The%20Lucky%20Old%20Lady\"&gt;The Lucky Old Lady&lt;/a&gt;. Voted Keeper of the Night Mother by the remaining Brotherhood members, Cicero fulfilled one last contract before starting his new duties; he was scheduled to kill a jester, with whom he slowly became obsessed. His attire and flamboyant manner mimic this jester.\nHe ordered &lt;a href=\"Garnag\"&gt;Garnag&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow Brotherhood assassin, to murder &lt;a href=\"Rasha%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Rasha&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hand\"&gt;Black Hand&lt;/a&gt; who had falsely claimed to be the next Listener. Eventually, through the months after the last Listener's death, the remaining Brotherhood members left the Sanctuary to look for contracts or food and never returned, leaving Cicero trapped alone in the Cheydinal Sanctuary. Eventually, he grew more and more insane from obsessing over his last kill, isolation, and due to trying to talk to the Night Mother and become her Listener. Eight years later, he wrote letters to &lt;a href=\"Astrid%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Astrid&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; to appeal for sanctuary, fleeing from Cheydinhal to Skyrim with the Night Mother's coffin.\nPersonality.\nWidely regarded as bothersome, obnoxious, strange, and insane, Cicero sports flamboyant attire and often speaks with a high-pitched voice. Cicero speaks to both himself and the Night Mother's remains often, and as such, he is considered psychotic. As Keeper of the Night Mother, Cicero takes his vocation very seriously, willing to wound or even kill anyone who questions or ignores the Night Mother's authority, although he was not always like this; as evident from his &lt;a href=\"Cicero%27s%20Journal\"&gt;first two journals&lt;/a&gt;, before becoming Keeper, Cicero was quite sane, comparatively speaking. His final &lt;a href=\"Contracts%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;contract&lt;/a&gt; involved killing a jester, and slowly, while most of his fellow assassins were being killed in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, Cicero descended into madness, obsessing over the jester, and adopting aspects of the jester's persona.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Delayed%20Burial\"&gt;Delayed Burial&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile traveling north of Whiterun, the Dragonborn may encounter a peculiar man in a &lt;a href=\"Cicero%27s%20Outfit\"&gt;jester's outfit&lt;/a&gt; with a broken-down cart. It turns out his name is Cicero and he will beseech them to aid him, stating he needs repairs for his wagon wheel to move his mother's (The Night Mother's) corpse to a new burial site.\n&lt;a href=\"Whispers%20in%20the%20Dark\"&gt;Whispers in the Dark&lt;/a&gt;.\nCicero is suspected of treason against the Dark Brotherhood when he continuously locks himself in a room with the Night Mother. He can be heard mumbling, but no one can hear what he is saying. Suspecting that Cicero and another member of the brotherhood are conspiring to betray the other members, &lt;a href=\"Astrid%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Astrid&lt;/a&gt; sends the Dragonborn to investigate. The Dragonborn hides in the Night Mother's coffin, eavesdropping on Cicero and his conspirator. While hiding, the Dragonborn learns that Cicero is, in fact, speaking to the Night Mother's remains, although she does not speak back; his private sessions with her were his attempts to verify himself as being the &lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener&lt;/a&gt;, the one person who can hear the Night Mother speak. Shortly after this discovery, the Dragonborn hears the Night Mother's voice, becoming the Listener. Exiting the coffin, Cicero at first suspects the Dragonborn of defiling the Night Mother's remains, but soon realizes that she has selected the Dragonborn as the Listener. Bitter that he was not made Listener, yet still excited to hear the news, he congratulates the Dragonborn.\nAstrid barges into the room, accusing Cicero of conspiring against the Brotherhood. Cicero explains that the Dragonborn is the new Listener; however, despite this Astrid gets ready to attack him. Violence is averted when the Dragonborn explains that the Night Mother spoke to them. Astrid sends the Dragonborn on several &lt;a href=\"Contracts%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;contracts&lt;/a&gt;, until she can sort out the mess.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Cure%20for%20Madness\"&gt;The Cure for Madness&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter killing Gaius Maro on his inspection route, the Dragonborn returns to the Falkreath Sanctuary, finding &lt;a href=\"Veezara\"&gt;Veezara&lt;/a&gt; wounded, &lt;a href=\"Arnbjorn\"&gt;Arnbjorn&lt;/a&gt; missing, and Astrid quite disgruntled. In a fit of defiance, Cicero attacked Astrid for challenging the Night Mother's authority, but was intercepted by Veezara. Surviving the skirmish, Cicero fled to the Dawnstar Sanctuary, Arnbjorn following close behind. Arriving at the sanctuary, the Dragonborn finds Arnbjorn bleeding heavily and searches the sanctuary for Cicero. Battling through several &lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Assassin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spectral assassins&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn finds Cicero, wounded and babbling. The Dragonborn has the option to kill Cicero, but if they decide not to, Cicero remains at the Dawnstar Sanctuary, even after the &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Death%20Incarnate\"&gt;destroys the Falkreath Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a Follower.\nIf the Dragonborn chose to spare his life, Cicero is found upon exiting the Dawnstar Sanctuary after \"&lt;a href=\"Hail%20Sithis%21\"&gt;Hail Sithis!&lt;/a&gt;,\" where he becomes a possible &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt;. Cicero is flagged as &lt;a href=\"Essential%20Characters%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;essential&lt;/a&gt; before \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Cure%20for%20Madness\"&gt;The Cure for Madness&lt;/a&gt;.\" and after the quest, if he is spared.\nWhile following the Dragonborn, he makes several off-beat jokes and humorous observations about the current location or quest. While not following the Dragonborn, he lurks around the sanctuary near the Night Mother's sarcophagus, talking to himself and tending her.\nCicero is a unique follower in the fact that he will often, for no reason, start to dance if he is a follower. This can happen at any time, anywhere, regardless of what outfit Cicero is wearing.\nCicero is also unique in that he is the only named follower, other than &lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Serana&lt;/a&gt;, who cannot be recruited into the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;. The only other followers who cannot join the Blades are the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20initiate\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood initiate&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEquipment.\nHis &lt;a href=\"Cicero%27s%20Outfit\"&gt;default outfit&lt;/a&gt; has no defense, and as such he will wear any armor given to him.\nIt is still possible to get Cicero's clothes after sparing him. Although it is not possible to take his clothing while he has it equipped, even with the &lt;a href=\"Perfect%20Touch\"&gt;Perfect Touch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;perk&lt;/a&gt;, by telling him to follow and then giving him any armor. He equips it, making it possible to &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt; his clothing if he is relieved as a follower, but in this case the inventory tells that the chance to pickpocket the hat, the shoes, and the clothes is 0%. Having him follow the Dragonborn once more allows for their armor to be retrieved. This can be used to get multiple sets of Cicero's clothes since each time armor is removed from him, his original clothes return.\nA copy of Cicero's default equipment, called the &lt;a href=\"Jester%27s%20Outfit\"&gt;Jester's Outfit&lt;/a&gt;, lies on a table in the Dawnstar Sanctuary, meaning it is not necessary to kill, pickpocket, or use console commands to obtain his outfit. However, the enchantments on this equipment are weaker and its value is less.\nConversations.\nGuard: \"You there! Fool! Hold fast. You've been accused of a crime against the laws of this land. What say you in your defense?\"\nCicero: \"Wh... What? A crime? Me? Preposterous! Poor Cicero is just standing here! Cicero loves order. Oh yes! He would never disrespect the law!\"\nGuard: \"You look like a crazy man to me. And what's in that coffin, hmm? Maybe some time in a cell will help loosen that lying tongue.\"\nCicero: \"Damn that Loreius. Oh, how he will pay for this treachery...\"\nGuard: \"You just keep quiet and stay where you are. Soon as my relief arrives, we'll all take a nice little trip.\"\nCicero: \"But the Night Mother is mother to all! It is her voice we follow! Her will! Would you dare risk disobedience? And surely... punishment?\"\nArnbjorn: \"\"Keep talking, little man, and we'll see who gets \"punished.\"\"\"\nFestus Krex: \"Oh, be quiet you great lumbering lapdog. The man has had a long journey. You can at least be civil. Mister Cicero, I for one am delighted you and the Night Mother have arrived. Your presence here signals a welcome return to tradition.\"\nCicero: \"Oh, what a kind and wise wizard you are. Sure to earn our Lady's favor.\"\nAstrid: \"You and the Night Mother are of course welcome here, Cicero. And you will be afforded the respect deserving of your position as Keeper. Understood... husband?\"\nArnbjorn: \"Hmph.\"\nCicero: \"Oh, yes yes yes! Thank you, thank you, thank you!\"\nAstrid: \"But make no mistake. I am the leader of this Sanctuary. My word is law. Are we clear on that point?\"\nCicero: \"Oh yes, mistress. Perfectly! You're the boss.\"\nCicero: \"Are we alone? Yes... yes... alone. Sweet solitude. No one will hear us, disturb us. Everything is going according to plan. The others... I've spoken to them. And they're coming around, I know it. The wizard, Festus Krex... perhaps even the Argonian, and the un-child... What about you? Have you... spoken to anyone? No... No, of course not. I do the talking, the stalking, the seeing and saying! And what do you do? Nothing! Not... not that I'm angry! No, never! Cicero understands. Heh. Cicero always understands! And obeys! You will talk when you're ready, won't you? Won't you... ...sweet Night Mother.\"\nCicero: \"Oh, but how can I defend you? How can I exert your will? If you will not speak? To anyone!\"\nCicero: \"Poor Cicero has failed you. Poor Cicero is sorry, sweet mother. I've tried, so very hard. But I just can't find the Listener.\"\nAstrid: \"By Sithis, this ends now! Back away, fool! Whatever you've been planning is over! Are you all right? I heard the commotion. Who was Cicero talking to? Where's the accomplice? Reveal yourself, traitor!\"\nCicero: \"I spoke only to the Night Mother! I spoke to the Night Mother, but she didn't speak to me. Oh no. She spoke only to ! To the listener!\"\nAstrid: \"What? The Listener? What are you going on about? What is this lunacy?\"\nCicero: \"It's true, it's true! The Night Mother has spoken! The silence has been broken! The Listener has been chosen!\""}

As I begin this new phase of my life, I have decided to finally keep a journal. So much has happened to me thus far, both within the Brotherhood and without when I think there is no record of what has transpired, it almost seems an affront to &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt; himself. So I am determined to make amends. Yes, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; has its own scribes and chroniclers, but it is their solemn task to record those events deemed important to the organization as a whole. Let this volume serve as the personal record of one man, a lowly assassin who has pledged his blade and his life for the Dark Brotherhood.\n23rd of Evening Star, 4E 186. I have arrived safely in the &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Cheydinhal Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, and have been greeted warmly by &lt;a href=\"Rasha%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Rasha&lt;/a&gt; and the others. Indeed, the level of support and acceptance shown by my new family is rather overwhelming. For this Sanctuary knows suffering, knows sorrow, for the &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ghosts&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Purification\"&gt;Purification&lt;/a&gt; still haunt its halls. So, who better to understand the plight of a brother who has lost home and heart? Who better to comfort one whose Sanctuary is no more? The &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Bruma Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; may be gone, but my dearest brothers and sisters will live forever in my dreams, just as their &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s live forever by the Dread Father's side.\n1st of Rain's Hand, 4E 187. Completed the baroness contract. She died well. Her handmaiden, less so.\n12th of Rain's Hand, 4E 187. &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt; suits me. With the destruction or abandonment of the other Sanctuaries, our contracts are plentiful, as are our bonuses. Still, we seem to be losing our footholds throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; at an alarming rate. There are rumors that the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hand\"&gt;Black Hand&lt;/a&gt; is split on our continued direction. Some favor expansion, the others consolidation. My personal feeling is that the Dark Brotherhood needs to, at the very least, maintain the illusion of being everywhere at once. it has become exceedingly difficult to fulfill (or even establish) contracts in provinces where we no longer have a physical presence, like &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. The more we ignore Tamriel, the more people lose faith in the Dark Brotherhood - our power, our services, our dedication to &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;the Void&lt;/a&gt;.\n27th of Rain's Hand, 4E 187. The &lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alisanne%20Dupre\"&gt;Alisanne Dupre&lt;/a&gt;, has been visiting with us for several days, down from her private residence in Bravil. She and Rasha had been discussing the possibility of re-opening the &lt;a href=\"Shadowscale\"&gt;Shadowscale&lt;/a&gt; training facility of &lt;a href=\"Archon\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, but ultimately decided we lacked the resources to follow through with the plan.\n28th of Rain's Hand, 4E 187. Completed the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%2C%20Arena%20District\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt; contract. I ultimately decided to pose as a &lt;a href=\"Adoring%20Fan%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;starstruck fan&lt;/a&gt;, and immediately got into the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Champion\"&gt;Grand Champion&lt;/a&gt;'s good graces. While escorting the arrogant fool through the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Forest\"&gt;Great Forest&lt;/a&gt;, I slashed his throat and left the corpse for the &lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bears&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Cicero%27s%20Journal%2C%20Volume%20II\"&gt;Volume Two&lt;/a&gt;.\n27th of &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Height\"&gt;Sun's Height&lt;/a&gt;, 4E 188. &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; is lost. The city fell to corsairs, and it's just a matter of time before the Sanctuary is breached. May the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt; watch over her children in their hour of need.\n5th of &lt;a href=\"Last%20Seed\"&gt;Last Seed&lt;/a&gt;, 4E 188. We received word today - the &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Wayrest Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; was raided and destroyed by the corsairs. There were no survivors. There are now only three active Dark Brotherhood strongholds remaining: The Cheydinhal Sanctuary, here in the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Imperial province&lt;/a&gt;; a remote Sanctuary located in a forest in Skyrim; and the &lt;a href=\"Corinthe%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Corinthe Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. The Black Hand has ordered the Corinthe Sanctuary closed, and its members integrated into our own ranks here, in Cheydinhal. I will embrace those new family members as warmly as I was, when I first made my home here.\n27th of &lt;a href=\"Calendar\"&gt;Hearthfire&lt;/a&gt;, 4E 188. The situation in &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; grows more dire. The city has erupted in violence, due to a war of control being waged by Cyrodiil's two largest &lt;a href=\"skooma\"&gt;skooma&lt;/a&gt; traffickers. The Listener, Alisanne Dupre, has been forced to employ sellswords to protect her own residence.\n1st of &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dusk\"&gt;Sun's Dusk&lt;/a&gt;, 4E 188. Things in Bravil have come to a head. The statue of the &lt;a href=\"Lucky%20Old%20Lady\"&gt;Lucky Old Lady&lt;/a&gt; has been destroyed, and Alisanne Dupre has left her residence to guard the &lt;a href=\"crypt%20of%20the%20Night%20Mother\"&gt;crypt of the Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;, hidden below the remains of the statue. If the crypt is discovered, Alisanne Dupre will, of course, protect the remains of the Unholy Matron until her dying breath. Rasha is sending &lt;a href=\"Garnag\"&gt;Garnag&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andronica\"&gt;Andronica&lt;/a&gt; to aid in the crypt's defense. I begged to accompany them, but Rasha wouldn't have it. He says my place is here, defending this Sanctuary, and I must of course respect that decision.\n12th of Sun's Dusk, 4E 188. Botched my contract and forfeited the bonus. The silk merchant was already cold, and I was halfway through the window, when her daughter stepped into the room. I had little choice at that point.\n21st of Sun's Dusk, 4E 188. So much has happened since my last entry. After Garnag and Andronica left for Bravil, we stopped receiving communications from the city. We feared the worst. This morning, those fears were confirmed, when Garnag returned alone, transporting a most precious cargo - the great stone coffin of the Night Mother herself. The story Garnag told could curl the blood of even the most hardened of Sithis' servants. The crypt of the Night Mother, raided. Dearest sister Andronica, cut to pieces. And the Listener herself, the most honored Alisanne Dupre, burned alive in a storm of mage &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;. Garnag, through gravely injured (he will most certainly lose his right eye), managed to fend off the attackers, and transport the Night Mother's coffin safely out of the city. He has been on the road, making his way back here, since that tragic night.\n&lt;a href=\"Cicero%27s%20Journal%2C%20Volume%20III\"&gt;Volume Three&lt;/a&gt;.\n23rd of Sun's Dusk, 4E 188. Now that things have settled down, the reality of our situation has finally come to bear - we are a Dark Brotherhood without a Listener. With no Listener, &lt;a href=\"the%20Black%20Sacrament\"&gt;the Black Sacrament&lt;/a&gt; will go unheard. Surely the Night Mother will speak to someone soon, thus choosing a new Listener to take Alisanne Dupre's place. Until that happens, though, we must take to the streets. We must hear the pleas of the desperate and vengeful. The people of Tamriel must not know, must never know, that their prayers to the Night Mother are going unheeded.\n24th of MorningStar, 4E 189. It is a new year, and two months since the Night Mother first arrived here at the Cheydinhal Sanctuary, and still the Unholy Matron has not seen fit to speak to any one of us. And so, Rasha has decided to revive an ancient Dark Brotherhood tradition - the appointing of a Keeper, a guardian whose sole duty is the safeguarding of the Night Mother's remains. The remaining members of the Black Hand will make their decision tomorrow.\n25th of MorningStar, 4E 189. I have been chosen. By some incomprehensible twist of fate, the Black Hand has named me the Night Mother's Keeper. In all honesty, I am both incredibly honored and deeply saddened. This means the end of my contracts. I'll be lucky to lift a blade again. Thankfully, Rasha has promised me one final contract before I accept my new duties.\n30th of MorningStar, 4E 189. The jester lies dead. My final contract has been completed. Oh, how he laughed and laughed. Until he didn't.\n3rd of First Seed, 4E 189. I have settled well into my new role as Keeper. It is my duty to not only keep the Night Mother's shrine clean, and the candles lit, but to tend to the body as well. The Night Mother's crypt was a consecrated place - shroud-kissed, absent of sunlight, and safe from the world above. Removed from there; the remains are subject to the filth and corruption of the living. The body is perfectly preserved, so the concern is not physical, but rather spiritual - the remains must be sanctified regularly, so that they may continue to serve as a conduit for the Night Mother's soul. Our Matron's eternal spirit may travel the Void freely, but it is through her own earthly remain that she communicates with the Listener. And so, I wash the corpse weekly with the requisite oils, recite the ancient incantations, and personally see to the extermination of any insects or rodents. If the Night Mother does not speak, it will be because she chooses not to - not because she is unable. This is my responsibility. This is my vow.\n12th of Mid year, 4E 189. Months and months and months and no Listener. Why won't the Night Mother speak to me? I am worthy as Keeper, but not as Listener? I protect our Lady, keep her sanctified, but still she will not grace me with her voice?\n4th of Sun's Height, 4E 189. So long since I worked my blade. So long since I saved a soul. But I am now Keeper. No longer a taker. I think back fondly on my hours with the jester. His laughter, his screams, his pitiful cries. And then, as the end drew near, his laughter once more. Merry in death as well in life. I was honored to know him.\n&lt;a href=\"Cicero%27s%20Journal%2C%20Volume%20IV\"&gt;Volume Four&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st of Hearthfire, 4E 189. Cheydinhal has errupted into violece and chaos, like so many other cities before it. The Sanctuary has remained unbreached, but for how long? Our numbers are few, and with no Speaker, the contracts have dwindled almost to nothingness. Rasha's hold on the Sanctuary is slipping.\n26th of &lt;a href=\"Frostfall\"&gt;Frostfall&lt;/a&gt;, 4E 189. Silence! Deafening silence! In my head in my head in my head. It is the silence of death, the silence of the Void. Seeping into me, through the Mother. The silence is hatred. The silence is rage. The silence is love.\n4th of Evening Star, 4E 189. Today, Rasha declared himself Listener, claiming the Night Mother spoke to him at last. But when questioned, he could not name the Binding Words. Liar! Deceiver! His charade must not stand.\n5th of Evening Star, 4E 189. Rasha is dead. As commanded by the silence, so did I obey. I did not wield the knife, oh no, but dipped the honey softly sweet, into Garnag's eager ear. He is a good brother. A loyal brother. To both Cicero and our Matron. He did the deed, gladly.\n10th of Sun's Dawn, 4E 190. Only three of us left. Cicero, Garnag, &lt;a href=\"Pontius\"&gt;Pontius&lt;/a&gt;.\n15th of Sun's Dawn, 4E 190. The Night Mother remains silent. I remain unworthy. The Sanctuary remains doomed.\n3rd of First Seed, 4E 190. I can hear it. Deeper, and deeper. Louder and louder, punctuating the silence like thunder on a calm evening. Laughter.\n4th of First Seed, 4E 190. Laughing, laughing, laughing, laughing! It is the jester! A voice from the Void, to cheer poor Cicero! I accept your gift, dearest Night Mother. Thank you for my laughter. Thank you for my friend.\n16th of Rain's Hand, 4E 191. Pontius is dead. A Dark Brotherhood assassin was killed by a common bandit while walking the streets of Cheydinhal. How can something so sad be so funny?\n17th of Rain's Hand, 4E 191. I love the laughter, dearest Night Mother, but still I long to hear your voice. It's not too late! Speak to me, that I may set things right! I can save the Sanctuary, I can save the Brotherhood! You can have the laughter! Take it back! An exchange, then? The laughter for your voice?\n2nd of Second Seed, 4E 191. It's not safe to leave the Sanctuary. We'll stay here. All is well.\n29th of Last Seed, 4E 191. Garnag is gone. Gone gone gone gone gone. Left to get food, but he'll be back. It's only been three months. Three months. Tree months? Twelve moths? Four sloths!\n21st of Sun's Dusk, 4E 192. Cicero is dead! Cicero is born! The laughter has filled me, filled me so very completely. I am the laughter. I am the jester. The soul that has served as my constant companion for so long has breached the veil of the Void finally and forever. It is now in me. It is me. The world has seen the last of Cicero the man. Behold Cicero, Fool of hearts - laughter incarnate!\n28th of Sun's Dusk, 4E 200. Found the old journal, decided to write, a treatise on silence, sound, darkness, and light! How long has it been since the Night Mother first came here? How long since I was made Keeper? How long since I became the fool? Since I've been alone? Since Cheydinhal fell? Since they started pounding on the door, like so many hammered heartbearts? It's dark in here, and quiet. Poor Cicero no longer hears the laughter, for he is the laughter. There is no Listener in Cheydinhal. No Listener in Cyrodiil. No Listener in me. We must leave here. Before the Sanctuary falls. Before the Night Mother burns. Before the Dark Brotherhood withers. Before the laughter dies.\n29th of Sun's Dusk, 4E 200. I took a stroll, and spied a maid, but Matron's duty stayed my blade. So busy now, I miss the thrill, if only I had time to kill.\n&lt;a href=\"Cicero%27s%20Journal%2C%20Final%20Volume\"&gt;Final Volume&lt;/a&gt;.\n30th of Sun's Dusk, 4E 200. I have written the letters. So polite. So official! To &lt;a href=\"Astrid%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Astrid&lt;/a&gt;, in Skyrim. Her Sanctuary still stands. Still operates. But how? No Listener means no Black Sacrament, no Black Sacrament means no contracts. Her family can abandon the Old Ways, and still survive, still kill, but is that family still Brotherhood? Or something else? Something new.\nSomething different.\nSomething wrong?\nSomething wrong.\nStill, we must go! Tomorrow, we set sail. Float on a boat through the moat called the sea her and me!\n22nd of Evening Star, 4E 200. Sick sick sick of the rocking tossing rolling throwing upon the gray gray waves! I've been reading of Skyrim, of the good days, the old days, of the Old Ways. There was another Sanctuary once. A Dawnstar Sanctuary. Good, ancient and strong. Blessed by Sithis. Cicero will go there! No need of Astrid! The Mother and I will settle, and she will speak to me, finally, and we will build the Old Ways anew, together.\n23rd of Evening Star, 4E 200. The passphrase is mine! I have found it, in a letter ancient as the Sanctuary itself. &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Door\"&gt;The Black Door&lt;/a&gt; will ask \"What is life's greatest illusion?\" I am to answer - \"Innocence my brother.\" Finally, a space, a place, to call my own! A joker's retreat for the Fool of Hearts!!!!\n4th of First Seed, 4E 201. The Sanctuary is home! As I had dared hope! Cool and dark and lovely. My Sanctuary, Sanctuary from all. I know its every corner, every hall, every shadowed nook and alcove. My Sanctuary. The guardians know me, recognize me as Keeper. They leave poor Cicero alone. The big ugly beast - a different story. He'd eat me if he could, but to bind me, grind me, he'd need to find me. And Cicero will make sure that does not happen. For I have Sanctuary! Sanctuary from all.\n13th of First Seed, 4E 201. The Sanctuary is safety, and salvation. But silent, so silent. I give my love to the Unholy Matron. I give my laughter freely. But I do not hear her. The silence has returned. Now that I am laughter, and no longer hear laughter, I once again hear the silence. The silence of the Void. It reached across time and space. Its silence is deafening, once more.\n1st of Rain's Hand, 4E 201. Mother and Keeper must go. I am not the Listener, and never will be. But I am the Keeper. I must serve my Mother's will above my own. I must find her Listener. I must teach Astrid the error of her ways, the beauty and necessity of the Old Ways. I have sent the letter to Astrid. We leave soon. But Cicero will keep this Sanctuary as his Sanctuary! A place to rest and ply my trade, for I once more take up the blade, and send some lucky souls to Him, when laughter strikes, as fits my whim!"}

The book mentions the killing of a baroness, the physical absence of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hand\"&gt;Black Hand&lt;/a&gt;, and how it has affected the power scale of the Brotherhood, and Cicero's personal conflicts with &lt;a href=\"Rasha%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Rasha&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;i &lt;a href=\"Speaker\"&gt;Speaker&lt;/a&gt;. Also mentioned here are the presence of the last known &lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener&lt;/a&gt;, a female &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Alisanne%20Dupre\"&gt;Alisanne Dupre&lt;/a&gt;, her desire to reestablish the recruitment of &lt;a href=\"Shadowscale\"&gt;Shadowscale&lt;/a&gt;s, and Cicero's posing as a fan of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%2C%20Arena%20District\"&gt;Arena's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Champion\"&gt;Grand Champion&lt;/a&gt;. The latter led to rumors that the &lt;a href=\"Adoring%20Fan%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Adoring Fan&lt;/a&gt; of and Cicero were the same person. First in a &lt;a href=\"Cicero%27s%20Journal\"&gt;series of five&lt;/a&gt;, the following editions are: &lt;a href=\"Cicero%27s%20Journal%20-%20Volume%202\"&gt;\"Volume 2\"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cicero%27s%20Journal%20-%20Volume%203\"&gt;\"Volume 3\"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cicero%27s%20Journal%20-%20Volume%204\"&gt;\"Volume 4\"&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Cicero%27s%20Journal%20-%20Final%20Volume\"&gt;\"Final Volume\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nContents.\n8th of Evening Star\n4E 186 As I begin this new phase of my life, I have decided to finally keep a journal. So much has happened to me thus far, both within the Brotherhood and without - when I think there is no record of what has transpired, it almost seems an affront to &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt; himself. So I am determined to make amends.\nYes, the Dark Brotherhood has its own scribes and chroniclers, but it is their solemn task to record those events deemed important to the organization as a whole. Let this volume serve as the personal record of one man, a lowly assassin who has pledged his blade and his life for the Dark Brotherhood.\n23rd of Evening Star\n4E 186 I have arrived safely in the &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Cheydinhal Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, and have been greeted warmly by Rasha and the others. Indeed, the level of support and acceptance shown by my new family is rather overwhelming. For this Sanctuary knows suffering, knows sorrow, for the ghosts of Purification still haunt its halls. So, who better to understand the plight of a brother who has lost home and heart? Who better to comfort one whose Sanctuary is no more?\nThe Bruma Sanctuary may be gone, but my dearest brothers and sisters will live forever in my dreams, just as their souls live forever by the Dread Father's side.\n1st of Rain's Hand\n4E 187 Completed the baroness contract. She died well. Her handmaiden, less so.\n12th of Rain's Hand\n4E 187 Cheydinhal suits me. With the destruction or abandonment of the other Sanctuaries, our contracts are plentiful, as are our bonuses.\nStill, we seem to be losing our footholds throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; at an alarming rate. There are rumors that the Black Hand is split on our continued direction. Some favor expansion, the others consolidation.\nMy personal feeling is that the Dark Brotherhood needs to, at the very least, maintain the illusion of being everywhere at once. It has become exceedingly difficult to fulfill (or even establish) contracts in provinces where we no longer have a physical presence, like &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. The more we ignore Tamriel, the more people lose faith in the Dark Brotherhood - our power, our services, our dedication to the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;.\n27th of Rain's Hand\n4E 187 The Listener, Alisanne Dupre, has been visiting with us for several days, down from her private residence in &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;. She and Rasha had been discussing the possibility of re-opening the Shadowscale training facility of &lt;a href=\"Archon\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, but ultimately decided we lacked the resources to follow through with the plan.\n27th of Rain's Hand\n4E 187 Completed the Arena contract. I ultimately decided to pose as a &lt;a href=\"Adoring%20Fan%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;starstruck fan&lt;/a&gt;, and immediately got into the Grand Champion's good graces. While escorting the arrogant fool through the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Forest\"&gt;Great Forest&lt;/a&gt;, I slashed his throat and left the corpse for the bears."}

May the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt; watch over her children in their hour of need.\n5th of Last Seed\n4E 188 We received word today - the &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Wayrest Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; was raided and destroyed by the corsairs.

I will embrace those new family members as warmly as I was, when I first made my home here.\n27th of Hearthfire\n4E 188 The situation in &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; grows more dire. The city has erupted in violence, due to a war of control being waged by &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;'s two largest &lt;a href=\"skooma\"&gt;skooma&lt;/a&gt; traffickers. The &lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alisanne%20Dupre\"&gt;Alisanne Dupre&lt;/a&gt;, has been forced to employ sellswords to protect her own residence.\n1st of Sun's Dusk\n4E 188 Things in Bravil have come to a head. The statue of &lt;a href=\"the%20Lucky%20Old%20Lady\"&gt;the Lucky Old Lady&lt;/a&gt; has been destroyed, and Alisanne Dupre has left her residence to guard the crypt of the Night Mother, hidden below the remains of the statue. If the crypt is discovered, Alisanne Dupre will, of course, protect the remains of the Unholy Matron until her dying breath.\n&lt;a href=\"Rasha%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Rasha&lt;/a&gt; is sending &lt;a href=\"Garnag\"&gt;Garnag&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andronica\"&gt;Andronica&lt;/a&gt; to aid in the crypt's defense. I begged to accompany them, but Rasha wouldn't have it. He says my place is here, defending this Sanctuary, and I must of course respect that decision.\n12th of Sun's Dusk\n4E 188 Botched my contract and forfeited the bonus. The silk merchant was already cold, and I was halfway through the window, when her daughter stepped into the room. I had little choice at that point\n21st of Sun's Dusk\n4E 188 So much has happened since my last entry. After Garnag and Andronica left for Bravil, we stopped receiving communications from the city. We feared the worst. This morning, those fears were confirmed, when Garnag returned alone, transporting a most precious cargo - the great stone coffin of the Night Mother herself.\nThe story Garnag told could curl the blood of even the most hardened of Sithis' servants. The crypt of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;, raided. Dearest sister Andronica, cut to pieces. And the Listener herself, the most honored Alisanne Dupre, burned alive in a storm of mage fire.\nGarnag, though gravely injured (he will most certainly lose his right eye), managed to fend off the attackers, and transport the Night Mother's coffin safely out of the city. He has been on the road, making his way back here, since that tragic night."}

With no Listener, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sacrament\"&gt;Black Sacrament&lt;/a&gt; will go unheard.

Until that happens, though, we must take to the streets. We must hear the pleas of the desperate and vengeful. The people of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; must not know, must never know, that their prayers to the Night Mother are going unheeded.\n24th of Morning Star\n4E 189 It is a new year, and two months since the Night Mother first arrived here at the &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Cheydinhal Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, and still the Unholy Matron has not seen fit to speak to any one of us.\nAnd so, &lt;a href=\"Rasha%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Rasha&lt;/a&gt; has decided to revive an ancient Dark Brotherhood tradition - the appointing of a &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20%28Dark%20Brotherhood%29\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;, a guardian whose sole duty is the safeguarding of the Night Mother's remains. The remaining members of the Black Hand will make their decision tomorrow.\n25th of Morning Star\n4E 189 I have been chosen. By some incomprehensible twist of fate, the Black Hand has named me the Night Mother's Keeper. In all honesty, I am both incredibly honored and deeply saddened. This means the end of my contracts. I'll be lucky to lift a &lt;a href=\"Swords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;blade&lt;/a&gt; again. Thankfully, Rasha has promised me one final contract before I accept my new duties.\n30th of Morning Star\n4E 189. The jester lies dead. My final contract has been completed. Oh, how he laughed and laughed. Until he didn't.\n3rd of First Seed\n4E 189 I have settled well into my new role as Keeper. It is my duty to not only keep the Night Mother's shrine clean, and the candles lit, but to tend to the body as well. The Night Mother's crypt was a consecrated place - shroud-kissed, absent of sunlight, and safe from the world above. Removed from there, the remains are subject to the filth and corruption of the living. The body is perfectly preserved, so the concern is not physical, but rather spiritual - the remains must be sanctified regularly, so that they may continue to serve as a conduit for the Night Mother's soul. Our Matron's eternal spirit may travel the Void freely, but it is through her own earthly remains that she communicates with the Listener.\nAnd so, I wash the corpse weekly with the requisite oils, recite the ancient incantations, and personally see to the extermination of any insects or rodents. If the Night Mother does not speak, it will be because she chooses not to - not because she is unable. This is my responsibility. This is my vow.\n12th of Mid Year\n4E 189 Months and months and months and no Listener. Why won't the Night Mother speak to me? I am worthy as Keeper, but not as Listener? I protect our Lady, keep her sanctified, but still she will not grace me with her voice?\n4th of Sun's Height\n4E 189 So long since I worked my blade. So long since I saved a soul. But I am now Keeper. No longer a taker.\nI think back fondly on my hours with the jester. His laughter, his screams, his pitiful cries. And then, as the end drew near, his laughter once more. Merry in death as well as life. I was honored to know him."}

How long since I was made Keeper? How long since I became the fool? Since I've been alone? Since Cheydinhal fell? Since they started pounding on the door, like so many hammered heartbeats?\nIt's dark in here, and quiet. Poor Cicero no longer hears the laughter, for he is the laughter. There is no Listener in Cheydinhal. No Listener in Cyrodiil. No Listener in me.\nWe must leave here. Before the Sanctuary falls. Before the Night Mother burns. Before the Dark Brotherhood withers. Before the laughter dies.\n29th of Sun's Dusk, 4E 200\nI took a stroll, and spied a maid, but Matron's duty stayed my blade. So busy now, I miss the thrill, if only I had time to kill."}

The enchantments on Cicero's Outfit are similar to the &lt;a href=\"Jester%27s%20Outfit\"&gt;Jester's Outfit&lt;/a&gt;, but they are stronger and the base value is higher.\nAcquisition.\nCicero is an essential character and cannot be killed or &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;ed. The outfit, under normal circumstances, is therefore unobtainable without &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;console commands&lt;/a&gt;. The exception to this is near the end of the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Cure%20for%20Madness\"&gt;The Cure for Madness&lt;/a&gt;\" in the Dark Brotherhood questline. The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; is given the choice to either kill him or let him live. The outfit can be obtained at this time by simply killing him, or by pickpocketing with the &lt;a href=\"Perfect%20Touch\"&gt;Perfect Touch&lt;/a&gt; perk. If he is left to live, Cicero again becomes an essential character.\nThere are methods to obtain Cicero's outfit without killing him:\nAfter the Dragonborn leaves the &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Dawnstar Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Forever\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood Forever&lt;/a&gt;,\" Cicero will meet\u00a0them again wearing his outfit and is available as a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Note: This method can be repeated infinitely as Cicero's outfit will respawn on him. It is advised not to shoot him repeatedly or he will turn hostile; one will need to wait until his health fully regenerates, or use an alternate method to paralyze him.\"\nCicero's Outfit.\nIt is possible to obtain unlimited amounts of Cicero's Outfit. If the Dragonborn chooses to kill Cicero, then they can loot the body. Once the clothes are obtained, then the Dragonborn can use &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Thrall\"&gt;Dead Thrall&lt;/a&gt; on Cicero to bring him back. Once the Dragonborn exits a map (e.g. leaving a house), it is possible that Cicero will be wearing the outfit. The next step is to kill him again, use dead thrall, and exit a map; then repeat. The Dragonborn can use this to sell for a rather large profit or for their own purposes. Disenchanting is not an option.\nJester's Outfit.\nThe armor set is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Jester%27s%20Outfit\"&gt;Jester's Outfit&lt;/a&gt; found in the Dawnstar Sanctuary. The enchantments on the Jester's Outfit are weaker and the value is less, yet it can be worn for aesthetic reasons. Neither Cicero's Outfit nor the Jester's Outfit provide any armor, but they have extremely beneficial bonuses for assassins."}

The Legion feared the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; and the Silver-Bloods were &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak\"&gt;Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; sympathizers, who wanted to exploit the violent criminals imprisoned in the mine and use them against &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Tamriel\"&gt;the Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Thonar was aware of the plot due to his own secret alliance with &lt;a href=\"Madanach\"&gt;Madanach&lt;/a&gt; and his Forsworn and sent &lt;a href=\"Weylin\"&gt;Weylin&lt;/a&gt;, a Forsworn undercover operative, to eliminate Margret, while having the Markarth &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;Hold Guard&lt;/a&gt;s then silence Weylin to cover up any fears of Forsworn presence in the hold capital.\nWhile investigating the Forsworn Conspiracy at the request of &lt;a href=\"Eltrys\"&gt;Eltrys&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn is either imprisoned here; framed for murdering several notable members of the Silver-Blood family, including Thonar's wife &lt;a href=\"Betrid%20Silver-Blood\"&gt;Betrid&lt;/a&gt; and two of their staff, &lt;a href=\"Nana%20Ildene\"&gt;Nana Ildene&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Donnel\"&gt;Donnel&lt;/a&gt;, who were actually Forsworn operatives; or infiltrates the mine intentionally, hoping to meet Madanach and disable Forsworn influence over Markarth.\nIf the Dragonborn returns to Markarth after they have completed the quests that occur at Cidhna Mine and have a bounty, choosing the \"go to jail\" option will transport them to Cidhna Mine. To leave the mine, activate one of the ore veins using a pickaxe, triggering an option to serve jail time.\nCombat.\nFinding a &lt;a href=\"shiv\"&gt;shiv&lt;/a&gt;, wielding a &lt;a href=\"Pickaxe%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, or using a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; to attack any of the inhabitants of the mine provokes everyone nearby to relentlessly strike back at the Dragonborn, with many using magic. &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneaking&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Invisibility effects&lt;/a&gt; allow for picking off the inhabitants more easily as the Dragonborn's lack of &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, accessories, and strong weapons leaves them vulnerable to multiple attacks. Another alternative solution\u00a0is if the Dragonborn is either a &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Werewolf&lt;/a&gt; or a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Lord\"&gt;Vampire Lord&lt;/a&gt;, they are able to transform in the mine which is useful for escaping, general combat or killing Madanach if needed."}

But where did the moon frown? The sky is empty of children, and the earth eats &lt;a href=\"strawberries\"&gt;strawberries&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, why do the worms taste of bitter-plumb?\nEveryone is bereft of spores. Or the spores have devoured us all and we are left with nothing. Or everything is inside us, though we find ourselves swimming in rock, where strange things remain, and known things fall outside of their own selves - let alone from each of us!\nWhy play the paintbrush against her? She always stands close to being far away. And what of the farm then? Shall it twinkle in the breeze of lyricism? How should I know?\nWhat I do know is this: the grass drinks flower dust like a glass bead swallowed tastes nothing like water. And furthermore, wherever one finds the absence of something, that something surely exists someplace else, or else how could it be absent. There is wisdom in this!\nYes, and everything has its place, and every place its thing belonging to it. It is the way of all things. Even those things misplaced know where they belong. They long to be. That is the whole point of belonging, is it not? And yet we are never so lonely as the stars, as when we find ourselves possessed. Of love? Of death? Of what then? Life?\nBut they call me Enemy, even as they exalt me. Yet even the wind is slave to the clouds... But the rain? It bounces against the sky like apples in a basket, and for what? What shall become of us when the pod pits die?\nI would like to think that the bleak summer does not herald the death of the rain. But who is to say one way or the other? If the butterflies make up the walls, how does one see inside a room at night? Perhaps the room is already inside us and we are the ones who need occupants, and our occupants are the ones needing the light.\nBut I digress.\nThe spoon that slays monsters is always the last to enter the mouth, and the first to leave. Nor do eyes in the back of one's head mean that one can walk backwards... do the knees bend that way? Do the shoes point heavenward? No, we are stuck falling forward until we smash against the door of eternity. That is the essence of life. To be devoured in our own banality, though we wish to be something more.\nI love this life, but I hate the aftertaste. Like waking from a dream with someone's fingers in your mouth. How did they get there? Whose hand do they belong to? Whose hand do any of us belong to, really?\nIt always comes back to belonging, does it not? It does. As the question knows the answer, the answer belongs to the question. And that is the whole point, I think: to know the question, and thus to belong to the answer.\nThat is why I must write in this book. Everyday. Sometimes twice. The others are jealous of the windflowers that bloom in these pages. They desire to swallow the ink through their nostrils, tasting the bitterness of all that life has in store for them... but it is my life that belongs to me. Even as my house belongs to the things inside it. And insides belong to outsides, and outsides are never quite as free to do as they think they are.\nAlways this. One thing after another, but not some things. Some things are better left where they think they are, not where they really are. Not all places are equal, nor all things belonging to the same spot. How could that be? No. Surely not.\nWhen my sun shines through the moon's teeth, then it will be time. But not until. Until then I shall continue to smash my head through windows so that I might see. Where I am. Where here is. Where I belong. And all things being just so, so I be just. And justice is important in this life, is it not? How else can a life be justified, but by this?\nThe sun is forever moving. I must get back to work. I am grateful I have this place to put my thoughts, lest they become lost and confused as I am (though I'll never let the others see that... they think I have everything in control).."}

He appears to be quite playful, for in addition to talking to his animals, he requests some &lt;a href=\"Thunderbug\"&gt;Thunderbug&lt;/a&gt; eggs because accosting them is tiresome.

Motivating tigers is hungry work.\"\nAt the start of the quest:\n\"Thank the moons! As I was just explaining, that thief nearly ran us over. You chased after him. Please, tell this fine keeper of the peace what you saw. I'm still sore from the last night I spent in the stocks!\"\nAfter telling &lt;a href=\"Tulira\"&gt;Tulira&lt;/a&gt; the truth:\n\"Well, that was surprising.

Shadowmere spawns from a pool outside the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, follows the Dragonborn when they &lt;a href=\"Fast%20Travel%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fast travel&lt;/a&gt;, and can provide aid during combat.\nInteractions.\nDuring \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Cure%20for%20Madness\"&gt;The Cure for Madness&lt;/a&gt;,\" Astrid wants the Dragonborn to follow &lt;a href=\"Cicero\"&gt;Cicero&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;'s Keeper, to the &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Dawnstar Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; as swiftly as possible. To that end, she gives them Shadowmere, whom she calls \"one of us.\" The horse's first appearance outside the Sanctuary is very dramatic, and clearly shows that Shadowmere is no common horse, as it appears out of dark water and smoke, and has glowing red eyes.\nIf the Dragonborn fast travels anywhere outside a city, Shadowmere will appear there. Fast traveling to a city causes Shadowmere to be found at that city's stables instead.\nShadowmere has much higher health than a regular horse and an extremely fast health regeneration, making him far less likely to die than normal horses. If enemies are nearby, Shadowmere will actively attack them. He deals very little damage, but can serve as a useful distraction while the Dragonborn attacks from afar.\nGender.\nAstrid calls Shadowmere a \"he,\" although Shadowmere is identified as a \"she\" by &lt;a href=\"Lucien%20Lachance\"&gt;Lucien Lachance&lt;/a&gt; in . Astrid is known to sometimes switch between calling Shadowmere a she and he, but never within the same conversation. The Spectral Assassin version of Lachance will also call it a he when Lachance sees the horse.\nExploit.\nShadowmere is commonly used for many exploits to raise combat skills because of his large amount of health. The player can either use magic or weapons on Shadowmere to raise that skill. The only problem is killing him. However, due to Shadowmere's massive health regeneration, killing him is unlikely unless one uses high-end smithed weapons or perked sneak attacks. If his health does get low, it is recommended to wait an hour and continue attacking."}

The singing remains, but the song is gone. No tune, no music, but whispers set to rhytm. Serve Her, be shadow, be whispers. Creeping, crawling, but I can't escape.

He created the &lt;a href=\"Labyrinthian\"&gt;Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, the mage sanctuary of &lt;a href=\"Eyevea\"&gt;Eyevea&lt;/a&gt;, and his personal compound of the &lt;a href=\"Fortress%20of%20Ice\"&gt;Fortress of Ice&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. Shalidor was said to have a vast knowledge of the workings of &lt;a href=\"Magicka\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt; that few could ever compare to.\nFeuds with the Dwemer.\nShalidor once fought the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Rourken%20Clan\"&gt;Rourken Clan&lt;/a&gt;. During their march to &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, the Rourken Clan clashed with Archmage Shalidor in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Rourken-Shalidor\"&gt;Battle of Rourken-Shalidor&lt;/a&gt;. The powerful Dwemeri artifact, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Breaker\"&gt;Spell Breaker&lt;/a&gt;, a shield that could reflect any oncoming spells, saw action in the battle.\nResearch.\nThe Archmage Shalidor was well known for his spell &lt;a href=\"Shalidor%27s%20Mirror\"&gt;Shalidor's Mirror&lt;/a&gt;, which was a ward capable of reflecting offensive spells back at the caster. It is speculated that Shalidor created the spell after his battle with the Rourken Clan, trying his best to emulate the effect of the Dwemer shield, Spell Breaker. Shalidor was also known to put a large amount of effort into researching the dragons that once roamed Skyrim. Shalidor also performed rituals that extended his life so he could continue his work.\nMost of the research and writings that Shalidor wrote while in Labyrinthian were lost to the ages, but some of what he wrote is still out there. During the Fourth Era, the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0attempted to seek out more of Shalidor's writings to expand &lt;a href=\"The%20Arcanaeum\"&gt;The Arcanaeum&lt;/a&gt;, improve the arcane skills of the members there and to help the college expand and improve as a whole.\nIt should be noted Shalidor loved his research more than his wife, &lt;a href=\"Ulfsild\"&gt;Ulfsild&lt;/a&gt;; as shown in one of Sheogorath's oblivion realms, his wife repeatedly questions him about his time and research and eventually leaves him due to \"no communication.\" \nBargain with Sheogorath.\nWhile working on Glamoril, Shalidor reached an impasse that even his own knowledge and power could not overcome. He decided to make a deal with the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, who gave Shalidor the &lt;a href=\"Folium%20Discognitum\"&gt;Folium Discognitum&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for Eyevea, Shalidor's own island sanctuary. Even though the Folium Discognitum contained great knowledge and power, Shalidor was not content with the bargain and believed Eyevea was stolen from him by Sheogorath.\nReturn during the Alliance War.\nShalidor placed powerful enchantments upon his final resting place that would allow him to return to Tamriel whenever his legacy is threatened. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; was a threat to all mages in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and as such, posed a threat to Shalidor's legacy. Shalidor intended to offer &lt;a href=\"Eyevea\"&gt;Eyevea&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; as a safe haven from the war, and required the assistancee of a Mages Guild &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Adept&lt;/a&gt; with bringing it back to &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;Shivering Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Sheogorath tasked Shalidor and the Adept with obtaining four cursed tomes, which &lt;a href=\"Valaste\"&gt;Valaste&lt;/a&gt;, the Mages Guild's Master of Incunabula had to translate, a feat that took a toll on her mental health. After obtaining and translating the tomes, Shalidor brought Eyevea back to Nirn, and confronted Sheogorath there alongside the Adept and Valaste. By then Valaste became fully insane and Shalidor realized the curse of the tomes was not meant to make them hard to decipher, and thus slow him and his allies down, but to drive Valaste mad. Sheogorath gave the Adept a choice between restoring Valaste's sanity and obtaining the Folium Discognitum for themselves, Shalidor urged the Adept to refuse the Folium Discognitum and save Valaste. Regardless of their choice, Sheogorath left Eyevea and the island became a sanctuary for mages from all over Tamriel under the control of the Mages Guild, and Shalidor was able to leave Tamriel.\nLegacy.\nShalidor was a prominent advocate in a movement to keep magic out of the hands of the common people and instead enact higher standards amongst mages. These beliefs are often credited with bringing forth the creation of magic academies such as the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. The Labyrinthian was known as the Archmage's testing ground and it still exists into the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;. While Shalidor was in Labyrinthian, he heavily studied magic and the arcane arts, researching, writing, and experimenting more than anyone could imagine possible. He is believed to have constructed the Labyrinthian by himself and use it to hold an artifact called &lt;a href=\"Glamoril\"&gt;Glamoril&lt;/a&gt;, the secret of life, which was said to be stolen from &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; himself. Some claimed that Shalidor had destroyed the infamous Crimson Book of Skulls, but it was later discovered that the book still existed. Shalidor is also said to have built the city of Winterhold with a whispered spell, though whether this is true is unknown. It is possible that some of his achievements have been hyperbolized."}

The Arcanaeum is tended by an old &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; named Urag gro-Shub. The Dragonborn has to ask Urag if he needs any special books to be found. Urag will talk about the Arch-Mage Shalidor and his understanding of magic. Urag will then ask the Dragonborn if they wish to find &lt;a href=\"Shalidor%27s%20Insights%20%28Book%29\"&gt;\"Shalidor's Insights\"&lt;/a&gt; for him.\nAre there any special books you're looking for? \nIn the chest located on the map is a copy of \"Shalidor's Insights\".

Wait 36 hours and ask Urag how the research is coming along, and if the Dragonborn waited long enough, he will say he has completed the translation, and gives them three Shalidor's Insights. These are scrolls which lower the cost and increase the duration of spells for 120 seconds. Uncommonly, the Dragonborn will get a random magic skill increase. This increase does not count as one of the five training points each level but it functions in exactly the same manner as it would a trainer."}

The entrance is located directly east of the &lt;a href=\"Bromjunaar%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Bromjunaar Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Traversing this maze results in a fight with a &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Kynval%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and a word for the &lt;a href=\"Dismay\"&gt;Dismay&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shout\"&gt;Dragon Shout&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nShalidor's Maze was constructed by &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shalidor\"&gt;Shalidor&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; in the ruins of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic city of &lt;a href=\"Bromjunaar\"&gt;Bromjunaar&lt;/a&gt; as a testing ground for new Archmages. The test consisted of navigating the ruins in order to reach the labyrinth and traversing the labyrinth itself, if the journey was survived.\nWalkthrough.\nJust inside the entrance, there is a charred corpse holding a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt; in one hand and a \"&lt;a href=\"Tattered%20Note%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Tattered Note&lt;/a&gt;\" in the other. Upon nearing the corpse, four staves rise out of slots in the ground. The note reads:\n\"Enter Twice - Exit Only Once.Alteration will lead you to Destruction.Only Illusion shows the way to Restoration.Conjure not, but be conjured instead.\"\nTake all four staves, walk straight forward. There is a sigil of &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt;. Use the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magelight\"&gt;Staff of Magelight&lt;/a&gt; or cast any projectile Alteration spell (&lt;a href=\"Magelight%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Magelight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paralyze&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) on the sigil to lower the gate. Inside the corridors are shutters that act as chests in this area, and allow the Dragonborn to see through the maze.\nUsing the shutters inside the maze as markers to tell what areas have been explored by opening and closing them is not necessary.\nAfter running through a few corridors, opening the shutters in the corners on the way, there will be a &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; sigil. Cast any projectile Destruction spell on it or use the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Firebolts\"&gt;Staff of Firebolts&lt;/a&gt; to open the trap door below to continue.\nAt the bottom of the trap door, a sigil of &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; is to the left. For now, it cannot be activated. Continue forward. A staircase will slide down like an elevator - taking it will result in placing the Dragonborn back outside near where the four staves appeared. Follow either side of the maze to get to the back. In the back there will be a dragon word wall for the shout &lt;a href=\"Dismay\"&gt;Dismay&lt;/a&gt;.\nTurn around and enter the back exit of the maze, to find the sigil for &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt;. Cast a projectile Illusion spell or use the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Staff of Fear&lt;/a&gt; to open this gate. Follow the corridors, opening the shutters in the corners, until the sigil of Restoration is reached. Cast a projectile Restoration spell (&lt;a href=\"Healing%20Hands%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Healing Hands&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Heal%20Other\"&gt;Heal Other&lt;/a&gt; does not count) or use the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Repulsion\"&gt;Staff of Repulsion&lt;/a&gt; to open the trap door.\nHere there is a portal to the \"Trials of Conjuration\" if all of the sigils in the maze have been activated. A leveled &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; is waiting on the other side and attacks the Dragonborn on sight. When\u00a0attacked, the two are teleported back to where the staves were, where the Dragonborn is attacked by the Dremora and leveled &lt;a href=\"Atronach\"&gt;Atronach&lt;/a&gt;s. After defeating them, the &lt;a href=\"Diadem%20of%20the%20Savant\"&gt;Diadem of the Savant&lt;/a&gt; may be taken from the Dremora's corpse."}

Like its undead brethren, the shambles is fully resistant to &lt;a href=\"Diseases%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;paralysis&lt;/a&gt;; additionally, they possess a unique resistance to all frost magic.\nFurthermore, upon death, Shambles will explode in a spectacular shower of frost. This ability seems to have been added by its creator as an interesting last-ditch defense mechanism. Players intending to combat these undead creatures should be certain to bring &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Frost%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Resist Frost&lt;/a&gt; potions or destroy them at range.\n&lt;a href=\"Earil\"&gt;Earil&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Crucible\"&gt;Crucible&lt;/a&gt; will sell the spells for summoning both the decrepit and replete versions of shambles.\nTrivia.\nThere is a clutter item called a Shambles Skull which cannot be looted from shambles, but can be found lying around in various places such as &lt;a href=\"Relmyna%20Verenim\"&gt;Relmyna Verenim&lt;/a&gt;'s quarters in &lt;a href=\"Xaselm\"&gt;Xaselm&lt;/a&gt;.

Spirit revenants like the &lt;a href=\"ancestor%20ghost\"&gt;ancestor ghost&lt;/a&gt;, wraith, and &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spectre\"&gt;dwarven ghost&lt;/a&gt;, can only be harmed by weapons that are enchanted or made of refined substances such as silver. Ancestor ghosts, the most common spirit revenant, are harmless, apart from the minor curses they lay upon their victims. Wraiths are similar to ghosts, but they are capable of inflicting wounds to the careless explorer. &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spectre\"&gt;ghosts&lt;/a&gt; are more dangerous still, but they generally appear only in &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dwarven ruins&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlesh revenants, or '&lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s' as they are often called in the West, are known as '&lt;a href=\"Bonewalker%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;bonewalkers&lt;/a&gt;' in Morrowind. Magic preserves the bonewalker's fleshy remains along with the bones and spirit. Bonewalkers are readily identified by the sharp protuberances of bone and metal employed in the rituals that bind them to this plane. All bonewalkers are malevolent and dangerous, but the &lt;a href=\"greater%20bonewalker\"&gt;greater bonewalker&lt;/a&gt;s are far worse than the more common bonewalkers. Thankfully, normal weapons harm bonewalkers.\nIt is difficult to generalize about fleshless revenants, or &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt;. The agility and fighting ability of the animated remains may depend on the abilities of the revenant's former life, and may therefore be weak or strong, or more or less capable with weapons and shields. Fortunately, enchanted weapons are not needed to destroy skeletons. An exception is the &lt;a href=\"Bonelord%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;bonelord&lt;/a&gt;, a peculiar form of revenant that seems to derive its powers more from its spirit energies than from the substance of its skeletal remains. Bonelords are very powerful, and very dangerous. &lt;a href=\"Immune%20to%20Normal%20Weapons\"&gt;Normal weapons do not affect&lt;/a&gt; them.\n&lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vampires&lt;/a&gt; were believed to be extinct in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; for centuries. &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; culture has a special hatred for vampires, and in earlier times the &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ordinators&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armigers%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Buoyant Armigers&lt;/a&gt; hunted them to extinction. In recent years, however, vampires have either begun to sneak into Morrowind, or long-dormant ones have been awakened. Vampires vary in their substance and power according to their age and accumulated lore, but even the weakest vampire is immeasurably stronger than most other undead. Note: &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Vampire\"&gt;Ash vampires&lt;/a&gt; are not vampires, and are not undead. Ash vampires are extremely dangerous. While their spirit and substance may indeed be preserved by some magical process, the holy warriors of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; report that spell effects known to affect the undead have no effect on ash vampires."}

The Worm Cult have been creating an army of Daedra using portals they have opened in the ruins, and their leader &lt;a href=\"Thallik%20Wormfather\"&gt;Thallik Wormfather&lt;/a&gt; has stolen &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;'s legendary weapon &lt;a href=\"Wuuthrad%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wuuthrad&lt;/a&gt;. He asks you to close the portals. \nAfter speaking with the king, speak with &lt;a href=\"Valdur\"&gt;Valdur&lt;/a&gt;. He will tell you that there four portals in the ruins, but that they are well guarded. You can persuade him to raise one of the five hundred companions to aid you. You can choose between a warrior, a firemage and a healer, so choose wisely. Either way, head northwest and into the ruins. The portals are in the North, East, South and West of the area, and each will be guarded by a deadra and one or multiple worm cultists. You can do them in any order you wish. In this area, you should also find &lt;a href=\"Walks-in-Ash\"&gt;Walks-in-Ash&lt;/a&gt;, who will give the quest &lt;a href=\"Soldier%20Down\"&gt;Soldier Down&lt;/a&gt;. That quest takes place in the same area as this one, so it is efficient to do both simultaneously.\nAfter you have closed all the portals, Valdur will appear and tell you that they have found Thallik Wormfather. He will tell you to head to the central ruins. There, you will see Thallik escape through a portal to &lt;a href=\"Arcwind%20Point%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Arcwind Point&lt;/a&gt;. Give chase through the portal, then go look for &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Hrosta\"&gt;Captain Hrosta&lt;/a&gt;. She should be in the big dragon mound on the other side of the area. Just follow the path, but beware the many daedra along the way. Once you have reached the captain, speak with her and she will tell you that Wormfather has gone into the ruins, but that the door is sealed by a necromantic ritual. A human sacrifice is necessary to open it. \nYou have two options here: either let Hrosta sacrifice herself or trick a cultist into sacrificing himself. If you let Hrosta be the sacrifice, . If you choose to sacrifice a cultist, head north. You should find a man named &lt;a href=\"Lesuin\"&gt;Lesuin&lt;/a&gt; trapped in a cage. He is a reachman, from one of the tribes that attacked the Rift, but he crossed them by refusing to sacrifice a child. Bring him back to the mound. At this point, you can still change your mind on who to sacrifice. If you go through with sacrificing Lesuin, . Should you change your mind and sacrifice Hrosta, she will touch the crystal and die, and Lesuin will run away. \nEnter the ruins and search for Thallik. Once you are in the ruins, &lt;a href=\"Hakra\"&gt;Hakra&lt;/a&gt; and Valdur will appear to support you. Head through the hallway and into &lt;a href=\"Sinmur\"&gt;Sinmur&lt;/a&gt;'s Tomb. Here, you should find Thallik. Kill him, and his ghost will appear. He will revive two draugr for you to fight, and shatter Wuuthrad to give his spirit to Sinmur. After killing the draugr, speak with Hakra. She will tell you to grab the haft of Wuuthrad and get out of there. Once you have taken the haft, a portal will appear back to Honrich Tower.\nHead back through the portal and speak with king Jorunn to finish the quest."}

The modern races of elves all came from the aldmer as they spread from &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the common ancestor of all mer on Tamriel, the term \"Aldmeri\" is sometimes used to refer to mer as a whole.\nPhysical appearance.\nAs far as anyone can determine, the Aldmer vanished as a distinct race sometime during the middle &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; consider themselves the most \"pure\" descendants of their progenitor race, and attempt to maintain that purity through careful breeding and eugenics.\nHistory.\nThe Aldmer came from one of the two direct descendants of the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;, the other being the proto-race of man. Some sources claim that the Aldmer, rather than the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ehlnofey\"&gt;Old Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt; from whom they are descended, fought against &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; in the Ehlnofey Wars.\nOriginally, the Aldmer were concentrated on the mythic continent of &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt;, coming to Tamriel in the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;. Initially, most of the Aldmer remained on the Summerset Isles, leaving the rest of Tamriel to the ancestors of &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; and potentially &lt;a href=\"Orcs\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;. It is believed by some scholars that the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; diverged from the Aldmer before this time.\nOther groups of Aldmer began to explore the continent and settle the coasts of Tamriel, becoming the various races of mer that are seen throughout most of Tamriel's history, the Altmer, &lt;a href=\"Ayleids\"&gt;Ayleids&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elf\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Direnni\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt; clan that would ultimately become the &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nMost information known about Aldmeri culture comes from excavated ruins on the Summerset Isles, and the artwork of private Altmeri collectors. Aldmeri society was primarily agricultural, with an egalitarian government.\nThe Aldmer were also capable of impressive feats of engineering, as the Aldmer built many of &lt;a href=\"the%20Towers\"&gt;the Towers&lt;/a&gt; that can be seen across Tamriel, in imitation of the &lt;a href=\"Adamantine%20Tower\"&gt;Adamantine Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly Aldmer engaged in a form of ancestor worship, which over time began to focus more specifically on the most powerful of their ancestors, especially &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Syrabane\"&gt;Syrabane&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Phynaster\"&gt;Phynaster&lt;/a&gt;. It was during this time that various religious groups schismed from the Aldmer, such as the Daedra-worshipping &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, the remaining group developed into what is known as the Altmeri pantheon of the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;."}

As they had done many times before, they swore that with the combined forces of the three races, they shall prevent the disaster that was to come.\nConvinced that the younger, less sophisticated &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Online%29\"&gt;races&lt;/a&gt; have dominated &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; too long, the Dominion seeks to right the course of history. The cultured and typically reclusive &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; have emerged from their ancestral home of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; alongside the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; and crafty &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; to usher in a new era of peace and law.\nThe Dominion was formed\u00a0in an attempt to\u00a0take control of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; and restore &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; rule to Tamriel. It is said that the three allied races were the most intelligent, patient and rational in all of Tamriel. Members of the Aldmeri Dominion believe that the short-lived and young races of &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt; are unfit to rule, and that this role is meant by &lt;a href=\"the%20Divines\"&gt;the Divines&lt;/a&gt; to be filled by the Aldmeri Dominion itself.\nThe Aldmeri Dominion stretches over the &lt;a href=\"provinces\"&gt;provinces&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0of the\u00a0Summerset Isles, Valenwood and Elsweyr. Its capital is\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;, hidden deep within the forests of the Bosmeri Valenwood. The faction is led by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeadership.\nThe Aldmeri Dominion is led by the young &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; and governed by the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;, a collection of Altmeri &lt;a href=\"Canonreeve\"&gt;Canonreeve&lt;/a&gt;s, Bosmeri &lt;a href=\"Treethane\"&gt;Treethane&lt;/a&gt;s and Khajiit Chieftains. The Thalmor was devised by Ayrenn as a means of creating equal representation for the Aldmeri Dominion's three races. Ayrenn inherited the throne when the previous Altmer ruler, her father &lt;a href=\"King%20Hidellith\"&gt;King Hidellith&lt;/a&gt;, passed away. She was, no doubt, one of the youngest leaders in the history of\u00a0Mer. She was a mere 25 years old when she became Queen (7th of Frostfall, 2E 580). Despite her youth, Queen Ayrenn was said to have virtues rare among her kind. She was an honorable, intelligent, and stubborn leader. Before she took the role of a queen, she was said to have been an adventurer and had set foot in every province of Tamriel.\nThe King &lt;a href=\"Aeradan\"&gt;Aeradan&lt;/a&gt; is the political leader of the Bosmer people, he along with &lt;a href=\"The%20Silvenar\"&gt;The Silvenar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Lady\"&gt;The Green Lady&lt;/a&gt; assist Queen Ayrenn in ruling &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; for the Dominion. Likewise the &lt;a href=\"Mane\"&gt;Mane&lt;/a&gt; is the ruler of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; and rules it in the name of the Dominion.\nMembers.\n&lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe High Elves, or Altmer, arrived in Tamriel thousands of years ago from\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Old Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt;. They see themselves as the ruling race of Tamriel. They are a highly cultured people, known for their breathtaking architecture and massive libraries of histories and creative works. They tend to be isolationists, largely remaining on Summerset Isle, and only emerging when they perceive a great threat to their homeland. They are powerful mages and warriors, and the de facto leaders of the Aldmeri Dominion.\nThe Aldmeri Dominion has adopted as its symbol the eagle sigil of the High Elves of Summerset. For the Altmer, the high-soaring eagle represents their ancestors the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;, who came from the heavens and were trapped in physical form by the creation of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Wood Elves, or Bosmer, are mischievous, curious and nimble. Because their homeland of Valenwood is often attacked by the Colovian Imperials, Wood Elves are experts at the art of defense. They are also gifted archers, perhaps the best in all of Tamriel.\nThe Bosmeri symbol represents the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt; the Forest Deity.\n&lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe population of the proud feline Khajiit has dwindled in recent years following a devastating outbreak of &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt;. They owe a great debt to Ayrenn, Queen of the High Elves, for her help in restoring order from the chaos that followed the plague. They have a wry wit and a hedonistic outlook, but they are fearsome on the field of battle. They are the strong arm of the Aldmeri Dominion.\nThe Khajiit\u00a0symbol depicts Nirn's\u00a0two moons\u2014&lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and the cat-folks' claws.\nQuests.\nThe questline of the Aldmeri Dominion is experienced in the zone story quests of each zone within Aldmeri Dominion territory. In chonological order, the zones of the Dominion storyline are &lt;a href=\"Khenarthi%27s%20Roost\"&gt;Khenarthi's Roost&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greenshade\"&gt;Greenshade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malabal%20Tor\"&gt;Malabal Tor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20March\"&gt;Reaper's March&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"}

The Dominion's power then expanded throughout portions of the Empire under the guise of enforcing the Concordat, particularly the ban on &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; worship in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFormation and expansion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the Thalmor rose to prominence as a key factor in closing many &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gates\"&gt;Oblivion Gates&lt;/a&gt; and held off the Daedra until the &lt;a href=\"Champion%20of%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Champion of Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and Martin Septim defeated Mehrunes Dagon in the Battle of the Imperial City.

Reeling from this cultural shock, the Altmer gave power to the Thalmor, who claimed to have ended the threat of the Oblivion Crisis altogether. \nThe Thalmor are allege to have assassinated &lt;a href=\"Ocato\"&gt;Ocato&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%2010\"&gt;4E 10&lt;/a&gt;, then acting as &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt; following the end of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. This event caused the Third Empire, to descend into a civil war known as the &lt;a href=\"Stormcrown%20Interregnum\"&gt;Stormcrown Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, the Thalmor overthrew the monarchy of Summerset and purged the Summerset Isles of the members of all those of non-&lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; descent.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%2029\"&gt;4E 29&lt;/a&gt;, sympathizers of the Thalmor in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; overthrew the Imperial administration of the province, and joined Valenwood with the Summerset Isles to form the Third Aldmeri Dominion. Following this, the Dominion severed all contact with the Empire. Following the return of the moons after the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Nights\"&gt;Void Nights&lt;/a&gt;, the Thalmor claimed they restored them to the sky. gaining the favor of the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;. Following a coup in &lt;a href=\"4E%20115\"&gt;4E 115&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20Confederacy\"&gt;Elsweyr Confederacy&lt;/a&gt; was formally dissolved, and the kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pelletine\"&gt;Pelletine&lt;/a&gt; became client states of the Third Aldmeri Dominion.\nAround this time, the Dominion is noted to have begun purges of those with mixed racial makeup in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, as well as infiltrating areas of Cyrodiil and possibly funding rebellions there.\nFinally, the Dominion felt confident enough of its own power to challenge the Third Empire, which was still the dominant force in Tamriel at the time. The Dominion's military was prepared and a plan was put into motion to bring war to Cyrodiil, which had been untouched by foreign invaders since before the conquests of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;.\nGreat War.\nPrior to the beginning of the Great War, the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt; were charged with investigating Dominion activity. However, the Dominion hunted down and eliminated the agents of the Blades who were stationed in Valenwood, Elsweyr and &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 4E 171, the Dominion dispatched an ambassador to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; with an ultimatum and a \"gift.\" Among other things, these included that Emperor &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt; pay tributes to the Dominion, disband the Blades, outlaw the worship of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, and cede large portions of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; to the Dominion. The Emperor rejected the ultimatum, and the ambassador presented the Dominion's gift: hundreds of heads that had come from the executed Blades who were stationed in the Dominion lands.\nFollowing the Imperial rejection of the Dominion's ultimatum, Dominion military forces led by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Naarifin\"&gt;Lord Naarifin&lt;/a&gt;, invaded &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; through its border with &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. Naarifin and his Aldmeri army invaded southeastern Cyrodiil, capturing &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;, Bravil and much of southern Cyrodiil. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Arannelya\"&gt;Lady Arannelya&lt;/a&gt; led an army in the invasion of Hammerfell via southern Cyrodiil from Valenwood, by-passed the Imperial cities of &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. Reinforced by Aldmeri forces from the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; who landed on the coastline of Hammerfell, Arannelya's forces defeated the weak Redguard resistance and forced the Imperial Legion to retreat across the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the Empire's forces reeling, the Dominion turned its attention to the Imperial City. Knowing he could not win the battle outright, Titus instead ordered a full retreat north before the city could be completely surrounded, sacrificing the 8th Legion as a rearguard to cover this retreat. The city was then sacked, and Dominion forces wreaked incredible atrocities on the citizens, beginning the process of completing a prophecy known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Culling\"&gt;The Culling&lt;/a&gt;.\nBelieving themselves victorious, the Thalmor contacted Mede, offering terms of surrender, which Mede used as a diversion while he marshaled his reinforcements for a counterattack. Using the Dominion's tactics against them, Mede's forces attacked and drove back the occupying Aldmeri forces in Cyrodiil, surrounding the Imperial City within five days in the Battle of the Red Ring. When the city was besieged, Dominion forces attempted to withdraw, but were rebuffed by the Legions surrounding the city led by General Jonna. The entire Dominion force within Cyrodiil was then destroyed.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; ends in 4E 175 with the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, a treaty largely similar in substance to the terms initially rejected by Titus in 4E 171, including ceding Hammerfell and banning Talos worship.\nWar with Hammerfell.\nFollowing the signing of the White-Gold Concordat, the Dominion continued a war with Hammerfell, opposed by the now united Crowns and Forebears and a contingent of \"invalids\" formally discharged from the Imperial Army. This eventually forces the Dominion from Hammerfell, leading to the Second Treaty of &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt; being signed in 4E 180, ending the war.\nSkyrim Civil War.\nThe Dominion takes advantage of the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt; and pressures the Empire to enforce the ban on &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; worship stipulated by the White-Gold Concordat by punishing &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; and his followers. This eventually resulted in a civil war, which the Dominion wishes to draw out for as long as possible. This mostly entails a hands-off policy, although the Dominion was considering action to save Ulfric in order to prolong the war.\nThe Dominion maintain an &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Embassy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;embassy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and have been known to secretly capture and imprison any Nords who question their doctrines or beliefs. Their &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Justiciar\"&gt;Justiciars&lt;/a&gt; were sent to Skyrim to enforce the White-Gold Concordat. That position of enforcing the Concordat is used elsewhere to justify a Thalmor presence in negotiations between the Empire and the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;. Secretly, they have been instigating conflict between the Empire and the rebel &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;, directly interfering only in certain instances to keep the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; going.\nGovernment and Politics.\nThe Thalmor, as of the Fourth Era, is the governing council of the Third\u00a0Aldmeri Dominion. The Thalmor are &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; supremacists who seek to end &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Tamriel\"&gt;the Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the dominance of man, imposing a new &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;. They also claim that they were the ones who ended the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, using that as a basis for their authority.\u00a0\n'Thalmor' was the name of the provisional government set up by the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; during the Aldmeri Dominion. They are agents of the Aldmeri Dominion who investigate and stop any worship of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. It is commonly believed that the Thalmor would have destroyed the Empire of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; if not for the White-Gold Concordat, which included the removal of Talos from the Pantheon of Gods. \nThe Thalmor claim to be the saviors of &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. The Thalmor claim they closed the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Gates of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; in the Elven lands much like the &lt;a href=\"Champion%20of%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Champion of Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; did at &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;. It was ultimately the sacrifice of &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt; that ended the Oblivion Crisis completely. \nReligion.\nThe Altmeri Religion forms the basis for most of the other religious practices on the continent, primarily due to its widespread acceptance prior to the advent of human civilization. It is generally assumed that the Altmer pantheon derives directly from the original gods of the Aldmer, and was nearly identical to that of the Ayleid that ruled central Tamriel before the Alessian revolt.\nThe Altmer pantheon consists of eight of the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; that originally cooperated to form Nirn, the mortal plane. They primarily worship those Aedra which removed themselves from the creation process in time to save their divinity, with a few notable exceptions. As with nearly all Tamrielic religions, they revere &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, whom they call &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;, as their chief deity, at least in principle. However, Akatosh, along with the Altmer deities &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, were part of the creation process until its end, and so were severely weakened from their original form. In practice, the Altmer followed the teachings of &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;, the champion deity of the elves, who was still able to physically walk the face of Tamriel during the Mythic Era. Other key divines in their pantheon include Magnus, the source of magic on Tamriel, and Phynaster, the patron god of the Summerset Isle, whom the Altmer claim taught them to live much longer lives (by taking shorter strides).\nAlthough they do not revere him as a god, in fact quite the opposite, the Altmer do acknowledge the divinity of &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, the patron god of man. Much of the early Altmer history involves conflicts between Trinimac and his elves, and Lorkhan and his humans. The Altmer cast Lorkhan as a treacherous, shifty character who tricked the other Aedra into carrying out his plan for creation. As the elves believe themselves to be direct descendants from Akatosh, they blame Lorkhan for the loss of their divinity. (This is the key difference between human and mer theology: humans consider themselves \"creations\" of the gods, not \"descendants\" of the gods.) Unfortunately for the Altmer, Trinimac disappeared near the end of the Mythic Era; according to legend, he was eaten by the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; and reformed into &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;. The start of the First Era marked the beginning of a sharp decline in Altmer cultural and religious dominance across Tamriel.\nThe Dominion consider the worship of Talos a heresy and as a part of the White-Gold Concordat, they gained power to stamp out and persecute those who worship Talos. Their hatred of Talos is most likely rooted in the fact that the ascent of a man to godhood is in conflict with their notions of the supremacy of mer over man. Also, Talos is integral to the culture and religion of the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;. He was a man, born Hjalti Early-Beard, a &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; who was predicted by the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; to defeat the elves and unite Tamriel under the rule of men. The Thalmor thus knew that if the Empire was forced to ban the worship of Talos, many Nords would turn on the Empire. This caused the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20Rebellion\"&gt;Stormcloak Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0which served as a distraction from the Thalmor plans to re-ignite the hostilities of the Great War.\nSociety and culture.\nThe Altmer are one of the oldest races on Tamriel, one of the earliest descendants of the original mer race of &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;, and from there, through the Ehlnofey to the divine et'Ada themselves. As a race, they are extremely proud of their Aldmeri heritage, and make a concerted effort to maintain their genetic lineage. Their name translates from the Aldmeri language as High Ones or Cultured Ones, a name which is often interpreted to mean \"tall,\" or more often, \"snobbish.\" For their part, the Altmer argue that they are the first true culture on Tamriel, and still the most civilized race, an argument that even human scholars find difficult to refute.\nThe Altmer primarily live in the province of &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset Isle&lt;/a&gt;, a large island off the southwest coast of Tamriel, which shares a border with &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. According to their histories, their Aldmeri ancestors arrived on Summerset Isle after fleeing the catastrophic sinking of their original home continent, Aldmeris. From here, splinter groups of Aldmer spread throughout Tamriel, but the Altmer remained on the Isles, acting as the nominal head of the empire of meri nations on Tamriel. For most of the Mythic Era, the other races of elves on Tamriel acknowledged the Altmeri king as their own ruler, a practice which persisted until the founding of the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; in Valenwood, which marked the start of the First Era, and the beginning of the decline of Altmer-dominated Tamriel. Their influence is still felt across the continent, however, as their culture forms the basis for the religion, language, and even architecture of the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodil\"&gt;Cyrodil&lt;/a&gt;ic Empire.\nAny opposition to Thalmor rule is harshly punished. In 4E 42, Thalmor agents attacked Altmer dissidents who had fled to &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; in an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Green%20Fire\"&gt;Night of Green Fire&lt;/a&gt;, due to the magical attacks employed. By the time Imperial legion forces arrived, the refugee district of the city had been destroyed, and the dissidents were all killed.\nInteractions.\nThe Thalmor agents are active throughout Skyrim and can be encountered in several ways. Initially, the Thalmor are not hostile to the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; and will only attack when provoked. However, provocation includes the persistent questioning of the Aldmeri policy outlawing Talos worship or outright admission of the worship of Talos.\nThalmor patrols can be encountered along the major roadways and usually consist of one &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Justiciar\"&gt;Thalmor Justiciar&lt;/a&gt; and three bodyguards.\nThe Thalmor are still in operation and in charge of &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Keep\"&gt;Northwatch Keep&lt;/a&gt;. An advisor named &lt;a href=\"Ancano%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ancano&lt;/a&gt; was sent to the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; to oversee its studies. During his stay, Ancano attempts to absorb the power of the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, killing the &lt;a href=\"Savos%20Aren\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mirabelle%20Ervine\"&gt;Master Wizard&lt;/a&gt;, as well as\u00a0attacking &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Anomaly\"&gt;Magic Anomalies&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in the process. The Dragonborn, armed with the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, must end the endeavor.\nIn the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Diplomatic%20Immunity\"&gt;Diplomatic Immunity&lt;/a&gt;,\" the Dragonborn must break into the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Embassy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor Embassy&lt;/a&gt; during a party and retrieve information on the Dragons, and indirectly, &lt;a href=\"Esbern%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Esbern&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Delphine%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delphine&lt;/a&gt; and a Wood Elf\u00a0named &lt;a href=\"Malborn\"&gt;Malborn&lt;/a&gt;, the\u00a0Dragonborn obtains dossiers on the remaining &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, in which is implied a deeper, sinister motive for their presence in Skyrim. While the Thalmor\u00a0don't know about the reasons of the Dragons' return, they do know about Esbern, who does. After freeing a &lt;a href=\"Etienne%20Rarnis\"&gt;tortured prisoner&lt;/a&gt; and saving Malborn from the Thalmor, the\u00a0Dragonborn can escape and search for Esbern in &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is a quest given to\u00a0the Dragonborn\u00a0by &lt;a href=\"Ondolemar\"&gt;Ondolemar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Understone%20Keep%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Understone Keep&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;, where he asks\u00a0them to find evidence of Talos worship in &lt;a href=\"Ogmund%27s%20House\"&gt;Ogmund's House&lt;/a&gt;."}

They are presented here in terms comprehensible even by those of lesser intellectual attainment.\nONE: Foraging is Mandatory, but Looting is Forbidden\nWhile it is true that regions brought under the protection of the Aldmeri Dominion are required to pay indemnity-in-kind to support Dominion forces, this indemnity is to be collected with a strict adherence to the Rule of Fifths: one-fifth of all tangible goods and currency in a Dominion-protected region belong to the Dominion. Personal looting is forbidden.\nTWO: Pay for What You Take\nPersonal goods acquired by troops in an occupied region are to be paid for at the appropriate market rate. For this purpose all troops are supplied with a liberal quantity of Dominion Scrip, paper currency which the locals in an occupied region will be able to redeem after hostilities cease.\nNOTE: Troops are not to accept Dominion Scrip as payment for goods and services.\nTHREE: Do Not Fraternize with the Locals.\nThe locals in occupied regions often display vulgar behavior, subscribe to improper belief systems, and foment inappropriate ideas. Sometimes they even suffer a false sense of grievance against the Dominion which may manifest itself in dangerous misbehavior. Be a \"Safe Soldier,\" and fraternize only with those certified entertainers who have been admitted into the Recreation Compound.\nFOUR: Maintain Uniform Standards of Appearances\nDo not fall prey to the temptation to adopt local attire, no matter comfortable or festive. Maintain that superior reserve that reflects true Aldmeri Propriety.\nFIVE: Tolerate No Disrespect.\nThe forces of the Dominion Military are the physical incarnation of the Glory of the Aldmeri Peoples, and as such must be respected by members of the tertiary races. Failure to show proper deference to Dominion personnel or the Eagle Banner is to be immediately punished at the appropriate level of severity (as deliniated in Article 317, Deference and Decorum).\nIf you have questions about any of the above, consult your superior officer, or apply to your unit ceremoniarch for the course in Advanced Aldmeri Propriety.\nIn the Queen's Name, \nLegate Calevarnel"}

Very little is known of the alleged &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; homeland, and it is sometimes considered to be merely a myth. Its location, environment, politics, religion, and even its current existence are matters of conjecture. Translations from the tapestries and texts in the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Summerset\"&gt;Isle of Summerset&lt;/a&gt; have yielded only the barest sketches of a beautiful, but very strange, land. Depictions of Aldmeris are devoid of any representations of life aside from the Aldmer themselves. It appears always as an endless city, built upon itself over and over again, until nothing from nature remains. The highest towers are reserved for interring the dead, a tradition continued on by the Crystal Tower itself. It is believed that the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; may have evacuated Aldmeris to escape destruction and sailed to Tamriel.\nHistory.\nFew records exist of events relating to Aldmeris. One account tells of the Aldmer Foresailor &lt;a href=\"High%20Lord%20Torinaan\"&gt;High Lord Torinaan&lt;/a&gt;, who left the shores of his home Aldmeris in order to escape an unspecified crisis described as \"doom oblivious\" and landed in &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;, swearing an oath to lay claim to the new-found area and never depart from it. Another fleet of Aldmer settled on the continent south of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, known as &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt;, though this land was said to have been \"low, marshy, and insect-infested\" as compared to Summerset. The Aldmer who settled Summerset became known as the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, and those that settled Pyandonea became the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown if any people remained on Aldmeris after the Aldmeri colonization of foreign lands.\nWhat has happened in Aldmeris since the elves who settled in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; left is perhaps the oldest of all mysteries. For countless centuries, adventurers have sought Lost Aldmeris, only to return disappointed, if they return at all. Some say that Aldmeris was sunk into the sea by the angry gods of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;. Others claim that the elven homeland has left &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; and will only return when the races of &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; are united as one. Legends say that there are still elves inhabiting the area, not wishing to leave.\nOut of game explanation.\nAn alternate theory is presented by a work of &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Kirkbride\"&gt;Michael Kirkbride&lt;/a&gt;, in which the &lt;a href=\"Moth%20Priest\"&gt;Moth Priest&lt;/a&gt;s state that Aldmeris never existed as an actual homeland, but was a collection of \"memories\" left over from the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Age\"&gt;Mythic Age&lt;/a&gt;. The priests go on to say that all mortal life actually began on Tamriel."}

Worshipped as a god-king by the ancient &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt;, Alduin is considered the wellspring of the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20pantheon\"&gt;Nordic pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the harbinger of the apocalypse, and the Nordic god of time, and is believed to have a pivotal role in the reshaping of the world.\nHistory.\n\"And the Scrolls have foretold of black wings in the cold, That when brothers wage war come unfurled! Alduin, Bane of Kings, ancient shadow unbound, With a hunger to swallow the world!\" \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Song%20of%20the%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Song of the Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;\nDuring the early &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; people worshiped numerous animal totems which would become the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20pantheon\"&gt;Nordic pantheon&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;hawk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orkey\"&gt;snake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;moth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jhunal\"&gt;owl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stuhn\"&gt;whale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tsun\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dragons\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;\u2014as the avatars of the gods. The Dragon was considered the most important out of all the animals. Therefore, at the dragons' approval, the people of &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; came to deify the dragons, worshipping them as god-kings, through this establishing the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt; as the dominant belief system of ancient &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nordic&lt;/a&gt; culture.\nThroughout the Merethic Era, Alduin stood as the leader of the dragons and the Dragon Cult, which ruled over Atmora and later over Skyrim. Terms between dragons and men were peaceful in Atmora, thanks to the benevolent rule of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests\"&gt;Dragon Priests&lt;/a&gt;. However, when the Dragon Cult arrived on &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragon Priests became cruel towards the populace, and men were increasingly subjugated. Their attempts of resistance against the Dragon Priests led to brutal retaliations by the dragons, which eventually brought about the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlduin's chief lieutenant during this period was &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt;, his younger sibling, who was said to have committed unspeakable atrocities against mankind. However, Paarthurnax and a few other dragons turned against Alduin, possibly at the behest of the goddess &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt;, and taught humans how to use the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;; granting the most courageous among them the chance to rebel against their dragon overlords. The ensuing conflict between the dragons and the ancient &lt;a href=\"Tongue\"&gt;Tongue&lt;/a&gt;s became the legendary &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt;. At its height, Alduin was led to the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt; where he battled three Nordic heroes, &lt;a href=\"Felldir%20the%20Old\"&gt;Felldir the Old&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hakon%20One-Eye\"&gt;Hakon One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gormlaith%20Golden-Hilt\"&gt;Gormlaith Golden-Hilt&lt;/a&gt;, the first Tongues and leaders of the rebellion against Alduin. They created a unique &lt;a href=\"Shout\"&gt;Shout&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Dragonrend\"&gt;Dragonrend&lt;/a&gt; through which they managed to cripple Alduin, and then used an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Dragon%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt; to send him forward in time.\nBy &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, worship of Alduin was already outlawed for centuries, Alduin had no admitted worshippers, and the Nords of Skyrim were apparently fearful of worshipping Alduin. However, some Nords did pray to him, hoping that their prayers will keep him at bay.\nProphecy.\nA &lt;a href=\"Prophecy%20of%20the%20Dragonborn\"&gt;prophecy&lt;/a&gt; foretelling of Alduin's inevitable return to &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; is inscribed unto &lt;a href=\"Alduin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Alduin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;, located at &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt;, which is a wonder of the ancient world built in the First Era by the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt;; and the existence of which is recounted in the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20the%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Book of the Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; and possibly on an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt;. It warns that the World Eater will eventually return after various tumultuous events have occurred in world history, retelling the events that have led up to this point, and claiming that the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; will come forth at that time to stand against Alduin.\nDragon Crisis.\nAs foretold by the Prophecy, Alduin would resurface in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt; amidst the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. After making his presence known with an attack on &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;, he began visiting the dragon burial sites across Skyrim to resurrect his subordinate dragons and reestablish his dominance over the world. The resurgence of the dragons and their ancient reign of terror became known as the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. It was during this time that the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; emerged to challenge the World Eater. Only the Dragonborn was able to hinder the dragons' onslaught and only they could put a permanent end to them by absorbing their souls. With help from Paarthurnax, the Dragonborn learned the &lt;a href=\"Dragonrend\"&gt;Dragonrend&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt;, which was needed to defeat Alduin, and dealt Alduin a minor defeat at the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;. The final confrontation occurred in the Nordic afterlife of &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;, where the three Nordic heroes who banished Alduin in the past joined the Dragonborn to stop the dragon once and for all, or until the end of time comes, as &lt;a href=\"Esbern%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Esbern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arngeir\"&gt;Arngeir&lt;/a&gt; speculate.\nNature and identity.\n&lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nordic&lt;/a&gt; legends assert that Alduin is a god-like entity which destroyed the last world in order to begin the current one, in what is considered the creation of a new &lt;a href=\"Kalpa\"&gt;Kalpa&lt;/a&gt;. He bears resemblance to the &lt;a href=\"Yokudan\"&gt;Yokudan&lt;/a&gt; god &lt;a href=\"Satakal\"&gt;Satakal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; god &lt;a href=\"Atakota\"&gt;Atakota&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;i god &lt;a href=\"Alkhan\"&gt;Alkhan&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Skaal\"&gt;Skaal&lt;/a&gt; know him as Thartaag the World-Devourer, though scholars speculate the &lt;a href=\"All-Maker\"&gt;All-Maker&lt;/a&gt; might be an \"echo\" of Alduin. As a result, Alduin has been seen both as creator and destroyer by various cultures, with his existence predating the creation of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; itself. There are legends of his battles with the god &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of time. Much like Nordic legends, Khajiiti songs assert that Alkhan was slain by &lt;a href=\"Lorkhaj\"&gt;Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt; and his companions, and that he will return in time, as he is immortal. Alduin also conspired with &lt;a href=\"Orkey\"&gt;Orkey&lt;/a&gt; to reduce all the Nords to children, until he was again defeated by Shor by request of King &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt;. Alduin is also known in old tales for his ability to devour the souls of the dead, and by doing so he can increase his power. Alduin is considered the wellspring of the Nordic pantheon, a depiction that bears resemblance to those of Satakal and Atakota in their respective pantheons, in which they are represented as the being that enabled the &lt;a href=\"et%27Ada\"&gt;et'Ada&lt;/a&gt; to form.\n&lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; scholars speculate that Alduin is the name by which the ancient Nords knew &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, the dragon god of time and later patron deity of the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. However, some Nords consider this a mischaracterization, maintaining that Alduin and Akatosh are indeed regarded as separate beings in Nordic legend. Alduin called himself \"Firstborn of Akatosh.\" According to &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt;, Alduin's dragon peers considered him Akatosh's most acclaimed creation. Additionally, it was stated that Alduin \"has always been.\" Some sources suggest he was split from Akatosh, or possibly the greater Aka-Tusk, and that Alduin embodies a particular aspect of the time god."}

The Dragonborn will need to return to &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt; atop the Throat of the World and read the scroll at the Time Wound. When the Elder Scroll is read, a cinematic scene will begin. The Dragonborn will see an image of three &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nordic&lt;/a&gt; heroes: &lt;a href=\"Gormlaith%20Golden-Hilt\"&gt;Gormlaith Golden-Hilt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hakon%20One-Eye\"&gt;Hakon One-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Felldir%20the%20Old\"&gt;Felldir the Old&lt;/a&gt;, as they are battling several of Alduin's brethren as the area around the Throat of the World is littered with the dead bodies of both dragons and Nords. The Dragonborn will then learn all three words of the Dragonrend shout, which will be used to defeat Alduin in a battle afterward, before watching as Alduin slays Gomlaith, forcing Hakon to keep him distracted while Felldir uses the Elder Scroll to banish Alduin into time. Once the Dragonborn comes out of the vision, Alduin will attack them and Paarthurnax. Dragonrend is used on Alduin to make him land on the ground, where the Dragonborn can then begin to damage him. After Alduin is defeated, he will fly off and escape to &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;, taunting the Dragonborn that this defeat does not count and they will meet again."}

It is considered to be one of the best preserved examples of early Akaviri sculptural relief, as well as a wonder of the ancient world.\nAlduin's Wall depicts several key events through the history of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Jagar Tharn's rule&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, the activation of the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;, the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;eruption&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; and the return of &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, the World-Eater.\nHistory.\nEmperor &lt;a href=\"Reman%20II\"&gt;Reman II&lt;/a&gt; permitted the construction of Alduin's Wall in &lt;a href=\"1E%202812\"&gt;1E 2812&lt;/a&gt;. Its purpose was to concisely commit to record all of the dragonlore the &lt;a href=\"Blades%23Origins\"&gt;Akaviri Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt; had accumulated over the course of their existence, and to preserve this knowledge against the forgetfulness of the ages. Given that the return of &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; was inevitable, the Dragonguard constructed Alduin's Wall as a timeless message and a warning to all generations that were to follow.\nAkaviri craftsmen and artisans from &lt;a href=\"Blade\"&gt;Blade&lt;/a&gt; temples across the Empire were called upon to labor on the Wall, and after six years it was completed. &lt;a href=\"Reman%20II\"&gt;Reman II&lt;/a&gt; visited the &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt; complex to officially commemorate the monument's construction, and the Blood Seal at the temple's entrance was consecrated in the presence of Reman II and all the Akaviri Dragonguard of Skyrim. This allowed the temple to be sealed, only to ever be opened again by the blood of a &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite being a wonder of the ancient world and the grave reasons for its construction, the location of Alduin's Wall slowly became lost over the passage of the countless centuries, and its very existence, ironically, was forgotten by almost all in the world.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Alduin%27s%20Wall%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Alduin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn must venture to &lt;a href=\"Karthspire\"&gt;Karthspire&lt;/a&gt;, where they will meet &lt;a href=\"Delphine%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delphine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Esbern%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Esbern&lt;/a&gt;.

It is here they find the Prophecy of the Dragonborn, carved unto Alduin's Wall.\nProphecy of the Dragonborn.\nThe Prophecy of the Dragonborn has been said to originate in an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt;, although it is sometimes also attributed to ancient Akaviri wisemen. The left and central sections of Alduin's Wall depict the historic events of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt; and the banishment of &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; by the ancient &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; heroes. The right section of the Wall foretells of five key historical events that will preface Alduin's return after his expulsion from the world. These include, from left to right:\n&lt;poem style=\"text-align: center;font-style: italic;\"&gt;\nWhen misrule takes its place at the eight corners of the world\nWhen the Brass Tower walks and Time is reshaped\nWhen the thrice-blessed fail and the Red Tower trembles\nWhen the Dragonborn Ruler loses his throne, and the White Tower falls\nWhen the Snow Tower lies sundered, kingless, bleeding\nThe World-Eater wakes, and the Wheel turns upon the Last Dragonborn.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe Dragon War.\nThe left section of the Wall narrates how thousands of years ago, lost in the uncounted centuries of the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; which came before recorded history, the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt; were ravaging the land, waging war against the races of &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt; and driving them before the might of their &lt;a href=\"Voice\"&gt;Voice&lt;/a&gt;. The humans could not stand against such a force. Some among them would come to &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;worship&lt;/a&gt; the Dragons, but all feared them. For the first of three times, &lt;a href=\"Alduin%2C%20the%20World-Eater\"&gt;Alduin, the World-Eater&lt;/a&gt; is depicted.\nAlduin's Banishment.\nThe goddess &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; took pity on the broken hearts of Men, and intervened by granting mortals the ability to speak as Dragons do. The large central relief of the Wall portrays Alduin's initial downfall to the courage and tenacity of the champions of Men; the three ancient &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; heroes who were the first and mightiest of the &lt;a href=\"Tongues\"&gt;Tongues&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Felldir%20the%20Old\"&gt;Felldir the Old&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hakon%20One-Eye\"&gt;Hakon One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gormlaith%20Golden-Hilt\"&gt;Gormlaith Golden-Hilt&lt;/a&gt;, who used the combined power of the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt; to shout Alduin from the world and cast him adrift in the currents of time.\nThe Staff of Chaos.\nThe right section of the Wall prophesies of five key historical events that foreshadow the World-Eater's return. The first of these events presaged by the prophecy is the shattering of the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, an event depicted in .\nThe Staff of Chaos was a powerful relic that could open gateways to other worlds and obliterate all living beings. The Imperial battlemage &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; used this mysterious artifact to imprison the Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; within the realm of Oblivion, after which he broke it into eight pieces and scattered them across Tamriel; events transcribed unto Alduin's Wall centuries before they had come to pass.\nNumidium and the Warp in the West.\nThe depiction of &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt; walking upon Tamriel is the second event in the prophecy that augurs Alduin's return. The massive brass golem, Numidium, was reassembled during the events of . The branching choices that determined who would control Numidium resulted in the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;, a strange occurrence within the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; region which paradoxically allowed for all possible outcomes to happen simultaneously.\nThis event dramatically altered the nature of the world, and brought about a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt;: An unexplainable occurrence that forces a realignment of time and space in reaction to circumstances which render a normal continuity of reality impossible\u2014in this case, the activation of Numidium.\nThe Disaster at Red Mountain.\nThe third segment of the prophecy presages the \"failure of the thrice-blessed,\" and foretells of the fate that would befall the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Dunmeri Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;, as portrayed in .\nThe Tribunal consisted of the three &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; gods: &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; who acquired their immortality and powers through the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;. They lost their immortality after the Heart was destroyed by the Nerevarine.\nThe Oblivion Crisis.\nThe fourth historic event foretold by the prophecy is the death of emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;, leading Tamriel into the Oblivion Crisis as portrayed in .\nA previously unknown heir to Uriel Septim VII, known as &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;, was, along with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, able to seal the gates to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; in the darkest hours of the Oblivion Crisis. However, by destroying the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; and sacrificing himself to prevent the Empire's annihilation at the hands of the Daedra hordes, Martin Septim inadvertently brought about the demise of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s bloodline, ending the historical rule of the Dragonborn emperors over Tamriel.\nThe fall of the White Tower predicts the capturing and sacking of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; after the siege of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, a dramatic series of events that transpired during &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20War\"&gt;The Great War&lt;/a&gt; between the Empire and the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Civil War.\nThe final of events, prophesied to herald the ultimate return of the World-Eater, is the Civil War in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. As begins, &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Torygg\"&gt;Torygg&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim has been killed by &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the province without a unifying leader after the region was plunged into civil war.\nMany within the northern province argue Skyrim ought to secede from the Empire, which has lost its Dragonborn rulers with the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;; additionally, it is beset by corruption and intrigues and has become subject to the dictates of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for a tenuous peace. Other Nords refuse to recant their belief that the Empire and its legacy are still worth fighting for, and view the calls for secession as tantamount to high treason. Armed conflict between the two factions becomes inevitable.\nThe Throat of the World.\nThe highest mountain in all of Tamriel, called the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the \"Snow-Throat,\" and alleged to be the site of the birth of &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt; according to the most ancient of legends, houses &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt;; the monastery of the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt;. Here on Alduin's Wall, as part of the relief that pictures the prophecy's final segment, the Throat of the World is depicted as cleft in half, symbolizing how &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; will tear itself apart.\nHope.\nThe prophecy that is related through Alduin's Wall is dire, but it is not without hope. For &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;one individual&lt;/a&gt;, gifted by &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; with the same &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;incredible powers&lt;/a&gt; held by the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt; themselves, has been foretold to become .\nThe warriors pictured adjacent to the Dragonborn's relief are the original members of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt;, the legendary cabal of &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; dragon slayers, who are shown to bow before the Dovahkiin and who raise their blades in triumph at his side. For millennia, the Dragonguard have endeavored to protect those they consider Dragonborn in their anticipation of this final moment of prophecy, when on the eve of Alduin's fateful return, the last of the Dragonblood arises to stand against the World-Eater."}

He believes that the secret to defeating Alduin will be revealed on Alduin's Wall, an artefact created by the ancient Blades. We need to go to Sky Haven Temple to find Alduin's Wall and see what it can tell us.\"\"\nWalkthrough.\nAfter the\u00a0Dragonborn\u00a0and Esbern arrive at\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Riverwood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riverwood&lt;/a&gt;, they meet with Delphine at the &lt;a href=\"Sleeping%20Giant%20Inn\"&gt;Sleeping Giant Inn&lt;/a&gt;. They say\u00a0that the Dragonborn\u00a0must go to Alduin's Wall, which is in &lt;a href=\"Karthspire\"&gt;Karthspire&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0located in Sky Haven Temple.\u00a0The\u00a0Dragonborn\u00a0may travel with Delphine and Esbern, or meet them at the Karthspire.\nArriving in Karthspire or meeting up at the entrance to the Karthspire camp,\u00a0the group will encounter a number of leveled &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Hagraven&lt;/a&gt;. Note: The lower wooden bridge continues up the hill to the other side where there are more Forsworn. If\u00a0they\u00a0are not\u00a0killed initially, they will attack from above with Ice Spike on\u00a0the way into Karthspire (Sky Haven Temple). Alternatively, the Dragonborn can start at &lt;a href=\"Pavo%27s%20House\"&gt;Pavo's House&lt;/a&gt;, cross the bridge to the south and with a horse, and climb the mountain in the center of the river. Descending the east side in stealth, the Dragonborn can reach the caverns without any combat. This may trigger Delphine and Esbern entering the camp; however, they are essential at this point, and entering the caverns will teleport them inside from wherever they are.\nA &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0may also spawn at the camp, on some occasions, increasing the chaos in the camp. The dragon might attack both the Dragonborn\u00a0and their allies, as well as the Forsworn. The attacking dragon may be as high as an ancient dragon, even if the Dragonborn is low level.\nUpon entering into the caverns,\u00a0there will be an encounter with several more Forsworn, including a &lt;a href=\"Forsworn%20Briarheart\"&gt;Forsworn Briarheart&lt;/a&gt;. Delphine and Esbern run ahead, allowing the Dragonborn to look for loot. There is an iron ore vein in the bottom area of the first section. They stop at the first puzzle, which controls a drop-bridge that further passage into the mountain. The puzzle solution, with Esbern's hint, is to align them so that all three show the \"Dragonborn symbol.\" Once the bridges drop, the group can cross and go higher into the mountain.\nAgain, the party stops when Esbern looks ahead and sees danger in a patio area consisting of pressure plates with symbols on them. Esbern points out the Dragonborn symbol and, sure enough, walking only on these plates allows safe passage across to where a chain can be pulled that disarms the trap part of the plates. Note that any follower will cause interference while walking across the pressure plates, but this can be avoided by telling the follower to wait while the puzzle is crossed. Once the chain is pulled, Esbern and Delphine run ahead. At this point, a follower can be told to \"follow\" again without causing problems. Note that &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;Whirlwind Sprint&lt;/a&gt; can be used to get across and quickly pull the chain. Another method is to use the &lt;a href=\"Become%20Ethereal\"&gt;Become Ethereal&lt;/a&gt; shout and simply walk across the plates, taking no damage. If the drawbridge was opened before Esbern says anything about turning the pillars, it is possible to run ahead and just pull the chain without the pressure plates being activated.\nThe tunnel opens up into a large room just prior to the Temple. In the wall ahead, there is a very large stone face, and a few feet in front of the face is a circular platform. Esbern thinks the entrance will open if the Dragonborn sheds a few drops of blood onto the pressure plate. If the plate is activated, a cut-scene plays showing the Dragonborn's hand being cut to dribble some blood on the plate. The face slides up and reveals a doorway. A treasure chest with a quicksilver vein can be seen to the right. \"Note: The plate cannot be activated if the quest is not active.\"\nInstead of racing ahead like they have until now, Esbern and Delphine decide that the Dragonborn should have the honor of being the first to enter the great Sky Haven Temple. As a large, open room is approached with a large table and a carved stone frieze, Esbern reverts to historical scholar. As he examines the frieze wall, he explains that it tells the story of &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;'s time of dragon rule, the human rebellion led by those who could \"Shout,\" and finally a panel that shows Alduin defeated by a Shout. Esbern fears that only this Shout will defeat Alduin. Delphine is not pleased about involving the &lt;a href=\"Greybeard\"&gt;Greybeard&lt;/a&gt;s at &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, but agrees that it is necessary to return to them and ask to learn that Shout.\nAfter the conversation with Esbern, he offers a &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%27s%20Blessing\"&gt;Dragonslayer's Blessing&lt;/a&gt; that will increase the chance to gain critical hits against dragons by 10% for 5 days. It is possible to talk to him and get the blessing again, but he advises that it should only be obtained if battles with dragons are expected.\nThe room on the opposite side from Alduin's Wall (to the left at the top of the stairs) has a complete set of &lt;a href=\"Blades%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt; and the sword &lt;a href=\"Dragonbane\"&gt;Dragonbane&lt;/a&gt; (a weapon that is especially effective against dragons). An upper room has a number of beds and chests. Delphine decides the Temple will be the new Blades headquarters. The Dragonborn can induct three members into the Blades.\nThe exit indicator takes the Dragonborn back through the entire &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt;, then through &lt;a href=\"Karthspire\"&gt;Karthspire&lt;/a&gt; to the entrance. It is possible, however, to exit from the Temple quickly. Starting at &lt;a href=\"Alduin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Alduin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;, to the left is a staircase. The left doorway leads to the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; sleeping quarters. The right doorway leads to a staircase up. Turning right, heading down the corridor, then left up another staircase, the Dragonborn ends up directly behind and above Alduin's Wall. There are 5 doors leading out to a courtyard, where the Dragonborn can &lt;a href=\"Fast%20Travel%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fast travel&lt;/a&gt; to their next destination. In the courtyard, there are a couple of archery targets and a practice dummy, &lt;a href=\"hanging%20moss\"&gt;hanging moss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Juniper%20Berries%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;juniper berries&lt;/a&gt; and a stump with &lt;a href=\"mora%20tapinella\"&gt;mora tapinella&lt;/a&gt;.\nRebuilding the Blades.\nAt this point in the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;main Storyline&lt;/a&gt; the Dragonborn has not yet encountered &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt;. Later, during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Kill Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt;\" they will have to choose irrevocably, and without warning, between the Greybeards and the Blades. If Paarthurnax is spared, all quests pertaining to the Blades will become and remain unavailable until he is slain, either before or after his brother Alduin later on in \"&lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer\"&gt;Dragonslayer&lt;/a&gt;\". Thus, beforehand, after completing this quest (\"Alduin's Wall\"), it is possible to acquire the following quests:"}

However, if you are behind, the destruction effect and Alduin's huge stats will generate a massive momentum swing in your favor, compounded further by his ability to revive a dragon every turn. This can be particularly devastating if he revives a creature with a powerful Summon effect, such as &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Odahviing%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Odahviing&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlduin's main weakness is his prohibitively high magicka cost. As such, he should only be played in control decks with a number of Dragons. &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt; decks are generally best suited for summoning Alduin as they have many ways to accelerate their magicka growth. In general, however, Odahviing may be a more reliable and flexible option, as it does not destroy your own creatures when played and has a less extreme magicka cost."}

He is considered the \"wellspring\" of the Nordic pantheon, as well as the harbinger of the apocalypse. He is also described as the \"creator of dragon civilization\" in one particular text.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Unbound\"&gt;Unbound&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the executions, Alduin will be flying above &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;, and his roars can be faintly heard. Once the Last Dragonborn is placed on the chopping block, he will land on top of the tower above and use the roar that summons a storm raining meteors down from the sky to cause havoc and destruction in the settlement. During the Dragonborn's escape from the village and into &lt;a href=\"Helgen%20Keep\"&gt;Helgen Keep&lt;/a&gt;, he will be seen fighting a number of Imperial soldiers, and may land and attack the Dragonborn in front of the keep if the Dragonborn does not escape quickly enough. Once the keep is escaped through the cave, he will be seen flying above, and will fly away to the east.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Blade%20in%20the%20Dark\"&gt;A Blade in the Dark&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Delphine\"&gt;Delphine&lt;/a&gt; both travel to &lt;a href=\"Kynesgrove\"&gt;Kynesgrove&lt;/a&gt; during this quest. Here is where Delphine has predicted that the next &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; will be resurrected. It turns out Delphine is right and here, on a dragon burial mound, Alduin can be seen flying above. A blue light is rising out of the mound. Alduin will use a shout to resurrect this dragon. He speaks the words \"Slen Tiid Vo!\" and a shout that looks similar to &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt; will go into the mound, causing the stone lid to crumble and burst apart. A skeletal dragon will then rise from the mound and start speaking to Alduin. After a small conversation between the two dragons, the skeletal dragon will regain his scales. This dragon is known as &lt;a href=\"Sahloknir\"&gt;Sahloknir&lt;/a&gt;. They will then notice the Dragonborn, at which point Alduin taunts the Dragonborn on their lack of knowledge of the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;, before ordering Sahloknir to kill both the Dragonborn and Delphine before taking his leave.\n&lt;a href=\"Alduin%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Alduin's Bane&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the vision of the past seen through the &lt;a href=\"Time%20Wound\"&gt;Time Wound&lt;/a&gt;, three heroes known as &lt;a href=\"Felldir%20the%20Old\"&gt;Felldir the Old&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gormlaith%20Golden-Hilt\"&gt;Gormlaith Golden-Hilt&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hakon%20One-Eye\"&gt;Hakon One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; are seen fighting off the dragons. Gormlaith will kill a dragon whom lands by jumping on to it and then stabbing it in the head. Afterwards the heroes will discuss the possible use of an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt; to defeat Alduin, but Hakon says it is to dangerous. Alduin will come down to fight them and then the three heroes will use &lt;a href=\"Dragonrend\"&gt;Dragonrend&lt;/a&gt; to bring down Alduin. Alduin will then engage in combat with the three heroes. Gormlaith will be killed by Alduin and then Hakon will tell Felldir to use the Elder Scroll. Alduin will continue to fight Hakon for a short time before noticing what Felldir is doing. Alduin will turn to Felldir and try burning him with &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Breath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fire Breath&lt;/a&gt;, but this does not work and Alduin is sent forward in time.\nUpon awakening from the vision, &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt; will say that he hopes the vision told the Dragonborn what he needed to know because Alduin has arrived. Alduin taunts the Dragonborn that their time is up and once he kills them, their soul will feed his hunger in Sovngarde, only for Paarthurnax to retort that he is too late. The two brothers exchange words as they engage in battle in the skies. Alduin will start the battle by roaring and summoning a storm that rains meteors down from the sky. The only way to damage Alduin is to use the Dragonrend shout. Upon Alduin's defeat, Alduin will fly away to &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon entering Sovngarde, Alduin can be seen flying around in the back. He will occasionally swoop down to pick up a soul in Sovngarde. The Dragonborn must travel through the mist that Alduin has set up until they reach the Hall of Shor. Here the three heroes will again come out to fight Alduin, although this time they have the Dragonborn to help them win.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer\"&gt;Dragonslayer&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the battle can begin, the Dragonborn and the three heroes must disperse the mist that covers the land. They use &lt;a href=\"Clear%20Skies\"&gt;Clear Skies&lt;/a&gt; to get rid of the mist, but Alduin will make the mist reappear. This process must be repeated a few times before finally Alduin will come out and battle. After killing Alduin, the Dragonborn will not absorb his soul. Instead, Alduin explodes after yelling words in the dragon language that, when translated, indicate his defiant refusal to believe he can truly be slain.\nBackground.\nIdentity.\nScholars speculate that Alduin is the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic name attributed to Akatosh. One source states that Alduin and Akatosh are different deities entirely. Alduin calls himself the \"Firstborn of Akatosh.\" Exactly what the \"Firstborn of Akatosh\" means is unclear, although some sources suggest he was split from the time god at some point in the past. According to &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt;, Alduin's peers considered him the most acclaimed creation of Akatosh. According to some sources, Alduin is the firstborn of a deity named &lt;a href=\"Akha\"&gt;Akha&lt;/a&gt;, a greater time god than Alduin or Akatosh, from whom both time gods originate alongside the dragons. \nHistory.\nNordic myth asserts that Alduin destroyed the last world to begin this one, a process known as a &lt;a href=\"Kalpa\"&gt;Kalpa&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, Alduin is perceived as both creator and destroyer, as well as predating the creation of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; itself. There are legends of his battles with &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; during this time.\nDuring the Merethic Era, the people of &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt; and Skyrim worshiped dragons, possibly at the urging of Alduin. He also conspired with &lt;a href=\"Orkey\"&gt;Orkey&lt;/a&gt; to reduce all the Nords to children, until he was again defeated by &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt;. Some consider that Alduin's rule during this period was foresaking his proper role as the World-Eater. Alduin served as a leader of the dragons, and he ruled with an iron fist. The humans either worshiped him or were enslaved. The humans worshiped him and the dragons in the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt;. High ranking members of this cult would be known as a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt;. Alduin's lieutenant at the time was &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt;, but secretly Paarthurnax was betraying him. Paarthurnax was teaching the voice to the humans so that they could rebel against their dragon overlords. The ensuing war would be known as the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was ultimately sent forward in time through the actions of three Nordic heroes, who created a new &lt;a href=\"Shout\"&gt;Shout&lt;/a&gt; to subdue him, and used an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt; to send Alduin forward in time.\nProphecy.\nA prophecy foretelling Alduin's return is on &lt;a href=\"Alduin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Alduin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;, located at &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt;, built in the First Era and recounted in the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20the%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Book of the Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly on &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt;. It tells that the World-Eater will return after various tumultuous events have occurred, retelling events have led up to this point, and claiming that the Last Dragonborn will come forth at that time."}

I ent never rote a book before, and I do not reckon to rite one agenn, but sometimes a man must do what a man must do. And what I must do is set the recerd strate about the god called &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; and the dragon called &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;. They ent the same thing, no matter what them Imperials mite say, or how thay mite wish it to be so. \nMy da was never one for the &lt;a href=\"gods\"&gt;gods&lt;/a&gt;, but my mother was. She wershipped all the &lt;a href=\"Divines\"&gt;Divines&lt;/a&gt;, and tot me lots of things. So I noe a thing or two about Akatosh. Just as much as any Imperial. I noe he was the first of all the gods to take shape in the Beginning Place. And I noe he has the shape of a dragon.\nMy da even told me the story of &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martyn Septim&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;things what happened&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;gates&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; opened. Septim turned into the &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Akatosh\"&gt;spirit of Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; and killed &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;. Now I don't noe about you, but any dragon that fites the Prince of Destruction is okay by me.\nNow I hope you understand the problim. Akatosh is good. Everyone, from &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; to Imperial noes that. But Alduin? He ent good! He's the oposit of good! That Alduin is evil thrue and thrue. So you see, Akatosh and Alduin cant be one and the same.\nGrowing up as a lad in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, I herd all the stories. Told to me by me da, who was told by his da, who was told by his da, and so on. And one of those stories was about Alduin. But see, he was not Akatosh. He was another dragon and a real wun at that.\nAkatosh is some kind of spirit dragon I think, wen he bothers to be a &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; at all (and not a god livin in sum kind of god plac like Obliviun). But Alduin is a real dragon, with flesh and teeth and a mean streak longer than the &lt;a href=\"White%20River\"&gt;White River&lt;/a&gt;. And there was a time when Alduin tried to rool over all of Skyrim with his other dragons. In the end, it took sum &lt;a href=\"Tongues%23Ancient%20Nord%20Heroes\"&gt;mitey strong heroes&lt;/a&gt; to finally kill Alduin and be dun with his holy sorry story. So I got to ask - does that sound like Akatosh to you? No, friend. No it does not.\nAnd so I, &lt;a href=\"Thromgar%20Iron-Head\"&gt;Thromgar Iron-Head&lt;/a&gt; do firmly say, with the utmost connvicshun, that Alduin is real, and he ent Akatosh!"}

But it is a fact that she grew up in &lt;a href=\"Sardavar%20Leed\"&gt;Sardavar Leed&lt;/a&gt;, known at the time as \"Sard\", where the Ayleids herded in men from across all the &lt;a href=\"Niben\"&gt;Niben&lt;/a&gt;.\nFounding of Skyrim.\nThe Nordic &lt;a href=\"King%20Harald\"&gt;King Harald&lt;/a&gt; had conquered &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and founded the first human kingdom on the continent of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Harald managed to drive the elves completely out of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, primarily into &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, and the human slaves saw the possibility of doing the same to their own rulers. At the same time, the Ayleid government was severely fractured: dozens of separate kingdoms or city-states constantly fought against each other for power, and a strong minority of Ayleid nobility had become sympathetic to the human cause. Alessia appears to have taken advantage of the period of Ayleid civil war to launch her uprising.\nDivine help.\nThe Ayleid generally worshipped the Altmeri divines, but also dealt frequently with &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt; for assistance in keeping their slaves in line. The &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim worshipped a distinct group of gods, who were much more sympathetic to &lt;a href=\"Human%20Skin\"&gt;humanity&lt;/a&gt; than &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt;. Alessia began to pray to these gods for assistance in freeing her people. At &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;, a vision was given by &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;).\nKynareth sent her son, the Nordic demi-god hero &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt;, to advise and aid Alessia. During this period, Morihaus is usually identified as Alessia's lover, though the &lt;a href=\"Song%20of%20Pelinal\"&gt;Song of Pelinal&lt;/a&gt; claims he was embarrassed at his appearance because of her. He helped her to rally the other slaves to her cause. From that moment she was known as the Slave-Queen. Kynareth also sent Alessia visions that would aid her fight against her masters. The third of these visions was of another legendary figure of the First Era, the infamous crusader &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt;, who was sent to Alessia to become the leader of her army.\nRebellion.\nAround the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20242\"&gt;1E 242&lt;/a&gt;, Alessia's rebel army finally struck out at their masters. Pelinal Whitestrake in particular became legendary for his brutal decimation of the Ayleid armies and kings. Alessia herself often had to intercede with the divines on his behalf after \"the Madness\" took him and he committed particularly atrocious acts, such as slaughtering anybody in his way, Ayleid or not. The Nordic king to the North wasted little time in joining Alessia's revolt, and the human armies quickly began to drive the Ayleids out of the populated regions of Cyrodiil. The human strategy was to drive the Ayleids inward, towards the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;, forcing the front into increasingly smaller circles around &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Rumare\"&gt;Lake Rumare&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was during this period, late in the war, that the Ayleid king &lt;a href=\"Umaril\"&gt;Umaril&lt;/a&gt; was given control of the Ayleid armies. Umaril, like Pelinal and Morihaus, was of a divine bloodline, having an Ayleid mother and a divine father of a previous &lt;a href=\"kalpa\"&gt;kalpa&lt;/a&gt;. As such, he was one of the few able to match Pelinal in battle. To further his advantage, Umaril made a deal with the Daedric Lord &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;, and was granted use of his &lt;a href=\"Auroran\"&gt;Auroran&lt;/a&gt;s as foot soldiers. Pelinal eventually defeated Umaril, but just barely, and Umaril's spirit escaped to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; where he would wait and return centuries later. The remaining Ayleid kings swarmed down on Pelinal's injured body, tore him into eight pieces, and left his head for Alessia and Morihaus to find.\nHowever, even the death of Pelinal couldn't halt the human revolt. After years of fighting, Alessia's army finally took control of the White Gold Tower itself, ending forever the reign of the Ayleid in Tamriel. Alessia was named the first Empress of the Empire of Cyrodiil.\nFirst Empire.\nAlessia's victory over the Ayleids was not possible without intervention from &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, but she had at least as much help from rebel Ayleid lords during the siege of White Gold Tower. The popular image of the Ayleids as brutal slavemasters is a fact, but it is less well known that a number of Ayleid princes continued to rule parts of Cyrodiil after, as vassals of the new Empress of Cyrodiil. Alessia and her successors were more pragmatic than is traditionally believed.\nEight Divines.\nAlessia's first major act as Empress was to abolish worship of the Ayleid gods. However, she was a shrewd politician, enough to realize that her people had never known any other gods. Alessia knew she had to be careful in choosing the official state religion; she could not afford to anger her Nordic allies, but her own people could not adjust to the complete Nordic pantheon in just a single generation. Her compromise was to merge the two religions, choosing to keep the less controversial Ayleid gods, such as &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; and bring in popular Nordic ones, such as &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt; and recreating Kyne as Kynareth. She sidestepped the issue of Lorkhan by leaving him out of her Eight Divines, but identifying him as the \"missing ninth god,\" a brother to the Eight Divines who was otherwise absent from the pantheon. The worship of the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt;, along with the Empire itself, would go on to become the most prominent religion across all of Tamriel.\nCovenant and death.\nNear the end of her reign, as Alessia lay dying, she was visited by Akatosh, who bound her soul to the Amulet of Kings, before Pelinal took her up, possibly to &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy.\nAfter binding Alessia's soul to the amulet, Akatosh named her \"St. Alessia\", the first saint of the humans. Her followers would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt;, and remained in power over a third of Tamriel for decades. They would be responsible for ultimately driving the last of the Ayleids out of Tamriel, and imposing strict anti-elven practices across Tamriel for much of the First Era. While the Order itself ultimately died out, St. Alessia continued to be venerated as part of the modern Imperial Pantheon after its demise.\nThe covenant struck with Akatosh to keep Oblivion shut was also made with Alessia's descendants. In this way, Alessia would be the first of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; emperors. A few centuries later, &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, the hero who defeated the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, would formalize the process of lighting the Dragonfires and passing the Amulet as the rites used to crown a new Emperor; even during the worst periods of Cyrodiil's history, the fires remained lit and kept Tamriel safe, until the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, marked by the assassination of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Emperor Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; and all known heirs to the throne. &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt; was the last Dragonborn emperor to wear the Amulet of Kings, and sealed the gates of Oblivion with his death."}

It was the prohibitions contained in this law that caused various kingdoms to begin fighting against the Alessian Order.\nFoundation.\nThe precursor to the codification of the Alessian Doctrines proper happened after &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; herself rose to power in the heartlands. Desiring to unify &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Nedic\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; peoples Alessia realized a compromise must be made, thus the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodil\"&gt;Cyrodil&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt; came into being. &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; became &lt;a href=\"Shezarr\"&gt;Shezarr&lt;/a&gt;, a toned-down version of the genocidal warlord, while &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; was merged with &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; to become &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Alessian Doctrines themselves were codified by &lt;a href=\"Marukh\"&gt;Marukh&lt;/a&gt;, and would go on to become the heart and soul of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The founder of this sect Marukh, believed he received visions directly from Alessia herself. These visions convinced Marukh that elven rule was flawed from the very core.\nCore principles.\nThe doctrines were composed of seventy-seven rules, the nature of all of the doctrines themselves is unknown.\nThe heart of these principles centers on a belief of Monotheism, while the majority of the &lt;a href=\"Et%27Ada\"&gt;Et'Ada&lt;/a&gt; were relegated to &lt;a href=\"saint\"&gt;saint&lt;/a&gt;hood. The religion would absorb worship of minor deities into its pantheon by venerating ancestor spirits and god-animals. Imperial loyalty was also enforced particularly strongly in the doctrines, spiritual worship was tied directly to the &lt;a href=\"emperor\"&gt;emperor&lt;/a&gt;.\nRemoving elven literature was an important undertaking, the Order declared an intellectual war on the populace of the heartlands performing a cleansing of elven manuscripts. Only articles which were extremely widespread survived this purging.\nHostility to unsanctioned &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; users also pervaded the Order, at the time of the Orders rise there was no centralized study of magic outside of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;. Solitary magic users were hunted down by roving bands of mobs.\nThe group was also particularly hostile to the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, banishing all trafficking with daimons. This is a vague rule however, as Marukh never explained what would be considered a daimon.\nA breakaway sect of the Alessian Order itself called the &lt;a href=\"Marukhati%20Selective\"&gt;Marukhati Selective&lt;/a&gt; desired to go even farther, they wanted to remove the elven aspects of Auri-El completely from the Divine Akatosh. However, committing this heresy broke the dragon for one thousand eight years. They did this by dancing on the tower of creation.\nReception.\nCharismatic leaders were able to quickly spread the doctrines among the poor masses, which they mobilized against the remaining &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; kingdoms. The integration of meat restrictions and animal worship would drive husbandry and farming to a standstill. The priesthood slowly replaced the &lt;a href=\"battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s as key political figures throughout the empire.\nThis outbreak of religion eventually turned against the Order. Manipulation by the priests caused a war with the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt;, which led to an uprising culminating at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Glenumbra%20Moors%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Battle of Glenumbra Moors&lt;/a&gt;. The doctrines, however, would form the heart and soul of the empire until its decline in &lt;a href=\"1E%202321\"&gt;1E 2321&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy.\nEven though the doctrines themselves perished with the Alessian Order, the effects would be felt in the following &lt;a href=\"eras\"&gt;eras&lt;/a&gt;. Legal principles into the fourth era still reflect the influence of the doctrines. The Eight Divines as an idea would survive the standardization of the Alessian Order to go on to become the prominent religion of all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlso due to the decline of the agrarian class a merchant class rose to take its place in the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Valley\"&gt;Nibenay Valley&lt;/a&gt;. This shift would define the Nibenay Valley city-state as the cultural and economic heart of Cyrodiil."}

It was the first established &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt; within the region of &lt;a href=\"Cyrod\"&gt;Cyrod&lt;/a&gt;, later known as the province of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. The empire fell after the ten year &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Righteousness\"&gt;War of Righteousness&lt;/a&gt;, which began in the year &lt;a href=\"1E%202321\"&gt;1E 2321&lt;/a&gt;, and ended in &lt;a href=\"1E%202331\"&gt;1E 2331&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAlessia's Reign.\nThe formation of the Alessian Empire was a direct result of the &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt; rebellion of &lt;a href=\"1E%20242\"&gt;1E 242&lt;/a&gt;, brought about by centuries of cruel treatment and abuse by &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;-inspired Ayleid slave masters. After the rebellion overthrew the Ayleid Hegemonies and seized &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20243\"&gt;1E 243&lt;/a&gt;, the Slave-Queen Alessia proclaimed herself the first Empress of Cyrodiil, with the promised covenant between Men and the Dragon god, &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;. The covenant proclaimed that so long as Alessia's descendants held the throne of Cyrodiil, and the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; remained lit, Tamriel would be safe from Daedric incursion. A loose alliance was formed between &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt; and Colovia, outlining the extent of what would be the immediate Alessian Empire.\nAs the High Priestess of Akatosh, Alessia became the leading religious authority within Cyrodiil, and was forced to decide on what faith the Empire would maintain. In order to please both the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, who were insurmountable in helping her cause, those Ayleids who stood with Alessia's rebellion, and the freed slaves who still kept elvish faith, Alessia merged portions of the Nordic Pantheon, and the Elven one, into a single religion, known wholly as the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt;, with Akatosh as its chief. It is stated that, in this early stage of the religion, &lt;a href=\"Shezarr\"&gt;Shezarr&lt;/a&gt; was reassigned to a role as the \"spirit behind all human undertaking.\"\nUnder Alessia's Empire, Ayleid nobles were allowed to keep their lordships as long as they submitted to the laws of the Empire and the Eight Divines religion; slavery was outlawed entirely. However, many Ayleids had already been driven out of the Empire during the rebellion.\nOn Alessia's death bed in &lt;a href=\"1E%20266\"&gt;1E 266&lt;/a&gt;, she was visited by the long dead hero of the Slave Rebellion, &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt;, as well as either Shezarr or Akatosh (or both), who gifted her with the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; and placed her soul within the Red Diamond, where the souls of her future descendents would be placed as well. She was succeeded by her alleged &lt;a href=\"Minotaur\"&gt;Minotaur&lt;/a&gt; son, &lt;a href=\"Belharza\"&gt;Belharza&lt;/a&gt; the Man-Bull, who was fathered by Alessia's demi-god lover &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt;. His reign was said to be plagued by \"elvish devils\". It was said that minotaurs began to appear in greater numbers around this time.\nThe Alessian Reform.\nWith the growing resentment of Ayleid nobility, a great religious and cultural movement, known as the Alessian Reform, began to spread throughout the human population of the Empire. The religious faction, known as the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt;, began in the jungles of the &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt;n coastline, with the &lt;a href=\"Imga\"&gt;Imga&lt;/a&gt; prophet &lt;a href=\"Marukh\"&gt;Marukh&lt;/a&gt;, who was said to have conversed with the spirit of Saint Alessia, on the questionable validity of Elven rulership, and sentiments that seemed to hint at the existence of only one \"true\" God. Marukh recorded Alessia's words with his own blood to create what were referred to as the \"Seventy-Seven Inflexible Doctrines\". Throughout the early &lt;a href=\"Timeline%234th%20Century\"&gt;4th Century&lt;/a&gt; of the First Era, many Ayleid cities within the Empire were sacked by Alessian sympathizers, sending the elves of Cyrodiil into a great panic. An ancient tablet called the \"Belharza Stone\" depicts the minotaur Emperor facing down his enemies, which appeared to be fanatical precursors of Alessian troops killing and driving off the minotaurs. This rise in anti-Aldmeri sentiment in Cyrodiil, however, did not deter the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; from opening up trade agreements with the Empire in &lt;a href=\"1E%20340\"&gt;1E 340&lt;/a&gt;. Hatred of Elves was further escalated in &lt;a href=\"1E%20358\"&gt;1E 358&lt;/a&gt;, when news began to spread that the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Empire\"&gt;Nordic Empire&lt;/a&gt; was losing more and more of &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Bretony\"&gt;Greater Bretony&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt;, resulting with the Alessian Emperor, &lt;a href=\"Ami-El\"&gt;Ami-El&lt;/a&gt;, sending armies to aid the Nords in their fight.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%20361\"&gt;1E 361&lt;/a&gt;, the Alessian Order successfully orchestrated a coup, taking control of the Alessian Empire and establishing the Seventy-Seven Doctrines, now referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Doctrines\"&gt;Alessian Doctrines&lt;/a&gt;, as its own theocratic constitution for the Empire, with the belief that religious and political matters were one in the same. The Doctrines were extremely harsh in regards to the Elven population, completely outlawing their ability to hold any noble titles. Pograms began to sprout out in a few Ayleid cities, convincing many Ayleids to leave Cyrodiil for other lands, while others decided to leave after being sent ultimatums from the Emperor. Most of the remaining Ayleids were absorbed into the elven populations of the lands that their exoduses led them to. In the West, the Colovians were in a secure enough position, socially and geographically, that they were able to resist the influences of the growing Alessian Reform. Isolating itself from the new Alessian hegemony, the Colovians instead created their own autonomous union, referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to spread their beliefs across Tamriel, the Alessian's incorporated the varying traditional pantheons of other religions into the Alessian canon, though, instead of recognizing them as deities, they were reappropriated as greater spirits or saints. With this inclusion, the Alessian Order quickly became the leading religious authority within Tamriel. The Doctrines were quickly accepted by the Nordic &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Borgas\"&gt;Borgas&lt;/a&gt;, who is believed to have enforced them within the Nordic Empire. With the Alessians now in full control, hostilities began to rise between the Empire and the Camoran Dynasty, resulting with the annulment of the trade treaty made only a few years prior. In response, High King Borgas traveled to Cyrodiil, in &lt;a href=\"1E%20369\"&gt;1E 369&lt;/a&gt; to propose a coalition between the Nordic and Alessian Empires to war against the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; of Valenwood. To prevent this from happening, a &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt; was initiated, which succeeded in its main goal of assassinating High King Borgas. After Borgas' death, the &lt;a href=\"Moot\"&gt;Moot&lt;/a&gt; failed to elect a successor to the throne, throwing Skyrim into the 50-year &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt;, and extinguishing the Nordic Empire. The War of Succession ended in the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20420\"&gt;1E 420&lt;/a&gt;, after Jarl &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20One-Eye\"&gt;Olaf One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; reunited Skyrim under his rule with the &lt;a href=\"Pact%20of%20Chieftains\"&gt;Pact of Chieftains&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime around the later reign of Olaf, or the early reign of his successor &lt;a href=\"Kjoric%20the%20White\"&gt;Kjoric the White&lt;/a&gt;, the Kingdom of Skyrim fell under the vassalage of the Alessian Empire.\nGoreius' reign.\nRislav's Rebellion.\nBy the beginning of Emperor Goreius' reign in &lt;a href=\"1E%20461\"&gt;1E 461&lt;/a&gt;, the Alessian Empire had grown so influential that, despite the Order's xenophobia, the leaders of &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt;, the Direnni Hegemony, and &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;, all attended his coronation. However, the majority of the Colovian Estates were still independent from the Empire's rule. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20472\"&gt;1E 472&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful alliance was formed between the two bickering kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href=\"Rislav%20Larich\"&gt;Rislav Larich&lt;/a&gt; of Skingrad was married to Belene of Kvatch. However, in the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20478\"&gt;1E 478&lt;/a&gt;, a great plague swept across the Colovian West, killing the majority of Skingrad's royal family. &lt;a href=\"Dorald%20Larich\"&gt;Dorald Larich&lt;/a&gt;, a very devout Alessian priest of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, was the immediate heir of the Kingdom of Skingrad, and, with the belief that to resist the Emperor was to resist the god, his first edict was the cession of Skingrad to the Alessian Empire, shocking the entirety of Colovia. Angered by this action, Rislav Larich made haste to Skingrad with a small group of warriors, and without contention from the guards, Rislav murdered his older brother and usurped the Kingdom of Skingrad. Around this time, High King &lt;a href=\"Kjoric%20the%20White\"&gt;Kjoric the White&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim attempted to secede from the Alessian Empire but was instead killed by the armies of Emperor Gorieus at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Sungard\"&gt;Battle of Sungard&lt;/a&gt;. While the Pact of Chieftans tried to elect a new leader, the Alessian Empire began invading Skyrim's southern territories. News quickly reached the Emperor that Rislav had taken control of Skingrad. In response, Gorieus marched westward to Skingrad, bringing an exceedingly massive army, with the intention of intimidating Rislav into submission and demonstrating to the Colovian Kings the true power of the Alessian Empire. However, instead of submitting to the Empire, Rislav triggered a surprise attack on the Alessian army before quickly retreating into the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Highlands\"&gt;Colovian Highlands&lt;/a&gt; with his own. Gorieus, falling right into Rislav's trap, pursued this army throughout the Highlands only to have his men slowly picked off by Skingrad troops. When it became apparent that the Alessian army was exhausted, demoralized, and suffering heavy casualties, Gorieus' army was led into an ambush by the armies of Kvatch. Unable to continue fighting, the Alessians retreated to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Reserve\"&gt;Imperial Reserve&lt;/a&gt;, then back to &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Valley\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar with the Direnni.\nRislav's success in his rebellion convinced the rest of the Colovian Estates to join Kvatch and Skingrad in their resistance against the Empire. It also inspired the leaders of &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Bloodline\"&gt;Clan Direnni&lt;/a&gt; to begin outlawing the growing Alessian Reform within the Direnni Hegemony. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20479\"&gt;1E 479&lt;/a&gt;, the hegemony began scourging those Bretons caught following the Alessian faith, in which the Alessians swiftly responded to with an invasion of &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt;. Full on warfare, between the Alessian Empire and Direnni Hegemony, broke out in &lt;a href=\"1E%20480\"&gt;1E 480&lt;/a&gt; with the Direnni winning many strategic victories in Alessian held territories. A delicate alliance was formed between Kjoric the White's son, now High King, &lt;a href=\"Hoag%20Merkiller\"&gt;Hoag Merkiller&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim, and the Direnni Hegemony, over their mutual hatred of the Alessians. The Alessian army eventually broke through the Direnni's defenses, pushing deep into &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20482\"&gt;1E 482&lt;/a&gt;, a plan was made by the Direnni and their Ayleid allies, to lure the advancing Alessian Army into &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20Moors\"&gt;Glenumbra Moors&lt;/a&gt; and ambush them there. Despite the Alessians truly expecting a counter-offensive, their army was still routed in the costly &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Glenumbra%20Moors%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Battle of Glenumbra Moors&lt;/a&gt;. While the Direnni were still capable of driving the remnants of the Alessian Army back out of High Rock, the battle so horribly diminished the Direnni's military power that they were no longer able to control the emerging power of the Bretons, causing the complete collapse of their empire by the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20500\"&gt;1E 500&lt;/a&gt;. Upon the death of Hoag Merkiller in the battle, the legendary &lt;a href=\"Ysmir%20Wulfharth\"&gt;Ysmir Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; was elected to the throne of Skyrim, in which his first edicts were a fiery reinstatement of the Nordic traditional pantheon. Wulfharth outlawed the Alessian Reform within Skyrim, putting all its priests to the stake and razing their monastic complexes, finally removing the shadow High King Borgas cast upon Skyrim. The defeat at Glenumbra Moors would be remembered for millennia as one of the greatest follies of the Alessian Order. The Alessian Empire, in its severely weakened state, was no longer able to assert its influence over rival nations, and would never fully recover.\nHestra's reign.\nAfter the Empire's sharp decline in power, it would not be until the start of Empress &lt;a href=\"Hestra\"&gt;Hestra&lt;/a&gt;'s reign over Cyrodiil, that the Empire would truly begin to recover from its past follies. Hestra was said to have soothed the long lasting tensions between the Alessian Empire and the Colovian West, possibly even admitting it into the Empire. In &lt;a href=\"1E%201029\"&gt;1E 1029&lt;/a&gt;, Hestra led a campaign against the dreaded &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt;-King Styriche of &lt;a href=\"Verkarth\"&gt;Verkarth&lt;/a&gt;, deposing him and pushing his army west. When Styriche's retreat was halted by the defenders of &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;, Hestra's army eliminated what remained of his Gray Host, and peacefully incorporated &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; into the Alessian Empire. Around the year &lt;a href=\"1E%201030\"&gt;1E 1030&lt;/a&gt;, Hestra's legions invaded the ten &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt;, with the intentions of annexing them into the Empire. The Empire made great progress at the beginning of the incursion, quickly conquering the entire Reach. However, given two years, the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Eagle\"&gt;Red Eagle&lt;/a&gt;'s insurrection was able to completely remove Imperial influence from the Reach. Hestra responded to this with a full-fledged invasion of the Reach, swiftly reconquering the territory and killing the Red Eagle. Hestra is also credited with commencing a staunch war on piracy in &lt;a href=\"1E%201033\"&gt;1E 1033&lt;/a&gt;, most notably on the various pirates using &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; as a launching point for raids on southern Tamriel. Hestra's navy was successful in capturing the infamous pirate-king &lt;a href=\"Red%20Bramman\"&gt;Red Bramman&lt;/a&gt;, providing the first reliable accounts of the interior territories of the mysterious Black Marsh. Hestra was also known to have greatly improved the road system of the Alessian Empire, and possibly creating the &lt;a href=\"Hestra%20Rune%20Stone\"&gt;Hestra Rune Stone&lt;/a&gt;s. Around this time, the Alessians began launching short-lived invasions of the northern territories of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; and possibly the sixteen &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; states of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragon Break.\nWhile Hestra's reign made it appear as though the Alessian Empire was recovering from its decline under the rule of Emperor Gorieus, this prosperity was, unfortunately, not to last. In the year &lt;a href=\"1E%201188\"&gt;1E 1188&lt;/a&gt;, a man by the name of &lt;a href=\"Fervidius%20Tharn\"&gt;Fervidius Tharn&lt;/a&gt; was believed to have been appointed as the Arch-Prelate of the Alessian Order. A rank, that, at the time, rivaled the power of even the Emperor. During his papacy, a threatening ideological schism began to form within the ranks of the Alessian priesthood, surreptitiously wearing away at the doctrinal foundations of the Order. This antithetical movement to the orthodox Alessian Reform, referred to themselves as the Marukhati Selectives. The Marukhati Selectives were extremely fanatical in their dogma, most notably in their vehement belief that the humanoid Akatosh, the Alessian's Supreme-Spirit, was incapable of being the same god as the Elven, &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt;. When it became apparent to the Selectives that they could not prove their thesis through conventional means, they decided to force the universe into accepting it. While Arch-Prelate Tharn is said to have frequently attempted to halt the Selectives' plans, some primary sources seem to imply that these actions may have been done purely to cover the fact that he was secretly the master of the Selectives. In the year &lt;a href=\"1E%201200\"&gt;1E 1200&lt;/a&gt;, seemingly left with no other choice, the Marukhati Selectives purposefully initiated a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt;, later known as the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break%23The%20Middle%20Dawn\"&gt;Middle Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, with the intention of using the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break%23The%20Hurling%20Disk\"&gt;Hurling Disk&lt;/a&gt; to manipulate the universe to their liking. The Middle Dawn would last for what is normally reported to be 1008, timeless, years, finally ending in &lt;a href=\"1E%202208\"&gt;1E 2208&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout the Break, all sorts of strange happenings occurred. While most people were incapable of recalling the events that entailed, the Emperor souls held within the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Diamond\"&gt;Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt; revealed varying accounts of what took place. The Emperor, Shor-El, claimed that the entirety of Cyrodiil morphed into an egg, while Empress Hestra stated that the Alessian Empire spread its reaches across the stars; most other accounts from the Red Diamond are reportedly spoken in an incomprehensible language that is only spoken 'sideways'. Whether or not the Selectives were successful in their goal is unknown. However, if one thing is certain, it is that the Dragon Break crushed a good amount of trust the people held in the Alessian Empire.\nDissolution of the Alessian Empire.\nAs if the Dragon Break weren't enough, in the year &lt;a href=\"1E%202200\"&gt;1E 2200&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt; ravaged Tamriel, eventually killing off, what is normally believed to be, around half of the continent's population. In the year &lt;a href=\"1E%202260\"&gt;1E 2260&lt;/a&gt;, The Alessian Emperor, at the time, assembled the greatest ever coalition of fleets from across Tamriel, known as the &lt;a href=\"All%20Flags%20Navy\"&gt;All Flags Navy&lt;/a&gt;, to invade the source of the plague, the &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt; homeland of &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt;. The fleet was led by Baron-Admiral &lt;a href=\"Bendu%20Olo\"&gt;Bendu Olo&lt;/a&gt;, King of &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;, who was also credited with adding the fleets of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; into the great armada. With Bendu's success over the Sload, the glory of the Colovian West quickly spread across Tamriel, overshadowing that of the traditionally richer and Imperial-tied Nibenay, causing tensions to slowly arise. In the year &lt;a href=\"1E%202305\"&gt;1E 2305&lt;/a&gt;, the apparent excesses of the Alessian Order led to the secession of the Kingdom of High Rock from the Empire. While the Alessians attempted to reestablish control of the region through conquest, and managed to swiftly pass through Hammerfell, their forces failed, being routed at Bangkorai.\nThe War of Righteousness.\nThough the Alessian Reform was at first the driving force of the Empire, by the twenty-fourth century of the First Era it was noticeably becoming a cancerous blight on the Empire's competency. The Alessian Empire's fate was truly sealed once the Alessian Order's influence spread to nearly every Tamrielic religion. Because of this, the Alessian priesthood was spread to thin and infighting quickly began amongst the varying sects of the Order. With the flourishing Colovian West seceding from the Empire in the year &lt;a href=\"1E%202321\"&gt;1E 2321&lt;/a&gt;, it was too late for the Empire to heal its wounds, and its lack of land and money quickly erupted the Alessian Empire into the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Righteousness\"&gt;War of Righteousness&lt;/a&gt;, which would spread as far as the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;, nearly halving its population. Within its ten-year span, the conflict quickly evolved into an all out evangelical war between the myriad sects of the now splintered Alessian faith, with the purging of most Alessian texts and monastic complexes. The war would cause the complete dissolution of the Alessian Empire in &lt;a href=\"1E%202331\"&gt;1E 2331&lt;/a&gt;, and reverted Nibenay back into a mercantile-magocracy form of government. With Nibenay's ministries being far too alien for the Colovian culture, the lands remained split for around 400 years, until the rising of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "5232", "revid": "35838578", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5232", "title": "Alessian Order", "text": "The Alessian Order was a once-popular monotheistic religion created by the prophet &lt;a href=\"Marukh\"&gt;Marukh&lt;/a&gt; in the early &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. By the time of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, the religion had lost almost all of its followers. The Alessians were often said to be very strict, humorless people, and their reign over the Empire is often remembered for its cruelty and follies, sometimes referred to as a \"dark age.\"\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe Order began in the coastal jungles of what is now the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt; after a prophet in the area named &lt;a href=\"Marukh\"&gt;Marukh&lt;/a&gt;, who was believed to have spoken to Saint Alessia, questioned the validity of &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt; ruling over &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt;. The teachings of Marukh began to morph into a belief that there was only one &lt;a href=\"God\"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt;. Despite these beliefs the Alessians knew that in order for their religion to gain wide acceptance, they needed to incorporate elements of the various polytheistic religions that most people worshiped. The divine aspects worshiped by the various humans and &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i were recognizable in the guise of the myriad saints and spirits of the evolving Alessian canon. Despite the Order's focus on \"The One\" as its religious godhead, the Order is often credited with finalizing the pantheon of the modern &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt; church.\nSoon the Alessian Order's teachings spread across all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and its authority rose over every other religion, allowing them to become one of, if not the most powerful group within Tamriel at the time. The Order eventually gained control of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt; in the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20361\"&gt;1E 361&lt;/a&gt; after they performed a successful coup d'\u00e9tat. After they gained control of the Empire the group enforced a strict code of laws named the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Doctrines\"&gt;Alessian Doctrines&lt;/a&gt;, which were highly unsympathetic to elves. The Alessian Order centered its power in the city that &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Saint Alessia&lt;/a&gt; started her rebellion, the city of &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;. The city would remain the center of religious worship in all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; until the fall of the order in &lt;a href=\"1E%202321\"&gt;1E 2321&lt;/a&gt;, when it moved south, to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. The strict laws of the Alessian Doctrines brought with them a strange circumstance of growth in the Nibenay merchant class, causing the region to prosper economically. However, no matter how rich the citizenry became, they were still subservient to the Alessian Order.\nAlessian Doctrines.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Doctrines\"&gt;Alessian Doctrines&lt;/a&gt; were a set of laws created by the prophet &lt;a href=\"Marukh\"&gt;Marukh&lt;/a&gt;. It was believed that the Doctrines were given to him by Saint &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;, when she supposedly visited him and gave him the \"Seventy Seven Inflexable Doctrines\" which stated that death was an illusion and that through \"Ehlnofic Annulment\" and reaching a state of \"Proper-Life,\" one could escape the process of life and death. The Doctrines eventually evolved into a set of religious codes in which the Alessian Order enforced upon the Empire. The Doctrines saw no difference between religious and political matters and taught that resisting the will of the Emperor was equal to resisting the will of the Gods, This way of thinking is reflected by a certain excerpt from the doctrines, \"All are guilty until they have been proven themselves innocent,\" which is still present in the modern Imperial Legal System. However, even the Emperor's power was rivaled by that of the Order's, appointed, Arch-Prelate. The Doctrines were also said to have forbidden \"trafficke with daimons,\" while the term \"daimon\" was never fully specified, it is quite heavily implied that it refers to the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe most infamous part of the Alessian Doctrines was its extreme cruelty directed at elves, most notably the &lt;a href=\"Ayleids\"&gt;Ayleids&lt;/a&gt;, of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Before the doctrines were even enforced, early Alessians were known to sack Ayleid settlements in human controlled territories in the early fourth century of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, such as the Ayleid city of &lt;a href=\"Malada\"&gt;Malada&lt;/a&gt;. Not only did they attack the Elven people but the Order was also responsible for the mass destruction of Elven writings, leading to a scarcity of Elven historical scriptures. When the Doctrines were put into law, all Ayleid nobility was outlawed and their feifdoms were revoked. The anti-Elven laws were so harsh that just about the entire Ayleid population of Cyrodiil left the Empire to escape them, eventually being absorbed into the Elven populations of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt;. It is believed that this mass exodus of Ayleids into neighboring lands may have led to the subsequent rise of the Direnni Hegemony as one of the most powerful nations within Tamriel.\nDecline.\nRislav's Rebellion.\nIt could be argued that the true beginning of the Alessian Order's decline began with the death of the devout Alessian, &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Borgas\"&gt;Borgas&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"1E%20369\"&gt;1E 369&lt;/a&gt;. This heralded the subsequent loss of the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Empire\"&gt;Nordic Empire&lt;/a&gt; and all strong relations between Skyrim and the Alessian Empire. However, the origin of the Alessian Order's decline is normally directed towards the Colovian King, &lt;a href=\"Rislav%20Larich\"&gt;Rislav Larich&lt;/a&gt;, and the rebellion he started in the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20478\"&gt;1E 478&lt;/a&gt;. Though the Alessian Order was quite used to crushing rebellions, the then Emperor, &lt;a href=\"Gorieus\"&gt;Gorieus&lt;/a&gt;, failed to quell the insurrection which would eventually lead to a merging of the entire &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to resist the Empire. Larich's actions inspired many other kings, most notably &lt;a href=\"Ryain%20Direnni\"&gt;Ryain Direnni&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt; to defy the Empire. Ryain began outlawing the Alessian Doctrines and even invading Imperial territories. &lt;a href=\"Hoag%20Merkiller\"&gt;Hoag Merkiller&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, though sharing the Empire's xenophobia, was so opposed to the Alessian Order that he allied with the Direnni Hegemony in its war against the Order. While it appeared that the Order made some progress in the war, they were eventually halted at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Glenumbra%20Moors%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Battle of Glenumbria Moors&lt;/a&gt; where they suffered a crushing defeat that the order would never recover from. Despite this the Order would still survive for almost another 2000 years.\nThe Marukhati Selective.\nA very notable event in the decline of the Alessian Order began with the appointment of &lt;a href=\"Fervidius%20Tharn\"&gt;Fervidius Tharn&lt;/a&gt; to the rank of Arch-Prelate in the year &lt;a href=\"1E%201188\"&gt;1E 1188&lt;/a&gt;. Around this time, the ideals of a clandestine and extremist sect, known as the &lt;a href=\"Marukhati%20Selective\"&gt;Marukhati Selective&lt;/a&gt;, began to quickly spread amongst the ranks of the Alessian priesthood, causing a great schism within the Order. Certain texts imply that while Fervidius openly spearheaded the opposition of the Marukhati movement, he was also, secretly, the true leader of the Selectives. In the year &lt;a href=\"1E%201200\"&gt;1E 1200&lt;/a&gt;, the Marukhati Selective, wrapped up in its fanatical dogma, would bring about the greatest &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break%23Middle%20Dawn\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt; in known history, which would last for what is normally believed to be 1008 years.\nThe War of Righteousness.\nThe Dragon Break drastically altered the Order's image and ability to maintain power within Tamriel. After more than 1000 years as a vassal state of the Alessian Empire, the Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; successfully seceded. The Alessian Order failed to reconquer the territory in &lt;a href=\"1E%202305\"&gt;1E 2305&lt;/a&gt;, substantiating the visible decline in the Order's power.\nWhile many different factors contributed to the Alessian Order's downfall, the longterm factor which indirectly led to the destruction of the Alessian Order ironically began with its own success. The Alessian faith became so widespread that religious dissension began to appear in the order creating schisms that would eventually cause the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Righteousness\"&gt;War of Righteousness&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%202321\"&gt;1E 2321&lt;/a&gt;. The war began with the attempted secession of the entirety of the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt; from the Alessian Empire, eventually spreading as far as the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;, where almost half of the population was said to have perished in direct cause. The war quickly evolved into a fight for the survival of not just the Empire, but the entire Alessian faith, with almost every encountered Alessian text being destroyed or misplaced. Unfortunately for the Alessians, their efforts were in vain, and after ten years of fighting, both the Empire and the Order collapsed, throwing Tamriel into a 400-year state of chaos until the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;next Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nCalendar.\nThe Alessian Order was known to use its own calendar, dating their events from the Apotheosis of &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"1E%20266\"&gt;1E 266&lt;/a&gt;). According to some scholars, the Alessians recorded their years based on the length of the long vision-trances of the Order's High Priestesses, which could last as long as a few weeks or up to a couple of months. Scholars who dismiss the existence of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt; theorize that the Alessian Order, according to the records of their surviving trance-scrolls, was in power for only 150 standard years, contrary to the popularly believed 1008 years recorded in the &lt;a href=\"Encyclopedia%20Tamrielica\"&gt;Encyclopedia Tamrielica&lt;/a&gt;. However, even if the Dragon Break did truly occur, the Encyclopedia Tamrielica is still incorrect on its dating as the famed 1008 years refers more specifically to the duration of the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Dawn\"&gt;Middle Dawn&lt;/a&gt; rather than that of the actual Order. With the existence of the Dragon Break acknowledged, the Order would have been in power for a recorded 1970 years, if it is to be assumed that the Order collapsed at the very end of the ten year War of Righteousness.\nAlessian sects.\nThe following are sects of the Alessian/Marukhati faith or groups that are believed to be, in some way, associated with the Alessian Order.\nThe Holy Brothers of Marukh.\nThe Holy Brothers of Marukh was an early sect of the Alessian Order that was created sometime around the Order's founding. The Brothers of Marukh were responsible for an event known as \"the &lt;a href=\"Cleansing%20of%20the%20Fane\"&gt;Cleansing of the Fane&lt;/a&gt;\" in which the Ayleid temple of Malada was destroyed in order to put an end to the demons who were reportedly centralized in the city, being in someway provoked by a solar eclipse.\nThe Temple of the One.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt; is often associated with the Alessian Order. While the building itself has more recently been associated with the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; held within, and by extension, &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, it is known that the Temple was once the headquarters of a &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic cult by the same name that believed in one deity, much like the Alessian Order. &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; was said to have revived this cult during his reign and was believed to be a devout follower of its teachings.\nThe Temple Zero Society.\nThe Temple Zero Society was a secretive &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; cult said to dabble within the mystery of myth and legend. While the cult was often associated with &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, it was also known to follow the teachings of the prophet &lt;a href=\"Marukh\"&gt;Marukh&lt;/a&gt; and is thus associated with the Alessian Order.\nThe Marukhati Selective.\nPossibly the most infamous of the Alessian Sects, the &lt;a href=\"Marukhati%20Selective\"&gt;Marukhati Selective&lt;/a&gt; was a very secretive cult of fanatical Alessians whose main objective was to remove the elven aspects of &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; from the god &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;. In order to achieve their goal, they created the 1008 year &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Dawn\"&gt;Middle Dawn&lt;/a&gt; Dragon Break, an event that would cause much hatred to be aimed at the group. Despite the apparent disappearance of the group after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Righteousness\"&gt;War of Righteousness&lt;/a&gt;, the cult was known to survive into the far future."}

Led by the Slave-Queen &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nedes\"&gt;Nedes&lt;/a&gt; revolted against the Ayleids in a massive uprising. The rebellion began in the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20242\"&gt;1E 242&lt;/a&gt; and ended a year later in &lt;a href=\"1E%20243\"&gt;1E 243&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Fall%20of%20White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;the fall&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; and the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt; with Alessia becoming the first &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Empress&lt;/a&gt;. Though it was not the first victory of &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt;, it is often considered to be the most influential turning point in the Man-Mer power struggle, marking the point in which Man began to rise to dominance over &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. The Alessian Slave Rebellion is often used as a symbol of the power of men and the consequences of trafficking with &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nPrelude.\nDuring the early years of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, the land that made up present day Cyrodiil was owned by a powerful race of Elves known as the Ayleids. When coming across the scattered Nedic tribes of Tamriel the Ayleids would occasionally enslaved them, but in time, when certain Ayleids began pursuing the creation of an empire, the Nedic people began to be systematically enslaved in large numbers. Though the Nedes would often fight back, their efforts were ultimately futile to stop their widespread enslavement. The Ayleids enslaved every human they came across, most notably those of &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt;, and many of the Ayleids, being &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20worship\"&gt;worshipers&lt;/a&gt;, were horribly cruel to their slaves. Most slaves were used for lifting stones, draining fields, and repairing temples and roads, but other less fortunate slaves were subject to brutal \"art-tortures\" to please their sadistic masters. Some Ayleid holds became known for the cruel ways they would display their torture victims, such as wailing wheels of &lt;a href=\"Vindasel\"&gt;Vindasel&lt;/a&gt; and the gut-gardens of &lt;a href=\"Sercen\"&gt;Sercen&lt;/a&gt;. One particularly cruel monarch, known as the Fire-King &lt;a href=\"Hadhuul\"&gt;Hadhuul&lt;/a&gt;, was known to force slaves to beget psychedelic drugs which gave the user unbearably tormenting visions, as well as set children aflame for sport. The Ayleid's cruel treatment of their slaves undoubtedly played a large role in sparking the subsequent rebellion. Some believe that the Ayleid's worship of Daedra created cultural weaknesses within their societies which played a large part in their eventual downfall. A noticeable decline in Ayleid unity occurred during the &lt;a href=\"Narfinsel\"&gt;Narfinsel&lt;/a&gt; schism, in which the Barsaebic Ayleids were driven out of Cyrodiil by Daedra worshipers\nThe rebellion begins.\nA young Nedic slave named Alessia from an unknown tribe near &lt;a href=\"Sardavar%20Leed\"&gt;Sardavar Leed&lt;/a&gt;, received divine inspiration to rebel against her Ayleid masters while atop the hill in which the city of &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt; would later be founded. While praying to the gods, &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; sent the demi-god, &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt;, to aid Alessia in her plans to free the slaves of Cyrod, and these three individuals would lead the rebellion which would officially begin in the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20242\"&gt;1E 242&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic victories against the &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; of the North inspired many slaves to join Alessia in her rebellion, and large numbers of mercenaries from &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and the then &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt; joined the rebellion with promises of rich lands and trade concessions. One of Alessia's most influential allies were the Ayleid lords from lands where the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; were worshiped, rather than the Daedra. Alessia's slave rebellion grew to large numbers, but it wasn't able to effectively defeat the Ayleid's military might until the armies of the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Empire\"&gt;Nordic Empire&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim intervened. Legend tells, that the Ayleids reliance on hordes of summoned Daedra and &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, was denied to them once Alessia had made her covenant with &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;. According to some, the Ayleids dealings with Daedra created bickering and infighting amongst their people which created exploitable cracks in their societies that the rebellion would take advantage of.\nThe Song of Pelinal.\nThe rebellion's strategy for defeating the Ayleids was rather simple, while Morihaus' and Alessia's armies fought the Ayleid armies in the fields of battle, Pelinal would kill their sorcerer-kings in single combat. One by one, Pelinal slayed the Ayleid lords in their holdings. First he killed &lt;a href=\"Haromir%20of%20Copper%20and%20Tea\"&gt;Haromir of Copper and Tea&lt;/a&gt; and screamed praise to the future Emperor &lt;a href=\"Reman\"&gt;Reman&lt;/a&gt;, a man who no one knew yet. He would later slay &lt;a href=\"Gordhaur%20the%20Shaper\"&gt;Gordhaur the Shaper&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Ninendava\"&gt;Ninendava&lt;/a&gt; and the Fire-King Hadhuul at &lt;a href=\"Ceyatatar\"&gt;Ceyatatar&lt;/a&gt;. In his first spout of madness, which was caused by the death of his friend &lt;a href=\"Huna\"&gt;Huna&lt;/a&gt;, Pelinal wrought complete destruction all the way from &lt;a href=\"Narlemae\"&gt;Narlemae&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Celediil\"&gt;Celediil&lt;/a&gt;. In their fear of Pelinal, the Ayleid kings turned to &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; for help and appointed the demi-god &lt;a href=\"Umaril%20the%20Unfeathered\"&gt;Umaril the Unfeathered&lt;/a&gt; as their champion. Pelinal drove the Ayleid armies past &lt;a href=\"Niben%20River\"&gt;the Niben&lt;/a&gt; and claimed the eastern lands for the Alessian Rebellion. It is even said that Pelinal's advance was so swift, that he accidentally found himself in &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, slaying a profuse amount of &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; before realizing that they were not actually elves. After their losses at &lt;a href=\"Vahtache\"&gt;Vahtache&lt;/a&gt;, and the Bridge of Heldon, as well as the &lt;a href=\"First%20Pogrom\"&gt;First Pogrom&lt;/a&gt;, the Ayleids began retreating back to the White-Gold Tower. While the armies of Alessia, Morihaus, and the Nords were wary of an attack on the Tower, Pelinal thought them cowards and went to conquer the citadel alone. When he entered the Tower, Pelinal killed every Ayleid he came across and challenged Umaril to a duel, defeating him. However, after Pelinal taunted Umaril and the remaining Ayleid kings, the kings were driven into a frenzy and cut him into eights. The next day, Morihaus stormed the White-Gold Tower and hunted down the surviving Ayleid kings who remained. Morihaus found the head of Pelinal which was left by the sorcerer-kings to prove that they had killed him, the two spoke until Pelinal died.\nAftermath.\nAfter the White-Gold Tower was captured in &lt;a href=\"1E%20243\"&gt;1E 243&lt;/a&gt;, Alessia declared herself the first Empress of Cyrodiil and the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt; was formed. The last lands to be liberated by the Alessian army were in the southern territories of Cyrodiil, most notably the lands in which the city of &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; would later be founded. Many Ayleids, fearing the rule of men, fled Cyrodiil and settled in Valenwood. However, contrary to the belief of some, Alessia and her heirs did not punish the remaining Ayleids in any harsh way. The Ayleid lords were still allowed to hold their lands as long as they swore fealty to the Empire and submitted to its laws. Slavery and Daedra worship were outlawed throughout the Empire, and all Ayleids were forced to adopt the new &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt; religion. While many Ayleids felt humiliated by the changes in their way of life, and the lack of slaves hurt their economy, they were not oppressed in any severe manner. It wouldn't be until the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt; gained control of Cyrodiil in &lt;a href=\"1E%20361\"&gt;1E 361&lt;/a&gt; that Ayleids would begin to be abused by the Empire."}

The &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Elder%20Knowledge\"&gt;Elder Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Discerning%20the%20Transmundane\"&gt;Discerning the Transmundane&lt;/a&gt;\" concurrently unfold here. Upon entering the ruins for the first time a team of trapped archaeologists is discovered; the story of their fate, disrupted by a snowstorm and the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; also plays out within.\nThe location has three sublocations, including the Alftand Glacial Ruins, the Alftand Animonculory, and the Alftand Cathedral.\nThere are approximately two-hundred &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Metal%20Ingot\"&gt;ingots&lt;/a&gt; worth of &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20scrap\"&gt;Dwarven scrap&lt;/a&gt; metal, ideal for advancing the &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Smithing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; and earning &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;.\nSublocations.\nAlftand Glacial Ruins.\nUpon entering Alftand, you will find scattered rubble, bedrolls and tools leftover by the expedition members, along with clues of what happened to the expedition itself. Continuing further, you will hear &lt;a href=\"J%27darr\"&gt;J'darr&lt;/a&gt;, one of the workers who survived, arguing with &lt;a href=\"J%27zhar\"&gt;J'zhar&lt;/a&gt;, his brother, about stealing his &lt;a href=\"Skooma%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skooma&lt;/a&gt;. This can be heard when you come close to a crevice boarded up by planks, with barrels and crates behind. Moving on you will find a room containing a stone table that was used to study disabled &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven Spiders&lt;/a&gt;. To the right of the table is a lift to the \"Alftand Animonculory\", but it is sealed off and can only be opened from inside. Beware from this point, as you will begin encountering &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20automaton\"&gt;Dwarven automaton&lt;/a&gt;s coming out of pipes. On your way you will encounter the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; brothers again. This time it will be revealed that J'zhar is actually dead on his bedroll and J'darr has gone insane, most likely due to the abstinence effect of not consuming skooma for so long. He will turn hostile and you will be forced to kill him. Follow down the path, on a raised area with oil spills on the floor, you will be ambushed by two &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Sphere%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven Spheres&lt;/a&gt;. An interesting feature in that room are the three pistons behind a table, that thrust up vertically, that can be used to gain access to a ledge hidden loot. In the next room, there are various Dwemer metal parts along with four Dwarven Spiders; two dead and two hidden in pipes. There is also a &lt;a href=\"forge\"&gt;forge&lt;/a&gt; in the room. Through the door to the next area you will find an unlocked chest behind a pressure plate. To the right is a dead end with a Dwarven Spider and another chest in the rubble. To the west are more enemies along the path to the door to \"Alftand Animonculory\". Be wary of the five horizontally thrusting pistons that can push you off into the ledge below if you\u2019re not careful.\nAlftand Animonculory.\nContinue down the hallway to a set of stairs leading up to an area covered in oil, along with a Dwarven Sphere and a Dwarven Spider. Before climbing up, there is a gap between metal bars underneath the stairs leading to the body of &lt;a href=\"Endrast\"&gt;Endrast&lt;/a&gt; with a Falmer arrow in his shoulder. An adept-locked chest can be found next to him. Past the stairs is a ramp with several pressure plates to the sides. Triggering them will activate the spinning blades that will go down along the in the middle. The path will be blocked, but can be opened by one of the levers. Continuing downwards, you will come across a ledge that you must jump off of. But before doing so, there is a locked door to a room with various loot, including a skill book. Once you jumped down, you will find the body of &lt;a href=\"Yag%20gra-Gortwog\"&gt;Yag gra-Gortwog&lt;/a&gt;, riddled with arrows. That path upwards leads to a dead end with a chest and a Dwarven Spider hiding in a pipe, while the path down leads to several Falmer guarding the path. Past them will lead into a series of rooms filled with Falmer. Various types of loot can be found like ores, ingredients and everything found in chests. A few things of interest are an Alchemy Lab in the first room and a &lt;a href=\"workbench\"&gt;workbench&lt;/a&gt; along with an &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Smithing%29\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; in the other room. In the final room lies the Falmer boss along with 2 more. The room holds an assortment of items scavenged from the expedition members, like Sulla Trebatius's knapsack. &lt;a href=\"Valie\"&gt;Valie&lt;/a&gt;'s body can be found on a table with shackles. Next to her lies a lift that leads back to the Alftand Glacial Ruins. Further down, past a dead Falmer riddled with Iron Arrows, lies the door to \"Alftand Cathedral\". Be careful of the claw trap before the door.\nAlftand Cathedral.\nIn the final area, you will encounter a Falmer guarding the door to your path. Watch out for the three pressure plates on your way. Climb the stairs and you will run into two more Falmer patrolling the area, along with possibly another creature (either a &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frostbite Spider&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skeever&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Chaurus&lt;/a&gt;). The path to the exit is blocked and can only be opened by the lever on a platform at the top of the stairs with two chests next to it. Around the area are several Falmer tents containing various Falmer equipment and ingredients. Past the gate, up the stairs, are two Dwarven Centurions. One dead and the other remains dormant until you approach it. After defeating it, climb the next set of stairs leading up to the lift to outside. Behind some pillars, &lt;a href=\"Umana\"&gt;Umana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sulla%20Trebatius\"&gt;Sulla Trebatius&lt;/a&gt;, the two last expedition members, will show themselves. Umana tries to convince Sulla to abort the expedition, but Sulla refuses to give up. At this point both will become hostile to each other and to you, so you can either kill them both or stay hidden and let them fight out until one stands victorious and then kill the winner. In the center of this area is a Dwarven mechanism, that can be opened with an &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20Sphere\"&gt;Attunement Sphere&lt;/a&gt;, to gain access to &lt;a href=\"Blackreach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt;. The exit is behind a master-locked gate that can either be picklocked or unlocked with the Alftand Lift Key that can be found on the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Centurion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven Centurion&lt;/a&gt; you fought earlier. The lift will take you outside to a gatehouse that could only be opened from the inside.\nAlftand Ruined Tower.\nUpon entering, there will be a shelf holding some &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Arrow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven arrows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Scrap\"&gt;metals&lt;/a&gt;. Beside the shelf is a spiral staircase leading down, deeper into the tower. At the end of the staircase one Dwarven Spider Worker will spawn out of the wall directly in front of the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; and another one behind more shelves. There are several &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ingot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"silver%20ore\"&gt;silver ore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Ingot\"&gt;ingots&lt;/a&gt; scattered throughout the room and more dwarven metal. Proceeding further shows two buttons against a wall. Pressing them will activate ceiling spike traps on the other side of the wall for purposes unknown. One will eventually arrive at the spike trap's location but first encounter a Dwarven Sphere.\nThe spike traps can also be activated by pressure plates directly below them. Beyond the traps is a door and a button before it. Pressing the button is the only way to open the door as there is no option to open or unlock it. Doing so will activate a relatively harmless fire trap. Sprinting or rolling can allow one to avoid taking any damage at all. Then, in front of the Dragonborn will be a desk with another button that, if pressed, will close the door and disable the trap. Going further will lead to a small ice cave where two final Dwarven Spider Workers will spawn. At the end of the cave will be a door exiting far under the wooden bridges leading to Alftand.\nThe Ruined Tower is an ideal source of Dwarven scrap to smelt into &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20metal%20ingot\"&gt;Dwarven metal ingot&lt;/a&gt;s. The following is an approximate amount of the Dwarven scrap, not accounting for the &lt;a href=\"Random%20Loot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;random loot&lt;/a&gt; found within &lt;a href=\"Animunculi\"&gt;Animunculi&lt;/a&gt;:\nFor an approximate total of a possible 88 Dwemer metal ingots.\nThere is an exit at the top of the tower, but the ruin does not connect with the other Alftand sections.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Technology\"&gt;Ancient Technology&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Sorine%20Jurard\"&gt;Sorine Jurard&lt;/a&gt; will explain that she has located a schematic that can provide a new upgrade or ammunition type for the &lt;a href=\"Crossbows%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;. She asks the Dragonborn to retrieve it from a radiant location, typically a &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwemer Ruin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt; stronghold, but the chosen location can also be on &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; if is installed.\n&lt;a href=\"Discerning%20the%20Transmundane\"&gt;Discerning the Transmundane&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn met Septimus Signus, a brilliant but mad scholar living in the northern ice fields. They are then directed to a Dwarven observatory that supposedly houses an Elder Scroll. Septimus doesn't care about the Scroll itself, but wants the Dragonborn to use some kind of machine there to inscribe a Dwarven lexicon with the Scroll's knowledge and bring it to him.\n&lt;a href=\"Elder%20Knowledge\"&gt;Elder Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn must venture into the ruins of Alftand in order to find out what happened to a group of archaeologists that went exploring in the ruins. The Dragonborn finds various clues along the way as to what happened to them, including finding two Khajiit brothers, &lt;a href=\"J%27darr\"&gt;one alive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"J%27zhar\"&gt;one dead&lt;/a&gt;, as well as other dead members of the expedition in various other places."}

{"id": "6219", "revid": "4984687", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6219", "title": "Alik'r Desert", "text": "The Alik'r Desert, Alik'r, or Alik'ra is an endless sea of desert that stretches across the northwestern part of the province of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. The sands of the Alik'r stretch as far as the eye can see, encompassing much of the western inland, and housing several civilizations, from the &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, to even the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;. The Alik'r is bordered by the swamps of &lt;a href=\"Tigonus\"&gt;Tigonus&lt;/a&gt; and coastal wetlands to the north, the wooded &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to the east, and the fertile fields near &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt; to the south, reaching its maximum extent at the &lt;a href=\"Irk%20River\"&gt;Irk River&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nHollow Wastes.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Wastes\"&gt;Hollow Wastes&lt;/a&gt; is a stretch of land situated in the center of the Alik'r, bridged between the cities of &lt;a href=\"Bergama\"&gt;Bergama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lainlyn\"&gt;Lainlyn&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are the largest settlements in the region. Much of the Hollow Wastes is desolate, with very little between each city. The outpost of &lt;a href=\"Leki%27s%20Blade\"&gt;Leki's Blade&lt;/a&gt; is found in the wastes, and it is a school, being one of the very last places that teach the ways of &lt;a href=\"Sword-Singers\"&gt;Sword-Singing&lt;/a&gt;. Near the town of Lainlyn is the &lt;a href=\"Aswala%20Stables\"&gt;Aswala Stables&lt;/a&gt;, which is well-known for breeding the &lt;a href=\"Yokudan%20Chargers\"&gt;Yokudan Chargers&lt;/a&gt;, a breed of &lt;a href=\"Horse\"&gt;Horse&lt;/a&gt; that originates from &lt;a href=\"Akos%20Kasaz\"&gt;Akos Kasaz&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Lainlyn%20Family\"&gt;Lainlyn Family&lt;/a&gt; has a large presence in the region, as they are the namesake for the Barony of Lainlyn.\nMyrkwasa.\n&lt;a href=\"Myrkwasa\"&gt;Myrkwasa&lt;/a&gt; is the center of the Alik'r population, situated along the northwest coast of the province, where the capital city of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; is located. The coast is more fertile than deeper towards Bergama, where the desert begins in Myrkwasa. Pomegranates and Figs are grown in vineyards around Sentinel. South of the city lies the &lt;a href=\"Rain%20Catcher%20Fields\"&gt;Rain Catcher Fields&lt;/a&gt;, which is self-explanatory, it catches the seasonal rains that flow past through the region, and makes it safe to drink for the locals, and preparing for trading. The ruined city of &lt;a href=\"Salas%20En\"&gt;Salas En&lt;/a&gt; was a major city in the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;i occupation of Hammerfell, until they were taken out by the Yokudans of &lt;a href=\"Yath\"&gt;Yath&lt;/a&gt;.\nTigonus.\nThe region of &lt;a href=\"Tigonus\"&gt;Tigonus&lt;/a&gt; is the eastern front of the Alik'r, found along the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt; that border towards the region of &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;. The two main cities in the region are &lt;a href=\"Kozanset\"&gt;Kozanset&lt;/a&gt;, an open-aired trading town, and the holy city of &lt;a href=\"Satakalaam\"&gt;Satakalaam&lt;/a&gt;, named after the Yokudan God, &lt;a href=\"Satakal\"&gt;Satakal&lt;/a&gt;. Tigonus contains several notable landmarks, such as the city of &lt;a href=\"Volenfell\"&gt;Volenfell&lt;/a&gt;, the lost capital of the Rourken Dwemer. The &lt;a href=\"Lost%20City%20of%20the%20Na-Totambu\"&gt;Lost City of the Na-Totambu&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient city of the Na-Totambu that fell into obscurity, and the &lt;a href=\"Motalion%20Necropolis\"&gt;Motalion Necropolis&lt;/a&gt;, the largest cemetery in the Alik'r Desert, built just north of Satakalaam. Various Kings and nobles of the Alik'r Desert are buried here, throughout the years, such as &lt;a href=\"King%20Haqmir\"&gt;King Haqmir&lt;/a&gt; of Yath.\nGreater Alik'r.\nThe Greater Alik'r refers to the desert of Hammerfell, which shares its name with the general region of Northern Hammerfell. This area encompasses the western-half of Hammerfell, where much of the province's greatest history had occurred, such as the Arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20of%20Hammerfell\"&gt;Conquest of Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. The ancient capital of the &lt;a href=\"Rourken%20Clan\"&gt;Rourken Clan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, the city of &lt;a href=\"Volenfell\"&gt;Volenfell&lt;/a&gt; is located here, with sources claiming its location around &lt;a href=\"Satakalaam\"&gt;Satakalaam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gilane\"&gt;Gilane&lt;/a&gt;, two settlements separated by the expansive Alik'r. Various nomads in Hammerfell traverse the Greater Alik'r, between the coastal cities. Nomadic groups like the &lt;a href=\"Ash%27abah\"&gt;Ash'abah&lt;/a&gt; are considered outcasts in Redguard society. On such tread across the Alik'r, the &lt;a href=\"March%20of%20Thirst\"&gt;March of Thirst&lt;/a&gt; was noteworthy in the history of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nFauna.\nDunerippers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Duneripper\"&gt;Duneripper&lt;/a&gt; is a common predator in the Greater Alik'r of Hammerfell. These creatures are known for burrowing through the sand in great speeds, can be considered a sand crocodile. Dunerippers are long reptiles covered in red and light yellow chitin scales, their hard-shell fins give them the ability to swim through the sand and break rocks. They have hooked mouths and wide gullets for their prey. Their digestion is suited for the barren Alik'r, as they require only a small bit of a huge beast (i.e. an &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt;). Their hooked mouths are used to incapacitate their prey, but should that not work, they would clamp them in their jaws until they suffocated it to death. Dunerippers are incredibly long, long enough for three horses, this would include their sharp tails. The Duneripper is commonly compared to aquatic creatures like sharks and sea-drakes. But Dunerippers master the art of patience, waiting for days underneath the sand for prey to wander into their vicinity. Dunerippers in the Alik'r Desert are found all throughout the Alik'r Desert but can be primarily found in larger open areas of the desert, in southeast Myrkwasa near Bergama and in the central area of the Hollow Wastes near Leki's Blade.\nHarpies.\nOne of the most common creatures of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"Harpy\"&gt;Harpy&lt;/a&gt;, and even though they would typically appear in areas such as &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;, the Harpies have a cultural presence in the Alik'r Desert, particularly in the Hollow Wastes in the Barony of Lainlyn. Harpies can be seen as a combination as both a small woman and a ravaging vulture, they live clusters of their own aeries between the sands of Lainlyn to the bluffs of &lt;a href=\"Tigonus\"&gt;Tigonus&lt;/a&gt;. Harpies have sharp-curved talons they used to grab people away. Their feathers, however, are actually very valuable, which makes them hunted throughout the region. The minor city of &lt;a href=\"Kozanset\"&gt;Kozanset&lt;/a&gt; has shown to have cared for their neighboring Harpies. The Barony of Lainlyn celebrates the holiday known as &lt;a href=\"Riglametha\"&gt;Riglametha&lt;/a&gt;, which either means \"The Crows Who Were Punished\", or \"The Crows Who Punish\" in &lt;a href=\"Yoku\"&gt;Banthan-Yoku&lt;/a&gt;. It is a series of festivals set in Lainlyn but there is one, in particular, the Ghraewaj, is an ancient story where the evil temptress, &lt;a href=\"Noctyr-a\"&gt;Noctyr-a&lt;/a&gt; attempts to seduce the Baron of Lainlyn, until the Baroness had intervened and tricked Noctyr-a into wearing white robe, which turned her into a giant black bird. The Baron then tricked Noctyr-a's followers into devouring the bird, only for them to turn into Harpies. This story is ancient, with a revision during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Viana%20the%20Pure\"&gt;Viana the Pure&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkeletons &amp; mummies.\n&lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt; has been a severe subject in Hammerfell, for the province's culture dictates that a body is a holy chalice, and should never be desecrated. This policy had the potential to led to the downfall of the Kingdom of Sentinel, as seen with the &lt;a href=\"Withered%20Hand\"&gt;Withered Hand&lt;/a&gt;. And so &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; thralls are common in areas of the Alik'r Desert, particularly in the region of Tigonus, where both the &lt;a href=\"Motalion%20Necropolis\"&gt;Motalion Necropolis&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20the%20Dishonored\"&gt;Tears of the Dishonored&lt;/a&gt; are located. The process of creating skeletal thralls is very tedious as it requires every single bone to wholly-build back a skeleton. The &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; needed to rebuild a skeleton may hold it together, but it is vital to use extra means to bring it all together, and so, leather straps and even metal spikes are used in this process. But while skeletons are used, some necromancers, primarily those in Redguard and even &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; tombs resurrect &lt;a href=\"mummies\"&gt;mummies&lt;/a&gt;. An equivalent to a mummy would be a &lt;a href=\"Draugr\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, as both are preserved corpses. Mummies, underneath the wrappings, are zombified but do not need extra precautions like with skeletons to have support. Mummies are common resurrections in Hammerfell. The process of mummification is used on the nobility of Hammerfell, and it is done when the soul has left for &lt;a href=\"Tu%27whacca\"&gt;Tu'whacca&lt;/a&gt;, the Redguard God of Souls. The body is left on a table and bathed in oils and leaves. The blood is drained from the body and vital organs like the heart and brain are kept in ceremonial jars. After weeks of religious prayers, the body is kept into a sarcophagus in a subterranean cave, where they are kept with their memorabilia.\nCamels &amp; Horses.\nTraversing the Alik'r Desert is a challenge on its own, where many are unable to withstand. Because of this, the province's kingdoms all reside beyond the Greater Alik'r, either along the coast (Sentinel and &lt;a href=\"Gilane\"&gt;Gilane&lt;/a&gt;), or the mountains (&lt;a href=\"Ska%27vyn\"&gt;Ska'vyn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar\"&gt;Dragonstar&lt;/a&gt;). But because of Hammerfell's lack of riverways, moving through the Alik'r is the best option for travel. What the Alik'ri nomads use are &lt;a href=\"Camel\"&gt;Camel&lt;/a&gt;s, large animals who have gotten accustomed to the harsh weather and can support tons of weight on their distinct humps. They are a cultural icon of the desert for their versatility and practicality. Wild Camels are found in small pacts in certain areas, more so in the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt; than in the Alik'r Desert, but in the latter, a Camel can be found in an oasis, where water can be supplied. While Camels are used throughout the province, the Alik'r Desert is unique in that &lt;a href=\"Horse\"&gt;Horse&lt;/a&gt;s can be used to cross the desert. Even though these creatures are not suited for the sand, a breed of Horse called the &lt;a href=\"Yokudan%20Charger\"&gt;Yokudan Charger&lt;/a&gt; come from the Alik'r, specifically from the town of &lt;a href=\"Aswala%20Stables\"&gt;Aswala Stables&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Aswala%20Family\"&gt;Aswala Family&lt;/a&gt; is known for breeding these Horses, originally brought from &lt;a href=\"Akos%20Kasaz\"&gt;Akos Kasaz&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Grandee%20Yaghoub\"&gt;Grandee Yaghoub&lt;/a&gt;. The modern-day line of Yokudan Chargers comes from the mount of the legendary, &lt;a href=\"Divad%20Hunding\"&gt;Divad Hunding&lt;/a&gt;. A Yokudan Charger has no problem moving across the desert, and so they are used by the &lt;a href=\"Gallants%20of%20Hammerfell\"&gt;Gallants of Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, a knightly order of the Alik'r.\nDesert Lamia.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Lamia\"&gt;Lamia&lt;/a&gt; are peculiar creatures in the Iliac Bay. They are a type of aquatic &lt;a href=\"beastfolk\"&gt;beastfolk&lt;/a&gt; that lives in clusters throughout the coast. The ones in the Alik'r Desert live exclusively in the Fiefdom of Myrkwasa, in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Ancestor%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Ancestor's Landing&lt;/a&gt;. Lamias are highly intelligent creatures, capable of learning &lt;a href=\"Tamrielic\"&gt;Tamrielic&lt;/a&gt;, as well as utilize powerful magic and even adorn exquisite jewelry. Sects of the Lamia are even capable of establishing a religion, worshipping figures known as the \"Egg Mother\" and the \"Great Egg.\" Lamia lair is a very fortunate place to locate, as they care for trinkets they found throughout the desert. The Lamia is actually asexual, neither a man nor female. They take on the appearance of a female to lure none-the-wiser men to their lair. The Lamia have their hierarchy, similar to that of a Harpy. A Lamia Curare has the ability to summon a spectral version of themselves, a Lamia Medica has the ability to use &lt;a href=\"Restoration\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt;, while a Lamia Diva is considered the leader. To those who are less likely to learn, they see the Lamia as cursed people, however, they are in fact a separate race of beastfolk, being as tall as a fully-grown Breton Male, and using their tail to tread across the sand. But because of their sharp venomous fangs, their ophidian heads, and their scaled tails, many try their best to avoid them. In many ways, the Lamia is actually tribal, despite not capable of living with the common-folk of Tamriel, they have shown signs of language, both Tamrielic and their own. Not to mention their recognition for memorabilia, like gold and silver.\nFlora.\nDespite the nature of the Alik'r Desert, the flora in the region is abundant. Of the most common is the &lt;a href=\"Aloe%20Vera\"&gt;Aloe Vera&lt;/a&gt;, which is a popular herb used by the Alik'ri. The Aloe Vera had been used since the time of the Ra Gada, as it is used in their panacea, which is made from the Aloe, mixed with crushed leaves and pure water. It has the ability to staunch the flow of blood and weaken the effects of pox. Among the Aloe is &lt;a href=\"Basil%20%28Plant%29\"&gt;Basil&lt;/a&gt;, an herb that is used around the nose, but it is required to have straws in the nose. It can also be used as a poultice in the same area. All the while, the Redguards of Hammerfell eat all sorts of fruit and vegetables. The most prominent is the Pomegranate and Fig, both of which are a staple in Sentinel, as it is incorporated into &lt;a href=\"Koomu%20Alezer%27i\"&gt;Koomu Alezer'i&lt;/a&gt;. The city-state of Satakalaam also have groves of Pomegranates and Figs, and it is where Bees would pollinate.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ginkgo%20Leaf\"&gt;Ginkgo Leaves&lt;/a&gt; are primarily found along rivers and lakes of Hammerfell, around the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt; in eastern Hammerfell. It is very inconspicuous, on identifiable from the half-moon shape. It is very sweet and tasty, and according to legend, should it be mixed with Aloe Vera, your stamina increases for a time. The Ash'abah Tribe has an initiation where those who drink a certain potion, they are taken into a vision of the past, the founding of the Ancient Ash'abah during King Xahkwan's attack on the Corelanya Clan. The ingredients needed are found throughout southern Myrkwasa. Cave Palm is found underneath the shade, hence the name. The fruit that grows on the tree is known for its distinct smell. The Satakal's Blossom, named after the deity, is a rather rare flower, and it is very hallucinogenic, so for good times. Then there is Juniper Trees, whose berries are common throughout the north, in areas such as &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; in Skyrim. Finally, there is the Torturer's Pillow, a common type of cactus in the Alik'r.\nGovernment.\nThe Alik'r Desert takes a large portion of the province of Hammerfell, and so various settlements exist across the red dunes of Alik'ra, but like the rest of the province, the Alik'r Desert is governed by two factions, &lt;a href=\"the%20Crowns\"&gt;the Crowns&lt;/a&gt;, who revere their culture of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"the%20Forebears\"&gt;the Forebears&lt;/a&gt;, who favor the Imperial law and progression. There is the third party, &lt;a href=\"the%20Lhotunics\"&gt;the Lhotunics&lt;/a&gt;, but their prominence does not equate to the other two. The Kingdom of Sentinel is governed by the Forebears, ever since &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Volag\"&gt;Baron Volag&lt;/a&gt;'s ascension to the throne in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20of%20Hammerfell\"&gt;Conquest of Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. However, a majority of the Iliac-Hammerfell is affiliated with the Crowns, with examples including &lt;a href=\"Lainlyn\"&gt;Lainlyn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Totambu\"&gt;Totambu&lt;/a&gt;. Traditionally, the Crowns ruled the northern reaches of Hammerfell, around the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt; while the Forebears ruled the south along the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Coast\"&gt;Abecean Coast&lt;/a&gt;. Sentinel sticks out amidst the Crowns of the Iliac Bay. But when the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; occurred in &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt;, the political climate had changed drastically. The original forty-four states of the Iliac Bay went down into four distinct kingdoms, among them was the Kingdom of Sentinel. Sentinel had garnered control over the Iliac-Hammerfell, as far as, the &lt;a href=\"Barony%20of%20Abibon-Gora\"&gt;Barony of Abibon-Gora&lt;/a&gt;, to the outskirts of the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Mournoth\"&gt;Fiefdom of Mournoth&lt;/a&gt;. But because much of this is Crowns affiliated, it proved to be a struggle for the newly-appointed King of Sentinel, &lt;a href=\"Lhotun\"&gt;Lhotun&lt;/a&gt;. To combat these political conflicts, King Lhotun created the Lhotunics, which serves as a gray area between the two groups. This political triad was monumental in the late years of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;. Like other nations in the Iliac Bay, the Kingdom of Sentinel has a knightly order, one that protects the royal family and the denizens of the kingdom. Sentinel's order was known as the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Candle\"&gt;Order of the Candle&lt;/a&gt;. The district of the Alik'r has no known political affiliation, but it has a capital, the city of &lt;a href=\"Alik%27ra\"&gt;Alik'ra&lt;/a&gt;, though it has no known leader.\nReligion.\nThe Alik'r Desert is unconquered territory, despite the presence of Alik'ra, it is no-man's land, but with the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; in Hammerfell, the region of Alik'r is forced to have a temple dedicated to one of them, that being &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; the Steadfast, the God of Compassion and Justice, he is the patron of authority, specifically, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Stendarr has a significance in the general Iliac Bay, having prominence in the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Santaki\"&gt;County of Santaki&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Mournoth\"&gt;Fiefdom of Mournoth&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are found east of Sentinel. The &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Temple of Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; is the religious group of Stendarr, who have an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Benevolence%20of%20Mara\"&gt;Benevolence of Mara&lt;/a&gt;. The knightly order of the Temple is the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders\"&gt;Crusaders&lt;/a&gt;, who enforce the will of Stendarr and staunch out their enemies, notably the &lt;a href=\"Citadel%20of%20Ebonarm\"&gt;Citadel of Ebonarm&lt;/a&gt;, a group affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; that worships the Redguard God of War, &lt;a href=\"Ebonarm\"&gt;Ebonarm&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Northern Alik'r hosts various nations, each of whom has their own religious deity given to them. The Kingdom of Sentinel has the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Arkay\"&gt;Order of Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, who reveres the God of Life and Death, &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;. Arkay has other chapters in the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ilessan%20Hills\"&gt;Ilessan Hills&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;. Other temples that exist in the Alik'r Desert, including &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; (Bergama), &lt;a href=\"Julianos\"&gt;Julianos&lt;/a&gt; (Lainlyn, Satakalaam), &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt; (Kozanset, Myrkwasa), and &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt; (Tigonus).\nCulture &amp; economy.\nThe Alik'r Desert takes a large portion of the province of Hammerfell, not just the northern coast, and so traversing it has become a constant challenge, a culture of its own. The uncharted Alik'r stretches as far as the &lt;a href=\"Barony%20of%20Abibon-Gora\"&gt;Barony of Abibon-Gora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kairou\"&gt;Kairou&lt;/a&gt; in the west, to the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Santaki\"&gt;County of Santaki&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dak%27fron%20Desert\"&gt;Dak'fron Desert&lt;/a&gt;. The boundaries between these nations is uncertain, despite detailed maps. There have been various records that a \"Red Mist\" shrouds over the Alik'r Desert, which stays throughout the land until noon when buried temples are unveiled. Alik'r Shade Temples exist throughout the region. Redguards are warriors by nature and are said to be in a constant \"Holy War\" with the Alik'r Desert. Alik'r Warriors wear typical desert gear, such as turbans. Most headwear covers the face to avoid painful burns and desert winds to breath better. Most of the Alik'r is found along the Iliac Bay, via Sentinel and &lt;a href=\"Lainlyn\"&gt;Lainlyn&lt;/a&gt;. The former has minor agriculture, producing figs and pomegranates along the coast while the latter has an affinity with shipbuilding, being a royal port of Sentinel. Beyond Sentinel is the &lt;a href=\"Rain%20Catcher%20Fields\"&gt;Rain Catcher Fields&lt;/a&gt;, which catches the seasonal rains and prepares them for distribution. Among this is several goat hoarders and the stablemasters of the &lt;a href=\"Aswala%20Stables\"&gt;Aswala Stables&lt;/a&gt;. The Alik'r nomads revere &lt;a href=\"Satakal\"&gt;Satakal&lt;/a&gt;, the Yokudan God of Everything, a fusion of the concept of both &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt;. Worship of Satakal is unwanted in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;, as there have been times where the latter denounced it. The Alik'r hosts several settlements such as &lt;a href=\"Ceranda-Kom\"&gt;Ceranda-Kom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tsetissiara\"&gt;Tsetissiara&lt;/a&gt;, including the largest settlement, the city of &lt;a href=\"Alik%27ra\"&gt;Alik'ra&lt;/a&gt;. And so, several holidays are celebrated in the Alik'r Desert. Among them is &lt;a href=\"Festival%20of%20Blades\"&gt;Festival of Blades&lt;/a&gt;, held on the 26th of &lt;a href=\"First%20Seed\"&gt;First Seed&lt;/a&gt;, which celebrates &lt;a href=\"Frandar%20Hunding\"&gt;Frandar Hunding&lt;/a&gt;'s purge against the &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Giant Goblins&lt;/a&gt;. Another is &lt;a href=\"Baranth%20Do\"&gt;Baranth Do&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Yoku\"&gt;Yoku&lt;/a&gt;: \"Goodbye to the Beast of Last Year\"), held on the 18th of &lt;a href=\"Evening%20Star\"&gt;Evening Star&lt;/a&gt;. A Redguard variant of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Life%20Festival\"&gt;New Life Festival&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Rourken Clan of Dwemer; Volendrung &amp; Volenfell.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%20420\"&gt;1E 420&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;First Council&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; was formed between the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;, bring peace throughout the region, but while most were in favor of this, there were sects that were against this decision, and one of them was the &lt;a href=\"Rourken%20Clan\"&gt;Rourken Clan&lt;/a&gt;. The Rourken Chieftain had thrown his Hammer of Might, &lt;a href=\"Volendrung\"&gt;Volendrung&lt;/a&gt; in the distant west, where it would land somewhere in the Alik'r Desert. The Rourken Clan trudged through &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;'s forest and into Hammerfell, where they founded the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Volenfell\"&gt;Volenfell&lt;/a&gt;. The history regarding the Rourken is dispersed and not concise. At one point in time, the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shalidor\"&gt;Shalidor&lt;/a&gt; waged war single-handedly with the Rourken Clan in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Rourken-Shalidor\"&gt;Battle of Rourken-Shalidor&lt;/a&gt;. King Rourken had utilized the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Breaker\"&gt;Spell Breaker&lt;/a&gt;, which is a Dwemer Tower Shield that can deflect magic. When they had founded Volenfell, they discovered large veins of untapped minerals all throughout the Alik'r Desert, to which they traveled great lengths to obtain this power. And so, they built various mining settlements, such as &lt;a href=\"Santaki\"&gt;Santaki&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Rkulftzel\"&gt;Rkulftzel&lt;/a&gt;. The Rourken's self-exile had inspired various other clans to migrate out of Vvardenfell, such as the &lt;a href=\"Kragen%20Clan\"&gt;Kragen Clan&lt;/a&gt;, who founded the cities of &lt;a href=\"Arkngthamz-Phng\"&gt;Arkngthamz-Phng&lt;/a&gt;, and pioneered the use of &lt;a href=\"Aetherium\"&gt;Aetherium&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, the Rourken Clan, along with the rest of the Dwemer, disappeared in &lt;a href=\"1E%20700\"&gt;1E 700&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. Their ruins remained abandoned ever since.\nThe Destruction of Yokuda &amp; the Ra Gada Wave.\nThe distant west, far beyond the continent of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; lies the continent of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;, the home of the &lt;a href=\"Yokudan\"&gt;Yokudan&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Sinistral%20Elves\"&gt;Sinistral Elves&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20808\"&gt;1E 808&lt;/a&gt;, after the destruction of Yokuda, the Yokudans had landed on the shores of modern-day Hammerfell, where they founded the ancient city of &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt;. Various refugees took residence on the island of &lt;a href=\"Herne%20%28Island%29\"&gt;Herne&lt;/a&gt;, while the Warrior Wave, otherwise known as the &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt; continued for Hammerfell. And so began the Ra Gada's conquest over Hammerfell, with various waves moving across the land and displacing the denizens, from the &lt;a href=\"Nedes\"&gt;Nedes&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Beastfolk\"&gt;Beastfolk&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;. Years prior, &lt;a href=\"Frandar%20Hunding\"&gt;Frandar Hunding&lt;/a&gt; had left Yokuda for the province of Hammerfell, where they defeated the &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Giant Goblins&lt;/a&gt;. The Ra Gada consisted of several waves, each of which spread across Hammerfell. The &lt;a href=\"Tavan\"&gt;Tavan&lt;/a&gt; traveled along the southern coast, around cities such as &lt;a href=\"Gilane\"&gt;Gilane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taneth\"&gt;Taneth&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href=\"Anka-Ra\"&gt;Anka-Ra&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the far north, around modern-day &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar\"&gt;Dragonstar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elinhir\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt;. The Warrior Wave around the Alik'r Desert was administrated by &lt;a href=\"Grandee%20Yaghoub\"&gt;Grandee Yaghoub&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Akos%20Kasaz\"&gt;Akos Kasaz&lt;/a&gt;, who founded the cities of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tava%27s%20Blessing\"&gt;Tava's Blessing&lt;/a&gt;. Among his fleet, he carried the &lt;a href=\"Yokudan%20Chargers\"&gt;Yokudan Chargers&lt;/a&gt;, a breed of Horse that can tread across the Desert.\nYaghoub the Seafarer &amp; the Jewel of Alik'r.\nThe city-state of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, like many other modern-day Redguard cities, was founded during the Ra Gada wave, with this one, specifically, found in Yaghoub's wave across the Iliac Bay. &lt;a href=\"Grandee%20Yaghoub\"&gt;Grandee Yaghoub&lt;/a&gt; was a leader from the Yokudan region of &lt;a href=\"Akos%20Kasaz\"&gt;Akos Kasaz&lt;/a&gt;, the largest island of the continent. Yaghoub's fleets traveled from Old Hegathe, through &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Shira\"&gt;Cape Shira&lt;/a&gt; and eventually the Iliac Bay, to which he described it as laudable, applauding its excellence. At this point in time, the &lt;a href=\"High%20Elves\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt; that hailed from the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, along with several &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; groups, took refuge along the coast of the Alik'r. The site of the eventual Sentinel was a harbor-town of Elves and Manmer. As Yaghoub sailed toward &lt;a href=\"the%20Steed\"&gt;the Steed&lt;/a&gt;, on the eve of the 17th of &lt;a href=\"Second%20Seed\"&gt;Second Seed&lt;/a&gt;, his watchmen, or his \"Sentinel\" spotted the harborage, to which Yaghoub declared as their own. The fertile shores of Sentinel had fields of pomegranates, figs, and olives, to which Yaghoub's warriors feasted on. The Ra Gada had &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;enslaved&lt;/a&gt; the Elves, and commissioned the construction of &lt;a href=\"Samuruik\"&gt;Samuruik&lt;/a&gt;, commonly known as Castle Sentinel. As time went on, modern-day Sentinel was fully built, with &lt;a href=\"the%20Forebears\"&gt;the Forebears&lt;/a&gt; building up this glorious city. &lt;a href=\"The%20Crowns\"&gt;The Crowns&lt;/a&gt; soon followed into Sentinel. The gates of Sentinel was built in a way where the Moon would be perched over it. This inspired Sentinel's current banner, which is a Crescent Moon. The 17th of Second Seed had become &lt;a href=\"Koomu%20Alezer%27i\"&gt;Koomu Alezer'i&lt;/a&gt;, which celebrates Sentinel's founding. Grandee Yaghoub continued as the King of Sentinel, and his wave moved across into the rest of the Alik'r.\nThe Corelanya Clan &amp; Origins of the Ash'abah.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Corelanya%20Clan\"&gt;Corelanya Clan&lt;/a&gt; of High Elves were relatively recent arrivals to the &lt;a href=\"Deathlands\"&gt;Deathlands&lt;/a&gt;, and were well-known for being &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;-worshippers, arriving sometime around the sixth century of the First Era, which is long before the Yokudans left for Hammerfell, and before the reign of &lt;a href=\"Mansel%20Sesnit\"&gt;Mansel Sesnit&lt;/a&gt; on Yokuda. The Corelanya Clan were situated in the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Salas%20En\"&gt;Salas En&lt;/a&gt;, found on the western point of modern-day &lt;a href=\"Myrkwasa\"&gt;Myrkwasa&lt;/a&gt;, expanding on a site that was originally occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Ayleids\"&gt;Ayleids&lt;/a&gt;. Amidst the First Era, the Yokudan Ra Gada from &lt;a href=\"Yath\"&gt;Yath&lt;/a&gt; had landed on the shores of the &lt;a href=\"Ash%27abah%20Pass\"&gt;Ash'abah Pass&lt;/a&gt;, where they waged war with the Corelanya Clan. &lt;a href=\"King%20Xakhwan\"&gt;King Xakhwan&lt;/a&gt; led his invasion from the pass, where his son, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Sameer\"&gt;Prince Sameer&lt;/a&gt; was able to defeat the leader of the Corelanya, &lt;a href=\"Kinlady%20Iniel\"&gt;Kinlady Iniel&lt;/a&gt;. The High Elves of Hammerfell were known to practice &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;, which proved to be a key issue in the modern-day province today, and even the entire continent. At the battle, Xakhwan was killed by &lt;a href=\"Wraithmaster%20Venerien\"&gt;Wraithmaster Venerien&lt;/a&gt;, who turned him into a &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;. Xakhwan's sons, Sameer and Haqmir were put into a serious situation, where one of them must kill their father's resurrected corpse, but breaking their sacred tradition. It is unknown who killed the Venerien and Xakhwan, but in the end, both were killed, and the perpetrator was banished. Those who followed the denounced prince would become the &lt;a href=\"Ash%27abah\"&gt;Ash'abah&lt;/a&gt;, Alik'r nomads that would kill the undead, despite the tradition. Regardless, the other brother was made into a king, and was later buried at the &lt;a href=\"Motalion%20Necropolis\"&gt;Motalion Necropolis&lt;/a&gt;. Salas En would become occupied by the Yath Redguards until the 23rd century, around when the &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt; moved through the Iliac.\nGaiden Shinji &amp; the Siege of Orsinium.\nFor quite some time, the flourishing &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Kingdom of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, deep in the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt; had proved themselves to be a formidable force, much to the dismay of the &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; of High Rock, specifically, &lt;a href=\"King%20Joile\"&gt;King Joile&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;. Orcish raiders of both the &lt;a href=\"Bagrakh%20Clan\"&gt;Bagrakh Clan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Igrun%20Clan\"&gt;Igrun Clan&lt;/a&gt; laid waste across the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt; around the village of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. These attacks would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20Raids\"&gt;Bjoulsae Raids&lt;/a&gt;, and it inspired King Joile to take action, by coordinating a joint-attack along with the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Sentinel\"&gt;Kingdom of Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gaiden%20Shinji\"&gt;Gaiden Shinji&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Diagna\"&gt;Order of Diagna&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20948\"&gt;1E 948&lt;/a&gt;, King Joile had sent a letter to Gaiden Shinji. And so in &lt;a href=\"1E%20950\"&gt;1E 950&lt;/a&gt;, the historically-infamous, &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Siege of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; had begun, being a wide-scale conflict between the Orsimer of Wrothgar, and the denizens of the Iliac Bay. The Redguards of Sentinel served as one-half of the invasion force, partaking in various battles, from Orsinium, to as far as, &lt;a href=\"Fharun\"&gt;Fharun Pass&lt;/a&gt;. At this time, Gaiden Shinji was a well-renowned warrior, having founded the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Arena\"&gt;Imperial City Arena&lt;/a&gt;, as well as, coming to know other similar figures such as &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Trystan\"&gt;Lord Trystan&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Knights of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;. Gaiden Shinji and King Joile amassed a raid onto Grudgement Keep, where Joile had slain &lt;a href=\"King%20Golkarr\"&gt;King Golkarr&lt;/a&gt; of Orsinium. Amidst the thirty-year campaign, Gaiden Shinji's forces came into contact with &lt;a href=\"Baloth%20Bloodtusk\"&gt;Baloth Bloodtusk&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful Orcish warrior that led the Orcish militia, the &lt;a href=\"Savage%20Sons\"&gt;Savage Sons&lt;/a&gt;. The two engaged in a dynamic battle of Iron Might in a secluded area of &lt;a href=\"Western%20Wrothgar\"&gt;Western Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, the two were killed in combat, and the site had become known as &lt;a href=\"Honor%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Honor's Rest&lt;/a&gt;, preserving the warrior's honor, regardless of politics. The Siege of Orsinium continued, King Joile attempted to conquer Hammerfell in &lt;a href=\"1E%20973\"&gt;1E 973&lt;/a&gt; by bypassing through &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Pass\"&gt;Bangkorai Pass&lt;/a&gt;. He was almost successful, until he was killed by &lt;a href=\"Makela%20Leki\"&gt;Makela Leki&lt;/a&gt;, among the last &lt;a href=\"Sword-Singers\"&gt;Sword-Singers&lt;/a&gt; in history. The Siege ended in &lt;a href=\"1E%20980\"&gt;1E 980&lt;/a&gt;, and the Kingdom of Sentinel was left drained from the battle.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nKing Fahara'jad &amp; Suturah the Withered.\nAmidst the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20560\"&gt;2E 560&lt;/a&gt;, the Kingdom of Sentinel was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Ramzi%20the%20Distrait\"&gt;Ramzi the Distrait&lt;/a&gt;, who was a poorly-performed leader, riddling his domain with uncertainty. He was weak-willed, as well as, self-reserved, especially with the arrival of the Knahaten Flu, when his Kingdom was in dire straits. King Ramzi saw this as divine intervention for his personal transgressions, and so the King died alone within the confines of &lt;a href=\"Samuruik\"&gt;Samuruik&lt;/a&gt;, leaving Sentinel without a leader. &lt;a href=\"Fahara%27jad\"&gt;Fahara'jad&lt;/a&gt; was a member of &lt;a href=\"the%20Forebears\"&gt;the Forebears&lt;/a&gt;, known as the Prince of &lt;a href=\"Antiphyllos\"&gt;Antiphyllos&lt;/a&gt;. Amidst the panic, Prince Fahara'jad assumed the throne of Sentinel, vying it over &lt;a href=\"Grandee%20Zizzeen\"&gt;Grandee Zizzeen&lt;/a&gt;, another Prince of Antiphyllos, but of &lt;a href=\"the%20Crowns\"&gt;the Crowns&lt;/a&gt;. While the Forebears were all in for Fahara'jad's rise to power, Crown rulers of the south were against this decision, and calls for revolution were in the air. In a stunning move, King Fahara'jad joined the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, an alliance of the Kingdoms of High Rock. Fahara'jad's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Maraya\"&gt;Maraya&lt;/a&gt; marries &lt;a href=\"Emeric%20of%20Cumberland\"&gt;Emeric of Cumberland&lt;/a&gt;, the High King of the province. King Fahara'jad garnered the favor of the people when not only was Maraya married to Emeric, but when a bright comet went over Sentinel, the King called it a sign from &lt;a href=\"HoonDing\"&gt;HoonDing&lt;/a&gt;, the Make Way God of Yokuda. The province of Hammerfell partook in the following conflict in High Rock, &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;King Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt;. Peace has been stable in Hammerfell, but there have been internal strife in the Alik'r Desert.\nKing Fahara'jad had established a circle of advisors, being a mix of those with untarnished reputations, and questionable backgrounds. One such advisor was &lt;a href=\"Suturah\"&gt;Suturah&lt;/a&gt;, who was later revealed to be a secret &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;. Suturah had slain several of Fahara'jad's advisors, resurrecting them in an assassination attempt. However, this failed, and so Suturah escaped into the east in the region of &lt;a href=\"Tigonus\"&gt;Tigonus&lt;/a&gt;, where he had come into contact with the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm\"&gt;Order of the Black Worm&lt;/a&gt;, the infamous necromancy group of Tamriel. Suturah returned to the Kingdom of Sentinel, utilizing an army of &lt;a href=\"Ra-Netu\"&gt;Ra-Netu&lt;/a&gt;. With little to no options, King Fahara'jad sought the help of the &lt;a href=\"Ash%27abah\"&gt;Ash'abah&lt;/a&gt;, a nomadic and exiled group of Redguards that disregard the sacred tradition of honoring the dead. The Ash'abah head figure, &lt;a href=\"Marimah\"&gt;Marimah&lt;/a&gt; led the battle against the Ra-Netu, which ended in their favor. Despite their efforts against Suturah, the Ash'abah were given no favors. King Fahara'jad had covered up the event by claiming it was divine intervention. All the while, Suturah's children, &lt;a href=\"Uwafa\"&gt;Uwafa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alasan\"&gt;Alasan&lt;/a&gt; had become involved in the world of necromancy, forming the &lt;a href=\"Withered%20Hand\"&gt;Withered Hand&lt;/a&gt;, a Redguard cult of necromancers. The Withered Hand remained in the shadows until it was time to strike.\nThe Assault on Sentinel Docks &amp; the Ansei Wards.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Sentinel was still ruled by King Fahara'jad, who had ruled over the Kingdom of Sentinel for several years. It was this year, the Withered Hand had made their appearance well-known when the &lt;a href=\"Ra-Netu\"&gt;Ra-Netu&lt;/a&gt; had begun to swarm the western harbor of Sentinel. Both &lt;a href=\"Uwafa\"&gt;Uwafa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alasan\"&gt;Alasan&lt;/a&gt; made an attempt to penetrate the &lt;a href=\"Impervious%20Vault\"&gt;Impervious Vault&lt;/a&gt;, found underneath Sentinel city. It was there, the &lt;a href=\"Ansei%20Wards\"&gt;Ansei Wards&lt;/a&gt;, godly artifacts of &lt;a href=\"Tu%27whacca\"&gt;Tu'whacca&lt;/a&gt; that give cleanse a body of the corruption forever. These were the Redguard's only hope against necromancy threats, and so the two brothers stole them, using the initial conflict as a cover while they defile the Impervious Vault. Fortunately, an &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; of the Covenant had arrived onto those docks after dealing with a &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt; threat in the faraway region of &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt;. The Agent had cut a bloody swathe throughout the Sentinel Docks, until they defeated the Ra-Netu and rescued &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Azah\"&gt;Prince Azah&lt;/a&gt;, heir to the throne. Once the Ra-Netu invasion was over, the Sentinel Guard, including &lt;a href=\"General%20Thoda\"&gt;General Thoda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gabrielle%20Benele\"&gt;Gabrielle Benele&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, and King Fahara'jad himself, took to the Impervious Vault where they learned that the Ansei Wards were stolen. &lt;a href=\"Ansei%20Radan\"&gt;Ansei Radan&lt;/a&gt;, one of those that sacrificed themselves to make the Ansei Wards, told the Agent the situation, and so King Fahara'jad pointed the Agent to the &lt;a href=\"Ash%27abah\"&gt;Ash'abah&lt;/a&gt;, who took refuge in &lt;a href=\"Morwha%27s%20Bounty\"&gt;Morwha's Bounty&lt;/a&gt;, in southern &lt;a href=\"Myrkwasa\"&gt;Myrkwasa&lt;/a&gt;.\nUwafa the Defiler; Trouble at Tu'whacca's Throne.\nUwafa, the eldest sibling, took the Ansei Ward of &lt;a href=\"Ansei%20Radan\"&gt;Ansei Radan&lt;/a&gt; to the ancient temple of &lt;a href=\"Tu%27whacca%27s%20Throne\"&gt;Tu'whacca's Throne&lt;/a&gt;, found on the desert heights of southern Myrkwasa, where he held the priests captive and resurrected various mummies of notable figures, including &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Afsar\"&gt;Queen Afsar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yokeda%20Razul\"&gt;Yokeda Razul&lt;/a&gt;. The Agent of the Covenant traveled to Morwha's Bounty, where they filled them in on the situation, and had undergone an Initiation by becoming one with the Ash'abah. &lt;a href=\"Talia%20at-Marimah\"&gt;Talia at-Marimah&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Ash'abah led the battle to retake Tu'whacca's Throne. &lt;a href=\"Throne%20Keeper%20Farvad\"&gt;Throne Keeper Farvad&lt;/a&gt; and his fellow priests were taken to Tu'whacca's Sanctum. The Agent fought across the temple and was able to secure the inner sanctum. Once inside, the Agent faced off against Uwafa, who was draining the powers of the priesthood. In the end, the Agent had killed Uwafa and Farvad had activated the temple's defense, purging the undead on the holy site. With one of the Ansei Wards recovered, the battle against the Withered Hand continued with the other brother, Alasan, who took to the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Tava%27s%20Blessing\"&gt;Tava's Blessing&lt;/a&gt; found along the northern coast of the &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Wastes\"&gt;Hollow Wastes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Azah\"&gt;Prince Azah&lt;/a&gt; attempts to defend the small port from the Withered Hand.\nAlasan the Revenant; Plot at Tava's Blessing.\nAlasan of the Withered Hand had taken the Ansei Ward of Ansei Maja to the harbor-town of Tava's Blessing, along the northern coast of the Hollow Wastes. All throughout the region, Alasan had amassed some influence, as he struck a deal with &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Sulma\"&gt;Magistrate Sulma&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bergama\"&gt;Bergama&lt;/a&gt;. Alasan's forces overwhelmed Tava's Blessing, killing the inhabitants and turning them into Ra-Netu, while Crown Prince Azah was captured. Talia at-Marimah and the Agent of the Covenant rendezvoused on the outskirts of the city, to which they rescued Azah, and disrupted the ritual of Alasan's conversion into &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;dom. However, the ritual continued, albeit halted in the process as Alasan had become a &lt;a href=\"Wraith\"&gt;Wraith&lt;/a&gt; and the Ansei Ward was destroyed. The Agent flocked all over the northern wastes to gather ingredients needed to reforge the Ward. With everything set in motion, Alasan's spirit was trapped into the Ansei Ward. With the Ansei Ward safety returned to Sentinel, only one was left in circulation, which was taken by &lt;a href=\"Shiri\"&gt;Shiri&lt;/a&gt;, the third sibling who posed undercover among those fighting against the Withered Hand. She had taken the final ward deep into &lt;a href=\"Tigonus\"&gt;Tigonus&lt;/a&gt;, to the &lt;a href=\"Motalion%20Necropolis\"&gt;Motalion Necropolis&lt;/a&gt; where her father is buried. All the while, another threat from the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;central heartlands&lt;/a&gt; of Tamriel had begun their campaign over the west.\nBattle of Satakalaam &amp; the Seventh Legion.\nWhile the Withered Hand fought a downhill battle against the Kingdom of Sentinel, the &lt;a href=\"Seventh%20Legion\"&gt;Seventh Legion&lt;/a&gt;, under the command of &lt;a href=\"Septima%20Tharn\"&gt;Septima Tharn&lt;/a&gt; had invaded the region of &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;, taking hold of the south and began their conquest over northern Bangkorai and Tigonus. &lt;a href=\"Magnifico%20Khorshad\"&gt;Magnifico Khorshad&lt;/a&gt; of Satakalaam had conspired with Septima Tharn, leading to the Seventh Legion's capture of Satakalaam via an old smuggling tunnel underneath Khorshad's manor. Shiri had used the confusion to infiltrate the Motalion Necropolis. Amidst the conflict, the Satakalaam High Temple was raided by the Legion, and various relics were scattered throughout the city. The Agent of the Covenant had infiltrated the Imperial-occupied Satakalaam, rescuing several nobles held hostage in northern Satakalaam and recovering the stolen artifacts. The smuggling tunnel was destroyed by barrels of kindlepitch, cutting the Legion's ties to reinforcements. In the end, the Alik'r Warriors were able to retake the city once the Legion was defeated. Once Satakalaam was secured, Talia at-Marimah, Farvad, and the Agent had made their way to Motalion for their final confrontation with the Withered Hand.\nShiri the Deciever &amp; Suturah the Returned.\nShiri and the Withered Hand had infiltrated the Motalion Necropolis, amidst the confusion of the Seventh Legion's attack on Satakalaam. The &lt;a href=\"Mummy\"&gt;Mummies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s had roamed the necropolis, driving out the priests that worked in the site. Shiri had stolen back all three of the Ansei Wards, imprisoning both Prince Azah and Farvad. The Ansei Ward of Maja had undergone a ritual and was protected by the Withered Hand. Both the Agent and Talia fought their way through waves of Cultist until they fought the Wraith of Alasan, ultimately destroying him. The Ansei Ward of Radan was lost from Throne Keeper Farvad and it was corrupted. Throne Keeper Farvad was forced to cleanse the ward while both the Agent and Talia fought more Ra-Netu. Shiri had sealed herself with the final Ansei Ward of &lt;a href=\"Ansei%20Halelah\"&gt;Ansei Halelah&lt;/a&gt;, using it to resurrect Suturah as a &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;. Both Shiri and Suturah were killed by the Agent and the threat to the Alik'r Desert had been over. However, while the Alik'r Desert had restored itself from the undead threat, the Seventh Legion had continued their campaign over the west, having taken over the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Garrison\"&gt;Bangkorai Garrison&lt;/a&gt; and killing the King of &lt;a href=\"Evermore\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eamond%20Guimard\"&gt;Eamond Guimard&lt;/a&gt;. The Kingdom of Evermore was left in mourning while another threat loomed over &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Hammerfell Civil War &amp; Volag's Purge.\nSince the inception of the Ra Gada, the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hegathe\"&gt;Old Hegathe&lt;/a&gt; was the capital of Hammerfell, but it was decided that it was changed to the Kingdom of Sentinel, which was very prosperous, as it controlled one-third of the trade in the Iliac Bay. However, this proved to be a bad decision considering that Sentinel is the capital of &lt;a href=\"the%20Forebears\"&gt;the Forebears&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their claim to Sentinel, the Crowns had continued their High Kingship of Hammerfell, all the way to &lt;a href=\"Thassad%20II\"&gt;Thassad II&lt;/a&gt;, who died of natural causes. &lt;a href=\"Prince%20A%27Tor\"&gt;Prince A'Tor&lt;/a&gt; was meant to inherit the throne, but things changed when &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Volag\"&gt;Baron Volag&lt;/a&gt; led an assault onto Sentinel known as &lt;a href=\"Volag%27s%20Purge\"&gt;Volag's Purge&lt;/a&gt;, leading to various Crowns to separate, with A'Tor leaving for the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Stros%20M%27Kai\"&gt;Kingdom of Stros M'Kai&lt;/a&gt;. A'Tor amassed his forces which led to the &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Hammerfell Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. A'Tor returned to the mainland and fought an uphill battle against the Forebears, who saw their fate on the horizon. With no other way, the Forebears had sought the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;, under the reign of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;. The warfront shifted from the east to the west until it arrived on the shores of Stros M'Kai. The final conflict was the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hunding%20Bay\"&gt;Battle of Hunding Bay&lt;/a&gt; between the remaining Crowns and the &lt;a href=\"New%20West%20Navy\"&gt;New West Navy&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Leading the helm was &lt;a href=\"Amiel%20Richton\"&gt;Amiel Richton&lt;/a&gt;, a Colovian Admiral-Lord. In the end, Richton killed A'Tor and was appointed the Provisional Governor of Stros M'Kai. Baron Volag's forces retreated to the mountains to remain in solitude while &lt;a href=\"Senecus%20Goddkey\"&gt;Senecus Goddkey&lt;/a&gt; was named the Provisional Governor of Sentinel. Hammerfell was conquered by the Septim Empire.\nThe Third Empire &amp; the Treaty of Stros M'Kai.\nWith the Third Empire seemingly under complete control over Hammerfell, talks of rebellion had spread across the province, specifically in Stros M'Kai. &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Cyrus&lt;/a&gt;, a Crowns mercenary had left for Stros M'Kai in search of his sister, &lt;a href=\"Iszara\"&gt;Iszara&lt;/a&gt;. After delving through the perilous dungeons of the island, and bringing back Iszara from &lt;a href=\"the%20Fields%20of%20Regret\"&gt;the Fields of Regret&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;, Cyrus the Redguard had been involved in a plot against the tyrannical Amiel Richton with a group of rebel Crowns known as the &lt;a href=\"Restless%20League\"&gt;Restless League&lt;/a&gt;. Cyrus had infiltrated the Palace in Stros M'Kai where he had slain the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nafaalilargus\"&gt;Nafaalilargus&lt;/a&gt;, and defeated Amiel Richton atop a Dwemeri Airship. Cyrus' actions in Stros M'Kai inspired many to follow in his tracts, including Baron Volag, who amassed his Forebears and retook the city-state of Sentinel from the Imperials under Senecus Goddkey. In the end, Iszara (now a leader of Stros M'Kai), Baron Volag of Sentinel, and Tiber Septim himself gathered at the Palace of &lt;a href=\"Port%20Hunding\"&gt;Port Hunding&lt;/a&gt; where they created the &lt;a href=\"First%20Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27Kai\"&gt;First Treaty of Stros M'Kai&lt;/a&gt;, the document that would fully integrate the land of the Redguards as the \"Imperial Province of Hammerfell\", with Sentinel as their capital. This treaty would continue for several years.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Alik'r and its cities during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Battlemage named &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; impersonated Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; and casted both him and &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;'s plane of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. Jagar Tharn had a mighty staff called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; which was the key to releasing Uriel and Warhaft from the Deadlands. To secure his control, he broke the Staff of Chaos into several pieces and hid them across the provinces in Tamriel. Tharn's apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt; caught wind of this and planned to tell the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, however, Tharn killed her with his vile magic. Ria Silmane's spirit sought the aid of a warrior also kept imprisoned by Tharn. Silmane help the warrior escaped and tasked them with finding the pieces of the Staff of Chaos throughout Tamriel. At one point, this warrior traveled to the city of Sentinel during their quest to gather the pieces. The warrior defeat Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt; and freed both Uriel VII and Talin Warhaft, this young warrior was named the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;. The region of Alik'r was undefined, and many settlements dotted the landscape or at least the general area. Smaller townships such as &lt;a href=\"Chasetown\"&gt;Chasetown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vulnim%20Gate\"&gt;Vulnim Gate&lt;/a&gt; existed in the area.\nConflict across the Iliac; the War of Betony.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20403\"&gt;3E 403&lt;/a&gt;, both the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Kingdom of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Sentinel\"&gt;Kingdom of Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; waged war with each other in the event known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Betony\"&gt;War of Betony&lt;/a&gt;, for the island territory of &lt;a href=\"Betony\"&gt;Betony&lt;/a&gt;, located in the western mouth of the Iliac Bay. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Mogref\"&gt;Lord Mogref&lt;/a&gt; of Betony sought to have the island owned by Daggerfall, under the command of &lt;a href=\"King%20Lysandus\"&gt;King Lysandus&lt;/a&gt;, who agreed when it was revealed that Betony is the holy land of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, a patron of Daggerfall. However, &lt;a href=\"King%20Camaron\"&gt;King Camaron&lt;/a&gt; of Sentinel had intervened in the discussion, citing a two-hundred-year-old document that claims that Betony is a territory of the Kingdom of Sentinel. King Camaron's death was foretold by &lt;a href=\"the%20Oracle\"&gt;the Oracle&lt;/a&gt;, and so she attempted to persuade Camaron from fighting against Daggerfall, but it proved to be in vain. Regardless, the War of Betony lasted for two years, with the Kingdom of Sentinel in a downhill battle as they lost the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Craghold\"&gt;Siege of Craghold&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Bluffs\"&gt;Battle of the Bluffs&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Glenpoint\"&gt;Glenpoint&lt;/a&gt;. To end the conflict, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Graddock\"&gt;Lord Graddock&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt; issued a summit in his domain, where the scribes of Daggerfall would write the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Treaty of Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href=\"Vanech\"&gt;Vanech&lt;/a&gt;, the Arch-Priest of Kynareth in Daggerfall had altered the treaty in favor over Daggerfall, as he was adamant to claim Betony. King Camaron had seen through this ruse, and so the battle ensued with the &lt;a href=\"Riot%20in%20Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Riot in Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt;. The forefront moved deeper into the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Fiefdom of Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt;, in the lands of the &lt;a href=\"Cryngaine%20Field\"&gt;Cryngaine Field&lt;/a&gt;. Amidst the conflict, both King Camaron and King Lysandus were killed, leaving their throne to their family. &lt;a href=\"Gothryd\"&gt;Gothryd&lt;/a&gt; had become the King of Daggerfall after his father, while Camaron's wife, &lt;a href=\"Akorithi\"&gt;Akorithi&lt;/a&gt; ruled as a Regent-Queen. Camaron's eldest daughter, &lt;a href=\"Aubk%27i\"&gt;Aubk'i&lt;/a&gt; marries Gothryd to secure peace in the Iliac Bay, much to the dismay of the Redguards in Sentinel. Regardless, peace had remained in the Iliac Bay.\nThe Alik'r during the Warp in the West.\nBy &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, the Kingdom of Sentinel was ruled by Regent-Queen Akorithi, while her eldest son, &lt;a href=\"Greklith\"&gt;Greklith&lt;/a&gt; would inherit the throne after her time would come. The land of the Alik'r is centralized in the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Alik%27ra\"&gt;Alik'ra&lt;/a&gt;. At this time, the ghost of King Lysandus had haunted the Iliac Bay, prompting the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; to send an &lt;a href=\"The%20Agent\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; to the Kingdom of Daggerfall to exorcize the spirit. The Agent traveled all throughout the Iliac Bay, seeking answers as to why King Lysandus returned to the mortal plane. While it is unknown as to who the Agent sought for help is unknown, but it is said that they approached &lt;a href=\"Lhotun\"&gt;Lhotun&lt;/a&gt;, the youngest child of Akorithi and Camaron. Lhotun had given the Agent the information regarding both Lysandus and &lt;a href=\"Medora%20Direnni\"&gt;Medora Direnni&lt;/a&gt;, all the while they had brought a letter of proof from his eldest sibling (before Aubk'i), the feeble prince, &lt;a href=\"Arthago\"&gt;Arthago&lt;/a&gt;. Once Lysandus' spirit had left for &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; had come into circulation after the Agent took it from &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Castle Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;. The leaders of the Iliac Bay, including Akorithi, had begun to bid for the Totem, for if they had the artifact, they would have complete control over &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;. As time went on, the Totem had fallen into obscurity and the Kingdoms of the Iliac waged war for complete control over the region.\nAs time went on, on the 10th of &lt;a href=\"Frostfall\"&gt;Frostfall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt;, a magical anomaly known as the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt; had occurred. The Kingdoms had continued their conflict across the Iliac Bay. The Kingdom of Sentinel had cut a bloody-swathe throughout the southern Iliac and the Alik'r Desert, conquering the land. On the 9th of Frostfall, Queen Akorithi's forces were at the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Bergama\"&gt;Bergama&lt;/a&gt; amidst a cruel sandstorm. Sentinel's warriors had completely ransacked Bergama and destroyed the Baron's castle. The next morning, the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; had swept across the Iliac Bay, going from the forty-four independent nations to the four kingdoms of the Iliac Bay (&lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;). Sentinel's kingdom had spread across from the &lt;a href=\"Barony%20of%20Abibon-Gora\"&gt;Barony of Abibon-Gora&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Satakalaam\"&gt;County of Satakalaam&lt;/a&gt;. Amidst this conquest, both Queen Akorithi and Greklith had passed away from an unknown disease, leaving the throne to the only remaining heir, Lhotun, whose reign would bring much controversy to the province of Hammerfell.\nA Coup d'etat at Lainlyn; Lord Kain of the True Horn.\nSince &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, the Barony of Lainlyn had been ruled by &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Shrike\"&gt;Baron Shrike&lt;/a&gt;, who was known throughout his domain as being a tyrannical ruler that governs with an iron fist. Many people were against his law, including his younger brother, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kain\"&gt;Lord Kain&lt;/a&gt;. Both he and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Harth\"&gt;Lord Harth&lt;/a&gt; had founded the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20True%20Horn\"&gt;Knights of the True Horn&lt;/a&gt;, a knightly order whose name is a subtle jab at Lainlyn's knightly order, the &lt;a href=\"Host%20of%20the%20Horn\"&gt;Host of the Horn&lt;/a&gt;. At one point, the Knights had staged a coup d'etat on Lainlyn, in the attempt to overthrow Kain's older brother, but it proved to be in vain and so the True Horn was forced to separate. Kain ordered his group to disband into several groups and to await his call to reunite. However, Lord Kain had died in not long after his coup d'etat but was resurrected by &lt;a href=\"Arielle%20Jurard\"&gt;Arielle Jurard&lt;/a&gt;, an infamous necromancer from Lainlyn. Kain and Jurard traveled for the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, where both &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Jaren\"&gt;Lord Jaren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garridan%20Stalrous\"&gt;Garridan Stalrous&lt;/a&gt;, of the True Horn took refuge until the reunion. Arielle Jurard resurrected Lord Kain to further continue the fight against Baron Shrike. Both Jurard and Lord Kain were sealed inside &lt;a href=\"Battlehorn%20Castle\"&gt;Battlehorn Castle&lt;/a&gt;, in the western outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;, where they remained. Both Lord Jaren and Lord Garridan continued to serve the remaining Knights of the True Horn, however, Garridan had perished in the attempt to save his village, the &lt;a href=\"Farmantle%20Glens\"&gt;Farmantle Glens&lt;/a&gt; from a drought, while Lord Jaren eventually passed the castle to his son, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kelvyn\"&gt;Lord Kelvyn&lt;/a&gt;. Baron Shrike continued his reign over Lainlyn until he too passed away. The Knights of the True Horn had fallen into obscurity as the Battlehorn Castle, the order's legacy remained in the care of another &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Rise of King Lhotun; the Waning Third Era.\nWith the entirety of the Iliac-Hammerfell under the rule of the Kingdom of Sentinel, trouble be would come onto King Lhotun as Sentinel is a kingdom of the Forebears while a majority of the area is affiliated with the Crowns. Lhotun had become involved in military, diplomatic, and even religious missions to keep these nations under his wing. With such conflicting ideas between the Crowns and the Forebears, Lhotun had established a third political party, one seen in the gray area between the two traditional factions. This group was known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Lhotunics\"&gt;the Lhotunics&lt;/a&gt;, one that respected Imperial law but held reverence with the culture of Yokuda. However, this brought nothing but contempt to the two other factions, both seeking ways to undermine the Kingdom of Sentinel and King Lhotun's reign. &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Clavilla\"&gt;Queen Clavilla&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Taneth\"&gt;Kingdom of Taneth&lt;/a&gt; had tried to revoke charters of independent guilds from the Kingdom of Sentinel, but it proved to be ineffective. Clavilla's reasoning was that worship of &lt;a href=\"Satakal\"&gt;Satakal&lt;/a&gt; was otherwise considered heresy in the eyes of the Third Empire. All the while, in the heartlands of the Crowns, &lt;a href=\"Ayaan-si\"&gt;Ayaan-si&lt;/a&gt;, a High Prophet of &lt;a href=\"Elinhir\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt; had called upon the True Crowns to rebel against King Lhotun. Ayaan-si had established forays across &lt;a href=\"Bergama\"&gt;Bergama&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dak%27fron%20Desert\"&gt;Dak'fron Desert&lt;/a&gt;, being successful in the acquisition of the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Totambu\"&gt;Fiefdom of Totambu&lt;/a&gt;, to which it established independence from Sentinel. Ever since then, the battlefront had shifted back into Totambu as of &lt;a href=\"3E%20432\"&gt;3E 432&lt;/a&gt;. The outcome of the conflict is currently unknown.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nArannelya's Campaign &amp; the Great War.\nOn the 30th of &lt;a href=\"Frostfall\"&gt;Frostfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"4E%20171\"&gt;4E 171&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; had waged war with the weakened &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;, then under the command of &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt;. And so the Third Aldmeri Dominion advanced from the south, with the Dominion under the command of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Arannelya\"&gt;Lady Arannelya&lt;/a&gt; had invaded Hammerfell, as &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Naarifin\"&gt;Lord Naarifin&lt;/a&gt; invaded the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt;. Arannelya's forces were able to overrun southern Hammerfell when only the disunited Redguard forces had only shown scattered resistance against the Dominion. The outnumbered &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; was forced to tread across the Alik'r Desert, which became known as the &lt;a href=\"March%20of%20Thirst\"&gt;March of Thirst&lt;/a&gt;. The Thalmor took over the entirety of the southern coast with content, but the former capital, &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt; had held substantial resistance against the Dominion. The surviving March of Thirst regrouped with the Legion in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, under the command of &lt;a href=\"General%20Decianus\"&gt;General Decianus&lt;/a&gt;. The Forebears of Sentinel were able to break the siege against Hegathe, promoting the two factions, the Crowns and Forebears to reconcile in this provincial crisis. Arannelya moved across the Alik'r to the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Skaven\"&gt;Skaven&lt;/a&gt;, where Decianus' forces fought in a bloody battle against them. Decianus had, unfortunately, withdrawn from Skaven, leading to the Dominion's occupation of the Crowns city. However, Legion \"invalids\" were able to retake Skaven and drive Arannelya's forces into the Greater Alik'r in &lt;a href=\"4E%20174\"&gt;4E 174&lt;/a&gt;, taking a loss from the Alik'r warriors that stalk the region. The &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; continues into &lt;a href=\"4E%20175\"&gt;4E 175&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Red%20Ring\"&gt;Battle of the Red Ring&lt;/a&gt;, where Titus Mede II was able to retake the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; from the Third Aldmeri Dominion under Lord Naarifin.\nHammerfell Stands Alone &amp; the White-Gold Concordat.\nIn the late 4E 174, Emperor Titus Mede II and the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; create the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt; after a very close victory over the Aldmeri Dominion in the Battle of the Red Ring. Titus Mede was very aware of the weakened state the Third Empire has been left, in no condition where they could continue the fight. The terms were harsh in the eyes of the Empire but were necessary to secure peace and time to rebuild. The Concordat's two controversial notes were the banned worship of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, the Hero-God of Mankind, much to the dismay of the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, and the cession of a majority of the southern-half of Hammerfell, much to the dismay of the Redguards. The Redguards of Hammerfell were unwilling to give the south to the &lt;a href=\"High%20Elves\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt;, having felt a great betrayal, the Thalmor had strengthened the bitterness between Hammerfell and the Third Empire. In the end, the Great War had continued for five more years between Hammerfell and the Dominion until it had ultimately ended in &lt;a href=\"4E%20180\"&gt;4E 180&lt;/a&gt; with the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27Kai\"&gt;Second Treaty of Stros M'Kai&lt;/a&gt;. Because of Hammerfell's rebellion against the White-Gold Concordat, Titus Mede II was forced to renounce the province's allegiance to the Third Empire, to ensure the peace to the Empire, this is what led to the continued fight and the Empire's lack of inclusion in the conflict. Ever since then, the province of Hammerfell has been independent of the rest of the continent."}

{"id": "388262", "revid": "32911304", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=388262", "title": "Alik'r Desert (Online)", "text": "The Alik'r Desert is a vast desert\u00a0&lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt; spanning much of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; including the northern coast in . It is a scorching, arid wasteland where ancient ruins and deadly &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Online%29\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt; lie hidden in the shifting sands. The only major center of civilization is the city of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, ruled by &lt;a href=\"King%20Fahara%27jad\"&gt;King Fahara'jad&lt;/a&gt;, and its surrounding towns.\nBackground.\nThe Alik'r Desert stretches from the Hammerfell coast along the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; to the central lands and while rich in resources, it is extremely inhospitable. Dotted along the desert dunes are ancient settlements, ruined structures, old caves including abandoned cities left behind by the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s. While deserts are considered useless places to avoid by those beyond Hammerfell, the &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; hold the Alik'r in great reverence for its history and cultural impact.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, a necromancer cult known as the &lt;a href=\"Withered%20Hand\"&gt;Withered Hand&lt;/a&gt; was responsible for raising dead Redguard and &lt;a href=\"Yokudan\"&gt;Yokudan&lt;/a&gt; warriors from their tombs. With many unwilling to fight against the undead incursions out of fear of being cursed for striking the dead, the Redguards enlisted the help of the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; to end the attacks by defeating the Withered Hand. The Withered Hand had displaced the &lt;a href=\"Ansei%20Wards\"&gt;Ansei Wards&lt;/a&gt; that protected the buried dead from necromancy. Thus, by returning the Wards, the Withered Hand would be powerless. After recovering the Wards, the Vestige was able to defeat the leaders of the Withered Hand and end the crisis.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in the Alik'r Desert and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralized areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nThe Alik'r Desert features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests tie into the Daggerfall Covenant's overarching storyline and carries on from &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt; before continuing to &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in the Alik'r Desert. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others. Pointer quests are optional zone quests that send the Vestige to the tarting location of another zone quest.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nSixteen Skyshards can be found in the Alik'r Desert totaling in five &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt; with one left over. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nThirty-two books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in the Alik'r Desert and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

In an earlier age \"before the ascendancy of &lt;a href=\"man\"&gt;man&lt;/a&gt;,\" Summerset was called Alinor, which is the province's oldest and current name.\nBackground.\nPhysical appearance.\nLocated on Summerset's west coast, human traders were only allowed at Alinor's ports, and they described the city as \"made from glass or insect wings.\" &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; emissaries of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Dynasty\"&gt;Reman Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; described the city as straight and glimmering, \"a hypnotic swirl of ramparts and impossibly high towers, designed to catch the light of &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;the sun&lt;/a&gt; and break it to its component colors, which lies draped across its stones until you are thankful for nightfall.\" It is also described by the Alinori scribe, Alanya, as a well-lit city with a temperate climate.\nCitizens.\nAmbassadors of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt; were only allowed in the capital of Alinor, and thus all descriptions of the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; and their homeland were confined to that city alone. The High Elves of Alinor are described as a homogeneous people who employ eugenics to themselves, and selectively breed their livestock and trees. Breeding outside the pure Altmeri line is a crime punishable by exile to the mainland, which is regarded as equivalent to a death sentence since there is no purpose in living outside their ideal society. They have a high regard for order, gravitate naturally towards wearing uniforms, and surround themselves with the works of great artists, and the finest riches and treasures. To the human ambassadors of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, the Altmer appeared cold and lacking in compassion, with speech full of riddles or enchanting spell-words.\nThese attitudes and characteristics can be observed in &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; agents of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Ancano\"&gt;Ancano&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ondolemar\"&gt;Ondolemar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Elenwen%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Elenwen&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nMerethic Era.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i society grew and changed, so too did their religion. A group of elders rebelled against these changes, calling themselves the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijics&lt;/a&gt;, and were exiled from Alinor due to the very unorthodox views they held for members of their race. These views included the suggestion that &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; (sometimes referred to as the \"Alinor Dragon\") was formed in reaction to &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay's&lt;/a&gt; influence. While the Prophet &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; was not among those exiled, his teachings were eventually prohibited by the &lt;a href=\"Sapiarch\"&gt;Sapiarch&lt;/a&gt;s of Alinor.\n&lt;a href=\"Aetherial\"&gt;Aetherial&lt;/a&gt; travelers in Alinor would use &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Birds\"&gt;Sun Birds&lt;/a&gt; to gather celestial mineral during the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;. Their expeditions to Aetherius are among the most famous attempts in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;ic history, and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Orrery\"&gt;Great Orrery&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; is their only legacy.\nFirst and Second Era.\nInternal conflicts between Alinor and &lt;a href=\"Lillandril\"&gt;Lillandril&lt;/a&gt; often sparked into full war during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; and most of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; came to Alinor not long after &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt; first founded the guild in &lt;a href=\"2E%20230\"&gt;2E 230&lt;/a&gt;. In the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20486\"&gt;2E 486&lt;/a&gt;, King &lt;a href=\"Hidellith\"&gt;Hidellith&lt;/a&gt; ordered his navy to follow a small &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt;i fleet that had been sighted off the coast of Alinor. Most of the Alinori navy was destroyed after they were ambushed in the uncharted waters of &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to &lt;a href=\"2E%20864\"&gt;2E 864&lt;/a&gt;, Alinor was a forbidden city for nearly fifty years.\nIt is mentioned in the building plans of the High Elven architect, Neleminduure, that stone was to be imported from the Alinor region for construction of buildings on &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Surrender of Alinor.\nAfter conquering the human kingdoms of Tamriel, &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; planned to send his &lt;a href=\"Battlemage\"&gt;Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt;, to meet with the King of Alinor in order to make peace between the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Although Zurin did meet with the King in &lt;a href=\"2E%20864\"&gt;2E 864&lt;/a&gt;, Tiber Septim would go on to invade the Summerset Isles using the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;, which lay siege to Alinor for one hour before the Altmer surrendered.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; was swept away by Tiber Septim's armies, the Dominion was ended, and the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Alinor\"&gt;Throne of Alinor&lt;/a&gt; broke at the feet of Men. This event shook Altmer society to its foundation, and even in the closing years of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, was still remembered by many living Altmer with horror only partially diminished by time. The archives of Alinor still remained inaccessible to human scholars during the early years of Tiber Septim's reign.\nUse of the Numidium on Alinor broke time itself, causing the Brass God's siege to last from the Merethic Era until long into the Fifth Era. Some Altmer \"Mirror Logicians\" still fight Numidium, although their brethren know nothing of their purpose.\nFourth Era.\nThe Thalmor renamed the Summerset Isles back to Alinor after seizing total control of the nation in &lt;a href=\"4E%2022\"&gt;4E 22&lt;/a&gt;. Members of the Thalmor who make \"inexcusable errors\" are sent to Alinor for \"punishment and reeducation.\" Even under Dominion rule, ships from Alinor are known to travel as far as &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;.\nMonarchs.\nThe following are monarchs of Alinor, referred to by title if their names are unknown, and the years or era in which they are known to have ruled:\nThere are no mentions of a King or Queen of Alinor during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, and unlike previous Dominions, the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; was re-established by the Thalmor."}

She was the last Listener in Cyrodiil, as well as the Listener previous to the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAlisanne was the step-daughter of a powerful merchant named &lt;a href=\"Uther%20Nere\"&gt;Uther Nere&lt;/a&gt;. For reasons unknown, Uther killed her mother, and it has been heavily implied that Uther framed Alisanne for the murder. Alisanne, sworn to exact vengeance on Uther, contacted the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; in order to receive training. Uther was aware of this and at some point hired &lt;a href=\"the%20Forgotten%20Hero\"&gt;the Forgotten Hero&lt;/a&gt; to infiltrate the Brotherhood and kill her, telling the Hero that Alisanne killed her mother and was plotting to kill him too.\nThe Listener.\nAlisanne eventually becomes the Listener some time during the Great War. In Rain's Hand &lt;a href=\"4E%20187\"&gt;4E 187&lt;/a&gt;, Alisanne visited the &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Cheydinhal Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; and spoke with &lt;a href=\"Rasha%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Rasha&lt;/a&gt; about the possibility of reinstating training for &lt;a href=\"Shadowscale\"&gt;Shadowscale&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Archon\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, although they never did, due to the lack of resources. During the hostilities between two rival skooma gangs known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Claws\"&gt;the Claws&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"the%20Eclipse\"&gt;the Eclipse&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;, Alisanne was forced to hire mercenaries to protect her home. As the riots escalated, &lt;a href=\"The%20Lucky%20Old%20Lady\"&gt;The Lucky Old Lady&lt;/a&gt; statue was destroyed, and Alisanne went to the Crypt under\u00a0The Lucky Old Lady\u00a0to protect the Night Mother. After the skooma gangs were dealt with, Uther and his men arrived to kill Alisanne and burn the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;'s corpse. If chosen to defend, she and the Forgotten Hero fight off Uther's men while &lt;a href=\"Garnag\"&gt;Garnag&lt;/a&gt; escapes with the Night Mother's coffin to the Cheydinhal Sanctuary. She was burned alive by Uther's mages during the fight. It is noted in his journals that\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Cicero\"&gt;Cicero&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0had a great amount of respect for Alisanne, even before he became the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0"}

Like guars, alits are omnivores, but are far more voracious: having been known eat anything and everything they can get their mouths on, they've even been known to have sweet teeth, gobbling up bottles of liquids such as &lt;a href=\"Torchbug%20Treacle\"&gt;Torchbug Treacle&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike guars and kagouti, alits are solitary creatures, usually only gathering in numbers when a large amount of food is available in one spot, and they generally hunt alone. Although they are considered pests, they are sometimes hunted for their hides and scale oils, which are both used for commercial purposes. Their meat, however, is considered tough and gamey, sometimes poisonous, but alit hearts are considered an &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; delicacy. Alits are more aggressive than guar, but not as aggressive as kagouti; attacking by biting, and sometimes jumping and gouging with their claws. Although alits are not domesticated animals like guar, some argonians have had luck taming and using alits to fight alongside them in combat."}

He was made the god of time, \"for what is fast and slow as a cat?\" The book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Wandering%20Spirits\"&gt;The Wandering Spirits&lt;/a&gt;\" contradicts these claims, suggesting that the god that came from the first litter of Ahnuur and Fadomai was &lt;a href=\"Akha\"&gt;Akha&lt;/a&gt;, who later disappeared, with Alkosh appearing in his stead.\nHe is depicted in ancient Khajiit legends as a fearsome dragon, but in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;s the Khajiit adapted the legends into claiming that he was actually just a big cat.

When the Skaal hunt, it is only out of necessity, and not for sport. Because they hold all life in great reverence, the Skaal people will resort to violence only if it is their last option.\nRituals.\nThe Ristaag, a ritual hunt the Skaal perform in times of great need, is done to please the All-Maker, to show him gratitude for the gifts he has given the Skaal.\nThe &lt;a href=\"All-Maker%20Stones\"&gt;All-Maker Stones&lt;/a&gt; are sacred to the All-Maker, and are believed by the Skaal to be the All-Maker's point of contact to the stone's respective area. There are six of them: the &lt;a href=\"Tree%20Stone\"&gt;Tree Stone&lt;/a&gt;, representing plant life, the &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Stone\"&gt;Sun Stone&lt;/a&gt;, representing the sun, the &lt;a href=\"Water%20Stone\"&gt;Water Stone&lt;/a&gt;, representing water, the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Stone\"&gt;Earth Stone&lt;/a&gt;, representing earth, the &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Stone\"&gt;Wind Stone&lt;/a&gt;, representing the sky, and the &lt;a href=\"Beast%20Stone\"&gt;Beast Stone&lt;/a&gt;, representing the animals of the wild.\nThe blessings of the stones have been stolen from the Skaal before by a being named the Greedy Man.

Here are some observations, recorded for future travelers to this chilly clime:\nGiants are tall.\nGiants seem peaceful enough. Until you threaten them. Then they swing huge clubs and launch even a burly Nord over field and stream. The trip probably kills the Nord. That would be my guess, as I've never been able to interview a survivor of a giant's swing.\nThings that seem to threaten giants include, but are not limited to:\nGoing near them.\nThreatening their &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;mammoths&lt;/a&gt;.\nShooting arrows at them.\nNo one that I have spoken to has ever seen a female giant or a young giant. Are giant children taller than &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;? Are female giants painfully shy? This calls for additional observation.\nGiants paint rocks and trees near their encampments. This primitive art probably entices the rare female giantess who might wander by. Or the decorations mark territory. Or the giants simply like to paint. This calls for further study.\nHow does a giant milk a mammoth? VERY carefully. (Note: Nords found this joke to be very amusing. Especially after several mugs of mead.)\nNo Nord I spoke to has ever tasted &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20Cheese%20Bowl\"&gt;mammoth cheese&lt;/a&gt;. They seem to have no interest in doing so.\nI shall have to find a way to befriend one of these large creatures. That's the only way I can think of to get a sample of that wonderful smelling cheese.\nNote from &lt;a href=\"Jeggord%20the%20Learned\"&gt;Jeggord the Learned&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2E%20571\"&gt;2E 571&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Wood Elf Bonorion was found at the base of large hill near the area known as &lt;a href=\"Cradlecrush%20Rock\"&gt;Cradlecrush&lt;/a&gt;. Given the condition of his body, that is, every bone broken, it appears that he ignored his own advice. Even the dimmest Nord children know better than to approach a giant. As the nearest giant camp was nearly a league from where his body was found, I would say that Wood Elves can travel great distances when launched by a giant's club.\nI have preserved his journal as a cautionary tale for future explorers of Eastmarch, the Rift, and other regions where giants make their homes. Heed its advice, even if its author did not: don't try to befriend a giant."}

Nords are also naturally superior at sea, and have benefited from nautical trade since their first migrations across the sea from Atmora. They captain and crew the merchant fleets of many regions, and may be found all along &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;'s coasts. They issue a &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Cry\"&gt;battle cry&lt;/a&gt; to make their enemies flee for a short time. Nords comprise the majority of the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the majority of the population of Skyrim.\nPopular usage.\nIn past games, Nords typically fared well as warrior, barbarian, or scout characters. They retain this advantage because of their specialization in both &lt;a href=\"One-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;one-handed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;two-handed&lt;/a&gt; weapons as well as &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;light armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheir initial power (Battle Cry) makes most enemies flee for 30 seconds. This is extremely helpful when the player is overwhelmed by enemies that are of a slightly higher level than the player, and especially useful at lower levels. The Nords' bonus effect gives the player a 50% resistance to frost without having to equip enchanted apparel, such as &lt;a href=\"Dukaan%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;Dukaan&lt;/a&gt;'s or &lt;a href=\"Otar%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;Otar&lt;/a&gt;'s masks. This is of paramount importance when fighting mages or &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; that heavily rely on frost attacks. This starting power is superior to most other racial resistances, as many spells cast at the player are frost-based, although &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Wizard\"&gt;Thalmor Wizard&lt;/a&gt;s tend to favor shock spells. Many intimidating, overwhelming enemies\u2014such as leveled &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt;\u2014use these spells which can easily, without resistance, drain one's health.\nDialogue between the player and Nord NPCs regarding the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; seems to show support for both the Stormcloaks and the Empire, clearly evidencing the bitter war which has split the people.\nNordic names.\nThere are many Scandinavian-sounding names such as Ralof, Ulfric, Rorik, Hadvar, Sven, Hod, etc. Many other names are reminiscent of other Germanic origins. Many Nords have surnames or clan names formed by an adjective and noun that are usually hyphenated (e.g. Black-Briar). Other Nord names involve descriptive epithets such as \"the Fair.\""}

Throw off the shackles of &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; oppression. Do not bow to the yoke of a false &lt;a href=\"emperor\"&gt;emperor&lt;/a&gt;. Be true to your blood, to your homeland.\nThe empire tells us we cannot worship holy &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;. How can man set aside a god? How can a true Nord of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; cast aside the god that rose from our own heartland? Mighty &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, himself the first emperor, conqueror of all &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, ascended to godhood to sit at the right hand of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;. Tiber Septim, a true son of Skyrim, born in the land of snow and blood, bred to the honor of our people, is now Talos, god of might and honor. &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Tamriel\"&gt;The Empire&lt;/a&gt; has no right to tell us we cannot worship him.\nOur own &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;high king&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Torygg\"&gt;Torygg&lt;/a&gt;, betrayed us to the empire. He traded our god for peace. He agreed to a pact with the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; signed by an emperor in a foreign land. Are we to be beholden to such a pact? No! A thousand times no.\nDo not let the lessons of history go unheeded. The &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; and its Thalmor masters made war upon men, just as the &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; made war upon &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; and our people in ancient times. Shining &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt; was burned to the ground, reduced to ruins and rubble in their treacherous assault. But Ysgramor and his sons gathered the &lt;a href=\"The%20Companions\"&gt;500 Companions&lt;/a&gt; and made war upon the elves, casting them out of Skyrim. In &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;The Great War&lt;/a&gt; fought by our fathers, the elves again betrayed men by attacking us unprovoked. The Dominion and the Thalmor cannot be trusted!\nLike Ysgramor, &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; is a true hero of Skyrim. His name will ring in &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; for generations to come. Only he had the courage to single out King Torygg and challenge him to trial by arms. Ulfric's &lt;a href=\"thu%27um\"&gt;thu'um&lt;/a&gt;, a gift from Talos himself, struck down this traitorous ruler. And by his death we are now free of our Imperial shackles and the Thalmor overlords that darken the Imperial throne.\nThe Empire has sent its &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Legions&lt;/a&gt; to govern us. They have enlisted our own countrymen to their cause. They have set brother against brother, father against son. They have caused Skyrim to battle itself in their name, for their cause. Do not let them divide us. Do not let them conquer us! Reject the Imperial law that forbids the worship of Talos. Join Ulfric Stormcloak and his cause!"}

My name is &lt;a href=\"Hrothmund%20Wolf-Heart\"&gt;Hrothmund Wolf-Heart&lt;/a&gt; and I am a Nord. But, more importantly, I am a Nord born and raised in the land of Skyrim.\nI write this volume in the desperate hope that the rest of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; can come to know my people as they deserve to be known, and understand this province for what it truly is - a place of uncontested beauty and culture.\nSome of what you know is undoubtedly true. Physically, we Nords are an impressive, often imposing sight - tall of stature, strong of bone, and thick of muscle. Our hair is often fair, and worn braided, as has been the custom for generations. Often we are swathed in the hides of beasts, for such creatures are abundant in Skyrim, and we would be foolish not to take advantage of such an available resource.\nHaving read this far, you may be shocked at the strength of my words, and the literacy of a northern \"savage.\" Aye, many Nords can both read and write. My father began my instruction in the way of letters when I was but a bairn, as did his father, and his father before him.\nBut the accomplishments of the children of Skyrim are multitude, and go beyond mere wordcraft. For we are artisans as well, and through the ages have learned to manipulate steel the way a sculptor would clay.\nIndeed, I have seen with mine own eyes, visitors from &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; weep in disbelief as they beheld the blades wrought in the fires of the &lt;a href=\"Skyforge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skyforge&lt;/a&gt;, and honed to beautiful deadliness by the gods-touched hands of Clan Gray-Mane.\nBut how can this be true, you ask? How are such achievements possible from a people who have yet to emerge from the muck and snow? Again, provincial bias clouds the truth.\nThe cities of Skyrim are a testament to Nord ingenuity and craftsmanship. Chief among them are &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, seat of the High King and capital of the province; &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, ancient and honored, a jewel in the snow; &lt;a href=\"Markarth\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;, carved into the living rock itself, in ages long since past; &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, nestled in the golden shadows of the Fall Forest, whence comes delicious fish and mead; and &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, built around the hall of &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt;, home of the most noble &lt;a href=\"The%20Companions\"&gt;Companions&lt;/a&gt; and revered Skyforge.\nAnd now, respected reader, you have the full measure of it. We Nords are everything you imagined - and so much more.\nBut let not this work be your only gateway to the truth. Book passage on carriage or vessal, and make the journey north. See Skyrim with thine own eyes. See Skyrim as have the Nords, since the gods first shaped the world."}

It is one of the four places in which &lt;a href=\"Adamantium%20Ore\"&gt;Adamantium Ore&lt;/a&gt; can be found.\nSublocations.\nThe Grand Stair.\nThe Grand Stair is a giant stairway which seems to lead nowhere. There is only a single large chamber which is dominated by the stairs and several &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt;. There is nothing else here for the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Teeth that Gnash.\nThe Teeth that Gnash is a large chamber with a very high ceiling inside the Daedric ruin. The chamber has two very tall spires which each have paths spiraling around the exterior allowing for passage to the very top, but there is nothing found once there. This chamber is however one of the few places where &lt;a href=\"Adamantium%20Ore\"&gt;Adamantium Ore&lt;/a&gt; can be found. The Nerevarine must pass through here to reach the Citadel of Myn Dhrur during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Blade%20of%20Nerevar\"&gt;The Blade of Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;\" but otherwise there is nothing else of note.\nCitadel of Myn Dhrur.\nCitadel of Myn Dhrur is a large partially flooded chamber. This is the home of &lt;a href=\"Khash-Ti%20Dhrur\"&gt;Khash-Ti Dhrur&lt;/a&gt;, a unique dremora lord who has in his possession a vital item the Nerevarine requires. Besides Khash-Ti there are other powerful creatures found here but no loose treasure to be had. There are doors here which lead to The Wailingdelve and the Basilica of Divine Whispers. The door to the Wailingdelve is near the high ceiling close to the entrance from The Teeth that Gnash and the door to the Basilica of Divine Whispers is on the western wall near the water's edge.\nBasilica of Divine Whispers.\nThe entire chamber is dotted with giant statues of the various &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt; worshiped throughout &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. There are also three Atronachs residing here, generally close to the entrance. Apart from this, there is nothing else for the Nerevarine here.\nThe Wailingdelve.\nThe Wailingdelve is a uniquely shaped chamber inside the Daedric shrine of Norenen-dur. It is essentially a chasm carved by a very high waterfall with a deep pool at the base. There are no enemies here, only treasure. The only way out is back at the top of the falls which can only be reached by flight or &lt;a href=\"Levitate%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Levitation&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Blade%20of%20Nerevar\"&gt;The Blade of Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to enchant &lt;a href=\"Trueflame%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Trueflame&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Radac%20Stungnthumz\"&gt;Radac Stungnthumz&lt;/a&gt; asks for a bottle of Pyroil Tar, which can be found in Norenen-dur.

We've found the perfect site for a stronghold if ever there was one. I know I said that the last time, but this isn't some crumbling old fort with breezy barracks and moldering sheets. No, these ruins we found are a highwayman's paradise.\nWe're well off the beaten path here. Through some caverns and a valley not visible from the mountain pass. No chance of &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; soldiers patrolling by and noticing a poorly concealed campfire, again. In fact, we don't even need campfires for more than cooking anymore, and maybe not even that. There are lava channels all through the area that keep the caverns and ruins nice and toasty. That probably explains why it's so lush too. You'd never expect to find so much growth this high in the mountains, much less vines nearly as thick as I am wide.\nThe way I see it, if things are looking lean or we need to lay low, we could probably live pretty well off the land here. Chop up some vines, melt some snow, and settle in on a bed of warm grass until things blow over. Practically the lap of luxury by hideout standards.\nAll right, so maybe hauling the goods back to this place is a bit more effort than I anticipated, but I haven't so much as seen the speck of another Man or Mer in the distance on the way back. There're rumors that the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; use the trails out this way, but what have we got to fear from a bunch of stone-bangers in loincloths? Still, might do to set up some snares and alarms until we've got these ruins fortified.\nI don't think I noticed how much the walls look like they're bleeding when we first found this place. There's this &lt;a href=\"Nirncrux\"&gt;dusty red stone&lt;/a&gt; all over. I mean, it's not like they're actually bleeding ... I just can't get the image out of my head now that I've seen it.\nNearly killed one of the gang last night while we were sleeping. I was feeling restless is all, and he wouldn't stop fidgeting. The creak of his leathers was tickling my ears like a squeaky cart wheel every time I thought I might drift off. I made to smack him, but when I turned to look he was sleeping like the dead, still as can be, but the creaking was still in my ears.\nIt was the vines. Writhing like drunk serpents.\nI had to get away for a bit. The shifting of those vines can cut right through a crowd to reach my ears now. I'm just going a bit stir crazy is all. Figure I'll poke around the pass and get a better lay of the land.\nThird flock of crows to pass in less than an hour. Or maybe the same lot and just lost? Seems a bit late in the season for birds to be lingering about. Bad omen, or so I hear anyway.\nI don't know where they came from. Reachmen scouring the mountains. Scores of them! It looks like they're hunting for something, but it's not like there's anything out here for the likes of them ... except us. They don't seem to have found the hideaway yet, but I've got a sinking feeling that won't be the case for long.\nI'd like nothing better to tell the gang to pack it in and high tail it out of here, but I don't see us slipping past all those barbarians unnoticed. Guess we'll be waiting things out sooner than anticipated.\nDamn birds! The crows have taken roost in our ruins and it's been non-stop cawing ever since. The way it carried through the caverns you'd think they were ten times their size.\nGods, make it stop!"}

It takes up the northern portion of the province of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; and is governed from the capital city of &lt;a href=\"Rimmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt;. The geography of Northern Elsweyr is remarked as being made up of windswept savannas, craggy desert canyons, and dense jungles.\nBackground.\nAlthough nominally a part of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, Northern Elsweyr acts autonomously under the rulership of &lt;a href=\"Euraxia%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Euraxia Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, the self-proclaimed Queen of Rimmen. At the start of the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Revolt\"&gt;Colovian Revolt&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20576\"&gt;2E 576&lt;/a&gt;, Tharn entered Rimmen as an emissary of &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; with a large contingent of &lt;a href=\"Nibenese\"&gt;Nibenese&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Euraxian%20Legion\"&gt;mercenaries&lt;/a&gt;. Entering the city under a pretence of diplomacy, Tharn murdered the royal family of &lt;a href=\"King%20Hemakar\"&gt;King Hemakar&lt;/a&gt;, including the King himself, and took control of the region in what would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Frostfall%20Coup\"&gt;Frostfall Coup&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, following the unsealing of the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Colossus%20%28Online%20Location%29\"&gt;Halls of Colossus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; re-emerged across Elsweyr, including the north, devastating the local populations. For a time prior to the reappearance of dragons, and since the Frostfall Coup, Northern Elsweyr has been the site of skirmishes between the forces of Euraxia Tharn and the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Elsweyr%20Defense%20Force\"&gt;Northern Elsweyr Defense Force&lt;/a&gt; who seek the liberation of Rimmen and deposition of Usurper-Queen.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Northern Elsweyr and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralised areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nNorthern Elsweyr features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests tie into the &lt;a href=\"Season%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Season of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt; overarching storyline and continues on to &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Elsweyr\"&gt;Southern Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in Northern Elsweyr. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nEighteen Skyshards can be found in Auridon totaling in six &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt;. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nTen books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Northern Elsweyr and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively. There are no lake, saltwater or foulwater sources in Northern Elsweyr."}
