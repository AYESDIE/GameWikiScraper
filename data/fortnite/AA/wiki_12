It was introduced in . \nFunctionality.\nGas Cans are used primarily to refuel different vehicles, but they can also be used as an improvised explosive device.\nWhen used for refueling, pressing the attack button will pour fuel from the can and onto the ground. If the fuel stream connects with a &lt;a href=\"Vehicles%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;vehicle&lt;/a&gt;, it will add the fuel to its tank. When reaching 0 fuel in the can, it is discarded from the inventory. Gas cans have no effect on vehicles which do not require fuel, and the gas will simply spray out without filing the vehicle.\nIt works the same as a Petrol Pump at a &lt;a href=\"Gas%20Stations\"&gt;Gas Station&lt;/a&gt;, but portable. Gas cans can be refueled with one of these pump by holding the can whilst interacting with the pump.\nWhen thrown, by holding the aim button and releasing, it can be easily relocated. Attacking the can with any weapon (including &lt;a href=\"Melee%20Weapons%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;Melee Weapons&lt;/a&gt;) will cause it to ignite, and after around 1 second, it will explode, dealing large amounts of damage to nearby players and structures. This explosion will also start a &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;. Gas Cans can also be shot out of a player's hand, causing them to drop it, with an explosion following. The character\u2019s ears may briefly ring.\nObtained.\nGas Cans can be found in various locations across the map. Oftentimes they are found at Bus Stops, but can also be found at &lt;a href=\"Gas%20Stations\"&gt;Gas Stations&lt;/a&gt; or in areas with vehicles present. They are found as a prop, rather than a regular item (similar to a foraged item) in stacks of 1.\nStats.\nGas Cans use which cannot be obtained outside of the item's reserve. They can hold up to 100 fuel.\n[1] The Damage dealt from a Gas Can will only apply when it explodes. This damage will only apply to opponents and yourself. Furthermore, the explosion cannot eliminate a player, as it will always leave them at 1 HP (The fire it produces however can eliminate any player)."}

However, they weren't, causing Geno to replace them with two of their stronger &lt;a href=\"Snapshots\"&gt;Snapshots&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, he continued his actions by adding more &lt;a href=\"Loopers\"&gt;Loopers&lt;/a&gt; to The Loop and strengthening the IO.\nGeno appears in a picture with a young &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Corny%20Complex\"&gt;Corny Complex&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeno keeps &lt;a href=\"The%20Imagined\"&gt;The Imagined&lt;/a&gt; away from learning the truth about her past, even deleting all files related to The Imagined and &lt;a href=\"The%20Order\"&gt;The Order&lt;/a&gt; from IO servers. &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; stated that he is the one who made plans to end &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt; in the Collision event.\nGeno hires &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Doom\"&gt;Doctor Doom&lt;/a&gt; to help The &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; get rid of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Collision\"&gt;Collision&lt;/a&gt; /.\nGeno calls Slone and tells her to activate &lt;a href=\"The%20Collider\"&gt;The Collider&lt;/a&gt;.

This negates fall damage, and can be used to traverse long distances, at a faster speed than sprinting. This is achieved by pressing the jump button whilst in the air.\nIn a standard game of Battle Royale, Glider Redeploy is off, meaning that a player falling a significant distance will not be able to deploy their glider and float down to safety, instead taking fall damage and potentially being eliminated.\nDepending on the game mode, Glider Redeploy may or may not be enabled. On top of this, some items and vehicles allow the use of glider redeploy.\nSituations that allow Glider Redeploy.\nGame Modes and other.\nThe following means allow for Glider Redeploy:"}

As &lt;a href=\"Fortnite\"&gt;Fortnite&lt;/a&gt; is a huge game with many players and item interactions, oftentimes there may be bugs encountered. Most glitches are accidentally encountered by the player. Each &lt;a href=\"Patch%20Notes\"&gt;game update&lt;/a&gt; can fix glitches but can also introduce new ones to the game. Most glitches are minor and graphical, but some can be game-breaking. Developers can &lt;a href=\"Disabled%20Features\"&gt;disable&lt;/a&gt; the buggy feature to prevent abuse by players. \nReporting Glitches.\nReport glitches within Fortnite using the in-game reporting. Follow these steps:\nGlitches can also be reported using Discord or Reddit.\nLists of Glitches.\nMantle Jump.\nWhen mantling, it is possible to spring up high in the air instead of climbing to the higher platform. Worst cases of this glitch involve being eliminated/knocked from fall damage. This most likely happens with a poor internet connection and high Ping.\nClipping under the ground.\nWhen riding a Vehicle, If the player's pc or console failed to load the ground in time, it may clip under the ground after landing. It is more likely to happen if the Vehicle is going at a very high speed. \nLoot Shark Vehicle launch.\nIf a &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Shark\"&gt;Loot Shark&lt;/a&gt; bites a Vehicle, there is a chance that the Vehicle and the Shark will be sent flying high in the air and way outside of the Battle Royale island. \nBright lights around player model.\nIn , there are some Outfits (such as &lt;a href=\"Polar%20Peely\"&gt;Polar Peely&lt;/a&gt;) that when interacting with a &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Amplifier%20Powerup\"&gt;Damage Amplifier&lt;/a&gt; or Visual Effect devices, the character model will be surrounded with very bright lights instead of the usual glow.\nRocket Riding.\nThis glitch is the oldest and the most popular. It involves jumping on a rocket fired from a &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt; (or any other Explosive Weapon) by another player (usually a teammate). This is normally done in order to travel distances or to have high ground over enemies. The Loading Screen &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Ride\"&gt;Rocket Ride&lt;/a&gt; is a tribute to the glitch.\nUnswimmable Water.\nMany water props (usually a block of water) in Fortnite have broken collision making them unswimmable and sometimes even breakable with pickaxes and weapons. Touching the water can result in either, player's screen turns into a mess or player will clip through ground. These water props can also sometimes stop projectile from certain weapons from moving.\nBroken block of water props can be found in many prefabs of . It is recommended to use &lt;a href=\"Water%20%28Device%29\"&gt;Water (Device)&lt;/a&gt;, or Water Body instead of Water Props.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20Doom\"&gt;Day of Doom&lt;/a&gt; LTM, if an Arcane Artifact somehow landed in a water prop such as &lt;a href=\"Restored%20Reels\"&gt;Restored Reels&lt;/a&gt;' pool, it will become stuck and unpickable. It won't even respawn, an instant guarantee loss for Doom Henchmen's team.\nEnter mission with empty inventory.\nIn , sometimes when entering a mission the player will have an empty inventory (no materials, weapons, etc.) despite having items before. The player also cannot build. There is no fix to this issue as it is related to the connection to the server. Workaround is to simply exit the mission and reconnect.\nRandom disconnect from mission.\nIn Save the World, the player may disconnect from the mission unexpectedly with the error \"Network Connection Lost\" despite having a stable connection. According to Epic Games, this is mostly triggered when the player's Backpack is nearly full.\nPatched but Notable.\nHealth Bar glitch.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Update%20v21.40\"&gt;Update v21.40&lt;/a&gt; there was a glitch with the &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;Heath and Shield meter&lt;/a&gt; where if a player takes damage, the bar may not match with the numerical value. As the bar is more noticeable than the number, this misleads players affecting their decision to fight or heal. This was patched in &lt;a href=\"Update%20v21.50\"&gt;Update v21.50&lt;/a&gt;.\nOff-Road Tires glitch.\nIntroduced in &lt;a href=\"Update%20v19.20\"&gt;Update v19.20&lt;/a&gt;, there was a glitch where throwing at props, it would throw them away no matter what it's thrown onto. This glitch also worked on the Mighty Monument statue, and was abused by many players to cause a lot of lag. This was fixed a day after the update. This glitch was immortalized when stacks of Vehicle Mod: Off-Road Tires can be found around Mighty Monument.\nObtain Alien Knockgun Launcher.\nIt was possible to use the &lt;a href=\"Alien%20Knockgun%20Launcher\"&gt;Alien Knockgun Launcher&lt;/a&gt; outside of The Experiment when playing in team based modes. It will not deal damage and its knock back ability will not grant a low-gravity effect. In response to this glitch, Abductors were disabled on August 14th 2021 and lasted 10 days.\nSand Tunneling.\nAt the beginning of , &lt;a href=\"Sand%20Tunneling\"&gt;Sand Tunneling&lt;/a&gt; was introduced. This mechanic was buggy and was disabled as it caused a player's viewpoint to be de-synced with their actual location, meaning that throwing items or shooting came from an area different to the location of the character model. It can also cause the player to be invisible. \nShadow Stone invisibility.\nThere was a chance that when using a &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Stone\"&gt;Shadow Stone&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Flopper\"&gt;Shadow Flopper&lt;/a&gt;) players became invisible when using them.\nShopping Cart.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Shopping%20Cart\"&gt;Shopping Cart&lt;/a&gt; was the first Vehicle added to Battle Royale. It was notorious for being buggy. One of the bugs with the vehicle was to use a &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt; to propel the Shopping Cart."}

They were first introduced in , they are an estate agency owned by the wealthy vampire &lt;a href=\"Kado%20Thorne\"&gt;Kado Thorne&lt;/a&gt;. It's unknown if they were founded on the Island by Thorne to act as a front for his stronghold or if they were already active eons ago.\nThey are the main antagonists of .\nOverview.\nEclipse is an organization acting as an estate agency, hiding their true objective of draining the Island's wealth and treasures to fund their opulent properties.\nLocations and Members.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nBoss Weapons.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nHistory.\nUnknown Time Period.\nKado Thorne travels across Time and The Omniverse with his &lt;a href=\"Time%20Machine\"&gt;Time Machine&lt;/a&gt; in search of new artifacts for his collection. Eons ago, &lt;a href=\"The%20Ancients\"&gt;The Ancients&lt;/a&gt; encountered him on one of his travels. They feared him so much that they created &lt;a href=\"The%20Apparatus\"&gt;The Apparatus&lt;/a&gt;, with the purpose to predict his arrival so they can make escape plans before it. Thorne's havoc across space and time caused him to became target of many vampire hunters, including the dark fae known as &lt;a href=\"Shimmerdusk\"&gt;Shimmerdusk&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ruins of the Ancients were discovered after the central part of the Island collapsed, revealing a huge underground rainforest. The ruins revealed the arrival of Kado Thorne through murals, glyphs and The Apparatus announcing an &lt;a href=\"The%20Eclipse\"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt; that should be astrologically impossible.\nKado Thorne and Eclipse arrived on the Island and began to drain all the island's resources to build resorts, which are actually very well protected strongholds to house Thorne's collection and his Time Machine, which he wanted to use to collect items from Reality Zero's past as well as for a more sinister plan. They also took control of &lt;a href=\"Rumble%20Ruins\"&gt;Rumble Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, and bought one of &lt;a href=\"MEGA%20City\"&gt;MEGA City's&lt;/a&gt; luxury restaurants as well as &lt;a href=\"Slappy%20Shores\"&gt;Slappy Shores'&lt;/a&gt; main Slap Factory, all of which they transformed into highly defended strongholds. They also took control of the &lt;a href=\"Forecast%20Towers\"&gt;Forecast Towers&lt;/a&gt;.\nAround this time, &lt;a href=\"Shimmerdusk\"&gt;Shimmerdusk&lt;/a&gt; arrives on the island to continue her hunt of Thorne.\nLater, in an attempt to steal the Time Machine, &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Slone&lt;/a&gt; formed a &lt;a href=\"The%20Heist%20Crew\"&gt;Heist Crew&lt;/a&gt; consisting of &lt;a href=\"Nolan%20Chance\"&gt;Nolan Chance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Antonia\"&gt;Antonia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Piper%20Pace\"&gt;Piper Pace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fish%20Thicc\"&gt;Fish Thicc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mae\"&gt;Mae&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Khaby%20Lame\"&gt;Khaby Lame&lt;/a&gt;. During a heist attempt, the crew breaks into &lt;a href=\"Eclipsed%20Estate\"&gt;Eclipsed Estate&lt;/a&gt; and fights through multiple Commanding Cards before arriving at the Vault. Thorne then exited the Time Machine and found the intruders. After discovering them, Thorne transforms into his Revenant Form and tries to kill them, forcing the crew to flee.\nAfter the Heist Crew's failure to steal the Time Machine, Thorne uses his Psionic powers to cause &lt;a href=\"The%20Eclipse\"&gt;The Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;, which began with a permanent Super Blood Moon and Solar Eclipse. After that, Thorne remained in his Revenant form to protect his Time Machine himself. He also established his next target, \"2018 07 12\" the period of &lt;a href=\"Season%205\"&gt;Season 5&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena Island&lt;/a&gt; undergoes \u201cWorlds Collide.\u201d However his plan wasn't about obtaining items for his collection, but something more sinister that is currently unrevealed. \nHowever, after a second attempt, the Heist Crew managed to successfully steal the machine and take it to &lt;a href=\"The%20Getaway%20%28Landmark%29\"&gt;their base&lt;/a&gt; before Thorne's plan could take form.\nWith the Time Machine stolen, Shimmerdusk was free to make her move onto her plan to assassinate Thorne. Throughout the &lt;a href=\"Fortnitemares%202023%20Quests\"&gt;Fortnitemares 2023 Quests&lt;/a&gt;, she enlists the help of &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; to prepare. She has them stock up on ammo, eliminate Thorne's Guards and Eclipse Agents, smash Thorne's valuables, etc. After weeks of preparing, she decides that they were ready and infiltrated his vault. She sends the Looper to battle Kado, and they successfully take him down. With Thorne dead, she declares that he will \"no longer prey across time and space.\"\nThe fate of Eclipse and it's agents after Thorne's defeat is unknown.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Bang\"&gt;The Big Bang&lt;/a&gt;, various things such as the items from Kado Thorne's collection in &lt;a href=\"Cloistered%20Castle\"&gt;Cloistered Castle&lt;/a&gt; as well as a painting of him placed just above a bed imply that Thorne has somehow returned despite his presumed death at the hand of &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shimmerdusk\"&gt;Shimmerdusk&lt;/a&gt;, and has migrated to &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt; with the remnants of his collection. \n&lt;a href=\"Eclipse\"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt; opened a small restaurant at &lt;a href=\"Restored%20Reels\"&gt;Restored Reels&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is a modified version of the &lt;a href=\"Grenade%20Launcher\"&gt;Grenade Launcher&lt;/a&gt;.\nFunctionality.\nThe Egg Launcher shoots out an egg projectile which is affected by gravity and sticks to surfaces, but not players. After a short time the egg explodes dealing explosive damage to players and structures. This egg can deal damage to the player who shot it. These eggs deal more damage to structures than they do players, and cannot headshot.\nStats.\nThe Egg Launcher ranges from dealing 67 Damage per shot to 77 Damage per shot (67 - 77 Damage per Second). The Egg Launcher uses and cannot headshot players.\nThe Egg Launcher shoots a Slow Moving Projectile. It has First Shot Accuracy enabled, but as it is an Explosive Weapon, it is largely irrelevant. There is no damage falloff on the Egg Launcher's projectiles, but they will bounce, and stick to surfaces for a short time before exploding.\nObtained.\n\"When the item was last available in Chapter 3: Season 2.\"\nDepending on when it was introduced, the Egg Launcher either replaced the Grenade Launcher, like in &lt;a href=\"Season%203\"&gt;Season 3&lt;/a&gt;, or it is introduced as its own weapon, like in and Chapter 3: Season 2.\nWeapon ID.\nThe Egg Launcher is referred to as Launcher Egg in the files. \nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nFormer Icons.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

It describes how a player is removed from the playable game, unless they are &lt;a href=\"Rebooting\"&gt;Rebooted&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nElimination is the act of removing all of a player's &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;hitpoints&lt;/a&gt;. Elimination in solo modes is immediate, but in Squad based modes (&lt;a href=\"Duos\"&gt;Duos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trios\"&gt;Trios&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Squads\"&gt;Squads&lt;/a&gt;), players are instead \"knocked\". Eliminated players drop all of their items onto the ground, plus a small amount of &lt;a href=\"Bars\"&gt;Bars&lt;/a&gt;. In Squad based modes, players also drop a Reboot Card, which can be used to reboot a player and bring them back into the game. Players can be eliminated through several different methods, whether self inflicted, by a squad member, or by an opponent.\nEliminated players can spectate other players in their squad, if the squad remains, or any player left if the squad has been eliminated. Eliminated players will show in the &lt;a href=\"Elimination%20Feed\"&gt;Elimination Feed&lt;/a&gt; upon being eliminated. If a player knocks an opponent, they will receive elimination credit upon their elimination, regardless of who eliminates the knocked player (This is not shown in the Elimination Feed).\n&lt;a href=\"AIs\"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt;, such as bosses, or &lt;a href=\"henchmen\"&gt;henchmen&lt;/a&gt;, can be knocked.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Team%20Rumble\"&gt;Team Rumble&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Team Rumble, despite being a squad based mode, players do not get knocked, but instead die immediately as respawning is enabled. Furthermore, players will not drop any inventory items, and ammo and bars will spawn from where they were eliminated, rather than being deducted from said player's resources.\nIn Fortnitemares 2020, players would not be knocked, and even in solo modes they would turn into a &lt;a href=\"Shadows\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt;. Players could then obtain a &lt;a href=\"Victory%20Royale\"&gt;Victory Royale&lt;/a&gt; by working with other shadows to eliminate all remaining players.\nKnocked State.\nKnocked State, also referred to as Down-but-not-out is a state in which the player goes into when eliminated in a standard squad based mode. Knocked players cannot use items or use any &lt;a href=\"movement\"&gt;movement&lt;/a&gt; abilities aside from basic movement, and basic swimming. Players that are knocked recieve invulnerability for several seconds after being knocked to ensure they are not eliminated instantly. Knocked players have 100 health, which is deducted at a rate of 2 health per second. This health can be extended by &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Items\"&gt;healing&lt;/a&gt; the knocked player by means of a &lt;a href=\"Campfire\"&gt;Campfire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chug%20Splash\"&gt;Chug Splash&lt;/a&gt; or any other item which lets players heal other players. Knocked players cannot have Shield, but if they are eliminated by means of &lt;a href=\"Gravity\"&gt;fall damage&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;storm&lt;/a&gt; damage, they will gain the shield back after being revived. Players are revived with 30 health, regardless of how much health they had prior to being knocked.\nKnocked players are revived by holding the interact button for 10 seconds on a knocked player. The more players who aid the revive, the faster the player will be back to a living state. Knocked players can also be carried and thrown."}

It can be unlocked in all four Base Game &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Save%20the%20World%29\"&gt;Locations&lt;/a&gt; after completing the 10th &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Shield\"&gt;Storm Shield Defense&lt;/a&gt; in each.\nOverview.\nEndurance is a 30-wave long defense mission that requires players to repeatedly defend the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Shield\"&gt;Storm Shield&lt;/a&gt; and its Amplifiers. If the Storm Shield or any Amplifier is destroyed at any point during the defense, the mission ends. Each wave becomes progressively harder, featuring a mix of different &lt;a href=\"Monsters%20%28Save%20The%20World%29\"&gt;enemy types&lt;/a&gt; in increasing numbers. The preparation time between each wave decreases, but the wave lengths gradually increase, starting from 2 minutes 30 seconds on Wave 1, to 6 minutes per wave by the end. Certain waves have a pre-determined &lt;a href=\"Elements\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; spawn, while some others feature select &lt;a href=\"Wargames\"&gt;Wargames Modifiers&lt;/a&gt; like Torn Apart, Space Rocks, Invasion, etc.\nStonewood.\n&lt;a href=\"Stonewood\"&gt;Stonewood&lt;/a&gt; has 4 Amplifiers and has the easiest Endurance Defense out of all four. The defense begins with Power Level 17 &lt;a href=\"Monsters%20%28Save%20The%20World%29\"&gt;Husks&lt;/a&gt; and rises to Power Level 33 by the final wave. The Power Level increases significantly if there are more players in the mission.\nPlankerton.\n&lt;a href=\"Plankerton\"&gt;Plankerton&lt;/a&gt; has 5 Amplifiers and has an Endurance Defense harder than &lt;a href=\"Stonewood\"&gt;Stonewood&lt;/a&gt;'s, but easier than the rest. The defense begins with Power Level 41 &lt;a href=\"Monsters%20%28Save%20The%20World%29\"&gt;Husks&lt;/a&gt; and rises to Power Level 62 by Wave 7. The Power Level increases significantly if there are more players in the mission.\nCanny Valley.\n&lt;a href=\"Canny%20Valley\"&gt;Canny Valley&lt;/a&gt; has 4 Amplifiers and has the second hardest Endurance Defense. The defense begins with Power Level 69 &lt;a href=\"Monsters%20%28Save%20The%20World%29\"&gt;Husks&lt;/a&gt; and rises to Power Level 112 by the final wave. The Power Level increases significantly if there are more players in the mission. Building for Canny Valley Endurance Defense might be tricky since the natural terrain and elevation around the entire zone creates for interesting spawns with harder tunnels to build, with blockades being more essential and critical.\nTwine Peaks.\n&lt;a href=\"Twine%20Peaks\"&gt;Twine Peaks&lt;/a&gt; has 9 Amplifiers and has the hardest Endurance Defense. The defense begins with Power Level 127 &lt;a href=\"Monsters%20%28Save%20The%20World%29\"&gt;Husks&lt;/a&gt; and rises to Power Level 410 by the final wave. The Power Level increases significantly if there are more players in the mission. Building for Twine Peaks Endurance Defense is significantly harder since there are more amplifiers with multiple directions to build for. Natural hazards such as Lava Bombs are also introduced which have to be accounted for, as they will severely destroy your tunnels. The Building Limit is much easier to reach, and can be tricky to work around.\n&lt;a href=\"Lobber\"&gt;Lobbers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sploder\"&gt;Sploders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Smasher\"&gt;Smashers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flinger\"&gt;Flingers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mini-Bosses\"&gt;Mini-Bosses&lt;/a&gt; pose a greater threat to tunnels and are the most common cause for unsuccessful attempts."}

When you\u2019re not dealing with waves of enemies, deal with the outbreak of wildlife.

How long can you Survive the Horde?This new mode is coming to Save the World on May 2 and will be available until the end of the Scurvy Shoals Venture season (June 21, 2023, at 8 PM ET).\nNew Map\nIn Survive the Horde, you\u2019ll be well beyond the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Shield\"&gt;Storm Shield&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 at an old mining operation on a volcanic island.\nThe approaching Storm has split the island asunder, and you\u2019ll have to navigate across deep fissures full of lava as you traverse the island. You\u2019ll be defending three resource bases on the island \u2014 the Mine, Cavern, and Depot \u2014 with limited time to rush between them during breaks in the waves of enemies. Investing some resources in bridging these chasms will certainly be worthwhile!\nGather Supplies\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt; is closing in fast, so there\u2019s no time to harvest. Breaking down objects with your &lt;a href=\"Pickaxe\"&gt;Pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; won\u2019t yield any resources, which means you\u2019ll be reliant on the &lt;a href=\"Supply%20Drop%20%28Save%20the%20World%29\"&gt;Supply Drop&lt;/a&gt;s that appear between each enemy wave. These Supply Drops will deliver your weapons, ammo, and ingredients. Can you survive on these limited supplies alone? It\u2019s time to find out.\nBuild and Craft\nBuild a fort, surround it with traps, and craft weapons to defend each of the three resource bases. If one of the resource bases is taken down, you\u2019ll receive fewer Supply Drops, and if all three are lost, then the expedition will cease! Use your resources and the time between waves wisely.\nDefeat the Horde\nSurvive 15 waves of increasingly tougher enemies. Look out for Horde Waves where a strong enemy type will show up en masse, and for gameplay modifiers that can appear during a wave to mix things up! If you\u2019re reduced to 0 Health, your allies will only have a short amount of time to get you back up and into fray, and if your entire team goes down, the expedition will fail.\nKnown Issue: \"We\u2019re aware that Smashers may attack the objectives and are working to resolve this issue in a future update. We\u2019ll provide an update in the Bug Fixes section once this is resolved.\"\nQuests and Rewards\nThere\u2019s a set of Horde Quests for you to complete, including &lt;a href=\"Daily%20Quests\"&gt;Daily Quests&lt;/a&gt; that reward Battle Pass XP and Quests that reward Banner Icons and Sprays! There\u2019s also two Challenge Quests for Survive the Horde, which add difficult gameplay modifiers\u2026 but grant extra cosmetic rewards and Battle Pass XP upon completion.\nChallenge Week 1 - Hasty Husks (May 3 - May 10)\nDamaging and eliminating enemies will just make the Horde move in more quickly! Even worse, if they get close enough to start damaging you, they\u2019ll start healing themselves. Focus fire to try to take them out quickly (and preferably at a distance!).\nChallenge Week 1 - Hasty Husks (May 3 - May 10)\nRanged weapons and ammo from Supply Drops are limited, and any ranged attacks made against Husks will ricochet off and also damage you. But on the bright side, your Trap damage and melee attack speed will be boosted, so put away those guns, craft some extra Traps, and start swinging!\nBrawl of the Wild Returns - May 3 at 8 PM ET.\nFrom May 3 at 8 PM ET to May 31, the Homebase crew will once again need your help dealing with a wildlife outbreak! In the returning Brawl of the Wild questline, do whatever it takes to defeat the creatures, whether that means hunting them, taming them, or even electronically communicating with them. Completing this questline will reward you with the Hero Gia! \nGia\n\u201cI\u2019ll show you how to run with wolves.\u201d - Gia\nEvent and Weekly Store.\nThe Powder Keg - May 3 at 8 PM ET\nDon\u2019t let the Husks mess with ye plunder \u2014 drop the &lt;a href=\"Powder%20Keg\"&gt;Powder Keg&lt;/a&gt; on them with this loaded Bow.

{"id": "127363", "revid": "46495082", "url": "https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki?curid=127363", "title": "Update v24.40", "text": "&lt;tabber&gt;\nHey everyone!\nYou\u2019ve long been leveling up in Fortnite Battle Royale \u2014 now it\u2019s almost time to \"rank up\". Starting in Fortnite v24.40, Battle Royale and Zero Build will each have a &lt;a href=\"Ranked\"&gt;Ranked&lt;/a&gt; option! Enable Ranked and begin your journey of reaching \u201cSilver,\u201d \u201cGold,\u201d \u201cPlatinum,\u201d or beyond.\nBefore beginning your journey through the ranks, learn more about Ranked play:\nRanked Fortnite Battle Royale FAQ.\nWhat will the Ranks be?\nThe Ranks will span across Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Elite, Champion, and Unreal. Bronze through Diamond will have three ranks, while Elite, Champion, and Unreal will have one. Climb the ranks of Bronze to reach Silver, then climb the ranks of Silver to reach Gold. Do the same in Gold, Platinum, and Diamond to reach Elite!\nOnce you reach Elite, prove yourself against other highly-skilled players to advance to Champion, and then finally to Unreal.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nWill there be any sort of Season system?\nThe debut of Ranked in v24.40 will be the start of Ranked Season Zero. Season Zero lasts until the end of Battle Royale Chapter 4 Season 3. We\u2019ll be using this time to make any adjustments to issues and concerns that arise, while also working on additional features and overall improvements for when Ranked starts following the normal Battle Royale Season schedule.\nTo track the status of bugs that come to our attention, you can keep tabs on our &lt;a href=\"https%3A//trello.com/b/Bs7hgkma/fortnite-community-issues\"&gt;Fortnite | Community Issues Trello Board&lt;/a&gt; (English language only).\n&lt;hr&gt;\nWhat will my starting ranks be in Season Zero?\nYour starting Battle Royale rank and Zero Build rank in Season Zero will be based on your past match performance, as well as your performance in your first Ranked Battle Royale and Ranked Zero Build match. For Battle Royale and Zero Build, you\u2019ll only need to play one Ranked match to have your rank revealed. \n&lt;hr&gt;\nIs there anything special about reaching Unreal?\nOnce you reach Unreal, you\u2019ll stay in Unreal for that Ranked Season. This means you won\u2019t return to previous ranks for the rest of the Season no matter your future performance. So does that mean you\u2019re done when you reach Unreal? Nope! Upon reaching Unreal, you\u2019ll be given a number signifying your standing among Unreal players globally. Keep performing well in Ranked matches to raise your number and be among the best players in the world!\nYou\u2019ll see your Unreal position in Battle Royale and/or Zero Build on the Unreal leaderboard, which will be live on fortnite.com/ranked/leaderboard. This leaderboard will update regularly and display participants\u2019 Epic display name and Unreal position, so you can flex on the competition.\nPlayers can opt out of being displayed on the leaderboard by turning \u201cPublic Game Stats\u201d off in the \u201cGameplay Privacy\u201d section of Fortnite\u2019s in-game Account and Privacy settings.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nHow will ranking up work?\nIn the Lobby, if you have \u201cRanked\u201d set to \u201cOn,\u201d you\u2019ll see your current rank on the left of the screen. You\u2019ll also see a progress bar indicating how far you are from advancing to the next rank or returning to the previous one. \nHow much the progress bar increases or recedes after a match will depend on the following factors:\nTeams will be treated as a single unit \u2014 all team members will gain and lose progress equally based on team eliminations and team placement calculated at the end of a match.\nYour team\u2019s rank will be determined by the highest-ranked player on the team. For example, if a team is made up of Gold I and Silver I players, they\u2019ll matchmake as a Gold I team and play against similarly-ranked teams.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nWhich modes will support Ranked?\nIn v24.40, Ranked will start off with the following Battle Royale and Zero Build mode(s) supported:\nBattle Royale\nZero Build\nYou\u2019ll have separate ranks for both Battle Royale and Zero Build.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nHow will Ranked matchmaking work?\nIf you\u2019re playing in Solo, you\u2019ll be matched against opponents of the same or similar rank as you.\nIf you\u2019re playing in Duos or Squads, your team will have a \u201cparty rank.\u201d Your party rank will be equivalent to the rank of the highest-ranked teammate. Your team will be matched against teams with the same or similar party rank. \nPlayers can jump into Ranked matches no matter which matchmaking region they\u2019re using.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nWill there be any gameplay differences between Ranked matches and non-Ranked matches?\nTurning on Ranked will put you against other players who have Ranked enabled. You can expect all the loot and other gameplay features that are enabled in traditional Battle Royale and Zero Build to be enabled in Ranked Season Zero as we continue to monitor and evaluate the Ranked player experience. With this in mind, we\u2019ll be making the following balance changes in v24.40:\n&lt;hr&gt;\nCan new Fortnite players play in Ranked matches?\nRanked play is meant for both new and veteran Fortnite players. To make sure new players are warmed up, players with Epic accounts that have never been used to log into Fortnite will have to complete a specific Quest (Outlast 500 opponents) before they can enable the Ranked option.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nCan new Fortnite players play in Ranked matches?\nWhen you jump off the Battle Bus in a Ranked match, you\u2019ll be given a Ranked Urgent Quest. By completing Ranked Urgent Quests, you\u2019ll unlock Seasonal cosmetic rewards. A new Ranked Urgent Quest is given every match, and Ranked Urgent Quest progress does not carry over between matches.\nBurn Bright Emote\nCelebrate your success! The final cosmetic reward of Season Zero is the &lt;a href=\"Burn%20Bright\"&gt;Burn Bright&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Emote\"&gt;Emote&lt;/a&gt;. Activate this Emote to show off your current rank color (Bronze, Silver, Gold, etc.).\n&lt;hr&gt;\nHow will Ranked affect Competitive?\nWith the addition of Ranked, Arena has been discontinued in v24.40. The remaining tournaments for Battle Royale , except for the Console Champions Cup, will not have a rank requirement for eligibility. Players will need to reach Platinum I rank or higher in Ranked Battle Royale to be eligible to compete in the Console Champions Cup on May 23.\nNext Battle Royale Season, your rank will, among other factors, be an eligibility requirement for Epic-hosted tournaments. This includes tournaments for cosmetic prizes like Icon Series Cups, as well as tournaments for cash prizes such as FNCS competitions. As with all other eligibility requirements, the specific rank requirements for a given tournament will be listed in the official rules for that tournament. \n\"Please note: Epic-hosted tournaments may have different loot and other gameplay features than other matches. Performance will always be the top priority for tournaments.\"\n&lt;hr&gt;\nMore Coming in v24.40: Balance Changes.\nAs mentioned above, we\u2019ll be making the following balance changes in v24.40:\nAlso, in case you missed it, we made the following balance changes in a hotfix on May 3 ET:\nMay 16 Update: Trios Vault.\nPlease note that the &lt;a href=\"Trios\"&gt;Trios&lt;/a&gt; mode will be vaulted in and in v24.40.\nMay 17 Update: Cosmetic Streaming for Mobile and PC.\nOn mobile and PC, we\u2019ve extended the High Resolution Textures setting to give players more control over which content they download and when.\nBy default, players will stream most cosmetic items as they are encountered rather than install or patch them upfront. This will get players into Fortnite faster and reduce Fortnite\u2019s install size. \nPlease note we\u2019re still making improvements to this feature. In v24.40, players on PC will be able to download all high resolution textures at once if they wish. PC players can opt out of streaming by selecting \u201cDisable Cosmetic Streaming\u201d through the Options menu on the Fortnite tile in the Epic Games Launcher.\nSome things to keep in mind with High Resolution Textures:\nThe v24.40 update brings 32 new consumable item resources and the &lt;a href=\"Chug%20Cannon\"&gt;Chug Cannon&lt;/a&gt; weapon to Creative, plus new visual customizations for &lt;a href=\"vehicle\"&gt;vehicle&lt;/a&gt;s spawned by the Sport Bike and &lt;a href=\"Dirt%20Bike%20Spawner\"&gt;Dirt Bike Spawner&lt;/a&gt;s. This update also brings a prop device version of the &lt;a href=\"Mounted%20Turret\"&gt;Mounted Turret&lt;/a&gt;, as well as new Ballercoaster Galleries.\nCreator Pages are Live!\nNow players can see all of your islands in one place by clicking More From This Creator in Discover. This links out to your Creator page in Creator Portal. As you publish islands using Creator Portal, your Creator Page is automatically updated.

Pics. TM Hasbro.\nWith the Fortnite v25.00 update, we are combining highlights for Creative, UEFN, and Verse into one patch notes document. Patch notes will continue being published biweekly in Creator News on the Creator Portal. You can now find &lt;a href=\"%23UEFN\"&gt;bug fixes for Creative, UEFN, and Verse&lt;/a&gt; in our documentation on the Epic Developer Community site. This will be our format for Fortnite Ecosystem creation tool updates moving forward, so let's dive in!\nDirect Event Binding Reminder.\nIn the v25.00 update, direct event binding is now turned on for all islands made using the Creative toolset. For more information, see &lt;a href=\"https%3A//dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/getting-started-with-direct-event-binding-in-fortnite-creative\"&gt;Getting Started with Direct Event Binding&lt;/a&gt; in our official documentation.\nUpgraded Devices Reminder.\nFor some time now in Creative, you have been able to manually convert your islands to upgraded devices, by going to the Tools tab of My Island and clicking the Upgrade Devices button. Starting in a future update, new Creative islands will use upgraded devices by default. These devices are the same ones used by UEFN and provide improvements over the original devices, including:\nWe'd love to hear about any concerns or issues you've had with the upgraded devices, so we can make the conversion as smooth as possible.\nWelcome Hub Change.\nTo make sure creators have a smooth and consistent experience when entering Creative, the Welcome Hub is changing to a new Epic-created default hub starting today.\nThanks for all the time and effort you put into the amazing Hubs you've submitted over the years. We hope to see you use those amazing design skills in your creations in the months and years to come!\nGrind Rails.\n&lt;a href=\"Grind%20Rails\"&gt;Grind Rails&lt;/a&gt; from Battle Royale Chapter 4 can now be added to islands using the Creative toolset or UEFN. The spline defining the rail's path can be edited directly in UEFN, or it can be edited with the Phone tool in Creative.\nGrind Rail devices in Creative are similar to AI Patrol Path devices in that they have two nodes (called Control Points for this device) when first placed, and require at least two. Use the Phone tool's Copy function to add a new Control Point to the rail, and the Cut function to move a Control Point. To safely remove one or more Control Points, use the Phone tool to select them first, then delete. \nRotating a Control Point adjusts the direction of the grind rail as it goes through that point, which creates a curve. The Tangent Intensity option can be customized for each Control Point to adjust how rounded the curve is. You can also customize the color of each rail.\nNew Items in Creative Inventory and UEFN Content Browser.\nNew Bouncer Added\nNew Weapons\nNew Events for Prop-o-Matic Manager.\nThree new events have been added to the upgraded version of the &lt;a href=\"Prop-O-Matic%20Manager\"&gt;Prop-O-Matic Manager&lt;/a&gt;:\nAdd Materials to Landscapes in UEFN.\nYou can now &lt;a href=\"https%3A//dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/editing-landscape-material-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite\"&gt;create custom landscape materials&lt;/a&gt; and use these materials to improve the quality and shading of your environment.

The game has three teams \u2014 Infiltrators, Attackers, and Defenders.\nYou can customize the size of each team, and each team has different weapons.By balancing these teams asymmetrically, you can precisely control their power level.\nNew Documentation for Creating In-Game User Interfaces.\nWe reworked the existing Creating In-Game UI page to be a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/creating-in-game-ui-in-verse\"&gt;section&lt;/a&gt; at the top level of our official documentation, with multiple pages for each topic. This will help you find tutorials when you want to add in-game user interfaces to your island.\nWriting Code in Verse Tutorial Update.\nA new Lesson is available in our series Learn the Basics of Writing Code in Verse! &lt;a href=\"https%3A//dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/learn-code-basics-9-failure-in-verse\"&gt;Lesson 9: Failure and Control Flow&lt;/a&gt; explains the unique concept of failure in Verse. Learn why failure is a necessary part of programming, and how Verse lets you write code that safely rolls back instead of crashing your program.\nBuild a Game Tutorials Update.\nWe went through the UEFN tutorials under &lt;a href=\"https%3A//dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/build-a-game-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite\"&gt;Build a Game&lt;/a&gt; and broke them out into separate documents for each step, and in the process also made sure they\u2019re up-to-date.

Because it\u2019s so durable, be sure to choose your placement carefully!\nWhile the Ice Wall boasts enormous defense capabilities, it\u2019s plenty useful when attacking too. Drop one in the midst of a brawl and watch as everyone is knocked back with icy feet, causing them to slip and slide around. The Ice Wall item will be available until the end of the Season, giving you plenty of time to master its chilling effects. \nHow can you wield Todoroki\u2019s powerful quirk in the first place?

Inside each box sits eight gloriously cheesy slices to share with your party, or you can scarf \u2018em all down while you hole up in a bush. We won\u2019t tattle.\nEach Pizza Party slice will restore Health and Shield simultaneously. The recipe\u2019s been changed up a bit, though, as each slice now restores less Health but more Shield, with the Shield cap being 100.\nThe Pizza Party item can be bought from Piper Pace, picked up off the ground, or looted from Chests.

As usual with a new Season, everyone\u2019s rank has been reset in Chapter 4 Season OG to provide a fresh start for all players. \nAlso as usual, you\u2019ll only need to play one Ranked match in Chapter 4 Season OG to have your rank revealed (one match per Battle Royale and Zero Build). Your performance in your first match does not determine your initial rank placement. Rather, it reveals your rank and then updates your rank progress bar based on your performance in the match.\nRanked Matchmaking Test\nIn the higher ranks? It\u2019s expected that matchmaking may take a little longer than if you were in a lower rank. We recently began a test to help get you in a match faster in Ranked. Specifically, lobbies with 80+ players will begin a match if matchmaking is taking a while. As we monitor, we may adjust the threshold of players and the time passed it takes for a match to begin.\nAnother aim of this test is fairer matches for higher-ranked players, by tightening the range of players able to join a match.\nFaster Rank Progression in Fortnite OG\nWith Fortnite OG being a short Season, rank progression will be faster at the higher and middle ranks to accommodate. Players will be penalized less for being eliminated early in a match, and will have slightly faster increases to their rank progression bar. Keep aiming for Unreal!\nAdditionally, we\u2019ve made progression faster for players in the Bronze ranks, so friends queuing up together across ranks will see more consistent progression.\nReminiscent Ranked Reward\nWhen you jump off the Battle Bus in a Ranked match, you\u2019ll be given a Ranked Urgent Quest. By completing certain amounts of Ranked Urgent Quests, you\u2019ll unlock in-game rewards! Unlock the Chapter 1-inspired &lt;a href=\"Ranker%27s%20Tags\"&gt;Ranker's Tags&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Back%20Bling\"&gt;Back Bling&lt;/a&gt; by completing just one Ranked Urgent Quest during Fortnite OG. \nRanker\u2019s Tags will display the color of the highest rank you've reached this Season. Proud of the rank you reached? Show it off in this Season and beyond!\nClassically Competitive.\nDon\u2019t let a reverse in time mean a reverse in competitive drive. Learn about Fortnite OG\u2019s competitive offerings, including Ranked Cups, at our &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.fortnite.com/competitive/news/fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-4-season-og-competitive-details\"&gt;Fortnite OG Competitive Details blog post&lt;/a&gt;!\n\"The &lt;a href=\"Competitor%27s%20Skyblades\"&gt;Competitor's Skyblades&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Competitor%27s%20Time%20Brella\"&gt;Competitor's Time Brella&lt;/a&gt;, earnable Glider rewards from Ranked Cups.\"\nPlease note that not every Fortnite OG feature will be in tournaments.

In these cases, players will notice a new icon in their Locker and in the Item Shop indicating which Outfits and accessories cannot be equipped inside islands below a certain ratings threshold. \nIf a player equips one of these items and joins an island below the designated rating threshold, their equipped item will appear as an item that\u2019s compatible with the island\u2019s rating.

Pick up a &lt;a href=\"Ballistic%20Shield\"&gt;Ballistic Shield&lt;/a&gt; which includes a pistol, then defend yourself with the shield while shooting the pistol at the same time! The Ballistic Shield has infinite Health, but it can only withstand so much damage before it\u2019ll temporarily be knocked from in front of you. \nThe shield itself is also a weapon \u2014 charge into enemies to deal damage and knock \u2018em back! Your enemies in hiding? Charge into a building piece to wear it down and make your unwelcome entry.\nIsland Arsenal.\nThe Ballistic Shield is just one of the new weapons in Chapter 5. Want your new suite of SMGs, ARs, and more? Chapter 5 introduces the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20Pump%20Shotgun\"&gt;Hammer Pump Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frenzy%20Auto%20Shotgun\"&gt;Frenzy Auto Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nemesis%20AR\"&gt;Nemesis AR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Striker%20AR\"&gt;Striker AR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Burst%20SMG\"&gt;Thunder Burst SMG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20SMG\"&gt;Hyper SMG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reaper%20Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Reaper Sniper Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20Pistol\"&gt;Ranger Pistol&lt;/a&gt;:\nGrapple Blade\nWhile others party at Ritzy Riviera, study the blade. Fortunately, the &lt;a href=\"Grapple%20Blade\"&gt;Grapple Blade&lt;/a&gt; is pretty simple. Aim at a hard surface or another player, then grapple to your target! If you grapple to a player, attack with the blade to deal melee damage. Get enough practice with the Grapple Blade to pull off masterful maneuvers!\n\"Also a great mobility item, use a Grapple Blade if there\u2019s no car around.\"\nCluster Clinger\nThis explosive explodes explosives. Throw a sticky &lt;a href=\"Cluster%20Clinger\"&gt;Cluster Clinger&lt;/a&gt; on a surface or player, then after a short delay, watch it pop out smaller explosives. Cut and run when someone throws a Cluster.\nModify Your Weapons.\n\u201cCustomize your loadout\u201d now has a whole new meaning. Located in vaults are &lt;a href=\"Mod%20Benches\"&gt;Mod Benches&lt;/a&gt;, which have mods available for many weapons in exchange for Bars. Add mods that reduce recoil, increase mag capacity, and more! Save up your Bars wisely, though, as not every mod works with every weapon.\nYou don\u2019t need a Mod Bench to wield a modded weapon. In fact, most mod-compatible weapons are already modded! If it\u2019s of Uncommon rarity, it\u2019ll already have one mod. If it\u2019s of Rare rarity, it\u2019ll have two mods. Epic rarity, three mods. And Legendary, four. If you want different mods than the ones that came with your weapon, you can still replace them at Mod Benches in exchange for Bars. Experiment with different combos to see what\u2019s best for you!\nMod-compatible weapons aren\u2019t for sale from Characters or Vending Machines, so keep your eyes \"peeled\" for loot.\nFlow-t On.\nThe new Island yields a new fruit! Upon consumption, a &lt;a href=\"Consumables\"&gt;FlowBerry&lt;/a&gt; will recover a bit of your and your nearby teammates\u2019 Shield. FlowBerries are best eaten before a jump, as they also grant you and your nearby teammates a temporary low-gravity effect (with fall damage immunity).\nA Medkit Miracle and Shield Potion Surprise.\n&lt;a href=\"Med%20Kit\"&gt;Medkits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Potion\"&gt;Shield Potions&lt;/a&gt; have changed! Both restore the same amount of stats as before, but the \"way\" they do it is different. They now start restoring immediately, and you can now move slowly \"while\" they restore. Be a sitting Quackling no more with these two items. But take note: you won't be able to cancel once you start restoring with these items, so use them wisely!\nRevive, Reboot, Thrive.\nReviving and rebooting got a renovation! When you\u2019re reviving a teammate and accidentally move out of range, the revive timer will slowly go down instead of hard reset. Rebooting works the same way \u2014 the reboot timer will slowly go down if you move out of range, not hard reset.\nGame, Set, Match Quest.\nBesides going for the dub, what goal do you wanna go for in your next match? Chapter 5 Season 1 gives you that choice with &lt;a href=\"Match%20Quests\"&gt;Match Quests&lt;/a&gt;! At the beginning of each match, you\u2019ll be presented a choice of three Match Quests that expire at the end of the match. Match Quests replace Daily Quests to give \"you\" the ability to pursue what you want to accomplish while having less distractions in battle.\nMatch Quests are personal to each player, and squadmates cannot contribute to their progress. (Match Quests are tuned to be completable by a single player.) You will have Bonus Goals that reset each day to reward you additional XP for completing Match Quests.\nBuilds to Scale.\nThere's a new way to scale enemy structures! Walls built by players now have a plank for propelling yourself upwards. Keep an eye out for these planks in the environment too!\nImproved Animations.\nEnjoy smoother gameplay thanks to more fluid and detailed animations! Players on all platforms will experience Motion Matching and Procedural Layering in Fortnite Battle Royale. These are features that result in improved animations for things like transitioning from walking to running, changing directions, and using a weapon.\nAdditionally, Fortnite Battle Royale players on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC will experience Physics Based Animation! With this feature, Gliders in action will have more detailed animations.\nMotion Matching, Procedural Layering, and Physics Based Animation require no setting to be enabled \u2014 jump right into a better-feeling battle!\nThe Underground and Society Collide in the Big Bang Battle Pass.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.fortnite.com/battle-pass\"&gt;Big Bang Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt;, unlock rewards in Fortnite by earning XP across Fortnite Battle Royale, creator-made islands, and the upcoming &lt;a href=\"LEGO%20Fortnite\"&gt;LEGO\u00ae Fortnite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Racing\"&gt;Rocket Racing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fortnite%20Festival\"&gt;Fortnite Festival&lt;/a&gt;!

Before playing LEGO Fortnite for the first time, you\u2019ll need to create a new world or jump into a world a player has made you a key holder of.\nWhen creating a new world, you\u2019ll choose a save slot to save it to. (You can have up to eight worlds!) Then, you\u2019ll be given some options for enjoying your world your way.\nThe most important decision is the mode you\u2019ll play. Choose the default Survival mode if you want to overcome the world around you. Gather and craft resources for your builds, and face off against mighty foes while exploring the world! Just wanna let your imagination run free? Choose Sandbox mode where you can spawn builds and items without needing to find resources.\nIf you choose Sandbox mode, you can select options for customizing your world further!\nAdvanced Settings for Sandbox Mode\n\"Heads-up!\" These settings cannot be changed once your world is created, so make sure you double-check what you chose.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nTime to Build!\n&lt;br&gt;\nWhen starting out in Survival mode, you\u2019ll want to build a and shelter to help you survive the first night. After building those, it\u2019s a good idea to build a ! Use the Crafting Bench to craft basic tools that\u2019ll make resource gathering quicker.\nThe more resources you have, the easier it\u2019ll be to create builds you unlock, including LEGO structures and individual LEGO bricks.\n\"Get crackin\u2019 at the Crafting Bench!\"\nThe Crafting Bench is just one of many . Stations are LEGO builds where you can make things like tools, crafting materials, and food! Another Station is the , which you can use to make Planks for furniture.\n\"A look at the Lumber Mill!\"\nWith enough resources, establish a village by building a . Then develop your village with pre-planned Builds or builds of your own imagination! If you have the resources, you can build what you see on the blueprint.\nGoing for a campground feel? Use wood to build a :\n\"A Log Shed or Log Cabin not enough? A Jumbo Lodge too much? Then a Log Home\u2019s right for you!\"\nGoing for a more medieval feel instead? Use wood and granite to build a :\n\"Hear ye, hear ye.\"\nDon\u2019t like to build by the book? Use resources to build like Foundations, Floors, Walls, Roofs, and more. Then make your own distinct build! Whether your build is a pre-planned Build or custom one, decorate it with Furniture like Beds, Tables, and Sofas.\n\"Make what you want in LEGO Fortnite.\"\n&lt;hr&gt;\nStay Intact!\n&lt;br&gt;\nDon\u2019t let yourself get knocked down. Many things will try to get in your way in your world \u2014 foes, the weather, and even your own hunger. \nTo face off against foes, craft self-defense tools at a Crafting Bench. To endure the extreme cold or heat, eat certain foods or craft certain &lt;a href=\"Charms\"&gt;Charms&lt;/a&gt;. To prevent hunger, forage or hunt for food. You can grow your own food too!\nTip: food prevents hunger, but it also recovers hearts. Eat food to stay strong in a battle!\n\"Keep track of your hunger, temperature, and hearts on your screen.\"\n&lt;hr&gt;\nPlay with Friends\n&lt;br&gt;\nBring other players into your world. LEGO Fortnite supports parties of up to eight players, meaning seven other people can jump into your world while you\u2019re in it!\nEveryone wants to rule their own world. You can do that alone, or share the responsibility with friends! Invite up to seven players to be a key holder of your world, which means they can access and edit the world anytime. This includes when they\u2019re joining you online or when you\u2019re away offline. \n\"Invite some friends to hold down the fort.\"\nTo invite a player to be a key holder, choose a player currently in your world with you. Make this selection in the Players tab of the Menu menu. All party members without a key will be removed from your world when you leave your party or world.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nCustomize Your Character\n&lt;br&gt;\nThere\u2019s customizing your world, but how about customizing yourself? \nThe characters you play in Fortnite are called &lt;a href=\"Outfits\"&gt;Outfits&lt;/a&gt;, and over 1,200 Outfits have LEGO Styles! LEGO Styles are playable in LEGO Fortnite. For example, if you have the &lt;a href=\"Brite%20Bomber\"&gt;Brite Bomber&lt;/a&gt; Outfit in your Locker, it\u2019ll appear as a &lt;a href=\"Brite%20Bomber%23LEGO%20Fortnite\"&gt;LEGO Style&lt;/a&gt; in LEGO Fortnite which you can use to play.

The recommended control input for Rocket Racing is a controller.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nIs split-screen available in Rocket Racing?\n&lt;br&gt;\nSplit-screen is currently not available in Rocket Racing.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nRock It, Racing: Rocket Racing Overview.\nDrift, Fly, Turbo, Air Dodge!\n&lt;br&gt;\nHow to drive a rocket-powered car? Here are the four main techniques:\nDrfit\n&lt;br&gt;\nWhen a sharp turn\u2019s ahead, a well-timed drift can come in clutch. Luckily, Rocket Racing makes basic drifting easy \u2014 all you have to do is make a tight turn! Drifting charges up a speed boost, meaning the longer the drift, the longer the boost will be after you straighten out.\nAn even sharper turn ahead? That\u2019s when Rocket Drift comes in! Activate a Rocket Drift by making a tight turn AND holding the Rocket Drift button. Rocket Drifting can give you the edge in competition by getting you \u2018round the bend first. Like basic drifting, Rocket Drifting charges up a speed boost the longer it\u2019s activated!\nFly\n&lt;br&gt;\nWe all experience bumps on the road, but only rocket-powered cars let you fly over them. The roads of Rocket Racing have lots of , and if you hit one, your current speed will slow to make way for passing foes. Avoid hazards by jumping, or holding down the jump button to \"fly\"!\nSometimes there\u2019s the opposite of bumps on the road: no road at all. And sometimes there\u2019s an alternate path. Whatever your reason for flying, you can hold the jump button for a limited time before the jets run out. Try tapping the jump button in short bursts to fly farther, or recharge entirely by touching the ground.\nTurbo\n&lt;br&gt;\nBoosting is cool, but how do you go even faster? Going Turbo! All cars in Rocket Racing have a Turbo meter that holds up to three charges. The meter refills over time, and you can make it refill faster by drifting. Use a Turbo immediately or save up all three for a triple Turbo threat!\nAir Dodge (\"Flip\")\n&lt;br&gt;\nWhile airborne, air dodge to attach to walls \u2014 or ceilings! Pull off an air dodge by indicating a direction while pressing the air dodge button. Once you\u2019re attached, drift and go Turbo!\n&lt;hr&gt;\nPull Up to the Starting Line\n&lt;br&gt;\nSo now that you\u2019re well-versed in rocket-powered cars, it\u2019s time for a high-octane bid to the finish line. But before you finish the race, you gotta start it! Learn how to start racing below:\nPlay with Your Party!\n&lt;br&gt;\nWanna play with your party only? In the track selection, adjust the privacy setting to private to play unranked races against your party members! Private races support parties of up to 12.\nCompete in Public Races!\n&lt;br&gt;\nShow your server region who\u2019s #1! Whether you\u2019re playing solo or in a party, adjust the privacy setting to public to play ranked races against opponents not in your party. Public races support parties of up to four.\nChoose the Track... or Let the Track Choose You!\n&lt;br&gt;\nAll 26 launch tracks support 12 opponents. In an unranked session, it\u2019s up to the party leader to choose the track! All 26 tracks are fair game in unranked, including nine Novice tracks, seven Advanced tracks, and ten Expert tracks. Gauge which difficulty is right for your party!\nIn a ranked session, the track chooses you. Learn more about ranked play below \ud83c\udfc1\n&lt;hr&gt;\nRace Up the Ranks\n&lt;br&gt;\nWith Season Zero comes ! Rocket Racing Seasons will have their own Ranked Seasons, meaning when Season 1 releases, Season 1 Ranked will also release.\nThe Rank Tiers\n&lt;br&gt;\nThere are eight rank tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Elite, Champion, and Unreal. Bronze through Diamond have three ranks, while Elite, Champion, and Unreal have one:\nClimb the ranks of Bronze to reach Silver, then climb the ranks of Silver to reach Gold. Do the same in Gold, Platinum, and Diamond to reach Elite! Once you\u2019re Elite, prove you\u2019re a Champion and then finally Unreal.\nReaching Unreal\n&lt;br&gt;\nOnce you reach Unreal, you\u2019ll stay in Unreal for that Ranked Season no matter your performance in future races. But that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re done when you reach Unreal! Upon reaching Unreal, you\u2019ll be given a number signifying your standing among Unreal players globally. Continue doing well in ranked to raise your number and be among the best players in the world! Keep track of your position on the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.fortnite.com/ranked/leaderboard\"&gt;Unreal leaderboard&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ranked Journey\n&lt;br&gt;\nLet\u2019s shift to reverse and talk about the journey to Unreal. In ranked play, climb the ranks to unlock more tracks! Once you reach Diamond, you\u2019ll have access to all tracks in ranked.\nIf you\u2019re playing solo, you\u2019ll be matched against opponents of the same or similar rank as you. If you\u2019re playing in a party of more than one, you\u2019ll be matched against opponents of the same or similar rank of the \"highest-ranked\" party member. You\u2019ll also have access to the same number of tracks as the highest-ranked party member.\nRank Reset\n&lt;br&gt;\nAt the start of a new Ranked Season, everyone\u2019s rank will reset to provide a fresh start for all players. Your beginning rank will depend on your finishing rank in the prior Season. Go full-throttle in the current Season for a good start in the next one!\nCar Customization and Cross-Game Ownership.\nTake your favorite Rocket League cars on new adventures! All players have a Locker in Fortnite, and in the \u201cCars\u201d section you can equip a car to use in Rocket Racing. \nA Fortnite Car consists of three types of Locker items: &lt;a href=\"Car%20Bodies\"&gt;Car Bodies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Decals\"&gt;Decals&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wheels\"&gt;Wheels&lt;/a&gt;.

All players have the &lt;a href=\"OEM%20Wheels\"&gt;OEM Wheels&lt;/a&gt; in their Locker right now!

We'll have more to share in 2024.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nIs split-screen available in Fortnite Festival?\n&lt;br&gt;\nSplit-screen is currently not available in Fortnite Festival.\n&lt;hr&gt;\n\ud83d\udcbf In the Groove: Fortnite Festival Overview.\nThe Main Stage\nReady for the spotlight? Whether you\u2019re playing solo or in a party, select \u201cFestival Main Stage\u201d and get ready for your show! The Main Stage supports parties of up to four players. After selecting this experience, you and your party will enter the Backstage, where you\u2019ll decide who plays lead (Guitar or Keytar), Drums, vocals on the Mic, and Bass. This is also where you\u2019ll decide your setlist!\nYour Setlist and Jam Tracks\nTo set up your list, go to the organ in the middle of the room. Here, you can add up to four &lt;a href=\"Jam%20Tracks\"&gt;Jam Tracks&lt;/a&gt; to your setlist! Jam Tracks are songs you can perform in Fortnite Festival, and you can get more Jam Tracks by progressing in the Festival Season Pass or by purchasing them for &lt;a href=\"V-Bucks\"&gt;V-Bucks&lt;/a&gt; in Fortnite\u2019s Shop. If any one player in your party has a certain Jam Track, you can add that Jam Track to your party\u2019s setlist.\nWorried about having no songs in your repertoire? Worry not \u2014 the Main Stage always has a rotation of featured Jam Tracks that you can perform for free for a limited time, even if you don't have them in your Locker.\nAlso, all players have the \"&lt;a href=\"OG%20%28Future%20Remix%29\"&gt;OG (Future Remix)&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Show%20Them%20Who%20We%20Are\"&gt;Show Them Who We Are&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Lobby%20Music\"&gt;Lobby Tracks&lt;/a&gt; in their Locker right now. These Lobby Tracks double as Jam Tracks you can use in Fortnite Festival. (What\u2019s a Lobby Track? A Lobby Track is a song you can play while in the Lobby of a Fortnite experience!)\nPlease note! \ud83c\udfb5 Because these two Lobby Tracks have existed in Fortnite previously, players who already had them in their Locker before Fortnite Festival will receive a one-time V-Bucks refund for each one, equivalent to the amount they paid for it. They\u2019ll also be granted the Jam Track version!\nIt\u2019s Showtime\n&lt;br&gt;\nWith your setlist decided, hold the \u201cReady Up\u201d option to rift onto the stage! Rock the house by hitting the right notes at the right time, and for those long notes, holding them for the right amount of time. Each song is a test of your reaction skills \u2014 don\u2019t let the crowd down!\nThe better you do during a song, the more you\u2019ll fill up the star meter which can give you up to five stars per song. Reach for the stars to help you complete Festival Quests \u2b50\n&lt;hr&gt;\nThe Jam Stage\nYou don\u2019t need to be \"the\" star to have fun. When you\u2019re not breaking a sweat on the Main Stage, create new mixes on the Jam Stage! The Jam Stage supports parties of up to four players \u2014 create mixes with your party or an ensemble of three other players you see onstage.\nOnce you\u2019re on the Jam Stage, play the lead loop, Drum loop, Vox (Vocals) loop, or Bass loop of any Jam Track in your Locker. Your band can play loops of up to four different Jam Tracks simultaneously, resulting in new mashups that just might surprise you. Adjust the tempo, key, and major/minor setting to fine tune your mix! \nFan of Fortnite Battle Royale? You can also use this Jam System to create mixes in a match!\n&lt;hr&gt;\nGather Your Gear\nFortnite Festival introduces new types of Locker items to Fortnite: Instruments and &lt;a href=\"Auras\"&gt;Auras&lt;/a&gt;. (And Jam Tracks!) Instruments are broken down into five kinds: &lt;a href=\"Guitars\"&gt;Guitars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Keytars\"&gt;Keytars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drums\"&gt;Drums&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Microphones\"&gt;Mics&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bass\"&gt;Basses&lt;/a&gt;. Auras surround you with an ambience as you perform on the Main Stage. \"Guitars, Keytars, Drums, Mics, Basses, and Auras grant no gameplay advantage as you perform.\" \nTo start, you already have one of each Instrument and an Aura in your Locker! Like Jam Tracks, you can get more Instruments and Auras by progressing in a Season\u2019s Pass. You can also get more Instruments by purchasing them for V-Bucks in Fortnite\u2019s Shop.\n\"The &lt;a href=\"Stellar%20Burst\"&gt;Stellar Burst&lt;/a&gt; Aura, one of the Auras in Fortnite Festival &lt;a href=\"Festival%20Pass\"&gt;Season 1\u2019s Festival Pass&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThere are more Locker items that Fortnite Festival supports, including Emotes you can perform after your show and Outfits that serve as your melodious avatar. \n\ud83d\udcbf Make Your Debut in Fortnite Festival Season 1: Opening Night.\nFortnite Festival &lt;a href=\"https%3A//fortnite.com/news/fortnite-festival-season-1-opening-night-features-the-weeknd\"&gt;Season 1: Opening Night&lt;/a&gt; starts now, and you\u2019re invited!

Award-winning artist The Weeknd is the featured Icon of this Season.\nThe Opening Night Festival Pass has a free reward track and a Premium Reward Track upgrade. With the Premium Reward Track, you\u2019ll unlock an extra layer of rewards as you progress, including &lt;a href=\"The%20Weeknd\"&gt;The Weeknd&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Outfit\"&gt;Outfit&lt;/a&gt;! Progress in the Pass by earning Festival Points from Festival Quests.\n\ud83d\udcbf Tips for Content Creators.\nFortnite Festival Content Creation\n&lt;br&gt;\nWant to create Fortnite Festival content for YouTube? During launch week (Dec. 9 at 10 AM ET - Dec 16, 2023, at 10 AM ET), content creators in the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//sac.epicgames.com/overview\"&gt;Support-A-Creator (SAC)&lt;/a&gt; program will be able to host VOD content on YouTube featuring a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.fortnite.com/news/take-your-stage-in-fortnite-festival%23Jam-Track-Selection\"&gt;selection of Jam Tracks&lt;/a&gt; (and their loops) and monetize it. No takedown notifications should occur during this time. More info:\nAlthough unlikely, if you do receive a claim on any SAC content, there may be a short delay in YouTube processing the release of the claim. During this time, please do not dispute the claim.\nNot in SAC? Don\u2019t worry, you can still share your Fortnite Festival experiences on YouTube during the launch week featuring the selected Jam Tracks. However, you will not be able to monetize this content on YouTube.\nPlease note! \ud83c\udfb5 For Twitch creators streaming content featuring the selected Jam Tracks, we cannot prevent your VODs or clips from getting flagged by third-party copyright detection systems. The general recommendation is to disable VODs/clips when streaming Fortnite Festival. For more information, see Twitch\u2019s &lt;a href=\"https%3A//help.twitch.tv/s/article/dmca-and-copyright-faqs\"&gt;DMCA &amp; Copyright FAQs&lt;/a&gt; help page.\nJam Track Selection\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe selection includes any Jam Track featured in the Shop from December 9 at 10 AM ET to December 16, 2023, at 10 AM ET.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nLicensed Audio Setting and Jam Tracks\nThe \"Mute Others\" and \"Mute All\" options for Fortnite's Licensed Audio setting mute Jam Tracks. However, the two toggles currently don\u2019t apply to the Main Stage experience, so be careful when streaming or recording Fortnite Festival content.\nNon-licensed Jam Tracks are currently muted by the \u201cMute Others\u201d and \u201cMute All\u201d options. We are working to detach non-licensed Jam Tracks from these options in the future. \n&lt;hr&gt;\nThis is just the beginning of the festival, with more songs, artists, and stages coming soon. Take your stage starting today!\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Today\u2019s update hits key areas that we want to address before our next update planned for early 2024.\nFortnite Battle Royale.\nMovement Improvements\n&lt;br&gt;\nMovement speed has been increased when crouching, and running. We also reduced camera movement and adjusted the change in view while sprinting to encourage a smoother experience. Plus, we updated the movement animations to better match the adjustments in speed.\nTo help you get adjusted to these updates, we\u2019ve reset everyone\u2019s \u201cCustom Diagonal Movement\u201d settings, so please log in and reconfigure your settings to what feels best.\nMedallions Readability\n&lt;br&gt;\nSociety Medallion icons now stand out more on the map and should be easier to spot at a glance. We also reduced the visual noise present in the minimap when several Medallion zones are near one another, especially in the later &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;Storm&lt;/a&gt; circles.\nNight Visibility\n&lt;br&gt;\nWe\u2019ve brightened certain areas of the map where it was a little too dark during night.\nStorm Visibility\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe visibility of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;Storm&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s edge has been improved so it\u2019s more apparent how close it is, as we heard from the community it could be difficult to see.\nWeapon Icons\n&lt;br&gt;\nWe\u2019re aware of feedback that the &lt;a href=\"Frenzy%20Auto%20Shotgun\"&gt;Frenzy Auto Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Burst%20SMG\"&gt;Thunder Burst SMG&lt;/a&gt; weapon icons were too similar, making it hard to differentiate them. These icons have been updated to be more visually unique and legible.\nRecent Balance Changes\n&lt;br&gt;\nLast week, we also released a lot of balance changes to Battle Royale. Here\u2019s a recap!\nLEGO Fortnite.\nHungry? More Filling Snacks!\nWe heard feedback that food in LEGO Fortnite wasn\u2019t reducing hunger very much, so we made adjustments to make your snacks more filling!\nElimination While Cavin\u2019\n&lt;br&gt;\nWe fixed a bug that might have made you lose your items after being eliminated in the transition between aboveground and belowground. Thanks for your patience as this was being worked on \u2014 we understand it was frustrating to lose your items (we were losing our items too!).\nICYMI, last week we also made the following changes before today\u2019s update: \nDurability\n&lt;br&gt;\nDamage\n&lt;br&gt;\nCritter Changes\n&lt;br&gt;\nOther Tweaks and Improvements\n&lt;br&gt;\nRocket Racing.\nLong Queue Times\n&lt;br&gt;\nWe heard feedback that high-ranked racers have been experiencing long queue times in Rocket Racing, and our team is working on incremental improvements to help you get into your races faster. We\u2019ll continue to monitor queue times and make adjustments if necessary.\nCar Collisions\n&lt;br&gt;\nCar-on-car collisions have been a major topic among players, especially when a bump from behind spins your car 180 degrees. Today's update will make those collisions a bit less punishing, and should help keep your car facing the finish line. We\u2019ll continue to work on collision improvements for future updates too.\nJackie Outfit Quest\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe Reach Gold rank in &lt;a href=\"Try%20Rocket%20Racing%20Quests\"&gt;Rocket Racing Quest&lt;/a&gt; to unlock the &lt;a href=\"Jackie\"&gt;Jackie&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Outfit\"&gt;Outfit&lt;/a&gt; was rewarding players for reaching Gold II instead of Gold I. We\u2019ve patched this so that racers who have hit Gold I now just need to complete one full race to complete the Quest and receive the Jackie Outfit.\nFortnite Festival.\nMissing Song Library\n&lt;br&gt;\nWe fixed an error that caused players to see an empty song library in the Main Stage after suspending Fortnite on their device. This should also improve the pauses some players were encountering before a song starts. \nFall Damage Disabled\n&lt;br&gt;\nFall damage has been disabled in the Main Stage\u2019s Backstage. Jump off all the balconies you\u2019d like, rockstars! \nRestart Song\n&lt;br&gt;\nWe\u2019ve disabled the \u201cRestart Song\u201d functionality (available to Solo players) temporarily while we fix an error that was causing the game to become unresponsive.\nIncorrect Posting to Leaderboards\n&lt;br&gt;\nWe fixed an issue where some scores may have been posted to the wrong leaderboard. We will continue to monitor (and potentially audit) leaderboards moving forward to ensure their accuracy.\nThis is just the beginning of the future of Fortnite, and we\u2019re excited to continue improvements where possible. Thank you for sharing your feedback \u2014 we appreciate your passion!"}

Olympian legends \u2014 including &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; and the thunder god &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 now rule the Island in otherworldly rage. To make matters worse, they\u2019ve brought their powers and weapons with them. Use their mythological means against them in : Myths &amp; Mortals!\nLegendary Locations.\nMount Olympus\n&lt;br&gt;\nYou can\u2019t have Olympus without &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Mount Olympus&lt;/a&gt;. Home of Zeus, you\u2019ll always feel like you\u2019re being watched with the grand monument that graces this great mountain.\nGrim Gate\n&lt;br&gt;\nTo get to \"The Underworld,\" one way to get there is crossing the river at &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Gate\"&gt;Grim Gate&lt;/a&gt;\u2026 where the three-headed guard dog &lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt; awaits. Venture to the west of the Island to confront these canines!\nThe Underworld\n&lt;br&gt;\nPast the hounds is the home of &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"The%20Underworld\"&gt;The Underworld&lt;/a&gt;. Despite its flowing streams, the land of this city is almost completely dried up. \nBrawler's Battleground\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe god of war, &lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt; always welcomes a battle. Take him up on his challenge in the &lt;a href=\"Brawler%27s%20Battleground\"&gt;Brawler's Battleground&lt;/a&gt; arena south of Mount Olympus. (Oh yeah, Ares will be the Outfit of the &lt;a href=\"April%202024%20Fortnite%20Crew%20Pack\"&gt;April 2024 Crew Pack&lt;/a&gt;!)\nThese are just some of the locations the gods brought to the Island. However, don\u2019t forget what else they\u2019ve brought with them\u2026\nChaos Upon The Land.\nThe gods descended with their powers and weapons, but that doesn\u2019t mean your next battle has to end in tragedy. Make your next battle a myth to remember by using them for yourself!\nThunderbolt of Zeus\n&lt;br&gt;\nBecome a Storm of your own. With the &lt;a href=\"Thunderbolt%20of%20Zeus\"&gt;Thunderbolt of Zeus&lt;/a&gt;, you can rise into the air and hurl lightning bolts at your target! Use this power wisely though, as the Thunderbolt of Zeus has three maximum charges with a cooldown between each one. How to wield this electricity? Pick up this Mythic power across the Island or by defeating Zeus himself.\nGatekeeper Shotgun\n&lt;br&gt;\nForged by Hephaestus for Cerberus, the &lt;a href=\"Gatekeeper%20Shotgun\"&gt;Gatekeeper Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; can quickly fire three aggressive rounds. This Shotgun is best at short range, so hit all three shots fast to show your bite\u2019s as bad as your bark! When you\u2019re done, prepare for your next target with a full magazine reload. The Gatekeeper Shotgun can be found across the Island, but the Mythic variant is only obtainable from Cerberus rolling over.\nHarbinger SMG\n&lt;br&gt;\nLike Hades himself, the &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20SMG\"&gt;Harbinger SMG&lt;/a&gt; is unforgiving and relentless \u2014 even when exhausted. Highly accurate when first shot, it has dramatically increased recoil and bloom as more bullets are fired. But that doesn\u2019t stop it from going all out. Find the regular version across the Island or the Mythic version from defeating Hades.\nHuntress DMR\n&lt;br&gt;\nArtemis, goddess of the moonlit hunt. During battle, take a note from Artemis and use a weapon created to dole out punishment from a distance. Even though it was created for gods to punish mortals, flip the script and use the &lt;a href=\"Huntress%20DMR\"&gt;Huntress DMR&lt;/a&gt; to punish the gods (and some mortals too we guess). You can hunt for Huntress DMRs across the Island\u2026 or get the Mythic version by hunting down Zeus. \nWarforged Assault Rifle\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe &lt;a href=\"Warforged%20Assault%20Rifle\"&gt;Warforged Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt; is forged for battle-hungry gods \u2014 which is why it\u2019s the favorite of Ares. Powerful yet unruly, this Assault Rifle has high damage, high rate of fire, and strong recoil. Find one across the Island or fight Ares for the Mythic version!\nAnother Power... The Power of Flight!\nThe Thunderbolt of Zeus isn\u2019t the only Olympian Power. With the &lt;a href=\"Wings%20of%20Icarus\"&gt;Wings of Icarus&lt;/a&gt;, soar through the skies and divebomb your foes below! But beware: fly too long and your wings will burn up, and taking too much damage may lead to a crash landing. Find this Mythic power across the Island!\nYet another Olympian Power is coming your way \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Chains%20of%20Hades\"&gt;Chains of Hades&lt;/a&gt; will pull you in later this Season...\nUnderground in the Underworld: Weapons from Last Season.\nUnlike Orpheus looking back at Eurydice, you\u2019re allowed to turn to the weapons from Chapter 5 Season 1. Here\u2019s a list of the weapons returning from last Season:\nMyths &amp; Mods.\nIt\u2019s not enough that weapons descended from Olympus \u2014 the Thermal Scope and Speedgrip &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Mods\"&gt;weapon mods&lt;/a&gt; did too. Also forged by Hephaestus, the Thermal Scope mod can be attached to any scoped weapon. Want vision like that of the gods? It more than doubles the scope view and has a thermal effect you can toggle on or off! With the Speedgrip mod, your movement speed while aiming will increase.

So vast that the \u201cWasteland Warriors\u201d don\u2019t want to give up control. This band of marauders brings a whole new meaning to scrappy crew \u2014 each one is an automobile expert who\u2019ll tread on any rebellion. In , get in the driver\u2019s seat and bring the Nitro to these vehicular villains! \nWelcome to the Wasteland.\nA ferocious sandstorm recently moved over the Island, creating a new biome in the south dubbed the wasteland. The \u201cWasteland Warriors\u201d have already called shotgun on owning the place. (They did ride in with the sandstorm, after all.) This crew moves as fast as their decked-out cars, proven by the places they\u2019ve already established:\nRedline Rig\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Redline%20Rig\"&gt;Redline Rig&lt;/a&gt; is a Nitro refinery run by &lt;a href=\"The%20Machinist\"&gt;The Machinist&lt;/a&gt;, the Wasteland Warriors\u2019 master mechanic. What\u2019s Nitro? Whether you\u2019re in a car or not, Nitro will make you feel irrepressibly powerful\u2026\nNitrodrome\n&lt;br&gt;\nNobody knows chaos and destruction more than &lt;a href=\"Ringmaster%20Scarr\"&gt;Ringmaster Scarr&lt;/a&gt;, so it makes sense she\u2019s the master of ceremonies at the circus of car spectacle: the &lt;a href=\"Nitrodrome\"&gt;Nitrodrome&lt;/a&gt;. \nBrutal Beachhead\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Brutal%20Beachhead\"&gt;Brutal Beachhead&lt;/a&gt; is the base of operations for the Wasteland Warriors. Here, you can find none other than the Wasteland Warriors\u2019 master muscle &lt;a href=\"Megalo%20Don\"&gt;Megalo Don&lt;/a&gt;. Be warned: it doesn\u2019t take long for his rage to surface.\nThere\u2019s more to discover in the wasteland, including a &lt;a href=\"Snooty%20Steppes\"&gt;Snooty Steppes&lt;/a&gt; turned &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Steppes\"&gt;\"Sandy\" Steppes&lt;/a&gt;.\nGo Nitro.\nAcross the Island you may find &lt;a href=\"Nitro%20Splash\"&gt;Nitro Splash&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Nitro%20Barrels\"&gt;Nitro Barrels&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 both shipped from Redline Rig. Nitro Splash is a portable Nitro container you can throw down to infuse your car (or yourself) with Nitro. Nitro Barrels are Nitro containers that Nitro-fy on contact. \nPropelled by the steam inside, Nitro Barrels will fly off when you hit them\u2026 then explode on landing. Drive away without looking back! \nNitro\u2019s nitro typical perk. In this temporary state, expect the following advantages:\nNitro-fied Car\n&lt;br&gt;\nNitro-fied Player\nPack a Punch with Nitro Fists.\nWhen you\u2019re ready for the heavy-handed approach, put on &lt;a href=\"Nitro%20Fists\"&gt;Nitro Fists&lt;/a&gt; to perform a 3x punch combo, uppercut, or an aerial punch that dashes you through the air!\nNitro Fists have four charges, each one recharging every eight seconds. The uppercut and aerial punch use one charge, while the 3x punch combo uses none. If you aerial punch the ground instead of the air, the impact will be meteoric to surrounding enemies.\nFortify Your Ride.\nVehicle mods are back! and are unvaulted, while four new mods are joining the ride. Attach one of these mods per slot:\nNo mechanical experience is required \u2014 just hit a &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Mod%20Box\"&gt;Vehicle Mod Box&lt;/a&gt; with your car to attach the mod. You\u2019ll know which mod you\u2019re attaching based on the symbol on the box! Already have something in a slot? You can replace the mod with a different one, or a brand new version of the existing one! You may want to replace a mod if its Health bar is getting low. (Note: the Bulletproof Tires don\u2019t have Health, since they're indestructible.)\n\"A Vehicle Mod Box containing a Grenade Launcher Turret.\"\nIs the Health of your car \"itself\" low? Hit a &lt;a href=\"Repair%20Box\"&gt;Repair Box&lt;/a&gt; or take matters into your own hands with the unvaulted &lt;a href=\"Repair%20Torch\"&gt;Repair Torch&lt;/a&gt;!\nGet a taste of the future on your next pit stop. &lt;a href=\"Service%20Stations\"&gt;Service Stations&lt;/a&gt; have replaced gas pumps, refilling your car\u2019s gas and Health while parked on the station pad!\nFurbish Your Ride.\nStarting in , you\u2019ve been able to turn Sports Cars on the Island into your equipped Car. Now, you can do the same with SUVs! There will be certain &lt;a href=\"Car%20Bodies\"&gt;Car Bodies&lt;/a&gt; in the Shop compatible with SUVs instead of Sports Cars. Also, select SUV Car Bodies from Rocket League will become cross-game eligible in the future. \n\"The Behemoth Car Body.\"\nTo start things off, the &lt;a href=\"Behemoth%20Bundle\"&gt;Behemoth Bundle&lt;/a&gt; is in the Shop, containing items from the new . Look right at home in the wasteland!\nThe Behemoth Bundle includes:\nSplit between showing off a Sports Car or SUV in the Nitrodrome? In the Locker, you\u2019ll have separate loadouts for both! The Behemoth Bundle items will be eligible for cross-game ownership with Rocket League at a later date.\n\"*The Behemoth Offroad Wheels aren\u2019t any better at offroading than other Wheels. They just look the part!\"\nLose the Battle Bus, Win the War Bus.\nAfter being dropped from the Battle Bus, fight for control of a coveted &lt;a href=\"War%20Bus\"&gt;War Bus&lt;/a&gt;. There are two being driven by patrollers on the Island \u2014 hijack one and start a road trip of disarray! Each War Bus comes rigged with two cannons on top and a horn that produces an EMP pulse. (EMP does damage to nearby enemy Shields, and temporarily disables surrounding vehicles.) These monster mobiles hold multiple EMP pulses that each recharge after a short time!\nCreate a Roadblock with a Boom Bolt.\nCars aren\u2019t unconquerable. When you\u2019re in a jam (traffic or otherwise), break out a &lt;a href=\"Boom%20Bolt\"&gt;Boom Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, a fast-firing moddable crossbow that shoots explosive bolts. After a few good hits on a Whiplash, it\u2019ll be totalled enough to cause a traffic back-up all the way from &lt;a href=\"Reckless%20Railways\"&gt;Reckless Railways&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"The%20Underworld\"&gt;The Underworld&lt;/a&gt; (if people actually wanted to spend time in the abyss willingly).\nWrench Wretches.\nThe Wasteland Warriors can either be found in their individual lairs or showboating in a convoy. If you can engineer a way to beat them, a trunkload of rewards await\u2026\nExterminate The Machinist\n&lt;br&gt;\nUpon being eliminated, &lt;a href=\"The%20Machinist\"&gt;The Machinist&lt;/a&gt; will drop her &lt;a href=\"Medallions\"&gt;Medallion&lt;/a&gt;. The Machinist's Medallion will regenerate your Shield over time! \nIf you defeat her inside Redline Rig, use this Medallion to open the garage holding her car. If she\u2019s in a convoy, you\u2019ll have to seize her modded-up automobile by force! Wherever you defeat her, you\u2019ll also get a Mythic weapon: &lt;a href=\"The%20Machinist%27s%20Combat%20Assault%20Rifle\"&gt;The Machinist's Combat Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt;.\nConquer Ringmaster Scarr==\n&lt;br&gt;\nPutting an end to &lt;a href=\"Ringmaster%20Scarr\"&gt;Ringmaster Scarr&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s show? Her Medallion will drop after elimination. Ringmaster Scarr\u2019s Medallion will give you infinite ammo and a small damage buff!\nDefeat Ringmaster Scarr at the Nitrodrome to open the garage hiding her car. Is she in a convoy? Defeat her there to capture her kitted-out ride! With her preference for extravagance, she\u2019ll drop the Mythic &lt;a href=\"Ringmaster%27s%20Boom%20Bolt\"&gt;Ringmaster's Boom Bolt&lt;/a&gt; on elimination too.\nOverwhelm Megalo Don\nSo you\u2019re going straight to the top. Megalo Don\u2019s Medallion will infuse you with infinite Nitro! \nThe Nitro doesn\u2019t stop there. Yes \u2014 defeating &lt;a href=\"Megalo%20Don\"&gt;Megalo Don&lt;/a&gt; means you can steal his ride like the other Wasteland Warriors\u2019 \u2014 but it also means you can get the Mythic &lt;a href=\"Megalo%20Don%27s%20Nitro%20Fists\"&gt;Megalo Don's Nitro Fists&lt;/a&gt;!\nSpeaking of infinite Nitro, all three of the Warriors\u2019 cars have infinite Nitro.\n&lt;hr&gt;\n\ud83d\uded1 Medallions put you on the map\u2026 which is helpful for anyone on a roadtrip to take you down. If you have a Medallion in your inventory, you\u2019ll be marked on opponents\u2019 map, and the more Medallions you have, the more precise the radius of your exact location.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nZap That Thirst with Nuka-Cola!\nThe wasteland is a pretty apocalyptic place\u2026 like there was some kind of falling out. Indulge yourself in these trying times with a nice cold bottle of &lt;a href=\"Nuka-Cola\"&gt;Nuka-Cola&lt;/a&gt;! Restore a bit of Health, and over time, some Shield \ud83d\udc4d\nKind Cacti.\nRemember: it\u2019s not the wasteland itself that\u2019s oppressive \u2014 it\u2019s the infamous Warriors. Pickaxe a &lt;a href=\"Slurp%20Cactus\"&gt;Slurp Cactus&lt;/a&gt; to splash healing cactus fruit around you! Don\u2019t want to get out of your car? Drive through the cactus to heal yourself AND your vehicle.\nOld Weapons Aren\u2019t a Waste.\nDon\u2019t even try to keep that new car smell. Unvaulted and carried-over weapons are at your disposal for the start of Chapter 5 Season 3:\nMobile HUD Improvements.\nPlaying Chapter 5 Season 3 on mobile? We\u2019ve improved the mobile HUD in Battle Royale so it\u2019s easier to see the action on your screen! We combined buttons so that there are fewer, and we also repositioned icons.\nThese changes won\u2019t apply to mobile players with a custom HUD, and they won\u2019t take away the ability to \"create\" a custom HUD.\nPlay as a Wastelander with the Wrecked Battle Pass.\nThe &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.fortnite.com/battle-pass\"&gt;Wrecked Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt; releases at the same time as Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 5 Season 3: Wrecked! \nWith a Fortnite Battle Pass, unlock in-Fortnite rewards by earning XP across , , &lt;a href=\"LEGO%C2%AE%20Fortnite\"&gt;LEGO\u00ae Fortnite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Racing\"&gt;Rocket Racing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fortnite%20Festival\"&gt;Fortnite Festival&lt;/a&gt;.

Specifically, this update adds:\nAlso, you\u2019ll be able to use supported guitar controllers for \"non\"-Pro parts, such as Vocals or Drums! v30.00 releases May 24.\nKBM Keybind Support.\nOne of the top requests we heard with the launch of Pro Lead and Pro Bass was to allow players the option to keybind their controls for these new song parts. In v30.00, this is possible! New keybind settings for fretting the Green, Red, Yellow, Blue, and Orange notes alongside Strumming inputs enable you to mimic the inputs of a guitar controller by holding down your note color key while simultaneously \u201cstrumming\u201d to hit notes.\n\u201cLift Notes,\u201d the notes that look like an Up arrow and are hit by releasing your button press at the right time, are absent when playing Pro Lead or Pro Bass. You\u2019ll instead encounter \u201cHammer-Ons\u201d and \u201cPull-Offs.\u201d These \u201cHOPO\u201d notes are visually different from regular ones, and when you have a combo, you can activate them by pressing their note color keybind \u2014 no strumming required! \nKBM keybind support allows players to configure keybinds for any keyboard, controller-to-keyboard remapping, or accessibility devices to play the Pro Lead and Pro Bass song parts. See you on the leaderboards!\nStrumming With Pro Lead and Pro Bass.\nPlease note we are still improving Pro Lead and Pro Bass and that there are some kinks to work out with how this is displayed for all players now that these song parts are getting KBM keybind support. When Backstage choosing your setlist, please be sure to double-check which song part you\u2019re selecting and familiarize yourself with the input for strumming before jamming to a Pro song part!\nHere\u2019s the default keybinds for Pro Lead and Pro Bass, which are set up so you can hold your keyboard like you would a guitar: \nController default binds utilize the shoulder buttons for strumming and the triggers for Overdrive and whammy.\nIn order to hit a note with Pro Lead and Pro Bass, you need to hold down the corresponding colored fret note and simultaneously hit your Strum button at the correct time to \u201cplay\u201d it. \nGeneral Improvements to Pro Lead &amp; Pro Bass.\nAlongside the addition of KBM Support, we\u2019ve made a number of improvements and fixes to Pro Lead and Pro Bass following their release:\nWe\u2019ve seen a lot of great feedback around how guitar controllers \"feel\", with one of the main topics being fret forgiveness (or what some call \u201ccoyote time\u201d) being too strict. We\u2019re planning improvements to this in our next major game update after v30.00. We\u2019ll have more to share around its release!\nAlso, we\u2019re continuing investigations on ways to expand the list of compatible guitar controllers for console players, and will share more information as we have it.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nThanks to everyone who\u2019s jammed out with Pro Lead and Pro Bass so far and to ALL players taking the stage in Fortnite Festival! We\u2019ll continue listening to your feedback as our setlist grows \ud83c\udfb8\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Here\u2019s just a handful of items returning for Reload at launch:\n\"&lt;a href=\"Tilted%20Towers\"&gt;Tilted Towers&lt;/a&gt;, in the middle of the map, because that\u2019s where the party\u2019s at.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Victory%20Crown\"&gt;Victory Crowns&lt;/a&gt; can be earned in Reload and function the same way as they do in normal Battle Royale or Zero Build. When rebooted, you\u2019ll have a common &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Rifle\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt; and (for Build only) 100 wood. On elimination players drop &lt;a href=\"Small%20Shield%20Potion\"&gt;Small Shield Potions&lt;/a&gt;, medium ammo, light ammo, shotgun shells, and (for Build only) 50 of each building material. This is \"in addition\" to their entire inventory \u2014 stay strapped!\nReload Rewards.\nFortnite Reload has intro Quests rewarding 20,000 XP each. Complete three to unlock the &lt;a href=\"Digital%20Dogfight\"&gt;Digital Dogfight Contrail&lt;/a&gt;, six for the &lt;a href=\"Pool%20Cubes\"&gt;Pool Cubes Wrap&lt;/a&gt;, and nine to get the &lt;a href=\"NaNa%20Bath\"&gt;NaNa Bath Back Bling&lt;/a&gt;! Avoid all accusations of having no chill.\nIf you bag a Victory Royale, you\u2019ll snag &lt;a href=\"The%20Rezzbrella\"&gt;The Rezzbrella Glider&lt;/a&gt;! No matter how many times you reboot, keep strengthening your rez-olve.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nRift, Reboot, Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. \n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

If you recall, back in &lt;a href=\"Update%20v31.20\"&gt;v31.20&lt;/a&gt; we announced some UI changes with the aim of aligning more closely with other modes across the Fortnite universe. \nAnd so, with the v33.00 release, we\u2019re happy to announce the implementation of the reworked Emote Wheel, which should now look and feel more familiar. \nJam Emotes are also in the works - start warming up to make some noise and jam between Husk waves! \nAdditionally, we\u2019re aware of the following issues and are working on hammering them out in the upcoming updates:\nThat\u2019s not all though! Thanks to your input, we\u2019ve addressed a variety of issues, including:\nWe are granting 100 &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Flux\"&gt;Legendary Flux&lt;/a&gt; to everyone who spent Flux to evolve the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Flame%20Bow%20%28Save%20the%20World%29\"&gt;Primal Flame Bow&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks for your patience while we worked to fix this!\nAs always, we truly appreciate your ongoing support in flagging issues as we commit to implementing new features. Should you run into any issues related to the Emote Wheel or otherwise, don\u2019t hesitate to mention them in the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.reddit.com/r/FORTnITE/comments/1h41zxt/v3300_homebase_status_report/\"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt;. \nKeep the good fight for Homebase going! \ud83e\udee1\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

It was introduced in and further expanded upon in .\nDescription.\nVehicle Modification is a method of modifying and altering existing &lt;a href=\"cars\"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt;. Cars currently have three modification slots which are Roof, Front Bumper and Tires\nVehicles are modified by the player running through a Vehicle Mod Box, which causes it to spontaneously upgrade and gain a new ability. Cars obtained through &lt;a href=\"Vaults\"&gt;Vaults&lt;/a&gt;, and other pre-modded vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"War%20Bus\"&gt;War Bus&lt;/a&gt; cannot be modified.\nVehicles can also be infused with &lt;a href=\"Nitro\"&gt;Nitro&lt;/a&gt; just like players, and have their own benefits while being infused such as buffing attached mods, more driving speed, an explosive ramming power, and also a fuel consumption decrease.\nRoof Modifications.\nRoof Modifications allow the player to attach a turret on top of the car that allows them to deal damage to other vehicles or players nearby. Turrets can only be controlled by the player in the passenger seat. If a vehicle is infused with &lt;a href=\"Nitro\"&gt;Nitro&lt;/a&gt;, turrets will have a greatly increased rate of fire and will shoot quickly, and even regenerate shots quickly.\nThere's currently two Roof Modifications, Machine Gun Turret and Grenade Launcher Turret.\nMachine Gun Turrets are controlled by the passenger. They fire tons of bullets that deal 30 damage to players and vehicles, and will overheat after being fired for a short amount of time. They will take a brief time to be able to fire again.\nGrenade Launcher Turrets can only be controlled by the passenger. These turrets fire grenades that explode on impact similar to the &lt;a href=\"Grenade%20Launcher\"&gt;Grenade Launcher&lt;/a&gt; and have 5 shots in the magazine that can be reloaded. \nFront Bumper Modifications.\nFront Bumper Modifications allow the player to attach bumpers on the front of the car, whether it's for defense, or for aggression.\nThere are currently two front Bumper Modifications, Cow Catcher and Spiked Bumper.\nCow Catchers allow the car to drive through structures and objects much more easily, by boosting the ramming power of the car, while also adding some defensive armor to the car itself. They increase the hitbox of the car they're attached to. If a Cow Catcher is destroyed, players will have to run through a Vehicle Mod Box containing a Cow Catcher to get the modification again.\nSpiked Bumpers allow the car to deal lots of damage to structures, objects and players on impact. They do not add lots of defense to the car unlike the Cow Catcher, as they don't create a hitbox that is as big. Spiked Bumpers can also be destroyed, and players will have to run their vehicle through a Vehicle Mod Box containing the Spiked Bumpers to get the modification back.\nTire Modifications.\nTire Modifications allow the player to modify the type of tires that the vehicle uses, which could give benefits to the vehicle's movement or defense depending on the tires used.\nThere's currently two Tire Modifications: Off-Road Tires and Bulletproof Tires\nOff-Road Tires allow a car to have better traction on off-road surfaces and steep slopes. They give the vehicle more suspension and better traction uphill at the cost of a more bouncy vehicle. They can be destroyed easily due to their large hitbox, but can be regenerated again by driving the vehicle through a Vehicle Mod Box containing Off-Road Tires.\nBulletproof Tires work similarly to regular tires, with little-to-no movement changes, as they're mostly beneficial for defense. These tires can never be blown out by players and are indestructible, unlike the Off-Road Tires. The damage taken from them does not apply to the vehicle.\nOther Modifications.\nPrior to , both and the existed as &lt;a href=\"Ranged%20Consumables\"&gt;Ranged Consumables&lt;/a&gt;. Upon the release of , these were turned into a Tire Mod and a Front Bumper Mod respectively.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Armored%20Battle%20Bus\"&gt;Armored Battle Bus&lt;/a&gt;, and later the &lt;a href=\"War%20Bus\"&gt;War Bus&lt;/a&gt;, are both equipped with a &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Anti-Personnel%20Turret\"&gt;Seven Anti-Personnel Turret&lt;/a&gt;s and a &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Anti-Vehicle%20Turret\"&gt;Seven Anti-Vehicle Turret&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Lowrider%20Hydraulics\"&gt;Lowrider Hydraulics&lt;/a&gt; are a Vehicle Mod introduced in &lt;a href=\"Chapter%202%20Remix\"&gt;Chapter 2 Remix&lt;/a&gt;. They come pre-installed on &lt;a href=\"Cars\"&gt;sports cars&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chapter%202%20Remix\"&gt;Chapter 2 Remix&lt;/a&gt;. They enable a vehicle to jump after charging it for some time. When idling with a driver inside, the car will bump on its own due to the hydraulics.\nVehicles can also be infused with &lt;a href=\"Nitro\"&gt;Nitro&lt;/a&gt;, giving them abilities they wouldn't have otherwise, similar to modding them.\nIn Chapter 2, &lt;a href=\"cars\"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt; could spawn with a boot, making them undriveable. This could be considered an early version of Vehicle Mods. Similarly, some cars could spawn decayed, also making them undriveable.\nNews Tab.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nPromotional Images.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Different Vehicle types are available for all modes of transportation (land, air, water). Each vehicle is best-operable when used on their intended terrain (or lack of).\nVehicles have their own health bar. When said health bar is emptied, the vehicle will enter a \"death-state\" and be removed as a result. \nAlthough in the physical world vehicles are usually identified with a machine used for transportation, in Fortnite, stationed turrets are considered vehicles as well. They are operable entities that allow unique movement and functionality. For the same reason, rideable &lt;a href=\"Wildlife\"&gt;Wildlife&lt;/a&gt; is considered vehicles. \nMost Fortnite vehicles use some kind of fuel. Upon depletion of the fuel tank, the vehicle will be unable to move unless refilled, however they will not lose ability related to weaponry (if equipped). \nCommon Traits.\nBelow is a list of common features and traits that relate to vehicles. \nMajor mechanics.\n\"Radio Stations\".\nSome Vehicles in can access &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations\"&gt;Radio Stations&lt;/a&gt;. There are 7 radio stations: \nThese all contain copyrighted songs, featuring music from artists such as &lt;a href=\"Ariana%20Grande\"&gt;Ariana Grande&lt;/a&gt;, Juice Wrld, Drake, and &lt;a href=\"Marshmello\"&gt;Marshmello&lt;/a&gt;. Party Royale only plays music from the Fortnite Soundtrack specifically &lt;a href=\"Lobby%20Music\"&gt;Lobby Music&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoost.\nMost vehicles have a boost function with the purpose of augmenting the vehicle's velocity temporarily. There are three types of boost: the fuel boost is available at any moment to the driver and it breaches the normal speed limit of the vehicle greatly, but requires additional consumption of fuel. It can be holden until the vehicle completely runs out of fuel. The drift boost instead is granted upon drifting for a required angle, and doesn't necessarily allow the vehicle to breach its speed limit. Lastly, the cooldown boost is a boost that breaches the normal speed limit of the vehicle but only lasts a brief amount of time before going on a cooldown. It may or may not consume extra fuel depending on the vehicle.\nDamage.\nMany vehicles use tires to move in their model, but they aren't always physical. However, &lt;a href=\"cars\"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trail%20Thrasher\"&gt;motorbikes&lt;/a&gt; feature physical tires that have a separate health pool than the one of the actual body of the vehicle they are part of. For this reason they can be popped, which causes the vehicle to progressively get worse and worse handling as more tires are blown off. Furthermore, for every lost tire, the vehicle will take 1 damage point every 0,5s of travel.\nGlass panels are also common on many vehicles. They are weak spots that can be destroyed to expose the passengers to direct damage, and for this reason they have their own health pools.\nSome of the Fortnite vehicles aren't instantly defeated once they reach 0HP, instead they stay operative for a few additional seconds in order to allow the crew to get out in time. However, during this phase, the vehicles rely on a new health bar with reduced HP. If opponents empty it, they can shorten the time needed for the vehicle to explode, detonating it manually by dealing damage. Flying vehicles use an undetermined death state that only ends when they crash, so that the crew can avoid dying to fall damage. Though, opponents can blow up the aircraft as it falls.\nRepairing.\nVehicle health bars can be replenished through &lt;a href=\"Campfire\"&gt;Campfires&lt;/a&gt; (20HP/s), &lt;a href=\"Repair%20Torch\"&gt;Repair Torches&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chrome\"&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Service%20Station\"&gt;Service Stations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Slurp%20Cactus\"&gt;Slurp Cacti&lt;/a&gt;. Particularly, Chromed vehicles start repairing themselves after not having taken any damage for a few seconds, and will regenerate any lost tires or glass panels upon reaching full health again: the same applies to vehicles that are fully healed with Repair Torches."}
