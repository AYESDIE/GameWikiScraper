I mean, &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Anomalies\"&gt;The Sideways&lt;/a&gt; is kind of cool, but other than that, I\u2019m fully on his side.\nWell actually not fully. Digging into the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;IO&lt;/a&gt; takes up pretty much all my time, but I\u2019m at least doing a favor by writing this in his place. Here\u2019s what\u2019s new that can help you on the Island:\nNew Chug Splash Flavor: Chili Chug Splash.\nStaying on top of the IO 24/7 takes A LOT of energy\u2026 which is why the new Chug Splash flavor couldn\u2019t have come at a better time. \nThe Chug Splash people just dropped &lt;a href=\"Chili%20Chug%20Splash\"&gt;Chili Chug Splash&lt;/a&gt;, Chug Splash with a kick. It restores Health and Shield like you\u2019d expect, but it also gives you such an energy boost it\u2019ll give you a speed boost too. Think of eating a &lt;a href=\"Spicy%20Fish\"&gt;Spicy Fish&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Foraged%20Items\"&gt;Pepper&lt;/a&gt;. (Or don\u2019t think of it. The Chili Chug Splash tastes just like them...) And hey, since it\u2019s a Chug Splash, you can share the kick with others too. Get your squads\u2019 feet and nose running.\nChili Chug Splashes are . Exchange &lt;a href=\"Bars\"&gt;Bars&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"The%20Brat\"&gt;The Brat&lt;/a&gt; for some or find some in &lt;a href=\"Supply%20Llama\"&gt;Loot Llamas&lt;/a&gt;.\nSplash the OG Chug Splash and wear The Hunter's Cloak.\nAlongside the debut of Chili Chug Splash, the original &lt;a href=\"Chug%20Splash\"&gt;Chug Splash&lt;/a&gt; has been re-released. It may not have that kick, but the Health and Shield nutritional value is all the same. (It\u2019s also much easier on the taste buds.) Being the Chug Splash the Island knows and loves, you can pick some up as normal loot.\nIt\u2019s really difficult to sneak around when a &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Animal%29\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; is thinking I\u2019m their food. That shouldn\u2019t be an issue anymore, though, because \u2014 speaking of things returning \u2014 the Island has collectively remembered how to make a &lt;a href=\"Hunter%27s%20Cloak\"&gt;Hunter\u2019s Cloak&lt;/a&gt;. Craft a Hunter\u2019s Cloak by combining &lt;a href=\"Meat\"&gt;Meat&lt;/a&gt;. (It\u2019s honestly kind of gross, but it does take less Meat than it did before.)\nIf You're stopping by Steamy Stacks.\nSomething weird I noticed: there\u2019s a big hole at &lt;a href=\"Steamy%20Stacks\"&gt;Steamy Stacks&lt;/a&gt;. Was there an accident on the job? Did something\u2026 escape from the ground? \nCould be something for you to investigate.\n- Charlotte\n----\"What else is new in &lt;a href=\"Fortnite\"&gt;Fortnite&lt;/a&gt; Battle Royale in v18.10:\"\nSuper Level Styles and XP Improvements.\nThe Cubes have corrupted even the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pass\"&gt;Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt;! (But in a good way.) Bonus Styles for Chapter 2 Season 8 Outfits have been available for players who progress past Level 100. But now: this Season\u2019s Super Level Styles have been added!

It seems Lars\u2019 arrival to the battlefield has made some Heroes even outside of Steel Wool feel the music! From now on, all Heroes with the \u201cBand Member\u201d tag will be able to activate the Boom B.A.S.E Team Perk.

You've built up Turret Stations and made the strategic decision to fund &lt;a href=\"Shockwave%20Launcher\"&gt;Shockwave Launcher&lt;/a&gt;s over &lt;a href=\"Rift-To-Go\"&gt;Rift-To-Go&lt;/a&gt;s. Now Loopers on the &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt; are faced with another strategic decision, this time between two \"new\" items.\nCombat Assault Rifle VS. Combat SMG.\nR&amp;D for two original weapons is happening as part of the war effort: the &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Combat%20Assault%20Rifle\"&gt;Combat Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Combat%20SMG\"&gt;Combat SMG&lt;/a&gt;. Like the previous war effort round, donate Bars at Donation Boards to help your favorite choice reach 100% Funded first and be the one that becomes available on the Island!\nWhat\u2019s different about the \u201cCombat\u201d class of weapons? Sporting a tight bullet spread and exceptional power, the Combat variants of the Assault Rifle and SMG are quite a force in an expert's hands. Just watch out for the kickback! Both the Combat Assault Rifle and Combat SMG have a strong recoil that you must tame to get the most out of them.\nXP and Quest Changes.\nIn case you missed it, we\u2019ve recently updated repeatable &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;Shared Quests&lt;/a&gt; to reward more XP.

You\u2019re now able to select if you prefer to be an Impostor or Agent. Based on your choice, you\u2019ll be more likely to be selected as that role when playing Public and Private matches, although your preferred role is not guaranteed.\nAlso, we\u2019ve added an Impostors playlist with open Voice Chat! Communication will be split between players who are and aren\u2019t eliminated, while mixing both the diligent Agents and wily Impostors together. Convince the group to vote out Mancake because he was \"definitely\" faking Assignments and you were \"nowhere\" \"near\" Doggo\u2019s fragment. Those who prefer no voice communication can select an Impostors playlist with only Quick Chat enabled.\nLike your squad? Stay with Your Squad.\nKeep a good thing going! Starting now in the NA-East server region, you can select Stay with Squad with your \u201cFill\u201d team and play another match together. This feature is enabled only for Duos, Trios, and Squads modes.\n\u201cStay with Squad\u201d will be rolling out globally at a later date.\nReturn Requests.\nReturn Requests in Fortnite will now refresh over time.

For example, a player activates their remote to send a signal on a channel that teleports them back to their base area.\nRead more details on the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/using-signal-remote-manager-devices-in-fortnite-creative\"&gt;Signal Remote and Manager Device&lt;/a&gt; in the Device Updates section below and on the Fortnite Creative Documentation website.\nSwitch Device.\nThe Switch Device is a button that can be toggled between On and Off states, allowing players to turn things on and off through a single device.

To fight back, the war effort against the Cubes is producing some big guns of their own. \nMeet the &lt;a href=\"Salvaged%20B.R.U.T.E.\"&gt;Salvaged B.R.U.T.E.&lt;/a&gt; Battling the Sideways has left the war effort short on supplies, meaning this Salvaged B.R.U.T.E. has a stripped down armor hull with no overshield, making it easier for clever opponents to counter and dismantle. However, it comes battle-ready with combat effectiveness tailored for taking on wave after wave of Cube Monsters.\nOf course, Salvaged B.R.U.T.E. Stations need Bars to get off the ground\u2026 lots of Bars. Stations have been deployed across the Island where you can place funds. Once they\u2019re fully funded, they\u2019ll drop in Salvaged B.R.U.T.E.s available to Loopers in their matches.\nHelp boot up the Salvaged B.R.U.T.E. and beat back The Cube Queen\u2019s endless army.\nNaruto &amp; Team 7 in Fortnite.\nFrom the beloved anime series NARUTO SHIPPUDEN, Naruto Uzumaki and the rest of Team 7 have finally arrived in Fortnite! Their Outfits (as well as other items) are in the Item Shop starting now, and Team 7 member &lt;a href=\"Kakashi%20Hatake\"&gt;Kakashi Hatake&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to an Outfit, has covertly placed himself as an Island Character. Find him and he\u2019ll set you up with ninja-themed Quests.\nAlso, until the end of the Season, you\u2019ll be able to find &lt;a href=\"Paper%20Bomb%20Kunai\"&gt;Paper Bomb Kunai&lt;/a&gt; as a new weapon to throw at opponents. Find this explosive weapon in Chests or Loot Llamas \u2014 or exchange Bars with Kakashi Hatake for some.\nFor more info on the Team 7 activities, visit our Naruto &amp; Team 7 blog post!\nShopping Carts Roll Out.\nClean up on Aisle 3 \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Shopping%20Cart\"&gt;Shopping Cart&lt;/a&gt;s have returned to the Island! Throw a friend in the basket and scoot around with this classic \u201cvehicle,\u201d found at shopping and residential areas like Retail Row and Holly Hedges.\nThe Convergence Expands.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%20Queen\"&gt;The Cube Queen&lt;/a&gt; continues to corrupt the Island as &lt;a href=\"The%20Convergence\"&gt;The Convergence&lt;/a&gt; takes on a new shape. Drop in and pay tribute.\nXP From Accolades In Creative.\nIn creator-made maps that utilize the new Accolade Device, players will be able to earn XP towards their Battle Pass progress via Accolades set by the creator. The device is available now to all creators.\nIf you\u2019re a creator who wants more information, check out our v18.40 Creative Update post. \nMAJOR BUG FIXES\nCOMPETITIVE NOTE:\nIntroduction.\nThe v18.40 update brings several device updates, new front end changes, matchmaking changes, and the new Accolade device!\nFront-End Changes.\nNEW: LOADING SCREEN INFORMATION\nAnother new change in v18.40 is to the loading screen, where the Creator name, Island name and the 3 information bullet points specified in the My Island settings will be displayed while a player is loading into an experience. This is an opportunity to give players important information about your experience before they get there, so think carefully about what you want those information bullets to say to get maximum value out of them.\nUpdate: Matchmaking Portal Change.\nMatchmaking Portals will now require the Creator to use the version number when linking to an island code of an island that has not gone through the Creator Submission process. The portals will work as they do now if the submitted island has been approved by that process. The matchmaking portal will allow players to enter the latest approved version of that island code. \nThis prevents islands that have been reviewed to link to unreviewed islands. If the version number is not entered and the island code has not yet been reviewed an error message will be displayed.\nNew: Accolade Device.\nThe Accolade device allows creators to design achievements or accomplishments that players can complete to earn Battle Pass XP while playing your map! Creators will have several customization options to best fit the design of your experience, including Accolade Name, Accolade Type, Target Value, and Triggers.\nFor the Accolade device to be active in your experience, it will need to go through calibration. Calibration is a process of measuring data for a newly released or recently updated game, to ensure the Accolade device provides the correct amount of Battle Pass XP. \nBecause the Calibration process needs to gather data, the length of the Initial Calibration period is dependent on the amount of engagement that a map gets during that period, so will vary from map to map.\nWe\u2019ll notify Creators through email whenever there is a key event in the game\u2019s calibration. These key events include:\nFor further details on the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/using-accolades-devices-in-fortnite-creative\"&gt;Accolade Device visit the Fortnite Creative Documentation website.&lt;/a&gt; In addition to the Creative Documentation, we hosted a Q&amp;A in our &lt;a href=\"https%3A//discord.gg/QHpRDPVKdy\"&gt;Fortnite Creative Discord&lt;/a&gt; that you can view answers to questions other creators had.\nNew: Item Remover Device.\nThis device allows you to remove items directly from a player\u2019s inventory without using Checkpoints or Capture Areas. \nYou can choose the type and amount of items to remove and even add specific items to the device for precise control of what to remove. You can even force items to drop on the ground and affect all players in a team or class simultaneously.\nFor more information on the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/using-item-remover-devices-in-fortnite-creative\"&gt;Item Remover Device visit our Fortnite Creative Documentation Site.&lt;/a&gt;\nShooting Gallery Device.\nThe shooting gallery gets a whole lot of love in this update. We\u2019ve added full channel control, timers, randomizers and a bunch of other customization options to let you build the ultimate target shoot arena.\nBattle Royale Items.\nWe\u2019ve added the following Battle Royal items to Creative\nIntroduction.\nCalling all Commanders,\nThere is much to be discussed in this Status Report, so let\u2019s get right into it! Homebase Status Report - Initiate! \nCommanders are now able to earn Battle Pass experience in Save the World! \nHere\u2019s how it works: Completing missions in Save the World will reward you with accolades that will grant you varying amounts of XP based on the badges earned during the mission. A majority of XP will come from badges earned from successfully completing a mission, but there are many ways to earn more: Looting materials, crafting weapons, defeating Husks, exploring the map; all of these are ways to earn more XP in your missions. Don\u2019t forget to complete those bonus mission objectives!\n\"This feature goes live on November 16 2021 at 1 PM ET. \"\nSave the World's Winterfest Venture Season Makes Its Jolly Return.\nHexslyvania may be making its ghostly exit soon, but the chills are just getting started with the return of the Winterfest Venture Season on November 20 at 7 PM ET!\nThe return of Winterfest also brings the return of the Super Heroic Modifier where each class will gain super heroic benefits that will further strengthen their style of play.\nSoldiers, This is the perfect modifier to enhance those headshots! The damage of headshots is doubled and you\u2019ll benefit from reduced cooldowns when eliminating Husks with ranged weapons. Accuracy is key!\nConstructors, The one downside of building is that it uses up your hard earned materials. Well that problem is reduced with this modifier! Building will cost fewer materials; on top of that, this modifier gives Kinetic Overload lower cooldown and greater impact!\nNinjas, A healthy blend of Melee and Ability weaving will be key with this modifier. Focus your efforts on ability eliminations to gain increased melee damage and attack speed. Use that to your advantage as melee eliminations also reduce your ability cooldowns. Synergize your playstyle for maximum efficiency. You\u2019ll also gain double the Shadowstance stats so get in their faces and show em\u2019 who's boss. \nOutlanders, It\u2019s time for some punchin\u2019 (looking at you, Jess) as Anti-Material charge will have no cost during this Ventures Season. For all you T.E.D.D.Y slingers out there, you\u2019ll benefit from a free Fragment every 50 seconds along with increased ability damage. \nReports from the field show that the winter winds have increased the Husk resistance to trap and weapon damage, so get ready to build a squad that can pack quite a punch! \nUnwrap The Holiday Llama!\nThis Llama looks cold on the outside, but it is filled with festive heroes and weapons that will warm up Homebase. The Holiday Llama returns on November 20 at 7 PM ET.\nSurvive The Bitter Cold In Frostnite.\nBeginning on November 20 at 7 PM ET, venture out and keep the Burner filled with scavenged BluGlo. If it runs out, things get real cold real quick. As the burner health decreases the Storm Shield shrinks, so fill \u2018er up. \nThe Krampus Smashers who dwell in these cold regions are dangerous but worth the fight, dropping some much needed BluGlo. Check your quest log for Frostnite rewards, such as the loading screen / music pack and be on the lookout for weekly challenges in the coming weeks.\nSurvive as long as you can with only your scavenged loot, schematics, and wits to protect you.\nSubzero Zenith.\n\"\u201cLet's put them on ice\u201d - Subzero Zenith\"\nSniper critical hits freeze enemies for 1.6 seconds and apply Water Affliction, dealing 21 base Water Damage per second for three seconds.\nHolly Jolly Ransom.\nIt\u2019s finally time for the Holidays! The tree is up and decorated. The cocoa is nice and warm. The candy canes are minty and fresh. Still\u2026 It feels like we are missing something\u2026.Wait a minute! Where is Homebases\u2019 most festive hero, Crackshot!? Investigating a missing nutcracker case wasn\u2019t necessarily in the Homebase\u2019s holidays plans, but here we are! Completing this questline will reward you with the festive Soldier hero, Crackshot.\nCrackshot.\n\"\u201cWILL YOU HURRY UP AND SAVE ME ALREADY!?\u201d - Crackshot\"\nFrostnite Weekly Challenge 1: Frosty Turf.\nStarting on November 27 at 7 PM ET, take on the Frosty Turf Frostnite Challenge. Thanks to the ice cold temperature the terrain will be slippery and trap reloads are slower.\nDon\u2019t let this challenge give you cold feet though, as completing it will grant you with the constructor that puts the \u201caction\u201d in action figure, SGT.

These exclusive Save the World challenges will earn you 1,000 V-Bucks and 1,000 X-Ray Tickets.\n\"The Cosmetic items of this Pack will be shared through Battle Royale, Save the World and Creative game modes.

One must re-orient themselves after being flipped around, so here\u2019s a Chapter 3 Season 1 Orientation! Consider this your guide to a new beginning of Fortnite Battle Royale.\nThe Places.\nDue to a particularly cold winter, the first thing you\u2019ll notice about the Island is that the western half\u2019s a wintry biome. Perhaps stop by the suburban &lt;a href=\"Greasy%20Grove\"&gt;Greasy Grove&lt;/a&gt;, the industrial &lt;a href=\"Logjam%20Lumberyard\"&gt;Logjam Lumberyard&lt;/a&gt;, and other locales.\nLike warmer weather? To the east are the tropics, with coastal keys, palm trees, and weathered sights to see. Although The Seven have outposts all throughout the Island, the tropics are home to their home, the \u201c&lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\u201d This compound is right next to the coast, where you can get a clear view of the colossal rock statue of The Foundation. And speaking of colossal, the towering, web-covered &lt;a href=\"The%20Daily%20Bugle\"&gt;Daily Bugle&lt;/a&gt; building is also in the area.\nLike even warmer weather? In the south you can find the desert (some of it decorated in snow), but this desert isn\u2019t barren on interesting places. Go off-road racing at &lt;a href=\"Chonker%E2%80%99s%20Speedway\"&gt;Chonker\u2019s Speedway&lt;/a&gt;, revel in cozy living at &lt;a href=\"Condo%20Canyon\"&gt;Condo Canyon&lt;/a&gt;, and something that will wet even the driest eyes, \u201ccome on down\u201d to the returning &lt;a href=\"Butter%20Barn\"&gt;Butter Barn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe bolded locations above are just a few of the Island\u2019s many locales. Also, as the snow melts and reveals the grassland underneath, a previously snowed-in secret will be revealed!\nThe Weapons.\nA fresh slate of weapons awaits you on the Island. Here\u2019s a rundown of what\u2019s new!\nRANGER ASSAULT RIFLE\nMade for distance! The Ranger Assault Rifle is forceful at medium range and quite capable at long range. \nMK-SEVEN ASSAULT RIFLE\nBuilt from The Seven\u2019s technology, the MK-Seven Assault Rifle is a medium- to long-range weapon with a high rate of fire. This Assault Rifle has a sight you can use while aiming. Align your target with the sight\u2019s red dot!\nIf you want something even better, confront &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; for a special version of the MK-Seven Assault Rifle, sporting a slightly faster fire rate. \nSTRIKER PUMP SHOTGUN\nThe Striker Pump Shotgun shoots a whole lot of pellets and boasts high burst damage. Aim\u2026 then strike!\nAUTO SHOTGUN\nAn automatic ally that lays down some serious firepower. The Auto Shotgun may not deal as much damage as the Striker Pump per shot, but it has a faster fire rate and reloads two shells at a time.\nSIDEARM PISTOL\nA trusty weapon to have by your side, the Sidearm Pistol is an accurate weapon that deals high damage at medium range and high headshot damage at close range. Don\u2019t underestimate it!\nSTINGER SMG\nAppropriately named, the Stinger SMG deals high damage to both opponents and structures. It stings at medium range more than one may expect!\nHUNTER BOLT-ACTION SNIPER\nThe Hunter Bolt-Action Sniper deals high damage and can shoot three shots per clip. Get a second chance if you don\u2019t land your shot the first time! (And a third... just in case.)\nThe Pastimes.\nCAMPING\nWith its many scenic routes and landmarks, the Island\u2019s a prime place for camping out. After finding a Tent item, throw it down to assemble it, then rest in it to heal up. You can also safely stash up to three items in your Tent to collect in future matches. Two item slots are available automatically, and a third slot can be rented with Bars. For collecting your items in future matches, you\u2019ll just need to find a new Tent (or one of the many deserted ones!).\nCamping\u2019s even more fun with friends. If you\u2019re playing in a Duos, Trios, or Squads team, start a group campsite to take in the views together. After a teammate throws down a Tent, other teammates can interact with it to purchase their own Tent with Bars. The Storm rolling up on your camp? Pack your Tents and take them to a new place to set up camp \u2014 or leave \u2018em if there\u2019s no time. You can access your items in other Tents you take ownership of!\nTAKING THE CROWN (OR SEIZING IT)\nPlace highly enough in a match and you\u2019ll be bestowed a Victory Crown. You\u2019ll start your next match wearing a crown \u2014 but with bragging rights come high stakes... \nThe crown will shine in all its glory, making you stand out to those seeking a Victory Crown of their own. Hold on to your crown for bonus XP during the match, and if you\u2019re skilled enough to win while wearing the crown, you\u2019ll get an exclusive Emote \u2014 showing off the total number of Crowned Victory Royales you\u2019ve earned during the Season!\nVictory Crowns are present in the core Solo, Duos, Trios, and Squads modes. Here\u2019s how the crowns are conferred:\n\"Update (December 9, 2021): Crowns are now only conferred to the top player in Solo and the top team in Duos, Trios, and Squads\"\nMOBILITY MANEUVERS!\nRunning downhill? Try sliding to up your speed and evade enemy fire! While sliding, you still possess the abilities to shoot and build. Hold the crouch button while running to begin a slide, whether running downhill or not.\nGet fancy and swing after a slide. Starting December 11 at 10 AM ET, you\u2019ll be able to pick up &lt;a href=\"Spider-Man%27s%20Web%20Shooters\"&gt;Spider-Man\u2019s Web-Shooters&lt;/a&gt;. Use it to swing on buildings \u2014 the Daily Bugle included!\nRetreat can be graceful too. When knocked into a Down But Not Out state, you can now crawl faster to help reach the safety of your squad. You can also pick up items, sort your inventory, and open Chests and doors. (Please note that Down But Not Out players on opposing teams can no longer be shaken down.)\nQUESTS\nIn Chapter 3 Season 1, weekly Quests are no longer initiated on the Island itself. Instead, you can see what the Quests are in the \u201cQuests\u201d page in the Lobby \u2014 so you already know what you\u2019re gonna do before you board the Battle Bus. There are three main types of Quests, all of them viewable from the Quests page. You can access the Quests page during a match as well.\nIn addition to the Daily Quests that refresh each day (9 AM ET) and can be shared among party members, there are the Season and Milestone Quests that stick around the whole Season. New Season Quests are added weekly (Thursdays at 9 AM ET), and Milestone Quests have multiple stages. Get bonus XP for completing certain numbers of Daily, Season, and Milestone Quests. \nMake sure to visit the Sanctuary to experience a new type of Quest, featuring a communication device called simply \u201cThe Device.\u201d Through The Device you\u2019ll hear from &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt;, The Seven's eccentric and sarcastic mastermind, and complete Quests that\u2019ll lead beyond the Season to unlock The Seven\u2019s many secrets.\nSpeaking of Quests, A Note on XP\nStarting with last Season\u2019s v18.40 patch, players have been able to earn XP from Accolades in Creative (in maps/games/experiences that utilize the Accolade Device), as well as earn XP from Save the World.\nPlayers earn XP towards their Battle Pass progress in Save the World when they:\nCOMRADERY\nWorking Together\nSome actions on the new Island are quicker when more players chip in, like reviving a knocked teammate or starting up a Reboot Van. You'll also find special vaulted doors in your adventures that need more than one player to open. Work together with your team, form a temporary alliance with an opponent, or get creative\u2026\nMed-Mist\nIt\u2019s true you can use the new Med-Mist to heal yourself, but you can also use it to heal your teammates. Whether you\u2019re healing yourself or your allies, the Med-Mist restores Health for as long as you spray it. And you can spray it while moving on foot! Be aware there\u2019s finite substance in the spray can, so spray smart.\nGuzzle Juice\nSpeaking of healing, Guzzle Juice has also made its debut. It can\u2019t be shared like Med-Mist, but guzzle it down to restore your Health back to 100 over time. You may want to keep a low profile after drinking Guzzle Juice, as its healing will cease when you take damage from an opponent.\nThe People.\nTHE FORMER LOOPERS\nThough the Island is new to you, it\u2019s been long occupied by The Seven and those they freed from the Loop. Talk to Characters among the Island \u2014 like Guaco at Greasy Grove, Bunker Jonesy at &lt;a href=\"The%20Joneses\"&gt;The Joneses&lt;/a&gt;, and Lil' Whip at &lt;a href=\"Coney%20Crossroads\"&gt;Coney Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 to exchange Bars for goods and services.\nSPIDER-MAN AND MORE IN THE BATTLE PASS LINE-UP\nYou can put on Spider-Man\u2019s Web-Shooters no matter who you\u2019re playing as, but you can also put them on as Spider-Man himself. With the Chapter 3 Season 1 Battle Pass, unlock characters like &lt;a href=\"Spider-Man\"&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/a&gt; and, preceding him:\nLater on in the Season, unlock the leader of The Seven The Foundation.\nAnd speaking of Spider-Man, look out for new Spideys (plus a few friends and foes) dropping into the Item Shop throughout the Season!\n\u00a9 2021 Marvel\nYOU, YOUR FRIENDS, AND NEW ONES\nSome players may notice more robust player profiles! In the new Sidebar \u2014 currently in testing \u2014 click on a friend\u2019s profile to see the playlist they\u2019re currently in, their server region, selected language, Passes (whether they\u2019re a Fortnite Crew member and whether they own the Battle Pass), and your mutual friends. The Sidebar will be incrementally rolled out to all Battle Royale/Creative players at a rate depending on the test.\nLooking to add new friends? In the Sidebar, like the \u201cSocial\u201d menu before it, you can see a list of suggested friends (friends of your friends), players you recently played with, or players from your search input. Also like the previous \u201cSocial\u201d menu, the Sidebar is accessible from the top-left of the screen. The main menu (where \u201cSettings\u201d and more options can be found) is now selectable from the Sidebar.\nWhen viewing the profile of someone who isn\u2019t a friend yet, you can see if they\u2019re in your party or team, their server region, and their selected language. If they\u2019re a \u201csuggested friend,\u201d a result of your search input, or someone who sent you a friend request, you\u2019ll see your mutual friends (if any). If they\u2019re a player with whom you \u201crecently played,\u201d you\u2019ll see your last interaction. For example: \u201cPlayed Trios together 6 days ago.\u201d\nYou can adjust who can see your profile information. Edit your profile to individually select \u201cPrivate,\u201d \u201cFriends Only,\u201d or \u201cPublic\u201d visibility for your server region, selected language, and mutual friends. Passes can only be toggled to \u201cPrivate\u201d or \u201cFriends Only\u201d visibility.\n\"Update (December 10, 2021): As of December 7, the new Sidebar is no longer in testing. It has been rolled out to all Battle Royale/Creative players!\"\nThe Weather.\nAs you\u2019d expect, the Storm is an ever-present force on the new Island, but meteorologists predict more things in the forecast. Later on in Chapter 3 Season 1, see the effects of lightning and spin around in and get shot out of tornadoes.\nThe Wildlife.\nSpeaking of things to come, researchers believe there\u2019s a new addition to wildlife on this Island. Researchers theorize this species is quite large, which is why they\u2019re surprised they haven\u2019t seen it yet. \nUnlike the previous Island, Raptors have not been seen roaming the new one. Perhaps they\u2019re scared of the supposed beast? \nSome Road (Or Off-Road) Rules \ud83d\ude9a\ud83d\ude97.\n\"Competitive notes:\"\nYou\u2019re now re-oriented for the flip side \u2014 so drop in with confidence! Welcome to Fortnite .\n\"Please note: Split Screen has been disabled for the launch of Chapter 3 Season 1. We plan to re-enable it as quickly as we can.\"\n= \"Creative\" =\nIntroduction.\nThe v19.00 update brings the new Battle Royale weapons and new features, including sliding to Creative!\nAccolade Device Sample Island.\nThere is a sample island that includes multiple accolades, which you can visit to see how they work. The island code for this sample island is 2034-7205-6925. To play through this island, from the Creative lobby click CHANGE to open the Discover screen. Click the ISLAND CODE tab, then enter the island code for the sample Accolades island in the box and press Enter. The window will display information about the island.

In addition to the Creative Documentation, we hosted a Q&amp;A in our &lt;a href=\"https%3A//discord.gg/QHpRDPVKdy\"&gt;Fortnite Creative Discord&lt;/a&gt; that you can view answers to questions other creators had.\nBattle Royale Features.\nWith the launch of Chapter 3, Fortnite Battle Royale is adding some additional features that we\u2019re bringing to Creative to enhance your experiences (see more below).\nSQUAD INTERACT\nCreative and Battle Royale are adding the ability for multiple players to interact with a downed player to speed up recovery. Have a squad member down? Now two or more party members will significantly increase the pick up speed than one player!\nSLIDING\nRunning downhill? Try Sliding to up your speed and evade enemy fire! While sliding, you still possess the abilities to shoot and build. Hold the crouch button while running to begin a slide, whether running downhill or not.

This will be fixed in our v19.10 update.\"\n= \"Creative\" =\nIntroduction.\nHey Creators,\nToday we are launching the Support Device to all creators!\nOur goal is for creators to be able to make amazing, high-quality content, and for our players to have the best experience possible. \nPart of a great experience is ensuring that other players are present and that matches are full. We\u2019ve been looking into this area and seen fewer full matches than we\u2019d expect. Some of these issues were bugs (and some have already been addressed), but others are a result of how we\u2019re incentivizing creators.\nThe current pre-game HUD \u2018Support Me\u2019 feature has been in use for a while and hasn\u2019t proven itself. It doesn\u2019t provide a consistent player experience across platforms, it isn\u2019t part of the game world itself, and it's only fit for lobbies. That last point is particularly important, as it has ended up incentivizing the use of lobbies, even when the game mode would actually be better, with fuller matches, with Join In Progress enabled.\nWe recognize that not all games and experiences benefit from Join in Progress, but if your map would benefit from it, we want you to be empowered to turn it on and have players experience your map at its best, without having to compromise on your support.\nAsking For Support: Rules.\nThe only rule when asking players to support you, either by using the Support Device or using the pre-game \u201cSupport Me\u201d function is do not to force or trick players into supporting you. For example: by pretending the default \u201cSupport Me\u201d button does something else.\nSupport Device: Best Practices.\nWhen you use the Support Device, please consider these best practices.\nSupport Device: Technical Restrictions.\nWhen using the Support Device, you will find the following technical restrictions:\nUsing The \u201cSupport Me\u201d Feature In Pre-Game Lobbies.\nWhen you set the autostart option in the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/fortnite-creative-glossary/%23g\"&gt;Game settings&lt;/a&gt; of your map to any value other than Immediate, your map will automatically start with a pre-game lobby. Players joining this lobby will see a \u201cSupport Me\u201d button on their HUD, inviting them to hit a button to set your code as their active Support-A-Creator code. \nSome game modes benefit from pre-game lobbies, but not all. Instead of a pre-game lobby, consider setting autostart to immediate and instead use \u2018join in progress\u2019. You might even try both across a few days as an experiment and look at &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.epicgames.com/affiliate/en-US/fortnite-games\"&gt;your analytics&lt;/a&gt; to see what drives the best success for your map.\nIt\u2019s fine to build elements inside your experience to draw attention to this pre-game \u201cSupport Me\u201d function (\u201csignage\u201d). If you do, make sure to follow the Asking for Support: Rules.\nWe\u2019ll continue to keep an eye on the usage of this device, and we may tweak or update our best practices or rules as needed.\n= \"Save The World\" =\nIntroduction.\nAttention Commanders!\nHope you are ready for a Status Report more loaded than a holiday stocking!\nTo start, we would like to drop an early heads up that the Winterfest Ventures Season will wrap up on January 24 2021, giving you plenty of time to collect the rewards this Ventures has to offer.\nNow a note about XP in STW: As mentioned previously, XP earnings in STW will be adjusted with every new Season.

Until now! And it\u2019s actually no \u201cit\u201d\u2014 there\u2019s more than one stomping around the Island. Don\u2019t worry, though. Despite their enormous size, these creatures called Klombos are completely peaceful. (Unless provoked, but still.) \nHow can these gentle giants help you in battle? Ascend their tails to get to the blowhole on their heads, then get launched a great distance upwards to escape a tricky situation. They\u2019ve also been known to sneeze out items after snacking a bit!\nKlomberry Irresistible.\nThe Klombo diet is very diverse \u2014 they\u2019ll eat just about anything you throw in front of them. But what they love most is &lt;a href=\"Klomberries\"&gt;Klomberries&lt;/a&gt;! Pick these fruits from small bushes around the Island, then throw one near a Klombo to lead it your way. Remember: after Klombos snack a bit, items spout out! Have you accidentally (or purposefully\u2026) provoked a Klombo? Calm its rage with none other than a Klomberry.\nFun fact: Klomberries also have nutritional value for non-Klombos. Consume one for a bump in Effective Health! \nThe Return Of Tilted Towers.\nThe Island\u2019s thaw goes on, and Tilted Towers has emerged from underneath the snow and ice! Go out on the town with this classic POI from Fortnite\u2019s past: build to the top of its iconic clock tower, bust into apartments, stop by restaurants, battle it out in the underground parking garage, storm No Sweat Insurance\u2019s office, and more on your urban excursion.\nGrenade Launcher Unvaulted And Adjusted.\nThe Grenade Launcher is back and we've made some tweaks to its responsiveness! Projectiles now explode after their first bounce and fire more directly at your target. \nYou can find Grenade Launchers from Rare Chests, Supply Drops, and\u2026 sharks.\nYou Dropped This \ud83d\udc51.\nWith v19.10, the Crowning Achievement Emote now displays more than 99 Crowned Victory Royales. If you had reached more than 99 before v19.10 (super impressive), your crowns were still being tracked and are now updated accordingly!\nICYMI: Last Week's Balance Changes Hotfix.\n\"Balance changes made in a hotfix last week:\"\nSTINGER SMG\nMK-SEVEN ASSAULT RIFLE\nAUTO SHOTGUN\nMajor Bug Fixes.\n= \"Creative\" =\nIntroduction.\nThe v19.10 update is starting the year off with some big new features, including many community requested features! The Real Time clock, Map/Scoreboard, Creative Name Tags, Creature Manager all receive updates. We\u2019ve also added some awesome new devices including the Prop Manipulator, Player Counter, and the Pop-up Dialog device.\nCreators, as a reminder the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs\"&gt;Fortnite Creative Documentation Site&lt;/a&gt; is updated with additional details, use cases, and thought starters for newly released and updated devices. \nNote: With 19.10 we've introduced a new feature called Contextual Filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. For example, on the new Prop Manipulation device, when the Affects All Objects option is set to In a Zone, three additional options display that allow you to set the Height, Width and Depth of the zone. This feature is added to just a few devices in this release, but we will be adding it to other devices in future updates. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.\nNew: Prop Manipulator Device.\nPossibly one of the most requested features ever - this device provides the ability to manipulate the visibility and collision of props, as well as override their health values and send signals when they get damaged or destroyed. Simply attach the device to a single prop or make it into a volume to encompass any number of props and you can toggle the visibility of those props with transmitters as well as perform a few other nifty functions.\nWe plan to add more features to the &lt;a href=\"Prop%20Manipulator\"&gt;Prop Manipulator&lt;/a&gt; in future releases to give you even more control over your worlds.\nFor more details, we\u2019ve added the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/using-prop-manipulation-devices-in-fortnite-creative\"&gt;Prop Manipulation device to the Fortnite Creative Documentation site&lt;/a&gt;.\nNew: Icon Library.\nWe\u2019ve added a new library of 90 icons that can be attached to various devices to add some flavor and context to your experiences. These can be used to show points of interest on the map, lead players to specific areas or objects, or give context to devices like the Capture Area. \nWe\u2019ll be adding new icons to the library and adding icon support to more devices in future updates.\nThe devices which can utilize the Icon Library from this release are:\nWe had hoped to include support for the Objective Device gallery in this initial release, but it proved a little more tricky than expected, so you can expect it to be added in an upcoming release in the near future.\nNew: Player Counter Device.\nThe Player Counter device provides two major new features to empower Creators to control the flow and balance of games:\nIt allows you to check how many players are in a specific area (with optional team and class filters), compare it against a target number and then send a signal based on whether it passes or fails the comparison.\nIt allows a signal to be sent whenever a player joins or leaves a game in progress.\nThere are a whole bunch of different options and subtle tweaks that make this device extremely powerful, so be sure to check out the full documentation for it and spend some time experimenting to unlock its full potential.\nFor more details, we\u2019ve added the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/using-player-counter-devices-in-fortnite-creative\"&gt;Player Counter device to the Fortnite Creative Documentation site&lt;/a&gt;.\nNew: Pop-up Dialog Device.\nThe Pop-up Dialog device allows you to display information to players in a completely new way! With up to two customizable button responses and the option to use simple markup within the text, you can now create information boxes and tutorials, or link dialogs together to create branching choices.\nWe plan to add more customization options to the Pop-up Dialog device in future releases.\nHere are the markup codes you can currently use in the dialog text to format it:\nFor more details, we\u2019ve added the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/using-popup-dialog-devices-in-fortnite-creative\"&gt;Pop-up Dialog device to the Fortnite Creative Documentation site&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpdate: Real Time Clock.\nGet your event countdown ready! We\u2019re updating the Real Time Clock device with two heavily requested features: \nWe\u2019ve updated our &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/using-real-time-clock-devices-in-fortnite-creative\"&gt;Fortnite Creative Real Time Clock Device documentation&lt;/a&gt; with the details you need to set yourself up for running an event using the Real Time Clock.\nUpdate: Creature Manager.\nAnother heavily requested feature from the community: the Creature Manager device can now be enabled and disabled via channels, allowing you to easily create ramping difficulty levels by switching between managers during a game.\nUpdate: Map/Scoreboard.\nWe\u2019ve updated the map and scoreboard to make it possible to view both screens in one location and to remove the necessity for map and scoreboard display to be an either/or option in the settings. The Map Screen Display setting in the My Island UI screen will determine which screen is shown by default when the player presses the Map key, but they will then be able to switch between the two using tabs at the top of the screen.\nIf you don\u2019t want players to be able to see the map for whatever reason, we\u2019ve added a Display Overview Map option - setting it to NO will simply show \u2018Map Not Available\u2019 when players switch to the Map tab.\nUpdate: Creative Name Tags.\nWe\u2019ve added a number of new options to the My Island settings screen and Team Settings and Class Designer devices to provide more control over when and how player name tags are displayed to help Creators cut down on visual noise during their experiences.\nThe old Player Names &amp; Location option has now been renamed to Always Show Name Plates and the values have been renamed slightly:\nWhen set to ALWAYS SHOW TO TEAM, friendly players will always be able to see your Name Plate, but enemies will follow the rules set with the new options we\u2019ve added.\nWhen set to NO, Name Plates will be shown to or hidden from all players based on the rules set by the new options:"}

See below for the details of this update!\nSneak Inside Covert Cavern And Seek The Mythic Stinger!\nDeep inside the mountains north of &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Cuddle\"&gt;Camp Cuddle&lt;/a&gt;, a high-tech new POI has appeared: &lt;a href=\"Covert%20Cavern\"&gt;Covert Cavern&lt;/a&gt;. Navigate its central waterway and harvest materials from its many facilities.\nRumor has it that &lt;a href=\"Covert%20Cavern\"&gt;Covert Cavern&lt;/a&gt; is home to a Mythic version of the &lt;a href=\"Stinger%20SMG\"&gt;Stinger SMG&lt;/a&gt;, possessing more power than a regular one (and more recoil to match). However, getting your hands on it is no easy feat\u2026\nHeavy Shotgun Returns With Heavy Updates.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Shotgun\"&gt;Heavy Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; has been unvaulted in a refashioned form for Chapter 3. It\u2019s now single slug, longer-range, and requires more accuracy.

This is a bug that will be fixed in a future game update. \nHaven Un-Unmasked!\nWith v19.20, begin unlocking all the masks of Chapter 3 Season 1 Battle Pass Outfit &lt;a href=\"Haven\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt;!\n\"How\" do you unlock Haven\u2019s masks? Collect Feathers in Chests around the Island, then spend your Feathers in the \u201cHaven\u2019s Masks\u201d section of the Battle Pass tab. Each mask has a special Quest for you to complete to make the mask available to redeem. For example, catch fish to unlock cat masks, forage to unlock deer masks, glide to unlock owl masks, and more! \nEach mask\u2019s Quest can be found in the \u201cHaven\u2019s Masks\u201d Battle Pass section, and every mask is unlockable all the way \u2018til the end of Chapter 3 Season 1. (Please note that players must own the Haven Outfit before starting the Quests.)\nUpdate On XP In Creative.\nWe\u2019re improving the XP Beyond Battle Royale experience! Usually, Creative Islands undergo \u201ccalibration\u201d before they begin granting Battle Pass XP from your in-game Accolades (sometimes taking several days). Now with v19.20, if you triggered an Accolade before calibration was complete, you\u2019ll be rewarded with the XP once it\u2019s available!\nForecast Update.\n have been added to &lt;a href=\"Team%20Rumble\"&gt;Team Rumble&lt;/a&gt;!\nMajor Bug Fixes.\nThe v19.20 update is warming up as we continue into the new year. XP earned during the calibration has been updated to allow players to earn XP even while an island is being calibrated! While players are battling it out for XP, creators can now really turn things up another level by enabling fire \ud83d\udd25 in their islands. \nCreators, remember the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs\"&gt;Fortnite Creative Documentation Site&lt;/a&gt; is updated every patch with additional details, use cases, and thought starters for newly released and updated devices. \nACCOLADE XP CALIBRATION.\nGet ready to share the big news with your players, Creators. We\u2019re improving the XP Beyond Battle Royale experience! As you know, Creative Experiences undergo \u201ccalibration\u201d before they begin granting Battle Pass XP from your in-game Accolades. Now with v19.20, if a player has triggered an Accolade before calibration was complete, they\u2019ll be rewarded with XP once the Experience is calibrated! \nAdditionally, Creators will be notified through email on the calibration status of their Experience. \nREQUIREMENTS \nPlayers who previously participated in Creative Experiences while they were undergoing calibration within the last 30 days may be rewarded XP retroactively when these Experiences pass calibration.\nCLAIMING REWARDS\nPlayers can claim their XP reward when they log into Fortnite.\nNEW: NATURAL FORCES - FIRE.\nFire is a force to be reckoned with and Creators now have the ability to enable fire effects in their experiences! We\u2019re also bringing some new fire weapons from BR into Creative for the first time. We\u2019ll be adding additional ways to control fire in future updates.\nNew Fire items:\nNEW: GAS FOR VEHICLES\nSpeed around the race track to beat that time trial but don't forget to fuel up! Creators who really want to spice up vehicles in their maps can now include Gas Cans and have them fuel the vehicles in their islands. We\u2019ve also added a configurable &lt;a href=\"Fuel%20Pump\"&gt;Fuel Pump&lt;/a&gt; device to let your players gas up and get going.\nNEW: SKYDIVE VOLUME.\nYou may have felt the effects of the Skydive volume if you\u2019ve taken part in some of our previous music experiences, but now this device is available to everyone to send players flying! Create air elevators, wind tunnels and more as you experiment with all the cool features of this new device.\nFor more details, we\u2019ve added the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/using-skydive-volume-devices-in-fortnite-creativeSkydive\"&gt;Volume to the Fortnite Creative Document site&lt;/a&gt;.\nUPDATE: SENTRY DEVICE.\nThe Sentry is the latest device to be changed from a Trap device to a prop. But that\u2019s not all, we\u2019ve added a whole bunch of features to the new version including adding Sentries to teams, a whole new Idle &gt; Alert &gt; Hostile system and a bunch of new transmitters and receivers to give Sentries a whole new lease on life.

A new option Custom Objective Text is also added to allow creators to customize the objective name text on HUD.\nIN TESTING: AI SPAWN LIMIT.\nWe\u2019ve raised the maximum number of Fiends and Animals that can be spawned at once from 20 to 30 (of each type). We\u2019ll be monitoring performance impact and may increase or decrease that limit depending on the results.\nUI FIXES.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Also, the initial mode selection screen (which appeared on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC) has been removed, meaning you\u2019ll now load directly into the Lobby.\nRead below for v19.30 details.\nGyro and Flick Stick- More Controller Options!\nMade in collaboration with input specialist and flick stick creator Julian \u201cJibb\u201d Smart, we\u2019ve added optional gyro controls to Fortnite on gyro-supported platforms. And flick stick too!\nFortnite on Nintendo Switch and Android had gyro-based motion controls before the release of v19.30, but this update brings more robust gyro controls to Fortnite on these two platforms plus PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.\nWith gyro controls, you control the camera by turning the controller. Enable or disable gyro controls in Fortnite by going to the \u201cTouch and Motion\u201d tab of the settings. Gyro controls can offer more precision than standard stick aiming \u2013 but don\u2019t have to replace it entirely. (With flick stick, for example, pointing the right stick moves the camera quickly in its direction.)

Want to hide the HUD just for players in a specific area? Now you can set everyone in the area to a specific Class and then change the HUD just for them, leaving everyone else in the game unaffected.\nUpdate: Teleport Linking.\nTeleporters can now be linked together allowing for two-way travel. This can be used along with randomized teleport targets to create a \u2018different every time\u2019 map layout which is random when a player first goes through the teleporter but then remains constant for the rest of the game (or until the link is broken via Channels).\nIntroduction.\nGreetings Commanders,\nAs some of you may have already noticed, the Save the World playlist has made its new home in the Discover menu!\nTo find the newly relocated Save the World playlist, select the 'Change' button in the Fortnite main lobby and navigate to the 'By Epic' row or your Recently Played.

{"id": "95768", "revid": "49555758", "url": "https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki?curid=95768", "title": "Update v19.40", "text": "Update v19.40 of &lt;a href=\"Fortnite\"&gt;Fortnite&lt;/a&gt; was released on March 1st, 2022.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nIntroduction.\nSwoop in and save the day in Fortnite Battle Royale v19.40:\nAmazing Web Week.\nThe v19.40 update presents Amazing Web Week! From March 1 at 9 AM ET to March 8, 2022, at 8:59 AM ET, find &lt;a href=\"Spider-Man%27s%20Web%20Shooters\"&gt;Spider-Man's Web Shooters&lt;/a&gt; as Chest loot on the Island. (In addition to their regular spots!) If you want even more airtime \u2014 or just wanna send villains out of your sights \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Bouncer\"&gt;Bouncer&lt;/a&gt;s will be unvaulted for Amazing Web Week. Find them on the ground and from Supply Drops!\nWhile in aerial action, you can complete &lt;a href=\"Amazing%20Web%20Week%20Quests\"&gt;Amazing Web Week Quests&lt;/a&gt; for extra XP. \ud83d\udd78\nA new themed week will begin after Amazing Web Week ends. This week starts March 8 at 9 AM ET, bringing with it a new batch of special Quests. Stay tuned for more info! \nProximity Voice Chat in Impostors.\nv19.40 enhances the Voice version of Impostors! The \u201cImpostors (Voice)\u201d playlist now uses proximity voice chat, meaning who you hear is based on who\u2019s around your character. As before, voice communication is split between players who are and aren\u2019t eliminated, while mixing both the Agents and Impostors together. Even though eliminated players can\u2019t voice chat with non-eliminated players, they can still hear them to keep up with the drama. \nPlayers who prefer no voice communication can still select the \u201cImpostors\u201d playlist (which has Quick Chat enabled only).\nAdjust The Time Of Day In Replay.\nOn platforms that support Fortnite replays, you can now change the time of day when playing back a replay! This can be done for replays that take place in Battle Royale or in Creative Islands where the time of day hasn\u2019t been set by the Island\u2019s creator. \nTo adjust the time of day in a replay, select the camera settings (denoted by the camera with the gear in the middle), navigate to the clock icon, then use the slider to choose the time of day you want. You can also choose to pause the time of day.\nIntroduction.\nThe v19.40 update brings a brand new device in the Guard Spawner! Along with the Guard Spawner, we\u2019ve updated several additional devices, and are introducing island trailers into Fortnite Discover in the v19.40 update.\nCreators, remember the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs\"&gt;Fortnite Creative Documentation Site&lt;/a&gt; is updated every patch with additional details, use cases, and thought starters for newly released and updated devices. \nIsland Trailers in Fortnite Discover.\nBig news, island trailers are now live v19.40! Make sure to check out the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.epicgames.com/fortnite/news/submitting-your-fortnite-creative-island-for-discover\"&gt;Submitting your Fortnite Creative island for Discover&lt;/a&gt; blog post for all the updated criteria for trailers when submitting your island.\nIf you have ever uploaded an island trailer with your island through the Discover submission form, your trailer will autoplay above the game tile when a player selects your island in Discover. If you need to update your island trailer, it is recommended that you resubmit your island with the updated trailer using the Discover submission form. \nAs an additional note, audio will not be supported at the time of launch. Also, if a trailer is uploaded it will supersede the current render image when a player expands your game to learn more. Both your image and the video are important to bringing players to your game, however if you only want to use an image for your experience, do not add a trailer when using the submission form. \nNEW: Guard Spawner.\nBe on your Guard! Or at least tell your players to be, since this update sees the full release of the Guard Spawner to Fortnite Creative. The Guard Spawner shares a lot in common with the Creature Spawner, so if you\u2019re used to working with Fiends you\u2019ll get to grips with Guards in no time at all. We\u2019ll leave you to discover all the details yourselves, but some of the highlights of the system include:\nAs a bonus, here are some tips from our design team:\n\"Known Issues: Guard eliminations are not currently tracked properly by the Tracker device.\"\nNEW: Supply Drop Spawner.\nIncoming! We\u2019ve added a new device to let you create your own Supply Drops with a whole host of configuration options. Now you can rain gifts down on your players for them to rejoice over or fight over - your choice!\nUPDATE: Round Settings - Enable Matchmaking.\nThe ability to turn matchmaking off has been available on the Round Settings device for some time now. With this update we\u2019ve now added the ability to turn it back on as well! Combined with the recently released Player Counter device, you can now monitor the number of players in your game and turn the flow of new players on and off to keep your game running at your ideal capacity.\nPrefab &amp; Gallery Updates.\n\"Known Issues: We are aware of a material issue happening when using the Background Snow Dunes on Nintendo Switch.\"\nIntroduction.\nAttention Commanders,\nWe have quite the wild Status Report for you today, so let's hop right in. Homebase Status Report - Initiate!\nWildlife Has Torn Its Way Into Save The World, And Take On The New Brawl Of The Wild Questline.\nGood news! The Wildlife of the land has begun to adapt to The Storm's forces and are now re-emerging into the environment. The flip side of this good news though\u2026 Some of the local Wildlife aren\u2019t very friendly- yet. Confronting these beasts is very dangerous, but learning how to work with them may be the key to fighting back against The Storm.\nUse bait to make friends with the Wildlife, or take the more defensive approach.. And by that I mean hide in the shadows while they pick their own fights with the Husks. Either way, the day is ours!\nCreature Taming 101: In order to tame an aggressive creature, throw a consumable like meat, corn, or mushrooms near it; while they are too distracted by the bait to focus on attacking you, go up and interact with them. This act of kindness shows the Wildlife that you are a friend, not food, which will encourage them to follow your lead. \nHomebase has got your back in terms of weapon slot usage. We\u2019ve added a new consumables slot for things like the newly added pet consumables, M80s, Impulse Grenades, Port-A-Forts, etc. \nOne thing we considered when making these new consumables was to not break existing Hero Loadouts that specifically focus on using consumables. Things like Coconuts, Sub Wafers, and Cannonballs will remain bound to weapon slots to prevent any clashing with pet consumables.\nNote: Coconuts, Cannonballs and Sub Wafers will be able to be slotted in the consumables slot in a future update to further free up weapons space.\nTamed Wildlife will help you for the remainder of the mission, but once you return to your Homebase, they will return to the wild. Commanders can tame only one Wildlife at a time, so choose your companion wisely!\nNow that you know how to tame them, let\u2019s formally introduce you to the new members of our ecosystem.\nWOLVES\nThe iconic apex predator! Wolves are very well balanced combatants as they can take a decent punch and do decent damage as well.\nWolves have wide jaws, making their bite capable of damaging multiple enemies at once! This can be very advantageous when fighting against packs of Husk.\nRAPTORS\nAn ancient and powerful creature has returned. Raptor\u2019s razor sharp claws give their enemies a nice dose of Affliction! \nAffliction causes damage over time, which makes it very useful vs high health enemies such as Bosses and Mist Monsters.\nBOARS\nThese stocky creatures do not deal as much damage as a wolf or raptor but they can still easily dispose of smaller Husks and are strong enough to push around those beefy Huskies with their ferocious charge! Thanks to their sturdy build, Boars can soak up a lot of damage.\nBoars make great allies outside of combat as well; they will go out of their way to dig up hidden loot for their favorite Commanders!\nCHICKENS\nNaturally, Chickens aren\u2019t suited for combat, but they can still provide quite the helping hand- or wing in this case. Grabbing onto a Chicken will allow you to glide when jumping or falling from a distance.\nCROWS\nSadly, Crows don\u2019t make very good friends\u2026 But word has it that hunting these foul fowls may reward you with valuable loot. \nKeep your eye out for the Crows that glow purple or orange, they will provide high rarity loot!\nFROGS\nLike the Crows, Frogs aren\u2019t the kind of creature that will want to help out; but at least their meat makes perfect bait!\nBRAWL OF THE WILD QUESTLINE\nThe Homebase Crew needs your help in dealing with the outbreak of Wildlife! Hunt them, tame them, electronically communicate with them (you'll have to ask Dennis about that one). Do whatever it takes to adjust to our new furry neighbors. Completing this Questline will reward you with the mysterious wolf lady, Gia!\nGIA\n\"\u201cI\u2019ll show you how to run with wolves\u201d- Gia\"\nComing March 6 (7 PM ET) - Battle Hound Jonesy Unleashes Into The Event Store, And Watch The Doors In The Shortcut..\nBATTLE HOUND JONESY\n\"\u201c I have a bone to pick with The Storm\u201d- Battle Hound Jonesy\"\nSHORTCUT\nTeleporting Husks are a-door-able\u2026 but their elements? Not so much! Strange doors appear near the enemy spawners. When husks get near one of these doors they are teleported to one of the exit doors closer to your fort. Beware! Husks that travel through these doors gain elemental effects.\nComing March 13 (7 PM ET) - Staredown Southie Gazes Into The Event Store And Get To Upgrading In The Cram Session.\nSTAREDOWN SOUTHIE\n\"\u201c Yeah I\u2019m staring at you\u2026Got a problem with that?\u201d- Staredown Southie\"\nTHE CRAM SESSIONS\nTHE ROBO-KEVIN PACK\n\"\u201cI HAVE BEEN UPGRADED\" - Robo-Kevin\"\nHomebase\u2019s triangular technologist has made the ultimate upgrade to his favorite nifty gadget - himself! \nThe Robo-Kevin Pack brings a new Hero and Outfit, the Whirrr Backbling, the Power Pick Pickaxe, the Robo-Kevin Challenges and access to Save the World. These exclusive Save the World challenges will earn you 1,000 V-Bucks and 1,000 X-Ray Tickets.\n\"The Cosmetic items of this Pack will be shared through Battle Royale, Save the World and Creative game modes. This new Pack series will have no impact on existing Founder daily login rewards or their V-Bucks earned, which is exclusive to early access Founders.

To help maintain cover, you now have an Overshield on top of your Shield and Health. The Overshield is your first line of defense: before your Shield and Health take a hit, it\u2019s your Overshield that\u2019ll crack. Your Overshield will still recover if it goes all the way down to 0.\nMovement Upgrades.\nThe battle has changed, with new ways to bring the fight:\nSPRINTING\nRun at the new, \"faster\" default movement speed. A faster default movement speed means a faster sprint too! This sprint is so fast that it\u2019ll mean pocketing whatever you\u2019re holding. Of course, sprinting super fast can't be maintained forever, so a new sprint meter will tell you how much longer you can move at that pace.\nMANTLING\nGaining the high ground has always been key to winning a battle. And fortunately, where your feet fail, your hands will now help you out. If a surface is just a little too high for your jump \u2014 or a platform just a little too far for your landing \u2014 your hands can come into play and pull you up!\nSHOULDER BASHING\nSpeaking of sprinting, sprint at doors to bash them open with your shoulder. It\u2019s probably not very polite, but at least you look cool doing it. \nBars To Turn The Tide.\nBar funding returns! As the Season progresses, you\u2019ll have new opportunities to help direct the Resistance. Chip in Bars towards pro-Resistance devices, as well as use Bars to vote for which items to unvault.\nTURRET DETERMINATION\nA different kind of vote is live right now. Instead of an item unvault vote, it\u2019s a Turret device vote! Different pro-Resistance sites need help deciding whether to install a Light Turret or a Heavy Turret. With the former, get the classic Mounted Turret experience. With the slower but beefier latter, do heavy damage to vehicles. The first site that needs help is Sanctuary! \u00a0\nARMORED BATTLE BUS\nThere\u2019s another way you can contribute with Bars right away: funding the Armored Battle Bus. \ud83d\ude8d\nThe Armored Battle Bus is a Battle Bus that\u2019s\u2026 ready for battle. This intimidating metallic machine has just about all the fixins: Chonkers tires, a Cow Catcher for extra ramming power, and a Light and Heavy Turret.\nIt\u2019s not all business with this vehicle, though. If you turn the radio on, it immediately becomes a party bus! Once 100% Funded, find an Armored Battle Bus in Resistance-occupied POIs.\nResistance Equipment.\nYou currently have a wide slate of weapons to work with. Here\u2019s what\u2019s at your disposal!\nNEW WEAPONS\nCombat SMG\nLike the Combat Assault Rifle and Combat Pistol, the Combat SMG packs a heavy punch. Tame its recoil to get the most out of its exceptional power.\nStriker Burst Rifle\nThe Striker Burst Rifle is a burst-rifle with a customized sight. Strike with this two-shot semi automatic weapon as you aim with the scope!\nUNVAULTED WEAPONS\nTHE CHAPTER 3 SEASON 1 RETURNERS\nLand And Sky.\nPOI POSSESSION\nThe Resistance and IO are locked in head-to-head disputes to claim the Island\u2019s POIs. You can tell if a POI is occupied by the IO if you see an IO Blimp overhead, Titans, IO guards, and Siege Cannons, while a POI occupied by the Resistance may feature an Armored Battle Bus, Sentry guards, and Turrets.\nIO BLIMPS\nThe IO having a bird\u2019s-eye view of the Island may seem intimidating, but you can still access their blimps from the ground. IO Blimps are attached to the ground via Ziplines, so zip up to an IO Blimp and claim its loot for yourself! How do you get back down? Either use a Zipline, use the draft of a fan to begin gliding, or launch yourself with a Siege Cannon.\nIO Machinery.\nUse the IO\u2019s artillery against them:\nIO TITAN TANKS\nWhat\u2019s one way to barrel through obstacles? An IO Titan Tank! But a Titan\u2019s good for more than just strong-arming. Fire the Titan\u2019s cannon while you drive, and if you wanna be even more formidable, have a teammate control its machine gun turret.\nIO Titan Tanks have a massive amount of Health, but their treads can be destroyed if they take enough damage. If this happens, fix \u2018em up by hand or with a Repair Torch! The Titan\u2019s a tough battle-tested machine, so what to do if you\u2019re up against one? Deal enough damage to the engine (located at the rear) to temporarily overheat its systems. This is a prime opportunity to take on the treads! \nSIEGE CANNONS\nNeed to get somewhere fast but the path\u2019s too perilous on foot? Get in the seat of a Siege Cannon and launch yourself far forward. (Or launch your teammates first, \"then\" yourself.) Mid-air, you'll be given the option to deploy your Glider, but you won't take fall damage if you don't deploy it.\nYou can still have fun with a cannon even if you don\u2019t have travel plans. In addition to using them as a transportation device, keep your opponents at bay by firing projectiles! \nHave A Cow Catcher.\nChonkers Off-Road Tires have been used to make cars offroad since Chapter 2 Season 6, but this fight against the IO calls for \"more\" modification. Available now, throw a Cow Catcher on your Joyride vehicle to boost its ramming power! (Blockades and other vehicles beware.) Throw a Cow Catcher \"and\" Chonkers on the same vehicle for the ultimate expedition.\nThe Repair Torch: A Healing Item For Your Vehicles!\nWhether your Mudflap\u2019s been subject to explosives, your Motorboat\u2019s been running too long on land, or your Titan\u2019s been targeted at the treads, fix it up with a Repair Torch! Repair Torches restore the Health of vehicles, and if they run out of fuel to ignite? Fill \u2018em back up at a gas pump! \nChapter 3 Season 2 Battle Pass.\n&lt;br&gt;\nThis Season\u2019s Battle Pass includes Sorcerer Supreme and Master of the Mystic Arts, Doctor Strange. With the Chapter 3 Season 2 Battle Pass, you can unlock characters like Doctor Strange and the characters preceding him:\nLater on in the Season, you\u2019ll be able to unlock world-class criminal Prowler in the Battle Pass!\nREPROGRAM THE OMNI SWORD PICKAXE\nOn Page 1 of the Battle Pass you\u2019ll find the customizable Omni Sword Pickaxe. When you unlock it, you\u2019ll simultaneously unlock Omni Sword Quests! New Omni Sword Quests are released every week for eight weeks and reward Omni Chips for completion. Have Omni Chips stashed up? Enter the \u201cReprogram Omni Sword Pickaxe\u201d section of the Battle Pass tab and use them for new blades, guards, colors, and sounds.\nAll Omni Sword Quests remain available until the end of Chapter 3 Season 2. You do not miss out on any Omni Sword Quests by unlocking the Pickaxe beyond the first week of the Season. \nCrowning Achievement.\nA new Season means new opportunities to flex your skill! Crowned Victory Royales displayed in the Crowning Achievement Emote have been reset with Chapter 3 Season 2.\nCompetitive Notes.\nBuilding is unaffected in competitive/Arena playlists as well as in Team Rumble and Creative Islands.\nYou\u2019re now briefed on the tools and tactics at hand \u2014 take on your opponents in the ultimate battle for the Zero Point in Chapter 3 Season 2: Resistance!\nNEW: CHAPTER 3 SEASON 2 FEATURES.\nChapter 3 Season 2 is here and in this release we\u2019re adding all the new Battle Royale features, such as mantling, overshield, new weapons and more! We\u2019ve compiled all the Battle Royale movement information in a section titled \u201c&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/building-basics-in-fortnite-creative\"&gt;Building Basics&lt;/a&gt;\u201d for Creators on the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs\"&gt;Fortnite Creative Documentation Site&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to the usual release updates with additional device information. \u00a0\nMANTLING.\nGaining the high ground has always been key to winning a battle and fortunately, where your feet fail, your hands will now help you out. If a surface is just a little too high for your jump \u2014 or a platform just a little too far for your landing \u2014 your hands can come into play and pull you up!\nSPRINTING.\nRun at the new, faster default movement speed. A faster default movement speed means a faster sprint too! This sprint is so fast that it\u2019ll mean pocketing whatever you\u2019re holding. Of course, sprinting super fast can't be maintained forever, so a new sprint meter will tell you how much longer you can move at that pace.\nOVERSHIELD.\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf your game has no building, it might be wise to throw in an Overshield to help! To help maintain cover, you now have an Overshield on top of your Shield and Health. The Overshield is your first line of defense to protect your Shield and Health, it will recharge on its own if it goes all the way down to 0. Make sure to find cover while it's recharging! \nSHOULDER BASHING.\nSpeaking of sprinting, sprint at doors to bash them open with your shoulder. It\u2019s probably not very polite, but at least you look cool doing it. \nAll these new features can be turned on and off via the My Island Settings menu.\nImportant Note: \nBATTLE ROYALE WEAPONS.\nCOMBAT SMG.\n&lt;br&gt;\nLike the Combat Assault Rifle and Combat Pistol, the Combat SMG packs a heavy punch. Tame its recoil to get the most out of its exceptional power.\nSTRIKER BURST RIFLE.\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe Striker Burst Rifle is a burst-rifle with a customized sight. Strike with this two-shot semi-automatic weapon as you aim with the scope!\nTHE REPAIR TORCH: A HEALING ITEM FOR YOUR VEHICLES!\n&lt;br&gt;\nWhether your Mudflap\u2019s been subject to explosives, your Motorboat\u2019s been running too long on land, or your Titan\u2019s been targeted at the treads, fix it up with a Repair Torch! Repair Torches restore the Health of vehicles, and if they run out of fuel to ignite? Fill \u2018em back up at a gas pump! \nNEW: FIREFLY SPAWNER.\nGreat news creators; Fireflies have migrated and have found their way to your Creative islands! Now you can place swarms of fireflies that players can collect for themselves instead of you having to grant them via devices.\nUI FIXES.\nWith the release of update v20.00, we are making a significant shift to the items available for purchase in Save the World. Save the World will no longer sell Llamas (Upgrade, People, Hero, etc), gameplay-affecting items, or items that accelerate your progression through the game for V-Bucks or real-world currency. These changes bring Save the World into closer alignment with Battle Royale, where cosmetics do not give any competitive advantage over players who choose not to pay.\nWHAT ABOUT THE ITEMS I\u2019VE ALREADY PURCHASED/COLLECTED?\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Low Input Latency has been enabled by default.\nPLAYSTATION 5 - CHANGE TO HOW TO ENABLE 120 FPS IN FORTNITE.\nIt\u2019s now easier for PS5 players to enable 120 FPS in Fortnite. \nTo enable 120 FPS in Fortnite on PS5, players no longer need to go to the console settings.

To ensure all players in the region have the best experience \u2014 if you had manually selected the server region to Middle East \u2014 it has now been reverted to Auto.\nThis means that some players who are normally connected to Middle East servers will now connect to Europe or Asia. Competitors, be sure to check the Compete tab in-game for Cup starts times.\nPlayers are able to switch back to the Middle East server region if they choose to do so, but remember that this will likely result in high ping.\nFORTNITE UPDATES.\nFor more information check out the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news//v-bucks-purchased-on-playstation-join-the-fortnite-shared-wallet\"&gt;V-Bucks Purchased on PlayStation Join Fortnite Shared Wallet&lt;/a&gt; blog.\nNew: Racetrack Gallery, Cloud Prop, and More!\nRace fans get ready to make your dream track, as the v20.40 updates add 11 new galleries!

Primitives Shapes Gallery B featuring 16 new materials for creations have arrived for your use. The only limit with these is your imagination. \nUPDATE: PROMOTION OF ISLANDS WITH XP ENABLED.\nIn order to maintain a fair and consistent experience as part of our Discover experience, we're &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-creative-creator-content-rules-and-guidelines\"&gt;updating our policy&lt;/a&gt; on the in-game promotion of Islands with XP enabled. Mentioning XP in images, trailers, and the Island description can be misleading and will be disallowed; however, using the XP tag is still completely fine! \nFor new or updated Islands, please ensure your Island assets correctly reflect the experience your map provides.\nNote: The policy blog has not yet been updated to reflect this change.\nOTHER UPDATES AND CHANGES.\nThese can be accessed by setting \u201cOvershield: More Options\u201d and \u201cSprinting: More Options\u201d to SHOW.

Fortnite Shared Wallet is not currently supported by the Nintendo Switch platform, meaning V-Bucks purchased on other Shared Wallet platforms will not be usable on your Nintendo Switch and vice versa. \nAs always, V-Bucks earned on any platform through the Battle Pass, Quest Packs, or Save the World are shared across all other platforms.\nFORTNITE SHARED WALLET FAQ.\nI PURCHASED V-BUCKS ON A PLATFORM THAT SUPPORTS FORTNITE SHARED WALLET, BUT I DON\u2019T SEE THEM ON ANOTHER PLATFORM THAT SUPPORTS IT. WHAT SHOULD I DO?\nMake sure that the account you\u2019re logging into Fortnite with is the same Epic Games account, or connected to the same Epic Games account (if you\u2019re logging in on console), that you use across other platforms. For help linking your console account(s) to your Epic account, see the following help articles:\nIf you purchased V-Bucks through the Microsoft or PlayStation Store, you must log into Fortnite on the corresponding platform to receive them before accessing them across all other Shared Wallet platforms.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nWHY DON\u2019T MY PURCHASED V-BUCKS TRANSFER ACROSS ALL PLATFORMS?\nCurrently, only PlayStation, Xbox, PC, Android, and cloud gaming services support Fortnite Shared Wallet. This means your V-Bucks balance may change depending on what platform you\u2019re on. Examples below:\nThe restrictions outlined above apply to purchased V-Bucks only. Any in-game content purchased with your V-Bucks, such as Outfits, will be available across all platforms. \n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

You\u2019ll activate a charge by holding down the trigger, and the more you hold it, the more bullets you\u2019ll release when you let go. How to know when to release? You\u2019ll see a gauge on-screen showing how far in the charge you are. Send a strategic full charge or a spontaneous partial charge!\n\"(With the arrival of the Charge SMG, the &lt;a href=\"Combat%20SMG\"&gt;Combat SMG&lt;/a&gt; has been vaulted.)\"\nFORTIFY FAST WITH THE PORT-A-FORT.\nNothing says good vibes like convenience: the Port-A-Fort is back!

Now instead of hitting a button to repair the build you have selected for every object, players will hold to Repair and \u201csweep\u201d their reticle across all buildings and traps they want to repair or upgrade, executing the command instantly as they go. \nNote: \u201cHold to Repair\u201d is currently only available in Save The World.\nHOVERBOARD GOES VROOM.\nAlongside movement upgrades putting some spring in your step, Hoverboards have been souped up!

If your device is compatible, you will find this option available in the settings within the Video tab (the default tab when opening the settings). If your device does not have this option available, this means it does not meet the technical requirements.\nPlease note that toggling this option on may drain the power of your device and/or increase the heat output.

In Fortnite Battle Royale v21.50, let the spirit of Phantasm (no pun intended) guide your battle strategy!\nSHADOW OF PHANTASM WEEK.\nA samurai in life and a phantom in the afterlife, stealth is no stranger to &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.epicgames.com/fortnite/news/phantasms-level-up-quest-pack-manifests-in-fortnite\"&gt;Phantasm&lt;/a&gt;. In the upcoming Shadow of Phantasm Week, the Suppressed Assault Rifle, Suppressed SMG, Shadow Bomb, and Shield Bubble will be unvaulted! Complete special Quests for XP while using these items that are back with a vengeance. Shadow of Phantasm Week starts August 30 at 9 AM ET and ends September 7, 2022, at 9 AM ET.\n\"The Shield Bubble may not be stealthy\u2026 but it's a futuristic fit for futuristic samurai.

What about the Quests? The Quests will be findable on the Quests page in the \u201cShadow of Phantasm Week\u201d category!\nKEEP WIELDING THE POWERS OF SON GOKU.\nEven though the Fortnite x Dragon Ball \u201cPower Unleashed\u201d Quests have ended, Capsule Corp continues to send deliveries! The Kamehameha and Nimbus Cloud (Kintoun) items are still on the Island, just at a lower rate of appearance.\nIMPOSTORS HEADS TO THE VAULT.\nThe Bridge, for now, is safe.\nIn the v21.50 update, we\u2019ve vaulted the Impostors playlists as our teams shift focus to other Fortnite projects. We want to extend a thank you to everyone who\u2019s trusted, betrayed, and of course, Peely Party\u2019d together during its limited release.\nAlso, we've &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.epicgames.com/fortnite/news/fortnite-creative-v21-50-update\"&gt;added Impostors Prefabs and Prop Galleries in Creative&lt;/a&gt; for you to create and play your own experiences!\nMAJOR BUG FIXES.\nThe v21.50 update brings the new Melee Designer device and Rainbow Royale flag prop, Immersive First-Person Editing, higher player maximums on islands, and other UI and quality-of-life improvements! Plus, we've added Imposters Prefabs and Galleries and Colossal Crops Prefabs, and made several updates to other Prefabs and Galleries.\nMELEE DESIGNER / MELEE WEAPONS.\nSwords and hammers are now in Creative! You can use the Melee Designer device to customize a melee weapon. Some examples of customizations are: changing the amount of damage it does, giving it a special name, giving it special attacks, or deciding whether it affects the player's stats. Keep in mind:\nCustomize your melee weapon the way you want it, then use the Melee Designer to spawn as many copies as you need to drop into other devices.\nIMPORTANT: Deleting a Melee Designer device will cause all weapons spawned from that device to permanently revert to default settings.\nThe Melee Designer introduces a complex new set of behaviors to Fortnite Creative, so we consider this device to be in an open beta state. That means that even with our extensive testing, there will likely be some unexpected bugs that you discover as you start using these new systems. Please report any issues that you find through the usual channels in the official Fortnite Creative Discord.\nCurrent known issues are:\nWe're currently working on these issues, and they should be fixed within the next couple of updates. We would also love to get your feedback on the system as a whole, as well as what features you'd like to see added in the future.\nRAINBOW ROYALE.\nAs part of the upcoming Rainbow Royale event, a new Rainbow Royale flag prop has been added to General Props Gallery A. There are plenty of other great things planned for Rainbow Royale, so check out the Fortnite Creative social media channels to learn more!\nISLAND THERMOMETER ON ALL ISLANDS.\nThe XL (extra large) islands use a grid-based memory thermometer, meaning whatever is placed in one grid square only contributes to the memory budget of the grid squares it influences. This feature is now active on all islands! This will make it easier for you to balance your islands and make the most of your memory budget.\nIMMERSIVE (FIRST-PERSON) EDITING.\nYou can enter first-person mode while building in Create mode on your islands. This will give you a finer degree of control when you are placing terrain, structures, or devices. The setting for Immersive Editing is in your Quick Menu, which you can open using the Options hotkey.\nLike the Melee Designer device, this system is complex. Despite our extensive testing, Immersive Editing is likely to have some bugs and edge-cases that we haven't found, so we consider this an open beta feature. You can help us out by reporting any issues you have when you're using the feature.\nTEAM AND PLAYER MAXIMUM INCREASED.\nYour islands can now have up to 60 players or teams!\nSERVER LIFETIME NOTIFICATIONS.\nWe have changed the way that server lifetime and restart is handled. Previously when you arrived on your island, there was a Storm countdown, and the Storm eliminated you when the server was about to restart. Now, there are pop-up messages that alert you to the remaining server lifetime, and the server automatically returns anyone on the island to the Fortnite Lobby when it restarts.\nOTHER UPDATES.\nCREATE MODE OPTIONS UPDATES.\nIn the Quick Menu, two new values have been added to the Flight Speed option: 0.1x and 10x.\nBUG FIXES.\nGAMEPLAY FIXES.\nThe Hexsylvania Venture season has returned, and with it some frightening questlines, Heroes, and Llamas!\nThe mysterious energy of Hexsylvania has been unleashed once again, granting Husks a modifier that reduces their damage taken from weapons, abilities, and traps! Combat these newly resilient fiends with a frightful Short Range modifier, causing Husks to take 50% more damage when within two tiles of a Commander or Defender. Hexsylvanian Husks also have a chance to drop healing potions when taken out at close range, giving you a quick Health refresh mid-fight.\nHexsylvanian Husks may be intimidating, but there\u2019s plenty of treats available once you\u2019ve put an end to their tricks!\nDIRE\u2019S WOLFY BUSINESS QUESTLINE IS BACK.\nEver seen a Super Blood Moon? No werewolf can resist! Join Director Riggs in tracking down their yearly \u201cPackstravaganza\u201d by recruiting the beastly Dire to your squad. With the uniquely nocturnal perk Night Stalker, Dire grants bonus movement speed during evening and night \u2014 and as a Commander, Dire\u2019s ability energy cost is also reduced.\nWATCH YOUR STEP - DUNGEONS HAVE RETURNED.\nThere\u2019s no reward without a little risk! Dungeons have reopened below Homebase and it\u2019s time again to brave the tricks and traps around every corner. Find Magical Keys, collect Gold Coins, and eliminate Monsters as you descend through five different Dungeons \u2014 all while recruiting Weapons and Heroes along the way!

And as the Commander, Quick Fingers also has a chance to spawn a Phantasm.\nComplete Dungeons to unlock these nightmarish Heroes, Candy for Llamas and loot, a Loading Screen, and more.\nENOUGH TRICKS, TIME FOR TREATS WITH FORTNITEMARES LLAMAS.\nThis spine-chilling Llama is filled to the brim with Haunted Heroes like Kyle the 13th, ghostly weapons like the Night Owl, and Survivors in cosplay! Candy can be earned from completing missions during the Hexslyvania Venture season, and can be exchanged for these limited-time Fortnitemares Llamas.\nThose aren\u2019t all the treats, however! Slot three Legendary Fortnitemares Survivors into the Collection Book and make it rain pumpkins with the Jack-O-Launcher as a reward. Also, keep an eye on the Event Store every week for seasonal favorites like Ragnarok, Plague Doctor Igor, and the Black Blade.\nINTRODUCING NIA THE CROSSMARK OPERATIVE.\nBe ready for anything the Husks throw at you with the new Crossmark Operative Pack available now! Inspired by a concept from the one and only &lt;a href=\"https%3A//twitter.com/sockothy\"&gt;@sockothy&lt;/a&gt;, Nia is equal parts stealth and style.

Finish these Goals to unlock Chrome Punk\u2019s free Outfit and more!\nChrome Punk Goals:\nMAJOR BUG FIXES.\nThe Fortnite v22.30 update brings the Battle Royale Island to Creative! Using the four special devices that are preplaced on this starter island, you can create a customized Battle Royale experience of your very own. v22.20 also includes a significant UI improvement for the Spatial Thermometer memory system, new Prefabs and Galleries from The Convergence as well as other updates and bug fixes for devices, Prefabs, and Galleries.\nBATTLE ROYALE ISLAND.\nThere's a new starter island: the Battle Royale Island! With this starter island, you can use special devices to create a custom Battle Royale experience with the current version of the Fortnite Battle Royale Island. This starter island will also automatically update whenever the Battle Royale map changes, so you won't have to update it manually every Season. \nWhile you won't be able to directly edit the Battle Royale Island, you can use a selection of other Creative devices, in addition to the devices specifically for the Battle Royale Island, to create a unique experience for your players.\nNote: Experiences created with the Battle Royale Island are not currently eligible for monetization. This means Support-A-Creator (SAC) features are disabled, and that creator codes are not allowed to be advertised in experiences using the Battle Royale Island. \nHere are the new devices you can use to create your custom Battle Royale experience. These devices are preplaced on the island, and they cannot be moved or deleted. They can only be used on the Battle Royale Island.\nLOOT CONTROLLER DEVICE.\nThe &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/using-loot-controller-devices-in-fortnite-creative\"&gt;Loot Controller&lt;/a&gt; device provides loot options for Battle Royale experiences. Select from a subset of classic loot packages and determine where they are placed, then customize the frequency or presence of Rare Chests and floor loot (also known as ground loot).\nMAP SETTINGS DEVICE.\nThe &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/using-map-settings-devices-in-fortnite-creative\"&gt;Map Settings&lt;/a&gt; device controls which things spawn on the map (such as vehicles, wildlife, and Target Bots) for Battle Royale experiences.\nDEPLOYMENT DEVICE.\nThe &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/using-deployment-devices-in-fortnite-creative\"&gt;Deployment&lt;/a&gt; device controls how players are deployed for Battle Royale experiences. Choose from Battle Bus or Rift deployment, and customize a variety of options related to player spawning on the Battle Royale Island.\nSTORM CALLER DEVICE.\nThe &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/using-storm-caller-devices-in-fortnite-creative\"&gt;Storm Caller&lt;/a&gt; device determines the size, position, and phases for the Storm. Whether the Storm grows, shrinks, or moves around \u2014 it's all in your hands now!\nUSING CREATIVE DEVICES IN THE BATTLE ROYALE ISLAND.\nAlong with the new Battle Royale-specific devices mentioned above, you can also use a number of existing Creative devices by placing them on the starting platform area. Use the Battle Royale Device category in the Creative inventory screen Devices tab to see all the devices you can use. Additionally, you can still use most of the My Island settings to change the rules and look-and-feel of your game.\nNote: Target Bots are treated as players by Creative devices, not as AI enemies.\nKNOWN ISSUES.\nIntegrating the Battle Royale map into Creative has been a complex process, so we consider this feature to be in an open beta state. That means that even with our extensive testing, there will likely be a few issues and features that we haven\u2019t caught. Here are some known issues we hope to address in upcoming releases:\nSPATIAL THERMOMETER HEATMAP.\nThe Map UI now features a heatmap for the Spatial Thermometer that can display hotspots of memory more accurately by using a color gradient, as well as displaying numbers in a cell when the cell's memory usage is 80K or higher. You can toggle the heatmap between three different modes:\nThese modes affect the minimap as well. Toggle between the modes with the Thermometer shortcut (press T if you're on a PC) while in Fly mode. We hope to provide a more convenient way to access the feature in the future, so stay tuned for further updates.\nFor more information, see the updated &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/spatial-thermometer-in-fortnite-creative\"&gt;Spatial Thermometer&lt;/a&gt; page in our official Creative documentation.\nOTHER UPDATES.\nDEVICE UPDATES.\nMelee Designer: All options that have numeric values can now have those values typed into the field directly, instead of requiring that you click arrows to select one.\nBUG FIXES.\nGAMEPLAY FIXES.\nAs the Hexslyvania Venture season continues, a new Hero and weapon set make their debut in Save the World. Also, wildlife has become rideable, so jump on a boar or wolf and swiftly ride into the night as you battle Husks in Hexslyvania! As a reminder, this Venture season will end November 20, 2022, at 7 PM ET, so be sure to collect all the rewards, including Brainstorm, before then.\nEYE OF THE BRAINSTORM.\nA new Hero and questline arrive in Save the World! Make your acquaintance with Brainstorm, a new Constructor Hero. Brainstorm has the new perk Brain Freeze, which allows their D.E.C.O.Y. to explode in a frigid blast that freezes nearby enemies! Use the D.E.C.O.Y. alongside freeze traps and support perks to turn Brainstorm into a more cautious fighter that controls the battlefield in a\u2026 calculated manner.\nTo unlock Brainstorm, complete the new Eye of the Brainstorm questline!\nNEW ALIEN WEAPONS.\nFour new weapons are arriving in Save the World during this Brainstorm update!\nPULSE POUNDER.\nThis Assault weapon is fully automatic when hip-fired, shoots slower when aimed down sights, and does Energy-based damage. \nEarn the Pulse Pounder from the Eye of the Brainstorm questline! \nSHOOTING STAR.\nThis SMG weapon emits a continuous ray of\u2026 star stuff. The Shooting Star shoots a sustained beam at the target.\nAs with the Pulse Pounder, the Shooting Star can be earned from the Eye of the Brainstorm questline.\nPLASMATIC DISCHARGER.\nIt\u2019s plasmatic, it\u2019s powerful, and it packs a punch. With this new weapon, launch a slow-moving but formidable energy ball that zaps nearby objects and destroys any buildings in its path. \nThe Plasmatic Discharger can be purchased in the Event Store starting November 6, 2022, at 7 PM ET.\nTHIRD RAIL.\nCharge up this high-tech sniper rifle to aim and fire a single powerful shot, great for dealing with enemies behind walls. \nPurchase the Third Rail in the Event Store starting November 13, 2022, at 7 PM ET.\nRIDE WILDLIFE.\nLet your Heroes run wild with the introduction of rideable wildlife in Save the World! Ride on a wolf or boar until it runs out of stamina, or until damage takes its stamina away. Stamina will return over time while you\u2019re not riding and can also be restored by feeding the pet. Ride your boar into the fight and knock the Husks out of the way, while dealing a small amount of damage at the same time. If your beloved creature gets reduced to 0 health it will go into the Down But Not Out state during the fight, fear not \u2014 you can rescue it and jump back in the saddle!\nMAJOR BUG FIXES.\nA number of important bug fixes were included in the v22.30 game update, including:\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

This was the final update of and thus the final update of &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;tabber&gt;\nIn the Fortnite Battle Royale v22.40 update, a new vehicle has driven to paradise: Rocket League\u2019s Octane! When you\u2019re not behind the wheel, launch into the air with the Grapple Glider or join a large team in the Big Battle LTM.\nOCTANE\u2019S NEWEST DESTINATION.\nIn v22.10, the Octane vehicle from Rocket League boosted into Fortnite for creators to rev up their islands. Now, with v22.40, Octane has boosted into Battle Royale and Zero Build. This Battle Royale/Zero Build version is balanced for these modes, but it still has rocket boosters, supersonic speed, and the ability to jump, \"double\" jump, dodge, take flight, and drive on walls!\nGLIDE TO SAFETY WITH THE GRAPPLE GLIDER.\nAn enemy coming right at you? Or even worse, an enemy coming right at you while they\u2019re in an Octane? Make a swift getaway with the Grapple Glider \u2014 pull yourself into the air by aiming at a hard surface, then deploy your Glider to land in safe territory.\nYou can find Grapple Gliders from the ground, Chests, Chrome Chests, and Supply Drops. They have limited charges, so it\u2019s not a bad idea to save your Grapple Glider for emergencies!\nHAVE A BIG TIME IN THE BIG BATTLE LTM.\nLook around you: it\u2019s A LOT of players on your team. In the new Big Battle Limited Time Mode, you\u2019re in a team of 40 facing another team of 40. The match begins with the Storm already circling the first zone, and you\u2019ll see Uncommon-rarity items already in your loadout. The result? The action starts right away in this fast-paced, Zero Build LTM. To help you defeat the other team even faster, loot in Big Battle is Rare-rarity or higher.\n\"LTM goes live at 10 AM ET on November 15.\"\nEXPLORE THE BATTLE ROYALE ISLAND\u2026 OUTSIDE BATTLE ROYALE.\nIn the v22.30 patch, the Battle Royale Island became a \"starter island\" for creating your own Battle Royale experience in it, or for just wandering around. You can also jump into an experience made by someone else! With this new way to explore the Battle Royale Island, we'll be vaulting Battle Lab in v23.00.\nUSE/INTERACT IMPROVEMENT ON MOBILE.\nOn mobile, we have completely removed the Interact icon (hand icon) from the Fire button. Specific \u201cUse\u201d actions will now be represented by their own icon, meaning that, for example, eating and drinking actions will have their own icon now.\nMAJOR BUG FIXES.\nThe v22.40 update brings the Class Selector UI and D-Launcher devices for creators, as well as the Dial-A-Drop and Grapple Glider items to include in your experiences. Additionally, this update contains the Big Battle mode to create in your own Battle Royale Island, plus other updates and bug fixes.\nCLASS SELECTOR UI DEVICE.\nThe Class Selector UI device can create both a popup dialog and a new tab on the game's Map screen, displaying a list of classes players can choose from. You can have players choose a class when they spawn at the beginning of the game, or you can allow players to change their class during the game. By customizing device options, you can allow players to change their class by opening the Map screen and selecting a new class, or you can set a channel option to open the popup dialog during the game.\nD-LAUNCHER.\nThree new D-Launcher devices are now available:\nAdjust the launch speed and angle of D-Launchers to customize a unique trajectory for each one!\nDIAL-A-DROP CONSUMABLE.\nPlayers can use this item to call in a Health Drop, Supply Drop, or Vehicle Drop at their location. There is a limit of five Vehicle Drops per island experience. This count is displayed in the UI and will display \"Unavailable\" when the limit is reached.\nGRAPPLE GLIDER.\nPlace this item on your island and give players the ability to make a swift getaway! They can aim at a hard surface, pull themselves up, and then deploy their Glider to travel to safe territory.\nBIG BATTLE.\nIntroducing a new mode: Big Battle! You can jump into the Epic-made version of this mode from the Discover screen. But you can also create a \u201cBig Battle\u201d yourself using the new Battle Royale Island tools available in Creative! In this mode, two teams of 40 players are provided with a standardized loadout and launched into action as soon as the match starts, with the first phase of the Storm already completed. The Storm moves quickly, and the rarity for loot in the item pool is set to Rare or higher. Try out this action-packed Zero Build, large team mode on your own Battle Royale Island.\nBUG FIXES.\nGAMEPLAY FIXES.\nEven though Hexslyvania is making its ghostly exit soon, the chills are just getting started with the return of the Winterfest Venture Season on November 20, 2022 at 7 PM ET! \nAs the Hexslyvania Venture season finishes, make sure you complete all your questing, including that in the Eye of the Brainstorm questline to unlock the newest hero Brainstorm and the Pulse Pounder and Shooting Star weapons. Also, complete your Alien Weapon set by grabbing the Plasmatic Discharger and Third Rail from the Event Store before November 20 at 7 PM ET.\nBATTLE PASS XP UPDATE.\nIn the v22.40 update, we\u2019ve added a new source of Battle Pass XP to Save the World! Specifically, the majority of Daily and Weekly Quests will now award Battle Pass XP upon completion. This includes the basic Daily and Weekly Quests, along with the following:\nBecause we've shifted the majority of the XP source to Quests, you\u2019ll notice a reduced amount of XP earned from Mission Badges, but on average, we expect players will earn Battle Pass XP more quickly than before. To maximize your XP earned, prioritize completing the available Daily/Weekly quests.\nTHE WINTERFEST VENTURE SEASON MAKES ITS RETURN!\nThe Winterfest Venture Season starts November 20 at 7 PM ET!\nThe return of Winterfest also brings the return of the Super Heroic Modifier, which gives each class super heroic benefits furthering strengthening their style of play. This Modifier applies in the Flannel Falls Venture zone and does not apply in normal campaign zones or Frostnite.\nSoldiers, this is the perfect modifier to enhance those headshots! The damage of headshots is doubled and you\u2019ll benefit from reduced cooldowns when eliminating Husks with ranged weapons. Accuracy is key!\nConstructors, the one downside of building is that it uses up your hard-earned materials, right? Well that problem is reduced with this modifier! Building will cost fewer materials, and on top of that, this modifier gives Kinetic Overload a lower cooldown and greater impact!\nNinjas, a healthy blend of Melee and Ability weaving will be key with this modifier. Focus your efforts on ability eliminations to gain increased melee damage and attack speed. Use this to your advantage, as melee eliminations also reduce your ability cooldowns. You\u2019ll gain double the Shadowstance stats with this modifier, so get in their faces and show em\u2019 who's boss. \nOutlanders, it\u2019s time for some punching, as Anti-Material charge will have no cost during this Ventures season. For all you T.E.D.D.Y. slingers out there, you\u2019ll benefit from a free Fragment every 50 seconds along with increased ability damage. \nAnd for everyone, the winter winds have increased the Husks\u2019 resistance to trap and weapon damage, so get ready to build a squad that can hold its own!\nFROSTNITE CHALLENGES RETURN.\nFROSTY TURF CHALLENGE.\nStarting on November 28 at 7 PM ET, take on the Frosty Turf Frostnite Challenge! The weather will be extremely frigid for this week in Frostnite \u2014 don\u2019t get cold feet as you think about the slower trap reloads and stepping on snow. \nFor overcoming the Frosty Turf Challenge, you\u2019ll unlock Tank and a unique banner:\nSURVIVE THE BITTER COLD IN FROSTNITE.\nBeginning on November 20 at 7 PM ET, venture out and keep the Burner filled with scavenged BluGlo. If it runs out, things get real cold real quick. As the burner health decreases, the Storm Shield shrinks, so fill \u2018er up!\nThe Krampus Smashers who dwell in these cold regions are dangerous but worth the fight. Why? They drop some much needed BluGlo. Check your Quest log for Frostnite rewards, such as the loading screen / music pack, and be on the lookout for Weekly Challenges in the coming weeks.\nHOLIDAY LLAMA.\nThis Llama looks cold on the outside, but it is filled with festive Heroes and weapons that will warm up Homebase. The Holiday Llama returns on November 20 at 7 PM ET.\nSUBZERO ZENITH.\n\u201cLet's put them on ice.\u201d - Subzero Zenith\nSubzero Zenith\u2019s Standard Perk Icy Shot applies Water Affliction on Sniper critical hits. His Commander Perk Icy Shot+ allows you to freeze enemies for a short duration and apply Water Affliction on Sniper critcal hits. You can also decrease the duration of elemental status effects with his Team Perk Shake it Off!\nMAJOR BUG FIXES.\nA number of important bug fixes were included in the v22.40 game update, including:\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

You'll see returning ones too, but here's a rundown of what's new: \n&lt;a href=\"Ex-Caliber%20Rifle\"&gt;Ex-Caliber Rifle&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n\"This powerful, semi-automatic rifle fires a ballistic blade at your enemies\u2026 that detonates mere moments later.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Shotgun\"&gt;Thunder Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n\"A pump-action shotgun that deals high damage and shoots two rounds at a time. Just as thunder tears through the sky, this shotgun tears through skirmishes and shotgun shells.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Maven%20Auto%20Shotgun\"&gt;Maven Auto Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n\"An automatic, fast-firing shotgun with moderate damage and range.

Additionally, v23.00 contains changes to the Battle Royale Island and related settings, new ways to customize the end-of-game messages for your Battle Royale Island, the hurdling player movement type, new weapons from Fortnite Battle Royale, and the Wave Defense island template, plus bug fixes for Prefabs and Galleries, devices, and more.\nDEVICE CONVERSION.\nThe new chapter introduces updated versions of many devices in the Creative toolset! Here are some examples of the improvements:\nThe updated devices are currently opt-in, and can be activated by going to My Island, clicking the Tools tab, and clicking the Convert button next to the updating devices option. Like the direct event binding system, these device updates will become mandatory in the future, so we are making the conversion process available early to let you try it out and help us find any remaining issues that need to be resolved ahead of time.\nBefore opting-in to the updated devices, you should first create a backup of your island, then convert devices on that backup island. You should thoroughly test the backup island once the devices are converted to make sure everything is working the way you want it to. Once you have completed that testing, then you can safely convert the original island.\nNote: The list of updated devices is long! The Creative documentation team is hard at work updating the device documents for both direct event binding and the new versions of Creative devices. However, both of these are big jobs and it will take some time to completely update all of the documentation.\nNEW WEAPONS AND PLAYER MOVEMENT FROM BATTLE ROYALE.\nFrom the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//fortnite.com/news/welcome-to-fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-4-season-1\"&gt;new Chapter of Fortnite Battle Royale&lt;/a&gt;, there are a number of improvements and changes that have been integrated into Creative. This ranges from the addition of hurdling (a new player movement ability), to visual improvements (such as visual effects for fire, certain kinds of chests, damage numbers, and loot drops), to new weapons. See below for more info!\nNEW WEAPONS\n&lt;br&gt;\nHere are the new weapons arriving in Creative from Battle Royale Chapter 4 Season 1:\nNEW PLAYER MOVEMENT: HURDLING\n&lt;br&gt;\nPlayers now automatically hurdle over or onto obstacles when sprinting into them in islands that allow this new player movement. You can turn hurdling on or off using the Allow Hurdling option in the Settings tab of My Island, and with the Class Designer or Team Settings &amp; Inventory devices. Existing islands have Allow Hurdling set to Off by default.\nBATTLE ROYALE ISLAND UPDATES.\nNEW EDITING AREA\n&lt;br&gt;\nWelcome to a whole new world! The Battle Royale Island is now the island from Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 4 Season 1. We've rearranged the edit area and changed its location for this new Battle Royale Island. Your old Battle Royale Islands should still work, but you might notice that a few things have moved around. As the Island changes from Season to Season in Fortnite Battle Royale, the edit area in your Battle Royale Islands will move around \u2014 but your Islands should work just the same as they did before.\nREMOVED ISLAND OPTIONS FOR BATTLE ROYALE ISLANDS\n&lt;br&gt;\nThere are a lot of visual upgrades in the new Battle Royale Chapter, and some of them would cause problems with some Battle Royale Island options. As a result, we've temporarily turned off the following options while we work on getting them to function properly with the updated Battle Royale Island in Creative:\nIf you find that your Battle Royale Island is having problems with one of the listed options, go to the island and open the My Island settings, and your Island should be reset with the problem options turned off. We're working hard to get this fixed, but in the meantime, we look forward to seeing the Battle Royale experiences you create in the new Island!\nBATTLE ROYALE ISLAND END GAME UPDATE\n&lt;br&gt;\nCreators can now select from three options for the end game screen in their Battle Royale Islands: Classic (Creative end-game screen), Battle Royale (Battle Royale end-game screen), and Custom, which gives you two animations to choose from and allows for customized text, sub-text, and colors for the Victory and Defeat conditions.\nOTHER UPDATES.\nISLAND TEMPLATE UPDATES\n&lt;br&gt;\nLearn how to use the Conditional Button and Team Settings and Inventory devices to create a game where players build up defenses to protect their tower from waves of creatures.\nBUG FIXES.\nPREFAB &amp; GALLERY FIXES\n&lt;br&gt;\nDEVICE FIXES\n&lt;br&gt;\nISLAND FIXES\n&lt;br&gt;\nGAMEPLAY FIXES\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe cold air and winter breeze have just started as we make our way into our second week of Save the World's Winterfest!

You can see a quick summary of how many events and functions are connected for each device\u2014all from one place.\nThe All Devices tab returns from the Channel Browser, but we\u2019ve added a Search bar so you can more easily find the devices you need and teleport to them.\nThis is just the initial version of the Event Browser, and we will continue to improve it and add even more valuable features. As an example, you\u2019ll notice that you can currently only teleport to devices on the left side of the panel, but in the future, you will be able to teleport to devices on the right side as well.\nOTHER UPDATES.\nCORE GAMEPLAY UPDATES&lt;br&gt;\nSmaller Player Collision Capsule: As part of improvements to core systems across Fortnite, we\u2019ve been able to reduce the size of the capsule used for collision with the player.

The Battle Royale v23.20 update introduces the Falcon Scout to help you find loot from afar, plus a Reality Augment that\u2019ll lead to buried treasure. This update brings five new Reality Augments total!\nTHE FALCON SCOUT: REMOTELY-CONTROLLED \u201cCAW\u201d MACHINE.\nA majestic creature to help you achieve a most noble victory, the &lt;a href=\"Falcon%20Scout\"&gt;Falcon Scout&lt;/a&gt; item is at your service! Deploy your Falcon Scout and control where it flies, ping or place markers, and caw to create a radius in which all opponents will be marked for your squad. You can also use your Falcon Scout to open containers and pick up loot. Carry the loot to yourself or a teammate and then scout for more!\nTo help you easily control your Falcon Scout, your view will shift to behind it. This may leave you defenseless if you\u2019re not fighting in a team, so be sure to find a hiding spot if you\u2019re battling solo. Also, be careful where you\u2019re flying, as the Falcon Scout is vulnerable to enemy attack. (See its remaining Health in its Health bar.) Because the Falcon Scout is controlled remotely, there\u2019s a max distance it can fly from you, trackable in its distance bar.\nFalcon Scouts are findable from the ground, regular Chests, Oathbound Chests, and Supply Drops. There\u2019s no limit as to how many times you can use the same Falcon Scout in a match.\nNEW REALITY AUGMENTS!\nFive more Reality Augments enter the fray in v23.20!

No longer leave &lt;a href=\"Helsie\"&gt;Helsie&lt;/a&gt; hanging or dishonor &lt;a href=\"Raptorian%20The%20Brave\"&gt;Raptorian the Brave&lt;/a&gt;.\nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT: DYNAMIC 3D RESOLUTION ON PC.\nIn the v23.10 update, we added the Dynamic 3D Resolution setting to Fortnite on PC, accessible in the \u201cGraphics Quality\u201d section of the Video settings when your rendering mode is set to DirectX 12. Players on PC are able to turn on Dynamic 3D Resolution when their \u201cAnti-Aliasing &amp; Super Resolution\u201d setting is set to one of the Temporal Super Resolution (TSR) options. Also, players need to have run \u201cAuto-Set Quality\u201d at least once.\nDynamic 3D Resolution allows the resolution of the game to scale with performance, giving both smoother AND higher frame rates as the GPU load changes. (Please note this means an increase in PC memory usage to accommodate larger rendering resolution.) Dynamic 3D Resolution is also available in creator-made islands and Save the World.\nMAJOR BUG FIXES.\nThe Fortnite v23.20 update brings the &lt;a href=\"Shockwave%20Hammer\"&gt;Shockwave Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falcon%20Scout\"&gt;Falcon Scout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Shield\"&gt;Guardian Shield&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rebooting\"&gt;Reboot Van&lt;/a&gt; from Fortnite Battle Royale! v23.20 also brings an upgraded &lt;a href=\"Ball%20Spawner\"&gt;Ball Spawner&lt;/a&gt; device, new visual variants for the &lt;a href=\"Wildlife%20Spawner\"&gt;Wildlife Spawner&lt;/a&gt;, custom post-game options expanded to all islands, plus updates and bug fixes for devices, islands, and tools.\nSHOCKWAVE HAMMER.\nThe Shockwave Hammer is a melee weapon that not only does damage, but can also launch the player, a player's squad, or their opponents away from the point of impact.\nAfter charging up the Slam attack, players can launch others by releasing the primary fire control while they are jumping in the air. They can launch themselves and others by holding primary fire control when the hammer impacts the ground. It's like the Shockwave Grenade, but on a giant hammer!\nYou can place Oathbound Chests on your islands to give players a random chance to find a Shockwave Hammer.\nFALCON SCOUT.\nThe Falcon Scout is a mechanical flying companion that players can use to mark opponents, open containers, and carry loot to themselves or their teammates. There's a price to pay for this powerful tool: while guiding the Falcon Scout, the player is vulnerable! It's up to players to determine whether using it is worth the risk.\nYou can place Oathbound Chests on your islands to give players a random chance to find the Falcon Scout.\nGUARDIAN SHIELD.\nFor players, a little cover goes a long way. The Guardian Shield deploys a protective barrier in front of the player that blocks incoming damage. This shield can provide players with mobile cover while they are on the move. It can also be thrown on the ground to create a stationary point of protection. The shield is temporary, and changes color to indicate how much time players have before it runs out.\nYou can place Oathbound Chests on your islands to give players a random chance to find a Guardian Shield.\nREBOOT VAN SPAWNER.\nPlace the Reboot Van Spawner on your islands to give your players the ability to revive eliminated team members. You can customize which teams or classes can use the Reboot Van, as well as trigger events when the Reboot Van is recharged or when a set of players has been rebooted.\nReboot Cards drop from eliminated players, but only if the eliminated player has teammates who could pick up the card when it is dropped. There also must be a Reboot Van that the eliminated player's team or class can use. There is also a new option on the Settings tab of My Island, called Drop Reboot Card on Elimination that is set to If Can Be Rebooted by default. If you set the option to No, Reboot Cards don't drop for any eliminated players.\nNEW BALL SPAWNER.\nWe've been working to create a new upgraded &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/using-ball-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative\"&gt;Ball Spawner&lt;/a&gt; that uses our modern physics system, and we\u2019re excited to have it released in v23.20! Along with improved physics behavior, we've added other options and adjustments as well. For example, you can adjust the size of the ball directly, you can customize the maximum distance range, and you can set the ball to trigger events when players touch it.\nWith the release of the new Ball Spawner, the previous Ball Spawner device is now known as &lt;a href=\"Ball%20Spawner%20%28Legacy%29\"&gt;Ball Spawner (Legacy)&lt;/a&gt;. In the future, the legacy Ball Spawner device will be removed.\nNote: Information on the new Ball Spawner has been added to the device document for the legacy version of the device. However, you can find a link to the new sections in a note at the top of the page.\nNEW VARIANT MODELS FOR WILDLIFE.\nNew visual variants have been added to some of the animals spawned by the &lt;a href=\"Wildlife%20Spawner\"&gt;Wildlife Spawner&lt;/a&gt;. If you set the Type option to Chicken, Boar, or Wolf, you'll see the Biome Variant option displayed. By default, these animals have the Classic variant appearance, but you can also select Medieval or Snow.\nCUSTOM POST-GAME SETTINGS FOR ALL ISLANDS.\nCustom post-game settings are now available for all creator-made islands! Previously, this was only available when creating a Battle Royale Island in Creative.

Also increases the effectiveness of eating forageables.\"\nMYTHIC MUNITION\n\"Obtain a Mythic Pistol.\" \nHeads-up! New Reality Augments are discovered by selecting Reality Augments in matches. Rerolling does not discover new Reality Augments.\nWEEKLY QUESTS UPDATE.\nFrom v23.30 and onwards, Battle Royale Chapter 4 Season 1 Weekly Quests will no longer expire after a week. They will remain until the end of Season, meaning players can complete a set of Weekly Quests anytime until Chapter 4 Season 1's end date.\nMAJOR BATTLE ROYALE BUG FIXES.\nThe Fortnite v23.30 update introduces Over-Budget Editing, the Crowd Volume device, the Hiding Props Gallery, and the Big Bush Bomb from Battle Royale.\nv23.30 also contains new command options for hired guards in the Guard Spawner, the addition of Sky Jellies to the Wildlife Spawner, and the new Cyber City Prefabs and Galleries, Video Player Screen Gallery, Reactive Trim Gallery, and Background Equalizer Buildings and Background Equalizer Skyscraper Galleries.\nOVER-BUDGET EDITING.\nMemory management is a big concern to creators, so we want to make it easier. The total memory limit for published islands is still 100K \u2013 but when you are in Create mode on your islands, you can now place and move props normally up to 115K total memory. This will make it easier for you to manage memory fluctuations, and prevent situations where you are unable to place or move objects on your island because you have exceeded the 100K memory limit.\nKeep in mind that the new 115K memory limit is only for when you are in Create mode, and is a hard limit. If you exceed 115K memory, you will be blocked from placing and moving objects again. The additional memory is meant to give you freedom to adjust your island so the memory used is within the 100K limit before you publish your island.\nCROWD VOLUME.\nThe Crowd Volume is a device that spawns a group of cheering NPCs. Populate the stands for races, concerts, or any other experience where you need an audience. You can determine the density of the crowd, the size of the volume, and how randomly the NPCs are distributed in the space.\nHIDING PROPS GALLERY.\nThe Hiding Props Gallery gives you three different props that players can hide in: a Dumpster, a Haystack, and a Portapotty. You can use these to create a new kind of Hide-and-Seek game that is different from a Prop Hunt. Because you can customize which teams and classes can use a particular hiding prop, you can create new game modes focused around those elements. \nYou can also customize the props so that more than one player can hide in one, and determine whether the prop has sound effects and a wobbling animation when it is occupied. You can even set time limits on how long a player can hide before being ejected from the hiding place, or have other devices signal the hiding prop to eject players based on events or triggers.\nGUARD SPAWNER: COMMAND OPTIONS FOR HIRED GUARDS.\nIf you enable the Can Be Hired option in the Guard Spawner device, there is a new Can Be Given Commands option. When this is set to Yes, it gives your players the ability to control their hired guards by giving them different commands. The following commands are displayed on a new UI element, the Command Wheel:\nAll spawned guards that have commands enabled can be controlled by the player, and players can command up to three hired guards at the same time.\nSKY JELLIES.\n&lt;a href=\"Sky%20Jelly\"&gt;Sky Jellies&lt;/a&gt; are now available in the Type option of the Wildlife Spawner device. Sky Jellies are helpful creatures that exist in the world with the single goal of healing any living thing that comes near them. If wildlife or players approach a Sky Jelly, it will slowly float toward them and give off a healing splash if the target has less than full health. Players can interact with the Sky Jelly to trigger the healing splash more quickly.\nWhen players jump on top of the Sky Jelly, it bounces the player upward and makes them immune to fall damage for a short time. Players can shoot Sky Jellies to detonate them, but if a Sky Jelly is shot, it explodes with a shockwave instead of a healing splash. This shockwave will also detonate other Sky Jellies that are nearby.\nBIG BUSH BOMB.\nUse the Big Bush Bomb in your island, so player can throw a large bush out into the environment to hide in or to confuse their opponents.\nOTHER UPDATES.\nPREFAB &amp; GALLERY UPDATES\n&lt;br&gt;\nDEVICE UPDATES\n&lt;br&gt;\nUPDATES TO UPGRADED DEVICES\n&lt;br&gt;\n==BUG FIXES\nPREFAB &amp; GALLERY FIXES\nDEVICE FIXES\nFIXES FOR UPGRADED DEVICES\nISLAND FIXES,/span&gt;\nGAMEPLAY FIXES\nThe v23.30 update in Save the World brings the second and third week of Wargames, an update to when several questlines change, and a reloading change.

They can be earned via the Arcade Cabinet quests. If you've already completed these quests but don't have the heroes, you'll receive them in a gift box in-game. They can also be recruited from the Collection Book.\nNew Reloading Gameplay Changes.\nMost ranged weapons in Save the World can now be reloaded while you\u2019re aiming down sights, making it easier to keep a bead on your target as you\u2019re reloading. Weapons with a zoom scope are the exception - those will retain the old behavior and pull out to the regular third-person view while reloading.\nEvent and Weekly Store.\n&lt;a href=\"Snuggle%20Specialist%20Sarah\"&gt;Snuggle Specialist Sarah&lt;/a&gt; - February 2 at 7pm ET\n\"\u201cDoes somebody need a hug?\u201d - Snuggle Specialist Sarah\"\n&lt;a href=\"Love%20Ranger%20Jonesy\"&gt;Love Ranger Jonesy&lt;/a&gt; - February 9 at 7pm ET\n\"\u201cI have a heart of stone\u2026 literally.\u201d - Love Ranger Jonesy\"\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Heartbreaker%20Crossbow\"&gt;The Heartbreaker Crossbow&lt;/a&gt; - February 9 at 7pm ET\n&lt;br&gt;\nThis piercing bow is skilled at breaking two things: hearts and Husks.\nBug Fixes.\nA number of important bug fixes were included in the v23.30 game update, including:\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Any hiding prop can be assigned to a group using the Hidden Travel Group option. You can set other hiding props to send players to another group of hiding props using the Hidden Travel Target Group option. If you've enabled the Hidden Travel option on a prop, a player who hides inside it will travel to the target hiding prop and jump out. If you have the prop set to random selection, you can also set it to avoid repeats whenever possible. Keep in mind that when a hiding prop is enabled, it will be invulnerable if it is set up for hidden travel.

It was added in .\nFunctionality.\nThe Trail Thrasher is a fast moving dirt bike that can seat 2 players (driver and rear passenger). The motorbike can lift itself in the air, which is commanded by the driver with the jump button. The longer the jump is charged, the higher the vehicle will go. Furthermore, as the bike jumps, it can be spun around its axis in the air. Jumping correctly while moving will greatly increase horizontal speed. The charge of the jump is displayed through a green bar next to the fuel meter. \nThe Trail Thrasher can travel on uneven terrain at the same speed it travels on asphalt. It is equipped with a pair of tires that are different than the ones of &lt;a href=\"cars\"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt;, but can be analoguely be destroyed by dealing damage to them. The tires have their own health bar, so hitting them won't affect the overall integrity of the Trail Thrasher. However, bursting a tire will cause the vehicle to be extremely difficult to control while steering and will force it to take damage as it moves. The effects are doubled if both tires get neutralised. Tires can only be replaced by restoring the vehicle to max armor with a &lt;a href=\"Repair%20Torch\"&gt;Repair Torch&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Modification\"&gt;vehicle mods&lt;/a&gt; can't be applied to the Trail Thrasher.\nUniquely, the driver of the Trail Thrasher can also shoot their own &lt;a href=\"Weaponry\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and use items, all whilst maintaining the momentum they have gathered. Simply using the aim, switch or shoot commands will trigger the pullout of the item; in this state, the driver can still turn even if their hands are not actually controlling the handlebar, though they cannot initiate a jump on the contrary. Not firing anything for a few seconds will automatically re-enter the full drive mode. The same applies to the passenger, who will be in a fixed position unless employing items. However the passenger can also &lt;a href=\"Building\"&gt;build&lt;/a&gt;, while the driver cannot. Additionally, the driver has the ability to wheelie the Trail Thrasher and both crew members can perform tricks while in the air, collecting trick score (purely visual).\nThe Trail Thrasher has limited fuel and 550 HP. When drained, the vehicle will enter a vehicle death state and then explode, damaging everything in its surroundings, starting a &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; and leaving a wreckage prop behind.\nObtained.\nThe Trail Thrasher can be found in set locations around the map.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nOther.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

It normally travels at a higher speed than a player that is sprinting, but will slow down at train stations. Allowing players to catch up to it by running and climb aboard. \nThe Train can be used as both a quick ride and a source of loot. There are 2 small &lt;a href=\"Chest\"&gt;Chest&lt;/a&gt;s on the inside of each interior door frame, making four chests total. There is also a &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Cache\"&gt;Train Heist Chest&lt;/a&gt; near the front of the Train that can be hacked. This begins a countdown that any player within 25 meters (roughly the length of the Train itself) can see. When the countdown finishes, &lt;a href=\"Rarity\"&gt;Rare&lt;/a&gt; loot will spawn from the cache, usually containing various &lt;a href=\"Consumables\"&gt;Consumables&lt;/a&gt; among some &lt;a href=\"Weaponry%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;. \nChapter 5.\nFor Chapter 5\u2019s train, &lt;a href=\"The%20Underground\"&gt;Underground&lt;/a&gt; graffiti will appear on the inside of the Train while the Heist Chest is inaccessible. Every two train stations the Train passes triggers the Train Heist Chest to refresh, clearing the graffiti and allowing the Heist Chest to be hacked again. This makes the Heist Chest a renewable source of rare loot that may be accessed any number of times during a match. The train takes inspiration from a more traditional passenger train, and each open car can be accessed through an open frame between the two. The Train took 9 minutes to make a complete cycle in Chapter 5. \nOn the map, the Train is marked with an icon , with an accompanying arrow to indicate the direction it is moving.\nChapter 6.\nFor Chapter 6\u2019s train, the Train &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Cache\"&gt;Combat Cache&lt;/a&gt; can be accessed any number of times during a match, and a glow will appear around the chest while it is available to access. It is guaranteed to drop the &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Holo%20Twister%20Assault%20Rifle\"&gt;Enhanced Holo Twister Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt; each time it is opened. There are 2 small &lt;a href=\"Chest\"&gt;Chest&lt;/a&gt;s on the inside of each interior door frame, making four chests total. The train takes on a sleek look, and the open cars cannot be accessed through a door, forcing players to have to mantle between. The Train took X minutes to make a complete cycle in Chapter 6.\nOn the map, the Train is marked with an icon , with an accompanying arrow to indicate the direction it is moving.

Traps are normally placed by the player, and take up a special infinite inventory slot, but some are items instead.\nAs a general rule, a player who comes within the same tile as a placed trap will activate it, causing the effects of the trap to apply.

They damage and stun, displace\u00a0and heal, and they operate automatically without the need for player management. Traps cannot harm &lt;a href=\"Heroes\"&gt;Heroes&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlacing.\nPlayers must place a trap on a solid, unmodified structure tile---that is, a tile without spaces cut for doors, holes, or archways. An exception is the \"Wall (Fence)\" type which can be placed on any wall tile with a solid bottom row. The game will signal players whether a placement location is valid using colored icons and providing an explanation if not valid. Placing traps is made to be simple and intuitive, and experimenting in the game world is an effective way to learn the system.\nPlayers may place traps by attaching them to structures. Traps are divided by \"Lethal\", \"Crowd Control\" and \"Utility\" roles and are sub-divided into three placement types - wall traps, ceiling traps, and\u00a0floor traps. Each trap may only fasten to its matching structure type (i.e. it is not possible to place a ceiling trap on a wall.)\nAcquisition.\nLike &lt;a href=\"Weaponry%20%28Save%20the%20World%29\"&gt;Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, Traps are a storable commodity carried in the player's backpack.\u00a0They\u00a0may be found in the game world as loot or crafted by the player with the use of &lt;a href=\"Schematics\"&gt;Schematics&lt;/a&gt;. Trap items are consumable and disappear from the player's inventory after a single use i.e when being placed. Players replenish or stockpile their trap inventory by looting or crafting.\nLeveling.\nTrap schematics can be leveled up to increase their base stats and have their perks modified to increase the general strength of the crafted traps they yield, just like weapons.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\nList.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n Ceiling Traps \n Wall Traps \n Floor Traps \n&lt;/tabber&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nHistory.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Content%20Update%20v19.01%20-%202\"&gt;Content Update v19.01 #2&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

A total of 5 screenings of the Live Event took place, each with different times, allowing less lag and trouble getting into servers, as well as allowing more people from around the globe to view it. It was a recreation of all of the major &lt;a href=\"Live%20Events\"&gt;Live Events&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Season%203\"&gt;Season 3&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Season%20X\"&gt;Season X&lt;/a&gt; in Chapter 1.\n&lt;br&gt;\nTwo days before, the &lt;a href=\"Travis%20Scott%27s%20Astronomical%20Challenges\"&gt;Travis Scott's Astronomical Challenges&lt;/a&gt; were released allowing players to unlock free rewards.

The playlists opened 30 minutes prior to the Live Event. The Live Event was a concert hosted by &lt;a href=\"Travis%20Scott\"&gt;Travis Scott&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhat Happened?\nAt the beginning of the Live Event, &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt; disappeared, and the stage started to light up. Astroworld started to fly towards the ground as reference to the Meteor &lt;a href=\"Live%20Events\"&gt;Live Event&lt;/a&gt;, eventually appearing behind the stage as the ending to his song Highest in the Room plays.\nThe first beat of SICKO MODE then started playing as the purple meteor surrounding Astroworld crashed onto the right side of the stage, blowing players away from it, as a giant &lt;a href=\"Travis%20Scott\"&gt;Travis Scott&lt;/a&gt; rose from the stage's debris.\nTravis started teleporting all around &lt;a href=\"Sweaty%20Sands\"&gt;Sweaty Sands&lt;/a&gt; as he continued singing Sicko Mode. As the Players got teleported into the middle of an equalizer, sliding it down, and bouncing upon dropping onto the floor of Sweaty Sands. The players received a low gravity effect (similar to the one at &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube\"&gt;The Cube&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s anti-gravity fields or to the one produced when a &lt;a href=\"Hop%20Rocks\"&gt;Hop Rock&lt;/a&gt; is consumed) as Travis goes around the &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt; with holograms of a modified &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Voyager\"&gt;Corrupted Voyager&lt;/a&gt; in a circle, he then grabs two star dust from the sky and crashes them together, causing an explosion.\nThe whole sky turned red as the whole Island went on fire, and an amusement park formed in the background with a Ferris wheel and a rollercoaster on fire whilst Travis was glitching. Travis then gets struck by lightning, damaging him, thus turning him into his T-3500 edit style. Players got their walking speed a lot faster (similar to the one gained after consuming a &lt;a href=\"Pepper\"&gt;Pepper&lt;/a&gt;) as he started singing Stargazing, only for him to start to glitch again and then he disappeared only for a moment.\nTravis jumped down from nowhere and started singing Goosebumps, as a rollercoaster started coming out of Astroworld, touching the water of Sweaty Sands, and the whole Island turned pitch black with neon colors illuminating it. Eventually everything turned back to normal, as Travis fell down backwards and the whole Island became flooded in water whilst meteors were falling down from the sky, this particular section has a Diving mechanic.\nUnderwater, with the first half of Highest in the Room playing, Astro Jack came down from above, sinking, while &lt;a href=\"Skull%20Trooper\"&gt;Skull Trooper&lt;/a&gt;s swam around the bottom of the \"ocean\", as reference to &lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer\"&gt;The Devourer&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"The%20Final%20Showdown\"&gt;The Final Showdown&lt;/a&gt; event. Then the third part of Sicko Mode then started playing and players were stuck on a grid floor sliding left and right whilst the Astro Jack kept dancing, with &lt;a href=\"Llion\"&gt;Llion&lt;/a&gt; making a cameo appearance in the background, only for Astro Jack to flip the Island.\nThe players flew out of the Island and into the sky as The Scott\u2019s begins playing. At this point, you were able to see the Islands of both Chapters, &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;. Astro Jack sits on Mars while constantly rapping to the beat, while a few shooting stars passed by. Astroworld reappears, and the purple meteor surrounding it from the beginning of the event then hits the surface, and Astro Jack starts striding around it.\nThe speaker shaped core of Astroworld begins to turn purple and explode, and the players are then transported to a place similar to &lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28Chapter%201%29\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt; event where the Zero Point contained everything, as a &lt;a href=\"Rift\"&gt;Rift&lt;/a&gt;, similar to the Butterfly from the &lt;a href=\"Butterfly%20Event\"&gt;Butterfly Event&lt;/a&gt; appeared. When the players touched it, they were sent back to &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;. This was the end of the Live Event. "}

When picking up the BluGlo, the Troll will jump from underground to take the BluGlo away. This starts Whack-a-Troll.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Dungeons\"&gt;Dungeons&lt;/a&gt;, Whack-a-Troll is started when a player activates a Snare Dungeon Trap, where the player is unable to move.\nWhack-a-Troll.\nWhack-a-Troll is a minigame in which the player must eliminate the Troll to obtain the BluGlo. In this minigame, the Troll will create two or three holes and the Troll will appear in one of the holes. Sometimes the Troll does not appear from the holes, instead a bomb or a fake copy will appear instead in order to trick the player. Hitting the bomb will damage the player. A melee weapon is recommended to damage the Troll, as you can hit it twice with a melee weapon before it goes back into it's hole, letting you eliminate the troll faster.\nOnce the Troll is eliminated, the player is awarded 2 BluGlo and Materials. In Dungeons, eliminating the Troll frees the player from the Snare Dungeon Trap."}

They were introduced in .\nDescription and Behavior.\nSprites are a type of gameplay mechanic which will roam around certain areas of the map, Some Sprites are &lt;a href=\"AIs\"&gt;AIs&lt;/a&gt; and can potentially flee from the player when they get close. Sprites have a wide range of uses, from mobility, to unlocking loot to aid in battle.\nWater and Air Sprites.\nWater and Air Sprites will flee from the player and can be picked up and carried, which enables the player to access shrines. When a carried Sprite is not the currently held item, it will take the place of the player's &lt;a href=\"Back%20Blings\"&gt;Back Bling&lt;/a&gt;. Carried sprites can be given to &lt;a href=\"Bushranger%23Character\"&gt;Bushranger&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nightshift%20Forest\"&gt;Nightshift Forest&lt;/a&gt; to shift the time to day and grant the player a vault key. Depositing a Sprite into a Sprite Shrine will free the Sprite and grant the player loot including a &lt;a href=\"Boons\"&gt;Boon&lt;/a&gt; corresponding to the element of the Sprite. When picked up, both Water and Air Sprites are of rarity. When dropped, Sprites will go back to being &lt;a href=\"Wildlife\"&gt;Wildlife&lt;/a&gt;. Only one Air or Water Sprite may be carried by the player at a time.\nEarth Sprites.\nEarth Sprites can be found in various locations, unlike other sprites they will not flee from the player and cannot be picked up or carried, meaning they cannot be used to access shrines or given to &lt;a href=\"Bushranger%23Character\"&gt;Bushranger&lt;/a&gt;. When a weapon is dropped near an Earth Sprite, it will eat the weapon, giving back a random weapon.\nGallery.\nSprites are spirits roaming around &lt;a href=\"Oninoshima\"&gt;Oninoshima&lt;/a&gt; following the return of Magic on the Island. Before the Shattering War, Sprites were worshiped to the now forgotten Sprite Shrines.\nPersonality.\nSprites are described as innocent, endearing, helpful creatures. Water and Air Sprites can sometimes be fearful of strangers depending on the situation, while Earth Sprites remain much calmer. Moreover while the first two are unable to speak, the latter are able to do so and are endowed with a great intelligence.\nAppearance.\nAir Sprites: Soft, glowing, cloud-like creatures with a creamy white body. It has a swirl design on its chest denoting its element and expressive, large black eyes with sparkling highlights. Its rounded, marshmallow-like shape gives it a gentle and cute demeanor.\nWater Sprites: Bubbly, water-inspired creatures with a translucent, gradient body transitioning from blue to teal. It features tiny bubbles rising from its head. Like the Air Sprite, it has adorable black eyes, a circular mark on its torso denoting its element, and a playful, cheerful appearance.\nEarth Sprites: Robust, nature-themed entities resembling a humanoid tree trunk laid and surrounded by mossy rocks. It has glowing pink eyes, moss growing on its shoulders, and leafy branches sprouting from its head. \nTrivia.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The left icon indicates a Support hero and the right icon indicates a Tactical hero. Slotting them in the correct slot is important because tactical bonuses don't activate if the hero is slotted in the support slot and vice versa. While most heroes only have a support or tactical bonus, some heroes have multiple bonuses available ie: Urban Assault &lt;a href=\"Soldier\"&gt;Soldier&lt;/a&gt; has Improved Headshots as a support bonus and Lucky Stars as a Tactical bonus. Matching the correct bonuses for your Primary hero slot is important in achieving victory and is another key feature that helps customize gameplay. Note that tactical bonuses require the slotted hero to at least be two-stars for it to activate.\nHero Star Level.\nIn addition to the raw stat bonuses that the squad bonus slots provide, the tier level of the slotted hero also improves the bonuses. How much this bonus increases per additional star varies between each perk with some having no difference between tiers.\nList of Bonuses.\nNote that the following effects are for the baseline hero and does not include most of the upgraded effects. Different heroes may share the same bonus effect but heroes with the same subclass will share the same bonus effect ie: Assassin Sarah and the Limited Edition Assassin Ken both provide the Endurance Training bonus. Generally speaking, bonuses support their shared class specialty more than anything else ie: &lt;a href=\"Outlander\"&gt;Outlander&lt;/a&gt; bonuses tend to be helpful for harvesting or treasure finding while &lt;a href=\"Ninja\"&gt;Ninja&lt;/a&gt; bonuses tend to be about melee combat, though there are exceptions to this rule ie: Commando Soldier's passive is for Outlanders."}

They had been living in the shadows until , where &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; got rifted into &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"The%20Device%20%28event%29\"&gt;The Device&lt;/a&gt; Event. They used the &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; to traverse and manipulate realities (often dramatically upsetting their evolution) to make a \"perfect\" civilization in &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt;'s vision, and created The Loop as a way to \"research\" and collect the best fighters to add them to their ranks, as well as collecting any information on anything and everything, creating and archive where nothing is ever deleted. According to &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, they threaten to upset the balance of &lt;a href=\"The%20Omniverse\"&gt;The Omniverse&lt;/a&gt;, but for them this price was acceptable as long as it allowed them to quench their thirst for knowledge and power.\nThey took their job very seriously and made recruits take an oath to dedicate their life to The Order and the penalty for treason was termination. They would also give Island Management Team members immortality and protection for their families as long as they stay on &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, the IO was built on \"mutual distrust and paranoia\" and the command was very secretive and neglective, and even longtime members like Jones wasn't aware of who &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt; even was as Geno had \"no time to waste on the likes of him\". Based on the info Jones took from the IO database, they seem to have at least 4862 sites and 5 \"levels\" of ranks (excluding the Inner Circle).\nLocations, Members and Technology.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nScrapped Members.\nThis section is about characters who were originally planned to release as members/associates of the IO, but were delayed or cancelled.\nKnown Departments.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nHistory.\nBefore Chapter 1.\n&lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt; discovers &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; and enslaves it in order to use it to access &lt;a href=\"The%20Omniverse\"&gt;all Realities&lt;/a&gt;. In an unknown Reality, Geno forms the &lt;a href=\"Oathbound\"&gt;Oathbound&lt;/a&gt; Empire and becomes their &lt;a href=\"The%20Ageless\"&gt;Champion&lt;/a&gt;, but later abandons them, leaving a Snapshot named &lt;a href=\"The%20Ageless\"&gt;The Ageless&lt;/a&gt; to rule them and later founded the Imagined Order in order to protect and perfect all realities, creating the ideal civilization in Geno's vision. In &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt;, the Imagined Order build &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Vault\"&gt;The Vault&lt;/a&gt; and other bases around the Zero Point at the epicenter of the &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt;. They start various experiments with the Zero Point, one being to send &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt; into the Zero Point to see what happens. Agent Jones discovers &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt; and his first &lt;a href=\"Snapshots\"&gt;Snapshot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jonesy%20The%20First\"&gt;Jonesy The First&lt;/a&gt;, is created. After they learn how to use the Zero Point as a portal to other dimensions, they travel to different realities and \"bring order to everything\", as they like to call it: changing and altering realities to their liking, kidnapping people and bringing them to &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;The Island&lt;/a&gt; and into &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt;, and other despicable actions. Their actions caused &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt; to form in retaliation.

Geno had two daughters, &lt;a href=\"The%20Imagined\"&gt;The Imagined&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Order\"&gt;The Order&lt;/a&gt; and genetically modified them to be perfect.

They weren't, making Geno replace them with their stronger &lt;a href=\"Snapshots\"&gt;Snapshots&lt;/a&gt;. The Sisters leave Geno behind, feeling betrayed by him, and join &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt;, one of the IO\u2019s main enemies. To keep their full control of the Island, they build the rooms in &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt; to control &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Full%20List%20Of%20Items\"&gt;Loot&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Containers\"&gt;Chests&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; island to distract the Loopers and keep them away from trying to escape the Loop. They capture &lt;a href=\"The%20Origin\"&gt;The Cube King&lt;/a&gt;, who left &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt; after finding out that the &lt;a href=\"Cubes\"&gt;Cubes&lt;/a&gt; are evil. They abuse him for his knowledge, but he eventually gets rescued by &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt; and goes by the name of The Origin and becomes their Battle Strategist. \n&lt;a href=\"Season%205\"&gt;Season 5&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;Sideways Rift&lt;/a&gt; starts to close, The IO send a group of &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcers&lt;/a&gt;, who aim to restore balance and order, arrive through &lt;a href=\"Rift\"&gt;Rifts&lt;/a&gt;. They return objects that previously vanished through interdimensional travel back to the island.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%207\"&gt;Season 7&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Biome\"&gt;Snow Biome&lt;/a&gt; reaches &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;, the IO takeover a small island made of ice and turn it into the &lt;a href=\"Snowy%20Bunker\"&gt;Snowy Bunker&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%209\"&gt;Season 9&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer\"&gt;The Devourer&lt;/a&gt; breaks out of &lt;a href=\"Polar%20Peak\"&gt;Polar Peak&lt;/a&gt;, the IO were happy to let it destroy everything in &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt;, although were worried that he would harm The Zero Point. &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt;, who was also captured at some point, instead volunteers to pilot a &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Mech&lt;/a&gt; to defeat the Devourer, but the IO threatens her that if she doesn't do it their way, they would ceate a &lt;a href=\"The%20Collider\"&gt;Doomsday Device&lt;/a&gt; to destroy The Loop. &lt;a href=\"Singularity\"&gt;Singularity&lt;/a&gt; and her troops start construction of the Mecha Team Leader at &lt;a href=\"Pressure%20Plant\"&gt;Pressure Plant&lt;/a&gt;. The Seven thinks that The Paradigm managed to escape by herself. &lt;a href=\"The%20Origin\"&gt;The Origin&lt;/a&gt;, not believing she could escape by herself, (as \"he\" needed to be rescued) thinks she got inside help to escape. She would later be called a traitor for helping the IO.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Final%20Showdown\"&gt;The Final Showdown&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer\"&gt;The Devourer&lt;/a&gt; rises from the ocean and start heading towards &lt;a href=\"The%20Vault\"&gt;The Vault&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Mecha Team Leader&lt;/a&gt; leaves &lt;a href=\"Pressure%20Plant\"&gt;Pressure Plant&lt;/a&gt; and attacks the Devourer, getting the two in a fight. The Devourer rips out Mecha's arm and heavily damages it, but Mecha damages The Vault and pulls &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; out. It goes for Singularity's statue and pulls it out, revealing a giant sword. Devourer attacks back but the Mecha strike the sword in his head, killing The Devourer with &lt;a href=\"No%20Sweat\"&gt;no sweat&lt;/a&gt;. It flies off into &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the Island for a long while.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%20X\"&gt;Season X&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; breaks out of &lt;a href=\"The%20Vault\"&gt;The Vault&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"The%20Final%20Showdown\"&gt;The Final Showdown&lt;/a&gt;. The IO manipulates &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt; into restabilizing the Zero Point without destroying &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt; on the way. The Seven launch seven Rockets that create a &lt;a href=\"Rift\"&gt;Rift&lt;/a&gt; in front of The &lt;a href=\"Meteor\"&gt;Meteor&lt;/a&gt;, making it crash into &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, creating a &lt;a href=\"The%20Blackout\"&gt;Black Hole&lt;/a&gt; that reorganized the Island of &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;.\nIO's best [redacted: D4] Team, which consist of 4 &lt;a href=\"GHOST\"&gt;E.G.O.&lt;/a&gt; agents, gets sent into &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt; through a &lt;a href=\"Crash%20Site\"&gt;Plane&lt;/a&gt; to explore the new form &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;The Island&lt;/a&gt; has taken. The team joins forces with &lt;a href=\"Remedy%20vs%20Toxin\"&gt;Remedy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cameo%20vs%20Chic\"&gt;Cameo&lt;/a&gt; and fight against &lt;a href=\"SHADOW\"&gt;A.L.T.E.R.&lt;/a&gt; agents led by &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Agent\"&gt;Chaos Agent&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the start of the season, a group of &lt;a href=\"Sledge\"&gt;Sledges&lt;/a&gt; chase &lt;a href=\"Lynx\"&gt;Lynx&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Crash%20Site\"&gt;Crash Site&lt;/a&gt; when she is called by &lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt;. During &lt;a href=\"The%20Device%20%28event%29\"&gt;The Device&lt;/a&gt; Event, the IO try to put everything back to normal as &lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt; pushes back &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt; and starts slowly destroying &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt; as we know it. Midas ends up teleporting &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt;' Office in &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt; where The Looper makes their first contact with the IO, but are sent back after Jones asks, bewildered, if The Looper could hear him.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt; is on alarm after &lt;a href=\"Galactus\"&gt;Galactus&lt;/a&gt; pulls out &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, causing chaos on both The Bridge and the island. &lt;a href=\"IO%20Guards\"&gt;IO Guards&lt;/a&gt; run away aimlessly while Jones wakes up in his office, with &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; calling him.\n&lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt; picks up his phone and is ordered by &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; to prevent The Loopers from escaping &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt;, then formulates the \"Project Hunter\" plan. &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; uses &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Portal%20Device\"&gt;Portal Device&lt;/a&gt; to bring the best &lt;a href=\"Hunters\"&gt;Hunters&lt;/a&gt; across &lt;a href=\"The%20Omniverse\"&gt;all Realities&lt;/a&gt; in order to cause chaos and keep Loopers away from &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;. He brings all the hunters, but ends up damaging The Zero Point more as he creates &lt;a href=\"Pure%20Portals\"&gt;Portals&lt;/a&gt; that push The Zero Point's capabilities and energy up to its limits. &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; realizes that the IO is doing nothing about The Zero Point destabilizing, so he tries to fix it himself but, in order to do that, he needs access to 'Restricted File 8752', a file about &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt;. He tries to acess the file, but learns that his credentials have been revoked. He goes rogue and makes a plan, involving using his &lt;a href=\"Portal%20Device\"&gt;Portal Device&lt;/a&gt; to bring a &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;member of The Seven&lt;/a&gt; onto &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;, breaking his oath with the Order.\n&lt;a href=\"Zero%20Crisis%20Finale\"&gt;Zero Crisis Finale&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; uses his Rift Gun on the Zero Point to summon to the Island, &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt;'s leader, for help to fix &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;. The Foundation doesn't trust Jones at first, since the IO manipulated them back in &lt;a href=\"Season%20X\"&gt;Season X&lt;/a&gt;, leading to &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction. After The Foundation has a fight with Jones, Jones tells him that he can get him to &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Imagined Order that controls The Zero Point, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Sisters\"&gt;The Sisters&lt;/a&gt;, two members of &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown whether this conversation is about The Seven\u2019s Sisters, or their snapshot Imagined Order counterparts, but likely the latter. They seal their deal and succeed at fixing The Zero Point, with The Foundation sealing himself in The Zero Point and creating &lt;a href=\"The%20Spire\"&gt;The Spire&lt;/a&gt; to allow it to restore itself.\n \n&lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; and other IO members fled &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, leaving it mostly abandoned. The &lt;a href=\"Spire%20Cult\"&gt;Spire Cult&lt;/a&gt; later appeared and developed a cult following around The Spire and took the elements of the IO that they found, appropriating their logo. They also took on the role of guardians, tasked to protect &lt;a href=\"The%20Spire\"&gt;The Spire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Towers\"&gt;Guardian Towers&lt;/a&gt;, however they failed in their duty when &lt;a href=\"Raz\"&gt;Raz&lt;/a&gt; got corrupted, becoming &lt;a href=\"Raz\"&gt;Glyph Master Raz&lt;/a&gt; and taking over The Spire. Rumors about &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;aliens&lt;/a&gt; start to spread so the IO sends a &lt;a href=\"Downed%20Black%20Helicopter\"&gt;Helicopter&lt;/a&gt; to investigate, but it crashed. They try to silence the person speaking of the aliens, &lt;a href=\"Mari%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;Mari&lt;/a&gt;, who now knows of their existence. Soon after these sightings, &lt;a href=\"The%20Mothership\"&gt;The Mothership&lt;/a&gt; arrives at &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;The Island&lt;/a&gt;, destroying The Spire for good and turning the tower into &lt;a href=\"Aftermath\"&gt;The Aftermath&lt;/a&gt;. Slone and a group of &lt;a href=\"IO%20Guards\"&gt;IO Guards&lt;/a&gt; return to &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt;, starting the events of .\n \n&lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Slone&lt;/a&gt; opens a &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;Sideways Rift&lt;/a&gt; above &lt;a href=\"Gotham%20City\"&gt;Gotham City&lt;/a&gt; to bring &lt;a href=\"Deathstroke%20Zero\"&gt;Deathstroke&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt;, and lure &lt;a href=\"Batman%20Zero\"&gt;Batman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Catwoman%20Zero\"&gt;Catwoman&lt;/a&gt; inside to help Deathstroke plant Slone's anchor device into &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, which was inside &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt; that was evacuated during &lt;a href=\"Zero%20Crisis%20Finale\"&gt;Zero Crisis Finale&lt;/a&gt;. IO employees watch the progress of &lt;a href=\"Batman%20Zero\"&gt;Batman&lt;/a&gt;, so he doesn't escape before they are are ready. After Batman gets closer and closer to escaping each round, they send in &lt;a href=\"Snake%20Eyes\"&gt;Snake Eyes&lt;/a&gt; to distract him. They then make an alliance, and Snake Eyes lets Batman leave &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt;. Batman joins a team of loopers who've escaped &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt;, and the team reach &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. Deathstroke then betrays them, using his &lt;a href=\"Portal%20Device\"&gt;Portal Device&lt;/a&gt; to return to &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Adc%3AMetropolis\"&gt;Metropolis&lt;/a&gt;, where a new &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;Sideways Rift&lt;/a&gt; has opened.\nVillains led by &lt;a href=\"Lex%20Luthor\"&gt;Lex Luthor&lt;/a&gt; try to reach to the &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;Sideways Rift&lt;/a&gt; opened by the IO, while the &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Adc%3AJustice%20League%20%28Prime%20Earth%29\"&gt;Justice League&lt;/a&gt; try to defend the rift. &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; tells &lt;a href=\"Batman%20Zero\"&gt;Batman&lt;/a&gt; the true intentions of the IO, and their history with &lt;a href=\"The%20Omniverse\"&gt;The Omniverse&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Batman%20Who%20Laughs\"&gt;The Batman Who Laughs&lt;/a&gt; then enters &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt; to reach &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; and corrupt more realities, all with infinite possibilities.\nThe IO finally fully reveal themselves to the Loopers to protect &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;Alien Invaders&lt;/a&gt;. They set up &lt;a href=\"Satellite%20Stations\"&gt;Satellite Stations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"IO%20Camps\"&gt;Camps&lt;/a&gt; all around the &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the alien activities and &lt;a href=\"The%20Mothership\"&gt;The Mothership&lt;/a&gt;'s movement. &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Slone&lt;/a&gt; recruits &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; and sends them to missions to find out more about the aliens.\nThere are rumors of a &lt;a href=\"Maven\"&gt;mole&lt;/a&gt; working for the Imagined Order, and Slone tasks the Looper with finding them. Numerous IO agents; including &lt;a href=\"Rick%20Sanchez\"&gt;Rick Sanchez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maven\"&gt;Maven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rook\"&gt;Rook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marigold\"&gt;Marigold&lt;/a&gt; instruct the Looper in their recruitment to the IO. Slone's second task for the Looper has them infiltrate &lt;a href=\"Believer%20Beach\"&gt;Believer Beach&lt;/a&gt; to earn the &lt;a href=\"Sunny\"&gt;ringleader&lt;/a&gt;'s trust. They meet &lt;a href=\"Joey\"&gt;Joey&lt;/a&gt;, who knows how to disrupt &lt;a href=\"The%20Mothership\"&gt;the mothership&lt;/a&gt;'s communications by placing alien light communication devices on mountain tops. Slone wants to investigate &lt;a href=\"Sunny\"&gt;Sunny&lt;/a&gt; and find out if she is the said ringleader. The Looper goes to earn her trust by making contact with &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;aliens&lt;/a&gt; and help her welcome them. Slone wants &lt;a href=\"Hayseed\"&gt;Hayseed&lt;/a&gt;, one of the island's biggest preppers, on the IO's side. To lure aliens, the IO invents &lt;a href=\"Inflate-A-Bull\"&gt;Inflate-A-Bulls&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing its effectiveness, Slone initiates Operation Fauxvine to handle the &lt;a href=\"Saucer\"&gt;Saucers&lt;/a&gt; and the abduction crisis. Rook tasks the Looper to hunt down the traitor &lt;a href=\"Riot\"&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt;, alongside &lt;a href=\"Special%20Forces%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Special Forces&lt;/a&gt;' help. After searching the southeast corner of the Island, they eliminate Riot and report to command. A major IO security breach happens and Slone wants to investigate. The Looper finds an access card for her and plant wiretraps to listen to \"off the record\" IO chatter, confirming the existence of a mole. The mole leaks secret information about the IO to the public, and the Looper mindwipes the civillains. An existence of an \"infiltratior of alien variety\" is also found by Slone and the Looper goes to confront and eliminate them. To learn more about the aliens, Slone and the Looper start monitoring their behavior and presence on the Island. Noticing the rise in abduction numbers and the aliens' interest in &lt;a href=\"Slurpy%20Swamp\"&gt;Slurpy Swamp&lt;/a&gt;, the Looper clears the area so the IO can investigate. Desperate for an insider asset, Slone needs to squeeze intel from &lt;a href=\"Joey\"&gt;Joey&lt;/a&gt; or even recruit them. The Looper bribes her with cat food and human gifts, and she agrees to try to discourage the aliens from annihiliating the Island. \nThe IO comes up with a counter attack, but it has been compromized. Slone and the Looper decide to create a backup plan. They collect Alien Devices to activate the &lt;a href=\"Countermeasure%20Device\"&gt;Countermeasure Device&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Corny%20Complex\"&gt;Corny Complex&lt;/a&gt; and create hundreds of bombs. &lt;a href=\"Marigold\"&gt;Marigold&lt;/a&gt; helps the Looper to bait the aliens into abducting their bombs and pressure them into making a big move. She \"leaks\" the location of their secret base to tempt the Mole into sharing it with the aliens, but share it with locals by herself for insurance. The countermeasure devices are prepared to strike the Motership, but the area it is expected to crash on is populated. The Looper warns everyone to give them time to leave and prevent them from interfering. The Mole activates the devices early but their plan is quickly spoiled by the Looper. Identifying &lt;a href=\"Maven\"&gt;Maven&lt;/a&gt; as the Mole, the Looper is sent to eliminate her and does so successfully.\nSlone contacts the strike team she made, and place them on the floating parts of &lt;a href=\"Corny%20Complex\"&gt;Corny Complex&lt;/a&gt; that are being abducted to ride along the bombs. The &lt;a href=\"The%20Mothership\"&gt;Mothership&lt;/a&gt; finally abducts &lt;a href=\"Corny%20Complex\"&gt;Corny Complex&lt;/a&gt; along with Slone's strike team. She guides them through the ship so they can reach the abduction chamber window. The window gets locked and a &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube\"&gt;Cube&lt;/a&gt; rises from the water. Slone is shocked by the Cube's return and weaponizes the Looper's &lt;a href=\"Alien%20Jetpack\"&gt;Alien Jetpacks&lt;/a&gt; to deactivate the Cube. She then leaves the Looper's inside &lt;a href=\"The%20Mothership\"&gt;The Mothership&lt;/a&gt;, as she is afraid of &lt;a href=\"Cubes\"&gt;The Cube&lt;/a&gt; returning to the &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt;. As a last stand the Loopers reboot &lt;a href=\"Rebooted%20Cube\"&gt;The Cube&lt;/a&gt; and turn it blue. The Cube activates an elevator and brings the team to the &lt;a href=\"Corruption%20Cubes\"&gt;Cube&lt;/a&gt; Chamber inside &lt;a href=\"The%20Mothership\"&gt;The Mothership&lt;/a&gt;, where they see numerous Cubes and veins growing from them. They all slowly starting to turn purple, one by one, except of &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Cube\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, that instead of purple, glows gold. &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Slone&lt;/a&gt; then activates the bombs and destroys &lt;a href=\"The%20Mothership\"&gt;The Mothership&lt;/a&gt; without knowing what's inside of it and ends up bringing all the &lt;a href=\"Cubes\"&gt;Cubes&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nSlone and 2 &lt;a href=\"IO%20Guards\"&gt;IO Guards&lt;/a&gt; collect parts from &lt;a href=\"The%20Mothership\"&gt;The Mothership&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Destroyed%20Dish\"&gt;Destroyed Dish&lt;/a&gt; and pack them on a truck. They travel as a &lt;a href=\"IO%20Convoy\"&gt;Convoy&lt;/a&gt; and travel from &lt;a href=\"Compact%20Cars\"&gt;Compact Cars&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"%2A%2AREDACTED%2A%2A\"&gt;**REDACTED**&lt;/a&gt;. When they reach their destination, they open the bunker door and reveal the &lt;a href=\"IO%20Staging%20Facility\"&gt;IO Staging Facility&lt;/a&gt;. In an unknown moment in the season, the IO capture &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt; and penalty him with termination for betrayal to the Imagined Order at &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28Chapter%202%29\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; infiltrates &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and rescues &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt;, who's being interrogates by Doctor Slone. &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; enters the room and eliminates an IO Guard and &lt;a href=\"Gunnar\"&gt;Gunnar&lt;/a&gt;, stamping his face into a computer that's controlling Jones' vitals also locking Doctor Slone inside the room. &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; and a group of Loopers enter &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt; through a &lt;a href=\"IO%20Hatches\"&gt;Hatch&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Guava%20Fort\"&gt;Guava Fort&lt;/a&gt; while Jones and &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; hold back incoming &lt;a href=\"IO%20Guards\"&gt;IO Guards&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt; starts to flip over, causing &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt; to get heavily damaged in the chaos. &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; and the Loopers make their way to The Bridge, but a &lt;a href=\"Caretaker\"&gt;Caretaker&lt;/a&gt; breaks open the glass ceiling of The Bridge, flooding it and causing everyone to float to the surface.\nThe IO has lost all the control they have over &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt; and are left in the caverns between &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;. However, to get back on the Island, they send Drills. &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; is the first to reach Artemis as &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Stealth%20Slone\"&gt;Snow Stealth Slone&lt;/a&gt; and after her, &lt;a href=\"Mole%20Teams\"&gt;Mole Teams&lt;/a&gt; reach the surface one by one, along with &lt;a href=\"IO%20Guards\"&gt;IO Guards&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Gunnar\"&gt;Gunnar&lt;/a&gt; and his IO Guards drill through &lt;a href=\"Pinnacle%20Peak\"&gt;Pinnacle Peak&lt;/a&gt; and build &lt;a href=\"Covert%20Cavern\"&gt;Covert Cavern&lt;/a&gt; inside, a headquarters of the Imagined Order disguised as a huge mountain. They then send &lt;a href=\"IO%20Patrol\"&gt;IO Patrol&lt;/a&gt; to roam around the Island in &lt;a href=\"Cars\"&gt;Cars&lt;/a&gt; to explore &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;. The IO mysteriously sabotage &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt;'s 2nd Rocket Launch attempt. Using a giant drill named &lt;a href=\"The%20Fortress\"&gt;The Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, they cause &lt;a href=\"Earthquakes\"&gt;Earthquakes&lt;/a&gt; to happen and reach &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Outpost%20VI\"&gt;Seven Outpost VI&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Fortress rises from &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Outpost%20VI\"&gt;Seven Outpost VI&lt;/a&gt;, and an army of IO soldiers including Doctor Slone and &lt;a href=\"Gunnar\"&gt;Gunnar&lt;/a&gt; reach the surface, officially starting a war against &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt;. All the &lt;a href=\"Mole%20Teams\"&gt;Mole Teams&lt;/a&gt; have moved to &lt;a href=\"Covert%20Cavern\"&gt;Covert Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, which is now upgraded and renamed as &lt;a href=\"Command%20Cavern\"&gt;Command Cavern&lt;/a&gt;. The Mole Teams get replaced by &lt;a href=\"IO%20Outposts\"&gt;Outposts&lt;/a&gt; and the The Fortress has moved towards &lt;a href=\"Happy%20Camper\"&gt;Happy Camper&lt;/a&gt;. They send out an all-out attack on &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;, deploying their &lt;a href=\"IO%20Airships\"&gt;Airships&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Titan%20Tank\"&gt;Titan Tanks&lt;/a&gt; all over locations on the Island. \nThe IO disguise jammers around the island to block &lt;a href=\"Building\"&gt;Building&lt;/a&gt;. The plan doesn't work for long, though, because their jammers have been deactivated by &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; and Slone's plan has failed forcing her to move to Plan B. &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; asks &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; to place recon cameras, since he belives Slone has something big up her sleeve. He learns that the IO's DOD--Department of Dirigibles--got their combat blimps in the field. The Looper plants a data scraper on an IO blimp to be collected later. &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt; steal a &lt;a href=\"Titan%20Tank\"&gt;Tank&lt;/a&gt; from the IO to reverse engineer it, leading the IO to develop anti-tank barricades since they believe they are building tanks of their own. Instead, &lt;a href=\"The%20Origin\"&gt;The Origin&lt;/a&gt; decides to surprise them by deploying and &lt;a href=\"Armored%20Battle%20Bus\"&gt;Armored Battle Buses&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Imagined\"&gt;The Imagined&lt;/a&gt; asks the Looper to wiretap the IO to learn about a sensitive Imagined Order records cache. As The Seven gather more &lt;a href=\"Loopers\"&gt;Loopers&lt;/a&gt; to join their side, they send attacks on the locations IO tookover and slowly start to regain the control of the Island, claiming the IO's locations and crashing their &lt;a href=\"IO%20Airships\"&gt;Airships&lt;/a&gt; along. The Imagined sends a drone to pick up the collected data from the data scraper the Looper had placed earlier. The data the Looper acquired has been corrupted so they use the computers at &lt;a href=\"Daily%20Rubble\"&gt;Daily Rubble&lt;/a&gt; to recover a data drive.\nIntel reaches Jones that an IO &lt;a href=\"The%20Collider\"&gt;doomsday machine&lt;/a&gt; is in production. Loopers sympathethic to the IO start losing their faith in Slone and her forces, giving insider intel to &lt;a href=\"The%20Resistance\"&gt;The Resistance&lt;/a&gt;. Jones makes a counter propaganda mixtape that is played when the Looper hacks the IO's propaganda intercom. Jones loses his IO credentials, but hacks into a top-secret IO server at &lt;a href=\"Command%20Cavern\"&gt;Command Cavern&lt;/a&gt; to find all the data on &lt;a href=\"The%20Sisters\"&gt;The Sisters&lt;/a&gt; deleted. Upon further investigation, it is revealed that it was &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt; who deleted them. After the IO loses the Battle of &lt;a href=\"Tilted%20Towers\"&gt;Tilted Towers&lt;/a&gt;; The Seven corner the IO at &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Command%20Cavern\"&gt;Command Cavern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Fortress\"&gt;The Fortress&lt;/a&gt; as they work on their mysterious Doomsday Device. Jones installs a seismometer on The Fortress to track its movement. The doomsday device is revealed as &lt;a href=\"The%20Collider\"&gt;The Collider&lt;/a&gt; and stands tall in &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt;. The Origin locates The Collider's two activation keys Jones and the Looper cut the IO's power, which Jones speculates is used to charge the IO's combat shielding. With the IO systems on safe boot mode, the Origin accesses a holo-table to simulate the effects of The Collider, which reveals its purpose: to destroy everything in &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt;. The Collider shoots out many pulses as it charges up, becoming ready for use.\n \n&lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt; attacks an &lt;a href=\"IO%20Outposts%20%28Zero%20War%29\"&gt;Outpost&lt;/a&gt; to get access to &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt; but are blocked by &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Slone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gunnar\"&gt;Gunnar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"IO%20Guards\"&gt;IO Guards&lt;/a&gt;. To not let them in, Slone blows up the entrance, but Jones finds a pipe IO uses to throw toxic waste into the ocean. &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Imagined\"&gt;The Imagined&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spider-Man%20Zero\"&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/a&gt; infiltrate the Bridge, looking for &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; chamber. Gunnar and Slone ambush them, forcing them to flee into . &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt; contacts &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Doom\"&gt;Doctor Doom&lt;/a&gt; to invite him in the IO's inner circle, needing his help to get &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Shard\"&gt;The Zero Shard&lt;/a&gt;.\n The Seven collects a group of heroes from Reality: 616 to help them, launching another attack. The Foundation, &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Man%20Zero\"&gt;Iron Man&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thor\"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Storm%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Storm&lt;/a&gt; steal one of IO's shuttles and fly to &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile Doom forms an army of &lt;a href=\"Hybrid%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Hybrids&lt;/a&gt; and sends them to \"help\" &lt;a href=\"Stegron\"&gt;Stegron&lt;/a&gt;, leading Jones and his team to fight with the High Evolutionary. As the High Evolutionary and Stegron are distracted, Doom steals the Zero Shard and escapes to The Ice Moon. Using a &lt;a href=\"Portal%20Device\"&gt;Portal Device&lt;/a&gt;, the group follows Doom. &lt;a href=\"Wolverine%20Zero\"&gt;Wolverine&lt;/a&gt; tracks Doom to &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20King%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;The Ice King&lt;/a&gt;'s castle. Doom attacks them using items from the Ice King's collection, causing Spider-Man to sneak and steal the Zero Shard. He brings it to &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt; and reactivates the &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Mecha Team Leader&lt;/a&gt;. All of the groups return to &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt; for the final battle.\n&lt;a href=\"Collision\"&gt;Collision&lt;/a&gt; /.\nThe Collider activates sooner than expected, and cause &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt; to act quicker than planned. The IO set shield generators to protect The Collider, that later get deactivated by The Seven. After &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Strike%20Commander\"&gt;Mecha Strike Commander&lt;/a&gt;'s landing on &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;, IO send in drills, &lt;a href=\"Titan%20Tank\"&gt;tanks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"IO%20Airships\"&gt;blimps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"B.R.U.T.E.\"&gt;BRUTEs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Fortress\"&gt;The Fortress&lt;/a&gt; to destroy it. They successfully knock it down, but &lt;a href=\"Peely\"&gt;Peely&lt;/a&gt; helps the Mecha and heals it with a slurp truck. Mecha destroys their defenses and gets to &lt;a href=\"The%20Collider\"&gt;The Collider&lt;/a&gt;, but as it is about to destroy it, the ground sinks in and the Mecha falls into the hole. The Weapons Team eject and are led to &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Imagined\"&gt;The Imagined&lt;/a&gt; notices &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt; on an upper platform, firing an energy beam at &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Man%20Zero\"&gt;Iron Man&lt;/a&gt;, causing him to crash. She calls &lt;a href=\"The%20Order\"&gt;The Order&lt;/a&gt; to help her, telling that \"daddy's home\". &lt;a href=\"The%20Sisters\"&gt;The Sisters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wolverine%20Zero\"&gt;Wolverine&lt;/a&gt; climb up The Collider and blast near Geno where they get into a fight. Geno doesn't kill the sisters and rather shows mercy, but The Order kicks him, making all of them fall and hold on to the platform. The Imagined sacrifices herself and jumps into &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, taking Geno with her. Slone tells &lt;a href=\"Gunnar\"&gt;Gunnar&lt;/a&gt; to find Doctor Doom and help the IO with &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20King%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;The Ice King&lt;/a&gt;'s weapons. Gunnar finds Doom in the lower levels, preparing to leave. He blasts Gunnar and goes back to &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Amarvel%3ALatveria\"&gt;Latveria&lt;/a&gt;. In an attempt to kill Jones, Slone gets inside her tank but is crushed by the Mecha. Foundation and Jones see Geno in the Zero Point, so they jump in to search for him. The Weapons Team destroys the crystals powering the Collider, and it blows up into pieces. Foundation and Jones end up at the \"Realm\". They watch them discorporate into pieces and get scattered across The Omniverse. Geno's remnants travel through multiple Realities, winding up at a singular spot and reforming Geno.\nThe IO's presence on the island has been eliminated, with their remains being turned into places like &lt;a href=\"Rave%20Cave\"&gt;Rave Cave&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drill%20Hill\"&gt;Drill Hill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Glow\"&gt;The Glow&lt;/a&gt;. The only known survivors of &lt;a href=\"Collision\"&gt;Collision&lt;/a&gt; are: &lt;a href=\"Panther\"&gt;Panther&lt;/a&gt;, a secret agent sent to infiltrate &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Order%20Remnant\"&gt;Order Remnant&lt;/a&gt;, an IO Guard that joined a group of &lt;a href=\"Henchbros\"&gt;lonely Henchmen&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Undercover%20Kor\"&gt;Kor&lt;/a&gt;, who went undercover during &lt;a href=\"No%20Sweat%20Summer\"&gt;No Sweat Summer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Innovator%20Slone\"&gt;Slone&lt;/a&gt; who was saved by &lt;a href=\"Relik\"&gt;Relik&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs Jones traveled back in time, he arrived in an &lt;a href=\"Fortnite%20OG%27s%20Reality\"&gt;alternative timeline&lt;/a&gt;, during &lt;a href=\"Season%205\"&gt;Season 5&lt;/a&gt; era. The &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; Island of this timeline and its inhabitants were different from that of &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt;, just like the events that happened.

Wall and Floor Launcher traps (as an example) will only send a husk flying if their impact tolerance is exceeded. If you've done impact damage to a husk but haven't broken their limit then they'll just shrug it off and keep walking. Impact (in a way) is fundamentally the value that determines whether you can apply certain crowd control effects to a husk.\nHusks have an impact threshold. The higher power the husk the higher the number. Smashers have the highest. When their impact threshold is broken, it will knock back or stun the husk. There is also &lt;a href=\"knock%20back\"&gt;knock back&lt;/a&gt; but epic doesn\u2019t let us see those numbers. The higher the knock back is on a weapon, the farther it will send the husks flying\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DU64a1B8ZoAM%26amp%3Bfeature%3Dyoutu.be\"&gt;Here's an example of impact at work&lt;/a&gt;. Normally a single launcher trap will not have enough impact to send a Smasher flying (if they haven't taken any impact damage). In this example a wall dynamo deals a little impact damage in preparation. Since impact damage occurred before hand, once the Smasher gets to the Floor Launcher the 'attack' from the launcher (which does no health damage) will exceed the impact tolerance of the Smasher and send it flying.\n=Weapons=\nBlunt weapons, Hydraulic weapons, shotguns, explosives/launchers and \"handcannon\" pistols generally have high impact and knockback damage\nSpears have less impact but more knockback, and are able to continuously knock down a smasher without it ever getting back up using the heavy attack\nFortunately the higher impact weapons dont knock them back but instead it \"staggers\" them causing them to flinch very quickly interrupting there next action\nMost importantly is that both of these stats do not affect damage at all"}

Parts are located by speaking with special &lt;a href=\"Characters\"&gt;Characters&lt;/a&gt; named Huntmasters. They will locate parts for players in exchange for a &lt;a href=\"Raptor%20%28Animal%29\"&gt;Raptor&lt;/a&gt; Claw.\nAs the game progresses, the day will end and the Island will darken as usual. During this time, many Hostile &lt;a href=\"AIs\"&gt;AIs&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Animal%29\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadows\"&gt;Shadows&lt;/a&gt; (referred to as Daybreak Ghosts) will spawn to attack players. After the day ends, the Daybreak Ghosts will disappear and the Wolves will remain. These AIs will not respawn until the next night. When &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt; closes in, &lt;a href=\"Marauders\"&gt;Marauders&lt;/a&gt; (referred to as Daybreak Marauders) wearing the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Voyager\"&gt;Dark Voyager&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Outfits\"&gt;Outfit&lt;/a&gt; will spawn to attack players.\nThe broken Choppa and the Choppa parts will be guarded by Guards. These are Hostile &lt;a href=\"AIs\"&gt;AIs&lt;/a&gt; who take the form of either &lt;a href=\"Kitbash\"&gt;Kitbash&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Rust%20Lord\"&gt;Rust Lord&lt;/a&gt;. Eliminating all of one group of these AIs will eliminate them all. They can also be &lt;a href=\"Shakedown\"&gt;Shakendown&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen picked up, these parts will be held over the head like a &lt;a href=\"Propane%20Tank\"&gt;Propane Tank&lt;/a&gt; but can be stored in the inventory. They take up three slots in the inventory, and so only one can be carried per player. The part is attached to the Choppa with the interact button or key, and once all parts are attached, the Choppa will need refueling, and it can be flown to the exfil location. Achieving this grants players a &lt;a href=\"Victory%20Royale\"&gt;Victory Royale&lt;/a&gt;.\nRules.\nImpossible Escape! has two versions, PvE and PvP:\nLoot Pool.\nThe Loot Pool for Impossible Escape! is altered:\n&lt;a href=\"Choppa%20%28Vehicle%29\"&gt;Choppa&lt;/a&gt; Parts.\nFour parts are required for the Choppa to be fixed.

Agents complete Assignments like calibrating &lt;a href=\"Containers\"&gt;Chests&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Supply%20Llama\"&gt;Llamas&lt;/a&gt;, repairing a &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Bus\"&gt;Battle Bus&lt;/a&gt;, and delivering reports about &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt; for analysis.

You're now able to select if you prefer to be an Impostor or Agent. Based on your choice, you\u2019ll be more likely to be selected as that role when playing Public and Private matches, although your preferred role is not guaranteed.\nVoting.\nPlayers can force a Discussion to check in on Agents and discuss the Impostor infiltration. Discussions can be called by finding an eliminated Agent and reporting it or by interacting with the Discussion panel in The Bridge\u2019s center room. During discussions, players can share information with each other via &lt;a href=\"Emotes\"&gt;Emotes&lt;/a&gt; and the Quick Chat menu, asking contextual questions about what players were doing and accusing suspicious players for ejection. \nAt the end of each Discussion, Agents and Impostors will vote to either eject someone from The Bridge or to skip their vote for that Discussion. \nQueuing and Communicating.\nPlayers can queue up with any party size and any remaining slots will be filled. To keep gameplay fair and fun, public voice chat is disabled in Impostors but players can still communicate with each other in party chat by using &lt;a href=\"Emotes\"&gt;Emotes&lt;/a&gt; and the Quick Chat menu.\nPlayers can select the Private option when queuing into Impostors and as few as four players in their party can launch into their own custom game. Starting a game with four to seven total players will only have one Impostor, while eight or more will have two Impostors. Players can also change their party settings by selecting the Gear icon in their Friends list to:"}

It is like a typical Battle Royale game, 100 players descend onto the map to fight one another in a last man standing finish. In this mode, however, the Infinity Gauntlet is hidden on the map, and whomsoever finds and equips it will transform into &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Amarvelcinematicuniverse%3AThanos\"&gt;Thanos&lt;/a&gt; from Marvel's \"&lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Amarvelcinematicuniverse%3AAvengers%3A%20Infinity%20War\"&gt;Avengers: Infinity War&lt;/a&gt;\".

It was added in .\nFunctionality.\nThe Inflate-A-Bull is used to negate fall damage, and quickly traverse the map, by using gravity and momentum to your advantage. Deploying an Inflate-A-Bull forces the player into a inflatable bull, just larger than the player. This must be done in the air. This bull will react to gravity and any momentum given to it, using these to bounce rapidly across the map. The greater the momentum, the further you are launched. Players can move the bull by themselves, as well as jump, and steer it in the air.\nThe Inflate-A-Bull has similar mechanics to a &lt;a href=\"Jetpack\"&gt;Jetpack&lt;/a&gt; in that it uses a durability gauge which is depleted as the item is used. The gauge is depleted by moving along the ground, or by bumping into objects or hitting the ground. The item goes on a cooldown of 8 seconds after use. The Inflate-A-Bull is destroyed by opponent attacks. This causes it to go on a 16 second cooldown. Also like a Jetpack, the player may only hold one at a time, and the item is swapped out when attempting to pick up a second one. Players exit the Bull by holding interact, and can 'Moo' by pressing the attack button.\nObtained.\n\"As of when it was last obtainable in Chapter 2: Season 7\"\nThe Inflate-A-Bull can also be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Rick%20Sanchez\"&gt;Rick Sanchez&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"Defiant%20Dish\"&gt;Defiant Dish&lt;/a&gt;, for 25 &lt;a href=\"Bars\"&gt;Bars&lt;/a&gt;."}

He was first introduced in Chapter 2: Season 6, but was (probably) seen in Chapter 1.\nPersonnality.\nJonesy The First is very different from the Jones we know. Indeed as a fighter he is extremely arrogant and often believes himself superior to others, even to his original. He is obsessed with fighting and often underestimates his opponents. Just like Jones he sometimes acts like an idiot, however he knows how to act seriously when he really has to.\nHistory.\nBefore Fortnite.\nJonesy The First was created before &lt;a href=\"Bunker%20Jonesy\"&gt;Bunker Jonesy&lt;/a&gt;, himself one of Jones' oldest Snapshots, having been created when the Imagined Order was experimenting on the Zero Point.\nChapter 2: Season 6.\nJonesy The First plays a central role, when The Looper, searching for Agent Jones following the message left by The Foundation, started to seek all of Jones' snapshots. After discussions with a large number of Snapshot of Jones, Sash Sergeant and Slurp Jonesy revealed the existence of \"The First Jones\" to the Looper, leading them to seek him.\nUpon meeting him, The Looper explained the situation with The Spire, The Foundation and Agent Jones and Jonesy The First agreed to help them if they proved strong enough. He lost the duel and began to reveal some secrets about The Spire, warning them not to let anyone powerful be corrupted, as this might attract the attention of something. At the same time &lt;a href=\"Raz\"&gt;Raz&lt;/a&gt; seized a fragment of the Spire's Core making him extremely powerful. They asked The Looper to get the Spire Artifact back before Raz attract more unwanted attention however it was already too late.\nChapter 3: Season 1.\nJonesy The First was released by The Seven for an unspecified period and with other Joneses founded The Joneses. An independent village against both the Imagined Order and The Seven.\nHowever later, the village finally agreed to ally with The Seven against The Imagined Order, thanks to the help of The Looper.\nChapter 3: Season 2.\nHe participated in the war against The Imagined Order as a member of The Resistance and leader of the Joneses.\nChapter 3: Season 3.\nAfter the war ended, Jonesy The First sought a new occupation involving combat.\nChapter 3: Season 4.\nWith the arrival of &lt;a href=\"The%20Herald\"&gt;The Herald&lt;/a&gt;, Jonesy the First and the other Joneses transformed &lt;a href=\"The%20Joneses\"&gt;The Joneses&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Jonesy\"&gt;Fort Jonesy&lt;/a&gt; to avoid Chrome altogether. He and the other Joneses were tasked by &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt; (having taken over command) to monitor The Herald.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Father-Daughter time.\" When he interacts with her.\nShe is a major antagonist in &lt;a href=\"Fortnite\"&gt;Fortnite&lt;/a&gt;, serving as the secondary antagonist of and .\nPersonality.\nJules is a fan of technology and machines. After being left on her father's shadow for years, she learned how to rebuild the world the way she wanted to see it and is on track to be one of the greatest inventors of all time.\nTimeline.\nLong ago, Jules was a princess and daughter of the golden king, &lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt;. After Midas received the curse of the golden touch, he accidentally turned Jules into gold killing her in the process. Midas eventually resurrected Jules but the cost was great, however Jules' trust was forever broken.\nJules helps her father &lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt; build a &lt;a href=\"Doomsday%20Device\"&gt;Device&lt;/a&gt; that can break &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt;. The Device ends up failing and creates a huge flood on &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;the island&lt;/a&gt;.\nJules and her &lt;a href=\"SHADOW%20Henchmen\"&gt;SHADOW Henchmen&lt;/a&gt; rebuild the remains of &lt;a href=\"The%20Agency\"&gt;The Agency&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"The%20Authority\"&gt;The Authority&lt;/a&gt;, and build a water wall to keep it safe from the flood. She stays as the last remaining public leader of &lt;a href=\"SHADOW\"&gt;SHADOW&lt;/a&gt; until the end of the season.\nHer voice can sometimes be heard near &lt;a href=\"IO%20Elevators\"&gt;IO Elevators&lt;/a&gt; before they open. \nAfter &lt;a href=\"SHADOW\"&gt;SHADOW&lt;/a&gt; gets deactivated, Jules moves into &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Cod\"&gt;Camp Cod&lt;/a&gt;. She befriends &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; and tells them that \"If we all work together, we can get out of here\". She joins the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Scrapknight%20Jules\"&gt;Scrapknight Jules&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe participated in the &lt;a href=\"Cosmic%20Summer%20Celebration\"&gt;Cosmic Summer Celebration&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Beach%20Jules\"&gt;Beach Jules&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Midsummer%20Midas\"&gt;Midsummer Midas&lt;/a&gt;. Her, &lt;a href=\"Marigold\"&gt;Marigold&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt; are planning something, this can be seen through her special dialogue when talking to &lt;a href=\"Marigold\"&gt;Marigold&lt;/a&gt;. After the Summer ends, Midas disappears.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Scrapknight%20Jules\"&gt;Scrapknight Jules&lt;/a&gt;, she searches for &lt;a href=\"Obi-Wan%20Kenobi\"&gt;Obi-Wan Kenobi&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Gunnar\"&gt;Gunnar&lt;/a&gt; and other IO troops.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Scrapknight%20Jules\"&gt;Scrapknight Jules&lt;/a&gt;, she joined &lt;a href=\"Oathbound\"&gt;Oathbound&lt;/a&gt; in order to learn more about their technology. Her interaction with &lt;a href=\"The%20Ageless\"&gt;The Ageless&lt;/a&gt; reveals that she works with the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Warden%20Stellan\"&gt;Rift Warden.&lt;/a&gt; At the end of the season, special dialogue spoken by Scrapknight Jules heavily implies that her and &lt;a href=\"Evie\"&gt;Evie&lt;/a&gt; are the culprits behind the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Gate\"&gt;Rift Gate&lt;/a&gt;, as she claims to have \"the Island's best interests at heart\".\n&lt;a href=\"Marigold\"&gt;Marigold&lt;/a&gt; has suspicions that Midas is on the island, so she calls Jules and the rest of &lt;a href=\"Midas%27%20Crew\"&gt;Midas' Crew&lt;/a&gt; back together. Jules wanted to stay out of family drama, but was roped into in nevertheless.\nAfter Midas escapes &lt;a href=\"The%20Underworld\"&gt;The Underworld&lt;/a&gt;, he finds Jules and says he sees she's outgrown his shadow, and that he hopes she hasn\u2019t left him behind.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Rise%20of%20Midas\"&gt;Rise of Midas&lt;/a&gt; quests, Jules is tasked by a \"Mutual Contact\" to help Midas with his Golden Touch problem. She plans to build him Gauntlets, which she makes using mysterious \"Essence\" from the Underworld.\nReferences.\n=Audio=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

There are often rifts on the hill north of Junkyard and can be up to four. There are also three ziplines starting from this hill going to the cottage north-west, the chest spawn east and the rock formation south which also links to other ziplines which can lead all the way to the plane spawns near Fatal Fields. There are also up to 4 quadcrashers that can spawn east of the hill.\nThe safe zone is often not on Junkyard and can be as far away as dusty divot. If this is the case you can amass roughly 1,200 materials before having to leave Junkyard to get to the safe zone using the ziplines of rifts. If the safe zone is on Junkyard or nearby then up to 2,000 materials can be harvested by the time the first safe zone finishes closing in.\nThis spot is often uncontested in normal games but in scrim games it can be directly contested as well as from other locations. If Junkyard is contested it can be hard to loot or farm materials before leaving for the circle so it is recommended not to go there for those games as it could end in an unwanted fight."}

Kado Thorne is part of the .\nCharacter Reaction.\n special dialogues for players wearing the Kado Thorne &lt;a href=\"Outfit\"&gt;Outfit&lt;/a&gt;.\nGallery.\n=Boss=\nHistory.\n=Lore=\nKado Thorne is an ancient vampire of &lt;a href=\"The%20Eclipse\"&gt;The Eclipse&lt;/a&gt; and the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Eclipse\"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt; faction. He is a space time traveler, a thief and a wealthy collector. He travels through space and time, stealing items from different realities and from time periods and leaving behind a calling card and a portrait of the Eclipse.\nHe is a major antagonist of , serving as the overarching antagonist of , the main antagonist of , and the main antagonist of the second half of Chapter 4 overall.\nPersonality.\nThorne is a voracious traveler with a hunger for all kinds of art forms, from ancient arts to modern arts. He will do anything just to get his hands on the things that interest him. If he couldn't buy it he would steal it. If it went extinct, he would time travel to get it.\nIt's shown in the &lt;a href=\"Fortnitemares%202023%20Quests\"&gt;Fortnitemares 2023 Quests&lt;/a&gt; that Thorne is very short-tempered, as he smashes some of his things out of rage. Additionally, his multiple portraits of himself imply that he is quite egotistical.\nAppearance.\nThorne in his human form appears as a very healthy and muscular man. He wears a robe that oddly resembles &lt;a href=\"The%20Ancients\"&gt;The Ancients&lt;/a&gt; statue. His default style shows him with mask and a very unique black hair cut that leaves room for his big Revenant ears. His Lavish/Collector style shows him with white hair and he also wears sunglasses.\nIn his Revenant form, he becomes a pale bat-like creature with no mouth. His robe is gone, his eyes turned blood red and he is covered in a light greenish aura with a mix of dark red aura.\nHistory.\nBefore Fortnite.\nKado Thorne was a very old vampire traveling across Time and The Omniverse with his Time Machine in search of new artifacts for his collection. Eons ago, &lt;a href=\"The%20Ancients\"&gt;The Ancients&lt;/a&gt; encountered him on one of his travels. They feared him so much that they created &lt;a href=\"The%20Apparatus\"&gt;The Apparatus&lt;/a&gt;, with the purpose to predict his arrival so they can make escape plans before it. They also left glyphs and murals to warn eventual future generations who would find their ruins. In one of his journies, Kado Thorne came across &lt;a href=\"The%20Triarchs\"&gt;The Triarchs&lt;/a&gt;' broken realm and stole some of their relics for his collection. Thorne's havoc across space and time caused him to became target of many vampire hunters, including the dark fae known as &lt;a href=\"Shimmerdusk\"&gt;Shimmerdusk&lt;/a&gt;.\nKado travels back in time to steal &lt;a href=\"Oro\"&gt;Oro&lt;/a&gt;'s head, &lt;a href=\"TNTina%27s%20Ka-Boom%20Bow\"&gt;TNTina's Ka-Boom Bow&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Midas%27%20Drum%20Gun%20%28OG%29\"&gt;Midas' Drum Gun&lt;/a&gt;.\nKado travels back in time to steal &lt;a href=\"Kit%27s%20Shockwave%20Launcher\"&gt;Kit's Shockwave Launcher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kit%27s%20Charge%20Shotgun\"&gt;Kit's Charge Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ocean%27s%20Bottomless%20Chug%20Jug\"&gt;Ocean's Bottomless Chug Jug&lt;/a&gt;.\nKado travels back in time to steal &lt;a href=\"Zyg%20and%20Choppy%27s%20Ray%20Gun\"&gt;Zyg and Choppy's Ray Gun&lt;/a&gt;.\nKado travels back in time to steal &lt;a href=\"Gunnar%27s%20Stinger%20SMG\"&gt;Gunnar's Stinger SMG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation%27s%20MK-Seven%20Assault%20Rifle\"&gt;The Foundation's MK-Seven Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt; and an artifact related to &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ruins of the Ancients were discovered after the central part of the Island collapsed, revealing a huge underground rainforest. The ruins revealed the arrival of Kado Thorne through murals, glyphs and &lt;a href=\"The%20Apparatus\"&gt;The Apparatus&lt;/a&gt; announcing an &lt;a href=\"The%20Eclipse\"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt; that should be astrologically impossible. The glyphs also mentioned his &lt;a href=\"Time%20Machine\"&gt;Time Machine&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; wanted to use to save the islanders from the arrival of the other enemies predicted by &lt;a href=\"Optimus%20Prime\"&gt;Optimus Prime&lt;/a&gt; and the impending collapse of Reality Zero.\nNear the end of season, many content creators' items were stolen by Kado.\n\nKado Thorne arrived on the Island with his &lt;a href=\"Time%20Machine\"&gt;Time Machine&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Eclipse\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;, and began to drain all the island's resources to build his resorts, which are actually very well protected strongholds to house his collection and his Time Machine, which he wanted to use to collect items from Reality Zero's past as well as for a more sinister plan. He also took control of &lt;a href=\"Rumble%20Ruins\"&gt;Rumble Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, and bought one of &lt;a href=\"MEGA%20City\"&gt;MEGA City&lt;/a&gt;'s luxury restaurants as well as &lt;a href=\"Slappy%20Shores\"&gt;Slappy Shores&lt;/a&gt;' main Slap Factory, all of which he also transformed into highly protected strongholds. Additionally, he took control of the &lt;a href=\"Mae\"&gt;Mae&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Forecast%20Towers\"&gt;Forecast Towers&lt;/a&gt;. \nAt some point, he traveled back in time to cut off Midas' left hand to add it in his collection.\nLater, in an attempt to steal the &lt;a href=\"Time%20Machine\"&gt;Time Machine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; formed a Heist Crew consisting of &lt;a href=\"Nolan%20Chance\"&gt;Nolan Chance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Antonia\"&gt;Antonia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Piper%20Pace\"&gt;Piper Pace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fish%20Thicc\"&gt;Fish Thicc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mae\"&gt;Mae&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Khaby%20Lame\"&gt;Khaby Lame&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile Thorne exited the Time Machine after his journey back to \"2020 03 25\" to get Oro's head for his collection, he finds the Heist Crew trying to rob his vault. After discovering the intruders in his estate, Thorne transforms into his Revenant Form and tries to kill them, forcing the crew to flee. After the Heist Crew's failure to steal the Time Machine, Thorne uses his Psionic powers to cause &lt;a href=\"The%20Eclipse\"&gt;The Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;, which began with a permanent Super Blood Moon and Solar Eclipse. Around this time, &lt;a href=\"Shimmerdusk\"&gt;Shimmerdusk&lt;/a&gt; arrives on the island to continue her hunt of him.\nAfter that, Kado Thorne remained in his Revenant form to protect his Time Machine himself. He also established his next target, \"2018 07 12\" the period of &lt;a href=\"Season%205\"&gt;Season 5&lt;/a&gt;, when Athena Island undergoes \"Worlds Collide.\" However his plan wasn't about obtaining items for his collection, but something more sinister that would put the fate of the Island at stake. Later, the Heist Crew managed to successfully steal his machine and take it to &lt;a href=\"The%20Getaway%20%28Landmark%29\"&gt;their base&lt;/a&gt; before his plan could take form.\nWith the Time Machine stolen, &lt;a href=\"Shimmerdusk\"&gt;Shimmerdusk&lt;/a&gt; was free to make her move onto her plan to assassinate Thorne. Throughout the &lt;a href=\"Fortnitemares%202023%20Quests\"&gt;Fortnitemares 2023 Quests&lt;/a&gt;, she enlists the help of The Looper to prepare. She has them stock up on ammo, eliminate Thorne's Guards, smash his valuables, etc. After weeks of preparing, she decides that they were ready and infiltrated his vault. She went to confront Kado , alongside &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;, and they successfully take him down. With Thorne defeated, she declares that he will \"no longer prey across time and space.\"\nThere are anachronisms present in Fortnite OG's Timeline, such as the book concerning the Chalice of Cubetastrophe, and a version of No Sweat Insurance depicting events that never happened in this timeline, suggesting Thorne already traveled here.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Bang\"&gt;The Big Bang&lt;/a&gt;, various items from Kado Thorne's collection as well as a painting of him placed just above a bed can be found in &lt;a href=\"Cloistered%20Castle\"&gt;Cloistered Castle&lt;/a&gt; despite Kado Thorne's presumed death at the hand of &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shimmerdusk\"&gt;Shimmerdusk&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Eclipse\"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt; opened a small restaurant at &lt;a href=\"Restored%20Reels\"&gt;Restored Reels&lt;/a&gt;.\nKado Thorne's Collection.\nThe following is a list of items collected by Kado Thorne:\nReferences.\n=Voice=\nEmote Voice.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}
