They were introduced in &lt;a href=\"Season%204\"&gt;Season 4&lt;/a&gt;, and usually occur in the middle or near the end of the season. Some events involve turning off shooting, so everyone can enjoy the event. Sometimes, &lt;a href=\"building\"&gt;building&lt;/a&gt; is still enabled, so players can build up and get a better view. Some events occur during a match of &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Royale\"&gt;Battle Royale&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nSeason 3.\nThe Meteor.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Meteor\"&gt;The Meteor&lt;/a&gt; Event was an event that happened in &lt;a href=\"Season%203\"&gt;Season 3&lt;/a&gt; and started off &lt;a href=\"Season%204\"&gt;Season 4&lt;/a&gt;. The event was responsible for destroying &lt;a href=\"Dusty%20Depot\"&gt;Dusty Depot&lt;/a&gt;, as well as causing every single event succeeding it. It is also the very first major event.\nThe event started when players began seeing a small comet in the sky that kept getting larger by the day. The community speculated that the meteor was going to hit the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Royale%20Map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; and destroy &lt;a href=\"Tilted%20Towers\"&gt;Tilted Towers&lt;/a&gt;. Epic Games even played along with the community by placing watch stations on top of a building and around Tilted. Smaller meteors also began falling from the sky, with a chance to destroy player made buildings. The meteor eventually descended upon the map and hit Dusty Depot, turning it into &lt;a href=\"Dusty%20Divot\"&gt;Dusty Divot&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeason 4.\nThe Rocket Launch.\n&lt;a href=\"Blast%20Off\"&gt;The Blast Off&lt;/a&gt; Event (also known as The Rocket Launch) happened near the end of Season 4, as the season's major event.\nThe event was started by &lt;a href=\"The%20Visitor\"&gt;The Visitor&lt;/a&gt;, who arrived on the map inside the meteor. He found the rocket and somehow programmed it to travel through multiple dimensions. After he launched the rocket, he zoomed around the map shooting through what would later be called rifts, in an attempt to escape the island.\n The rocket nearly hit Tilted Towers, before being consumed by a rift. The rocket then emerged nearby &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt;, blasted into the sky, and ultimately formed the &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;Sideways Rift&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeason 5.\nThe Cube.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Cube\"&gt;The Cube&lt;/a&gt; Event happened in the middle of &lt;a href=\"Season%205\"&gt;Season 5&lt;/a&gt; as the season's major event.\nThe event started when lightning shot down from the Rift, which was originally created by the rocket event back in Season 4. It created a giant, purple cube on top of a hill near &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20Palms\"&gt;Paradise Palms&lt;/a&gt;.\nKevin's Journey.\nThe Cube, which the community had come to call Kevin, started to move across the map and would bounce back any player who touched it. It created 6 runes in its wake that were surrounded by low gravity fields, before it finally rolled into Loot Lake and sank down into it. Once this happened, the surface of Loot Lake transformed, becoming a purple substance with the same bouncy properties as the Cube.\nSeason 6.\nThe Floating Island.\nWhen the Cube reached the bottom of Loot Lake, the area surrounding it rose into the air, creating &lt;a href=\"The%20Floating%20Island\"&gt;The Floating Island&lt;/a&gt;. The crater where it had been, now &lt;a href=\"Leaky%20Lake\"&gt;Leaky Lake&lt;/a&gt;, was quickly flooded with water that began spiraling into a vortex at its center - the &lt;a href=\"Zero%20Point\"&gt;Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;. All 6 runes were also transformed into corrupted areas.\nThe Floating Island's Journey.\nThe Floating Island began to move, traveling to the 6 corrupted areas the Cube created in Season 5 in order to gain energy, with Cube Shards growing on the island. When it made its way back to Leaky Lake, the Floating Island exploded, sending the shards across the map. These shards would spawn Cube Fiends, as part of Fortnitemares 2018.\nThe Butterfly Event.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Butterfly%20Event\"&gt;The Butterfly Event&lt;/a&gt; happened in the middle of Season 6 as the season's major event.\nAs players fought the Cube Fiends, the Cube began to leak energy into the Zero Point, cracking in the meantime. After a few days, the cube started to spin and emitted a petrifying white light, splitting apart as a flash of light covered the screen. Once the flash faded, everyone was teleported to &lt;a href=\"The%20In-Between\"&gt;The In-Between&lt;/a&gt;. After floating around for a while, a giant rift formed and took the shape of a giant butterfly, shrinking while moving towards the player. The player stuck out their finger for the butterfly to land on, and with another flash of light, was returned to the island. Leaky Lake, now returned to its original name of Loot Lake, was left in ruins.\nSeason 7.\n&lt;a href=\"New%20Year\"&gt;2019 New Year Live Event&lt;/a&gt;.\nOccurring every hour, a rift from the sky cracked to release a disco ball. The ball drops as the countdown begins, and fireworks are displayed around the island. It ends with one big firework that says 2019 that we celebrated a new year.\nThe Ice Storm.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Storm\"&gt;Ice Storm&lt;/a&gt; Event happened in the middle of &lt;a href=\"Season%207\"&gt;Season 7&lt;/a&gt; as the season's major event. The event was preceded by &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20King%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;The Ice King&lt;/a&gt; casting a spell in an ice sphere over &lt;a href=\"Polar%20Peak\"&gt;Polar Peak&lt;/a&gt; for 3 days. When the event started, The Ice King broke out of the ice ball. He proceeded to make a giant projection of himself which took form over the ocean. He waved his hand back and forwards a few times before casting it forward, with the large projection mimicking his movements. After he cast his hand forward, the entire map is full of snow now.\nShowtime Live Event.\nIn February 2019, there was a live &lt;a href=\"Showtime\"&gt;Marshmello&lt;/a&gt; concert. This concert was roughly 10 minutes long and featured multiple of &lt;a href=\"Marshmello\"&gt;Marshmello's&lt;/a&gt; songs. As the songs cycled, the stadium got different special effects (anti-gravity, skydiving, etc).\nEarthquake Events.\nUpon &lt;a href=\"The%20Prisoner\"&gt;The Prisoner&lt;/a&gt; breaking out of &lt;a href=\"Polar%20Peak\"&gt;Polar Peak&lt;/a&gt; he started to quickly regain his power, and began to channel it throughout the island. Causing mini earthquakes all around, destroying buildings and burning &lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Woods\"&gt;Wailing Woods&lt;/a&gt; in the process leading up to the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Volcano\"&gt;Volcano&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeason 8.\nThe Unvaulting.\n&lt;a href=\"Unvaulting%20Event\"&gt;The Unvaulting Event&lt;/a&gt; (also known as The Nexus Event) was an event that took place on May 4, 2019, near the end of &lt;a href=\"Season%208\"&gt;Season 8&lt;/a&gt; as this season's major event.\nFollowing the events late-Season 8, the vault in Loot Lake opened, but not in every Battle Royale island out there. Players could jump into the vault. Players were then allowed to choose a weapon to unvault. There were 6 options: &lt;a href=\"Bouncer\"&gt;Bouncer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Drum%20Gun\"&gt;Drum Gun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grappler\"&gt;Grappler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Infinity%20Blade\"&gt;Infinity Blade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"X-4%20Stormwing\"&gt;Planes&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tactical%20Submachine%20Gun\"&gt;Tactical SMG&lt;/a&gt;. Many Players chose the Drum Gun to return to the game because its balanced or good weapon in the game, and it promptly was. After the drum gun was unvaulted, players were brought back to the island.\nAfter leaving the In-Between, players were launched into the air. The volcano promptly erupts, destroying half of &lt;a href=\"Retail%20Row\"&gt;Retail Row&lt;/a&gt;, cracking &lt;a href=\"Polar%20Peak\"&gt;Polar Peak&lt;/a&gt;, and destroying &lt;a href=\"Tilted%20Towers\"&gt;Tilted Towers&lt;/a&gt; entirely, but some how the &lt;a href=\"No%20Sweat%20Insurance\"&gt;insurance&lt;/a&gt; building survived, because when season 9 begins, the Tilted Towers is building on future verision.\nSeason 9.\nThe Final Showdown.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Final%20Showdown\"&gt;The Final Showdown&lt;/a&gt; Event was a Fortnite event that took place on July 20, 2019, not near the end of &lt;a href=\"Season%209\"&gt;Season 9&lt;/a&gt; as the season's major event.\nSince releasing the 'Monster Team' banner and the 'Mech Team' banner in the item shop for gifting only, alongside a sign saying 'I \ud83d\udda4' with a picture of &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Mecha&lt;/a&gt;'s head on the sign, the event is assumed to be &lt;a href=\"The%20Monster\"&gt;The Monster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Mecha&lt;/a&gt; (the giant robot at &lt;a href=\"Pressure%20Plant\"&gt;Pressure Plant&lt;/a&gt;) fighting.\nThe Monster appeared outside the Battle Royale map between &lt;a href=\"The%20Block\"&gt;The Block&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lazy%20Lagoon\"&gt;Lazy Lagoon&lt;/a&gt;. It also had shown the Ice King's castle on top of him. The Monster first created a laser beam around the spot, but didn't do any damage to anything. The Monster then tried to open the vault to grab the Zero Point inside. &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Mecha&lt;/a&gt; then started to make it's appearance from Pressure Plant.\nIt first started with Mecha throwing rockets towards the Monster, also completely destroying the Ice King's castle. The monster then shoots his laser beam towards Mecha, knocking it off its feet. Mecha got back up, then ran towards the Monster, and jumped him into the outside river west.\nMecha then made his appearance, thought that he was the winner, and the Monster jumps out and tries to take Mecha down, but Mecha throws him in the water, destroying Mecha's left arm in the process. Then Mecha went to the vault. Staggering, Mecha fell to the ground. Slowly he got back up.\nAt this point, the monster was already back on land. Mecha smashes the vault and grabbed the orb from inside the vault. Mecha then absorbed the power of the &lt;a href=\"Zero%20Point\"&gt;Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, cracking it, then put down the orb. The Monster was about to attack Mecha but Mecha punches the monster, knocking him down.\nMecha then goes to &lt;a href=\"Neo%20Tilted\"&gt;Neo Tilted&lt;/a&gt; and grabs the&lt;a href=\"Statue%20Of%20Singularity\"&gt;Statue of Singularity&lt;/a&gt;, which reveals it to be a &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Of%20Singularity\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;. Then Mecha walked to the Monster, and with a slow-mo scene of the Monster who was about to beam Mecha but then Mecha stabs him mid-air, instantly killing him.\nAs a celebration, Mecha started flossing with his intact arm, creating an emote called &lt;a href=\"No%20Sweat\"&gt;No Sweat&lt;/a&gt;. Then he does the &lt;a href=\"Salute\"&gt;Salute&lt;/a&gt; emote to all the people watching and flies away into the depths of space, unknown where the robot is.\nZero Point Destabilziation Event.\nAfter The Final Showdown, the Zero Point is left exposed and cracked, and so it began to rapidly destabilize during the remaining days of Season 9 until it partially implodes.\nSeason X.\nThe End (Chapter 1).\n&lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28Chapter%201%29\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt; Event happened right at the end of &lt;a href=\"Season%20X\"&gt;Season X&lt;/a&gt;, as the season's major event and the grand finale of Chapter 1. Hence, the name of the event.\nSince Season X was all about celebrating Chapter 1 in its entirety, it only made sense that The Rocket made an appearance for the second time.\nIt started in &lt;a href=\"%20Dusty%20Depot\"&gt; Dusty Depot&lt;/a&gt; with the rocket launching from the warehouse. It then created a rift in the sky, the other rifts brought by &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Zones\"&gt;Rift Zones&lt;/a&gt; cracked some more. The rocket gets out of the rift, moving to all parts of the map.\nLater on, more rockets, which were built by members of &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt;, joined in until one rocket formed a rift for the other rockets to go to.\nThe next rift appeared at the back of the meteor, the rockets moved to the front to create a rift for the rockets to loop through. As the rockets loop around the meteor and move faster, the rift enlarges, and the meteor sucked inside the rift.\nThe last rift appeared on top of Loot Lake, with a laser beam pointing at the sphere and destabilizes it even more. The meteor goes straight for &lt;a href=\"the%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;the Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; as the rockets escape the island.\nThe meteor squishes the sphere-of-influence created by the Zero Point and ends up destroying the frozen area and unfreezing it's explosion. This caused a vortex to completely suck the entire island into an unknown interspacial area, and made a black hole in the process. Other island objects were seen being sucked in, such as the Tomatohead as well as the Battle Bus itself.\nThe game was also sucked into the black hole. Entering the game at any point after the event caused a cutscene to depict the Zero Point's explosion, destroying the lobby and sucking it into a black hole. The black hole ended at 9 AM EST on Tuesday, October 15, and another cutscene (which later transitioned into the gameplay trailer for Chapter 2: Season 1) was played. This cutscene depicts 4 Battle Pass characters (&lt;a href=\"Turk%20vs%20Riptide\"&gt;Turk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Journey%20vs%20Hazard\"&gt;Journey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"8-Ball%20vs%20Scratch\"&gt;8-Ball&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rippley%20vs%20Sludge\"&gt;Rippley&lt;/a&gt;) exploring the new world the Zero Point created, and demonstrating the multiple new features (such as &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt;). The gameplay trailer and a full depiction of what happened after &lt;a href=\"The%20Nothing\"&gt;the blackout&lt;/a&gt; can be found on .\nChapter 2: Season 1.\nLive at Risky Reels.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Live%20At%20Risky\"&gt;Live at Risky Reels&lt;/a&gt; Event is the first Chapter 2 event that happened in &lt;a href=\"Risky%20Reels\"&gt;Risky Reels&lt;/a&gt; on December 14, 2019 at 2:00pm ET.\nThe event starts with an intergalactic space battle to be followed by a spaceship landing at the platform. From there, you can see familiar faces exit the spaceship like Star Wars director J.J. Abrams.\nBefore the event actually starts, the director asks everyone what the scene is about by stepping on the platforms near the stage. Afterwards, the scene is being premiered, it has a length of about 1 minute.\nAfter the scene is done, they ask the players about their favorite lightsaber color, but is interrupted by another battle. Then, the game goes slow-mo and a message from Emperor Palpatine is played as the ships leave the Battle Royale Island and the event ends. However, left behind is a chest that contains a lightsaber, the color of which depends on your vote on the last question. The First Order took control of the Island, but was liberated by the Players after the event ended.\nServers are shut down in order to bring the new features into the game.\n&lt;a href=\"New%20Year\"&gt;2020 New Year Live Event&lt;/a&gt;.\nOccurring every hour, it appears to be the same as the 2019 Live Event from &lt;a href=\"Season%207\"&gt;Season 7&lt;/a&gt;, except the end where it shows 2020 and a better fireworks display.\nChapter 2: Season 2.\nDiplo.\nOn May 1st 2020, Diplo hosted a &lt;a href=\"Major%20Lazer\"&gt;Major Lazer&lt;/a&gt; concert at the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Stage\"&gt;Main Stage&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Party%20Royale\"&gt;Party Royale&lt;/a&gt;.\nTenet Trailer.\nOn May 21 2020, the trailer for the movie Tenet was shown, along with a short interview with John David Washington.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Device\"&gt;The Device&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe event began with voices of &lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt; and his agents around the Agency, just before the countdown hit zero. Once it did, the five hatches around the Agency bubbling up, later being opened and releasing a column with an antenna at the top. After all five columns had been raised, &lt;a href=\"The%20Agency\"&gt;The Agency&lt;/a&gt; blew up and The Doomsday Device rose. Afterward, The Device harvested energy from the column and started to push back the storm while radiating energy away. The Device then cooled down until the storm started going haywire. The player is then sent to &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, inside the office of &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;John Jones&lt;/a&gt;. Outside, people are talking especially a man we can't see very well because of the blinds. There were photos of people on the walls that are similar to ones found in &lt;a href=\"Save%20The%20World\"&gt;Save The World&lt;/a&gt;. On a desk, there were 3 folders with \"Top Secret\" on them, one for &lt;a href=\"Lynx\"&gt;Lynx&lt;/a&gt;, one for &lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt;, and one for &lt;a href=\"Jules\"&gt;Jules&lt;/a&gt;. They are then pulled back into reality before the Doomsday Device starts to push back the storm once more. The electricity surged against the storm, and it looked like it was working.\nThe storm subsided and for a brief moment, the event appeared over. The storm was gone, butterflies flapped around and The Device was pulled back down below &lt;a href=\"The%20Agency\"&gt;The Agency&lt;/a&gt;. As it went under, players' screens began to glitch out before they took a visit to John Jones. When they returned to the island, &lt;a href=\"The%20Wall%20Of%20Water\"&gt;The Wall Of Water&lt;/a&gt; circled The Agency replacing the Storm. Players were sucked into the mysterious office once more to see Jonesy make an appearance in an Agent suit. He presumably is the owner of the office, John Jones. Then, once again players were sucked back into the game, Players now respawned inside the battle bus concluding The Device Event &amp; reopening a whole new storyline.\nChapter 2: Season 3.\nDiplo Presents: Thomas Wesley.\nOn June 26th 2020, Diplo, along with Young Thug and Noah Cyrus hosted a 2nd concert in &lt;a href=\"Party%20Royale\"&gt;Party Royale&lt;/a&gt;.\nWe the People.\nIn Party Royale, an event was held at The Big Screen on July 4th in support of the Black Lives Matter Movement.\nDiplo Presents: Higher Ground.\nDiplo hosted his final concert in Party Royale on July 31st, 2020.\nAncient Astronaut (Challenge Event).\nA spaceship crashed near Craggy Cliffs before Stage 8 of the water receding. When you find all 3 parts and launch the ship, 4 rifts will greet you.\nWe The People X More Than a Vote.\nA 2nd Black Lives Matter movement show was held on July 28th 2020, this time about black voter suppression.\nKenshi Yonezu @ Main Stage.\nOn August 7th 2020, Kenshi Yonezu performed favourites and his new album (Stray Sheep) at the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Stage\"&gt;Main Stage&lt;/a&gt;.\nChapter 2: Season 4.\nLight It Up Like Dynamite: BTS.\nOn September 25th 2020, the popular K-Pop band BTS performed their \"Dynamite\" music video at the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Stage\"&gt;Main Stage&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer%20of%20Worlds\"&gt;The Devourer of Worlds&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer%20of%20Worlds\"&gt;The Devourer of Worlds&lt;/a&gt; was the major event for Chapter 2 Season 4.\nThe event started when &lt;a href=\"Galactus\"&gt;Galactus&lt;/a&gt; rose from the water. He slowly approached until he towered over &lt;a href=\"Helicarrier%2064\"&gt;Helicarrier 64&lt;/a&gt;. He clenched his fists and showed players his wrath. Then, &lt;a href=\"Galactus\"&gt;Galactus&lt;/a&gt; hit the &lt;a href=\"Helicarrier%2064\"&gt;Helicarrier&lt;/a&gt; with the back of his hand, ultimately destroying it and launching all players off it. Just when players thought they would fall off the island, &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Stark\"&gt;Tony Stark&lt;/a&gt; saved them with a &lt;a href=\"Stark%20Industries%20Jetpack\"&gt;Jetpack&lt;/a&gt;.\nGalactus then extracted the &lt;a href=\"Zero%20Point\"&gt;Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; from The Ruins, and absorbed its power. &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; fought back, but it transported players to the In-Between. The players found themselves in an Upgraded Battle Bus, alongside thousands of other Upgraded Battle Buses outside. &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Stark\"&gt;Tony Stark&lt;/a&gt; then asked players to activate their laser cannons.\nAfter a while of obliterating &lt;a href=\"Gorgers\"&gt;Gorgers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Stark\"&gt;Tony Stark&lt;/a&gt; opened a corridor in &lt;a href=\"Galactus\"&gt;Galactus&lt;/a&gt;' arm for the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Bus\"&gt;Battle Bus&lt;/a&gt;es to fly through. The player's &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Bus\"&gt;Battle Bus&lt;/a&gt; then came to a huge circle of &lt;a href=\"Gorgers\"&gt;Gorgers&lt;/a&gt; but &lt;a href=\"Wolverine%20Zero\"&gt;Wolverine&lt;/a&gt; destroyed them all. After travelling through Galactus' arm towards his mouth, all players were evacuated from their &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Bus\"&gt;Battle Bus&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Galactus\"&gt;Galactus&lt;/a&gt; sucked them in. As that happened, the Gamma energy destabilized Galactus.\nA rift then took Galactus away, causing the entire screen to black out.\nA telephone ran and the scene cuts to &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt; where alarms were going off, there was a lot of noise, and &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt; lay unconscious. Players were taken to the &lt;a href=\"To%20Be%20Continued%21\"&gt;To Be Continued!&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt; woke up.\nChapter 2: Season 5.\n&lt;a href=\"New%20Year\"&gt;2021 New Year Live Event&lt;/a&gt;.\nOccurring every hour, it appears to be the same as the 2020 Live Event from , except the end where it shows 2021 and a better fireworks display. Because the rift relashes a disco ball and light on, with means it will count to 10 second and its 0, it celebrates new year that shoots many fireworks and forces players to do the Taco Time emote and shoots a big firework when players stopped dancing, the big firework explodes and shows \"2021\" with llama pi\u00f1ata firework style.\nZero Point Destabilziation Event.\nAbout a week before Season 6, the Zero Point slowly turns purple and pulses every minutes, showing its clear destabilization. The Zero Point destabilizes more and begins sending Reality Waves.\nChapter 2: Season 6.\n&lt;a href=\"Zero%20Crisis%20Finale\"&gt;Zero Crisis Finale&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt; recruits the Player to help him save reality. &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; flies up to and goes inside the unstable Zero Point. As he starts fixing the Zero Point, reality starts breaking apart and portals appear.\nJones starts to close the portals, and succeeds in closing one - This causes a flower blossom to appear in the sky. The Foundation warns them to watch out for Reality Waves. Jones states \"Reality waves can change anything in a blink-\" but is cut off as one occurs. This changes Jones into a Butterfly - a &lt;a href=\"Rift\"&gt;Rift&lt;/a&gt; - and the player turns into Glyph Master &lt;a href=\"Raz\"&gt;Raz&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Looper is told to use Jones' rift device to close all the portals.\nWith the last portal closed, it looks to be completed as a giant flower blossom fills the sky once more. The colours surrounding it are intense. But suddenly, the blossom starts swelling and turning red and black.\nThe Foundation states it's not enough and he needs to contain the blast, so he decides to build a tower of stone leading up to the Zero Point.\nJones teleports the looper and himself to the bottom of this forming tower. They run up the side of it as crystals and rocks come out the ground. They then fly up to a staircase along the tower, and run towards the top.\nAs you reach the top, the butterfly Jones turns back to his normal self. The looper is blasted off the platform to fly and watch as a bystander. &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; says there'll be no other chance, and that Jones needs to overload the Rift Device to seal off the Zero Point.\nJones objects saying \"Overload the device?! I'll be trapped in the loop!\" The Foundation states they'll both have to fight their way back, and that they should not give up. He also says that he will find Jones and that he should tell him everything. Jones says \"You have my word!\" and overloads the device.\nThis seals The Foundation in, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Spire\"&gt;The Spire&lt;/a&gt; is complete.\nChapter 2: Season 7.\nAbduction Warm Up.\nIt was a short live event that took place above &lt;a href=\"Slurpy%20Swamp\"&gt;Slurpy Swamp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Coral%20Castle\"&gt;Coral Castle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Corny%20Complex\"&gt;Corny Complex&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Mothership\"&gt;The Mothership&lt;/a&gt; makes loud noises then its main hatch opens.\nRift Tour.\nRift Tour was a concert featuring &lt;a href=\"Ariana%20Grande\"&gt;Ariana Grande&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after the event, a Ariana Grande Bundle was released in the Item Shop. Celebrate Ariana's run in the Rift Tour with her arrival in the &lt;a href=\"Item%20Shop\"&gt;Item Shop&lt;/a&gt; and Icon Series and a Concert.\nOperation: Sky Fire.\nThirty minutes before the operation begins, &lt;a href=\"the%20Mothership\"&gt;the Mothership&lt;/a&gt; begins to beam up several small fragments of the Battle Royale island. Dr. Slone has secretly planted bombs on each of these islands in hopes that they would be enough to destroy the Mothership once they are beamed in. When the operation begins, the Mothership begins to beam the operation participants on the islands aboard.\nIn a moment's notice, players suddenly come to wearing special backpacks from Dr. Slone and imprisoned in holding cells aboard the ship. Dr. Slone boots up the backpacks and uses them to hack the cell doors open, expressing surprise that she did not anticipate the need to arm the participants. She assures the players that she will help them escape captivity.\nThe freed players then race through the halls of the Mothership, taking care not to draw the attention of patrolling alien troops. Dr. Slone continues to lead the players through the mothership and into the main abduction chamber, going through another transport tube in the process. They finally enter a room with a shallow pool of purple liquid and large glass windows providing a clear view of the bomb-laden island chunks that have just been abducted by the mothership. With the bombs in place, Dr. Slone begins the arming process, but the arming signal is cut off when the windows are suddenly shuttered.\n After a moment of brief darkness, &lt;a href=\"the%20Cube\"&gt;the Cube&lt;/a&gt; suddenly emerges from the pool on the floor, shocking &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt;, who states that she thought the Cube was destroyed for good during &lt;a href=\"Season%206\"&gt;Season 6&lt;/a&gt;. The Cube unleashes powerful blasts of energy to knock out some participants before weaponizing their backpacks, using them to unleash powerful energy waves that disable the cube, rendering it black. Dr. Slone is able to reopen the windows and resume the arming sequence.\nWith the arming sequence successful, the bombs are now set to blow in a few minutes. &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Dr. Slone&lt;/a&gt; praises the Loopers for doing their part, but then proceeds to betray them, suddenly declaring that she will not allow them to leave the ship, leaving them to die along with &lt;a href=\"the%20Cube\"&gt;the Cube&lt;/a&gt; and the aliens.\n As the countdown sequence resumes, players discover that they can reboot the Cube, turning it blue. Doing so causes the platform they're standing to function as an elevator ascending further into the mothership as the countdown continues. The platform emerges in a giant chamber storing thousands of dormant purple cubes.\nThe countdown ends with the entire mothership exploding, causing players to tumble back out into the sky, plummeting back to the island. The protagonist watches as debris and cubes rain down onto the map, causing devastation, before they are hit by a falling &lt;a href=\"Saucer\"&gt;Saucer&lt;/a&gt;.\nChapter 2: Season 8.\nGolden Cube's Journey.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Cube\"&gt;Golden Cube&lt;/a&gt; rolls around the entire island, It visits the Cubes and commences the Awakening event, levitating into the air and charging the cube with an energy beam. This forces the Purple Cube to create six smaller purple cubes around itself. The process also seems to have stimulated the Cube to roll much more frequently, and towards &lt;a href=\"The%20Aftermath\"&gt;The Aftermath&lt;/a&gt;. The smaller cubes also line up behind the main cube and follow it. All of the purple cubes also spread corruption as they roll.\nOn October 12-13, The Golden Cube arrives at The Aftermath, and levitates directly above the area in a similar fashion to The Awakening events. On October 19, all six purple cubes simultaneously reach The Aftermath, and break apart into smaller pieces to form &lt;a href=\"The%20Convergence\"&gt;The Convergence&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe End (Chapter 2).\nThe Chapter 2 Finale (also known as The End) event occurred right at the end of Chapter 2: Season 8, as the season's major event and the grand finale of Chapter 2. Hence, the name of the event.\nThe Blue Cube (a.k.a Blevin) has teleported to Fort Guava, where the Loopers are preparing to fight the Cube Queen. It creates a shield around the fort. The Cube Queen then harnesses the energy from the Golden Cube to open a portal that contains Motherships and more UFOs. Caretakers emerge from portals summoned by The Cube Queen and attack the Loopers.\nThe Last Reality outnumbers the Loopers. On the bridge, below the map, all IO Personnel are told to escape the craft. Slone wakes Jonesy up and prepares to kill him, but The Foundation comes to his rescue and reminds Jonesy of his promise to being him to Geno.\nThe Loopers are brought to the Bridge from a surface bunker entrance and the IO Offices is now tilting horizontally. The Scientist and The Visitor lead us to the center of the ship, where a Caretaker breaks the skylight and floods the bridge. The Loopers wash up far away from the Loop, where the island is tilting to reveal a new one on the Flipside. In the process, The Cube Queen is destroyed along with the portal to The Last Reality. After the island flips, a giant tidal wave crashes into the Loopers, and the game transitions to the &lt;a href=\"Drift%20To%20Artemis\"&gt;Drift To Artemis&lt;/a&gt;.\nChapter 3: Season 1.\n&lt;a href=\"New%20Year\"&gt;2022 New Years Live Event&lt;/a&gt;.\nOccurring every hour, it appears to be the same as the 2021 Live Event from , except the end where it shows 2022. Because the rift relashes a disco ball and light on, with means it will count to 10 second and its 0, it celebrates new year that shoots many fireworks and performs players to do a Boogie Bomb emote and shoots the big firework when payers stopped dancing, big firework explodes and shows \"2022\" with llama pi\u00f1ata firework style.\nChapter 3: Season 2.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Collider%20Energy%20Pulses\"&gt;The Collider Energy Pulses&lt;/a&gt;.\nExactly 2 Weeks before the end of Chapter 3: Season 2: &lt;a href=\"The%20Collider\"&gt;The Collider&lt;/a&gt; sent out its first energy pulse into the sky. After this first pulse the collider pulsed at random times with no pattern. After the third pulse a single notch lit up on the collider. These Energy Blasts continued until &lt;a href=\"Collision\"&gt;Collision&lt;/a&gt; began on June 4th.\n&lt;a href=\"Collision\"&gt;Collision&lt;/a&gt;.\n90 seconds before the event began, &lt;a href=\"The%20Origin\"&gt;The Origin&lt;/a&gt; gave the Loopers a mission briefing. &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt; then enters, and initiates the launch sequence, with the Loopers entering the battle stations. The Mecha heads for &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt;, with Loopers destroying incoming asteroids and &lt;a href=\"Abductors\"&gt;Abductor&lt;/a&gt; debris along the way. The Mecha lands at &lt;a href=\"Synapse%20Station\"&gt;Synapse Station&lt;/a&gt;, only to be greeted by battalions of the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt;'s tanks. A laser strike from &lt;a href=\"The%20Fortress\"&gt;The Fortress&lt;/a&gt; is fired at the Mecha. In a quick time event, the Mecha fires a laser back at The Fortress, destroying the location. As the Mecha continues heading for &lt;a href=\"The%20Collider\"&gt;The Collider&lt;/a&gt;, it is hit by a barrage of missiles coming from &lt;a href=\"IO%20Airships\"&gt;IO Airships&lt;/a&gt;, heavily damaging it. B.R.U.T.Es Begin attacking the Mecha. The Collider's shield is downed. The Mecha pulls out its Light Blade, slashing through the remaining IO Airships. After the final IO vehicles have been destroyed, The Paradigm diverts all power to the Light Blade, and prepares to destroy the Collider. Before this can happen, explosions occurs, and the Mecha falls into the ground below. The Paradigm and the Loopers are ejected from the Mecha. Agent Jones comes to assist the Mecha crew. The Paradigm manages to get the Mecha back online, and as Jones is distracting Slone with a speech, she crushes Slone and her tank with the Mecha's fist, destroying part of the bridge. The Paradigm then begins to lift the Loopers, Jones, and The Foundation upwards towards the top of the Collider, with the latter two jumping into the Zero Point.\nChapter 3: Season 4.\n&lt;a href=\"Fracture\"&gt;Fracture&lt;/a&gt;.\nFracture happened at the end of Chapter 3: Season 4, as the season's major event and the grand finale of Chapter 3. &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; has gone dormant. &lt;a href=\"The%20Herald\"&gt;The Herald&lt;/a&gt; of the Nothing unleashed &lt;a href=\"Chrome\"&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt; over the island, consuming everything in its path to the &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Tree\"&gt;Reality Tree&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"AMIE\"&gt;AMIE&lt;/a&gt; have to come up with a plan to wake the Zero Point up before the inevitable end of reality.\nA group of loopers on the Island build a stronghold on the top of the &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Tree\"&gt;Reality Tree&lt;/a&gt; as a final defense against the power of &lt;a href=\"The%20Herald\"&gt;The Herald&lt;/a&gt;. Several Chrome Vortexes appear, spreading the &lt;a href=\"Chrome\"&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt; across the entire Island. A final Chrome Vortex forms near the Reality Tree, along with &lt;a href=\"The%20Herald\"&gt;The Herald&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the efforts of the loopers to attempt to destroy The Herald, she forms a massive body made of Chrome and fuses with the &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Tree\"&gt;Reality Tree&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in her sacrificing herself, but leading to the nearly complete destruction of both &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;, excluding the &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; finds themselves in space surrounded by several chunks of land remaining after the fracture of the Island. &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, however, manages to tether onto pieces of land, as well as the Looper, and pull them all in to begin the reconstruction of a new island. The loopers begin exploring the lands and completing tasks to collect &lt;a href=\"Zero%20Fragment\"&gt;Zero Fragments&lt;/a&gt; to restore enough power to the Zero Point to pull in more pieces of the island and eventually initiate Zero Fusion. &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; begins to take pieces of land and characters from different realities, including where &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt; was. With enough land, the Zero Point fuses all the land together, creating the new &lt;a href=\"Asteria\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nChapter 4: Season 1.\n&lt;a href=\"New%20Year\"&gt;2023 New Years Live Event&lt;/a&gt;.\nOccurring every hour, it appears to be the same as the 2022 Live Event from , except the end where it shows 2023. Because the rift relashes a disco ball and light on, with means it will count to 10 second and its 0, it celebrates new year that shoots many fireworks and performs players to do a Boogie Bomb emote and shoots the big firework when payers stopped dancing, big firework explodes and shows \"2023\" with llama pi\u00f1ata firework style.\nChapter 4: Season OG.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Bang\"&gt;The Big Bang&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Big Bang happened at the end of Chapter 4: Season OG, as the season's major event and the grand finale of Chapter 4. The inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Asteria\"&gt;Asteria&lt;/a&gt; need to search a new world to escape enemies and it inevitable collapse. &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; has sent &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt; back to &lt;a href=\"Season%205\"&gt;Season 5&lt;/a&gt;, to perform an extraction mission by creating a new &lt;a href=\"Big%20Bang\"&gt;Big Bang&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Omniverse\"&gt;The Omniverse&lt;/a&gt;. Then, the inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Asteria\"&gt;Asteria&lt;/a&gt; can find a new safe reality.\nThe Rocket at Dusty Divot launches into the sky, the Time Machine attached to the rocket causes it to glitch into different objects, such as a shark and a crackshot figure. The rocket then accelerates towards the tail of the meteor, creating a rift behind it. Multiple rockets, presumably the Seven, repeatedly teleport from behind the meteor into a rift infront of the meteor, picking up speed each time. The meteor eventually starts moving, whilst also transforming into different objects. This causes the meteor to dissapear into the rift. Following this, another rift opens up above Loot Lake, the rocket appears from the rift, aiming directly towards the Zero Point. Following the original rocket, the remaining few rockets guide the meteor which is repeatedly transforming towards the Zero Point, causing the meteor to implode the Zero Point, and create a black hole that swallows the entire island. A massive explosion of psychedelic patterns occurs. The player is then shown shooting through Space following a trail of items presumably from a different universe. The player is then shown previews of the upcoming gamemodes, LEGO Fortnite, Rocket Racing, along with an Eminem Concert which serves as a preview for Fortnite Festival. Finally, we get thrown into a space between the galaxies, not far from &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt; reality.\nChapter 5: Season 1.\n&lt;a href=\"New%20Year\"&gt;2024 New Years Live Event&lt;/a&gt;.\nOccurring every hour, it appears to be the same as the 2023 Live Event from , except the end where it shows 2024. Because the rift relashes a disco ball and light on, with means it will count to 10 second and its 0, it celebrates new year that shoots many fireworks and performs players to do a Boogie Bomb emote and shoots the big firework when payers stopped dancing, big firework explodes and shows \"2024\" with llama pi\u00f1ata firework style.\n&lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box%20Opening\"&gt;Pandora's Box Opening&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box%20Opening\"&gt;Pandora's Box Opening&lt;/a&gt; event was a series of events that took place starting from February 27th 2024 and ending on March 3rd 2024, as the season's end live event. It began after a series of &lt;a href=\"Earthquakes%23Chapter%205\"&gt;earthquakes&lt;/a&gt; started occuring near &lt;a href=\"Ruined%20Reels\"&gt;Ruined Reels&lt;/a&gt;, becoming increasingly more and more violent, until &lt;a href=\"Titan%23Lore\"&gt;the hand of a titan&lt;/a&gt; emerged from the ground, carrying &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt; with it.\nPlayers then worked together to destroy the chains binding the Box to the titan's hand. After all the chains were destroyed, it fell to the ground, unleashing it's contents upon the Island.\nChapter 5: Season 2.\n&lt;a href=\"Sandstorm%20Event\"&gt;Sandstorm Event&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sandstorm%20Event\"&gt;Sandstorm Event&lt;/a&gt; was a series of events that took place starting from May 13th 2024 and ending on May 23rd 2024, as the season's end live event. It began at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Mount Olympus&lt;/a&gt;, as the clouds surrounding the statue began to darken. Coming to life, the statue raised it's swordarm and struck Pandora's Box with lightning several times over the course of a few days.\nOn the final strike, the Box surged with red lightning and burst open, sending all players into the sky. Some unseen and powerful force was released from the Box, bounding across the Island and across the southern ocean, crashing onto a nearby island and releasing a huge sandstorm. During this time, Pandora's Box slowly sank into the &lt;a href=\"River%20Styx\"&gt;River Styx&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver the next few days, the sandstorm began creeping closer and closer to the Island from across the ocean, signaling the eventual arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Wasteland%20Warriors\"&gt;Wasteland Warriors&lt;/a&gt;.\nChapter 5: Season 3.\n&lt;a href=\"Refinery%20Event\"&gt;Refinery Event&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Refinery%20Event\"&gt;Refinery Event&lt;/a&gt; was an event that took place on August 10th 2024, as the season's end live event. &lt;a href=\"Megalo%20Don%23Lore\"&gt;Megalo Don#Lore&lt;/a&gt;, intent on razing the Island to the ground with his &lt;a href=\"Brutal%20Beachhead\"&gt;Leviathan&lt;/a&gt;, began fueling it with &lt;a href=\"Nitro\"&gt;Nitro&lt;/a&gt; supplied from the pipeline to &lt;a href=\"Redline%20Rig\"&gt;Redline Rig&lt;/a&gt;. \nAs the tank filled, the process was disrupted by &lt;a href=\"Doom%23Lore\"&gt;The Wanderer&lt;/a&gt;. The Nitro within the pipeline began to combust, creating a series of explosions all the way back to Redline Rig, causing a massive detonation at the site. \nAs the smoke cleared, a large crater was left in it's wake, uncovering &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt; beneath it.\nChapter 5: Season 4.\n&lt;a href=\"Absolute%20Doom%20Event\"&gt;Absolute Doom Event&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Absolute%20Doom%20Event\"&gt;Absolute Doom Event&lt;/a&gt; took place on October 5th 2024. &lt;a href=\"Hope%23Lore\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; signaled the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Beacons\"&gt;Rift Beacons&lt;/a&gt; to attack the large smoke tower neighboring &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Doom\"&gt;Castle Doom&lt;/a&gt;, but the attack enraged &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt;, who then arrived onto the Island enlarged and empowered by a new set of armor he forged to contain the power of &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt;. Doom begins his attack on the heroes and nearly kills &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt;, but he is saved by Hope, who manages to damage Doom's mask with &lt;a href=\"Captain%20America%27s%20Shield\"&gt;Captain America's Shield&lt;/a&gt;. Doing this however scarred her right arm.\nA battle between Doom and the players began in the shallow lake where &lt;a href=\"Shipwreck%20Shallows\"&gt;Shipwreck Shallows&lt;/a&gt; once stood; it is not possible for players to significantly damage each other while in Doom's vicinity. As the players continued attacking Doom, Hope rifted in weapons and ammunition as she prepared another Rift Beacon to target Doom. After Doom is significantly weakened, the Rift Beacon entraps him and sends him away to another reality, while leaving his mask behind in the lake.\n was the concluding live event for Chapter 5: Season 4, and took place on November 1st 2024.\nA Rift Butterfly appeared at &lt;a href=\"Restored%20Reels\"&gt;Restored Reels&lt;/a&gt; and merged the Island with New York City, with the screen serving as a peephole into Times Square in the real world. Ice Spice and Snoop Dogg emerged on a stage to perform a medley of their hits; as the concert progressed, Snoop's actions also began affecting the Fortnite Island in-game. \nAs the concert came to a close, the Rift Butterfly produced a blinding light as it sent players back to the &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Chapter 2 Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nChapter 2 Remix.\n was the concluding live event for Chapter 2 Remix, and Chapter 5 as a whole, and took place on November 30th 2024.\nSnoop Dogg, Eminem, Slim Shady, Ice Spice, Travis Scott, and Juice WRLD came together to put on a massive cosmic concert with the Rift Butterflies, which damaged part of the Apollo Island. Following the concert, a Rift Butterfly helped evacuate the Looper to a Japan-inspired Island, where they rendezvous with Hope and Jones. A mysterious object follows them from behind and crash lands on the surface of the new Island.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Likewise, seeing how successful Eminem had been, Ice Spice creates her &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Isle\"&gt;Ice Isle&lt;/a&gt; location, a neon-lit mall with an ominous aura.\nNear the end of the season, the legend, Juice WRLD himself, finally showed up as a giant in the sky next to The Rig. Through special waves caused by his godlike power, he transforms a part the Island's coast into &lt;a href=\"WRLD%27s%20Point\"&gt;WRLD's Point&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Bloom%20Biome\"&gt;reality bloom&lt;/a&gt; biome playing &lt;a href=\"Lucid%20Dreams\"&gt;Lucid Dreams&lt;/a&gt; music. WRLD's Point, albeit small, thrives with &lt;a href=\"Bouncy%20Slurpshrooms\"&gt;Bouncy Slurpshrooms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Butterfly\"&gt;Rift Butterflies&lt;/a&gt;, and regular &lt;a href=\"Rift\"&gt;rifts&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt; emerges on the Island, it alongside all clouds around him dissipate, allowing the Island to retain full view of Juice WRLD's giant form.\nA few days later, the special waves had caused the WRLD's Point biome to spread a little bit further, and with it, the Lucid Dreams beat shifted, and Juice WRLD himself can now be seen with his right hand up to his chest, closed, but with a glowing blue aura surrounding it, as if he's holding something. Finally, the glow around his hand brightens as the biome completes its growth and the background music shifts to include his song \"Empty Out Your Pockets\". The beings from his album, \"The Party Never Ends\" surround Juice.\nDuring , Snoop Dogg activated his version of &lt;a href=\"The%20Device\"&gt;The Device&lt;/a&gt;. His device acted as a microphone for Snoop. During his performance, &lt;a href=\"LBC%20%2793%20Dogg\"&gt;LBC '93 Dogg&lt;/a&gt; would teleport onto the Island to perform and send the audience into space. Each rapper was in a giant form, or became one in Ice Spice's case, in an effort to perform a grand show. Next up, Eminem faced off and won against a version of himself that was disguised as &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Mecha Team Leader&lt;/a&gt;, whom had rockets built-in for combat. Ice Spice performed in a city far away from the Island with an appearance from &lt;a href=\"Travis%20Scott\"&gt;Travis Scott&lt;/a&gt;. Lastly, when Juice WRLD performed, his audience was transformed into a Rift Butterfly for a short time, able to fly around and enjoy his songs. At the end of Snoop's Enterprise's concert, &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vengeance%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; were rifted to the &lt;a href=\"Oninoshima\"&gt;Oninoshima&lt;/a&gt; Island inside of alongside a shard of &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;."}

It uses the standard set of rules, meaning there are 100 players who all compete to obtain a &lt;a href=\"Victory%20Royale\"&gt;Victory Royale&lt;/a&gt;. In this mode, the player does not have any other squad members, and must fight alone. Due to this, reviving and rebooting is not possible, eliminating the player immediately.\nSolo follows the basic rule-set of Battle Royale:\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Doctor Doom, prior to the fight against Galactus, set up base at Pleasant Park, turning it into &lt;a href=\"Doom%27s%20Domain\"&gt;Doom's Domain&lt;/a&gt; and brought along his &lt;a href=\"Doom%20Henchmen\"&gt;Doom Henchmen&lt;/a&gt; to guard it.\nThe Kingdom of Doom's ruler, Doom himself, was recruited into the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt;'s Inner Circle by their leader, &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt; to stop &lt;a href=\"The%20Resistance\"&gt;The Resistance&lt;/a&gt;.

After his failure, he returns to the Island, betrays the Imagined Order, kills &lt;a href=\"Gunnar\"&gt;Gunnar&lt;/a&gt; with a weapon of the Ice King, and returns to Latveria with the knowledge of the Imagined Order and aims to start his own kingdom of perfect order.\nDoom arrived on the Island, disguising himself in a white cloak and used his powers to completely conceal his face and body, where he was called The Wanderer. He introduced himself to Megalo Don as an ally who shared common interests with him. Advising Megalo Don for his plans, he quickly gained his trust and had him build a Pipeline connecting &lt;a href=\"Redline%20Rig\"&gt;Redline Rig&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Brutal%20Beachhead\"&gt;The Leviathan&lt;/a&gt; so he could fuel his Leviathan with Nitro and raze The Island. Doom also wandered on The Island and and observed people for unspecified purposes. However, once &lt;a href=\"Megalo%20Don\"&gt;Megalo Don&lt;/a&gt;'s pipeline created by &lt;a href=\"The%20Machinist\"&gt;The Machinist&lt;/a&gt; was completed and that Megalo Don's plans were about to be enacted, Doom betrayed &lt;a href=\"Megalo%20Don\"&gt;Megalo Don&lt;/a&gt;, hacking the pipeline system and blowing it up, causing &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt; to resurface. He then went to absorb the power of the box.\nDoom quickly takesover the Island, bringing &lt;a href=\"Doomstadt\"&gt;Doomstadt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Doom\"&gt;Castle Doom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Raft\"&gt;The Raft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Doom%27s%20Courtyard\"&gt;Doom's Courtyard&lt;/a&gt; to the Island. Following this, riots and protests break out but Doom brainwashes people into loving him by using his \"Victor von Scoops\" ice cream. He takes quick care of &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Amarvel%3AFantastic%20Four%20%28Earth-616%29\"&gt;Fantastic Four&lt;/a&gt;, his former arch-enemies and proudly displays them in his castle, transforming Mr Fantatic into a rubber band ball, displaying Invisible Women's deceased body in a glass case, using Human Torch's heart to power his fireplace and transforming The Thing into his throne at &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Doom\"&gt;Castle Doom&lt;/a&gt;. Doctor Doom also defeated several people from : Human Torch, Invisible Woman, Mr. Fantastic, The Thing, Ultron, Namor, &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Knight\"&gt;Moon Knight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thanos\"&gt;Thanos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Strange\"&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Surfer\"&gt;Silver Surfer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wastelander%20Magneto\"&gt;Magneto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Panther\"&gt;Black Panther&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Stark\"&gt;Tony Stark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thor\"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Galactus\"&gt;Galactus&lt;/a&gt;, with most of them being dead. Doom \"got rid\" of his former ally &lt;a href=\"Megalo%20Don\"&gt;Megalo Don&lt;/a&gt;. Despite his accomplishments, he feels empty and a vacant hunger due to the Box. He wants to wield it again, but its power is too chaotic and uncontrolled, meaning that he won't be able to harness it properly until he prepares himself by improving his armor. Before quickly disappearing from the public eye, Doom gives control over Castle Doom to one of his &lt;a href=\"Doombot\"&gt;Doombots&lt;/a&gt; and orders his henchmen to dig around the Island for artifacts. Doom goes into hiding until he can control his powers more effectively through his armor.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Oracle\"&gt;The Oracle&lt;/a&gt;'s \"feline ally\", &lt;a href=\"Shuri\"&gt;Shuri&lt;/a&gt;, visits Jones and informs him of a plan to get rid of Doom after he had nearly killed the former &lt;a href=\"Black%20Panther\"&gt;Black Panther&lt;/a&gt;. The Kingdom of Doom is threatened by Shuri's attempts to reverse the energetic flow of &lt;a href=\"Wastelander%20Magneto\"&gt;Magneto&lt;/a&gt;'s rift beacons with Rift Recalibrators, capable of rifting all of them out of the Island. The Underground opened the way for The Looper to confront Doombot at &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Doom\"&gt;Castle Doom&lt;/a&gt; and Rift it away however, it didn't worked as &lt;a href=\"Emma%20Frost\"&gt;Emma Frost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mysterio\"&gt;Mysterio&lt;/a&gt; sabotaged Shuri's rift beacons after making Doom aware of this. This forced The Looper to destroy Doombot, before hearing Doom's voice threatening Hope with the ideology that while she may be \"prophecy\", he is \"judgement\". He then add that he eagerly awaits Hope's attempt at trying to take him down in the future. Before The Looper end being being confronted by an army of Doombots acting like loopers as well as Doom's Chosen. Doom now fully perfected his Pandora armor and plans to make his grand entrance when the time is right until then, realizing he cannot seize the greatness of perfection just yet, Doom orders &lt;a href=\"Mysterio\"&gt;Mysterio&lt;/a&gt; to use his illusory conjurings to give the people of Latveria the illusion of perfection. &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;, along with Jones and The Looper freed the minds of the Wastelanders and the inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Doomstadt\"&gt;Doomstadt&lt;/a&gt; and went to take down Mysterio, defeating him and and freeing Doomstadt. Now &lt;a href=\"Emma%20Frost\"&gt;Emma Frost&lt;/a&gt; is up to the challenge of stopping &lt;a href=\"The%20Underground\"&gt;The Underground&lt;/a&gt;'s forces, as Shuri has already begun creating replacement Rift Recalibrators. \nIron Man, now fully recovered to health, joins The Underground and give his tech to them and The Looper. In an effort to take down Emma Frost, so he starts creating power dampeners to reduce Emma's psychic influence that he gave to Hope, while The Looper was sent with their new gear to fly over Castle Doom to check the Rift Recalibrators signal. Later, as Doom's Hechmen began to recover the Arcane Artifacts, which are fragments of Pandora's Box that Doom wants to use for his new armor, all over the Island, &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom's Chosen&lt;/a&gt; emerged to collect them and bring them to Doom. These six artifacts being intended to complete Doom's Pandora's armor, triggering a great battle between heroes and villains dubbed as the \"&lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20Doom\"&gt;Day of Doom&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAt Hope's request, mission details have been encrypted and classified and instructions have been hidden for &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; on the Island. After The Looper found the phone, they got a call from Hope on a securised channel and she told them the plan: using the Stark Power Dampeners to reduce Emma's psychic powers and then launch an assault against her. The Looper first used forecast towers to locate Emma Frost's operatives and learned they were already looking for them. Then they hired a specialist on order to make sure everything was good to place the power dampeners around &lt;a href=\"The%20Raft\"&gt;The Raft&lt;/a&gt;. Once done, Hope switched The Looper back to the main communication channel and was intending to coordinate an attack along with Jones and the other allies. However Rift Recalibrators detected &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt;'s signal, and he was heading toward &lt;a href=\"The%20Raft\"&gt;The Raft&lt;/a&gt; meaning he finished his new armor. Jones warned Hope about this, but was caught in a moment of panic forcing The Looper to face Emma Frost alone, but they managed to defeat her.\n&lt;a href=\"Absolute%20Doom%20Event\"&gt;Absolute Doom Event&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Tony%20Stark\"&gt;Tony Stark&lt;/a&gt; had set up beacons aimed at &lt;a href=\"Doom%27s%20Arcane%20Forge\"&gt;Doom's Arcane Forge&lt;/a&gt;. Loopers who side with Hope, along with The Underground, The Avengers, and the X-Men, unite in an effort to rift both the Arcane Forge and Doom out of this reality. However, their plan falters as Doom shields his Arcane Forge, rendering the beams ineffective. Upon &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt;'s arrival, all but one of the rift beacons scatter to &lt;a href=\"Brawler%27s%20Battleground\"&gt;Brawler's Battleground&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Glacier\"&gt;Grand Glacier&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Restored%20Reels\"&gt;Restored Reels&lt;/a&gt;. Doom then arrives on the battlefield and launches devastating attacks that kill several Loopers, with one that nearly kills &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Jones\"&gt;Captain Jones&lt;/a&gt;\u2014until &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; intervenes to save his life. Using Jones's vibranium shield, she absorbed Doom's Pandora magic, enabling her to strike Doom's right eye, injuring him and damaging his armor. This enabled a new weak point that suppressed Doom's physical immunity and a long fight began, trying to weaken Doom as much as possible to be able to rift him out of the Reality. After a hard fight and many looper casualties, the Island's heroes managed to weaken Doom enough to activate the final rift beacon, pulling out of Doom the energy of Pandora's Box, which went into the rift, before Doom himself was pulled into it. All that remains of the war is Doom's mask where he once stood. Ever since &lt;a href=\"The%20Underground\"&gt;The Underground&lt;/a&gt; had won their fight against Doom, The Kingdom stopped posing a massive threat, and Hope allowed her people to rebuild their &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt; into a stable state after all the threats they've faced.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nMonitor Screens.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

They were introduced in .\nBehavior.\nKlombos would slowly move across the map. Players could stand on top of one and it moves along with it. Klombos could have been fed with &lt;a href=\"Foraged%20Items\"&gt;Klomberries&lt;/a&gt;, which will sometimes make it shoot an item out of its blowhole on the back of its head. This item will bounce a few times before stopping. Standing on the blowhole would launch the player very high into the air, and initiate &lt;a href=\"Glider%20Redeploy\"&gt;Glider Redeploy&lt;/a&gt;. Klombos would eat up to two Klomberries at a time. Klombos would consume all loot they stumble upon and destroy all structures they go through. When a player is near a calm Klombo, soothing music plays.\nKlombos could not be eliminated, but Klombos can take damage and all damage sources only deal 1 damage per attack. After taking 10 damage, it will become hostile for 30 seconds.\nAttacks.\nAttacking a Klombo would cause it to become aggressive and the music becomes more similar to a boss battle (like Gunnar or The Foundation). Klombos will rear onto their hind legs, before shooting a ball of damaging acid at the player, or charging and stomping on them if they are close enough. \nKlombos deal 15 damage on an Acid Ball attack, and 20 on a Stomp Attack.\nLocation.\nKlombos have several set spawn locations around the map.\nHistory.\n=Lore=\nKlombo is a species of a herbivore dinosaur-like creature traveling &lt;a href=\"The%20Omniverse\"&gt;The Omniverse&lt;/a&gt;. They are native to Lost Isles' reality and used to inhabit &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt; at one point before the between IO and the Seven broke out. After a long period of time, during an unspecified event, parts of Lost Isles arrived in &lt;a href=\"LEGO%20Reality\"&gt;LEGO Reality&lt;/a&gt; and Klombos now live there.\nHistory.\nKlombos can be found on &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt; island. They were hibernating in the snow during the winters. They woke up and started to roam around the island. They will consume anything that &lt;a href=\"Loopers\"&gt;Loopers&lt;/a&gt; bought for them.\nKlombos have disappeared.\nA Klombo skull can be found near &lt;a href=\"Behemoth%20Bridge\"&gt;Behemoth Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Haven\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that they all have rifted away somewhere.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Oracle\"&gt;The Oracle&lt;/a&gt; mentioned Klombo in one of her weird analogy.\n&lt;a href=\"LEGO%20Fortnite\"&gt;LEGO Fortnite&lt;/a&gt;.\n arrived in LEGO Reality in preparation for the big Klombo migration.\nReferences.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

It was introduced in . \nDescription.\nThe Prevalent is an urban sedan. As such, it has 4 tires and 4 seats, as well as 4 windows, a windshield and a rear windshield. It's a car of average speed with standard fuel consumption, but it suffers greatly on unsuited terrain and goes much faster on road.\nThe Prevalent has a decent drifting, but it's only useful at high velocities, otherwise the vehicle won't be able to quickly turn, unlike the Whiplash or the Nitro Drifter. It features no kind of boost and all its variants have 800HP. Once the health bar has been emptied, the vehicle will enter a death state and then explode, turning into a wreckage and starting a &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;. If damaged, its glass panels, tires or health bar can be restored through a &lt;a href=\"Repair%20Torch\"&gt;Repair Torch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Campfire\"&gt;Campfires&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Chrome\"&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike all cars, it can connect to &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations\"&gt;Radio Stations&lt;/a&gt; and play a honk, and is moddable with &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Modification\"&gt;vehicle mods&lt;/a&gt;.\nVariants.\nThe Prevalent has 3 variations."}

Cosmetics in the Featured section were usually either new or were of high-value. The section was usually dominated by Outfits, which almost always costed 1,200 V-Bucks or more.\nDaily.\nThe Daily section featured items that frequently returned to the item shop, and items of low value. Featured cosmetics could appear in the daily section next time they rotated into the shop. The Daily section was usually the place where &lt;a href=\"Emotes\"&gt;Emotes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lobby%20Music\"&gt;Lobby Music&lt;/a&gt; were found.\nSpecial Offers.\nBefore the Item Shop UI update of , collaboration items or items that were staying beyond 24 hours would appear in the Special Offers section. The section could contain a variety of items and outfits of various prices.\nCommunity Choice.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Season%20X\"&gt;Season X&lt;/a&gt; and , various community choice events were held. This gave the community 24 hours (previously 48 hours) to vote between a selection of 3 &lt;a href=\"Outfits\"&gt;Outfits&lt;/a&gt; to decide which one will return or release first. After winning the vote, the outfit (and usually its set) would be available in the item shop the next day.\nRefund Policy.\n&lt;br&gt;\nUpon buying an item from the Item Shop, you can refund that item within 24 hours of purchasing it. If the 24-hour period ends or you enter a match with the item, then you can only refund it with a &lt;a href=\"Refund%20Ticket\"&gt;Refund Ticket&lt;/a&gt; within 30 Days.\nSupport-A-Creator.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Support-A-Creator\"&gt;Support-A-Creator&lt;/a&gt; is a program that allows users to support content creators when purchasing certain items in-game. To enter a code, go to the Item Shop tab, enter the Code, and submit. Afterwards, a small portion of money made from the Item Shop and Battle Pass will go to the creator. The code expires after two weeks, so be sure to re-enter the code.\nServer Downtime/Shutdown, What Happens?\n&lt;br&gt;\nDuring Server Downtime, the Item Shop is not accessible in-game, usually as the game itself is not accessible, but it is still accessible &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.fortnite.com/shop\"&gt;Online&lt;/a&gt;. If server downtime takes place during, or exceeds, Item Shop refresh time, the Item Shop will still refresh as normal.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nItem Shop Backgrounds Timeline.\nOn special occasions, the Item Shop will undergo a change in its background. This happens when there is a collaboration or important event.\nSince the introduction of the new Item Shop design in the middle of , different backgrounds are used for different tabs.\nUnused Backgrounds.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

It caused the appearance of the &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;Crack&lt;/a&gt;. This was the first In-Game event in the history of Battle Royale.\nLead-up.\nThe \"Blast Off\" event was foreshadowed for a while before it happened:\nEvent Summary.\nThe Launch happened on June 30th 2018 at 10:30 AM PST and concluded after a couple of minutes. \nThe Rocket Launched into the sky at a slow rate, until the first booster broke off, falling onto some crops in &lt;a href=\"Anarchy%20Acres\"&gt;Anarchy Acres&lt;/a&gt;. The Rocket then started to jet into the sky, until it became a distant glowing blue light. \nAll of a sudden, The Visitor could have been heard saying '&lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; Oscillator on, Setting coordinates. Engaging quantum field accelerator.'&lt;br&gt; As the Rocket headed back down to the Island, 4 red beams shout out the top of the rocket, merging into one giant beam that pointed straight at &lt;a href=\"Tilted%20Towers\"&gt;Tilted Towers&lt;/a&gt;. \nRight before it hit, a rift took the Rocket away. A few seconds later, another rift opened above Moisty Mire. The rocket then continued to rocket forwards as it passed over &lt;a href=\"Lonely%20Lodge\"&gt;Lonely Lodge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Woods\"&gt;Wailing Woods&lt;/a&gt;, then swerving over &lt;a href=\"Risky%20Reels\"&gt;Risky Reels&lt;/a&gt;, Loot Lake and past &lt;a href=\"Tilted%20Towers\"&gt;Tilted Towers&lt;/a&gt;, before it tore another Rift, this time outside &lt;a href=\"Greasy%20Grove\"&gt;Greasy Grove&lt;/a&gt;. \nA larger rift then formed over &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt;, shooting the Rocket out with great acceleration. The rocket hit the sky, opening a massive &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;Sideways Rift&lt;/a&gt; that would later be known as the \"Crack in the Sky\". It stayed there until mid-&lt;a href=\"Season%205\"&gt;Season 5&lt;/a&gt;, and finally closed with the creation of the first &lt;a href=\"Cubes\"&gt;Cube&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath.\nThe Blast Off event led to a multitude of events until &lt;a href=\"Season%206\"&gt;Season 6&lt;/a&gt;. Things from the Fortnite world started to disappear and appear.\nMost famously, the Durrr Burger disappeared live and surprisingly appeared in the real world, in a remote part of the California desert, only to be tagged with graffiti by &lt;a href=\"Drift\"&gt;Drift&lt;/a&gt;. It then reappeared in Fortnite outside of &lt;a href=\"Pleasant%20Park\"&gt;Pleasant Park&lt;/a&gt; at the start of Season 5. \nOn August 24th 2018, The Crack finally closed and spawned &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube\"&gt;The Cube&lt;/a&gt; on top of a hill near &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20Palms\"&gt;Paradise Palms&lt;/a&gt;. This led up to &lt;a href=\"Season%206\"&gt;Season 6&lt;/a&gt;, as the Cube travelled across the island, leaving runes in the ground, until entering Loot Lake.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%20X\"&gt;Season X&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the final season of Chapter 1, another Rocket was made for \u201c&lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28Chapter%201%29\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt;\u201d event. This caused everything to be sucked into a Black Hole, due to &lt;a href=\"The%20Meteor\"&gt;The Meteor&lt;/a&gt; crashing into the &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Rocket has been the basis for the first and last live events of Chapter 1.\nChapter 3.\nThe Rocket, or at least it's model, would be reused several more times during as recon rockets for &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt; sent into space for various tasks.\nAudio.\n class=\"article-table\"\n!Audio\n!Subtitle\nZero Point Oscillator on, Setting coordinates.

Players could also spawn friendly or hostile bots in &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Lab\"&gt;Battle Lab&lt;/a&gt; prior to its removal. Bots were introduced in with Skill Based Matchmaking.\nIn , Bots are known as Target Bots, which can be added onto a creator's custom made Battle Royale island using &lt;a href=\"Creative%20Royale\"&gt;Creative Royale&lt;/a&gt;.\nFunctionality.\nBots have abilities that are similar to a low skilled player. They will pick up weapons and items, and harvest materials. However, their actions will make them identifiable as Bots, such as usually inaccurate aim, but immense detection range as they can start shooting at you from very far away so long as they have direct line of sight. Their usernames are randomly generated, often having two words followed by a 1 or 2 digit number (Example: KittyCat80).\nBots will not perform these actions: \nIn team based game modes, Bots will team up only with other Bots and never team up with human players.\nAs a result of their low skilled gameplay, Bots or Bot teams rarely make the late game and nearly impossible for them to earn a &lt;a href=\"Victory%20Royale\"&gt;Victory Royale&lt;/a&gt;.\nBots are most commonly found when matchmaking on or with a user who is on Mobile or Nintendo Switch, as the game considers them low skilled and fills lobbies with excess Bots, to compensate the harder controls on those platforms. In times where a server may experience low player counts, such as the overnight hours (Midnight to 5 AM local time), can have matches filled with more Bots than usual. \n&lt;a href=\"Skill%20Based%20Matchmaking\"&gt;Skill Based Matchmaking&lt;/a&gt; will put new and low skilled players on lobbies filled with bots (about half or more of the lobby are bots). As players improve their skill, the following matches there will be less bots spawned. In Squads, Skill Based Matchmaking does not take effect, so players will be in lobbies with bots regardless of skill level.\nBots are never found in &lt;a href=\"Limited%20Time%20Modes\"&gt;LTMs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Team%20Rumble\"&gt;Team Rumble&lt;/a&gt;, or matches.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Lab\"&gt;Battle Lab&lt;/a&gt; was removed, players could spawn bots for training purposes using Friendly and Enemy &lt;a href=\"Bot%20Grenades\"&gt;Bot Grenades&lt;/a&gt;. These bots would act very similar to bots found in normal Battle Royale playlists, but would only use &lt;a href=\"Recruits\"&gt;Recruit Outfits&lt;/a&gt;. They appeared to have more accurate aim than regular Bots. When playing a public Battle Lab, about 20 or more Bots could spawn. Battle Lab Bots had a different set of usernames, using the name of the Recruit Outfit and a three digit number.\nCosmetics.\nBots will use a set number of &lt;a href=\"Cosmetic%20Items\"&gt;cosmetics&lt;/a&gt;, ranging from &lt;a href=\"Recruit%20Outfits\"&gt;Recruit Outfits&lt;/a&gt; to even in rare ocassions &lt;a href=\"Unreleased%20Cosmetics\"&gt;Unreleased Cosmetics&lt;/a&gt;. This choice of cosmetics is random, Bots may use the cosmetics from the same set or from a different set. There can not be Bots with identical cosmetics in the same lobby (Outfits are excluded from this). The amount of cosmetics bots can use increases every season, or sometimes between major updates. \nBots do not apply &lt;a href=\"Wraps\"&gt;Wraps&lt;/a&gt; on their weapons. Bots will typically only perform &lt;a href=\"Emotes\"&gt;Emotes&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Spawn%20Island\"&gt;Spawn Island&lt;/a&gt;, though they can also randomly emote when there is no one nearby and they get an elimination.\n\"As of Chapter 5: Season 4 (v31.30)\"\nTrivia.\nUsername Trivia.\nSome Bot usernames are a reference to &lt;a href=\"Community%20Terminology\"&gt;popular terms by the community&lt;/a&gt;.

The Foundation, The Scientist, Iron Man, and The Paradigm repaired and improved it while another team managed to recover the Zero Shard, in order to power it.\nThis version is far more powerful than its original counterpart, having many more weapons such as lasers and miniguns as well as a regeneration system. Additionally, unlike its original counterpart, the weapons seem to have infinite uses. In return, many more pilots are needed to manage the weapons, the different systems of the Mecha as well as its integrity, therefore a total of nine pilots are needed.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Collision\"&gt;Collision&lt;/a&gt;.\nA team of pilots, including The Looper are called upon by &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt; to operate the Mecha, with &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt; being the pilot. The five of them control the Mecha in the ultimate battle against &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; to prevent the use of &lt;a href=\"The%20Collider\"&gt;The Collider&lt;/a&gt;, and to save &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt; from decimation. The Mecha leaves from the Ice Moon outside of &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;the Island&lt;/a&gt; and, after flying through space past asteroids and a destroyed &lt;a href=\"Abductors\"&gt;Abductor&lt;/a&gt;, touches down at &lt;a href=\"Synapse%20Station\"&gt;Synapse Station&lt;/a&gt;. From there, the Mecha begins a steady path towards The Collider, destroying &lt;a href=\"Titan%20Tank\"&gt;Titan Tanks&lt;/a&gt;, shields surrounding &lt;a href=\"IO%20Outposts\"&gt;IO Outposts&lt;/a&gt;, and IO Drills. &lt;a href=\"The%20Fortress\"&gt;The Fortress&lt;/a&gt; charges up a laser strike and attacks the Mecha, but is able to tank the attack. The Paradigm orders a power diversion to the \"Heartbreaker\" attack, and unleashes it upon The Fortress, destroying it. The Mecha continues its path towards The Collider, now destroying incoming missiles in addition to the IO paraphernalia before, until an entourage of missiles launched from a fleet of &lt;a href=\"IO%20Airships\"&gt;IO Airships&lt;/a&gt; nearly takes down the Mecha.\nAfter recovering its armor due to the efforts of &lt;a href=\"Peely\"&gt;Peely&lt;/a&gt;, it begins to destroy the airships with its Light Sword and incoming &lt;a href=\"B.R.U.T.E.\"&gt;B.R.U.T.E.s&lt;/a&gt; with the gunners' weaponry, all while steadily nearing The Collider. Finally, after eliminating all of the Imagined Order ground forces and reaching The Collider, the Mecha lifts the sword, about to strike, when a sudden seismic shift in the ground around it sends it crashing into a newly opened chasm below, where Doctor Slone lays waiting. \nAs the Mecha lay in rubble, The Paradigm begins to try and get it charged up again, while her other operators proceed on foot to eliminate IO forces. Gradually, enough power becomes restored where The Paradigm can operate it by herself. The Mecha raises its left fist above an unsuspecting Doctor Slone, and while she sits in her tank, the Mecha crushes Slone and her tank, plummeting them into the debris and rubble below. The Mecha then gathers its other operators onto said hand to raise them enough to destroy the crystals meant to detonate The Zero Point. Once they are destroyed, the Mecha cups the other operators in both hands, shielding them from The Collider exploding apart, and the event ends.\n&lt;a href=\"Fracture\"&gt;Fracture&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Arm and a part of it arm plate is seen flowing in space.\nLore Trivia.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

She has a hard time trusting Gods that try to help her with her cause. She has embraced her Gorgon curse and calls it a \"gift\" that allows her to stand against the Gods.\nTimeline.\nBefore Chapter 5.\nLong ago, Medusa tried to stand up against the Gods but ended up getting cursed by them, turning into a Gorgon. All she had, including her \"trinkets\", were taken from her and Perseus was sent to slay her. Instead, they became friends and Perseus saved her life in an unknown situation. The Gods then spread myths of Medusa dying in the hands of Perseus. She then seeks vengeance to end &lt;a href=\"The%20Pantheon\"&gt;The Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; and the Gods\u2019 rule.\nFollowing the Gods' arrival on &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt;, Medusa followed them.\nTowards the end of the season, Medusa contacted &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; to take down &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; once and for all, destroying hourglasses that weakened The King and destroyed his sources of immortality, alongside recovering some artifacts thanks also to the help of &lt;a href=\"The%20Oracle\"&gt;The Oracle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vengeance%20Jones\"&gt;Vengeance Jones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;. This opened the way for both the gods, The Looper and &lt;a href=\"The%20Underground\"&gt;The Underground&lt;/a&gt; to stand against Zeus and his allies, ultimately dethroning the god for good.\nAfter the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; and the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Megalo%20Don\"&gt;Megalo Don&lt;/a&gt;, all the characters belonging to the previous season (except &lt;a href=\"Apollo%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Artemis%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt;) fled the island, however the fate of Medusa is unknown, however &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt; is glad to know she succeeded in being responsible for the dethronement of Zeus. \nReferences.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Megalo Don was seeking Pandora's Box power and planned to ravage the Island using the nitro fueled Leviathan Ship. His plans were foiled by &lt;a href=\"The%20Wanderer\"&gt;The Wanderer&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe is a major antagonist of , serving as the main antagonist in .\nPersonality.\nMegalo Don is the typical big bad, megalomaniac, evil brute with huge ego. His hunger for powers, destruction, sharks and &lt;a href=\"Nitro\"&gt;Nitro&lt;/a&gt; seems to be endless, claiming the screams of his enemies will taste sweet and that he will enjoy every bite. Despite his quest for power, he is not interested in gaining new territories, he prefers to plunder, ravage, destroy, then return to sea to find new lands and do the same. However, he will not hesitate to do anything to make himself and his army more powerful, using technology and Nitro to empower themselves. \nDespite his behavior, he isn't entirely merciless and does not harbor ill will towards those who fear him or bow to him, wanting to be praised as the ruler of the wasteland. Moreover, as long as people don't try to attack him, steal \"his\" nitro or get in his way, he won't go after them. When provoked, he warns people to \"just walk away\" showing that he knows how to exercise self-control despite his explosive temperament.\nDespite some minor elements of mercy, his ultimate goal is the takeover and subsequent destruction of the island and there seem to be no lines he won't cross to accomplish it.\nHistory.\nChapter 5: Season 2.\n&lt;a href=\"Sandstorm%20Event\"&gt;Sandstorm Event&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; wanted to get revenge after he was defeated and dethroned by The Looper, he used the remainder of his power to overload Pandora's Box and released an immense source of energy. This source of energy alerted Megalo Don, who therefore decided to go to the Island, having been mysteriously attracted by the power of the box. Crossing along The Sandstorm created by the energy of Pandora's Box to reach the Island. He used his ship's lights to send messages to everyone on the island: \"NO HOPE\", \"GET REKT\", \"OUT OF CONTROL\", \"NO BRAKES\", \"WILDNESS\" and \"CASSATION\", all in morse code.\nChapter 5: Season 3.\nThe Wasteland Warriors arrived on the Island along with the sandstorm and claimed ownership of the Wasteland Biome and all the Nitro. &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; discovered that Megalo Don plans to destroy the Island, but won't be able to launch his raid until his Leviathan ship is refueled with enough &lt;a href=\"Nitro\"&gt;Nitro&lt;/a&gt;. He therefore asks &lt;a href=\"The%20Machinist\"&gt;The Machinist&lt;/a&gt;, the Wasteland Warriors' engineer to &lt;a href=\"Redline%20Rig\"&gt;extract&lt;/a&gt; Nitro to be able to power the Leviathan.

Most objects usually take up to around 20, but more complex objects may even take up to thousands.\nThere are 2 types of memory management systems: Spatial Thermometer and World Partition.\n\"This system is available on Islands that are running on Creative.\" \nThe Spatial Thermometer memory management system measures memory cell by cell, comparing the memory use of each one to the cells next to it. Instead of loading everything in the island and storing it, the island will only use memory to store what is seen and used. It unloads unseen props and terrain from memory. As players move around the island, the system only loads things the player can see and interact with. \nWhen you add a &lt;a href=\"Devices%20%28Creative%29\"&gt;device&lt;/a&gt; to the island, its memory cost is added to all cells in the island. Devices always need to be loaded in memory to operate and can't be swapped in and out like props. That's because devices affect players no matter where they are on the island, and you don't want them to stop working when players get too far away from them. \nThe Spatial Thermometer system gives you two methods to see how much memory you have used:\nWorld Partition is an automatic data management and distance-based level streaming system that provides a complete solution for large world management. The system removes the previous need to divide large levels into sublevels by storing your world in a single persistent level separated into grid cells, and provides you with an automatic streaming system to load and unload those cells based on distance from a streaming source.\nThis system must be enabled in &lt;a href=\"Unreal%20Editor%20for%20Fortnite\"&gt;UEFN&lt;/a&gt;, and cannot be used in Creative. This system also offers extra tools, such as viewing the objects in your Islands using a tab in UEFN.\nYou can &lt;a href=\"https%3A//dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/tutorials/e9rZ/fortnite-uefn-world-partition-editor\"&gt;enable&lt;/a&gt; World Partition by going to: \"World Settings\" -&gt; \"World Partition Setup\" -&gt; \"Enable Streaming\"."}

It was introduced in .\nFunctionality.\nMichelangelo's Nunchaku are a hybrid of a close range hack-and-slash weapon and an air ambush weapon like the other &lt;a href=\"Rarity\"&gt;Mythic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Collaborations\"&gt;TMNT&lt;/a&gt; weapons. They have a unique octagonal reticle (reminiscent of a turtle shell). When attacking and targeting an opponent in range, the reticle becomes orange, the color of Michelangelo's headband.\nEach Mythic TMNT weapon has a standard attack (fire) that can be held to string a chain of attacks together. Each hit deals different amounts of damage and thus the weapon does not have a consistent damage per second. They also possess an air dash (aim) that will allow the player to quickly launch themselves into the air a short distance. It can also be used on the ground. This dash also deals damage if it hits an opponent, but has a very small cooldown afterwards. While in the air, the player may use the standard attack to produce an air attack (a ground slam that deals heavy damage and knockback).\nIn addition, simply having this weapon as the active weapon grants the user a passive double jump. Using this gives the player fall damage immunity and a slight boost forward, but it can't be used again until the player touches the ground. This jump uses stamina even if the player isn't sprinting. For this reason, players must manage their stamina carefully, as if they are caught in midair without enough stamina to double jump, they will take fall damage as normal and potentially eliminate themselves.\nThe weapon has three charges that slowly refill over time similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Grapple%20Blade\"&gt;Grapple Blade&lt;/a&gt;. Using an air dash or air attack expends a charge. Each charge takes 10 seconds to refill.\nMichelangelo's Combo.\nMichelangelo's standard attack combo consists of multiple spinning strikes with the nunchaku leading up to a leap into the air and a final overhead strike.\nWeapon ID.\nMichelangelo's Nunchaku are referred to as Lined Notebook Ocean in the files.\nNews Tab.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

At an unknown period of time he also founded GHOST faction, which eventually became rivals with SHADOW, starting with each of their subdivisions, E.G.O. and A.L.T.E.R, with both becoming predominant in the organization, forcing neutral agents to choose sides, later leading to infighting. After a long time after the war, the two factions finally reconciled.\nThe two factions of Midas' crew have a different mode of operation, to begin with, GHOST acts under the direct authority of Midas without an intermediate leader and only deals with contracted operation, however there have been noteworthy GHOST operatives such as &lt;a href=\"Skye\"&gt;Skye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deadpool\"&gt;Deadpool&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ocean\"&gt;Ocean&lt;/a&gt; who commanded &lt;a href=\"GHOST%20Henchmen\"&gt;GHOST Henchmen&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the other hand, SHADOW is led by &lt;a href=\"Meowdas\"&gt;Meowdas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Director\"&gt;Chaos Director&lt;/a&gt; and formerly Chaos Agent who was granted his authority from the later and acts in a much more extensive manner, notably in weapons dealing, scientific experiments and has links with several large companies such as Slurp Co and Kevolution Energy. Added to this is their contracted operations just like GHOST.\nLocations, Members and Technology.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nTechnology.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nHistory.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nBefore Chapter 2.\n&lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt; founded &lt;a href=\"Midas%27%20Crew\"&gt;his crew&lt;/a&gt; at an unknown time in an unknown reality. Through his covert skills, he set his sights on building an empire of espionage, intrigue, and conquest. For this he recruited three people with great potential to his cause:\nTogether, they formed &lt;a href=\"The%20First%20Shadows\"&gt;The First Shadows&lt;/a&gt;: the very first agents of the newly formed faction named &lt;a href=\"SHADOW\"&gt;SHADOW&lt;/a&gt;. This marked the official beginning for the organization beyond Midas' personal conquest.\nAfter an unknown period of time, a new faction appeared in Midas' crew, named &lt;a href=\"GHOST\"&gt;GHOST&lt;/a&gt;, which quickly became rivals with SHADOW. The &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; recruits the services of GHOST to study and map Apollo. Unbeknownst to GHOST at the time, SHADOW had already begun engaging in various operations on &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;the island&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe E.G.O. team from GHOST and the A.L.T.E.R. team from SHADOW began entering into conflicts which triggered infighting among Midas' crew. A.L.T.E.R. agents started to oppose the members of E.G.O. and deliberately chased them down, with &lt;a href=\"Rippley%20vs%20Sludge\"&gt;Rippley&lt;/a&gt; being one of their main targets.\nLater in the season, &lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt; selects &lt;a href=\"Eye%20Land\"&gt;Eye Land&lt;/a&gt; as the new grounds for the main base of GHOST, likely aware of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; stationed underneath it. Simultaneously, construction on five SHADOW Safe Houses around the island begins.\n&lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt; founded &lt;a href=\"The%20Agency\"&gt;The Agency&lt;/a&gt;, his employment organization for spies from both the factions of GHOST \"and\" SHADOW. The organization has its headquarters of the same name built on &lt;a href=\"Eye%20Land\"&gt;Eye Land&lt;/a&gt;. Conflicts between SHADOW and GHOST escalate, and grow into an all-out Spy War.\nWith The Agency now built, and tension arisen between the two, the war between GHOST and SHADOW begins in full.\nWhile Meowscles controlled The Yacht for GHOST, there were three members of Midas' crew who had not yet chosen their allegiance and remained neutral at the beginning: Brutus, TNTina and Skye.\n&lt;br&gt;\nHowever, throughout the season, the balance of power between GHOST and SHADOW changed enormously:\nDuring the war, Midas gradually worked on a &lt;a href=\"Doomsday%20Device\"&gt;Doomsday Device&lt;/a&gt; with his daughter &lt;a href=\"Jules\"&gt;Jules&lt;/a&gt; made to break free from &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt;. This Device was located in his room, directly underneath The Agency, and possibly right above &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;. \nMidas' room housed several things that hinted at his involvement behind the scenes:\nNear the end of the season, &lt;a href=\"Renegade%20Shadow\"&gt;Renegade Shadow&lt;/a&gt; storms &lt;a href=\"The%20Agency\"&gt;The Agency&lt;/a&gt; for SHADOW\u2019s conquest. Countdowns for the activation of Midas' Device began appearing in the Agency and in Midas' own room.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Device%20%28event%29\"&gt;The Device&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Device was activated on June 15, 2020. Upon its initiation, Midas' voice and several other Henchmen voices could've been heard as it executed its functions to try and push &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt; back, destroying much of The Agency.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe Device's plan ultimately failed, and the Storm attacked The Device in retaliation, and turned into a giant &lt;a href=\"The%20Wall%20Of%20Water\"&gt;Wall of Water&lt;/a&gt;. \nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Live%20Events\"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;, Midas publicly reappears aligned with SHADOW, and controls what's left of The Agency for the now opposing faction - though he remains the de facto leader of GHOST.\nThe giant Wall of Water created by The Storm collapsed, flooding the entire Island. The headquarters of SHADOW are now &lt;a href=\"The%20Authority\"&gt;The Authority&lt;/a&gt;, a larger version of The Agency re-constructed by &lt;a href=\"Jules\"&gt;Jules&lt;/a&gt;, and implemented a large anti-flood wall that surrounds the compound. Midas was attacked by a &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Shark\"&gt;Loot Shark&lt;/a&gt;.\nSHADOW continues the war against GHOST, who built &lt;a href=\"The%20Fortilla\"&gt;The Fortilla&lt;/a&gt; as their new headquarters. GHOST's operatives, such as &lt;a href=\"Ocean\"&gt;Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, refused to give up the fight against SHADOW, and tried to make a comeback after they lost The Agency, but the war is overall less aggressive.\nBoth &lt;a href=\"The%20Authority\"&gt;The Authority&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Fortilla\"&gt;The Fortilla&lt;/a&gt; have been completely abandoned, and the war between GHOST and SHADOW seems to have ended, with many members now working for themselves, waiting to return online again., pursuing other goals.\n\nSHADOW, still inactive, is investigated by detective &lt;a href=\"Sleuth\"&gt;Sleuth&lt;/a&gt;, who seeks to hunt down all the agents of both SHADOW and &lt;a href=\"GHOST\"&gt;GHOST&lt;/a&gt;. Sleuth is ultimately unsuccessful. \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"Marigold\"&gt;Marigold&lt;/a&gt;, a member of Midas' crew, arrives on the island, and just like Midas, she is cursed with the Golden Touch. In her &lt;a href=\"Marigold%27s%20Quests\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt;, she mentions that someone was spending Midas' gold, and recruited the services of &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; for revenge.\n\n&lt;a href=\"Marigold\"&gt;Marigold&lt;/a&gt; along with several &lt;a href=\"GHOST\"&gt;GHOST&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"SHADOW\"&gt;SHADOW&lt;/a&gt; henchmen went to collect something. \nMarigold is in on a secret plan with Midas and Jules, as she looks for a getaway driver.\nFor &lt;a href=\"Cosmic%20Summer%20Celebration\"&gt;Cosmic Summer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Midsummer%20Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt; reappears with other agents of his crew, including &lt;a href=\"Beach%20Jules\"&gt;Jules&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beach%20Brutus\"&gt;Brutus&lt;/a&gt;, for an undercover mission.\n&lt;br&gt;\nWe also learn that SHADOW agents infiltrated and sabotaged &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20First%20Shadows\"&gt;The First Shadows&lt;/a&gt; reappeared for unspecified reasons.\nDuring the War against &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt;, several SHADOW members have joined the ranks of the Imagined Order:\nMany former and current members of SHADOW have joined one of two organizations: &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Blooded\"&gt;Cold Blooded&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Most%20Wanted%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Most Wanted&lt;/a&gt;. The former faction guards vaults all over the island, and the latter is wishing to rob them.\n&lt;a href=\"Scrapknight%20Jules\"&gt;Jules&lt;/a&gt; decided to join &lt;a href=\"Oathbound\"&gt;Oathbound&lt;/a&gt; in order to learn about their technology.\nBecause of his loss of income, &lt;a href=\"Turk%20vs%20Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt; teamed up with his Alter-ego from long ago: &lt;a href=\"Turk%20vs%20Riptide\"&gt;Turk&lt;/a&gt;, to capture the &lt;a href=\"Coral%20Buddies\"&gt;Coral Buddies&lt;/a&gt; and sell them. This caused them to come into conflict with the people of &lt;a href=\"Atlantis\"&gt;Atlantis&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly after Turk and Riptide fail, &lt;a href=\"Stingray\"&gt;Stingray&lt;/a&gt;, under orders from &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Agent%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Chaos Agent&lt;/a&gt;, contacts &lt;a href=\"Meowscles\"&gt;Meowscles&lt;/a&gt; to tell him they have work to do.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Explorer\"&gt;Chaos Agent&lt;/a&gt; enjoys some outdoor activities and exploration.\n&lt;a href=\"Renegade%20Shadow\"&gt;Renegade Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, who has become an expert as a heist crew leader, is looking for a new crew to rob the &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Suites\"&gt;Eclipse Hotel&lt;/a&gt;. Other SHADOW agents are also involved in the heists, including:\nUpon finding clues as to the whereabouts of &lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marigold\"&gt;Marigold&lt;/a&gt; calls former agents and friends of his break him out of &lt;a href=\"The%20Underworld\"&gt;The Underworld&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jules\"&gt;Jules&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"TNTina\"&gt;TNTina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skye\"&gt;Skye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Meowscles\"&gt;Meowscles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brutus\"&gt;Brutus&lt;/a&gt; - the current leader of Midas' crew - reform &lt;a href=\"Midas%27%20Crew\"&gt;the old gang&lt;/a&gt; with the help of Marigold and her enlisted ally &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;, search for Midas' underworld cell, only to discover he had already broken free himself. With the forces of &lt;a href=\"The%20Society\"&gt;The Society&lt;/a&gt; dwindling, and the new back together, SHADOW Agents take back control over &lt;a href=\"The%20Marigold\"&gt;The Marigold&lt;/a&gt; as their ticket out, and the tentative new home base for Midas and his crew.\n&lt;br&gt;\nMidas sets his sights on escaping &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;the island&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"The%20Marigold\"&gt;The Marigold&lt;/a&gt;, wary of &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;' wrath and retaliation. Midas' goal is a fruitful voyage on his yacht to expand his empire somewhere else outside of the island for his mighty ambitions. While Brutus prepares The Marigold to leave with Midas, his top agents create distractions across Helios that allow his escape mission to succeed. Midas hides out on &lt;a href=\"Spawn%20Island\"&gt;Spawn Island&lt;/a&gt;, away from Hades, waiting for the plan to succeed.\n&lt;br&gt;\nFollowing the successful heist, &lt;a href=\"Midas%27%20Crew\"&gt;Midas' Crew&lt;/a&gt; all collectively set forth on their voyage into the ambitious unknown, and have - for the foreseeable future - left the world of . However, some operatives of &lt;a href=\"SHADOW\"&gt;SHADOW&lt;/a&gt; remain on the island, with assignable &lt;a href=\"SHADOW%20Briefings\"&gt;SHADOW Briefings&lt;/a&gt; continuing to be offered, even around newer locations as the chapter progresses.\nGHOST's primary Bases, &lt;a href=\"The%20Shark\"&gt;The Shark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Agency\"&gt;The Agency&lt;/a&gt;, were spray painted on &lt;a href=\"Restored%20Reels\"&gt;Restored Reels&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;. However, the spray paint has all of the GHOST logos painted over, with a SHADOW logo presented on the front of The Agency.\n&lt;a href=\"Chapter%202%20Remix\"&gt;Chapter 2 Remix&lt;/a&gt;.\nArriving in an of &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Midas%27%20Crew\"&gt;Midas' Crew&lt;/a&gt; settled on the island and have taken back many of the bases originally under their control. However things were different, as the Island was taken over by legendary musical artists &lt;a href=\"Snoop%20Dogg\"&gt;Snoop Dogg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rap%20Boy%20Reloaded\"&gt;Eminem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Spice\"&gt;Ice Spice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Juice%20WRLD\"&gt;Juice WRLD&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Snoop%20Dogg\"&gt;Snoop Dogg&lt;/a&gt; took over &lt;a href=\"The%20Doggpound\"&gt;The Agency&lt;/a&gt; compound for &lt;a href=\"Snoop%27s%20Enterprise\"&gt;his company&lt;/a&gt; and recruited Eminem, Ice Spice, Juice WRLD and contracted both GHOST and SHADOW.\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn the meantime two high-ranking operatives of SHADOW appear:\n&lt;br&gt;\nOther old and new agents also appear, such as &lt;a href=\"1-Ball\"&gt;1-Ball&lt;/a&gt;, a GHOST Agent who meets up with his legend and fellow GHOST Agent, &lt;a href=\"8-Ball%20vs%20Scratch\"&gt;8-Ball&lt;/a&gt;, to test who truly is the best. &lt;a href=\"Undercover%20Skye\"&gt;Skye&lt;/a&gt; also returned although this time, she has no base nor known faction, however she did tease the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Juice%20WRLD\"&gt;Juice WRLD&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Director\"&gt;Chaos Director&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Meowdas\"&gt;Meowdas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1-Ball\"&gt;1-Ball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Undercover%20Skye\"&gt;Skye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dynamo%20TNTina\"&gt;TNTina&lt;/a&gt; were all contracted by &lt;a href=\"The%20Doggpound\"&gt;The Doggpound&lt;/a&gt; and sit on the board alongside &lt;a href=\"Snoop%20Dogg\"&gt;Snoop Dogg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rap%20Boy%20Reloaded\"&gt;Rap Boy Reloaded&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Spice\"&gt;Ice Spice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Juice%20WRLD\"&gt;Juice WRLD&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Meowdas\"&gt;Meowdas&lt;/a&gt;'s group arrived in , at &lt;a href=\"Oninoshima\"&gt;Oninoshima&lt;/a&gt;.

As such, the rating limits the features that can be present in many of Fortnite's games, and requires that some elements (mainly those of &lt;a href=\"Collaborations\"&gt;real world media&lt;/a&gt;) are to be edited. The following is a list of features which have been edited or changed to fit this rating, or due to real world controversy.\nMusic.\nMusic is present in Fortnite in three main ways: &lt;a href=\"Lobby%20Music\"&gt;Lobby Tracks&lt;/a&gt; which for the most part are First-Party audio tracks, &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations\"&gt;Radio Stations&lt;/a&gt; which are primarily real world music, and &lt;a href=\"Jam%20Tracks\"&gt;Jam Tracks&lt;/a&gt; used in &lt;a href=\"Fortnite%20Festival\"&gt;Fortnite Festival&lt;/a&gt; to perform to. The last two are most prevalent to editing. Some of the things that have been removed include:\nReal World Connections.\nSometimes, real world issues can impact a video game due to a feature being present alluding to something that has happened in the real world.\nCollaborations.\nSome collaborations between Fortnite and other media pull references from shows with ratings higher than Fortnite's T rating. As such, some references have been changed.\nFortnite: China.\n\"Main Article: \"\nFortnite: China was an exclusive version of Fortnite only playable in China. Due to their censorship laws surrounding violence, depiction of skulls, and video game access for children, the game had some significant changes. For example, Skull items such as &lt;a href=\"Skull%20Trooper\"&gt;Skull Trooper&lt;/a&gt; were not present at all, &lt;a href=\"Mystique%27s%20Skull\"&gt;Mystique's Skull&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Back%20Bling\"&gt;Back Bling&lt;/a&gt; was changed into a sphere, and skull themed edit styles were changed to remove skull related iconography.\nAge Restricted Cosmetics.\n\"Main Article: &lt;a href=\"Age%20Restricted%20Cosmetics\"&gt;Age Restricted Cosmetics&lt;/a&gt;\"\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Update%20v27.10\"&gt;Update v27.10&lt;/a&gt;, certain cosmetics became restricted for use in certain &lt;a href=\"Fortnite\"&gt;Fortnite&lt;/a&gt; experiences. All cosmetics could be used in experiences rated T for Teen, but experiences rated E or E10+ had certain restrictions on what cosmetics could be worn, primarily on cosmetics that feature real-life weapons (such as knives or guns) or feature obvious fear or violence elements (such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer\"&gt;The Devourer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Carnage\"&gt;Carnage&lt;/a&gt;). As of &lt;a href=\"Update%20v30.40\"&gt;Update v30.40&lt;/a&gt;, 96 cosmetics cannot be used in E/E10+ experiences.\nLEGO Styles.\nThe LEGO Group has a long standing policy on not creating pieces or sets based on real weapons or military theming. Because of this, many Outfits in Fortnite that reference or have weapons attached to them have slightly altered LEGO Styles (such as either replacing or removing the attached weapons). For the same reason, many collaborations (such as &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Griffin\"&gt;Peter Griffin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Kratos\"&gt;Kratos&lt;/a&gt;) don't have LEGO styles at all, as they appeal to more mature audiences.\n\"A comparison between &lt;a href=\"Splode\"&gt;Splode&lt;/a&gt; and his LEGO Style, where the latter has all references to explosives replaced with pool balls.\""}

Instead, he can be challenged by breaking his effigy thus triggering the fight. \nThe encounter is split into three phases:\nPhase 1: ELIMINATE THE WOLVES!\nThree &lt;a href=\"Wildlife\"&gt;Shade Wolves&lt;/a&gt; spawn and more will appear in a slow rate to attack the player. A maximum of three can only appear during this phase and three of them need to be eliminated to progress to the next phase. Any remaining Shade Wolves will despawn upon the completion of this phase.\nPhase 2: ELIMINATE THE WOLVES!\nSix Shade Wolves will appear surrounding the arena, increasing the max amount that can appear in the process. Three of them need to be eliminated again to progress the phase and any remaining Shade Wolves will despawn upon the completion of this phase.\nPhase 3: DEFEAT CERBERUS!\nCerberus spawns in front of his effigy podium with and , &lt;a href=\"Howl\"&gt;howling&lt;/a&gt; to announce his presence with the following abilities at his disposal:\nGallery.\n=Lore=\nCerberus is the loyal hound of &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; and gatekeeper of &lt;a href=\"The%20Underworld\"&gt;The Underworld&lt;/a&gt;. Each of his heads have their own consciousness, with the middle one being the lead.\nHe is a supporting antagonist of , serving as a supporting antagonist in .\nPersonality.\nCerberus possesses the traits of regular dog, such as barking and chewing things. He is hostile towards those that try to leave or enter The Underworld, showing he takes his job seriously. His three heads all have a mind of their own, with the middle one being friendlier to &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; and being willing to disobey a direct order from Zeus despite him being on his side. However, the other two heads are hostile to The Looper and tried to trick them to fight Zeus and Ares in order to eliminate them .\nTimeline.\nBefore Chapter 5.\nAt an unknown point Hades and Cerberus competed against &lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt; and Phinster in a surfing competition, although Poseidon managed to win.\nThe mosaic that &lt;a href=\"Odyssey\"&gt;Odyssey&lt;/a&gt; was searching for has Cerberus' heads on it. A constellation symbolizing Cerberus, in the form of a hound's head, and a carving of him could be seen on &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Pandora's Box was opened, Cerberus came along with the other Gods to punish mortals for opening it and releasing the souls of The Underworld. He guards &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Gate\"&gt;Grim Gate&lt;/a&gt;, the entrance to &lt;a href=\"The%20Underworld\"&gt;The Underworld&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Hades is contacted by &lt;a href=\"The%20Oracle\"&gt;The Oracle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;, with a proposal, namely to stop his brother &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;. Once The Looper proves that they are strong enough by battling Cerberus, Hades continues to remain neutral in the conflict. Zeus wants Cerberus to get info on &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;, a command which Cerberus is willing to ignore as long as The Looper helps him find an \"artifact\", a tennis ball that &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; gave him, which he ended up losing. The Loopers digs up the spots Cerberus thinks the artifact is, to no avail. Cerberus' other heads intervene and try to get The Looper killed, telling them that &lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; took the artifact. It turns out &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; hid the ball for \"safekeeping\" during Zeus' tempest, but after seeing how desperate he is to take it back, he puts the scent of the ball on The Looper and tells them to play with Cerberus so he can release his energy. Once playtime is over, Cerberus picks up the ball's scent. The Looper digs it up, later delivering it to Cerberus' &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Gate\"&gt;dog house&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile most of the gods fled from the Island after Zeus' defeat to find new domains, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Artemis%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;, Hades asks Cerberus to wait behind on the Island to wait for &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;the Queen&lt;/a&gt;, still guarding The Underworld and its Gate. Once the Queen returned from her vacation, Hades returned to the Island to take them to their new domain. \nReferences.\n=Audio=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

With 100 Fortbytes, each Fortbyte forms a part of picture that in whole decrypts the Season 9 mystery. The starting set of 18 out of 100 appeared on day 1, and they usually involve XP, Battle Pass, and searching in various locations. Every 24 hours, at least 1 Fortbyte will be added to the map. Most of the challenges that are added are usually in order of the Battle Pass unlocks that are required from Tier 1 to 100. Starting at 10 Fortbytes, every 5th Fortbyte unlocks a reward. 90 Fortbytes gives the Season 9 outfit, &lt;a href=\"Singularity\"&gt;Singularity&lt;/a&gt;. After collecting all 100 Fortbytes, you win a loading screen called \u201c&lt;a href=\"Visions\"&gt;Visions&lt;/a&gt;\u201d, which shows &lt;a href=\"Bunker%20Jonesy\"&gt;Bunker Jonesy&lt;/a&gt; pointing at the painting.
