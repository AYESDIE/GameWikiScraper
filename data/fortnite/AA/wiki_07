It was introduced in &lt;a href=\"Season%204\"&gt;Season 4&lt;/a&gt;. It is a mechanic that highlights players or certain objects in the environment to allow for longer distance and un-obscured viewing of them.\nFunctionality.\nThermal Vision works by highlighting players or certain objects in the environment, by contrasting them greatly with the background. Thermal Vision will either highlight a player warm colors, such as orange and red on a dark blue backdrop, or it will highlight them white or grey, on a dark backdrop. This allows the objects to contrast and be seen easier.\nThermal Vision works through transparent objects, such as damaged or under construction structures. This allows players to be highlighted and identified easier through them. Thermal Vision also works through fog and smoke, so things like &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt;'s obstructing purple mist, or the smoke from a &lt;a href=\"Smoke%20Grenade\"&gt;Smoke Grenade&lt;/a&gt; will be ignored with Thermal Vision.\nHowever, Thermal Vision can make it difficult to gauge distance, as the backdrop created by Thermal vision is bland and similar, meaning an object that is large and far away, may appear similar to one close and smaller. On top of this, Thermal Vision can make it difficult to identify Targets. For example, a player may attack an AI such as a &lt;a href=\"IO%20Guards\"&gt;IO Guard&lt;/a&gt; instead of an enemy player, as it is very difficult to distinguish between them when they are highlighted the same color.\nThings that are highlighted with Thermal Vision include:\nThermal Vision related Items.\nThermal Vision can be applied with various items."}

The Chapter 3 version of Tilted Towers was almost identical to its original counterpart, save for a few differences. Much of the location had been revamped - new buildings existed such as the coffee shop and the gas station, the crossroads can support vehicles like &lt;a href=\"Cars\"&gt;Cars&lt;/a&gt; and act as real drivable roads, and all buildings look newer due to the use of &lt;a href=\"Unreal%20Engine\"&gt;Unreal Engine 5&lt;/a&gt; which makes the location look more polished all-around. In addition to these changes, in the wake of , the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; had occupied the city and had set up equipment and various kinds of ordinance virtually everywhere - including stationing an accessible blimp above the location. \nGallery.\n=Chapter 1=\nTilted Towers was a &lt;a href=\"Named%20Locations\"&gt;named location&lt;/a&gt; formerly located nearby &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dusty%20Depot\"&gt;Dusty Depot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Salty%20Springs\"&gt;Salty Springs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shifty%20Shafts\"&gt;Shifty Shafts&lt;/a&gt; - being a center location of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Royale%20Map\"&gt;Battle Royale Map&lt;/a&gt;. It is one of the most popular locations of the island.\nOverview.\nPrior to it's reintroduction, Tilted was in the island &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;, where there were a few differences to its newer version. For example, there was originally an Office building where &lt;a href=\"No%20Sweat%20Insurance\"&gt;No Sweat Insurance&lt;/a&gt; would stand.

Later, for unspecified reason, Titan became the guardian of Pandora's Box.\nPost Big Bang.\nAt an unspecified time period, Titan along with &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt; and other pieces of his reality ended in &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Hand\"&gt;The Hand&lt;/a&gt; was awoken by &lt;a href=\"Valeria\"&gt;Valeria&lt;/a&gt;'s attempt to open the &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt;.

It was introduced during . The Titan is the main battle tank of the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt;. However, some of them were captured and repainted by &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt;.\nFunctionality.\nThe Titan seats 4 players, consisting of a driver, machine gunner, and 2 passengers. The driver has full control of the vehicle and is able to drive in any direction, destroying structures as they move. The driver can use the Primary Fire Button to fire the turret, firing an explosive that deals splash damage and starts falling towards the ground similarly to the projectile of a &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifles\"&gt;Sniper Rifle&lt;/a&gt;. The main cannon also has a &lt;a href=\"Thermal%20Vision\"&gt;thermal&lt;/a&gt; aiming option, triggered by holding the aim button.\nThe machine gunner is located on the top of the tank. The machine gun overheats if fired continuously for too much time. The passengers are able to fire their own weapons and heal independently. \nThe Titan has three weak spots: the tracks, the driver's hatch and the engine. If one of the tracks is destroyed, the driver will have much trouble driving; however, they can be restored manually without any specific item. When the driver's hatch is destroyed, the driver will be directly exposed to enemy fire, but it will repair automatically after a time which is indicated by a light bar under it. The visible part of the engine, located in the back of the tank, consists of two yellow boxes and damaging it enough will cause the vehicle to stop moving and be inaccessible for about 13 seconds.\nThe Titan needs to be refuelled requiring much more fuel than a car and consequently, more time to refuel. The Titan's armor can be restored with a &lt;a href=\"Repair%20Torch\"&gt;Repair Torch&lt;/a&gt;. It has a boost function similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Cars\"&gt;Whiplash&lt;/a&gt;, which consumes more fuel and can be used to ram opponents. \nWhen the Titan reaches 0 HP, it will blow up after a few seconds, being launched in the air. The explosion will deal 50 damage to nearby players. It won't start a &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; however.\nObtained.\nThe Titan can currently be found in various locations that have been taken over by the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt;. \nAdditionally, &lt;a href=\"IO%20Patrol\"&gt;IO Patrol&lt;/a&gt; duos can be found patrolling the roads around the &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;island&lt;/a&gt; in a Titan Tank."}

It sports a decent enough drifting and it goes faster on road than on uneven terrain.

Following Tony Stark's arrival, he got to work right away, establishing a small base of operations in a disused farm house and developing &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Beacons\"&gt;Rift Beacons&lt;/a&gt;. Stark placed the beacons around &lt;a href=\"Frenzy%20Farm\"&gt;Frenzy Farm&lt;/a&gt;, and succeeded in his task, bringing a huge chunk of &lt;a href=\"Upstate%20New%20York\"&gt;Upstate New York&lt;/a&gt; containing &lt;a href=\"Stark%20Industries%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Stark Industries&lt;/a&gt; to the island. Stark utilized its high-tech research facilities and resources to upgrade the battle buses, fitting guns and gamma cells onto them. He then proceeded to use &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt; to clone the modified battle buses around 1 billion times. Stark also used the Rift Beacons to transport other superheroes to the island, such as Ant-Man and Black Panther (although the latter likely did not appear due to the passing of Chadwick).\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer%20of%20Worlds\"&gt;The Devourer of Worlds&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Galactus finally arrived to the island, he used his powerful abilities to rip The Zero Point out from The Bridge and began to absorb its power. However, The Zero Point seemed to have fought back, and violently pulled the tendrils of energy Galactus was absorbing back into it. This process cracked The Zero Point, and it pulled the entire island into &lt;a href=\"The%20In-Between\"&gt;The In-Between&lt;/a&gt;. In the ensuing battle, Galactus was tricked into swallowing the battle buses, and the gamma cells were promptly detonated, injuring Galactus and sending him through a rift.\nFollowing the event The Zero Point stabilized the island and reorganized the matter around itself into a desert, bringing in locations from the past as well. However, despite this, The Zero Point's outer shell was cracked, and it soon began to destabilize like in Season X. Following the battle, the superheroes left the island along with any of their traces.\nIn the trailer, Tony Stark is seen in his Iron Man suit along side &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Strange\"&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/a&gt;, entering the island through a portal.\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\n=Voice=\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer%20of%20Worlds\"&gt;The Devourer of Worlds&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnused.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

However, The Zero Point seemed to have fought back, and violently pulled the tendrils of energy Galactus was absorbing back into it. This process cracked The Zero Point, and it pulled the entire island into &lt;a href=\"The%20In-Between\"&gt;The In-Between&lt;/a&gt;. In the ensuing battle Wolverine helped destroy &lt;a href=\"Gatherers\"&gt;Gatherers&lt;/a&gt;.

They are attacked by\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Hybrid\"&gt;Hybrids&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and follow one to their base that gets blown up. They track more Hybrids and prepare a camp for the night. Imagined gets close with Wolverine, telling her backstorh and origims to him. She says she likes who Wolverine is, giving him a kiss. Next day, they reach\u00a0High Evolutionary\u00a0and\u00a0Stegron's laboratory. The group distracts Evolutionary and Stegron as Spider-Man sneaks into the lab to steal the Zero Shard. He meets\u00a0Doctor Doom\u00a0inside who escapes with a portal. They stop fighting and Evolutionary lets them get away to chase Doom.

Geno doesn't kill the sisters and rather shows mercy, but The Order kicks him making all of them fall and hold on to the platform. The Imagined sacrifices herself and jumps into\u00a0The Zero Point, taking Geno with her. Wolverine carries The Order back to the surface, and Order asks him his\u00a0Reality. She tells him that out of respect for her sister, she will avoid it. She angrily walks away, telling Wolverine to never cross her path again\nSomehow, Logan ended up in a secret underground laboratory in &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt;, and was later freed by &lt;a href=\"Wastelander%20Magneto\"&gt;Magneto&lt;/a&gt;. \n=Voice=\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer%20of%20Worlds\"&gt;The Devourer of Worlds&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

This boost can destroy structures.\nThe Grappler functions similar to the &lt;a href=\"Grappler\"&gt;item of the same name&lt;/a&gt;. However, unlike the item it will not yank the player towards the grapple location, but rather acts as a tether, allowing the ball to swing around a location. This can be used to gain enough momentum to launch the Baller into the air, and swing between structures. This grapple has infinite uses.\nAs the baller is damaged, it becomes cracked and will eventually shatter. This allows players to hurt the driver of a baller. Once the vehicle takes enough damage it will break and will only hurt a player if it breaks high into the air, due to fall damage.\nObtained.\nBallers could have been found at &lt;a href=\"Rave%20Cave\"&gt;Rave Cave&lt;/a&gt;.

Meanwhile, the &lt;a href=\"Time%20Machine\"&gt;Time Machine&lt;/a&gt; ended up in Loot Lake, due to Jones' truck slipping on a banana peel on the way. So, he had to use a trailer to carry the machine.\nOn November 16th, 2023, The Rocket's construction finished, along with the Time Machine now being in Dusty Divot. &lt;a href=\"Corruption%20Cubes\"&gt;The Cube&lt;/a&gt; began extracting &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; out of the Vault.\nOn November 21st, 2023, the countdown appeared in-game and in the lobby, along with the key art being revealed, and the blog post.\nOn November 23rd, 2023, the Time Machine was strapped onto the Rocket, which is the final stage of the Time Machine, and the rocket itself. &lt;a href=\"Corruption%20Cubes\"&gt;The Cube&lt;/a&gt; began absorbing the energy of The Zero Point.\nThe Event.\nThe Rocket at Dusty Divot launches into the sky, the Time Machine attached to the rocket causes it to glitch into different objects, such as a shark and a Crackshot figure. The rocket then accelerates towards the tail of the meteor, creating a rift behind it. Multiple rockets, presumably the Seven, repeatedly teleport from behind the meteor into a rift in front of the meteor, picking up speed each time. The meteor eventually starts moving, whilst also transforming into different objects. This causes the meteor to disappear into the rift. Following this, another rift opens up above Loot Lake, the rocket appears from the rift, aiming directly towards the Zero Point. Following the original rocket, the remaining few rockets guide the meteor which is repeatedly transforming towards the Zero Point, causing the meteor to implode the Zero Point, and create a black hole that swallows the entire island.\nAfter the entire island was swallowed and nothing was left behind, the Big Bang, a massive explosion of psychedelic patterns, occured. The player is then shown shooting through space following a trail of items presumably from a different universe. The player is then shown previews of the upcoming gamemodes, &lt;a href=\"LEGO%20Fortnite\"&gt;LEGO Fortnite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Racing\"&gt;Rocket Racing&lt;/a&gt;, along with an Eminem Concert which serves as a preview for &lt;a href=\"Fortnite%20Festival\"&gt;Fortnite Festival&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe event ends with The Looper witnessing and passing by the other galaxies created; locating the reality which contains &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt;.\n of Fortnite begins...\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept Art.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nTeasers.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

It was built over &lt;a href=\"The%20Vault\"&gt;The Vault&lt;/a&gt; in Chapter 2, but its location during Chapter 1 is unknown.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%20X\"&gt;Season X&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was first mentioned in the &lt;a href=\"Visitor%20Tapes\"&gt;Visitor Tapes&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn , The IO were in chaos after &lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"The%20Device%20%28event%29\"&gt;Device&lt;/a&gt; managed to destroy &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt; causing &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt; to break down. &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; gets Rifted into Jones' Office as Jones walks through the hallway talking to Doctor Slone on his phone. He tells &lt;a href=\"Envoy\"&gt;Janice&lt;/a&gt; to dial the Resonance Actuator to 7.2. reviving &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt; and set &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt; back to normal.\nThe cinematic brings us back to The Office right after &lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer%20of%20Worlds\"&gt;The Devourer of Worlds&lt;/a&gt;, where we see &lt;a href=\"IO%20Guards\"&gt;IO Guards&lt;/a&gt; scrambling as the ground shakes and the walls crack. &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; picks up a phone call from &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt;, and is ordered to enter the &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;Loop&lt;/a&gt;, reseal the bridge, and prevent anyone inside the loop from escaping. Jones leaves his office and enters The Bridge room, where he sees that the Zero Point was ripped out from the area, leaving a large hole in the floor stretching to the island. Jones uses the machine in the room to locate the best hunters across all realities, which will aid him in preventing anyone from escaping the loop. A mechanical voice says 'Signatures triangulated and aligned' once Jones finishes locating the hunters. Jones presses a button on the machine which shoots a purple orb into the hole towards the Zero Point. Jones himself is sucked into the hole and crashes headfirst into the Zero Point.\nAs of , The Bridge is abandoned and nearly destroyed, possibly by the Energy Pulme from &lt;a href=\"The%20Spire\"&gt;The Spire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Batman%20Zero\"&gt;Batman&lt;/a&gt; and his team find a way to enter the facility by using the &lt;a href=\"IO%20Hatches\"&gt;Hatches&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt;. They find 2 &lt;a href=\"Golems\"&gt;Golems&lt;/a&gt; protecting the entrance and IO Guards acting as the security. They eventually break into the The Bridge and powers the panels after discovering that entering the Zero Point directly would rip you apart between many realities. Using the panels to lock onto some of the characters\u2019 universal signatures allowed them to send everyone back to their respective homeworld. Unbeknownst to Batman, IO was using him to regain access to &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn , the player is finally able to access The Bridge via the &lt;a href=\"Impostors\"&gt;Impostors&lt;/a&gt; game mode, and can see that the Imagined Order control everything within the Loop. From loading chests with weapons, to producing Supply Drops and Supply Llamas.\nThe Bridge is traversed in the second half of the &lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28Chapter%202%29\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt; Live Event, as &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; allowed the loopers to go down one of the IO Hatches and enter it through a hidden entrance in the Science Lab. They reached the center, but an underwater &lt;a href=\"Caretaker\"&gt;Caretaker&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the glass ceiling of The Bridge, flooding it and sending the loopers out into the ocean.\nDuring , The IO renovate it so they can build &lt;a href=\"The%20Collider\"&gt;The Collider&lt;/a&gt;. An energy transmitter can be seen in the hallway.\n&lt;a href=\"Collision\"&gt;Collision&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring Collision, The Bridge was fully renovated to fit &lt;a href=\"The%20Collider\"&gt;The Collider&lt;/a&gt;, which used Crystals to lift &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; from The Bridge. After the crystals were destroyed, The Collider collapsed and was destroyed along with the Bridge.\nThe remains of the Bridge are destroyed during &lt;a href=\"Fracture\"&gt;Fracture&lt;/a&gt;.\n=Audio=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The Cube, also known as Kevin, would move around the map, and printed runes. &lt;a href=\"Corruption%20Cubes\"&gt;The Cube&lt;/a&gt; ended its journey by rolling into &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt;, sinking into the lake.\nAt the start of &lt;a href=\"Season%206\"&gt;Season 6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Corruption%20Cubes\"&gt;The Cube&lt;/a&gt; became active again, as it was revealed to be under the largest island in the middle of &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt;. The island rose into the sky, creating the &lt;a href=\"Floating%20Island\"&gt;Floating Island&lt;/a&gt;. The island started to move around the map, with the cube still attached. After another long saga of the cube moving around the map, it traveled back to the runes that it printed, and took their energy. Once all was said and done, the cube traveled back to the now &lt;a href=\"Leaky%20Lake\"&gt;Leaky Lake&lt;/a&gt;, where it started to beam energy into the sky, creating a portal to &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt;.

After a few seconds, the cube finally exploded, and a blinding white light covered all the players' screens. Everyone was teleported to &lt;a href=\"The%20In-Between\"&gt;The In-Between&lt;/a&gt;. After floating around for a while, a giant rift started to form, taking the shape of a giant Butterfly. It multiplied, and started to shrink while moving over to the player. The players stuck out their hands, and the butterflies landed on it. Then another flash of light appeared, and the players were back on the island, and coming down through a rift, with &lt;a href=\"Leaky%20Lake\"&gt;Leaky Lake&lt;/a&gt; now being covered by a new group of islands, most likely created by the zero point to protect itself.\nAudio.\n class=\"article-table\"\n!Audio\n!Description\n!1\n!rowspan=\"3\"Cube Dying Roar\n!2\n!3\n!1\n!rowspan=\"2\"Nectar drip\n!2\n!Into the Butterfly"}

Unlike most of its counterparts who power the purple Motherships or invade realities in groups, it was sent alone into a reality to destroy it itself just like Kevin and his alternative timeline version.\nAs the Cube, he appeared for the first time after the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Storm%20King\"&gt;Storm King&lt;/a&gt; in Canny Valley, then appeared in several questlines starting with Lok's Tale of Beyond, where Homebase first encounter him and he gives them a cryptic warning: \"THE SIX SIDES OF CHANCE CAN TURN IN AN INSTANT. THE DIE IS CAST.\"\nAfter The Timeline was broken in during The Long Road Home quests and that Ray disappeared over time, Commander and Director Riggs looked for a way to fix it in The Timeless questlines, unfortunately without success: the only solution was to destroy it before endangering the multiverse. But Ray who had traveled through time finally made a pact with The Cube to repair the timeline in exchange for something. \nA few seconds after the timeline collapsed on itself and that everyone ceased to exist The Cube partially restored it and explained to Homebase that it is necessary to perform 4 Dark Rituals to restore it completely but it was also a trick to help him regain all of his powers.\nAfter the completion of the rituals, the timeline was repaired and he becomes again the Storm King and wished revenge. But Mythic Storm King was defeated by Homebase and became again The Cube.\nAppearance.\nStorm King.\nAfter defeating the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20King\"&gt;Storm King&lt;/a&gt; in the mission &lt;a href=\"Enter%20the%20Portal\"&gt;Enter the Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the Cube can be seen dissolving in the arena's central pond, similar to what occurred in Season 5 of Battle Royale. It is not acknowledged through dialogue by any character.\n&lt;a href=\"Tales%20of%20Beyond\"&gt;Tales of Beyond: Monster Hunters&lt;/a&gt;.\nThroughout the questline of Lok's Tales of Beyond, Lok tells of a terrifying monster he encountered outside of Homebase. It is described as making everything feel 'dark and sad.' At the end of this questline, it appears and gives Homebase a cryptic warning: \"THE SIX SIDES OF CHANCE CAN TURN IN AN INSTANT. THE DIE IS CAST.\"\nTimeless.\nAt the end of the questline Timeless: Vroo-Over, &lt;a href=\"Ray\"&gt;Ray&lt;/a&gt; makes a deal with the Cube and requests that it fixes the rapidly deteriorating structure of the timeline. It complies, leading into the next questline in which you must complete a four rituals as your part of the deal.\nAudio.\n class=\"article-table\"\n!Audio\n!Subtitle\nSpawn\nVROOOO"}

He tells &lt;a href=\"Envoy\"&gt;Janice&lt;/a&gt; to dial the Resonance Actuator to 7.2. and restart The Loop. They soon return to the island, as The Device shuts down. The Storm fastly shrinks in and The Device activates again. It holds the storm around The Agency, and overloads it to push it back as much as it can. The Storm disappears, and The Device descends into The Agency as towers get back into their hatches.

Its sole purpose was to devour and destroy. It was trapped under &lt;a href=\"Polar%20Peak\"&gt;Polar Peak&lt;/a&gt; until it was unleashed by &lt;a href=\"The%20Prisoner\"&gt;The Prisoner&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"The%20Unvaulting%20Event\"&gt;The Unvaulting Event&lt;/a&gt; and it was killed by &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Mecha Team Leader&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"The%20Final%20Showdown\"&gt;The Final Showdown&lt;/a&gt; event.\nPersonality.\nThe Devourer was a self-aware creature endowed with enough intelligence to know the name that has been given to it and claims it as its own. The creature is endowed with a fairly precise goal of devouring and destroying everything. It does it out of desire and not instinct.\nThe Devourer acts like any intelligent predator, studying its target before attacking. And making small attacks to see how the Island's inhabitants would react. However, despite its intelligence, the Devourer is impulsive and gets angry easily.\nAppearance.\nThe Devourer is a gigantic one-eyed creature. It seems to be a reptilian with one yellow eye and sharp teeth.\nPowers and Abilites.\nThe Devourer is an overpowered Kaiju capable of holding his own against &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20King\"&gt;The Ice King&lt;/a&gt; and overpowered a &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Mecha Team Leader&lt;/a&gt; who was piloted by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;best mech captain of all Reality&lt;/a&gt; while it was in a weakened state after being imprisoned in ice for a very long time and starving. It had very high resistance, while a single missile from the Mecha Team Leader completely pulverized the Polar Peak castle on its back, the Devourer emerged unscathed against a whole salvo of missiles, although the explosion pushed it back. Its true power, in a state where it was not already weakened, is unknown. However it was powerful enough to be deemed a danger for its own Reality, The Omniverse as well as for The Zero Point.\nTimeline.\nPre-Chapter 1.\nIn &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20King\"&gt;The Ice King&lt;/a&gt;'s mission to capture objects and entities too dangerous to be left alive, The Devourer was trapped under &lt;a href=\"Polar%20Peak\"&gt;Polar Peak&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%209\"&gt;Season 9&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Volcano\"&gt;Volcano&lt;/a&gt; hit &lt;a href=\"Polar%20Peak\"&gt;Polar Peak&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Unvaulting%20Event\"&gt;The Unvaulting Event&lt;/a&gt;, the eye of The Devourer was seen in the ice. It managed to break out and walked into the &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, leaving giant footsteps after him. The &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; takes notice of this, but were happy with letting the monster destroy everything on &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;the Island&lt;/a&gt; and restart &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt;, although they were worried that he would harm &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; and ended being right as it was its target. &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt; volunteers to pilot a &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Mecha&lt;/a&gt; to take down The Devourer in order to avoid that the use of a Doomsday Weapon to annihilate the Devourer, along with The Island and its inhabitants by the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Final%20Showdown\"&gt;The Final Showdown&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Devourer rises from the ocean and start heading towards &lt;a href=\"The%20Vault\"&gt;The Vault&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Mecha Team Leader&lt;/a&gt; leaves &lt;a href=\"Pressure%20Plant\"&gt;Pressure Plant&lt;/a&gt; and attacks the Devourer, getting the two in a fight. The Devourer rips out Mecha's arm and heavily damages it, but Mecha damages The Vault and pulls &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; out. It goes for Singularity's statue and pulls it out, revealing a giant sword. Devourer attacks back but the Mecha strike the sword in his head, killing The Devourer with &lt;a href=\"No%20Sweat\"&gt;no sweat&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Government\"&gt;The Government&lt;/a&gt; dug up the remains of the Devourer, revealing his &lt;a href=\"The%20Devoured\"&gt;bones&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;.\nReferences.\n=Voice=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The Playlist went live at 3:35 PM EST and the event started at 4:10. The event ended ten minutes later at 4:20 PM.\nEvent Summary.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Live%20Events\"&gt;Live Event&lt;/a&gt; started, every player that attended it was on &lt;a href=\"Helicarrier%2064\"&gt;Helicarrier 64&lt;/a&gt;, which had moved from its previous spot as the &lt;a href=\"Spawn%20Island\"&gt;Spawn Island&lt;/a&gt; to above the &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo Island&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Dirty%20Docks\"&gt;Dirty Docks&lt;/a&gt;. The Live Event began with music similar to &lt;a href=\"Herald%27s%20Warning\"&gt;Herald's Warning&lt;/a&gt;, which may have been unique to the Live Event, that started playing when the Live Event\u2019s timer reached 2 minutes left.\nShortly after the Live Event\u2019s timer hit zero, &lt;a href=\"Galactus\"&gt;Galactus&lt;/a&gt; began to come closer to the Apollo Island and grew in size. Galactus then hit Helicarrier 64 with his fist and knocked all the players off it, luckily, &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Stark\"&gt;Iron Man&lt;/a&gt; gave the falling players a &lt;a href=\"Stark%20Industries%20Jetpack\"&gt;Stark Industries Jetpack&lt;/a&gt;. Galactus then reached for &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; (located under &lt;a href=\"The%20Ruins\"&gt;The Ruins&lt;/a&gt;), he then proceeds to extract the Zero Point from deep underneath the middle island. Due to the Zero Point attempting to fight back Galactus, almost everything was sucked into it like in &lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28Chapter%201%29\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of another &lt;a href=\"The%20Blackout\"&gt;Black Hole&lt;/a&gt; appearing on players\u2019 screens, they were sent into &lt;a href=\"The%20In-Between\"&gt;The In-Between&lt;/a&gt; and were inside multiple Upgraded Battle Buses in front of Galactus.\nIron Man explained to the players that he had created upgraded Battle Bus clones with cannons and Gamma Cells to use them as bombs. He then directed the players to shoot &lt;a href=\"Gorgers\"&gt;Gorgers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gatherers\"&gt;Gatherers&lt;/a&gt; coming from behind of Galactus with their Battle Bus\u2019 cannons, and to head towards Galactus so he could consume as many Battle Buses as possible. If all went to plan, Galactus would be sent back to where he came from. Throughout time, players got closer to Galactus and started to drive along his right arm with the help of &lt;a href=\"Thor\"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wolverine\"&gt;Wolverine&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, players left their Battle Buses and watched as Galactus consumed the Battle Buses while having Gamma energy coming out of him, and was then sent back to where he came from with a &lt;a href=\"Rift\"&gt;Rift&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers\u2019 screens then cut to the office seen in &lt;a href=\"The%20Device%20%28event%29\"&gt;The Device&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt; laying on the floor waking up from what seemed to be a nightmare. The countdown appeared after players\u2019 screens faded and the screen was replaced with the &lt;a href=\"To%20Be%20Continued%21\"&gt;To Be Continued!&lt;/a&gt;.\nVoice-Overs.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nEnglish Dialogue.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

This phenomenon is caused by the psionic powers of the time-traveling vampire &lt;a href=\"Kado%20Thorne\"&gt;Kado Thorne&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt;, Kado Thorne's psionic powers are able to trigger Eclipses despite them being impossible, as both the Sun and Moon within &lt;a href=\"Asteria\"&gt;Asteria&lt;/a&gt; were fake. \nIn-Game during the day, the Eclipse was only visible at 9AM-11AM. During the night, the red moon is always visible.\nHistory.\nEons Ago.\nThe Eclipse seems to have occured before - eons ago, during the era of &lt;a href=\"The%20Ancients\"&gt;The Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, where they made &lt;a href=\"The%20Apparatus\"&gt;The Apparatus&lt;/a&gt; in order to predict the incoming Eclipse and the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Kado%20Thorne\"&gt;Kado Thorne&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20Explorers\"&gt;the Explorers&lt;/a&gt; ventured into the ruins of The Ancients, studied the glyphs, and repaired &lt;a href=\"The%20Apparatus\"&gt;The Apparatus&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe glyphs predicted an incoming Eclipse -although astrological data states this to be impossible. However, this was supported by The Apparatus, which despite initial beliefs, turned out not to be a telescope - but rather a stellar projector. Murals found at &lt;a href=\"Rumble%20Ruins\"&gt;Rumble Ruins&lt;/a&gt; predicting the arrival of someone tied with The Eclipse attested this as well.\nThe vampire &lt;a href=\"Kado%20Thorne\"&gt;Kado Thorne&lt;/a&gt;, leader of &lt;a href=\"Eclipse\"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;, arrived on the Island and founded various hotel complexes there, all while draining the Island's wealth and going back in time to find objects to add to his collection. \nDuring &lt;a href=\"Fortnitemares%202023\"&gt;Fortnitemares 2023&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href=\"the%20Heist%20Crew\"&gt;the Heist Crew&lt;/a&gt;'s first attempt to steal his &lt;a href=\"Time%20Machine\"&gt;Time Machine&lt;/a&gt;, Kado Thorne transformed into his Revenant form, which closely resembled the person depicted in Rumble Ruins' murals. At the same time, a Solar Eclipse and a permanent Super Blood Moon took place: The Eclipse began."}

It was the concluding &lt;a href=\"Live%20Events\"&gt;Live Event&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Season%20X\"&gt;Season X&lt;/a&gt; and Chapter 1 in its entirety.\nBuildup.\nIn week 2 of &lt;a href=\"Season%20X\"&gt;Season X&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; builds &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Beacon\"&gt;Rift Beacons&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Dusty%20Depot\"&gt;Dusty Depot&lt;/a&gt; and places them at several &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Royale%20Map\"&gt;locations&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;island&lt;/a&gt; one at a time, which results in those areas where the beacons were present to change into alternate reality counterparts. As this was going on &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; was further destabilizing until week 7 where The Scientist would stop making Rift Beacons and starts creating the rocket seen in &lt;a href=\"Blast%20Off\"&gt;Blast Off&lt;/a&gt;, and he finishes it in week 9.\nEvent Summary.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; launches the rocket in the gray warehouse at Dusty Depot and moments after it launches the rocket's boosters on the side of it activate causing the rocket to go through a &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;rift&lt;/a&gt; which causes a massive &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;crack&lt;/a&gt; to appear momentarily before it disappears. Shortly after this, the Rift Zone rift above &lt;a href=\"Greasy%20Grove\"&gt;Greasy Grove&lt;/a&gt; began glowing brightly before a rocket flies out of it and flew past &lt;a href=\"Dusty%20Depot\"&gt;Dusty Depot&lt;/a&gt; before going into another rift over &lt;a href=\"Lonely%20Lodge\"&gt;Lonely Lodge&lt;/a&gt;. This then caused 6 other rockets to fly out of rifts above other &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Zones\"&gt;Rift Zones&lt;/a&gt; and fly around the island before all going into one rift close to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Meteor\"&gt;meteor&lt;/a&gt;. The Seven rockets then repeatedly fly in front of The Meteor, which causes it to unfreeze and go into the rift with the rockets. Moments later, a rift appears above &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt; and a rocket comes out aiming directly towards The Zero Point. It then flies into it, causing a massive shockwave that causes the player to be float away before a larger rift appears above Loot Lake, with the meteor and the other rockets guiding it towards The Zero Point as its Rift Zone begins expanding. As the meteor reaches the Rift Zone, the other rockets fly to safety while the meteor collides with The Zero Point, causing it to explode. Moments later, The Zero Point begins to contain itself, causing the player alongside the island to be sucked into it.\nIn the aftermath &lt;a href=\"The%20Blackout\"&gt;The Nothing&lt;/a&gt; appears. Over time, it was possible to see numbers appear which were: \"11, 146, 15, 62, 87, 14, 106, 2, 150, 69, 146, 15, 36, 2, 176, 8, 160, and 65.\" If put into comparison by the number with words, you get: \"I was not alone. Others were outside the loop. This was not calculated. | The Nothing is now inevitable\". It was also possible to enter the Konami code \"UP UP DOWN DOWN LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT B/CIRCLE A/X ENTER/MENU/OPTIONS/PLUGS). If done correctly, you could play the mini-game that replicated the arcade game that &lt;a href=\"Peely\"&gt;Peely&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jonesy%20The%20First\"&gt;Jonesy&lt;/a&gt; were seen playing during the &lt;a href=\"Season%209\"&gt;Season 9&lt;/a&gt; trailer. It was also possible to play the mini-game during Fortnite World Cup livestreams that were present in-game. During this downtime, you could not play or . If you attempted to play either mode, you could hear &lt;a href=\"Ray\"&gt;Ray&lt;/a&gt; telling you: \"OK, &lt;a href=\"Commander\"&gt;Commander&lt;/a&gt;! I have a plan, do not worry I will fix this. I will fix everything... not that anything is wrong!\" This indicated that the Reality Save the World takes place in wasn't affected and that she is safe.\nShortly before the event concluded, all Fortnite social medias run by &lt;a href=\"Epic%20Games\"&gt;Epic Games&lt;/a&gt; were all blacked out with all their posts being hidden/removed. There was only one post titled \"...\" with a livestream of The Nothing (the blackhole).\nOn October 15th 2019, the event ended after The Zero Point restabilized, which caused the Athena island to be reorganized in Reality Zero. During this reorganization two islands; &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt; were created. This marked the beginning of Chapter 2 with on &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; island.\nAudio.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

During this time, the players were given a &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Rifle\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Revolver\"&gt;Revolver&lt;/a&gt;, as well as unlimited ammo and access to the &lt;a href=\"Turret%20Station\"&gt;Turret Station&lt;/a&gt; to fight the &lt;a href=\"Cube%20Monsters\"&gt;Cube Monsters&lt;/a&gt; off.\nOnce the &lt;a href=\"Countdown%20To%20Zero\"&gt;countdown&lt;/a&gt; concluded, &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%20Queen\"&gt;The Cube Queen&lt;/a&gt; fired a beam of corrupted energy into the sky, opening a massive rift to &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt; which revealed hundreds of golden &lt;a href=\"The%20Mothership\"&gt;Motherships&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%27s%20Cradle\"&gt;a massive Death Star-like ship&lt;/a&gt; that sent waves of &lt;a href=\"Saucer\"&gt;Saucer&lt;/a&gt;s along with &lt;a href=\"Abductors\"&gt;Abductors&lt;/a&gt; to attack players and the &lt;a href=\"Rebooted%20Cube\"&gt;Rebooted Cube&lt;/a&gt;'s shield. The shield is eventually destroyed by the onslaught of shots from the waves of &lt;a href=\"Saucer\"&gt;Saucers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%20Queen\"&gt;The Cube Queen&lt;/a&gt; then summoned a Cube Barricade that surrounded &lt;a href=\"Guava%20Fort\"&gt;The Guava Fort&lt;/a&gt;, which then opened and spawned in many &lt;a href=\"Caretaker\"&gt;Caretaker&lt;/a&gt;s while &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Anomalies\"&gt;Sideways Bubbles&lt;/a&gt; appeared all over &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;The Island&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Abductors\"&gt;Abductors&lt;/a&gt; were seen destroying several &lt;a href=\"Named%20Locations\"&gt;POI&lt;/a&gt;s in the background, while the &lt;a href=\"Caretaker\"&gt;Caretakers&lt;/a&gt; were attempting to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Rebooted%20Cube\"&gt;Rebooted Cube&lt;/a&gt; which successfully fought back. An &lt;a href=\"Abductors\"&gt;Abductor&lt;/a&gt; then flew over the &lt;a href=\"Rebooted%20Cube\"&gt;Rebooted Cube&lt;/a&gt; and zapped it with a beam while The Loopers, who had their weapons taken away prior, were forced to observe its destruction and watch their comrades finished off one by one by the Red Saucers that had disarmed them. Afterwards, the screen cuts down underground, to &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis leads to a cutscene inside the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt;'s base, where it is revealed that &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt; has been captured by &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt;, who plans to execute him for treason. Before she can do that, &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; arrives, eliminating an &lt;a href=\"IO%20Guards\"&gt;IO Guard&lt;/a&gt; by punching him in the face and &lt;a href=\"Gunnar\"&gt;Gunnar&lt;/a&gt; by smashing his face onto a computer that controls &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt;' vitals. &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Slone&lt;/a&gt; was surprised by this, thinking he had died in the &lt;a href=\"Zero%20Crisis%20Finale\"&gt;Zero Crisis Finale&lt;/a&gt; event during the formation of &lt;a href=\"The%20Spire\"&gt;The Spire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; then removes his mask, revealing him to be none other than himself. &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Slone&lt;/a&gt; then proceeds to pull out a &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt; and fire at &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in him locking &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Slone&lt;/a&gt; inside the room by punching the door lock.\n&lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; then head into &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt;.

While flying over the Island, &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Visitor\"&gt;The Visitor&lt;/a&gt; spot the surviving Loopers and bring them to safety inside the hidden bunker near &lt;a href=\"Guava%20Fort\"&gt;Guava Fort&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Visitor\"&gt;The Visitor&lt;/a&gt; flies off while &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; follows the Loopers into the bunker, after blowing up the entrance to prevent &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt; from following through.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; then leads the Loopers through the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;IO&lt;/a&gt;'s base as the &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt; begins to vertically rotate, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt; starts to collapse. The Loopers are led to the epicentre of the &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt;, where they meet up with Jones and Foundation, until a massive &lt;a href=\"Caretaker\"&gt;Caretaker&lt;/a&gt; smashes the skylight, causing Loopers to emerge in the ocean, far from the &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt; reaches a 90-degree tilt, &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%20Queen\"&gt;The Cube Queen&lt;/a&gt; teleports away, closing the rift to &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt;, and losing, for now.

It also had showed &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20King%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;The Ice King&lt;/a&gt;'s castle on top of him. The Devourer first created a laser beam around the spot, didn't do any damage to anything. The Devourer then tried to open the vault for the power orb that was inside. Mecha then started to make his appearance from Pressure Plant.\nIt first started with Mecha throwing rockets towards The Devourer, also completely destroying &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20King%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;The Ice King&lt;/a&gt;'s castle. The Devourer then shoots his laser beam towards Mecha, knocking it off it's feet. Mecha got back up, then ran towards The Devourer, and jumped him into the outside river west. Mecha then made his appearance, thought that he was the winner, and The Devourer jumps out and takes Mecha down, biting his rocket fuel and the left arm. Mecha then fought out of it, went to the vault, and was able to get the power orb from inside the vault. Mecha then took the punch with it and knocking down The Devourer. Mecha then grabs the statue from &lt;a href=\"Neo%20Tilted\"&gt;Neo Tilted&lt;/a&gt;, which was found out to be a sword. The sword was used by Mecha, and with a slow-mo scene, Mecha stabbed The Devourer in his single eye, and defeated it.\nMecha then does the &lt;a href=\"No%20Sweat\"&gt;No Sweat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Emote\"&gt;Emote&lt;/a&gt;, which is the &lt;a href=\"Floss\"&gt;Floss&lt;/a&gt; with only one arm, salutes, and flies away to &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath.\nAs a result of the conflict, the Devourer's &lt;a href=\"The%20Devoured\"&gt;skeletal remains&lt;/a&gt; lay on the island, his skeleton became the site of a grove of strange purple/pink plants. This is believed to be caused by a leak from the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Of%20Singularity\"&gt;Sword&lt;/a&gt;, which has a purplish color and blocky texture, likely because it appears to be made from &lt;a href=\"Corruption%20Cubes\"&gt;The Cube's&lt;/a&gt; remains.\nThe most relevant change, however, is the release of &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, which would cause the fabric of Time to collapse and &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt; to return for Season X causing the whole map to go into a black hole for &lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28Chapter%201%29\"&gt;the end of Chapter 1&lt;/a&gt;. When Reality Zero reemerges, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Devoured\"&gt;remains of the Devorer&lt;/a&gt; was placed on &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;. The Mecha is left on the Ice Moon for 11 seasons with &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of Chapter 3: Season 2, The Seven repairs the Mecha for the &lt;a href=\"Collision\"&gt;Collision&lt;/a&gt; event."}

It was located over &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;. The name continues the trend of naming the map after Greek deities beginning with the letter 'A'. \nStoryline.\nArtemis was most likely created at the same time with Apollo after &lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28Chapter%201%29\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt; of Chapter 1 as a result of the Black Hole reorganizing the matter of &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;. The Island remained hidden through as it was on the flip side of Reality Zero. The first hints of Artemis was during the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D3-lP1j6MvW4\"&gt;cinematic trailer&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; took the Zero Point above the roof of The Bridge (Artemis side) and drops it to the Apollo side.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28Chapter%202%29\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt; of Chapter 2, Apollo became severely corrupted from &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt;'s attacks and flipped over by &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt;. After this happens, a mega tsunami generated by the impact of the island flipping over knocks out &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper.&lt;/a&gt; Then they float to &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;. They meet &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, and others sitting near a fire. He offers &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; to sit and tells them about the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; and their abuse of the Zero Point. &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; agrees to join their team against the Imagined Order. &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; sends &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; on quests for the rocket recon missions, to get his \"Wartime Essentials\". He also tries to get in touch with The Paradigm through audio logs. They are found in &lt;a href=\"Shifty%20Shafts\"&gt;Shifty Shafts&lt;/a&gt; after their Rocket Launches. The Imagined Order's first two mole teams arrive and a grotto-like structure was built on &lt;a href=\"Pinnacle%20Peak\"&gt;Pinnacle Peak&lt;/a&gt; and serves as the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order's&lt;/a&gt; Base. The Unnamed Investigation Agency arrives also and starts digging up &lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer\"&gt;The Devourer's&lt;/a&gt; skull. The Imagined Order sabotages The Scientist's Rocket. He sends The Looper to get revenge and retrieve the rocket parts. \nIn , The &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; resurfaces from Apollo and declared war on &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt; by launching an Invasion on Artemis, However, not without a fight as &lt;a href=\"Kiara%20K.O.\"&gt;Kiara K.O.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maximilian\"&gt;Maximilian&lt;/a&gt; prepare to defend the Island from IO with help from other Loopers who defected from IO to The Seven and themselves. As IO was attacking more, &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; had also resurfaced from The Bridge and made countermeasures to disable Building and weaken the loopers. Then &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Strange\"&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/a&gt; brought reinforcements and the war for &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; began, The Seven won the war. \nIn , The IO was driven out of the Island for now, and The Seven is victorious, restoring the Island to its former glory. The Loopers celebrate their victory together by taking over IO Locations and vandalizing them to their own liking. Like &lt;a href=\"Command%20Cavern\"&gt;Command Cavern&lt;/a&gt; becoming &lt;a href=\"Rave%20Cave\"&gt;Rave Cave&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Collider\"&gt;The Collider&lt;/a&gt; becoming &lt;a href=\"The%20Glow\"&gt;The Glow&lt;/a&gt;. However, The Zero Point is exposed yet again, but this time it is submerged underwater and is stable, It used its energy to turn the western part from a casual grasslands to a mushroom fantasy-like biome. The roots from the Reality Tree spread across the island in which some areas affected by it when a tree grows from them; rotating out different versions of that location (or just changing them). By the end of the season the roots begin to be drained of power and it sent back to the Reality Tree itself and the locations stop rotating styles.\nIn , the mushroom fantasy-like biome turns to an autumn theme biome. The &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Tree\"&gt;Reality Tree&lt;/a&gt; becomes Defoliated and the flower locus is gone. &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;The Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; is consumed by The Chrome and turned to the &lt;a href=\"Herald%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Herald Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. Some areas with the reality roots are also consumed by chrome as well.\nArtemis lasted a total of 363 days, until it was destroyed by &lt;a href=\"The%20Herald\"&gt;The Herald&lt;/a&gt; during the opening cutscene of &lt;a href=\"Fracture\"&gt;Fracture&lt;/a&gt;.

Though she was neutral at first in the war against her father, &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;, she later joins &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;'s side against &lt;a href=\"The%20Pantheon\"&gt;Gods&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe is a supporting character in , serving as a supporting protagonist in and as well as a minor character in .\nPersonality.\nArtemis cares almost solely about the \"Eternal Hunt\", classifying people as \"hunters\" and \"preys\" and not trusting those who don't abide by the rules of the Hunt. She is proud of her skills and considers herself to be above the other \"hunters.\"\nTimeline.\nBefore Chapter 5.\nThough her relationship with the other Gods are unknown, she and her sister, &lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt; were described as old friends.\n&lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt; contained a constellation symbolizing Artemis, in the form of a bow.\nAfter Pandora's Box was opened, Artemis came along with the other Gods to punish mortals for opening it and releasing the souls of The Underworld. Likely after his defeat at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;, she goes after &lt;a href=\"Oscar\"&gt;Oscar&lt;/a&gt; to hunt him down. She had a neutral stance about the war between &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Loopers\"&gt;mortals&lt;/a&gt;, but Zeus wanted her on his side. &lt;a href=\"The%20Oracle\"&gt;The Oracle&lt;/a&gt; encourages &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; to train to try and impress Artemis and have her on their side before Zeus so they go to talk to her. Artemis, despite viewing positively of Zeus' rulership, agrees to join their rebellion, as she believes Zeus violates the rules of the Eternal Hunt.\nArtemis remained on the Island even after most of &lt;a href=\"The%20Pantheon\"&gt;The Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;'s abandonment from the Island due to the fall of Zeus and finding new domains. She tells &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; that the gods are now free to go their separate ways, and she's happy about the new era of their lives, telling &lt;a href=\"Apollo%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; that he should take a vacation to loosen his spirit after the overworking he had done for so long. She decided to stay, unlike most of her kin, as she began to appreciate the Island, the wasteland, and the loud nature of mortalkind, and now resides on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Mount Olympus&lt;/a&gt;, still wishing to hunt with &lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt; in Hades' absence.\nArtemis is the last of the Pantheon to remain on the Island. She meets up with The Looper and tells them how she has grown too attached to mankind and this Island for her to abandon them as &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt; began his path of conquest. She allows them to know of &lt;a href=\"The%20Society\"&gt;The Society&lt;/a&gt;'s lineage to The Pantheon, but will not give any specific details, for it is not her place to tell. \nReferences.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The medium to high capacity of Assault Rifle magazines means continuous fire can be laid down on targets or structures, allowing for the player to easily break structures or kill an opponent at closer ranges.\nAssault Weapons do not fare well at close ranges due to their low hipfire accuracy and sometimes slow fire-rates. Due to this, other weapons such as &lt;a href=\"Shotguns\"&gt;shotguns&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Submachine%20Guns\"&gt;submachine guns&lt;/a&gt; fill the role better. \nAssault Weapons also contain LMG-type weapons such as the &lt;a href=\"Light%20Machine%20Gun\"&gt;Light Machine Gun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Drum%20Gun\"&gt;Drum Gun&lt;/a&gt;. The Drum Gun is unclear on what type it is so it acts as an SMG and Assault Rifle at the same time.\nList of Weaponry.\nThis list only includes weapons accessible by the player through legitimate methods.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n!Name\n!Image\n!Rarities\n!Ammo Type\n!Season\n!Description\n!Name\n!Image\n!Rarities\n!Ammo Type\n!Season\n!Description\n!Name\n!Image\n!Rarities\n!Ammo Type\n!Season\n!Description\n!Name\n!Image\n!Rarities\n!Ammo Type\n!Season\n!Description\n!Name\n!Image\n!Rarities\n!Ammo Type\n!Season\n!Description\n!Name\n!Image\n!Rarities\n!Ammo Type\n!Season\n!Description\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Many forces had sought to destroy &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; which, if successful, would result in the destruction the island. This included &lt;a href=\"Corruption%20Cubes\"&gt;Kevin the Cube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer\"&gt;The Devourer&lt;/a&gt;, and more. The Zero Point was contained in a structure called &lt;a href=\"The%20Vault\"&gt;The Vault&lt;/a&gt;, which was directly underneath a location called &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt;. The Vault also contained several items which had previously been removed. During &lt;a href=\"The%20Unvaulting%20Event\"&gt;The Unvaulting&lt;/a&gt;, players managed to access The Vault and could choose a single weapon to \u201cunvault\u201d.\nWhile The Unvaulting was taking place, a character known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Prisoner\"&gt;The Prisoner&lt;/a&gt; took the opportunity to strike the island with a volcanic eruption. This eruption destroyed two locations (&lt;a href=\"Retail%20Row\"&gt;Retail Row&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Tilted%20Towers%23Chapter%201\"&gt;Tilted Towers&lt;/a&gt;) and awakened &lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer\"&gt;The Devourer&lt;/a&gt; from its slumber beneath &lt;a href=\"Polar%20Peak\"&gt;Polar Peak&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs &lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer\"&gt;The Devourer&lt;/a&gt; was now on the loose, the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; was forced to leave The Vault and take over &lt;a href=\"Pressure%20Plant\"&gt;Pressure Plant&lt;/a&gt;. From there, they created the &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Mecha&lt;/a&gt;, which was to be used to defend the island from the Devourer. After weeks of preparation, &lt;a href=\"Singularity\"&gt;Singularity\u2019s&lt;/a&gt; Mecha was ready. In the event known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Final%20Showdown\"&gt;The Final Showdown&lt;/a&gt;, The Mecha and the Devourer fought. Eventually, the Mecha had won, but in the aftermath of the battle, the Zero Point was fully exposed.\nAfter the Zero Point's explosion caused a pause in time which also brought along a paused &lt;a href=\"The%20Meteor\"&gt;Meteor&lt;/a&gt; in the sky, the character known as The Scientist built &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Zones\"&gt;Rift Zones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Rocket\"&gt;The Rocket&lt;/a&gt; to re-contain The Zero Point along with 6 other rockets, causing a Black Hole which sucked up all of &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn , &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href=\"Time%20Machine\"&gt;Time Machine&lt;/a&gt; travels back to an alternative 2018's Athena with multiple altered season events. During &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Bang\"&gt;The Big Bang&lt;/a&gt;, the Rocket (with an attached time machine with it) played out the events of The End, which ultimately led to the Island suffering the same fate.\nAthena lasted a total of 747 (777 if counted ) days before &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; reorganized it into the new islands (&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;) during &lt;a href=\"The%20End\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt;.\nMap.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nLocations in Athena.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

She was hired for heist work in , and worked with &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; to investigate artifacts in . She has positive - albeit mostly professional - relations with many other recurring &lt;a href=\"Character%20Collection%20Book\"&gt;characters&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Fortnite\"&gt;Fortnite&lt;/a&gt;, and has remained a mainstay in the revolving cast of people in the &lt;a href=\"Lore%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;storyline&lt;/a&gt;. Aura's current whereabouts are unknown.\nPersonality.\nAura is an inquisitive and determined hunter for treasure and valuables, whose skills are known and respected enough to warrant the attention of numerous &lt;a href=\"https%3A//tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaperCrew\"&gt;Caper Crews&lt;/a&gt;. She has a conflicted moral compass between what she believes is right, in contrast to her criminalistic track record. She is a cooperative partner to those she works with, and is an ally and friend among those she has mutual respect with.\nHistory.\nSeason 8.\nAura and her counterpart/associate, &lt;a href=\"Guild\"&gt;Guild&lt;/a&gt;, have appeared on the island &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;. For a long while, she is known as a treasure hunting deviant, often found working with Guild.\nChapter 4: Season 1.\nAura and Guild have split paths on her most recent job - a heist she invested in, and was hired for, by &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Card\"&gt;Wild Card&lt;/a&gt;. Against the advice of others, Aura is hired by Wild Card during a &lt;a href=\"Most%20Wanted\"&gt;season of heists&lt;/a&gt;, only for Wild Card dismissing her out of hand.\nAfter that she joined the Most Wanted to get revange on Wild Card, by robbing &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Blooded\"&gt;his faction&lt;/a&gt;'s vaults \nChapter 4: Season 3.\nReturning into the limelight, Aura steps away from her history of thieving in search of hidden treasure. After picking up rumors of a powerful object &lt;a href=\"Trace\"&gt;Trace&lt;/a&gt; had found, she &lt;a href=\"Snapshots%20Quests\"&gt;goes in search&lt;/a&gt; of the item with the help of &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout the season, Aura travels around &lt;a href=\"Asteria\"&gt;the island&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in the newly uncovered &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20Biome\"&gt;Jungle Biome&lt;/a&gt;, charting maps and analyzing clues to uncover the &lt;a href=\"Chalice%20of%20Cubetastrophe\"&gt;Chalice of Cubetastrophe&lt;/a&gt;, in order to prevent it to find a wielder and &lt;a href=\"Snapshots%20Quests%23Dialogue\"&gt;destroy the island.&lt;/a&gt; \nChapter 4: Season 4.\nShe has remained out of the heisting game due to her adventures with hunting artifacts.\nLEGO: Fortnite.\nIn a discussion with &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;, she reveals that she often dreams of herself collaborating with &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;another explorer&lt;/a&gt; to find a chalice whose name she doesn't remember. In her dream, she says that once they discover the chalice, they discover a \"&lt;a href=\"Orelia\"&gt;Golden Ghost Lady&lt;/a&gt;\" living inside. This dream refers to her search for the &lt;a href=\"Chalice%20of%20Cubetastrophe\"&gt;Chalice of Cubetastrophe&lt;/a&gt;, however it seems that she has completely forgotten and that only scraps of memories appear through her dreams. This leaves us thinking about her true mental state when she searched for the Chalice as well as the true fate of the Chalice itself, which she had assured to entrust to one of her contacts to seal it back to .\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Chests will often be guarded or in the vicinity of &lt;a href=\"Monsters\"&gt;Monsters&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey can be interacted with by the player to open them. They take a standard amount of time to open. All Chests can be located by the distinctive ambient noise they make, with a &lt;a href=\"Mimic\"&gt;Mimic&lt;/a&gt; making a different sound to the normal ones.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Outlanders\"&gt;Outlander&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Keen%20Eyes\"&gt;Keen Eyes&lt;/a&gt; Class Perk highlights all types of Containers with a glow through structures.\nAppearance.\nChests are small and made of wood, with metal around the outer edges. On the other hand, Safes are much taller and look like a bank vault with a hand-crank door handle on the outside. Other safes may be darker in color and much smaller. Chests and safes will emit a faint beige glow. The valuable chests and safes are usually out of plain sight. Be sure to look high and low as you may encounter these in the most obscure strange places.\nChests.\nChests are scattered around the zone in all missions. If a chest can be heard above the player, it is best to manually navigate up towards it rather than breaking the floor beneath it, because unlike &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Royale\"&gt;Battle Royale&lt;/a&gt;, destroying the floor under a Container causes the loot to disappear.\nStorm Chest.\nStorm Chests are introduced in the &lt;a href=\"Air%20Quotes\"&gt;Air Quotes&lt;/a&gt; Quest in &lt;a href=\"Plankerton\"&gt;Plankerton&lt;/a&gt; and only spawn in &lt;a href=\"Missions%20%28Save%20the%20World%29\"&gt;Missions&lt;/a&gt; of Power Level 28 or above. Upon opening a Storm Chest, a progressive elimination-based objective is triggered, and 3 waves of &lt;a href=\"Monsters%20%28Save%20The%20World%29\"&gt;Monsters&lt;/a&gt; spawn procedurally, timed over a minute. If all 3 waves are completed, contributing players receive and additional reward.\nSafes.\nSafes are usually found in Strange Places or completely enclosed rooms. Golden Large Safes drop an &lt;a href=\"Evolution%20Materials%20Cache\"&gt;Evolution Materials Cache&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"PERK-UP%21\"&gt;Perk Cache&lt;/a&gt;.\nMimics.\nMimics are monsters disguised as Level 3 Chests. While opening, the chest will open faster, make noise, and stretch/squash. Opening the chest spawns a Mimic at that location. Mimics are Lobbers with a Level 3 Chest as their heads. Mimics have high health and can effectively damage or eliminate the player with wase. Successfully defeating a Mimic will reward everyone who is nearby.\nTroll Stash Chest.\nOnly found in &lt;a href=\"Desert\"&gt;Desert&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Route%2099\"&gt;Thunder Route 99&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Town\"&gt;Ghost Town&lt;/a&gt;.

It is a dynamic system of modifying the player, props, and structures.\nChrome-ified.\nPlayers can become chrome-ified via the entry of a &lt;a href=\"Weather\"&gt;Chrome Tornado&lt;/a&gt; or using &lt;a href=\"Chrome%20Splash\"&gt;Chrome Splash&lt;/a&gt;. Being chrome-ified enables players to become a Chrome Blob and move through Chrome Walls.\nChrome Blob.\nPlayers can become a Chrome Blob by pressing the Sprint Button whilst chromed. Being a Chrome Blob allows players to dash in the air or ground, negate fall damage, and become smaller and faster to avoid damage.\nPlayers can transform into a chrome blob whilst chrome at any point, until the chrome state wears off. Dashing as a Chrome Blob uses up the player's energy, like if they were &lt;a href=\"Movement\"&gt;Sprinting&lt;/a&gt;.\nOpponents are able to hurt a player as a Chrome Blob by shooting at them. This will not stop the chrome effect, but pull the players out of the blob.\nPhasing.\nWhen next to a Chrome structure, the player can phase through walls by pressing the jump button. Any vertical structure that is chrome will allow the player to phase through, including opponent structures. Players will know if they can phase when they see an indicator in the centre of their screen, resembling a portal. Chrome Splash can be used to turn a wall structure into a phasable surface.\nPlayers can also dash into a chrome surface as Chrome Blob to phase through it.\nFire.\nPlayers who are chrome-ified are immune to damage from &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; whilst the effect is present. Items which deal damage but later create fire such as &lt;a href=\"Firefly%20Jar\"&gt;Firefly Jars&lt;/a&gt; will still hurt the player on impact.\nHealing.\nPlayers who are chrome-ified will heal around 1 health every 2.5 seconds.\nChrome Objects.\nChrome has unique properties that are only present for objects that are not the player.\nStructures.\nChrome Splash can be used to turn a wall structure into a phasable surface, and when this occurs the structure will slowly heal itself over time as if it were near a &lt;a href=\"Campfire\"&gt;Campfire&lt;/a&gt;. Chrome structures are also immune to fire, meaning Chrome Splash can stop a structure from burning and heal said structure.

They heal the vehicle for 300HP per second, and refuel the vehicle for 20 fuel per second. The driver does not need to remain within the vehicle while the refuelling and repairing process happens, and can happen even if the driver did not place the vehicle on the service station manually, such as through the &lt;a href=\"Vehicles\"&gt;vehicle&lt;/a&gt; being pushed by another vehicle or explosion.\nService stations contain a fuel pump located on the left side of the pad on the ground. The pump can be shot at, and when it's health falls below half it will begin to emit a high-pitched whistling sound and begin burning. If undamaged further, it will explode after 4 seconds. The pump can be made to explode immediately by further depleting it's health. This functionality is identical to the &lt;a href=\"Gas%20Pump\"&gt;gas pumps&lt;/a&gt; the service stations largely replaced. The explosion, and subsequent fire, will damage all nearby players, &lt;a href=\"vehicles\"&gt;vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"NPCs\"&gt;NPCs&lt;/a&gt; and structures.\nLocations.\nService stations can be found at all gas stations located in the map, along with Wastelander outposts and some POIs.
