Midas, seeing his potential, recruits him as the second member of &lt;a href=\"The%20First%20Shadows\"&gt;The First Shadows&lt;/a&gt;. Him, &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Wolf\"&gt;The Burning Wolf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sierra\"&gt;Sierra&lt;/a&gt; were the first members of &lt;a href=\"SHADOW\"&gt;SHADOW&lt;/a&gt; and Midas' first operatives. Midas trusts Chaos Agent enough to let him run &lt;a href=\"SHADOW\"&gt;SHADOW&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%20X\"&gt;Season X&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was on a movie poster in &lt;a href=\"Gotham%20City\"&gt;Gotham City&lt;/a&gt; named \"The Final Reckoning\", alongside &lt;a href=\"Teef\"&gt;Teef&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Catrina\"&gt;Catrina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Willow\"&gt;Willow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the leader of &lt;a href=\"SHADOW\"&gt;A.L.T.E.R&lt;/a&gt;, a small division of SHADOW agents, he lead the war against &lt;a href=\"GHOST\"&gt;E.G.O.&lt;/a&gt; and created an army of &lt;a href=\"Rippley%20vs%20Sludge\"&gt;Sludges&lt;/a&gt; out of Slurp to act as soldiers. He then sent them to hunt down Rippley, a rogue Sludge created in &lt;a href=\"Slurpy%20Swamp\"&gt;Slurpy Swamp&lt;/a&gt;. He watched the entire battle from his &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Rising\"&gt;lair&lt;/a&gt;. He seems to have done an experiment on &lt;a href=\"8-Ball%20vs%20Scratch\"&gt;Scratch&lt;/a&gt;, corrupting his body.\nWhile Chaos Agent isn\u2019t physically seen during this season, it\u2019s assumed he continued to lead SHADOW during the infighting of &lt;a href=\"Midas%27%20Crew\"&gt;Midas' Crew&lt;/a&gt;. He would later create Slurp-Human hybrids known as the &lt;a href=\"Slurp%20Legends%20Pack\"&gt;Slurp Legends&lt;/a&gt;. The experiments go mad and get obsessed over &lt;a href=\"Slurp%20Juice\"&gt;Slurp&lt;/a&gt;, seeing it as a deity.\nHe is not seen again until the release of the &lt;a href=\"Double%20Agent%20Pack\"&gt;Double Agent Pack&lt;/a&gt; where his body is now golden. He infiltrated &lt;a href=\"GHOST\"&gt;GHOST&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Double%20Agent%20Wildcard\"&gt;Wildcard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Double%20Agent%20Hush\"&gt;Hush&lt;/a&gt; as double agents for &lt;a href=\"SHADOW\"&gt;SHADOW&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs SHADOW and GHOST went dark, limited only to offering their mercenary services and acting in the shadows, Chaos Agent went into hiding.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cosmic%20Summer\"&gt;Cosmic Summer&lt;/a&gt; ends, &lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt; gives control of his &lt;a href=\"Midas%27%20Crew\"&gt;Crew&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Brutus\"&gt;Brutus&lt;/a&gt;. Chaos Agent continues to lead SHADOW.\nHe and several other SHADOW agents were recruited as mercenaries to increase the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt;. In the Story Trailer, he attacks and gets eliminated by &lt;a href=\"Kiara%20K.O.\"&gt;Kiara K.O.&lt;/a&gt;. After the end of the conflict with The Seven, he disappeared again without a trace.\nChaos Agent reappears in the form of &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Double%20Agent\"&gt;Chaos Double Agent&lt;/a&gt; as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Blooded\"&gt;Cold Blooded&lt;/a&gt; syndicate; he protects the vault within &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Slabs\"&gt;Shattered Slabs&lt;/a&gt;. However after the vaults of the Cold Blooded Syndicate were robbed by the Most Wanted, he disappeared and was later replaced by &lt;a href=\"Highcard\"&gt;Highcard&lt;/a&gt;. It's hinted that he was not loyal to Cold Blooded and was acting as a double agent for another organization.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Explorer\"&gt;Chaos Explorer&lt;/a&gt; he seemed to be searching for something in the deepest depths. He gave a mission to &lt;a href=\"Stingray\"&gt;Stingray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Purradise%20Meowscles\"&gt;Purradise Meowscles&lt;/a&gt;, two SHADOW agents, before going back into hiding.\nMidas escapes from &lt;a href=\"The%20Underworld\"&gt;The Underworld&lt;/a&gt; and Brutus gives control of the &lt;a href=\"Midas%27%20Crew\"&gt;Crew&lt;/a&gt; back to him. Chaos Agent presumably continues to lead SHADOW and remains in hiding.\nChaos Agent is captured by &lt;a href=\"Megalo%20Don\"&gt;Megalo Don&lt;/a&gt;, who then throws him out the door of the &lt;a href=\"Brutal%20Beachhead\"&gt;Leviathan Boat&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, Chaos Agent quickly runs off and escapes.\nIn the season trailer, Chaos Agent is seen fighting for &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doctor Doom&lt;/a&gt;.\nReferences.\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Vinderman was a scientist and the founder of &lt;a href=\"Vindertech\"&gt;Vindertech&lt;/a&gt;, along with his partner, &lt;a href=\"Desiree\"&gt;Desiree&lt;/a&gt;. Vinderman is presumed to be responsible for much of the technology featured in the game, including weapons, BluGlo technology, Storm Shields, and numerous robotic AI characters. \nPrior to the events of Save the World, he somehow became aware of &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt; and tried to use dangerous technology to prevent it. His sudden change in behavior ultimately caused Desiree to abandon him in disgust. Vinderman then created a robot assistant named &lt;a href=\"Ray\"&gt;Ray&lt;/a&gt; as Desiree\u2019s replacement. \nVinderman tried to recruit the help of &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Wool\"&gt;Steel Wool&lt;/a&gt; members (in addition to being musicians, all of the members were prominent scientists), including &lt;a href=\"Lars\"&gt;Lars&lt;/a&gt;, in order to prepare for the coming struggle against the Storm, but, like Desiree, they largely ignored his warnings. \nVinderman\u2019s attempt to stop the Storm\u2019s arrival ultimately failed, and he retreated to his lab in &lt;a href=\"Plankerton\"&gt;Plankerton&lt;/a&gt; where he eventually died while working on an experimental \"singularity pulse bomb.\"\nIn the mission &lt;a href=\"I%27m%20Probably%20Dead\"&gt;I\u2019m Probably Dead&lt;/a&gt;, Ray and &lt;a href=\"Homebase\"&gt;Homebase&lt;/a&gt; explore the ruins of his lab where they find that Vinderman had made an AI copy of himself before his death.\nLater on in &lt;a href=\"Canny%20Valley\"&gt;Canny Valley&lt;/a&gt;, The &lt;a href=\"Commander\"&gt;Commander&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"V%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;builds a memorial&lt;/a&gt; for Dr. Vinderman to comfort Ray, who was still mourning his death.\nIt is discovered that Vinderman's AI was being unknowingly carried inside of &lt;a href=\"SEE-Bot\"&gt;SEE-Bot&lt;/a&gt;, so the Homebase heroes track down SEE-Bot, whom Ray had sent on a long journey out of annoyance. Eventually, Homebase and Desiree head to Dr. Vinderman's mansion in order &lt;a href=\"Have%20You%20Tried%20Turning%20It%20On%20And%20Off%20Again%3F\"&gt;activate Vinderman\u2019s AI&lt;/a&gt;. After the Commander defends the servers from a horde of monsters, The AI activates. It has the same memories and personality as Vinderman, but isn\u2019t aware of the circumstances of his death. The AI plays a crucial role in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Royal%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;fight&lt;/a&gt; with the Storm King, but its core begins to melt down, and the AI shuts down shortly after &lt;a href=\"How%20I%20Wonder%20What%20You%20Are\"&gt;helping motivate&lt;/a&gt; Ray and delivering Dr. Vinderman's last message: \"Commander, there is a solution. It is written on the wall.\"\nWhether Dr. Vinderman exists in Battle Royale is unknown. Should Dr. Vinderman exist in &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt;, it would most likely be a &lt;a href=\"Snapshots\"&gt;Snapshot&lt;/a&gt; as the original Dr. Vinderman died."}

It is available during the &lt;a href=\"Flannel%20Falls\"&gt;Flannel Falls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hexsylvania\"&gt;Hexsylvania&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ventures\"&gt;Venture Seasons&lt;/a&gt;. Dungeons are located towards the south of &lt;a href=\"Plankerton\"&gt;Plankerton&lt;/a&gt;, west of &lt;a href=\"Twine%20Peaks\"&gt;Twine Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, and south-west of the &lt;a href=\"Ventures\"&gt;Venture Zone&lt;/a&gt; as shown on the Map.\nGameplay.\nDungeons modes are based on dungeon crawlers. They are semi-roguelike, where each game the basic layout remains the same but not the placement of the objective items. There are 5 Dungeons with 4 levels each and the overground. In each level except the boss level, players need to find a Shadow Key, and destroy 3 to 4 Monoliths for a Husk Key, to advance to the next level while eliminating &lt;a href=\"Monsters%20%28Save%20The%20World%29\"&gt;Monsters&lt;/a&gt; and avoiding dungeon traps and hazards.\nPlayers cannot craft weapons and traps, instead they must find them by breaking urns and searching for Chests. \nWhen a player loses all their &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Save%20the%20World%29\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;, they turn into a Ghost (similar to the effects of a &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Stone\"&gt;Shadow Stone&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Royale\"&gt;Battle Royale&lt;/a&gt;). The downed players need to be revived at a Cursed Statue, which can only be used once per level. A Cursed Statue is able to revive multiple players at once. If all players become a Ghost, or if a Solo player dies and there are no unused Cursed Statues, the mission fails.\nThe final level of each Dungeon is a boss battle, with usually a tougher version of a Mist Monster &lt;a href=\"Mini-Bosses\"&gt;Mini-Boss&lt;/a&gt;. Defeating the boss clears the dungeon and grants Victory. \nDungeon Hazards.\nEach dungeon has traps and hazards.\nDungeons.\nclass=\"fandom-table\"\n!Dungeon\n!Unique Hazards\n!Boss\n!Unlocked After\nThe Crypts\nVlad &lt;br&gt; \nN/A\nThe Inferno\nSinge &lt;br&gt; \nThe Crypts\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Lab%20%28Dungeon%29The%20Lab\"&gt;The Lab (Dungeon)The Lab&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Hyde\"&gt;Hyde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt; \nThe Crypts\nThe Grotto\nSog, Murk, Flood and Surge &lt;br&gt; \nThe Inferno\nThe Labyrinth\nThe Pusher &lt;br&gt; \nThe Grotto\nGallery.\n= Lore =\n&lt;a href=\"Dungeon\"&gt;Dungeon&lt;/a&gt; is in charge of the four dungeons. He challenges you to beat the dungeons as there had been no successful attempts in the past. He is confident that the player won't be able to make it out alive. The Shadow Key on the overground level is dropped by an unnamed previous Dungeoneer who didn't make it down at all.\nThe Crypts\n &lt;br&gt;\nWhile the other three Dungeons have &lt;a href=\"Dungeon\"&gt;Dungeon&lt;/a&gt; narrating a backstory of some sorts, Crypts has him primarily following along through the player's journey and reacting to their actions throughout the adventure, mocking them and demotivating them along the way.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe Inferno\n &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Dungeon\"&gt;Dungeon&lt;/a&gt; has prepared endless pits of lava and 'despair' for the dungeoneers. This time, he is filled with \"bubbling molten rocks\" and is adamant onto feasting upon interlopers. His &lt;a href=\"Monsters%20%28Save%20The%20World%29\"&gt;monsters&lt;/a&gt; have assured him they will not fail in keeping the player down, and he's right to an extent. Husks in the lower floors pose a greater threat than in the previous Dungeon, transforming into &lt;a href=\"Elements\"&gt;fire elementals&lt;/a&gt; upon stepping into the lava pools. Structures built by the dungeoneers burn and slowly lose health until they break due to the Dungeon's firey curse.\n&lt;br&gt;\nSinge awaits the dungeoneers at the boss level. He is a &lt;a href=\"Elements\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Smasher\"&gt;Smasher&lt;/a&gt; who fell into a pool of lava, then into an indoor pool of magma. After enduring \"a couple of hard years,\" he returns more berserk and crazier than before. He is defeated.\nThe Grotto\n &lt;br&gt;\nThe Grotto holds special significance for &lt;a href=\"Dungeon\"&gt;Dungeon&lt;/a&gt;, who narrates his story as an adventurer there. Dungeon's dialogue and storytelling adjust based on whether the player goes in alone (solo) or with a team, aligning with the player's discoveries as he recounts them as his own.\n&lt;br&gt;\nDungeon explains that he and his group embarked on a summer journey that ended up changing them forever. As they progressed through the Grotto, they discovered that the \"horrifying campfire stories\" from their childhood were true. Deep within the Grotto, they found an ancient Aztec temple, and further down, a pirate ship and its plunder. None of Dungeon's group remembered why they continued their journey into the depths. Towards the end, they confronted the Grotto's lurkers: Water Blasters named Sog, Murk, Flood, and Surge. The group began to take them down one by one, each defeat causing a dangerous \"water sprout\" to appear. In the end, none of the lurkers remained, and the group returned home with victory.\nThe Labyrinth\n &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Dungeon\"&gt;Dungeon&lt;/a&gt; has prepared an \"insanity labyrinth\" for the dungeoneers this time. Every moment a person spends in the Labyrinth causes them physical pain, slowly draining their life force. As an oversight, Dungeon left talismans scattered across The Dungeon that provide temporary immunity from the curse.&lt;br&gt;\nThe first wing of the underground labyrinth mansion was built over two hundred years ago. Sir Langston Rabe commissioned it shortly after inventing rabies. When his invention spread more rapidly than anticipated, he pioneered a radical building style designed to confuse rabid raccoons. It was believed to be very effective.&lt;br&gt;\nAfter Sir Rabe passed away, the mansion was purchased by the Float Planet Society and the second wing of the mansion was built. They were a secretive cult that eschewed modern science and did not believe in gravity. The cult disbanded after an unfortunate event involving stairs.&lt;br&gt;\nThe third wing of the mansion was built by Rabe's great-granddaughter. From her diary, it was concluded that she was not driven by madness but was too stubborn to admit she was lost and tried to build her way out of the situation.&lt;br&gt;\nThe final boss is a &lt;a href=\"Smasher\"&gt;Smasher&lt;/a&gt; named The Pusher. He loves to launch dungeoneers around and separate them from their group during the battle while also frequently sucking them inwards like the Vortex modifier.\nThe Lab\n &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Agent%20%28Hero%29\"&gt;Chaos Agent&lt;/a&gt; has heard about &lt;a href=\"The%20Good%20Doctor\"&gt;The Good Doctor&lt;/a&gt;'s scientific research aimed at solving the husk problem. However, rumors have spread that his methods are unethical and that he may be planning to create human-husk hybrids. Acting on behalf of the Villainous Council, Chaos Agent enlists the dungeon-goers to thwart these Chaotic Good schemes. The journey begins with what appears to be a full tour of the lab facility. A presentation is held out on the last floor, where The Good Doctor and Hyde are located. As the Dungeoneers explore the abandoned lab, The Good Doctor discusses hybridization and the continuation of the human species through human-husk hybrids. On the final underground level, during the presentation, Chaos Agent confronts the duo and reveals that the Villainous Council has reviewed their plans and deemed them a threat to humanity's survival. Hyde then takes over The Good Doctor and battles the dungeoneers. The dungeoneers sabotage the electrical coils, attuned to Hyde and the Doctor's physiology, by adding BluGlo to them. This weakens Hyde significantly, and he is then taken down by the dungeoneers.\n= Audio =\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Due to this, the item cannot be thrown very far by the player, only landing a few meters away with an optimal throw. Dynamite has a large explosive radius however, but will only detonate after its 5 second fuse has run out, a fuse which starts upon throwing or preparing to throw the item. As such, the Dynamite can be 'cooked' allowing for timed explosion or potentially an air-burst. This comes at the downside of hurting yourself if held for too long.\nDynamite can also deal damage to players, but is weaker than &lt;a href=\"Grenades\"&gt;Grenades&lt;/a&gt;, and due to its long fuse time and throw distance, it is not recommended for this use.\nObtained.\n\"From when the item was last obtainable in Season 8:\"\nStats.\nDynamite deals 100 damage to opponents and vehicles.\nItem ID.\nDynamite is referred to as TNT in the files.\n&lt;a href=\"Spy%20Games\"&gt;Spy Games&lt;/a&gt; rarities:"}

They were introduced in &lt;a href=\"Season%205\"&gt;Season 5&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription and Lore.\nThe Cube is a sentient entity that appeared first on August 24, 2018, during Season 5. It appeared near &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20Palms\"&gt;Paradise Palms&lt;/a&gt;, being created from several lightning strikes from the &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;Sideways Rift&lt;/a&gt;, closing it in the process. The Cube is an object of immense power, as it was capable of destroying objects in its path as it rolled towards &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt;, printing powerful runes which reduced gravity, and generated &lt;a href=\"Cube%20Monsters\"&gt;Cube Monsters&lt;/a&gt; from its fragments.\nThe Cubes are the power sources of &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt;, an evil and malicious faction affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Anomalies\"&gt;The Sideways&lt;/a&gt; with an intention to corrupt and destroy &lt;a href=\"The%20Omniverse\"&gt;realities&lt;/a&gt;. The Cubes are all controlled by &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%20Queen\"&gt;The Cube Queen&lt;/a&gt; with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Rebooted%20Cube\"&gt;Rebooted Cube&lt;/a&gt;. Thousands of dormant cubes are stored in a dedicated room in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Mothership\"&gt;Motherships&lt;/a&gt;, used to power the gigantic alien ships.\nThe Cube's origin and birth place seems to be &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%27s%20Cradle\"&gt;The Cube's Cradle&lt;/a&gt;, a massive planet like structure that appeared in Chapter 2 &lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28Chapter%202%29\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt; event.\nIt has taken several forms, but has spent most time as a large &lt;a href=\"Corruption%20Cubes\"&gt;Purple Cube&lt;/a&gt;, which deflects bullets, and hurts players who attempt to go near it, or heals them in the vicinity. During , The &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Cube\"&gt;Golden Cube&lt;/a&gt; and The &lt;a href=\"Rebooted%20Cube\"&gt;Rebooted Cube&lt;/a&gt; are introduced for the first time.\nAfter killing the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20King\"&gt;Storm King&lt;/a&gt;, a cube emerges in a lake and it begins to dissolve similar to how it did during &lt;a href=\"Season%205\"&gt;Season 5&lt;/a&gt;, indicating the Cube was the Storm King.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%205\"&gt;Season 5&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;Sideways Rift&lt;/a&gt; continued to rapidly close up, it suddenly turned purple. Within the next few days, purple &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;storm&lt;/a&gt; lightning bolts began shooting out of the crack, all targeting a hill near &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20Palms\"&gt;Paradise Palms&lt;/a&gt;, containing a large stone rock surrounded by a ring of cacti. Each lightning strike picked off one cacti one-by-one, until a larger lightning bolt destroyed the large rock. The &lt;a href=\"Crack%20Closure\"&gt;Crack Closure&lt;/a&gt; event occurred on 24th August 2018, with a gigantic storm lightning bolt striking out of the rift, lasting for around 10 seconds. When it was over, the Crack in the Sky closed. then The Cube was formed. Though it first appeared to be a stationary object, it began to move at a rate of one revolution every 1 hour and 43 minutes. It was unclear where it would end up. During its journey around the map, The Cube printed seven runes with anti-gravity domes surrounding. Throughout the final three weeks of Season 5, the cube continued to print these runes.\nAfter finishing this process, The Cube destroyed one of the buildings in &lt;a href=\"Tilted%20Towers\"&gt;Tilted Towers&lt;/a&gt;. The sporting goods store was hit by a meteorite and was just in the final stages of reopening. The Cube then proceeded to the edge of &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt; on September 19, 2018. The Cube appeared to dissolve, turning Loot Lake in a purple-pink gelatinous state with properties akin to The Cube itself, such as becoming bouncy.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%206\"&gt;Season 6&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the beginning of &lt;a href=\"Season%206\"&gt;Season 6&lt;/a&gt;, it was revealed that The Cube was still intact, as it rose from the waters, taking the cabin and island in the center of the lake with it, forming the &lt;a href=\"Floating%20Island\"&gt;Floating Island&lt;/a&gt;. This created a large hole in the lake exposing the bridge to &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, a vortex in the middle. After just two days of the island rising, The Cube began to move the island to each of the runes it had printed in Season 5. After getting energy from all runes, they dropped to the ground and the island returned to Loot Lake. A portal to &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt; was formed above, which began to expand until it covered the entire island. On October 24, 2018, the first day of &lt;a href=\"Fortnitemares\"&gt;Fortnitemares 2018,&lt;/a&gt; The Cube exploded the floating island into multiple pieces, the Cube still intact. Following the explosion, The Cube fragments that had been growing on the island had been sent all over the map, which released The Cube monsters.\nFrom this day until November 4. The Cube began to crack. On November 3, it began to drip its nectar into &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, until the final drip. On November 4, 2018, The Cube started to spin rapidly, which led to a white flash, and The Cube splitting apart. After the flash, players were teleported to &lt;a href=\"The%20In-Between\"&gt;The In-Between&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after, a rift formed, and took shape of a butterfly, which then multiplied, and came to every player still alive. A cut-scene showed up, where the player put out their finger, and the butterfly would land on the finger, and it got teleported back to the map through a rift. &lt;a href=\"Leaky%20Lake\"&gt;Leaky Lake&lt;/a&gt; appears to be completely new, and the &lt;a href=\"Cube%20Monsters\"&gt;Cube Monsters&lt;/a&gt; were gone.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%207\"&gt;Season 7&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Storm\"&gt;Ice Storm&lt;/a&gt; event, &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20King%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;The Ice King&lt;/a&gt; uses a small shard of the Cube to summon &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Legion\"&gt;Ice Legion&lt;/a&gt; and freeze the island in order to stop &lt;a href=\"Polar%20Peak\"&gt;Polar Peak&lt;/a&gt; from melting.\nIn Save the World, &lt;a href=\"Homebase\"&gt;Homebase&lt;/a&gt; defeats the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20King\"&gt;Storm King&lt;/a&gt;, leaving behind a Corruption Cube which sinks into the water.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%20X\"&gt;Season X&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Floating%20Island\"&gt;Floating Island&lt;/a&gt; from an alternate reality came through a &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Beacon\"&gt;Rift Beacon&lt;/a&gt;. it didn't do anything after that except circle the island aimlessly. Later in the season, Cube memorials appeared at &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt; and on the mountain Kevin was created.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"The%20End\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; and the creation of &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;, The Floating Island was destroyed, but The Cube was conserved. Following the reconstruction of the island by &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, it was placed into a dormant state and underneath Building 2 of &lt;a href=\"Steamy%20Stacks\"&gt;Steamy Stacks&lt;/a&gt;, a power station which uses The Cube to generate electricity. The facility is run by &lt;a href=\"Kevolution%20Energy\"&gt;Kevolution Energy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Spire Artifact is a small piece of the Spire's core, it emits Cube's runes. The Spire's core was originally made of chromium, how it got corrupted is unknown. Seeing visions of the future in his dreams, &lt;a href=\"Raz\"&gt;Raz&lt;/a&gt; ended up on the island after years and years of research, and got too close to The Spire Artifact only to make him corrupted with new powers. &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt; notice his power and arrives at the island.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Mothership\"&gt;The Mothership&lt;/a&gt; used the Cubes' power to destroy &lt;a href=\"The%20Spire\"&gt;The Spire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt; host the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Tour\"&gt;Rift Tours&lt;/a&gt; so they could scan the memories of the loopers, to learn about &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; while taking them through multiple realities around &lt;a href=\"The%20Omniverse\"&gt;The Omniverse&lt;/a&gt;. the &lt;a href=\"Floating%20Island\"&gt;Floating Island&lt;/a&gt; and the Cube and be seen in the tunnel. During the live event, &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt; was revealed to have possessed a corruption cube in one of its rooms.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; deactivates it using &lt;a href=\"Alien%20Jetpack\"&gt;Alien Backpack&lt;/a&gt; and arms the bombs, she betrays the loopers by sealing them in with the cube. &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Loopers&lt;/a&gt; reboot it, turning it blue, which causes the room to rise up into a chamber containing thousands of dormant corruption cubes stored inside with a golden cube at the center. After the bombs detonate, the mothership is destroyed, and debris and cubes rain down onto the map, causing devastation.\nA mini version of the Cube can be found in &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt;'s Science Lab, moving in a random route. IO Agents can feed it and play with it like a pet.\nFollowing the Mothership's destruction, five purple cubes, one golden cube, and a blue cube land around the island. All of the purple cubes are located at the Abductor Crash sites, and the surrounding areas have been corrupted by their presence. The Golden Cube is found near &lt;a href=\"Holly%20Hedges\"&gt;Holly Hedges&lt;/a&gt;, while The Blue Cube lands near &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Cod\"&gt;Camp Cod&lt;/a&gt;, creating &lt;a href=\"Friendly%20Forest\"&gt;Friendly Forest&lt;/a&gt; around itself. The rest of the cubes seen during are likely still inside the main Mothership wreckage located beyond the border of the island. Less than a week after the launch of Season 8, The Golden Cube begins moving. By the time of Week 2, each of the Purple Cubes have moved at least once, The Golden Cube has moved over 50 times, while the Blue Cube has not moved at all. \nThe Golden Cube visits the &lt;a href=\"Believer%20Beach%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Believer Beach&lt;/a&gt; cube and commences the first Awakening event, levitating into the air and charging the cube with an energy beam. This forces the Purple Cube to create six smaller purple cubes around itself. The process also seems to have stimulated the Cube to roll much more frequently, and towards &lt;a href=\"The%20Aftermath\"&gt;The Aftermath&lt;/a&gt;. The smaller cubes also line up behind the main cube and follow it. All of the purple cubes also spread corruption as they roll. At &lt;a href=\"Steamy%20Stacks\"&gt;Steamy Stacks&lt;/a&gt;, the original Kevin from the Chapter 1 island awoke, breaking out of containment upon sensing the presence of the gold cube. The Golden Cube charges it, but unlike the others, that particular cube does not produce any smaller cubes. The Golden Cube rolls around the entire island, charging up all the six purple cubes (including the Steamy Stacks Cube). As they roll, the purple cubes leave a large trail of corruption stretching to their original starting points.At this stage, all of them (excluding The Blue Cube) are now active and heading towards &lt;a href=\"The%20Aftermath\"&gt;The Aftermath&lt;/a&gt;. On October 12-13, \nThe Golden Cube arrives at The Aftermath, and levitates directly above the area in a similar fashion to The Awakening events. On October 19, all six purple cubes simultaneously reach The Aftermath, and break apart into smaller pieces to form &lt;a href=\"The%20Convergence\"&gt;The Convergence&lt;/a&gt;, a mysterious purple structure surrounding The Golden Cube, with an unknown purpose. The baby cubes created by each purple cube was likely a method of adding extra cube material to The Convergence structure when it was created, as the purple cubes did not lose their mass during their creation. Following the convergence, &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%20Queen\"&gt;Cube Queen&lt;/a&gt;, the mysterious leader of &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt;, was brought to the island, and is floating above The Golden Cube in a bubble.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28Chapter%202%29\"&gt;The End (Chapter 2)&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Rebooted%20Cube\"&gt;Rebooted Cube&lt;/a&gt; teleported to &lt;a href=\"Guava%20Fort\"&gt;Guava Fort&lt;/a&gt; and produced a shield around it to protect the Loopers. &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%20Queen\"&gt;The Cube Queen&lt;/a&gt; used &lt;a href=\"The%20Pyramid\"&gt;The Pyramid&lt;/a&gt; to shot a beam of corrupted energy into the sky, opening a massive rift to &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt;, revealing hundreds of &lt;a href=\"The%20Mothership\"&gt;Motherships&lt;/a&gt; powered by &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Cube\"&gt;Golden Cubes&lt;/a&gt;, along with the Cube's Cradle. They quickly overrun the entire island. a golden colored Abductor flew over the Rebooted Cube and fired a beam that destroyed the Rebooted Cube while the Loopers, who had their weapons taken away prior, were forced to watch its destruction. meanwhile in &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; reverses the gyroscopic orientation of the Island causing it to rotate. The Cube Queen goes underwater (possibly teleporting) and The Pyramid is completely submerged once the Island reaches a 90-degree tilt, closing the rift to the Last Reality.\n&lt;a href=\"Universal%20Monsters%20-%20We%20Will%20Be%20Monsters\"&gt;Universal Monsters - We Will Be Monsters&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe reality of universal monsters is being consumed by the colorless void, &lt;a href=\"Frankenstein%27s%20Bride\"&gt;Frankenstein's Bride&lt;/a&gt; and the other monsters teamed up and use the cube's power to restore the colors.\nTrivia.\n=List=\nCube Fragments.\n=Media=\nIn Chapter 1.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

You will gain access to Canny Valley after completing Plankerton questline. The final area you unlock is Twine Peaks. Each area is significantly harder than the last one and more quests are needed for the next area. High V-Buck rewards are more often found from harder areas. In addition to the new mission spots, you will also unlock different types of missions, materials and daily quests as you progress.\nMini-Boss mission rewards include evolution materials, experience, schematics, heroes, perk resources and V-Bucks.\nOn top of the page you can see the current Mini-Boss Mission Alerts including the rewards without launching the game, fetched directly from Save the World servers every 15 minutes. No matter where the V-Buck reward mission is, there will be a lot of people completing it for the free V-Bucks.\nHISTORY OF SAVE THE WORLD MISSION ALERTS.\nThe amount of Mission Alerts available past Stonewood was doubled to six and Mini-Bosses were added to all of them in patch v2.3 and so the name changed to Mini-Boss Mission Alerts. Patch v3.4 refocused Mini-Boss Mission Alerts towards Transform Keys and high-rarity items and removed crafting ingredients from the reward list. These changes seem to raise the V-Bucks mission reward amount from 15-30 to 25-40 V-Bucks. After patch v3.5 Mini-Boss Mission Alerts can no longer be selected in Stonewood and Plankerton if you have not unlocked the mission the alert is attached to but can still access it with a higher-level party. Perk resources were added to the reward pool in patch v4.2. Some events have more than doubled the amount of missions for the duration of the event. Patch v9.00 removed the daily cap of 3 mission alerts and changed the rotation schedule from 6 hours to every 24 hours.\n=EXAMPLE=\nA list of all missions with special rewards on May 18th 2021.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

This is due to updates changing the map and loot pool and that replays are not videos of matches, but more of the server 'recreating' the match as it was played.\nReplay types.\nThere are two types of replays: the personal Replay Client and the tournament Replay Client. \nThe personal Replay Client are replays played from the Career tab and has the following limitations:\nTournament Replay Client are replays of Tournament matches from the Compete tab and does not have any limitations.\nGame HUD differences.\nIn addition to the replay controls there are differences in the Game HUD in the Replay Client:\nSettings.\nBelow is a table of settings when watching a replay:\nLore.\nIn Battle Royale, the Replays are handled by the Archives division of the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt;, they are possibly still working due to the replay client not being disabled.

As you\u2019re holding the rev, the sawblade will spin around so fast that it\u2019ll be hazardous to structures (and somewhat to foes). It\u2019s wise to reserve the &lt;a href=\"Ripsaw%20Launcher\"&gt;Ripsaw Launcher\u2019s&lt;/a&gt; final sawblade for melee action, so that you can keep using the weapon to tear down what\u2019s in your path!"}

They are one of the syndicates from the reality of &lt;a href=\"MEGA%20City\"&gt;MEGA City&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey are a group specialized in water-based abilities and &lt;a href=\"Kinetic%20Blade\"&gt;katana&lt;/a&gt; swordsmanship. They can be easily recognized through their accessories related to oceanic tides. The clan's ideal is \"Flow like water, cut like ice.\"\nOverview.\nThe River Guard is an ancient clan most known for their water-based beliefs. They were formerly the long-time historic rival of the &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Clan\"&gt;Fox Clan&lt;/a&gt;, until the events of , where the clan had to unite with the other syndicates in order to protect &lt;a href=\"MEGA%20City\"&gt;MEGA City&lt;/a&gt; from outside threats.\nLocations and Members.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nPossible Members.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nHistory.\nUnknown Period of Time.\nThe River Guard was founded in , and later went to war with the &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Clan\"&gt;Fox Clan&lt;/a&gt; after their mask artisans - the ancestors of &lt;a href=\"Daigo\"&gt;Daigo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kendo\"&gt;Kendo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jade\"&gt;Jade&lt;/a&gt; - created &lt;a href=\"Masks%20of%20Power\"&gt;Masks of Power&lt;/a&gt; that nearly destroyed &lt;a href=\"Oninoshima\"&gt;Oninoshima&lt;/a&gt; in an event known as the Shattering War. From that point on, magic was banished and the River Guard became sworn enemies of the &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Clan\"&gt;Fox Clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor unspecified reasons, &lt;a href=\"Stray\"&gt;Stray&lt;/a&gt; left the River Guard and joined the &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Clan\"&gt;Fox Clan&lt;/a&gt;, much to &lt;a href=\"Mizuki\"&gt;Mizuki&lt;/a&gt;'s disliking. His exit only fueled the prolonged fued between the River Guard and their rivals.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;, working for the &lt;a href=\"Peace%20Syndicate\"&gt;Peace Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;, helped unify all Syndicates in &lt;a href=\"MEGA%20City\"&gt;MEGA City&lt;/a&gt;, including the River Guard. Thanks to negotiations with the &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Clan\"&gt;Fox Clan&lt;/a&gt; organized by &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;, their historical conflict was put to an end and they became allies.\nThe River Guard returns to , establishing &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Lake\"&gt;Lost Lake&lt;/a&gt; and settling there. Though they have sustained their mended relationship with the &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Clan\"&gt;Fox Clan&lt;/a&gt; (as &lt;a href=\"Vi\"&gt;Vi&lt;/a&gt; appears to greet &lt;a href=\"Mizuki\"&gt;Mizuki&lt;/a&gt; with no hostility upon entering &lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Blossoms%20Farm\"&gt;Rolling Blossoms Farm&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mizuki\"&gt;Mizuki&lt;/a&gt; reassures &lt;a href=\"Vi\"&gt;Vi&lt;/a&gt; that the guard seeks no trouble, as well as seemingly no longer carrying resentments towards &lt;a href=\"Stray\"&gt;her brother&lt;/a&gt;) - the remergence of magic and elemental masks on the island prompts reflection on their history with the &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Clan\"&gt;Fox Clan&lt;/a&gt; - and the reminder of why the River Guard now tend to keep to themselves.\nAlthough the &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Clan\"&gt;Fox Clan&lt;/a&gt; has their own doubts about their alliance, both groups appear to be keeping the peace and seem open to continuing to do so - should neither overstep their boundaries.\nNotably, &lt;a href=\"Mizuki\"&gt;Mizuki&lt;/a&gt; expresses a disliking towards both &lt;a href=\"Daigo\"&gt;Daigo&lt;/a&gt; alongside his ancestors - likely in relation to the events of the Shattering War."}

They were captured by the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; in . They returned to the island in \nLore.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Season%207\"&gt;Season 7&lt;/a&gt;, a large groups of rocks formed together near the northeast of the island into the shape of a large man. However, he seemed alone and had no purpose. While he began wandering the island, another group of rocks formed together to create a stone lady, who also didn't have much purpose. However, they eventually found each other a distance from each other. They greeted each other by waving. However, they weren't able to meet each other, since a large earthquake occurred and created a large Volcano near where the two were at. The shaking caused them to collapse.\nAlthough it seemed like the story was over from the start of &lt;a href=\"Season%208\"&gt;Season 8&lt;/a&gt;, the stone man and stone lady reformed from the rocks once again. As they tried to reach each other from around the Volcano, the stone man found a flower on the ground and decided to pick it up. The two met up once more, in between them a large amount of lava flowing from the inside of the Volcano. The stone man offered the flower as a gift. Overjoyed from the gift, the stone lady attempted to cross the lava. In fear of what could happen to her, the stone man rushed to her. The stone lady made it to a spot over the lava, awaiting the stone man to drop to her. The stone man began going across his side of the lava, holding tightly to the flower above the lava. The stone lady helped him up and the two became a couple.\nAt the beginning of &lt;a href=\"Season%209\"&gt;Season 9&lt;/a&gt;, the stone couple vanished. As it once again appeared that the story was over, they reappeared on the eastern side of the island within the jungle. There, they began to live, growing flowers and raising a stone child. Sometime after the stone man and lady began to relax, their purpose seemingly fulfilled, the stone child went off on his own adventure to find his purpose. As the stone child explored the jungle, he came across a stone dog hiding. The stone child went to comfort the dog and they became quick friends. Shortly after, the stone family went away again, eventually returning to their work. The stone child began to constantly play in the jungle. The stone dog didn't stay very close to the stone child, but did enjoy being somewhat near him.\nOne day, the stone child fell off the ledge of a cliff, holding on as much as he could. The stone man and stone lady saw him from the farm and began calling out in worry. Luckily, the stone dog ran to the hill just in time to pull the stone child back over the cliff. The stone man and stone lady were relieved and held each others hands. After everything ended well, the stone family and stone dog vanished starting Season 10."}

Rockets are not affected by gravity, and won't drop if they go too far.\nThe Rocket Launcher uses and shoots slow-moving projectile weapon, that cannot inflict headshot damage. It has First Shot Accuracy enabled, but as it is a Rocket Launcher, it is largely irrelevant. There is no damage falloff on the Rocket Launcher's projectiles.\nThe Rocket Launcher can reload whilst being aimed.\nStats.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nWeapon ID.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nThe Rocket Launcher is referred to as Rocket Launcher in the files.\nThe Figment Launcher Rocket is referred to as Launcher Rocket in the files.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nFormer Icons.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Players have the option of racing in ranked or private (unranked) races, whether with friends or by themselves.\nAfter selecting the Rocket Racing playlist, players have the option to toggle the privacy setting between Public and Private and can also select specific tracks. Private races are always unranked, whereas public races are ranked unless a specific track is chosen.\nPrivate races support parties of up to 12 and pit players exclusively against their own party members.\nPublic races support parties of up to 4 and pit players against opponents not in their party. If in a ranked race, the track is randomly chosen out of the selection of tracks available to the highest-ranked party member.\nThere are four main techniques available to players:\nDrifting.\nDrifting is done by making a tight turn, which charges up a speed boost. The longer the drift, the longer the boost after straightening out. A Rocket Drift can be activated by drifting while holding the Rocket Drift button to make even sharper turns and provide an even larger boost.\nJumping and Flying.\nVarious tracks have hazards which slow a player's speed if they hit them. These can be avoid by jumping, or holding down the jump button to fly. Players have a limited charge of jets so can only hold the jump button for a limited time. Tapping the jump button in short bursts allow a player to fly farther, or touching the ground can recharge their jets entirely.\nTurbo.\nAll cars have a Turbo meter that holds up to three charges. Each charge refills over 60 seconds, accelerated by drifting. Each turbo increases the car's speed by 150, with a maximum speed of 900. When the button is pressed again within a 1-2 second window, the turbo can be activated a second time. Saving three charges and then using them in succession can allow players to achieve victory after being stuck in the middle.\nAir Dodging.\nCars can also attach to walls or ceilings while airborne if players indicate a direction while pressing the air dodge button. This can prove useful in avoiding various hazards.\nThe rank tiers in Ranked match those in &lt;a href=\"Ranked\"&gt;Battle Royale&lt;/a&gt;: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Elite, Champion, and Unreal. Bronze through Diamond have three ranks, while Elite, Champion, and Unreal have one.\nFinishing a race grants rank points. The amount of progress gained is based on the placement and current rank.\nIn ranked play, players must climb the ranks to unlock more tracks. Once they reach Diamond I, they'll have access to all tracks.\nIf a player is playing solo, they will be matched against opponents of the same or similar rank as them. However, players will not be matched against real players until they reach Silver I. If they're playing in a party of more than one, they\u2019ll be matched against opponents of the same or similar rank of the highest-ranked party member. They\u2019ll also have access to the same number of tracks as the highest-ranked party member.\nAt the start of a new Ranked Season, all players\u2019 ranks reset to provide a fresh start for everyone. A player's beginning rank depends on their finishing rank in the prior Season.\nOnce a player reaches Unreal, they stay in Unreal for that Ranked Season no matter their performance in future races. They are also given a number signifying their standing among Unreal players globally. Continuing to do well in ranked raises this number.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nTrailers.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Additionally, fire will deal more damage and spread faster than before.\nWeek 2: Fish Fiesta.\nFish Fiesta: May 13 at 10 AM ET until May 20 at 10 AM ET.\nFish and weapons are hooked on the thrill of being caught.

And in keeping up with trends, more vendors are supplying Prop Disguise services. Combine the sneakiness of a Prop Disguise with the silent precision of a &lt;a href=\"Suppressed%20Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Suppressed Sniper Rifle&lt;/a&gt; and the enemy won\u2019t know what hit \u2018em!\nWeek 2: High Flying Week.\nHigh Flying Week: August 26 at 10 AM ET until September 2 at 10 AM ET.\nBoth the Aliens and IO have retired their stealth tactics, but the IO has shaken up the Island another way.

Wildlife has a wide range of uses, from mobility, to taming them to aid in battle. The most common use of Wildlife however is for &lt;a href=\"Meat\"&gt;Meat&lt;/a&gt;. Players can tame most Wildlife using Meat, and with the aid of a &lt;a href=\"Hunter%27s%20Cloak\"&gt;Hunter's Cloak&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers can ride Sharks, Wolves, Boars, and Raptors, which enables them to control the animal as if they were a vehicle. This method also instantly tames the wildlife, but doesn't allow the player to tame more than one. Riding an animal allows the player to move in any direction, jump and sprint. Animals have a stamina bar which stops them moving if depleted. This bar must be refilled with &lt;a href=\"Meat\"&gt;Meat&lt;/a&gt;. Riding on an animal allows the player to use all items that they can normally, even allowing Healing Items to be used whilst moving. The player can also build in this state. However sharks function differently, they can only be ridden with a fishing rod and don\u2019t have a stamina bar, but also can\u2019t stop moving. Players cannot perform their usual actions while riding a shark, only being able to seer it, boost, and jump. Sharks also can\u2019t be tamed. When an animal\u2019s health bar reaches zero, it will be eliminated, but wildlife can be healed via &lt;a href=\"Chug%20Splash\"&gt;Chug Splash&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Campfire\"&gt;Campfire&lt;/a&gt;, or any other method of &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Items\"&gt;healing&lt;/a&gt; another player.\nList of Wildlife.\nAmbient Wildlife.\nThese wildlife are for environmental ambience and have no gameplay function.\nAudio.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nHistory.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Update%20v30.00\"&gt;Update v30.00&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nOther.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Hostile Wildlife can be tamed and be used to kill &lt;a href=\"Monsters\"&gt;Monsters&lt;/a&gt;, helping the player and their team. Players can only have one tamed Wild Animal at a time. Taming a new one will eliminate the previous one. Wildlife can not be &lt;a href=\"Elements\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;.\nWildlife appears in every mission except &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Shield\"&gt;Storm Shield&lt;/a&gt; defenses, &lt;a href=\"Dungeons\"&gt;Dungeons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frostnite\"&gt;Frostnite&lt;/a&gt; and when fighting the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20King\"&gt;Storm King&lt;/a&gt;.\nSelect Wildlife can be tamed using Meat, or by jumping on top of them, which will tame them and cause them to become friendly.\nPlayers can ride certain Wildlife, which enables them to control the animal as if they were a vehicle. Riding an Animal allows the player to move in any direction, jump and sprint. Animals have a stamina bar which stops them moving if depleted. This bar must be refilled with &lt;a href=\"Meat\"&gt;Meat&lt;/a&gt;. Riding on an animal allows the player to use &lt;a href=\"Weaponry%20%28Save%20the%20World%29\"&gt;Weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Full%20List%20Of%20Items%20%28Save%20the%20World%29\"&gt;Consumables&lt;/a&gt;, but doesn't allow the use of &lt;a href=\"Gadgets\"&gt;Gadgets&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Abilities\"&gt;Abilities&lt;/a&gt;, and building whilst riding.\nUnlike untamed Wildlife, when a tamed Animal's health bar reaches zero, it will be knocked down instead of instantly being eliminated. Players can revive them. If a Player gets knocked down and chooses to Respawn instead of using a life to revive themself, their tamed Animal will despawn from the zone.\nTypes.\nThere are 7 Types of Wildlife \nHistory.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Update%20v27.00\"&gt;Update v27.00&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

As the player remains airborne, the Wings will slowly start to burn, eventually forcing a landing. When high enough, a Dive Bomb attack can be used. It consists of a high impact landing that deals damage to all structures in a 3x3 area and knocks opponents back, dealing them damage that can pierce through destroyed buildings.\nWhen the player receives substantial damage mid-air, they will immediately crash to the ground, forcefully performing the Dive Bomb attack. After crashing, the cooldown before using the the Wings of Icarus again will be 12s instead of the normal 5s.\nWhen the Wings of Icarus are held, the player will be rendered immune to fall damage and will receive a slight Low Gravity effect. These effects take place even outside of flight.\nA player can carry more than one Wings of Icarus in their inventory at the same time.

Running from Dec. 16, 2021, at 9 AM ET to Jan. 6, 2022, at 9 AM ET, Sgt. Winter will give players 14 Presents \u2014 including two Outfits \u2014 over the course of Winterfest 2021! \ud83c\udf81 There\u2019s a third gift Outfit you can get another way too.\nIf you\u2019re a new player who just joined with Chapter 3, this is the perfect opportunity to start your Fortnite journey with lots of Locker items. And if you\u2019re a longtime player, this is the perfect opportunity to add to your collection. But the gifts are only one part of the festivities. Here\u2019s everything the Sergeant has in store for Winterfest 2021, including a\u2026 \"cozy\" welcome to Spider-Man and MJ of the upcoming \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" movie.\nThe Winterfest Lodge Re-Opens.\nCrackshot\u2019s handing Sgt. Winter the keys to the Winterfest Lodge, where Sgt. Winter will be giving Presents to players. Unwrap a new Present at the Lodge every day for 14 days! Wrapped up in the Lodge are two Outfits, two Pickaxes, two Wraps, as well as a Glider, Contrail, Emote, Lobby Track, Loading Screen, Emoticon, Spray, and Banner.\nGet your shaking and guessing skills ready: we don\u2019t want to spoil all the Presents, but we will reveal the two Outfits. Meet &lt;a href=\"Krisabelle\"&gt;Krisabelle&lt;/a&gt;, a festive take on the community-inspired Isabelle, and &lt;a href=\"Polar%20Peely\"&gt;Polar Peely&lt;/a&gt;, one cool banana (literally). Unwrap the Krisabelle Outfit after unwrapping the six Presents obstructing her, and unwrap Polar Peely after his giftbox thaws.\nLike last time, the Winterfest Lodge will be accessible through a snowflake tab in the Lobby. If you miss any days of opening Presents, simply return anytime before Winterfest ends (Jan. 6 at 9 AM ET) to open them up. Sitting by the fireplace allowed you to get 10, 20, 100, 1000 or 5000 supercharged XP every 15 seconds. Supercharged XP did not level the player up directly, but instead allowed them to gain boosted XP for the next amount gained. \nPlayers could also open one of 14 presents:\nInteracting with other objects in the cabin resulted in other 'Easter Eggs' to play, such as an RC Quadcrasher appearing when the Quadcrasher was selected, and the snowglobe playing music.\nWinterfest Quests for Rewards.\nUnsurprisingly for a sergeant \u2014 of winter no less \u2014 Sgt. Winter has wintery objectives awaiting you. Every day for 14 days, he\u2019ll announce a new Winterfest Quest in the \u201cQuests\u201d page, each one with an XP reward! All Winterfest Quests are available to complete until Winterfest ends (Jan. 6 at 9 AM ET). For completing seven Winterfest Quests, you\u2019ll unlock the &lt;a href=\"Snowmando%20Board\"&gt;Snowmando Board&lt;/a&gt; Glider, and for completing ten, the &lt;a href=\"Ffrosty\"&gt;Ffrosty&lt;/a&gt; Back Bling. \nWith the Snowmando Board Glider, perform a trick and surf down into battle! Two alt Styles are included with this Glider: Ice King Board and Llamadelica Board.\nAs a Fortnite Crew bonus during Winterfest 2021, active Fortnite Crew subscribers will receive the Golden Look Board Glider upon logging into the event. As you can guess from the name, its design is based on a certain genius-slash-espionage expert:\n\"He is watching...\"\nWinterfest without Frontiers.\nIt\u2019s winter on more than just the Island. Back in November, we announced our Winter creator callout, and in turn, you submitted chillingly great maps, games, and more.\nJump into featured creations in the Winterfest tab next to \u201cDiscover.\u201d At the end of Winterfest 2021, after playing for two hours total across creator-made maps/games, you\u2019ll receive: &lt;a href=\"Ol%27%20Cracky\"&gt;Ol' Cracky&lt;/a&gt; Emoticon, &lt;a href=\"Llamistletoe\"&gt;Llamistletoe&lt;/a&gt; Spray, a Merry Marauder Banner, and a 2022 New Year\u2019s Banner.\nUnvaulted Icy Items.\nSgt. Winter has a battle-filled past, much like his colleague Snowmando. To give you a taste of his experience, he\u2019s bringing icy items out of the armory:\nIn the Item Shop: Spider-Man and MJ from Spider-Man: No Way Home (Plus More Outfits).\nThere\u2019s classic Spider-Man of the Chapter 3 Season 1 Battle Pass, and soon No Way Home Spider-Man and MJ will be coming to the Item Shop for Winterfest. (Just in time for the movie\u2019s release!) The &lt;a href=\"Spider-Man%20%28No%20Way%20Home%29\"&gt;Spider-Man (No Way Home)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"MJ%20%28No%20Way%20Home%29\"&gt;MJ (No Way Home)&lt;/a&gt; Outfits will be in the Item Shop starting December 16 at 7 PM ET. Put on and take off No Way Home Spider-Man's mask with his built-in Emote!\nMore new Outfits will be rotating into the Shop throughout Winterfest, including those inspired by concepts from &lt;a href=\"https%3A//twitter.com/lbdart_\"&gt;@lbdart_&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//twitter.com/AltaCalls\"&gt;@AltaCalls&lt;/a&gt;. As previously announced, these two community members are the winners of June\u2019s Concept Royale, our callout for two exceptional, wintry concepts to be transformed into Outfits! Returning winter Outfits will be rotating into the Shop during Winterfest as well.\nBlizzabelle of the Ball... Another Gift Outfit!\nKrisabelle isn\u2019t the only one getting festive at her school of attendance \u201cOakwitch Academy.\u201d Voted Winterfest Queen by a jury of her peers (an honor matched only by Krisabelle\u2019s \u201cMost Festive Holiday Witch\" three years in a row), &lt;a href=\"Blizzabelle\"&gt;Blizzabelle&lt;/a&gt; is another gift Outfit that players can get during the event! \nAs one of the Epic Games Store \"Epic Deals\", all players who log into Fortnite from the Epic Games Launcher anytime from Dec. 16 at 11 AM ET to Jan. 6 at 11 AM ET can get the Blizzabelle gift Outfit by redeeming it from the Item Shop.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nAs you\u2019re enjoying the holiday decorations around the Island, you may spot Sgt. Winter patrolling on his special big rig, chauffeured by two Red-Nosed Rangers. He\u2019ll be throwing out Holiday Presents!, but if you get on his bad side (a.k.a. the naughty list), he and the Rangers won\u2019t hesitate to throw themselves into action... \nDon\u2019t displease the Sergeant, but \"do\" have a happy Winterfest!\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nPresents.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

It was introduced in and allows players to move across water at increased speeds.\nFunctionality.\nWhen a player enters a deep enough body of water, they begin swimming. Swimming is a method of traversing water. When in water, players can move in any direction, as well as Jump in order to gain vertical distance. Players cannot swim down into the water, and will always float on top unless forced underneath by a ramp or &lt;a href=\"Vehicles%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;vehicle&lt;/a&gt;.\nA swimming player can repeatedly chain several forward jumps in order to dive. Diving will increase the player's move speed significantly, and is faster than Sprinting. Players can also swim at full speed in order to remain fast, but will not be as fast as a repeated dive. Swimming backwards is as slow as backpedaling on land.\nPlayers who are swimming can still do all of the same functions as a player on land such as but not limited to: Healing, Interacting, Reviving, Shooting, Building etc.\nPlayers who land in water will immediately start swimming. This will negate all fall damage, no matter the height or depth of the water. \nIf a player is forced underwater for approximately 10 seconds, they will begin drowning. At first, this will deal 5 damage in increments of 1 damage per tick, then the player will lose 5 health/shield per tick, until they are knocked or eliminated."}
