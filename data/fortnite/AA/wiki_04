He could also be seen in the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Tour\"&gt;Rift Tour&lt;/a&gt; event.\nSave the World.\nPlayers fight the Storm King in &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Royal%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Battle Royal&lt;/a&gt;. A Power Level of 70 is recommended to fight the Storm King. \nLater in Twine Peaks, you fight a second Storm King, even more powerful than the first, having the storm close in on you if you didn't defeat the &lt;a href=\"Mini-Bosses\"&gt;Mini-Bosses&lt;/a&gt;. This is known as the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Storm%20King\"&gt;Mythic Storm King&lt;/a&gt;. This Storm King can give you the first set of Weapons in Save the World. \nDefeating the Storm King.\nThe Storm King has 4 Crystal spawn points:\nAfter the 3 crystals are destroyed, you and your team will need to build towards any horn of the Storm King and pickaxe it. Once one horn is broken, all 4 crystal spawns will regenerate, prompting you to destroy them again. The Crystals will be more harder to destroy because the Storm King will be much more aggressive towards the player and more Monsters will spawn to serve as a distraction.\nOnce the final Horn is broken, the Storm King will be very vulnerable, and can take damage from anywhere in his body. After defeating the Storm King, the cube that kept him alive will drop into a pool of water and dissolve. The Mission will complete upon the cube completely.\nBattle Royale.\nFortnitemares 2019.\nIn , a mode called Tempest of the Storm King was released for &lt;a href=\"Fortnitemares%202019\"&gt;Fortnitemares 2019&lt;/a&gt;. In this LTM, you would drop either to a nearby named or unnamed location. The storm would close in quickly, so you had to move fast if you didn't land on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20Of%20The%20Storm\"&gt;Isle Of The Storm&lt;/a&gt;. Then, you would have to defeat the Storm King by destroying all of his weak spots. After destroying his weak spots, you have to shoot him in the horns until its health bar is empty. Then you would be rewarded with a couple of battle medals and a new &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Sail\"&gt;umbrella&lt;/a&gt;.\nRift Tour 2021.\nIn , the Storm King could have been seen in Phase 3 of the Rift Tour event. Players would shoot at a reincarnation of the Storm King, and would gain points by shooting the crystals on its body, nearby crystals around the map, and scattered &lt;a href=\"Emotes\"&gt;Emoting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cube%20Monsters\"&gt;Cube Monsters&lt;/a&gt;.\nGallery.\n=Lore=\nThe Storm Kings are overpowered and highly intelligent monsters seeking power and destruction. They are the finale evolution stage of &lt;a href=\"Corruption%20Cubes\"&gt;Corruption Cubes&lt;/a&gt;. \nThey are the main antagonists of and .\nOverview.\nThe Storm Kings are the monsters that caused the global &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;Storm&lt;/a&gt; which turned nearly all of the world population into &lt;a href=\"Husk%20Monsters\"&gt;Husk Monsters&lt;/a&gt; in , they humanoid form of &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%20%28Save%20The%20World%29\"&gt;Cubes&lt;/a&gt; that crashed on STW world along with purple &lt;a href=\"The%20Mothership\"&gt;motherships&lt;/a&gt;. They seek to consume all the worlds, much like the other members of &lt;a href=\"The%20Army%20of%20the%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Army of the Last Reality&lt;/a&gt;. \nHistory.\nSave The World.\nA long time ago, multiple purple &lt;a href=\"The%20Mothership\"&gt;Motherships&lt;/a&gt; of the Army of the Last Reality crashed on the planet at an undetermined moment in time at &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Fjords\"&gt;Frozen Fjords&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Boreal%20Base\"&gt;Boreal Base&lt;/a&gt;. Crashed &lt;a href=\"Abductors\"&gt;Abductors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alien%20Parasites\"&gt;Alien Parasites&lt;/a&gt; eggs, &lt;a href=\"Alien%20Biome\"&gt;Alien Biome&lt;/a&gt; and petrified &lt;a href=\"Chrome\"&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt; crystals can also be found near the crash site. Later, the cubes from the crashed motherships summoned &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt;, bringing &lt;a href=\"Monsters\"&gt;Husks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mist%20Monsters\"&gt;Mist Monsters&lt;/a&gt;. These creatures were drawn on cave walls in &lt;a href=\"Canny%20Valley\"&gt;Canny Valley&lt;/a&gt; and one day, The Storm mysteriously vanished; the plan seems to have failed for some unknown reason.\nAges later, &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Vinderman\"&gt;Dr. Vinderman&lt;/a&gt; somehow got information on the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20King\"&gt;Storm King&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Nothing\"&gt;The Nothing&lt;/a&gt; before their arrival, potentially through discovering the cave drawings. Several of the Motherships' Cubes evolved into Storm Kings and summoned The Storm once again, wiping 98% of the world's population, turning them to &lt;a href=\"Monsters\"&gt;Husks&lt;/a&gt;, and taking over Save the World Reality's Earth. Homebase is formed from the survivors and fights back against The Storm.\nThe Storm King is first mentioned by Homebase in the &lt;a href=\"Stonewood\"&gt;Stonewood&lt;/a&gt; Storyline, when &lt;a href=\"Lars\"&gt;Lars&lt;/a&gt; encounters one of them while in his van.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Reverse%20Tinfoil%20Hats\"&gt;Reverse Tinfoil Hats&lt;/a&gt; Quest, it is revealed that The Storm King has started to deploy a mind control scheme on &lt;a href=\"Homebase\"&gt;Homebase&lt;/a&gt;. His plan is foiled shortly after, but the dread on the survivors remained for some time. The &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20Rift\"&gt;Alpha Rift&lt;/a&gt; at the end of &lt;a href=\"Canny%20Valley\"&gt;Canny Valley&lt;/a&gt; is finally revealed and a stable &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Rifts\"&gt;Beta Rift&lt;/a&gt; is used to enter the other side of the portal: The Storm, where the Storm King is defeated by the Homebase.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Desiree\"&gt;Desiree&lt;/a&gt; stays behind after it is defeated and blows up the portal using a Singularity Pulse Bomb while in the Storm Realm, leading to her sacrifice. The Storm King leaves behind his heart, &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%20%28Save%20The%20World%29\"&gt;The Cube&lt;/a&gt; as it sinks into the pool in the center of the map. The Cube escaped in an unknown manner and returned to STW's world where he was discovered by Lok. At the end of Lok' Tales of Beyond questline, it appears and gives Homebase a cryptic warning: \"THE SIX SIDES OF CHANCE CAN TURN IN AN INSTANT. THE DIE IS CAST.\" \nAfter The Timeline was broken in during The Long Road Home quests and that Ray disappeared over time, Commander and Director Riggs looked for a way to fix it in The Timeless questlines, unfortunately without success: the only solution was to destroy it before endangering the multiverse. But Ray who had traveled through time finally made a pact with The Cube to repair the timeline in exchange for something. A few seconds after the timeline collapsed on itself and that everyone ceased to exist The Cube partially restored it and explained to Homebase that it is necessary to perform 4 Dark Rituals to restore it completely but it was also a trick to help him regain all of his powers.\nHowever, at the same time, Homebase discovered that there were in fact several Storm Kings, as an anomalous energy spike signaled to Homebase the presence of a Storm King who was on rampage at Twine Peaks. He has become even more powerful than the one they previously faced, even more powerful to be now &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Storm%20King\"&gt;Mythic Storm King&lt;/a&gt;. After a fight even harder than before, this Storm King was finally defeated. Just like his &lt;a href=\"Canny%20Valley\"&gt;Canny Valley&lt;/a&gt; counterpart, he left behind a &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%20%28Save%20The%20World%29\"&gt;Cube&lt;/a&gt;. However according to Ray, all the remaining Storm Kings headed toward Homebase to destroy them.\nBattle Royale.\nDuring Fortnitemares in , a Storm King found the Island and appeared in &lt;a href=\"Eye%20Land\"&gt;Eye Land&lt;/a&gt;, corrupting the center island to make it the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20Of%20The%20Storm\"&gt;Isle Of The Storm&lt;/a&gt;. This Storm King was defeated by Loopers and ejected from Reality Zero, restoring Eye Land in the process. Later during the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Tour\"&gt;Rift Tour&lt;/a&gt; event in , the Loopers fight another Storm King in his own dimension.\nLEGO Fortnite Odyssey.\nThe Storm started to invade LEGO Reality, animals, monsters and even people making them more powerful and aggressive.\nLater, The Storm King himself arrived in the LEGO World, corrupting Raven to make him his new servant and made himself a dungeon in the Rift at the heart of the world where he can consume infinite rift energy to power the Storm, corrupt and destroy the whole reality. He and his forces are fought by the STorm Chasers and otehr residents of the LEGO world, however, they're unable to defeat him for good as each time he return along with his storms.\n=Audio=\nMusic.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

{"id": "25029", "revid": "37316495", "url": "https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki?curid=25029", "title": "Storm Shield", "text": "The Storm Shield, also known as \"Homebase\" (not to be confused with &lt;a href=\"Homebase\"&gt;the faction&lt;/a&gt;), is both a device and a map where players can build their own personal, permanent base. Players can access their Storm Shield at any time to build or store items. Building progress is saved even if the player leaves the mission without initiating the defense phase. Each map location features its own separate Storm Shield for players to establish and expand upon.\nA new Storm Shield is launched via rocket, delivering the payload to an unexplored location. The Commander then arrives to complete the deployment of the Storm Shield.\nStorm Shield Defense.\nStorm Shield Defense is one of the main quest series that players must complete in order to progress through the game. Each map location has 10 Storm Shield Defense missions, 6 of which are Main Quests. Completing Storm Shield Defense missions increases the range of mission power levels available to the player.\nAmplifiers.\nAmplifiers are devices that amplify your Storm Shield\u2019s power. They are named alphabetically (Latin alphabet) and 9 of them are available at max (&lt;a href=\"Twine%20Peaks\"&gt;Twine Peaks&lt;/a&gt;). You must defend them from &lt;a href=\"Monsters\"&gt;Monsters&lt;/a&gt;.\nStorm Shield Storage.\nIn addition to the player's inventory, which is accessible during missions, players have a separate storage location in their Storm Shield that is only accessible while inside the Storm Shield map. While the Storm Shield base is unique to each map location, the player's storage inventory persists between locations. The storage is disabled at the start and needs to be unlocked through the &lt;a href=\"Upgrades\"&gt;Upgrades&lt;/a&gt; section of the &lt;a href=\"Command\"&gt;Command&lt;/a&gt; Tab. Players can then upgrade the storage by 20 slots per upgrade.\nDefender Squads.\nPlayers can designate up to five &lt;a href=\"Defenders\"&gt;Defenders&lt;/a&gt; per map location to be summonable in that location's Storm Shield. These defenders do not count towards the regular 4-player cap that Mission defenders are affected by, therefore up to five Homebase Defenders may be summoned in addition to a full team of players or Mission defenders. Therefore, it is possible to have up to eight defenders in a Storm Shield Defense mission if a solo player summons all five of their Homebase defenders in addition to their three available Mission defenders."}

His unique character dialogue suggests that he seems to be good friends with &lt;a href=\"Drift\"&gt;Drift&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIn the cinematic trailer, he can be seen falling out of the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Gate\"&gt;Rift Gate&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;Sideways Rift&lt;/a&gt; before facing his sister, &lt;a href=\"Mizuki\"&gt;Mizuki&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"MEGA%20City\"&gt;MEGA City&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeaving the &lt;a href=\"River%20Guard\"&gt;River Guard&lt;/a&gt; behind for the &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Clan\"&gt;Fox Clan&lt;/a&gt; seemed to only strain the pre-existent rivalry between the two - as well as his relationship with &lt;a href=\"Mizuki\"&gt;his sister&lt;/a&gt;. To &lt;a href=\"Mizuki\"&gt;Mizuki&lt;/a&gt;'s disliking, &lt;a href=\"Drift\"&gt;Drift&lt;/a&gt; seems to take him under his wing.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate%20Quests\"&gt;Syndicate Quests&lt;/a&gt;, impressed by &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;'s swordsmanship, he, alongside the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Clan\"&gt;Fox Clan&lt;/a&gt;, agreed to meet with the &lt;a href=\"River%20Guard\"&gt;River Guard&lt;/a&gt; for a peace negotiation over dinner.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Earthquakes%23Chapter%204\"&gt;The Rumbles&lt;/a&gt;, he was one of the few islanders to notice the ongoing rumbling issues.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Clan\"&gt;Fox Clan&lt;/a&gt; is brought into , Stray likely resides in &lt;a href=\"Twinkle%20Terrace\"&gt;Twinkle Terrace&lt;/a&gt; with the rest of the Clan in their hideout.\nStray seems to have become &lt;a href=\"Drift\"&gt;Drift&lt;/a&gt;'s direct apprentice despite &lt;a href=\"Mizuki\"&gt;Mizuki&lt;/a&gt;'s earlier warnings, though &lt;a href=\"Vi\"&gt;Vi&lt;/a&gt; has to encourage &lt;a href=\"Drift\"&gt;Drift&lt;/a&gt; to train him. He seems to have mended his relationship with &lt;a href=\"Mizuki\"&gt;Mizuki&lt;/a&gt; as well, as she advises him to keep his eyes sharp, warning him of possible dangers while looking out for him - and she notably expresses no hostility towards &lt;a href=\"Drift\"&gt;his apparent mentor&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

It contains many categories, such as: Box Fight, Adventure, Parkour, and Zone Wars. There are also featured categories, which change from time to time, offering new experiences each time.\nClicking on one of the categories opens a near-endless vertical list of creations using that category. You can play and favourite experiences from this list.\nThe Library tab shows Players' recently played and favourite islands. This menu is a simple, quick way to replay your favourite and enjoyed creations without having to search through several different rows and menus.\nYou can also unfavourite or favourite an island from this menu. However, if you unfavourite an island, it will be removed from the menu upon click, and the only way to get it back is through entering its island code so be very careful.\nRather than letting you play an experience, this menu lets you create one. Upon clicking the Create button, the playlist will be selected, and, from the playlist, you can Ready up and enter the &lt;a href=\"The%20Hub\"&gt;The Hub&lt;/a&gt;, where you can access and edit your Creations.\nThis menu, just like the Library tab, is a shortcut to access Creative, without having to find it in Discover.\nThe Island Code menu allows you to find an exact island, rather than finding just a type of island.\nEach island in Fortnite Creative has its own unique 12-digit code that is generated on-publish and is used to identify that specific island"}

It was introduced in . \nFunctionality.\nDonatello's Staff is a hybrid of a close range hack-and-slash weapon and an air ambush weapon like the other &lt;a href=\"Rarity\"&gt;Mythic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Collaborations\"&gt;TMNT&lt;/a&gt; weapons. It has a unique octagonal reticle (reminiscent of a turtle shell). When attacking and targeting an opponent in range, the reticle becomes blue, the color of Donatello's headband.\nEach Mythic TMNT weapon has a standard attack (fire) that can be held to string a chain of attacks together. Each hit deals different amounts of damage and thus the weapon does not have a consistent damage per second. They also possess an air dash (aim) that will allow the player to quickly launch themselves into the air a short distance. It can also be used on the ground. This dash also deals damage if it hits an opponent, but has a very small cooldown afterwards. While in the air, the player may use the standard attack to produce an air attack (a ground slam that deals heavy damage and knockback).\nIn addition, simply having this weapon as the active weapon grants the user a passive double jump. Using this gives the player fall damage immunity and a slight boost forward, but it can't be used again until the player touches the ground. This jump uses stamina even if the player isn't sprinting. For this reason, players must manage their stamina carefully, as if they are caught in midair without enough stamina to double jump, they will take fall damage as normal and potentially eliminate themselves.\nThe weapon has three charges that slowly refill over time similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Grapple%20Blade\"&gt;Grapple Blade&lt;/a&gt;. Using an air dash or air attack expends a charge. Each charge takes 10 seconds to refill.\nDonatello's Combo.\nDonatello's standard attack combo consists of a kick while balancing with the staff, leading into a quick double thrust, then a rapid fire string of 15 damage from twirling the staff.\nWeapon ID.\nDonatello's Staff is referred to as Lined Notebook Delta in the files.\nNews Tab.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

When fully constructed it was activated during The Device event, where it fought against the &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;storm&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Device was built and intended to break &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt; and destroy &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt;. It was connected to five antennas inside hatches near &lt;a href=\"The%20Agency\"&gt;The Agency&lt;/a&gt;, which were powered by The Device to push the storm. Using possible &lt;a href=\"GHOST\"&gt;GHOST&lt;/a&gt; funding and supplies, Midas was able to construct The Device, however it was privately created without GHOST or &lt;a href=\"SHADOW\"&gt;SHADOW&lt;/a&gt; knowing. The Device itself was built during the events of the &lt;a href=\"GHOST\"&gt;GHOST&lt;/a&gt; vs. &lt;a href=\"SHADOW\"&gt;SHADOW&lt;/a&gt; war, which Midas used to distract the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; from his actual plan. The Device destroyed The Agency in the process of activating. The Device struggled to battle against The Storm, however successfully destroyed it. It then retreated back into The Hideout. Midas' plan was near success, however &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;IO&lt;/a&gt; counteracted against Midas' efforts and sent a thunder directly on top of The Device, which broke it. Midas' attempt to defy &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt; caused a giant Tsunami held by &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt; barrier to form, it is called &lt;a href=\"The%20Wall%20Of%20Water\"&gt;The Wall of Water&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter The Device retreated back into &lt;a href=\"The%20Hideout\"&gt;The Hideout,&lt;/a&gt; it was never seen again. In , the plans for The Device appeared at &lt;a href=\"Cuddle%20Cruisers\"&gt;Cuddle Cruisers&lt;/a&gt; before it was then taken from sight. It's most recent appearance was in , where the actual device was on top of a microphone and owned by Snoop's Enterprise. It still destroyed the Storm during the event, but seemingly had no consequences.\nAppearance.\nIt looks like an artificial zero point with a glass dome on seemingly steel holding it up, it has wires around it with a platform holding it up, in the live event we see it raised up showing the long large gold wires connected to the doomsday device.

It was introduced in alongside the &lt;a href=\"Victory%20Crown%20Rogue\"&gt;Victory Crown Rogue&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe Nitro Drifter is a 4 wheeled, high speed car with 4 seats. It spawns with 40-100 fuel in, and cannot be found booted. The Nitro Drifter is best suited for on road driving as it goes as fast as a &lt;a href=\"Cars\"&gt;Victory Motors Whiplash&lt;/a&gt; on asphalt, but it does not have the worst off road capabilities compared to the Whiplash and the standard &lt;a href=\"Cars\"&gt;Prevalent&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, it has a built-in boost drift system which is also hinted at by the extra mechanical parts just above the engine, on the car's hood. Pulling the handbrake for roughly a second will allow the car to not only drift extremely sharply but unlock a boost visually depleted by the two muffles on the rear bottom of the vehicle. \nThe boost doesn't cause the car to breach its speed limit of 72km/h, rather, it brings the car to max speed or a close value depending on how it's handled. This can be performed on any terrain, so it is recommended to continuously drift and boost off road as it will make travel much faster. The boost is dependent on the ordinary movement of the car and can only bring the Nitro Drifter to max speed if the accelerator is kept fully pressed during the whole process, otherwise the boost will achieve a speed depending on how much the accelerator is being pulled as the boost is being generated. As a matter of fact, one can activate the Nitro Drifter's boost by keeping the accelerator pressed after drifting but stop right afterwards, causing the car to completely stop \"despite\" the boost. \nThe boost also causes the two rear tires (both standard and ones) to visibly glow just like the rear muffles. The energy color depends on the paint job of the car and is purely a visual difference. Despite this, if \"any\" of the tires is destroyed (including the front ones), the boost will be disabled. The tires and windows have separate health bars and act as weak spots. Destroying tires will not only deprive the Nitro Drifter of its boost function but also force it to take damage over time and become progressively harder to handle as more tires are popped up. \nLike all cars it can be upgraded with and , and has access to &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations\"&gt;Radio Stations&lt;/a&gt; and a honk. It consumes fuel, however the drift boost doesn't consume any extra fuel whatsoever. The Nitro Drifter has an armor worth 800HP, and when it's emptied, the vehicle will enter a death state before exploding, starting a &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; and turning into a wreckage."}

The Nitro Fang much like other &lt;a href=\"vehicles\"&gt;vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, is best suited for on road driving, but it does not have the worst offroad capabilities compared to other cars. It is tied for the lowest amount of HP.\nIt has a very sharp handbrake that grants a speed increase if holden for about a second, much like the &lt;a href=\"Nitro%20Drifter\"&gt;Nitro Drifter&lt;/a&gt;. The boost is originated from four mufflers located on the side bottom of the vehicle (two per side). The boost, unlike the &lt;a href=\"Cars\"&gt;Victory Motors Whiplash&lt;/a&gt;'s, doesn't actually allow the car to breach its normal speed limit of 72km/h, rather, it brings the car to max speed if handled correctly. This works on all terrain, so it is recommended to use the boost continuously off-road to go faster, being aware the car will obviously be harder to control. The Nitro Fang behaves almost exactly like the Nitro Drifter and its boost gets disabled if it loses a tire, just like with the Nitro Drifter.\nThe Nitro Fang is strongly affected by mud and it's as fast as an unboosting Whiplash, while having two extra seats.\nLike all &lt;a href=\"cars\"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt; it can be upgraded with and and has access to &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations\"&gt;Radio Stations&lt;/a&gt; and a honk."}

It can grapple onto two points at once. The other function it has is attacking, you can prepare and then launch an attack, which will grapple you to the reticle, unleashing a rotating AOE slash attack. Afterwards, you are given a shockwave effect and can float for a short period of time. You can attack several times in succession, but this will affect the item's durability.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nUnlike the previous mobility items, the ODM gear has a durability bar, which is used up by grappling or attacking. When this runs out, the item breaks. If you touch the ground or let go while grappling, a short cooldown begins. Much like the &lt;a href=\"Grapple%20Glove\"&gt;Grapple Glove&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spider-Man%27s%20Web%20Shooters\"&gt;Spider-Man's Web Shooters&lt;/a&gt;, grappling several times in succession slows down the cooldown. Similarly, being damaged in the air causes a free fall, allowing fall damage to be taken. The ODM Gear does not deal damage to an opponent blocking with a &lt;a href=\"Lightsabers\"&gt;lightsaber&lt;/a&gt;.\nStats.\nThe ODM Gear's cooldown is used up in different amounts depending on the action performed. Note: The ODM Gear always starts with 100% usage after recharging or initially obtaining.\nInitially Grappling Onto A Surface: 4%\nAttacking: 25%\nHolding Onto A Surface Takes Around 1% every 0.5 seconds.\nAfter using 100% of its current usage, it enters a cooldown of around 12.5 seconds.\nWhen landing a direct hit on a player, the ODM Gear will first do 10 damage with its piston-shot grapple hooks and then 70 damage with the blades.\nFully using 100% of the cooldown uses about 1/4 of the total durability meaning you attack at max 16 times with one ODM Gear and grapple 80 times, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Spider-Man%27s%20Web%20Shooters\"&gt;Spider-Man's Web-Shooters&lt;/a&gt;, however, they are able to hold onto a target forever, while the ODM Gear takes durability achieving that.\nGrapple Range: 45 Meters\nAttack Range: 58 Meters\nKnown Issues.\nIn Team Rumble, the ODM Gear's cooldown can run into some issues because of the respawn mechanic. One bug includes respawning with under 100% cooldown or being unable to use it, requiring it to be dropped and picked back up.\nWeapon ID.\nODM Gear is referred to as Nyx Glass in the files.\nNews Tab.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept Art.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Passengers who are sitting there will have a better view of the battlefield and be able to shoot their own &lt;a href=\"Weaponry%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;guns&lt;/a&gt; more freely, but they'll also be much more exposed to incoming fire. There are 2 windows, a windshield and a rear windshield.\nThe OG Bear has an average top speed, though it goes as fast off-road as it does on asphalt. As such, it is unadvised to mod it with unless one has to traverse hilly terrain. The vehicle has standard fuel consumption.\nThe Bear sports a very wide-angled and slow drifting, usually impractical. It's more resistant than most cars with its 1.000HP, and once its health bar is emptied it will enter the vehicle death state and explode, starting a fire and leaving a wreckage behind.\nLike all cars, it can access Radio Stations, honk and be repaired through a &lt;a href=\"Repair%20Torch\"&gt;Repair Torch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chrome\"&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Campfire\"&gt;Campfires.&lt;/a&gt;\nVariants.\nThe Bear has a single variant."}

They are a kingdom/empire/order created before the Imagined Order by &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt; as their earliest prototype but ended up being abandoned. However, &lt;a href=\"The%20Ageless\"&gt;The Ageless&lt;/a&gt;, one of Geno's snapshot, took control of the empire and began to rule it as its Champion. \nIt should be noted that, while Oathbound was formed earlier, it was abandoned after Geno went on to form the IO. Since then, they have co-existed, and despite their different ideologies, trace their roots back to Geno.\nOverview.\nThe Oathbound is a technologically advanced medieval empire formed by &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt;, later ruled by &lt;a href=\"The%20Ageless\"&gt;The Ageless&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Orin\"&gt;Prince Orin&lt;/a&gt;. They are the predecessors and the earliest prototype of the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; that resided on an &lt;a href=\"Oathbound%27s%20Reality\"&gt;unknown Reality&lt;/a&gt; until being pulled to &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"Zero%20Fusion\"&gt;Zero Fusion&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations, Members and Technology.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nTechnology.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nHistory.\nPre-Chapter 4.\nThe Oathbound was formed as an empire by Geno, then given to &lt;a href=\"The%20Ageless\"&gt;The Ageless&lt;/a&gt; Champion, and fought in many battles, sworn to fight to the last. Several centuries ago, a young Stellan without name nor family was taken in by the Shapeless Man, who made him join the Oathbound.\nStellan later became the Head Alchemist of the empire, known as the Rift Warden. The Shapeless Man asked him to build a Rift Gate, a task also given by The Ageless Champion.\nFor an unknown reason, their Sages were exiled. But they left behind their forbidden works, including a prophecy about the future. They also said something about Stellan, which Princess Lexa remembers.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; pulls over &lt;a href=\"The%20Citadel\"&gt;The Citadel&lt;/a&gt; and others parts of the kingdom to form &lt;a href=\"Asteria\"&gt;Asteria&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Oathbound%20Quests\"&gt;Oathbound Quests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AMIE\"&gt;AMIE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; encounter Stellan in The Citadel and give him their refined &lt;a href=\"Kinetic%20Ore\"&gt;Kinetic Ore&lt;/a&gt;. However, following AMIE's actions, The Ageless challenged The Looper to a duel, but lost the fight. Stellan later asked &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; to help him to construct the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Gate\"&gt;Rift Gate&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Warden%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Warden's Watch&lt;/a&gt;. Gradually, he revealed to them his secrets about &lt;a href=\"The%20Shapeless%20Man\"&gt;The Shapeless Man&lt;/a&gt; and his dreams haunted by this dark entity that took him in as his own. He came to the Oathbound at his orders, with no name or family besides this being. After being powered up, the gate is sabotaged by &lt;a href=\"Scrapknight%20Jules\"&gt;Jules&lt;/a&gt; and fails. It opens a giant &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;Sideways Rift&lt;/a&gt; in the sky. In search of answers to the future, Stellan began to search for the works of the exiled sages, he and The Looper found the prophecy of the exiled sages saying that a \"beautiful monster\" would be \"enabled by the hubris of a champion.\" Stellan deduced that the silence after that would mean Nothingness. &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Knight%20Kieran\"&gt;Rift Knight Kieran&lt;/a&gt; is given \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Masterwork\"&gt;The Masterwork&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Sylvie\"&gt;Sylvie&lt;/a&gt;, due to his prophecy of being a \"Foretold Hero\".\nThe Sideways Rift brings the &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Island\"&gt;Loot Island&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"MEGA%20City\"&gt;MEGA City&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Evergreen%20Biome\"&gt;Evergreen Biome&lt;/a&gt;. The failed Rift Gate is left at &lt;a href=\"Warden%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Warden's Watch&lt;/a&gt; in ruins.\nBehind the scenes, &lt;a href=\"The%20Ageless\"&gt;The Ageless&lt;/a&gt; hired &lt;a href=\"Volpez\"&gt;Volpez&lt;/a&gt; to get rid of &lt;a href=\"Snowheart\"&gt;Snowheart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Red%20Knight\"&gt;Frozen Red Knight&lt;/a&gt; who both threatened his empire. In a discussion with Stellan, Princess Lexa revealed that the Exiled Sages were right about Stellan, while Slone claimed she knows what he is, even if he doesn't. Leaving us to believe that the Rift Warden hides even more secrets, that even he might not know.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Citadel\"&gt;The Citadel&lt;/a&gt; has disappeared, and has been replaced by &lt;a href=\"Eclipsed%20Estate\"&gt;Eclipsed Estate&lt;/a&gt;, the residence of &lt;a href=\"Kado%20Thorne\"&gt;Kado Thorne&lt;/a&gt;, but the kingdom is still active. &lt;a href=\"Astrea\"&gt;Astrea&lt;/a&gt;, a cosmic entity consuming everything in her path arrived, awakening both &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Lexa\"&gt;Princess Lexa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Orin\"&gt;Prince Orin&lt;/a&gt;'s fates, and a timeless prophecy of the exiled sages.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Ageless\"&gt;The Ageless&lt;/a&gt; decided to &lt;a href=\"The%20Ageless%20Explorer\"&gt;explore&lt;/a&gt; new worlds, starting with &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt;.

Always shoot at players (ideally while they are standing still) from a long range.\nIf you are in close quarters combat, do not use weapons with scopes as they have slower reloads and aren't accurate in no-scoping. Instead, use a Hunting Rifle or Lever Action Rifle as a substitute, as these weapons are useful for no-scoping and close combat."}

The meeting was promoted by multiple mini posters and tiny billboards around the island. This \"Super Slurp\" seemed to be popular with the gnomes, but the event ended abruptly when a chemical reaction caused the unique gnome to blow up with its product.\n&lt;a href=\"Update%20v14.20\"&gt;Update v14.20&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly after the incident, \"Super Slurp Juice\" was looked downed upon. The posters and billboards previously displaying the conference were now sprayed over with graffiti. In &lt;a href=\"Hydro%2016\"&gt;Hydro 16&lt;/a&gt;, group of gnomes are found \"discussing\" the event behind closed doors, while the unique gnome (now a cyborg) hides and schemes in the basement of &lt;a href=\"GHOST%20House\"&gt;GHOST House&lt;/a&gt;. The lair is filled with multiple \"Super Slurp Juice\"-related objects, as well as mini three robot army, and a map with five points marked. The Cyborg Gnome's goal, it seems, was to use \"Super Slurp Juice\" as weaponized materials to blow up &lt;a href=\"Named%20Locations\"&gt;mapped locations&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; can intervene at said locations to disarm the aforementioned traps.\n&lt;a href=\"Update%20v14.30\"&gt;Update v14.30&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cyborg Gnome has left many of their inventions hidden in &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Cod\"&gt;Camp Cod&lt;/a&gt;. This is also likely around when said gnome began experimenting with the &lt;a href=\"Slurp%20Co.\"&gt;Slurp vats&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Slurpy%20Swamp\"&gt;Slurpy Swamp&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Update%20v14.40\"&gt;Update v14.40&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Looper may interfere with these plans as well, and \"purify\" the vats that have turned green from the Cyborg Gnome's experimentation. Confrontation afterwards led to them trying to blast off in a pseudo-escape attempt, which ultimately resulted in them perishing.\n&lt;a href=\"Update%20v14.50\"&gt;Update v14.50&lt;/a&gt;.\nA memorial is enacted to the Cyborg Gnome, and the Looper, as well as the other gnomes, can pay respects to the statue. \n&lt;br&gt;\nThe memorial is later removed due to unknown means.\n&lt;a href=\"Update%20v16.20\"&gt;Update v16.20&lt;/a&gt;.\nA single gnome can be found in the cell of &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%27s%20Office\"&gt;Sheriff's Office&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Update%20v16.30\"&gt;Update v16.30&lt;/a&gt;.\nMore gnomes are added to the cell.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Update%20v16.50\"&gt;Update v16.50&lt;/a&gt;.\nEven more gnomes are added to the cell.\n&lt;a href=\"Update%20v18.10\"&gt;Update v18.10&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany more gnomes arrive to start breaking the imprisoned gnomes out of the jail cell in the Sherrif's Office.\n&lt;a href=\"Update%20v18.20\"&gt;Update v18.20&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll of the gnomes have escaped from the Landmark.\n&lt;a href=\"Update%20v18.30\"&gt;Update v18.30&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe gnomes have traveled to &lt;a href=\"Hydro%2016\"&gt;Hydro 16&lt;/a&gt; with supplies and canoes, with many of them in the swamp.\n&lt;a href=\"Update%20v18.40\"&gt;Update v18.40&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvery previously mentioned gnome from the season has clustered at the edges of &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; in canoes, seemingly in an escape attempt of the island.\nOther, newer gnomes have appeared at bus stops, such as the one in &lt;a href=\"Retail%20Row\"&gt;Retail Row&lt;/a&gt;.

It was added in . \nDescription.\nThe Trailsmasher is a four-wheeled luxurious dark SUV used by &lt;a href=\"The%20Society\"&gt;The Society&lt;/a&gt; for all kinds of purposes, including military operations. The Trailsmasher, as suggested by its name, is suited for bursting through obstacles thanks to its high mass and visible spur on the model, and can handle all types of terrain fairly well.\nThe Trailsmasher seats four players, one driver and three passengers. The driver has full control of the vehicle and is able to move forward, reverse, steer, drift, navigate &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations\"&gt;Radio Stations&lt;/a&gt; and honk, while the passengers can fire their own &lt;a href=\"Weaponry\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; through their respective window after breaking it. The vehicle also has a windshield and a rear glass; all glass panels offer sheer additional protection to the crew, but are easily destructible, thus exposing the players inside upon breaking. Every tire can be individually popped, hindering steering and overall control for the driver as well as forcing the Trailsmasher to take damage over time as it travels (roughly -1HP every 0,5s per popped tire). Tires and windows can be restored with &lt;a href=\"Chrome\"&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Repair%20Torch\"&gt;Repair Torches&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Trailsmasher has a significant rectilinear top speed of 60km/h, only 10km/h less than a &lt;a href=\"Victory%20Motors%20Whiplash\"&gt;Whiplash's&lt;/a&gt;. Such speed can only be achieved on asphalt, railtracks or other appropriate surfaces, as the SUV performs better on road. Though, it still sports above average off-road capabilities compared to other &lt;a href=\"cars\"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt;, overall combining the rapidity of the &lt;a href=\"Islander%20Prevalent\"&gt;Prevalent&lt;/a&gt; with the adaptability and resistence of the &lt;a href=\"OG%20Bear\"&gt;OG Bear&lt;/a&gt;. It also features a not to underestimate drifting that is angularly similar to the &lt;a href=\"OG%20Bear\"&gt;OG Bear's&lt;/a&gt;, but considerably faster.\nThe Trailsmasher has a robust health bar of 1,050HP (more than an &lt;a href=\"OG%20Bear\"&gt;OG Bear&lt;/a&gt; but less than a &lt;a href=\"Titano%20Mudflap\"&gt;Mudflap&lt;/a&gt;). Once it reaches the null value, the vehicle will enter the vehicle death state and then explode, starting a &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; and leaving behind a wreckage prop bound to disappear within 20 seconds.\nLike other &lt;a href=\"vehicles\"&gt;vehicles&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"cars\"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt; category, it can be modded with and and has access to &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations\"&gt;Radio Stations&lt;/a&gt;.

It can also be used offensively to attack opponents.\nThe Grapple Blade has a unique triangular reticle. As the player gets close to a surface or opponent, the reticle will open up and a blue inverted triangle will appear. When this is present, the Grapple Blade can be used by pressing the aim button. This will launch the Grapple Blade forward quickly and it will attach itself to the surface it was aimed at. The player will be launched towards the target at a high rate of speed. The player is immune to fall damage while grappling and while falling after grappling.\nUsing this grapple effect depletes a charge from the blade. After 13 seconds, the blade regains one charge. It has four charges.\nConversely, when the fire button is pressed, the Grapple Blade becomes a weapon with different sets of attacks. If the player is grounded, the blade will slash outwards in front of the player in a wide arc. The fire button may be pressed again quickly for another slash that does a bit less damage. Slashing in this manner will have the player take a step forward, giving the blade a bit of extra range.

Gravity can be manipulated in Battle Royale via several methods. Oftentimes when a player's gravity is affected, they do not take fall damage, and will instead hit the ground with no damage taken, no matter the speed.\nGameplay.\nGravity can be affected in various ways in game, both by settings for starting a match, and by items. Battle Lab has three options for gravity. These are Earth (Standard), Moon (Lower) and Asteriod (Very Low). Players will still take fall damage on the latter two, but they must fall from a very high height.\nThe following items and mechanics will alter the player's gravity"}

Unnamed locations are unique, in that they exist as clear Points of Interest on the map, but do not have a label on the map (&lt;a href=\"Named%20Locations\"&gt;Named Locations&lt;/a&gt;) nor do they even inform the player they are in the vicinity of one (&lt;a href=\"Landmarks\"&gt;Landmarks&lt;/a&gt;).\nAs Landmarks were only first added in , they are considered as the replacement for Unnamed Locations. However, many notable locations without names still exist in Chapter 2 and beyond, and as such are listed here.\nDefining an Unnamed Location.\nUnnamed Locations are defined by having a signature point of interest, but the game does not highlight it as a landmark or named location. As such, many of these unnamed landmarks are unofficially named by the community, and do not have proper names in-game (although some may be labelled by external media). Unnamed Locations can be anything from a singular prop, to entire sets of buildings, all as long as the game doesn't specifically name them.

This is mainly downtime for a new patch, however some events allow you to log in, although it cannot be played and you cannot access the News tab, Battle Pass tab and Item Shop alongside other things. Events that caused Unplayable Periods are from Battle Royale.\nLists of Unplayable Periods.\nThis list does not include downtimes for updates, or times when there are server issues but remained online.\nWhat happened in these scenarios to make the game unplayable?\nThe Blackout.\nJust before the Blackout occurred, &lt;a href=\"The%20End\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt; event unfolded. &lt;a href=\"The%20Meteor\"&gt;The Meteor&lt;/a&gt; collided with &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; and the Zero Point began to contain itself, rendering the game unplayable for a total of 36 hours excluding the patch afterwards. \nTo Be Continued! ().\nJust before the To Be Continued! screen appeared, &lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer%20of%20Worlds\"&gt;The Devourer of Worlds&lt;/a&gt; event took place. &lt;a href=\"Galactus\"&gt;Galactus&lt;/a&gt; went through a rift in space to send us into the Countdown for around 8 hours excluding .\nTo Be Continued! ().\nJust before this version of the To Be Continued! screen appeared, was in the making. An &lt;a href=\"Abductors\"&gt;Abductor&lt;/a&gt; was about to hit &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; but was cut to black right before the impact. The countdown lasted about 13 hours.\nDrift To Artemis.\nJust before this version of The Blackout appeared, &lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28Chapter%202%29\"&gt;The End (Chapter 2)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Live%20Events\"&gt;Live Event&lt;/a&gt; had been active. The &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; island flipped and the &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt; island was revealed. The impact of the flip caused a tsunami to head towards the location of &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; and similar to Operation: Skyfire, the screen cut to black right before impact. A screen of the ocean appeared and had the outfit you were wearing at the time floating on a small log as the camera slowly zooms in. This Unplayable Period lasted for around 18 hours, although it was intended to last for around 3 days.\nGame Queues.\nQueue Times or Game Queues are periods of time where either the main game or launcher is accessible, but the user is softblocked from any actual content. This usually happens whenever &lt;a href=\"Epic%20Games\"&gt;Epic Games&lt;/a&gt; servers are crowded, or to reduce the influx of players loading into the game at once - which may happen at a time where many players may want to play at once, such as for a &lt;a href=\"Live%20Events\"&gt;Live Event&lt;/a&gt;, or the introduction of .\nDecember 29th 2021 Unplayable Period.\nThis Unplayable Period started with game queues, then Epic Games shutting the servers down at 16:00 UTC. This Unplayable Period lasted about 7 hours until servers went online again on 23:20 UTC. It is most likely caused by many players want to play at once, to open &lt;a href=\"Winterfest%202021\"&gt;Winterfest 2021&lt;/a&gt; presents. The &lt;a href=\"Crescent%20Shroom\"&gt;Crescent Shroom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Harvesting%20Tool\"&gt;Harvesting Tool&lt;/a&gt; was given to all players who played around the time of the downtime for free as a result of the Unplayable Period.\nFebruary 1st 2022 Unplayable Period.\n&lt;a href=\"Update%20v19.20\"&gt;Update v19.20&lt;/a&gt; was released on this day, introducing a new Named Location known as &lt;a href=\"Covert%20Cavern\"&gt;Covert Cavern&lt;/a&gt; and the return of the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Shotgun\"&gt;Heavy Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; while also introducing &lt;a href=\"Gunnar%27s%20Stinger%20SMG\"&gt;Gunnar's Stinger SMG&lt;/a&gt;. This made many players log in to the game at once to experience the new update, causing login issues before servers went offline at 21:00 UTC. The &lt;a href=\"Heart%27s%20Desire\"&gt;Heart's Desire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wrap\"&gt;Wrap&lt;/a&gt; was given to all players who played around the time of the downtime for free as a result of the Unplayable Period.\nMarch 20th 2022 Unplayable Period.\n&lt;a href=\"Update%20v20.00\"&gt;Update v20.00&lt;/a&gt; was released on this day, bringing in . For roughly 10+ hours, players were stuck in a queue, some up to 3 hours long. Eventually this was fixed.\nTo Be Continued! ().\nJust before the To Be Continued... screen appeared, &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; were seen gliding in the sky. They then fistbump before the screen fades into the Downtime for the start of .\nUpdate v22.10 Downtime.\nThis unplayable period started on October 3rd 2022 21:00 UTC because of server issues. As a result downtime for &lt;a href=\"Update%20v22.10\"&gt;Update v22.10&lt;/a&gt; started much earlier than the intended start time of October 4th 2022 8:00 UTC. The downtime for Update v22.10 is the longest unplayable period that does not involve a Live Event and a transition to a new season/chapter. The &lt;a href=\"Sweat-Free\"&gt;Sweat-Free&lt;/a&gt; Wrap was given to all players who logged in after the v22.10 downtime ended for free as a result of the Unplayable Period.\nAsteria's Gaze ().\nJust before this version of The Blackout appeared, the &lt;a href=\"Fracture\"&gt;Fracture&lt;/a&gt; live event took place. &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt; was heard activating Zero Fusion. The Zero Point then puts the surviving part of the island back together, forming &lt;a href=\"Asteria\"&gt;Asteria&lt;/a&gt;. This Unplayable Period lasted for around 9 hours.\nReality Rebirth ().\nWith all the worlds created out of The Big Bang &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; is left gazing at four of the main worlds they have visited. &lt;a href=\"LEGO%20Fortnite\"&gt;LEGO Fortnite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Racing\"&gt;Rocket Racing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fortnite%20Festival\"&gt;Fortnite Festival&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Royale\"&gt;Battle Royale&lt;/a&gt; while unable to see the &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt; island. This Unplayable Period lasted for around 11 hours.\nUpdate v29.00 Downtime.\nUpdate 29.00 was released on this day, bringing . This unplayable period started on March 8th 2024 08:00 UTC for downtime for a new season. At 14:00 UTC &lt;a href=\"https%3A//twitter.com/FortniteStatus\"&gt;Fortnite Status&lt;/a&gt; encountered an unexpected issue and turned off the servers for at least 8 hours. At 21:00 UTC Fortnite Status added another at least 4 hours to the downtime. At 03:00 UTC Fortnite was back online for Chapter 5 Season 2. This is the longest non event downtime period in Fortnite.\nKeep Dreaming With Juice WRLD ().\nLate rapper &lt;a href=\"Juice%20WRLD\"&gt;Juice WRLD&lt;/a&gt; disappeared into the stars above &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; after performing in . Afterwards, &lt;a href=\"the%20Looper\"&gt;the Looper&lt;/a&gt; was evacuated into a wormhole where they rendezvous with &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; before leaving for another reality.

It was confirmed to only be a prototype, after it was data-mined in &lt;a href=\"Update%20v11.30\"&gt;Update v11.30&lt;/a&gt;, and due to its removal, some of the cosmetics associated with it are &lt;a href=\"Unreleased%20Cosmetics\"&gt;yet to be released&lt;/a&gt;.\nSave the World Cosmetic Shop.\nSometime during &lt;a href=\"Season%207\"&gt;Season 7&lt;/a&gt;, the Battle Royale &lt;a href=\"Item%20Shop\"&gt;Item Shop&lt;/a&gt; was to be accessible via . This for whatever reason was never implemented.\nBattle Book.\nThe Battle Book was an early unused concept for the Battle Pass, scheduled to release at the end of Season 1. It was pushed back and eventually added in &lt;a href=\"Season%202\"&gt;Season 2&lt;/a&gt;, with the normal pass that is now familiar to the game. Strangely, this pass contained 100 Tiers, rather than the 70 which were included in the first few passes.\nBattle Bucks.\nA cut currency originally intended solely for Battle Royale.\nCompendium Challenges.\nCompendium Challenges were challenge bundles you could purchase with Battle Bucks that let you earn items from doing the challenges. Total rewards for doing every challenge in the 3 bundles were 27,200 &lt;a href=\"Season%20XP\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt; and 600 Battle Bucks.\nCrystals.\nCrystals were an item that was implented in the &lt;a href=\"Project%20Fortress\"&gt;first prototype builds of Fortnite&lt;/a&gt; from 2011-2012. Not much is known about them aside from them increasing the player's maximum health as seen in the only two gameplay videos of this build and that they could be obtained via killing &lt;a href=\"Monsters\"&gt;Monsters&lt;/a&gt;."}

Build huge forts, craft exotic weapons, find loot, and level up your squad while leading the world's remaining Heroes in the fight to save humanity and take back the world. You can watch our brand new gameplay trailer &lt;a href=\"https%3A//youtu.be/gZWg4iXp_lE%3Fsi%3DwAySf1aCzUBNZUVj\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to get a feel for the game and even pre-order a &lt;a href=\"Founder%27s%20Pack\"&gt;Founder's Pack&lt;/a&gt;.\nTHE SOUL OF FORTNITE.\nEverybody loves building forts. Whether it was blankets and couch cushions, or building a fort in the woods by your house, you and your friends could spend Saturday afternoons hiding out, or repelling monstrous hordes of imaginary creatures. This idea is universal. It\u2019s everywhere in stories and movies. It\u2019s Harry Potter defending Hogwarts from Voldemort's army, and Aragorn, standing against the orcs at Helm's deep. This idea inspired the rich, colorful world of Fortnite, where you and your friends are Heroes, building forts and making a stand against hordes of monsters, and of course, blowing them up.\nTHE GAME.\nThe world of Fortnite is expansive and uses a hybrid of procedural generation with sculpted \u201cpuzzle pieces\u201d to create interesting play spaces to explore. Almost anything can be harvested for loot and materials, and used for for crafting. Build the equipment you need, when you need it. Knowing when to spend your hard-earned resources is part of the strategy of mastering the world of Fortnite. \nLet\u2019s talk about the rewards you get in Fortnite. (Everyone likes to get stuff right?) Fortnite takes a bunch of Epic's gunplay know-how and smashes it together with a Diablo-style RPG system. We have a solid assortment of guns: sniper rifles, rocket launchers, lasers and shotguns galore all in your favorite rarity colored flavors. We also have a pile of close-combat weapons that range from claymores to katanas and my favorite: the rocket-powered sledgehammer. Along with weapons, players are also able to collect and recruit Defenders. These are specialist NPCs that help you hold the line against the Husk hordes.\nBuilding in Fortnite is designed to be usable before combat and in the heat of battle. Need to throw up a quick wall? It's a tap and a trigger away. Want to build more impressive structures? The editing tool puts the power of building customization in your hands, choosing between fences, windows, stairs, ramps and doors in your fort. Fortnite buildings can also be built from three different materials with different properties: wood, stone, and metal. Building coupled with the ability to craft a whole host of deadly traps, can eliminate creatures before they can even get to your Fort's walls! It's up to you to decide which one to use in a pinch. \nLast, but certainly not least, is classes and combat. Players collect hero cards drawn from a pool of four core classes:\nThese classes gives players certain edges in the fight to retake the world from the monsters. A well-balanced team can nearly always save the day, but mix-and-match different specialties to find all new effective combinations. Combat is fast and chaotic in Fortnite, with a diverse groups of monsters, trying to overwhelm you with hordes of Husks, or even flinging themselves onto the roof of your fortress in an attempt to burrow from above. You'll have to utilize all the tools in your toolbox to be successful at the top end of gameplay in Fortnite.\nThat's only the tip of the iceberg of all the things Fortnite has to offer, and as an online game we will be adding new content monthly(ish), with events, new heroes, new creatures, traps, and weapons. Fortnite is designed to continue to be built with the community, and represents a multi-year commitment from Epic Games. If the players want more Fortnite, we will keep making the world bigger, with big new features and gameplay types. \nWe are about to enter into a new phase of development, where players can be part of the paid Early Access. It is our intent that Fortnite will evolve into a free-to-play title during 2018. However, we wanted to give people the opportunity to gain Early Access to the game along with exclusive stuff and in-game events that come with Founder\u2019s Packs.\nSo if you want to come hang out with some cool folks, get tons of cool loot, and help make Fortnite more awesome \u2026 jump on board and help us build the community. Still not sure? That's cool too. You decide when you want to jump onto the train. We mean it. No BS. We will be here when you are ready to build kick-ass forts with your friends!\nQuestions/comments? Come hang out with the team. They are badasses and love making games for you. I'm really proud of the all the people who have contributed to the world of Fortnite, (devs and the community) and I'm really looking forward to more people taking back the world and making it their own!\nA SPECIAL NOTE TO THE CURRENT COMMUNITY.\nThis is a special shout out to all of you who\u2019ve been playing Fortnite through our online tests. You folks have been awesome, you\u2019ve been patient, and most importantly you\u2019ve been cool. For that we wanted to make sure we said thank you. As Epic likes to do, we are putting our money where our proverbial mouths are and giving you a few goodies and, an offer exclusively for players who participated in our online tests. You believed in the dream early, and we think that faith is amazing and should be rewarded. Also, let me invite you to stick around and continue to be part of our team as it\u2019s only going to get more awesome from here!\n\"-D\"\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

We\u2019re gonna need it. We\u2019ve got Smarter Smashers, and Husks Healing Husks headed our way. We\u2019re in for a frosty fight, Commanders\u201d - The General Homebase protocol dictates that Heroes be in tip top shape to deal with the new threats of the Husks. The General has supercharged Homebase\u2019s max level Heroes with more ability damage (up to +72% Ability Damage), reinforced Health and Shields (up to +42%), and significantly faster harvesting in late Twine Peaks.\nClip's Corner.\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk traps and weapons. I went ahead and fixed up your Ward Trap. I was thinking we could use something to take out lobber skulls and propane tanks, so say goodbye Ward Trap, and hello Anti-Air Trap. We tweaked the Gas Traps to have a tighter focus. They no longer deal DoT, so make sure you find a way to keep the husks under under your traps. And if you\u2019re like me, and you hate getting swarmed by thousands of angry bees, you\u2019ll be happy to know you can now use Gas Traps to take out bee swarms. In the latest round of testing, our Launcher Traps aren\u2019t able to get smashers off the ground. The problem is, Smashers are huge. Finally, I toned down The Storm King\u2019s Wrath a bit. Guess I didn\u2019t know my own strength when I made that one. It still packs a punch, but I\u2019ve made it eligible for a reset. Keep up the good fight out there!\u201d - Clip\nDirector's Update.\n\u201cOne of the side effects of being a Business Wolf\u2026 is wolflike efficiency! \u201d - Director Riggs Players will now be able to decide what rarity of items that are auto recycled via the settings option.

We\u2019ve got an action packed report for you, Commanders.\nHomebase Status Report\u2026 Initiate!\nTHIS WEEK - BUNDLE UP FOR THE WINTERFEST VENTURES SEASON.\nIt\u2019s time to grab your winter coats, Commanders. The next Save the World Ventures season begins on November 20th at 7PM ET.\nThe Winterfest Venture Zone modifier is the powerful Super Heroic Modifier. \nThe frosty Wintery winds swing this modifier in favor of Homebase\u2019s Heroes. Each class will gain super heroic benefits that play off of their current playstyle.\nSoldiers, do you love landing headshots? Great. The damage of headshots is doubled and you\u2019ll benefit from reduced cooldowns when eliminating Husks with ranged weapons. Sling bullets and grenades to your heart\u2019s Desire.\nConstructors, do you love building? Do you ever find yourself short on materials? You\u2019ll love the reduced building and repair costs. Prefer to swing a giant hammer? We\u2019ve got you covered. You\u2019ll benefit from reduced cooldowns when triggering Kinetic Overload and benefit from more impact damage as well.\nNinjas, a healthy blend of Melee and Ability weaving will be key with this modifier. Focus your efforts on ability eliminations to gain increased melee damage and attack speed. Use that to your advantage as melee eliminations also reduce your ability cooldowns. Synergize your playstyle for maximum efficiency. You\u2019ll also gain double the Shadowstance stats so get in their faces and show em\u2019 who's boss. \nOutlanders, it\u2019s time for some punchin\u2019 (looking at you, Jess) as Anti-Material charge will have no cost during this Ventures Season. For all you T.E.D.D.Y slingers out there, you\u2019ll benefit from a free Fragment every 50 seconds along with increased ability damage. \nThe crystalized winds of the Winter also make Husks more resistant to weapon and trap damage. Bring a healthy blend of Heroes to overcome their defenses. Nothing you can\u2019t handle, Commanders.\nNote on Winterfest Season: Thanks to your player feedback, the experience required to complete the season has been significantly reduced.\nPOWER UP WITH THE POWERHOUSE PACK!\nStarting Thursday, November 19 we\u2019re introducing a brand new Save the World Pack in the series: The Powerhouse Pack! \nReplacing the Samurai Scrapper Pack; The Powerhouse Pack introduces a new Hero, the Lectro Shock weapon schematic, Power Pack Back Bling, the Power House Challenges, and entry to Save the World. These exclusive Save the World challenges will earn you 1,000 V-Bucks and 1000 X-Ray Tickets.\n\"Note: The Cosmetic items of this Pack will be shared through Battle Royale, Save the World and Creative game modes. This new Pack series will have no impact on existing Founder daily login rewards or their V-Bucks earned, which is exclusive to early access Founders.\"\nCreative.\nTBA"}

THE SCURVY SHOALS VENTURE SEASON BEGINS.\nGet ready for a new Ventures Season, Commanders. The next Save the World Ventures Season -- Scurvy Shoals -- begins April 3 at 8PM ET and is expected to conclude on June 19 at 8PM ET. \n--WARNING-- The Husks are exceptionally Super during the Scurvy Shoals Venture Season. The Husks, now known as Super Husks, are packing some serious modifier power in the Scurvy Shoals Ventures missions. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in the field:\nSuper Melee Monsters - Takers and melee-based Husks move and attack faster, and their attacks slow Commanders by 30% for 5 seconds. Eliminating Super Melee Husks will stun smaller enemies in a small radius for a short amount of time. Chaining these stuns together may stun stronger Husks.\nSuper Ranged Monsters - Flingers, Pitchers, and Lobbers throw additional projectiles, while Zappers and Blasters fire twice as quickly. All their blasting efforts are causing them to have 30% less health.\nSuper Tough Husks - Husky Husks and Smashers have increased resistance to trap and ranged weapon damage, and deal increased damage to structures. Sure they\u2019re super, but all that smashing power causes them to move 20% slower. \nNow it\u2019s our turn, Commanders. Grab your gear because it\u2019s a shootin\u2019 and lootin\u2019 season. Eliminating Husks, especially those Smashers, causes them to periodically drop a chest full of valuable items. Greater monsters mean greater rewards and the more Husks we eliminate, the more chests we can loot. \nVentures isn\u2019t the only thing this week because...\nBRAVE THE DEPTHS OF THE DUNGEONS.\nThat\u2019s right! It\u2019s time to fight monsters, dodge traps, gear up and descend into the depths to confront the raging evil below. They say there are Weapons and Heroes to recruit along the way. Magical Keys, a deep and dark labyrinth, golden coins... sounds like it\u2019s time to do some exploring.

One way to do this is to release features to a very limited number of people for testing and feedback. Feedback and bug reports generated during testing help ensure that when the feature is released we have had a chance to fix critical issues, improve user experience and know what to expect when the feature is rolled out.\nWhat kind of features will be put into Beta rather than straight to release?\nFeatures which have a higher technical complexity or require a significant amount of user feedback before release.\nAre most features going to be Beta tested before being released?\nNo. Only features which really require targeted testing or feedback will go through the Beta process.\nHow long will features remain in Beta?\nWe want features to remain in Beta for the shortest amount of time possible. It\u2019s impossible to predict exactly how long any feature will remain in Beta - and it\u2019s always possible that a Beta feature will not be released after testing or reworked significantly. \nCan I join the Beta program?\nThe number of people participating in the program is deliberately tiny. The group\u2019s purpose is to help our team with very focused testing and provide specific feedback on the features they are testing out. We want to keep the number of people testing these features small to minimize any potential impact to the live service or any disruption to the majority of players. For this reason, we are not accepting applications to join the program at this time.\nSave the World.\nSee the entire &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/save-the-worlds-newest-update-4-13-2021\"&gt;Homebase Report&lt;/a&gt; for more."}

To help you make the best use of all that space, these Islands use the new Spatial Thermometer system. Check out the introduction to the Spatial Thermometer and XL Islands below, or &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.epicgames.com/fortnite/creative/docs/spatial-thermometer-in-fortnite-creative\"&gt;read about them in more detail on the documentation website&lt;/a&gt;.\nLarge Team Support.\nAll devices which have Team settings can now support up to 50 teams, allowing for properly constructed large-scale Trios, Duos, and free-for-all matches.\nIncreased Channels.\nWith more space to work in, we know you\u2019re going to need more Channels to operate your amazing campaigns, conflicts, and contraptions \u2014 so the Channel limit has been raised from 150 to 200 with v16.50.\nConditional Button Updates.\nWe\u2019ve made a significant update to the Conditional Button to allow it to handle multiple items and custom stack sizes. We\u2019ve also made a bunch of updates for its usability for players.\n&lt;a href=\"Islands\"&gt;Islands&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are four new XL Island templates being added in this release:\nWhen working with these Islands, you will automatically be using the new Spatial Thermometer.\nSpatial Thermometer.\nXL Islands handle memory budgets differently from normal-sized Islands. Much more can be placed in an XL Island, as long as any one area has about the same amount of memory use as a normal Island.\nExisting Islands work by loading everything into memory and keeping it there at all times. The size of these new XL islands allows us to manage memory by unloading unused/unseen props and geometry. As players move around the Island, the system only loads in the things that the players can see.\nMemory use is shown in two ways: the Memory Bar and a Heat Map that overlays the map.\nHeat Map.\nThe Heat Map shows you a color-coded representation of the cells on your Island. You can see this information in the minimap for cells nearby, or for the whole Island by opening the map screen. The colors on the cells give you an idea of the amount of memory that each cell is currently using.\nIf you have hit the limit in any cell on your Island (you\u2019ll see a padlock), you will be restricted from placing more objects in that cell\u2019s area. You will have to bring those locked cells back under the memory budget before you can place any more objects in their range, or place devices anywhere on the Island.\nTips for reducing memory in cells:\nThe Spatial Thermometer is still a work in progress and we hope to improve it in various ways in future releases. We would love to get your feedback on improvements you would like to see, so please share your ideas with us through the usual channels.\nKnown Issues:\nConsumables.\nAdded 6 different Keycards that will work with the Conditional Button and Capture Area devices and can be given to players with devices such as the Item Spawner and Item Granter. Equipping a Keycard will also visually guide you to the appropriate Conditional Button if it is registered as a Key Item.

Fortunately, we\u2019re able to collect data on them while also investigating Doctor Slone and the IO in general. We believe the Aliens and IO have advanced tech in the works for the future, but we've put together some files on the tech they\u2019re using against each other right now (files attached). We\u2019re going to keep investigating. \nIt\u2019s recommended we take advantage of this technology for our own protection.\n-Mari\nFiles on Alien and IO Inventions.\n&lt;a href=\"Saucer\"&gt;SAUCERS&lt;/a&gt;\nTry not to let a UFO (called \u201c&lt;a href=\"Saucer\"&gt;Saucer&lt;/a&gt;\u201d by the Aliens\u2026 and us) catch you. It won\u2019t eliminate you, but in an act of merciful rudeness, it will take you to a random place on the Island. \nYou don\u2019t have to run, though. Shoot a &lt;a href=\"Saucer\"&gt;Saucer&lt;/a&gt; down and it\u2019s yours to pilot. The &lt;a href=\"Saucer\"&gt;Saucer&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s equipped with an abduction beam and an energy cannon. Let your squad stand on top for extra offense!\n&lt;a href=\"Kymera%20Ray%20Gun\"&gt;KYMERA RAY GUN&lt;/a&gt;\nThis Alien creation fires a continuous beam and only needs to stop to recharge. We\u2019re not quite sure who \u201cKymera\u201d is, though. \nWhen we tested this weapon out, it seemed powerful\u2026 but not so much on structures. If the Aliens succeed, at least we know how to take cover. \n&lt;a href=\"Pulse%20Rifle\"&gt;PULSE RIFLE&lt;/a&gt;\nAn invention from the IO, the self-proclaimed Island defenders. The IO brags this weapon is effective whether aiming down sights or not. Reliability is its key feature, they claim.\n&lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; has a special, more powerful version of the &lt;a href=\"Pulse%20Rifle\"&gt;Pulse Rifle&lt;/a&gt; reserved for herself, so you\u2019ll need to get confrontational to call it your own.\n&lt;a href=\"Recon%20Scanner\"&gt;RECON SCANNER&lt;/a&gt;\nAnother IO invention. Survey an area from a safe distance by firing its Recon Bolts, which mark all opponents (and Chests) in its diameter. There\u2019s a limited amount of Bolts you can have out at a time, but don\u2019t worry about finding more: the &lt;a href=\"Recon%20Scanner\"&gt;Recon Scanner&lt;/a&gt; regenerates Bolts automatically. \n&lt;a href=\"Rail%20Gun\"&gt;RAIL GUN&lt;/a&gt;\nOne would expect the &lt;a href=\"Rail%20Gun\"&gt;Rail Gun&lt;/a&gt; to be from out of this world. However, it was actually created by the IO. This sniper can shoot through surfaces, but this breakthrough is balanced out by its visible targeting beam. Not a surprise from the IO, it does extra damage against &lt;a href=\"Saucer\"&gt;Saucers&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrafting File: Nuts and Bolts.\nThe arrival of Saucers has made it rain &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;Nuts and Bolts&lt;/a&gt;, adding a new dynamic to crafting on the &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt;. With this new crafting ingredient, you can craft familiar weapons from the Island\u2019s past. Combine Nuts and Bolts with any &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Rifle\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href=\"Burst%20Assault%20Rifle\"&gt;Burst Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, with any &lt;a href=\"Submachine%20Gun\"&gt;Submachine Gun&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20Fire%20SMG\"&gt;Rapid Fire SMG&lt;/a&gt;, and with any Shotgun for a &lt;a href=\"Lever%20Action%20Shotgun\"&gt;Lever Action Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;. \nThese craftable weapons don\u2019t have pre-built versions to pick up, so collect any Nuts and Bolts you come across. It seems Nuts and Bolts have replaced Mechanical Parts and Animal Bones, which would explain why we haven\u2019t seen any Makeshift weapons around.\nA File for the Future.\nWe\u2019ve made files for all we know so far, but like we said, we believe there\u2019s more to come from the Aliens and IO. It\u2019s only a matter of time before a new surprise descends upon us...\n= \"Creative\" =\nIntroduction.\nA new season of Fortnite is here, and v17.00\u2019s update for Fortnite Creative brings a new Hub Island template and gallery prefab, as well as the HUD Controller device to allow you to get rid of unnecessary clutter. The update also delivers a visual to several devices and additional gameplay adjustments to assist Creators. \nHud Controller Device.\nWe know not every game is about shooting/building/editing, and we\u2019ve taken that into account with the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"HUD%20Controller\"&gt;HUD Controller&lt;/a&gt;. Inspired by Creator feedback, with this device you can now hide elements of the player HUD that aren\u2019t relevant to your game, allowing your players to experience a more streamlined look and feel. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/using-hud-controller-devices-in-fortnite-creative\"&gt;Read more details on the Hud Controller Device within the Fortnite Creative Documentation website&lt;/a&gt;.\nHub Island Template.\nTo improve the player experience when entering Creator Hubs, we\u2019ve updated the Hub Island to include two new templates: the Hub Spoke and Hub Cardinal. \nThe Hub Spoke template includes matchmaking portals that are now closer and are displayed in a rounded setup. There will also be three upfront and center matchmaking portals with interactive switches to turn on/off each area's matchmaking portals.\nThe Hub Cardinal is an additional style that is similar to the spoke but features matchmaking portals to the North, East, South, and West. \nPrefabs &amp; Galleries Get Glass.\nThe new update introduces glass prefabs and galleries for the first time to Fortnite Creative. Shout out to @MaferWorld for coming up with the community concept for the Glass Material Set!\nWithin the set, Creators can select the color of each individual asset and also resize or move these assets to create layered works of art. The set features a Glass Gallery of building assets and a Glass Prop Gallery.\nMatchmaking Changes With Play Menu.\nThe first change you will notice is the removal of the featured portals. Previously, when matchmaking into Creative mode through the Play menu, players could adjust the Featured Islands from the kiosk. We\u2019ve made this change to give players a better opportunity to discover new islands and experiences organically to discover new islands for our players and creators. Note:The Featured portals available through the Create menu will still be available.\nGameplay Updates.\nWe\u2019ve made quality of life changes to the following areas\nGameplay.\nBug fixes\nvIsland.\nBug fixes\nUI.\nBug fixes\nTools.\nBug fixes"}

First the Mothership, then the Saucers, and now\u2026 Abductors? We think that might be what the Aliens call them, as the IO seems to use this term regularly.\nWe\u2019ve put together some more files for all you to look at. (See attached.)\n-Mari\nFile on Abductors.\nAbductors hover over certain places and... kind of just stay put. But only for a little while. After some time, it\u2019ll send beams at the ground, taking away those who decide to walk in them. Some who claim to have been abducted say they were taken to the Mothership, but we don\u2019t know what the Aliens would have to gain. Why let people see the Mothership then bring them back home?\nIn any case, there seems to be more in it for the abductees than the Aliens. After returning, abductees tend to come back with powerful weapons. \u201cThe more orange-looking orbs we were able to collect in the Mothership, the better stuff we were allowed to leave with,\u201d one abductee says. \u201cWe could even extend the time limit if we found orbs with the little clocks on them.\u201d\nYou can see the locations of Abductors on your map. They visit in cycles, so we recommend investigating them thoroughly each time they\u2019re here. Because Abductors only have so much space, there\u2019s a capacity as to how many one can abduct at once.\nFile on Alien Parasites.\nIt makes sense that Aliens would have their own version of wildlife. And it looks like their wildlife is very keen on ours. The Aliens have unleashed a parasitic species on the Island, introducing a new danger to the ecosystem. However, they\u2019re actually more helpful than the Aliens probably intended.\nKnown simply as Parasites, if one of these mini-Aliens attach to your head, they\u2019ll drain your Health down to 60. (Shield remains unaffected.) But this relationship is more give-and-take than it seems. Not only do they protect you from headshot damage, but they also make you run faster and jump higher. Parasites have an aversion to water, fire, and, unsurprisingly, attacks.\nThese creatures can often be seen parasitizing chickens, boars, and wolves. If you take damage from parasitized wildlife, their slime will gradually deplete some of your Health. Defeating an animal with a Parasite on it will make that Parasite jump on you, which could very well be a sound strategy. We expect their population to grow as they adapt to the Island.\n\"What else is new in Fortnite Battle Royale in v17.10:\"\nSaucers Hacked By IO Operatives.\nIn a decisive blow against the Alien invaders, the Imagined Order has hacked their flying Saucers. The rate of fire on their ship\u2019s plasma barrage has been reduced, allowing for a bigger window to counter-attack and shoot them right out of the sky! \nRecon Scanners Hacked By Aliens.\nIn response to their Saucers being hacked, the Aliens have retaliated against the IO. Recon Scanners now take additional time to recharge, and the lifetime of Recon Bolts has been reduced.\nSuper Level Styles Now Available.\nReached Level 100 and looking for more shine? Silver, Gold, and Prismatic pages have been added to the \u201cBonus Rewards\u201d Battle Pass section for Sunny, Guggimon, Zyg, Doctor Slone, and Rick Sanchez. Even past Level 100, you\u2019ll continue to earn Battle Stars to unlock new Styles for your favorite Battle Pass Characters!\nNew NPCs.\n&lt;a href=\"Brutus\"&gt;Brutus&lt;/a&gt; is on vacation and has arrived in &lt;a href=\"Believer%20Beach\"&gt;Believer Beach&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Beach%20Brutus\"&gt;Beach Brutus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Human%20Bill\"&gt;Human Bill&lt;/a&gt; arrived at &lt;a href=\"Steamy%20Stacks\"&gt;Steamy Stacks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Joey\"&gt;Joey&lt;/a&gt; now will occasionally appear at &lt;a href=\"Believer%20Beach\"&gt;Believer Beach&lt;/a&gt; to check out the &lt;a href=\"Cosmic%20Summer%20Celebration\"&gt;Party&lt;/a&gt;. \nNew type of Characters has been added, they would heal you for emoting with them; Go dance with them!\nBe careful with who you talk to in the island, it may not be who you think it is; It is rumoured that undercover Aliens have taken the skin of multiple people in the Island, they sell a &lt;a href=\"Kymera%20Ray%20Gun\"&gt;Ray Gun&lt;/a&gt; and may attack you if you blow their disguise!\n&lt;a href=\"Zyg\"&gt;Zyg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Choppy\"&gt;Choppy&lt;/a&gt; have arrived in &lt;a href=\"Hydro%2016\"&gt;Hydro 16&lt;/a&gt;, rumour is that when they are defeated they will drop a &lt;a href=\"Zyg%20and%20Choppy%27s%20Ray%20Gun\"&gt;Ray Gun&lt;/a&gt;!

(See attached.)\n-Mari\nFile on Alien Nanites.\nWith the latest Alien invention to be discovered \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Alien%20Nanites\"&gt;Alien Nanites&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 you can recreate the atmosphere of their home planet. Throw one down to create a low-gravity biome that you can exit and enter. It\u2019s as thick as gelatin (their planet\u2019s probably super humid), so you\u2019ll practically start swimming when you jump. To descend faster in the biome, try crouching. Also: you won\u2019t get hurt if you jump out of one from a high place.\nEven if you don\u2019t throw one down, Alien Nanites still have a purpose. Like &lt;a href=\"Nuts%20%27n%27%20Bolts\"&gt;Nuts and Bolts&lt;/a&gt;, they can be used as a crafting ingredient: combine one with a + &lt;a href=\"Submachine%20Guns\"&gt;Submachine Gun&lt;/a&gt; to create a &lt;a href=\"Kymera%20Ray%20Gun\"&gt;Kymera Ray Gun&lt;/a&gt;. In a blow to the IO, it can be used to craft their weapons as well: combine one with a + &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Weapons\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt; to create a &lt;a href=\"Pulse%20Rifle\"&gt;Pulse Rifle&lt;/a&gt; and with a + &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifles\"&gt;Sniper&lt;/a&gt; to create a &lt;a href=\"Rail%20Gun\"&gt;Rail Gun&lt;/a&gt;. Alien Nanites can be found on the ground, on top of Abductors, and in the Mothership.\nFile on... Zyg and Choppy\u2019s Ray Gun?\nAn Alien named &lt;a href=\"Choppy\"&gt;Choppy&lt;/a&gt; and a robot called &lt;a href=\"Zyg\"&gt;Zyg&lt;/a&gt; have begun wandering the Island, planting what seems to be Parasite eggs. (Benefit of the doubt: we think the robot\u2019s just doing the bidding of the Alien). They\u2019ve made their first stop towards the south of the Island. If you decide to hinder their plans, you can get their special Ray Gun, a more powerful version of the standard Kymera one.\n\"What else is new in Battle Royale in v17.10 - July 6 Hotfix:\"\n&lt;a href=\"Holly%20Hedges\"&gt;Holly Hedges&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Holly%20Hatchery\"&gt;Taken Over by Aliens&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Aliens have moved in and put up their three-toed feet at the once quiet Holly Hedges. Alien biomes have started forming around houses, new flora is sprouting to match their homeworld, and the IO's investigation team is curious what's going on.

(Tip: Rolling downhill with an Inflate-A-Bull is a LOT faster than just running downhill.) You can also inflate it to squash a &lt;a href=\"Alien%20Parasites\"&gt;Parasite&lt;/a&gt; that\u2019s attached to you, &lt;a href=\"Update%20v17.10\"&gt;if you\u2019re not looking for its help&lt;/a&gt;. The \u201cBull\u201d may attract the attention of Saucers when inflated, but its evasive advantages are worth it.\nThe Inflate-A-Bull is not invincible: it will pop if it gets shot. (You\u2019ll fortunately be protected from the shot.) Once popped, it takes a while to self-repair and become available for use again. However, if you decide to deflate it yourself manually, it'll be ready for use again in much less time. Like the &lt;a href=\"Recon%20Scanner\"&gt;Recon Scanner&lt;/a&gt;, this invention has been herded into IO Chests and normal Chests. Track how much more you can use one with its usage bar.\n\"What else is new in Battle Royale in v17.10 - July 13 Hotfix:\"\nFrom Holly Hedges to Holly Hatchery.\nAfter the Aliens made residence at &lt;a href=\"Holly%20Hedges\"&gt;Holly Hedges&lt;/a&gt; last week, their biomes are continuing to cover the neighborhood.

They\u2019ve begun nurturing Parasites at the location, so much so they now refer to it as \u201c&lt;a href=\"Holly%20Hatchery\"&gt;Holly Hatchery&lt;/a&gt;.\u201d If you\u2019re looking for a boost in speed or more pep in your step, this is a reliable place to get these Parasite-provided powers.

What\u2019s the big deal about these? An electrical dome will surround them as they slowly move forward, and enemies who get caught in the dome will take heavy damage and be impulsed back. Vehicles are affected in the same way. Tip: if you find a way to keep enemies in the dome even when impulsed, they will take repeated damage. \nHow the Plasma Cannon affects buildings is a different story. Fearing Aliens may prove to be advanced architects, the IO made it so that the Plasma Cannon destroys structures just about instantly. The Plasma Cannon can be crafted in addition to being found. Because the IO used Alien technology to invent it, it can be crafted by combining a Legendary Pistol with an Alien Nanite.\nWith one Plasma Cannon, one plasma ball can be deployed at a time.

Here\u2019s everything we know about this resourceful Alien weapon (file attached).\n-Mari\nFile on &lt;a href=\"Grab-itron\"&gt;Grab-itron&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometimes called a \u201cUFO in your hands\u201d by the IO or a \u201cportable ordinary aircraft\u201d by the Aliens, you can use this weapon to pull in objects that are in front of you. (This one\u2019s a doozy.) Pull in an object with its flying disc, take it along with you, then launch it at an opponent. How much damage it deals depends on how big it is, what it\u2019s made of, and its launch speed. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Grab-itron\"&gt;Grab-itron&lt;/a&gt; isn\u2019t only for offense. If you have an object pulled in, that object will block damage coming from in front of you \u2014 until it can endure damage no longer. Also: try using the Grab-itron to catch incoming explosives and propel them back.

A giant tractor beam from the Mothership currently envelops Slurpy Swamp, lifting this industrial district to its untimely demise. \nA POI being abducted may be a cause for concern, but you could also look at it as a new battle strategy. An entire district like Slurpy Swamp is quite heavy, so the tractor beam has no choice but to break it up into chunks as it lifts it. While you\u2019re in the low-gravity tractor beam, jump from platform to platform, maneuvering around your opponents with nimbleness. \nAbducting a whole POI isn\u2019t something that happens overnight, so keep checking back throughout the week to see how the abduction has progressed. \nNew LTM: Team Brawl!\nEnjoy the close combat of a small Storm circle? Want to get right back into the action after respawning? In the new Team Brawl Limited Time Mode, compete with your team to reach 60 eliminations before the other team. If you get eliminated, you\u2019ll respawn by plummeting to the ground instead of skydiving, ensuring you get back to the brawl right away.\nYou\u2019ll be given a new loadout at the start and each time you respawn. Matches take place at a single POI, and the POI\u2019s non-player buildings are extra strong for better protection. The other team outdoing yours? Don\u2019t throw in the towel yet \u2014 if they\u2019re too far ahead in eliminations, you\u2019ll be lended a helping hand. All the team\u2019s players will become marked in your view and visible behind walls. These effects expire when the lead lowers by a certain amount.\nTeam Brawl will go live on August 5, 2021, at 9 AM ET. Get ready for this fast-paced new mode!\nMisc..\n= \"Creative\" =\nIntroduction.\nThe Creative v17.30 update is live, with highlights including the Skydome, Wildlife Spawner, and Customizable Lights!\nSKYDOME.\nA true patch \u201chigh light\u201d, the Skydome device provides the ability for you to illuminate your island! The Skydome will replace the default island sky box with your own custom version. Edit the properties of your world\u2019s sun or moon and blend gradients of color for the skyline to create the perfect atmosphere and switch between different skydomes using triggers. We\u2019ll be adding more features to the Skydome, including the ability to create smaller Skydome \u201cvolumes\u201d within your island, more colors and more control over light sources very soon.\nWILDLIFE SPAWNER.\nRaptors, wolves, boars, chickens and frogs have arrived in Fortnite Creative. The Wildlife Spawner lets you add and control animals, along with hunting, baiting and taming mechanics, to\u00a0 allow you to give your Creative experience a touch of the wild side.\nCUSTOMIZABLE LIGHTS.\nAlways wanted to add that little touch of ambiance or atmosphere to your experience? The ominous glow of a pulsing red warning light, the disconcerting flicker of a broken street lamp, the ultimate disco party - now these are all possible with the new Customizable Light device.\u00a0 With a range of colors and effects, as well as the ability to switch between point lights and spotlights, now you can bring a whole new level of intensity to whatever you\u2019re building.\nACCESSIBILITY: As with any device which allows you to manipulate colors and lights. Please always be thoughtful about players who may be sensitive to flashing colors, photosensitivity, and lights and take care when placing these devices\nMATCHMAKING PORTAL.\nWe\u2019ve added a new option to the Matchmaking Portal device to allow players to create private games as well as joining public games.\nJoin Options\nImportant Note: With this change, older islands which have not been republished recently could give an error when players try to enter them via matchmaking portals. If this occurs, republishing the Island should resolve the issue.\nUpdate: The Matchmaking Portal\u2019s \u2019\u201cJoin Options\u201d are something we plan to add when the Matchmaking Portal is updated in a future release. We\u2019ve updated this post and the \u00a0Fortnite Creative Documentation website to reflect the device\u2019s current functionality.\nUI FIXES.\n= \"Save the World\" =\nIntroduction.\nCalling All Commanders,\nThe Hit The Road Venture season rages on!

{"id": "78653", "revid": "49555758", "url": "https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki?curid=78653", "title": "Update v18.00", "text": " \nUpdate v18.00 of &lt;a href=\"Fortnite\"&gt;Fortnite&lt;/a&gt; was released on September 13th 2021. It started .\n= \"Battle Royale\" =\nIntroduction.\n\"From the desk of J.B. Chimpanski.\"\nThe Alien and IO war is over, but a new war has taken shape, one where YOU\u2019RE a combatant. After Slone double-crossed you and left you to perish on the Mothership, the Cubes that powered it are now free. These things are a bigger threat to the Island than those Aliens could've ever been. They have no face, no speech, but they\u2019re sentient and have six sides of malice.\nIf you think the corruption they\u2019ve caused is bad now, you have no idea what can happen if we let them stomp all over the Island. It doesn\u2019t matter if you were pro-Alien or pro-IO, it\u2019ll take all the help we can get to keep the Island from falling. It\u2019s up to everybody \u2014 including you \u2014 so take my information below and put it to good use. \nThings Are Going Sideways.\nYou know what\u2019s scary? A dark, malevolent, monster-filled reality called \u201cThe Sideways.\u201d Well, &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube\"&gt;the Cubes&lt;/a&gt; aren\u2019t only spreading corruption \u2014 they\u2019re spreading portals to The Sideways too (\u201cSideways Anomalies\u201d). Gravity is very low in this mysterious world, and the air is unfriendly to building.\nThis world isn\u2019t just colliding with our world. It\u2019s bleeding into it, meaning a certain POI will be covered in Sideways each match. These altered POIs are known as Sideways Zones, and I\u2019m gonna tell you how you can use both Sideways Anomalies and Zones to your advantage... \nRev Up Sideways Weapons.\nThe Sideways ain\u2019t ALL monsters. Sure, the &lt;a href=\"Cube%20Monsters\"&gt;Cube Monsters&lt;/a&gt; will keep on coming after you enter an Anomaly, but you\u2019ll earn Sideways weapons as you best them. Also, defeated monsters drop &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;Cube Monster Parts&lt;/a&gt;, a crafting ingredient you can use to upgrade Sideways weapons. Be smart: take these weapons and parts with you after leaving an Anomaly.\nSideways Zones are a little bit different. Monsters don\u2019t fight in mobs, and Sideways weapons can be found as loot, so these places present a different way to fortify yourself. What\u2019s special about Sideways weapons? With the &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rifle\"&gt;Sideways Rifle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Minigun\"&gt;Sideways Minigun&lt;/a&gt;, you\u2019ll deal bonus damage by revving them to their superpowered state. In other words, have \u2018em close to overheating for extra effectiveness.\nJoin The Global Effort.\nWhen I said it\u2019s up to everybody to protect the &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt;, I meant it. The war effort against &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube\"&gt;the Cubes&lt;/a&gt; will require support far and wide. And guess what? You get to help direct it. \nYour first act of influence? With fellow Loopers across the Island, donate the &lt;a href=\"Bars\"&gt;Bars&lt;/a&gt; you earn to construction sites where you want to see Turret Stations built up. In the future, we\u2019ll need you to come together and decide which new weapons to develop, which ones to unvault, and more.\nNew Tools Of Trade.\nBut not everything needs &lt;a href=\"Bars\"&gt;Bars&lt;/a&gt; to scrap together, and your man J.B. is rolling out new and returning tricks on the house. I\u2019ve pulled a couple of my favorites out of storage like the &lt;a href=\"Automatic%20Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Automatic Sniper Rifle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Harpoon%20Gun\"&gt;Harpoon Gun&lt;/a&gt; to help you turn the tide.\n&lt;a href=\"Crafting%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;Nuts &amp; Bolts&lt;/a&gt; are still around if you want to upgrade your weapon to something different, like transforming your trusty &lt;a href=\"Lever%20Action%20Shotgun\"&gt;Lever Action Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; into the pressurized &lt;a href=\"Charge%20Shotgun\"&gt;Charge Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; or switching an Assault Rifle to the stealthy &lt;a href=\"Suppressed%20Assault%20Rifle\"&gt;Suppressed Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt;. Those Sideways troublemakers won\u2019t go down without a fight, trust me, so be on the lookout for more goodies to show \u2018em who\u2019s boss.\nCubes... Cubes Everywhere.\nConcentrated mostly around the crashed wreckage of &lt;a href=\"The%20Mothership\"&gt;the Mothership&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube\"&gt;the Cubes&lt;/a&gt; have an effect on the nearby environment (that corruption I was talking about). Some of the ship\u2019s tech still works, surprisingly, and its anti-grav tunnels can transport groups around in loops. \nThe Monster Hunter who calls herself &lt;a href=\"Torin\"&gt;Torin&lt;/a&gt; has been investigating the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Stone\"&gt;Shadow Stones&lt;/a&gt; scattered amidst the rubble. Consume one and you\u2019ll temporarily become a shadow-like apparition, handy for dashing around obscured. Some fish must\u2019ve gotten their fins on one because there\u2019ve been reports of cubic &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Flopper\"&gt;Shadow Floppers&lt;/a&gt; pulled from the water too. \n&lt;a href=\"The%20Cube\"&gt;The Cubes&lt;/a&gt; are up to something, bet your bananas on that. I\u2019m not too sure what the Golden one is all about, but the others seem to almost\u2026 follow it. Keep an eye on this for me, would ya? \nParty Quests and Punch Cards.\nResidents on the &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt; need your assistance. In fact, they\u2019ve each got a Punch Card full of missions for you to lend a hand with. Work with &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Jonesy\"&gt;Dark Jonesy&lt;/a&gt; to uncover what\u2019s really going on at the Kevolution facility or follow along with Charlotte to investigate the IO. Over the weeks, new residents will join in asking for your assistance to discover more about the &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuesting is always better in a party, so why not help each other out! Party Quests are picked up by chatting with residents or using Phone Booths during your adventures. They\u2019ll also appear in your log daily, and believe me, they give a great deal of Bars to everyone who helped out.\nYou share your Party Quests and rewards with everyone in your party, so the more Loopers you roll with, the more Quests you can complete together. Everyone in a party contributes to everyone\u2019s Party Quests, so round up a Squad and get to work!\nRemember: I\u2019m getting involved in this out of the kindness of my heart, so don\u2019t let me down!\n- J.B."}
