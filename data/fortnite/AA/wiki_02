It was introduced in the &lt;a href=\"Pre-Season\"&gt;Pre-Season&lt;/a&gt;. Health is a fundamental part of Battle Royale, as it dictates the survivability of the player, in how much damage they can take from specific sources. \nFunctionality.\nHP is a combined value of both your Health levels, and your &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Potion\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt; Levels for each player in a match. Health is positively affected from &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Items\"&gt;Healing Items&lt;/a&gt;, and negatively affected from damaging items, such as weapons or &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt;. Players start with 100 Health and 0 Shield in standard Battle Royale playlists. In Creative, the maximum Health and Shield can be adjusted. \nHealth.\nHealth is the term used to refer to the Green bar attributed to each player. Health determines whether a player can be eliminated / knocked, as when it reaches 0, the player will be knocked (in Squad based modes, in &lt;a href=\"Solo\"&gt;Solos&lt;/a&gt; they will simply be eliminated). Health is taken away from the player after their Shield and or Overshield level reaches 0. Some items and damage will bypass this rule, such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt; or Fall Damage.\nVehicle Health.\nWhen riding a &lt;a href=\"Vehicles\"&gt;vehicle&lt;/a&gt;, a separate Health bar appears for the vehicle above the shield bar. When it reaches 0, the vehicle is destroyed.\nShield.\nShield is the term used to refer to the Blue health bar attributed to each player. Shield is used to protect the player's health value, and to increase the player's health in general and to absorb more damage before being knocked. Shield will be taken away first unless an Overshield is present. If the player reaches 0 Health but still has shield, they will retain the shield when knocked, but only once revived. When knocked, the player will not have shield protection.\nOvershield.\nOvershield is a mechanic which gives the player 50 extra Shield on top of their existing 200 HP threshold. Overshield is a separate measure, regenerating over time and not contributing to any healing items which cap at a certain amount of shield. Players will take damage to overshield first, and it will regenerate slowly after several seconds of not taking damage. It is also not given to the player on immediate spawn, instead generating several seconds after leaving the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Bus\"&gt;Battle Bus&lt;/a&gt; as well as several seconds after being rebooted or revived. It is only present in Zero Build playlists.\nDown But Not Out (Knocked).\nDown But Not Out (or DBNO in short) is the term used to refer to players who have had all of their health removed. The player will briefly become invincible, but afterwards be vulnerable to attacks. The player will lose 2 Health per second when knocked, and their Health bar will be red. This Health can be restored to prolong death indefinitely via different means. When the player loses all their Health in this state, they will be eliminated and drop a &lt;a href=\"Reboot%20Card\"&gt;Reboot Card&lt;/a&gt; (if the mode allows rebooting). If the player is knocked when they still have shield, upon being revived, the Shield will remain, but the player does not receive the protection when knocked, unless the shield was applied when they were already knocked through something like &lt;a href=\"FlowBerry%20Fizz\"&gt;Flowberry Fizz&lt;/a&gt;, in which case they will take shield damage while knocked. Players can revive a knocked player, by interacting with them for 10 seconds. In Trios or Squads, having multiple teammates interact a downed player will speed up the revive. On revival, the player will return to 30 Health.\nIncreasing HP.\nHP (Hit Points) can be increased in various ways, both Health and Shield. Items that increase health can be found at the &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Items\"&gt;Healing Items&lt;/a&gt; page. Items which can heal both Health and Shield are known as Effective Health items. Some items such as the &lt;a href=\"Infinity%20Blade\"&gt;Infinity Blade&lt;/a&gt; increase the total HP pool, rather than filling it back to full.\nDealing Damage.\nWhen dealing damage to an enemy, the damage points that have been dealt appear above the enemy. They can be different colors depending if the damage reduces Health or Shield. The tags do not appear when receiving damage from an enemy, but a blue (for Shield Damage) or red (for Health Damage) arc appears indicating the direction of where the damage was received. \nThe damage tags are rounded to the nearest integer, making it appear to deal 200 damage but not cause an elimination. For example a headshot with an Ranger Shotgun deals 159.75 damage, but is displayed in game as 160 damage, and two hits with the Harvesting Tool is 40 damage for a total of 199.75 damage. Because of the rounding it would display as 200 total damage but leaves the opponent with 1 HP from the full 200 HP.\nItems that Affect Health Values.\nAs a general rule, all &lt;a href=\"Weaponry%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; will lower a player's HP when they are attacked by an opponent. On top of this all listed &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Items\"&gt;Healing Items&lt;/a&gt; impact HP.\nBelow are a list of sources that will lower a Player's Health without impacting their Shield Values however. As well as the listed items, &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt;, Fall Damage, Lava &lt;a href=\"Alien%20Parasites\"&gt;Alien Parasites&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Raz%23AI\"&gt;Glyph Master Raz&lt;/a&gt;'s Magic also ignore Shield."}

Health is positively affected from Healing Items and perks, and negatively affected from damaging items, such taking damage from &lt;a href=\"Monsters\"&gt;Monsters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wildlife%20%28Save%20the%20World%29\"&gt;Wildlife&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt;. \nHealth.\nHealth is the term used to refer to the Green bar attributed to the commander. Health determines whether a player can be eliminated / knocked, as when it reaches 0, the commander will be knocked. Health is usually taken away from the commander after their Shield level reaches 0. Only fall damage deal direct health damage. If the commander's health is less than 30% of maximum, it will regenerate to 30% of maximum. \nMonster Health.\nThe health bar of each Husk Monster appears above the monster alongside their power level. Monsters with shield is displayed as a purple bar while monsters with health is displayed as an orange bar. \nShield.\nShield is the term used to refer to the Blue health bar attributed to the commander. Shield is used to protect the commander's health value, and to increase the commander's health in general and to absorb more damage before being knocked. Shield will always be taken away first unless Fall Damage bypasses this rule. If the commander reaches 0 Health but still has shield, they will retain the shield when knocked, but only once revived. When knocked, the player will not have shield protection. Shield automatically regenerates to full after taking no damage for a certain amount of time. This regeneration can be boosted by placing 2 &lt;a href=\"BluGlo\"&gt;BluGlo&lt;/a&gt; into a shield pylon.\nIf the Blast From The Past &lt;a href=\"Team%20Perks\"&gt;team perk&lt;/a&gt; is enabled in a hero loadout, Shield is disabled.\nEnergy.\nEnergy is the term to refer to the Orange bar attributed to the commander. Energy is used when performing Hero &lt;a href=\"abilities\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt; and special attacks with &lt;a href=\"Melee_Weapons_%28Save_The_World%29\"&gt;Melee Weapons&lt;/a&gt;. Energy can also be drained as a result of taking damage from Nature element Monsters and standing near &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20Rift\"&gt;Alpha Rift&lt;/a&gt;s. Energy regenerates when less than full. \nDown but not out (Knocked).\nDown but not out is the term used to refer to commander who have had all of their health removed. When a commander is knocked, they will not perform any actions for 10 seconds except move slowly. They also drop all their BluGlo when knocked. After 10 seconds the player has the option to self-revive on the spot or respawn to their starting location (though respawn is automatically selected after 35 seconds). Teammates can revive a knocked player. If the player falls off the map, the player is fully eliminated and does not cause a downed state (the only option is to respawn).\nReviving.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Stonewood\"&gt;Stonewood&lt;/a&gt;, players can self-revive 5 times per mission, but once the player reaches &lt;a href=\"Plankerton\"&gt;Plankerton&lt;/a&gt;, it is reduced to 3 revives. &lt;a href=\"Canny%20Valley\"&gt;Canny Valley&lt;/a&gt; has 2 and &lt;a href=\"Twine%20Peaks\"&gt;Twine Peaks&lt;/a&gt; only has 1 self-revive per mission. There is no self-reviving when fighting the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20King\"&gt;Storm King&lt;/a&gt;, it is a Defeat if all players are knocked down.\nIn Venture zones, the number of self-revives is dependent on the mission zone level. \nDealing Damage.\nWhen dealing damage to Husks, Wildlife, or environmental props, the damage points are displayed. The tags can be different styles depending on the &lt;a href=\"Elements\"&gt;Elements&lt;/a&gt;. These tags also appear when the player takes damage. If a player takes damage, any current interactions with an object (such as opening a chest) are cancelled. \nIncreasing HP.\nHP (Hit Points) can be increased in various ways, both Health and Shield.\nIncreasing Maximum HP.\nMaximum HP and Shield can be increased by leveling up &lt;a href=\"Heroes\"&gt;Heroes&lt;/a&gt;, increasing the &lt;a href=\"F.O.R.T.\"&gt;Fortitude&lt;/a&gt; (Health) and Resistance (Shield) stat (accomplished through the &lt;a href=\"Research%20Points\"&gt;Research Lab&lt;/a&gt; or leveling &lt;a href=\"Survivor\"&gt;Survivors&lt;/a&gt;), or adding Support Heroes to the Hero Loadout and leveling them up. \nThe Blast From The Past team perk will double the maximum Health at a cost of disabling Shield, but still results in a net gain in maximum effective HP. \nAdditional, placing 2 BluGlo onto a Health pylon temporary increases maximum Health for the duration of the mission."}

{"id": "17627", "revid": "49555758", "url": "https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki?curid=17627", "title": "Hero Mansion", "text": "The Hero Mansion was a building on the map, and is one of the &lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20Locations%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;unnamed locations&lt;/a&gt; in the game. \nThe building was introduced in the &lt;a href=\"Update%20v4.00\"&gt;v4.00 Update&lt;/a&gt; on May 1st. The mansion is located on the east side of the map, in the south of &lt;a href=\"Lonely%20Lodge\"&gt;Lonely Lodge&lt;/a&gt;, in map grids J5 and J6. There is a secret lair under the mansion. The mansion is presumably owned by a superhero; evidence of this is that there is a mask and a blueprint for a full superhero costume in the sewing room within the lair. This would also contrast with the &lt;a href=\"Villain%20Lair\"&gt;Villain Lair&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Snobby%20Shores\"&gt;Snobby Shores&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nFirst Floor.\nThe mansion has five floors: the lower basement, the higher basement, the first floor, the second floor and the third floor. The main entrance of the mansion is on the west side of the building. The first room in the mansion is the hall on the first floor. The hall has a wall in the middle with a painting on it. The hall has four doors: the main entrance on the west side, a door that leads to the kitchen on the south side, a door that leads to the garage on the east side and a door that leads to the laundry room on the north side. There are two staircases on the right and left side of the hall. Both staircases have a secret entrance to the basement, where the secret lair is under them. The left staircase's secret entrance is opened but the right entrance is closed. The laundry room to the north of the hall has a back entrance and so does the kitchen on the south side of the hall. The garage has three garage doors and has room for three &lt;a href=\"cars\"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt;.\nBasement.\nIn the basement is a secret lair. In the center of the lair is a strange table which function is unknown. Notably, there is a similar-looking table in the &lt;a href=\"Villain%20Lair\"&gt;Evil Lair&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Snobby%20Shores\"&gt;Snobby Shores&lt;/a&gt;. On the east side of the lair are two large control panels on the sides, with stairs in the center that lead to a hangar. This empty hangar has a large opening on the west side that leads outside. On the west side of the lair is an unknown logo that can also be seen in the attic. This logo is also a &lt;a href=\"Banner%20Icons\"&gt;banner icon&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pass\"&gt;Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt;. To the left side of this logo is a glass door that leads to a room with a chalkboard, a kitchen and a sewing setup. The entire room has windows that allow you to see into the main hall of the lair. To the right of the logo is a storage room with shelves, a computer and servers. On the north side of the main hall of the lair is another room with windows with an entrance on the east side. In this rooms are lockers and a bench. There is also a room with showers connected to this room. The staircases that lead back upstairs are on the north and south side of the main hall of the lair.\nSecond Floor.\nBoth staircases lead to the main hall of the second floor. This hall has an opening in the floor which allows you to see the first floor. In this hall are five doors. The two on the west both have bedrooms behind them. The two doors on the side of the east wall both lead to more bedrooms and the middle one leads to a bathroom.\nAttic.\nThe two staircases both end at either side of the attic. In the attic the logo that could have been seen in the basement can also be seen on the west wall. In this room is a weightlifting bench, a treadmill, shelves with dumbbells and a punching bag. There is a door on the eats side of the attic which leads to the balcony."}

They allow the player to disguise as a prop, and remain undetected by opponents.\nFunctionality.\nHideouts are a variety of special props which can be interacted with by the player, in order to allow them to hide inside them. When interacted with, the player will enter the prop, and remain hidden until they exit, or the prop is destroyed. When the player is inside a prop, every few seconds, the prop will shake, in order to allow opponents to identify which props have a player hiding inside them. When the player's hideout is destroyed, a short animation will play, in which the player cannot use any items or build, until it finishes.\nPort-a-Potties are unique in that some will teleport the player to another Port-a-Potty in the general vicinity, rather than allowing them to hideout. The player can then renter the one they emerged from to teleport back to the location they came from. This mechanic will show a short cutscene before the player arrives in the new location.\nSnowballs can be created by striking the floor in a Snowy area with your &lt;a href=\"Harvesting%20Tool%20%28Weapon%29\"&gt;Harvesting Tool&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually the snow pile will grow large enough that it becomes a Snowball, which rolls downhill and destroys structures. Players can hide in a Snowball to be protected from damage, but cannot control the ball whilst it moves. Snowballs can also eliminate players.\nProps.\nPlayers can currently only hide in four different prop types, with one having two versions:"}

The weapon does damage in different intervals and does not have a consistent damage per second. When using it, the player will swing twice for 40 damage each, do a spin attack for 20 damage three times, and then overhead slam for 150 damage.\nDarth Vader's Lightsaber will also block damage. Holding the aim down sight button will negate all types of damage except explosive towards the player. This will negate roughly 30 shots, before being put on a three second cooldown.

The war culminated in &lt;a href=\"Nightshift%20Forest\"&gt;Nightshift Forest&lt;/a&gt; at a site known as &lt;a href=\"Battle%27s%20End\"&gt;Battle's End&lt;/a&gt;, where the Demons were defeated, the Masks of Power were shattered, and magic was banished from the Island as a protective measure. In the aftermath, the people of &lt;a href=\"Oninoshima\"&gt;Oninoshima&lt;/a&gt; united to seal the Demons' portals, cutting off access to the Spirit Realm entirely. The &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Clan\"&gt;Fox Clan&lt;/a&gt; was blamed for the incident, as the masks had been crafted by their suppliers.\nWithin the Spirit Realm, &lt;a href=\"The%20Night%20Rose\"&gt;The Night Rose&lt;/a&gt; became a puppet to a massive Oni Mask, forcefully bound - and now wishes for revenge.\nA shard of &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; arrives onto &lt;a href=\"Oninoshima\"&gt;Oninoshima&lt;/a&gt;, alongside strangers from the island of &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of the shard's landing, magic has re-emerged, and the abandoned portals are reopened for the demons of old to return across Oninoshima - including &lt;a href=\"Shogun%20X\"&gt;Shogun X&lt;/a&gt;, the Demon Warriors' leader. Together, they threaten the Island dwellers, but in the process, gain resistance from &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vengeance%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt;, whom have teamed up with the &lt;a href=\"High%20Stakes%20Club\"&gt;High Stakes Club&lt;/a&gt;, alongside the reluctantly reunited forces of the &lt;a href=\"River%20Guard\"&gt;River Guard&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Clan\"&gt;Fox Clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nNow that the &lt;a href=\"Zero%20Point\"&gt;Zero Point Shard&lt;/a&gt; has restored the magic of Oninoshima, the Shattering War begins to repeat itself - with &lt;a href=\"Daigo\"&gt;Daigo&lt;/a&gt; determined to continue work on the magical masks of old through dark magic and his ownership of The Thousand Faces, which was handed down to him by his grandfather, to harness the power needed to enter the Demon Warriors' &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Realm\"&gt;Spirit Realm&lt;/a&gt; for himself. \nLater, &lt;a href=\"Kendo\"&gt;Kendo&lt;/a&gt;, one of &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;'s new associates, enlists the help of &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the resurgence of demons on the Island. The Looper agrees and begins hunting the Demon Warriors. \nThey are soon contacted by Kendo's sister: &lt;a href=\"Jade\"&gt;Jade&lt;/a&gt;, who is also working with &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;. The latter seeks to learn more about the Island's magic. After helping her place Spirit Charms across the Island, The Looper collects demon essence to study their nature and delivers it to Hope. Hope reveals she is searching for an artifact akin to &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt;, stating she wasn't surprised by the island's current situation - suspecting it to be connected with the reawakening of Oninoshima's myths and ancient magic, as well as the demons. \nLater, The Looper travels to &lt;a href=\"Battle%27s%20End\"&gt;Battle's End&lt;/a&gt; alone to investigate the return of magic. Sensing ancient magical resonance, they deduce it is connected to the demons, their rage, and the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Realm\"&gt;Spirit Realm&lt;/a&gt;. They conclude that something ancient and powerful is stirring the Island's magic. \nSometime after, Kendo calls upon The Looper once more - reporting that Jade is missing. He suspects their older brother: &lt;a href=\"Daigo\"&gt;Daigo&lt;/a&gt;, is involved as Daigo has been experimenting with dark magic. Kendo claims to have seen Jade through a portal but dismissed it as a hallucination. However, when The Looper looks through the portal, they also see her - and hear her mention &lt;a href=\"Zero%20Point\"&gt;a shard&lt;/a&gt;. \nKendo sends The Looper to investigate Daigo's shop: \"The Thousand Faces\", where they discover an underground hideout. Inside, they find various masks imbued with traces of dark magic, a painting of Daigo giving a mask to Jade, and a machine pulsing with dark energy. They notably examine a &lt;a href=\"Sprites\"&gt;Sprite&lt;/a&gt; cage, a worrying sight to The Looper, as well as a broken &lt;a href=\"Masks%20of%20Power\"&gt;Mask of Power&lt;/a&gt; from long ago - though Kendo warns The Looper that the mask should never be repaired, for both of them view the masks as dangerous - thus Kendo stays away from using them, similarly to &lt;a href=\"Mizuki\"&gt;Mizuki&lt;/a&gt;. \nUpon confronting Daigo, The Looper learns that Jade had actually been cursed by the demons, and that Daigo created a mask to protect her. However, the mask amplified her powers, trapping her in the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Realm\"&gt;Spirit Realm&lt;/a&gt;. Despite his regrets, Daigo insists he made the mask to keep her safe. Upon gathering all the information they could, The Looper reports their findings back to Kendo."}

{"id": "9746", "revid": "52769013", "url": "https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9746", "title": "Food Fight", "text": "Food Fight is a &lt;a href=\"Limited%20Time%20Modes\"&gt;Limited Time Mode&lt;/a&gt; in . It was introduced in Update v6.30.\nLTM Rules and Gameplay.\nIn this LTM, two teams of 50 are assigned an object to protect - A Tomato, similar to &lt;a href=\"Tomatohead\"&gt;Tomatohead&lt;/a&gt;'s face, or a &lt;a href=\"Durr%20Burger\"&gt;Durr Burger&lt;/a&gt;. These objects will spawn on platforms, that each team has to fortify. The objective of the game is to destroy the opposing team's object.\nStrategy.\nIn this LTM, a good strategy is to use a &lt;a href=\"Submachine%20Guns\"&gt;Submachine Gun&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the opposing team's object. This is because it will take away the prop's health quickly. Additionally, &lt;a href=\"Mounted%20Turret\"&gt;Mounted Turret&lt;/a&gt;s are a good weapon to use in this LTM.\nLore.\nThe Food Fight was the battle between &lt;a href=\"Tomatohead\"&gt;Tomatohead&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Pete%27s%20Pizza%20Pit\"&gt;Uncle Pete's Pizza Pit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beef%20Boss\"&gt;Beef Boss&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Durrr%20Burger\"&gt;Durrr Burger&lt;/a&gt; as they rivaled against each other throughout the history of the Island. The Food Fight began with the creation of both companies, and the locations they were originally at. &lt;a href=\"Tomato%20Town\"&gt;Tomato Town&lt;/a&gt; was the home of Uncle Pete's Pizza Pit. &lt;a href=\"Greasy%20Grove\"&gt;Greasy Grove&lt;/a&gt; was the home for Durrr Burger. However, they were not full rivals at the time, they did have small conflict with each other.\nAfter The Blast-Off Event, Rifts started to appear around the map, eventually taking both the spinning Pizza Pit head, and the iconic Durrr Burger head. Ever since then, both original locations have suffered many changes. Tomato Town changed into Tomato Temple, causing the original Pizza Pit to nearly vanish. Not long after, Durrr Burger was forced to shut down the original building due to health issues. Shortly after the Durrr Burger building shut down, two small trucks appeared in Greasy Grove, one belonging to Pizza Pit and the other Durrr Burger. Thus, the battle continued on as both food trucks raced each other around the island. The Food Fight continued greater, and was worthy to receive a Food Fight LTM, and even a sequel to it, Food Fight: Deep Fried, to represent the battle between the companies.\nAfter traveling around a large fraction of the island, both companies decided to settle in Retail Row, building slightly small replicas of their old buildings. After both buildings were complete, both groups stopped the constant fighting and focused on their own companies than the status of their rival company. However, shortly after the settlement of the companies, a Volcano erupted during The Unvaulting Event, destroying the eastern part of Retail Row, including both the of the new buildings."}

In this gamemode, players can customize server settings, place prebuilt structures from Battle Royale, galleries (collections of assets from different Battle Royale structures), devices (traps, timers, vehicles, etc.), and items and weapons from other game modes, some of which are vaulted.\nLEGO\u00ae Fortnite Odyssey is a survival sandbox in which your objective is to explore a vast procedurally generated landscape, collect resources, craft items, battle enemies and recruit villagers to ultimately make your own village filled with Fortnite . Players have the option of doing this by themselves or with up to seven friends.\nThe game consists of two different modes: Survival, where players have to work to survive, gather resources and defend themselves; and Sandbox, where players receive infinite resources and have the ability to fly.\nLEGO\u00ae Fortnite Brick Life is an open-world social game. In the city of , players can control their Fortnite to hang out with other players - while also being able to work jobs, earn credits, and drive around in various vehicles- among other activities.\n&lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Racing\"&gt;Rocket Racing&lt;/a&gt;.\nRocket Racing is an arcade racer in which up to 12 players race against each other in rocket-powered cars on a variety of tracks filled with various obstacles and shortcuts.

The first concept of \"Fortnite\" was during a Game Jam and would be a horror survival game. Fortnite, at the time was described as \"a world where you explore, you scavenge, you build and ultimately you survive.\"\nDue to several issues and delays with development, Epic Games director Rod Fergusson was considering cancelling Fortnite. Fergusson left Epic Games in 2012 and development continued on Fortnite.\nWhen development began, Fortnite was being built on the Unreal Engine 3 as it would transition to UE4 when Early Access began. In late 2014, the first round of Save the World's Alpha began which were known as &lt;a href=\"Online%20Tests\"&gt;online tests&lt;/a&gt;. These tests, whilst given out via invite emails, were under a non-disclosure-agreement (NDA) meaning very few videos, and images exist of these online tests although livestreams of online tests 2-11 were shown by Epic Games. A video released from around the online test era showcased gameplay from around that time As of 2023, only Online Test 6.5 and parts of Online Test 10.1 have been found.\nAs development progressed, more heroes and features were added. The conceptual idea of gathering resources in the environment and building a fort to combat the husk pathing remained the same, with new weapons and tools to help players combat the &lt;a href=\"Monsters\"&gt;husks&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn July 21th, 2017, Fortnite released in \"Head Start Access\" only to players who had previously pre-ordered a &lt;a href=\"Founder%27s%20Pack\"&gt;Founder's Pack&lt;/a&gt; or received one from an invite through a friend. The game later released on July 25th, 2017 as an Early Access game to players that didn't pre-order. A Campaign was added to the game and it got a major UI overhaul for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The idea of lootboxes were added as &lt;a href=\"Llama%20Pinatas\"&gt;Llama Pi\u00f1atas&lt;/a&gt; could give random resources. More missions were added and expanded on as well, as Epic continued to experiment and add new ideas such as Weapon Perks and the Hero Loadout Update in &lt;a href=\"Season%208\"&gt;Season 8&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the release of Fortnite , a side project started for a separate mode. On September 12th, 2017, Fortnite: Battle Royale was released for public testing to players who had purchased a Founder's Pack for Save the World. On September 26th, 2017 Battle Royale was released as a free-to-play game, and the first official season started on October 25, 2017. The release of Battle Royale was a critical success and Fortnite went on to be one the most popular video games, with development of the original game mode Save the World eventually slowing down due to the decrease in popularity opposed to the other mode."}

The tournament usually starts near the end of each season and is open to players ranked Champion League in Arena. Each region have a separate FNCS and is region locked. The FNCS offers the largest prize money of all online tournaments. In some seasons, there are side FNCS events which are also played with a large prizing, but have a different format than the main FNCS events.\nRules.\nThe FNCS follow the same ruleset as &lt;a href=\"Arena\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt; playlists.\nFormat.\nThe current FNCS format is in the Duos game mode. \nQualification.\nThe qualification format varies each season, but players typically go though rounds of qualifications for each qualifying session. There have been as little as 2 and as many as 4 qualifying sessions for FNCS. The top teams in the final round of qualifiers immediately advance to grand finals. Players that failed to qualify but earn enough series points (based on their session rankings) go through semi-finals for another chance of qualifying to grand finals. If a team fails to qualify by placing high enough, then that team goes through Surge Week where a &lt;a href=\"Victory%20Royale\"&gt;Victory Royale&lt;/a&gt; or being placed high enough is needed to qualify to the grand finals.\nGrand Finals.\nIn the grand finals (shortened by the community as \"Grands\"), the top 50 duos from each region play 12 games in a period of 2 days (6 games each day) for a chance to become the season's FNCS champions.

This entire article is taken from this &lt;a href=\"https%3A//lostmediawiki.com/Fortnite_%28partially_found_unreleased/lost_builds_of_the_massively_multiplayer_online_game%3B_2011-present%29\"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.\n2011-2012 (Pre-Alpha).\n\"See also: &lt;a href=\"Project%20Fortress\"&gt;Project Fortress&lt;/a&gt;\"\nIn 2011-2012, the idea of Fortnite was conceptualized. The game started out as \"fortress game \" The build was created during the early months of its creation, meaning screenshots and videos were never released to the public. This build was originally created in &lt;a href=\"Unreal%20Engine\"&gt;Unreal Engine 3&lt;/a&gt; and has not leaked, meaning this version is lost media. \nYou can see two different videos of this build (one longer one shorter) &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DcQbY7cslwXw\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DdPB-41-ceWY\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nHere is some information about this version of the game:\nLimbo.\nThe design document states that periodically, non-player-created buildings in the world would be enveloped in a mist creature storm. When this happens, all players in the building are killed, and when the storm finally passes, the building will be replaced with a brand new building (thus keeping a steady stream of new loot opportunities introduced into the map)\nHowever, if the players place their power generator in the building before it's consumed by the storm, then all the players inside the building instead get transported to Limbo, the mist creature's home world.\nBecause it's night time when this happens, Limbo is mostly empty of monster creatures so the players can explore and mine unique resources from Limbo. There is a giant obelisk at the center of Limbo which is the gateway between their world and our world. The player's ultimate goal in the game is to destroy or \"plug up\" the obelisk.\nPlayers are eventually pulled out of Limbo and kicked back into the real world. If they happen to be inside another \"sucked into Limbo\" human building, then they ride that building back into the real world and end up in a completely different map in the human world. In this way, Limbo serves as a sort of hub allowing players to transfer between different human world maps.\nOriginal Name.\nIn the \"FortressGame\" build the anonymous user found an early version of the Fortnite VGA trailer from November 2011 (around a month before it was revealed at the VGA's and uploaded to YouTube) You can watch the video of the early version of the trailer &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DoNrRiZ7u5fo\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometime between the \"FortressGame\" build and this build, the name changed from Fortnite into Fornight. There are also multiple graphics in the game called \"Fortnight\".\nThe music used into this build was compiled into a Spotify playlist but that has since been taken down.\nYou can find them on &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/%40FortniteArchive\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; YouTube channel along with lots of other footage.\nDue to the paucity of information on this era, this is the best we could do to try to figure out which build was before or after another.\n2013-2014 (Closed Tests).\nNot much is known about the Closed Tests era, it is only known that it was a transition stage between the original concept of the game (Project Fortress) to what was in the Online Tests, in addition to having some closed tests at certain conferences or private events called \"Storm Chasers\", the guests were able to try for a few hours some demo versions so to speak, those who were able to try were also able to take screenshots and some have been revealed over the years.\n2014 - 2017 (Online Tests).\n\"See also: &lt;a href=\"Online%20Tests\"&gt;Online Tests&lt;/a&gt;\"\nThese versions contain a lot of information since they have leaked.\nThe Online Test versions are the earliest publicly released builds of Fortnite. In order to participate in one, you had to receive an invitation or redeem a code, however either way they were completely free.\nThe players who participated in these versions received &lt;a href=\"https%3A//fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Banner_Icons%23Alpha_Test_Banners\"&gt;exclusive banners&lt;/a&gt; within the game. In addition, many players have confirmed that they had direct contact with the developers to give them feedback.\n\"The original Fortnite PvP mode:\".\nIn these versions (Online Tests) there was no \"Battle Royale\" mode, so everything was about the original game mode, which was later renamed to \"Save the World.\" In these versions, a PvP mode was being developed, and some tests were done with players, the name of this mode is \"Weather The Storm\".\nCurrently, only OT6.5 has been fully found, along with a portion of OT10, included in the files for OT6.5.\n\"The difficulty of finding an Online Test:\".\nThe vast majority of users who played in the Online Tests have not saved images, videos or files of the versions due to an at the time (now ended) NDA, making it very difficult to find someone who still has Online Test files. People have tried to contact users with the role \"Alpha Explorers\" on the official Fortnite Discord server, but all those contacted have already said that they no longer have any files of any Online Test.\nThere is little knowledge of these versions and little information on the internet, as players were required to sign an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) to participate in the Online Tests.\nTo find an Online Test the best way to do it would be to spread the word that these versions are lost, so we will attract more people interested in contributing to the search or find some old alpha player who has not been contacted yet.\nOnline Tests era builds:.\nThere are way too many builds to list here. You can find them &lt;a href=\"https%3A//lostmediawiki.com/Fortnite_%28partially_found_unreleased/lost_builds_of_the_massively_multiplayer_online_game%3B_2011-present%29%23%26amp%3B%23x5B%3BAlpha%26amp%3B%23x5D%3B_2014-2017%7COnline_Test_era%3A\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on LMW.\nIn case you want to see the websites of the alpha era of the game but Wayback Machine is taking a long time to load, you can see them in this Google Drive that includes the release notes of the Online Tests and important websites, including the Online Test 11 release notes! (These were not saved in the Wayback Machine but we were able to recreate the release notes!):\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hB996hS6A4GLXUYzTmz9XM3_S0woNE29\"&gt;Fortnite Alpha Drive&lt;/a&gt;\n\"The Online Test 11.0.3.1\".\nSome time ago we found files related to the Online Tests era of the game on the physical discs sold in 2017 (Mostly they are from PS4 and Xbox One but there are some from Windows), we managed to obtain the discs from the three mentioned platforms but we did not we know which version they are (we only know that they are the same version on all three platforms) and since the creation date of the files is \"06/07/2017\" (dd/mm/yyyy) we assume that they are from Online Test 11.0.3.1, the duration of this Online Test was from 02/06/2017 (dd/mm/yyyy) to 22/06/2017 (dd/mm/yyyy). We have put the version as \"probably found\" since we are not 100% sure. The files from the Windows version (found on a very hard-to-find PC physical version which seems to only be sold in EU countries and more specifically Germany) are compressed and can't seem to be decompressed. We managed to get a decent amount of it decompressed but it was simply too much data to bruteforce.\n2017 (Early Access).\nThis era is somewhat short and mostly with bug fixes from the game, the duration time is short since \"Battle Royale\" began to become popular which made the team slow down on Save the World-related updates.\nPost Release era builds.\nhttps://lostmediawiki.com/Fortnite_(partially_found_unreleased/lost_builds_of_the_massively_multiplayer_online_game;_2011-present)\n2017-2019 (Post ).\nStart of Battle Royale mode era, most builds from this era are saved and all builds after Chapter 1 are saved.\n(CU= Content Update, general bug fixes means for both modes).\nPost Battle Royale era builds.\nhttps://lostmediawiki.com/Fortnite_(partially_found_unreleased/lost_builds_of_the_massively_multiplayer_online_game;_2011-present)"}

It consists of three playlists: the Main Stage, the Battle Stage, and the Jam Stage.\nMain Stage.\nOn the Main Stage, play &lt;a href=\"Jam%20Tracks\"&gt;Jam Tracks&lt;/a&gt; from either the rotating selection or your own collection. Compete against friends for the best performance or team up to climb the leaderboards.\nUpon joining the Main Stage, you will find yourself Backstage. In the Backstage you will find a &lt;a href=\"Rift\"&gt;Rift&lt;/a&gt; in the back, an &lt;a href=\"NPCs\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; which can calibrate your latency, and a terminal in the center. Interacting with the terminal will open a menu where you can choose any featured, new, default, or owned &lt;a href=\"Jam%20Tracks\"&gt;Jam Tracks&lt;/a&gt;. Each person in the lobby can pick 1-4 Jam Tracks, depending on the amount of players. You may also select your difficulty and instrument backstage. The terminal has a screen that will show the selected playlist and the amount of notes those tracks will have with your selected instrument. Once you are ready to start, you can ready up, and you will be rifted onstage.\nFor players using specialized guitar controllers from \"Guitar Hero\" and \"Rock Band\", they can select the \"Pro Lead\" or \"Pro Bass\" instrument options which will feature layouts designed to take advantage of the controllers' capabilities and emulate the gameplay of the aforementioned titles. \n&lt;a href=\"Auras\"&gt;Auras&lt;/a&gt; will glow around you when you are on a note streak on the Main Stage.\nEach note you play will contribute to your personal score and shared band score. The closer you are to the timing of a note, the more score you will get from that note. Doing better on a song will grant up to 5 stars, with golden stars being given out to those on expert difficulty. There are two types of stars during each track: personal stars and band stars. Personal Stars are given based on your performance. Band Stars are given out based on the performance of everybody onstage.\nYou will fill your overdrive meter by playing strings of glowing notes without missing any. Each string you complete will fill your overdrive meter 1/4 of the way. Using overdrive will double your personal score multiplier, and add a 2x multiplier to band score for each person using overdrive at once. Overdrive will last a short duration after being used. Overdrive can be lengthened by playing strings of glowing notes while being active.\nSustain notes are special notes that need to be held to receive the full point value. Releasing the note early will not count as a miss, but pressing the button again will enact a strike.\nLift notes are special notes that can be played by either pressing the button or lifting the button. The lift action acts as a normal note in terms of scoring.\nIf Pro Lead or Pro Bass is selected, lift notes are replaced with \"hammer-on\" and \"pull-off\" (HOPO) notes. Whereas regular notes require strumming to be played, HOPOs only require the lane to be tapped as long as there's a note streak active. If there is none, HOPOs can be strummed to start a note streak. In addition, the whammy bar can be used on sustain notes to alter its pitch, although it has no effect on scoring.\nMissing or misplaying notes will not deduct score, but you will not receive any score for it. A misplayed note is known as a strike. Missing or striking will reset your personal score multiplier and/or cancel any current overdrive string.\nAfter playing a song, you can see your and your band's scoring. If there is another song, you will be able to change your difficulty and instrument. If there is not another song, you will be shown your challenges and your current amount of &lt;a href=\"Season%20XP\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle Stage.\nOn the Battle Stage, 16 players will perform a playlist of four randomly-selected &lt;a href=\"Jam%20Tracks\"&gt;Jam Tracks&lt;/a&gt; in a battle to attain the highest score. Remain on top to avoid elimination at the end of each song.\nUpon joining, you and 15 other players will spawn Backstage, where they will find a &lt;a href=\"Rift\"&gt;Rift&lt;/a&gt; in the back and an &lt;a href=\"NPCs\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; which can calibrate audio and input latency. Players won't be allowed to use the terminal in the center to select songs; rather, the game will randomly select four songs from the daily rotation to create a set list for the players to perform. Players are prompted to choose their instrument and difficulty setting, having a short amount of time to do so before they are rifted onstage.In addition to doubling your personal scoring multiplier, activating Overdrive will also launch an attack at a randomly-selected opponent, typically the player in front of you. These attacks partially obscure the note chart on their screen temporarily, and their personal scoring meter will be reduced during this time. If you are in first place, Overdrive will not launch attacks at other players. You can also be affected by an Overdrive attack if an opponent launches one at you.If you are among the four lowest-scoring players after a song concludes, you will be eliminated from the game. At the end of the final song, you must be the top scorer over your opponents to secure a &lt;a href=\"Victory%20Royale\"&gt;Victory Royale&lt;/a&gt;.\nJam Stage.\nOn the Jam Stage, up to 4 people can band together and create a mix of songs. In your emote wheel, you will find a \"Jam Tracks\" category. In there, you will find your equipped Jam Tracks. You can choose which instrument to play in the emote wheel. Once in a \"Jam,\" you can adjust the key, tempo, and if the jam is in major or minor. You can Emote while jamming; Emotes that are Beat Synced will automatically adjust their speed to the tempo of the jam. The Jam Stage is intended to mash multiple songs together to make a new song.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nTrailers.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nReferences.\n[[Category:Game Modes]]\n[[Category:Fortnite Festival]]\n[[Category:Fortnite]]"}

Using the same rules and conditions from , players must drop onto an island and fight to be the last one surviving in &lt;a href=\"Solo\"&gt;Solo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duos\"&gt;Duos&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Squads\"&gt;Squads&lt;/a&gt;. In this mode, &lt;a href=\"Building\"&gt;Building&lt;/a&gt; is enabled, and it supports up to 100 players in a match. A Zero Build version of this mode coexists with the exact same conditions as .\nGameplay.\nUpon loading into a Fortnite OG match, players will spawn on the &lt;a href=\"Spawn%20Island\"&gt;Spawn Island&lt;/a&gt;, a place where they can wait until the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Bus\"&gt;Battle Bus&lt;/a&gt; is ready to fly over the island. Upon entering the Battle Bus, players will have 15 seconds to jump out and skydive to wherever they want on the island. Players start out with 100 health and 0 shield.\nAfter a minute, the Eye of the Storm, a safe zone, will be marked on the Minimap. Players have roughly 3 minutes until &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt; starts closing in. After the storm reaches the eye, another grace period begins and the eye of the storm shrinks. This process is repeated until the match ends. Any player in the storm will be damaged, with the amount of damage growing after each time the storm closes in until it hits 10 DPS (Damage per Second). The storm directly damages your health, ignoring shields. Prolonged presence in the storm causes &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Sickness\"&gt;Storm Sickness&lt;/a&gt;, which will deal more damage to a player's health, preventing long-term exposure to The Storm. There are 9 storm phases in a match.\nEliminating opposing players is achieved by dealing enough damage until their health reaches zero. In Solo, the player is instantly eliminated and removed from the match. In matches with more than one player on a team, such as Duo, Trio, and Squad matches, players will be knocked down after losing all their health, and can crawl on the floor at a reduced speed. Knocked players cannot use items and, if not revived, their Tenacity will deplete, until they are fully eliminated and drop a Reboot Card. Reboot Cards expire after 4 minutes and 30 seconds, and can be collected to reboot fallen allies at Reboot Vans. If all players on a team are eliminated, then that team is fully eliminated from the match. Unless revived or &lt;a href=\"Rebooting\"&gt;Rebooted&lt;/a&gt; , Players eliminated during the match cannot respawn and will have their loot dropped for other players to obtain if they wish. \nAfter landing, players must find loot either on the floor or through &lt;a href=\"containers\"&gt;containers&lt;/a&gt; to obtain weapons, healing items, materials and utility items of various &lt;a href=\"Rarity\"&gt;rarities&lt;/a&gt;. Shield can be obtained from &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Items\"&gt;consumables&lt;/a&gt;. Weapons are used to deal damage to players and come in different types. There are 5 types of rarities of items ( - ).\nIn Fortnite OG, &lt;a href=\"building\"&gt;building&lt;/a&gt; is normally enabled. The &lt;a href=\"Pickaxe%20%28Weapon%29\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; can be used to gather materials that can be used to build structures such as walls, floors, stairs, and roofs. These structures can be edited before and after being placed to include a door, window, railing, etc. Enemy-built structures cannot be edited, so the attacking player must shoot through the structures to attack the enemy. Each player can hold up to 999 of each material, which are Wood, Brick, and Metal. Wood builds are the weakest, but are quick to build and easy to scavenge while Metal is the strongest but takes the longest time to fully build.\nIn OG Zero Build, materials are disabled, but Build Mode remains enabled to allow the player to place traps.\nOnce the last team or player remains, they will receive a &lt;a href=\"Victory%20Royale\"&gt;Victory Royale&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpdates.\nThe Map in Fortnite OG is nearly identical to the map of &lt;a href=\"Season%201\"&gt;Chapter 1: Season 1&lt;/a&gt;, with all named POIs from said season returning.\nNews Tab.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Upgrading took several seconds and was a minigame instead of it happening instantaneously like in later builds. Monsters are present in this build, albeit do not attack as a result of a bug. Later in the video, when the author killed several husks, the 1-UP sound effect from the Super Mario Franchise can be heard. It is unknown if crafting existed in this build. \nFrom the footage we've seen, one of the modes (missions?) in Project Fortress was a survival game taking place over the timespan of a fortnight (hence the game name) where you build a base and your object is to survive, scavenge and defend your base from husks \nThe map is informally known as &lt;a href=\"Limbo\"&gt;Limbo&lt;/a&gt;, based on the \"WELCOME 2 LIMBO\" sign seen at the beginning of the video.
