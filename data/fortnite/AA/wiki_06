It appeared near &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20Palms\"&gt;Paradise Palms&lt;/a&gt;, being created from several lightning strikes from the &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;Sideways Rift&lt;/a&gt;, closing it in the process. The Cube is an object of immense power, as it was capable of destroying objects in its path as it rolled towards &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt;, printing powerful runes which reduced gravity, and generated &lt;a href=\"Cube%20Monsters\"&gt;Cube Monsters&lt;/a&gt; from its fragments.\nThe Cubes are the power sources of &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt;, an evil and malicious faction affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Anomalies\"&gt;The Sideways&lt;/a&gt; with an intention to corrupt and destroy &lt;a href=\"The%20Omniverse\"&gt;realities&lt;/a&gt;. The Cubes are all controlled by &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%20Queen\"&gt;The Cube Queen&lt;/a&gt;. Thousands of dormant cubes are stored in a dedicated room in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Mothership\"&gt;Motherships&lt;/a&gt;, used to power the gigantic alien ships.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%205\"&gt;Season 5&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;Sideways Rift&lt;/a&gt; continued to rapidly close up, it suddenly turned purple. Within the next few days, purple &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;storm&lt;/a&gt; lightning bolts began shooting out of the crack, all targeting a hill near &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20Palms\"&gt;Paradise Palms&lt;/a&gt;, containing a large stone rock surrounded by a ring of cacti. Each lightning strike picked off one cacti one-by-one, until a larger lightning bolt destroyed the large rock. The &lt;a href=\"Crack%20Closure\"&gt;Crack Closure&lt;/a&gt; event occurred on 24th August 2018, with a gigantic storm lightning bolt striking out of the rift, lasting for around 10 seconds. When it was over, the Crack in the Sky closed. then The Cube was formed. Though it first appeared to be a stationary object, it began to move at a rate of one revolution every 1 hour and 43 minutes. It was unclear where it would end up. During its journey around the map, The Cube printed seven runes with anti-gravity domes surrounding. Throughout the final three weeks of Season 5, the cube continued to print these runes.\nAfter finishing this process, The Cube destroyed one of the buildings in &lt;a href=\"Tilted%20Towers\"&gt;Tilted Towers&lt;/a&gt;. The sporting goods store was hit by a meteorite and was just in the final stages of reopening. The Cube then proceeded to the edge of &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt; on September 19, 2018. The Cube appeared to dissolve, turning Loot Lake in a purple-pink gelatinous state with properties akin to The Cube itself, such as becoming bouncy.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%206\"&gt;Season 6&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the beginning of &lt;a href=\"Season%206\"&gt;Season 6&lt;/a&gt;, it was revealed that The Cube was still intact, as it rose from the waters, taking the cabin and island in the center of the lake with it, forming the &lt;a href=\"Floating%20Island\"&gt;Floating Island&lt;/a&gt;. This created a large hole in the lake exposing the bridge to &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, a vortex in the middle. After just two days of the island rising, The Cube began to move the island to each of the runes it had printed in Season 5. After getting energy from all runes, they dropped to the ground and the island returned to Loot Lake. A portal to &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt; was formed above, which began to expand until it covered the entire island. On October 24, 2018, the first day of &lt;a href=\"Fortnitemares\"&gt;Fortnitemares 2018,&lt;/a&gt; The Cube exploded the floating island into multiple pieces, the Cube still intact. Following the explosion, The Cube fragments that had been growing on the island had been sent all over the map, which released The Cube monsters.\nFrom this day until November 4. The Cube began to crack. On November 3, it began to drip its nectar into &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, until the final drip. On November 4, 2018, The Cube started to spin rapidly, which led to a white flash, and The Cube splitting apart. After the flash, players were teleported to &lt;a href=\"The%20In-Between\"&gt;The In-Between&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after, a rift formed, and took shape of a butterfly, which then multiplied, and came to every player still alive. A cut-scene showed up, where the player put out their finger, and the butterfly would land on the finger, and it got teleported back to the map through a rift. &lt;a href=\"Leaky%20Lake\"&gt;Leaky Lake&lt;/a&gt; appears to be completely new, and the &lt;a href=\"Cube%20Monsters\"&gt;Cube Monsters&lt;/a&gt; were gone.\n=Season X=\nKevin the Cube is a &lt;a href=\"Corruption%20Cubes\"&gt;Corruption Cube&lt;/a&gt; that first appeared in &lt;a href=\"Season%20X\"&gt;Season X&lt;/a&gt;.

Rifted objects believed to have disappeared or changed places such as the Durrr Burger tagged by Drift, the Lonely Lodge sign etc... during World Collide are also on this Island, strongly suggesting that it comes from another timeline where the events, although similar, happened a little differently. In &lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28Chapter%201%29\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt;, the Island blew up but Kevin itself lived and became the power source of &lt;a href=\"Steamy%20Stacks\"&gt;Steamy Stacks&lt;/a&gt;. When it managed to escape, it joined the rest of the Cubes at &lt;a href=\"The%20Convergence\"&gt;The Convergence&lt;/a&gt;. \nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%20X\"&gt;Season X&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Floating%20Island\"&gt;Floating Island&lt;/a&gt; from an alternate timeline came through a &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Beacon\"&gt;Rift Beacon&lt;/a&gt;. it didn't do anything after that except circle the island aimlessly. Later in the season, Cube memorials appeared at &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt; and on the mountain Kevin was created.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"The%20End\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; and the creation of &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;, The Floating Island was destroyed, but The Cube was conserved. Following the reconstruction of the island by &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, it was placed into a dormant state and underneath Building 2 of &lt;a href=\"Steamy%20Stacks\"&gt;Steamy Stacks&lt;/a&gt;, a power station which uses The Cube to generate electricity. The facility is run by &lt;a href=\"Kevolution%20Energy\"&gt;Kevolution Energy&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Update%20v18.21\"&gt;Update v18.21&lt;/a&gt;.\n=Chapter 4: Season OG=\nKevin the Cube is a &lt;a href=\"Corruption%20Cubes\"&gt;Corruption Cube&lt;/a&gt; that first appeared in .

It therefore never placed its runes and its plan was totally different from its Original Timeline Counterpart. Indeed since it was not hostile towards the loopers because it did not have enough energy to attack them, they therefore didn't attacked Kevin which allowed it to survive longer than it should have. This allowed it to extract the Zero Point and absorb its energy. However it completely dissapeared just before &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Bang\"&gt;The Big Bang&lt;/a&gt;, having been allegedly rifted or destroyed off-screen.\nHistory.\nWith the beginning of &lt;a href=\"Season%206\"&gt;Season 6&lt;/a&gt;, The Cube rose from the waters, taking the cabin and island in the center of the lake with it, forming the &lt;a href=\"Floating%20Island\"&gt;Floating Island&lt;/a&gt;. As its runes were never placed, it didn't have enough energy to invade the Island and therefore stayed in the same place, to open the Vault and take out the Zero Point, to steal its energy, and / or destroy it.

Quests linked to a real-money purchase (excluding &lt;a href=\"Omega%20Knight%27s%20Level%20Up%20Quest%20Pack\"&gt;Level Up Quest Packs&lt;/a&gt;) usually do not expire.\nQuests are available for all of the &lt;a href=\"Core%20Gamemodes\"&gt;Core Gamemodes&lt;/a&gt; in Fortnite (excluding , which has its own &lt;a href=\"Quests\"&gt;Quests&lt;/a&gt; system; &lt;a href=\"Legends%20Landing\"&gt;Legends Landing&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=\"Party%20Royale\"&gt;Party Royale&lt;/a&gt;}.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nBattle Royale's quests usually don't offer many cosmetic rewards, as the focus of these quests are providing large amounts of &lt;a href=\"Season%20XP\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt; to assist players with levelling up their &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pass\"&gt;Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests in Battle Royale vary from season to season, meaning that the entire quest system can be overhauled practically overnight. One example of this are Match Quests, which were introduced in and replaced with Daily Quests just 2 seasons later.\nBelow is a list of Quest Types in Battle Royale, followed by a list of Quest Types that have been removed:\nJump to:\n=Active Quest Types=\nDaily Quests.\nDaily Quests are a series of relatively-simple Quests that can only be completed within a 24-hour timeframe. Upon completion, each quest grants the player 1000 XP, and an additional 20,000 XP is given for the first 3 quests that are completed each day. Daily Quests reset at 2pm EST every day. also has its own set of Daily Quests.\nWeekly Quests.\nWeekly Quests are typically more time-consuming and difficult than Daily Quests. Unlike Daily Quests, however, Weekly Quests do not expire until the end of each Season. Weekly Quests are granted each Tuesday (at 2pm EST) for the first 10 weeks of a season, with a bonus set, Week 0, available from the start. Typically, Weekly Quests grant 15,000 XP per quest and a repeatable bonus of 25,000 XP after completing a large number of Weekly Quests.\nMilestones.\nMilestones are a set of very time-consuming quests that are supposed to be completed during regular gameplay over an extended period of time (for example, eliminating 100 players). Each Quest is divided into 20 stages, with each stage getting progressively more difficult each time. Unlike the previous 2 sets of quests, all Milestone quests are available from the start, and until the end, of a Season. Each Milestone Quest provides 5,000 XP upon completion.\nGameplay Quests.\nIntroduced during , Gameplay Quests are Quests that are granted to the player during Gameplay by interacting with certain environmental objects, such as &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20Boards\"&gt;Bounty Boards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"SHADOW%20Briefings\"&gt;SHADOW Briefings&lt;/a&gt;. Gameplay Quests can grant either a small XP reward or a &lt;a href=\"Bars\"&gt;Bar&lt;/a&gt; reward. Gameplay Quests do not carry over between matches, and some are also time-limited within a match.\nStory Quests.\nStory Quests are a series of Quests which add to the &lt;a href=\"Lore%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;Lore&lt;/a&gt; of . These are usually granted in Parts throughout a season, and each part contains a single quest with a series of stages that a player must complete in order to unlock the next part. Each Story Quest grants 15,000 XP upon completion; Story Quests used to grant some cosmetic rewards at the end of each Part.\nRanked Quests.\nRanked Quests are a set of seasonal Quests which require a player to survive Storm Circles in stages with intervals of 10 in &lt;a href=\"Ranked\"&gt;Ranked&lt;/a&gt; in order to unlock some cosmetic rewards. Usually, there are one or two rewards that are obtained from this every season, which display the player's rank in that season.\nKickoff Quests.\nKickoff Quests are granted to each player at the start of each season to introduce players to new mechanics in that respective season. For example, in , the Kickoff Quests taught players the new movement mechanics, such as Sprinting and Mantling. Each Kickoff Quest grants players 15,000 XP.\nSurvivor Medal Quests.\nIntroduced in , Survivor Medal Quests challenge the skill of a player by providing a series of survival goals (eg reaching top 5 with 5 eliminations) with an XP reward of up to 20,000 XP upon completion. Completing 10 Survivor Medal Quests also ranks up your Survivor Medal, which, in turn, unlocks a style for the &lt;a href=\"Prized%20Llama\"&gt;Prized Llama&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Back%20Blings\"&gt;Back Bling&lt;/a&gt; relative to your Survivor Medal's rarity.\nEvent Quests.\nThroughout each Season, Fortnite collaborates with many Third-Party brands, such as Marvel and &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Ball%20Quests\"&gt;Dragon Ball&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes, these collaborations will bring a set of Limited-Time Quests with cosmetic rewards available. Alternatively, some major brands may also bring a &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Blooded\"&gt;Mini-Pass&lt;/a&gt;, which can be levelled up by completing quests. Seasonal events, such as &lt;a href=\"Winterfest\"&gt;Winterfest&lt;/a&gt;, also usually bring a set of quests containing cosmetic rewards or XP.\n=Former Quest Types=\nMatch Quests.\nMatch Quests were a set of quests that were given to a player at the start of a match. On &lt;a href=\"Spawn%20Island\"&gt;Spawn Island&lt;/a&gt;, each player is given a choice between one of 3 Match Quests, with each one falling under 1 of 3 categories: Combat, Exploration, and Variety. Upon selecting a quest and landing from the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Bus\"&gt;Battle Bus&lt;/a&gt;, the player had the remaining duration of the match to complete it. Each Match Quest granted 15,000 XP.\nPunchcards.\nIntroduced in , Punchcards were a type of quest available throughout the whole Chapter. Punchcards were displayed separately to the rest of a player's quests, showing up at the top of the Quest list as a horizontal list. Each Punch Card a series of Milestone-like quests that granted a player XP upon completion. During , Punch Cards were used in place of Daily and Weekly quests.\nCharacter Quests.\nDuring , some &lt;a href=\"Characters%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;Characters&lt;/a&gt; granted Quests to players upon request, with either an XP or &lt;a href=\"Bars\"&gt;Bar&lt;/a&gt; reward upon completion. focussed its entire Quest system on interacting with Characters and Character Quests. Character Quests have since been replaced by &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20Boards\"&gt;Bounty Boards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"SHADOW%20Briefings\"&gt;SHADOW Briefings&lt;/a&gt;.\nRarity-Based Quests.\nFrom to the end of , Quests were given a rarity, similarly to Items in Battle Royale. The rarity of a quest impacted the type of quest it was and the amount of XP the Quest granted:\n=Trivia=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Some weapons also have a scope for even better accuracy. Most weapons have a headshot multiplier, meaning that they deal extra damage when shooting at an enemy's head. Some weapons are burst, which means they fire multiple shots at once. These weapons usually have a lower fire rate, however. Some weapons are hitscan, meaning that the bullet connects when you click the trigger. However, other weapons (such as &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifles%20%28Save%20the%20World%29\"&gt;Sniper Rifles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Explosive%20Weapons%20%28Save%20the%20World%29\"&gt;Launchers&lt;/a&gt;) have a bullet travel time delay.\nEach Ranged Weapon has different statistics, however a general rule is that a higher rarity means a stronger weapon. Other rules include: a lower fire rate means higher damage, and a lower magazine size means a low fire rate.\nWeapon levels are capped based on what stage players are on during the game. The cap starts at Level 10, with Level 50 being the maximum level.

Based on the player's performance, the player will either gain or lose progress in their rank.

This leaderboard will update regularly and display participants\u2019 Epic display name and Unreal position, so you can flex on the competition.\nPlayers can opt out of being displayed on the leaderboard by turning \u201cPublic Game Stats\u201d off in the \u201cGameplay Privacy\u201d section of Fortnite\u2019s in-game Account and Privacy settings.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nHow does ranking up work?\nIn the Lobby, if you have \u201cRanked\u201d set to \u201cOn,\u201d you\u2019ll see your current rank. When the cursor is on the rank emblem on the right side of the screen, players of Champion rank and lower will see a progress bar indicating how far they are from advancing to the next rank or returning to the previous one, while those of Unreal rank will see their leaderboard position among other Unreal ranked players. \nAfter a match, the increase/decrease rate of the progress bar (Champion rank and lower), or your Unreal leaderboard position (Unreal rank), will depend on the following factors:\nTeams will be treated as a single unit \u2014 all team members will gain and lose progress equally based on team eliminations and team placement calculated at the end of a match.\nYour team\u2019s rank will be determined by the highest-ranked player on the team. For example, if a team is made up of Gold I and Silver I players, they\u2019ll matchmake as a Gold I team and play against similarly-ranked teams.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nWhich modes support Ranked?\nRanked mode is present in these gamemodes:\nYou\u2019ll have separate ranks for all game modes. All game modes support Solos, Duos, and Squads. Ballistic supports 5-player squads.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nHow does Ranked matchmaking work?\nIf you\u2019re playing in Solo, you\u2019ll be matched against opponents of the same or similar rank as you. \nIf you\u2019re playing in Duos or Squads, your team will have a \u201cparty rank\u201d, which is equivalent to the rank of the highest-ranked teammate. Your team will be matched against teams with the same or similar party rank. \nPlayers can jump into Ranked matches no matter which matchmaking region they\u2019re using.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nIs there any gameplay differences between Ranked matches and non-Ranked matches?\nTurning on Ranked will put you against other players who have Ranked enabled. You can expect all the loot and other gameplay features that are enabled in traditional Battle Royale and Zero Build to be enabled in Ranked Season Zero as Epic Games continues to monitor and evaluate the Ranked player experience. With this in mind, the following balance changes were made with the release of v24.40:\n&lt;hr&gt;\nCan new Fortnite players play in Ranked matches?\nRanked play is meant for both new and veteran Fortnite players. To make sure new players are warmed up, players with Epic accounts that have never been used to log into Fortnite will have to complete a specific Quest (Outlast 500 opponents) before they can enable the Ranked option.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nAre there in-game rewards for playing in Ranked matches?\nWhen you jump off the Battle Bus in a Ranked match, you\u2019ll be given a Ranked Urgent Quest. By completing Ranked Urgent Quests, you\u2019ll unlock Seasonal cosmetic rewards. A new Ranked Urgent Quest is given every match, and Ranked Urgent Quest progress does not carry over between matches.\nSeasonal cosmetic rewards include Seasonal Rank Items such as the &lt;a href=\"Burn%20Bright\"&gt;Burn Bright&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Emote\"&gt;Emote&lt;/a&gt; from Ranked Season 0, which shows the rank color based on the rank that was earned during that season (Bronze, Silver, Gold, etc.), and the &lt;a href=\"Redmask%20Ranker\"&gt;Redmask Ranker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Back%20Bling\"&gt;Back Bling&lt;/a&gt; from Ranked Season 1, which has multiple selectable styles based on the rank obtained.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nHow did Ranked affect Competitive?\nWith the addition of Ranked, Arena was discontinued in v24.40. This meant that all remaining tournaments for Battle Royale , except for the Console Champions Cup, did not have a rank requirement for eligibility, and players needed to reach Platinum I rank or higher in Ranked Battle Royale to be eligible to compete in the Console Champions Cup that was held on May 23, 2023.\nAs of Chapter 4: Season 3, your rank is, among other factors, an eligibility requirement for Epic-hosted tournaments. This includes tournaments for cosmetic prizes like Icon Series Cups, as well as tournaments for cash prizes such as FNCS competitions. As with all other eligibility requirements, the specific rank requirements for a given tournament will be listed in the official rules for that tournament. \n\"Please note: Epic-hosted tournaments may have different loot and other gameplay features than other matches. Performance will always be the top priority for tournaments.\"\nRules.\nThe Rules for Ranked are the same as core Battle Royale and Zero Build playlists.\nSeasons.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

They have a unique octagonal reticle (reminiscent of a turtle shell). When attacking and targeting an opponent in range, the reticle becomes red, the color of Raphael's headband.\nEach Mythic TMNT weapon has a standard attack (fire) that can be held to string a chain of attacks together. Each hit deals different amounts of damage and thus the weapon does not have a consistent damage per second. They also possess an air dash (aim) that will allow the player to quickly launch themselves into the air a short distance. It can also be used on the ground. This dash also deals damage if it hits an opponent, but has a very small cooldown afterwards. While in the air, the player may use the standard attack to produce an air attack (a ground slam that deals heavy damage and knockback).\nIn addition, simply having this weapon as the active weapon grants the user a passive double jump. Using this gives the player fall damage immunity and a slight boost forward, but it can't be used again until the player touches the ground. This jump uses stamina even if the player isn't sprinting. For this reason, players must manage their stamina carefully, as if they are caught in midair without enough stamina to double jump, they will take fall damage as normal and potentially eliminate themselves.\nThe weapon has three charges that slowly refill over time similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Grapple%20Blade\"&gt;Grapple Blade&lt;/a&gt;. Using an air dash or air attack expends a charge. Each charge takes 10 seconds to refill.\nRaphael's Combo.\nRaphael's standard attack combo consists of a quick double swipe, cross slash, diagonal up-right slash, second cross slash, and finally a two-handed overhead strike with the kunai.\nWeapon ID.\nRaphael's Sai are referred to as Lined Notebook River in the files.\nNews Tab.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Below are some notes on the Creative rarity system:\nSave the World has Six rarities, One of which is unique and contains only one set of special items. Rarity roughly coincides with the item's power.\nOther Notes.\n\"NOTE: With the release of the &lt;a href=\"Update%20v29.20\"&gt;Update v29.20&lt;/a&gt;, all 6 core rarities ( - ) available for &lt;a href=\"Cosmetic%20Items\"&gt;Cosmetic Items&lt;/a&gt; got hidden, although they still exist within the game files.\"\nSince &lt;a href=\"Update%20v29.20\"&gt;Update v29.20&lt;/a&gt;, all standard Cosmetic Rarities for all items in Battle Royale and Save the World have been removed and players can no longer see the Rarity of cosmetics and filter them in the &lt;a href=\"Locker\"&gt;Locker&lt;/a&gt; and Item Shop.\nThis includes the , , , , , and even the rarity, which was only used for the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20%20Pass\"&gt;Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt;. \nHowever, all of the special rarities (Rarity Series) were not affected by this change and can still be seen in cosmetics inside the &lt;a href=\"Locker\"&gt;Locker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Item%20Shop\"&gt;Item Shop&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, several new \"Series\" have been added since.\nCosmetic Rarity is present across all modes, and does not have any bearing on actual gameplay, giving no clear advantage to players who own items of any specific rarity. The only changes between different rarity items are price, and a specific series they belong to. \nSome rarities for cosmetics are labelled as 'Series' rarity. This is because the items have an internal rarity based upon one of the five base rarities, but appear with different labels and backgrounds when actually equipped. For the purpose of categorization, they are rarities.\nCosmetic Rarity follows a vague ruleset, and is consistent with items pricing depending on the Rarity of the item, and its type. Some rarities have far less items than one another, and some can be much more difficult to obtain than others. \nOther Notes.\nSome items in Fortnite are not meant to be seen by the player, and are exclusively seen by developers.

She thought he was insane to think something like the storm would appear, but she trusted him and kept helping him with the project.\nHer name, personality, and her voice were based off of Vinderman's previous lab partner &lt;a href=\"Desiree\"&gt;Desiree&lt;/a&gt;, after Desiree abandoned him thinking he was insane.\nSave the World.\nRay was present at the &lt;a href=\"Stonewood\"&gt;Stonewood&lt;/a&gt; Homebase Outpost, broadcasting a distress call for help (\"If anyone can hear me, I need your help. I'm all alone out here\").\nShe was there with &lt;a href=\"Pop\"&gt;Pop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lok\"&gt;Lok&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20%28Save%20the%20World%29\"&gt;Kevin&lt;/a&gt;. Once the &lt;a href=\"Commander\"&gt;Commander&lt;/a&gt; arrived, she briefly introduced them and requested assistance in helping &lt;a href=\"Ramirez\"&gt;Ramirez&lt;/a&gt; rescue a group of survivors and &lt;a href=\"Onboarding%20Fort\"&gt;launch a rocket&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe instructed Pop to set up a Storm Shield to help &lt;a href=\"Ramirez\"&gt;Ramirez&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Survivor\"&gt;Survivor&lt;/a&gt;s defend against &lt;a href=\"Husk%20Monsters\"&gt;Husks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mist%20Monsters\"&gt;Mist Monsters&lt;/a&gt;. Ray provided the &lt;a href=\"Commander\"&gt;Commander&lt;/a&gt; with resources to build a fort around the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Shield\"&gt;Storm Shield&lt;/a&gt; for protection. Afterward, they obtained the &lt;a href=\"Before%20and%20After%20Science\"&gt;ATLAS blueprint&lt;/a&gt; and constructed multiple devices to combat the storm.\nDuring the second Storm Shield expansion, Ray revealed to the &lt;a href=\"Commander\"&gt;Commander&lt;/a&gt; that the shield essentially functions like a bomb and expressed uncertainty about why it creates a shield instead of a crater.\nThroughout various missions, Ray assists the &lt;a href=\"Commander\"&gt;Commander&lt;/a&gt; by scouting balloon landing sites and tracking the &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;Storm&lt;/a&gt;'s movement during defenses. Ray makes appearances in most &lt;a href=\"Events%20%28Save%20the%20World%29\"&gt;Event Questlines&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality.\nRay is helpful, but her actions often lead to unintended problems, such as when she accidentally broke the &lt;a href=\"Air%20Strike%20%28Save%20the%20World%29\"&gt;Air Strike&lt;/a&gt; device, or sent &lt;a href=\"SEE-Bot\"&gt;SEE-Bot&lt;/a&gt; off into the desert because he was becoming a nuisance at &lt;a href=\"Homebase\"&gt;Homebase&lt;/a&gt;. Her na\u00efvet\u00e9 is apparent, especially during the &lt;a href=\"Spring%20It%20On%21\"&gt;spring questline&lt;/a&gt; where she repeatedly fell for the storm gold trap, driven by a bit of greed at the sight of gold. Safety hazards don't seem to concern her much either, as shown when she got &lt;a href=\"Pop\"&gt;Pop&lt;/a&gt; struck by lightning to wake him up. Ray also tends to take serious situations lightly, like when Pop became evil, and she dismissed it as just an \"evil phase.\"\nOn the flip side, Ray sometimes gets overly serious about things of little importance. For instance, she became convinced that Easter eggs were placed by a \"serial decorator\" and got incredibly hyped when the &lt;a href=\"Heroes\"&gt;Heroes&lt;/a&gt; were launching fireworks.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nDialogue Icons.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nAudio.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

In order to be a referee, a player must have played less than 120 minutes of a core Fortnite Battle Royale game mode (i.e., Solo, Duos, Trios, or Squads) within the past 30 days. \nReferrers and referees can earn points as outlined on the program website, but ways to earn points may include: playing a game of Fortnite together, earning eliminations in Battle Royale, or leveling up your Fortnite account. For clarity, if you participate in the program as a referrer, you will not be able to later participate as a referee (and vice versa).\nBoth referrers and referees need to be friends in-game to participate in this program. Only referrers need to register on the program website, but referees can still register if they would like to check their own progression. \nPoints earned by playing with a referrer/referee will accumulate until specific thresholds are met, at which point, the referrer and/or referee will receive the designated reward for meeting that threshold. For example, by completing the final challenge, which requires referrers and referees to level up their Fortnite accounts by 60 career levels, participants can unlock the Rainbow Racer Outfit! Please note that while referrers can participate with up to 5 different referees, each participant (whether a referrer or a referee) can only earn a reward once. \nFor full program details and eligibility requirements, please visit &lt;a href=\"https%3A//bestfriendzy.fortnite.com/\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.\nRewards.\nInvite friends using the Best Friendzy Program site, gain points, and earn the following rewards."}

It was in this Reality that took place during the whole Chapter 4 except .\nIn this Reality The Loop does not exist. However, it would turn out that Reality Zero had a very short lifespan and was doomed to collapse. Furthermore, unspecified formidable enemies noticed this and would target the Reality, probably to recover the Zero Point. Slone, with the help of Optimus Prime, created a plan to allow the inhabitants to escape.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Bang\"&gt;The Big Bang&lt;/a&gt; created in the past thanks to Slone's plan, Asteria's inhabitants moved to one of the new Galaxies created by &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Bang\"&gt;The Big Bang&lt;/a&gt; which contain &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Helios' Reality&lt;/a&gt;.

This reality was created by &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; at the exact same coordinate than the previous iteration, using the matter absorbed from the previous one to create a new Reality. \nIt was in this Reality that took place during the whole Chapter 2 and Chapter 3. Just like the previous iteration, this Reality was divided between The Loop and the Extra Loop. However &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt; seemed to work only on &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; before the Flipside.\nThe two Island of this Reality were flipped during &lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28Chapter%202%29\"&gt;The End (Chapter 2)&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href=\"The%20Army%20of%20the%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Army of the Last Reality&lt;/a&gt; invaded &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; and almost eliminated everyone on it and made the Island unlivable.\nThis iteration of Reality Zero met its end during &lt;a href=\"Fracture\"&gt;Fracture&lt;/a&gt; in , after The Herald completely chromed &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt; and fused with the &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Tree\"&gt;Reality Tree&lt;/a&gt;, annihilating both &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt; and the whole Reality. The Zero Point then teleported elsewhere in &lt;a href=\"The%20Omniverse\"&gt;The Omniverse&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first iteration of Reality Zero was created by &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; and is said to be the very first reality created during The Big Bang, and thus contains &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;. It was said to be the world where every reality ever came from. It was in this Reality that took place during the whole Chapter 1. This Reality is composed of only one island, &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;, and was divided between The Loop and the Extra Loop. It is supposed that just like the second iteration, the Reality was surrounded by a barrier separating it from the void of the Omniverse.\nThis iteration of Reality Zero met its end during &lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28Chapter%201%29\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Season%20X\"&gt;Season X&lt;/a&gt;, after The Seven managed to contain the Zero Point, but that it unexpectedly became a Black Hole that absorbed the whole Reality following interferences from people outside The Loop that were not calculated.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Zero Point is the heart of all of reality itself and the creator of The Island. It is usually targeted by outsiders, such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer\"&gt;The Devourer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Galactus\"&gt;Galactus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt;, due to its extreme power, which usually results in The Zero Point drastically altering the reality. \n&lt;a href=\"The%20Island\"&gt;The Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Island was the home and creation of &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;. Because of the manipulation of the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt;, The Zero Point attracted many threats to it, putting the Island under danger. Each iteration of Reality Zero had its own Island, which were the only component of Reality Zero.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nAsteria is the Island of the final iteration of Reality Zero. It was created as the only part of Reality Zero thanks to the Zero Fusion process which fused fragments of fractured realities. Unlike the two previous iteration of Reality Zero, this one along with its Island was located at a completely different coordinates and didn't had any borders to separate it from the void of the Omniverse. While those outside the Island will not see any stars, those who are close to the island or on it would see a Sun and a Moon appear with a day-night cycle. \nThe Island of this iteration of Reality Zero consists of two sides which are Artemis and Apollo. Those were created from the pieces of &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; at the exact same coordinate as the later alongside Reality Zero after the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hole%20%28physical%20object%29\"&gt;Black Hole&lt;/a&gt; exploded. Apollo and Artemis as well as their atmosphere were contained within a giant bubble which served as Reality Zero's border. \nA gigantic cavern-like area which is filled with water and connects the two halves of The Island. It also contains The Bridge facility on the Apollo side. The Island is surrounded by a body of water, and it appears that Gravity is reversed when the center of the island is reached, keeping the water from flowing out. As seen in The End event, the Island can be &lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28Chapter%202%29\"&gt;flipped&lt;/a&gt;. Each side have it's own daytime.\nThe Island of the very first Iteration of Reality Zero is Athena, and it is the original form of Reality Zero, the place where every reality ever came from. Little is known about this Island. However it's widely assumed that its functioning is exactly the same as its successors Apollo and Artemis, apart from the separation into two sides. It was reformed into Apollo and Artemis during &lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28Chapter%201%29\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt; event.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nDimensional separation.\nIn its first two iterations, Reality Zero was split into two perfectly identical sub-dimensions by the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;Storm&lt;/a&gt; and advanced technology from The Bridge. One was called The Loop and the other the Extra Loop. Although the environment is the same, and what happens on one side affects the other, people in The Loop cannot interact with those in The Extra Loop and vice versa, even if they are at the exact same location.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Loop erases people memory, mutes them, and forces them to fight, as they forget everything each loop. A Loop ends after 22 minutes with The Storm killing all remaining survivors if there are any and then a next one start, with everyone ressurected and deprived of their memory of the previous Loop. The Loop is constantly monitored by The Imagined Order, either from inside The Bridge or from another Reality, their technology being responsible for controlling all of The Storm's movements, as well as memory loss, which is handled by the PsyOps Division.\nIt is possible to escape the loop by standing alone at the very center of &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt; when no other combatants are left. \nIn , &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; confirmed The Loop could be destroyed, and this is what was possibly done after &lt;a href=\"Collision\"&gt;Collision&lt;/a&gt;. If not, the absence of the Imagined Order and the destruction of The Bridge would still have rendered The Loop completely dysfunctional.\nFrom onwards, The Loop ceased to exist as Reality Zero was destroyed during &lt;a href=\"Fracture\"&gt;Fracture&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Extra Loop.\nThis is the place where Loopers who escaped The Loop are located, completely identical to The Loop. Here &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt; does not exist. \nOnce they are there, this will gives escaped Loopers their voices and memories back, however they will only remember their time in the loop. They are not affected by the fights, and when eliminated, are permanently dead, unlike the trapped &lt;a href=\"Loopers\"&gt;Loopers&lt;/a&gt; who will respawn next round.\nOutside Reality Zero.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ice Moon is the frozen moon of &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20King%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;The Ice King&lt;/a&gt;, it orbited the first two iterations of Reality Zero, before the Second iteration was destroyed by &lt;a href=\"The%20Herald\"&gt;The Herald&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Fracture\"&gt;Fracture&lt;/a&gt; causing the Reality to be recreated elsewhere. It's the place where &lt;a href=\"Polar%20Peak\"&gt;Polar Peak&lt;/a&gt; originated from. It was only accessible to players during the &lt;a href=\"Collision\"&gt;Collision&lt;/a&gt; event in . \nKnown Diverging Timelines.\nThroughout the various chapters, several diverged timelines of Reality Zero, in other words Realities almost identical to Reality Zero up to a certain point in time, were shown to exist and some of their locations appeared in Reality Zero, notably during Reality crises. However, none of these Realities have received an official numbering.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n class=\"fandom-table\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Name &amp; Image\n!Description\nAn alternative version of Reality Zero's first iteration (Athena) that slightly diverged from &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt;, but remain almost identical.\n class=\"fandom-table\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Name &amp; Image\n!Description\n&lt;a href=\"Fortnite%20Remix%27s%20Reality\"&gt;Fortnite Remix's Reality&lt;/a&gt;\nAn alternative version of Reality Zero's second iteration (Apollo) that diverged a lot from &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt;.

This cube has the power to &lt;a href=\"Rebooting\"&gt;Reboot&lt;/a&gt; life and give &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Battle%20Royale%29%23Shield\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt; to them.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28Chapter%202%29\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt; event, it formed a shield around the &lt;a href=\"Guava%20Fort\"&gt;Guava Fort&lt;/a&gt; to protect the the &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;Loopers&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%20Queen\"&gt;The Cube Queen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt; began their assault during the event. However, the shield was eventually destroyed by the onslaught of shots from the waves of &lt;a href=\"Saucer\"&gt;Saucers&lt;/a&gt;. The Cube then fought off several &lt;a href=\"Caretaker\"&gt;Caretakers&lt;/a&gt; that were summoned through a Cube Barricade by The Cube Queen, which was successful. However, the Rebooted Cube met its end at the hands of a &lt;a href=\"Abductors\"&gt;Abductor&lt;/a&gt;, where it was zapped by the beam from the abductor, leading to the Rebooted Cube's destruction. However, the Rebooted Cube's demise was not in vain, as it gave &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt; enough time to save the Loopers, flip the Island and defeat the Cube Queen and her Last Reality army."}

It was introduced in &lt;a href=\"Season%208\"&gt;Season 8&lt;/a&gt;. \nFunctionality.\nWhen a player is &lt;a href=\"Elimination\"&gt;eliminated&lt;/a&gt; in any of the team-based modes (&lt;a href=\"Duos\"&gt;Duos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trios\"&gt;Trios&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Squads\"&gt;Squads&lt;/a&gt; etc.), they will drop a reboot card. A living teammate who collects the card has the possibility to resurrect the eliminated player at a &lt;a href=\"Reboot%20Van%20Spawner\"&gt;Reboot Van&lt;/a&gt;, otherwise the card's timer will expire and the teammate is permanently eliminated. The feature is only available in the aforementioned modes, however, reboot vans appear in &lt;a href=\"Solo\"&gt;Solo&lt;/a&gt; but are unfunctional. The reboot vans do not spawn at all in Team Rumble. In competitive playlists, players eliminated by &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20%28Gamemode%29\"&gt;Storm Surge&lt;/a&gt; will not drop a Reboot Card, and cannot be rebooted as a result.\nTo reboot players, a living teammate must first find and collect their reboot card, then take it to a Reboot Van.\nAfter doing so a reboot van must be located. The player must interact with the van for 10 seconds using the interact button. This process can be expedited with the aid of other living teammates. If they let go of the button before the interaction process is complete, the progress of the reboot will slowly go down until the time has completely restarted. If a player (including enemies) starts a reboot again before the timer has hit zero, the reboot will save the progress and will thus take less time, the amount depends on how close the reboot was to being complete. Players who are rebooted will respawn with a weapon (usually a low tier pistol) and 100 &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon completion, the reboot van will flash its headlights and honk its horn twice, then display a blue beacon above it. The space above the van will create a rift once for every player that needs to be rebooted. After the respawn process completes, the van will be disabled for approx. 1 minute to recharge; chiming when the van is functional again.\nIf all living teammates are eliminated, the reboot cards will automatically expire.\nAn active reboot van can be seen on visual audio from about 100 meters away. However this was changed in Chapter 3 to be 400+ meters away. This was reverted in Chapter 4.\nGear.\nPlayers respawn with:\nQuests.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Earn in-game rewards by completing &lt;a href=\"Refer%20a%20Friend%203.0%20Challenges\"&gt;in-game tasks&lt;/a&gt; with eligible friends you refer to Fortnite. Eligible friends are new or returning players (players who have played less than 2 hours of Fortnite's \"Battle Royale\" or \"Zero Build - Battle Royale\" experiences in the last 30 days.) Learn more below!\nHow to Participate in Refer a Friend 3.0:.\n\"All in-game rewards players can earn in Refer a Friend 3.0.\"\nRegistration, Inviting Friends, and Earning Rewards.\nOnce registered and logged into the Refer a Friend website, \u201creferrers\u201d can invite friends (\u201creferees\u201d) to complete Refer a Friend tasks in Fortnite together. In order to be a referee, a player must have played less than 2 hours of Fortnite's Battle Royale or Zero Build - Battle Royale experiences (whether Solo, Duos, Trios, or Squads) within 30 days before the invite.\nReferrers and referees can earn points, as outlined on the program\u2019s sign-up page, by completing the ordered Refer a Friend tasks. Upon reaching a point threshold, both you and your friend will earn the associated in-game reward! There are five point thresholds and five in-game rewards total.\nBoth referrers and referees need to be friends in-game to participate in this program. Only referrers need to register on the program website, but referees can still register if they would like to check their task progress. If you participate in the program as a referrer, you will not be able to later participate as a referee (and vice versa).\nPlease note that while referrers can participate with up to five different referees, each participant (whether a referrer or a referee) can only earn each Refer a Friend 3.0 reward once. How to participate with more than one referee? You can start over the task track with a different friend to help them get the in-game rewards!\nGive your friends a warm welcome (or a warm welcome back) to Fortnite."}

He is known to be a famous Doomfluencer in MEGA City \nHe is a supporting character in Chapter 4, acting first as a minor antagonist before turning supporting protagonist.\nPersonality.\nRenzo the Destroyer is a proud and arrogant robot who loves to destroy and cause chaos, just like the rest of The Unseen members. He is obsessed with rococo baroque. Renzo is also described by NeuraLynx as someone always giving his all. According to himself and Triarch Nox, he seeks conquest, he wants to take over MEGA City but also \"the light\". Renzo is also very proud of his title of Doomfluencer.\nAppearance.\nRenzo appears as a dark coloured skeletal-looking robot with blue flames on his head. He wears a classy outfit with a damaged blue coat because of his &lt;a href=\"Skull-a-tron\"&gt;Skull-a-tron&lt;/a&gt;.\nTimeline.\nBefore Chapter 4.\nRenzo has been created by an unknown person, and later mentored by Allan the Unmentionable. After that, he became a member of &lt;a href=\"The%20Unseen\"&gt;The Unseen&lt;/a&gt; in MEGA City, described like the rest of them as causing wreck and havoc without caring if innocent people were harmed. He also became a Doomfluencer at an unknown period of time.\nAs MEGA City Syndicates were on the brink of war because of &lt;a href=\"Dahlia\"&gt;Dahlia&lt;/a&gt;, a member of The Unseen who was collaborating with &lt;a href=\"Styx\"&gt;Styx&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Triarch%20Nox\"&gt;Triarch Nox&lt;/a&gt; and secretly &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Army of the Last Reality&lt;/a&gt;. After the Peace Syndicate managed, with the help of The Looper, to unite all the Syndicates and identify the saboteur as a member of The Unseen, Thunder and Evie placed their hopes in The Looper so that Highwire and Renzo the Destroyer would listen to them and stop the scheme of Dahlia that was on-going. Using a &lt;a href=\"P33LY\"&gt;P33LY&lt;/a&gt; disguise created by The Luminaries, The Looper managed to infiltrate The Unseen's territory and managed to talk and convince Renzo and Highwire to put an end to their alliance with The Army of the Last Reality. Understanding that someone has made a move behind their back, they became furious and they put an end to Dahlia's scheme after a \"talk\" before joining the alliance of MEGA City's Syndicates and helping them cut Dahlia's contact with &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt;.\nReferencess.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Vlad was a tyrannical figure in Hexsylvania's past who held political power over the peasants residing in the region. He was known for his cruelty and was accused of vampirism, though this claim is highly disputed.\nLore.\nIt is not certain what time period Vlad lived in. He ruled over populations of peasants in Europe and owned numerous Gothic-style castles, suggesting placement in the Middle Ages, but his statue depictions often portray him wearing a top hat, which was not invented until the late 18th century.\nAccording to a modern Hexsylvanian guidebook, there is only one surviving statue of Vlad in Hexsylvania; all of the statues seen are replicas created by the Storm.\nHe had twelve thrones, each corresponding to a day of the Vladian week. This week included nine Vladsdays in addition to Tuesday, Vlaterday, and Wendsvlad.\nVlad had a tendency to silence his critics. He is said to have burned much of Hexsylvania's historical record after reading an unflattering journal entry. He then tortured the writer along with his family and associates. On another occasion, he invited several villagers to a feast at Castle Moremist after hearing that he was accused of vampirism. No villagers returned.\nDeath.\nVlad, at some point, began to fear for his life. He supposedly had a weakness to Vladamantium (a radioactive metal alloy) and therefore decreed that all Vladamantium must be crafted into non-knife objects. \nUpon discovering a plot against him, Vlad set a tax on torches and pitchforks so as to quell any mob uprisings. The conspirators prepared stocks of mirrors, wooden stakes, and garlic.\nUltimately, Vlad ended up fleeing from a violent mob. He was burned to death; his bones were claimed by a villager and locked in a special coffin topped with a gargoyle.\nSecond Coming.\nIn the post-Storm era, Vlad has returned in the form of a &lt;a href=\"Mist%20Monsters\"&gt;mist monster&lt;/a&gt; deployed by the Storm, inspired by Vlad's supposed vampirical qualities. This monster was defeated, but it is not certain whether Vlad is truly gone forever."}

He used his ship's lights to send a morse code message to everyone on the island: \"GET REKT\".\nA group of Marauders calling themselves The Wasteland Warriors led by &lt;a href=\"Megalo%20Don\"&gt;Megalo Don&lt;/a&gt; would arrive on the Island along with the sandstorm, they immediately took control and claimed ownership of the Sand Biome with &lt;a href=\"Ringmaster%20Scarr\"&gt;Ringmaster Scarr&lt;/a&gt; building The &lt;a href=\"Nitrodrome\"&gt;Nitrodrome&lt;/a&gt; where once stood &lt;a href=\"Fencing%20Fields\"&gt;Fencing Fields&lt;/a&gt;.

In the meantime, Megalo Don and his crew cause chaos and destruction over the Wasteland, causing conflict with opposers such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Chums\"&gt;The Chums&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Underground\"&gt;The Underground&lt;/a&gt; and their new wastelander allies, including &lt;a href=\"Rust\"&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brite%20Raider\"&gt;Brite Raider&lt;/a&gt;. \nAfter hearing some chatter, Hope sent The Looper to get more information, they learns from &lt;a href=\"Brite%20Raider\"&gt;Brite Raider&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rust\"&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt; that Megalo Don has been writing down some plans that feels unusual given his normal behavior and that everything is at &lt;a href=\"Redline%20Rig\"&gt;Redline Rig&lt;/a&gt;. The Looper then infiltrate the Refinery, and take down a guard to get their keycard card and access Redline Rig's terminals. After sending all the data to Jones and Hope, they learn &lt;a href=\"The%20Machinist\"&gt;The Machinist&lt;/a&gt; is Megalo Don's sole competent engineer and that her mission is to build the pipeline. After that, Hope also learn that the Wastelanders have started to find gems from &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt;. Feeling that the Box wants to be found, understanding that the Box want to be found, she decide to recover all the gems to avoid them falling into wrong hands. Meanwhile, the people of the Island keep feeling like they're being watched by a mysterious hooded figure around various locations on the Island. Megalo Don, through his &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Transmission\"&gt;Mysterious Transmissions&lt;/a&gt;, states that the powers of the gems from &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt; attracted him here, feeling worthy of its power he wanted to take it for himself. He also reveal that he and The Wanderer share a common goal and the later has important matters to resolve. Megalo Don orders that nobody should see his face, claiming it to be beyond their comprehension, or maybe not. It is so mysterious that even Megalo Don himself has not seen their face.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; would find and recover one of these gems at &lt;a href=\"Brutal%20Beachhead\"&gt;Brutal Beachhead&lt;/a&gt; and give it to Hope, which would give her a sudden headache. Later another from &lt;a href=\"Ringmaster%20Scarr\"&gt;Ringmaster Scarr&lt;/a&gt;, who was seemingly not aware that her boss was searching them was recovered; after thinking &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; is cool, was willing to trade her Pandora gem to The Looper for \"a stunt so dangerously, rip-roariously metal that it makes the gods wet their big, golden bloomers.\" Once her gem is given to &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;, she reveal she just got a vision of &lt;a href=\"Megalo%20Don\"&gt;Megalo Don&lt;/a&gt; working with a cloaked Wanderer. Later Jones discovered the third gem was owned by Peabody, once the Looper managed to get it after helping their auto technician in training, Dummy and gave the gem to Hope, she got another headache, stronger this time. With the pipeline starting to make good progress, and the Warriors' plan nearing a successful ending, Hope order to fin the last gem. After talking to Peabody, The Looper learns Megalo Don kept his valuable in cache on the Island. After searching the caches in vain, they tried to recover Megalo Don's map of his hidden cache, once done The Looper recovered the Gem and gave it to Hope which causes &lt;a href=\"The%20Oracle\"&gt;The Oracle&lt;/a&gt;, who prophesied The Wanderer, to return and assist &lt;a href=\"The%20Underground\"&gt;The Underground&lt;/a&gt; in what comes next. In the meantime, The Wanderer assures Megalo Don of his plan with The Leviathan ship, so Megalo Don spends his time hunting for &lt;a href=\"Vengeance%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; to get his Pandora gems back. \n&lt;a href=\"Refinery%20Event\"&gt;Refinery Event&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile failing to recover his gems, Megalo Don activated his pipeline to fuel The Leviathan to finally raze the Island, only for the pipelines to be hacked by &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Doom\"&gt;Doctor Doom&lt;/a&gt;, which causes it to explode in a chain reaction, which also causes the rise of &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt;, near Redline Rig.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt; harnessing the power of &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt;, he no longer needed Megalo Don and \"took care of\" him, causing the Wasteland Warriors to disband their operations, leaving The Leviathan stuck in its place and the Wasteland losing its spirit."}

Weak Points allow players to do 100 damage to structures instead of the regular 50 damage, allowing them to harvest materials faster. Players cannot use weapons or object to prompt weak points to appear.\nFor structures that take one harvesting tool swing to be destroyed, weak points will not appear when they are hit with a harvesting tool. For structures that take two harvesting tool swings to be destroyed, weak points will appear after the first hit, but there is no use trying to hit the weak point.\nTo hit a weak point, a player have their crosshair on the blue circle or red dot and must hit it with their harvesting tool. Weak points move on the structure after being hit by a player, so for structures that have a large quantity of health points, it may be hard to hit all the weak points consecutively because of their movement.\nIf objects are big enough, like cargo shipments (ones like those that appear in &lt;a href=\"Dirty%20Docks\"&gt;Dirty Docks&lt;/a&gt;), a weak point may move to the opposite side of the object.

In terms of raw [average-damage per second (A-DPS)], pure (DMG) builds generally underperform by &gt;20% vs. critical-heavy perk builds; and &gt;25% vs. headshot-focused perk builds.\nKnow your perks.\nKnowing the perks you need depends on:\nDamage Per Second vs. Damage Per Shot.\nIn Fortnite where 95% of husks die in 1-2 shots, DPS is generally irrelevant; it is only during mist-monster/mini-boss engagements -- where players are forced to weapon cycle (i.e. empty clip &gt; reload &gt; empty clip &gt; repeat) -- that is it becomes absolutely critical.\nDPS in of itself is a poor indicator of any given weapon's overall effectiveness. This number is derived by the Base Damage multiplied by Fire Rate; it does not factor in Headshot Accuracy Percentage, Headshot Damage Multiplier, Critical Hit Rating, Critical Hit Damage, Elemental Damage Resistance, Impact Threshold, Ammo Cost Efficiency, Magazine Size, Reload Time, Variable Range Effectiveness, Bullet Velocity and Spread, etc.\nThe highest \"average Damage Per Second\" builds are very different to the min/max \"average Damage Per Shot\" builds of a single bullet. In order to get the 'highest dps', players need to literally piss ammo (and weapon durability) into the wind. In many gameplay scenarios, players (effectively) have infinite ammo and resources (as long as they gather them) but certain game modes (like &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Bash\"&gt;Horde Bash&lt;/a&gt;) restrict the materials you have significantly.\nPhysical vs. Elemental vs. Energy.\nBy design, \"physical\" (non-elemental) type husks will only comprise 5-20% (on average) of the opponents you will face in a map. Even at the very top end of &lt;a href=\"Twine%20Peaks\"&gt;Twine Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, 4 player challenge missions, husks don't suddenly become 100% \"elemental\". Even during a 'tanky' &lt;a href=\"Smasher\"&gt;Smasher&lt;/a&gt; wave, they will not be 100% \"elemental\" smashers, insteade a mix of 80% \"physical\" and 20% \"elemental\" smashers, with staggered spawns between them.\nObsidian vs. Shadowshard.\nObsidian if you're using your weapon for \"fodder\" killing; Shadowshard if you're using your weapon for \"tank\" killing.\nEfficiency per Craft / Resource Availability:\nTheoretically, the most effective way of allocating resources is to have 1 energy based weapon on Obsidian and 3 element specific weapons on Shadowshard. Common consensus indicate that Shadowshard is actually rarer than Obsidian.\nWhat we can takeaway from these comparisons is that Shadowshard will always be less efficient in terms of damage/ clip as compared to Obsidian. We must not forget that the availability of both resources also play a part.\nIf this player chooses to only craft Obsidian weapons, even though they are tapping on that 4.17% efficiency per craft, they are actually losing 50% efficiency in resource usage. The damage output is irrelevant regardless of which element base your Shadowsharded weapon uses, which in turn means we prioritize efficiency per craft instead. Considering how Energy Damage perk should be placed on a more general-purpose weapon which you will use a lot more, it benefits from having more efficiency per craft and it is thus better to Obsidian it.\nBest Weapon Perks.\nAssaults.\nCritical [crit-rating(x1)/crit-damage(x2)] builds; especially on assault weapons has a base crit chance of 15% or higher. Even if an &lt;a href=\"Urban%20Assault\"&gt;Urban Assault&lt;/a&gt; hero lands a (HS) multiplier at 100% ratio per mission; the (CRT) build underperformance to the Headshot (HS) build is insignificant; in most situations, the (DPS) difference varies between &gt;3-5%.\nShotguns.\nCritical [crit-rating(x1)/crit-damage(x2)] builds only. Shotgun weapons have the poorest (HS) multiplier out of any weapon class; but score the highest base (DMG) and (CRT) multipliers.\nPistols.\nAlways aim for the head; headshot (HS) builds generally outperform all other build variants, especially the Beagle and Whisper .45.\nSnipers.\nSniper weapons have a \"very high\" base (HS) multiplier, so its efficient to run (HS) builds.\nLaunchers.\n[Impact] offers better utility value in virtually all scenarios; sending husks flying away and delay their time to reach the objective. \nLaunchers are high [Impact] all-purpose crowd-control/cannon-fodder [Burst (DPS)] killing weapons, and should never be used for [Sustained (DPS)].\nMelee.\nCritical [crit-rating(x1)/crit-damage(x2)] builds only; melee weapon effectiveness are largely dependent on heroes that either boost melee (DMG) or critical rating (ie. Harvester, Deadly Blade, &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Wool%20Syd\"&gt;Steel Wool Syd&lt;/a&gt;). If both the base hero and support hero are boosting 18% crit rating each, it is beneficial to modify double [crit-rating(x1)/crit-damage(x2)] dmg perks on melee weapons.\nWhat is the Best Loadout Optimization?\nIn conclusion, here's the min-maxers ranking for doing the most damage across the board\nIt is a plus if you can mix up the ammo type these guns use to achieve some ammo efficiency as well!\nRemember, it does not make sense to carry multiple weapons that serve the same purpose. Examples of weapons serving different purpose would be:\nConclusion.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_Q8IYyUNQf9QzYO-napOf0-5nKLCQnAjKZOV7eTRDFQ/edit%23gid%3D1854439518\"&gt;The saddest takeaway from all this math is\u2026&lt;/a&gt; \"Crit Chance/Crit Damage\" really reigns supreme!

It used a new system of resources and items to upgrade weapons, to create new ones. Animal Bones as well as Mechanical Parts are used to upgrade Makeshift weaponry into Primal or Mechanical Weapons respectively (Mechanical weapons are standard weapons, such as the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Rifle\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Revolver\"&gt;Revolver&lt;/a&gt;). Unlike weapon upgrading, it did not use Bars. Furthermore, Crafting would only create new weapons, and could not upgrade the current rarity of a weapon, as all crafting advances a weapon by a rarity, but creates a primal or makeshift weapon. Crafting was completed in the player inventory.\nPlayers could still upgrade weapons using bars, alongside this system.\nFrom Chapter 2: Season 1 to and including Chapter 2: Season 4, &lt;a href=\"Upgrade%20Bench\"&gt;Upgrade Benches&lt;/a&gt; could have been found in key locations across the Island, primarily in named POIs, but still often found in other areas across the map.

It was first introduced in &lt;a href=\"Season%206\"&gt;Season 6&lt;/a&gt;, but expanded upon in and .\nDescription.\nWeather is a dynamically shifting gameplay mechanic within each match of Battle Royale. Weather is split two types:\nWeather Events.\nWeather Events are localised and randomised events which can happen multiple times a match, but only in one location at a time. Currently there are only two weather events, these being Tornadoes and Lightning Storms.\nVisual Weather.\nVisual Weather is a type of weather in which the only change is the aesthetic of the map, with restrictions to visibility. These will occur across the entire map at once, and will either appear during specific in game events, or periodically in normal matches.\nWeather Events.\nTornado.\nTornadoes take twenty-five seconds to form and will last roughly eight minutes. Tornadoes will suck up and throw props around the environment, similar to how they can be moved with a &lt;a href=\"Grab-itron\"&gt;Grab-itron&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Saucer\"&gt;Saucer&lt;/a&gt;, and will pull nearby players into it and upwards, allowing for &lt;a href=\"Glider%20Redeploy\"&gt;Glider Redeploy&lt;/a&gt;. Tornadoes are localized and will slowly move across the map.\nLightning Storm.\nLightning Storms take eight seconds to form and will last roughly three minutes. Webs of lightnings will occasionally appear on the ground shortly before a lightning strikes from the stormy clouds. Players will take 10 damage if they are struck by a lightning, but gain a &lt;a href=\"Pepper%20Effect\"&gt;movement speed boost&lt;/a&gt; when hit. It can strike 2-3 players at once. Players are more likely to get struck by a lighting when on a high area or when swimming. Lightning Storms will also create &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;.\nVisual Weather.\nFog.\nFog was first seen in Chapter 2: Season 8, as a periodic weather change which affected the whole island at once. Fog makes visibility difficult, but does not change any gameplay mechanics. It will dissipate after a short time.\nBlizzard.\nBlizzards have only appeared during the &lt;a href=\"Winterfest%202019\"&gt;2019 iteration of Winterfest&lt;/a&gt;. They functioned very similar to fog, appearing across the entire island at once and dissipating after a short time.\nPermanent Fog.\nPermanent Fogs have appeared several times in different Fortnite events. , for example, had a thick purple Fog across the entire island for the entirety of the event, but only during night time."}

However, they reformed near the end of the same season to help &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; and their allies in their fight against &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; and his forces. \nAfter the victory and the banishment of the gods that were in Zeus' side, The Underground established themselves as the Island's protectors, dealing with issues related to Pandora's Box and threats that could harm the island such as the &lt;a href=\"Wasteland%20Warriors\"&gt;Wasteland Warriors&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter being joined by the Avengers, X-Men, and other heroes all summoned by &lt;a href=\"Wastelander%20Magneto\"&gt;Wastelander Magneto&lt;/a&gt; from to fight &lt;a href=\"The%20Wanderer\"&gt;The Wanderer&lt;/a&gt; alias Doctor Doom, The Underground became a group of superheroes.\nLocations, Members, Allies and Technology.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicles.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nHistory.\nPost-&lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Bang\"&gt;Big Bang&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Montague\"&gt;Montague&lt;/a&gt; founded The Society an organization made up of the &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;islands&lt;/a&gt; most wealthy and powerful elites at an unknown time period several decades if not centuries ago. This led most of the elites including &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;'s family to join, with &lt;a href=\"Silas%20Hesk\"&gt;Hesk&lt;/a&gt;'s family being the only one not to join The Society, and remained neutral, until their &lt;a href=\"Silas%20Hesk\"&gt;heir&lt;/a&gt; decided to stand against them in the future despite the multiple invitations to join the organization from &lt;a href=\"Montague\"&gt;Montague&lt;/a&gt; decades later. Once they were born, &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valeria\"&gt;Valeria&lt;/a&gt; were raised in The Society., Valeria later took the place of their parents as head of their family and rose to the highest rank, joining Montague at the top of The Society. \nHowever, Hope slowly realizing how terrible they were, was driven by her sense of justice, and with Valeria growing more power hungry after digging into their grandfather's old books on &lt;a href=\"The%20Pantheon\"&gt;The Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; she decided to reject the ideals of The Society and left the organization before founding &lt;a href=\"The%20Underground\"&gt;The Underground&lt;/a&gt;, a rebel organization dedicated to fighting the corrupted elites, where she would be joined with others who were also affected negatively by The Society. Valeria would soon read about the powers of &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt;, she would share her findings with the other leaders leading them to search for &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt; in order to gain more power. Believing Jones had the answers they seek, the Bosses kidnapped Peely. Hope would find &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt;, offering her help to find &lt;a href=\"Peely\"&gt;Peely&lt;/a&gt;, in return of his help against The Society. Silas Hesk would begin funding The Underground war efforts against The Society. By this period, the bosses of The Society each had a medallion with a fraction of the gods' power to make themselves stronger, it's unknown when they got them and how nor if previous generations bosses had their own.\nChapter 5: Season 1.\nHowever, this plan backfired, as Jones, who had no knowledge of the Box yet was willing to go to extreme measures to save his friend, went to war with them with the help of &lt;a href=\"The%20Underground\"&gt;The Underground&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver the course of the &lt;a href=\"Takedown%20Quests\"&gt;Takedown Quests&lt;/a&gt;, Jones and Hope, would search around the island gathering information about Peely's Location. With The Looper's help they worked together to Eliminate Legion Guards and Elites, Steal Society &lt;a href=\"Medallions\"&gt;Medallions&lt;/a&gt;, and defeat the Bosses of the Society, which culminate in Jones finally &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Peely%20Rescue\"&gt;Rescuing Peely&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Fencing%20Fields\"&gt;Fencing Fields&lt;/a&gt;. These attacks cause the Society's control over the Island to begin to falter.\nAs The Society's power continued to dwindle, a strange traveler arrived on the Island, named &lt;a href=\"Odyssey\"&gt;Odyssey&lt;/a&gt;, and a strange Mosaic that bears a warning was discovered. After hearing about The Looper and seeing part of their fate, she recruited them to help her in her research about The Mosaic that she believed to herald something and that it's linked to the ancient power that she feels on the Island. As The Looper managed to find more fragments of The Mosaic, Odyssey revealed that the Society Medallions that the leaders of The Society possessed, contained a fragment of this power, and that this same power grows stronger. Later, after a series of earthquakes near Valeria's camp, a &lt;a href=\"The%20Hand\"&gt;Titan's hand&lt;/a&gt; emerged from the ground, holding the chained Pandora's Box, meaning Valeria finally found it. Sometime later, the box was broken free from the chains by Valeria, and unleashed a giant beam of light and countless souls out of the box.\nChapter 5: Season 2.\nPrior to the beginning of this season, The Underground had severely weakened The Society's forces. Once Valeria had opened &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt;, the Pantheon gods, &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;, hunted the rest of the Society down, leaving the Underground as a success, causing Hope to disband the team until further required.\nDuring this time, The Looper whose fate was read by The Oracle is chosen to become the Hero of mortals, whose purpose is to unite the immortals against &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; and defeat the King of Gods. After having passed the tests of strength, agility and wisdom of The Oracle, then that of Hades which consisted of defeating &lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt;, The Looper was challenged by Ares and declared war on the gods by defeating the god of war and stealing his medallion.\nAfter being informed of the situation by Hades and Ares, Zeus became enraged and sent Edicts to the gods while also recruiting followers. At the same time, Aphrodite joins The Looper's side, although she thinks the fight is lost, but little by little she regains her fighting spirit. After deciphering some of Zeus' Edicts, they discover that Zeus plans to recruit Artemis, however The Looper manages to gain an audience with her and recruit her before Zeus.\nHope, eventually realizing she just can't sit back and watch power be misused, restores The Underground back into action to stop the wrongdoings of the gods, specifically Zeus. In the meantime, Cerberus reveals that he has been tasked by Zeus to investigate the Looper's actions, but offers to stop if the Looper helps him find a lost artifact that Hades had entrusted him with. Hades reveals that he hid the artifact- a toy ball for Cerberus- during Zeus' tempest. To relieve Cerberus' stress, he puts the ball's scent on The Looper and had them 'play' with Cerberus, which allows him to find the ball and return it to his doghouse in &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Gate\"&gt;Grim Gate&lt;/a&gt;. The Looper goes back to the Oracle, and is informed that Medusa is the one to recruit against Zeus next.\nEventually, The Looper contacted &lt;a href=\"Medusa\"&gt;Medusa&lt;/a&gt; and teamed up with her against Zeus. Through some adventures, they end up in breaking hourglasses which artificially increased the power of Zeus, then during a final raid bringing together the immortals from The Looper's side and The Underground at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Mount Olympus&lt;/a&gt;, The Looper destroyed the Stormforged Hourglass, making Zeus mortal before facing him in a duel which the god lost and ended severely injured. At the end of the battle against the Zeus's faction, Hope tagged his former throne with the symbol of The Underground proclaiming a reign of freedom.\nChapter 5: Season 3.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; struck &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt; with lightning, The Underground noticed a ship coming out of the Sandstorm headed towards the island. Hope and a few Underground members went to look at the incoming &lt;a href=\"Sandstorm%20Event\"&gt;Sandstorm&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Wasteland%20Warriors\"&gt;Wasteland Warriors&lt;/a&gt; arrive on The Leviathan and began wreaking havoc and chaos everywhere they went.\nHope and Jones discover that &lt;a href=\"The%20Machinist\"&gt;The Machinist&lt;/a&gt; is building a Pipeline from Redline Rig to power The Leviathan back up, they quickly contact &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; to fight on their behalf while they continue to gather information in order to find a way to takedown their leader &lt;a href=\"Megalo%20Don\"&gt;Megalo Don&lt;/a&gt;. Hope makes a makeshift base at &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Steppes\"&gt;Sandy Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, she soon discovers a gem holder connected to Pandora's box. They contact The Looper and asked them to talk with Wastelanders &lt;a href=\"Brite%20Raider\"&gt;Brite Raider&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rust\"&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt;. They tell them that Megalo Don has been writing his plans down, and that something has been going on at &lt;a href=\"Redline%20Rig\"&gt;Redline Rig&lt;/a&gt;, The Looper is then tasked with sending over information from the Rig's terminals to Hope. Later after hearing the chatter in the Wasteland, Hope discover Wastelanders have been finding Gem, that she suspect came from Pandora's Box. Realizing that Megalo Don and his crew are out there searching for these Pandora gems as well, Hope and Jones sent The Looper to go collect the first gem at &lt;a href=\"Brutal%20Beachhead\"&gt;Brutal Beachhead&lt;/a&gt; and brings it back to them, The Looper finds and hands over the first gem to Hope, who begins to develop a strange headache whenever she's close to a Pandora gem. \nSoon after, &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; tasks The Looper with retrieving another one of Pandora gems this time at the &lt;a href=\"Nitrodrome\"&gt;Nitrodrome&lt;/a&gt; after impressing &lt;a href=\"Ringmaster%20Scarr\"&gt;Ringmaster Scarr&lt;/a&gt;, she agrees to trade over her Pandora gem. The Looper gives Hope the Second gem as she begins to tell them about all the short visions she's been getting every time she interact with a gemstone, Hope tells The Looper to not tell Jones anything as she doesn't want him to get worried about her. \nJones later tells The Looper to go speak with &lt;a href=\"Peabody\"&gt;Peabody&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Pea%20Bois%20HQ\"&gt;Pea Bois HQ&lt;/a&gt; after assisting Peabody around his shops he hands over the third Pandora gem, The Looper gives the gem to Hope as her headaches and short visions get longer, she tells The Looper she's been getting visions of &lt;a href=\"Megalo%20Don\"&gt;Megalo Don&lt;/a&gt; working together with &lt;a href=\"The%20Wanderer\"&gt;The Wanderer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Nisha\"&gt;Nisha&lt;/a&gt;, realizing she has nothing, talks to her older brother &lt;a href=\"Kavel\"&gt;Kavel&lt;/a&gt; about joining The Underground and rebuilding a life for themselves and for a better world. Once the final Pandora gem from Megalo Don had been retrieved, &lt;a href=\"The%20Oracle\"&gt;The Oracle&lt;/a&gt; returns to guide Hope through what comes next as &lt;a href=\"Wastelander%20Magneto\"&gt;Magneto&lt;/a&gt; calls in reinforcements to aid in battle for Hope. After the &lt;a href=\"Refinery%20Event\"&gt;Refinery Event&lt;/a&gt; Megalo Don's pipeline exploded revealing &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt; underneath Ridline Rig, The Oracle now wiling to aid in the up coming fight against The Wanderer tells Hope of her true destiny revealing that Hope was mean to be at the bottom of Pandora's box and that she alone is mean for greatness, along with warning them of The Wanderer's presence that will soon change everything.\nChapter 5: Season 4.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Megalo%20Don\"&gt;Megalo Don&lt;/a&gt;'s pipeline exploded revealing Pandora's Box, The Wanderer reveals himself as the great &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Doom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt; and immediately absorbs all the powers of Pandora's Box before recruiting many dangerous villains to his side by summoning &lt;a href=\"The%20Raft\"&gt;The Raft&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Underground teams up with all the heroes summoned by Magneto, with Jones taking up the mantle of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20America\"&gt;Captain America&lt;/a&gt;, while Hope prepares herself to become a &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Hope\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt;. Nisha and Kavel, former members of The Society finally decided to join The Underground. With previous allies and members such as &lt;a href=\"Starr%20Oakley\"&gt;Starr Oakley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brite%20Raider\"&gt;Brite Raider&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rufus\"&gt;Rufus&lt;/a&gt; and many more rejoining The Underground's forces in an effort to help their friends Hope and Jones.\nGwenpool was captured by Doom's forces and imprisoned in one of The Raft's cells. She asked help from The Looper to accomplish her mission, first by asking them to take out a guard and steal their ID Chip. After she analysed the chip, Gwenpool tells them that it doesn't have everything she needed. She therefore asks The Looper to hack into The Raft system for her by using Doom's passphrase, Cynthia. The Looper recovered the drive that they then gave to Gwenpool. Later, as part of the last step of her plan she asks The Looper to search around The Raft to recover computer chips that Shuri needs for her plan, involving The Rift Beacons. The Looper does so and gives her everything she needed, before leaving. Gwenpool would later escape her cell and reunite with the other heroes.\nLater, The Looper and Jones try to find Doom together, but are unsuccessful. Hope calls The Looper to make them come investigate the crater left over by &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt; next to Redline Rig as something weird was spotted. Upon arriving and investigating, The Looper finds the broken mask of Doom. After a discussion with The Oracle they come to the conclusion, it's a prototype, and hands it over to Hope for further analysis. After bringing the broken mask to Hope, she expresses her doubts on how to stop Doom. The Looper and Jones later continued their investigation at Redline Rig to see if there are other pieces of Doom's broken armor, with Jones noting that Doom must have wanted them to find his mask. However they don't find anything else. Afterwards, Hope sends The Looper to retrieve the recording devices she placed at &lt;a href=\"Fractured%20Four\"&gt;Fractured Four&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cynthia%20von%20Doom%20Memorial\"&gt;Cynthia von Doom Memorial&lt;/a&gt;. They find that Doom has been there pondering his thoughts, as he speaks about the corrupted powers of the Box and how it keeps trying to overtake him, leading him to go into hiding for now, to make himself new armor. But this information tells them nothing about his whereabouts. So Hope subsequently sends The Looper to retrieve one of the chips implanted in the heads of Doom's Henchmen for analysis, noting that they no longer have to worry about how to defeat Doom, since they have to find him first. \nJones and The Looper continue their search for Doom's whereabouts, they search around the many dig sites guarded by Doom's henchman, as they speculate there must be a paper trail that could lead them to Doom, The Looper takes down a henchman and collects a shipping manifest. Jones then sends The Looper to go talk with &lt;a href=\"War%20Machine\"&gt;War Machine&lt;/a&gt; who has been analyzing some henchman notes, he discovers that Doom is incorporating parts of &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt; into his new suit, he tells The Looper to start training and allows them to use some of his gear such as &lt;a href=\"War%20Machine%27s%20Arsenal\"&gt;War Machine's Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"War%20Machine%27s%20Hover%20Jets\"&gt;War Machine's Hover Jets&lt;/a&gt;. Elsewhere Hope desperate and nervous askes &lt;a href=\"The%20Oracle\"&gt;The Oracle&lt;/a&gt; if she has foreseen anything new, The Oracle talks about a feline ally, a cunning plan and a victory hidden in defeat. Jones finds &lt;a href=\"Shuri\"&gt;Shuri&lt;/a&gt;, the feline ally The Oracle spoke of, as he explains Shuri's plan on taking down Doom's bot.\nHope tasks The Looper with collecting supplies for Shuri, while Jones fully explains the plan of reversing the energetic flow of the Rift beacons with Rift recalibrators so they can possibly send Doom somewhere, far away from the &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;island&lt;/a&gt; but they aren't sure if this plan can work so Hope suggest they try this plan on Doombot first. Hope starts to have doubts on herself thinking she might not be good enough to lead in the war against Doom. Elsewhere The Looper hands over the parts they gathered to &lt;a href=\"Shuri\"&gt;Shuri&lt;/a&gt;, she attaches the new Rift recalibrators onto three rift beacons around &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Doom\"&gt;Castle Doom&lt;/a&gt;. Hope sends in The Looper to defeat Doombot, but something goes wrong as the recalibrators start to short circuit.\nHope and Shuri soon find out that Doom's lieutenants &lt;a href=\"Mysterio\"&gt;Mysterio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Emma%20Frost\"&gt;Emma Frost&lt;/a&gt; were the one's who tampered with the Rift beacons, Hope realizes they can't just fight Doom and get it over with instead they need to get rid of his lieutenants first.\nHope and Jones scout out &lt;a href=\"Doomstadt\"&gt;Doomstadt&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"The%20Oracle\"&gt;The Oracle&lt;/a&gt;'s guidance, and discover that Mysterio has been mind controlling the people of Latveria, the wastelanders and their own henchman in order to create the illusion of perfection. \nThe Looper is tasked with going around the island freeing everyone under Mysterio's control, before taking out the many security cameras around Doomstadt, leaving &lt;a href=\"Mysterio\"&gt;Mysterio&lt;/a&gt; with no other way of controlling the people of Latveria. With everyone now free Hope with The Looper's and Jones' help went to confront Mysterio. After a long fight The Underground succeed in liberating the people of Doomstadt spraying graffiti around the town and on the statue of Doom. \nJones sends The Looper to talk with &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Stark\"&gt;Iron Man&lt;/a&gt;, and Tony allows The Looper and The Underground to use his tech as they begin to make up a plan to defeat Emma Frost. After a test of Stark Tech, The Looper is sent to fly over Castle Doom to check the Rift Recalibrator signal while Tony gave power dampeners to reduce Emma's psychic influence to Hope. Jones then send The Looper to test again the power of Stark Tech. Later, as Doom's army began to recover the Arcane Artifacts, which are fragments of Pandora's Box that Doom wants to use for his new armor, all over the Island, &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom's Chosen&lt;/a&gt; emerge to collect them and bring them to Doom. These six artifacts being intended to complete Doom's Pandora's armor, triggering a great battle between heroes and villains dubbed as Day of Doom.\nAt Hope's request, mission details have been encrypted and classified and instructions have been hidden for &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; on the Island. After The Looper found the phone, they got a call from Hope on a securised channel and she told them the plan: using the Stark Power Dampeners to reduce Emma's psychic powers and then launch an assault against her. The Looper first used forecast towers to locate Emma Frost's operatives and learned they were already looking for them. Then they hired a specialist on order to make sure everything was good to place the power dampeners around &lt;a href=\"The%20Raft\"&gt;The Raft&lt;/a&gt;. Once done, Hope switched The Looper back to the main communication channel and was intending to coordinate an attack along with Jones and the other allies. However Rift Recalibrators detected &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt;'s signal, and he was heading toward &lt;a href=\"The%20Raft\"&gt;The Raft&lt;/a&gt; meaning he finished his new armor. Jones warned Hope about this, but was caught in a moment of panic forcing The Looper to face Emma Frost alone, but they managed defeated her. \n&lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt;, and their allies brace themselves for &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt;'s imminent arrival, setting up rift beacons near the central lake with the plan to send him back to his home reality. &lt;a href=\"Peelverine\"&gt;Peelverine&lt;/a&gt; is left in charge of activating the beacons, but he quickly delegates the task to The Looper. As &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; activates the beacons one by one, they all begin to aim towards Doom's Arcane Forge.\n As the final beacon fires at the forge, &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; active the rift but Doom's glowing green head emerges from the Arcane Forge, that was shielded, unleashing a powerful energy burst that engulfs the surrounding area with a wall of debris. Emerging as a giant, Doom swiftly annihilates almost everyone who opposes him in the area. After Doom flickered War Machine aside, Jones hurls his shield at Doom, but it has no effect and Doom knock him to the ground. With Doom poised to finish him off, Hope leaps into action, she grabs Jones's shield and shields them both as the King of Latveria launches energy blasts at them. In a bold move, Doom grabs Hope, bringing her face-to-face with him. She stabs him in the eye with the shield still charged with Pandora's magic, leaving Doom with a scar over his eye which enabled a weak point suppressing his physical immunity. However Hope injured her own arm in the process. &lt;a href=\"Peelverine\"&gt;Peelverine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gwenpool\"&gt;Gwenpool&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"War%20Machine\"&gt;War Machine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Man%20Mk%2045\"&gt;Iron Man&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Spider%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Iron Spider&lt;/a&gt;\u2014supported by an army of Loopers\u2014charge in, engaging Doom in an epic battle at the central lake. Ultimately, the heroes and Loopers prevail, managing to weaken Doom enough to activate the final rift beacon, stripping him of his Pandora's Box powers and sending him back to his home reality. During the fight against Doom, three rift beacons were launched aside, landing at &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Glacier\"&gt;Grand Glacier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brawler%27s%20Battleground\"&gt;Brawler's Battleground&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Restored%20Reels\"&gt;Restored Reels&lt;/a&gt;, and throughout the next few days, pumpkins and vines would begin to appear as Ultima Carver's Halloween Reality begins to merge with the Island. During this chaos, Hope spray paints the &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; Island on the screen of Restored Reels, while Stark's Rift Beacon residing there began to spark opening a rift and sending everyone onto the &lt;a href=\"Chapter%202%20Remix\"&gt;Apollo Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nChapter 2 Remix.\nHope would disband The Underground and leave the &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt; Island after realizing Pandora's Box was just the beginning, with &lt;a href=\"Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; on her side. She tried to contact &lt;a href=\"Valeria\"&gt;Valeria&lt;/a&gt; and convince her to meet up by bringing up some old memories, just to end up being ignored, and put on voice mail over and over. Hope would set up a meeting between The Underground and Valeria hoping her sister would show up. Hope would try calling her sister one last time, to tell Valeria about her strange power to see the future through her art."}

The Visitor along with The Scientist settled their base in one of the Dusty Depot hangars, making it their laboratory. The Scientist, presumably with the help of The Visitor started to build Rift Beacons, to open 6 Rifts that would allow the other members of the Seven to come with their Rockets in due time. Later The Visitor is seen studying B.R.U.T.E. and reverse engineering them as seen on the screens of the laboratory. \nAfter building the Rocket, The Visitor left Reality Zero, while &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; entered The Loop, as he had to be inside to trigger the device. The Scientist having left tapes for himself. When the time came during The End, The Visitor came with his own rocket from one of the Rift just like the rest of The Seven, except Paradigm. With the help of other Rockets he unfreeze the meteor and teleport it to the top of the Zero Point to make it collide with and contain the Zero Point's explosion before leaving via a Rift.

This fails, however, and due to reasons unknown, the Storm returns, angrier than ever before.\nConfirmed in the official Fortnite website, the Storm created the Wall of Water as revenge against Midas. It was temporarily contained by the Storm Shield, but after two days it broke through and caused a tsunami that flooded much of the island.\nSome players believe that Midas' plan was actually to break a time loop that creates the Battle Royale, and that when it failed it somehow created the Wall."}

It is the second primordial entity born after &lt;a href=\"The%20Nothing\"&gt;The Nothing&lt;/a&gt;. It was the source of the , heart of &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt; and the origin of all reality in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Omniverse\"&gt;Omniverse&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn , it was revealed that it was shattered into pieces after , implying the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Asteria\"&gt;Asteria&lt;/a&gt; Island and &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt; alongside it. One of its fragments later landed on &lt;a href=\"Oninoshima\"&gt;Oninoshima&lt;/a&gt; in . \nOverview.\nThe Zero Point is a nexus orb that is where all of reality apparently sprang from. It cycles through countless realities per second and can be used as an infinite power source or as a \"bridge to other realities\". It appears to have an outer hull/shell surrounding and containing a central core, consisting of dozens of tendrils of pure energy, with the ability to open portals. The tendrils can become entangled, as seen in the &lt;a href=\"Zero%20Crisis%20Finale\"&gt;Zero Crisis Finale&lt;/a&gt;. During that event, &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; caused the Zero Point to bloom by untangling the tendrils in an effort to stop it from imploding. It was ultimately not enough, and the Foundation was forced to create &lt;a href=\"The%20Spire\"&gt;The Spire&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt possesses the power to alter reality in any way possible. During its unstable state, it can send out reality waves that randomly alter the very fabric of time and space. These reality waves can restore locations from a specific moment, during &lt;a href=\"Season%20X\"&gt;Season X&lt;/a&gt;, It changes &lt;a href=\"Dusty%20Divot\"&gt;Dusty Divot&lt;/a&gt; back to &lt;a href=\"Dusty%20Depot\"&gt;Dusty Depot&lt;/a&gt; a moment before &lt;a href=\"The%20Meteor\"&gt;The Meteor&lt;/a&gt; hit and freeze it in time.\nFor thousands of years, The &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; abuses The Zero Point by using it as a bridge to different realities and bring their \"order\" to them. They also use it to maintain &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt;, seemingly enclosing the entire island in a dome like 'field.'\nAfter , The Imagined Order forces in Reality Zero was defeated; Freeing the Zero Point from their control.\nThe Zero Point usually shows its sentience during impending dangers. During , The Zero Point was summoning relics from other realities as a means of communication. The Scientist sent The Looper and AMIE to recover them. Every time they did, a Zero Point energy shockwave was released. The Scientist notes reveal the shockwaves it had been causing were a galactic distressed signal (a flare); It was sending a message for help from the &lt;a href=\"The%20Herald\"&gt;next threat&lt;/a&gt;; but it was too late. The Zero Point later went dormant at that time.\nAfter the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;, the Zero Point awakened; gathering the surviving pieces from both of the islands. With the help of &lt;a href=\"AMIE\"&gt;AMIE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;; The Zero Point is restored to full power. The Paradigm initiates Zero Fusion and pieces from different realities come together to form &lt;a href=\"Asteria\"&gt;Asteria&lt;/a&gt;. The Zero Point hid under &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Henge\"&gt;Hidden Henge&lt;/a&gt; for that time period.\nIn , The Zero Point was exposed again after part of the Island's surface collapsed due to earthquakes caused by &lt;a href=\"MEGA%20City\"&gt;MEGA City's&lt;/a&gt; impact. However, The Zero Point had entered a petrified state from losing a lot of its energy from Zero Fusion.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Chapter%204%20Season%20OG%27s%20Reality\"&gt;Chapter 4 Season OG's Reality&lt;/a&gt;, the resulting effect of &lt;a href=\"The%20End\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt; was different from the original; The Zero Point of this timeline also collided with the Meteor and Athena was sucked into it, just as it happened in Reality Zero. However; &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hole%20%28physical%20object%29\"&gt;The Blackhole&lt;/a&gt; was altered due to Jones' interference with time, and it instead exploded resulting in another Big Bang, replacing Chapter 4 Season OG's Reality with plenty of new Galaxies containing different &lt;a href=\"The%20Omniverse\"&gt;Realities&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt; island.\nIn , a fragment of The Zero Point landed in Reality 783; revealing the zero point was destroyed between and .\nPersonality.\nThe Zero Point is a very enigmatic entity whose intentions are very difficult to pin down. Although completely aware of everything that is happening, it lets things happen even when it involves its own state, allowing itself to be enslaved and abused by the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt;. When threat such as &lt;a href=\"Galactus\"&gt;Galactus&lt;/a&gt; attacked it, it let things happen and simply attempted to annihilate reality to destroy Galactus by becoming a Black Hole again, without caring about the people living in Reality Zero. But on the other hand, it called for help and tried to warn the Islanders of &lt;a href=\"The%20Herald\"&gt;The Herald&lt;/a&gt;'s arrival and defended itself when &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt; tried to capture it. Making it obvious that it tolerates almost everything, never intervening and leaving people to deal with their problems on their own, except when The Nothing and the fate of the whole Omniverse are involved.\nAppearance.\nThe Zero Point is a large glowing orb that is constantly emitting the power of creation in the shape of plant-like tendrils. The interior of the orb is hollow and big enough to fit a person inside but it is also the place that contains the raw power of creation.\nPower and Abilities.\nAll that is currently known about the Zero Point's \"&lt;a href=\"Power%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Power of Creation&lt;/a&gt;\" and its abilities are as follows:\n class=\"fandom-table mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" width=\"100%\" style=\"style=\"padding:0px\"\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| &lt;a href=\"Power%20of%20Creation\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n!\nBig Bang&lt;hr&gt;Bloom into a countless layers of lotus flower to create plenty of new Galaxies and Realities. &lt;a href=\"The%20Omniverse\"&gt;The Omniverse&lt;/a&gt; was created by the Zero Point during the its emergence.\n!\nReality Creation&lt;hr&gt;Can produce a new Reality.\n!\nReality Annihilation&lt;hr&gt;The power of creation can also be used to destroy reality.\n!\nReality Warp&lt;hr&gt;It possesses the power to alter reality in any way imaginable. It can send out &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Wave\"&gt;Reality Waves&lt;/a&gt; that will alter the fabric of time and space, as well as create &lt;a href=\"Snapshots\"&gt;snapshots or copies&lt;/a&gt; of the matter in Reality Zero.\n!\nZero Fusion&lt;hr&gt;Merging pieces of fractured realities together into one. During the process, The Zero Point will open portals to random realities and uses its tendrils to snatch a chunk of land from it. However, several negative effects are to be expected, such as the sacrifice of the person who initiated this phenomenon, a relatively short lifespan of the created reality, and the petrification of the Zero Point.\n!\n&lt;a href=\"Pure%20Portals\"&gt;Reality Portal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;hr&gt;The Zero Point itself is a massive portal that cycles through countless realities infinitely. By using vibrational energy attuned to a specific reality, it can lock on to that reality for short amount of time.\n!\nReality Bloom&lt;hr&gt;A self-healing mechanism, it can bloom into a huge lotus like flower to release all unstable energy in an attempt to stabilize itself. Just like Zero Fusion, this phenomenon must be activated by a third party.\n!\nReality Awareness&lt;hr&gt;It is aware of imminent threats and dangers. The Zero Point was aware of &lt;a href=\"The%20Herald\"&gt;The Herald&lt;/a&gt; before her attack on the island. If the threat is linked to &lt;a href=\"The%20Nothing\"&gt;The Nothing&lt;/a&gt;, it will start showing signs of significant activity, such as bringing back artifacts or creating shock waves to warn people.\n!\nInfinite Energy&lt;hr&gt;The Stabilized Zero Point is an infinite source of pure creation energy that can be harnessed for many uses. &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neo%20Tilted\"&gt;Neo Tilted&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt; used the Zero Point as their main power source. &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Mecha Team Leader&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Galactus\"&gt;Galactus&lt;/a&gt; used it to not only replenish them, but also make them stronger.\n!\nTendrils&lt;hr&gt;Can shoot out Tendrils that have the ability to pull anything from a previous time or different reality.\n!\n&lt;a href=\"Black%20Hole%20%28physical%20object%29\"&gt;Black Hole&lt;/a&gt;&lt;hr&gt;When the Zero Point is extremely damaged, imploding over itself or under certain unknown conditions, it will explode, releasing what could have been seen as stars before transforming into a black hole. After a while, the Black Hole appears to shrink and explode, creating a new reality from the matter of the old reality that was sucked out and restoring the Zero Point to it's original state.\n!\nPetrification&lt;hr&gt;The Zero Point appears in this state after its power has faded out from unknown circumstances.\n!\n&lt;a href=\"Rift\"&gt;Rift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;hr&gt;A crack in spacetime, a type of portal that can lead into random places on the island or other realities.\nCreations.\n class=\"fandom-table mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" width=\"100%\"\n!Image\n!Description\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Omniverse\"&gt;The Omniverse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Countless realities that originated from the Zero Point.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Island\"&gt;The Island&lt;/a&gt;&lt;hr&gt;An artificial island created by the Zero Point located in &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20In-Between\"&gt;The In-Between&lt;/a&gt;&lt;hr&gt;The realm of The Zero Point that connects all realities.\n&lt;a href=\"Pure%20Portals\"&gt;Pure Portals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Portals created by Tendrils shot out by and linked to the Zero Point.\n&lt;a href=\"Zero%20Point%20Crystals\"&gt;Zero Point Crystals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Crystalized unstable zero point energy.\n&lt;a href=\"Zero%20Point%20Desert%20Biome\"&gt;Zero Point Desert Biome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;hr&gt;The Zero Point Desert was created by the destabilization of Zero Point after the \n&lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer%20of%20Worlds\"&gt;The Devourer of Worlds&lt;/a&gt; event.\n&lt;a href=\"Reality%20Bloom%20Biome\"&gt;Reality Bloom Biome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;hr&gt;The Zero Point Forest was created by the liberation of the Zero Point after the \n&lt;a href=\"Collision\"&gt;Collision&lt;/a&gt; event.\nReferences.\n=Ingame=\nThe Zero Point is an object in that was first introduced during &lt;a href=\"Season%209\"&gt;Season 9&lt;/a&gt; and appeared in several season but only served as a Gameplay Mechanic during &lt;a href=\"Season%20X\"&gt;Season X&lt;/a&gt; and .\nTrivia.\n= Gallery =\n=Audio=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}
