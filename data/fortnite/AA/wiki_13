{"id": "123846", "revid": "54531759", "url": "https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki?curid=123846", "title": "Victory Crown Rogue", "text": "The Victory Crown Rogue, also known as the Rogue Bike, is a &lt;a href=\"Vehicles\"&gt;vehicle&lt;/a&gt; in . It was introduced in , alongside the &lt;a href=\"Nitro%20Drifter\"&gt;Nitro Drifter&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe Victory Crown Rogue is a 2 wheeled, high speed futuristic motorcycle with 2 seats (driver and passenger). The driver can move forward, steer, brake, superslide and walk backwards, as well as activate the fuel boost of the vehicle. The boost allows the Victory Crown Rogue to breach its normal maximum rectilinear top speed, at the cost of consuming fuel very quickly. A boosting Victory Crown Rogue is among the fastest possible travel methods in the game and will move at 82km/h on any terrain. Despite this, the Victory Crown Rogue normally goes much faster on road (max speed of 72km/h) than it does on uneven terrain, although it doesn't feature the worst off-road capabilities overall. Ramming into enemies will deal damage and launch them afar.\nThe tires of the Victory Crown Rogue have their own separated health bars, so damaging them won't affect the real integrity of the bike itself. However, destroying a tire will make the vehicle hard to handle, especially while boosting, as well as forcing it to absorb damage over time. These effects are doubled if both tires get popped up. Like the &lt;a href=\"Trail%20Thrasher\"&gt;Trail Thrasher&lt;/a&gt;, the Rogue cannot be upgraded with or &lt;a href=\"Cow%20Catcher\"&gt;Cow Catchers&lt;/a&gt;, so the only way to replace lost tires is the use of a &lt;a href=\"Repair%20Torch\"&gt;Repair Torch&lt;/a&gt; to restore it to full armor.\nThe driver of the Rogue can shoot their own &lt;a href=\"Weaponry\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and use items, all whilst maintaining the momentum they have gathered. Simply using the aim, switch or shoot commands will trigger the pullout of the item; in this state, the driver can still turn even if their hands are not actually controlling the handlebar, though they cannot initiate a jump on the countrary. Not firing anything for a few seconds will automatically re-enter the full drive mode. The same applies to the passenger, who will be in a fixed position unless employing items. However the passenger can also &lt;a href=\"Building\"&gt;build&lt;/a&gt;, while the driver cannot. Additionally, the driver has the ability to either do a stunt or wheelie the Victory Crown Rogue (only if boosting) and both crew members can perform tricks while in the air, collecting trick score (purely visual). The Rogue can also rotate on its axis during air time, or sharply turn with a superslide that piercingly tilts the vehicle towards a different direction. The faster the Rogue is going, the smoother the superslide.\nThe Victory Crown Rogue has 550HP and limited fuel. When reaching 0HP, it will enter a vehicle death state and then explode, damaging everything nearby, starting a &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; and turning into a wreckage.\nNews Tab.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

{"id": "41523", "revid": "38871908", "url": "https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki?curid=41523", "title": "AIs", "text": "&lt;br&gt;\nAI (Artificial Intelligence) is a series of programmed opponents, allies and other characters in . AI is a very broad term for Non-Player Characters, but the first instance of an AI opponent dates back to &lt;a href=\"Season%206\"&gt;Season 6&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nAI can refer to a large number of non-player characters within Battle Royale, and they come in three basic categories:\nAs such the term AI can refer to characters who exist solely to aid the matchmaking process, or as enemies that have a different function or ability, compared to the player.\nBots.\n&lt;a href=\"Bots\"&gt;Bots&lt;/a&gt; are an informal name for the AI that are used in place of a human player during a match. Bots will use a set number of &lt;a href=\"Cosmetic%20Items\"&gt;cosmetics&lt;/a&gt;, ranging from &lt;a href=\"Recruit%20Outfits\"&gt;Recruit Outfits&lt;/a&gt; to sometimes even &lt;a href=\"Unreleased%20Cosmetics\"&gt;Unreleased Cosmetics&lt;/a&gt;. They also have randomly generated names, often having two words in camel case followed by a 1 or 2 digit number. \nBots are identified by their Usernames, &lt;a href=\"Cosmetic%20Items\"&gt;Cosmetic Items&lt;/a&gt; and especially their movement and gameplay. Bots are designed to act like low skilled players, but some aspects of their function make them identifiable. Such actions include:\nBots are most commonly found when matchmaking on or with a user who is on Mobile or Nintendo Switch, as the game considers them low skilled due to those platforms' more difficult controls and fills lobbies with excess Bots. On top of this, areas which may experience low player counts, such as the overnight hours in a server region, can have matches filled with Bots. As a rule of thumb, &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Based%20Matchmaking\"&gt;lower skilled players&lt;/a&gt; are more likely to match-make with bots. Bots are never found in &lt;a href=\"Arena\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Team%20Rumble\"&gt;Team Rumble&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Impostors\"&gt;Impostors&lt;/a&gt;, or Creative matches.\nBots were also able to be spawned via Bot Grenades in &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Lab\"&gt;Battle Lab&lt;/a&gt; when the mode was still available. &lt;a href=\"Friendly%20Bot%20Grenade\"&gt;friendly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enemy%20Bot%20Grenade\"&gt;enemy&lt;/a&gt; bots could be spawned with the respective grenades. The bots acted very similar to bots found in Battle Royale playlists, but only used Recruit Outfits and appeared to have more accurate aim than regular Bots.\nMonsters.\n&lt;a href=\"Monsters%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;Monsters&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes called \u201cCreatures\u201d and commonly called \u201cZombies\u201d by the community, are AIs that often appear around &lt;a href=\"Fortnitemares\"&gt;Fortnitemares&lt;/a&gt;, with some exceptions. They act very similar to the &lt;a href=\"Monsters\"&gt;Husks&lt;/a&gt; in . Monsters currently come in four variants: &lt;a href=\"Cube%20Monsters\"&gt;Cube Monsters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cube%20Monsters\"&gt;Sideways Monsters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Legion\"&gt;Ice Legion Monsters&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Shadows\"&gt;Shadows&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Cube%20Monsters\"&gt;Cube Monsters&lt;/a&gt; were introduced for &lt;a href=\"Fortnitemares\"&gt;Fortnitemares 2018.&lt;/a&gt; They come in several variants, and walk slowly towards the player, attacking them with melee attacks. When eliminated, they drop varying loot. Cube Monsters will spawn indefinitely until their &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Spawner\"&gt;Monster Spawner&lt;/a&gt; is destroyed. Cube Monsters are passive to &lt;a href=\"Zombies\"&gt;Jumpscare Zombies&lt;/a&gt; and will not attack them.\n&lt;a href=\"Ice%20Legion\"&gt;Ice Legion&lt;/a&gt; monsters were introduced in &lt;a href=\"Season%207\"&gt;Season 7&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Storm\"&gt;Ice Storm&lt;/a&gt; event. They functioned almost identical to the Cube Monsters, besides having a ranged monster, and being ice-themed.\n&lt;a href=\"Shadows\"&gt;Shadows&lt;/a&gt; were part of , as real players. They were soon added as AI enemies that spawned during the night in &lt;a href=\"Impossible%20Escape%21\"&gt;Impossible Escape!&lt;/a&gt; LTM called \u201cDaybreak Ghosts.\u201d\n&lt;a href=\"Monsters%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;Sideways Monsters&lt;/a&gt;, introduced in , are newer versions of Cube Monsters. They only spawn in &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Anomalies\"&gt;Sideways Encounters&lt;/a&gt; and locations controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Anomalies\"&gt;Sideways&lt;/a&gt;. They drop &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;Cube Monster Parts&lt;/a&gt; and Ammunition upon death.\nSideways Bosses are stronger versions of Sideways Monsters with significantly more Health, which is shown above them. They drop higher tier weapons upon being eliminated.\nZombie AIs.\n&lt;a href=\"Zombies\"&gt;Zombies&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes called \u201cJumpscare Zombies,\u201dare AIs that were introduced for &lt;a href=\"Fortnitemares\"&gt;Fortnitemares 2019&lt;/a&gt;. They were later readded in &lt;a href=\"Fortnitemares%202021\"&gt;Fortnitemares 2021&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Fortnitemares%202022\"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;. They unexpectedly jump out of certain objects with the intention of Jumpscaring the player. Once out, they act identically to Creatures and attack players. Objects they jump out of include Corn Fields, &lt;a href=\"Hideouts\"&gt;Hideouts&lt;/a&gt;, Fridges, Dumpsters, and many more. Zombies are passive to certain bosses such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Inkquisitor\"&gt;The Inkquisitor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Willow\"&gt;Willow&lt;/a&gt;. They are also passive towards &lt;a href=\"Monsters%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;Cube Monsters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wildlife\"&gt;Zombie Chickens.&lt;/a&gt; \nGuards.\n&lt;a href=\"Guards\"&gt;Guards&lt;/a&gt;, originally called \u201cHenchmen,\u201d were introduced in Chapter 2, as a form of AI that have guaranteed spawns at certain map locations. Guards encompass a variety of opponents and factions, existing as a cross between an AI opponent and a player. They will spawn at locations, rather than needing to deploy from the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Bus\"&gt;Battle Bus&lt;/a&gt;, and have varying Health, often more than the player. Guards can be knocked, eliminated, &lt;a href=\"Shakedown\"&gt;shaken down&lt;/a&gt;, and revived by fellow guards and Bosses of their faction.\nGuards will usually attack you on sight, but there are some exceptions. Guards will not attack you if you use a &lt;a href=\"Phone%20Booth\"&gt;Phone Booth&lt;/a&gt; that disguises you as their faction. Guards may also spawn with gear that cannot be obtained by the player without first eliminating them.\nMarauders.\n&lt;a href=\"Marauders\"&gt;Marauders&lt;/a&gt; are hostile AIs that act similarly to guards. They were introduced in and vaulted afterwards. They spawn in large groups from &lt;a href=\"Marauder%20Capsule\"&gt;Marauder Capsule&lt;/a&gt;s. Marauders have different classes, but are of the same faction. What differentiates Marauders from regular Guards is that they can build rudimentary structures. These structures will be marked with a unique white paint job across the center. When idle, Marauders can regain Health by dancing.\nStark Robots.\n&lt;a href=\"Stark%20Robots\"&gt;Stark Robots&lt;/a&gt; are AIs introduced in and vaulted afterwards. They are very similar to Guards, the only difference being that they do not have the ability to be &lt;a href=\"Shakedown\"&gt;shaken down&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, they can be hacked, allowing up to three Stark Robots to become your ally for the rest of the match or until they get eliminated. They are found at &lt;a href=\"Stark%20Industries%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Stark Industries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quinjet%20Patrol%20Sites\"&gt;Quinjet Patrol Sites&lt;/a&gt;.\nHenchbros.\n&lt;a href=\"Henchbros\"&gt;The Henchbros&lt;/a&gt; were introduced in , as a &lt;a href=\"GHOST%20Enforcer\"&gt;lonely GHOST Henchmen&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"SHADOW%20Enforcer\"&gt;lonely SHADOW Henchmen&lt;/a&gt; who later became friends and formed a duo. The group then grew with the &lt;a href=\"Trespasser%20Defector\"&gt;lonely Trespasser&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Order%20Remnant\"&gt;lonely IO Guard&lt;/a&gt; who joined them during and with the &lt;a href=\"Svenja\"&gt;lonely Seven Sentry&lt;/a&gt; who joined them during . \nThe Henchbros are unable to be knocked. They are initially passive to players and will only become hostile if you attack one of them.\nBosses.\n are an advanced form of Guards who have very high amounts of Health. They usually drop unique &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Items\"&gt;Mythic Weapons&lt;/a&gt; upon elimination and are identified by their unique &lt;a href=\"Outfits\"&gt;outfit&lt;/a&gt; and gear. Most of the time when you get close to a Boss, the boss-specific music will start playing and you will hear them speak. Two or more Bosses can't spawn in the same POI or Landmark.\nStarting from , Bosses typically have unique abilities (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Zero%20Point%20Crystals\"&gt;Zero Point Crystals&lt;/a&gt; dash) and their health will be displayed above them. Some of them can also appear far bigger than the player as evident with Cube Assassin.\nLater on in , all Bosses are now slightly taller than the player character. Some of them are even bigger than the registered Boss height as evident with The Foundation. Now in some cases there can be two Bosses together in the same POI, evidenced by Command Cavern (guarded by &lt;a href=\"Gunnar\"&gt;Gunnar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Huntmaster%20Saber\"&gt;Huntmaster Saber&lt;/a&gt;) and The Collider (guarded by &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Huntmaster%20Saber\"&gt;Huntmaster Saber&lt;/a&gt;)\nWhen eliminated, Bosses will often drop their own , &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Items\"&gt;Healing Items&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bars\"&gt;Bars&lt;/a&gt;, and depending on the Boss, a &lt;a href=\"Keycards\"&gt;keycard&lt;/a&gt;.\nMando's Bounty Hunters.\n&lt;a href=\"Mando%27s%20Bounty\"&gt;Mando's Bounty&lt;/a&gt; Hunters are hostile AIs in &lt;a href=\"Mando%27s%20Bounty\"&gt;Mando's Bounty&lt;/a&gt; LTM. The Boss symbol, i.e. , would appear above them when you got close enough.\nCharacters.\n are advanced AI that have a multitude of purposes. \nThe full table of Characters can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Character%20Collection%20Book\"&gt;Character Collection Book&lt;/a&gt; which sometimes includes the Bosses. They can be used to purchase items from, ranging from to (Excluding ), start &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;bounties&lt;/a&gt;, and they can also be hired, acting like a hacked &lt;a href=\"Stark%20Robots\"&gt;Stark Robot&lt;/a&gt;. Most characters are friendly, and will only attack the player when attacked first, or when 'challenged' for loot.\nHostile Characters.\nLike bosses, they will attack the player on sight, but when eliminated, they will turn into glitchy ghost form and become an interactable Character. Hostile NPC will drop , or gear, &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Items\"&gt;Healing Items&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bars\"&gt;Bars&lt;/a&gt;. They are identified by their unique &lt;a href=\"Outfits\"&gt;Outfit&lt;/a&gt; Styles.\nInteractable NPC.\nCharacters that are interactable, but aren't included in the &lt;a href=\"Character%20Collection%20Book\"&gt;Character Collection Book&lt;/a&gt;.\nPassive Healer.\nCharacters from that are stationed around the map with &lt;a href=\"Chug%20Splash\"&gt;Chug Splash&lt;/a&gt;, Emote with the NPC and they will throw a Chug Splash. These characters are not a guaranteed spawn due to the fact that they can spawn anywhere on the map throughout a game.\nWildlife.\n&lt;a href=\"Wildlife\"&gt;Animals&lt;/a&gt; are a subset of &lt;a href=\"AIs\"&gt;AIs&lt;/a&gt;, first introduced in , and expanded upon in . They roam around certain areas, and their behavior towards the player depends on the animal.\nGorgers and Gatherers.\nGorgers and Gatherers are both AI opponents exclusive to that will spawn in a similar frequency to &lt;a href=\"Marauders\"&gt;Marauders&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Gorgers\"&gt;Gorgers&lt;/a&gt; are large hostile drones which can only be attacked in certain places on their body, for certain periods of time. When eliminated, they will destroy all Gatherers in the area, and explode. They will then drop a large amount of various loot.\n&lt;a href=\"Gatherers\"&gt;Gatherers&lt;/a&gt; are smaller drones which can be attacked normally. When eliminated, they will drop onto the floor, and can be used as a weapon.

After returning, abductees tend to come back with powerful weapons. \u201cThe more orange-looking orbs we were able to collect in &lt;a href=\"The%20Mothership\"&gt;The Mothership&lt;/a&gt;, the better stuff we were allowed to leave with,\u201d one abductee says. \u201cWe could even extend the time limit if we found orbs with the little clocks on them.\u201d\"\n\"You can see the locations of Abductors on your map.

Hope says that she's not ready, but Jones assures her that she is ready for the Final Battle. \nOn October 1st, 2024, a countdown for the live event could be seen in the middle of Island, west of &lt;a href=\"Reckless%20Railways\"&gt;Reckless Railways&lt;/a&gt;, with Rift Beacons pointing at &lt;a href=\"Doom%27s%20Arcane%20Forge\"&gt;Doom's Arcane Forge&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Event.\nPrelude.\nAfter the 5th and final &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Beacon\"&gt;Rift Beacon&lt;/a&gt; activated, all the beacons fire towards &lt;a href=\"Doom%27s%20Arcane%20Forge\"&gt;Doom's Arcane Forge&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;'s command to rift it and &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Doom\"&gt;Castle Doom&lt;/a&gt; out of &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt;. To her surprise, &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt; had already planned ahead and encased the Forge in a magic barrier. Blocking the rift energy and absorbing it into the barrier, which then detonated and unleashed a massive shockwave duststorm onto the players. Launching them and four of the Rift Beacons away.\nCutscene.\nAs the dust disipated, the Colossal &lt;a href=\"Doom%23Doctor%20Doom\"&gt;Doctor Doom&lt;/a&gt; emerged in his Pandora Armor and begun his attack on the island. Being completely invulnerable to the armaments of the &lt;a href=\"Loopers\"&gt;Loopers&lt;/a&gt; and Avengers on the ground, only being lightly tapped by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; on his shoulder as he haphazardly threw &lt;a href=\"Captain%20America%27s%20Shield\"&gt;Captain America's Shield&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt;. Catching his attention in the process and nearly killed before being narrowly saved by &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;, whom took the shield to block a Scorch Beam directed towards him while unknowingly empowering it in the process. Noticing her, &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt; then picked her up in a display of overwhelming power towards &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;, which backfired as she struck him in his eye with the Pandora-Enchanted Shield. Shattering his invulnerability and scorching &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;'s right arm, forcing him to drop her with a glowing scar now etched onto his mask.\nThe heroes group up, and thus the battle has begun.\nDEFEAT DOCTOR DOOM!\nFor the duration of the event, &lt;a href=\"Doom%23Doctor%20Doom\"&gt;Doctor Doom&lt;/a&gt; will always appear at the center of the &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt; battling &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Jones\"&gt;Captain Jones&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gwenpool\"&gt;Gwenpool&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Dual%20Micro%20SMGs\"&gt;Dual Micro SMGs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Peelverine\"&gt;Peelverine&lt;/a&gt; with an &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Assault%20Rifle\"&gt;Combat Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt;. With a staggering and massive Damage Reduction applied to all players towards each other within the arena, all participants must work together to defeat &lt;a href=\"Doom%23Doctor%20Doom\"&gt;Doctor Doom&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the battle goes on, &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Encounters\"&gt;Rifts&lt;/a&gt; would begin to constantly appear around the arena and spawn in &lt;a href=\"Ammo%20Box\"&gt;Ammo Box&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Chest\"&gt;Stark Industries Chests&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Chest\"&gt;Avengers Chests&lt;/a&gt; for players to use against &lt;a href=\"Doom%23Doctor%20Doom\"&gt;Doctor Doom&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"Doom%23Doctor%20Doom\"&gt;Doctor Doom&lt;/a&gt;'s health depleted his armor would slowly begin to crack and glow with Pandora Energy. Once he reached around 5%, the last remaining Rift Beacon was repositioned and activated nearby his location. Charging up a rift that would bring him back to .\nPostlude.\nHaving reached critical damage, &lt;a href=\"Doom%23Doctor%20Doom\"&gt;Doctor Doom&lt;/a&gt;'s armor couldn't sustain the Pandora Energy he absorbed for much longer as it escaped him and were sucked into the &lt;a href=\"Rift\"&gt;Rift&lt;/a&gt;. With him slowly shrinking down and being pulled into it, he lets out one final yell before being forcefully transported out of &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt;. Leaving behind his damaged mask in the dried up lake.\nWith the battle over, the Damage Reduction towards Players was later lifted as &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Jones\"&gt;Captain Jones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gwenpool\"&gt;Gwenpool&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Peelverine\"&gt;Peelverine&lt;/a&gt; began to celebrate the battle won. Doing various &lt;a href=\"Emotes\"&gt;Emotes&lt;/a&gt; at the arena for the remainder of the matches they still appear in.\nDialogue.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nCharacter non-specific Victory Lines.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nAudio.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nNews Tab.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

A popular theory was that it would hit &lt;a href=\"Tilted%20Towers\"&gt;Tilted Towers&lt;/a&gt;, as \"evidenced\" by several clues.\nBetween April 23rd - 27th, 2018, Adam began interacting with the \"r/FortNiteBR\" community, claiming that he had intel on &lt;a href=\"Season%204\"&gt;Season 4&lt;/a&gt;. His most popular post with over a thousand upvotes went as follows:\nAdam's account was deleted a few days later, and so were his posts (possibly at the demand of &lt;a href=\"Epic%20Games\"&gt;Epic Games&lt;/a&gt; themselves to the subreddit's staff).\nAftermath.\nOn May 1st, 2018, &lt;a href=\"Season%204\"&gt;Season 4&lt;/a&gt; was released and confirmed most of Adam's leaks.\nLater with the release of &lt;a href=\"Season%205\"&gt;Season 5&lt;/a&gt; on July 12th, 2018, &lt;a href=\"Moisty%20Mire\"&gt;Moisty Mire&lt;/a&gt; was completely replaced with &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20Palms\"&gt;Paradise Palms&lt;/a&gt;.\nLawsuit.\nOn May 7th, 2018, &lt;a href=\"Epic%20Games\"&gt;Epic Games&lt;/a&gt; issued a lawsuit against Thomas Hannah, who had worked with the company between December 4th, 2017 and April 4th, 2018 as a QA game tester, for breaking a non-disclosure agreement from the company on . Epic claims that Hannah had broken the agreement by trading information on &lt;a href=\"Season%204\"&gt;Season 4&lt;/a&gt; with a personal friend, Adam DiMarco; the infamous u/internetadam, who then leaked it on \"r/FortNiteBR\".\nLegacy.\nThis incident is regarded as one of the first major leaks in the game's history.\nCopycats.\nSimilar \"leaks\" started popping up on \"r/FortNiteBR\", but most of them lacked any credibility and were quickly disproven by the community or the game itself like the \"Leviathan &lt;a href=\"LTM\"&gt;LTM&lt;/a&gt;\" leak, which would become a recurring joke in the community, often in an ironic tone and with &lt;a href=\"https%3A//tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gaslighting\"&gt;gaslighting&lt;/a&gt; involved.\nSimilar Incidents.\nAnother infamous leak happened in September of 2019 when an user posted on the \"r/FortniteCompetitive\" community an image of what appeared to be a new island, containing locations whose names were added into the files in &lt;a href=\"Update%20v10.30\"&gt;Update v10.30&lt;/a&gt; a few days prior. They claimed that it came from a friend who was supposedly an &lt;a href=\"Epic%20Games\"&gt;Epic Games&lt;/a&gt; employee. debuted a month later with &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; as the new map; the exact same island from the image. A lawsuit was issued on Ronald Sykes, the QA game tester responsible for the leak. Sykes had also leaked Chapter 2's &lt;a href=\"swimming\"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt; mechanics and &lt;a href=\"Motorboat\"&gt;Motorboats&lt;/a&gt; on . An user named @OotaMayoYT claimed that the image was a \"concept\" of theirs, and shared a slightly altered version covered with a watermark. It is very likely that they were just using the topic's traction at the time to gain attention. \nAmerican YouTuber &lt;a href=\"https%3A//youtube.com/%40TaborHill\"&gt;Tabor Hill&lt;/a&gt; gained popularity for leaking &lt;a href=\"Party%20Royale\"&gt;Party Royale&lt;/a&gt; and on his channel, but no lawsuit has come out of it."}

Once an egg was destroyed or hatched, a Parasite would appear. It would then stick to nearby &lt;a href=\"Animals\"&gt;Wildlife&lt;/a&gt;, Players, &lt;a href=\"Henchmen\"&gt;Henchmen&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Characters\"&gt;Characters&lt;/a&gt; consuming HP, capping at 75HP remaining. In exchange, it would grant increased speed and jump height, and a resistance to damage from headshot multipliers. While Parasites gave you a jump boost, they did not protect you from fall damage. \nAlien Parasites dropped nothing upon elimination.\nFile on Alien Parasites.\nIt makes sense that Aliens would have their own version of wildlife. And it looks like their wildlife is very keen on ours. The Aliens have unleashed a parasitic species on the Island, introducing a new danger to the ecosystem. However, they\u2019re actually more helpful than the Aliens probably intended.\nKnown simply as Parasites, if one of these mini-Aliens attach to your head, they\u2019ll drain your Health down to 75. (Shield remains unaffected.) But this relationship is more give-and-take than it seems. Not only do they protect you from headshots, but they also make you run faster and jump higher. Parasites have an aversion to water, fire, and, unsurprisingly, attacks.\nThese creatures can often be seen parasitizing &lt;a href=\"Chicken%20%28Animal%29\"&gt;chickens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boar\"&gt;boars&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Animal%29\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;. If you take damage from parasitized wildlife, their slime will gradually deplete some of your Health. Defeating an animal with a Parasite on it will make that Parasite jump on you, which could very well be a sound strategy. We expect their population to grow as they adapt to the Island."}

It was introduced in &lt;a href=\"Season%205\"&gt;Season 5&lt;/a&gt;.\nFunctionality.\nThe All Terrain Kart seats four players, consisting of one driver and three passengers. The driver has full control the vehicle, and is able to drive forwards, reverse, brake and also drift (by using the handbrake whilst moving forwards). The handbrake enables the driver to build up a charge, which the longer it is held, the larger the speed boost the kart receives. This is known as 'Power-sliding'. Whilst in the air, the driver can build up 'trick score'. This has no effect aside from visuals, and a notification in the elimination feed. The ATK does not work in water. The driver is also able to honk the horn of the vehicle.\nThe passengers can shoot, heal, emote and crouch whilst on a seat of the ATK. If seats are available, they can freely switch between them, in a clockwise motion. Players in the back seat can lean backwards to allow the kart to have a greater air time, allowing for longer distances covered. This is done by holding the 'move backwards' key when in the rear seats. If a player jumps on the roof of an ATK, it will prevent fall damage and give a small boost to jump height. The boost given after this jump still enables fall damage.\nObtained.\nThe All Terrain Kart could have been found at various locations across the &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; map. They had a very low spawn rate."}

As a result, most of the Island was flooded, but the water slowly receded. \nWhen the Island returned to normal water levels, a new danger approached, and superheroes from the Marvel universe were called by &lt;a href=\"Thor\"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt; to fight against the incoming threat, &lt;a href=\"Galactus\"&gt;Galactus&lt;/a&gt;, attracted by the Zero Point's energy. The Devourer of Worlds arrives and pulls the Zero Point out of the ground in order to consume it, cracking it and taking everyone to &lt;a href=\"The%20In-Between\"&gt;The In-Between&lt;/a&gt;.

It was repaired in &lt;a href=\"The%20Spire\"&gt;The Spire&lt;/a&gt; and eventually returned to the Bridge by the IO. &lt;a href=\"Raz\"&gt;Raz&lt;/a&gt; arrived to study The Spire but got corrupted by The Cube's powers, which attracted an alien race known as The Last Reality. During the invasion, The Spire was the first location to be abducted. The Imagined Order declared war against The Last Reality and prepared a counterattack to destroy &lt;a href=\"The%20Mothership\"&gt;The Mothership&lt;/a&gt; hovering above the Island. \nThe Imagined Order succeeded, but caused Cubes stored in the Mothership to fall to the Island and progressively corrupt it. These Cubes were led by &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%20Queen\"&gt;The Cube Queen&lt;/a&gt;. The Cubes conversed towards the middle of the Island, forming &lt;a href=\"The%20Pyramid\"&gt;The Pyramid&lt;/a&gt; in which The Cube Queen used to summon The Last Reality through a portal during &lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28Chapter%202%29\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt; of Chapter 2. To preserve their reality, the Foundation freed Jones from IO captivity to help flip the Island, defeating the Cube Queen and closing the portal, revealing a brand-new island beneath it, &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;. \nApollo was playable for a total of 782 days before it was flipped by &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;its creator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt;, making it unplayable.

He is a God of the Olympian Pantheon, son of &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; and Leto, and the twin brother of &lt;a href=\"Artemis%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;. \nHe is a supporting character in , serving as a supporting protagonist in .\nHistory.\nBefore Chapter 5.\nApollo became the consultant of the oracles and the Muses, overseeing all prophecies. Long ago, he chose someone to become his trusted &lt;a href=\"The%20Oracle\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;. That Oracle, who used to be a mortal, became an immortal, and one day, both of them learned that &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; would be overthrown by the hands of a mortal. Learning this, &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; started to become wary of the mortals, becoming more and more distant, until wishing for their total annihilation, causing conflict within the Pantheon.\nHe sees the movement against Zeus' plan, and agrees with Aphrodite, Poseidon and some of the other gods about the idea of the Mortals being spared and protected, but out of little desire to get involved in a battle that'll split the Pantheon, he continues his godly duties while he waits for the prophecy to be fulfilled by &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; with help from The Oracle and &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;.\nZeus has now been humbled and dethroned, and so the Pantheon are now free, scattered to the infinite corners of reality to search for new domains to rule over. After this battle for freedom and peace, Artemis tells her brother to take a vacation to rest his spirit for a while, where afterwards he too will be in search of a new domain away from the &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Every module is assigned to a group that describes when the module is executed. Modules communicate with data, encapsulate behaviors, stack with other modules, and write functions. Modules are built using High-Level Shading Language (HLSL).\nModules that are part of the System groups execute first, handling behavior that is shared with every emitter. Then, modules and items in the Emitter groups execute for each unique emitter. Following this, parameters in the Particle groups execute for each unique particle in an individual emitter. Finally, Render group items describe how to render each emitter's simulated particle data to the screen.\nEmitters.\nEmitters are containers for Modules that are reusable throughout a project, though they are single-purpose. Simulations can be created using Emitters, but rendered differently with the same emitter. \nEmitters support inheritance as multiple children (or emitters deriving from the same emitter) can be created.\nSystem.\nNiagara systems are containers for multiple emitters, all combined into one effect. \nUsage in Fortnite.\nStarting in , Niagara was used to create particles and VFX for &lt;a href=\"Motorboats\"&gt;Motorboats&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Movement\"&gt;Swimming&lt;/a&gt; Mechanic. In addition, Weapons started to use Niagara for when a weapon was shooting.\nWith the launch of , Niagara helped to aid &lt;a href=\"Nanite\"&gt;Nanite&lt;/a&gt; with creating debris for when objects were destroyed in the environment."}

Fortnite\u2019s followers were confused and didn\u2019t take much notice until Fortnite added to the News Feed in-game.\nWithin minutes of the event being over, at 4:01 PM ET, #FreeFortnite was trending #1 on Twitter.\nIn just under an hour, Fortnite decided to tweet out some important information for their followers. \nThey said:\u201cEpic Games has filed legal papers in response to Apple, read more here: cdn2.unrealengine.com/apple-complain\u2026\u201d\nThe reaction from the community was mainly positive. This was talked about by several different YouTubers/Twitter users (including Tabor Hill, ITalk, postboxpat, iFireMonkey, and more).\nLater, Android users noticed that Fortnite had disappeared from the Google Play Store. A trusted insider (@Slasher on Twitter) revealed that &lt;a href=\"Epic%20Games\"&gt;Epic&lt;/a&gt; had also filed a lawsuit against Google.\nFortnite tweeted out about the subject with one tweet 4 hours after the original rumours began &amp; 2 hours after the lawsuit rumours.
