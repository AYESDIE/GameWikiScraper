It is a dynamic system of burning props and structures in order to deal damage over time to both the world, and players nearby.\nFunctionality.\nFires can be started in several ways, but the primary method is via a &lt;a href=\"Firefly%20Jar\"&gt;Firefly Jar&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"Gas%20Can\"&gt;Gas Can&lt;/a&gt;. If one of these is thrown or detonated, a small fire will begin on the ground. If this fire connects to a wooden prop (any structure piece which provides &lt;a href=\"Wood\"&gt;Wood&lt;/a&gt; as its resource), it will ignite. This ignition deals damage to the structure and will hurt players who stand near it. If the structure is made of &lt;a href=\"Stone\"&gt;Stone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Metal\"&gt;Metal&lt;/a&gt;, it will darken the structure and damage it, but not allow for the spread of fire.\nOnce a structure is alight, it will damage, and potentially spread fire, to other structures in the area. The damage will last until the structure is destroyed, or for a short amount of time (less than one minute). Structures which survive this damage can be lit on fire again.\nFire will not deal any damage upon brief contact, but it will deal 15 damage per tick if a player stays on fire for a prolonged time. Fire will ignore Shield to damage a player, and will instead directly take away their Health.\nFire related items.\nFire can damage the player in 15 Health increments.

The gnomes all met up for what was called a Gnom Talk, referencing a Ted Talk. The main gnome was a uniquely different styled gnome with a blue hat, promoting a new type of Slurp, the Super Slurp Juice. This Super Slurp Juice seemed to be popular to many gnomes, for it was promoted by multiple mini posters and tiny billboards around the island. However, the Gnom Talk ended awkwardly, as the main gnome was blown up from the Super Slurp Juice, as it turned out to have an explosive reaction.\nShortly after the Gnom Talk incident, Super Slurp Juice was downed upon. All the posters and billboards were sprayed over with graffiti, leaving the future of Super Slurp Juice left unknown. However, a figure appeared, hiding in a &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20House\"&gt;Ghost House&lt;/a&gt;. In the basement of the place, he built a lair, filled with multiple Super Slurp Juice objects, as well as mini three robot army and a map with five points marked. The figure was a unique gnome, with a red hat and cybernetic parts of him. His goal was to use Super Slurp Juice as weaponized materials to blow up locations around the map.\nMore gnomes began to show themselves, either grouping up to fight this person using Super Slurp Juice for bad or helping him succeed in his plot. Multiple Super Slurp Barrels have appeared at &lt;a href=\"Named%20Locations\"&gt;Named Locations&lt;/a&gt;, covered with &lt;a href=\"Remote%20Explosives\"&gt;Remote Explosives&lt;/a&gt;. However, gnomes were able to discover these barrels and disarm them before any harm occurred, leaving this mysterious gnome to start his next plan.\nThe cyborg gnome began his next plan of attack. First, he sent his army of robots to spread word of him. The robots would go to random locations and spray the image of the cyborg gnome. After that, the cyborg gnome would attempt to infiltrate &lt;a href=\"Slurpy%20Swamp\"&gt;Slurpy Swamp&lt;/a&gt;, the source of Slurp. In his plan, he would break through a wall of Slurpy Swamp, and pour chemicals into the Slurp vats inside the main building, either to make more Super Slurp Juice or worse. However, his plan failed once again, as the vats were cleansed before any harm was done and the cyborg gnome was forced to flee with a jetpack. However, this attempt also failed, as he crashed into the ground outside of the building, where his remains were left. Shortly after, a memorial was created for the gnome, most likely from his robots. They buried his remains, created a statue in his honor, and placed flowers around the statue. Although the robots vanished, anyone who passes by the statue can pay respects to the cyborg gnome. Sometime after, the memorial was taken down, likely because of the sudden unknown appearance of it in such a random location."}

While traversing the volcanic island, players have to survive grueling waves of husks and defend their resource bases.\nIn Survive the Horde, players find themselves far beyond the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Shield\"&gt;Storm Shield&lt;/a&gt;, at an old mining operation on a volcanic island. The approaching Storm has fractured the island, forcing them to navigate deep fissures filled with lava while traversing the terrain.\nStructure.\nPlayers must defend three resource bases out of the four available: Mine, Cavern, Depot, and Volcano, which are randomly selected at the start of the mission.\nBases.\nPlayers are required to defend each of the three resource bases. If one resource base falls, players will receive fewer &lt;a href=\"Supply%20Drop%20%28Save%20the%20World%29\"&gt;Supply Drops&lt;/a&gt;, and if all three are lost, the mission will fail. It's crucial to use resources and the time between waves wisely.\nWaves.\n11 of the 15 Waves are based on Husk eliminations, with the required number increasing with each wave.\n3 Waves require players to locate and destroy multiple Pillars that have appeared around the base.\nHorde Waves are present, bringing a strong enemy type in large numbers, and gameplay modifiers appear at the start of each wave to change up the action. If a player is reduced to 0 Health, their allies have only a short window to revive them. If the entire team goes down, the mission will fail.\nIn the final wave, lasting five minutes, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;Storm&lt;/a&gt; unleashes everything it has at the players, including &lt;a href=\"Smasher\"&gt;Smashers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flinger\"&gt;Flingers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lobber\"&gt;Lobbers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sploder\"&gt;Sploders&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=\"Mini-Bosses\"&gt;Mini-Bosses&lt;/a&gt;!\nAs wave difficulty increases, players will also have less time between waves to prepare.\nModifiers.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nLoot.\nBreaking down objects with Pickaxes won't yield any &lt;a href=\"Materials%20%28Save%20the%20World%29\"&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt;, so players must rely on the &lt;a href=\"Supply%20Drop%20%28Save%20the%20World%29\"&gt;Supply Drops&lt;/a&gt; that appear between each enemy wave. These Supply Drops provide &lt;a href=\"Weaponry%20%28Save%20the%20World%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ammunition\"&gt;ammo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Resources%20%28Save%20the%20World%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt;, meaning players must survive using these limited supplies alone.\nDifficulty.\nSurvive the Horde features multiple difficulty tiers.

Players can still break structures in the sideways, and when leaving, the Cube Monsters inside cannot follow them. Players cannot see or shoot into the Sideways from the outside, and must enter it to interact.\nSideways Zone.\nEach game one named location will be home to a large orange sphere, which contains the sideways. Inside, all chests (Except &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Chest\"&gt;Rare Chest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"IO%20Supply%20Chest\"&gt;IO Supply Chest&lt;/a&gt;s) will become &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Chest\"&gt;Sideways Chest&lt;/a&gt;s, which drop double the loot, and can contain a Sideways Rifle or Minigun. Cube Monsters will continuously spawn here, and when eliminated, drop &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;Cube Monster Parts&lt;/a&gt;, which can be used to upgrade Sideways Weaponry. Also in the location are red colored geysers, the so-called Corruption Vents, which will launch the player high into the air and allow for &lt;a href=\"Glider%20Redeploy\"&gt;Glider Redeploy&lt;/a&gt;. Players can enter and exit the Sideways location at any point, and the Monsters inside will not follow them.\nSideways Encounter.\nAcross the map are three Sideways Anomalies, which act as small boss fights for the player to attempt. When activated, a Sideways area will appear, and &lt;a href=\"Cube%20Monsters\"&gt;Cube Monsters&lt;/a&gt; will begin to spawn. Players must eliminate as many Cube Monsters are possible in order to continuously increase the time limit, with the monsters increasing in HP as it continues. Eventually, a &lt;a href=\"AIs\"&gt;Boss&lt;/a&gt; enemy may spawn, such as &lt;a href=\"Cube%20Assassin\"&gt;Cube Assassin&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"IO%20Guards\"&gt;IO Guard&lt;/a&gt;, and these will need to be defeated to gain the highest tier loot. Three &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Chest\"&gt;Sideways Chest&lt;/a&gt;s will spawn in the area, and any existing chests will be converted once the anomaly is activated. If the player fails to eliminate Cube Monsters in time, the anomaly will end prematurely.\nThe more enemies the player eliminates, the higher tier loot they will receive, usually in the form of an upgraded Sideways Minigun or Rifle.\nItems and Containers.\nThese items can be obtained inside both versions of The Sideways.\nLocations.\nThe Sideways will only appear at one location per game, and this location will be clearly indicated by an orange colored typeface, and a large orange sphere on the map. Sideways anomalies are marked by the anomaly icons dotted around the map.\nGallery.\n=Lore=\nThe Sideways is a dark, malevolent, monster-filled Reality in &lt;a href=\"Fortnite\"&gt;Fortnite&lt;/a&gt; belonging to the &lt;a href=\"Cube%20Legion\"&gt;Cube Legion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Army%20of%20the%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Army of the Last Reality&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbout.\nThe Sideways is a dark world full of corruption and where gravity is low.

Sideways Rifts are a method of travelling realities without directly or physically using &lt;a href=\"Pure%20Portals\"&gt;Pure Portals&lt;/a&gt; from the Zero Point. As mentioned by The Visitor, a device called 'A Zero Point oscillator' and 'Quantum Field Accelerator' could have been used to crack the fabric of time and space, and make connection between two or more distinct realities. It takes time for the Sideways Rift to close naturally, or it must be closed from both sides at once.\nSideways Rifts, due to their anomaly nature, often cause significant space-time problems, notably by randomly opening smaller Sideways Rifts taking and bringing objects, places or people and making them travel to other Realities.\nThey can also cause incursions of Realities, forcing them to collide like the Sideways Anomalies, rifts causing The Sideways to collide with Reality Zero during \nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%204\"&gt;Season 4&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Crack formed after the &lt;a href=\"Blast%20Off\"&gt;Blast Off&lt;/a&gt; event of &lt;a href=\"Season%204\"&gt;Season 4&lt;/a&gt;, in which &lt;a href=\"The%20Visitor\"&gt;The Visitor&lt;/a&gt; used the rocket to blast through spacetime and escape the Island. From the event up until the launch of Season 5, space time seemed to destabilize around the Island, and smaller Sideways Rifts began forming around the Island, sucking away various objects such as the &lt;a href=\"Retail%20Row\"&gt;Retail Row&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Noms\"&gt;Noms&lt;/a&gt; shop sign, and &lt;a href=\"Motel\"&gt;The Motel&lt;/a&gt; sign. Near the very end of Season 4, Sideways Rifts began bringing in objects from other realities, including ancient dinosaur bones and an ancient wagon.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%205\"&gt;Season 5&lt;/a&gt;.\nMassive amounts of matter where pooled from different realities were swapped around, leading to the replacement of &lt;a href=\"Moisty%20Mire\"&gt;Moisty Mire&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20Palms\"&gt;Paradise Palms&lt;/a&gt; and the desert. Various other changes occurred around the Island, and The Crack seemingly widened during this point as well.\nThroughout &lt;a href=\"Season%205\"&gt;Season 5&lt;/a&gt; The Crack suddenly began to shrink, as reality seemingly started to stabilize, likely the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order's&lt;/a&gt; activities. Once the Sideways Rift reached a tiny size, it turned purple (due to being corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt;) and\u00a0started to shoot purple lightning bolts at a certain spot near Paradise Palms. Eventually, this brought &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube\"&gt;The Cube&lt;/a&gt; to the Island, and the process seemed to have exhausted The Crack in the Sky, causing it to finally close up.\nA Sideways Rift appeared in , leading &lt;a href=\"Galactus\"&gt;Galactus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thor\"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt;.\nBatman/Fortnite: Zero Point.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; opens Sideways Rifts in &lt;a href=\"The%20Metaverse\"&gt;Reality: NF-1935&lt;/a&gt; as their attempt to get back to &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt;. They manipulate Batman into helping them regain access to the Zero Point.\nBatman/Fortnite: Foundation.\n&lt;a href=\"Batman%20Zero\"&gt;Batman&lt;/a&gt; worked together with &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; to close the Sideways Rift from both sides. Batman used the Foundation's Device to close Metropolis' rift and The Foundation used his suit to close the &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Island's&lt;/a&gt; rift.\nAs The Sideways and Reality Zero collided, Sideways Anomalies (Rifts leading to The Sideways) appeared on the map.\nA rift appeared above &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt; returned &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lodge\"&gt;Loot Lodge&lt;/a&gt; back to it. Another rift appeared above &lt;a href=\"Shifty%20Shafts\"&gt;Shifty Shafts&lt;/a&gt; and transformed it into &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Gables\"&gt;Grim Gables&lt;/a&gt;.\n\nSeveral small Sideways rift randomly teleport places or people to Reality Zero. The destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Gate\"&gt;Rift Gate&lt;/a&gt; caused a huge red rift to form above the Island. \nA new chunk of land emerges from the red Sideways Rift and merges with &lt;a href=\"Asteria\"&gt;Asteria&lt;/a&gt;, creating &lt;a href=\"MEGA%20City\"&gt;MEGA City&lt;/a&gt; and a new biome in the lower right corner of the map. A Sideways Rift opens and brings an &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Island\"&gt;altered version&lt;/a&gt; of Loot Lake Island, floating in the air.\nAudios.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nChapter 4.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Holding the aim down sight button will negate all types of damage except explosive towards the player. This will negate roughly 30 shots, before being put on a three second cooldown. Attempting to Jump whilst blocking will make the player dodge roll. This can be used to avoid incoming fire.

While this mechanic exisited in &lt;a href=\"Arena\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt;, it was first introduced to core playlists in &lt;a href=\"Season%20X\"&gt;Season X&lt;/a&gt;. \nFunctionality.\nSkill-Based Matchmaking works in Solos, Duos, and Trios where players matchmake with other players based on their skill level. Stats that influence Skill-Based Matchmaking include the number of Eliminations and Victory Royales. For low skilled players, they are entered a with many Bots (sometimes half or more of the lobby are Bots). As players progress, there will be less Bots in a lobby and more skilled players. In Duos and Trios, the lowest skilled player in the team is factored in the most. \nFor players who play on Mobile or Nintendo Switch, Skill-Based Matchmaking rarely takes effect and they mostly matchmake on lobbies filled with Bots and other lower skilled players to compensate the more difficult controls on those platforms.\nIn Arena playlists, Skill-Based Matchmaking works based on the amount of Hype points and their division, they are matchmaked with other players in the same divsion or league.\nControversy.\nThough the mechanic had good intentions from &lt;a href=\"Epic%20Games\"&gt;Epic Games&lt;/a&gt; were to help less skilled players, this Update created much backlash within the Fortnite community, with many complaining of more skilled players and it being harder to obtain a &lt;a href=\"Victory%20Royale\"&gt;Victory Royale&lt;/a&gt;.\nChanges.\nOn May 4th 2020, Skill-based-matchmaking was removed only for the game mode of &lt;a href=\"Squads\"&gt;Squads&lt;/a&gt; near the end of .

They are a theft-based criminal organization.\nOverview.\nThe Cold Blooded syndicate is a heist group mostly made up mostly of members from the &lt;a href=\"Getaway%20Gang\"&gt;Getaway Gang&lt;/a&gt;, and some former &lt;a href=\"GHOST\"&gt;GHOST&lt;/a&gt; members. \nMembers under the orders of &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Blooded%20Ace\"&gt;Cold Blooded Ace&lt;/a&gt; took control of the island, and sealed their equipment alongside their fortune gained during robberies in &lt;a href=\"Vaults\"&gt;Vaults&lt;/a&gt;. After all their Vaults were robbed and ransacked by the &lt;a href=\"Most%20Wanted%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Most Wanted&lt;/a&gt;, they deserted their bases. Later, other members under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Card\"&gt;Wild Card&lt;/a&gt;, returned during .\nLocations, Members and Technology.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nWeaponry.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nHistory.\nThe presence of the Cold Blooded syndicate had been previously teased by some &lt;a href=\"Characters%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;characters&lt;/a&gt; throughout the season, but the faction officially debuted during the &lt;a href=\"Most%20Wanted\"&gt;\"Most Wanted\"&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Limited-Time%20Events\"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;. \nThey took control of &lt;a href=\"Faulty%20Splits\"&gt;Faulty Splits&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brutal%20Bastion\"&gt;Brutal Bastion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Slabs\"&gt;Shattered Slabs&lt;/a&gt; and established their respective &lt;a href=\"Vaults\"&gt;Vaults&lt;/a&gt;. However, several robbers attacked them, and attempted to heist their loot - thus the Cold Blooded put a price on their heads. This resulted in the robbers banding together and forming the faction: &lt;a href=\"Most%20Wanted%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Most Wanted&lt;/a&gt; - which became the Cold Blooded's main opponent. \nAfter all their &lt;a href=\"Vaults\"&gt;Vaults&lt;/a&gt; were robbed and ransacked during the &lt;a href=\"Most%20Wanted\"&gt;Most Wanted&lt;/a&gt; event, the Cold Blooded deserted their bases. \nUnder the orders of &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Card\"&gt;Wild Card&lt;/a&gt;, they returned, reclaiming the &lt;a href=\"Brutal%20Bastion\"&gt;Brutal Bastion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Slabs\"&gt;Shattered Slabs&lt;/a&gt; vaults and establishing a new one at &lt;a href=\"Mega%20City\"&gt;MEGA City&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Faulty%20Splits\"&gt;Faulty Splits&lt;/a&gt; was formerly located.\nThey took over &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Watch\"&gt;Eastern Watch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Meadow%20Mansion\"&gt;Meadow Mansion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secluded%20Spire\"&gt;Secluded Spire&lt;/a&gt; and established new vaults.\nThe Wild Card Suits and Highcards have vanished - and were replaced by &lt;a href=\"The%20Dealer\"&gt;Dealers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Low%20Cards\"&gt;Low Cards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eclipse\"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt; agents that work for &lt;a href=\"Kado%20Thorne\"&gt;Kado Thorne&lt;/a&gt;.

It is the concluding Live Event of and led to an &lt;a href=\"To%20Be%20Continued%21\"&gt;extended downtime&lt;/a&gt;.\nBuildup.\nIn Week 6 of Chapter 3: Season 2, the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; started building a doomsday machine known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Collider\"&gt;The Collider&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt;, as indicated by the &lt;a href=\"Resistance%20Quests\"&gt;Resistance Quests&lt;/a&gt;. Two weeks later, the first energy readings were detected. The Collider was fully constructed on May 17th and has been sending energy pulses periodically. With the doomsday machine constructed, The Seven has begun repairs on the &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Mecha Team Leader&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt;. Loopers were tasked to obtain parts for the Mecha. Repairs started with the head and body and on May 24th, its legs were reassembled. On &lt;a href=\"https%3A//twitter.com/home\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, content creators and users are getting DMs from the official Fortnite twitter about the &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Strike%20Commander\"&gt;Mecha Strike Commander&lt;/a&gt; guide, in which the community will have to solve the jigsaw puzzle.\nEvent Summary.\nThe event had a custom animation in the &lt;a href=\"Lobby\"&gt;Lobby&lt;/a&gt; for going into the match, where the player's outfit would jump into a hole below them, then spawned on the &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt; inside the &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Strike%20Commander\"&gt;Mecha Strike Commander&lt;/a&gt;. While waiting for the event to start, players could play an -style minigame by entering the gun turrets. During this time, &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt; and members of &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt; conversed with each other, preparing for the attack.\n90 seconds before the event began, &lt;a href=\"The%20Origin\"&gt;The Origin&lt;/a&gt; gave the Loopers a mission briefing. &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt; then enters, and initiates the launch sequence, with the Loopers entering the battle stations. The Mecha heads for &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt;, with Loopers destroying incoming asteroids and &lt;a href=\"Abductors\"&gt;Abductor&lt;/a&gt; debri along the way.\nThe Mecha lands at &lt;a href=\"Synapse%20Station\"&gt;Synapse Station&lt;/a&gt;, only to be greeted by battalions of the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt;'s tanks. A laser strike from &lt;a href=\"The%20Fortress\"&gt;The Fortress&lt;/a&gt; is fired at the Mecha. In a quick time event, the Mecha fires a laser back at The Fortress, destroying the location. As the Mecha continues heading for &lt;a href=\"The%20Collider\"&gt;The Collider&lt;/a&gt;, it is hit by a barrage of missiles coming from &lt;a href=\"IO%20Airships\"&gt;IO Airships&lt;/a&gt;, heavily damaging it.\nAgent Jones sends &lt;a href=\"Peely\"&gt;Peely&lt;/a&gt; in to deliver a Slurp truck using a &lt;a href=\"Cars%23Titano%20Mudflap\"&gt;Mudflap&lt;/a&gt;. The Mecha is healed and repaired when it crushes the truck in its fist and the Paradigm pours the &lt;a href=\"Slurp\"&gt;Slurp&lt;/a&gt; onto it, hurling the truck into an IO Airship when it finishes. The IO begins to send in &lt;a href=\"B.R.U.T.E.\"&gt;B.R.U.T.E.&lt;/a&gt;s to attack the Mecha, which are easily disposed of.\nThe Collider's shield is downed. The Mecha pulls out its &lt;a href=\"Light%20Blade\"&gt;Light Blade&lt;/a&gt;, slashing through the remaining IO Airships. After the final IO vehicles have been destroyed, The Paradigm diverts all power to the Light Blade, and prepares to destroy the Collider. Before this can happen, explosions occurs, and the Mecha falls into the ground below. The Paradigm and the Loopers are ejected from the Mecha.\nAgent Jones comes to assist the Mecha crew. &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; arrives in a tank, and Jones begins leading the Loopers upwards, while the Paradigm attempts to get the Mecha back online. Agent Jones and the Loopers are armed with an &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Scar\"&gt;Seven Scar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; arrives and eliminates several &lt;a href=\"IO%20Guards\"&gt;IO Guards&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; has been exposed, and it begins to rise towards the top of the Collider, shifting realities along the way. The Paradigm manages to get the Mecha back online, and as Jones is distracting Slone with a speech, she crushes Slone and her tank with the Mecha's fist, destroying part of the bridge.\nThe Paradigm then begins to lift the Loopers, Jones, and The Foundation upwards towards the top of the Collider, with the latter two jumping into the Zero Point when it focuses on &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt;. The Loopers then destroy the crystal detonators, and the Zero Point falls back below. The Paradigm protects the Loopers as the Collider collapses.\nMeanwhile, Jones and the Foundation fist bump as they enter Geno's Realm.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nPromotional.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

A Trios mode was available for a limited time from July 12, 2022 to August 30, 2022. In this mode, you'd receive points called \"Hype\" for placement or eliminations. Hype determined your League in Arena. Having a certain amount of points could\u2019ve enabled you to compete in &lt;a href=\"Tournament\"&gt;tournaments&lt;/a&gt; and cash cups.\nThere were many items that are in the main gamemode of that were not in Arena. Examples are &lt;a href=\"Grenades\"&gt;Grenades&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher.&lt;/a&gt; To see the list of items that were not in Arena, see &lt;a href=\"Unavailable%20Items/Mechanics%20%28Competitive%29\"&gt;Unavailable Items/Mechanics (Competitive)&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn May 15th, 2023, Arena was removed and replaced by &lt;a href=\"Ranked\"&gt;Ranked&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Update%20v24.40\"&gt;Update v24.40&lt;/a&gt;.\nCurrently Active Playlists.\nArena was available in Solo, Duos and Trios. Squads were not available.\nRules.\nAll Arena playlists and Tournaments (excluding &lt;a href=\"Zero%20Build\"&gt;Zero Build&lt;/a&gt; modes) followed the rule-set of Battle Royale:\nFeatures.\nSiphon.\nIn regular Battle Royale, if you wanted to get &lt;a href=\"Victory%20Royale\"&gt;Victory Royales&lt;/a&gt;, always fighting people might not be the best way to win. However, in Arena, siphon was enabled. Siphon allows players to regenerates 50 health and/or shield after getting an elimination. In team game modes, if a player were to knock an opponent, they need to fully eliminate the knocked player to get the siphon. When used correctly, it could\u2019ve greatly helped your performance in Arena.\nThe Storm.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt; was more dangerous in Arena, especially as the game progressed. While the first storm took 30 seconds longer to close than standard Battle Royale matches, all other phases were the same and in Arena the later storm circles were known as \"moving\" zones. \nThese later storm phases dealt 8-10 damage per second, which could\u2019ve quickly eliminated an unsuspecting player.\nStorm Surge.\nStorm Surge is a mechanic which encourages players to fight and deal damage. If there are a certain number of players alive during a certain storm phase, Storm Surge will activate. There will be a warning the zone before it actually activates, and when it does, it will periodically deal 25 damage every 5 seconds to certain players. In a team based match, Storm Surge damage instantly eliminates a player with less than 25 effective health even if teammates are alive (does not cause a knockdown state). \nThe players that will be damaged by storm surge depends on how much damage they have dealt. If you are below a certain damage threshold, you will take storm surge damage once it activities. When there is a storm surge warning or when it is active, there will be a UI on the right side of a player's screen telling them whether they are below or above the Storm Surge threshold. \nStorm Surge has a chance of activating in any game, but it only normally happens in stacked arena, tournament, or custom games where more players stay alive for longer. For it to activate, there needs to be more than the number of players in each Storm phase defined below:\nBus Fare.\nBus Fare was a mechanic exclusive to Arena and its Hype system. Bus Fare did not allow players to play endless arena matches without losing anything. In Divisions 1-3, there is 0 bus fare, meaning that if you play a match and do not gain any hype points from placement or elimination, your overall hype will stay the same. However, in division 4, there was a bus fare of 30. meaning every match you play in division 4, you lose 10 points. In Division 5, it's 20 points. Division 6 is 30 points. Division 7 is 50 points, and every division after increases by 10. See the Hype Scoring Format for the bus fare amounts of each division. \nNote that bus fare is, fittingly, applied when the player enters the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Bus\"&gt;Battle Bus&lt;/a&gt;. A player can exit the match in &lt;a href=\"Spawn%20Island\"&gt;Spawn Island&lt;/a&gt; without incurring any penalty.\nIf you reached a Division threshold, and lost points due to bus fare, you would be de-ranked down one division and would take the amount of bus fare any other player in the lower division took.\nHype Scoring Format.\nThe following scoring format was introduced in v21.10 and is the format currently being used.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nRankings.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

They are also the most efficient at enabling &lt;a href=\"AFK%20missions\"&gt;AFK missions&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Endurance\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Retrieve%20the%20Data\"&gt;Retrieve the Data&lt;/a&gt;, and are a must-have for any stationary-objective mission with the incredible &lt;a href=\"B.A.S.E.\"&gt;B.A.S.E.&lt;/a&gt; ability, that enhances structures to provide better protection, self-heal, and even deal damage to enemies.\nThere are plenty of Constructors to choose from, and a challenge for beginners to find the right loadout with there being a Commander slot and six other slots for you to fill. Constructors are a perfectly balanced, versatile and powerful class. Having a good one on your squad can make all the difference. Constructors can not only make missions easier by enabling the much-needed F.O.R.T. safety, but also make most of the annoying in-game modifiers easier to deal with.\nTypes=\nUnderstanding the Constructor Class.\nConstructors can be broadly categorized into three types:\n&lt;a href=\"Melee\"&gt;Melee&lt;/a&gt;-based Constructors are ones such as &lt;a href=\"Tank%20Penny\"&gt;Tank Penny&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Bull\"&gt;Guardian Bull&lt;/a&gt;, that utilize &lt;a href=\"hardware%20weapon\"&gt;hardware weapon&lt;/a&gt;s such as clubs and hammers to deal damage. &lt;a href=\"Ability\"&gt;Ability&lt;/a&gt;-based Constructors are a wider variety that involve Constructors improving damage or efficiency of a particular Ability, such as &lt;a href=\"Airheart\"&gt;Airheart&lt;/a&gt; that specialize in &lt;a href=\"R.O.S.I.E.\"&gt;R.O.S.I.E.&lt;/a&gt;\nWhile these two are fun to use, they are eclipsed by the build-based constructors, that are the real meta of Fortnite: Save the World. These are the Constructors that enhance builds via increased wall health, or a greater &lt;a href=\"B.A.S.E.\"&gt;B.A.S.E.&lt;/a&gt; range. These Constructors are the undisputed best Heroes in Save the World and are a essential in every squad for defense-based missions.\nMeta=\nA B.A.S.E. constructor loadout is the \"essential\": having one on your team protects against the most dangerous threats in the game and ensure a mission succeeds, whether its solo or team play. The discussion around the \"best builds\" revolves around what the \"other\" three players should play, because its just no question that one player should play support. Every player should invest in a good BASE loadout.\nMeta &lt;a href=\"B.A.S.E.\"&gt;B.A.S.E.&lt;/a&gt; Constructors in Fortnite: Save the World.\nHere are the Constructors and the Perk required for the best Loadouts in Fortnite:\nThese Heroes the ones that provide the best enhancements for structures, and will literally solo hard-carry the newbie team from Stonewood lvl-1 zones to endgame Twine Peaks lvl-160+ zones. The four essential Fortnite Constructor &lt;a href=\"B.A.S.E.\"&gt;B.A.S.E.&lt;/a&gt; Commander slot in Fortnite are:\nLoadouts=\nBest Constructor Frostnite, Survive the Horde and Defense Missions Loadouts.\nThis is the best &lt;a href=\"B.A.S.E.\"&gt;B.A.S.E.&lt;/a&gt; build loadouts for all &lt;a href=\"Defense%20Mission\"&gt;Defense Mission&lt;/a&gt;s (except Endurance, Storm Shields and Fight Category 4 Storm):\nB.A.S.E. Kyle, Power B.A.S.E. Knox, and Ice King are interchangeable and can be freely swapped, depending on personal preferences as Commander, mission requirements and other Party Members utlizing identical loadouts.\nBest Constructor Endurance, Storm Shields and Fight Category 4 Storm Loadouts.\nThis is the best &lt;a href=\"B.A.S.E.\"&gt;B.A.S.E.&lt;/a&gt; build loadouts for &lt;a href=\"Endurance\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Shields\"&gt;Storm Shields&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fight%20Category%204%20Storm\"&gt;Fight Category 4 Storm&lt;/a&gt;:\nThe major difference between the two builds is the B.A.S.E. range. The second loadout covers a greater range while sacrificing on some of the structure strength, while the first loadout covers a smaller range while packing on a lot of structure strength. In case of the second loadout, the build strength is worth sacrificing for the greater range, as it is more important to wall in the Storm Shield and protect all four Atlases than just one.\nIce King is another candidate for a Commander, but it is certainly not the best idea to lose the valuable structure strength provided by B.A.S.E. Kyle when slotted in the Commander Slot. Some people also prefer using the Recycling perk, but Supercharged Traps is highly recommended instead, since Recycling generates low amount of building material. The only place where Recycling is recommended is on Endurance AFK/&lt;a href=\"Jail%20Build\"&gt;Jail Build&lt;/a&gt;s, where trap damage is negligible, while trap endurance is recommended.\nEndnote=\nHow to make the most of your Constructor.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

GHOST is under the direct authority of Midas, the original founder and Brutus, Midas' right-hand man. During Chapter 2, they offered the services of their agents to various clients, notably the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; and were also sent on missions by Midas or Marigold, alongside SHADOW operatives. However they went to war against &lt;a href=\"SHADOW\"&gt;SHADOW&lt;/a&gt; following the conflicts between the A.L.T.E.R. and E.G.O. teams and rivalry.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Chapter%202%20Remix\"&gt;Chapter 2 Remix&lt;/a&gt;, they were contracted by &lt;a href=\"Snoop%27s%20Enterprise\"&gt;Snoop's Enterprise&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nGHOST is the second division of Midas' crew and was founded sometime after SHADOW under unspecified circumstances, and before the events of . The first group of GHOST agents, E.G.O, entered &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt; through a &lt;a href=\"Crash%20Site\"&gt;Plane&lt;/a&gt; that was sent by the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; having used their services to investigate in order to avoid revealing themselves. Their mission was to chart and analyse the &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;reconstructed map&lt;/a&gt;. GHOST later established itself on the island during along with the entire &lt;a href=\"Midas%27%20Crew\"&gt;Midas' Crew&lt;/a&gt;, but went to war with &lt;a href=\"SHADOW\"&gt;SHADOW&lt;/a&gt;, but lost. From until , GHOST was mostly inactive, with many of the offline agents acting independently outside the faction, offering their services to others.\nIn , &lt;a href=\"Marigold\"&gt;Marigold&lt;/a&gt; called back the entire Midas' crew after she found Midas, and both the major players of both SHADOW \"and\" GHOST reconciled their former grudges, reuniting the whole crew.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Chapter%202%20Remix\"&gt;Chapter 2 Remix&lt;/a&gt;, GHOST fully returned and were contracted by &lt;a href=\"Snoop%27s%20Enterprise\"&gt;Snoop's Enterprise&lt;/a&gt; along with SHADOW to protect their bases.\nMembers, Locations and Technology.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nTechnology.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nHistory.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nBefore Chapter 2.\n&lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt; founded &lt;a href=\"Midas%27%20Crew\"&gt;his crew&lt;/a&gt; at an unknown time in an unknown reality. Through his covert skills, he set his sights on building an empire of espionage, intrigue, and conquest. For this he recruited three people with great potential to his cause:\nTogether, they formed &lt;a href=\"The%20First%20Shadows\"&gt;The First Shadows&lt;/a&gt;: the very first agents of the newly formed faction named &lt;a href=\"SHADOW\"&gt;SHADOW&lt;/a&gt;. This marked the official beginning for the organization beyond Midas' personal conquest.\nAfter an unknown period of time, a new faction appeared in Midas' crew, named &lt;a href=\"GHOST\"&gt;GHOST&lt;/a&gt;, which quickly became rivals with SHADOW. The &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; recruits the services of GHOST to study and map Apollo. Unbeknownst to GHOST at the time, SHADOW had already begun engaging in various operations on &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;the island&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe E.G.O. team from GHOST and the A.L.T.E.R. team from SHADOW began entering into conflicts which triggered infighting among Midas' crew. A.L.T.E.R. agents started to oppose the members of E.G.O. and deliberately chased them down, with &lt;a href=\"Rippley%20vs%20Sludge\"&gt;Rippley&lt;/a&gt; being one of their main targets.\nLater in the season, &lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt; selects &lt;a href=\"Eye%20Land\"&gt;Eye Land&lt;/a&gt; as the new grounds for the main base of GHOST, likely aware of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; stationed underneath it. Simultaneously, construction on five SHADOW Safe Houses around the island begins.\n&lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt; founded &lt;a href=\"The%20Agency\"&gt;The Agency&lt;/a&gt;, his employment organization for spies from both the factions of GHOST \"and\" SHADOW. The organization has its headquarters of the same name built on &lt;a href=\"Eye%20Land\"&gt;Eye Land&lt;/a&gt;. Conflicts between SHADOW and GHOST escalate, and grow into an all-out Spy War.\nWith The Agency now built, and tension arisen between the two, the war between GHOST and SHADOW begins in full.\nWhile Meowscles controlled The Yacht for GHOST, there were three members of Midas' crew who had not yet chosen their allegiance and remained neutral at the beginning: Brutus, TNTina and Skye.\n&lt;br&gt;\nHowever, throughout the season, the balance of power between GHOST and SHADOW changed enormously:\nDuring the war, Midas gradually worked on a &lt;a href=\"Doomsday%20Device\"&gt;Doomsday Device&lt;/a&gt; with his daughter &lt;a href=\"Jules\"&gt;Jules&lt;/a&gt; made to break free from &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt;. This Device was located in his room, directly underneath The Agency, and possibly right above &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;. \nMidas' room housed several things that hinted at his involvement behind the scenes:\nNear the end of the season, &lt;a href=\"Renegade%20Shadow\"&gt;Renegade Shadow&lt;/a&gt; storms &lt;a href=\"The%20Agency\"&gt;The Agency&lt;/a&gt; for SHADOW's conquest. Countdowns for the activation of Midas' Device began appearing in the Agency and in Midas' own room.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Device%20%28event%29\"&gt;The Device&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Device was activated on June 15, 2020. Upon its initiation, Midas' voice and several other Henchmen voices could've been heard as it executed its functions to try and push &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt; back, destroying much of The Agency.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe Device's plan ultimately failed, and the Storm attacked The Device in retaliation, and turned into a giant &lt;a href=\"The%20Wall%20Of%20Water\"&gt;Wall of Water&lt;/a&gt;. \nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Live%20Events\"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;, Midas publicly reappears aligned with SHADOW, and controls what's left of The Agency for the now opposing faction - though he remains the de facto leader of GHOST.\nThe giant Wall of Water created by The Storm collapsed, flooding the entire Island. The headquarters of GHOST are now &lt;a href=\"The%20Fortilla\"&gt;The Fortilla&lt;/a&gt;, a floating island set made from trash positioned where The Rig once stood. Midas was attacked by a &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Shark\"&gt;Loot Shark&lt;/a&gt;.\nGHOST continues the war against SHADOW. They built &lt;a href=\"The%20Fortilla\"&gt;The Fortilla&lt;/a&gt; as their new headquarters. GHOST's operatives, such as &lt;a href=\"Ocean\"&gt;Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, refused to give up the fight against SHADOW, and tried to make a comeback after they lost The Agency, but the war is overall less aggressive.\nBoth &lt;a href=\"The%20Authority\"&gt;The Authority&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Fortilla\"&gt;The Fortilla&lt;/a&gt; have been completely abandoned, and the war between GHOST and SHADOW seems to have ended, with many members now working for themselves, waiting to return online again, pursuing other goals.\n\nGHOST, still inactive, is investigated by detective &lt;a href=\"Sleuth\"&gt;Sleuth&lt;/a&gt;, who seeks to hunt down all the agents of both SHADOW and &lt;a href=\"GHOST\"&gt;GHOST&lt;/a&gt;. Sleuth is ultimately unsuccessful. \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"Marigold\"&gt;Marigold&lt;/a&gt;, a member of Midas' crew, arrives on the island, and just like Midas, she is cursed with the Golden Touch. In her &lt;a href=\"Marigold%27s%20Quests\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt;, she mentions that someone was spending Midas' gold, and recruited the services of &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; for revenge.\n\n&lt;a href=\"Marigold\"&gt;Marigold&lt;/a&gt; along with several &lt;a href=\"GHOST\"&gt;GHOST&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"SHADOW\"&gt;SHADOW&lt;/a&gt; henchmen went to collect something.\nMarigold is in on a secret plan with Midas and Jules, as she looks for a getaway driver.\nFor &lt;a href=\"Cosmic%20Summer%20Celebration\"&gt;Cosmic Summer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Midsummer%20Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt; reappears with other agents of his crew, including &lt;a href=\"Beach%20Jules\"&gt;Jules&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beach%20Brutus\"&gt;Brutus&lt;/a&gt;, for an undercover mission.\nBecause of his loss of income, &lt;a href=\"Turk%20vs%20Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt; teamed up with his Alter-ego from long ago: &lt;a href=\"Turk%20vs%20Riptide\"&gt;Turk&lt;/a&gt;, to capture the &lt;a href=\"Coral%20Buddies\"&gt;Coral Buddies&lt;/a&gt; and sell them. This caused them to come into conflict with the people of &lt;a href=\"Atlantis\"&gt;Atlantis&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon finding clues as to the whereabouts of &lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marigold\"&gt;Marigold&lt;/a&gt; calls former agents and friends of his break him out of &lt;a href=\"The%20Underworld\"&gt;The Underworld&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jules\"&gt;Jules&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"TNTina\"&gt;TNTina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skye\"&gt;Skye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Meowscles\"&gt;Meowscles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brutus\"&gt;Brutus&lt;/a&gt; - the current leader of Midas' crew - reform &lt;a href=\"Midas%27%20Crew\"&gt;the old gang&lt;/a&gt; with the help of Marigold and her enlisted ally &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;, search for Midas' underworld cell, only to discover he had already broken free himself. With the forces of &lt;a href=\"The%20Society\"&gt;The Society&lt;/a&gt; dwindling, and the new back together, SHADOW Agents take back control over &lt;a href=\"The%20Marigold\"&gt;The Marigold&lt;/a&gt; as their ticket out, and the tentative new home base for Midas and his crew.\n&lt;br&gt;\nMidas sets his sights on escaping &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;the island&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"The%20Marigold\"&gt;The Marigold&lt;/a&gt;, wary of &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;' wrath and retaliation. Midas' goal is a fruitful voyage on his yacht to expand his empire somewhere else outside of the island for his mighty ambitions. While Brutus prepares The Marigold to leave with Midas, his top agents create distractions across Helios that allow his escape mission to succeed. Midas hides out on &lt;a href=\"Spawn%20Island\"&gt;Spawn Island&lt;/a&gt;, away from Hades, waiting for the plan to succeed.\n&lt;br&gt;\nFollowing the successful heist, &lt;a href=\"Midas%27%20Crew\"&gt;Midas' Crew&lt;/a&gt; all collectively set forth on their voyage into the ambitious unknown, and have - for the foreseeable future - left the world of . However, some operatives of &lt;a href=\"SHADOW\"&gt;SHADOW&lt;/a&gt; remain on the island, with assignable &lt;a href=\"SHADOW%20Briefings\"&gt;SHADOW Briefings&lt;/a&gt; continuing to be offered, even around newer locations as the chapter progresses.\nGHOST's primary Bases, &lt;a href=\"The%20Shark\"&gt;The Shark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Agency\"&gt;The Agency&lt;/a&gt;, were spray painted on &lt;a href=\"Restored%20Reels\"&gt;Restored Reels&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;. However, the spray paint has all of the GHOST logos painted over, with a SHADOW logo presented on the front of The Agency.\n&lt;a href=\"Chapter%202%20Remix\"&gt;Chapter 2 Remix&lt;/a&gt;.\nArriving in an of &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;, GHOST settled on the island and took back most of the bases they once had under their control, however there is some changes. GHOST's former HQ, The Agency, was transformed into &lt;a href=\"The%20Doggpound\"&gt;The Doggpound&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Snoop%20Dogg\"&gt;Snoop Dogg&lt;/a&gt; in that version of Apollo, however they later contracted GHOST to protect his location. &lt;a href=\"1-Ball\"&gt;1-Ball&lt;/a&gt;, a GHOST Agent meets up with his legend and fellow GHOST Agent, &lt;a href=\"8-Ball%20vs%20Scratch\"&gt;8-Ball&lt;/a&gt;, to test who truly is the best.. However, GHOST didn't regain the control of &lt;a href=\"The%20Yacht\"&gt;The Yacht&lt;/a&gt;, which was taken over by &lt;a href=\"Meowdas\"&gt;Meowdas&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"SHADOW%20Henchmen%20%28Remix%29\"&gt;SHADOW Henchmen&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Rap%20Boy%20Reloaded\"&gt;Eminem&lt;/a&gt; took control of The Grotto, turning it into &lt;a href=\"Spaghetti%20Grotto\"&gt;Spaghetti Grotto&lt;/a&gt;, he also contracted &lt;a href=\"GHOST%20Henchmen%20%28Remix%29\"&gt;GHOST Henchmen&lt;/a&gt; to protect it instead of &lt;a href=\"SHADOW%20Henchmen%20%28Remix%29\"&gt;SHADOW Henchmen&lt;/a&gt; like the original &lt;a href=\"The%20Grotto\"&gt;Grotto&lt;/a&gt;.

Although he is no longer directly involved in the game, his actions have had some significance, both negative and positive for seasons from to as well as during the Zero War.\nDescription.\nGalactus is a large humanoid creature, several times larger than the &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt; itself. In Marvel lore, he is a cosmic entity who consumes planets to sustain his life force, but in the Fortnite canon, was attracted to the Island after the events of the &lt;a href=\"The%20End\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt; live event. After noticing the massive shift in reality created by &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; and it's power, Galactus set off to harness its power for himself. Thor later arrives at the island, alongside other Marvel heroes, to stop Galactus before he consumed the Zero Point.\nHistory.\nAt Asgard, Thor is met by Galactus. Galactus warns him that the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Winter_%28Multiverse%29\"&gt;Black Winter&lt;/a&gt; is coming, which will destroy everything in its path. Thor agrees and becomes the Herald of Thunder. As they search for 5 Barren Planets that Galactus must consume to stop the winter, a Rift appears, leading a path to The Zero Point. Galactus heads towards the portal, but Thor rushes into the rift to warn the people of Apollo.\nGalactus first made his appearance early in the season, only appearing as a faint red dot in the sky, much like a star. As the season continued, the dot became brighter. Later in the Season, Galactus was visible in the sky as a distant model. As the weeks went on, his model became larger as he came closer to the island with his eyes glowing a bright red. Within the last few weeks of the season, Galactus disappeared from the sky, and began to rise out of the water each day. The day before the live event, his head was fully visible in the waters far west of the island.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer%20of%20Worlds\"&gt;The Devourer of Worlds&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the live event, Galactus became active, and slowly walked closer to the island, increasing in size. He then shouted: \"Beware...I Hunger!!!!\" before hitting &lt;a href=\"Helicarrier%2064\"&gt;Helicarrier 64&lt;/a&gt; out of the sky and into the water. Afterwards, he then began to absorb the &lt;a href=\"Zero%20Point\"&gt;Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; until a full reality collapse occurred. Aided by &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Man%20Zero\"&gt;Iron Man&lt;/a&gt;, the player was put into an Upgraded Battle Bus as Galactus sent out &lt;a href=\"Gorgers\"&gt;Gorgers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gatherers\"&gt;Gatherers&lt;/a&gt; to attack the player. After being forced to consume all the Upgraded Battle Buses, he said, \"No! This is not possible!\" before being &lt;a href=\"Rift\"&gt;rifted&lt;/a&gt; back to where he came. After this, he was not seen again, but the Zero Point was left exposed.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer%20of%20Worlds\"&gt;The Devourer of Worlds&lt;/a&gt; event is seen in a flashback in the comic.\nGalactus' damaged helmet can be found in the ocean near &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt; island.
