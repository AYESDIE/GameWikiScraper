How're you?\"\nWe're not running for cover. We're not hiding under a rock.\n(laugh) I gotta say, I am proud of this little island. \nAnd they're saying... honestly, uh, nothing. But the party is just getting started!\n&lt;hr&gt;\nMARI: We're storming the sandcastles and taking it to the beach, baby!\nAnd now... I'm gonna... take a nap. Mmm.\nIt's like our minds have been... (mimics head explosion) opened!\nI was maybe in the sun a lot and not hydrating and... yeah...\nI was there last night. It's like a whole movement sprung up out of nothing!\nLove you, my Saucer Hotties. (yawning) So much.\nMaybe we shouldn't be planning to fight these visitors!\nMaybe we should be saying, \"What's ours is yours!\"\nOr like, \"Take us to YOUR leader,\" huh?\nYeah, I- I gotta sit down now. \n&lt;hr&gt;\nMARI: So. Uh.\nYou ever seen someone, like... unzip themselves, and uh...\nYou know...\nBe an alien?\nI, uh- you know, I'm not trying to be an alarmist but that's not the Believer Beach vibe I was hoping for. \n&lt;hr&gt;\nMARI: Can we work together to keep our beloved beach clean?\nI've been out there enjoying the sand and surf, and... well...\nLet's keep &lt;a href=\"Believer%20Beach\"&gt;Believer Beach&lt;/a&gt;... beautiful.\nSome litterbug keeps scattering alien tech all over the place!\nThat's what the garbage cans are for!\nThe ground isn't a garbage can, people!\n&lt;hr&gt;\nMARI: I am loving the chill vibes on the beach today.\nDid anyone catch those cool sand sculptures?\nHow could they NOT come in peace?!\nI was pretty moved. \nThe circles... the, the... the blobs! So organic and raw.\nAh! These alien visitors, wow! Some of them have a real eye for fine art.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nMARI: (out of breath) Whew... Okay, my Saucers!\nOr, uhhhh, dimension?\nI spent all night blowing up some big bouncy water floaties for our guests.\nIt'd be a great opportunity to make a friend.\nMaybe even a friend from another galaxy!\nSpace-time... pocket? \nThey're in the water now if you wanna hop on over and check 'em out.\nUse the buddy system.\nYou know what I mean.\nYou'll get some real air, so be careful!\n&lt;hr&gt;\nMARI: Okay, y'all. I have to admit... the big &lt;a href=\"The%20Mothership\"&gt;mothership&lt;/a&gt; floating over the Island? Freaky.\nDon't get me wrong. It looks cool...\nBut I swear I saw someone... GET SUCKED UP INTO IT.\n(forced laugh) Right?\nMaybe I'm seeing things...\nOr maybe they were just visiting, and that is how their front door works! \n...Right?\n&lt;hr&gt;\nMARI: Yooo! I drove a saucer yesterday!\nI mean, we all do it to the cars on the Island all the time anyway.\nI'm not saying you should try it, but if you do...\nMaybe it's the aliens' way of teaching us about their technology.\nSo I just... hopped in!\nThe keys were in the ignition, and nobody was around...\n&lt;hr&gt;\nMARI: I wanna shout out one of the Saucers I met on the beach yesterday!\nFrom what you say, they sound like real party people!\nIt was really chill!\n..Like, a LOT... about the aliens\nWe danced, played a little volleyball, talked a lot about the aliens...\nSo, &lt;a href=\"Sunny\"&gt;Sunny&lt;/a&gt;, if you are out there, thanks for being a listener.\nAnd for filling me in on our new alien friends.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nMARI: Saucers!

Any of y'all been feeling strange lately?\nOne of my &lt;a href=\"Trespassers\"&gt;beach buddies&lt;/a&gt;... they don't seem to be entirely themselves these days.\nI'm sure it's nothing, but... keep an eye out for your friends, okay?\n&lt;hr&gt;\nMARI: Eyes on the sky, people! Something's moving up there!\nIt looks like... &lt;a href=\"Abductors\"&gt;landing ships.&lt;/a&gt; And they're definitely hovering above the Island.\nI'd take cover 'til we can find out more.\nBut you... you're an adventurer, so do your thing under that UFO sky!\n&lt;hr&gt;\nMARI: You ever wish you could see the farthest reaches of the galaxy?\nObviously, I'm kidding!

I'd love to hear your story.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nMARI: So many Saucers are calling in with their abduction stories!\nPeople are saying they're held in some kind of... enclosure...\nAnd they had to fight their way out!\nWhich is not ideal for a radio show.\nIf you have any other details, I'd really like to hear from you.\nBecause right now it's being described as... indescribable.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

An area on the Map can be marked by pressing the Primary Fire button, or by pressing Mouse 3 (PC) , or Left D Pad (Console) by default. This will show a marker for the selected location for the entire squad.\nMarking can also be used to highlight danger or enemies. This is achieved by pressing the mark button twice in quick succession, and with default settings, holding the aim button, and marking normally (this can be turned off).\nFinally, regular marking via the mark button will highlight Items, interactable objects (such as Keycard Locks), &lt;a href=\"Animals\"&gt;Wildlife&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vehicles%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;Vehicles&lt;/a&gt; for the entire squad. Marking an item displays its rarity, as well as an icon of the item.\nPlacing a regular marker shows a light beam in the sky. This can be seen across the map and will fade as the player gets closer. Markers will disappear after a decent amount of time, and have a short cooldown before using them repeatedly. Players can mark whilst knocked, and place map markers whilst eliminated. Markers and danger markers will also display on the compass, but item marks will not.\nA player's mark will match their associated color in team game modes. It is not known how the player order is assigned, but this is how it goes:\nMarkable Objects.\nThe following is a list of items and objects that can be marked by the player:\nA majority of placed items do not have the associated rarity when marked, as many will display as . This includes items such as the &lt;a href=\"Launch%20Pad\"&gt;Launch Pad&lt;/a&gt; which is and the Shield Keg which is , both of which display as when marked."}

There are three materials in the game, and they were added on launch of the mode, in the &lt;a href=\"Pre-Season\"&gt;Pre-Season&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaterial Types.\nThere are three Material types in Battle Royale. Wood, Stone and Metal. Each one has its own benefits and drawbacks, as well as strength and build time.\nAll three resources are located as drops from &lt;a href=\"Containers\"&gt;Chests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Supply%20Drop%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;Supply Drops&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Supply%20Llama\"&gt;Supply Llamas&lt;/a&gt;, among other methods.\nWood.\nWood is the weakest resource, but the fastest to construct. Wood can be found in objects such as:\nWood is flammable, and will ignite with &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;.\nStone.\nStone is the middle ground for HP and build time. Stone can most commonly be harvested from these objects:\nStone is not flammable, but will be damaged by nearby flames.\nMetal.\nMetal is the strongest material, but takes the longest to build. Metal can most commonly be harvested from these objects:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Port-A-Fort\"&gt;Port-A-Fort&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Port-A-Fortress\"&gt;Port-A-Fortress&lt;/a&gt; will produce structures made of metal."}

Players can break and or search world objects such as trees, bushes, rocks, houses, containers, chests, toolboxes and more in the world to obtain materials which they can therefore build structures using wood, brick and or metal. Breaking and or searching world resources will give players crafting ingredients which can be used to make &lt;a href=\"Weaponry%20%28Save%20the%20World%29\"&gt;Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Traps\"&gt;Traps&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ammunition\"&gt;Ammunition&lt;/a&gt; in Save the World.\nWorld Resources.\nHarvesting items and objects with a &lt;a href=\"Harvesting%20Tool\"&gt;Harvesting Tool&lt;/a&gt; yields a different amount of World Resources, depending on the object that was destroyed.\nWood.\nWood is the weakest of the three materials, but the easiest to find.

Metal can most commonly be located in &lt;a href=\"The%20Industrial%20Park\"&gt;The Industrial Park&lt;/a&gt;. Objects that you will want to harvest/search are:\nFully harvesting the objects above often grants &lt;a href=\"Nuts%20%27n%27%20Bolts\"&gt;Nuts 'n' Bolts&lt;/a&gt; and Mechanical Parts crafting resources. &lt;a href=\"Batteries\"&gt;Batteries&lt;/a&gt; can also be obtained.

Firstly, it can be thrown to deal damage to both players and structures. The shield is thrown using the alternate fire button, and upon being thrown, it inflicts 50 damage to players and 100 damage to structures. After hitting a target, the shield returns to the player. If the shield collides with an object or wall, it will rebound and continue to deal damage to opponents during this phase. The time it takes for the shield to return increases with the distance of the throw.\nSecondly, the shield can be used defensively to block incoming damage, effectively negating attacks aimed at the player. Sprinting while the shield is equipped will perform a bash attack dealing 50 damage. The damage per second (DPS) of the shield is not consistent, as it is dependent on the range over which the shield is thrown. This dual capability makes Captain America's Shield a versatile asset for both attacking and defending in the game. Captain America's Shield is a Projectile weapon, with no damage drop off.\nStats.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nSounds.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nWeapon ID.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nCaptain America's Shield is referred to as Ashton Pack Chicago in the files.\nCaptain America's Shield is referred to as Ashton Shield in the files.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nNews Tab.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nFormer Icons.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

They were introduced in .\nFunctionality and Classification.\nCars are land vehicles, which can ferry players from one location to another. All cars have a driver seat, and 1 to 7 more individual seats for any players. Players can also ride atop Cars without falling off of them. Cars require fuel to function, and will spawn with fuel that can be replenished with a &lt;a href=\"Gas%20Can\"&gt;Gas Can&lt;/a&gt; or a pump from a &lt;a href=\"Gas%20Station\"&gt;Gas Station&lt;/a&gt;. When a car runs out of fuel, it will slowly come to a halt. Like most vehicles, the driver of a car cannot use weapons or build, but passengers can. Cars will deal damage to players if they are rammed by one at a high speed. This will also knock them high into the air and take any fall damage.\nCars have varying pools of health, and will explode into a flaming chassis on destruction, which causes &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; to spread. Cars can only be healed with a &lt;a href=\"Campfire\"&gt;Campfire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Repair%20Torch\"&gt;Repair torch&lt;/a&gt;, Service Station or by driving into a Slurp Cactus. When a tire on a car is destroyed, it will lose some control and take 1 damage per second for each lost tire. Tires can be repaired with , &lt;a href=\"https%3A//fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle_Modification\"&gt;Bulletproof Tires&lt;/a&gt; or a Service Station. \nCars range in speed, with some more suited to driving on roads, and others with no differences between on road and offroad driving. Cars will float on water but will sink if they remain on it for too long. If a car flips over, it can be flipped with the interact key. Cars can also be harvested for Metal at a rate of 2 per swing.\nAll cars have access to &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations\"&gt;Radio Stations&lt;/a&gt; and a Horn, the latter of which is activated by pressing the aim button.\nSome cars are 'Booted', meaning they will not be able to be driven. This is indicated by the yellow boot on one of the wheels, and a lack of an ability to enter them. There is no way to un-boot a car.\nIntroduced with , vehicles can be upgraded with extensive &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Modification\"&gt;modifications&lt;/a&gt;. Modifications can be applied to three areas on each vehicle; the tires, bumper and roof, and each area has two available modifications- and Bulletproof Tires, Spiked Bumper and , and Machine-Gun Turret and Grenade Launcher Turret. These modifications can be applied to either of the two regular cars currently in the game (&lt;a href=\"Victory%20Motors%20Whiplash\"&gt;Whiplash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grandeur%20Trailsmasher\"&gt;Grandeur Trailsmasher&lt;/a&gt;), but not to any of the &lt;a href=\"Wasteland%20Warriors\"&gt;Wasteland Warrior&lt;/a&gt;'s cars, or vehicles of any other kind. The only exceptions to this are the Cow Catcher and Off-Road tires, which can be fitted to most regular cars.\nTypes of Cars.\nThere are fourteen main car types in game, each of which have different stats, function and visuals. See their individual pages to find out about each car.\nStrategies.\nCars are useful for combat because of their tolerance to damage, abilities to go through players and builds without losing momentum, and their speed. You can deal quick damage to an enemy by running them over with a car. Boss cars are particularly useful for this, as they can gain great speed and often have prefixed &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Modification\"&gt;mods&lt;/a&gt; such as . Additionally, you can add modifications to your car which can be used for defense or attack, e.g. the machinegun turret can shoot down opponents quickly. You can also have a quick getaway from the player as they will often try to chase you and destroy your car after an attack. Some cars such as the Lockjaws or the Octane can kill an enemy in one or two instances of hitting them. \nIf you want to kill an enemy after running them over, you can wait for them to fall down onto the ground after you hit them, allowing you to spray them with an &lt;a href=\"SMG\"&gt;SMG&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Weapons\"&gt;AR&lt;/a&gt; and hit them with a &lt;a href=\"Shotguns\"&gt;shotgun.&lt;/a&gt; You can often easily kill them without taking much damage, if any at all, as they would be confused after being flung into the air out of nowhere.\nCars are one of the best mobility items in the game, as they provide protection and high speeds. You can fix Off-Road Tires to make the car do better on rough terrain, allowing for more convenient movement. If you need to escape a situation, a car is often the best way to do it, as they are quite common and allow you to enter at the press of a button. It is recommended to learn about the cars in the current meta in order to be able to play better and understand which cars to drive rather than others, and which vehicle mods to use.\nOn the other side of the equation, you have players trying to handle other players with cars. Weapons like Boom Bolts and Magneto Power are great ways to damage or decelerate cars and other vehicles. In a match with lots of cars, make sure to have a high DPS weapon or one that can handle cars well. Additionally, some snipers deal heavily increased damage to cars, such as the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Impact%20Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Heavy Impact Sniper.&lt;/a&gt; "}

They were introduced in &lt;a href=\"Update%20v28.01\"&gt;v28.01&lt;/a&gt;.\nCars can be customised by the player. Players can customize the &lt;a href=\"Car%20Bodies\"&gt;Car Body&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Decals\"&gt;Decal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wheels\"&gt;Wheels&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Trails\"&gt;Trail&lt;/a&gt;. The cosmetics previously mentioned can be purchasd through the &lt;a href=\"Item%20Shop\"&gt;Item Shop&lt;/a&gt; or obtained through &lt;a href=\"Quests\"&gt;Quests&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbilities.\nDrifting.\nDrifting is done by making a tight turn, which charges up a speed boost. The longer the drift, the longer the boost after straightening out. A Rocket Drift can be activated by drifting while holding the Rocket Drift button to make even sharper turns and provide an even larger boost.\nJumping and Flying.\nVarious tracks have hazards which slow a player's speed if they hit them. These can be avoid by jumping, or holding down the jump button to fly. Players have a limited charge of jets so can only hold the jump button for a limited time. Tapping the jump button in short bursts allow a player to fly farther, or touching the ground can recharge their jets entirely.\nTurbo.\nAll cars have a Turbo meter that holds up to three charges. The meter refills over time, accelerated by drifting. Using a charge dramatically increases the car's speed. The player is prompted to press the Turbo button again shortly after using it to prolong their speed boost. Saving three charges and then using them in succession can allow players to achieve victory after being stuck in the middle.\nAir Dodging.\nCars can also attach to walls or ceilings while airborne if players indicate a direction while pressing the air dodge button. This can prove useful in avoiding various hazards."}

She can be found within the Spirit Realm's Portal, murmuring: \"\"&lt;a href=\"Zero%20Point\"&gt;The shard...the shard...&lt;/a&gt;\"\"\nIt's later revealed that one of her brothers, &lt;a href=\"Daigo\"&gt;Daigo&lt;/a&gt;, had given her a mask intended to protect her \"(see her Mask of Power style)\" after she'd gotten herself cursed by &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Warriors\"&gt;the demons&lt;/a&gt; - though it appears to have only worsened her situation, sufficiently amplifying her curse to allow her entrance into the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Realm\"&gt;Spirit Realm&lt;/a&gt;, but evidently not enough for her exit.\nReferences.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Firing the Batman Grapnel Gun launches out a plunger, and if this plunger connects with a surface, the player will be pulled upwards and towards it. This can be used to gain vertical and horizontal distance very quickly. It does not negate fall damage, but does reset the player's height to calculate it.\nThe difference between the &lt;a href=\"Grappler\"&gt;Grappler&lt;/a&gt; and the Batman Grapnel Gun, is that using the latter allows the player to redeploy their &lt;a href=\"Gliders\"&gt;Glider&lt;/a&gt; upon gaining enough height.

He gets attacked by other players but defeats them. Batman then finds Catwoman, and they recognize each other through their feelings although losing their memory. He and Catwoman work together to defeat the other combatants. They fight their way out until only him and Catwoman are left. They end their first &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;Loop&lt;/a&gt; together, inside &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt; by slowly dying.\nBatman continues to stay in the Loop, living the same nightmare over and over again. He upgrades his suit and leaves notes for himself to remember who he is and even builds a &lt;a href=\"Bat%20Shack\"&gt;shack&lt;/a&gt; to store his findings. He meets with Catwoman once again, and they search for ways to get out of &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;the island&lt;/a&gt;. They meet &lt;a href=\"Rebirth%20Harley%20Quinn\"&gt;Harley Quinn&lt;/a&gt;, who has joined into the chaos without thinking. They leave her, and figure out that staying at the Eye of &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt; can make one leave the Loop. Batman sacrifices himself for Catwoman to escape, and he stays in the Loop.\nBatman continues his attempts to escape, getting closer every turn. The &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; gets worried of him escaping before they intended, thus they send in &lt;a href=\"Snake%20Eyes\"&gt;Snake Eyes&lt;/a&gt; to distract him. An emotion of \"respect\" form among them that carries into each Loop. Eventually, Batman saves Snake Eyes from dying, so Snake Eyes sacrifices himself for Batman to leave the Loop. \nBatman opens his eyes, seeing &lt;a href=\"Deathstroke%20Zero\"&gt;Deathstroke&lt;/a&gt; holding Catwoman hostage.\nBatman and Catwoman beat Deathstroke and they come across a team of Loopers Deathstroke works with. They introduce each other and Batman asks &lt;a href=\"Renegade%20Raider\"&gt;Raider&lt;/a&gt; if she knows anything about the Island, being the longest standing Looper in the island. The team collects artifacts and signal from &lt;a href=\"The%20Spire\"&gt;The Spire&lt;/a&gt; that opens up an &lt;a href=\"IO%20Hatches\"&gt;Secret Hatch&lt;/a&gt;.

Deathstroke reveals himself as the traitor, and tries to kill the group but fails and is tied up by Catwoman. After everyone leaves, Deathstroke escapes his trap and gets away using a &lt;a href=\"Portal%20Device\"&gt;Portal Device&lt;/a&gt;, leaving Batman and Catwoman alone.\nBatman and Catwoman return to the surface to find someone to hold Deathstroke's staff that powered the panel they used. They find and knock Harley Quinn but come across &lt;a href=\"Snapshots\"&gt;Snapshots&lt;/a&gt; of themselves. They return to The Bridge and Harley Quinn escapes, running back to the Island. They return home and shortly remember everything from their complicated past. Catwoman runs away, leaving Batman on top of a building.\nDesigns.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

It has a specific path, which is randomized each game, that it follows over the Island to let players exit and land. This path is always a straight line. When the Battle Bus' doors open and players are able to jump out, its horn sounds. Once the Battle Bus has reached the end of its path, players who haven\u2019t exited the Battle Bus will be immediately dropped from it. \nBy pressing the emote button before exiting the Battle Bus players can thank the bus driver with message appearing in the Elimination Feed \"[Player Name] has thanked the bus driver.\"\nAppearance.\nThe default Battle Bus combines a blue-painted school bus with a large hot air balloon, which inflates with a blue flame to allow the vehicle to fly. Wheel clamps on the bus' back tires render it immobile on the ground.\nIt is very similar to &lt;a href=\"Ride%20the%20Lightning\"&gt;Lars' Van&lt;/a&gt; in , and even includes a &lt;a href=\"BluGlo\"&gt;BluGlo&lt;/a&gt; funnel on the front.\nIn Chapter 4, the Battle Bus was equipped with rocket engines in order to be able to fly through space. Upon reaching the boundaries of the Island, the engines shut down, the boosters were jettisoned and the hot air balloon inflated.\nBattle Bus Variations.\nThe Battle Bus has had many visual variations throughout 's lifetime:\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nBirthday.\nFor each of ]]'s Birthdays, the Battle Bus earns a decorated appearance featuring confetti, balloons and the number of its birthday:\nOther.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nOther.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

It is the successor to &lt;a href=\"Playground\"&gt;Playground&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen launched, Battle Lab could have been selected, but launching it would crash the game. This was because the spawn locations were still from &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; island instead of &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;. This was quickly fixed, with new spawn points added.\nBattle Lab was removed at the start of Chapter 4: Season 1 as players can use to create a similar experience using Battle Royale island, but also to make way for &lt;a href=\"Unreal%20Editor\"&gt;Unreal Editor&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay.\nIn this Game Mode, players can freely explore the current Battle Royale island for 24 hours per game session. After that time, &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt; begins to close in completely. There are items exclusive to this game mode, called \"Friendly Bot Grenades\" and \"Enemy Bot Grenades\". These grenades will spawn as &lt;a href=\"Bots\"&gt;Bots&lt;/a&gt;, that are either teammates or opponents. All &lt;a href=\"Containers\"&gt;Chests and Ammo Boxes&lt;/a&gt; have a 100% spawn rate. There are also almost approximately 100 &lt;a href=\"Supply%20Llama\"&gt;Loot Llamas&lt;/a&gt; per game.\nPlayers can create a private Battle Lab or matchmake with 15 other public players.\nRespawning is enabled in Battle Lab, should a player be eliminated. \nThis was the only gamemode besides to have weapons that are not not in , with Battle Lab having the &lt;a href=\"Rarity\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Rifle\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt;. \nLoot Pool.\nFriendly/Enemy Bot Grenades.\n\"Main Article\": &lt;a href=\"Bot%20Grenades\"&gt;Bot Grenades&lt;/a&gt;\nEnemy bot grenades will spawn in an opponent when thrown.

Friendly bot grenades have the same function, except they will not attack you, as they are on the same team as you.\nUnavailable Items.\nThese items are not available in Battle Lab regardless of loot pool selection, but is available in core Battle Royale playlists.\nAvailable Items.\nLeaving the playlist as Default, will spawn the default weaponry and items for the season.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nHigh Explosives.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

She remarks that, despite the boredom, it's a great time to be in the dust market, sharing how she recently found NM7-rated pre-apocalypse pollen worth one-thousandth of a &lt;a href=\"V-Bucks\"&gt;V-Buck&lt;/a&gt;, which she claims justifies her existence and fills her with purpose, though she seems sad as she insists she's \"very happy.\"\nAs the sentry bot departs, &lt;a href=\"Ray\"&gt;Ray&lt;/a&gt; notes how it seems to have somewhere important to be and wistfully comments on how nice that must be. She then reflects on how her friends are all busy; &lt;a href=\"Dennis\"&gt;Dennis&lt;/a&gt; rescuing survivors, &lt;a href=\"Director%20Riggs\"&gt;Riggs&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Shield%20Defense\"&gt;storm shield mission&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lars\"&gt;Lars&lt;/a&gt; in his &lt;a href=\"Ride%20the%20Lightning\"&gt;van&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lok\"&gt;Lok&lt;/a&gt; away at boarding school, leaving her feeling more alone than ever. She gets emotional and asks the Commander if they can hang out.\nRay reminisces about solving problems with film festivals and decides to collect movies to combat boredom and loneliness. However, each movie she considers ends up frustrating or saddening her due to its themes. \"Hero's Glory\" is dismissed because she's already surrounded by heroic acts in real life. \"Hindsight,\" a story about an elderly woman reflecting on her thrilling past, feels irrelevant to someone currently struggling. \"The Marathon\" annoys her with its focus on friendship, teamwork, and romance, though she jokingly considers only watching the lonely first act. Finally, \"The Call of Adventure,\" centered on finding meaning and friendship, irritates her further, as she critiques screenwriters for oversimplifying the journey of self-discovery, lamenting how some people aren't built for adventure.\n Not all of us are mindless battle drones ready to rush out into the world with our legs and arms that go in the right place and easily replaceable heads. Oh my god. \nAfter realisation hits her and she gets an idea, she disassembles the sentry bot off-screen and builds herself &lt;a href=\"Robo-Ray%20%28Hero%29\"&gt;a new body with limbs&lt;/a&gt; before setting off. She is then revealed to have climbed up on a tree and having gotten stuck in it, before falling asleep. Ray had left pre-recorded messages, which the Commander listens to. She asks the Commander to deactivate surveillance cameras that have recorded her clumsy attempts at skipping, walking, sitting, and dancing.\nRay is about to destroy all the evidence when she realises that this was supposed to be an adventure and a new challenge, even though she had no idea how awkward it is to be a person in the world. She decides to embrace it all, even if she embarrasses herself, and makes a promise to dive in headfirst. She then gives a heartfelt shout-out to the Commander, recognizing how they face each day, no matter how weird or imperfect it may be. Ray admires the Commander's ability to dance, sing, eat, love, and even kiss, despite the dangers and messiness of life. She then asks for permission to join the fight, explaining that it's going to be messy, but she's ready to do her part and wants to go on her first mission.\n&lt;a href=\"Robo-Ray%20%28Hero%29\"&gt;Ray-Bot&lt;/a&gt; and the Commander set out to eliminate &lt;a href=\"Monsters%20%28Save%20the%20World%29\"&gt;Husks&lt;/a&gt;. After the mission, Ray checks in with the Commander after reviewing her performance in the field. She admits it didn't go well and that she broke every health and safety rule she's ever set, including challenging a &lt;a href=\"Smasher\"&gt;Smasher&lt;/a&gt; to a dance-off, though the Smasher didn't exactly want to participate. She also mentions swallowing some &lt;a href=\"BluGlo\"&gt;BluGlo&lt;/a&gt;, though she's not sure why she did it. Despite the chaos, Ray reflects on how nice it felt to contribute and realizes she's been so focused on the end of the world that she's forgotten about new beginnings. She embraces the messiness of life, deciding it's not about perfection, but just pushing forward and seeing where it takes her."}

As stated in their name, these locations have names - that are often alliterative (two words in which the starting letter in each word is the same, such as Retail Row) - which are also seen labelled on the map.They are quite large in size - often resembling towns and cities, and because of this, many &lt;a href=\"Chest\"&gt;Chest&lt;/a&gt;s can be found in these locations to give good loot.\nLandmarks.\nLandmarks are smaller versions of named locations that still have names, but are not labelled on the map. Their names are only seen on the screen when entering the area. Like named locations, most Landmarks have alliterative names.\nThey still have moderately good perks, and are the most common type of location.\nUnnamed Locations.\nUnnamed Locations are locations, similar to &lt;a href=\"Landmarks\"&gt;Landmarks&lt;/a&gt; but without official names.

In addition, their name could have been as simple as &lt;a href=\"Volcano\"&gt;Volcano&lt;/a&gt;.As &lt;a href=\"Landmarks\"&gt;Landmarks&lt;/a&gt; were only added in Chapter 2, they are considered as the replacement for Unnamed Locations. However, some notable locations without names have still existed in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3."}

As he starts fixing the Zero Point, reality starts breaking apart and portals appear (Although. &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; states they are not portals).\nJones starts to close the portals, and succeeds in closing one - This causes a flower blossom to appear in the sky. The Foundation warns them to watch out for Reality Waves. Jones states \"Reality waves can change anything in a blink-\" but is cut off as one occurs. This changes Jones into a &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Butterfly\"&gt;Rift Butterfly&lt;/a&gt; and the player turns into &lt;a href=\"Raz\"&gt;Glyph Master Raz&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Looper is told to use Jones' &lt;a href=\"Portal%20Device\"&gt;Portal device&lt;/a&gt; to close all the portals. After closing the next one, they face the problem that the other portals are too far away. Luckily for them though, Jones can teleport them to each one.\nAs the player/looper and &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt; teleport and close each portal, reality waves and events occur along the way. These being:\nWith the last portal closed, it looks to be completed as a giant flower blossom fills the sky once more and The Zero point begins to close and seal. The colors surrounding it are intense. But suddenly, the blossom starts swelling and turning red and black. The Zero point also separates again with it.\nThe Foundation states it's not enough to completely fix it, and is left with one last option. he needs to contain the blast to prevent reality from ending, so he forms a tower of stone leading up to the Zero Point.\nJones teleports the looper and himself to the bottom of this forming tower. They run up the side of it as crystals and rocks come out the ground. They then fly up to a staircase along the tower, and run towards the top.\nAs you reach the top, the butterfly Jones turns back to his normal self. The looper is blasted off the platform to fly and watch as a bystander. &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; says there'll be no other chance, and that Jones needs to overload the Device to seal off the Zero Point.\nJones objects saying \"Overload the device?! I'll be trapped in the loop!\" The Foundation states they'll both have to fight their way back, and that they should not give up. He also says that he will find Jones and that he should tell him everything. Jones says \"You have my word!\" and overloads the device.\nThis seals The Foundation in, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Spire\"&gt;The Spire&lt;/a&gt; is complete. Thus trapping Jones in &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;the loop&lt;/a&gt; for a while.\nAudio.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

He begins by taking out The Society for their opening of the box and their use of their medallions. Zeus' plan is to recruit the other gods to his side for the extermination of mortalkind. \nMeanwhile, some of the gods express that they do not share his ideals and stand up to him, such as his own daughter &lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;, who opposes him in everything. The Looper is recruited by &lt;a href=\"The%20Oracle\"&gt;The Oracle&lt;/a&gt; as mortalkinds hero to unite the immortals against Zeus. After &lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt; and his son &lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt; got defeated by &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; and Zeus heard of &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;'s works from &lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;, the king of gods became mad and wrote on stone edicts sent to Olympians his intention to destroy &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; as well as his plan to recruit allies.\nAphrodite later calls &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; to join their side against Zeus. The Oracle, discovering that Zeus wishes to recruit Artemis, sends the Looper to get Artemis' attention before Zeus' words do. As his daughter &lt;a href=\"Artemis%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt; considers this hunt for mortals immoral, she accepts to join The Looper. &lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;, who assisted the Looper in cheering Aphrodite up also disagrees with Zeus, and likewise &lt;a href=\"Apollo%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; himself, who tells his sister, Aphrodite, that the mortals deserve protection and expressed his support to her.\nLater, Zeus sends Cerberus to investigate &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;'s actions, but &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;'s beloved dog chooses not to obey his order if The Looper helps him find an artifact that &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; secretly hid away for safekeeping during Zeus' tempest. Zeus' demigod son, &lt;a href=\"Perseus\"&gt;Perseus&lt;/a&gt;, also declared support for mortals, siding with &lt;a href=\"Medusa\"&gt;Medusa&lt;/a&gt;.\nMedusa calls upon &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;, wanting to take back her property that Zeus stole from her a long time ago. While searching, they find an hourglass that was created by Hephaestus. The Oracle tells The Looper that Olympians immortality isn't absolute and that the Stormforged Hourglass is his source, and that it can be destroyed. After destroying all the cracking Hourglasses, Medusa then explains that they were crafted with Zeus's own godly essence to increase his power and by destroying them, it weakened the god. With Zeus's godly essence that was inside the hourglasses, she crafted a charm that she gave to The Looper to empower them, before sending them destroy Zeus's Stormforged Hourglass, making him mortal and then confronting the king of gods in a death match that the god ultimately lost.\nDethroning the god, The Looper decided to spare Zeus's life, even though Zeus was seriously injured, and then allowed &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; to tag the logo of &lt;a href=\"The%20Underground\"&gt;The Underground&lt;/a&gt; on Zeus's former throne, to declare a new reign of freedom for &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Mount Olympus&lt;/a&gt; and the Island. However, &lt;a href=\"Triage%20Trooper\"&gt;Triage Trooper&lt;/a&gt; found Zeus, and decided to save him. \n&lt;a href=\"Sandstorm%20Event\"&gt;Sandstorm Event&lt;/a&gt;.\nZeus, wanting revenge imbued the statue of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Mount Olympus&lt;/a&gt; with his power and used it to unleash some power from the &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt;, which generated a sandstorm and attracted&lt;a href=\"Megalo%20Don\"&gt;Megalo Don&lt;/a&gt; and his crew as well as &lt;a href=\"The%20Wanderer\"&gt;The Wanderer&lt;/a&gt; on the Island.\nMost of &lt;a href=\"The%20Pantheon\"&gt;The Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; were banished from the Island.\nReferences.\n=Audio=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

They were introduced in &lt;a href=\"Season%207\"&gt;Season 7&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nZiplines are a method of transportation which lets the player travel along a predetermined path. The player can move in either direction on a zipline, as well as shoot, use items and even build (building is only limited to around where the zipline is placed). Players cannot stay still on a zipline and will continuously move.\nPlayers attach to a zipline using the interact button, and can dismount one by pressing the jump button. Ziplines will negate fall damage, and once the player touches the floor this protection is removed. If the player initiates a zipline when a structure is in the way, the zipline will destroy it in order to create a clear path. Players can perform emotes on a zipline, if they interact with one whilst the emote plays; they cannot emote whilst already on a zipline. Vertical ziplines have the same properties, but will move the player vertically rather than horizontally.\nAs of Chapter 2: Season 6, some ziplines will move according to gravity, and will bend and curve downwards with the player's weight. This is purely visual, and client side only."}

It was added in . It is a version of the &lt;a href=\"Kymera%20Ray%20Gun\"&gt;Kymera Ray Gun&lt;/a&gt;.\nFunctionality.\nThe weapon is notable for its fire rate of 16, one of the highest among all weapons. It emits a constant red stream of energy after a short charge-up period when the fire button is held. The weapon has infinite ammo, but similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt;, it requires a cooldown period after being continuously fired.\nObtained.\n\"From when the weapon was last available in Chapter 4: Season 4:\"\nZyg and Choppy's Ray Gun can be obtained by accessing the vault at either, &lt;a href=\"Eclipsed%20Estate\"&gt;Eclipsed Estate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Relentless%20Retreat\"&gt;Relentless Retreat&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Suites\"&gt;Sanguine Suites&lt;/a&gt;, spawning in one of the 3 (or 2) glass cases.

It requires a wind-up before firing, taking 0.2 seconds to do so. It uses Infinite with a little cooldown. The Zyg and Choppy's Ray Gun has a headshot multiplier of 1.2x, and can fire continuously 39 shots before cooling down (for 2.44 seconds). \nZyg and Choppy's Ray Gun is a beam weapon, meaning its attack directly connects with a target (like hitscan), but it does not fire separate attacks when held, instead dealing rapid damage in one continuous attack. As such, First Shot Accuracy is irrelevant."}

It was introduced in .\nFunctionality.\nLeonardo's Katanas are a hybrid of a close range hack-and-slash weapon and an air ambush weapon like the other &lt;a href=\"Rarity\"&gt;Mythic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Collaborations\"&gt;TMNT&lt;/a&gt; weapons. They have a unique octagonal reticle (reminiscent of a turtle shell). When attacking and targeting an opponent in range, the reticle becomes yellow, the color of Leonardo's headband.\nEach Mythic TMNT weapon has a standard attack (fire) that can be held to string a chain of attacks together. Each hit deals different amounts of damage and thus the weapon does not have a consistent damage per second. They also possess an air dash (aim) that will allow the player to quickly launch themselves into the air a short distance. It can also be used on the ground. This dash also deals damage if it hits an opponent, but has a very small cooldown afterwards. While in the air, the player may use the standard attack to produce an air attack (a ground slam that deals heavy damage and knockback).\nIn addition, simply having this weapon as the active weapon grants the user a passive double jump. Using this gives the player fall damage immunity and a slight boost forward, but it can't be used again until the player touches the ground. This jump uses stamina even if the player isn't sprinting. For this reason, players must manage their stamina carefully, as if they are caught in midair without enough stamina to double jump, they will take fall damage as normal and potentially eliminate themselves.\nThe weapon has three charges that slowly refill over time similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Grapple%20Blade\"&gt;Grapple Blade&lt;/a&gt;. Using an air dash or air attack expends a charge. Each charge takes 10 seconds to refill.\nLeonardo's Combo.\nLeonardo's standard attack combo consists of a slash diagonally downwards, a slash from left to right, a stab forward, a spinning strike, then a backwards spinning strike.\nWeapon ID.\nLeonardo's Katanas are referred to as Lined Notebook Lake in the files.\nNews Tab.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}
