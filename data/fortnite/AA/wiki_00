But since , they have come in the form of less descriptive blog posts titled:\nThroughout Chapter 2, Epic Games introduced multiple forms and formats of \"Patch Notes\", until they arrived on the current iteration of \"What's New in Battle Royale\", first used in and returned in . \nIn Chapter 3, the blog posts on their website received new titles:\nThe posts also include more information such as &lt;a href=\"Competitive%20%28Gamemode%29\"&gt;Competitive&lt;/a&gt; Notes and bug fixes.\nContent.\nAlthough it is unknown specifically what could come with a update, you can assume what type of content it will have and know how big it will be based on what kind of update it is:\nChapter Update:\nSeason Update:\nMajor Update:\nContent Update:\nHotfix:\nScheduling.\nMajor updates are usually released every two weeks, on a Tuesday. Content Updates and Hotfixes are released when there are no major updates. A week prior, the update is put in staging servers, where Epic Games privately test the update and fix any bugs prior to release. During Summer and Winter seasons, Epic Games staff take a holiday break, so there is usually a 4-week gap between major updates, but content updates can still happen.\nFormat.\nThe version number is currently formatted where the first digits indicate the Season, counting since &lt;a href=\"Season%201\"&gt;Season 1&lt;/a&gt;. The first number after the decimal point indicates the patch number of that season. The second number after the decimal point is usually a 0 but can be a 1 for either content updates or minor patches. Other numbers in the last digit such as a 5, 6, or 9 are test updates and are never released.\nExample: &lt;a href=\"Update%20v21.30\"&gt;Update v21.30&lt;/a&gt;\nList of Updates.\nBelow are highlights of the patch notes with release dates and content additions. All patches contain bug fixes.\nUpdates before this are unknown/lost, mainly due to the removal of those patch notes and that Fortnite was not well known at the time."}

He loves putting himself in all kinds of dangerous situations from jumping into an active &lt;a href=\"Volcano\"&gt;Volcano&lt;/a&gt;, goofing around in &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt;, driving truck through a literal &lt;a href=\"Collision\"&gt;warzone&lt;/a&gt; or just getting into a hostage situation. Peely loves being the center of attention.\nAppearance.\nPeely is literally a banana with human arms and human legs. It would seem that inside his banana peel is just a normal banana, meaning that he might be \"edible\" and has been turned into a smoothie. However, the existence of the &lt;a href=\"Peely%20Bone\"&gt;Peely Bone&lt;/a&gt; Outfit calls his physiology into question. Upon inspection, it seems that Peely possesses an entire skeletal structure and intestines. Other organs are presumably omitted due to concerns with gore. While it seems that Peely does possess banana matter within his body, it is more or less contained within his ribcage and pelvis (presumably it makes up the majority of his limbs) rather than being what Peely's body is solely comprised of. It is unknown, however, if the Peely Bone Outfit actually says anything about Peely or whether it is its own kind of species.\nTimeline.\nPre-&lt;a href=\"Season%208\"&gt;Season 8&lt;/a&gt;.\nA young banana is born into a species of humanoid bananas. \n&lt;a href=\"Season%208\"&gt;Season 8&lt;/a&gt;.\nPeely goes through the &lt;a href=\"Ripening%20Ritual\"&gt;Ripening Ritual&lt;/a&gt;, entering his bananahood.

He asks &lt;a href=\"The%20Origin\"&gt;The Origin&lt;/a&gt; to get Jones to teach him how to drive so he can help the resistance. After the &lt;a href=\"Help%20The%20Seven%20Reclaim\"&gt;reclaiming&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"The%20Daily%20Bugle\"&gt;The Daily Bugle&lt;/a&gt;, he drove an ice cream truck and failed to steer, crashing the truck near the shore in &lt;a href=\"Sleepy%20Sound\"&gt;Sleepy Sound&lt;/a&gt;.

A missing poster featuring Peely can be seen floating in space.\nPeely is kidnapped by &lt;a href=\"The%20Society\"&gt;The Society&lt;/a&gt;, in order to get Jones to deliver information about what Valeria is looking for, however not only did Jones not know anything about Pandora's Box, but he also goes on a personal war against &lt;a href=\"The%20Society\"&gt;The Society&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout the season, Jones has &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; hang up Missing posters and place radars in an attempt to locate Peely. Over the course of the &lt;a href=\"Takedown%20Quests\"&gt;Takedown Quests&lt;/a&gt;, Jones, Hope, and The Looper work together to Eliminate Legion Guards and Elites, Steal Society &lt;a href=\"Medallions\"&gt;Medallions&lt;/a&gt;, and defeat the Bosses of the Society, which culminate in Jones finally &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Peely%20Rescue\"&gt;Rescuing Peely&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Fencing%20Fields\"&gt;Fencing Fields&lt;/a&gt;.\nPeely received one of the edict of Zeus, that was intended for another God. They gave it to &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;. Later, The Oracle reveals that Peely is the lynchpin holding together all of reality.\nTo fight Doom's invasion on the island, Peely takes on the role of &lt;a href=\"Peelverine\"&gt;Peelverine&lt;/a&gt;, accompanied by his best friend &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Jones\"&gt;Captain Jones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;, also collaborating with other heroes from Reality 616.

Their first was ', but many of their members had already worked on various titles before this. Some members helped create 10 different titles since 1992, with the best-known being ', or \"Odium\" in the . The team currently consists of 20 members, excluding external contractors.\nThe name \"People Can Fly\" was chosen after checking the names of several albums and song titles. On August 20, 2007, &lt;a href=\"Epic%20Games\"&gt;Epic Games&lt;/a&gt; acquired a majority share in the company. and the firm eventually rebranded itself as Epic Games Poland on November 1, 2013. However, on June 24, 2015, they regained their independence and subsequently changed back to their original name and logo.\nHistory.\nDuring an interview for Polish \"Neo Plus\", Adrian Chmielarz described Epic's acquisition of People Can Fly as a multi-step process. Facing issues with extending its proprietary engine, People Can Fly considered using a third-party solution. This led to an interest in the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Engine\"&gt;Unreal Engine&lt;/a&gt;, which led to contacting Epic Games. After presenting a demo to Epic Games, People Can Fly was hired to create additional content for the PC version of \"&lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Agearsofwar%3AGears%20of%20War\"&gt;Gears of War&lt;/a&gt;\". Impressed with the quality of the collaboration, Epic decided to shift the PC porting effort to the studio. The success of the \"Gears of War\" port led to the formal acquisition.\nIn August 2008, Epic announced that Electronic Arts would be the publisher of an action title by People Can Fly. In April 2010, it was revealed to be \"&lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Abulletstorm%3ABulletstorm%20Wiki\"&gt;Bulletstorm&lt;/a&gt;\", a first-person shooter in development with &lt;a href=\"Epic%20Games\"&gt;Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;. It was originally going to be one of the two titles revealed by &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Bleszinski\"&gt;Cliff Bleszinski&lt;/a&gt; (the other title being \"&lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Agearsofwar%3AGears%20of%20War%203\"&gt;Gears of War 3&lt;/a&gt;\") during his appearance on \"\", but due to scheduling reasons, the announcement was cancelled.\nOn June 1, 2012, it was announced that People Can Fly will be involved in the development of \"Gears of War: Judgment\".\nOn August 13, 2012, Epic Games announced that it has fully acquired People Can Fly. In another announcement on the same day, People Can Fly co-owner and creative director Adrian Chmielarz announced his departure from the company.\nOn June 24, 2015, People Can Fly announced that they would be split from their parent company Epic Games, a process that had begun with the release of \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//gearsofwar.fandom.com/wiki/Gears_of_War%3A_Judgment\"&gt;Gears of War: Judgement&lt;/a&gt;\". As a result, the studio became independent and will be led by Sebastian Wojciechowski. The company retained the \"Bulletstorm\" franchise and revealed an unannounced project based on Unreal Engine 4."}

It has infinite durability, so this weapon never breaks.\nPlayers can upgrade their Pickaxe level in Save the World through &lt;a href=\"Upgrades\"&gt;Upgrades&lt;/a&gt;, increasing the amount of damage the Pickaxe does to objects, and therefore allowing the player to break things faster and collecting the materials faster.

Chimpanski.\"\nLoopers,\nLike I repeated in my first letter to you, we need all the help we can get to overcome The Cubes. You already joined the global war effort by funding Turret Stations, but it\u2019s gonna take more than just these to be victorious. Luckily, your main ape J.B. has something else up his sleeve:\nChoose What's Produced In The Fortnite War Effort.\nI\u2019ve dug up schematics for new, powerful tools \u2014 and some old favorites \u2014 to strengthen your arsenal. Only problem is, I don\u2019t have the production funds. This is where you come in. Donation Boards are set up at POIs for you to chimp in Bars towards which item you want to see as future loot. First item to hit 100% Funded is immediately unlocked and ready for use.\nOur first face-off is against two masters of mobility: lob away and bounce back with a &lt;a href=\"Shockwave%20Launcher\"&gt;Shockwave Launcher&lt;/a&gt; or take to the skies with the &lt;a href=\"Rift-To-Go\"&gt;Rift-To-Go&lt;/a&gt;. New head-to-head campaigns will kick off as our fight against the Cubes continues, so save up your Bars and help decide the items my crew provides!\nThis isn\u2019t all I wanted to discuss, though\u2026 \nArmored Walls: Strengthen Your Structures.\nWar means it\u2019s time to reinforce, which is why I\u2019ve bolted together the &lt;a href=\"Armored%20Wall\"&gt;Armored Wall&lt;/a&gt;. Give any building piece a whole bunch more HP by putting this barrier on it. You can also build pieces with Armored Walls automatically attached. No matter how you go about it, it\u2019ll be a LOT tougher for the enemy to reach you if you surround yourself with \u2018em. \nThe Armored Wall is technically considered a Trap, probably because it\u2019s a time sink to try to break one. Starting at 9 AM ET, I'm placing these fortified fixtures in Supply Drops and scattering \u2018em on the ground \u2014 pick some up for extra defense!

For completing birthday Quests, you can unlock the cake-based 4 Me??? Back Bling, cake-on-a-stick Hooplah Hammer Pickaxe, and cupcake 4? Score! Emoticon! Like the Birthday Cakes and Presents, these Quests will be live from September 24 at 9 AM ET to September 28 at 2 AM ET.\nThere\u2019s no need to reply to this with an RSVP.

This must be a way The Storm keeps its Husks alert, active, and always ready to tear apart your structures.\"\n\"I don\u2019t know what The Storm is feeding these Husks, but it sure seems to be working. Higher level Husk will have an easier time clawing through your defense, so watch out in those more difficult Zones.\"\n\"To counter these buffed up Husks, we have strengthened our traps! Husks will no longer become immune to our control traps, no matter how many times you stun, snare or freeze 'em. What does Major Oswald like to say again? No Mercy?\"\n\"This proves my theory that The Storm is smarter than we think so as our tactics change, so will The Storm\u2019s. We gotta be ready for anything.

Head over to our \"Fortnite | Community Issues\" Trello board here.\n= \"Battle Royale\" =\nGeneral.\nOne of our goals for Fortnite is to have a number of ways to play the game and be successful. We\u2019ve identified some strategies that are overly dominant and we\u2019ll be making some adjustments today. Going forward we\u2019ll continue to monitor how we can best support that gameplay variety.\nHere are some of the immediate changes coming today!\nShotguns\nFor a while we felt that Shotguns promoted healthy close quarter gameplay, however with the recent equip time changes, Shotguns are being used more often than we like. It's something we've been keeping an eye on, but broadly speaking we feel Shotguns are a little too strong in their current state. As a result, we\u2019re making these adjustments:\nShotgun consistency across the board is also something we're looking into and aim to improve. We want to make it more apparent when you hit or miss a shot. In addition to that, making sure the accuracy is more consistent and improving other odd behaviors with the weapon is a top priority. We've identified a number of issues that we're currently working on solving in the near future.\nTraps\nWe made a large change to traps a few weeks ago to test decreasing damage from 125 to 75. This was done in an effort to better understand the impact traps have throughout a match. The change sparked a great deal of excellent discussion about traps and we are going to lean more into improving their effectiveness. We want this to add more ways for you to be potent in combat. Here\u2019s the change:\nJetpack\nThe &lt;a href=\"Jetpack\"&gt;Jetpack&lt;/a&gt; was introduced as a Limited Time Item. You can learn more on the goals of Limited Time Items as a concept in &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8m3htw/limited_time_item_jetpack/\"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.\nWe will be vaulting the Jetpack at 8am on Monday, June 11. Get in your last matches before then! We may bring back the Jetpack at a future date with some improvements and new changes.\nWeapons + Items.\nBuilding AdjustmentsWe are making the following changes to address a few top concerns, including: Rocket Launcher and Grenade Launcher dominance in the late game, Minigun effectiveness, and overall resource availability. We will be closely monitoring these changes when they are live to assess the impact and re-adjust as necessary.\n= \"Save the World\" ="}

They are sentient beings born from &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt; with malicious intent to corrupt everything.\nDescription and Lore.\nCorruption Cube is a sentient entity that appeared first on August 24, 2018, during Season 5. It appeared near &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20Palms\"&gt;Paradise Palms&lt;/a&gt;, being created from several lightning strikes from the &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;Sideways Rift&lt;/a&gt;, closing it in the process. The Cube is an object of immense power, as it was capable of destroying objects in its path as it rolled towards &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt;, printing powerful runes which reduced gravity, and generated &lt;a href=\"Cube%20Monsters\"&gt;Cube Monsters&lt;/a&gt; from its fragments.\nThe Cubes are the power sources of &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt;, an evil and malicious faction affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Anomalies\"&gt;The Sideways&lt;/a&gt; with an intention to corrupt and destroy &lt;a href=\"The%20Omniverse\"&gt;realities&lt;/a&gt;. The Cubes are all controlled by &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%20Queen\"&gt;The Cube Queen&lt;/a&gt;. Thousands of dormant cubes are stored in a dedicated room in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Mothership\"&gt;Motherships&lt;/a&gt;, used to power the gigantic alien ships.\nIt has taken several forms, but has spent most time as a large purple cube, which deflects bullets, and hurts players who attempt to go near it.\nAfter killing the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20King\"&gt;Storm King&lt;/a&gt;, a cube emerges in a lake and it begins to dissolve similar to how it did during &lt;a href=\"Season%205\"&gt;Season 5&lt;/a&gt;, indicating the Cube was the Storm King.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%205\"&gt;Season 5&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;Sideways Rift&lt;/a&gt; continued to rapidly close up, it suddenly turned purple. Within the next few days, purple &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;storm&lt;/a&gt; lightning bolts began shooting out of the crack, all targeting a hill near &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20Palms\"&gt;Paradise Palms&lt;/a&gt;, containing a large stone rock surrounded by a ring of cacti. Each lightning strike picked off one cacti one-by-one, until a larger lightning bolt destroyed the large rock. The &lt;a href=\"Crack%20Closure\"&gt;Crack Closure&lt;/a&gt; event occurred on 24th August 2018, with a gigantic storm lightning bolt striking out of the rift, lasting for around 10 seconds. When it was over, the Crack in the Sky closed. then The Cube was formed. Though it first appeared to be a stationary object, it began to move at a rate of one revolution every 1 hour and 43 minutes. It was unclear where it would end up. During its journey around the map, The Cube printed seven runes with anti-gravity domes surrounding. Throughout the final three weeks of Season 5, the cube continued to print these runes.\nAfter finishing this process, The Cube destroyed one of the buildings in &lt;a href=\"Tilted%20Towers\"&gt;Tilted Towers&lt;/a&gt;. The sporting goods store was hit by a meteorite and was just in the final stages of reopening. The Cube then proceeded to the edge of &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt; on September 19, 2018. The Cube appeared to dissolve, turning Loot Lake in a purple-pink gelatinous state with properties akin to The Cube itself, such as becoming bouncy.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%206\"&gt;Season 6&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the beginning of &lt;a href=\"Season%206\"&gt;Season 6&lt;/a&gt;, it was revealed that The Cube was still intact, as it rose from the waters, taking the cabin and island in the center of the lake with it, forming the &lt;a href=\"Floating%20Island\"&gt;Floating Island&lt;/a&gt;. This created a large hole in the lake exposing the bridge to &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, a vortex in the middle. After just two days of the island rising, The Cube began to move the island to each of the runes it had printed in Season 5. After getting energy from all runes, they dropped to the ground and the island returned to Loot Lake. A portal to &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt; was formed above, which began to expand until it covered the entire island. On October 24, 2018, the first day of &lt;a href=\"Fortnitemares\"&gt;Fortnitemares 2018,&lt;/a&gt; The Cube exploded the floating island into multiple pieces, the Cube still intact. Following the explosion, The Cube fragments that had been growing on the island had been sent all over the map, which released The Cube monsters.\nFrom this day until November 4. The Cube began to crack. On November 3, it began to drip its nectar into &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, until the final drip. On November 4, 2018, The Cube started to spin rapidly, which led to a white flash, and The Cube splitting apart. After the flash, players were teleported to &lt;a href=\"The%20In-Between\"&gt;The In-Between&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after, a rift formed, and took shape of a butterfly, which then multiplied, and came to every player still alive. A cut-scene showed up, where the player put out their finger, and the butterfly would land on the finger, and it got teleported back to the map through a rift. &lt;a href=\"Leaky%20Lake\"&gt;Leaky Lake&lt;/a&gt; appears to be completely new, and the &lt;a href=\"Cube%20Monsters\"&gt;Cube Monsters&lt;/a&gt; were gone.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%207\"&gt;Season 7&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Storm\"&gt;Ice Storm&lt;/a&gt; event, &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20King%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;The Ice King&lt;/a&gt; uses a small shard of the Cube to summon &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Legion\"&gt;Ice Legion&lt;/a&gt; and freeze the island in order to stop &lt;a href=\"Polar%20Peak\"&gt;Polar Peak&lt;/a&gt; from melting.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%20X\"&gt;Season X&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Floating%20Island\"&gt;Floating Island&lt;/a&gt; from an alternate timeline came through a &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Beacon\"&gt;Rift Beacon&lt;/a&gt;. it didn't do anything after that except circle the island aimlessly. Later in the season, Cube memorials appeared at &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt; and on the mountain Kevin was created.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"The%20End\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; and the creation of &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;, The Floating Island was destroyed, but The Cube was conserved. Following the reconstruction of the island by &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, it was placed into a dormant state and underneath Building 2 of &lt;a href=\"Steamy%20Stacks\"&gt;Steamy Stacks&lt;/a&gt;, a power station which uses The Cube to generate electricity. The facility is run by &lt;a href=\"Kevolution%20Energy\"&gt;Kevolution Energy&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"The Spire Artifact\" is a small piece of the Spire's core, it emits Cube's runes. The Spire's core was originally made of chromium, how it got corrupted is unknown. Seeing visions of the future in his dreams, &lt;a href=\"Raz\"&gt;Raz&lt;/a&gt; ended up on the island after years and years of research, and got too close to The Spire Artifact only to make him corrupted with new powers. &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt; notice his power and arrives at the island.\nDuring the live event, &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt; was revealed to have possessed a corruption cube in one of its rooms. After &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; deactivates it using &lt;a href=\"Alien%20Jetpack\"&gt;Alien Backpack&lt;/a&gt; and arms the bombs, she betrays the loopers by sealing them in with the cube. &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Loopers&lt;/a&gt; reboot it, turning it blue, which causes the room to rise up into a chamber containing thousands of dormant corruption cubes stored inside with a golden cube at the center. After the bombs detonate, the mothership is destroyed, and debris and cubes rain down onto the map, causing devastation.\nThere are the multiple Corruption Cubes scattered throughout &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; following the destruction of &lt;a href=\"The%20Mothership\"&gt;The Mothership&lt;/a&gt;. There were five purple cubes spread across the island at the beginning of season, along with one more hidden under &lt;a href=\"Steamy%20Stacks\"&gt;Steamy Stacks&lt;/a&gt;. When the cubes (and any of their \"spawn\") move around the map, the corruption from their energy spreads around the island with them. There used to be 38 &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube\"&gt;Cubes&lt;/a&gt; on the map, including the Gold and Blue ones. Now, only two \"full\" cubes remain, those being, ironically, the Gold and Blue ones, with the rest being fused into &lt;a href=\"The%20Convergence\"&gt;The Convergence&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn October 19th 2021, 3:55 AM EST, all the cubes moved for one final time before downtime began for &lt;a href=\"Update%20v18.21\"&gt;Update v18.21&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"It is important to note that not every movement will be recorded here.\"\n&lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28Chapter%202%29\"&gt;The End (Chapter 2)&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%20Queen\"&gt;The Cube Queen&lt;/a&gt; used &lt;a href=\"The%20Pyramid\"&gt;The Pyramid&lt;/a&gt; to shot a beam of corrupted energy into the sky, opening a massive rift to &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt;, revealing hundreds of &lt;a href=\"The%20Mothership\"&gt;Motherships&lt;/a&gt; powered by &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Cube\"&gt;Golden Cubes&lt;/a&gt;, along with the Cube's Cradle. They quickly overrun the entire island. meanwhile in &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; reverses the gyroscopic orientation of the Island causing it to rotate. The Cube Queen goes underwater (possibly teleporting) and The Pyramid is completely submerged once the Island reaches a 90-degree tilt, closing the rift to the Last Reality.\n&lt;a href=\"Universal%20Monsters%20-%20We%20Will%20Be%20Monsters\"&gt;Universal Monsters - We Will Be Monsters&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe reality of universal monsters is being consumed by the colorless void, &lt;a href=\"Frankenstein%27s%20Bride\"&gt;Frankenstein's Bride&lt;/a&gt; and the other monsters teamed up and use the cube's power to restore the colors.\nWith the beginning of &lt;a href=\"Season%206\"&gt;Season 6&lt;/a&gt;, The Cube rose from the waters, taking the cabin and island in the center of the lake with it, forming the &lt;a href=\"Floating%20Island\"&gt;Floating Island&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Bang\"&gt;The Big Bang&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Floating%20Island\"&gt;Floating Island&lt;/a&gt; did not appear at the event.\nTrivia.\nThe Cubes teleports themselves if they wants to cross the water.

{"id": "61417", "revid": "45410954", "url": "https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki?curid=61417", "title": "Creative Inventory (Overview)", "text": "The Creative Inventory is a tool in that allows creators to access Items, Devices, Building assets, and more.\nThe Creative Inventory has many bonus features, such as browsing through events and selecting the permissions of creators inside your island.\nThis Article showcases a basic overview of the features and sections of the Creative Inventory. This Article does not give an in-depth review of every feature, however articles that do contain this information have been linked in each appropriate section.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n=My Island=\nThis Section contains a brief overview of The \"My Island\" Menu. For the full list of settings, see &lt;a href=\"Creative%20Island%20Settings\"&gt;Creative Island Settings&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe My Island menu is the First tab in the Creative Inventory and it is used to customize your island by modifying things, such as the Gravity, whether Sprinting is enabled, Weapon Destruction, and many more things.\nThere are many sections in the My Island menu, including:\nThe Game tab allows Creators to modify island-wide settings, such as the Game Countdown Length and the Auto-start Duration. Settings found in here are not usually found elsewhere (with a couple of exceptions).\nThe Game tab is also allows Creators to control matchmaking in their islands. For example, they can increase or reduce the maximum amount of players allowed in at one time. They can also change the matchmaking privacy and the amount of rounds that are played per session.\nThe Settings tab allows Creators to have advanced control of the players and interactive objects in their experiences. For example, they can change the level of gravity, whether players obtain syphon from eliminations, the maximum amount of building materials that can be carried at once, whether building is enabled, and how many item slots a player has. Most of the options in this tab can be modified elsewhere during the game. For example, the &lt;a href=\"Class%20Selector\"&gt;Class Selector&lt;/a&gt; allows things, like player movement speed and whether sliding is enabled, to be changed mid-game.\nThe Settings tab also allows creators to adjust the Time of Day and other aesthetic changes on their island.\nThe UI tab is different to the other 2 setting tabs. Rather than directly changing gameplay, the UI tab can be used to change the look and feel of the player's HUD and User Interface.\nThe UI tab can do many things, such as changing the victory sound and animation, to selecting which additional information is displayed on the screen. It can also show and hide certain elements of the UI. The UI tab's settings usually can't be modified by Devices during the game, however there are a few exceptions.\nThe Debug tab allows Creators to find and solve issues in their experiences. It allows creators to use handy tools, such as enabling invincibility or being able to see the navigation bounds for AI, in case they can access a certain area that was not intended for them.\nThe Debug tab can be very useful in Creative. It is worth noting that these options do not affect published islands and are purely for testing purposes.\nThe Tools tab gives Creators a variety of tools to use when creating their experience. For example, Creators can create backups of their experiences, which they can restore at any time if anything goes wrong.\nThe Tools tab also allows Creators to publish their creations, update already-published creations, and get publishing help. They can also use it to convert their islands to any ongoing beta tests (for example, the V2 Devices beta). \nWithout this tab, Creative mode would be very different. The Permissions tab allows you to grant and remove edit permissions for all players, and it can also be modified for specific trusted (or untrusted) individuals. This tab is mainly used to stop scammers or trolls from entering into your islands and deleting things or placing random objects.\nThe Permissions tab also acts as a way to see who is currently editing your island, and sometimes it will show who has recently edited your island, too.\nThis tab is effectively a miniature version of the Outliner in &lt;a href=\"Unreal%20Engine\"&gt;Unreal Engine&lt;/a&gt;. It allows Creators to browse every device that is currently placed in the world.\nOn top of this, Creators can see what events belong to which Device, and they can also use the built-in teleport function to quickly get to a Device that is MII or is causing issues.\n=Creative=\nThe Creative menu is the Second tab in the Creative Inventory and its purpose is to display a library full of content that is available for use in your island, such as Weapons, Devices, and Prefabs.\nThere are many sections in the Creative menu, including:\nThis Section contains a brief overview of The \"Prefabs\" section. For the full list of Prefabs, see &lt;a href=\"Prefabs\"&gt;Prefabs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrefabs are Pre-Built structures created by Epic Games, and this tab contains a library of these.\nPrefabs come from many places, including: Battle Royale Island POIs (Past and Present), Save the World, Limited Time Modes, and some are even exclusive to Creative.\nPrefabs can also be opened, so that each asset inside can be selected without having to place the entire prefab down.\nThis Section contains a brief overview of The \"Galleries\" section. For the full list of Galleries, see &lt;a href=\"Galleries\"&gt;Galleries&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike Prefabs, Galleries are a collection of assets that are laid out so that is easy to see each asset. Galleries are useful to those who are looking to make their own buildings, rather than re-use a pre-existing ones. \nLike Prefabs, Galleries can be opened so that Creators can select each individual asset without having to place down the entire Gallery.\nThere are many types of Galleries, such as Vehicle Galleries, Nature Galleries, Terrain Galleries, and Building Galleries.\nThis Section contains a brief overview of The \"Devices\" section. For the full list of Devices, see &lt;a href=\"Devices%20%28Creative%29\"&gt;Devices&lt;/a&gt;.\nDevices are used to make Mechanics in Fortnite Creative. Every Device has a unique function, such as tracking player eliminations, creating different zones with different gameplay twists in each, and creating an impenetrable barrier.\nEach Device has many options; from the appearance of the Device to the functionality in-game.\nDevices are divided into many categories, including: Damage, Player, Settings, and Zones.\nWeapons play a major part in Fortnite. They are used to change the gameplay, sometimes in dramatic ways. The Weapons tab contains most of the Weapons that have ever been/currently are in Fortnite.\nThere are 7 weapon rarities: , , , , , , and . Each rarity can be filtered in the Weapons tab. On top of this, there are other filterable subcategories, such as: Medium Ammo, Primal, Bows, Special Ammo, and Submachine Guns.\nConsumables also play a major part in Fortnite. They are a range of items, each with their own abilities. For example, the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Bush%20Bomb\"&gt;Big Bush Bomb&lt;/a&gt; places a giant bush in the world and the &lt;a href=\"Junk%20Rift\"&gt;Junk Rift&lt;/a&gt; creates a falling object that can damage structures and opponents.\nConsumables bear the same rarities as Weapons do, and they have similar categories, but modified for consumables, such as: Throwable, Flipped, Transport, and Fire-Starting.\nYou can add the previously-mentioned Weapons and Consumables to a Chest using this tab. In the Weapons and Consumables tabs, there will be the option to \"Add to Chest.\" Clicking this will put whatever you just added to the chest into this tab.\nOnce your desired Weapons and Consumables are in this tab, click \"Create Chest\" or \"Create Llama\" to create a Chest or a &lt;a href=\"Supply%20Llama\"&gt;Loot Llama&lt;/a&gt; that can be picked up like a prop and placed around your island.\n\"Note: You can only add up to 15 items at a time to a Chest. There is also no way to randomize which loot is dropped from this tab.\"\nThis section contains a brief overview of Levels. For the full information, see &lt;a href=\"Level%20Instance%20Device\"&gt;Level Instance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Level%20Loader\"&gt;Level Loader&lt;/a&gt;.\nCreators can create their own levels using the &lt;a href=\"Level%20Instance%20Device\"&gt;Level Instance Device&lt;/a&gt;, which can be loaded in-game using the &lt;a href=\"Level%20Loader\"&gt;Level Loader&lt;/a&gt;. These are essentially custom prefabs. Levels can be viewed and managed in the Levels tab.\n=Inventory (Play)=\nThe Inventory tab allows players to manage their inventory while creating and in-game.\nHere is a brief overview of everything that the Inventory tab can store: \nThere are many different types of Resources, including:\n\"Note: Up to 999 of each type of Building Material and Ammo can be stored in this tab (this limit is customizable for Building Materials). Note that Arrows are capped at 30, and Rockets at 60. On top of this, 2.1 Billion of each crafting resource can also be stored in the Inventory tab.\"\nUp to 5 Weapons and Items can be stored in the Inventory at one time, however this can be lowered by the island's Creator. \nThe Inventory lets you inspect Weapons to see things like their Statistics (Damage, Magazine Size, Fire Rate, Etc.) and their descriptions.\nIn the Inventory, you can also switch the position of a Weapon or Consumable with another Weapon or Consumable, or to an empty slot.\nTrap Devices and Traps are also found in the Inventory.\nTraps from the Inventory can be placed both in Create Mode, and they can be granted to players during a game to be placed then instead.\nEach Trap has its own limit for how many can be carried in the Inventory. For example, you can only carry 15 &lt;a href=\"Armored%20Wall\"&gt;Armored Walls&lt;/a&gt;.\n=Logs=\nThe Logs tab contains a list of Errors and Developer Messages. This tab is useful for debugging &lt;a href=\"Verse\"&gt;Verse&lt;/a&gt; script. Currently, this tab is only available in a &lt;a href=\"Unreal%20Editor%20for%20Fortnite\"&gt;UEFN&lt;/a&gt; Session.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

It allowed creators to create their own rules on the Battle Royale island.\nOverview.\nCreative Royale was the successor to &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Lab\"&gt;Battle Lab&lt;/a&gt;. Introduced in &lt;a href=\"Update%20v22.30\"&gt;Update v22.30&lt;/a&gt;, it allows you to customize the &lt;a href=\"Asteria\"&gt;Battle Royale Island&lt;/a&gt; with a select group of pre-existing and unique devices, such as the &lt;a href=\"Melee%20Designer\"&gt;Melee Designer&lt;/a&gt; (which allows for the creation of custom melee weapon) and the &lt;a href=\"Team%20Settings%20%26amp%3B%20Inventory\"&gt;Team Settings &amp; Inventory&lt;/a&gt; (which allows you to assign unique settings to different team members).\nCreative Royale was accessed in the same way as a normal Creative island. To make a new Creative Royale island, select the &lt;a href=\"Asteria\"&gt;Battle Royale Island&lt;/a&gt; template island.\n&lt;a href=\"Late%20Game%20Arena\"&gt;Late Game Arena&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Big%20Battle\"&gt;Big Battle&lt;/a&gt; are two official modes created in Creative Royale.\nRestrictions.\nThe Creative Royale island updates alongside &lt;a href=\"Asteria\"&gt;Battle Royale Island&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this, players cannot place any props or builds on the island, and only certain devices can be placed (usually ones that can remotely control gameplay).\nAdditionally, many features are completely unavailable in Creative Royale, such as Mud, &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Encounters\"&gt;Rift Encounters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Character%20Collection%20Book\"&gt;Characters&lt;/a&gt;, and more.\nSome items do not spawn or drop properly in Creative Royale, such as &lt;a href=\"Keycards\"&gt;Keycards&lt;/a&gt;, rendering features like &lt;a href=\"Vaults\"&gt;Vaults&lt;/a&gt; inaccessible. Additionally, some items that are not in the creative menu normally such as &lt;a href=\"Ocean%27s%20Bottomless%20Chug%20Jug\"&gt;Ocean\u2019s Bottomless Chug Jug&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Midas%27%20Drum%20Gun\"&gt;Midas\u2019 Drum Gun&lt;/a&gt; will completely disappear if dropped from the player inventory.\n&lt;a href=\"Bars\"&gt;Bars&lt;/a&gt; are replaced with &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt; in Creative Royale.

She led the fight against &lt;a href=\"The%20Society\"&gt;The Society&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Wasteland%20Warriors\"&gt;Wasteland Warriors&lt;/a&gt;. She also followed &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;'s lead, joining them and their immortal allies against &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; and his allies.\nShe is one of the three main protagonists of Chapter 5 and Chapter 6, alongside &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality.\nHope is a rebellious young woman with a good sense of justice and heroic ideals unlike her family of people with \"great record of destroying the world\". Hope is also a very artistic person as most of the graffiti arts on &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt; island were made by Hope herself. Hope is usually a pretty friendly person but when the &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt; is involved, she can be frightening, impatient, impulsive and short-tempered.\nAlthough Hope viewed herself as a nemesis to her sister &lt;a href=\"Valeria\"&gt;Valeria&lt;/a&gt;, Hope's deeply cares about her. When &lt;a href=\"Valeria\"&gt;Valeria&lt;/a&gt; opened the Pandora's Box, Hope consider herself on the hook to fixing its ever expanding mess. \nHope considered &lt;a href=\"Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; as her mentor with wisdom beyond his years and Jones followed along on Hope's journey because she reminded him of his younger years.\nDuring Chapter 5: Season 4, Hope was leading an army of heroes, Avengers and X-Mens. With everyone looking up to her as the Hope of the Pandora's Box, Hope started to show signs of fears and uneasiness. When Doctor Doom suddenly appeared out of nowhere ready to fight her, Hope broke down in fear but Jones and the Oracle were there to help her get back up and reassure her that the fight will go well.\nAppearance.\nHope is a young adult woman with rebel aesthetic and cat themed clothing. To everyone's eyes, Hope is just a normal human but to &lt;a href=\"The%20Pantheon\"&gt;The Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; god's eyes, she is a glowing \"spirit of hope\". After &lt;a href=\"Absolute%20Doom%20Event\"&gt;Absolute Doom Event&lt;/a&gt;, Hope was forced to wear a golden arm cast to cover up a damage she received from Pandora's Box energy.\nTimeline.\nBefore Chapter 5.\nHope and her family were raised in &lt;a href=\"The%20Society\"&gt;The Society&lt;/a&gt;, a group founded by &lt;a href=\"Montague\"&gt;Montague&lt;/a&gt; comprised of the rich and elite on the island. Hope and &lt;a href=\"Clara\"&gt;Clara&lt;/a&gt; had known each other for a long time while she was part of their ranks. &lt;a href=\"Valeria\"&gt;Valeria&lt;/a&gt; rose to become the head of her and Hope's family, and made her way to the top of The Society alongside Montague, Hope thus taking an elite role. Despite growing up in the higher ranks, Hope came to resent what The Society stood for, Valeria's growing obsession with power after finding their grandfather's books on &lt;a href=\"The%20Pantheon\"&gt;The Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt;, and her exclusion for being younger. She left The Society to form &lt;a href=\"The%20Underground\"&gt;The Underground&lt;/a&gt;, and built a group of like-minded rebels who had also been wronged by The Society, determined to knock them down. &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; later joined her group for help in finding &lt;a href=\"Peely\"&gt;Peely&lt;/a&gt;, in exchange for his help against The Society.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Takedown%20Quests\"&gt;Takedown Quests&lt;/a&gt;, Hope sends &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; out to distract The Society while she and Jones try and locate Peely. As a team, her, Jones, and The Looper take out Society Guards, steal Society &lt;a href=\"Medallions\"&gt;Medallions&lt;/a&gt;, and defeat each of the Society's bosses for information on where Peely is located. Eventually, they find and free Peely from &lt;a href=\"Fencing%20Fields\"&gt;Fencing Fields&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the location and The Society in shambles. After they rescue Peely, Hope learns Valeria is undertaking a mysterious project, leaving Hope concerned.\nTowards the end of the season, Valeria's project is revealed; forcefully summoning and opening Pandora's Box, unleashing hundreds of souls from &lt;a href=\"The%20Underworld\"&gt;The Underworld&lt;/a&gt; and malevolent spirits onto the island.\nAfter The Society's first defeat, &lt;a href=\"The%20Underground\"&gt;The Underground&lt;/a&gt; was disbanded, having completed its initial mission. However, Valeria's opening of &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt; incurred the wrath of the gods, causing &lt;a href=\"The%20Pantheon\"&gt;The Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; to arrive on the island and take down any remaining members of The Society. &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; had plans to end mortalkind, based on his worries of a prophecy in which his reign would end by the hands of a mortal. Hope worried about &lt;a href=\"The%20Pantheon\"&gt;The Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; and initially wanted to stay out of Zeus' conflict.\nHowever, she eventually realized The Underground was still needed to stop Zeus and anyone that could come after, prompting her to reform it and asking Jones to join her in the fight. Hope helped The Looper to win the final battle against Zeus, marking the &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Mount Olympus&lt;/a&gt; throne in her graffiti and The Underground's insignia to show their triumph.\nAfter the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Wasteland%20Warriors\"&gt;Wasteland Warriors&lt;/a&gt;, Hope decided to spring back into action and called up Jones so that he could ask The Looper for some help while the two of them gather intel about &lt;a href=\"Megalo%20Don\"&gt;Megalo Don&lt;/a&gt;'s shady plan. As they got recon around the Wastelands, Hope learned that the Warriors were in possession of gems from Pandora's Box, and was determined to get them out of circulation. \nShe tasked The Looper to help her get the gems, but when she got her hands on the first one, she was slammed by a continuous headache from the gem itself. As she gained more gems, they showed her prophetic visions of Megalo Don working with &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;a mysterious wanderer&lt;/a&gt;, promises of whatever she wanted, and occasionally nausea. When she got the last of the gems, &lt;a href=\"The%20Oracle\"&gt;The Oracle&lt;/a&gt; appeared to talk to her and act as her guide. After &lt;a href=\"Refinery%20Event\"&gt;the Redline Rig exploded&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wastelander%20Magneto\"&gt;Magneto&lt;/a&gt; met with Hope for a conversation. \nAfterward, The Oracle questioned her on why her connection to Pandora's Box didn't destroy her. Hope understood that what the Box showed her wasn't what would come to be if she gave in. Jones was confident Hope wouldn't give in, but The Oracle begs to differ. Hope was always meant to be intertwined with Pandora's Box, but with The Wanderer interfering, the course of her fate is now sealed with his and the Box itself couldn't just be closed to solve their problems. The Oracle presses that Hope has to fight The Wanderer, but she doesn't see herself in that position. The Oracle continues that she already has everything she needs to take a stand to win, and others would follow her stead to help.\nThe Wanderer revealed himself as &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt;, and took the powers of Pandora's Box to subsequently take over the &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;island&lt;/a&gt;. Hope suited up as a &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Hope\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt;, now with both The Looper's and Oracle's help and an army of Marvel heroes on her side; she began drafting plans to take down Doom's reign. When she learned that Doom was not on the island, she worked to find ways to lure him to the island and then defeat him.\nAfter fruitless research on the part of Jones and Hope, &lt;a href=\"Shuri\"&gt;Shuri&lt;/a&gt; came to them with the idea of \u200b\u200brecalibrating the previously decommissioned Rift Beacons left behind by Magneto to eject Doom from the island and send him back to . While setting up the recalibrators, Hope expressed her own self-doubt about being chosen by the Box as the prophecy's recipient, saying that she had no powers or wasn't a master tactician, but the most she could do was try. The Rift Recalibrator's first target would be &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Doom\"&gt;Castle Doom&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Doombot\"&gt;Doombot&lt;/a&gt; to serve as a test. However, when The Looper attacked the Doombot after Hope and The Underground cleared a path for them, the Rift Recalibrators didn't work as planned, leaving The Looper forced to destroy the Doombot by themselves. Hope and Shuri later discovered that Mysterio and Emma Frost tampered with the Recalibrators, which caused them to short-circuit. In order for them to try again, &lt;a href=\"Mysterio\"&gt;Mysterio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Emma%20Frost\"&gt;Emma Frost&lt;/a&gt; had to be neutralized, and Hope had decided Mysterio was first to go. \nAfter sending The Looper on various sabotage missions around &lt;a href=\"Doomstadt\"&gt;Doomstadt&lt;/a&gt; as well as saving people from Mysterio's grasp, she went to confront the villain along with The Looper and Jones, and defeated him. The Looper and Hope grafittied Doomstadt and the Doctor Doom statue to make their mark and irritate Doom.\nWhile The Looper was testing Stark Tech, Hope received power dampeners from Stark in order to reduce Emma Frost's telepathic abilities. After sending confidential instructions to The Looper, and having them place the power dampeners, Hope received an alarming call from Jones indicating the imminent arrival of Doom, whose Pandora Armor seems to have been finished, forcing The Looper to take down Emma Frost alone while she was having a panic attack. \nAfter weeks of preparing herself, the time had come for her to face Doom. Hope and her allies set up five &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Beacon\"&gt;Rift Beacons&lt;/a&gt; near the central lake, all positioned towards &lt;a href=\"Doom%27s%20Arcane%20Forge\"&gt;Doom's Arcane Forge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Peelverine\"&gt;Peelverine&lt;/a&gt;, who was left in charge, tasked The Looper with activating them to charge in preparation. \nAs the beacons finished charging up, Hope activated the rift, but the Forge was shielded by Doom's sudden presence, leaving it standing while unleashing a powerful energy burst that engulfed the surrounding area with a wall of debris. Slowly emerging from the dust as a giant, Doom swiftly annihilated almost everyone who opposed him in the area. With him flicking War Machine aside, Jones hurled his shield at Doom in an attempt to protect his friends, but it had no effect and Doom knocked him to the ground. With Doom poised to finish him off, Hope leaped into action, grabbing Jones' shield and shielding them both as he launched energy blasts at them, imbuing the shield with Pandora's power. In a bold move, Doom grabbed Hope, bringing her face-to-face with him. She hit him in the eye with the shield still charged with Pandora's magic, leaving Doom with a scar over his eye, enabling a weak point to suppress his physical immunity. Hope injured her own arm in the process. Her hero and Looper allies stood beside her, as they all rushed at Doom engaging in an epic battle. Ultimately the heroes and Loopers prevailed, managing to weaken Doom enough to activate the final rift beacon, stripping him of his Pandora's Box powers and sending him back to his home reality.\n&lt;a href=\"Chapter%202%20Remix\"&gt;Chapter 2 Remix&lt;/a&gt;.\nHope's &lt;a href=\"Audio%20Log\"&gt;Audio Logs&lt;/a&gt; are her messages to Valeria can be found in four locations across the remixed &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; island. They are assumed to be voicemails left for her sister during the story of Chapter 5, specifically onward, after Valeria fled the island. \nDuring the end of , Hope, Jones and &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; could be seen traveling to , with a fragment of the destroyed Zero Point following behind.\nHope and Jones would set up a small base in &lt;a href=\"Hopeful%20Heights\"&gt;Hopeful Heights&lt;/a&gt;, where they would begin to search the island for an artifact similar to Pandora's Box giving little and vague information to what they are looking for, while searching for this artifact Hope would meet &lt;a href=\"Kendo\"&gt;Kendo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jade\"&gt;Jade&lt;/a&gt;, sharing similar goals the three became allies with Hope and Kendo quickly becoming close friends. She would also strike a friendship with &lt;a href=\"Nyanja\"&gt;Nyanja&lt;/a&gt;, who has been helping her train her physical skills. Later &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; was sent to deliver demon essence to Hope by Kendo and Jade who have been investigating the invasion of oni, once given the essence she tells The Looper of her suspicions about the myths and magic emerging from the island suspecting that the demons must have a connection with the artifact they're searching for.\nExternal Links.\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\n=Voice=\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

However, make sure you have a disguise on, as being without a disguise will alert nearby henchmen.

He calibrates his &lt;a href=\"Portal%20Device\"&gt;Portal Device&lt;/a&gt; and throws it into The Zero Point, which somehow results in The Foundation's meteor being rifted onto the island. The Foundation emerges from his capsule and attacks Jones, head-butting him and kicking him into a rock. However, Jones manages to convince The Foundation to help stabilize &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for getting him to &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Sisters\"&gt;The Sisters&lt;/a&gt;. In the ensuing &lt;a href=\"Zero%20Crisis%20Finale\"&gt;Zero Crisis Finale&lt;/a&gt; event, The Foundation untangles and attempts to stabilize &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, as it periodically releases reality waves that randomly alter the very fabric of spacetime. However, The Foundation fails in stabilizing The Zero Point, so he decides to construct &lt;a href=\"The%20Spire\"&gt;The Spire&lt;/a&gt; to contain the implosion, sealing himself inside The Zero Point in the process. As this occurs The Zero Point sends out a final reality wave, sending the island back to primal times. Throughout the rest of the season, The Foundation remains sealed inside The Zero Point.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt; invades the island for The Zero Point. They use &lt;a href=\"The%20Mothership\"&gt;The Mothership&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the Spire, turning it into &lt;a href=\"The%20Aftermath\"&gt;The Aftermath&lt;/a&gt;. The aliens fail, and The Zero Point was pushed back into The Bridge. During this event, The Foundation was blasted out of The Zero Point into , The DC Universe, and thrown into an ocean. This was due to the the DC Universe being the last aligned reality the Zero Point had connected to, as shown in Batman/Fortnite: Zero Point Issue #6. \nHe explains the goal of The Seven, the origin of &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, and The IO's intentions to &lt;a href=\"Batman%20Zero\"&gt;Batman&lt;/a&gt; and helps him close the rift above Metropolis. He returns to the Island, barely escapes the Loop \"again\" because of &lt;a href=\"The%20Batman%20Who%20Laughs\"&gt;The Batman Who Laughs&lt;/a&gt; and began searching for &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28Chapter%202%29\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the cutscene after the &lt;a href=\"Rebooted%20Cube\"&gt;Rebooted Cube&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed, he saves &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt; from a torture device used by &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gunnar\"&gt;Gunnar&lt;/a&gt;, explaining he only did it cause Jones promised him &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt;. The two of them head to The Bridge, and he lends Jones his pistol to hold off &lt;a href=\"IO%20Guards\"&gt;incoming Reinforcements&lt;/a&gt; as they use the console to change the orientation of the island. After successfully doing so, he initiates phase two of his current plan, and calls in &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Visitor\"&gt;The Visitor&lt;/a&gt; to clear a path and guide the surviving &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;Loopers&lt;/a&gt; to The Bridge, while he and Jones finish of the rest of the IO Guards trying to stop them. As the island begins to rotate, the Loopers are successfully escorted to The Bridge, where they should be safe from &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion. The Foundation asks Jones about his pistol, to which Jones replies that he accidentally dropped it in the Zero Point. The Foundation then asks, \"Why does she make me keep saving you?\", implying that there is a female character that is making him save Jones. When a massive &lt;a href=\"Caretaker\"&gt;Caretaker&lt;/a&gt; destroys the skylight in The Bridge, The Foundation orders everyone to swim as they aree forced out into the ocean. \n&lt;a href=\"A%20New%20Day\"&gt;A New Day&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Foundation was seen sitting by a &lt;a href=\"Cozy%20Campfire\"&gt;Campfire&lt;/a&gt; with his current batch of saved Loopers, and explains his motivation and objective to destroy &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;The Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; to save &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; and escape &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor the rest of the season, The Foundation was seen patrolling the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; alongside the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Sentry\"&gt;Seven Sentries&lt;/a&gt; stationed there. He then tests &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; through a series of &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation%20Quests\"&gt;tests&lt;/a&gt; and recruited them into the team when they succeeded.\nDuring the trailer, it is shown that The Foundation is fighting with other Loopers, but when he tried to fight Gunnar for the second time, who gained the same hand ability as The Foundation, it ends with no clear winner with The Foundation escaping afterwards (proven by the fact that he is still at Sanctuary.)\n&lt;a href=\"Collision\"&gt;Collision&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Loopers\"&gt;Loopers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;Paradigm&lt;/a&gt; prepare for their assault on &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt;, The Foundation and &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt; infiltrate &lt;a href=\"The%20Collider\"&gt;The Collider&lt;/a&gt; to make the &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Strike%20Defender\"&gt;Mecha Str&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Strike%20Navigator\"&gt;ike Team&lt;/a&gt;'s mission easier. Clearing out enemy forces to disable all the shield generators, plus the four backups. While in contact with &lt;a href=\"The%20Origin\"&gt;The Origin&lt;/a&gt; he brings up The Foundation's suit being reinforced for Zero Point travel, hinting at whats to come later when the &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Strike%20Commander\"&gt;Mech&lt;/a&gt; gets on the island. Later on in the assault The Collider's shields somehow reactivated unbeknownst to them, and making work of it while The Mech approaches. After the Mech was trapped and forced underground by explosives hidden under the surface of The Collider, the team and Jones is pinned and ambushed by &lt;a href=\"IO%20Guards\"&gt;IO Forces&lt;/a&gt;. The Foundation power slams onto the ground where the IO Forces stood and blew off any cover in the way. Also taking out any remaining IO Guards. Fighting their way up The Collider's lower level a &lt;a href=\"B.R.U.T.E.\"&gt;B.R.U.T.E.&lt;/a&gt; blocked the way, however thanks to Jones' quick thinking he was able to distract it and gave The Foundation a perfect opportunity to bring it down with a nearby portable power generator. Finally reaching the top and seeing &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; get crushed by The Mech's arm, The Zero Point switched to the reality Geno was hiding in and viewed him leaving its view. This is his only chance to confront Geno, and not wanting to waste that chance The Foundation and Jones jump into The Zero Point in a hot pursuit.

Their mission was to steal Kado Thorne's Time Machine.\nThey serve as the main protagonists of .\nOverview.\nThe Heist Crew is a group of skilled robbers recruited by &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; to steal Kado Thorne's Time Machine, so that she could subsequently send Jones into the past to create a second Big Bang and allow the creation of new realities in the future. All of this being made in order for Asteria's inhabitant to make their escape and find new home. The three original members of the crew were Nolan Chance, Antonia and The Looper, all three directly employed by &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt;. The three of them then gathered a crew by recruiting members each specialized in a field.\nLocations and Members.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nAlly.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nHistory.\nDoctor Slone called on Nolan Chance, an experienced robber, as well as The Looper to rob Eclipsed Estate and recover Thorne's Time Machine. Antonia, a thief also known as Masque, was also recruited by &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt;, her goal being to steal Nolan's job after what he did to her during their last heist together. They set up their &lt;a href=\"The%20Getaway%20%28Landmark%29\"&gt;base&lt;/a&gt; at Frenzy Fields. Nolan Chance first tested The Looper's abilities, after which The Looper officially joined the group, but Antonia tried to convince The Looper to follow her plan. After that, Nolan revealed the whole mission to The Looper, revealing to them that they needed to recruit new talent for the crew, however it turned out to be a dismal failure as &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Daraku\"&gt;Countess Daraku&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arctic%20Assassin\"&gt;Arctic Assassin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Peely\"&gt;Agent Peely&lt;/a&gt; refused, so Nolan had to turn to his \"probably still angry old crew\".\nNolan asked The Looper to gain the attention of Piper Pace, Nolan's former getaway driver. After gaining her attention and convincing her, Piper Pace joined the Crew and helped The Looper get Nolan to reconcile with Antonia by stealing a very valuable ring from Kado Thorne. Once the theft was completed, The Looper gave it to Antonia in Nolan's name, with a card that had \"Antonia, I'm very very very very very sorry\" written on it. It worked surprisingly for Piper Pace, as it caused Antonia to realign herself with Nolan.\nLater, Nolan had The Looper recruit Fish Thicc, Triggerfish's cousin. However, he refused, because he had to train the Coral Buddies who had previously been kidnapped by Turk and Riptide. The Looper and Nolan therefore established a trick to force Fish Thicc to join the crew by making him owe a debt to them. After that, Fish Thicc and Nolan established the group's absolutely necessary last member, the Hacker Mae. They gave tips to The Looper to try to gain her attention, which was difficult, but once they were completed, Mae asked The Looper a favor, particularly about the Chrono-cells and how they worked, knowing full well that Thorne had something sinister planned. After being able to steal some from Thorne and determining how they work, she decided to join the Crew, hiding what Chrono-cells really were. Infiltration expert Khaby Lame also joined the Crew as the last member to make sure the plan goes as planned.\nIn their first attempt, the crew successfully infiltrated Eclipsed Estate and disabled both vault doors, stealing additional items from the first vault, including Midas' Drum Gun. However, Kado Thorne stopped them by taking his Revenant form and trying to eliminate them. However Throne was stopped, likely by &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; and allowed the crew to escape. Thorne then remained inside the Inner Sanctum in his revenant form to protect his Time Machine himself, whose next destination was set at \"2018 07 12\". Following the call of &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; returned to The Island, and collaborated with her and the crew. \nIn the meantime, The Looper went on various solo missions, including helping &lt;a href=\"Triarch%20Aurora\"&gt;Triarch Aurora&lt;/a&gt; track down &lt;a href=\"Triarch%20Nox\"&gt;Triarch Nox&lt;/a&gt;, helping the High Stakes Club and Victoria Saint kill Countess Daraku, and working with Shimmerdusk by destroying all of Thorne's protection systems, robbing the vaults of Sanguine Suite and Relentless Retreat, eliminating his henchmen and destroying his luxury stuff, gradually leaving him defenseless and causing him to lose his calm . The Heist Crew later took the opportunity to steal his Time Machine and took it to Frenzy Field where they started to study it with &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; for her plan. The machine started to bring back stuff from \"2018 07 12\". However, with Shimmerdusk, The Looper set out to eliminate the vampire once and for all, definitively putting an end to the threat posed by Kado Thorne.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

She was first introduced in the cinematic trailer of . She was the one responsible for causing &lt;a href=\"Chrome\"&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt; to spread around &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;the island&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe is a major antagonist of , serving as the main antagonist of &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/a&gt;'s second half.\nTimeline.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Loopers\"&gt;Loopers&lt;/a&gt; celebrated the victory over the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt;, The Herald began watching the Island, more specifically, the &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Tree\"&gt;Reality Tree&lt;/a&gt;, a tree using the energy of the recently released &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;. As &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt; was on an impending doom, The Zero Point started bringing in a lot of powerful artifacts from many realities in an attempts to warn everyone on the Island of the upcoming danger. The Herald later arrived, and started to &lt;a href=\"Chrome\"&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt; eastern part the Island, chroming &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Order\"&gt;The Order&lt;/a&gt; in the process. The remaining members of &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Visitor\"&gt;The Visitor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Origin\"&gt;The Origin&lt;/a&gt; tried to study the Chrome, with The Origin designing battle plans against his former colleague.\nDuring their study, a sample of Chrome broke free and The Origin, The Scientist, and The Visitor were consumed by it, before The Herald use it to build her own body and laugh at Paradigm, who was cornered by Chrome. However The Paradigm managed to escape by flying and started to head toward &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;. In the meantime The Herald would set up her chrome fortress over the now abandonned &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Herald%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Herald's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. From her new base, she continued to observe the &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Tree\"&gt;Reality Tree&lt;/a&gt;, making the Chrome from the eastern part of the Island heading toward it, while at the same time making Chrome emerge from all the &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Saplings\"&gt;Reality Saplings&lt;/a&gt; that emerged from the roots of the Reality Tree all around the Island.\n&lt;a href=\"Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; later informs &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"The%20Origin\"&gt;The Origin&lt;/a&gt; had planned on launching an attack on The Herald. &lt;a href=\"AMIE\"&gt;AMIE&lt;/a&gt; stated that it was a stupid idea but dangerous and beneficial to the Island so she decided The Looper should do it anyways. The Looper went to Herald's Sanctum and defeated The Herald in battle however this did not stop the expansion of Chrome as they were incapable of killing her as The Herald herself is made out of Chrome and so she can recreate her body endlessly. Later The Paradigm made it clear to Jones, AMIE and The Looper that there was no way to win and that Reality was going to end, no matter what they do, but however she had a plan to save people.\n&lt;a href=\"Fracture\"&gt;Fracture&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Herald used a Chrome Tornado to transport herself to the &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Tree\"&gt;Reality Tree&lt;/a&gt; There she seemed to be unfazed by the many bullets and pellets being fired at her by the little resistance left. Her chrome body was ultimately destroyed by a barrage of rockets, the Loopers protecting the Reality Tree started to celebrate while the Herald reformed herself and turned into a larger chrome version of herself. She then quickly chromed the &lt;a href=\"Loopers\"&gt;Loopers&lt;/a&gt; and the Reality Tree by slamming her hand on them. Once she had eliminated the Loopers, she fused into the Reality Tree and destroyed Reality Zero, leaving the Zero Point alone. After the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt;, The Paradigm asked Amie and The Looper to find the Zero Fragments in order to restore the Zero Point's energy and initiate the Zero Fusion. During the process the Reality Tree merged with the giant form of The Herald was picked up by Zero Point and shrunk. After the Zero Point has recovered all its energy, Paradigm triggered the Zero Fusion which created a whole new Reality Zero with a new island: &lt;a href=\"Asteria\"&gt;Asteria&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe remnant of the Reality Tree fused with The Herald giant form was there, on Astaria. Now known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Herald%20Tree\"&gt;The Herald Tree&lt;/a&gt;, it seperated all three biomes. Some time later, after sending test subject (AIs in vessels) through test rifts during tests involving Rift Gates, AMIE and The Looper found by accident the Reality where all people chromed by The Herald were sent. They discovered that all chromed people were suffering a fate worse than death, by having their existence rewritten by &lt;a href=\"The%20Nothing\"&gt;The Nothing&lt;/a&gt;. \nReferences.\n=Voice=\nBoss Voice.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The song describes her plan for the club during the later &lt;a href=\"The%20Eclipse\"&gt;eclipse&lt;/a&gt;, telling how she knows they will meet under a red sky, and how she looks forward to lowering her fangs on a burning heartbeat.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"The%20Eclipse\"&gt;blood moon eclipse&lt;/a&gt; nearing, Starfang puts her plan into action. She announces another concert and resides at &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Watch\"&gt;Eastern Watch&lt;/a&gt;, where her fans come to see her. She tells the club about how she is overjoyed her music has helped them cope with their lives. She is even more shocked to learn &lt;a href=\"Helsie\"&gt;Helsie&lt;/a&gt; has all of her albums.\nIn anticipation for the concert, The High Stakes Club all adorn new outfits and give themselves temporary names for the concert: &lt;a href=\"Joni%20the%20Scarlet\"&gt;Joni the Scarlet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Huntress%20Helsie\"&gt;Huntress Helsie&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Formal%20Lucien%20West\"&gt;Formal Lucien West&lt;/a&gt;. They adorn new weapons resembling the originals in design and functionality.\nSometime before or during the concert Starfang drops her act, revealing herself as &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Daraku\"&gt;Countess Daraku&lt;/a&gt;: An ancient cunning vampire who loves to play with her prey and often targets her fans. Her reveal sends &lt;a href=\"Joni%20the%20Red\"&gt;Joni&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kenjutsu%20Crossing\"&gt;Kenjutsu Crossing&lt;/a&gt; where she meets &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Saint\"&gt;Victoria Saint&lt;/a&gt;. Victoria mentions how she is on a quest to eliminate Daraku. Joni joins her and becomes her prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Joni now wants nothing more than to stop Countess Daraku. \n&lt;a href=\"Countess%20Daraku\"&gt;Countess Daraku&lt;/a&gt; begins toying with the club. She belittles &lt;a href=\"Joni%20the%20Red\"&gt;Joni's&lt;/a&gt; monster hunting ability. She makes &lt;a href=\"Helsie\"&gt;Helsie&lt;/a&gt; double guess if she has what it takes to face the darkness. She makes &lt;a href=\"Lucien%20West\"&gt;Lucien&lt;/a&gt; doubt his ability to protect his friends. Joni tells Daraku that she ruined her favorite album forever and that she really is a monster.&lt;a href=\"Shimmerdusk\"&gt;Shimmerdusk&lt;/a&gt; arrives on the Island to continue her hunt on &lt;a href=\"Kado%20Thorne\"&gt;Kado Thorne&lt;/a&gt;. Shimmerdusk tells &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Saint\"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt; she hopes she learns as much from teaching &lt;a href=\"Joni%20the%20Red\"&gt;Joni&lt;/a&gt; as she did teaching her. &lt;a href=\"Helsie\"&gt;Helsie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lucien%20West\"&gt;Lucien&lt;/a&gt; go to &lt;a href=\"Windcatch%20Lake\"&gt;Windcatch Lake&lt;/a&gt; to meet Shimmerdusk. She tells them that monster hunters hunt alone and Joni will have to choose between her friends and true hunt. \nFortnitemares.\n&lt;a href=\"Helsie\"&gt;Helsie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lucien%20West\"&gt;Lucien&lt;/a&gt; ignore &lt;a href=\"Shimmerdusk\"&gt;Shimmerdusk&lt;/a&gt;'s warning, with Helsie writing a very glittery letter to &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Saint\"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt; telling her to meet them at &lt;a href=\"Woodsy%20Ward\"&gt;Woodsy Ward&lt;/a&gt;. Helsie and Lucien also invite &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; due to their combat abilities. With everyone gathered, Victoria Saint decides to go against her teacher and adopt Helsie and Lucien as prot\u00e9g\u00e9s too. Whilst training, &lt;a href=\"Joni%20the%20Red\"&gt;Joni&lt;/a&gt; rigs up her new &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Stake%20Shotgun\"&gt;Wood Stake Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Stakes%27%20Shotgun\"&gt;High Stakes' Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;. The club trains each other and &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; under Victoria's guidance in the ways of monster hunting. The Looper shows great signs of promise and takes up the skill naturally. The High Stakes Club, &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Saint\"&gt;Victoria Saint&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; have completed their training and are now ready to challenge &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Daraku\"&gt;Countess Daraku&lt;/a&gt;. They go to &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Watch\"&gt;Eastern Watch&lt;/a&gt; and challenge her to a duel. She is defeated thanks to the help of &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;. After the hunt of a lifetime, The High Stakes Club agrees that it's time to take a step back and figure out what comes next. They rest beside a campfire reflecting on their journey together.\nThe High Stakes Club returned to , their homeworld, alongside the island of &lt;a href=\"Oninoshima\"&gt;Oninoshima&lt;/a&gt;. \nA shard of the destroyed &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; falls through a rift alongside &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vengeance%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;, causing &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Warriors\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; to roam free across the island. &lt;a href=\"Helsie\"&gt;Helsie&lt;/a&gt; stays at &lt;a href=\"Canyon%20Crossing\"&gt;Canyon Crossing&lt;/a&gt; where she tells &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; about the club's current status.&lt;a href=\"Helsie\"&gt;Helsie&lt;/a&gt; shares her excitement of seeing actual magic with &lt;a href=\"Joni%20the%20Red\"&gt;Joni&lt;/a&gt; and tells &lt;a href=\"Lucien%20West\"&gt;Lucien&lt;/a&gt; to remember to take care of himself. &lt;a href=\"Jade\"&gt;Jade&lt;/a&gt;, an old friend of Helsie's, reconnects after sometime apart. Helsie offers the club's services to help &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; find an artifact similar to &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Minato%20Hakaru\"&gt;Minato Hakaru&lt;/a&gt;, an old friend of &lt;a href=\"Joni%20the%20Red\"&gt;Joni&lt;/a&gt;'s and a monstrous monster hunter, is made known to the club as one of its members. &lt;a href=\"Helsie\"&gt;Helsie&lt;/a&gt; informs Minato of Joni's lack of trust towards him, unsure of the reasoning herself.\n&lt;a href=\"Joni%20the%20Red\"&gt;Joni&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Helsie\"&gt;Helsie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lucien%20West\"&gt;Lucien&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly &lt;a href=\"Minato%20Hakaru\"&gt;Minato&lt;/a&gt; are residents of - evidently attending . On campus, the club seems to share a bedroom with their peers. Just outside their room - across the hall, Lucien's plush wolf: &lt;a href=\"Lil%20Louie\"&gt;Lil Louie&lt;/a&gt;, sits on a shelf. Inside the room resides a drum kit and several beds.\nAt , the club serve as bobaristas, with &lt;a href=\"Helsie\"&gt;Helsie&lt;/a&gt; overseeing and running the caf\u00e9. When interacted with, she may share various thoughts, such as a desire to form a band but being torn between whether she should be the singer or the drummer. \nBeneath lies the club's hidden room, where &lt;a href=\"Joni%20the%20Red\"&gt;Joni&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lucien%20West\"&gt;Lucien&lt;/a&gt; are located. To unlock the room, &lt;a href=\"Lil%20Louie\"&gt;Lil Louie&lt;/a&gt; must be brought to the back of the caf\u00e9 - and placed by the wall. Inside, &lt;a href=\"Joni%20the%20Red\"&gt;Joni&lt;/a&gt; mentions her want for to serve red ice cream, while &lt;a href=\"Lucien%20West\"&gt;Lucien&lt;/a&gt; daydreams about hypothetical questions.

But after his staunchest comrade &lt;a href=\"The%20Prisoner\"&gt;The Prisoner&lt;/a&gt; argued to use the items for bad purposes, the Ice King froze him as well as the other knights and his fortresses to keep the omniverse safe. He then teleported his &lt;a href=\"the%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt; to Reality Zero and froze himself to sleep forever.\nHe is a major character in serving as the main protagonist of &lt;a href=\"Season%207\"&gt;Season 7&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Season%208\"&gt;Season 8&lt;/a&gt;. \nPowers and Abilities.\nThe Ice King is an extremely powerful being who has absolute control over ice. He is powerful enough to defeat and freeze &lt;a href=\"The%20Prisoner\"&gt;The Prisoner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer\"&gt;The Devourer&lt;/a&gt;. His Ice powers are so powerful that &lt;a href=\"Thor\"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Storm\"&gt;Storm&lt;/a&gt; can barely dampen his Ice Storm. He is also able to summon ice monsters called the Ice Legion, capable of rivaling Hybrids.\nHistory.\nBefore Chapter 1.\nAges ago, the Ice King and his brave allies began collecting items of power: things and beings too dangerous too exist. But &lt;a href=\"The%20Prisoner\"&gt;The Prisoner&lt;/a&gt;, the Ice King's staunchest comrade wanted to use these items to alter &lt;a href=\"The%20Omniverse\"&gt;Realities&lt;/a&gt; to their liking. The Ice King was forced to freeze the Prisoner, his knights and all he had acquired within his fortress. He brought &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt;, a place he thought to be isolated and safe.\nPre-Season 7.\nIn a cosmic storm, a fragment of The Ice Moon broke away and crashed into &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;the island&lt;/a&gt;'s ocean and drifts until it reaches the island at the start of &lt;a href=\"Season%207\"&gt;Season 7&lt;/a&gt;. Later in &lt;a href=\"Season%207\"&gt;Season 7&lt;/a&gt;, the ice in Polar Peak's dungeon begins to melt and threatens to let &lt;a href=\"The%20Prisoner\"&gt;The Prisoner&lt;/a&gt; escape.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%207\"&gt;Season 7&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo stop the Prisoner from causing chaos, The Ice King modified a shard of &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube\"&gt;The Cube&lt;/a&gt;, and used it to unleash the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Storm\"&gt;Ice Storm&lt;/a&gt; and summon the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Legion\"&gt;Ice Legion&lt;/a&gt;, an army of Ice Monsters, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Cube%20Monsters\"&gt;Cube Monsters&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Queen\"&gt;The Ice Queen&lt;/a&gt; seems to have been helping The Ice King. However this was in vain, as the Prisoner manages to escape and takes the eggs of the Hybrids with him and recover his powers. The Ice Legion was defeated.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%208\"&gt;Season 8&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ice King and the Prisoner continued their war and in an attempt to defeat the Ice King, the Prisoner erupted his volcano, destroying\n&lt;a href=\"Tilted%20Towers\"&gt;Tilted Towers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Retail%20Row\"&gt;Retail Row&lt;/a&gt;, and damaging &lt;a href=\"Polar%20Peak\"&gt;Polar Peak&lt;/a&gt; (which later led to &lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer\"&gt;The Devourer&lt;/a&gt; being awoken in &lt;a href=\"Season%209\"&gt;Season 9&lt;/a&gt;. The castle was carried on the monster's back and was destroyed in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"The%20Final%20Showdown\"&gt;The Final Showdown&lt;/a&gt;). Soon after, the Ice King defeated the Prisoner and imprisoned him in eternal ice and threw him into the water\n&lt;a href=\"Season%209\"&gt;Season 9&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Devourer escaped and threatened Zero Point, and his defeat against &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Mecha Team Leader&lt;/a&gt;, the Ice King returned to the Ice Moon, feeling guilty for having failed in his duty. He made &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt; totally inhospitable to all beings, living or unliving, in an attempt to isolate it permanently.\nWhile looking for &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Doom\"&gt;Doctor Doom&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shuri\"&gt;Shuri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wolverine%20Zero\"&gt;Wolverine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Imagined\"&gt;The Imagined&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spider-Man%20Zero\"&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/a&gt; come across the Ice King's castle.

After The Prisoner expressed the desire to use the artifacts for evil purposes and attempted to convince the Ice King and the others, The Ice King imprisoned The Ice King, freezing all of his artifacts and beings as well as his knights, and himself to protect the Omniverse.\nOverview.\nThe Ice Kingdom is an order of knights, with the goal of collecting items across &lt;a href=\"The%20Omniverse\"&gt;The Omniverse&lt;/a&gt; that are deemed too dangerous to exist. After &lt;a href=\"The%20Prisoner\"&gt;The Prisoner&lt;/a&gt; tried to convince everyone to use artifacts and beings to alter realities to their liking, &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20King\"&gt;The Ice King&lt;/a&gt; froze him with all the other knights. However after a cosmic storm that which tore off part of The Ice Moon, including Polar Peak Castle, which crashed onto the island, The Prisoner freed himself and formed his own &lt;a href=\"The%20Fire%20Kingdom\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, the two factions became rivals, until the fall of &lt;a href=\"The%20Fire%20Kingdom\"&gt;The Fire Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; following the Prisoner's defeat. After the death of &lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer\"&gt;The Devourer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20King\"&gt;The Ice King&lt;/a&gt; returned on the Ice Moon and made it unlivable for all being in order to avoid anyone to get their hands on the dangerous artifacts and beings on it.\nLocations and Members.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nIce Legion.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nHistory.\nBefore Chapter 1.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20King%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;The Ice King&lt;/a&gt; and his brave knights resided on &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt;, collecting items and beings of power deemed too dangerous to exist. But one day, The King's staunchiest comrade, &lt;a href=\"The%20Prisoner\"&gt;The Prisoner&lt;/a&gt;, came up with the idea of using those items to alter and conquer Realities as they want. This led to The King freezing the Prisoner, his knights, their collection and their fortresses on the Ice Moon. He then brought it to &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt;, where he believed it would be isolated and safe. He turned the ice upon himself, in an attempt to cause an eternal slumber.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%206\"&gt;Season 6&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn a cosmic storm, a piece of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt;, known as &lt;a href=\"Polar%20Peak\"&gt;Polar Peak&lt;/a&gt;, broke off and landed in the ocean of the &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena island&lt;/a&gt;. It appeared from the southwest of the Island, getting closer.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%207\"&gt;Season 7&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the snow melted and the Ice King woke up, he modified a shard of &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube\"&gt;The Cube&lt;/a&gt;, and used it to unleash the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Storm\"&gt;Ice Storm&lt;/a&gt; and summon the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Legion\"&gt;Ice Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Along with his &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Queen\"&gt;Queen&lt;/a&gt;, they guarded the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Biome\"&gt;Snow Biome&lt;/a&gt;. However this was in vain, as The Prisoner managed to escape his chains, taking with him the eggs of the Hybrids, recover his powers and The Ice Legion was defeated.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%208\"&gt;Season 8&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ice King and his forces fight against &lt;a href=\"The%20Prisoner\"&gt;The Prisoner&lt;/a&gt;'s army to prevent him unleashing worse dangers. In their final duel, The King defeated the Fire King and freezes him underwater for eternity. But ultimately he failed in his duty as The Prisoner was able to make his Volcano erupt, hitting &lt;a href=\"Retail%20Row\"&gt;Retail Row&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tilted%20Towers\"&gt;Tilted Towers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Polar%20Peak\"&gt;Polar Peak&lt;/a&gt;, which led to a deadlier menace breaking free.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%209\"&gt;Season 9&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith Polar Peak melting, &lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer\"&gt;The Devourer&lt;/a&gt; lets loose and the King returns to his Moon in shame and defeat, causing deadly snowstorms to wipe out all beings, living or unliving to isolate his castle and prevent anything else from accessing it. The Devourer itself would be stopped by &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Singularity\"&gt;Singularity&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Mech&lt;/a&gt;built by &lt;a href=\"The%20Government\"&gt;The Government&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;I.O.&lt;/a&gt;.\n\nWhile Thor and Storm were struggling to alleviate the weather conditions of the Ice Moon so that The Seven could repair the Mech, Doom as well as Jones' team went onto the frozen moon. After finding a castle, Jones' team entered inside after seeing that the vibranium door that sealed it was melted by Doom, thanks to the Zero Shard. Inside they found themselves facing The Ice King, asleep on his throne. As they advanced, Jones activated a trap and a projection of The Ice King appeared in front of them, greeting them and congratulating them on making it this far. After explaining his story he revealed to them that their presence on his moon proved that they were too dangerous for the Omniverse, The Ice King then intensified his ice power, to make the conditions on the moon even worse and trap them permanently. The heroes would escape his trap, and The Kingdom remains frozen. \nThe piece of the Ice Moon arrives on the Island, but The Ice King and The Prisoner are nowhere to be found. The Polar Peak Castle is gone and &lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer\"&gt;The Devourer&lt;/a&gt; seems to have already broken free from the iceberg by the time of its arrival."}

Her suit is teal with red and gray plating.\nTimeline.\nBefore Chapter 1.\n&lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt; created The Sisters and genetically modified them to be as perfect as possible, as the Imagined Order are on a hunt for the perfect civilization. Thanks to Geno's skills in science and biology, the Sisters and himself are immortal. &lt;a href=\"The%20Omniverse\"&gt;The Omniverse&lt;/a&gt; was the playground of the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;IO&lt;/a&gt;, but Geno decided to throw the Sisters into &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt;, betting that they would be the first to escape. They weren't though, making Geno replace them with one of their more stronger &lt;a href=\"Snapshots\"&gt;Snapshots&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe arrived on &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt; in along with &lt;a href=\"The%20Origin\"&gt;The Origin&lt;/a&gt;, assisting the Resistance in the war against the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt;.

She appears to be one of the members of The Seven that trusts &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt;, with the other being The Scientist. Later in the season, she tricks &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; into giving her information on the Imagined Order's file system during a party, potentially in an attempt to find out more about herself. The files for both her and &lt;a href=\"The%20Order\"&gt;her sister&lt;/a&gt; have been wiped from the system by &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe joins &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spider-Man%20Zero\"&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; to infiltrate &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, later being ambushed by &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gunnar\"&gt;Gunnar&lt;/a&gt;.

They are attacked by &lt;a href=\"Hybrid%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Hybrids&lt;/a&gt; and follow one to their base that gets blown up. They track more Hybrids and prepare a camp for the night. Imagined gets close with Wolverine, telling her backstory and origins to him. She says she likes who Wolverine is, giving him a kiss. Next day, they reach &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Amarvel%3AHerbert%20Wyndham%20%28Earth-616%29\"&gt;High Evolutionary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stegron\"&gt;Stegron&lt;/a&gt;'s laboratory. The group distracts Evolutionary and Stegron as Spider-Man sneaks into the lab to steal the Zero Shard. He meets &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Doom\"&gt;Doctor Doom&lt;/a&gt; inside who escapes with a portal. They stop fighting and Evolutionary lets them get away to chase Doom. They end up on &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20King%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;The Ice King&lt;/a&gt;'s castle. They go inside but Jones accidentally triggers a hologram of the Ice King that congratulates them for reaching him. The holgoram tells them they are too dangerous to left alive so the group runs away. Imagined gets attacked by Doom and get in a fight with Doom. He beats them but Spider-Man steals the Zero Shard and uses it to power the &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Mecha Team Leader&lt;/a&gt;. Doom gets away and the Mecha carries the team to &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Collision\"&gt;Collision&lt;/a&gt; /.\nAs the attack on &lt;a href=\"The%20Collider\"&gt;The Collider&lt;/a&gt; starts, The Imagined notices &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt; on an upper platform, firing an energy beam at &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Man%20Zero\"&gt;Iron Man&lt;/a&gt;, causing him to crash. She calls &lt;a href=\"The%20Order\"&gt;The Order&lt;/a&gt; to help her, telling that \"daddy's home\". &lt;a href=\"The%20Sisters\"&gt;The Sisters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wolverine%20Zero\"&gt;Wolverine&lt;/a&gt; climb up The Collider and blast near Geno where they get into a fight. Geno doesn't kill the sisters and rather shows mercy, but The Order kicks him making all of them fall and hold on to the platform. The Imagined sacrifices herself and jumps into &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, taking Geno with her.

It has 4 levels and the overground.\nOn each level except the boss level, players need to find a Shadow Key, and are required to destroy 3 (Overground only) or 4 Monoliths for a Husk Key, to advance to the next level while eliminating &lt;a href=\"Monsters%20%28Save%20The%20World%29\"&gt;Monsters&lt;/a&gt; and avoiding dungeon traps and hazards.\nPlayers cannot craft weapons and traps, instead they must find them by breaking glowing objects and searching Chests. \nWhen a player loses all their &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Save%20the%20World%29\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;, they turn into a Ghost (similar to the effects of a &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Stone\"&gt;Shadow Stone&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Royale\"&gt;Battle Royale&lt;/a&gt;). The downed players need to be revived at a Cursed Statue, which can only be used once per level. A Cursed Statue is able to revive multiple players at once. If all players become a Ghost, or if a Solo player dies and there are no unused Cursed Statues, the mission fails.\nBoss Level.\nThe final level of The Lab has a boss battle, where players are required to eliminate &lt;a href=\"Hyde\"&gt;Hyde&lt;/a&gt;. Hyde has high damage-resistance which makes eliminating him a challenge. Players can reduce his damage-resistance stat by adding 3 &lt;a href=\"BluGlo\"&gt;BluGlo&lt;/a&gt;, only obtained from Incubation Tubes, to a Coil. There are a total of 5 Coils around the arena. Hyde wields a &lt;a href=\"Husk%20Grinder\"&gt;Husk Grinder&lt;/a&gt; and throws projectiles similar to the &lt;a href=\"Lobber\"&gt;Lobber&lt;/a&gt;, except they apply a slowing effect to the player for a few seconds and damage them twice per second. Once &lt;a href=\"Hyde\"&gt;Hyde&lt;/a&gt; is eliminated, he will disintegrate, leading to a Victory.\nGallery.\n= Audio =\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The Army of the Last Reality is a group of aliens of different species, monsters, demons, artificial intelligences, supernatural entities and cosmic entities who all share the common goal of destroying all realities of the Omniverse to revert it back to &lt;a href=\"The%20Nothing\"&gt;Nothing&lt;/a&gt;. They operate under an imperialist regime, but with several rulers.\nThey are the main antagonists of &lt;a href=\"Fortnite\"&gt;Fortnite&lt;/a&gt;, serving as:\nOverview.\nAlthough they all have different reasons for doing so, the common goal of all its members is to destroy every reality in &lt;a href=\"The%20Omniverse\"&gt;The Omniverse&lt;/a&gt;. Their members can be recruited by any of the different subfactions, but some are recruited by &lt;a href=\"The%20Nothing\"&gt;The Nothing&lt;/a&gt; itself, the primordial entity in existence before the birth of &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, the latter being one of their main targets for unspecified reasons. As of , it was revealed &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed but its unclear if they're behind this or not.\nThe Aliens.\nThe Army of the Last Reality is composed of an untold number of alien species, with entire alien ecosystems in their hands. They notably use their very advanced technology to create weapons, &lt;a href=\"Saucer\"&gt;vehicles&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"Trespassers\"&gt;soldiers&lt;/a&gt;, all powered by The Cubes' dark power, giving them a near-limitless amount of energy. In addition to this, the aliens study the species they encounter and their technology, in order to continually improve their own. This results in an extremely powerful and mobile military force that can invade hundreds of realities in short period of time, with just one of the countless Motherships largely outgunning the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt;. They are ruled by &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%20Queen\"&gt;The Cube Queen&lt;/a&gt;. Captured prisoners on the Mothership are subjected to experiments.\nThe Cube Legion.\nIn addition to the alien military forces, there is the Cube Legion. The main members are the countless &lt;a href=\"Corruption%20Cubes\"&gt;Corruption&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Cube\"&gt;Golden&lt;/a&gt; Cubes created by &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%20Queen\"&gt;The Cube Queen&lt;/a&gt; and The Cube King and which are placed in very large quantities inside Motherships as well as the Cube's Cradle, the main ship of The Last Reality's fleet. They serve both as energy source for The Aliens but also as an additional military force as they can summon monsters from &lt;a href=\"The%20Sideways\"&gt;The Sideways&lt;/a&gt; or create their own to serve as soldiers. In case an Alien Mothership fail its invasion and crashes like it happened in and , The Cube Legion will act on by themselve. If they have accumulated enough energy they can open a portal to summon the entire Alien armada in addition to the Sideways monsters or evolve into an army of Storm Kings and summon &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt;. Cubes can also corrupt certain powerful people like &lt;a href=\"Cube%20Assassin\"&gt;Cube Assassin&lt;/a&gt; and make them join The Cube Legion as well as create dark reflexions of people. Some Cubes can be sent alone to destroy Realities, as it happened with &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20the%20Cube\"&gt;Kevin the Cube&lt;/a&gt;. The Cube Legion attempted to destroy &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt; along with The Aliens, which &lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28Chapter%202%29\"&gt;ended unsuccessfully&lt;/a&gt;. \nStorm King's Acolytes.\nBeside the Cube Monsters from the Cube Legion and other Storm Monsters that Storm Kings can summon, they also have their own forces known as the Storm King's Acolytes or simply as Storm Acolytes. This fanatic faction is composed of beings that are much more evolved versions of Cube Monsters as well as people empowered by the Storm King. Their Elite units were granted special abilities by the Storm Kings.\nOthers.\nIt seems that there are also other parts of the Army of the Last Reality that are not very well known, such as The Nothing's envoys, including &lt;a href=\"The%20Herald\"&gt;The Herald&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bytes\"&gt;Bytes&lt;/a&gt; who are not affiliated with either of the three previously mentioned subgroups (although they are actively collaborating). They managed to destroy &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt; by themselves during &lt;a href=\"Fracture\"&gt;Fracture&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough The Last Reality has multiple subfactions, it is not uncommon for members to be part of multiple subfactions at once. \nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%205\"&gt;Season 5&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"Corruption%20Cubes\"&gt;Corruption Cube&lt;/a&gt; was sent by The Army of Last Reality to the Island via a &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;Sideways Rift&lt;/a&gt;. It began rolling and creating &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Area\"&gt;Glyphs&lt;/a&gt;. It later made its way into &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt; and dissolved within it.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%206\"&gt;Season 6&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecharged with energy, the Cube rose from Loot Lake, taking a &lt;a href=\"Floating%20Island\"&gt;chunk of land&lt;/a&gt; with it, and exposing the location of &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;. The Cube Island begins travelling above &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; and took power from the Glyphs it had previously created to gain even more power. It returned to Loot Lake and then injected its energy into The Storm, unleashing an explosion which sent hordes of &lt;a href=\"Monsters%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;Cube Monsters&lt;/a&gt; to the Island. From there, the &lt;a href=\"Loopers\"&gt;Loopers&lt;/a&gt; fought the Cube and attacked it relentlessly, damaging it little by little. During a final battle between the &lt;a href=\"Loopers\"&gt;Loopers&lt;/a&gt; and the Cube Monsters, the Cube exploded.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%20X\"&gt;Season X&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; used a &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Beacon\"&gt;Rift Beacon&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Mega%20Mall\"&gt;Mega Mall&lt;/a&gt;, which brought a version of &lt;a href=\"Retail%20Row\"&gt;Retail Row&lt;/a&gt; from an alternate reality filled with Cube Monsters. He uses another Rift Beacon on &lt;a href=\"Fatal%20Fields\"&gt;Fatal Fields&lt;/a&gt; which brought an alternate reality version of Kevin the Cube in a different &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Floating Island&lt;/a&gt;.\n\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Fortnitemares%202019\"&gt;Fortnitemares 2019&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Storm%20King\"&gt;Storm King&lt;/a&gt; found the &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt;, corrupting the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20Land\"&gt;Eye Land&lt;/a&gt; which became &lt;a href=\"Isle%20Of%20The%20Storm\"&gt;Isle Of The Storm&lt;/a&gt; and taking control of &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt;, summoning &lt;a href=\"Cube%20Monsters\"&gt;Cube Monsters&lt;/a&gt;. However &lt;a href=\"Loopers\"&gt;Loopers&lt;/a&gt; defeated this Storm King and &lt;a href=\"Eye%20Land\"&gt;Eye Land&lt;/a&gt; reverted back to its original state.\n\nA long time after the construction of The Spire, it became corrupted by an unknown force and began killing people who ventured too close or giving them more power, but corrupting them by exploiting their weaknesses.\n&lt;a href=\"Raz\"&gt;Raz&lt;/a&gt; gets corrupted through a Spire Artifact, which was a fragment of the heart of The Spire itself. Raz became so powerful that he attracted unwanted attention, by guiding a Mothership directly to the Island. An unknown type of Kymera ship starts to randomly &lt;a href=\"Abduction\"&gt;abduct&lt;/a&gt; Players. Crop Circles with the logo of The Army of the Last Reality appear in &lt;a href=\"Colossal%20Crops\"&gt;Colossal Crops&lt;/a&gt;.\n\nThe Army of the Last Reality arrived through &lt;a href=\"The%20Mothership\"&gt;The Mothership&lt;/a&gt; and destroyed &lt;a href=\"The%20Spire\"&gt;The Spire&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to abduct &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;. They deployed their troops and Saucers while The Mothership began moving. It firstly abducts &lt;a href=\"Slurpy%20Swamp\"&gt;Slurpy Swamp&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"Coral%20Castle\"&gt;Coral Castle&lt;/a&gt;, and finally &lt;a href=\"Corny%20Complex\"&gt;Corny Complex&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Trespassers\"&gt;Trespassers&lt;/a&gt; took over &lt;a href=\"Holly%20Hedges\"&gt;Holly Hedges&lt;/a&gt; and turned it to &lt;a href=\"Holly%20Hatchery\"&gt;Holly Hatchery&lt;/a&gt; as a place for &lt;a href=\"Alien%20Parasites\"&gt;Alien Parasites&lt;/a&gt;.\n\n&lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; prepared a strike team to infiltrate The Mothership as they are abducting Corny Complex. The team goes through The Mothership, avoiding &lt;a href=\"Trespassers\"&gt;Trespassers&lt;/a&gt;, and are locked in the Abduction Chamber Window. A &lt;a href=\"Rebooted%20Cube\"&gt;Corruption Cube&lt;/a&gt; rises from the water and zaps the Loopers. Slone shuts it down and leaves The Loopers to die after the Countermeasure Devices are set. The Loopers reboot the Cube and it activates the elevator. They witness a group of Cubes that act as the power source of The Mothership along with the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Cube\"&gt;Golden Cube&lt;/a&gt;. The bombs detonate, and The Mothership, along with all the Cubes, fall on &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;.\n\nThe Army of the Last Reality continued their invasion of Reality Zero. After the events of , The Cubes crashed on the island, along with the &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%20Queen\"&gt;Cube Queen&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rebooted%20Cube\"&gt;Rebooted Cube&lt;/a&gt;. During these events, Sideways Anomalies started appearing across the island, converting &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Royale%20Map\"&gt;POIs&lt;/a&gt; into The Sideways and releasing Cube Monsters that are lead by &lt;a href=\"Cube%20Assassin\"&gt;Cube Assassins&lt;/a&gt;. The aftermath of was visible on the new season's map. The wreckage of The Mothership was visible on the horizon and debris from destroyed &lt;a href=\"Abductors\"&gt;Abductors&lt;/a&gt; littered the Island. The &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Cube\"&gt;Golden Cube&lt;/a&gt; began rolling around the island to awaken the other cubes. After they all reach &lt;a href=\"The%20Aftermath\"&gt;The Aftermath&lt;/a&gt;, they form &lt;a href=\"The%20Convergence\"&gt;The Convergence&lt;/a&gt; which later turns into &lt;a href=\"The%20Pyramid\"&gt;The Pyramid&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28Chapter%202%29\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%20Queen\"&gt;The Cube Queen&lt;/a&gt; started her attack and opened a portal to the &lt;a href=\"Cube%27s%20Cradle\"&gt;Cube's Cradle&lt;/a&gt;. She summons &lt;a href=\"Caretaker\"&gt;Caretakers&lt;/a&gt; to defeat The Loopers and abducts their weapons through The Saucers. The &lt;a href=\"Rebooted%20Cube\"&gt;Rebooted Cube&lt;/a&gt; zaps and eliminates Caretakers, but a Golden Abductor destroys it. Golden Abductors destroy Locations as the Loopers are saved by &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Visitor\"&gt;The Visitor&lt;/a&gt;. The Cube Queen sends Caretakers underwater, with one arriving above &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, before it destroys the glass ceiling and floods the place as &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; flips and reveals &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;. The flipping of the Island causes the energy from the Pyramid to explode, seemingly destroying the Cube Queen and closing the portal.\n\nIn the cinematic trailer, &lt;a href=\"The%20Herald\"&gt;The Herald&lt;/a&gt; can be seen watching the &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Tree\"&gt;Reality Tree&lt;/a&gt;.\n\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt; is captured by the &lt;a href=\"Chrome\"&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt; and sent to the Last Reality. &lt;a href=\"The%20Herald\"&gt;The Herald&lt;/a&gt; arrives and spreads Chrome around Artemis, The Nothing's voice revealed in the &lt;a href=\"Bytes%20Quests\"&gt;Bytes Quests&lt;/a&gt;, where it recruits Bytes to their cause.\n&lt;a href=\"Fracture\"&gt;Fracture&lt;/a&gt;.\nChrome Vortices proceed to appear around the Island as The Herald makes her way to the Reality Tree. After rising in a giant form, she succeeds in chroming the tree in the Fracture Event. With the entire Island covered in Chrome, The Herald successfully destroyed island and exposed the dormant Zero Point, causing Reality Zero to go dark. &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; activated the Zero Fusion, reforging Reality Zero and creating a whole new Island and returned the Zero Point to safety.\n\nIn &lt;a href=\"Oathbound%20Quests\"&gt;Oathbound Quests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AMIE\"&gt;AMIE&lt;/a&gt;'s test subjects sent through her Test Rifts encountered \"it\" sculpting &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt; into something new and different. One of the test subjects returned to AMIE as a &lt;a href=\"Cube%20Monsters\"&gt;Cube Monster&lt;/a&gt;.\n\nIn &lt;a href=\"Syndicate%20Quests\"&gt;Syndicate Quests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dahlia\"&gt;someone&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Unseen\"&gt;The Unseen&lt;/a&gt; was secretly communicating with The Army of Last Reality and helped them by sabotaging syndicates with information related to them, causing chaos in all syndicates. The saboteur's goal was to take over MEGA City with their help, naively believing that The Last Reality would keep their word when they were just planning to destroy everything. The sabotage was stopped by the &lt;a href=\"Peace%20Syndicate\"&gt;Peace Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe power that allowed &lt;a href=\"Asteria\"&gt;Asteria&lt;/a&gt; to exist has started to fade, and &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt; has found itself doomed to collapse. Noticing this, \"formidable enemies\" began to make their way to the Island, The Army of Last Reality was implied to be among them.\n\nThe Cube of Fortnite OG's Reality rose from &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt;, taking the cabin and island in the center of the lake with it, forming the &lt;a href=\"Floating%20Island\"&gt;Floating Island&lt;/a&gt; as did both of its counterparts. Because of the notable difference of this timeline compared to Reality Zero, it didn't appeared from the Sideways Rift but directly under Loot Lake. It therefore never placed its runes and its plan was totally different from its Original Timeline Counterpart. Indeed since it was not hostile towards the loopers because it did not have enough energy to attack them, they therefore didn't attacked Kevin which allowed it to survive longer than it should have. This allowed it to extract the Zero Point and absorb its energy. However it completely dissapeared just before &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Bang\"&gt;The Big Bang&lt;/a&gt;, having been allegedly rifted or destroyed off-screen likely due to Jones' actions.\n&lt;a href=\"LEGO%20Fortnite\"&gt;LEGO Fortnite&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Storm started to invade LEGO Reality, animals, monsters and even people making them more powerful and aggressive.\nLater, The Storm King himself arrived in the LEGO World, corrupting Raven to make him his new servant and made himself a dungeon in the Rift at the heart of the world where he can consume infinite rift energy to power the Storm, corrupt and destroy the whole reality. He and his forces are fought by the STorm Chasers and otehr residents of the LEGO world, however, they're unable to defeat him for good as each time he return along with his storms.\nReferences.\n=Reality=\nThe Last Reality is the Reality in &lt;a href=\"Fortnite\"&gt;Fortnite&lt;/a&gt; in which most of the members of The Army of the Last Reality originate.

{"id": "56195", "revid": "47388529", "url": "https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki?curid=56195", "title": "The Loop", "text": "The Loop was an artificial sub-dimension within &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt; where everyone trapped inside would be fighting endlessly to death in a time loop. Those people were deprived from their memory and their ability to speak and followed by a deadly &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;Storm&lt;/a&gt;, which resets every 22 minutes. It was managed by the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt;.\nPeople in the Loop or who were once trapped inside are called \"&lt;a href=\"Loopers\"&gt;Loopers&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe Loop.\nThe Loop is an endless pseudo-time loop of Battle Royale, created and managed by the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt;. Every 22 minutes, &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt; slowly closes in on the island, resetting the loop when the last person survives (if there is any). This last survivor if located at the exact center of The Storm would escapes the loop. Upon entrance of the Loop, inhabitants are rendered mute and their memories start to deteriorate. Despite this, the loop does not reset the environment of the Island, nor does it reset any deeper thoughts of feelings or emotions. Loopers can still communicate via non-verbal means, such as how &lt;a href=\"Batman%20Zero\"&gt;Batman&lt;/a&gt; communicates with &lt;a href=\"Snake%20Eyes\"&gt;Snake Eyes&lt;/a&gt;, enabling . \nThe Loop itself is run by a computer program named the Loop Control System, when the Loop Control Computer is off, The Loop itself is offline. During &lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer%20of%20Worlds\"&gt;The Devourer of Worlds&lt;/a&gt; event, &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Stark\"&gt;Tony Stark&lt;/a&gt; describes to &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;, that he hacked the Loop. However, the Loop had to be monitored constantly or remotely controlled by the Imagined Order. \nOutside of the Loop.\nOutside of The Loop, or the Extra Loop, is the location a Looper ends up after escaping The Loop. All usual effects of The Loop are gone, but the escaped Looper is still trapped on the Island and unable to remember the reality they come from. This place was notably featured in [[Batman/Fortnite: Zero Point]], as well as during Chapter 3.\n[[The Storm]].\n[[File:The Storm - Gameplay - Fortnite.png|thumb]]\n[[File:Final Push - The Device - Fortnite.png|thumb|Defy the Storm]]\nOne of the main forces that maintains the loop is the storm, a sentient entity member of [[The Army of the Last Reality]]. It was externally controlled by the [[Imagined Order]] thanks to a shield and wast amount of energy, likely coming from the Zero Point. If a disturbance were to happens to The Storm, The Loop would start to break down.\nBreaking the Storm.\nDue to a poor understanding of the connection between the Storm and the Loop, [[Midas]] attempted to push back the Storm using [[The Device (event)|the Device]] which temporarily broke the Loop (this allowed the first meeting between [[The Looper]] and [[Agent Jones]]) and resulted in [[The Wall Of Water|The Wall of Water]].\n[[Imagined Order]].\n[[File:Loop Control - Impostors - Fortnite.png|thumb|175px|[[The Bridge|Loop Control Room]]]]\nThe IO created the Loop and manage most if not all of its aspects. They kidnap people from countless [[The Omniverse|realities]] and put them inside. All this in order to study the fighters, their powers, their time spent in The Loop and when/how they discover how to escape. The final goal of the Imagined Order is to find the perfect organizational system, for the perfect civilization. Some Loopers who escaped The Loop were also recruited by the Imagined Order.\nIn [[The Bridge]], I.O. [[The Bridge#Loop Control|Loop Control]] room is a spherical monitor room with a massive computer named the Loop Control Computer in the middle with multiple panels.\nLoop Immunity.\nTo prevent the Loop's abilities from affecting certain individuals, materials that can be used to shape new reality like [[The Zero Point]] are required to make loop shield devices. A sealed environment suit can also stop the Loop effects. Swimming deep underwater also works.\nSealed Environment.\n[[File:The Scientist (Old Featured) - Outfit - Fortnite.png|right|130px]]\nA sealed environment keeps The Loop's effects away, but doesn't allow the user to escape The Loop, as they still need to escape The Loop through the Eye of The Storm. If the suit gets damaged, all of its effects wear off and The Loop resets the memory. Known users of this method are the members of [[The Seven]], [[IO Guards]] and [[Lex Luthor]].\nI.O. Technology.\n[[File:Deathstroke's IO Device - Zero Point - Fortnite.png|right|130px]]\nThe [[Imagined Order]] developed many forms of technology that allows them to enter The Loop with no memory loss. The most known one is a [[Portal Device]], which was commonly carried by [[Agent Jones]]. If a Portal Device gets destroyed or overloaded, the user gets stuck in The Loop. A small device was also given to [[Deathstroke Zero|Deathstroke]] which created a small force shield around him with the same signature as The Storm, allowing him to bypass The Loop.\nWorld Forge Visor.\n[[File:The Batman Who Laughs - Outfit - Fortnite.png|right|130px]]\n[[The Batman Who Laughs]]' visor made from &lt;a href=\"https%3A//dc.fandom.com/wiki/World_Forge\"&gt;World Forge&lt;/a&gt;, a type of material similar to the Zero Point. It keeps his memory and speech intact.\nTimeline.\nBefore Chapter 1.\nAccording to [[Bunker Jonesy]], The [[Imagined Order]] started various experiments with [[The Zero Point]], One of the experiments was to send [[Agent Jones]] into the Zero Point to see what will happens. \n[[Season 4]].\nIn [[Season 4]], [[The Visitor]], a member of the mysterious [[The Seven|Seven]] makes his way onto the Island via a [[The Meteor|meteor crash]], and nearing the end of the season attempts to escape it using a rocket, in the [[Blast Off]] event. However, during this attempt, the rocket creates several rifts in the sky, causing a sideways rift between reality, a [[Sideways Rift]]. One of the results of this is a person from the real world, named [[Drift]], being inducted into the loop. \n[[Season X]].\nAfter the events of [[The Final Showdown]] event, the [[Zero Point]] is left exposed, and creates another bridge between realities. This time however, it brings another member of [[The Seven]], named [[The Scientist]]. Initially arriving outside The Loop, The Scientist escaped from the meteor and began building Rift Beacons, in order to open several rifts in the sky in order to bring the otger members of [[The Seven]] for their plan: to contain The Zero Point. AFter all the rifts were opened, The Scientist began working on another rocket, but realize that to trigger his device, he needed to be inside The Loop. The Scientist decided to record [[Visitor Tapes|tapes]], in order for him to remember what he has to do once inside The Loop if he ever loses his memory.\nThese tapes detail some of the effects of the Loop for the first time explicitly. The Scientist succeeds, and launches a rocket alongside several unknown members of the Seven, and along with them collide The Meteor with the zero point in order to contain it's explosion. While initially a success, interference from people outside The Loop that was not calculated caused the Zero Point to become a black hole.\n[[Chapter 2: Season 1]].\nAfter the result of the End event, [[Athena]] was converted into two new Island, [[Apollo]] and [[Artemis]]. As The Bridge was intact, the Imagined Order could restart The Loop once again, however they contracted [[E.G.O.]] to map the new Island.\n[[Chapter 2: Season 2]].\n[[File:The Device Activated - The Device - Fortnite.png|thumb]]\nIn this season, Midas first appears on the island and begins to build a device which harnesses the power of the Zero Point to push back the storm. This is unsuccessful, and instead [[The Wall Of Water|a Wall of Water]] is created, flooding the entire island. The Storm being connected to the Loop was first revealed here, and this one was temporarily broken. As a result of this, The player is continuously transported to a [[The Bridge|mysterious office]], and a familiar face interacts with the player, showing surprise that they can understand him as they came from outside the loop. [[Agent Jones|John Jones]] is the man present, and he is the first person aside from the Scientist to be audible.\n[[Chapter 2: Season 3]].\n[[File:Comic Page 3.jpeg|thumb|[[Nexus War: Thor]]]]\nIn [[Chapter 2: Season 3]], [[Thor]] is transported to the island to warn the inhabitants of [[Galactus]]' arrival, but begins to lose his memories and voice. However, after briefly remembering why he was here, he quickly brings other [[:Category:Marvel Series|Marvel]] characters to island, and in particular, [[Tony Stark]]. \n[[Chapter 2: Season 4]].\nAfter arriving on the island, all the Marvel heroes and villains began to lose their memories. Later, they all escaped the loop, under unknown circumstances, with Iron Man seemingly being one of the firsts. Throughout the season, he constructs a [[Stark Industries (Location)|Stark Industries lab]] and works on a plan to stop [[Galactus]] from absorbing the Zero Point. During the [[The Devourer of Worlds]] event, with the players help, Tony Stark manages to send Galactus far away from the Island, but the Zero Point was left exposed. During the event, Tony Stark mentions having 'hacked' the loop and made a few million clones of [[Battle Bus|Battle Buses]], aiding to his ability to communicate with the player, as with other members of Thor's crew.\n[[Chapter 2: Season 5]].\nJohn Jones is tasked by [[Doctor Slone]] to stabilize [[The Zero Point]], reseal The Bridge, and make sure nobody escapes The Loop. Despite this he goes back into the Loop to recruit various [[Hunters|hunters]] from different [[The Omniverse|Realities]] to help him make sure nobody escapes. [[Bunker Jonesy]] reveal to [[The Looper]] tehre is a way to get out of The Loop during a conversation they had. During several quests, he gave them clue related to The Storm. \n[[Chapter 2: Season 6]].\n[[File:Zero Point Trapping scene 1 - Fortnite.png|thumb]]\nIn the [[Zero Crisis Finale]], [[Agent Jones]] disregards Doctor Slone's orders to escape and to not collaborate with The Seven to reseal the now vulnerable [[Zero Point]]. With the help of [[The Foundation]], he is able to reseal the Zero Point (if only temporarily), but as a consequence is now inside of The Loop himself. During [[The Spire Quests|Spire Quests]], [[The Looper]] learns that, like all the other Jonesy [[snapshots]], [[Bunker Jonesy]] ended up losing his memory, but it was by being locked up in the Bunker for \"decades, if not centuries\" that he finally regained his memory and that he understood that once in the loop, we are only a snapshot of the person that we are and therefore that he is not \"the real\" Jonesy.\n[[Batman/Fortnite: Zero Point]].\nBatman entered the loop through a huge rift in the sky. He figures out how the loop works by creating a shack and filling it with items from the each loop, and they always stay there meaning with the loop, locations with changes don't get looped and destroyed or back to how it was. He also finds out how to escape the loop, he later escapes and find out there's an extra layer of the Loop.\nAt the end of [[Batman/Fortnite: Zero Point Issue 2]], [[Catwoman Zero|Catwoman]] escaped from the Loop thanks to the help of [[Batman Zero|Batman]], it would apparently require being in the center of the Storm and killing the last survivor by himself (the last survivor must not die of the Storm).\nIn [[Batman/Fortnite: Zero Point Issue 3]], Batman successfully escapes the Loop and enters the Extra-Loop with the help of [[Snake Eyes]] but is confronted by [[Deathstroke Zero|Deathstroke]] who is holding Catwoman hostage.\nIn [[Batman/Fortnite: Zero Point Issue 6]], Batman and Catwoman successfully escapes the island and regain all of their memories.\n[[Chapter 2: Season 7]].\n[[The Bridge]] Loop Control room was revealed in [[Impostors]] mode. A spherical room with large computers. It utilizes [[The Cube|Cube]] monolith panels which are used to control the Loop.\n[[Chapter 2: Season 8]].\nA certain cosmic metal from &lt;a href=\"https%3A//dc.fandom.com/wiki/World_Forge\"&gt;World Forge&lt;/a&gt; made [[The Batman Who Laughs]] immune to the Loop's memory resets, so he enters it and goes on killing spree.\n[[Chapter 3: Season 1]].\nReality Zero was flipped and [[Apollo]] was replaced by [[Artemis]], an island inhabited by the Seven and the Loopers that they freed from the Loop. With the partial destruction of The Bridge the conditions of the Loop are unknown.\n[[Chapter 3: Season 3]].\nAfter the defeat of the Imagined Order and the destruction of The Bridge, the Loop is no longer under the I.O.'s heavy protection and control, meaning that the Loopers are now free. The Seven look for a way to bring everyone home while researching the [[Reality Tree]], but things don't go as planned due to [[Chrome|a new and mysterious threat]].\nAt this period, the Loop's status is unknown. Considering The Loop needed to be monitored by the Imagined Order and that the installation of The Bridge were necessary for it to work, The Loop may have stopped working.\n[[Chapter 3: Season 4]].\n[[Fracture]].\nAs [[The Herald]] destroyed [[Reality Zero]], and therefore The Loop (if it still existed) along with it.\n[[Chapter 4: Season 1|Chapter 4]].\nAfter the annihilation of [[Apollo]] and [[Artemis]], and the creation of [[Asteria]] as the new Reality Zero, all the people who have been brought into Asteria now simply live on the Island without being trapped inside The Loop. As the Zero Point is later revealed to be petrified and unusable, that The Loop System is absent as the Imagined Order was no longer here to recreate it and manage the Loop and that [[Paradigm (Reality-659)|Paradigm]] recovered the Loop Breaker project files for her plan, it's suggested that The Loop wasn't recreated in the new Reality Zero.\n[[Chapter 5: Season 1|Chapter 5]].\nAs Jones created [[Helios]] and plenty of realities by generating a new Big Bang in the past, [[Asteria]]'s inhabitants fled their dying reality and ended in a completely new reality. Just like the previous chapter, the inhabitants aren't trapped in The Loop and simply live their lives and can be killed. \nReferences.\n[[Category:Imagined Order]]\n[[Category:Story and Lore]]"}

However they were trapped in &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Season%201\"&gt;Season 1&lt;/a&gt; and lost all their memories.\nAfter gaining awarness inside The Loop , they began working mainly in the underworld and offering their services to different individuals or organizations often in exchange for compensation or because they share a common goal with their client. They sided with The Island against most threat, including &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey are the main protagonist of &lt;a href=\"Fortnite\"&gt;Fortnite&lt;/a&gt;, being the main protagonist of &lt;a href=\"LEGO%20Fortnite\"&gt;LEGO Fortnite&lt;/a&gt; and the overarching protagonist of serving as:\nOverview.\nThe Looper is a powerful human warrior from &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Army of the Last Reality&lt;/a&gt; sent on a mission by &lt;a href=\"Kymera\"&gt;Kymera&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt; a long time ago for an unknown mission. But after entering The Loop, they forgot everything.\nAfter their memory loss, The Looper became merely one of the many other &lt;a href=\"loopers\"&gt;loopers&lt;/a&gt; trapped in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt;, having no awareness of The Loop, they apparently remained a simple observer during the whole first Chapter. From Chapter 2 the Looper, start to act as a mercenary and begins to be noticed by important &lt;a href=\"characters\"&gt;characters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;organizations&lt;/a&gt;, becoming a precious ally or a threat for them. Their various heroic actions over time as well as their prowess in battle have earned them the respect of both allies and enemies alike, as well as receiving the title of \"Hero\", making them a central figure of The Island. Unlike &lt;a href=\"Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; who has wandered from his path , The Looper seems to have a predetermined fate that they follow, as it was prophesied eons ago that they would confront and dethrone &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;, before facing a &lt;a href=\"The%20Wanderer\"&gt;worse threat&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nDuring Chapter 1 and Chapter 2, The Looper had no set appearance, however during &lt;a href=\"Zero%20Crisis%20Finale\"&gt;Zero Crisis Finale&lt;/a&gt; event and several quests, they took on different forms. It's finally that their real male and female appearances are revealed for the &lt;a href=\"Collision\"&gt;Collision&lt;/a&gt; event where The Looper is commissioned by &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt; to assist in piloting &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Strike%20Commander\"&gt;Mecha Strike Commander&lt;/a&gt;. Under their pilot appearance, we can see that The Looper has actually a very thin build and muscles which contrasts with their actual brute force worthy of the heroes of Greek mythology according to &lt;a href=\"The%20Oracle\"&gt;The Oracle&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality.\nThe Looper is a skilled fighter with great combat experience. Unlike the other loopers, it's noted they are calm, thoughtful and endowed with great integrity, showing abilities of analysis of the situation despite the lack of information during &lt;a href=\"Zero%20Crisis%20Finale\"&gt;Zero Crisis Finale&lt;/a&gt; by choosing to help &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; instead of fighting with the other loopers. The Looper demonstrates a sense of justice, rallying to factions and people wishing to protect the Island and showing great loyalty to each other, however they are ruthless with those designated as their enemy or traitors, they feel no remorse to kill people or harm innocent people if it's for their mission. &lt;a href=\"Rick%20Sanchez\"&gt;Rick Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; also stated that they would do anything as long as they get paid and that they complete their missions without ever questioning their orders, making him understand why the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; actively wanted to recruit them. Despite their calmness, The Looper is known to other characters for their unpredictable and explosive fighting style in stark contrast to their personality, as well as their thirst for challenge and adventure, being completely unafraid of risks according to &lt;a href=\"Odyssey\"&gt;Odyssey&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle Trivia.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Its goal is to annihilate all realities so that only it remains. \nIt is a major antagonist in &lt;a href=\"Fortnite\"&gt;Fortnite&lt;/a&gt;, acting as the overarching antagonist of .\nOverview.\nThe Nothing is a self-aware cosmic entity and the counterpart of &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, embodying the pure nothingness that existed before the Omniverse, while the latter embodies pure creation. Seemingly unable to act by itself on The Omniverse, it founded The Army of the Last Reality, a group formed of beings mainly from The Last Reality, and other beings &lt;a href=\"Chrome%23Lore\"&gt;created&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"The%20Herald\"&gt;chosen&lt;/a&gt; by them in order to destroy The Omniverse.\nAppearance.\nNothing is known about the true appearance of the Nothing, or if it even has a physical form.

It is looking for worthy individuals; it uses its skills at manipulation to guide them down a path of darkness that takes away their identity and heralds them a useful asset by giving them &lt;a href=\"Chrome\"&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt; powers. The only &lt;a href=\"The%20Herald\"&gt;known&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bytes\"&gt;individuals&lt;/a&gt; chosen by The Nothing thus far has become members of &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Army of the Last Reality&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Big Bang.\nOriginally there was absolutely Nothing, however without warning there was \"Something\". The Zero Point appeared and created countless realities. However, that complete nothingness that was once there had a will of its own. Wishing to return everything to its original state where only it exists, it started to predate The Zero Point and &lt;a href=\"The%20Omniverse\"&gt;The Omniverse&lt;/a&gt;. For this, it formed &lt;a href=\"The%20Army%20of%20the%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Army of the Last Reality&lt;/a&gt; under unclear circumstances, and under its orders they began to annihilate one reality after another, all while searching for The Zero Point.\nIn Save the World's Reality, The Nothing manifested itself as a type of corruption originating from &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt;, being omnipresent in Storm King's Realm. It striked &lt;a href=\"Homebase\"&gt;Homebase&lt;/a&gt;, making people feel lazy, consuming them with existential dread and making them feels lifeless during &lt;a href=\"Remote%20Control\"&gt;Remote Control&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Signal%20Strength\"&gt;Signal Strength&lt;/a&gt; quests.\nIt was revealed in &lt;a href=\"Bandwidth%20Issues\"&gt;Bandwidth Issues&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Vinderman\"&gt;Dr. Vinderman&lt;/a&gt; was aware of the existence of The Nothing along with The Storm King, backed up with multiple weapon plans that were lost.\nUnknown Time Period.\nOne day, in unknown circumstances, &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; found himself in The Nothing. His armor allowed him to survive for a time in it.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%20X\"&gt;Season X&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn an attempt to contain The Zero Point, The Seven turned the whole Reality into Nothing because of a miscalculation \"I was not alone, others are outside &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;the loop&lt;/a&gt;, this was not calculated, The Nothing is now inevitable.\"\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Bytes%20Quests\"&gt;Bytes Quests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bytes\"&gt;Bytes&lt;/a&gt; was chosen by The Nothing itself to be warrior for &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20Quests\"&gt;Paradise Quests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt; mentioned The Nothing, however the audio is mostly unintelligible.

These coexisting Universes that have their own rules and aren't supposed to interact with each other are called Realities. These Realities can themselves be contained in Galaxies also known as Multiverses in other media. Galaxies act as containers of Realities that abide by their own set of rules, in other words the Realities belonging to Galaxies have a whole basis common rules. Some Realities like Reality Zero may not belong to any Galaxies. \nIn certain cases, the Universes can be separated into several dimensions or realms, however these dimensions sub-dimension or realms are an integral part of a Reality and not separate Realities. But in in other cases, certain worlds considered as dimensions or realms like &lt;a href=\"The%20Sideways\"&gt;The Sideways&lt;/a&gt; are actually Realities in their own right. \nThere is also the case of alternate timelines. This case refers to two universes that were once completely identical, up to a certain point where events happen in a different way, giving birth to a new reality. This happened to and Reality: 617, respectively Earth 616 and Earth 617 of the Marvel Multiverse, with 617 being born from a timeline split caused by a journey between Realities. This is also happened &lt;a href=\"Chapter%204%20Season%20OG%27s%20Reality\"&gt;Chapter 4 Season OG's Reality&lt;/a&gt; which diverged from &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt;, all the locations from diverging timelines encountered in &lt;a href=\"Season%20X\"&gt;Season X&lt;/a&gt;, , , and as well as in , where a Timeline, a World and a Reality define the exact same thing according to Doctor Vinderman in the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20%28Questline%29\"&gt;Timeless Questlines&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt's possible to travel between different Realities by using some forms of inter-dimensional travel such as The Zero Point, a &lt;a href=\"Portal%20Device\"&gt;Portal Device&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rift\"&gt;Rifts&lt;/a&gt; or simply by traveling in the space that separates Realities as do &lt;a href=\"The%20Army%20of%20the%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Army of the Last Reality&lt;/a&gt;, Kado Thorne, &lt;a href=\"Triarch%20Aurora\"&gt;Triarch Aurora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20King\"&gt;The Ice King&lt;/a&gt;.\nRisks.\nInteractions between Realities and time travel present enormous risks for the integrity of a Reality, a Galaxy, or even the entire Omniverse : \nKnown Realities.\nBelow is a list of all known Realities which directly link to &lt;a href=\"Fortnite\"&gt;Fortnite&lt;/a&gt;.

The time travel didn't in any way affect the existence of Apollo and Artemis as confirmed by the characters rifted into a Reality of the LEGO Galaxy.

She used to be a mortal before becoming an oracle/consultant for &lt;a href=\"Apollo%20%28Outfit%29%23Character\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; and the other gods.\nShe arrived on the island alongside &lt;a href=\"The%20Pantheon\"&gt;The Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; in Chapter 5 Season 2. She is a shapeless entity made of water, and cares about the good of Mortals, so much so that it has come to summon The Looper to speak with Hades and Ares by carrying out challenges to gain the attention of the Gods.\nShe is a major protagonist of , serving as the deuteragonist of and a major protagonist of and .\nAppearance.\nThe Oracle was formerly a mortal of unknown appearance, but following an unspecified event she became water, the very same water found at the Scrying Pools objects she uses to communicate with The Looper or to put them in contact with the Gods or orther mortals. \nPersonality.\nThe Oracle appears to be very sarcastic and ironic, but also determined in her goal to save mortals from Zeus. Precisely through her determination, she has already produced several advances in countermeasures to be used against the Gods. We notice how she has a \"character to play\", prophesying and looking at the dark future that awaits the Island, even if, due to her sarcasm, she often fails to convey the gravity of the threat well. \nHistory.\nThe Oracle is a strange individual capable of reading destiny and uttering prophecies. Faced with the threat of Zeus, wishing to annihilate all mortals, she made a new prophecy concerning The Looper by reading their fate announcing to them that they must prove the worth of humanity to Zeus before the sky turns black.\nAfter doing a trial of agility, strength and wisdom to verify that The Looper was a worthy hero, The Oracle announced to them that they must unite the immortals against Zeus. After the Looper defeated Cerberus and Ares, The Oracle mentionned that Zeus allies saw them fighting and that they were stronger than they thought, she then left The Looper, telling them that she will contact them again when an Immortal is ready to listen to them.\nLater in the season, in addition to being revealed that she was human and is under the supervision of Apollo, The Oracle continues to contact The Looper both for the recruitment of Aphrodite and Artemis, and for the final phase of the plan against Zeus, in the Medusa Snapshot Quests. In the actual season finale, The Oracle warns the Looper of The Wanderer's arrival. \nThe Oracle's prophecy is fulfilled, and she is described by &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; as \"a magical water lady\", unaware that she ever existed. This changes when the Pandora gems are gathered together, summoning her to Hope's house. She warns Hope of an impending war after explaining that she was supposed to be caught in the bottom of &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt;. Hope, through the &lt;a href=\"Hope%27s%20Oracle\"&gt;Oracle's guidance&lt;/a&gt;, will have to lead through, meaning she will not be alone on this journey.\nNow allied with &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;, The Oracle prophesies various events (such as &lt;a href=\"Shuri\"&gt;Shuri&lt;/a&gt;'s arrival) or \"victory in defeat\" to advance the battle against &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt;, which she herself had anticipated during Chapter 5 Season 2. \nGallery.\n=Voice=\n\nAsk Brite Raider or Rust about the pipeline explosion.\n class=\"article-table\"\n!Audio\n!Subtitle\nTHE ORACLE: GHOST?

Thanks to Geno's skills in science and biology, the Sisters and himself are immortal. &lt;a href=\"The%20Omniverse\"&gt;The Omniverse&lt;/a&gt; was the playground of the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;IO&lt;/a&gt;, but Geno decided to throw the Sisters into &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt;, betting that they would be the first to escape. They weren't though, making Geno replace them with one of their more stronger &lt;a href=\"Snapshots\"&gt;Snapshots&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhilst she isn't seen during this season, it is known from the &lt;a href=\"Resistance%20Quests\"&gt;Resistance Quests&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt; deleted all &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; files relating to her or &lt;a href=\"The%20Imagined\"&gt;her sister&lt;/a&gt; just as The Imagined was about to access them.

As she hands over the Device, she asks her sister if she would be lonely without her, but The Imagined rest assures her. She later goes with the rest of The Seven to attack another Outpost. She stays on the &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Marvel\"&gt;Captain Marvel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Visitor\"&gt;The Visitor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Origin\"&gt;The Origin&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Collision\"&gt;Collision&lt;/a&gt; /.\nAs the attack on &lt;a href=\"The%20Collider\"&gt;The Collider&lt;/a&gt; starts, The Imagined notices &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt; on an upper platform, firing an energy beam at &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Man%20Zero\"&gt;Iron Man&lt;/a&gt;, causing him to crash.

The Imagined sacrifices herself and jumps into &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, taking Geno with her. They end up at \"The Realm\" and get discorporated, getting scattered across &lt;a href=\"The%20Omniverse\"&gt;The Omniverse&lt;/a&gt;.

She angrily walks away, telling Wolverine to never cross her path again.\nShe goes missing alongside the rest of The Seven.
