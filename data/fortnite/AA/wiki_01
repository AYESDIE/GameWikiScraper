The Origin is part of the .\nCharacter Reaction.\n special dialogues for players wearing The Origin &lt;a href=\"Outfit\"&gt;Outfit&lt;/a&gt;.\nGallery.\n=Character=\nHistory.\n=Lore=\nThe Origin is the field tactician and commander of &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt; and the former Cube King of &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt; that ran away due to the dark power of the &lt;a href=\"Cubes\"&gt;Cubes&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe is a major character of serving as a minor, yet pivotal unseen character of &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/a&gt;, and a major protagonist of &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality.\nThe Origin is strict and serious, commonly called old and grumpy by &lt;a href=\"The%20Imagined\"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;members&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt;. He is very experienced and earned his field tactician by watching countless &lt;a href=\"The%20Omniverse\"&gt;Worlds&lt;/a&gt; end. Origin suffers from a blatant lack of trust toward people because of &lt;a href=\"Paradigm\"&gt;Paradigm&lt;/a&gt;'s apparent betrayal and his own past. Because of this, The Origin has often tried to replace Paradigm with The Looper and refused everything that could come from Paradigm, including weapons and battle plan showing how stubborn he was despite the whole reality being in danger. After Paradigm's case was resolved, Origin started to work to be more trusting. \nAppearance.\nThe Origin.\nAs The Origin, His default style is the prisoner outfit that he wore during his time in the IO prison. The number \"07\" can be found on the outfit. &lt;a href=\"Corruption%20Cubes\"&gt;Corruption Cubes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Cube\"&gt;Golden Cubes&lt;/a&gt; emitting from his body.\nHis Seven style looks just like other members of the Seven, except for something that looks like his Cube King Crown floating near his shoulders. His armor also seem based on those of &lt;a href=\"Trespassers\"&gt;Trespassers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kymera\"&gt;Kymeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cube King.\nAs The Cube King, he has a similar armor to &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%20Queen\"&gt;The Cube Queen&lt;/a&gt; with the addition of a flaming crown emitting cubes, flaming hands, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Sideways\"&gt;Sideways&lt;/a&gt; wings at his back.\nHistory.\nUnknown Time Period.\nThe Origin was the Cube King of &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt;. While they were invading realities, The Origin betrayed The Last Reality after realizing his actions. Soon after, he was captured by the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt;. He formulated a plan to escape, and he tricked the IO making them think he had lost his mind to lower their vigilance and kill the guards in order escaping from their confines. After he escaped, he was saved from the prison by &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt;, joining them and becoming The Origin, the Seven's field general and tactician.\nThe Origin arrived on the &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt; to help with the ongoing war against the Imagined Order and get his revenge. He arrived here with &lt;a href=\"The%20Imagined\"&gt;The Imagined&lt;/a&gt; and a few other characters, such as &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Strange\"&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Widow%20%28Snow%20Suit%29\"&gt;Black Widow&lt;/a&gt;. He commandeers &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt;'s device to get the help of &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;, informing them that he believes that the Island's reality may be about to end . He then sent The Looper on various field missions, and slowly started to trust them. However when he found out they helped Imagined to contact Paradigm he felt betrayed again , but soon forgot this knowing that The Looper is absolutely loyal to The Seven and did this for the common good . After testing The Looper to become the pilot of the Mecha Strike Commander, or the co-pilot of Paradigm, he sent them urgently recoving keys that were meant to be used to activate &lt;a href=\"The%20Collider\"&gt;The Collider&lt;/a&gt; to use them for reverse engineering. After Jones and The Looper cut IO's power, they ordered The Looper to log-on into an IO holo-table to simulate the effects of the machine at Loot Lake, needing the two keys previously recovered. Discovering the purpose of The Collider, he orders the launch of the final attack as soon as possible and activated the Seven's emergency beacon , telling The Looper they'll win and that they'll see on the other side.\n\nThe Origin helps &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt; attack an &lt;a href=\"IO%20Outposts%20%28Zero%20War%29\"&gt;IO Outpost&lt;/a&gt; to get acces to &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Spider-Man\"&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Imagined\"&gt;The Imagined&lt;/a&gt; get to through The Bridge and recruit a group of &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3AAvengers%20%28Earth-616%29\"&gt;Avengers&lt;/a&gt; to help &lt;a href=\"The%20Resistance\"&gt;The Resistance&lt;/a&gt;. In another attack, the Seven steal an IO shuttle and use it to get to &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Storm%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Storm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Man%20Zero\"&gt;Iron Man&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thor\"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; leave the Island, leaving only Origin, &lt;a href=\"The%20Visitor\"&gt;The Visitor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Order\"&gt;The Order&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Collision\"&gt;Collision&lt;/a&gt; /.\nOrigin doesn't join the battle on the ground and instead stays on the &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;Moonbase&lt;/a&gt; to command the attack and deal with the &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Strike%20Commander\"&gt;Mecha&lt;/a&gt;'s final repairs.\nAfter the Foundation and Order disappeared due to the chromium, Origin and the remaining members of The Seven gathered in a lab to study the Chrome . Guessing that it came from The Herald, one of his former colleagues from The Last Reality, he prepared battle plans.\nWhile The Scientist was studying the sample of Chrome, it went out of control and Chromed The Scientist, then The Origin and the Visitor, leaving Paradigm as the only member of The Seven able to do something. Origin ordered her to escape before before being completely chromed.\nDuring AMIE's and The Looper's test of portal, they found accidentaly the location where all chromed people got sent.. However after sending fragment of herself and upon making them returning, they discovered that everyone had their existence written by \"it\".\nReferences.\n=Voice=\n&lt;a href=\"Covert%20Ops%20Quests\"&gt;Covert Ops Quests&lt;/a&gt;.\nEstablish a Device Uplink in Zero Build (Phase 1).\n class=\"article-table\"\n!Audio\n!Subtitle\nTHE ORIGIN: I think you'd be a good candidate for our most elite combat squadron: Covert Ops.\nBut to enlist you, we'll need to assess your tactical prowess for suitability.\nTake out an opponent.

Contrary to Greek mythology, all gods and some daimons are considered Olympians, even Hades and Cerberus, the latter even being considered as a full fledged god. After the mortals opened Pandora's Box, The Gods of the Pantheon descended onto &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt; to fix that by closing the box and punishing &lt;a href=\"The%20Society\"&gt;The Society&lt;/a&gt;, whose member families are part of the Pantheon's lineage. Then Zeus decided to kill all of the mortals for their \"hubris\" although actually it was because of a prophecy of his downfall by the hand of a &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt;, foretold by Apollo and The Oracles, causing conflict among the Pantheon.\nIt's said that The Pantheon was already known for its infighting, although &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt; says she does not understand why, while listing cases where gods and other immortals hate each other such as Hades with Demeter, Poseidon with Medusa, and Zeus with practically everyone.

As the &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Strike%20Commander\"&gt;Mecha&lt;/a&gt; is about to destroy The Collider, seismic charges create a giant sinkhole that the Mecha falls into. The Foundation, Agent Jones and the Mecha Strike Team destroy the Crystals and blow up The Collider.\nScientist and The Looper work to discover the &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Tree\"&gt;Reality Tree&lt;/a&gt; and do various experiments on it such as sending &lt;a href=\"Bushranger\"&gt;Bushranger&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Bushy%27s%20Bulb\"&gt;seed&lt;/a&gt; next to the tree. They soon discover that The Zero Point was pulling powerful artifact from other Realities as well as trying to tell them something. Scientist creates an AI assistant named &lt;a href=\"AMIE\"&gt;AMIE&lt;/a&gt; who has a weird attraction to her creator to help him and The Looper. While the duo was searching for relics, The Scientist tried to understand the Zero Point, as with each recovered relics, the Zero Point was doing energy shockwaves, each time more intense. At the same time, Foundation was chromed unbeknownst to everyone. The Scientist finaly discovered what the Zero Point was trying to tell, but was commissioned to study &lt;a href=\"Chrome\"&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt; along with Origin and Visitor.\nThe Chrome substance in The Scientist's lab breaks out and spreads on The Seven. While on her way escaping in another reality, Paradigm contacted The Looper, asking them to recover every notes from The Scientist, who discovered that the Zero Point was sending galactic distress signal and that if it don't get help it'll go dormant. After that, The Looper find The Scientist's audio log for Paradigm, the last one standing of &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt;, telling that he is sorry to left Paradigm alone again and that he is being taken somewhere he doesn't know and that he deserves whatever happens to him.\nThe test Rift created by AMIE and The Looper locks onto The Scientist while he is facing a fate worse than death, by having his existence forcefully rewritten by &lt;a href=\"The%20Nothing\"&gt;The Nothing&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis alternate version arrived at &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; by meteor, frozen in time above &lt;a href=\"Dusty%20Divot\"&gt;Dusty Divot&lt;/a&gt;. \nLore Trivia.\n=Voice=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The Seven was made up of 7 inner members, hence the name and had under their command an army of loopers, fighters freed from The Loop who act as outer agents.\nLocations, Agents &amp; Allies and Technology.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nTechnology.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nHistory.\nBefore Chapter 1.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; has been studying &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; and the Omniverse for a very long time.\nUnknown when or how, The Foundation recruits 6 other people with the aim of destroying the IO, and liberating The Zero Point. &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt; the IO's founder, quickly becomes The Foundation's greatest fear, knowing that they are in control of the Zero Point. The Seven develop sealed environment suits as a way to enter and leave &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt; anytime they want without being affected by the Loop's effects.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%203\"&gt;Season 3&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"The%20Meteor\"&gt;Meteor&lt;/a&gt; is spotted over the island, with its impact zone unknown. Inside is the &lt;a href=\"The%20Visitor\"&gt;The Visitor&lt;/a&gt;, but this is yet to be revealed until the next season.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%204\"&gt;Season 4&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Meteor strikes the Island, destroying &lt;a href=\"Dusty%20Depot\"&gt;Dusty Depot&lt;/a&gt; and creating &lt;a href=\"Dusty%20Divot\"&gt;Dusty Divot&lt;/a&gt;. The Visitor, the first member to be revealed, arrives from an unknown world. He came to the island in a metal space capsule embedded within the meteor. Shortly after escaping the capsule in Week 7 of the season. He broke out of the research facility stationed around his landing spot, he went to the &lt;a href=\"Villain%20Lair\"&gt;Villain Lair&lt;/a&gt; near Snobby Shores and used Hop Rocks to modify a movie prop rocket into a functioning vehicle. \nOn June 30th, he launched &lt;a href=\"the%20Rocket\"&gt;the Rocket&lt;/a&gt;, starting the &lt;a href=\"Blast%20Off\"&gt;Blast Off&lt;/a&gt; event. During the event, the rocket appeared opened a &lt;a href=\"Rift\"&gt;Rift&lt;/a&gt;, sending the rocket into it. The rocket then emerged elsewhere on the map, repeatedly opening rifts until it blasted off into the sky, creating a giant &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;Sideways Rift&lt;/a&gt; above the Island. \n&lt;a href=\"Season%20X\"&gt;Season X&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Season X, after &lt;a href=\"the%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;the Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; was exposed from the &lt;a href=\"The%20Final%20Showdown\"&gt;Season 9 Live Event&lt;/a&gt;. It caused further destabilization on the Island. As such, a member of the Seven was manipulated by &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; to deal with it. With an alternate reality Meteor sitting stationary above the newly reformed Dusty Depot, &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; emerged from inside.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; worked to create the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Beacons\"&gt;Rift Beacons&lt;/a&gt;, which opened up six rifts in the sky. During this time, the Scientist created several &lt;a href=\"Visitor%20Tapes\"&gt;tapes&lt;/a&gt;. They were able to be collected and cryptically described his plans and attempts to remember his plan during &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;the Looping&lt;/a&gt; process.\nIn &lt;a href=\"The%20End\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt; event, he launched a rocket into the sky, making a rift which activated the six smaller &lt;a href=\"Rift\"&gt;rifts&lt;/a&gt; created by the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Beacon\"&gt;Rift Beacons&lt;/a&gt;. Rockets emerged from each &lt;a href=\"rift\"&gt;rift&lt;/a&gt;, and came together to unfreeze &lt;a href=\"The%20Meteor\"&gt;The Meteor&lt;/a&gt; and divert it into the &lt;a href=\"Zero%20Point\"&gt;Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, causing it to create a black hole and to rearrange the island's matter and form the &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt; islands.\nDuring the opening cutscene of the Season, &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;John Jones&lt;/a&gt; enters The Loop in order to stop anyone escaping it, after the result of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer%20of%20Worlds\"&gt;Devourer of Worlds&lt;/a&gt; event. The Seven was mentioned by John Jones' boss, &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Dr Slone&lt;/a&gt;, after he rushes off into the Loop. Towards the end of the season, in teaser information, Jones makes attempts to gain information about the Seven in his &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Logs\"&gt;reality logs&lt;/a&gt;. He was unable to obtain it, and so attempted to take it for himself.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Zero%20Crisis%20Finale\"&gt;Zero Crisis Finale&lt;/a&gt;, Jones manages to recruit a member of the Seven into helping him seal the Zero Point. &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; answers the call, and is the leader of the Seven. Similar to the Visitor and the Scientist, he arrives in a meteor with a capsule encased inside. After a little bit of convincing from Jones (offering to get The Foundation to &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt;, and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sisters\"&gt;The Sisters&lt;/a&gt;\"), the Foundation helps him to fix the Zero Point. After realizing that the power of the Zero Point is too much because of the damage it has taken, the Foundation creates &lt;a href=\"The%20Spire\"&gt;The Spire&lt;/a&gt; and requests Jones to overload the &lt;a href=\"Portal%20Device\"&gt;Portal Device&lt;/a&gt; to seal in the Zero Point with him. Jones does what he says (even though it means that he will be stuck in &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;the loop&lt;/a&gt;), and the Zero Point and the Foundation is encased in the Spire successfully.\nIt was shown that when &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt; took &lt;a href=\"The%20Spire\"&gt;The Spire,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; was unsealed and blasted him into a large body of water.\nDuring , &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; still under water begins to reactivate, and eventually appears in Gotham Harbor, in Reality NF-1935. The Foundation assists Batman in sealing the rift in Metropolis, and returns to the Island, &lt;a href=\"The%20Batman%20Who%20Laughs\"&gt;The Batman Who Laughs&lt;/a&gt; manages to go back with him, and becomes trapped in the loop. The Foundation's suit is damaged in the brawl with &lt;a href=\"The%20Batman%20Who%20Laughs\"&gt;The Batman Who Laughs&lt;/a&gt;, causing him to be unimmune to the loop, but he escapes before the loop starts again. He remembers his goal, and sets off to find &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28Chapter%202%29\"&gt;The End (Chapter 2)&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Foundation breaks into &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and saves &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; was surprised by this, thinking he had died at some point in the past. The Foundation then removes his mask, revealing him to be played by none other than Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson himself. The Foundation then locked Slone inside the room by punching the door lock.\nJones and The Foundation then head into The Bridge. The Foundation reverses the gyroscopic orientation of the Island, while Jones fights off IO Guards. The Scientist and The Visitor, flying over the Island, rescue the loopers and bring them to safety inside the hidden bunker at &lt;a href=\"Guava%20Fort\"&gt;Guava Fort&lt;/a&gt;. The Visitor flies off while The Scientist leads &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;the Loopers&lt;/a&gt; into the bunker, after blowing up some Caretakers with a bomb.\nThe Scientist then leads the loopers through the Bridge as the Island begins to horizontally rotate and the complex starts to collapse. The players are led to &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;the Zero Point Chamber&lt;/a&gt; where they remain until a Caretaker smashes the skylight, causing the looper to emerge in the ocean, far from the Island.\nThe Island flipped, revealing the Seven's home, &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Their flipping of the Island was not only an attempt to stop &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%20Queen\"&gt;The Cube Queen&lt;/a&gt;, but also to severely cripple IO. The attack also leaves them vulnerable, meaning if IO were to attack, they would be finished. The Scientist, the Visitor, and the Foundation return to the Island and can be found as &lt;a href=\"Characters\"&gt;Characters&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Scientist attempts to contact the Paradigm, informing her the Seven need her help. He explains that they had more ambitious goals than simply flipping the Island, but also one step in a plan to reduce IO to a \"smoking crater.\" He also explains that they are vulnerable, and if IO were to attack, they would be finished. The Scientist says that their history is \"complicated\" and that something happened between the Paradigm and the rest of the Seven. He says that they do not deserve her help at all, but they need it.\nAfter sending that message, the Scientist broadcast to the rest of the Seven that they had received a ping from The Paradigm, but weren't entirely sure it was her and had to check. He tells the rest of the Seven that they need to think of her as an ally despite what happened, saying that they have a duty to overcome grudges and petty disagreements for the greater good and the sake of survival. He states that despite the past, there is no future without her.\nThe Scientist employs the help of the looper for various tasks throughout the season, such as stopping vandalism from Peelys or launching rockets. Near the end of the season, the Scientist finds out that the Looper has been listening in on his audio logs. He informs them that war is coming, and they should be prepared.\nThe Imagined Order finally unleash their attack on Artemis and The Seven prepares to defend the Island with the Resistance. As a giant drill emerges from underneath Artemis, proven to be the cause of the previous earthquakes plaguing the island. &lt;a href=\"Titan%20Tank\"&gt;Titan Tanks&lt;/a&gt; and Airships are deployed against the Loopers and The Seven, who clash with the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;invaders&lt;/a&gt;. The IO proceed to disable the building features, and overrun the defenders, who are subsequently saved by Doctor Strange, who opens a portal and reveals Iron Man, The Visitor, The Scientist, as well as Black Widow and two never-before seen members of the seven called &lt;a href=\"The%20Origin\"&gt;The Origin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Imagined\"&gt;The Imagined&lt;/a&gt;, with the latter being one of &lt;a href=\"the%20Sisters\"&gt;the Sisters&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Origin\"&gt;The Origin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Imagined\"&gt;The Imagined&lt;/a&gt; have the looper help them with various tasks throughout the season. The Imagined, with the help of &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;, restores building and establishes a communication link with &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt;. The Paradigm helps indirectly by sending schematics for the &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Anvil Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt;. Jones has the Looper teach &lt;a href=\"Peely\"&gt;Peely&lt;/a&gt; how to drive, among other things, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Origin\"&gt;The Origin&lt;/a&gt; gets them to do various wartime tasks such as security sweeps.\nAs the season progressed, the Resistance slowly pushed back the Imagined Order, claiming one location at a time. Eventually, the Imagined Order are pushed so far back, they only have control of &lt;a href=\"Command%20Cavern\"&gt;Command Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Fortress\"&gt;The Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, weeks later, an IO Doomsday Device was discovered under &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt;, later revealed to be &lt;a href=\"The%20Collider\"&gt;The Collider&lt;/a&gt;. The Seven begin to prepare for the final battle against the IO, starting by sabotaging the IO and simulating the activation of &lt;a href=\"The%20Collider\"&gt;The Collider&lt;/a&gt;. The simulation leads the Seven to discover that the Island is on the brink of being destroyed, prompting The Seven to recommission the &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Mecha&lt;/a&gt; and to attempt to bring &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt; back to the Island.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Visitor\"&gt;The Visitor&lt;/a&gt; comes up with a plan to stop &lt;a href=\"The%20Collider\"&gt;The Collider&lt;/a&gt; by using &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Mecha Team Leader&lt;/a&gt; that was left on &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; suggests that going to &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt; would be risky, but &lt;a href=\"Spider-Man%20Zero\"&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/a&gt; has the idea to call heroes from his reality to help them, specifically &lt;a href=\"Thor\"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Storm%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Storm&lt;/a&gt; with their abilities to manipulate the weather. &lt;a href=\"The%20Origin\"&gt;The Origin&lt;/a&gt; tasks the group heading to to retrieve &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Shard\"&gt;The Zero Shard&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone agrees and splits up.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Imagined\"&gt;The Imagined&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spider-Man%20Zero\"&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/a&gt; stealthily infiltrate &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. Jones guides everyone through &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, until he is distracted when he finds his office, and takes a picture of his late family with them. When they reach &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, they are stopped by &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gunnar\"&gt;Gunnar&lt;/a&gt;. Jones opens a Zero Point portal to &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Amarvel%3AEarth%20616\"&gt;Reality: 616&lt;/a&gt;, and he, Spider-Man, and The Imagined enter. On Slone's command, Gunnar strikes The Foundation through the ceiling. With her enemies out of the picture, Slone ignores the others with the little time they have left.\n&lt;a href=\"Spider-Man%20Zero\"&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Imagined\"&gt;The Imagined&lt;/a&gt; arrive in &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Amarvel%3AEarth%20616\"&gt;Reality: 616&lt;/a&gt;, and they quickly send the Avengers to the &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt; to help the resistance. They head to fetch &lt;a href=\"Wolverine%20Zero\"&gt;Wolverine&lt;/a&gt; to help track the &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Shard\"&gt;The Zero Shard&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Doom\"&gt;Doctor Doom&lt;/a&gt; is chosen by the inner circle of the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; to join them as a valued addition and &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt; is able to recruit him.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Imagined\"&gt;The Imagined&lt;/a&gt; is able to track &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Shard\"&gt;The Zero Shard&lt;/a&gt; at Mena Ngai, Wakanda. After a battle against the Wakandans, the princess of Wakanda, &lt;a href=\"Shuri\"&gt;Shuri&lt;/a&gt;, quickly dispatches the fight and welcomes the group into Wakanda. Although The Imagined's tech is not able to trace down the exact location of the Zero Shard due to Wakanda's Vibranium interfering, Wolverine's scent determines that The Zero Shard was no longer there, and the smell of lizards remained. When Shuri leads the group to Serpent Valley, they discover a base guarded by &lt;a href=\"Hybrid%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Hybrids&lt;/a&gt;. As the group battles the lizard ninjas, the base is destroyed and they lose the trail for the Zero Shard. &lt;a href=\"Spider-Man%20Zero\"&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/a&gt; suggests heading to the Savage Land to find Stegron the Dinosaur Man, who is most likely responsible for taking the Zero Shard.\nThe Foundation, Scientist, Iron Man arrives on &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt; safely with help of &lt;a href=\"Thor\"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Storm%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Storm&lt;/a&gt;'s weather calming abilities. The group finds the broken &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Mecha Team Leader&lt;/a&gt; lying on the icy surface with &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt; alive in the mech. The Paradigm is awaken from stasis, and attempts to convince &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; that she is not a traitor, as her reason for siding with the IO during &lt;a href=\"The%20Final%20Showdown\"&gt;The Final Showdown&lt;/a&gt; was to prevent them from building a doomsday device that could destroy the entire island along with &lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer\"&gt;The Devourer&lt;/a&gt;. She goes on to explain that their plan to repair to the mech would not work unless they had a power source, unknowing of\nBack in Earth 616, &lt;a href=\"Spider-Man%20Zero\"&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Imagined\"&gt;The Imagined&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wolverine%20Zero\"&gt;Wolverine&lt;/a&gt;, and Shuri travel to the Savage Land, where they manage to find more &lt;a href=\"Hybrid%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Hybrids&lt;/a&gt;. After defeating them all, the group camp for the night. The Imagined explains her relationship to &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt; to Wolverine as Jones explains his past with the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; to Spider-Man and how he worked with them to ensure his family's safety, but was never able to rest with them when they all passed and he remained immortal. The next day, Wolverine and Shuri tracked the Hybrids to a lab in the Savage Land, where they find Stegron and primal creations of the High Evolutionary using the power of &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Shard\"&gt;The Zero Shard&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe group battles the High Evolutionary and Stegron as a distraction for Spider-Man to break into the lab, only to discover that leading the group to the lab and battling the High Evolutionary was &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Doom\"&gt;Doctor Doom's&lt;/a&gt; plan to steal &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Shard\"&gt;The Zero Shard&lt;/a&gt; himself using the Hybrids as his minions. As Doctor Doom uses the Zero Shard to escape, the battle against the High Evolutionary ends, as he only wanted to defend the Zero Shard. The High Evolutionary informs the group that Doctor Doom traveled to &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt;, and the group quickly use Jones' &lt;a href=\"Portal%20Device\"&gt;Portal Device&lt;/a&gt; to chase after him.\nThe group track &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Doom\"&gt;Doctor Doom&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt;, where they find a castle trapping &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20King%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;The Ice King&lt;/a&gt; and several of the powerful items he collected in ice. &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt; proceeds to become colder despite &lt;a href=\"Thor\"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Storm%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Storm's&lt;/a&gt; efforts. &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Doom\"&gt;Doctor Doom&lt;/a&gt; appears and battles them using &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Shard\"&gt;The Zero Shard&lt;/a&gt; and many of the powerful items in the castle. Despite his efforts, &lt;a href=\"Spider-Man%20Zero\"&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/a&gt; is able to retrieve &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Shard\"&gt;The Zero Shard&lt;/a&gt; and get it to the &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Mecha&lt;/a&gt;, fully repaired but requiring a power source. With &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Shard\"&gt;The Zero Shard&lt;/a&gt;, the Mecha is repaired and &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Doom\"&gt;Doctor Doom&lt;/a&gt; flees to the Island. The Mecha retrieves the group on the ground, destroys &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20King%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;The Ice King's&lt;/a&gt; castle, and prepares to travel to the Island.\n&lt;a href=\"Collision\"&gt;Collision&lt;/a&gt; /.\nBefore the launch of the event, &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt; and members of The Seven conversed with each other, preparing for the attack. 90 seconds before launch, &lt;a href=\"The%20Origin\"&gt;The Origin&lt;/a&gt; gave the Loopers a mission briefing, stating that The Seven has intercepted communications from &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt; originally intended for &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt;, believing that the Imagined Order's weapon system, &lt;a href=\"The%20Collider\"&gt;The Collider&lt;/a&gt;, will be soon reaching critical mass sooner than they had expected. If it is not stopped now, it will destroy all life on the island. The Origin then introduces the Loopers to the one who will be leading the mission and piloting the the &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Strike%20Commander\"&gt;Mecha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt;. The Paradigm enters the Mecha, and The Origin tells the Loopers that they will be handling the weapons while The Paradigm mans the helm of the Mecha. The Origin then leaves the rest to The Paradigm before signing off. The Paradigm then tells the Loopers of the plan: putting an end to the Imagined Order once and for all, with the main target being The Collider. The Paradigm then contacts the ground team, led by &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt;, who tells her that they'll have the shields down by the time they reach the island. Afterwards, The Paradigm initiates the launch sequence and the Loopers head to their battle stations. The Mecha blasts off from &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt; and begins their journey to &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt;, with The Loopers clearing a path to it by destroying incoming asteroids and dodging &lt;a href=\"Abductors\"&gt;Abductor&lt;/a&gt; debris along the way. \nThe Mecha prepares for re-entry onto the island. The Mecha lands at &lt;a href=\"Synapse%20Station\"&gt;Synapse Station&lt;/a&gt;, only to be greeted by battalions of the Imagined Order's &lt;a href=\"Titan%20Tank\"&gt;tanks&lt;/a&gt;. As the Mecha fights its way towards the Collider, it is struck by a laser from &lt;a href=\"The%20Fortress\"&gt;The Fortress&lt;/a&gt;. The Paradigm redirects power to the heartbreaker, in which the Mecha fires a laser back at The Fortress, destroying the location. The Mecha resumes its path towards the Collider, but is then overwhelmed by a barrage of missiles from &lt;a href=\"IO%20Airships\"&gt;IO Airships&lt;/a&gt;, heavily damaging it. Agent Jones contacts The Paradigm to see if she's ok, with her replying that she is albeit barely. She tells Jones that the Mecha cannot move or function without repairs, which prompts Jones to send in &lt;a href=\"Peely\"&gt;Peely&lt;/a&gt; to deliver a Slurp truck using a &lt;a href=\"Cars%23Titano%2520Mudflap\"&gt;Mudflap&lt;/a&gt;. The Mecha then grabs the Slurp truck and heals itself with it by crushing the truck in its fist and The Paradigm pouring the &lt;a href=\"Slurp\"&gt;Slurp&lt;/a&gt; onto it, while diverting power to the Mecha's emergency recovery system. After finishing up the Slurp, the Mecha throws the depleted Slurp truck at a IO airship, destroying it. The Slurp not only restored the Mecha's functions, much to The Paradigm's surprise, it also overcharged the weapons of the Mecha, thus negating weapon overheating.\nAs the Mecha drew nearer to the Collider, the IO began to send in &lt;a href=\"B.R.U.T.E.\"&gt;B.R.U.T.E.s&lt;/a&gt; to attack the it. Eventually, Agent Jones and the ground team disable the shield protecting the Collider, exposing it. The Mecha then pulls out its &lt;a href=\"Light%20Blade\"&gt;Light Blade&lt;/a&gt;, slashing through the remaining IO Airships as it made a beeline towards to the Collider. After the final IO vehicles have been destroyed, the Mecha reaches the Collider and prepares to destroy it as The Paradigm diverts all power to the Light Blade. However, before this can happen, an earthquake causes the ground beneath the Mecha to collapse, and the Mecha falls into the ground below, with The Paradigm and the Loopers being ejected from the Mecha.\nThe Loopers land at the bottom of the Collider, where they are met by Agent Jones. However, &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; appears in a &lt;a href=\"Titan%20Tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt; and begins to attack them. Jones and the Loopers, both armed with an &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Rifle\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, make their ascent towards the Collider, where alongside &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, they fight their way through &lt;a href=\"IO%20Guards\"&gt;IO Guards&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"B.R.U.T.E.\"&gt;B.R.U.T.E.&lt;/a&gt; while evading Slone's attacks from her tank. At the same time, The Paradigm attempts to get the Mecha back online. As the group fights their way up to the Collider, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; has been exposed, and it begins to rise towards the top of the Collider, shifting realities along the way. The Paradigm manages to get the Mecha back online, but the group is stopped by Slone and her tank. Jones distracts Slone with a speech, and The Paradigm uses the Mecha's fist to crush Slone and her tank, destroying part of the bridge.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt; joins the battle on the collider upper levels and fight against his daughters. Though Geno doesn't want to kill them, The Imagined sacrifices herself and falls into The Zero Point alongside Geno. Geno seemingly unharmed, angrily commands the IO to wipe these failures out of existence before entering the Zero Point.\nThe Paradigm then begins to lift the Loopers, Jones, and The Foundation upwards towards the top of the Collider, with the latter two jumping into the Zero Point when it focuses on &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt;. The Loopers then fire upon the four crystal detonators that are lifting the Zero Point up to the Collider. The Loopers destroy all four crystal detonators, and the Zero Point falls back below. The Collider then begins to collapse, and The Paradigm protects the Loopers by putting the Mecha's hand over them, shielding them from the Collider's destruction.\nMeanwhile, Jones and the Foundation enter Geno's reality, where they fist bump. They get to see &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Imagined\"&gt;The Imagined&lt;/a&gt; slowly discorporate, getting scattered across The Omniverse. Geno's remants travel through multiple Realities, winding up at a singular spot and reforming Geno.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;The Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; is defeated; The Seven regained control of the island. The Scientist however has noticed something was wrong with The &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; as the reality tree was draining its power. The Zero Point then summons relics from other reality's and sends the looper to collect them. The scientist realizes the Zero Point is bringing them in as a distress message/signal. Near the end of the season &lt;a href=\"The%20Imagined\"&gt;The Imagined&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Order\"&gt;The Order&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; have gone missing. &lt;a href=\"The%20Origin\"&gt;The Origin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Visitor\"&gt;The Visitor,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; head to Sanctuary's underground laboratory to analyze The Chrome that's infecting the island. Sometime later, &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt; joins them underground. During the analysis the Chrome multiplied brutally and consumed The Scientist, The Origin and The Visitor. However, The Paradigm manages to escape the laboratory before it was consumed and crashes into loot lake where she uses The Zero Point to escape to Reality 659. \nWith the members of The Seven missing and &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt; gone in as seen in the Chapter 3 Season 4 Cinematic Trailer, &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; reactivates &lt;a href=\"AMIE\"&gt;AMIE&lt;/a&gt; and contacts &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to figure out what's going on and find a solution. The group managed to recontact The Paradigm who explained something to them about &lt;a href=\"The%20Nothing\"&gt;The Nothing&lt;/a&gt; but the message mentioning The Nothing was slightly distorted. a little later, they find themselves trying to finish The Scientist's experiments on Chrome, However being inconclusive they set about researching The Origin's battle plan. After finding her, The Looper and AMIE attack &lt;a href=\"The%20Herald\"&gt;The Herald&lt;/a&gt; and defeat her, however the chrome is still there. The Paradigm sends them a last message telling them that she must cut off communications and asks them to hold on. Jones then tells The Looper that he will contact him later when the second phase of the plan is active.\n&lt;a href=\"Fracture\"&gt;Fracture&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to rebuild a new island by initiating Zero Fusion after &lt;a href=\"The%20Herald\"&gt;The Herald&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the Island, The Paradigm asks The Looper, AMIE, and Jones to retrieve the fragments from Zero Point in order to restore its energy. After that Paradigm speaks her last words to the group and initiates the Zero Fusion, seeming to be initiating at the cost of her sacrifice.\nThe Paradigm is taken by the Zero Point to the new island and disappears shortly after leaving one last message for AMIE and The Looper.\nAfter AMIE's mission goes beyond our reach, plus Jones' inactivity, &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; became the organization's last active member. It\u2019s heavily implied that The Seven are being sculpted into something new.\nA stolen artifact related to the Seven called \"Looper Calendar\" can be found deep within &lt;a href=\"Kado%20Thorne\"&gt;Kado Thorne&lt;/a&gt;'s estate. It features the symbols of all members of the Seven except for The Imagined and The Order.\nGoing back in time under Dr Slone's orders, Jones collaborated with one or more members of the Seven of that alternate past to use the Blackhole which would end Athena and create new worlds known as galaxies in the aftermath of The Big Bang. This plan, would allow the inhabitants of Asteria in the future to be able to escape and find refuge. \n&lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Bang\"&gt;The Big Bang&lt;/a&gt;.\nJones or a member of The Seven piloted the rocket on which the Time Machine was attached, and thanks to it, 6 other rockets appeared and allowed to unfreeze the meteor and rift it above the Zero Point. Subsequently with time machine, the rockets made the temporal existence of the meteor unstable, making it constantly change before colliding it with the Zero Point. Much like &lt;a href=\"The%20End\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt;, this created a black hole that completely absorbed Athena, however the the instability of the meteor's existence caused by the Time Machine allowed the Black Hole to directly explode as Jones intended, generating a new Big Bang that created multiple Galaxies and Realities, such as Helios' Galaxy, the LEGO Galaxy, Rocket Racing's Galaxy and Festival's Galaxy and countless others.\nWhat happened to the members of The Seven of the alternate past after the Big Bang in unknown. As for the present memebrs, despite them being still gone, &lt;a href=\"Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; continue carry their legacy, fighting for reality as they always did.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nOther.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

They were a corrupt group of wealthy individuals founded by &lt;a href=\"Montague\"&gt;Montague&lt;/a&gt; and lead by him and four other bosses. The last generation of bosses wished to find &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt; to get more power, thinking themselves as gods.\nThey were the main antagonist faction of .\nOverview.\nThe Society presents itself as a conglomerate run by elites. With the exception of &lt;a href=\"Silas%20Hesk\"&gt;Silas Hesk&lt;/a&gt;, all the elites of the Island have joined The Society. They are the owners of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Glacier\"&gt;Grand Glacier Hotel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reckless%20Railways\"&gt;Reckless Railways&lt;/a&gt;'s Grand Station as well as the &lt;a href=\"Train\"&gt;Train&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fencing%20Fields\"&gt;Fencing Fields&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lavish%20Lair\"&gt;Lavish Lair&lt;/a&gt; castle, &lt;a href=\"Snooty%20Steppes\"&gt;Snooty Steppes&lt;/a&gt; village, &lt;a href=\"The%20Marigold\"&gt;The Marigold&lt;/a&gt; Yacht and some smaller mansions, villas and bases. \nIn truth, they are a corrupt group, an order made up of elites seeking power and a strict class hierarchy. All the families members of The Society are part of the lineage of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Pantheon\"&gt;Greek Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. They are led by five bosses: &lt;a href=\"Valeria\"&gt;Valeria&lt;/a&gt; the most notorious Boss, &lt;a href=\"Montague\"&gt;Montague&lt;/a&gt; the original founder, &lt;a href=\"Oscar\"&gt;Oscar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nisha\"&gt;Nisha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Griffin\"&gt;Peter Griffin&lt;/a&gt;. They are opposed by &lt;a href=\"The%20Underground\"&gt;The Underground&lt;/a&gt;, a faction of fighters and rebels wishing to put an end to their group. \nAs of , The Society has been largely defeated and broken up because of &lt;a href=\"The%20Underground\"&gt;The Underground&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Pantheon\"&gt;The Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, with only a few active members remaining. \nAs of , only some remnants remain, acting as a company responsible for the Island's railway system, Lavish Lair, Reckless Railways and Grand Glacier Hotel. \nAs of , &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Doom\"&gt;Kingdom of Doom&lt;/a&gt; took control of the Island railways system, however they didn't took over &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Station\"&gt;Grand Station&lt;/a&gt;, for an unknown reason. Lavish Lair was also replaced by &lt;a href=\"Doomstadt\"&gt;Doomstadt&lt;/a&gt;, leaving only &lt;a href=\"Reckless%20Railways\"&gt;Reckless Railways&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Glacier\"&gt;Grand Glacier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Steppes\"&gt;Sandy Steppes&lt;/a&gt; under the control of The Society. However, after &lt;a href=\"Absolute%20Doom%20Event\"&gt;Absolute Doom Event&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reckless%20Railways\"&gt;Reckless Railways&lt;/a&gt; disappeared and was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Freaky%20Fields\"&gt;Freaky Fields&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations, Members and Technology.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nFormer Bases.\nVehicles.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nHistory.\nPost-&lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Bang\"&gt;Big Bang&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Society was founded at an unknown time period several decades if not centuries ago by &lt;a href=\"Montague\"&gt;Montague&lt;/a&gt;, who presented his idea to the other elites of the Island during an an inauguration in &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Glacier\"&gt;Grand Glacier&lt;/a&gt;. This led elites such as &lt;a href=\"Nisha\"&gt;Nisha&lt;/a&gt;'s and &lt;a href=\"Valeria\"&gt;Valeria&lt;/a&gt;'s family to join The Society. Decades later and once they were born, &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nisha\"&gt;Nisha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valeria\"&gt;Valeria&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kavel\"&gt;Kavel&lt;/a&gt; were raised in The Society. Nisha and Valeria later took the place of their parents as heads of their respective families and rose to the highest rank, joining Montague at the top of The Society. &lt;a href=\"Oscar\"&gt;Oscar&lt;/a&gt; was also offered a place after having climbed the ranks when he was an outsider. &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Griffin\"&gt;Peter Griffin&lt;/a&gt;, after becoming quite strong thanks to &lt;a href=\"Meowscles\"&gt;Meowscles&lt;/a&gt;' expired Slurp, became rich and also joined The Society becoming one of the bosses under unknown circumstances. \nThe Society gradually took control of the Island hiring goons and people like &lt;a href=\"Killian\"&gt;Killian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clara\"&gt;Clara&lt;/a&gt; to become their Operators, along with all other elites joining their cause, except &lt;a href=\"Silas%20Hesk\"&gt;Silas Hesk&lt;/a&gt;, who decided to stand against them despite the multiple invitations to join the organization from &lt;a href=\"Montague\"&gt;Montague&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, Hope realizing how terrible they were, was driven by her sense of justice, rejected the ideals of The Society and left the organization before founding &lt;a href=\"The%20Underground\"&gt;The Underground&lt;/a&gt;, a rebel organization dedicated to fighting The Society that &lt;a href=\"Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; later joined. Seeking more power, Valeria would dig into her grandfather's old books on &lt;a href=\"The%20Pantheon\"&gt;The Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; where she would read about the powers of &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt;, she would share her findings with the other leaders leading them to search for &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt;. Believing Jones had the answers, the Bosses kidnapped Peely. By this period, the bosses each had a medallion with a fraction of the gods' power to make themselves stronger, it's unknown when they got them and how nor if previous generations bosses had their own.\nHowever, this plan backfired, as Jones, who had no knowledge of the Box yet was willing to go to extreme measures to save his friend, went to war with them with the help of &lt;a href=\"The%20Underground\"&gt;The Underground&lt;/a&gt; led by Valeria's younger sister &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; as a collective resistance against the Society.\nOver the course of the &lt;a href=\"Takedown%20Quests\"&gt;Takedown Quests&lt;/a&gt;; Jones, Hope, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; work together to eliminate Legion Guards and Elites, steal Society &lt;a href=\"Medallions\"&gt;Medallions&lt;/a&gt;, and defeat the leaders of the Society, which culminate in Jones finally &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Peely%20Rescue\"&gt;rescuing Peely&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Fencing%20Fields\"&gt;Fencing Fields&lt;/a&gt;. These attacks cause the Society's control of the Island to begin to falter. However, Valeria continued her search for &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Ruined%20Reels\"&gt;Ruined Reels&lt;/a&gt;, where she set up a new camp. \nAs The Society's power continued to dwindle, a strange traveler arrived on the Island, named &lt;a href=\"Odyssey\"&gt;Odyssey&lt;/a&gt;, and a strange Mosaic that bears a warning was discovered. After hearing about The Looper and seeing part of their fate, she recruited them to help her in her research about The Mosaic that she believed to herald something and that it's linked to the ancient power that she feels on the Island. As The Looper managed to find more fragments of The Mosaic, Odyssey revealed that the Society Medallions that the leaders of The Society possessed, contained a fragment of this power, and that this same power grows stronger. Later, after a series of earthquakes near Valeria's camp, a &lt;a href=\"The%20Hand\"&gt;giant hand&lt;/a&gt; emerged from the ground, holding the chained Pandora's Box, meaning Valeria finally found it. Sometime later, the box was broken free from the chains by Valeria, and unleashed a giant beam of light and countless souls out of the box.\nAfter opening Pandora's Box, Valeria disappeared, and the gods arrived on the Island with &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; intending to put an end to mortalkind. The Society is largely defeated by &lt;a href=\"The%20Underground\"&gt;The Underground&lt;/a&gt;, with only a few members such as &lt;a href=\"Montague\"&gt;Montague&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oscar\"&gt;Oscar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nisha\"&gt;Nisha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kavel\"&gt;Kavel&lt;/a&gt;. Valeria contacts &lt;a href=\"Clara\"&gt;Clara&lt;/a&gt;, a Society Member , for an unknown mission. Montague, viewing his Society as godlike and unstoppable, confronts the wrathful gods with the remnants of The Society, notably &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;, on several occasions with little to no success. The Society members including &lt;a href=\"Valeria\"&gt;Valeria&lt;/a&gt; proven no match for the gods, barely surviving their wrath. After this &lt;a href=\"Montague\"&gt;Montague&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valeria\"&gt;Valeria&lt;/a&gt; both escaped the Island, with Valeria draining The Society coffers while &lt;a href=\"Oscar\"&gt;Oscar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nisha\"&gt;Nisha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kavel\"&gt;Kavel&lt;/a&gt; when into hiding, keeping a low profile for a while.\nAfter this, The Society's remaining minor bases were abandoned by the &lt;a href=\"Minions\"&gt;Minions&lt;/a&gt; who guarded them. The organization is no more than just a company and a group of elites now, still being responsible for the Island's railway system, the entirety of Reckless Railways and the management of the Grand Glacier Hotel, but without the power they once had. However as The Society stopped paying No Sweat Insurance, &lt;a href=\"The%20Underwriter\"&gt;The Underwriter&lt;/a&gt; attacked one of their remaining infrastructure: the train and took it out of service.\n&lt;a href=\"Oscar\"&gt;Oscar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nisha\"&gt;Nisha&lt;/a&gt; later came out of hiding after the gods had left the Island. Oscar returned to take back everything he lost, he settled at &lt;a href=\"Classy%20Courts\"&gt;Classy Courts&lt;/a&gt;. He holds little to no grudges against &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Peely\"&gt;Peely&lt;/a&gt;, and\nis just determined to continue life and recover everything he lost. \nSince the fall of The Society and &lt;a href=\"Fencing%20Fields\"&gt;Fencing Fields&lt;/a&gt; disappearance, Nisha must rebuild her life from scratch. Hope, believing in Nisha, tries to convince her to fight for something good. Jones also try to convince her.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt; brought Latveria to the Island along with The Raft and created his &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Doom\"&gt;new kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, The Society restored their train and &lt;a href=\"Orchard%20Station\"&gt;Orchard Station&lt;/a&gt;. However &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt; took control of it and painted it in his image, taking over the whole railways system, though he did not take control of Grand Station. &lt;a href=\"Nisha\"&gt;Nisha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kavel\"&gt;Kavel&lt;/a&gt; finally decided to reluctantly join &lt;a href=\"The%20Underground\"&gt;The Underground&lt;/a&gt;, turning their back on their Society brethren.\n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;, the last of The Pantheon still on the island later reveals to &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; that \"every family\" in The Society, including Hope's and Nisha's are from the lineage of &lt;a href=\"The%20Pantheon\"&gt;The Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, making &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valeria\"&gt;Valeria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nisha\"&gt;Nisha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kavel\"&gt;Kavel&lt;/a&gt; and potentially &lt;a href=\"Montague\"&gt;Montague&lt;/a&gt; descendants of Greek Gods. After The Undergrounds fight against Doom, a &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Beacon\"&gt;Rift Beacon&lt;/a&gt; was sent flying, landing at &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Glacier\"&gt;Grand Glacier&lt;/a&gt; where it began to malfunction merging &lt;a href=\"Ultima%20Carver\"&gt;Ultima Carver&lt;/a&gt;'s Halloween Reality with the hotel, leading it to be consumed by pumpkins and vines.\n&lt;a href=\"Chapter%202%20Remix\"&gt;Chapter 2 Remix&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; would contact &lt;a href=\"Valeria\"&gt;Valeria&lt;/a&gt;, to talk about her own future as well as the Island's future. She encourages Valeria to meet up with The Underground and rebuild things with the help of &lt;a href=\"Nisha\"&gt;Nisha&lt;/a&gt;, saying that otherwise The Underground wouldn't stay gone."}

She appears to only show her true emotions in front of her brother, and is always ready to use her katana on anyone who dares to harm him.\nHistory.\nIn the cinematic trailer, she can be seen riding a &lt;a href=\"Victory%20Crown%20Rogue\"&gt;Rogue Bike&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"MEGA%20City\"&gt;MEGA City&lt;/a&gt;.

Her brother's exit of the &lt;a href=\"River%20Guard\"&gt;River Guard&lt;/a&gt; has only strained prexistent tensions, and she threatens &lt;a href=\"Drift\"&gt;Drift&lt;/a&gt; as he appears to have taken a mentor-like role towards &lt;a href=\"Stray\"&gt;Stray&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate%20Quests\"&gt;Syndicate Quests&lt;/a&gt;, impressed by &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;'s swordsmanship, she agreed to unite with the &lt;a href=\"Peace%20Syndicate\"&gt;Peace Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; as an ally if they can secure them a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Clan\"&gt;Fox Clan&lt;/a&gt;. As a result she later attends a dinner between the three groups, and the &lt;a href=\"River%20Guard\"&gt;River Guard&lt;/a&gt;'s historic rivalry with the clan is cleared, forming peace between the Syndicates.\n&lt;a href=\"Mizuki\"&gt;Mizuki&lt;/a&gt; returned to her home reality: , residing in &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Lake\"&gt;Lost Lake&lt;/a&gt; alongside the rest of the &lt;a href=\"River%20Guard\"&gt;River Guard&lt;/a&gt;. Upon the emergence of magic and elemental masks on the island, she reflects on the Guard's history with the &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Clan\"&gt;Fox Clan&lt;/a&gt;, as well as their mended relationship.\nDespite her worries, Mizuki appears to be on good terms with the &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Clan\"&gt;Fox Clan&lt;/a&gt; and their members - greeting &lt;a href=\"Vi\"&gt;Vi&lt;/a&gt; with the reassurance that she and the Guard seek no trouble, and looks out for &lt;a href=\"Stray\"&gt;her brother&lt;/a&gt;, warning him to keep his eyes sharp. Despite her earlier threats towards &lt;a href=\"Drift\"&gt;Drift&lt;/a&gt;, she now appears to be neutral in regards to him.\nLike &lt;a href=\"Vi\"&gt;Vi&lt;/a&gt;, she expresses a disliking and weariness of &lt;a href=\"Daigo\"&gt;Daigo&lt;/a&gt; and his family.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

They come in four varieties:\nOther.\nThere are a few other monsters that do not follow the typical siege behavior and spawn mechanics of Husks and Mist Monsters.\nBoss Monsters.\nEpic Mini-Bosses are more powerful than average Husks and come with a random set of buffs and modifiers.

Montague loves challenges and dangerous situations as according to him, feeling his heart race is a flawless sensation. However, Montague strongly believes in the oligarchic system, more precisely in plutocracy, that is to say that the richest must rule. This is why he created &lt;a href=\"The%20Society\"&gt;The Society&lt;/a&gt;, in order to establish his vision on the island. Over time he would end up believing himself to be a god and sought to obtain their power, before having to face the end of his dream by true gods. This event revealed his coward side, as he fled the Island just like Valeria to survive without facing the consequences of his acts.\nAppearance.\nMontague appears as a middle aged man with black and white hair and a very slim build. He wears an amulet containing a blue relic similar to the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Relic\"&gt;Ruby Relic&lt;/a&gt;, the one that &lt;a href=\"Valeria\"&gt;Valeria&lt;/a&gt; owns. He also has complete heterochromia iridum, with his left iris being brown and his right iris being blue.\nTimeline.\nMontague founded &lt;a href=\"The%20Society\"&gt;The Society&lt;/a&gt; and united all of the &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt;'s most rich and powerful elites together, in an effort to find more power and wealth for himself. He invited the &lt;a href=\"Silas%20Hesk\"&gt;Hesk&lt;/a&gt; family, to join the Society multiple times, only to be routinely denied with their youngest &lt;a href=\"Silas%20Hesk\"&gt;heir&lt;/a&gt; deciding to stand against them and join the side of &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Valeria\"&gt;Valeria&lt;/a&gt; would later convince him and the other bosses to join her in the search for &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt;, promising them greater power. Montague would stay at &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Glacier\"&gt;Grand Glacier&lt;/a&gt; with his &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Guards\"&gt;Legion Guards&lt;/a&gt; guarding his territory while &lt;a href=\"Nisha\"&gt;Nisha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oscar\"&gt;Oscar&lt;/a&gt; kidnapped &lt;a href=\"Peely\"&gt;Peely&lt;/a&gt;, and Valeria searching for the Box's location. During the &lt;a href=\"Takedown%20Quests\"&gt;Takedown Quests&lt;/a&gt;, Montague and the other Society bosses were defeated by &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;, Jones and &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;, leaving most of The Society in shambles, and all bosses without their &lt;a href=\"Medallions\"&gt;Medallions&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Valeria\"&gt;Valeria&lt;/a&gt; opened &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Pantheon\"&gt;The Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; arrive on the Island to punish all mortals, with Zeus planning to eliminate them all starting with the mortals who originally caused this mess, that being The Society.

{"id": "86720", "revid": "49186139", "url": "https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki?curid=86720", "title": "Movement", "text": "Movement is a Gameplay Mechanic in &lt;a href=\"Fortnite\"&gt;Fortnite&lt;/a&gt;. It dictates how the player is able to traverse the map or location, and the different states they can be in as they do so.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nOverview.\nPlayer movement is tied to several states, and can be affected by various items and mechanics in game. Players have 19 states of movement:\nEach of these states of movement allow players to move at different speeds, and traverse different environments using them. Some items allow players to be in any state whilst using them, whilst others restrict some states and force players to be in one or two of them. Controller players allow for any movement direction, where the player moving does not face the same direction as the camera, making it possible to sprint diagonally. For Keyboard players the diagonal movement is limited to 45 degrees by default, but can be changed in the game settings.\nStates.\nThe following table shows what actions can be done whilst in the state of movement\nStamina.\nStamina is a feature which restricts movement and puts it on a cooldown. Players drain their stamina by Sprinting, or Dashing whilst using items like the &lt;a href=\"Howler%20Claws\"&gt;Howler Claws&lt;/a&gt; or in a &lt;a href=\"Chrome\"&gt;Chrome Blob&lt;/a&gt;, and jumping drains stamina faster. The bar regenerates slowly, as long as the player does not attempt to sprint or take any other action which uses the resource. &lt;a href=\"Slap%20Juice\"&gt;Slap Juice&lt;/a&gt; gives you unlimited stamina for a limited time, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Augments\"&gt;More Parkour&lt;/a&gt; Augment when mantling or hurdling.\nStates.\nStanding.\nStanding is the default state in which players are put into for most situations. They are at their maximum height whilst standing. The only time a player cannot be standing is when they are forced into a crouch state by an environmental factor, such as a low ceiling. \nCrouching.\nCrouching is the secondary state in the game, where most items that require the player stand can also be used in this state. Crouching is immobilised by some items, or has a different use, such as with the &lt;a href=\"Sneaky%20Snowman\"&gt;Sneaky Snowman&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Prop%20Disguise\"&gt;becoming a prop&lt;/a&gt;. Players are also more accurate shooting weapons when they are crouched. \nJogging.\nJogging is enabled with the \"Force Jog\" setting and is slower than running.\nRunning.\nRunning is the primary state of movement in the game. Running dictates any movement which is not sprinting, and includes a slow walk possible with the use of a controller. Players can run backwards and sideways. Players gain an accuracy penalty whilst firing in this state. \nCrouch Running + Jogging.\nCrouch Running and Crouch Jogging are both methods of movement whilst remaining crouched. The purpose of these methods of movement is to reduce player footstep audio, as well as allow for more accuracy when firing weapons. Players will move slower when Crouch running and jogging than their non-crouched counterparts.\nTactical Sprinting.\nSprinting is a faster state of movement and is affected by stamina. The player will put away their weapon and run much faster. Sprinting is the fastest movement speed possible without the use of items, and also allows players to bash through closed doors to open them.\nSliding.\nSliding can be initiated by sprinting and holding down the crouch button. Doing so will cause the player to shrink their profile to crouch height, and keep the momentum you had pre-slide. This also causes the camera to shake and the players field of view to increase slightly. Players can slide on any surface, but will slide for much longer and faster on a decline, and slower on an incline. Attempting to use a healing item, or anything else that requires you be stationary is not possible, as the timer will start but be immediately interrupted. Players can slide into doors to open them. Players gain an accuracy penalty whilst firing in this state. Players who slide into an opponent kick them, knocking back the opponent and if a player slides into an object, the object will take a small amount of damage. Sliding which &lt;a href=\"Mud\"&gt;Mud&lt;/a&gt; will double the speed you slide normally.\nSkidding.\nSkidding is a state that is essentially a mix of falling and sliding. This happens when you are falling off terrain or a prop that goes downward but not straight down. Generally this prevents fall damage, and sliding after skidding will give you a faster slide than normal.\nJumping + Falling.\nJumping is a movement ability that allows the player to gain vertical momentum. Jumping multiple times in a row will eventually disable forward momentum. Jumping whilst firing a weapon will grant the least accuracy of any state. Falling grants the same negative effects, at the cost of potential &lt;a href=\"fall%20damage\"&gt;fall damage&lt;/a&gt;,\nMantling.\nIf a surface is too high for the player to jump to, or a platform is too far when landing, the player will pull themselves up when reaching it. This enables players to reach higher elevations without building. If you mantle from a high fall, it will cancel fall damage.\nHurdling.\nWhen running up to short obstructions or an exposed window the player can choose to hurdle over it, putting them past the object. Hurdling does not drain stamina.\n&lt;a href=\"Swimming\"&gt;Swimming&lt;/a&gt;, Wading, + Swim Jumping.\nSwimming is the state a player is put into when entering water. Players can float stationary, can move in all directions by pressing the movement keys, and can jump whilst swimming to constantly leap out of the water for high movement speeds.\nAlthough players can be moved by currents in water, they will still be treated as being still, and can do the previously noted actions normally.\n&lt;a href=\"Glider%20Redeploy\"&gt;Gliding&lt;/a&gt;.\nGliding is when a player is moving through the air using a &lt;a href=\"Gliders\"&gt;Glider&lt;/a&gt;. It is faster than moving normally but disables all function aside from moving in any direction. There is an augment called Aerialist which lets you Glider Redeploy at any time.\nSkydiving.\nSkydiving is a state only accessed when either: Jumping from the Battle Bus; Using an item like a &lt;a href=\"Launch%20Pad\"&gt;Launch Pad&lt;/a&gt;; or in Certain &lt;a href=\"Live%20Events\"&gt;Live Events&lt;/a&gt; or certain &lt;a href=\"Creative%20Showcases\"&gt;Creative Islands&lt;/a&gt;. It allows the player to freefall at high speeds and deploy their &lt;a href=\"Glider\"&gt;Glider&lt;/a&gt;. Skydiving is faster than Gliding. When the player gets about 100 meters above the ground immediately under them, their glider will automatically deploy, and cannot be undeployed by default; while things like &lt;a href=\"Slipstreams\"&gt;Slipstreams&lt;/a&gt; can give players their redeploy back.\nFlying.\nFlying is only present in and allows the player to move at high speeds whilst essentially standing. It is enabled by jumping twice in quick succession. Players can fly up and down and adjust their flying speed with the crouch button.\nExtra States, Rules and Exceptions.\nSome items/mechanics will change your movement speed, but potentially disable other features whilst doing so.\nOverview.\nPlayer movement is tied to several states, and can be affected by various items and mechanics in game. Players have 8 states of movement:\nEach of these states of movement allow players to move at different speeds, and traverse different environments using them. Some items allow players to be in any state whilst using them, whilst others restrict some states and force players to be in one or two of them. Controller players allow for any movement direction, where the player moving does not face the same direction as the camera, making it possible to sprint diagonally. For Keyboard players the diagonal movement is limited to 45 degrees by default, but can be changed in the game settings.\nSave the World.\nThe movement speed perk on Melee Weapons increases base movement speed from 5% () up to 14% (). Using the War Cry Soldier ability temporary increases movement speed.\nThe following mechanics will cause a reduction in movement speed other than weapons:\nHistory.\nEarly Access Release.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The online tests ran in Unreal Engine 4, unlike the current version which runs on UE5. Users were sent invitations by Epic Games to try out these versions under a now expired NDA (Non Disclosure Agreement). The first online test, OT1, began on December 2, 2014 and concluded on December 19. The final online test, OT11.1.0 was began on July 7, 2017 and concluded on July 15, ten days before the game entered early access. \nOut of all of the online tests, only &lt;a href=\"Online%20Test%206.5\"&gt;Online Test 6.5&lt;/a&gt; has been fully found, with Online Test 10.1 also being partially found. Due to the aforementioned NDA, very little videos and images can be found of these online tests, although all online tests from 2-11 were streamed live on Twitch and are still available to view today.\nGameplay.\nIn the online tests, the missions were very much like how they are today, although they were slightly different with them later becoming the missions in the final game. The exception being weather the storm as that mode was scrapped.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DB3z1Gkud9Cc\"&gt;Defending the Fort&lt;/a&gt;\" gameplay video released on July 8, 2014 showcased aspects of the Online Testing era.\nUser Interface.\nWhen logging on, the player was greeted with a full overview of the Homebase Lab/Buildings. There were four different main tabs that can be accessed including:\nThe UI took on a greenish color scheme compared to the current blue color scheme used throughout the game. Upon OT11, this was scrapped in favor of the current &lt;a href=\"Homebase\"&gt;Homebase&lt;/a&gt; GUI.\nThe world map also had its own theme that contained stock radio chatter and HAM radio signals. It was removed around OT11. Part of this theme can still be heard in the &lt;a href=\"Forest\"&gt;Forest&lt;/a&gt; biome."}

As noted by Nisha, he fight for nothing but himself. Although originally a riffraff, Oscar acts and speaks in a distinguished manner and enjoys luxury. Because of his pride Oscar is the type of person who wants to be respected, and will not give his interest to anyone if they do not know him. He also seems to believe that force prevails over all else. Following his belief, he accepted his own weakness and that of The Society in his defeat and doesn't hold a grudge against Hope and Jones for this, preferring to move on and focus on the future in order to regain everything he lost and more.\nAppearance.\nOscar is a muscular and humanoid tiger in suit. His regular fur colour is orange with black stripes, but changes to white with black stripes in his Champion style and to dark blue with glowing blue stripes in his Shock Brawler form.\nHistory.\nOscar was originally a riffraff who fought in the streets to get what he wanted. He later went to do underground fights in a unknown underground fight club for the same purpose, before becoming a hunter for The Society. Through The Society Oscar would make a name for himself and gradually gain more wealth and slowly climb up the ranks, before ultimately being offered a place as a boss of The Society. He became the owner of &lt;a href=\"Lavish%20Lair\"&gt;Lavish Lair&lt;/a&gt; now with his own &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Guards\"&gt;Legion Guards&lt;/a&gt; to command. Later, like the other bosses, he held &lt;a href=\"Peely\"&gt;Peely&lt;/a&gt; hostage for a while and blackmailed Jones so they could possibly get more information on &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt; from him. Later &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; defeated him and would steal his medallion away.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Valeria\"&gt;Valeria&lt;/a&gt; opened &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; and the Olympians arrive to the Island to punish the mortals.

It was first introduced during . Following the events of , the evils of the box have been set free elsewhere away from the island.\nIt was the overarching antagonist of the whole of &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Chapter 5&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nPandora's Box is an extremely powerful, evil and cursed box containing ancient powers and entities that &lt;a href=\"Valeria\"&gt;Valeria&lt;/a&gt; and possibly more members of &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;'s family have been searching for for a while. It was originally chained to the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;'s hand buried beneath &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;The Island&lt;/a&gt;, west of &lt;a href=\"Ruined%20Reels\"&gt;Ruined Reels&lt;/a&gt;. The Box is greatly connected to &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; herself, who is meant to be \"the hope at the bottom of Pandora's Box\".\nWhile simply closing the Box was supposed to be enough to end the disasters caused by it, this is no longer the case after all of its power was stolen by &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt;, warping fate itself and leaving &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; with no choice but to defeat &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt; before the power of the box destroys &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;The Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality.\nThe Box has proven to be sentient and endowed of a will of its own. It seems thirsty for destruction and ready to do anything to annihilate the person fated to stop it, using the Pandora Gems to communicate with Hope, in an attempt to trick her to give in by promising everything she ever wanted in order to destroy her. After luring &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt; into finding and opening it to claim its powers, the box then tries to control him by giving him an uncontrollable, chaotic and exhilarating hunger to destroy.\nAppearance.\nIt is a gigantic golden chest with large orb above the keyhole. The fiery orb shows 8 constellations. \nAs of , it has had its power drained completely by &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt;. The box did not resurface after the end of on the Island, except in the opening cinematic for the season.\nFragments of the Box.\nPandora's Gem.\nPandora's gems are a group of 4 gems that come from Pandora's Box, they were first introduced during . They are identical to the main gem of Pandora's Box, except that they are smaller and contain only one constellation. Each gem has its own constellation, with one representing &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt;, the second representing &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;, the third representing a sword, and the fourth representing Midas' crew &lt;a href=\"GHOST\"&gt;GHOST&lt;/a&gt; Faction. The gems were released by Pandora's Box itself, in order for specific people to find them. The Box wanted to use them as clues for &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;someone&lt;/a&gt; to find it and claim its power. However they also had another use, which was to make contact with &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;, its archnemesis so that it could try to destroy her by tricking her.\nArcane Artifacts.\nArcane Artifacts are a group of six relics scattered across the Island, they were first introduced during . These artifacts look like six raw stones of different colors on which symbols has been engraved. Those artifacts are fragments of Pandora's Box itself that &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt; was searching in order to complete his Pandora's Armor. It is likely that just like Pandora's Gem, these artifacts were unleashed on the Island by Pandora's Box intentionally for someone to find. How Doom learned about their existence is, however, unknown, although it's possible that the Box itself told him.\nHistory.\nSeeking power, &lt;a href=\"Valeria\"&gt;Valeria&lt;/a&gt;, a boss of The Society would dig into her grandfather's old books on &lt;a href=\"The%20Pantheon\"&gt;The Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; where she would read about the powers of &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt;, she would share her findings with the other bosses leading them to search for &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt;. Believing Jones had the answers, the Bosses kidnapped Peely. \nHowever the plan failed as Jones didn't have any information on the box and Peely was later rescued. In the meantime, The Society started to collapse following their defeats against &lt;a href=\"The%20Underground\"&gt;The Underground&lt;/a&gt; forces. But Valeria continued her research, setting up camp north of &lt;a href=\"Ruined%20Reels\"&gt;Ruined Reels&lt;/a&gt;. Later, she relocated her camp to south west of Ruined Reels, after locating the Box.\nBy unknown means, Valeria managed to summon Pandora's Box, starting a series of &lt;a href=\"Earthquakes%23Chapter%205\"&gt;earthquakes&lt;/a&gt; followed with the apparition of a &lt;a href=\"The%20Hand\"&gt;giant hand&lt;/a&gt; from the ground, holding the chained box. \nAfter managing to break the chains, Valeria opened The Box, unleashing the evil spirits on The Island.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Pantheon\"&gt;The Gods&lt;/a&gt; arrived, along with their domains: &lt;a href=\"The%20Underworld\"&gt;The Underworld&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Mount Olympus&lt;/a&gt; and closed the Box, which fell into River Styx before punishing &lt;a href=\"The%20Society\"&gt;The Society&lt;/a&gt; for what they did, causing them to fight against the Gods themselves and barely survive.\nAfter Zeus announced his will to destroy absolutely all mortals, a war began between mortals and their allies among the immortals against the forces of Zeus.\nAfter the victory of The Looper against Zeus, who was dethroned, the mad God wanted revenge by overloading Pandora's Box to unleash destruction on The Island.\nTo do so, &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; used his own statue at Mount Olympus to strike Pandora's Box with several lightning attacks. After the final strike, the excess energy from the box was released with a powerful shockwave before colliding violently with the south islands, unleashing a Nitro sandstorm and attracting the &lt;a href=\"Wasteland%20Warriors\"&gt;Wasteland Warriors&lt;/a&gt;. In the meantime, The Box returned to hide underground.\nA group of Marauders calling themselves The Wasteland Warriors led by &lt;a href=\"Megalo%20Don\"&gt;Megalo Don&lt;/a&gt; would arrive on the Island along with the sandstorm, they immediately took control and claimed ownership of the newly formed Wasteland. Megalo Don would order &lt;a href=\"The%20Machinist\"&gt;The Machinist&lt;/a&gt;, the Wasteland Warriors engineer to &lt;a href=\"Redline%20Rig\"&gt;extract Nitro&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful substance from Pandora's Box that empower people and vehicles, from The Wasteland and build a &lt;a href=\"Megalo%20Depot\"&gt;pipeline&lt;/a&gt; so he could use it to fuel his ship with it and raze the Island. &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; discovered that Megalo Don plans to destroy the Island, but won't be able to launch his raid until his &lt;a href=\"Brutal%20Beachhead\"&gt;Leviathan ship&lt;/a&gt; is refueled with enough &lt;a href=\"Nitro\"&gt;Nitro&lt;/a&gt;, to be able to power it. She then call &lt;a href=\"Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; to get &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;'s help to try to stop him. In the meantime, Megalo Don and his crew cause chaos and destruction over the Wasteland.\nAfter The Looper infiltrated &lt;a href=\"Redline%20Rig\"&gt;Redline Rig&lt;/a&gt;, Hope also learns that the Wastelanders have started to find gems from &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt;. Feeling that the Box wants to be found, she decides to recover all the gems to avoid them falling into wrong hands. Meanwhile, the people of the Island keep feeling like they're being watched by a mysterious hooded figure around various locations on the Island. Megalo Don, through his &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Transmission\"&gt;Mysterious Transmissions&lt;/a&gt;, states that the powers of the gems from &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt; attracted him here, feeling worthy of its power he wanted to take it for himself. He also reveal that he and The Wanderer share a common goal and the latter has important matters to resolve. Megalo Don orders that nobody should see his face, claiming it to be beyond their comprehension, or maybe not. It is so mysterious that even Megalo Don himself has not seen their face.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; would find and recover one of these gems at &lt;a href=\"Brutal%20Beachhead\"&gt;Brutal Beachhead&lt;/a&gt; and give it to Hope, which would give her a sudden headache. Later another from &lt;a href=\"Ringmaster%20Scarr\"&gt;Ringmaster Scarr&lt;/a&gt;, who was seemingly not aware that her boss was searching them was recovered; after thinking &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; is cool, was willing to trade her Pandora gem to The Looper for \"a stunt so dangerously, rip-roariously metal that it makes the gods wet their big, golden bloomers.\" Once her gem is given to &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;, she reveal she just got a vision of &lt;a href=\"Megalo%20Don\"&gt;Megalo Don&lt;/a&gt; working with a cloaked Wanderer. Later Jones discovered the third gem was owned by Peabody, once the Looper managed to get it after helping their auto technician in training, Dummy and gave the gem to Hope, she got another headache, stronger this time. With the pipeline starting to make good progress, and the Warriors' plan nearing a successful ending, Hope ordered to find the last gem. After talking to Peabody, The Looper learns Megalo Don kept his valuables in a cache on the Island. After searching the caches in vain, they tried to recover Megalo Don's map of his hidden cache, once done The Looper recovered the Gem and gave it to Hope which causes &lt;a href=\"The%20Oracle\"&gt;The Oracle&lt;/a&gt;, who prophesied The Wanderer, to return and assist &lt;a href=\"The%20Underground\"&gt;The Underground&lt;/a&gt; in what comes next. In the meantime, The Wanderer assures Megalo Don of his plan with The Leviathan ship, so Megalo Don spends his time hunting for &lt;a href=\"Vengeance%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; to get his Pandora gems back. \nWhile failing to recover his gems, Megalo Don activated his pipeline to fuel The Leviathan to finally raze the Island, only for the pipelines to be hacked by &lt;a href=\"The%20Wanderer\"&gt;The Wanderer&lt;/a&gt;, which causes it to explode in a chain reaction, which also causes the rise of &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt;, under Redline Rig after the exploding Nitro striked the location where Pandora's Box was. In the meantime, &lt;a href=\"The%20Oracle\"&gt;The Oracle&lt;/a&gt; reveals to &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; her true link with The Box, revealing how the Box tried to trick her to destroy her and saying that she was the hope at the bottom of it. She adds that the Wanderer warped her fate and that now she must defeat him, because closing the Box won't be enough anymore.\nThe Wanderer reveals himself as &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Doom\"&gt;Doctor Doom&lt;/a&gt; opens the box and absorb all of its contents dry. Leaving behind an empty box behind. With his new powers, Doom went on a killing spree, eliminating several heroes and villains from Reality: 616 before setting out to build a new armor, which would be able to withstand the powers of Pandora's Box, noting that it made him feel a vacant hunger that is chaotic, wild and uncontrolled. To create his new armor, Doom decided to use pieces of the Box itself, known as the Arcane Artifacts.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Absolute%20Doom%20Event\"&gt;Absolute Doom Event&lt;/a&gt;, Doctor Doom uses the power of the box to make himself an invincible titan. His plan turned into a mess when Hope used Captain America's Shield to absorb Pandora's Box power and smack Doom's eye with it, rendering him vulnerable to all attacks. Doctor Doom tried to use Pandora's Box power to escape the rift from the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Beacon\"&gt;Rift Beacon&lt;/a&gt; but was all it too late. Doom got rifted home along with the Pandora's Box powers.\nExternal Links.\n=Ingame=\nPandora's Box is an object in that was first introduced during . It takes the form of a giant, indestructible chest that players can't interact with apart from during &lt;a href=\"Emergence%20Event\"&gt;Emergence Event&lt;/a&gt;.\nPandora's Box was present in every season of &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Chapter 5&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-Game Interaction.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"The%20Hand\"&gt;The Hand&lt;/a&gt; rose from the cracks, players gained the ability to damage the chains holding Pandora's box. Damage that was done was saved universally. It had around 5 billion health, which means it took around 156,250,000 bullets to break. However, Epic did add damage modifiers to accelerate the process.\nPandora's Box is surrounded by hot &lt;a href=\"Nitro\"&gt;Nitro&lt;/a&gt;. Trying to land on the Nitro or the chest will knock the player back, deal 25 damage to them and infuse them with Nitro.\nAudio.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

It was introduced in and allows players to move faster, and undetected through sandy surfaces. \nFunctionality.\nSand Tunneling is activated by the player standing still for around three seconds on top of an unobstructed sandy area. The sand that allows sand tunneling is only found around the &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point%20%28Landmark%29\"&gt;Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, and encompasses locations such as &lt;a href=\"Salty%20Towers\"&gt;Salty Towers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Colossal%20Coliseum\"&gt;Colossal Coliseum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Butter%20Barn\"&gt;Butter Barn&lt;/a&gt;. Once the player is still, they will begin to slowly sink into the ground. This sinking is interrupted by movement, consuming an item, shooting or reloading.\nThe player then sinks into the ground and is now sand tunneling. The player also takes the form of a semi-sphere shaped mound on the ground, which when moved created a large sand cloud, alerting others to the location of the mound. When in this state, the player moves faster, but must move for a certain period of time in order to get enough momentum to reach maximum speed. Sand Tunneling is cancelled by moving away from a sandy area, moving into water, moving onto an elevated prop or by pressing the primary fire button. The player is able to change the selected item in their inventory in this state, but still has to complete a short 'jumping out' animation in order to attack again.\nOpponents are able to hurt a player sand tunneling by shooting anywhere on the mound. This will deal standard amounts of damage, and cannot critical hit."}

It was introduced in .\nFunctionality.\nSaucers are flying &lt;a href=\"Vehicles%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;Vehicles&lt;/a&gt; which can attack opponents and abduct players and props from the map. Saucers behave similar to &lt;a href=\"Choppa%20%28Vehicle%29\"&gt;Choppas&lt;/a&gt;, with a Boost function (which stacks up to 3 boosts) the ability to descend and ascend, as well as turning off when its pilot exits. Saucers can boost three times, and will recharge its boosts consecutively. The Saucer has five spots for players to ride on: the cockpit, and four spots on the exterior which others stand on. The saucer deploys an energy shield with 100 Health around the cockpit, which regenerates after a few seconds once destroyed.\nUpon using the primary fire, the Saucer will charge then shoot an energy ball, dealing 30 damage to opponents, 90 damage to vehicles, and 450 damage to structures and alien parasites, within a medium splash radius. Players and vehicles hit by the energy ball will be pushed away, and opponents may take fall damage as it does not give a low-gravity effect.\nWith the alternate fire, the Saucer will try to lock onto and abduct things under it, such as players, &lt;a href=\"AIs\"&gt;AIs&lt;/a&gt;, Vehicles (except other Saucers) and &lt;a href=\"Props\"&gt;Props&lt;/a&gt;. They can then use these (aside from players) to drop onto opponents to deal large amounts of damage. Once abducted, the Props become physical objects, and will collide with the environment. Only Props such as rocks, Slurp Trucks, furniture and other small objects can be grabbed \u2013 things like walls and roofs of structures cannot. Players abducted by a Saucer receive fall damage negation, until they are dropped and land on the ground. The Saucer will automatically drop players it is abducting after 30 seconds.\nOnce it loses all of its Health, the Saucer will quickly descend to the floor. It will not immediately be destroyed, but instead losing a \"life\", of which it has three. When it lands on the floor with remaining \"lives\", all players will be ejected, and the Saucer will start \"rebooting\", regaining Health until is restored fully, whereupon it will be once again available to enter. If it is on its last life, the Saucer will fall towards the ground and explode after a few seconds or upon landing, unless it is already on the ground, then it will explode immediately.\nThe Saucer has a battery, which lasts 400 seconds and recharges automatically (at no cost) while landed. Upon depleting the battery midair, it will fall harmlessly to the ground. The Saucer also has a honk.\nAlthough the Saucer has 600 Health, it does not get destroyed when its Health is depleted. Instead it falls to the ground in which it will repair itself back to full Health. It will only be destroyed once it loses its 3 \"lives\". \nStats.\nNote: Whilst the Saucer itself is , the weapon it uses to attack opponents is .\nObtained.\nSaucers spawn at 6 set locations across the map. They will only spawn here, so a maximum of 6 saucers can be in a game at one time."}

When &lt;a href=\"Director%20Riggs\"&gt;Riggs&lt;/a&gt; tries to explain his role, &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Knox\"&gt;Knox&lt;/a&gt; dismisses him as unimportant and walks away. &lt;a href=\"Dennis\"&gt;Dennis&lt;/a&gt;, overhearing the conversation, grows suspicious of &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Knox\"&gt;Knox&lt;/a&gt; due to his missing personnel files and begins to suspect he could be dangerous. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Knox\"&gt;Knox&lt;/a&gt; starts pestering &lt;a href=\"Dennis\"&gt;Dennis&lt;/a&gt; for answers, frustrated by the lack of clear leadership, and eventually gets sent to &lt;a href=\"Lars\"&gt;Lars&lt;/a&gt;' flying van as part of a chore wheel task.\n&lt;a href=\"Dennis\"&gt;Dennis&lt;/a&gt; later discovers a personnel file identifying &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Knox\"&gt;Knox&lt;/a&gt; as dangerous, with traits like narcissism and a fixation on authority.

THERAPY-Bot volunteers to proctor the test, which involves retrieving an answer booklet from the husks. When the results come in, however, THERAPY-Bot announces that Knox has failed. This leads &lt;a href=\"Director%20Riggs\"&gt;Riggs&lt;/a&gt; to express disappointment, only for THERAPY-Bot to claim that &lt;a href=\"Director%20Riggs\"&gt;Riggs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dennis\"&gt;Dennis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lars\"&gt;Lars&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Cloaked%20Star\"&gt;Cloaked Star&lt;/a&gt; have also failed their psychological profiles.

It started on May 1st, 2018 and ended on July 11th, 2018. The season's theme revolved around superheroes.\nThis season introduced cinematic trailers and &lt;a href=\"Lore%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;lore&lt;/a&gt; into .\nStoryline.\nSummary of Last Season.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Season%203\"&gt;Season 3&lt;/a&gt;, a meteor appeared in the sky of the &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; island. As the meteor approached the island, the inhabitants of the island began placing telescopes, camps, and signs around the island, all looking towards the meteor. During the final days of the season, small meteor fragments would crash into the island during matches.\nThe Season Begins.\nAs the season began, the meteor from last season, as well as many meteor fragments, had finally crashed onto the island and damaging several areas on the island. The largest fragment crashed into the &lt;a href=\"Factory\"&gt;Factory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dusty%20Depot\"&gt;Dusty Depot&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in &lt;a href=\"Dusty%20Divot\"&gt;Dusty Divot&lt;/a&gt;. The smaller fragments landed around the island, hitting &lt;a href=\"Tilted%20Towers\"&gt;Tilted Towers&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Prison\"&gt;Prison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Risky%20Reels\"&gt;Risky Reels&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Motel\"&gt;Motel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe entirety of the Factory and half of Dusty Depot was destroyed from the largest meteor fragment. The fragment that landed at Tilted Towers destroyed most of the center building and the fragment that crashed into the Prison destroyed most of the prisons center. The fragment that landed at Risky Reels destroyed half of the cinema screen and landed amongst the densely packed cars and the final, tiny fragment, landed at the Motel, flipping over a bus and crashing into the motel roof.\nSeason 4.\nThe meteor left behind &lt;a href=\"Hop%20Rocks\"&gt;Hop Rocks&lt;/a&gt; in the crater of &lt;a href=\"Dusty%20Divot\"&gt;Dusty Divot&lt;/a&gt;, these rocks grant &lt;a href=\"Loopers\"&gt;Loopers&lt;/a&gt; who consume them a low-gravity effect for a short duration. After the impact, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Government\"&gt;The Government&lt;/a&gt; (also known as the the Unnamed Investigation Agency, or U.I.A) built a research facility at Dusty Divot to research and investigate a mysterious glowing rock which was left by the meteor.\nWhile this was happening, a movie titled \"It came from Moisty Mire\" was being filmed near &lt;a href=\"Moisty%20Mire\"&gt;Moisty Mire&lt;/a&gt; when a meteor fragment crashed into the &lt;a href=\"Prison\"&gt;Prison&lt;/a&gt;. It was revealed that the supervillain &lt;a href=\"Omega\"&gt;Omega&lt;/a&gt; was freed from the Prison because of the meteor fragment, Omega began to assemble an army of augmented soldiers in his &lt;a href=\"Villain%20Lair\"&gt;Villain Lair&lt;/a&gt;. In response, the superheroes, led by &lt;a href=\"Carbide%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Carbide&lt;/a&gt;, began to formulate a plan at the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20Mansion\"&gt;Hero Mansion&lt;/a&gt;. However, all of this was later revealed to be part of the movie in the &lt;a href=\"That%27s%20a%20Wrap%21\"&gt;That's a Wrap!&lt;/a&gt; loading screen.\nAs time went on, The Government began filling in smaller craters and construction crews started rebuilding destroyed parts of &lt;a href=\"Risky%20Reels\"&gt;Risky Reels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tilted%20Towers\"&gt;Tilted Towers&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, the glowing rock in Dusty Divot began to crack and open, revealing a mysterious pod containing &lt;a href=\"The%20Visitor\"&gt;The Visitor&lt;/a&gt;, later revealed to be a member of &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt;. The Visitor broke out of the pod and trashed the research facility, and after escaping to the Villain Lair, transformed the fake rocket from the superhero movie into a real rocket by using Hop Rocks stolen from The Government.\nAfter all of this, a hologram appeared in the Villain Lair which projected a three-day countdown for the &lt;a href=\"Blast%20Off\"&gt;Blast Off&lt;/a&gt; event on June 27th, 2018, followed by the countdown being broadcast on all televisions on the island and then a siren began blaring at the Villain Lair which could be heard from everywhere on the island.\nEvent and Aftermath.\nOnce the countdown ended, the rocket (piloted by &lt;a href=\"The%20Visitor\"&gt;The Visitor&lt;/a&gt;) took off from the &lt;a href=\"Villain%20Lair\"&gt;Villain Lair&lt;/a&gt;, leaving behind a thick trail of smoke as it ascended into the sky. It momentarily stopped mid-air to break off the rocket booster, before accelerating once more. Upon reaching a high altitude, the rocket shut off it's engines and stalled mid-air, before plummeting back down towards the island. As the rocket fell, The Visitor spoke, saying \"Zero Point Oscillator on, setting coordinates. Engaging quantum field accelerator\". The rocket then activated a laser that pointed to the center of &lt;a href=\"Tilted%20Towers\"&gt;Tilted Towers&lt;/a&gt;, and boosted towards the location. However, before the rocket hit, The Visitor activated a device which created a tear through space-time called a &lt;a href=\"Rift\"&gt;rift&lt;/a&gt;. The rocket entered the Rift and exited from one over &lt;a href=\"Moisty%20Mire\"&gt;Moisty Mire&lt;/a&gt;, flying across the island before entering another Rift near &lt;a href=\"Snobby%20Shores\"&gt;Snobby Shores&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, the rocket exited from a Rift at &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt; and accelerated into the sky, creating a giant Rift in the sky, known as a &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;crack in the sky&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the previous rifts created by the rocket closed, the crack in the sky did not, appearing to be permanent. As time went on, the crack in the sky began to crack more and more, causing space-time around the island to destabilize. As the season was coming to a close, small rifts began appearing around the island, rifting away objects such as the &lt;a href=\"Tomato%20Town\"&gt;Tomato Town&lt;/a&gt; mascot, the &lt;a href=\"Motel\"&gt;Motel&lt;/a&gt; sign, and the Durr Burder head. As objects were rifted away, objects were also rifted onto the island from other realities such as a Viking ship anchor, dinosaur bones, and an ancient wagon.\nRewards System.\nChallenge Cosmetics.\nChallenge cosmetics are rewarded to players for completing a specific challenge or achievement, this includes &lt;a href=\"Umbrella\"&gt;Victory Umbrellas&lt;/a&gt; which are rewarded to players for getting a victory royale in any main gamemode while the season is active. This season introduced skin style challenges.\nCarbide Challenges.\nThe Carbide Challenges were a set of &lt;a href=\"Challenges\"&gt;challenges&lt;/a&gt; that were available for all players who owned the premium &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pass\"&gt;Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt;, and would reward the player with the &lt;a href=\"Positron\"&gt;Positron&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pickaxes\"&gt;harvesting tool&lt;/a&gt; and extra styles for the &lt;a href=\"Carbide%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Carbide&lt;/a&gt; skin upon completing the respective challenges.\nOmega Challenges.\nThe Omega Challenges were a set of &lt;a href=\"Challenges\"&gt;challenges&lt;/a&gt; that were available for all players who owned the premium &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pass\"&gt;Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt;, and would reward the player with the &lt;a href=\"Onslaught\"&gt;Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pickaxes\"&gt;harvesting tool&lt;/a&gt; and extra styles for the &lt;a href=\"Omega\"&gt;Omega&lt;/a&gt; skin upon completing the respective challenges.\nBlockbuster.\nThe Blockbuster Challenges were a set of &lt;a href=\"Challenges\"&gt;challenges&lt;/a&gt; that were available for all players who owned the premium &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pass\"&gt;Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt;, and would reward the player with &lt;a href=\"The%20Visitor\"&gt;The Visitor&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href=\"Offworld%20Rig\"&gt;Offworld Rig&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Back%20Bling\"&gt;back bling&lt;/a&gt;, and several leading screens upon completing the respective challenges.\nBattle Pass.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pass\"&gt;Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt; was progressed through by using &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Stars\"&gt;Battle Stars&lt;/a&gt; which were earned from &lt;a href=\"challenges\"&gt;challenges&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pass\"&gt;Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt; contained 100 tiers of rewards. The free &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pass\"&gt;Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt; tiers were worth 200 &lt;a href=\"V-Bucks\"&gt;V-Bucks&lt;/a&gt; while the premium &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pass\"&gt;Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt;, for a cost of 950 &lt;a href=\"V-Bucks\"&gt;V-Bucks&lt;/a&gt;, had a worth of 1,300 &lt;a href=\"V-Bucks\"&gt;V-Bucks&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeason 4's &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pass\"&gt;Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt; introduced a new cosmetic type: &lt;a href=\"Sprays\"&gt;Sprays&lt;/a&gt;."}

The dirt racetrack to the east of Retail Row was revamped and upgraded to a full-scale concrete motorcourse track. Two more major changes occurred to the island. The farm &lt;a href=\"Anarchy%20Acres\"&gt;Anarchy Acres&lt;/a&gt; was replaced with a luxury golf club called &lt;a href=\"Lazy%20Links\"&gt;Lazy Links&lt;/a&gt;, and a large &lt;a href=\"Viking%20Village\"&gt;Viking Village&lt;/a&gt; was dropped on top of a mountain near Snobby Shores, complete with a large viking ship. Dusty Divot became overgrown with vegetation, and the research facility there started to fall apart and decay, same with the Hero Mansion and Villain Lair. The Durr Burger head that was transported into the real world was, again, sucked through a rift and transported back to the island, and could have been found on top of a hill near Pleasant Park. Around each of the affected areas, rifts could have been found, which transported loopers high up into the sky when entered.\nThe Season 5 Storyline.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;Crack in the Sky&lt;/a&gt; brought the locations from different realities into the &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt;, it started shrinking and closing, and in the process, becoming purple and sending lightning strikes in a mountain east of &lt;a href=\"Fatal%20Fields\"&gt;Fatal Fields&lt;/a&gt; in the Desert. When the &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;Crack in the Sky&lt;/a&gt; was nearly done closing it sent it's last lightning strike, which was the longest, bringing in a &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube\"&gt;Cube&lt;/a&gt;, then finally closing.\nThis &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube\"&gt;Cube&lt;/a&gt; started rolling around the &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt;, burning runes into the soil of the &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt; with the purpose of gathering power, then sinking into the &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; was, so it could start the next phase of it's plan in &lt;a href=\"Season%206\"&gt;Season 6&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the same time, a group of &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;s likely working for the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;IO&lt;/a&gt;, started retrieving objects previously rifted away back to the &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt;, and closing those rifts.\nBattle Pass.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pass\"&gt;Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt; cost 950 &lt;a href=\"V-Bucks\"&gt;V-Bucks&lt;/a&gt;, the same as the previous 3 seasons.

{"id": "6571", "revid": "54771765", "url": "https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6571", "title": "Season 6", "text": "Season 6, with the slogan Darkness Rises was the sixth season of \".\" It started on September 27th 2018 and ended on December 5th 2018. It was also the first season to introduce &lt;a href=\"Pets\"&gt;Pets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Music\"&gt;Music&lt;/a&gt; to the game. The theme of the season revolved around darkness rising across the &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt; following the events of &lt;a href=\"Cubes\"&gt;The Cube&lt;/a&gt; rising from &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Floating%20Island\"&gt;floating island&lt;/a&gt;.\nHow did it Start?\nSeason 6 continues the storyline that was started in &lt;a href=\"Season%203\"&gt;Season 3&lt;/a&gt;.\nThroughout the second half of &lt;a href=\"Season%205\"&gt;Season 5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube\"&gt;The Cube&lt;/a&gt; rolled around the island, printing seven glyphs before rolling into Loot Lake, sinking underneath the Lake and deactivating underneath the central island. The entire surface of the lake was turned purple in the process\nAt the start of Season 6, The Cube activated. It absorbed all of its energy dispersed along the surface of the lake and tore the central island from the ground and lifted it up into the air, with The Cube attached to the bottom of the floating island. The entire island was kept suspended in the air by an air vortex powered by The Cube itself.\n&lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt; was renamed to &lt;a href=\"Leaky%20Lake\"&gt;Leaky Lake&lt;/a&gt; on account of the mess that The Cube left behind. The central chunk of the lake was completely missing, and in the very center of the ruined lake was a large whirlpool with a bright light coming from underneath it. This likely lead to &lt;a href=\"The%20Vault\"&gt;The Vault&lt;/a&gt;, and the location of the whirlpool corresponded to the exact location from where the cube emerged from at the start of the season, likely meaning that The Cube actually entered the vault, but returned back to the island for an unknown reason.\nThe glyphs located around the island became corruption zones. It seems like The Cube printed the glyphs to act as energy converters, using up the soil and natural resources in the vicinity of the glyph to convert into energy usable by The Cube. In the process, the glyphs corrupted the areas surrounding them, with dead trees and barren soil, along with &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Stone\"&gt;Shadow Stones&lt;/a&gt; and purple vents littering the corruption zones.\nOnly one rift remained at the start of Season 6, maintained and controlled in a laboratory within an underground bunker in &lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Woods\"&gt;Wailing Woods&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Season 6 Storyline.\nLess than a day after Season 6 started, The Cube began moving with &lt;a href=\"Floating%20Island\"&gt;The Floating Island&lt;/a&gt; to the closest corruption zone, near Pleasant Park. Within three days, The Cube reached the corruption zone and ripped out a chunk of land with the glyph imprinted on it, lifting it up into the air and sucking out energy from the corruption zone underneath the glyph causing solid cube material to grow through the floating island. The process took some time, but once all the energy was sucked out from the corruption zone, The Cube dropped the glyph and moved on, heading towards the next corruption zone. Throughout nearly a month, The Cube visited all six corruption zones on the map and grew through the house on the Floating Island. The final corruption zone that The Cube visited was the central zone, and during the process, all other six glyphs around the island lifted from their corruption zones and began moving towards the Floating Island, each one suspended in the air by a vortex. At this point, The Cube material had grown through the entire floating island and the house. When the glyphs reached the Floating Island, The Cube began absorbing their energy simultaneously. When The Cube was done, the glyphs \"deactivated\" and crashed down onto the ground. Their purple colours turned to a darker brown colour, signifying that The Cube had stripped them completely of their energy.\nAt this point, The Cube was completely filled with energy and pulsed rapidly. It returned to Leaky Lake, where it started to draw power from the vortex there and projected a beam of purple energy upwards, opening a purple portal in the sky, which was likely a portal to &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, the portal in the sky grew, and covered the island in a purple fog.\nOn October 24th 2018, Fortnitemares began. The Cube released a sudden burst of energy that ripped the floating island into several large chunks. The Cube material that grew through the island was shredded into fragments and scattered around the island by a shockwave. These fragments spawned &lt;a href=\"Cube%20Monsters\"&gt;Cube Monsters&lt;/a&gt;, which attacked &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;loopers&lt;/a&gt;. A thick fog also materialised and shrouded the entire map in darkness. This event was likely the first stage of invasion by The Cube, the first step into dominating and slowly destroying the &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt; beyond saving, preparing for a full-scale &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;Last Reality&lt;/a&gt; invasion, which would then destroy &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;this reality&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%27s%20Cradle\"&gt;The Cube's Cradle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cube however, became overwhelmed with the amount of power it had and it's body started breaking and slowly decaying as the days passed, and the remains of The Cube's outer shell melted and dropped into Loot Lake, culminating in &lt;a href=\"The%20Butterfly%20Event\"&gt;The Butterfly Event&lt;/a&gt; on November 4, where The Cube's outer shell completely melted away and it began spinning wildly, tearing itself apart in a giant explosion. All Loopers on the island were somehow sent to &lt;a href=\"The%20In-Between\"&gt;The In-Between&lt;/a&gt;. What happened next is unclear, but a large rift formed that took the appearance of a butterfly. It fluttered around each looper, before landing on the looper's finger in a cinematic event, transporting each player back to the Island.\nAfter the Cube exploded, the pieces of The &lt;a href=\"Floating%20Island\"&gt;Floating Island&lt;/a&gt; fell into the lake, and the ruined lake was changed to a peaceful paradise, with colourful grass, flowers and waterfalls. In the center of the lake stood the remains of The Cube, arranged in a Stonehenge formation, while the chunks of the Floating Island were partially buried and covered in grass around the central area of the lake. The vortex, fog, and cube fragments scattered around the island were wiped away as if they never existed, and thus, Fortnitemares ended as Season 6 drew to a close.\nHow did it End?\nWithout the glyphs powering them, the corruption zones around the island began to fade, as the grass slowly regrew on the corrupted soil. The glyphs dropped near the central corruption zone and became overgrown with grass as nature slowly spread over the corruption created by The Cube.\nSometime after the Butterfly Event, a giant iceberg appeared in the far south-west, shrouded in a snowstorm and on a direct collision course with the island. A few weeks before the end of Season 6, a robot codenamed &lt;a href=\"A.I.M.\"&gt;A.I.M.&lt;/a&gt; arrived on the island and planted a flag representing the &lt;a href=\"Expedition\"&gt;Expedition&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Flush%20Factory\"&gt;Flush Factory&lt;/a&gt;. The robot then began scouting the island and observing its inhabitants, preparing for the incoming invasion...\nMap Changes.\n&lt;a href=\"Update%20v6.00\"&gt;Update v6.00&lt;/a&gt; (September 27, 2018).\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Cube\"&gt;The Cube&lt;/a&gt; has risen from the waters from &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt; and the Runes it created had now started to corrupt the &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt;\nBattle Pass.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pass\"&gt;Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt; costs 950 &lt;a href=\"V-Bucks\"&gt;V-Bucks&lt;/a&gt;, the same as the previous seasons. This Battle Pass first introduced pets and music in the game.\nUnlockable Styles.\nLike the previous 2 seasons, the outfits that come with Tier 1 and 100 of the Battle Pass have unlockable styles. Each new style comes with a challenge to unlock it. If you \"level up\" Calamity fully, you will earn a pickaxe that accompanies the outfit. When you \"level up\" Dire fully, you will earn a backbling to go along with the outfit.\n&lt;a href=\"Calamity\"&gt;Calamity&lt;/a&gt; came with the &lt;a href=\"Calamity%20Challenges\"&gt;Calamity Challenges&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dire\"&gt;Dire&lt;/a&gt; came with the &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Challenges\"&gt;Dire Challenges&lt;/a&gt;. Like Season 5, you can complete them even after the season ends."}

The &lt;a href=\"Core%20Gamemodes\"&gt;game mode&lt;/a&gt; would become available for everyone 1 week after the start of the season (December 13 2018). \nThe Start of Something New.\nSeason 7 started a new storyline, separate from the storyline that had been happening since &lt;a href=\"Season%203\"&gt;Season 3&lt;/a&gt;. The corruption zones had completely faded away by the time the Iceberg spotted in late &lt;a href=\"Season%206\"&gt;Season 6&lt;/a&gt; collided with the southwest side of the island, freezing &lt;a href=\"Greasy%20Grove\"&gt;Greasy Grove&lt;/a&gt; and completely destroying &lt;a href=\"Flush%20Factory\"&gt;Flush Factory&lt;/a&gt;. Three new locations were brought in with the Iceberg, &lt;a href=\"Happy%20Hamlet\"&gt;Happy Hamlet&lt;/a&gt;, a small town for the inhabitants of the Iceberg, &lt;a href=\"Polar%20Peak\"&gt;Polar Peak&lt;/a&gt;, a large ice mountain containing a castle buried in snow, and &lt;a href=\"Frosty%20Flights\"&gt;Frosty Flights&lt;/a&gt;, the headquarters of &lt;a href=\"Expedition\"&gt;Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, a military faction commanded by &lt;a href=\"Sgt.%20Winter\"&gt;Sgt. Winter&lt;/a&gt;. Following the Iceberg's collision with the island, &lt;a href=\"Expedition\"&gt;Expedition&lt;/a&gt; invaded the island using &lt;a href=\"Slushy%20Soldier\"&gt;Slushy Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"X-4%20Stormwing\"&gt;X-4 Stormwing&lt;/a&gt; planes to deliver &lt;a href=\"Presents\"&gt;Presents&lt;/a&gt; to the Loopers, setting up numerous &lt;a href=\"Expedition%20Outposts\"&gt;Expedition Outposts&lt;/a&gt; throughout the island.\nThe Season 7 Storyline.\nWithin the next few days following the launch of Season 7, Polar Peak began to thaw out, revealing a giant castle owned by The Ice King and several surrounding buildings.\nUpon realizing that the Ice in which The Ice King was frozen in was thawing, the Ice King conjured an Ice Storm on the &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt; to keep it cold enough to stop it from further thawing \"(See &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Storm\"&gt;Ice Storm&lt;/a&gt;)\". However, several days later the snow and the ice in the &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt; starts melting, and with it the Iceberg continues to melt as well, and as the ice continued to melt even further, a throne room, library, and a dungeon were revealed, and in one of the rooms, there was a table with 5 symbols, each representing a King, the chair behind the fire symbol was flipped. The dungeon contained cells, one of which contained five mysterious eggs. A further room was also revealed, housing a large mound of ice surrounded with chains.\nAs the days passed, the ice with chains in the &lt;a href=\"Polar%20Peak\"&gt;Polar Peak&lt;/a&gt; dungeon started melting, revealing a pair of arms tied to those chains. Eventually, the ice thawed and a being known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Prisoner\"&gt;The Prisoner&lt;/a&gt; had escaped, with the purpose of regaining his power.\nAs &lt;a href=\"The%20Prisoner\"&gt;The Prisoner&lt;/a&gt; regained his power, the deadlocks around his body started falling and fire appeared around his body, causing seismic activities to start happening in the &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nHow did it End?\nThe Prisoner's activities was affecting the &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt;, causing dozens of fissures to open up around the island. The largest one of the fissures (which also happened to be the last one) occurred inside Tilted Towers, destroying the news station that was just constructed. In the final days of Season 7, &lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Woods\"&gt;Wailing Woods&lt;/a&gt; became dried up and a washed up brown color, as ashes and smoke started to rise up from the ground.\nBattle Pass.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pass\"&gt;Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt; costs , like the previous seasons.

Season 8 was the first season that could have been purchased for free if you completed all the challenges during the &lt;a href=\"Share%20The%20Love\"&gt;Share The Love&lt;/a&gt; Event.\nThe theme revolved around pirates and adventure.\nHow did it Start?\nSeason 8 continues the Ice King storyline that began in Season 7, with &lt;a href=\"The%20Prisoner\"&gt;The Prisoner&lt;/a&gt; creating a Volcano and a Jungle biome, destroying &lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Woods\"&gt;Wailing Woods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lazy%20Links\"&gt;Lazy Links&lt;/a&gt; in the process was completely destroyed, while &lt;a href=\"Tomato%20Temple\"&gt;Tomato Temple&lt;/a&gt; became an unnamed POI. &lt;a href=\"Lazy%20Links\"&gt;Lazy Links&lt;/a&gt; was replaced with &lt;a href=\"Lazy%20Lagoon\"&gt;Lazy Lagoon&lt;/a&gt;, a small lagoon containing a pirate ship with a small port. These pirates were seemingly brought to the &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt; by the events that occurred on the island during the previous seasons, and set out to explore it for adventure and possible treasure. Following their arrival on the map, the pirates set up numerous &lt;a href=\"Pirate%20Camps\"&gt;Pirate Camps&lt;/a&gt; throughout the island, as The Prisoner hatched the eggs he collected from &lt;a href=\"Polar%20Peak\"&gt;Polar Peak&lt;/a&gt;, giving birth to &lt;a href=\"Hybrid%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;The Hybrids&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Season 8 Storyline.\nSometime after the Season had started, an Helicopter started going around the &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt; as if it was looking for something and, at the same time, The &lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20Investigation%20Agency\"&gt;Unnamed Investigation Agency&lt;/a&gt; returned and set up a small dig-sites near &lt;a href=\"Fatal%20Fields\"&gt;Fatal Fields&lt;/a&gt;, inside &lt;a href=\"Dusty%20Divot\"&gt;Dusty Divot&lt;/a&gt; and near &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt;, where they found some sort of metal door. The Helicopter then, landed inside &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt; and 10 excavators were deployed over to dig in &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt; and they seemingly found what they were looking for. What the excavators unearthed was &lt;a href=\"The%20Vault\"&gt;The Vault&lt;/a&gt;, a large and mysterious metal hatch surrounded by five big locks with metal slots.\nSeveral days later, a holographic image of a glyph appeared above one of the vault locks (visibly different in appearance to &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube\"&gt;The Cube&lt;/a&gt; glyphs). Around the same time, a large metallic floating 'key' appeared northeast of &lt;a href=\"Lucky%20Landing\"&gt;Lucky Landing&lt;/a&gt;, with the exact same glyph above it as the one at The Vault. It was during this time period, that &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;loopers&lt;/a&gt; realized that the key must be inserted into The Vault slot actively projecting the glyph, and the glyphs themselves depicted what must be done to insert the key. In this instance, loopers must hit it with their pickaxes in order to move the vault. It took some time and effort, but the key eventually reached The Vault and slid into its hatch, activating the lock. \nThis activity also seemed to somehow affect The Volcano, which started to emit smoke. The other four keys each had various and separate tasks that loopers had to complete in order to insert them into the lake. Eventually, though, the loopers accomplished the mission and all the locks were activated. However, each activation of a lock worsened the condition of the volcano, and by the time all the keys were inserted, lava was violently spewing out of the volcano with the ground vigorously shaking in its vicinity.\nA 24-hour countdown for &lt;a href=\"The%20Unvaulting%20Event\"&gt;The Unvaulting Event&lt;/a&gt; appeared on May 3rd 2019.\nHow did it End?\nOnce the countdown for The Unvaulting Event reached zero, the locks deactivated and slid off the hatch, causing it to open up, revealing it to be a gateway to &lt;a href=\"The%20In-Between\"&gt;The In-Between&lt;/a&gt;, the dimension of &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, a mysterious nexus sphere from which all reality seemingly sprang, used to maintain &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt; that the island's inhabitants find themselves in. Upon the hatch fully opening, loopers jumped down into it, floating down into the In-Between. However, unlike in &lt;a href=\"The%20Butterfly%20Event\"&gt;The Butterfly Event&lt;/a&gt;, there was a mysterious platform made from an unknown material stretching infinitely in all directions. Surrounding the Loopers, six pillars slid up holding the following six items: &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Drum%20Gun\"&gt;Drum Gun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tactical%20Submachine%20Gun\"&gt;Tactical Submachine Gun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bouncer\"&gt;Bouncer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"X-4%20Stormwing\"&gt;X-4 Stormwing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Infinity%20Blade\"&gt;Infinity Blade&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Grappler\"&gt;Grappler&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; was also located nearby in a stable and contained state, and a wooden desk was beside it, with a mysterious helmet resting on top of it. Loopers had to vote for the item that will be unvaulted by pickaxing its respective pillar. In the end, the winner was the &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Drum%20Gun\"&gt;Drum Gun&lt;/a&gt;. As the other pillars slid back down into the mysterious platform, the Drum Gun broke out of the pillar and was launched upwards out of &lt;a href=\"The%20Vault\"&gt;The Vault&lt;/a&gt;. The Zero Point then started to glow and shine, as all players levitated upwards and flew back out of the vault.\nAll of this activity caused The Volcano to erupt. A giant column of volcanic ash rose up from it, blocking the sunlight, and covering the entire map in darkness. The Volcano launched seven volcanic rocks, one hitting &lt;a href=\"Retail%20Row\"&gt;Retail Row&lt;/a&gt;, one hitting the &lt;a href=\"Polar%20Peak\"&gt;Polar Peak&lt;/a&gt;, and five hitting &lt;a href=\"Tilted%20Towers\"&gt;Tilted Towers&lt;/a&gt; respectively.\nThe volcano cooled down following the eruption, while smoke and ash remained, obscuring parts of the sun. The Volcano caused immense damage to Tilted Towers, making it completely unrecognizable. The only building that wasn't razed to the ground was the brand new No-Sweat Insurance office. Destruction also occurred to Retail Row, where the shopping district was mostly destroyed. Polar Peak escaped annihilation, although a giant crack in the side of the cliff was formed due to the impact.\nBattle Pass.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pass\"&gt;Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt; costs 950 &lt;a href=\"V-Bucks\"&gt;V-Bucks&lt;/a&gt;, like the previous seasons. However, if you completed 13 of the Season 7 Overtime challenges, you get it free of charge. This Battle Pass first introduced traversal emotes into the game.\nTeasers.\nAfter being asked to describe Season 8 in one word, Mark Rein chose the word \"Bananas.\" This hinted towards the addition of the prominent &lt;a href=\"Peely\"&gt;Peely&lt;/a&gt; outfit and possibly the addition of Bananas as &lt;a href=\"Foraged%20Items\"&gt;Foraged Items&lt;/a&gt;. \nBelow are teaser images that were posted in-game and/or on official Fortnite social media pages."}

The &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; took over the remains of the Volcano, building a Thermonuclear Power Plant known as &lt;a href=\"Pressure%20Plant\"&gt;Pressure Plant&lt;/a&gt; inside it.\nThe Season 9 Storyline.\nThe impact of the Volcano's volcanic rock to the &lt;a href=\"Polar%20Peak\"&gt;Polar Peak&lt;/a&gt; seemed minor at first, but as time passed the damage became ever increasing to the integrity of the mountain, and awakened something big inside of it. Over the course of the next few weeks, the ice at Polar Peak began cracking apart and melting even further, eventually revealing a giant eye belonging to a monster known as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer\"&gt;The Devourer&lt;/a&gt;\", a powerful monster locked away and frozen by &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20King%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;The Ice King&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter a few weeks, the starving &lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer\"&gt;Devourer&lt;/a&gt; broke free from the &lt;a href=\"Polar%20Peak\"&gt;Polar Peak&lt;/a&gt; and went to the ocean with the &lt;a href=\"Polar%20Peak\"&gt;Polar Peak&lt;/a&gt; castle on it's back and started swimming around the &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt;, returning to the &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt; every now and then, eating buildings from &lt;a href=\"Pleasant%20Park\"&gt;Pleasant Park&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt; to try and satiate it's hunger.\nFollowing these destructive events, &lt;a href=\"Singularity\"&gt;Singularity&lt;/a&gt; partnered with the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; to use Pressure Plant to construct the &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Mecha Team Leader&lt;/a&gt; to fight the monster. &lt;a href=\"Pressure%20Plant\"&gt;Pressure Plant&lt;/a&gt; was soon taken apart, and a new layout built for construction of the Mecha. Meanwhile, around the island, holographic propoganda signs began appearing in areas to help promote support for the mecha construction.\n&lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Mecha Team Leader&lt;/a&gt; finally finished construction at Pressure Plant after two weeks of building. The robot was painted in a range of different colours, as a countdown for &lt;a href=\"The%20Final%20Showdown\"&gt;The Final Showdown&lt;/a&gt; event appeared, an event that would end in victory, or the complete destruction of the island.\nThe Final Showdown.\nWhen the countdown for The Final Showdown reached zero, &lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer\"&gt;The Devourer&lt;/a&gt; entered the island from the north of &lt;a href=\"Lazy%20Lagoon\"&gt;Lazy Lagoon&lt;/a&gt;, sweeping a pirate camp out of its way and blasting its surroundings with a huge beam of energy radiating from its mouth. The monster proceeded to head to Loot Lake, where it attempted to punch its way through the locked Vault. It was at this moment that the mecha activated, piloted by The Paradigm, a memeber of the seven, and distracted the monster from The Vault. After the robot launched two batches of missiles at the Devourer, the creature retaliated by blasting the mecha with an energy beam. After recovering from the strong attack by the monster, the robot sprinted at the monster and boosted into it, lifting it into the air and off the map. After some time, the robot emerged from the water and went back onto the map, seemingly victorious. However, in a plot twist, the monster leapt out of the water and landed on the robot, knocking it to the ground. In the ensuing carnage, The Mecha threw off The Devourer, but was severely damaged with his left arm missing, causing him to collapse on top of Loot Lake. As the monster got back on its feet, Paradigm realized that if she failed, The Devourer would break into The Vault and consume The Zero Point, causing reality to collapse and an end-of-the-world scenario. In a desperate last attempt to kill The Devourer, The Mecha punched through The Vault hatch, grabbing The Zero Point and tearing it out of containment, lifting it out of The Vault and cracking its outer shell, absorbing its energy. As the monster readied up for another attack, Mecha destroyed The Vault hatch by punching through it, tearing The Zero Point out of containment and lifting it out of The Vault. It then proceeded to crack its outer shell, absorbing its energy. When The Devourer attacked again, Mecha set The Zero Point back down and punched the monster round the head, sending it tumbling backwards. With its newfound energy, Mecha approached the singularity statue at Neo Tilted and grabbed it, pulling it out. As the monster slowly regained strength and got back on its feet, the statue was revealed to be a sword called &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Of%20Singularity\"&gt;The Sword Of Singularity&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the Mecha charged the sword with The Zero Point energy and faced the monster in a final showdown. As the two leapt at each other, The Mecha stabbed the sword through The Devourer's head, finally killing it once and for all. As the monster's corpse quickly decomposed leaving behind it's bare skeletal parts, &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Mecha Team Leader&lt;/a&gt; boosted into the sky and disappeared along with Paradigm, Crashing into the Ice Moon.\nHowever, the battle left behind a major problem. The Zero Point was now cracked located above the destroyed Vault. Within the next few days, The Zero Point began getting more cracked and more unstable, starting to pulse rapidly with energy and radiate lots of energy from the cracks on its outer shell. This energy altered time for a tree near it, changing it's leaves from green to an autumn yellow.\nMap Changes.\n The explosive eruption of the Volcano caused devastating damage to locations in the Island, causing the Volcano to collapse on itself and become a Caldera, leaving &lt;a href=\"Tilted%20Towers\"&gt;Tilted Towers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Retail%20Row\"&gt;Retail Row&lt;/a&gt; in nothing but ashes. However &lt;a href=\"Singularity\"&gt;Singularity&lt;/a&gt;, the Guardian of &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, helped rebuilt those destroyed locations and so they rose from the ashes as &lt;a href=\"Neo%20Tilted\"&gt;Neo Tilted&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mega%20Mall\"&gt;Mega Mall&lt;/a&gt;, powered by &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nBattle Pass.\nThe Battle Pass costs , like the previous seasons, and includes a total of 1500 V-Bucks. New in this season are &lt;a href=\"Fortbyte\"&gt;Fortbytes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Fortbyte\"&gt;Fortbytes&lt;/a&gt;: Found around the map, through progression, and Battle Royale.

It started on August 1st 2019, and was scheduled to end on October 6th 2019 but ended on October 13th 2019 after &lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28Chapter%201%29\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Live%20Events\"&gt;Live Event&lt;/a&gt; concluded.\nThe theme of the season revolved around time, and was the final season of Chapter 1. Season X was the only season to use Roman numerals instead of Arabic numerals. \nPreviously, in \"\"....\nThe story continues from the storyline that started in Season 9.\u00a0 The Final Showdown event that finished Season 9 ended with the defeat of The Devourer and Mecha Team Leader's victory. However, in order to defeat the monster, Mecha was forced to tear &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; from its containment from The Vault, and it was left at Loot Lake following the battle. It's outer shell was cracked, causing its inner core to destabilize rapidly in the days leading up to Season X.\nHow did it Start?\nThe Zero Point reached a critical point and exploded, causing a &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Wave\"&gt;Reality Wave&lt;/a&gt; that brought back elements from other realities and timelines on the Island such as an alternate version of &lt;a href=\"Dusty%20Depot\"&gt;Dusty Depot&lt;/a&gt; which was about to be hit by the meteor. A member of &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; arrived outside The Loop at the precise moment of the explosion, which put it and his meteor on pause and created a time bubble around the Zero Point pausing every object inside it.\nThe Season X Storyline.\nDuring the events of &lt;a href=\"Season%209\"&gt;Season 9&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; had manipulated &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt; to contain the Zero Point while preventing &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt; from being destroyed, which prompted &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; to create a plan that would put an end to the Zero Point chaos.\nThen &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; went inside the Loop, and dismantled the &lt;a href=\"B.R.U.T.E.\"&gt;B.R.U.T.E.&lt;/a&gt;s and used their parts to create 7 &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Beacons\"&gt;Rift Beacons&lt;/a&gt; and activate them, which created &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;Rifts&lt;/a&gt; in the sky so the other 6 members from &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt; could come into the &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt; as well. As consequence, in the location of every Rift Beacon, alternative version of POIs from the &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Island's&lt;/a&gt; past returned with a twist, in appearence and effects.\nOnce &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; was done building and activating a Rift Beacon for each member of &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt;, used &lt;a href=\"B.R.U.T.E.\"&gt;B.R.U.T.E.&lt;/a&gt; parts to make himself a new armor and then implanted a virus on them which made them self destruct upon landing. After this, he built a Rocket at &lt;a href=\"Dusty%20Depot\"&gt;Dusty Depot&lt;/a&gt; and set a Timer, and he would launch the Rocket when the Timer reached nothing.\nThe End.\nWhen the countdown reached zero, the rocket launched in a similar manner to how it did in &lt;a href=\"Season%204\"&gt;Season 4&lt;/a&gt;, dropping off its booster and accelerating into the sky, where it opened a rift and went through.\nFollowing this, the rifts created by the Rift Beacons activated, and a rocket emerged from each one. This showed that The Scientist created the beacons with the sole purpose of creating a method for the other members of The Seven to get to the island. Following their arrival to the island, they began circling around aimlessly, before rifting through another set of created rifts.\nThis was followed by a single rift appearing behind The Meteor. A single rocket emerged from it, travelling along the side of the meteor into another rift at its front, before re emerging at the first rift. The other seven rockets followed suite, travelling through the rift and re emerging. The Seven kept repeating this process, increasing their velocity until they were moving at an incredibly high speed, until they unfroze the meteor. This was followed by the meteor falling down and crashing into the rift in front of it, travelling through it and rifting away.\nHowever, The Seven were not done yet. The Zero Point still had to be contained, but to do so, the time bubble surrounding The Zero Point had to be broken. The Time Bubble created when &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; was first brought into the &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt; had to burst. In this case, the meteor had to be rammed into The Zero Point. Another rift appeared high above &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt; and a single rocket emerged, pointed lasers at The Zero Point and boosted straight into it. This unleashed a powerful shockwave that blasted all the players high above and away from the island. This action unfreezed the Zero Point and caused the Bubble around it to become unstable, allowing for the meteor to burst it and hit The Zero Point. The meteor soon emerged from the same rift the rocket emerged from, travelling down towards Loot Lake surrounded by the other rockets. As it crashed into the time bubble surrounding The Zero Point, the remaining six rockets rifted away from The Island, as the time bubble resisted, but soon gave way, with the meteor breaking through and crashing straight into The Zero Point.\nAs the meteor was completely shredded into atoms by The Zero Point, the Zero Point exploded, releasing a tremendous amount of energy. The Zero Point then compressed itself, sucking everything into it and becoming a Black Hole. \nFollowing The End, the entire game became unplayable, and logging in revealed the black hole, swirling blue and energised matter around it. Matter that used to be the island.\nNumbers began randomly appearing around the black hole, and it was soon revealed that The Scientist was trying to communicate. He stated. \"I was not alone. Others were outside the loop. This was not calculated. The nothing is now inevitable\".\nThis was &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; realizing that &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt; had been manipulated, that the Black Hole wasn't calculated and was now inevitable.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt;'s Tapes.\nOnce &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; arrived outside of the Loop, he realized that the only way to activate the Rift Beacons was from inside the Loop, but knowing that he would have his memories wiped out, he recorded tapes to remind himself of several things including his objective.\n\"What The Seven of us are attempting is very risky. I suspect they are not the only ones watching, but it must be done or we lose &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt; forever.\"\nThis suggests that The Imagined Order is watching him as he works, despite knowing that what he is doing in risky, it must be done.\n\"I speculate that no-one calculated the formation of the island. that inter-dimensional matter collisions would resolve rather than push. Now that I witness it first hand, its obvious that pinching alone made it inevitable.\"\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; states that he thinks that nobody calculated how the island formed, and that 'inter-dimensional matter collisions' (matter from different realities colliding together to form The Island) 'would resolve rather than push (suggesting that this was unexpected). At the end, &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; states that 'now that I witness it first hand, its obvious that pinching alone made it inevitable.' This shows that The Scientist is actually seeing how the island formed first-hand, which is what he referred to as 'pinching'.\n\"When I heard this again, will it help me remember? Or once looped will I be just as muted as the others? No matter, it seems the lengthy precautions worked.\"\nThis shows that The Scientist is trapped in the loop, and he created the tapes as a way of remembering what he needed to do. The sentence \"just as muted as the others\" means that, once you go into the Loop, you are unable to talk.\n\"The (unintelligible) theorem was a success. I, us, you arrived outside the loop at the exact moment of expansion. This effectively paused the singularity, giving us time to create the devices needed to synchronize the junction.\"\nThis shows that the pausing of the Zero Point and the Meteor being brought in were apart of his plan, which brought him outside the Loop and gave him enough time to create and activate the Rift Beacons so that the other members of &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt; could come in.\n\"What I didn't factor was that the only way to trigger the device was from within The Loop itself. Thus this hasty and primitive recording, and why now you... I, find myself looped.\"\nThis means that &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; only realized that the only way to activate the Rift Beacons was from within the Loop, which is why he became looped.\n\"Activate the beacon at precisely the moment this timer reaches nothing. The Zero Point must be contained once more. If they are correct, it will be The End.\"\nThe rocket should be activated at the exact moment a timer reaches zero (the timer for The End event). This is so that he could activate the &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;Rifts&lt;/a&gt;, bringing in the rest of &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt;'s objective is to contain the Zero Point once more. \nMap Changes.\n &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; has reached a critical point and has sent a huge pulse throughout the &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt;, bringing back old locations.\nBattle Pass.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pass\"&gt;Battle Pass&lt;/a&gt; costs 950 &lt;a href=\"V-Bucks\"&gt;V-Bucks&lt;/a&gt;, like the previous seasons.\nNew This Season.\nMissions \nNew to Season X were Missions. Missions were like the challenges prior to Season X, except Missions were separated into two bundles: Normal and Prestige. The two bundles were exclusive to Battle Pass owners and granted Battle Stars, XP, cosmetics, and a style for a certain outfit. Free Pass owners received limited-time challenges, which gave Battle Stars, XP, and a weekly Loading Screen with a secret Battle Star.\nTeasers.\nTeaser #1 for Season 10 was released on July 28 2019 at 16:29 ET, during the Fortnite World Cup. That was the first teaser of Season 10 and includes the caption: \"Think Back. 8.1.2019\" hinting to old &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Royale%20Map\"&gt;locations&lt;/a&gt; returning. The first teaser showed off Dusty Depot, the second showed off the B.R.U.T.E., the third showed Eternal Voyager and Catalyst, and the fourth is a video teaser showing the Zero Point explosion (the first seconds of the Season 10 / X trailer)."}

They previously served as one of the five syndicates within &lt;a href=\"MEGA%20City\"&gt;MEGA City&lt;/a&gt;. \nOverview.\nThe Fox Clan are a group of hunters underneath the protection of the kitsunes, each specialized in stealth and combat. The members of the clan are distinguished by their kitsune masks and their &lt;a href=\"Rift\"&gt;Rift&lt;/a&gt;-based powers - taking the form of an electrical aura. \nUntil the events of they were in conflict with the &lt;a href=\"River%20Guard\"&gt;River Guard&lt;/a&gt;, their historical rivals.\nLocations, Members and Technology.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nInfinite Drift Unit.\nA unit composed of Drift variants from different Realities. \nOther Drift variants.\nOther existing Drift variants part of the Fox Clan, but whose status as members of the Infinite Drift Unit is unknown.\nTechnology.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nHistory.\nUnknown Period of Time.\nThe Fox Clan was founded in on the Island of &lt;a href=\"Oninoshima\"&gt;Oninoshima&lt;/a&gt; - and harnessed magic through special masks made by a family of artisans: the ancestors of &lt;a href=\"Daigo\"&gt;Daigo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jade\"&gt;Jade&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kendo\"&gt;Kendo&lt;/a&gt;. One day, their mask suppliers created &lt;a href=\"Masks%20of%20Power\"&gt;Masks of Power&lt;/a&gt;, which contained dangerous capabilities that threatened the whole Island. An event known as the Shattering War broke out between the people of the Island and the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Warriors\"&gt;Demon Warriors&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in most of the masks being destroyed and magic being banished. The Fox Clan was blamed for the incident, and since then became sworn enemies with the &lt;a href=\"River%20Guard\"&gt;River Guard&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%205\"&gt;Season 5&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Drift\"&gt;Drift&lt;/a&gt; is an ordinary human from &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; in the \"real\" world, Earth. After finding and spray-painting a &lt;a href=\"The%20Burger\"&gt;Durrr Burger&lt;/a&gt; head in the desert, he is brought to the island by a &lt;a href=\"Rift\"&gt;Rift&lt;/a&gt;. Over his first few weeks on &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;, he obtains a Fox Clan mask - though it is unknown when and how Drift received his mask, or who gave it to him.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%20X\"&gt;Season X&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Catalyst\"&gt;Catalyst&lt;/a&gt; appears on the island, brought to it by the unstable &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Fox Clan appears to have been attacked and tracked down by an unknown enemy, \"\"something old ... something bad ...\".\" &lt;a href=\"Vi\"&gt;Vi&lt;/a&gt; seems to be the only one to have escaped the attacker, appearing as the last known member of the clan's original iteration. She attempts to contact &lt;a href=\"Drift\"&gt;Drift&lt;/a&gt;, and asks him to team up in order to survive because he too is one of the targets. &lt;a href=\"Vi\"&gt;Vi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drift\"&gt;Drift&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Catalyst\"&gt;Catalyst&lt;/a&gt; are next seen running across rooftops together in the &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Clan%20Reborn\"&gt;\"Fox Clan Reborn\"&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Loading%20Screens\"&gt;loading screen&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Vi\"&gt;Vi&lt;/a&gt;'s secret transmissions to &lt;a href=\"Drift\"&gt;Drift&lt;/a&gt;:\n\"///////Establishing Connection ----Beginning Scan---- Possible match found///// Drift?

I hope. ///Connection terminated.\"\nShortly after the final message, all relevant tweets were deleted.\nA digital avatar and member of the Fox Clan appears on the island: &lt;a href=\"Vox%20Hunter\"&gt;Vox Hunter&lt;/a&gt;. He seems to have succeeded in escaping from the unknown enemy and is here \"to find the truth\", according to the description of the &lt;a href=\"Vox%20Hunter%27s%20Quest%20Pack\"&gt;Vox Hunter's Quest Pack&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Summer%20Drift\"&gt;Summer Drift&lt;/a&gt; is one of three &lt;a href=\"NPCs\"&gt;NPCs&lt;/a&gt; who can spawn on the beach coast of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. When interacted with by certain Fox Clan members, he reveals secret dialogue: \"Are you here on Fox Clan Business?\"\nThree &lt;a href=\"Driftwalker\"&gt;Driftwalker&lt;/a&gt; snapshots took refuge within &lt;a href=\"Faulty%20Splits\"&gt;Faulty Splits&lt;/a&gt; at the abandoned bowling alley - however &lt;a href=\"Joni%20the%20Red\"&gt;Joni the Red&lt;/a&gt; arrived to hunt them down and kill them.\n&lt;a href=\"Vi\"&gt;Vi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drift\"&gt;Drift&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Catalyst\"&gt;Catalyst&lt;/a&gt; seem to be working together; they can appear as a &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Encounters\"&gt;Rift Encounter&lt;/a&gt; with a piece of what looks like an &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;IO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Surface%20Hub%20IO-F4\"&gt;Surface Hub&lt;/a&gt;. However if the &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; approaches, they use their &lt;a href=\"Rift\"&gt;Rift&lt;/a&gt; powers to teleport away - shortly after one of them claims they \"\"can't be here\" and \"need to go back\"\".\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Update%20v23.40\"&gt;Update v23.40&lt;/a&gt;, only two of them appear together in the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Encounters\"&gt;encounter&lt;/a&gt;; they &lt;a href=\"Spyglass\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt; the area, and should the player get too close, state: \"Again?! No! Not right now. Not when they need us.\" - then &lt;a href=\"Rift\"&gt;Rift&lt;/a&gt; away.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Update%20v23.50\"&gt;Update v23.50&lt;/a&gt;, a single member will appear, wordlessly &lt;a href=\"Waterworks\"&gt;upset&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sweaty%20%28Emote%29\"&gt;exhausted&lt;/a&gt; for an unknown reason. They will not teleport, even if the player is close to them.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Mega%20City\"&gt;MEGA City&lt;/a&gt; is being rifted into the island, &lt;a href=\"Stray\"&gt;Stray&lt;/a&gt; falls out of a &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;Rift in the sky&lt;/a&gt;, and lands on &lt;a href=\"Asteria\"&gt;Asteria&lt;/a&gt;. It's later revealed that he had left behind alongside the &lt;a href=\"River%20Guard\"&gt;River Guard&lt;/a&gt; in order to join the Fox Clan during an unknown period of time, raising tensions between the two historic rivals as a result.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate%20Quests\"&gt;Syndicate Quests&lt;/a&gt;, after being impressed by &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;, the Fox Clan agrees to attend a dinner hosted by the &lt;a href=\"Peace%20Syndicate\"&gt;Peace Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; in order to negotiate with the &lt;a href=\"River%20Guard\"&gt;River Guard&lt;/a&gt;. All goes well and resentments are cleared, thus they both become allies to each other and the &lt;a href=\"Peace%20Syndicate\"&gt;Peace Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in their longtime rivalry coming to an end. \n&lt;a href=\"Kimiko%20Five-Tails\"&gt;Kimiko Five Tails&lt;/a&gt; appears on the Island as the guardian of the Fox Clan, though doesn't make herself known until Chapter 4: Season 3.\n&lt;a href=\"Kimiko%20Five-Tails\"&gt;Kimiko Five Tails&lt;/a&gt; reveals herself.\nIn - an offshoot timeline from &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt; - a version of &lt;a href=\"Drift\"&gt;Drift&lt;/a&gt; identical to that within the prime timeline is brought to the island by a &lt;a href=\"Rift\"&gt;Rift&lt;/a&gt; during the same era as &lt;a href=\"Season%205\"&gt;Season 5&lt;/a&gt;, mirroring the initial events of &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt;. Later, another version of &lt;a href=\"Drift\"&gt;Drift&lt;/a&gt;, known as &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Strider%20Drift\"&gt;Rift Strider Drift&lt;/a&gt;, appears in the timeline. \n&lt;a href=\"Rift%20Strider%20Drift\"&gt;Rift Strider Drift&lt;/a&gt; serves as the leader of the Infinite Drift Unit - a combat group entirely composed of alternate versions of &lt;a href=\"Drift\"&gt;Drift&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Skulldrifter\"&gt;Skulldrifter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fishdrift\"&gt;Fishdrift&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Fox Clan returns to &lt;a href=\"Oninoshima\"&gt;Oninoshima&lt;/a&gt;, creating a hideout underneath &lt;a href=\"Twinkle%20Terrace\"&gt;Twinkle Terrace&lt;/a&gt;, a smaller base within &lt;a href=\"Seaport%20City\"&gt;Seaport City&lt;/a&gt;, and founding the \"&lt;a href=\"All%20You%20Can%20Catch%21\"&gt;All You Can Catch!&lt;/a&gt;\" restaurant. Various kitsune statues can be found scattered throughout the island as well. \n&lt;a href=\"Vi\"&gt;Vi&lt;/a&gt; patrols &lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Blossoms%20Farm\"&gt;Rolling Blossoms Farm&lt;/a&gt;, and reveals that though they seem to have sustained positive relationships with their allies (namely &lt;a href=\"Mizuki\"&gt;Mizuki&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"River%20Guard\"&gt;River Guard&lt;/a&gt;), the emergence of &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Warriors\"&gt;the Oni&lt;/a&gt; and various &lt;a href=\"Oni%20Masks\"&gt;elemental masks&lt;/a&gt; across the island seem to trouble the clan, and brings contemplation towards the mending of their &lt;a href=\"River%20Guard\"&gt;historic rivalry&lt;/a&gt;. With danger on the horizon, she confides in her worries with &lt;a href=\"Catalyst\"&gt;Catalyst&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kimiko%20Five-Tails\"&gt;Kimiko Five-Tails&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vi\"&gt;Vi&lt;/a&gt;, likewise to their formal rival &lt;a href=\"Mizuki\"&gt;Mizuki&lt;/a&gt;, also shows a disliking towards &lt;a href=\"Daigo\"&gt;Daigo&lt;/a&gt; and his ancestors, hinting at another historic fued and a threat to their safety.\nAdmist the remergence of the Fox Clan, &lt;a href=\"Vox%20Hunter\"&gt;Vox Hunter&lt;/a&gt; has sustained his passion for poetry which &lt;a href=\"Vi\"&gt;Vi&lt;/a&gt; indulges in. &lt;a href=\"Drift\"&gt;Drift&lt;/a&gt; appears to have taken &lt;a href=\"Stray\"&gt;Stray&lt;/a&gt; as a direct mentee - though &lt;a href=\"Vi\"&gt;Vi&lt;/a&gt; seems to have to remind him to train his apprentice. \nThough the &lt;a href=\"River%20Guard\"&gt;River Guard&lt;/a&gt; too seems to reflect on their history with the clan, neither side appears to want to break their ongoing peace treaty - should none cause any problems for the other.\nMessages.\nOn January 24th 2021, the banner and profile picture of &lt;a href=\"https%3A//twitter.com/FortniteGame\"&gt;Fortnite's Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; was changed to &lt;a href=\"Vi\"&gt;Vi&lt;/a&gt;'s logo.

This broke Apple's terms of service (as they take a cut of all app store purchases) and, therefore, resulted in the removal of Fortnite from the App Store. Following this decision, Epic decided to sue apple for creating a monopoly, as they were the only app store on iOS, which Epic Games considered to be unfair to publishers. Meanwhile, iOS players were stuck with and could not progress their battle passes anymore. They also could no longer play with friends from other platforms that used a newer version of the game. Epic started a campaign in order to Free Fortnite, intending to raise public awareness for their campaign.\nFortnite uploaded a parody of &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DVtvjbmoDx-I\"&gt;Apple's \"Macintosh\" commercial&lt;/a&gt;, which itself parodies the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four\"&gt;book title of the same name&lt;/a&gt; by George Orwell called &lt;a href=\"Nineteen%20Eighty-Fortnite\"&gt;Nineteen Eighty-Four&lt;/a&gt;.\nImpact.\nDue to the events listed above, all iOS, macOS, and some Android players lost access to the ability to download Fortnite and could not update it. This resulted in them being stuck in . However, most Android players are still able to download the game from the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//fortnite.com\"&gt;The Official Fortnite Website&lt;/a&gt; and update it from the Epic Games app, which is installed upon downloading Fortnite from the website.\nEpic Games also lost their developer accounts, meaning their other games, such as Battle Breakers, were also removed from the App Store on iOS and Google Play on Android.\nDifferences.\nThere are, however, subtle hints to , making this Season 3.5.\nJudge Ruling.\nOn September 10th 2021, the judge gave their ruling on the Epic Games and Apple Court Case. Epic ended up losing, with Apple winning 9 out of 10 counts. Epic, however, won the most important count, which was that app developers should allow users to use other payment methods without using the App Store.\nTim Sweeney said that Fortnite will return to the App Store when Epic can allow their in app-payment alongside Apple's in-app payment system.\nHowever, Apple said that Epic will not be allowed back onto the App store until the court case is complete, which could take up to 5 years.\nFortnite's Return to Mobile and macOS.\nEven though Epic Games will likely not get back onto Apple and Google stores soon, Fortnite returned on mobile devices and macOS through several means :"}
