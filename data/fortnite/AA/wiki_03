SHADOW is under the direct authority and control of &lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt;, the original founder, but has also been managed by other higher ups, such as &lt;a href=\"Brutus\"&gt;Brutus&lt;/a&gt;, Midas' right-hand man, &lt;a href=\"Meowdas\"&gt;Meowdas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Director\"&gt;Chaos Director&lt;/a&gt; and formerly &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Agent%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Chaos Agent&lt;/a&gt;. \nDuring Chapter 2 and Chapter 3, they offered the services of their agents to various clients such as &lt;a href=\"Spillexx\"&gt;Spillexx&lt;/a&gt;. They also established an illegal arms trafficking system, orchestrated numerous efforts at infiltrating opposing groups, and conducted experiments at both &lt;a href=\"Slurpy%20Swamp\"&gt;Slurpy Swamp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Steamy%20Stacks\"&gt;Steamy Stacks&lt;/a&gt;. Their most well known operation was waging war against &lt;a href=\"GHOST\"&gt;GHOST&lt;/a&gt;, following the conflicts and rivalry between the teams in A.L.T.E.R. and E.G.O.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Chapter%202%20Remix\"&gt;Chapter 2 Remix&lt;/a&gt;, they were contracted by &lt;a href=\"Snoop%27s%20Enterprise\"&gt;Snoop's Enterprise&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nSHADOW is the first division of Midas' crew , and has existed long before GHOST, due to &lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt; having formed the group before the events of . Their founding members were &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Origins\"&gt;Chaos Origins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sierra\"&gt;Sierra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Wolf\"&gt;The Burning Wolf&lt;/a&gt;, though they have expanded plenty since. From until , SHADOW was mostly inactive, with many of the offline agents acting independently outside the faction, offering their services to more \"current\" organizations like the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; during . They did, however, publicly become active again from and beyond. \nIn , &lt;a href=\"Marigold\"&gt;Marigold&lt;/a&gt; called back Midas' crew after she discovered Midas was in &lt;a href=\"The%20Underworld\"&gt;The Underworld&lt;/a&gt;, and both the major players from both SHADOW \"and\" GHOST reconciled their former grudges, reuniting the crew anew.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Chapter%202%20Remix\"&gt;Chapter 2 Remix&lt;/a&gt;, two agents are revealed to co-lead SHADOW, &lt;a href=\"Meowdas\"&gt;Meowdas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Director\"&gt;Chaos Director&lt;/a&gt;, the later being &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Agent\"&gt;Chaos Agent&lt;/a&gt;'s boss and the one who granted him authority over the faction back in Chapter 2. SHADOW, along with GHOST, were also contracted by Snoop's Enterprise to protect their bases.\nLocations, Members and Technology.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nFormer Owned Business.\nTechnology.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nHistory.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nBefore Chapter 2.\n&lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt; founded &lt;a href=\"Midas%27%20Crew\"&gt;his crew&lt;/a&gt; at an unknown time in an unknown reality. Through his covert skills, he set his sights on building an empire of espionage, intrigue, and conquest. For this he recruited three people with great potential to his cause:\nTogether, they formed &lt;a href=\"The%20First%20Shadows\"&gt;The First Shadows&lt;/a&gt;: the very first agents of the newly formed faction named &lt;a href=\"SHADOW\"&gt;SHADOW&lt;/a&gt;. This marked the official beginning for the organization beyond Midas' personal conquest.\nAfter an unknown period of time, a new faction appeared in Midas' crew, named &lt;a href=\"GHOST\"&gt;GHOST&lt;/a&gt;, which quickly became rivals with SHADOW. The &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; recruits the services of GHOST to study and map Apollo. Unbeknownst to GHOST at the time, SHADOW had already begun engaging in various operations on &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;the island&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe E.G.O. team from GHOST and the A.L.T.E.R. team from SHADOW began entering into conflicts which triggered infighting among Midas' crew. A.L.T.E.R. agents started to oppose the members of E.G.O. and deliberately chased them down, with &lt;a href=\"Rippley%20vs%20Sludge\"&gt;Rippley&lt;/a&gt; being one of their main targets.\nLater in the season, &lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt; selects &lt;a href=\"Eye%20Land\"&gt;Eye Land&lt;/a&gt; as the new grounds for the main base of GHOST, likely aware of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; stationed underneath it. Simultaneously, construction on five SHADOW Safe Houses around the island begins.\n&lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt; founded &lt;a href=\"The%20Agency\"&gt;The Agency&lt;/a&gt;, his employment organization for spies from both the factions of GHOST \"and\" SHADOW. The organization has its headquarters of the same name built on &lt;a href=\"Eye%20Land\"&gt;Eye Land&lt;/a&gt;. Conflicts between SHADOW and GHOST escalate, and grow into an all-out Spy War.\nWith The Agency now built, and tension arisen between the two, the war between GHOST and SHADOW begins in full.\nWhile Meowscles controlled The Yacht for GHOST, there were three members of Midas' crew who had not yet chosen their allegiance and remained neutral at the beginning: Brutus, TNTina and Skye.\n&lt;br&gt;\nHowever, throughout the season, the balance of power between GHOST and SHADOW changed enormously:\nDuring the war, Midas gradually worked on a &lt;a href=\"Doomsday%20Device\"&gt;Doomsday Device&lt;/a&gt; with his daughter &lt;a href=\"Jules\"&gt;Jules&lt;/a&gt; made to break free from &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt;. This Device was located in his room, directly underneath The Agency, and possibly right above &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;. \nMidas' room housed several things that hinted at his involvement behind the scenes:\nNear the end of the season, &lt;a href=\"Renegade%20Shadow\"&gt;Renegade Shadow&lt;/a&gt; storms &lt;a href=\"The%20Agency\"&gt;The Agency&lt;/a&gt; for SHADOW\u2019s conquest. Countdowns for the activation of Midas' Device began appearing in the Agency and in Midas' own room.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Device%20%28event%29\"&gt;The Device&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Device was activated on June 15, 2020. Upon its initiation, Midas' voice and several other Henchmen voices could've been heard as it executed its functions to try and push &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt; back, destroying much of The Agency.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe Device's plan ultimately failed, and the Storm attacked The Device in retaliation, and turned into a giant &lt;a href=\"The%20Wall%20Of%20Water\"&gt;Wall of Water&lt;/a&gt;. \nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Live%20Events\"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;, Midas publicly reappears aligned with SHADOW, and controls what's left of The Agency for the now opposing faction - though he remains the de facto leader of GHOST.\nThe giant Wall of Water created by The Storm collapsed, flooding the entire Island. The headquarters of SHADOW are now &lt;a href=\"The%20Authority\"&gt;The Authority&lt;/a&gt;, a larger version of The Agency re-constructed by &lt;a href=\"Jules\"&gt;Jules&lt;/a&gt;, and implemented a large anti-flood wall that surrounds the compound. Midas was attacked by a &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Shark\"&gt;Loot Shark&lt;/a&gt;.\nSHADOW continues the war against GHOST who built &lt;a href=\"The%20Fortilla\"&gt;The Fortilla&lt;/a&gt; as their new headquarters, albeit less aggressively. They kept them outnumbered until the end of the season.\n\nBoth &lt;a href=\"The%20Authority\"&gt;The Authority&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Fortilla\"&gt;The Fortilla&lt;/a&gt; have been completely abandoned, and the war between GHOST and SHADOW seems to have ended, with many members now working for themselves, waiting to return online again., pursuing other goals.\n\nSHADOW, still inactive, is investigated by detective &lt;a href=\"Sleuth\"&gt;Sleuth&lt;/a&gt;, who seeks to hunt down all the agents of both SHADOW and &lt;a href=\"GHOST\"&gt;GHOST&lt;/a&gt;. Sleuth is ultimately unsuccessful. \n&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"Marigold\"&gt;Marigold&lt;/a&gt;, a member of Midas' crew, arrives on the island, and just like Midas, she is cursed with the Golden Touch. In her &lt;a href=\"Marigold%27s%20Quests\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt;, she mentions that someone was spending Midas' gold, and recruited the services of &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; for revenge.\n\n&lt;a href=\"Marigold\"&gt;Marigold&lt;/a&gt; along with several &lt;a href=\"GHOST\"&gt;GHOST&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"SHADOW\"&gt;SHADOW&lt;/a&gt; henchmen went to collect something. \nMarigold is in on a secret plan with Midas and Jules, as she looks for a getaway driver.\nFor &lt;a href=\"Cosmic%20Summer%20Celebration\"&gt;Cosmic Summer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Midsummer%20Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt; reappears with other agents of his crew, including &lt;a href=\"Beach%20Jules\"&gt;Jules&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beach%20Brutus\"&gt;Brutus&lt;/a&gt;, for an undercover mission.\n&lt;br&gt;\nWe also learn that SHADOW agents infiltrated and sabotaged &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20First%20Shadows\"&gt;The First Shadows&lt;/a&gt; reappeared for unspecified reasons..\nDuring the War against &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt;, several SHADOW members have joined the ranks of the Imagined Order:\nMany former and current members of SHADOW have joined one of two organizations: &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Blooded\"&gt;Cold Blooded&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Most%20Wanted%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Most Wanted&lt;/a&gt;.

They were introduced in .\nFunctionality.\nSHADOW Briefings are terminals found throughout the map, sent by . Interacting with them will prompt the player to accept or not a challenge in exchange for a reward. In most cases, completing the briefing within a time limit is necessary to redeem its rewards, but in some, the challenge itself is the reward. A SHADOW Briefing always offer the same specific challenge, that can only be accepted once a match, despite if it gets concluded or not. If the time limit approaches its end, a ticking clock sound will be heard, followed by a \"FAILED\" warning above the quest if it is not completed before expiration.\nSHADOW Briefings can currently be found in 3 types, each containing a unique challenge and reward: Plunder, Supply Drop, and Armory. All SHADOW Briefings have predetermined spawn locations and are marked on the map as a small white notebook.\nThere are also 6 other types of SHADOW Briefings, including 2 special variations, that are vaulted as of : Bounty, Vehicle, Waxen Wings, Footrace, &lt;a href=\"SHADOW%20Briefings%23Midas%20Service%20Stations\"&gt;Midas Service Stations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"SHADOW%20Briefings%23Jigsaw%27s%20Challenge\"&gt;Jigsaw's Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.\nChallenges.\nPlunder.\n\"Note: If the quest is not completed within the time limit, all remaining chests are destroyed.\"\nArmory.\n\"Note: The Armory SHADOW Briefing spawns with at least one challenge from each weapon class. Accepting a challenge removes it from that terminal. After completing a challenge, the terminal can be interacted with again to start another, if any are still available.\"\nVaulted Challenges.\nVehicle.\n\"Note: The vehicle will be marked whenever exiting it if the quest has not yet been completed.\"\nMidas Service Stations.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Rise%20of%20Midas\"&gt;Rise of Midas&lt;/a&gt; Event, various small terminals could be found around the island and offered various services for &lt;a href=\"Bars\"&gt;Bars&lt;/a&gt;.\nJigsaw's Challenge.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Fortnitemares%202024\"&gt;Fortnitemares 2024&lt;/a&gt; Event, various TV monitors could be found around the &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt;.

The other differences being that Jigsaw's Challenges don't start a quest the moment they are interacted with, but another player is required to interact with another Jigsaw's Challenge to start the quest. The quest is thought of as a duel and not a &lt;a href=\"Bounties\"&gt;hunt&lt;/a&gt;, so there is no hunter nor hunted but their locations will be marked on the minimap with a yellow circle that updates every TBD seconds. Should neither player manage to eliminate their opponent within 5 minutes, the mask placed on both player's heads when interacting with a Jigsaw's Challenge will explode, eliminating both of them. However, If one of the two players or their teammates eliminates their opponent within the time limit,the winning player will be awarded with &lt;a href=\"Boom%20Billy\"&gt;Boom Billy&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Broom\"&gt;Witch Broom&lt;/a&gt;, and other loot, and their mask will be removed.

She's a young adventurer who travels around with her shapeshifting friend &lt;a href=\"Ollie\"&gt;Ollie&lt;/a&gt;. \nPersonality.\nSkye is a cheerful and creative young girl who is an adventurer at heart. She loves travelling around in nature with her shapeshifting buddy &lt;a href=\"Ollie\"&gt;Ollie&lt;/a&gt; and taking photos along their journeys. She seems to be fascinated with the stars, as evident by the space telescopes at her &lt;a href=\"Skye%27s%20Campsites\"&gt;campsites&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Shark\"&gt;The Shark&lt;/a&gt;, and she likes the sea as well, considering her campsites were all coastal.\nBased on her room &amp; campsites, she enjoys things like plushies, board games, colorful toys, video games &amp; more, and judging by all the books in her room, she also enjoys reading. She likes to doodle &amp; fold paper into origami, as seen on her photo board, along with other creative activities such as sewing, as seen by &lt;a href=\"Winter%27s%20Wings\"&gt;Winter's Wings&lt;/a&gt; and the Ollie plush on her shelf, and scrapbooking. It is shown via the emotes her character used that she also enjoys skip roping, toys like paddle ball, and tea / tea parties.\nAppearance.\nSkye is a small, young-looking girl with blue eyes &amp; brown hair who wears a shapeshifting creature named &lt;a href=\"Ollie\"&gt;Ollie&lt;/a&gt; as her hat. Despite being a part of Midas' Crew, she wears a cool-weather camping outfit reminiscent of a world akin to ours, and her customized backpack holds seemingly hand-made fantasy references. She wears pins that resemble a stylized version of Scout pins, one of them that she likely gave to Guff stating so. She also carries a white &amp; red kids' polaroid camera around her neck.\nHistory.\nSkye was stationed at &lt;a href=\"The%20Shark\"&gt;The Shark&lt;/a&gt; during the war between GHOST and SHADOW, but was often out camping and exploring the island instead. As the faction war progressed, she was forced to choose sides, and became the only member of &lt;a href=\"Midas%27%20Crew\"&gt;Midas' Crew&lt;/a&gt; to stay with Ghost before The Flood, damaging her bonds with the Crew. The Shark was then ordered to be renovated into a high-security prison by Midas.\nThe Shark was destroyed by The Flood, and Skye went AWOL for a long time. It is unknown whether she went to the Fortilla with the rest of GHOST, or if she went her own way.\nShortly before the arrival of Thor and the Marvel heroes and villains, Midas shut down the operations of The Crew on the island and made them abandon their respective posts, putting every agent offline for an unknown reason. Due to Skye technically still being a part of Ghost, and having cut ties / lost communication with the Crew, it is unknown if she was aware of this or not.\nThe war between GHOST and SHADOW seemingly ended, and &lt;a href=\"Sleuth\"&gt;Sleuth&lt;/a&gt; had started attempting to unravel their web and track down all the Agents, though was unsuccessful.\nSkye and Ollie appeared on a computer screen in &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. They were being monitored by the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt;. She was later seen with &lt;a href=\"Summer%20Skye\"&gt;another version&lt;/a&gt; of herself.\nIt was hinted that Skye and &lt;a href=\"Meowscles\"&gt;Meowscles&lt;/a&gt; were hiding inside &lt;a href=\"Command%20Cavern\"&gt;Command Cavern&lt;/a&gt;'s vents, potentially spying for a way to get Skye off the Island and home to her family. In , only Meowscles emerged from Command Cavern, and it is unclear whether whatever their mission was ended in success.\nA &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Wonder%20Skye\"&gt;version of Skye&lt;/a&gt; showed up to celebrate the &lt;a href=\"Winterfest%202022\"&gt;Winter festivities&lt;/a&gt;, though it is unknown whether it was really her or a snapshot of herself.\n&lt;a href=\"LEGO%20Fortnite\"&gt;LEGO Fortnite&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkye can be found as a villager in LEGO Fortnite. She'll let you know that she loves adventure, and her friends Ollie and Guff.\nSkye's photo board washed ashore on a small, unnamed island on the northeastern shore of &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt;. There were also a few snowman &lt;a href=\"Ollie\"&gt;Ollies&lt;/a&gt; in the snow biome that the player could build during &lt;a href=\"Winterfest%202023\"&gt;Winterfest 2023&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkye appeared at &lt;a href=\"Catcher%27s%20Cove\"&gt;Catcher's Cove&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt; island, returning at the call of &lt;a href=\"Marigold\"&gt;Marigold&lt;/a&gt; to help her old friends out and investigate a lead on Midas. She set up a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Skye%2527s_Campsites%23Helios\"&gt;campsite&lt;/a&gt; in the northeast of &lt;a href=\"The%20Underworld\"&gt;The Underworld&lt;/a&gt; in order to create a base of operations for The Crew whilst searching for Midas. Their bonds were slightly repaired, and she left the island with the crew aboard &lt;a href=\"The%20Marigold\"&gt;The Marigold&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Chapter%202%20Remix\"&gt;Chapter 2 Remix&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkye, now wearing an &lt;a href=\"Undercover%20Skye\"&gt;\"undercover\" outfit&lt;/a&gt;, arrived on the &lt;a href=\"Chapter%202%20Remix\"&gt;remixed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; island, roaming around and sightseeing. She was contracted by &lt;a href=\"Snoop%27s%20Enterprise\"&gt;Snoop's Enterprise&lt;/a&gt; along with other &lt;a href=\"Midas%27%20Crew\"&gt;Midas' Crew&lt;/a&gt; agents.\nReferences.\n=Audio=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

They also deal damage if the player gets struck by one. However, they do not directly damage the objective themselves. \nSmashers are highly impact resistant, but for all the power they possess, they have one significant weakness: limited stamina. After attacking one wall, a Smasher will tire out and be defenseless for several seconds, giving the player an opportunity to significantly damage it.\nIn later areas, their charge attack can be particularly devastating, able to heavily damage an unaware &lt;a href=\"Heroes\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt;, if not outright kill them. They can be found roaming in the map starting in higher levels of the Plankerton zone and often appear during sieges in all tiers. They are especially dangerous when close quarters near the base. They are highly resistant to impact and are hard to eliminate due to their high health. Smashers are the only Mist Monster that can be &lt;a href=\"Elements\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; and spawn as an &lt;a href=\"Mini-Bosses\"&gt;Epic Mini-Boss&lt;/a&gt;.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nOther.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

This phenomenon is caused when someone manages to escape The Loop. It does this by creating a copy of this person which escaped the loop to stay inside of Reality Zero, or in other words, Snapshots. \n&lt;a href=\"Bunker%20Jonesy\"&gt;Bunker Jonesy&lt;/a&gt;, one of &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;John Jones&lt;/a&gt;' snapshots, explains that he came on to the island after being told to jump into the Zero Point to see what would happen. Each Jonesy with an NPC Character descriptions all tell different reasons why each came inside The Loop too. For example, &lt;a href=\"Grill%20Sergeant\"&gt;Grill Sergeant&lt;/a&gt;'s Character description explains he came to the island to investigate the food wars that were happening. In the part 2 of the Spire quests, after talking with Bunker Jonesy, he mentions that once one is in the Loop, they are just a snapshot of who they were (he does not go into the details of whether the person they were before is out of the Loop or not, but its most likely that).\nAfter Chapter 3, the creation of Snapshots likely stopped as The Loop is presumed to have not been recreated after the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Collision\"&gt;Collision&lt;/a&gt; followed by the annihilation of &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt; itself during &lt;a href=\"Fracture\"&gt;Fracture&lt;/a&gt;.

Each of these has lasted for a chapter of Fortnite. Chapters 1 and 2 lasted about 2 years, Chapters 3 and 4 lasted 1 year, and Chapter 5 is still ongoing. These islands are internally named after Greek gods, with the first four starting with 'A'. The islands change with each chapter, however Chapter 4 is the only chapter to have an island change during the chapter itself instead of after its conclusion.\nHere is a showcase of these islands in their most recent state:\nNamed Locations.\nNamed Locations are the largest types of locations, and usually considered the best due to their plentiful loot. As stated in their name, these locations have names - that are often alliterative (two words in which the starting letter in each word is the same, such as Retail Row) - which are also seen labelled on the map.They are quite large in size - often resembling towns and cities, and because of this, many &lt;a href=\"Chests%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;Chests&lt;/a&gt; can be found in these locations to give good loot.\nLandmarks.\nLandmarks are smaller versions of named locations that still have names, but are not labelled on the map. Their names are only seen on the screen when entering the area. Like named locations, most Landmarks have alliterative names.\nThey still have moderately good perks, and are the most common type of location.\nUnnamed Locations.\nUnnamed Locations are locations, similar to &lt;a href=\"Landmarks\"&gt;Landmarks&lt;/a&gt; but without official names. Due to this, the community often grant these locations names - like &lt;a href=\"Yonder%20Yard\"&gt;Yonder Yard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Factory\"&gt;Factories&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, their name could have been as simple as &lt;a href=\"Volcano\"&gt;Volcano&lt;/a&gt;.As &lt;a href=\"Landmarks\"&gt;Landmarks&lt;/a&gt; were only added in Chapter 2, they are considered as the replacement for Unnamed Locations. However, some notable locations without names have still existed in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3."}

The IO used The Zero Point to travel to different Realities in their plan to perfect them and create the ideal civilization, trapping people in The Island's &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;Loop&lt;/a&gt; for research, disastrously affecting the development of worlds.\nThe Loop.\n They utilize &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt;, a 22 minute time loop that is used to trap anyone who arrives on the Island, erasing their memory and rendering them unable to speak. The Loop uses &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt; to push combatants together over the 22 minute period, eventually closing all the way in and eliminating anyone trapped in it. If someone is to be the last standing in the loop, at the exact closing point of the storm, they will escape the loop, and wake up in the same spot they left, with all of the Loop's effects gone, yet still trapped on the Island. Eventually, The Imagined Order began experimenting with &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt;, kidnapping people from different realities and trapping them on the island, where they fought again and again in a \"\". The IO also creates &lt;a href=\"IO%20Hatches\"&gt;Bunker Hatches&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt; sends his daughters into the Loop, confident that they were so perfect, they would be the first to escape the loop. When his daughters finally manage to escape the loop, &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt; had already replaced them with stronger &lt;a href=\"Snapshots\"&gt;Snapshots&lt;/a&gt; of themselves.\nThe Ice Moon.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Kingdom\"&gt;The Ice Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20King%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;The Ice King&lt;/a&gt;, travelled across realities with allies to collect powerful technology, artifacts, and beings too dangerous to exist. When The Ice King's &lt;a href=\"The%20Prisoner\"&gt;staunchest comrade&lt;/a&gt; argued to use their collected items to alter realities to their liking, &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20King%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;The Ice King&lt;/a&gt; froze him and all his knights in his fortress. &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20King%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;The Ice King&lt;/a&gt; brought &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt; before freezing himself to sleep forever, leaving &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt; to orbit &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cube King's End.\n &lt;a href=\"The%20Origin%23Lore\"&gt;The Cube King&lt;/a&gt; is captured by the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt;. They abuse him for knowledge about The Last Reality. &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%20Queen\"&gt;The Cube Queen&lt;/a&gt; becomes the ruler of &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Seven's Formation.\nA group of seven members form together with the aim of destroying the IO, and liberating &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; is the leader of the group. The Cube King joins as &lt;a href=\"The%20Origin\"&gt;The Origin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno's&lt;/a&gt; daughters join as &lt;a href=\"The%20Imagined\"&gt;The Imagined&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Order\"&gt;The Order&lt;/a&gt;. The other members join, better known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Visitor\"&gt;The Visitor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt; fear &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt;, as he and the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt;, with the control of &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, can cause potential catastrophic damage to &lt;a href=\"The%20Omniverse\"&gt;The Omniverse&lt;/a&gt; as a whole. The Seven develop sealed environment suits as a way to enter and leave The Loop anytime they want without being affected by the Loop's effects. &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt; left the Seven and joined the IO temporarily.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20First%20Shadows\"&gt;The First Shadows&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt; set his sights on building an empire of espionage, intrigue, and conquest. He founded &lt;a href=\"SHADOW\"&gt;SHADOW&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shattering War.\nIn on &lt;a href=\"Oninoshima\"&gt;Oninoshima&lt;/a&gt; Island, the &lt;a href=\"River%20Guard\"&gt;River Guard&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Clan\"&gt;Fox Clan&lt;/a&gt; were etablished. The later were in possession of powerful magic masks allowing them to travel realities. However, the mask maker the Fox Clan, becoming too ambitious, created the &lt;a href=\"Oni%20Masks\"&gt;Masks of Power&lt;/a&gt;, powerful and magical Oni Masks that threatened the whole Island. From this, the first &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Warriors\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; appeared and a war broke out between the Island and the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Warriors\"&gt;demonic forces&lt;/a&gt;, the event known as the Shattering War, resulting in the the destruction of most of the masks, the sealing of demons in the Spirit Realm and the banishment of magic on the Island. The Fox Clan were blamed for the entire incident, and they and the River Guard became sworn enemies.\n&lt;a href=\"Pre-Season\"&gt;Pre-Season&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Looper.\nThe main character that the player controls, only dubbed \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;\" by The Foundation, gets trapped in the Loop and joins the battle royale against other combatants.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%203\"&gt;Season 3&lt;/a&gt;.\nA comet appears in the sky above the island. It gradually gets closer over time. During the final weeks of the season, Small meteorites begin to land on the island as a precursor to the large meteor. Players theorized that The Comet would destroy &lt;a href=\"Tilted%20Towers\"&gt;Tilted Towers&lt;/a&gt;, as the inhabitants of the island who had previously escaped The Loop began observing the mysterious object with telescopes dotted around the island.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%204\"&gt;Season 4&lt;/a&gt;.\nNew Characters: &lt;a href=\"The%20Visitor\"&gt;The Visitor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Omega\"&gt;Omega&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carbide%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Carbide&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Dusty%20Depot\"&gt;The Impact&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Meteor\"&gt;The Comet&lt;/a&gt; finally slams into the island, crashing into the factories near Salty Springs, destroying Dusty Depot almost completely and creating a gigantic crater in the ground, scattered with hop rocks. Other, smaller comet fragments land around the island, damaging &lt;a href=\"Tilted%20Towers\"&gt;Tilted Towers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prison\"&gt;The Prison&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Risky%20Reels\"&gt;Risky Reels&lt;/a&gt;. At the center of the main crater, now called &lt;a href=\"Dusty%20Divot\"&gt;Dusty Divot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Government\"&gt;The Government&lt;/a&gt; sets up a research station to monitor a mysterious rock at the center of the crater. The mysterious organization takes over the island, and begins to patch up the smaller craters around the island and rebuild.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Visitor\"&gt;The Visitor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Visitor, a member of The Seven, dedicated to wiping out the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;IO&lt;/a&gt;, is revealed to be in stasis in a pod within the Dusty Divot rock. Eventually, he awakens and breaks out, trashing the facility and making his way to &lt;a href=\"Villain%20Lair\"&gt;Villain Lair&lt;/a&gt;, located in the mountains near Snobby Shores as a prop for the upcoming movie being filmed, which actually contained a fully-functioning rocket.\nLights, Camera, Action.\nA film production is started about a supervillain; &lt;a href=\"Omega\"&gt;Omega&lt;/a&gt; escaping from a prison that was hit by a meteor, forming a robot army of &lt;a href=\"Chromium\"&gt;Chromiums&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diecast\"&gt;Diecasts&lt;/a&gt;, and destroying the heroes using the rocket. &lt;a href=\"Carbide%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Carbide&lt;/a&gt; and his team of superheroes fight against Omega in the final showdown of the film.\n&lt;a href=\"Blast%20Off\"&gt;The Blast Off&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the movie was being filmed, the Government collects and moves all of the &lt;a href=\"Hop%20Rocks\"&gt;Hop Rocks&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Villain%20Lair\"&gt;Villain Lair&lt;/a&gt; from each of the craters in a convoy of trucks. &lt;a href=\"The%20Visitor\"&gt;The Visitor&lt;/a&gt; takes over the base, and modifies the Rocket to be able to traverse realities using the hop rocks. The Visitor launches the rocket, opening temporary &lt;a href=\"Rift\"&gt;rifts&lt;/a&gt; to teleport around the island. Eventually, the rocket boosts into the sky, creating a gigantic &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;Sideways Rift&lt;/a&gt; leading to an unknown destination. This event destabilized Reality Zero, and left it vulnerable to &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;future invaders&lt;/a&gt;.\nSituation Worsens.\nAs Reality Zero continues to destabilize, &lt;a href=\"Rift\"&gt;rifts&lt;/a&gt; around the island begin opening to other Realities, bringing and taking props or even &lt;a href=\"Drift\"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt;, to and from &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt;. The Sideways Rift grows larger, as it brings and takes more items from Realities. Several &lt;a href=\"Supply%20Llama\"&gt;Supply Llamas&lt;/a&gt; are rifted to various places on Earth, including Paris, Cologne, Cannes, Warsaw, and London. The &lt;a href=\"The%20Burger\"&gt;Durrr Burger Mascot&lt;/a&gt; was rifted into Antelope Valley, California, and was the start of the &lt;a href=\"Season%205\"&gt;Season 5&lt;/a&gt; ARG. Several objects were brought to the island instead, including an ancient wagon, dinosaur bones, and... a ship anchor?\n&lt;a href=\"Season%205\"&gt;Season 5&lt;/a&gt;.\nNew Characters: &lt;a href=\"Drift\"&gt;Drift&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brite%20Bomber\"&gt;Brite Bomber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cuddle%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Cuddle Team Leader&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rex%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Rex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Corruption%20Cubes\"&gt;Kevin the Cube&lt;/a&gt;\nWorlds Collide.\nThe Sideways Rift pools massive amounts of matter to Reality Zero from other realities, bringing in &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20Palms\"&gt;Paradise Palms&lt;/a&gt;, The Desert, &lt;a href=\"Lazy%20Links\"&gt;Lazy Links&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Viking%20Village\"&gt;Viking Village&lt;/a&gt; to the island, but destroying Moisty Mires and Anarchy Acres in the process. Smaller &lt;a href=\"Rift\"&gt;rifts&lt;/a&gt; are clustered around the changed areas, as space-time in those areas are recovering from the shifts. &lt;a href=\"Drift\"&gt;Drift&lt;/a&gt; is rifted to Reality Zero after painting graffiti on the Durr Burger, and is caught in the transition when the burger is sent back to the island.\nRoad Trip.\n&lt;a href=\"Drift\"&gt;Drift&lt;/a&gt; and his new friends &lt;a href=\"Cuddle%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Cuddle Team Leader&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brite%20Bomber\"&gt;Brite Bomber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rex%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Rex&lt;/a&gt; travel around the Island, meeting more people participating in activities. They visit the &lt;a href=\"The%20Burger\"&gt;The Burger&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"Lazy%20Links\"&gt;Lazy Links&lt;/a&gt;, then the &lt;a href=\"Race%20Track\"&gt;Race Track&lt;/a&gt;, then the Dinosaur statues, then finally &lt;a href=\"Risky%20Reels\"&gt;Risky Reels&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fox%20Clan\"&gt;Fox Clan&lt;/a&gt;'s Target.\nDuring the road trip, Drift gets a mask from a stranger, making him a member of the &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Clan\"&gt;Fox Clan&lt;/a&gt;, but also a target for a mysterious group of people. Drift progresses throughout his stages as the weeks go on.\nBalance and Order.\nAs Reality Zero starts to heal, and the Sideways Rift starts to close, The &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; send &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;The Enforcers&lt;/a&gt; to the island, who aim to restore balance and order. They arrive through rifts and return objects that previously vanished through interdimensional travel back to the island.\nThe Cube Emerges.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt; exploit the instability of Reality Zero, corrupting The Sideways Rift before it closes, and use it to transport &lt;a href=\"Corruption%20Cubes\"&gt;The Cube&lt;/a&gt; to the island through lightning bolts. This process seemed to have exhausted the rift completely and forces it to close. The Cube, which the community decides th call \"Kevin\", begins to roll, printing mysterous alien symbols in the ground known as &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Areas\"&gt;Runes&lt;/a&gt;, with each surrounded by an anti-gravity dome. After rolling through Tilted Towers and destroying the brand new building that was just constructed, it reached &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt;, entering it and dissolving. Upon being fully dissolved, the lake turned purple and bouncy, with properties similar to Kevin himself.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%206\"&gt;Season 6&lt;/a&gt;.\nNew Characters: &lt;a href=\"Calamity%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Calamity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deadfire\"&gt;Deadfire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"A.I.M.\"&gt;A.I.M.&lt;/a&gt;\nDarkness Rises.\nThe Cube's matter turns solid and reforms underneath the central Loot Lake island. It breaks free, ripping the island out of the Lake and forming the floating island, suspended by a vortex. Kevin and the island start moving and visit each of The Runes, leeching energy off of them (The Runes were theorized to be methods that the cube used to collect energy for later reabsorption, corrupting their surroundings in the process). After collecting all of the energy from each rune, Kevin grows throughout the house, and once full of energy, directs the floating island to return to its beginning spot, now known as &lt;a href=\"Leaky%20Lake\"&gt;Leaky Lake&lt;/a&gt;.\n It shoots a beam of energy into the sky and starts constructing a portal, presumably to &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt; to allow an invasion. The floating island then shatters into three pieces, revealing the cube in full and starting &lt;a href=\"Fortnitemares\"&gt;Fortnitemares 2018&lt;/a&gt;. This event fractured the cube material that grew through the floating island, and blasted it around &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;The Island&lt;/a&gt;, forming &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Spawner\"&gt;Monster Spawners&lt;/a&gt;. These spawn &lt;a href=\"Cube%20Monsters\"&gt;Cube Monsters&lt;/a&gt;, soldiers of The Last Reality to distract The Loopers while the invasion is prepared.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20In-Between\"&gt;The In-Between&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Calamity%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Calamity&lt;/a&gt; leads an army of Loopers against The Cube at Leaky Lake, causing it to weaken and its outer shell to melt into a nectar-like substances which drops into the vortex in &lt;a href=\"Leaky%20Lake\"&gt;Leaky Lake&lt;/a&gt; and then into The Zero Point. This nectar-substance would be by The Last Reality as a homing beacon to Reality Zero. Eventually, Kevin explodes, and releases a tremendous amount of energy, enough to damage The Zero Point and send every Looper into &lt;a href=\"The%20In-Between\"&gt;The In-Between&lt;/a&gt;. \n They are allowed to look around for a minute, before being brought back through a &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Butterfly\"&gt;Rift Butterfly&lt;/a&gt;. The Cube also destroys the Floating Island and the Cube Monsters, and wipes away the fog and darkness. Loot Lake's center is reformed into a peaceful paradise with waterfalls and grassy areas. At the center is a small crater with grass and flowers, containing the cube fragments arranged into a stonehenge formation.\nA Mysterious Tracker.\n&lt;a href=\"A.I.M.\"&gt;A.I.M.&lt;/a&gt;, sent by &lt;a href=\"Sgt.%20Winter\"&gt;Sgt. Winter&lt;/a&gt;, lands on &lt;a href=\"Flush%20Factory\"&gt;Flush Factory&lt;/a&gt;, plants a flag, and observes the loopers in preparation for an invasion. An &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Biome\"&gt;Iceberg&lt;/a&gt;, a fragment of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt; rapidly approaches the Island, with &lt;a href=\"Expedition\"&gt;Expedition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20King%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;The Ice King&lt;/a&gt; on it.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%207\"&gt;Season 7&lt;/a&gt;.\nNew Characters: &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20King%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;The Ice King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Prisoner\"&gt;The Prisoner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sgt.%20Winter\"&gt;Sgt. Winter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lynx\"&gt;Lynx&lt;/a&gt;\nWithin the Snow.\n&lt;a href=\"Sgt.%20Winter\"&gt;Sgt. Winter&lt;/a&gt; and his army, with the Iceberg which broke off &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt;, arrive onto Athena, with &lt;a href=\"Frosty%20Flights\"&gt;Frosty Flights&lt;/a&gt; as their headquarters. They bring &lt;a href=\"X-4%20Stormwing\"&gt;X-4 Stormwings&lt;/a&gt; and set up more bases around &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;. A giant iceberg; &lt;a href=\"Polar%20Peak\"&gt;Polar Peak&lt;/a&gt; appears with a castle on the top, holding &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20King%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;The Ice King&lt;/a&gt; dormant inside, frozen inside ice.\n&lt;a href=\"Ice%20Storm\"&gt;Weather Warning&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ice begins to melt due to winter coming to an end, and it wakes up The Ice King, but also reveals a mysterious figure trapped inside ice in the castle. Ice King acquires a shard of a &lt;a href=\"Cubes\"&gt;Cube&lt;/a&gt;, and uses it to cover the entire Island with snow. The snowstorm also caused the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Cube%20Monsters\"&gt;Ice Monsters&lt;/a&gt;, due to the combination of the cube's and the Ice King's powers.\nThe Prisoner.\nThe snow slowly melts again, releasing &lt;a href=\"The%20Prisoner\"&gt;The Prisoner&lt;/a&gt; who was trapped in the castle. He begins breaking free from his chains and regaining his true form, with his final step being a ritual at Wailing Woods. This would also be the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Earthquakes%23Chapter%201\"&gt;Earthquakes&lt;/a&gt;, as foreshadowing for the &lt;a href=\"Volcano\"&gt;Volcano&lt;/a&gt;. The earthquakes created fissures in the ground, one of them destroying News HQ in &lt;a href=\"Tilted%20Towers\"&gt;Tilted Towers&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%208\"&gt;Season 8&lt;/a&gt;.\nNew Characters: &lt;a href=\"Hybrid%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Hybrids&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blackheart\"&gt;Blackheart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Master%20Key\"&gt;Master Key&lt;/a&gt;\nThe King of Fire.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Prisoner\"&gt;The Prisoner&lt;/a&gt; creates a &lt;a href=\"Volcano\"&gt;Volcano&lt;/a&gt; inside a jungle, and hatches the eggs he stole from &lt;a href=\"Polar%20Peak\"&gt;Polar Peak&lt;/a&gt; that eventually grow up to be &lt;a href=\"Hybrid%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Hybrids&lt;/a&gt;. They go after &lt;a href=\"Master%20Key\"&gt;Master Key&lt;/a&gt; for unknown reasons. The group of &lt;a href=\"Peely\"&gt;Peelys&lt;/a&gt; would then hold a &lt;a href=\"Ripening%20Ritual\"&gt;Ripening Ritual&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"They\" Return.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Government\"&gt;The Government&lt;/a&gt; set up excavation sites around the island searching for &lt;a href=\"The%20Vault\"&gt;The Vault&lt;/a&gt;, being unsuccessful in their first few excavations. A mysterious metal plate is discovered near &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt;. All the excavators move there, setting up a considerably larger site which eventually reveals the Vault in the middle.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Unvaulting%20Event\"&gt;The Unvaulting&lt;/a&gt;.\nFive &lt;a href=\"The%20Vault%23Key%20Runes\"&gt;Runes&lt;/a&gt; appear around the map, with each needing a specific task for the Loopers to do in order for them to move. After all of the runes were placed, The Vault's hatch opened, allowing Loopers to go inside. Inside the Vault, numerous &lt;a href=\"Vaulted%20Items\"&gt;Vaulted Items&lt;/a&gt; were stored inside crystal pillars. A desk with &lt;a href=\"Singularity\"&gt;Singularity's&lt;/a&gt; helmet was also inside the Vault, along with a radio and a few books. The Loopers start to crack the items' cases with their &lt;a href=\"Harvesting%20Tools\"&gt;Harvesting Tools&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"Drum%20Gun\"&gt;Drum Gun&lt;/a&gt;'s case breaking first. It was then released from the Vault, along with all the Loopers inside. \nWhile The Unvaulting was happening, The Prisoner erupts the &lt;a href=\"Volcano\"&gt;Volcano&lt;/a&gt;, sending balls of magma to &lt;a href=\"Retail%20Row\"&gt;Retail Row&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tilted%20Towers\"&gt;Tilted Towers&lt;/a&gt; which completely destroys them. &lt;a href=\"Polar%20Peak\"&gt;Polar Peak&lt;/a&gt; was also shot, creating a huge crack in the side of the iceberg. Afterwards, &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20King%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;The Ice King&lt;/a&gt; would freeze &lt;a href=\"The%20Prisoner\"&gt;The Prisoner&lt;/a&gt; underwater for all time before eventually returning to &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%209\"&gt;Season 9&lt;/a&gt;.\nNew Characters: &lt;a href=\"Singularity\"&gt;Singularity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bunker%20Jonesy\"&gt;Bunker Jonesy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer\"&gt;The Devourer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Mecha Team Leader&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt;\nBunker Days.\nDuring the Eruption, &lt;a href=\"Bunker%20Jonesy\"&gt;Jonesy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Peely\"&gt;Peely&lt;/a&gt; escape into a Bunker in &lt;a href=\"Tilted%20Towers\"&gt;Tilted Towers&lt;/a&gt;, enjoying the various activities inside. Once they went to go eat, it is revealed they have no food. Jonesy turns Peely into a &lt;a href=\"Smoothie\"&gt;Smoothie&lt;/a&gt;, and drank his juice to survive. After an unknown amount of time, &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; opens up the Bunker, and welcomes Jonesy and Peely into &lt;a href=\"Neo%20Tilted\"&gt;Neo Tilted&lt;/a&gt;.\nWelcome The Future.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Tilted%20Towers\"&gt;Tilted Towers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Retail%20Row\"&gt;Retail Row&lt;/a&gt; were destroyed, They are rebuilt as &lt;a href=\"Neo%20Tilted\"&gt;Neo Tilted&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mega%20Mall\"&gt;Mega Mall&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Vault\"&gt;The Vault&lt;/a&gt; has been overgrown, and turned into an energy source for Neo Tilted using &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt; becoming a Government base. The now-dormant Volcano has turned into &lt;a href=\"Pressure%20Plant\"&gt;Pressure Plant&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Monster.\nInside the hole in &lt;a href=\"Polar%20Peak\"&gt;Polar Peak&lt;/a&gt;, the eye of &lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer\"&gt;The Devourer&lt;/a&gt;, which later breaks out and starts destroying nearby landscape and locations, and escaping to the ocean with Polar Peak on it's back. On the other side, at &lt;a href=\"Pressure%20Plant\"&gt;Pressure Plant&lt;/a&gt;, a giant elevator is built, and parts of a giant mech are put together piece by piece, with it eventually being finished and colored, becoming the &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Mecha Team Leader&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Singularity\"&gt;Singularity&lt;/a&gt; helps build the mech while &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt; is allowed to pilot it as a chance to battle &lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer\"&gt;The Devourer&lt;/a&gt; in case it poses a threat to &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Final%20Showdown\"&gt;The Final Showdown&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer\"&gt;The Devourer&lt;/a&gt; rises from the ocean, destroying buildings with it's laser beam. It heads towards &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt; as The Mecha Team Leader activates, flying towards The Devourer. After a fight, The Devourer rips off Mecha's arm, tossing it into the ocean. It heads to &lt;a href=\"The%20Vault\"&gt;The Vault&lt;/a&gt; to reach &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, but before it could, Mecha blows The Devourer away. It then took The Zero Point out of The Vault, cracking it to get power to use against The Devourer. It then pulls out the &lt;a href=\"Statue%20Of%20Singularity\"&gt;Statue Of Singularity&lt;/a&gt; from Neo Tilted, which turns out to be a giant sword. The Devourer dashed towards Mecha as Mecha lunges, stabbing the sword into The Devourer's head, killing it. Mecha celebrated with a &lt;a href=\"Floss\"&gt;Floss&lt;/a&gt;, before flying off to &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt;. The Zero Point was left over The Vault, destabilizing more every day.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%20X\"&gt;Season X&lt;/a&gt;.\nNew Characters: &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt;\nOut of Time.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; became unstable, it released a burst of energy along with a &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Wave\"&gt;Reality Wave&lt;/a&gt;, converting &lt;a href=\"Dusty%20Divot\"&gt;Dusty Divot&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Dusty%20Depot\"&gt;Dusty Depot&lt;/a&gt;. The explosion is frozen by the arrival of &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist's&lt;/a&gt; meteor just above Dusty Depot. At the start of the season his pod was already open, meaning he was already on the Island. \n&lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Scientist takes over the grey warehouse in Dusty Depot, and turns it into his workspace. He starts building &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Beacon\"&gt;Rift Beacons&lt;/a&gt;, used to create a &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;Sideways Rift&lt;/a&gt; over a Location to replace it with it's version from an alternate universe.\nBehind the scenes, the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;IO&lt;/a&gt; manipulate &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt; into stabilizing &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, so they don't lose &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and the control they have over it. Despite being enemies, The Scientist still helps the IO, but unknown if willingly. Neither the Seven nor the IO wanted to lose the bridge, but IO left the Seven to do all the work.\n&lt;a href=\"Rift%20Zones\"&gt;Rift Zones&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Scientist's Rift Beacons create &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Zones\"&gt;Rift Zones&lt;/a&gt;, which swaps locations with alternate reality counterparts, each with it's unique rules inside. The Scientist first turns &lt;a href=\"Neo%20Tilted\"&gt;Neo Tilted&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Tilted%20Town\"&gt;Tilted Town&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mega%20Mall\"&gt;Mega Mall&lt;/a&gt; back into &lt;a href=\"Retail%20Row\"&gt;Retail Row&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20Palms\"&gt;Paradise Palms&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Moisty%20Palms\"&gt;Moisty Palms&lt;/a&gt;, Frozen Greasy Grove back into &lt;a href=\"Greasy%20Grove\"&gt;Greasy Grove&lt;/a&gt;, and the former location of the destroyed &lt;a href=\"Starry%20Suburbs%20Ruins\"&gt;Starry Suburbs&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Starry%20Suburbs\"&gt;Starry Suburbs&lt;/a&gt;. He accidentally destroys the &lt;a href=\"Sports%20Center\"&gt;Sports Center&lt;/a&gt;, and creates a crater with glitching objects. He also brings back the &lt;a href=\"Floating%20Island\"&gt;Floating Island&lt;/a&gt;, with more additions like the &lt;a href=\"Motel\"&gt;Motel&lt;/a&gt; sign and the &lt;a href=\"The%20Burger\"&gt;The Burger&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28Chapter%201%29\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; builds a Rocket at Dusty Depot, and launches it, with 6 more Rockets originating from the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Zones\"&gt;Rift Zones&lt;/a&gt;. All of them create a Rift in front of the frozen Meteor, which pushes it into the rift. A rift appears over &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt; which a Rocket emerges from, with the Meteor following behind it. All the Loopers are launched into the sky, after the initial rocket hits &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point's&lt;/a&gt; bubble. The Meteor then hits the bubble, throwing players further away. It struggles to break through, eventually crashing into The Zero Point, creating the &lt;a href=\"The%20Blackout\"&gt;Black Hole&lt;/a&gt;, which destroys the island and sucks all of its matter into it.\n[Redacted: D4].\nThe Black Hole explodes into The Zero Point once again and releases Apollo, a brand new island created from the matter of the old island within the black hole. The &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; sends in the &lt;a href=\"GHOST\"&gt;E.G.O.&lt;/a&gt; alias the [Redacted: D4] team to scout the area after they arrive at Apollo through the &lt;a href=\"Crash%20Site\"&gt;Crash Site&lt;/a&gt;. They travel the whole Island, with IO expecting \"&lt;a href=\"SHADOW\"&gt;similar embedded agents&lt;/a&gt;\" as a threat against them.\nA New World.\nAfter the Blackout, &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; reorganized into &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;, with Artemis being on the other side of Apollo. Apollo includes locations from Chapter 1, such as &lt;a href=\"Retail%20Row\"&gt;Retail Row&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Salty%20Springs\"&gt;Salty Springs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt; is still intact, and the Seven take control of Artemis leaving the IO alone on Apollo. The reforming of the Island also attracts the attention of &lt;a href=\"Galactus\"&gt;Galactus&lt;/a&gt;, who would not arrive until .\n&lt;a href=\"GHOST\"&gt;E.G.O.&lt;/a&gt; Vs. &lt;a href=\"SHADOW\"&gt;A.L.T.E.R.&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"SHADOW\"&gt;A.L.T.E.R.&lt;/a&gt;, a team of &lt;a href=\"SHADOW\"&gt;SHADOW&lt;/a&gt; reveal themselves, and go on a hunt for &lt;a href=\"Rippley%20vs%20Sludge\"&gt;Rippley&lt;/a&gt; in an operation led by &lt;a href=\"Remedy%20vs%20Toxin\"&gt;Toxin&lt;/a&gt; and an army of Sludges. &lt;a href=\"Cameo%20vs%20Chic\"&gt;Cameo&lt;/a&gt; saves Rippley in &lt;a href=\"Frenzy%20Farm\"&gt;Frenzy Farm&lt;/a&gt;. The rest of the [Redacted: D4] team locate &lt;a href=\"8-Ball%20vs%20Scratch\"&gt;Scratch&lt;/a&gt; and send 8-Ball after him. Toxin and Sludges follow E.G.O to the dam near &lt;a href=\"Hydro%2016\"&gt;Hydro 16&lt;/a&gt;, but they escape using a &lt;a href=\"Motorboat\"&gt;Motorboat&lt;/a&gt;. After the incident, &lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt; and his agents arrive on &lt;a href=\"Eye%20Land\"&gt;Eye Land&lt;/a&gt;, with the help of IO.\nNew Characters: &lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brutus\"&gt;Brutus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"TNTina\"&gt;TNTina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skye\"&gt;Skye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Meowscles\"&gt;Meowscles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"GHOST%20Henchmen\"&gt;GHOST Henchmen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"SHADOW%20Henchmen\"&gt;SHADOW Henchmen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Peely\"&gt;Agent Peely&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt;\nMasters of Espionage.\n&lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of &lt;a href=\"Midas%27%20crew\"&gt;Midas' crew&lt;/a&gt;, arrived on the Island several bases were set up. &lt;a href=\"Skye\"&gt;Skye&lt;/a&gt; is stationed at &lt;a href=\"The%20Shark\"&gt;The Shark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brutus\"&gt;Brutus&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"The%20Grotto\"&gt;The Grotto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"TNTina\"&gt;TNTina&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"The%20Rig\"&gt;The Rig&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Meowscles\"&gt;Meowscles&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"The%20Yacht\"&gt;The Yacht&lt;/a&gt;. SHADOW faction of Midas' crew also etablished their own safehouse, while some of the main bases of the crew such as The Agency and The Yacht were claimed by the GHOST faction. As time passes and the war between GHOST and SHADOW division continue, all the agents choose a side, and their locations changed with them.\n&lt;a href=\"Deadpool\"&gt;Deadpool&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Meowscles\"&gt;Meowscles&lt;/a&gt; betrays GHOST and joins SHADOW, &lt;a href=\"Contract%20Giller\"&gt;Contract Giller&lt;/a&gt; infiltrate &lt;a href=\"The%20Yacht\"&gt;The Yacht&lt;/a&gt;, and allows &lt;a href=\"Deadpool\"&gt;Deadpool&lt;/a&gt; to takeover as a GHOST agent. Members of the would then arrive at &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;.\nStorm The Agency.\nClose to the end of the season, &lt;a href=\"Renegade%20Shadow\"&gt;Renegade Shadow&lt;/a&gt; disguises as a GHOST spy and attempts to raid &lt;a href=\"The%20Agency\"&gt;The Agency&lt;/a&gt; by eliminating &lt;a href=\"GHOST%20Henchmen\"&gt;GHOST Henchmen&lt;/a&gt; and taking over The Agency for &lt;a href=\"SHADOW\"&gt;SHADOW&lt;/a&gt;. His attempt was unsuccessful.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Device%20%28event%29\"&gt;The Device&lt;/a&gt;.\nMidas builds a &lt;a href=\"Doomsday%20Device\"&gt;Doomsday Device&lt;/a&gt; under The Agency, and before fully activating it, turns into SHADOW and shows his true allegiance. After The Device is activated, it pushes back &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt;, in an attempt to destroy &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; gets sent to &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt; several times due to the use of the Device, although they are quickly sent back after each time. The Storm fights back against Midas' device, eventually being completely pushed back. The Loopers are sent to the Bridge once again, where the panicking agents of the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; can be heard, before being sent back. Upon returning, the Storm has created a massive &lt;a href=\"The%20Wall%20Of%20Water\"&gt;wall of water&lt;/a&gt;. They are sent to the Bridge one final time where they meet &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt;. Returning once more, all Loopers arrive in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Bus\"&gt;Battle Bus&lt;/a&gt; above the Wall of Water.\n\nNew Characters: &lt;a href=\"Jules\"&gt;Jules&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ocean\"&gt;Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kit\"&gt;Kit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marauders\"&gt;Marauders&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Flood.\nAfter The Device, &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; gets flooded, leaving certain locations floating over water, and some submerged. GHOST builds their main base at &lt;a href=\"The%20Fortilla\"&gt;The Fortilla&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jules\"&gt;Jules&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt;, takes over The Agency and turns it into &lt;a href=\"The%20Authority\"&gt;The Authority&lt;/a&gt;.

After consuming the first planet, Thor and Galactus came across a &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;Sideways Rift&lt;/a&gt; that led to &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt;. Galactus could sense &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point's&lt;/a&gt; energy inside, and dove after it. Thor instructed him not to, but could not stop Galactus. He dove in before Galactus to warn the inhabitants, only to be met by a group of hostile Loopers. Before he could completely succumb to the effects of the Loop, he called out to &lt;a href=\"https%3A//marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Sif_%28Earth-616%29\"&gt;Sif&lt;/a&gt;, the current guardian of the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Bifrost\"&gt;Bifrost&lt;/a&gt;, for help.\nNew Characters: &lt;a href=\"Thor\"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Stark\"&gt;Tony Stark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Galactus\"&gt;Galactus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wolverine%20Zero\"&gt;Wolverine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jennifer%20Walters\"&gt;Jennifer Walters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mystique\"&gt;Mystique&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Doom\"&gt;Doctor Doom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Groot\"&gt;Groot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Storm%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Storm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Midas\"&gt;Shadow Midas&lt;/a&gt;\nEarth's Mightiest Heroes.\nLady Sif brought Tony Stark, Wolverine, Jennifer Walters, Mystique, Doctor Doom, Groot, and Storm to the Island through the Bifrost to help defeat Galactus. She also brought &lt;a href=\"Helicarrier%2064\"&gt;Helicarrier 64&lt;/a&gt;, which is used as a base of operations, along with S.H.I.E.L.D Quinjets. &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Stark\"&gt;Tony Stark&lt;/a&gt; sets up a makeshift base in a barn and builds the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Beacon\"&gt;Rift Beacons&lt;/a&gt; to bring the entire &lt;a href=\"Stark%20Industries%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Stark Industries&lt;/a&gt; facility to &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;, along with the surrounding Upstate New York, so he would have the tools to work on a plan to defeat &lt;a href=\"Galactus\"&gt;Galactus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Doom\"&gt;Doctor Doom&lt;/a&gt; takes over &lt;a href=\"Pleasant%20Park\"&gt;Pleasant Park&lt;/a&gt; and turns it into &lt;a href=\"Doom%27s%20Domain\"&gt;Doom's Domain&lt;/a&gt;, and a group Sentinels decommissioned by &lt;a href=\"Wolverine%20Zero\"&gt;Wolverine&lt;/a&gt; appear on two mountains. Galactus also deploys his &lt;a href=\"Gorgers\"&gt;Gorgers&lt;/a&gt; to fight against Loopers and scout the island ahead of his arrival, who presently appears as a pulsating, purple star in the night sky.\nDuring , An unknown henchman performs a ritual on &lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt;'s golden chair and summons &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Midas\"&gt;Shadow Midas&lt;/a&gt;. He turns the abandoned &lt;a href=\"The%20Authority\"&gt;The Authority&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"The%20Ruins\"&gt;The Ruins&lt;/a&gt;. He brings &lt;a href=\"Ghostly%20GHOST%20Henchmen\"&gt;Ghostly GHOST Henchmen&lt;/a&gt; and break the respawn drones, turning eliminated players into &lt;a href=\"Shadows\"&gt;Shadows&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Tony%20Stark\"&gt;The Plan&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Tony%20Stark\"&gt;Tony Stark&lt;/a&gt; creates a plan by modifying several battle buses with stark equipment, and then filling them with gamma bombs, then uses &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt; to make a billion modified battle bus clones. Over the course of the season, &lt;a href=\"Galactus\"&gt;Galactus&lt;/a&gt; gets closer and closer, eventually being distincly visible in the night sky. After fading from view, &lt;a href=\"Galactus\"&gt;Galactus&lt;/a&gt; arrives on the island through Artemis and rises from the ocean into Apollo.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer%20of%20Worlds\"&gt;The Devourer of Worlds&lt;/a&gt;.\nGalactus finally commences into action, and fully rises from the ocean. He repeatedly taunts The Loopers before destroying Helicarrier 64, plunging the gigantic aircraft into the ocean. He then rips out the Zero Point from The Bridge using energy beams emitted from his hands, and attempts to absorb it. The Zero Point seemingly sensed its power being leeched on by something surrounding it, and cracked itself, condensing into a black hole and sucking Galactus and all of the loopers into The In-Between where countless battle buses are waiting for the battle.\nThe fight commences, and as The Zero Point is nearly totally exhausted by Galactus, he is tricked into consuming all of the battle buses, which detonate with the gamma cells and injure Galactus, sending him and a &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Shard\"&gt;Zero Shard&lt;/a&gt; through a rift and back to &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Amarvel%3AEarth-616\"&gt;Reality: 616&lt;/a&gt;.\n\nNew Characters: &lt;a href=\"IO%20Guards\"&gt;IO Guards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mandalorian\"&gt;Mandalorian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reese\"&gt;Reese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mancake\"&gt;Mancake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mave\"&gt;Mave&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Menace%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Menace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lexa\"&gt;Lexa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Predator\"&gt;Predator&lt;/a&gt;\nJones' Mission.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer%20of%20Worlds\"&gt;The Devourer of Worlds&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt; gets heavily damaged due to &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; being ripped out of the facility. &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt; wakes up in his Office with a call from &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt;. She orders him to stop anyone escaping the loop, and to not attract the attention of &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt;. He would not hear the latter instruction, as foreshadowing for , to not draw the attention of The Seven. He packs his &lt;a href=\"Jones%27%20Field%20Pack\"&gt;Field Pack&lt;/a&gt;, and uses the Bridge Terminal to locate the best hunters across all realities.\nA Warped World.\nThe Zero Point had stabilized back from a black hole before &lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28Chapter%201%29\"&gt;a catastrophic event&lt;/a&gt; could have destroyed the island once again, and presently levitated above the center of the island. However, despite averting disaster, the area surrounding The Zero Point was warped and turned into a desert, with scattered, solid pieces of The Zero Point called &lt;a href=\"Zero%20Point%20Crystals\"&gt;Zero Point Crystals&lt;/a&gt; lying around. Elsewhere, around the island, locations and objects from past seasons are brought to the island, including &lt;a href=\"Flush%20Factory\"&gt;Flush Factory&lt;/a&gt;, and Tilted Towers (although the latter was merged with Salty Springs to become Salty Towers). Oddly enough, these brought-back locations were in approximately the same coordinates as they were on the Chapter 1 island.\nThe IO Arrives.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; quickly settles themselves throughout the island, still having access to &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt; through their Surface Hubs. They build structures for the first 5 Hunters Jones brought at &lt;a href=\"Hunter%27s%20Haven\"&gt;Hunter's Haven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Colossal%20Coliseum\"&gt;Colossal Coliseum&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Predator\"&gt;Predator&lt;/a&gt; follows Jones to &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt; and moves to &lt;a href=\"Hunter%27s%20Haven\"&gt;Hunter's Haven&lt;/a&gt;, but makes &lt;a href=\"Stealthy%20Stronghold\"&gt;Stealthy Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; his hunting ground. \nZero Point in Danger.\nDuring his mission, Jones visits 18 Realities to bring 30 &lt;a href=\"Hunters\"&gt;Hunters&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;. His aim is to cause chaos within the Loop while the IO tries to fix &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;. Using Jones' &lt;a href=\"Portal%20Device\"&gt;Portal Device&lt;/a&gt; to visit Realities causes the Zero Point to create &lt;a href=\"Pure%20Portals\"&gt;Pure Portals&lt;/a&gt;, making it use it's energy and turning it more unstable.\nNew Characters: &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Raz\"&gt;Raz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tarana\"&gt;Tarana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jonesy%20The%20First\"&gt;Jonesy The First&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spire%20Assassin\"&gt;Spire Assassin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Batman%20Zero\"&gt;Batman Zero&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Catwoman%20Zero\"&gt;Catwoman Zero&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deathstroke%20Zero\"&gt;Deathstroke Zero&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Renegade%20Raider\"&gt;Renegade Raider&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fishstick\"&gt;Fishstick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bonehead\"&gt;Bonehead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bandolette\"&gt;Bandolette&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Voyager\"&gt;Eternal Voyager&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lex%20Luthor\"&gt;Lex Luthor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Batman%20Who%20Laughs\"&gt;The Batman Who Laughs&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Zero%20Crisis%20Finale\"&gt;Zero Crisis Finale&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith The Zero Point reaching it's final destabilization stage, Jones realized that the Order isn't doing anything about it, and takes matters into his own hands. After his access to certain files within IO was revoked, he goes rogue and flies to Apollo, ignoring &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt;'s orders. He makes his way through the chaos of the Loop, eventually getting close enough to toss his &lt;a href=\"Portal%20Device\"&gt;Portal Device&lt;/a&gt; into it. A few moments later, a meteor appears out of a rift in the sky, crashing into the sand near &lt;a href=\"Dusted%20Depot\"&gt;Dusted Depot&lt;/a&gt;. The meteor cracks, revealing another pod like &lt;a href=\"The%20Visitor\"&gt;The Visitor's&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist's&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; steps out of it, immediately attacking Jones. Jones stops the fight by offering to get him &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt; and The Sisters in exchange for the Foundation's help in stabilizing the Zero Point. The Foundation agrees, attempting to untangle the Zero Point tendrils while Jones and &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; close the new Pure Portals it creates. The Foundation is unable to untangle it, and creates &lt;a href=\"The%20Spire\"&gt;The Spire&lt;/a&gt; to contain the Zero Point's blast, sacrificing himself by sealing himself inside The Zero Point. For it to work, Jones overloads his &lt;a href=\"Portal%20Device\"&gt;Portal Device&lt;/a&gt; and throws it inside, forcing himself to become trapped in &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt;. The Spire safely contains The Zero Point inside it, allowing it to heal and realign, while at the same time cutting off The Zero Point from The Imagined Order. A Reality Wave is released, forcing the island to go wild, with the center converted from a desert into an autumn-themed biome. Animals arrive and parts of the island change, being marked by autumn zones. Throughout Season 6, The IO vanish from Reality Zero, leaving behind some IO guards to protect The Bridge from intruders.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Spire%20Quests\"&gt;The Spire Quests&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Raz\"&gt;Raz&lt;/a&gt;, a man from &lt;a href=\"Colossal%20Crops\"&gt;Colossal Crops&lt;/a&gt; wants to discover the secrets of The Spire, so he teams up with The Looper to steal an Artifact from it, which was the cube nectar which fell into the Zero Point during &lt;a href=\"Season%206\"&gt;Season 6&lt;/a&gt;. The Looper also talks to &lt;a href=\"Jonesy%20The%20First\"&gt;Jonesy The First&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tarana\"&gt;Tarana&lt;/a&gt;, learning about the corruption of The Spire. Raz betrays The Looper and uses the Artifact, corrupting him and turning him into Glyph Master Raz. A snapshot of him, prior to his corruption, is left at Colossal Crops. Glyph Master Raz takes over The Spire; formerly guarded by the &lt;a href=\"Spire%20Assassin\"&gt;Spire Assassin&lt;/a&gt;. The snapshot version of Raz is confused, not knowing what happened to him, but sensing that something went wrong with his plan. &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; eliminates Glyph Master Raz and takes The Spire Artifact away from him. But it was too late, the &lt;a href=\"Corruption%20Cubes\"&gt;Cube&lt;/a&gt;'s power in the Spire Artifact has already alerted &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Reality: NF-1935, The IO teamed up with &lt;a href=\"Lex%20Luthor\"&gt;Lex Luthor&lt;/a&gt; to manipulate &lt;a href=\"Batman%20Zero\"&gt;Batman&lt;/a&gt; into helping them regain control of the Zero Point after it had been sealed off by &lt;a href=\"The%20Spire\"&gt;The Spire&lt;/a&gt;. They open a &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;Sideways Rift&lt;/a&gt; in Gotham City and kick Batman into &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt;. After countless loop of battle royale, Batman finally escape the Loop and is able to explore the island, He teams up with a group of escaped Loopers, and then breaks into the &lt;a href=\"IO%20Hatches\"&gt;IO Hatch&lt;/a&gt;. Inside &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt; he finds the root of the Spire containing &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Voyager\"&gt;Eternal Voyager&lt;/a&gt; jumps into the uncalibrated Zero Point, and is torn to shreds. Batman sees this, and understands they need to calibrate the Zero Point before entering it. Using everyone's individual \"dimensional energy,\" they send everyone home one by one. &lt;a href=\"Deathstroke%20Zero\"&gt;Deathstroke&lt;/a&gt; sabotaged Batman and &lt;a href=\"Catwoman%20Zero\"&gt;Catwoman&lt;/a&gt;'s escape attempt, trapping them on the bridge. With just the two of them, and the equipment destroyed, they did not have enough dimensional energy to return to their reality. They are forced to travel back into the Loop using the &lt;a href=\"Portal%20Device\"&gt;Portal Device&lt;/a&gt; they stole from deathstroke to find &lt;a href=\"Rebirth%20Harley%20Quinn\"&gt;Harley Quinn&lt;/a&gt;, so they can use her added dimensional energy to return. They are successful, and return to their world. While this is happening, &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; holds a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Lex%20Luthor\"&gt;Lex Luthor&lt;/a&gt;, revealing that Slone struck a deal with him to have Batman enter and escape the loop, in exchange for opening a &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;Sideways Rift&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Adc%3ADaily_Planet\"&gt;Daily Planet&lt;/a&gt;, although this may not be the full extent of their deal.\n&lt;a href=\"Hot%20Saucers\"&gt;Hot Saucers&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Foreshadowing%20Quests\"&gt;final weeks&lt;/a&gt; of the season, UFOs began to abduct people. The IO send their agents to silence rumors of aliens spreading by people like &lt;a href=\"Mari%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;Mari&lt;/a&gt; and her radio show. One of &lt;a href=\"Downed%20Black%20Helicopter\"&gt;IO Helicopters&lt;/a&gt; is also attacked, crashing near &lt;a href=\"Hydro%2016\"&gt;Hydro 16&lt;/a&gt;. Mari broadcasts a radio channel about aliens, and talks to Island-dwellers such as &lt;a href=\"Zorgoton\"&gt;Zorgoton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Turk%20vs%20Riptide\"&gt;Turk&lt;/a&gt; about it to get their opinions. The location she is in later gets raided by the IO, and Mari does her final broadcast before .\nNew Characters: &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Joey\"&gt;Joey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kymera\"&gt;Kymera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunny\"&gt;Sunny&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maven\"&gt;Maven&lt;/a&gt;\nInvasion Begins.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt; arrives with their &lt;a href=\"The%20Mothership\"&gt;Mothership&lt;/a&gt; and destroy &lt;a href=\"The%20Spire\"&gt;The Spire&lt;/a&gt; in their attempt to absorb The Zero Point. They failed as it had moved down into The Bridge, deploying &lt;a href=\"Abductors\"&gt;Abductors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saucer\"&gt;Saucers&lt;/a&gt; in a full-out invasion against &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt;. Between Seasons 6 and 7, The IO had returned to Reality Zero, restoring The Bridge to its former status and taking back control of The Zero Point. After the invasion begins, the IO reveal themselves to the public, with &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; coming out as their leader. &lt;a href=\"Maven\"&gt;Moles&lt;/a&gt; begin to appear in the IO, relaying information to The Last Reality. Slone recruits the help of &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; for various tasks, ultimately requiring their help during .\n&lt;a href=\"Cosmic%20Summer%20Celebration\"&gt;Cosmic Summer Celebration&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe people of &lt;a href=\"Believer%20Beach\"&gt;Believer Beach&lt;/a&gt; celebrate the arrival of the aliens, including &lt;a href=\"Sunny\"&gt;Sunny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mari%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;Mari&lt;/a&gt; who spread pro-alien messages, while simultaneously spreading anti-IO propaganda.\nTakeover.\nThe IO sets up Satellite Stations across the Island, as the Last Reality sends Saucers to &lt;a href=\"Invaded%20Locations\"&gt;Invade Locations&lt;/a&gt;. The Last Reality also take over &lt;a href=\"Holly%20Hedges\"&gt;Holly Hedges&lt;/a&gt; and turns it into a &lt;a href=\"Holly%20Hatchery\"&gt;Hatchery&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Alien%20Parasites\"&gt;Alien Parasites&lt;/a&gt;. Both IO and The Last Reality come with new weapons and technology, like the &lt;a href=\"Grab-itron\"&gt;Grab-itron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pulse%20Rifle\"&gt;Pulse Rifle&lt;/a&gt;. The Last Reality begins terraforming the island to their environment, attempting to rewrite the DNA of everything to a habitat that suits them.\nThe Mothership moves towards &lt;a href=\"Slurpy%20Swamp\"&gt;Slurpy Swamp&lt;/a&gt; and opens it's hatch, pulling buildings from the ground and taking them into the abduction chamber. IO sets up &lt;a href=\"IO%20Camps\"&gt;camps&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the abduction site. After fully abducting the buildings, The Mothership moves on to &lt;a href=\"Coral%20Castle\"&gt;Coral Castle&lt;/a&gt;, leaving what was now called &lt;a href=\"Sludgy%20Swamp\"&gt;Sludgy Swamp&lt;/a&gt;. After Coral Castle is abducted too, The Looper and Slone bait The Last Reality into &lt;a href=\"Corny%20Complex\"&gt;Corny Complex&lt;/a&gt; using cat food and finish their counter attack plan.\n\nThe Foundation wakes up at &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Adc%3APrime%20Earth\"&gt;Reality: NF-1935&lt;/a&gt;, at the &lt;a href=\"Gotham%20City\"&gt;Gotham City&lt;/a&gt; harbor. He is greeted by &lt;a href=\"Batman%20Zero\"&gt;Batman&lt;/a&gt;, and tries to move past him but is stopped by his grappling hook. They fight for a brief moment, as Batman thought the Foundation was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt;, but is stopped when Foundation is surprised by Batman's knowledge of the Zero Point, allowing Batman to conclude Foundation was not part of the organization that trapped him in the Loop.\nThe Foundation explains the Seven's goal, and agrees to help Batman close the &lt;a href=\"Sideways%20Rift\"&gt;Sideways Rift&lt;/a&gt;. The Foundation is tricked by &lt;a href=\"The%20Batman%20Who%20Laughs\"&gt;The Batman Who Laughs&lt;/a&gt; who dives after the rift. The Foundation follows him into the Loop, resulting in a quick skirmish between them. During the fight The Batman Who Laughs damaged the Foundation's visor, making him susceptible to the Loop's effects. He kills The Batman Who Laughs, but he begins to panic as his visor won't be repaired before the Loop resets. &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm\"&gt;The Storm&lt;/a&gt; closes around him, but vanishes in an instant. He had escaped the Loop once more by being the last organic sentient entity in the center of the Storm as it closed.\nThe Batman Who Laughs is brought back by the Loop, now trapped inside of it. His visor, being crafted from the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//dc.fandom.com/wiki/World_Forge\"&gt;World Forge&lt;/a&gt;, protects him from the Loop's speech impeding effect. It does not however protect him from &lt;a href=\"Snapshots\"&gt;Snapshots&lt;/a&gt;, which are created soon after.\nOn the last day of Corny Complex's &lt;a href=\"Abduction\"&gt;Abduction&lt;/a&gt;, Slone prepares a group of Loopers to infiltrate &lt;a href=\"The%20Mothership\"&gt;The Mothership&lt;/a&gt; to activate the &lt;a href=\"Countermeasure%20Device\"&gt;bombs&lt;/a&gt; placed attached to the chunks of land being abducted. The Mothership starts the abduction, and all the Loopers are placed inside experiment holding cells. Slone hacks the &lt;a href=\"Alien%20Jetpack\"&gt;Alien Jetpack&lt;/a&gt; to gain remote access into the Motherships systems, and opens the holding cells. They go through a number of rooms and tunnels, until they are spotted and cornered in the Abduction Chamber Window. During the first attempt to arm the bombs, some sort of countermeasure is activated and the activation fails. The windows close and a &lt;a href=\"Rebooted%20Cube\"&gt;Corruption Cube&lt;/a&gt; rises from the floor, zapping Loopers to eliminate them. Slone weaponizes the Jetpacks and deactivates the Cube with the few remaining Loopers. The windows open again, and Slone attempts to activate them for a second time. It works, and Slone reveals that she cannot bring the Loopers back to the Island, as to not risk the cube returning as well.\nThe Loopers &lt;a href=\"Rebooted%20Cube\"&gt;Reboot the Cube&lt;/a&gt; by placing their hands on it together, and The Cube activates an elevator. The Loopers are taken to a massive chamber full of Cubes and &lt;a href=\"Abductors\"&gt;Abductors&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Cube\"&gt;Golden Cube&lt;/a&gt; being present at the very back of the room. The Mothership blows up, sending Loopers and everyone inside The Mothership flying down to &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;. Multiple &lt;a href=\"Abductors\"&gt;Abductors&lt;/a&gt; crash down to the Island, alongside a group of Corruption Cubes, the Golden Cube and the Rebooted Cube. &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; gets hit by an Abductor, passing out.\n\nNew Characters: &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%20Queen\"&gt;The Cube Queen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cube%20Assassin\"&gt;Cube Assassin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Cube\"&gt;Golden Cube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rebooted%20Cube\"&gt;Rebooted Cube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Corruption%20Cubes\"&gt;Corruption Cubes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"J.B.%20Chimpanski\"&gt;J.B. Chimpanski&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Jonesy\"&gt;Dark Jonesy&lt;/a&gt;\nIsland, Corrupted.\nAfter the Cubes landed on the Island, they corrupted the landscape around, except the Golden Cube that landed near &lt;a href=\"Holly%20Hedges\"&gt;Holly Hedges&lt;/a&gt;. Slone and a group of &lt;a href=\"IO%20Guards\"&gt;IO Guards&lt;/a&gt; form a &lt;a href=\"IO%20Convoy\"&gt;Convoy&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Destroyed%20Dish\"&gt;Destroyed Dish&lt;/a&gt;, and collect remaining Alien technology. The Golden Cube quickly awakes, and begins rolling around the Island, visiting the each &lt;a href=\"Corruption%20Cubes\"&gt;Corruption Cube&lt;/a&gt; and activating them one by one. All of the Cubes, once activated, create smaller Cubes (with the exception of the one that broke free from &lt;a href=\"Steamy%20Stacks\"&gt;Steamy Stacks&lt;/a&gt;). All cubes begin to move towards &lt;a href=\"The%20Aftermath\"&gt;The Aftermath&lt;/a&gt;, leaving a trail of corrupted land in their wake.\nAll The Cubes conjoin to form a caste-like structure called &lt;a href=\"The%20Convergence\"&gt;The Convergence&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%20Queen\"&gt;The Cube Queen&lt;/a&gt; leaves her Golden Cube and begins to hover over the structure. The Convergence grows larger every day, eventually becoming &lt;a href=\"The%20Pyramid\"&gt;The Pyramid&lt;/a&gt;. With the formation of The Pyramid, the Cube Queen releases her strongest &lt;a href=\"Cube%20Monsters\"&gt;Cube Monster&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Caretaker\"&gt;Caretakers&lt;/a&gt;.\nHope Not Lost.\n&lt;a href=\"J.B.%20Chimpanski\"&gt;J.B. Chimpanski&lt;/a&gt; founds the &lt;a href=\"War%20Effort\"&gt;War Effort&lt;/a&gt; to collect funds for Weapons to use against &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%20Queen\"&gt;The Cube Queen&lt;/a&gt;. He starts with the funding of &lt;a href=\"Turret%20Station\"&gt;Turret Stations&lt;/a&gt;, before moving on to armmaments such as the &lt;a href=\"Shockwave%20Launcher\"&gt;Shockwave Launcher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Combat%20Assault%20Rifle\"&gt;Legacy Combat Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt;. Later on he uses the funds to unvault the &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Shotgun\"&gt;Combat Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flint-Knock%20Pistol\"&gt;Flint-Knock Pistol&lt;/a&gt;. In a final funding campaign, he brings two &lt;a href=\"Salvaged%20B.R.U.T.E.\"&gt;Salvaged B.R.U.T.E.&lt;/a&gt;s to the fight. One at &lt;a href=\"Corny%20Crops\"&gt;Corny Crops&lt;/a&gt;, and the other at &lt;a href=\"Pleasant%20Park\"&gt;Pleasant Park&lt;/a&gt;. As a base, the &lt;a href=\"Guava%20Fort\"&gt;Guava Fort&lt;/a&gt; is constructed to protect them and prepare an attack. Slone and her Convoy reach &lt;a href=\"%2A%2AREDACTED%2A%2A\"&gt;**REDACTED**&lt;/a&gt;, opening it and finally revealing the &lt;a href=\"IO%20Staging%20Facility\"&gt;IO Staging Facility&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28Chapter%202%29\"&gt;The End - Chapter 2 Finale&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Rebooted%20Cube\"&gt;Rebooted Cube&lt;/a&gt; teleports to the Guava fort to assist The Loopers against the &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%20Queen\"&gt;The Cube Queen&lt;/a&gt;, as her onslaught was about to begin. She gathers her power to open a Rift to The Last Reality, with the &lt;a href=\"The%20Cube%27s%20Cradle\"&gt;Cube's Cradle&lt;/a&gt; in view. The Golden Motherships send out &lt;a href=\"Saucer\"&gt;Saucers&lt;/a&gt; that attack The Loopers, but The Rebooted Cube protects them with it's shield. Golden &lt;a href=\"Abductors\"&gt;Abductors&lt;/a&gt; start destroying Locations across the Island, with one targeting the Rebooted Cube, leaving The Loopers defenseless. Meanwhile in &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, Slone and &lt;a href=\"Gunnar\"&gt;Gunnar&lt;/a&gt; being interrogating &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt;, until The Foundation breaks in to save him. They run to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; chamber, and the Foundation tears down one of the panels as cover. The Foundation tells Jones to disable the Gyro System, and the Island begins to flip. \n &lt;a href=\"The%20Visitor\"&gt;The Visitor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; arrive at &lt;a href=\"Guava%20Fort\"&gt;Guava Fort&lt;/a&gt;, rescuing The Loopers. The Scientist takes them inside The Bridge through a &lt;a href=\"IO%20Hatches\"&gt;Hatch&lt;/a&gt;. They run through the bridge as the Island rotates more and more, eventually reaching the Zero Point chamber to meet up with Jones and The Foundation. A Caretaker slams down on the glass ceiling, cracking it. The Caretaker slams down two more times, breaking it and flooding the room. The Looper floats up into the ocean, witnessing &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; flipping over to &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;. The Cube Queen comes in contact with water, and is defeated before rifting away. The portal closes, stopping the invasion of The Last Reality. The Island fully flips, causing a massive tidal wave that knocks the Looper out, beginning the &lt;a href=\"Drift%20To%20Artemis\"&gt;Drift To Artemis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Flipside.\nThe Looper wakes up at &lt;a href=\"Looper%20Landing\"&gt;Looper Landing&lt;/a&gt;, finding the Foundation and a few other Loopers gathered around a campfire. The Foundation explains that with the IO exploiting the Zero Point, they will never be safe from threats such as The Last Reality, and the whole &lt;a href=\"The%20Omniverse\"&gt;Omniverse&lt;/a&gt; is in danger as long as they are in control. He asks for the Loopers' help, explaining that if they succeed, they can all go home.\n&lt;a href=\"Earthquakes\"&gt;Seismic Activities&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe IO quickly start drilling onto Artemis, and reach the surface through 5 &lt;a href=\"Mole%20Teams\"&gt;Mole Teams&lt;/a&gt;. They take a cavern inside a mountain and convert it into &lt;a href=\"Covert%20Cavern\"&gt;Covert Cavern&lt;/a&gt; a stronghold for the IO. The &lt;a href=\"Earthquakes\"&gt;Big Drill&lt;/a&gt; begins drilling in the direction of &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, the home of the seven, leaving sinkholes in its wake. &lt;a href=\"IO%20Patrol\"&gt;IO Patrol cars&lt;/a&gt; also drive around the Island, attacking anyone they come across.\nWithout You.\nThe Looper secretly listens to the &lt;a href=\"Audio%20Log\"&gt;Seven Secure Broadcast Channel&lt;/a&gt;, learning that &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; is attempting to get the help of &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt; by having her return to the Island. The Scientist learns of the Looper listening in, and welcomes it.

IO's latest movement were spotted near &lt;a href=\"Dispatch%20Depot\"&gt;Dispatch Depot&lt;/a&gt;. weeks later. &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt; detected golden energy fluctuations in multiple spots around &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt;. Soon the Imagined Order built &lt;a href=\"The%20Collider\"&gt;The Collider&lt;/a&gt;, a device capable of detonating &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; and destroy everything in &lt;a href=\"The%20Loop\"&gt;The Loop&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Visitor\"&gt;The Visitor&lt;/a&gt; comes up with a plan to stop &lt;a href=\"The%20Collider\"&gt;The Collider&lt;/a&gt; by using &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Mecha Team Leader&lt;/a&gt; that was left on &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; suggests that going to &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt; would be risky, but &lt;a href=\"Spider-Man%20Zero\"&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/a&gt; has the idea to call heroes from his reality to help them, specifically &lt;a href=\"Thor\"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Storm%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Storm&lt;/a&gt; with their abilities to manipulate the weather. &lt;a href=\"The%20Origin\"&gt;The Origin&lt;/a&gt; tasks the group heading to to retrieve &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Shard\"&gt;The Zero Shard&lt;/a&gt;.

Jones guides everyone through &lt;a href=\"The%20Bridge\"&gt;The Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, until he is distracted when he finds his office, and takes a picture of his late family with them. When they reach &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, they are stopped by &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gunnar\"&gt;Gunnar&lt;/a&gt;. Jones opens a Zero Point portal to &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Amarvel%3AEarth%20616\"&gt;Reality: 616&lt;/a&gt;, and he, Spider-Man, and The Imagined enter. On Slone's command, Gunnar strikes The Foundation through the ceiling. With her enemies out of the picture, Slone ignores the others with the little time they have left.\n&lt;a href=\"Spider-Man%20Zero\"&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Imagined\"&gt;The Imagined&lt;/a&gt; arrive in &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Amarvel%3AEarth%20616\"&gt;Reality: 616&lt;/a&gt;, and they quickly send the Avengers to the &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt; to help the resistance. They head to fetch &lt;a href=\"Wolverine%20Zero\"&gt;Wolverine&lt;/a&gt; to help track the &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Shard\"&gt;The Zero Shard&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Doom\"&gt;Doctor Doom&lt;/a&gt; is chosen by the inner circle of the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; to join them as a valued addition and &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt; is able to recruit him.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Imagined\"&gt;The Imagined&lt;/a&gt; is able to track &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Shard\"&gt;The Zero Shard&lt;/a&gt; at Mena Ngai, Wakanda. After a battle against the Wakandans, the princess of Wakanda, &lt;a href=\"Shuri\"&gt;Shuri&lt;/a&gt;, quickly dispatches the fight and welcomes the group into Wakanda. Although The Imagined's tech is not able to trace down the exact location of the Zero Shard due to Wakanda's Vibranium interfering, Wolverine's scent determines that The Zero Shard was no longer there, and the smell of lizards remained. When Shuri leads the group to Serpent Valley, they discover a base guarded by &lt;a href=\"Hybrid%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Hybrids&lt;/a&gt;. As the group battles the lizard ninjas, the base is destroyed and they lose the trail for the Zero Shard. &lt;a href=\"Spider-Man%20Zero\"&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/a&gt; suggests heading to the Savage Land to find Stegron the Dinosaur Man, who is most likely responsible for taking the Zero Shard.\nThe Foundation, Scientist, Iron Man arrives on &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt; safely with help of &lt;a href=\"Thor\"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Storm%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Storm&lt;/a&gt;'s weather calming abilities. The group finds the broken &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Mecha Team Leader&lt;/a&gt; lying on the icy surface with &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt; alive in the mech. The Paradigm is awaken from stasis, and attempts to convince &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; that she is not a traitor, as her reason for siding with the IO during &lt;a href=\"The%20Final%20Showdown\"&gt;The Final Showdown&lt;/a&gt; was to prevent them from building a doomsday device that could destroy the entire island along with &lt;a href=\"The%20Devourer\"&gt;The Devourer&lt;/a&gt;. She goes on to explain that their plan to repair to the mech would not work unless they had a power source, unknowing of\nBack in Earth 616, &lt;a href=\"Spider-Man%20Zero\"&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Imagined\"&gt;The Imagined&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wolverine%20Zero\"&gt;Wolverine&lt;/a&gt;, and Shuri travel to the Savage Land, where they manage to find more &lt;a href=\"Hybrid%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Hybrids&lt;/a&gt;. After defeating them all, the group camp for the night. The Imagined explains her relationship to &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt; to Wolverine as Jones explains his past with the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt; to Spider-Man and how he worked with them to ensure his family's safety, but was never able to rest with them when they all passed and he remained immortal. The next day, Wolverine and Shuri tracked the Hybrids to a lab in the Savage Land, where they find Stegron and primal creations of the High Evolutionary using the power of &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Shard\"&gt;The Zero Shard&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe group battles the High Evolutionary and Stegron as a distraction for Spider-Man to break into the lab, only to discover that leading the group to the lab and battling the High Evolutionary was &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Doom\"&gt;Doctor Doom's&lt;/a&gt; plan to steal &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Shard\"&gt;The Zero Shard&lt;/a&gt; himself using the Hybrids as his minions. As Doctor Doom uses the Zero Shard to escape, the battle against the High Evolutionary ends, as he only wanted to defend the Zero Shard. The High Evolutionary informs the group that Doctor Doom traveled to &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Zero\"&gt;Reality Zero&lt;/a&gt;, and the group quickly use Jones' &lt;a href=\"Portal%20Device\"&gt;Portal Device&lt;/a&gt; to chase after him.\nThe group track &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Doom\"&gt;Doctor Doom&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt;, where they find a castle trapping &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20King%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;The Ice King&lt;/a&gt; and several of the powerful items he collected in ice. &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt; proceeds to become colder despite &lt;a href=\"Thor\"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Storm%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Storm's&lt;/a&gt; efforts. &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Doom\"&gt;Doctor Doom&lt;/a&gt; appears and battles them using &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Shard\"&gt;The Zero Shard&lt;/a&gt; and many of the powerful items in the castle. Despite his efforts, &lt;a href=\"Spider-Man%20Zero\"&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/a&gt; is able to retrieve &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Shard\"&gt;The Zero Shard&lt;/a&gt; and get it to the &lt;a href=\"Mecha%20Team%20Leader\"&gt;Mecha&lt;/a&gt;, fully repaired but requiring a power source. With &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Shard\"&gt;The Zero Shard&lt;/a&gt;, the Mecha is repaired and &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Doom\"&gt;Doctor Doom&lt;/a&gt; flees to the Island. The Mecha retrieves the group on the ground, destroys &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20King\"&gt;The Ice King's&lt;/a&gt; castle, and prepares to travel to the Island.\n&lt;a href=\"Collision\"&gt;Collision&lt;/a&gt; /.\nOn &lt;a href=\"The%20Ice%20Moon\"&gt;The Ice Moon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Origin\"&gt;The Origin&lt;/a&gt; gave the Loopers a mission briefing. &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt; then enters, and initiates Mecha launch sequence, with the Loopers entering the battle stations. The Mecha heads for the Island. It lands at &lt;a href=\"Synapse%20Station\"&gt;Synapse Station&lt;/a&gt;, only to be greeted by battalions of the &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt;'s tanks. The Mecha slowly walk head towards &lt;a href=\"The%20Collider\"&gt;The Collider&lt;/a&gt; while fighting off the IO. The Mecha is hit by a barrage of missiles coming from &lt;a href=\"IO%20Airships\"&gt;IO Airships&lt;/a&gt;, heavily damaging it. &lt;a href=\"Peely\"&gt;Peely&lt;/a&gt; arrives in a &lt;a href=\"Slurp\"&gt;Slurp&lt;/a&gt; truck and heal Mecha with it. \nThe Mecha pulls out its &lt;a href=\"Light%20Blade\"&gt;Light Blade&lt;/a&gt;, slashing through the remaining IO Airships. After the final IO vehicles have been destroyed, The Paradigm diverts all power to the Light Blade, and prepares to destroy the Collider. Before this can happen, an underground explosion occurs, and the Mecha falls into the ground below. The Paradigm and the Loopers are ejected from the Mecha.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; has been exposed and the Collider is forcing it to explode. Jones comes to assist the Mecha crew. &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; arrives in a tank, and Jones begins leading the Loopers towards Slone, while the Paradigm attempts to get the Mecha back online. &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation\"&gt;The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; arrives and eliminates several &lt;a href=\"IO%20Guards\"&gt;IO Guards&lt;/a&gt;. The Collider pulls &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; towards the bottom of the Collider, shifting realities along the way.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt; joins the battle on the collider upper levels and fight against his daughters. Though Geno doesn't want to kill them, The Imagined sacrifices herself and falls into The Zero Point alongside Geno. Geno seemingly unharmed, angrily commands the IO to wipe these failures out of existence before entering the Zero Point.\nThe Paradigm manages to get the Mecha back online, and as Jones is distracting Slone with a speech, she crushes Slone and her tank with the Mecha's fist, destroying part of the bridge.\nThe Paradigm then begins to lift the Loopers, Jones, and The Foundation upwards towards the top of the Collider, with the latter two jumping into the Zero Point when it focuses on &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt;. The Loopers then destroy the crystal detonators, and the Zero Point falls back below. The Paradigm protects the Loopers as the Collider collapses.\nMeanwhile, Jones and the Foundation fist bump as they enter Geno's reality. They get to see &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Imagined\"&gt;The Imagined&lt;/a&gt; slowly discorporate, getting scattered across The Omniverse. Geno's remants travel through multiple Realities, winding up at a singular spot and reforming Geno.\n\nVibin'.\nAfter The defeat of The Imagined Order with the destruction of The Collider, an island-wide celebration of The Seven's victory begins. Former IO facilities are vandalized, with with the former IO headquarters, Command Cavern, being transformed into Rave Cave. &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; is now exposed and underneath The Glow, surrounded by debris from The Collider. It forms The &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Tree\"&gt;Reality Tree&lt;/a&gt;, which then creates the &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Falls\"&gt;Reality Falls&lt;/a&gt; biome on the island. A &lt;a href=\"Klombo\"&gt;Klombo&lt;/a&gt; can be found \"dead\" near Loot Lake, but Haven reports Klombo footprints indicating that the species is still alive.\nReality Bloom.\nThe Reality Tree grows its roots towards &lt;a href=\"Logjam%20Lumberyard\"&gt;Logjam Lumberyard&lt;/a&gt;, creating a small tree from its roots which later grew into a Reality Bloom. This turned Logjam Lumberyard into &lt;a href=\"Logjam%20Lotus\"&gt;Logjam Lotus&lt;/a&gt;, a location that changes its theme with each Loop. Roots also grew towards Butter Barn, Tumbledown Temple. It also changed other locations such as &lt;a href=\"Sleepy%20Shrubs\"&gt;Sleepy Shrubs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Condo%20Canyon\"&gt;Condo Canyon&lt;/a&gt;, and even brought back &lt;a href=\"Lazy%20Lagoon\"&gt;Lazy Lagoon&lt;/a&gt;, replacing &lt;a href=\"The%20Daily%20Bugle\"&gt;The Daily Bugle&lt;/a&gt;.\nEverything's My Fault.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; started bringing in a lot of powerful artifacts from many realities in an attempts to warn everyone on the island of the upcoming danger. &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt; received reports that some &lt;a href=\"Loopers\"&gt;Loopers&lt;/a&gt; on the island and some members of &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt; randomly disappear. \nParadise.\nThe remaining members of the Seven attempted to investigate. As this is all happening, strange chrome substances are spreading across the island, consuming &lt;a href=\"The%20Origin\"&gt;The Origin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt; escapes to Reality: 659. &lt;a href=\"The%20Herald\"&gt;The Herald&lt;/a&gt; of the Last Reality arrives after watching over Reality Zero during of Chapter 3: Season 3 and is responsible for causing the chrome to spread. She sets up her &lt;a href=\"Herald%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Herald's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; at the former Sanctuary.\nNo Sweat's Policies.\nAs Chrome spreads throughout Artemis &lt;a href=\"No%20Sweat%20Insurance\"&gt;No Sweat Insurance&lt;/a&gt; tries to save buildings from being affected by the Chrome. many buildings were lifted by No Sweat Insurance to become Cloudy Condos. Their headquarters at Tilted Towers were also lifted. As Chrome spreads and affects Coney Crossroads and Sleepy Sound, No Sweat Insurance saves the restauants from those locatons by lifting them off the ground. \nAn IO Airship over Rave Cave was taken by the Loopers and becomes &lt;a href=\"The%20Flairship\"&gt;The Flairship&lt;/a&gt;. It is being used to rescue residents of the island from Chrome spread as the airship flies around the island and stops at major locations. \nHerald of the Nothing.\nThe Paradigm contacts Jones to find a way to stop the arrival of &lt;a href=\"The%20Nothing\"&gt;The Nothing&lt;/a&gt;. She then commands the Looper to investigate the Reality Tree and Roots. After the Looper investigates the Reality Tree, the Looper collects Chrome samples and sends them to the The Paradigm to perform an experiment on Chrome spread. Battle Plans written by The Origin were obtained by the Looper. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Bytes\"&gt;Bytes&lt;/a&gt; was chosen by the Nothing itself to be warrior for The Last Reality. \n&lt;a href=\"Fracture\"&gt;Fracture&lt;/a&gt; - Chapter 3 Finale.\nA group of loopers on the Island build a stronghold on the top of the &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Tree\"&gt;Reality Tree&lt;/a&gt; as a final defense against the power of &lt;a href=\"The%20Herald\"&gt;The Herald&lt;/a&gt;. Several Chrome Vortexes appear, spreading the &lt;a href=\"Chrome\"&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt; across the entire Island. A final Chrome Vortex forms near the Reality Tree, along with &lt;a href=\"The%20Herald\"&gt;The Herald&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the efforts of the loopers to attempt to destroy The Herald, she forms a massive body made of Chrome and fuses with the &lt;a href=\"Reality%20Tree\"&gt;Reality Tree&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in her sacrificing herself, but leading to the nearly complete destruction of both &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;, excluding the &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; finds themselves in space surrounded by several chunks of land remaining after the fracture of the Island. &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, however, manages to tether onto pieces of land, as well as the Looper, and pull them all in to begin the reconstruction of a new island. The loopers begin exploring the lands and completing tasks to collect &lt;a href=\"Zero%20Fragment\"&gt;Zero Fragments&lt;/a&gt; to restore enough power to the Zero Point to pull in more pieces of the island and eventually initiate Zero Fusion. &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; begins to take pieces of land and characters from different realities, including where &lt;a href=\"The%20Paradigm\"&gt;The Paradigm&lt;/a&gt; was. With enough land, the Zero Point fuses all the land together, creating the new &lt;a href=\"Asteria\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Oathbound%20Quests\"&gt;Oathbound Quests&lt;/a&gt;.\nOut of the pieces of land that were pulled in to fuse into the new &lt;a href=\"Asteria\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt;, one of the locations was &lt;a href=\"The%20Citadel\"&gt;The Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, a medieval castle from another reality ruled by &lt;a href=\"Oathbound\"&gt;Oathbound&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; takes orders from &lt;a href=\"AMIE\"&gt;AMIE&lt;/a&gt; as they discover more about the Island, as well as Oathbound. The kingdom's power source is a refined material mined from a quarry called &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Slabs\"&gt;Shattered Slabs&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Kinetic%20Ore\"&gt;Kinetic Ore&lt;/a&gt;. When refined, the material becomes an extremely powerful energy source that is used in the fuel, weapons, and items of the &lt;a href=\"Oathbound\"&gt;Oathbound&lt;/a&gt;, a material never before seen on the Island before. Several &lt;a href=\"Characters%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;Characters&lt;/a&gt; and locations on the Island have formed an alliance, swearing an oath that bounds them to the kingdom, becoming the earliest version of the nearly perfected &lt;a href=\"Imagined%20Order\"&gt;Imagined Order&lt;/a&gt;. The kingdom is ruled by &lt;a href=\"The%20Ageless\"&gt;The Ageless&lt;/a&gt;, a young &lt;a href=\"Snapshots\"&gt;Snapshot&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Geno\"&gt;Geno&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Rift%20Gate\"&gt;Rift Gate&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Rift%20Warden%20Stellan\"&gt;Rift Warden Stellan&lt;/a&gt; has been tasked by the Ageless Champion to create a &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Gate\"&gt;Rift Gate&lt;/a&gt;, a bridge to travels realities. He then asks for &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; help and later explain that the Rift Gate is Ageless Champion's dearest wish but also that he has his own reason to built it. After further help from The Looper, he reveals something he told to no one: the existence of a being, a \"\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Shapeless%20Man\"&gt;Shapeless Man&lt;/a&gt;\"\" who always imagined a world of perfect order and explains that it's necessary to finish the Rift Gate or else there will be terrible consequences. &lt;a href=\"AMIE\"&gt;AMIE&lt;/a&gt;'s test subjects sent through test rifts encountered &lt;a href=\"The%20Nothing\"&gt;The Nothing&lt;/a&gt; sculpting &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; into something new. The test subjects returned to AMIE corrupted with new forms. Operation Rescue the Scientist begins and AMIE is planning to use Stellan's Rift Gate to get to the Scientist.\nRift Sabotage.\nStellan activates the Rift Gate using the unstable energy from the Kinetic Ore. but someone sabotaged the gate and manipulated the coordinates causing it to overload and explode. The gate is destroyed, the sky is torn and &lt;a href=\"The%20Shapeless%20Man\"&gt;The Shapeless Man&lt;/a&gt; disappeared. Stellan finds a prophecy from exiled sages of thee Oathbound. The texts prophesize a... \"a beautiful monster, enabled by the hubris of a champion.\" and wonders if \"silence\" itself is the prophecy. Stellan thanked us for assisting him in making of the Rift Gate and and bid farewell. Later, &lt;a href=\"Evie\"&gt;Evie&lt;/a&gt; received &lt;a href=\"Cipher%20Quests\"&gt;transmissions&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Peace%20Syndicate\"&gt;Peace Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; that said \"It is time for us to come to you.\"\nThe season started with several futuristic buildings and small islands being rifted onto the island. Faulty Splits is crushed, and in its place &lt;a href=\"MEGA%20City\"&gt;MEGA City&lt;/a&gt; now stands tall, with a new biome forming on the landmass that got rifted in.\n&lt;a href=\"Syndicate%20Quests\"&gt;Syndicate Quests&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Looper is recruited into the &lt;a href=\"Peace%20Syndicate\"&gt;Peace Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; and tasked to find the saboteur who's been trying to start a war between the syndicates by messing with the Peace Syndicate and pinning blame on other syndicates. While the Looper is on their way to check Peace Syndicate computers, they encounters a suspicious man named &lt;a href=\"Triarch%20Nox\"&gt;Triarch Nox&lt;/a&gt; near the computer. The man told the looper \"I'd advise staying away from that terminal...\" After checking the computer and find out that the files on Army of &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;The Last Reality&lt;/a&gt; have been corrupted. Triarch Nox tries to take out The Looper, but fails. The Peace Syndicate unites with the &lt;a href=\"River%20Guard\"&gt;River Guard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Clan\"&gt;Fox Clan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Luminaries\"&gt;The Luminaries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Unseen\"&gt;The Unseen&lt;/a&gt; to search for the saboteur. In the end, everyone becomes friends and the problem is solved.\nThe Rumbles.\nLarge cracks and fractures originating from the impact of &lt;a href=\"MEGA%20City\"&gt;MEGA City&lt;/a&gt; have appeared across the island followed by multiple &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Earthquakes%23Chapter%204\"&gt;Earthquakes&lt;/a&gt;. Biomes begins to split as the mysterious tree roots rises from the cracks.\n\nWilds.\nThe central part of the Island collapsed, revealing an ancient jungle below. &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; is exposed but petrified and constantly groaning. &lt;a href=\"Optimus%20Prime\"&gt;Optimus Prime&lt;/a&gt; hacked the radio across the island to warn everyone that \"This reality is doomed to collapse, but hope is not yet lost.\"\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Apparatus\"&gt;The Apparatus&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Slone\"&gt;Doctor Slone&lt;/a&gt; is finally freed from the underground after the surface of Asteria collapsed. She then began to study the jungle and the ruins of &lt;a href=\"The%20Ancients\"&gt;The Ancients&lt;/a&gt; civilization that inhabited it. While locked up in the Jungle she recorded several &lt;a href=\"Audio%20Recorder\"&gt;audio logs&lt;/a&gt; of her findings about the ruins and the ancient civilization. She finds &lt;a href=\"The%20Apparatus\"&gt;The Apparatus&lt;/a&gt; and plans to fix it up. Research in the Rumble Ruins reveals several murals, including one concerning Optimus Prime and another a mysterious silhouette. &lt;a href=\"Optimus%20Prime\"&gt;Optimus Prime&lt;/a&gt; later contacted Slone and explained the situation to her, while revealing the procedure to follow, he then left a message on the Rumble Ruins murals to tell everyone to study and find the secret hidden among the stars, to seek answers from the \"&lt;a href=\"Black%20Hole%20%28physical%20object%29\"&gt;starless void&lt;/a&gt;\". He later send other radio messages concerning the clues left by the Ancients to study the stars, before leaving them a final cryptic message \"the key to your future lie in the past\". \n&lt;a href=\"The%20Eclipse\"&gt;The Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;.\nSlone reveal to someone through her Audio Recorder that &lt;a href=\"Optimus%20Prime\"&gt;Optimus Prime&lt;/a&gt; told her a way to save everyone. After deciphering the glyphs, Slone realized that they predicted an &lt;a href=\"The%20Eclipse\"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;, but it didn't match the astrological data. However, her long-range cosmic scans revealed the presence of a signal, an unnatural cosmic event that she recognizes, which is coming our way with intent.\nShe determined that the ancient people couldn't predict this eons ago, unless it had happened before.\nAfter the repair and installation of The Apparatus, it was revealed not to be a telescope, but a Stellar projector, which served as a countdown before the fateful arrival of the being responsible for the Eclipse. At the same time the murals of rumble ruins began to glow.\nHer Audio Recorders turns out to be addressed to &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Jones\"&gt;Agent Jones&lt;/a&gt;, whom she reluctantly asks for help for a mission.\nLast Resort.\nThe time traveling vampire and the wealthy leader of &lt;a href=\"Eclipse\"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kado%20Thorne\"&gt;Kado Thorne&lt;/a&gt; finally arrived as the Glyphs and the Apparatus announced it. He made Island his home, draining the Island's wealth and treasures to fund opulent properties: &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Suites\"&gt;Sanguine Suites&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Relentless%20Retreat\"&gt;Relentless Retreat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Eclipsed%20Estate\"&gt;Eclipsed Estate&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Doctor Slone launches heist operations to steal Thorne's time machine whose existence Optimus had revealed to her from deep under Thorne's estate, this seems linked to her plan and the mission she plans to entrust to Jones.\nTime Machine Heist.\nSlone hires &lt;a href=\"Nolan%20Chance\"&gt;Nolan Chance&lt;/a&gt; to steal the &lt;a href=\"Rift\"&gt;Rift&lt;/a&gt;-powered &lt;a href=\"Time%20Machine\"&gt;Time Machine&lt;/a&gt; from Kado Thorne. With the help of &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;, Nolan manages to recruit the members of his former Heist Crew for the heist: &lt;a href=\"Antonia\"&gt;Antonia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Piper%20Pace\"&gt;Piper Pace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fish%20Thicc\"&gt;Fish Thicc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mae\"&gt;Mae&lt;/a&gt; as well as a new recruit: &lt;a href=\"Khaby%20Lame\"&gt;Khaby Lame&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; also returned to the Island, reluctantly helping Slone with her plans.\nWhile Thorne came out of the time machine after his journey back to \"2020 03 25\" to get Oro's head for his collection, the Heist Crew tried to rob his vault. But after discovering the intruders in his estate, he transformed into his Revenant Form and tried to kill them, forcing the crew to flee. \nThe Eclipse Begins.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Eclipse\"&gt;The Eclipse&lt;/a&gt; began with a permanent Super Blood Moon and Solar Eclipses caused by Thorne's psionics powers, as predicted by &lt;a href=\"The%20Apparatus\"&gt;The Apparatus&lt;/a&gt;. Around this time, &lt;a href=\"Shimmerdusk\"&gt;Shimmerdusk&lt;/a&gt; arrives on the Island to continue her hunt of Kado Thorne.\nAfter the Heist Crew's failure to steal the time machine, Kado Thorne remained in his Revenant form to protect his it himself as the vaults doors were no longer functional. He also established his next target, \"2018 07 12\" the period of &lt;a href=\"Season%205\"&gt;Season 5&lt;/a&gt;, when Athena Island undergoes the World Collide. However his plan appeared not to be about obtaining items for his collection, but something else as yet unrevealed. \nLater, the Heist Crew managed to steal his machine, and take it to &lt;a href=\"The%20Getaway%20%28Landmark%29\"&gt;their base&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the machine stolen, &lt;a href=\"Shimmerdusk\"&gt;Shimmerdusk&lt;/a&gt; was free to make her move on Thorne. Throughout the &lt;a href=\"Fortnitemares%202023%20Quests\"&gt;Fortnitemares 2023 Quests&lt;/a&gt;, she enlists the help of The Looper to prepare. She has them stock up on ammo, kill Thorne's Guards, smash his valuables, etc etc. After weeks of preparing, she decides that they are ready and they go to confront the vampire, to eliminate him, which was successful. With Thorne dead, she declares: \"It is done. This revenant will no longer prey across time and space.\"\nWith the machine in &lt;a href=\"Slone\"&gt;Slone&lt;/a&gt;'s hands, they begin testing it, bringing objects from \"&lt;a href=\"Season%205\"&gt;2018 07 12&lt;/a&gt;\" to the present. Once it is fully tested and ready for use, Slone sends &lt;a href=\"Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; into the past for a mission. Indeed, since the Zero Point of the present was unusable because it was petrified, Optimus had guided Slone to send someone in the past, in order to use the Blackhole which had previously created Apollo and Artemis and to modify it for this time to generate a Big Bang in order to create new Realities, without changing the future. This would allow the inhabitants of Asteria to escape before Asteria collapse.\nWorlds Collide.\n&lt;a href=\"Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; time travels back to the for his extraction mission: allowing inhabitant of Reality Zero to escape from Asteria by creating new Realities where they could take refuge by acting on The Black Hole. Jones and his &lt;a href=\"Time%20Machine\"&gt;Time Machine&lt;/a&gt; landed in &lt;a href=\"Pleasant%20Park\"&gt;Pleasant Park&lt;/a&gt;. However, intentionally or not, Thorne's multiple time travels from the the future in this period and before and even before have created an alternative timeline, so a new reality parallel to Reality Zero:\nDarkness Rises.\nDuring period of this new timeline, the changes caused the absence of &lt;a href=\"The%20Butterfly%20Event\"&gt;The Butterfly Event&lt;/a&gt; as Kevin never appeared in the desert and never placed runes, it didn't have enough energy to attack the Island and therefore the Loopers never tried to destroy it. &lt;a href=\"Corruption%20Cubes\"&gt;Kevin the Cube&lt;/a&gt; is now alive and floating above &lt;a href=\"The%20Vault\"&gt;The Vault&lt;/a&gt;. While Jones gradually makes his way to Dusty Divot, but first has to recover his trailer that fell into Loot Lake after an accident, someone starts to prepare for the arrival of &lt;a href=\"The%20Scientist\"&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt; by turning &lt;a href=\"Dusty%20Divot\"&gt;Dusty Divot&lt;/a&gt;'s diner into a rocket construction site.\nChill and Treasure.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Kado%20Thorne\"&gt;Thorne&lt;/a&gt;'s previous time travels created this alternative timeline, a very reduced version of the Iceberg arrived on the Island. The absence of Polar Peak and all that hid caused the non existence of the war between The Ice King and The Prisoner as well as the battle against The Devourer from this timeline's story. Fate of Characters such as The Ice King, The Prisoner, Hybrids and The Devourer in this reality is therefore unknown. The &lt;a href=\"Scallywags%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Scallywags&lt;/a&gt; also arrived earlier and due to the various changes but they were unable to dock their ship to create Lazy Lagoon. They also established their Camps in different locations than in the Original Timeline. While all of this happened, &lt;a href=\"Corruption%20Cubes\"&gt;Kevin the Cube&lt;/a&gt; is now trying to extract &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; out of the Vault, while construction of the Rocket is almost finished at Dusty Divot, with Jones arriving with the Time Machine.\nBlast Off!\nDue to the timeline's alterations, &lt;a href=\"The%20Final%20Showdown\"&gt;The Final Showdown&lt;/a&gt; never occurred, instead &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; was extracted out of &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt;, pulled right below &lt;a href=\"Corruption%20Cubes\"&gt;Kevin the Cube&lt;/a&gt; which was trying to absorb its energy which caused the Scientist's Meteor to return once again. As &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; was never cracked or unstable, &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt; never created any &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Beacon\"&gt;Rift Beacons&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Rift%20Zones\"&gt;Rift Zones&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt; with the help of &lt;a href=\"Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; quickly finishes &lt;a href=\"The%20Rocket\"&gt;The Rocket&lt;/a&gt; and tape the &lt;a href=\"Time%20Machine\"&gt;Time Machine&lt;/a&gt; on it as the final preparation for Jones' mission.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Bang\"&gt;The Big Bang&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe rocket begins to take off from &lt;a href=\"Dusty%20Divot\"&gt;Dusty Divot&lt;/a&gt;. The energy from the time machine begins to make the rocket malfunction and transform it into several random objects, however the rocket is able to focus its course to the frozen Meteor. Continuing the plan as it did during &lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28Chapter%201%29\"&gt;The End Event&lt;/a&gt;, with the time machine, six more rockets appear from the future to assist in creating a large Rift below the Meteor. The time machine's energy start to cause the Meteor to transform into several different objects, before it was successfully pushed into the large rift. Then, a Rift appears over &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Lake\"&gt;Loot Lake&lt;/a&gt; which a Rocket emerges from, with the Meteor following behind it. All the Loopers are launched into the sky after the initial rocket hits the &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, destabilizing it. The Meteor, guided by the six other rockets, hits the bubble which forms around the destabilized &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;. It struggles to break through, eventually crashing into the Zero Point, throwing players further away. The &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hole\"&gt;Black Hole&lt;/a&gt; then forms, which sucks all of matter into it and completely destroy this timeline from existence.\nSuddenly, a Big Bang occurs, creating new galaxies, each holding new realities. As existence starts to form, &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; witnesses the birth of these new galaxies while also going through a series of them, including a &lt;a href=\"LEGO%20Fortnite\"&gt;LEGO Galaxy&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Racing\"&gt;Racing Galaxy&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Fortnite%20Festival\"&gt;Musical Galaxy&lt;/a&gt;. In parallel, in the original timeline therefore in Reality Zero, The End also occurred, creating the Black hole then generating Apollo and Artemis. Jones returned to our time and e Asteria's inhabitant used the Battle Buses to travel to Helios. \nBefore.\nFollowing the result of &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Bang\"&gt;The Big Bang&lt;/a&gt;, several new Realities were created with one of them being &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt;. Following an undefined period of time, several decades or centuries before the arrival of Asteria's inhabitants on &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt;, an organization named The Society was founded by Montague, who presented his idea to the other elites of the Island during an inauguration in Grand Glacier. This led elites such as Nisha's and Valeria's family to join The Society. Decades later and once they were born, Hope, Nisha, Valeria, and Kavel were raised in The Society. Nisha and Valeria later took the place of their parents as heads of their respective families and rose to the highest rank, joining Montague at the top of The Society. Oscar was also offered a place after having climbed the ranks when he was an outsider. Peter Griffin, after becoming quite strong thanks to Meowscles' expired Slurp, became rich and also joined The Society becoming one of the bosses under unknown circumstances. The Society gradually took control of the Island hiring goons and people like Killian and Clara to become their Operators, along with all other elites joining their cause, except Silas Hesk, who decided to stand against them despite the multiple invitations to join the organization from Montague. However, Hope realizing how terrible they were, was driven by her sense of justice, rejected the ideals of The Society and left the organization before founding The Underground, a rebel organization dedicated to fighting The Society that Jones later joined. Seeking more power, Valeria would dig into her grandfather's old books on The Pantheon where she would read about the powers of Pandora's Box, she would share her findings with the other leaders leading them to search for Pandora's Box. Believing Jones had the answers, the Bosses kidnapped Peely.\nUnderground vs Society.\nSearching for his missing friend, Jones embarked on a mission of revenge against The Society, with the help of Hope. The Underground started an open war against The Society.\n&lt;a href=\"Takedown%20Quests\"&gt;Takedown Quests&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Underground\"&gt;The Underground&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;, continued their battle against &lt;a href=\"The%20Society\"&gt;The Society&lt;/a&gt;, led by Hope's sister &lt;a href=\"Valeria\"&gt;Valeria&lt;/a&gt;. As time passed, the forces of The Society slowly faltered, and fought amongst themselves. With the help of &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vengeance%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt; managed to rescue &lt;a href=\"Peely\"&gt;Peely&lt;/a&gt; from the grasp of their enemies, ending his quest for &lt;a href=\"Vengeance%20Jones\"&gt;vengeance&lt;/a&gt;. However &lt;a href=\"Valeria\"&gt;Valeria&lt;/a&gt; continued her research about the &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;box-shaped relic&lt;/a&gt;, seeking its power.\n&lt;a href=\"Odyssey%20Quests\"&gt;Odyssey Quests&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs &lt;a href=\"The%20Society\"&gt;The Society's&lt;/a&gt; power continues to dwindle, a strange traveler arrives on the Island called &lt;a href=\"Odyssey\"&gt;Odyssey&lt;/a&gt; and a strange Mosaic that bears a warning was discovered. After hearing about &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; and seeing part of their destiny, she recruited them to help her in her research about The Mosaic that she believe herald something and that it's linked to the ancient power that she feels on the Island. As The Looper manages to find more fragments of The Mosaic, Odyssey reveals that the Society Medallions that the leaders of &lt;a href=\"The%20Society\"&gt;The Society&lt;/a&gt; possessed contained a fragment of this power, and that this same power grows stronger.\nOn March 2nd 2024, after a series of earthquakes near &lt;a href=\"Valeria\"&gt;Valeria&lt;/a&gt;'s camp, a giant hand emerged from the ground holding the chained &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt;. On March 3rd 2024 during the &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box%20Opening\"&gt;Pandora's Box Opening&lt;/a&gt; event, the box was broken free from the chains and unleashed a giant beam of light and countless souls out of the box.\nWith Pandora's Box opened by Valeria, &lt;a href=\"The%20Pantheon\"&gt;The Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; has arrived on the Island, with Zeus immediately declaring that all mortals shall die by his wrath. The Gods started to punish The Society for opening the box, with the bosses left barely alive, &lt;a href=\"Montague\"&gt;Montague&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valeria\"&gt;Valeria&lt;/a&gt; both escaped The Island, while &lt;a href=\"Oscar\"&gt;Oscar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nisha\"&gt;Nisha&lt;/a&gt; kept a low profile. However, some gods, such as &lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;, as well as immortals such as &lt;a href=\"Medusa\"&gt;Medusa&lt;/a&gt; immediately disagree with Zeus' viewpoint on mortals and wish for them to thrive. All three of which notice &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;'s potential and are interested by her. &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; meets &lt;a href=\"The%20Oracle\"&gt;The Oracle&lt;/a&gt;, who envisions their fate, telling them they must prove the worth of humanity to &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; and the guardians of Olympus before the skies turn black.\nThe Oracle then tested The Looper to see if they could be the Hero of Mortals. After having passed the tests of strength, agility and wisdom of The Oracle, The Looper was recognized as the Hero of Mortals whose mission is to unite immortals against Zeus. Then, they were sent to provoke Hades to challenge him. After passing Hades' test which consisted of defeating &lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt; to prove that they could be able to defeat Zeus, The Looper was challenged by Ares and declared war on the gods by defeating the latter and stealing his medallion.\n&lt;a href=\"Rise%20of%20Midas%20Quests\"&gt;Rise of Midas Quests&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Rise%20of%20Midas%20Quests\"&gt;Midas Rises&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Marigold\"&gt;Marigold&lt;/a&gt;, suspecting that &lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt; is somewhere in &lt;a href=\"The%20Underworld\"&gt;The Underworld&lt;/a&gt;, gathers many of Midas' Old Crew back together and went to &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"SHADOW\"&gt;SHADOW&lt;/a&gt;, which has been under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Brutus\"&gt;Brutus&lt;/a&gt; since Midas' disappearance, takes over &lt;a href=\"The%20Marigold\"&gt;The Marigold&lt;/a&gt; Yacht and sets up SHADOW Briefings around the Island. &lt;a href=\"Marigold\"&gt;Marigold&lt;/a&gt; recruits The Looper to investigate &lt;a href=\"The%20Underworld\"&gt;The Underworld&lt;/a&gt; but they end up learning The Golden King escaped by managing to have an underworld guard unshackle one of his chains, then using his golden touch to soften the cuffs and lock to his cell door. Midas then enchanted lava with his Golden Touch to bring vengeance to the gods. He reunites with his former associates and his daughter, meanwhile The Looper and Marigold study the power of the Chains of Hades.\n&lt;a href=\"Rise%20of%20Midas%20Quests\"&gt;Et tu, Brutus&lt;/a&gt;: After meeting The Looper, Midas wanted to check the loyalty of his former number 2: Brutus. He asked The Looper to check his loyalty by recruiting mercenaries and then checking to see if he was listening to Midas with bugs. The Looper found bugs and reported it to Midas, who then demanded to confront Brutus. Fortunately for Midas, these bugs were only those of Hope, dating from when The Marigold belonged to The Society and Midas was reassured to see that his old friend had not betrayed him.\n&lt;a href=\"Rise%20of%20Midas%20Quests\"&gt;Jules vs. The Golden Touch&lt;/a&gt;: Marigold asked The Looper to work with Jules on how the Chains of Hades worked to find a way to contain Midas' Golden Touch, together they manage to harvest and transform the essence of Styx which Jules managed to infuse into gauntlets that she forged, allowing Midas to control his Golden Touch.\n&lt;a href=\"Rise%20of%20Midas%20Quests\"&gt;The Great Marigold Yacht Heist&lt;/a&gt;: After he received the gauntlets, Midas revealed his story in the form of myths to The Looper, and with his crew, they began their plan to escape in a new location far from Helios, for his ambitions. To this end the members of the crew, Meowscles, Skye, TNTina, Brutus, and Marigold gave several missions to The Looper in order to act as bait so that Midas and the other can go ahead into &lt;a href=\"Spawn%20Island\"&gt;Spawn Island&lt;/a&gt;, safely away from Hades while Brutus stays behind to prepare The Marigold yacht to pick them up and traverse on it to go on their new, fruitful adventures as reunited friends. Later the crew left The Island.\nNew Allies Against Zeus.\nAfter that, Cerberus recovers his artifact and promises to not reveal anything about The Looper to Zeus. The Oracle then contacts The Looper, telling them to show Zeus' edict to Medusa, so that she would join them.\nThe Revolution of Olympus.\nHope restores her fighting spirit, and reforms &lt;a href=\"The%20Underground\"&gt;The Underground&lt;/a&gt; to assist The Looper in trying to stop &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;, angry that he has been abusing power and needs to be stopped.\nDarkened skies... Choking dust....\nThe Oracle reminds the Looper of the prophecy about their own fate, concerning darkened skies and choking dusts, remarking that &lt;a href=\"The%20Wanderer\"&gt;The Wanderer&lt;/a&gt; approaches, and that they need to be prepared for war, but not without hope, because it will lead them through the darkness.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Sandstorm%20Event\"&gt;Sandstorm Event&lt;/a&gt;, Zeus used his &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Mount Olympus&lt;/a&gt; statue to overload &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt; and unleash a Nitro sandstorm from it. Everything that happens is just as what was prophesied by &lt;a href=\"The%20Oracle\"&gt;The Oracle&lt;/a&gt;. The sandstorm contains a shark-themed boat housing enemies attracted by the power of Pandora's Box that is slowly approaching the Island.\n\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wasteland%20Warriors\"&gt;Wasteland Warriors&lt;/a&gt; arrived on the Island along with the sandstorm and claimed ownership of the Wasteland Biome and all of the &lt;a href=\"Nitro\"&gt;Nitro&lt;/a&gt;. Hope discovered that &lt;a href=\"Megalo%20Don\"&gt;Megalo Don&lt;/a&gt; plans to destroy the Island, but won't be able to launch his raid until his &lt;a href=\"Brutal%20Beachhead\"&gt;Leviathan&lt;/a&gt; ship is refueled with enough Nitro. He therefore asks The Machinist, the Wasteland Warriors' engineer to &lt;a href=\"Redline%20Rig\"&gt;extract&lt;/a&gt; Nitro to be able to power the Leviathan. In the meantime, Megalo Don and his crew cause chaos and destruction over the Island, leaving &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; and their allies to try and stop him before it's too late.\nWelcome to The Wasteland.\nHope and Jones discover that &lt;a href=\"The%20Machinist\"&gt;The Machinist&lt;/a&gt; is building a pipeline from Redline Rig to power The Leviathan back up, they quickly contact &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; to fight on their behalf while they continue to gather information in order to find a way to takedown their leader &lt;a href=\"Megalo%20Don\"&gt;Megalo Don&lt;/a&gt;. Hope makes a makeshift base at &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Steppes\"&gt;Sandy Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, she soon discovers a gem holder connected to Pandora's box. Hope then asks The Looper to place surveillance devices in the Wasteland, and later discovers rumors about a &lt;a href=\"The%20Wanderer\"&gt;Wanderer&lt;/a&gt;. However she believes those are only rumors. Later, Hope and Jones contact The Looper and asked them to talk with Wastelanders &lt;a href=\"Brite%20Raider\"&gt;Brite Raider&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rust\"&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt;. They tell them that Megalo Don has been writing his plans down, and that something has been going on at &lt;a href=\"Redline%20Rig\"&gt;Redline Rig&lt;/a&gt;. The Looper is then tasked with raiding the rig and sending over information from the Rig's terminals to Hope, making them learn &lt;a href=\"The%20Machinist\"&gt;The Machinist&lt;/a&gt; is the sole competent engineer of the &lt;a href=\"Wasteland%20Warriors\"&gt;Wasteland Warriors&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecovering Pandora's Gem.\nA bit later, after hearing the chatter in the Wasteland, &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; discovers the Wastelanders have been finding Gems, that she suspect came from Pandora's Box. Realizing that Megalo Don and his crew are out there searching for these Pandora Gems as well, Hope and Jones sent The Looper to go collect the first gem at &lt;a href=\"Brutal%20Beachhead\"&gt;Brutal Beachhead&lt;/a&gt; and bring it back to them, The Looper finds and hands over the first gem to Hope, who begins to develop a strange headache whenever she's close to a Pandora gem. \nSoon after, &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; tasks The Looper with retrieving another one of Pandora's gems this time at the &lt;a href=\"Nitrodrome\"&gt;Nitrodrome&lt;/a&gt; after impressing &lt;a href=\"Ringmaster%20Scarr\"&gt;Ringmaster Scarr&lt;/a&gt;, she agrees to trade over her Pandora Gem. The Looper gives Hope the second gem as she begins to tell them about all the short visions she's been getting every time she interact with a gemstone, Hope tells The Looper to not tell Jones anything as she doesn't want him to get worried about her. Later Jones discovered the third gem was owned by Peabody. Once the Looper managed to get it after helping their auto technician in training, Dummy and gave the gem to Hope, she got another headache, stronger this time. She tells The Looper she's been getting visions of Megalo Don working together with The Wanderer. \nAround the same time, the mysterious being began wandering through the Wasteland while Megalo Don reveals that he and The Wanderer share a common goal and that the latter has important matters to resolve. Megalo Don orders his comrades that nobody should see his face.\nWith the pipeline starting to make good progress, and the Warriors' plan nearing a successful ending, Hope orders to find the last gem. After talking to Peabody, The Looper learns Megalo Don keeps his valuables in caches on the Island. After searching the caches in vain, they tried to recover Megalo Don's map of his hidden cache, once done The Looper recovered the Gem and gave it to Hope which causes &lt;a href=\"The%20Oracle\"&gt;The Oracle&lt;/a&gt;, who prophesied The Wanderer, to return and assist &lt;a href=\"The%20Underground\"&gt;The Underground&lt;/a&gt; in what comes next. After this, Megalo Don, furious that his gems had been stolen, demanded that the heads of Hope and Jones be brought back to him, while boasting that his plan would soon be in motion and that a wise friend had assured him that no one could stop him.\n&lt;a href=\"Refinery%20Event\"&gt;Leviathan's Folly&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn August 10th, 2024 at 2:00 PM ET: The event started with an opening speech by &lt;a href=\"Megalo%20Don\"&gt;Megalo Don&lt;/a&gt; giving an unhappy ending to everyone. &lt;a href=\"Nitro\"&gt;Nitro&lt;/a&gt; begins fueling his &lt;a href=\"Brutal%20Beachhead\"&gt;Leviathan&lt;/a&gt; until the pipeline gets disrupted by &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Doom\"&gt;The Wanderer&lt;/a&gt; and explodes. The explosions travel through the pipelines running through &lt;a href=\"Megalo%20Depot\"&gt;Megalo Depot&lt;/a&gt; and connecting to &lt;a href=\"Redline%20Rig\"&gt;Redline Rig&lt;/a&gt;, causing them to explode and leading to a bigger explosion near the location, uncovering &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt; inside the crater. \nFollowing the event and &lt;a href=\"Megalo%20Don\"&gt;Megalo Don's&lt;/a&gt; failed plan, &lt;a href=\"The%20Oracle\"&gt;The Oracle&lt;/a&gt; warns of a war that is coming, and that &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; must take a stand to fight &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Doom\"&gt;The Wanderer&lt;/a&gt; who has taken Pandora's Box powers, claiming that she has everything she needs. With &lt;a href=\"Wastelander%20Magneto\"&gt;Magneto&lt;/a&gt; on Hope's side, he has already prepared beacons to call in reinforcements from his reality.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Megalo%20Don\"&gt;Megalo Don&lt;/a&gt;'s pipeline exploded revealing Pandora's Box, The Wanderer reveals himself as the great &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Doom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt; and immediately absorbs all the powers of Pandora's Box before recruiting many dangerous villains to his side by summoning &lt;a href=\"The%20Raft\"&gt;The Raft&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Underground teams up with all the heroes summoned by Magneto, with Jones taking up the mantle of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20America\"&gt;Captain America&lt;/a&gt;, while Hope prepares herself to become a &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Hope\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt;. Nisha and Kavel, former members of The Society finally decided to join The Underground. With previous allies and members such as &lt;a href=\"Starr%20Oakley\"&gt;Starr Oakley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brite%20Raider\"&gt;Brite Raider&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rufus\"&gt;Rufus&lt;/a&gt; and many more rejoining The Underground's forces in an effort to help their friends Hope and Jones.\nGwenpool was captured by Doom's forces and imprisoned in one of The Raft's cells. She asked help from The Looper to accomplish her mission, first by asking them to take out a guard and steal their ID Chip. After she analysed the chip, Gwenpool tells them that it doesn't have everything she needed. She therefore asks The Looper to hack into The Raft's systems for her by using Doom's passphrase, CYNTHIA. The Looper recovered the drive that they then gave to Gwenpool. Later, as part of the last step of her plan she asks The Looper to search around The Raft to recover computer chips that Shuri needs for her plan, involving The Rift Beacons. The Looper does so and gives her everything she needed, before leaving. Gwenpool would later escape her cell and reunite with the other heroes.\nLater, The Looper and Jones try to find Doom together, but are unsuccessful. Hope calls The Looper to come investigate the crater left over by &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt; next to Redline Rig as something weird was spotted. Upon arriving and investigating, The Looper finds the broken mask of Doom. After a discussion with The Oracle, they come to the conclusion it's a prototype, and hands it over to Hope for further analysis. After bringing the broken mask to Hope, she expresses her doubts on how to stop Doom. The Looper and Jones later continued their investigation at Redline Rig to see if there are other pieces of Doom's broken armor, with Jones noting that Doom must have wanted them to find his mask. However they don't find anything else. Afterwards, Hope sends The Looper to retrieve the recording devices she placed at &lt;a href=\"Fractured%20Four\"&gt;Fractured Four&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cynthia%20von%20Doom%20Memorial\"&gt;Cynthia von Doom Memorial&lt;/a&gt;. They find that Doom has been there pondering his thoughts, as he speaks about the corrupted powers of the Box and how it keeps trying to overtake him, leading him to go into hiding for now, to make himself new armor. But this information tells them nothing about his whereabouts. So Hope subsequently sends The Looper to retrieve one of the chips implanted in the heads of Doom's Henchmen for analysis, noting that they no longer have to worry about how to defeat Doom, since they have to find him first. \nJones and The Looper continue their search for Doom's whereabouts, they search around the many dig sites guarded by Doom's henchman, as they speculate there must be a paper trail that could lead them to Doom, The Looper takes down a henchman and collects a shipping manifest. Jones then sends The Looper to go talk with &lt;a href=\"War%20Machine\"&gt;War Machine&lt;/a&gt; who has been analyzing some henchman notes, he discovers that Doom is incorporating parts of &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt; into his new suit, he tells The Looper to start training and allows them to use some of his gear such as &lt;a href=\"War%20Machine%27s%20Arsenal\"&gt;War Machine's Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"War%20Machine%27s%20Hover%20Jets\"&gt;War Machine's Hover Jets&lt;/a&gt;. Elsewhere, Hope desperate and nervous askes &lt;a href=\"The%20Oracle\"&gt;The Oracle&lt;/a&gt; if she has foreseen anything new, The Oracle talks about a feline ally, a cunning plan and a victory hidden in defeat. Jones finds &lt;a href=\"Shuri\"&gt;Shuri&lt;/a&gt;, the feline ally The Oracle spoke of, as he explains Shuri's plan on taking down Doombot.\nHope tasks The Looper with collecting supplies for Shuri, while Jones fully explains the plan of reversing the energetic flow of the Rift Beacons with Rift Recalibrators so they can possibly send Doom somewhere, far away from the &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Island&lt;/a&gt; but they aren't sure if this plan can work so Hope suggests they try this plan on Doombot first. Hope starts to have doubts on herself thinking she might not be good enough to lead the war against Doom. Elsewhere The Looper hands over the parts they gathered to &lt;a href=\"Shuri\"&gt;Shuri&lt;/a&gt;, she attaches the new Rift Recalibrators onto three Rift Beacons around &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Doom\"&gt;Castle Doom&lt;/a&gt;. Hope sends in The Looper to defeat Doombot, but something goes wrong as the recalibrators start to short circuit.\nHope and Shuri soon find out that Doom's lieutenants &lt;a href=\"Mysterio\"&gt;Mysterio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Emma%20Frost\"&gt;Emma Frost&lt;/a&gt; were the ones who tampered with the Rift Beacons, Hope realizes they can't just fight Doom and get it over with, instead they need to get rid of his lieutenants first.\nHope and Jones scout out &lt;a href=\"Doomstadt\"&gt;Doomstadt&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"The%20Oracle\"&gt;The Oracle&lt;/a&gt;'s guidance, and discover that Mysterio has been mind controlling the people of Latveria, the wastelanders and their own henchmen in order to create the illusion of perfection. \nThe Looper is tasked with going around the island freeing everyone under Mysterio's control, before taking out the many security cameras around Doomstadt, leaving &lt;a href=\"Mysterio\"&gt;Mysterio&lt;/a&gt; with no other way of controlling the people of Latveria. With everyone now free, Hope with The Looper's and Jones' help went to confront Mysterio. After a long fight The Underground succeeds in liberating the people of Doomstadt, spraying graffiti around the town and on the statue of Doom. \nJones sends The Looper to talk with &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Stark\"&gt;Iron Man&lt;/a&gt;, and Tony allows The Looper and The Underground to use his tech as they begin to make up a plan to defeat Emma Frost. After a test of Stark Tech, The Looper is sent to fly over Castle Doom to check the Rift Recalibrator signal while Tony gave power dampeners, to reduce Emma's psychic influence, to Hope. Jones then sends The Looper to test again the power of Stark Tech. Later, as Doom's army began to recover the Arcane Artifacts, which are fragments of Pandora's Box that Doom wants to use for his new armor, all over the Island, &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom's Chosen&lt;/a&gt; emerges to collect them and bring them to Doom. These six artifacts being intended to complete Doom's Pandora Armor, triggering a great battle between heroes and villains dubbed as the Day of Doom.\nAt Hope's request, mission details have been encrypted and classified and instructions have been hidden for &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; on the Island. After The Looper found the phone, they got a call from Hope on a securised channel and she told them the plan: using the Stark Power Dampeners to reduce Emma's psychic powers and then launch an assault against her. The Looper first used Forecast Towers to locate Emma Frost's operatives and learned they were already looking for them. Then they hired a specialist on order to make sure everything was good to place the power dampeners around &lt;a href=\"The%20Raft\"&gt;The Raft&lt;/a&gt;. Once done, Hope switched The Looper back to the main communication channel and was intending to coordinate an attack along with Jones and the other allies. However the Rift Recalibrators detected &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt;'s signal, and he was heading toward &lt;a href=\"The%20Raft\"&gt;The Raft&lt;/a&gt; meaning he finished his new armor. Jones warned Hope about this, but was caught in a moment of panic forcing The Looper to face Emma Frost alone, but they managed to defeat her. \n&lt;a href=\"Absolute%20Doom%20Event\"&gt;Absolute Doom Event&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt;, and their allies brace themselves for &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt;'s imminent arrival, setting up Rift Beacons near the Central Lake with the plan to send him back to his home reality. &lt;a href=\"Peelverine\"&gt;Peelverine&lt;/a&gt; is left in charge of activating the beacons, but he quickly delegates the task to The Looper. As &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; activates the beacons one by one, they all begin to aim towards Doom's Arcane Forge.\n As the final beacon fires at the forge, &lt;a href=\"Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; activates the rift but Doom's glowing green head emerges from the Arcane Forge, that was shielded, unleashing a powerful energy burst that engulfs the surrounding area with a wall of debris. Emerging as a giant, Doom swiftly annihilates almost everyone who opposes him in the area. After Doom flickered War Machine aside, Jones hurls his shield at Doom, but it has no effect and Doom knocks him to the ground. With Doom poised to finish him off, Hope leaps into action, she grabs Jones's shield and shields them both as the King of Latveria launches energy blasts at them. In a bold move, Doom grabs Hope, bringing her face-to-face with him. She stabs him in the eye with the shield still charged with Pandora's magic, leaving Doom with a scar over his eye which enabled a weak point suppressing his physical immunity. However Hope injured her own arm in the process. &lt;a href=\"Peelverine\"&gt;Peelverine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gwenpool\"&gt;Gwenpool&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"War%20Machine\"&gt;War Machine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Man%20Mk%2045\"&gt;Iron Man&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Spider%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Iron Spider&lt;/a&gt;\u2014supported by an army of Loopers\u2014charge in, engaging Doom in an epic battle at the Central Lake. Ultimately, the heroes and Loopers prevail, managing to weaken Doom enought to activate the final Rift Beacon, stripping him of his Pandora's Box powers and sending him back to his home reality.\nAfter the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Doom\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt;, several of the Rift Beacons were scattered across the Island, one landing in &lt;a href=\"Restored%20Reels\"&gt;Restored Reels&lt;/a&gt;, where artwork of &lt;a href=\"The%20Shark\"&gt;The Shark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Agency\"&gt;The Agency&lt;/a&gt; were drawn. The Rift Beacon activated, summoning a Rift Butterfly brought New York City's Times Square from Earth to the Island, where Ice Spice and Snoop Dogg performed a concert featuring some of their songs before the Rift Butterfly transported them and the Loopers of the Island to an another reality.\n&lt;a href=\"Chapter%202%20Remix\"&gt;Chapter 2 Remix&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Loopers of Helios were transported to an alternate reality similar to , where the Island is controlled by musical artists &lt;a href=\"Snoop%20Dogg\"&gt;Snoop Dogg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rap%20Boy%20Reloaded\"&gt;Eminem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rap%20Princess%20Ice%20Spice\"&gt;Ice Spice&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Juice%20WRLD\"&gt;Juice WRLD&lt;/a&gt;. After a month of exploring a remixed &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;, the artists performed one large concert featuring several of their greatest hits before the Rift Butterfly sends &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt; through a wormhole where they are joined by &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vengeance%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt;. Hope, Jones, the Battle Bus, and The Looper all go through the Rift in the wormhole, followed by a fragment of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;, taking them all to .\nAfter the fragment of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Zero%20Point\"&gt;Zero Point&lt;/a&gt; crashed onto &lt;a href=\"Oninoshima\"&gt;Oninoshima&lt;/a&gt;, it created a reality wave which opened portals across the Island to the Spirit Realm, allowing the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Warriors\"&gt;Demon Warriors&lt;/a&gt; to invade the Island once again. &lt;a href=\"Kendo\"&gt;Kendo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jade\"&gt;Jade&lt;/a&gt;, descendants of the family of artisans that were from the &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Clan\"&gt;Fox Clan&lt;/a&gt; during the Shattering War, have devoted themselves to protecting the Island. Teaming up with &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Blade%20Hope\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vengeance%20Jones\"&gt;Jones&lt;/a&gt;, the group begin learning the ways of magic to fight back against the Demons.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

After hearing about the citizens of Plank Harbor, Homebase sets up a Category 3 ATLAS Mission at Plank Harbor to completely wipe the storm from that area. Ray and the Commander were sent out to find Doctor Vinderman in his lab. However, by the time they got to the lab, he was already dead as a result of a lab accident. So the Commander defended the lab from Monsters and managed to save at least one of the lab servers. Homebase later learnt about Lars's past.

Shooting them from afar will also cause a guard to move to its alert stage. \nGuards typically have 100 HP and 50-150 shields.

Being in a Disguise allowed you to open Scan Doors and open &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Chest\"&gt;Faction Chest&lt;/a&gt;s, and allowed you to safely cross in front of Sentinel cameras and turrets. Carrying a henchman to a Scan Door or Faction Chest would also allow you to open them.\nHenchmen (In extension Bosses) were originally capable of being staggered when hit with powerful damage (Ex: Snipers, Shotguns or attacking them very fast). This causes them to stop shooting for a short period before regaining balance and attacking again. This trait had no cooldown so players could do it again and again until the target was knocked.

He could have been found in &lt;a href=\"The%20Underworld\"&gt;The Underworld&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoss Items.\nHades dropped the following items when eliminated. He also dropped 12 &lt;a href=\"Bars\"&gt;Bars&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhases.\nHades is not initially patrolling The Underworld. Instead, he can be challenged by breaking his effigy thus triggering the fight. \nThe encounter is split into three phases: \nPhase 1: ELIMINATE THE MINIONS!\nHades appears on his throne and is protected by a Dark Magic Barrier, watching over the battle as he summons three &lt;a href=\"Minions\"&gt;Minions&lt;/a&gt; to attack the player. During this phase, a maximum of three Minions can appear at a time and more will spawn to replace any that have been eliminated. Three of them need to be eliminated to progress into the next phase.\nPhase 2: ELIMINATE THE MINIONS!\nLike the previous phase, Hades remains protected by his barrier and summons additional &lt;a href=\"Minions\"&gt;Minions&lt;/a&gt;. Four of them need to be eliminated to progress into the next phase. During this phase, Hades uses the following ability:\nPhase 3: DEFEAT HADES!\nHades enters the battle and attacks the player while alternating between his Harbinger SMG and Chains of Hades to pull his target towards him. During this phase, Hades has the following abilities:\nGallery.\n=Lore=\nHades is the god of the dead, curses, funeral rites and necromancy. He is the prison warden, the overseer and the king of &lt;a href=\"The%20Underworld\"&gt;The Underworld&lt;/a&gt; and the brother of &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe is a supporting antagonist of , serving as a supporting antagonist in .\nPersonality.\nHades appears as a calm and friendly god at the very beginning, speaking in a calm and familiar manner. However he seems to be a prideful being, especially in battle. He sees mortals as lowly and scolds his &lt;a href=\"Minions\"&gt;Minions&lt;/a&gt; if they fail to their duty. He has a good relationship with his dog &lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt; whom he loves dearly. &lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt; believes Hades does care for &lt;a href=\"Loopers\"&gt;mortals&lt;/a&gt;, in his own way. However Hades hides a much more horrible side of his personality, he considers The Underworld as his playground and the souls of the mortals as his toys, which he claims not to be afraid to break showing his sadistic personality. &lt;a href=\"Graveheart\"&gt;Graveheart&lt;/a&gt; also calls him a deathly trickster, demonstrating that he is more cunning than he appears.\nTimeline.\nBefore Chapter 5.\nAt an unknown point he and Cerberus competed against &lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt; and Phinster in a surfing competition, although Poseidon managed to win. Sometime later, Hades trapped &lt;a href=\"Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Underworld\"&gt;The Underworld&lt;/a&gt; following his death.\nA constellation symbolizing Hades, in the form of &lt;a href=\"Chains%20of%20Hades\"&gt;his chains&lt;/a&gt;, and a carving of him could be seen on &lt;a href=\"Pandora%27s%20Box\"&gt;Pandora's Box&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Pandora's Box was opened, Hades came along with the other Gods to punish mortals for opening it and releasing the souls of The Underworld, though he doesn't seem fully on board with &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;' plan of destroying them all. Meanwhile, Hades is contacted by &lt;a href=\"The%20Oracle\"&gt;The Oracle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Looper\"&gt;The Looper&lt;/a&gt;, namely to prove the Looper's worth and to stop his brother &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;, and so Hades tests the Looper by having them challenge his dog, Cerberus, to a duel, allowing them to use a powerful weapon for a fair challenge. Once The Looper proves that they are strong enough by battling Cerberus, Hades continues to remain neutral in the conflict. \nHades fled from the island into the infinite corners of reality to find a new domain to rule over following the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;' tyranny, however he left &lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt; on the Island to wait for &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt;'s vacation to end, and for her to arrive \"on the sweet summer wind\". Later, he would return and take them with him to their new land.\nReferences.\n=Audio=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

It is in the southwestern corner of the map and was added in update 7.00, replacing &lt;a href=\"Flush%20Factory\"&gt;Flush Factory&lt;/a&gt;. Happy Hamlet is located at south coordinates D9, west of &lt;a href=\"Lucky%20Landing\"&gt;Lucky Landing&lt;/a&gt; and far south of &lt;a href=\"Shifty%20Shafts\"&gt;Shifty Shafts&lt;/a&gt;. It is a small European town, or hamlet, in the snow biome.\nHappy Hamlet is lowly populated as long as it isn't at the start or end of the battle bus. Happy tends to hold 0-2 players per game in solos and 0-3 teams in duos/squads. Players can sometimes find themselves completely alone at this location, leaving all the loot to themselves.\nSpeaking of loot, there are a total of 33 chests in Happy Hamlet, as of Season X, putting it within the top 4 locations for chests, with Mega Mall, Tilted Town, and Loot Lake. Additionally, furniture, trees, rocks, and fences all offer quality amounts of materials. Happy Hamlet can also spawn up to 3 vending machines.\nPlayers tend to not land Happy Hamlet because of its far, out of the way location. The storm circle isn't always going to fall on Happy, but several &lt;a href=\"Driftboard\"&gt;driftboards&lt;/a&gt; can spawn in the town, giving players plenty of mobility around the map.\nWhen it comes to combat in Happy Hamlet, it is very likely one would have already looted multiple houses before engaging in battle so the player will most likely have shields, a shotgun, and plenty of materials. There is never a rush to kill anyone in Happy as driftboards are always there for the storm and one can always find great loot here. When combat does begin, it will probably be at close range, so one should have prepared an &lt;a href=\"Submachine%20Guns\"&gt;SMG&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shotguns\"&gt;shotgun&lt;/a&gt; for combat plus some &lt;a href=\"materials\"&gt;materials&lt;/a&gt; to build some cover. \nIt was removed in &lt;a href=\"The%20End\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt;, where it was reorganized into &lt;a href=\"Misty%20Meadows\"&gt;Misty Meadows&lt;/a&gt;.

They are quests which must be completed in a single game, and task the player with eliminating an identified enemy player within a 6 minute time frame.\nBounty quests were obtained by either talking to a &lt;a href=\"Characters\"&gt;character&lt;/a&gt;, or by accessing a board outside of various locations. Accepting the Bounty from one of these characters or boards would start the quest.\nFunctionality.\nFor the Hunter.\nA Bounty quest initiated by showing the player the outfit that the enemy they were tasked to eliminate is using. It would then shortly show the name of said player, and start the 6 minute countdown to eliminate them. On the players map would be a small yellow circle, with the appearance of a radar scanner. In this circle was the location of the player who must be eliminated. As the countdown keeps going down, it would shrink, changing forms from its largest, to medium, to small. When the player locates the enemy, once they are eliminated (not just knocked, they must be eliminated), the Quest would be completed, and the player receives their reward of &lt;a href=\"bars\"&gt;bars&lt;/a&gt;.\nBear in mind, these notifications show for all members of the player's squad, and when a target is eliminated, all squad members will receive the reward. On top of this, any squad member can eliminate the target, regardless of who initiated the Bounty. As such, only one Bounty at a time can be initiated, but once complete there is no cool-down on starting another.\nFor the Hunted.\nWhen a player becomes the target of a Bounty Quest, the same 6 minute timer will display. The hunted player would get a threat indicator, highlighting how close the hunter was to their location. The threat indicator goes in three bars, and gets darker and fills to full when the hunter is close. The bars coincided with the size of the Hunter's circle. If the hunter was close, the bar would be full and red, if the hunter is far, the bar will be 1/3 and yellow. The hunted could survive the quest for 6 minutes and be given the reward attributed to the Hunter, if they were successful.\nLike the quest for the hunter, all members of the player's squad could see the threat level, but it only be targeted a single player in the squad. If that player was eliminated the Bounty ends, even if other squad members remain. As such, the squad can only have one member at a time being hunted.\nPoaching.\nIf you initiated a Bounty Quest, there was a chance your Quest could be poached. This means another player has eliminated your target by chance. This counts as a completion for the challenge, but you would get less &lt;a href=\"bars\"&gt;bars&lt;/a&gt; as a result of it.\nThe same way your target can be poached, the hunter could prematurely die before the Quest is up, and as such you received a reward less than surviving the full time.\nVersus.\nVersus was a special type of bounty added in for the Dragonball Z Super &lt;a href=\"Collaborations\"&gt;Collaboration&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Update%20v21.40\"&gt;Update v21.40&lt;/a&gt;. A versus worked like a normal bounty, but instead of showing a rough area, showed an exact location of the enemy. To compensate for this, the player who initiated the versus also had their exact location shown to the opponent. The Versus was unique in that it did not randomly target a player when initiated, rather both players had to queue for a Versus, and they would be matched together. If one player starts a versus and nobody else does, the versus would not start. All other bounty rules applied, including poaching. The Versus was removed in &lt;a href=\"Update%20v21.50\"&gt;Update v21.50&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Update%20v24.00\"&gt;Update v24.00&lt;/a&gt;.\nBounty Boards can now be destroyed.\n&lt;a href=\"Update%20v24.40\"&gt;Update v24.40&lt;/a&gt;.\nDisabled Bounty Boards.\n&lt;a href=\"Update%20v29.00\"&gt;Update v29.00&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Ocean keeps his helmet as a trophy and paints over it.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"The%20Authority\"&gt;The Authority&lt;/a&gt; depicts portraits of him in his SHADOW uniform next to an unnamed woman.\nFollowing the fizzled end to the GHOST and SHADOW faction war with both &lt;a href=\"Factions\"&gt;factions&lt;/a&gt; offline, Brutus went into business for himself as a buyer, seller, and builder of weapons. He appeared to have been popular, as he had made contact with several other inhabitants on the island at the time, including &lt;a href=\"The%20Reaper\"&gt;The Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, a competitor in the arms business who didn't seem to like him. In his escapades, he also made contact with &lt;a href=\"Menace%20%28Outfit%29\"&gt;Menace&lt;/a&gt;, a gladiator interested in working for him. \n&lt;br&gt;During this time, he also was interested in fishing, aspired to be \"top fisher\". \nA snapshot of Brutus in his SHADOW suit can be seen fighting &lt;a href=\"Rebirth%20Harley%20Quinn\"&gt;Harley Quinn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"DJ%20Yonder\"&gt;DJ Yonder&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cosmic%20Summer%20Celebration\"&gt;Cosmic Summer Celebration&lt;/a&gt;, he goes on vacation as &lt;a href=\"Beach%20Brutus\"&gt;Beach Brutus&lt;/a&gt; and is seen talking to &lt;a href=\"Boardwalk%20Ruby\"&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt; on a beach, with his \"former\" boss &lt;a href=\"Midsummer%20Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt;. He stays on the Island for a small while, proclaiming he is on vacation, and not seeming to mind the &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Reality\"&gt;Alien&lt;/a&gt; Invasion - though he indicates the only reason he does not seem to care much is strictly because he is on vacation. In truth, he had been reactivated by &lt;a href=\"Midsummer%20Midas\"&gt;Midas&lt;/a&gt; and was on an undercover mission with him, &lt;a href=\"Beach%20Jules\"&gt;Jules&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scuba%20Crystal\"&gt;Crystal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Boardwalk%20Ruby\"&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;. After the Summer ends, Midas gives Brutus control of &lt;a href=\"Midas%27%20crew\"&gt;Midas' crew&lt;/a&gt; before disappearing.\n&lt;a href=\"Brutus\"&gt;Brutus&lt;/a&gt; appears throughout Rift Encounter as a member of SHADOW again, training in martial arts. He offers his services as a mercenary.\nBrutus' GHOST helmet appears washed up to shore on &lt;a href=\"Memento%20Island\"&gt;an island&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Breezy%20Coast\"&gt;Breezy Coast&lt;/a&gt;, next to a ball of yarn from &lt;a href=\"Catty%20Corner\"&gt;Catty Corner&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Marigold\"&gt;Marigold&lt;/a&gt; suspects that Midas is somewhere on the Island, so she calls Brutus and the rest of &lt;a href=\"Midas%27%20Crew\"&gt;Midas' Crew&lt;/a&gt; back together.\nIt's revealed that Midas has been trapped in &lt;a href=\"The%20Underworld\"&gt;The Underworld&lt;/a&gt;. After escaping, he suspects that Brutus has betrayed him, so he sends the Looper to confirm Brutus' loyalty. The Looper finds that Brutus has remained loyal, and so he rejoins the other Agents and hands control of &lt;a href=\"Midas%27%20crew\"&gt;Midas' crew&lt;/a&gt; back to Midas.\nReferences.\n=Audio=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

{"id": "4069", "revid": "42035720", "url": "https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4069", "title": "Building", "text": "Building is a gameplay mechanic in &lt;a href=\"Fortnite\"&gt;Fortnite&lt;/a&gt; and is a key component of , , and . It was introduced with the launch of Save the World, and has been seen in many game modes since.\nIt was removed from standard playlists in , only being available in &lt;a href=\"Arena\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Team%20Rumble\"&gt;Team Rumble&lt;/a&gt;. Following the critical acclaim of this change, Fortnite: Zero Build was released, being the first core game mode with no building. On April 2, 2022, it was unvaulted with the return of standard playlists, alongside Zero Build.\nBasics.\nBuilding in Fortnite is achieved with four main structures: Walls, Floors, Stairs and Pyramids. Each of these structures can be edited to create new shapes. Each structure takes up a 1x1x1 place on the building grid, aside from walls which lie on the boundaries of each piece. The length of a tile is 5.12 meters. Each piece has several areas in which it can be edited to remove or raise elements of the structure. Doing so will rebuild it into the shape you have selected. There are a limited number of shapes for each piece, aside from the Pyramid which can function in any configuration.\nBuildings must connect to the floor or a wall in some way, failure to do so will cause the structure to collapse, or it cannot be created at all. When a structure loses its connection to the floor, it will gradually collapse, destroying all 1x1x1 tiles surrounding it in quick succession, until each tile not connected to the floor is destroyed. There is no other mechanic aside from this relating to acceptable structures, as long as a single point connects to the floor or wall, the structure will remain.Each element of a build can be edited in several ways. Walls and Floors have a 3x3 grid which allows for the removal or inclusion of various shapes to create new structures. Stairs have a specific direction based grid to create thinner or angled staircases. Pyramids can have each corner raised in a 2x2 grid to make ramps and larger pyramids. Each structure can be created and swapped between using the specific binds. Console users are able to instantly build specific structures without a targeted placement, albeit less accurately.\nStructures are made out of Wood, Stone or Metal. Each &lt;a href=\"Materials\"&gt;Material&lt;/a&gt; has its own properties, with Wood being fast to build but weak, Metal being slow to build but strong, and Stone being a compromise between them. Structures are destroyed differently depending on game mode. Each structure costs 10 resources to build, and are free to edit. When weakened, these structures can be repaired for an amount relative to the damage they have taken as a percentage (If a structure is damaged 90%, it will take 9 resources to repair). Repairing takes a similar amount of time to building, but is quicker due to the structure already being placed and it needing to repair less HP than to build it.\nWhen preparing to build the color of the intended building is shown at its location.\nIn Battle Royale.\nBuilding in Battle Royale is used to create structures which can aid you against other players, or protect you from enemy attacks. Unlike Save the World, structures can be attacked with weapons other than the &lt;a href=\"Harvesting%20Tools\"&gt;Harvesting Tool&lt;/a&gt; and anyone can attack your structures regardless of team affiliation, with squad members only being able to use the aforementioned tool. Only squad members may edit your structures, or in the case of larger team modes like &lt;a href=\"Team%20Rumble\"&gt;Team Rumble&lt;/a&gt;, teammates may edit them. You cannot place a &lt;a href=\"Traps%20%28Battle%20Royale%29\"&gt;Trap&lt;/a&gt; on an enemy structure. Structures in Battle Royale cannot be upgraded, but editing works the same way, as well as repairing.\nBuilding in Battle Royale is much more fast paced and tactical, unlike Save the World. Whilst the latter requires patience and careful planning, the former does not rely on building bases or protecting an objective. In Battle Royale, building is a mobility tool, allowing for players to run across gaps by continuously building or gaining vertical height by continuously building stairs and floors. Building in Battle Royale is also used to protect you and your teammates, in order to allow for them to regain health, or revive a squad member. As such, building is much more tactical and harder to master than in Save the World, and has a much different general use.\nIn all Battle Royale modes (Standard, Ranked, and Tournaments), the limit for all materials is 500 (150 pieces).\n&lt;a href=\"Limited%20Time%20Modes\"&gt;Limited Time Modes&lt;/a&gt; may have different material limits than standard playlists. For example the Strategic Structures LTM has a lower material limit. \nIn Save the World.\nBuilding in Save the World is used to create structures which stop &lt;a href=\"Monsters\"&gt;husks&lt;/a&gt; from destroying key objectives in the Mission. Structures are also used to place &lt;a href=\"Traps%20%28Save%20The%20World%29\"&gt;traps&lt;/a&gt;, lead monsters down a specific path, or generally block enemies from attacking you. Most structures are not permanent, but those built in a &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Shield%20Defense\"&gt;Storm Shield Defense&lt;/a&gt; will remain indefinitely or until destroyed. \nOutside of objective defense. Building can also be used for mobility, to cross gaps or to gain vertial height. It is also used to build radar towers and Survivor Relays.\nThe starting limit for all materials is 2K , , and each (600 pieces). This is increased by 1K as the player progresses through the zones up until 5K , , and each (1500 pieces) once the player reaches &lt;a href=\"Twine%20Peaks\"&gt;Twine Peaks&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpgrading.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Save%20the%20World\"&gt;Save the World&lt;/a&gt;, Structures can be upgraded, consuming more materials for each upgrade done. As such, Structures have three levels to them.\nEach upgrade costs progressively more materials:\nThis means a fully upgraded structure costs 60 resources. Upgraded structures can be repaired and destroyed the same as low tier ones.\nBuild &amp; Repair Speed and Building Health can be upgraded in the &lt;a href=\"Upgrade\"&gt;Upgrade&lt;/a&gt;s tab, which allow the character to build better and stronger structures that have more health and will endure more damage before being destroyed.\nDestroying.\nStructures can only be destroyed by the player, other players or by monsters. Players can only destroy structures with their &lt;a href=\"Pickaxe%20%28Weapon%29\"&gt;Pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, or by editing them in such a way they are no longer connected to the floor and are destroyed.
