She gives counsel, directions and reviews the day's work of Chthonic Gods and staff, as seen in her interactions with &lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dusa\"&gt;Dusa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"House%20Contractor\"&gt;House Contractor&lt;/a&gt;. She is also the creator of the &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal%20Arms\"&gt;Nocturnal Arms&lt;/a&gt; alongside her daughters &lt;a href=\"Fates\"&gt;The Fates&lt;/a&gt;.\nNyx is a daughter of &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and mother of &lt;a href=\"Fates\"&gt;The Fates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moros\"&gt;Moros&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hypnos\"&gt;Hypnos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20Nyx\"&gt;many others&lt;/a&gt;, and foster mother of &lt;a href=\"Selene\"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;.\nNyx eventually curried favor with the &lt;a href=\"Olympians\"&gt;Olympian Gods&lt;/a&gt; and gave Zagreus the &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20of%20Night\"&gt;Mirror of Night&lt;/a&gt; to aid in his escape.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nNyx is the primordial goddess who personifies the night. She co-rules the underworld alongside Hades and is more involved in the state of the realm itself than its inhabitants. She deeply supports Zagreus' desire to leave, and will grant him the \"Mirror of Night\", which will aid him in his quest for answers and self-discovery.\nAlthough the chthonic gods represent darker aspects of humanity's reflections, and for this reason the Olympians dislike Nyx and fear her, Nyx is considered benevolent, approachable, and maternal towards Zagreus. She was the first to unconditionally support him and contact the Olympian gods to help him escape. She never felt comfortable lying to him, unable to look at Zagreus without feeling guilt and responsibility for the conditions that bind him to the kingdom. It is implied that Nyx may know even more than Hades about Persephone, but cannot tell him because of Hades' prohibitions, so he will have to discover the mysteries behind his mother's disappearance and himself on his own.\nEven though supporting him means he will have to leave the \"flax\" and she will see him less frequently she encourages him. Nyx was able to bring him back from the dead and change his tragic fate, but that did not stop her from reprimanding him or being tough on him from time to time. Zagreus witnessed Nyx being his greatest defender against his controlling fatherhood. She will conspire against Hades and pull the ropes strings behind the scenes.\nDespite her compassionate tenderness and attentive parenthood towards Zagreus, she is not usually like this with her own children, treating them with emotional distance and professionalism because it will strengthen them. With ultimate authority, her phrases end with \"Are we clear?\" She does not like to be contradicted and can be cold, unfair, and commit injustices, as shown by Dusa.\nThe true reason Nyx chose to help Zagreus leave the underworld to reunite with Persephone is that it was part of a larger plan to end the rivalry between chthonic and Olympian gods. However, she genuinely has good intentions behind it.\nPhysical description.\nNyx has pale gray skin, yellow eyes, and very dark purple hair. She appears to be wearing black eye shadow, purple lipstick, and periwinkle nail polish. Her waist-length hair is elaborately fashioned with a braid on either side and a high bun held up in part by a golden crown. Her hair also flares to either side in the shape of a pair of bird-like wings, and the stars of the night sky can be seen on the undersides of these \"wings.\"\nShe is dressed in graceful robes of purple and gray fabrics with gold accents. The sleeveless robes are long enough to cover her feet and hug her neck, but expose some of her chest. Her golden pauldrons are shaped like a pair of crescent moons, each with one thin, purple bat-like wing shooting outward. Her chest, forehead, and hanging earlobe piercings are decorated with teardrop-shaped &lt;a href=\"Darkness\"&gt;Darkness&lt;/a&gt; crystals (seemingly identical to the collectible in-game item). She has a skull motif, with three white skull shapes on her chest, each with bright pink eyes. The golden skull on her crown also features the same color eyes. In addition, the crown is decorated with numerous pale star shapes. Nyx wears a golden armguard on her left hand, which also bears three rings: two with purple crystals, and one bright pink. Finally, a long, purple ribbon floats ethereally around her frame, levitating behind her head until it wraps forward onto the inside of her elbows.\nHistory.\nBefore \"Hades\".\nNyx, the night itself, is one of the oldest and most feared deities born from &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt; itself. Long ago, they went their separate ways, Nyx forging her own path and destiny. Having her own descendants, many of whom, beyond her calculation, now reside in realms beyond reach, perhaps even beyond hers, each with specific roles and purposes to fulfill ordained by her.\nAfter the war of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Titans\"&gt;Titans&lt;/a&gt;, she found herself compelled to share dominion over the realm with Hades, who acquired it by decree of her daughters, The Fates. Co-managing the underworld alongside &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;, but with the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt;, everything became more bearable. Nyx invests more in the state of the realm itself than in its inhabitants.\nFollowing the prophecy of Hades lacking an heir, Persephone bore a lifeless child, leaving Persephone devastated and departing indefinitely. Nyx struck a persistent deal with the inscrutable &lt;a href=\"The%20Fates\"&gt;Fate&lt;/a&gt; to bring &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; back from the dead. However, the result led to a troubled child, unable to reside in the world above for an extended period. After Persephone left the Underworld, Nyx became the main caretaker of Zagreus, assuming the role of his surrogate mother.\n\"Hades\".\nThroughout the &lt;a href=\"Hades%20%28game%29\"&gt;game&lt;/a&gt;, Nyx reveals to Zagreus that she is not his true mother. Nyx feels Zagreus's desire to depart and find his real mother, but does not hinder him. She is his first ally and orchestrates everything discreetly under Hades's nose.\nNyx contacts the &lt;a href=\"Olympians\"&gt;Olympians&lt;/a&gt; and offers Zagreus the &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20of%20Night\"&gt;Mirror of Night&lt;/a&gt; to ease his journey. Zagreus will often share with her anything new he found on his attempts and she often encourages him to not give up on his goals.\nAs a close friend of &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt;, she is one of the most glad for her return, and both enjoy reconnecting at the lounge.\nEpilogue.\nNyx takes part in the feast prepared by the house to accommodate the Olympians and put an end to any possible conflicts inside the family. She gets to interact with &lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;, who has on multiple occasions expressed a desire to meet her.\nZagreus can also take part in a quest to reunite Nyx and &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt;. Feeling Nyx's presence and help radiating from the prince, Chaos confesses they feel alone and wish to reconnect with their daughter, a feeling that turns out to be mutual. Thus, Nyx instructs Zagreus he must fix the Eldest Sigil so she can access the &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Gate\"&gt;Chaos Gates&lt;/a&gt;. Once done so, Nyx may be found during runs when Zagreus visits Chaos.\n\"Hades II\".\nShortly after the birth of &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;, Hades's second child, Nyx was imprisoned by &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;. She currently remains in the Titan's clutches.\nAs part of a promise made with &lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt;, all of Nyx's children are granted safety and shelter at the &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile she is absent, her will is currently carried by the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Sisters\"&gt;Silver Sisters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Unseen\"&gt;The Unseen&lt;/a&gt;. \nAffinity.\nIf given &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;, Nyx will give you the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Shawl\"&gt;Black Shawl&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter giving Nyx 6 Nectar, she cannot be given any more gifts until you complete a favor for her.\nOnce you have completed the favor, she can be gifted &lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt;, although she does not give a &lt;a href=\"Companion\"&gt;Companion&lt;/a&gt; in return.\nNyx's affinity gauge is maxed out at 9 hearts, requiring the gifting of 6 Nectar and 3 Ambrosia total.\nIf affinity is maxed out with Nyx, there will be unique text above her keepsake. this text states: \"from Nyx; you share and eternal bond\" as well as \"Through sense of duty, she raised you. From the dark of her heart, she loves you.\"\nFavor.\nNyx's favor is part of the &lt;a href=\"Fated%20List%20of%20Minor%20Prophecies\"&gt;Fated List of Minor Prophecies&lt;/a&gt; and requires you to reunite her with &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, she will tell you that she has sensed Chaos' attempts to communicate with her. She will later inform you that the bridge to Chaos cannot currently be accessed through the eldest sigil in the administrative chamber, but you can change this using a certain amount of &lt;a href=\"Darkness\"&gt;Darkness&lt;/a&gt;. An upgrade will become available at the &lt;a href=\"House%20Contractor\"&gt;House Contractor&lt;/a&gt;, requiring 3142 . The reason for the precise value is not known, but it is the constant pi rounded to four digits times one thousand, and also the total number of Greek gods according to the Theoi Project. Previously, the value was 8888 . Once purchased, Nyx will then use the eldest sigil to visit Chaos' realm, and you can even encounter her there in your run. When she returns to the House of Hades, her affinity gauge will no longer be locked, and you can give her Ambrosia.\nCodex entry.\nUnlocking the complete Codex Entry requires deepening Zagreus' relationship with Nyx. \nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\nMerchandise=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Nyx, you're not my mother. All this time, you and my father, you ... you lied to me?\"\n Nyx : \n\"\"Oh\", my dear child! So now you know ...? So now you know. But, only half the truth. I can explain the rest, so, please ... It was never my wish to hurt you.\"\nAfter first defeat.\n Nyx : \n\"Do not despair, child. Such setbacks are inevitable, and may be overcome with effort and with time. You made contact with the goddess Athena. She shall be true to her word?\"\n Zagreus: \n\"I believe it, Nyx. I'm grateful that you put us into contact. I know you took a considerable risk in reaching out.\"\n Nyx : \n\"The risk is not to me. I expect the Olympians would involve themselves in this, eventually. Reveal to them no more than they already know. Are we understood?\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Yes. We are.\"\n Nyx : \n\"Then go.\"\nDialogue 01.\n Nyx : \n\"Darkness guide you, child. You have outgrown this House, of that I am now certain. Should you return again here, I shall keep you safe.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"I won't forget you, Nyx. I swear it.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Nyx : \n\"I trust that the Mirror in your bedchamber has proved satisfactory, dear child ...?\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Better than I could have possibly imagined, Nyx. You mentioned there was something more that it could do, once I had grown accustomed. I think I'm ready for that now.\"\n Nyx : \n\"I think you are, as well. Then, it shall be as you wish.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Zagreus: \n\"I finally made it to the surface, Nyx! Confronted Father, there, out in the cold. I couldn't make it past him, but ... I was so close!\"\n Nyx : \n\"Do not despair, as I told you before. With effort and with time, most any setback can be overcome. Even your father. You have come closer to your goal. Achieve it!\"\nAfter first defeat against Hades.\n Nyx : \n\"Your father is not here, and you are back. Then, it can only mean one thing. Are you all right, my child?\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Yes, I think so, Nyx. Returning here by Father's hand does put a special sting into it, though. So, any invaluable tips on how to vanquish him? Some hidden weaknesses only you know about, something like that?\"\n Nyx : \n\"You know his weaknesses better than anyone. Better even than he. It pains me to know that the conflict between you could not be settled in some other way. But if this is how it has to be... destroy him for me, next time you fight up there. However long it takes. Would you do that?\"\n Zagreus: \n\"I would. I will.\"\nAfter first victory against Hades and meeting Persephone.\n Nyx : \n\"Your father fell to you, as once his father fell to him. Although, you were substantially more merciful. I know it is a bitter victory, at best. Though, tell me ... what transpired subsequently, that you have returned? Did you locate your birthmother?\"\n Zagreus: \n\"I did, I ... she was there. She was ... where you said she'd be. And, more than I imagined, but ... I had so little time with her. I can't survive up there, for very long. Why didn't you tell me I'd just die, no matter what?\"\n Nyx : \n\"Oh, my child... I say this seldomly, but... I did not know. Or... I did not wish to believe... that the surface would have such an effect on you. But it seems you share your father's fate, after all.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"My father's fate? But he is smugly waiting for me every single time I make it there, and seems quite healthy by then, all in all! Though... maybe the farther we get from this realm... the worse we get. Because he cast his lot... inheriting the Underworld?\"\n Nyx : \n\"So I now presume. You are bound to this realm by powers greater even than mine. Tell me something... if you knew that you could only see Persephone for but a moment's time... would you still make the journey to her, there?\"\n Zagreus: \n\"...Yes. Yes, I would. I had so many questions left for her!\"\n Nyx : \n\"Then, go and ask them, child. Steady your resolve, and find her there, again. And use well what brief time you have with one another, whilst you can. As mortals do.\"\nConversations with &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hades : \n\"\"Olympus knows of him?!\" Bestowing on him all their worthless blessings, here, within my realm! \"Our\" realm! Explain to me how, exactly, this is possible, Nyx. Either your limitless power has considerably waned, or you are up to something.\"\n Nyx : \n\"Do not question my power, Hades. Your son was bound to be discovered the closer he came to the surface. The Olympians are pleased to know they have a distant relative, and bid him welcome to their mountain. That is all. Their influence is very limited.\"\n Hades : \n\"Blood and darkness! Do not speak to me about their \"influence\"! I've seen their influence firsthand. You've made a foolish mistake.\"\n Nyx : \n\"You would speak to me of foolish mistakes? You cannot change the course that has been set. Try all you like.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hades : \n\"... You are not to aid him in these matters, Nyx; his foolishness is to be scorned and reprimanded, not indulged. Do we have an understanding?\"\n Nyx : \n\"We have an understanding, Hades, yes. He is your own son, after all, and therefore your responsibility. I, in turn, have my commitments to this realm, and to this House. You have aided me in them, so I remain, as ever, in your debt.\"\n Hades : \n\"It is not necessary to remind me. Surely all those who once defied my brothers and myself would much prefer a post within my House over eternity within the lowest depths of Tartarus. Not that the darkness there would trouble you.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hades : \n\"... It is plain to me that you are helping him; in spite of my insistence you do not. What do you expect that I should do about this, Nyx? What would you do, in my position? Deception, in my very house and home ...! Answer me.\"\n Nyx : \n\"Hades, my relationship with remains unchanged. It is the very same relationship from when you first requested I take care of him. He has my full support, and always shall. You must know this. He wishes now to leave. I shall make no attempt to stop him.\"\n Hades : \n\"\"Tsch\". What good is any one of you? He's not even your son; and yet you coddle him. You know as well as I that he cannot succeed. You fill his mind with harmful delusions. If that is what you want for him, then, please! Proceed at pace.\"\nConversations with Other Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Dusa\"&gt;Dusa&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Nyx : \n\"... And after that, Dusa, you are to clean the rafters once again, and prune the gardens thoroughly. By then it should be time to tend the kitchens, and sweep the lounging area a second time ...\"\n Dusa : \n\"Y, yes, right away!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Nyx : \n\"... We each have our commitments to this House, Megaera. There is no shame in yours. And whilst your sisters are away, you bear their burden of responsibility, as well.\"\n Megaera : \n\"I understand, it's just ... am I supposed to keep pretending nothing's changed? This House is cracking at the seams, and no one's going to admit it?\"\n Nyx : \n\"The House shall stand eternally, although in what condition, it is ours to decide. Our obligation is to keep the House in order.\"\n Megaera : \n\"I know. You're right of course, you're right ... I'll do my best. I'll do my best for both our sakes, Nyx.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Thanatos : \n\"Mother, is there something I can do to help, with all of this? I spend too much time away from the House. Please, let me know.\"\n Nyx : \n\"You are already doing what you can to help, my son. Continue doing so. Matters are at stake here concerning you and all of us. Your support and choices in this shapethe outcome that shall come to pass.\"\n Thanatos : \n\"I understand, and I will do my best. Thank you for taking care of everything. I've every faith in you, Mother. And in this House. Farewell.\"\n Nyx : \n\"Farewell.\"\nAbout Other Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Fates\"&gt;Fates&lt;/a&gt;.\n Zagreus: \n\"Nyx ... you saved my life. Gave me life. When I was born. Father told me. I don't what to say. Why didn't you tell me?\"\n Nyx : \n\"There are many things that I am not at liberty to speak of, child. Through my own binding choice. These circumstances are among them. Suffice is to say that your revival ... required the extent of my ability. And considerable time.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"I never should have been born ... is that what the Fates wanted? Did you defy your own daughters?\"\n Nyx : \n\"Silence. Tempt not my daughters thus.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;.\n Zagreus: \n\"Nyx, I've come to know the god of swiftness, Hermes, though... it seems to me he doesn't work directly with the others on Olympus. Do you know him well?\"\n Nyx : \n\"Lord Hermes is a point of contact, yes. Among Olympians he works the closest with our operations here, and aids with shepherding the souls of the departed to our gates. Accept his help; for he is faithful to our cause.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"I get it. Thank you, Nyx.\""}

This was partly due to the expectations that Chaos placed on Nyx, and also because Nyx became occupied with her work and forged her own path. Chaos does not directly enter the world they created and interact with their children because Chaos' mere presence could risk destabilizing all of existence. They reveal that they regret being an absent parent to their child and want to reconnect and spend more time with them, remembering the times they used to play hide-and-seek when they were still together. Despite the distance since childhood, they love their daughter Nyx. Zagreus can choose to help Nyx reunite with Chaos, and the two can reignite their relationship.\nIt's implied that Nyx's distant relationship with Chaos is at least partially the reason for why she is such a doting mother to all of her own children as she does not wish for them to have to experience the pain of having a distant relationship with a parent as she once had. \nThe Fates.\n&lt;a href=\"Fates\"&gt;The Fates&lt;/a&gt;: Nyx's daughters.&lt;br&gt;It is revealed that despite being against the rules, Nyx made a deal with The Fates, her daughters, to bring Zagreus back from the dead, and they only relented after much insistence from Nyx, their own mother.\nCharon.\n&lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;: Nyx's son.&lt;br&gt;Nyx and her son indeed seem to have a positive relationship. She has always found him self-sufficient and one of her less dependent children, perhaps second only to the Fates.\nCharon always appears to be around, engaging in various activities for Nyx, whether it's rowing and ferrying suffering souls across the river Styx or even battling Transgressors when necessary. Nyx must have appreciated when Charon broke his work oath to assist Zagreus and Persephone. Nyx praises Charon for his truly tireless work and considers him reliable and invaluable to the House. Nyx, unlike anyone else in the underworld, being his mother, knows Charon well.\nMoros.\n&lt;a href=\"Moros\"&gt;Moros&lt;/a&gt;: Nyx's son.&lt;br&gt;It is assumed that in the relationship with Moros, her son is distant, but it remains unknown.\nNemesis.\n&lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;: Nyx's daughter.&lt;br&gt; Nyx maintains a professional relationship with her children in their work environment, aiming to toughen them up. Nemesis is very good at what she does, and she is absent, fulfilling some tasks assigned to her. It seems that Nemesis is very loyal to her mother.\nThanatos.\n&lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;: Nyx's son.&lt;br&gt;Thanatos greatly respects his mother and constantly shows deference to her, which may have given him the reputation of being a \"mommy's boy\" among other subordinates in the House. They are similar in the sense that they move through the shadows, working against Hades to aid Zagreus, and he knows her well enough to know that she rarely changes her mind about matters related to the state of the House of Hades.\nAs his mother and superior, Nyx encourages Thanatos to strive to do his best in his work, due to its importance. He also offers to help her with the affairs of the house, but she encourages him to continue helping in his own way.\nHypnos.\n&lt;a href=\"Hypnos\"&gt;Hypnos&lt;/a&gt;: Nyx's son.&lt;br&gt;Believing that Hypnos is excessively dependent on her, Nyx strives to promote her son's independence by maintaining emotional distance. She advises him not to address her as \"mother\" in the main hall, a habit he persists in, and also requests that he refrains from speaking to her during working hours, a request he dutifully obeys.\nShe anticipates that others may find her disposition disagreeable and, without prior notice, may step forward to punish him on behalf of the collective. Upon receiving him, she hopes that Zagreus, referring to Hypnos, is prepared for this situation.\nHowever, her attempts to encourage his independence stem from both maternal care and her ongoing concerns about his work ethic. She experiences a profound sense of relief when she observes him demonstrating competence, and the boundaries she establishes are firmly rooted in what she believes to be in his best interest, regardless of his personal opinions.\nEris.\n&lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt;: Nyx's daughter.&lt;br&gt;One of Nyx's daughters, Eris seems to have a distant and dysfunctional relationship with her.\nSelene.\n&lt;a href=\"Selene\"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt;: Nyx's foster daughter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Hades II, it is mentioned that Nyx created Selene after she grew up without parents.\nZagreus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;: Nyx's foster son.&lt;br&gt;Nyx's devotion to Zagreus mirrors that of a mother to her own child. She not only embraces his choice to depart the Underworld but actively facilitates his journey by entrusting him with the Mirror of Night and interceding with the Olympians on his behalf. In moments of failure, Nyx provides a comforting presence for Zagreus, offering him solace while also candidly acknowledging the challenges that lie ahead, never sugarcoating the difficulties he faces.\nThe depth of Nyx's affection for Zagreus is further illuminated when it is revealed that she defied convention by beseeching the Fates to revive the stillborn Zagreus, an act that flouted established rules. Despite the potential consequences, Nyx's maternal love prevailed, resulting in Zagreus's rebirth and setting the stage for his odyssey. Grateful for Nyx's profound sacrifices and unwavering support, Zagreus holds her in the highest esteem, recognizing himself as fortunate to be nurtured by two extraordinary mothers who have shaped his destiny with their boundless love and guidance.\nHouse of Hades.\nPersephone.\n&lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt;: Nyx's co-manager and close friend.&lt;br&gt;Persephone and Nyx enjoyed a warm and amicable relationship during Persephone's tenure as Queen of the Underworld prior to Zagreus's birth. Nyx held Persephone in high regard, describing her as respectable and dignified. In turn, Persephone cherished Nyx's companionship and support during her initial adjustment to life in the Underworld, expressing a profound sense of longing for Nyx and Cerberus above all other denizens of the realm.\nEven upon Persephone's eventual return to the Underworld, their bond remained steadfast. Persephone expressed gratitude for Nyx's role as Zagreus's foster mother in her absence and acknowledged Nyx's pivotal role in orchestrating her reunion with her son.\nHades.\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;: Nyx's co-manager&lt;br&gt;Hades and Nyx manage the domain together. They mostly tolerate and begrudgingly respect each other, even if they fight at times- Zagreus comments upon this aspect of their relationship, and Nyx admits that she and Hades sometimes convince themselves they are husband and wife, because of how they are obligated to cooperate. While he controls the punishment of Titans and primordial gods, she appears to have some kind of arrangement with him to have avoided a similar fate for herself. She is against the toxic education that Hades exhibits towards Zagreus, intervening in his upbringing, and being his greatest defender. Nyx is so feared that not even Hades takes direct measures against her, despite her openly aiding Zagreus in his escape attempts. While Hades may not think that Zagreus needs a mother, he is grateful to Nyx for fulfilling that role for a long time.\nMegaera.\n&lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt;: Nyx's employee.&lt;br&gt;In her relationship with Nyx, Megaera holds deep respect for her as one of her children. As Nyx's foster child figure, Megaera is not immune to being reprimanded by her raiser, often receiving guidance to speak with greater respect. She rarely questions Nyx's wisdom and consistently seeks her mentor's counsel. \nMegaera places her trust in Nyx, sharing her workplace frustrations stemming from the responsibilities assigned by Nyx's functions, which she finds disagreeable as they were imposed upon Zagreus, and Nyx remains unaware of the current stress it causes her. Nevertheless, Megaera follows Nyx's guidance to persevere in her household responsibilities without protest, in accordance with her mentor's maternal advice, which Megaera heeds attentively.\nDusa.\n&lt;a href=\"Dusa\"&gt;Dusa&lt;/a&gt;: Nyx's employee.&lt;br&gt;Nyx disapproves of Dusa for her tendency to overwork herself and associating with Zagreus. She eventually removes Dusa from her job without warning. It is when Zagreus intervenes that Nyx is persuaded to allow Dusa to work in the House again, although not without \"certain stipulations\". Dusa is eventually promoted to head guardian of the house by her, when Nyx admits that she may have been unfair.\nUnderworld Residents.\nFuries.\n&lt;a href=\"Furies\"&gt;Furies&lt;/a&gt;: Nyx's employees.&lt;br&gt;Nyx unlike Megaera, &lt;a href=\"Alecto\"&gt;Alecto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tisiphone\"&gt;Tisiphone&lt;/a&gt; tend to have only an extremely professional relationship, and they follow Nyx's orders without question.\nOlympian Gods.\nThe Olympians look down on Chthonic gods as a whole.\nAthena.\n&lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;: Goddess of Wisdom.&lt;br&gt;Athena seems to be on good terms with Nyx, whom she considers to be shrewd. She is one of the first Olympians to respond to Nyx's plea to help Zagreus. At one point, she confesses that she sometimes envies Zagreus' relationship with his (foster) mother, having never had one herself.\nAres.\n&lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;: God of War.&lt;br&gt;Ares mentions that Nyx is frowned upon on Olympus, though he has always wanted to meet her, in part out of a sense of gratitude for her role in his own work. After enough interactions with the two he will contact her; Nyx hints that she might actually enjoy the attention and, surprisingly, seems to appreciate his affection.\nZeus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;: King of the Olympians.&lt;br&gt;Zeus initially believed that Nyx was the closest thing Hades had to a Queen; a misconception that would be resolved following the first game's epilogue."}

After the war, he departed Troy to return to Ithaca but his journey lasted ten years and during the voyage he and his crew faced countless perils. He eventually returned to Ithaca and reclaimed his throne from would be usurpers. He died years later this time unable to escape his doom.\nHe appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;\" and aids &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; in her fight against &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nOdysseus maintains a contained yet somewhat trusting personality, stemming from his exploits in the Trojan War. Now deceased, he serves as a mentor and advisor at &lt;a href=\"the%20Crossroads\"&gt;the Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;, lending his strategic expertise to assist &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe is primarily amiable, assuming the role of uncle/brother and counselor to Melino\u00eb, despite her lack of prior acquaintance with him. In his mortal life, he achieved fame and popularity, akin to &lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt;. However, in his former life, he lacked the balance he now exhibits, often sporting an arrogant smile, embodying the traits of a spy, strategist, and cunning hero of the Trojan War.\nHe relishes recounting his cunning exploits to impress those more naive, often indulging in self-aggrandizement to please others. Though reality may not entirely align with his tales, his luck in defying the odds and his cowardly lion persona suggest that many of his stories have been embellished over time.\nDespite Odysseus not being entirely trustworthy and resorting to exaggerated tales to impress &lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt; initially to secure employment at the Crossroads, he also harbors a weakness for women, unable to resist having romantic affairs with them despite being married, ultimately leading to the end of his marriage with his wife. He emphasizes that his love for his family was genuine, and his desperation to reunite with his wife and son drove him forward, advising Melino\u00eb to draw upon the memory of her stolen family to maintain hope in her quest to defeat &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;, so she can achieve a successful, happy destiny he himself did not.\nPhysical description.\nStanding tall with a confident expression, Odysseus appears as a dark skinned man with some signs of age. He uses a golden headband to keep his dark hair away from his green eyes. His printed red cloak is held in place by a silver pauldron on his right shoulder. He uses a printed blue scarf, and below the cloak some silver armor can be spotted on his chest. Both the pauldron and the armor have crescent moons on them. He wears a brown military vest adorned with tiny silver plates all over held in place by a decorated belt, ending in a blue hem with more crescent moons on it and a white skirt. His right arm has a red and blue bracelet while his left arm is covered in blue bandages.\nAround his waist are multiple ropes sustaining his multiple pouches and bags. He carries lots of messages and reports in these. Finally, he balances an upside down knife on the tip of his finger.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\nMerchandise=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

At least you aren't contending with \"them\", aye?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"My route through the Underworld is fraught in its own right, but yes, it's comforting to know that army of traitors remains ignorant of me.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"There's not a downward route that's more discreet. Those thorny chaps in the woods, \"they've \"no love for Chronos either, at least.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'll get past them.\"\nDialogue 02 (Anomaly).\n Odysseus : \n\"You look as though you've seen a ghost, if you'll forgive the very antiquated mortal turn-of-phrase, Goddess. So we'd say to someone looking disconcerted. Things all right?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Yes and no; I saw Chronos out there. I thought he had me, but I broke free from his spell. This was in Oceanus, though I also caught him snooping near the pathways out of Erebus.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Damn it... our reports said nothing of the sort, but then... some of our Shade informants haven't yet returned. We had expected Chronos to stay put in the lowest reaches. You must have caused enough of a stir to catch his notice.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I've hardly been discreet in my approach. Is there truly no other way?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"We reckon not. We're counting on him thinking you're inconsequential to his plans. As for our own, I shall go over this with the good witch. Be safe, and cheers for the report.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Of course.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Odysseus : \n\"Got a most troubling report, a sighting in the pathways on the outskirts of Erebus. Did our eyes out there see true?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"If it's Chronos that they saw, then yes. Now at least I know what he looks like; but he knows \"me\", in turn. Why do you think he let me go? Have we been compromised?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"No one gets into the Crossroads whom we don't permit, or can even know we're here... not even him. So he's sniffing around? Fine. He wastes \"his \"time whilst \"you \"get closer to your mark.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Is he even capable of wasting time...?\"\nDialogue 04 (Won Battle).\n Odysseus : \n\"You got him, didn't you? Killed the bastard, for... one night, at least. The first report I heard, I scarce believed, but by the third or fourth, I'd come around. \"Well done\", Goddess!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Thanks, Od. Though I'd not be surprised if our reports already say he's returned. But I got what I needed for now. And a little bit of payback, I suppose.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Aye, and he'll be sore about it, I expect, but... even though we're not there yet... we needed this, I think. \"You \"needed this. On to the next phase then?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Oh, yes.\"\nDialogue 05 (Lost Battle).\n Odysseus : \n\"You found him, Goddess... your look says it all, along with my reports. Gave him something to remember you by, I reckon, even if the battle didn't go your way...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Chronos was exactly where we expected... but I could not foresee his every technique. And my ability to withstand his magick went only so far.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Well, fortunately for you, the old are often rather slow to learn. You run into him a few more times like that, you'll soon know every trick he's got. Though... do be very careful out there, aye?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Aye.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Circe\"&gt;Circe&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"During a recent voyage, I found Circe the Enchantress on her little isle, evidently safe from all the turmoil at sea. Don't you two know each other fairly well?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"In life and death we can but strive to know each other well, Goddess... Though I knew Circe... just a bit, at least; as casual acquaintances is all, why do you ask?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Oh just in case you wanted me to tell her anything when next we met, as she may be providing some assistance when I navigate the Rift of Thessaly.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"No, no need to tell her anything. Best keep your focus on the task at hand.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"What happened between you and Circe, Od? She mentioned you, said nothing in particular, except... I sensed a pain there, and I sense it here and now.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"It's not a pain entirely, Goddess. When I was whole, returning from a war, I found Circe and her isle, and... I lived there for about a year. She housed me and my men, and we grew close. I learned a lot from her, and then... we left.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Your voyage home. You stopped for an entire year, then voyaged on and never saw her again...\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Well, aye, until I saw her again here. It's just... it's in the past, and for the both of us, I think. Not every such relationship need last eternally.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I understand, I think...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Animal%20Familiars\"&gt;Animal Familiars&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Hey where'd &lt;a href=\"Hecuba\"&gt;Hecuba&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gale\"&gt;Gale&lt;/a&gt; scamper off to?

Where did you meet, I always wanted to ask?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"\"Heh\", well. All I can say is that I was... alone. At the end of one life, and the start of another. Lost. She appeared before me then, in all her splendor, and... she revealed to me a path I hadn't seen.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"That all sounds very figurative. Were you already dead?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"I was. She told me she could grant me a new life. She needed a tactician knowledgable of the surface. I thought, who am I to turn a goddess down? I followed her. It's been a while now.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"A good while I'm sure.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Odysseus : \n\"The good witch put you to the test out there, did she? Quite an intensive teaching style, I always thought. She expects a lot from you, but that's just what happens when you've such potential.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Then she must be disappointed with my results, although she's careful not to show it. Same as you, Odysseus.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Come, I know how dispiriting it is to chart one's course, only to lose one's way. We rarely get where we must go the fastest way we can.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"As long as we get there at all.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Moros\"&gt;Moros&lt;/a&gt;.\n Odysseus : \n\"So \"Doom \"has come to stay with us a bit? My last and only other brush with him did not resolve \"particularly \"well, so... I'll just keep my distance, if that's quite all right.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"All children of Nyx are welcome in these Crossroads. Though I think Lord Moros wishes to keep \"his \"distance, too.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"No objections here!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Odysseus : \n\"Nemesis has been in an especially foul mood of late. Anything I should know about?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I was going to ask you the same. She sought my task, but that's nothing new. Though, she's been clashing with Headmistress more and more...\"\n Odysseus : \n\"\"Ah\", shame it's been this way. Personally, I'd rather have Divine Retribution with me than against. I reckon you can't just smooth things over with her, can you?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I have my doubts...\"\nDialogue 02.\n Odysseus : \n\"So how has Nemesis been faring out there? Taking matters into her \"very \"capable hands. Not making \"too \"much grief for you, I hope?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"So you know already? And Headmistress must, too. Nemesis is being Nemesis! Discovering firsthand our task is not as simple as it seems.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Say no more, then! Though, if she becomes too intent on impeding your results over achieving her own, we'll step in.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It won't come to that.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Scylla\"&gt;Scylla&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Odysseus : \n\"How's life of late down at the bottom of the sea? All sorts of nastiness lurking there, \"that \"the reports make clear. I wager you've seen some things.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You'd win that wager handily. The worst of them has to be this sea-monstress called Scylla, and her Siren friends. They have this ridiculous act...\"\n Odysseus : \n\"What, Scylla's still around? With the Sirens, no less, \"hah! \"It's a wonder you made it back. Please tell me you didn't listen to a word they sang?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Oh, I heard an earful.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"\"Ungh...\"\nDialogue 02.\n Odysseus : \n\"I once was desperate to hear the Sirens' song... I barely resisted their temptations; of course I was... merely mortal. Perhaps you're less susceptible to their allure.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Perhaps. At any rate, I fail to see the appeal. Although it's possible the Sirens were better off without Scylla. She seems rather bossy...\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Oh she's a menace. Caught half a dozen of my crew like she'd a separate set of teeth for each of the poor lads. We'd little choice but to pray to the gods, and sail on. Tell her hello for me!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Did the gods answer your call at least?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"\"Erm\", for the most part!\"\nDialogue 03.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I've seen you here alone more often lately, Od. You miss &lt;a href=\"Penelope\"&gt;Penelope&lt;/a&gt;, don't you? And your son, what was his name? &lt;a href=\"Telemachus\"&gt;Telemachus&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"\"Ah\", Goddess, you may see through most of us Shades, but your empathy for me's a bit... misplaced. Penelope, Telemachus, and I... we're cordial with each other still, but... how to say this without sounding callous...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Please speak your mind with me. I'm certain you're not callous.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"...My mind wanders not to matters of family, but... to the Sirens' blasted song. I scarce got to hear it even once, whilst navigating through their waters. I wanted \"desperately \"to cast myself into the sea, just for a better listen...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"The Sirens' song? You can't expect me to believe that Scylla's incessant drivel is the source of the Great Tactician's concerns of late?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Now, now, spare me the ridicule, I'm dead serious about this. You weren't with me on the surface there and wouldn't understand...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Seemingly not...\"\nDialogue 04.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"When last we spoke in the taverna. I didn't mean to shame you for your musical tastes. I just had no idea that Scylla could be taken seriously by anybody... much less you.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"\"Ah\", think nothing of it. Siren music's an \"acquired taste... \"acquired by all those who sailed in their vicinity whilst I was whole. \"Incessant drivel\", though, that's all you think it is?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Well... perhaps I was a bit uncharitable in my assessment, it's just... I have trouble separating my disdain for the performer from the quality of her craft.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"It must be very catchy, aye?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Aye.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Skelly\"&gt;Schelemeus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You and Commander Schelemeus both were great and famous sailors, weren't you, Od? Did the two of you ever meet in your mortal days?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Oh, \"great sailor \"is an understatement, Goddess! They say his exploits rivaled even mine! Alas that I never once had an opportunity to witness his prowess. \"Ah\", it must have been something!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"We're fortunate to have you both.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hypnos\"&gt;Hypnos&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You ever seen Hypnos so much as shift in his sleep, Od? I know he's been through a lot, but... still.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Can't say I have. Been just that way from the night the good witch got him. The snoring I became accustomed to eventually...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Think he's ever going to wake? None of the incantations we've tried have had any effect.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"He's Sleep itself, isn't he?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Odysseus : \n\"A word of caution, Goddess, in regard to an impediment you may confront when finally you reach the far end of the Mourning Fields. Reports suggest it's some sort of infernal beast... a big one. Our Shades had to stay very far away.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"We knew there was a secure entrance into Tartarus around that point... this beast must be how come the tunnel stays secure. Have we any details?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Well it has several fire-spitting maws, allegedly, which troublingly fits the profile of your father's household pet. Though, if this really is the case... may it simply let you pass!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"What, you mean Cerberus himself guards the entrance to Tartarus? Why would he do the bidding of Chronos? Impossible.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"The reports are inconclusive, but I thought you should know.\"\nDialogue 02 (If &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; Has Beaten Cerberus).\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I can corroborate our Shades' reports. And add that this infernal beast is none other than Cerberus, my father's household pet... acting on instinct and pure rage.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"\"Ahh\", I feared as much. For they said the beast had several fire-spitting maws. I don't suppose he recognized you after all this time, and... let you pass...?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"He did neither of those things. I have to help him.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01 (&lt;a href=\"https%3A//hades.fandom.com/wiki/Eris%23%2522Blessing%2522_Of_Strife%3A~%3Atext%3DStrife%2520it%2520causes.-%2C%2522Blessing%2522%2520Of%2520Strife%2C-If%2520Melino%25C3%25AB%2520progresses\"&gt;\"Blessing\" of Strife&lt;/a&gt;).\n Odysseus : \n\"Word has it Eris has been spotted in the depths along your path... intelligence you likely could have used \"before \"she made your journey worse for you. Apologies, Goddess...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"She's trying to stop me, or at least slow me down. And... she knows too much about our intentions. What do we do? Children of Nyx are supposed to be on \"our \"side.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"She doesn't know the \"half \"of what we've planned. Besides, her \"boredom \"drives her more than anything. Run into her a few more times, she'll soon grow sick of it and go away.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"So deems the Great Tactician...?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Aye, Goddess.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Have you caught Eris snooping through our plans or anything? Have to be even more discreet with her about...\"\n Odysseus : \n\"She stays over in her little corner mostly, Goddess, but I've been keeping my eye on her in case of anything. As long as she undermines our efforts well out of earshot...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"We can plan around it, you mean.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Aye.\"\nDialogue 03 (Won Battle).\n Odysseus : \n\"Good, you're back. According to reports, Eris flew off toward the Rift of Thessaly on an intercept course with the fleet. Except I don't think that she's headed there to help. Not \"you\", at least.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"These reports aren't of much benefit to me after the fact. But at least I can confirm they're accurate. How preposterous that we cannot rid ourselves of her.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"All we can do is work with what we've got. I apologize that we could not forewarn you on this one. We'll continue investigating her motives and accomplices.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'm not convinced she has any of either.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;.\n Odysseus : \n\"With your Olympus-dwelling relatives assisting you, I've half a mind to ask you to let them know I'm on your side, except... \"erm\", not all of them love me.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"What? \"But you're the Great Tactician, Odysseus! Even the gods were impressed with your machinations in your glory days.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"\"Erm\", Lady Athena and others favored me, it's true, but your uncle Poseidon, well... I got on his bad side, I believe. Maybe he's let it go after all this time, but that's a risk I'm not prepared to take, so... keep quiet about me, would you?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I hear you.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Polyphemus\"&gt;Polyphemus&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Odysseus : \n\"How was the surface, still warm and welcoming I reckon? You're to be commended for even setting foot up there.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It was dreadful. The city of Ephyra is completely overrun. And, there's a blind Cyclops making sure no one gets out.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Well, that all sounds entirely unfortunate. Blind Cyclops, \"eh? \"That must be Polyphemus. Gave him that scrape myself, way back. He still going on about eating people?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"He is.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"\"Augh...\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Your old adversary Polyphemus wanted me to give you a message on his behalf. Though, come to think, I'm uncertain what he wanted me to say. Perhaps just... kick you savagely?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"\"Eh\", sounds like the Cyclops that I used to know all right. My crew and I, we were his captives for a while... and his food supply. I found a way to get us out of there, but it was ugly...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"He calls you Nobody. How did he come to know you by that name?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"\"Nobody \"took his \"eye\", Goddess... I gave to him a name that wouldn't make a lick of sense when he called over to his mates for help. We had to try.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"He has \"mates?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Perhaps not anymore.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Odysseus : \n\"How is old Polyphemus, anyhow? Slowed down a bit since he was young, perhaps...? I scarce was any match for him, but I was merely mortal, whilst you're... \"you.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"He's territorial, though seems much more concerned with sleep and appetite than any other cause. So, you really blinded him, then...?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"I did... and only wish he had \"another \"eye so that I could have done it \"twice\". For evidently \"he \"is not remorseful in the least for what he did, and... as you \"plainly \"see, neither am I.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"...I'll get him for you.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Good.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Charybdis\"&gt;Charybdis&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I must admit, on some occasion all the tales you told about the sea-monster Charybdis felt almost beyond belief. Now having faced the blasted thing, I feel you sold it short.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"What, faced \"Charybdis? Hah\", Goddess. I'd seen reports about some sort of whirlpool in Poseidon's Rift, and now my fear's confirmed. \"Eh\", at least it didn't swallow you outright.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Any tips on how to deal with it?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Avoid it at all costs?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;.\n Odysseus : \n\"So, there's a bit of a new wrinkle in our plans. We've been able to verify some of the details that Master Hermes suggested to you, about what's... brewing on the surface.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Please tell me what you may; and if you think it wise for me to deviate from my objective to address whatever's going on up there.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"The forces of Chronos gather to sail on Olympus through a channel cut across the land. You're poised to disrupt the enemy ranks from within. Aid Olympus, and your chances against Chronos may improve.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"The warded pathway leading up should drop me right into the heart of our foe's forward garrison. It seems so reckless...\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Call it a calculated risk.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Heracles\"&gt;Heracles&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I encountered mighty Heracles on the surface. No mistaking him! Though I thought he was dead. He seemed very much alive, on the outside, anyway. And still in service to the gods...\"\n Odysseus : \n\"The great \"Heracles... \"that's a complicated one. Part \"man\", part \"god... \"part monster too, perhaps. The rules of death don't quite apply to him. What did he want? He give you any trouble?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"He was quite brusque. Told me to stay out of his way. Sounds like he has a task of his own. Maybe Olympus isn't counting on me to succeed...\"\n Odysseus : \n\"\"Eh, \"don't take it personally. You have wise relatives, and ruthless ones. They may not like their odds hinging on any one individual. And... do watch yourself with Heracles, aye?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Aye.\"\nHide and Seek Flahsback.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Odysseus, have you seen Hecate about?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"\"Mm\", not in a little while, little goddess. Though, I'd expect that pointy hat of hers to give her away!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'll look for it! Thank you!\"\n Odysseus : \n\"She's got to be around here somewhere, little goddess!\"\nWith Other Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Moros\"&gt;Moros&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Moros : \n\"To be direct with you, Master Odysseus, I am what you might call an admirer. At first, I found you \"extraordinarily \"frustrating, so adept were you at avoiding certain Doom. But gradually, perhaps grudgingly, I grew very impressed.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Oh, \"hah\", I'm... flattered and relieved to hear it, very kind of you to let me know, particularly after... all this time...\"\n Moros : \n\"It's quite humorous, in fact. While you drew breath, I never once had opportunity to tell you!\"\n Odysseus : \n\"\"Erm, \"quite humorous indeed, milord! I intended no offense by avoiding you, you know that, of course? A mortal impulse, whilst in mortal peril.\"\n Moros : \n\"Oh, you were a wonder to behold! There were the Laestrygonian giants, Charybdis, and, lest we forget... the war of Ilium...!\"\n Odysseus : \n\"I never do...!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Moros : \n\"...So then... were you ever certain you had finally met your Doom? Or did you truly think there was always a plan of escape to be discovered, no matter how dire the circumstance?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Well, to be quite frank with you, Moros \u2014 may we be informal thus? I had the hardest time untangling myself not from near-fatal situations, but the arms of certain goddesses... my greatest weakness, looking back...\"\n Moros : \n\"\"Ah\", indeed... but how was this a weakness? As I understand, your wife Penelope stood by your side despite your indiscretions... I trust I do not overstep; I know this can be a sensitive topic with those from the surface.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Aye, Penelope stood by my side... because I only told her so much about my \"indiscretions\", as you call them. Then when we reunited after death, I had to tell her the rest. She had spent her best years awaiting an unfaithful man.\"\n Moros : \n\"I see. After everything you'd been through, did your relationship end in an amicable way, at least?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Aye, surprisingly enough... it did.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Moros : \n\"...The wooden horse was an exquisite trick. Your own inevitable Doom, misdirected toward your unsuspecting foes! A masterstroke. But my personal favorite had to be the Polyphemus incident...\"\n Odysseus : \n\"You speak of it like an old action yarn. Big bastard massacred my crew. My heart threatened to burst from my chest getting past him, and \"now \"he's up to his old antics with the Goddess there.\"\n Moros : \n\"\"Oh\", but I have no doubt that with your guidance, the Princess shall outsmart the Cyclops \"again \"and \"again. \"As recompense for the trouble that he caused you!\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Hear that, Goddess?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hecate : \n\"The Tactician brings ill tidings with an optimistic bent. Fine. And what news from the men of the isles, if any yet survive?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"According to my confidants, they've all sworn in with Chronos, I'm afraid. Mortals... they often want whatever they don't have. Another Golden Age, in this case. The \"promise \"of one.\"\n Hecate : \n\"'Tis a \"lie \"that spurs their betrayal, rather than a promise. They shall perish, then... by the wrath of the gods.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"And then their wretched souls shall hound us with renewed vengefulness. I've witnessed endless wars before, Madam. So have you gods. How can we stop this?\"\n Hecate : \n\"\"We \"cannot. \"Melino\u00eb\", however? Certainly \"you \"can, correct?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I can and shall.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Odysseus : \n\"...And, \"erm\", that's the end of my report this time, Madam. Should you have any questions, please don't hesitate to summon me at any time.\"\n Hecate : \n\"I shan't, Odysseus. Although, there is one further matter that I wanted to discuss with you, and rather quietly...\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Certainly, Madam.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;.\n Odysseus : \n\"...I'm saying that the possibility exists, yes. Eternal vigilance is near impossible. Enemies have always exploited the lack thereof. I ever tell you of the old wooden horse trick?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"The old wooden horse trick, yeah. Surely your reputation as the Great Tactician hinges on more than this one tale?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"\"Ah\", but classics ought to be retold! Though, if you'd rather, I have far more tales of trickery and valor. Take the Cave of the Cyclops!\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Not Cave of the Cyclops...\"\nAbouth the Scenery.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"https%3A//hades.fandom.com/wiki/The_Crossroads%23The_Garden%3A~%3Atext%3Dby%2520the%2520list.-%2CThe%2520Garden%2C-The%2520Garden%2520with\"&gt;Garden&lt;/a&gt;).\n Odysseus : \n\"Your little garden there has cheered this old place up a bit, Goddess! In trying times, such simple pleasures oft are first to fade. Precisely when they're needed most.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Thank you, and pleased to hear it, Great Tactician. Though, I'd not expected a mere flower patch to leave such an impression on someone like you.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Come now, all I \"do \"is pay attention to details. Victory comes to those whose hearts are predisposed. I mean, look at us, our spirits are quite literally all we have; and now, flowers!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Help keep an eye on them for me, would you?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Aye.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Erebus\"&gt;Erebus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Odysseus : \n\"Those thorny chaps you've been dealing with... their numbers grow in each report I get. If you've thoughts on how we could have better prepared you...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'll share my thoughts when necessary, Odysseus. For the moment, I'm sorting through them still.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Aye, best not to speak without prepared remarks. I understand the feeling only too well. You'll keep me posted, though?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I will.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Oceanus\"&gt;Oceanus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Odysseus : \n\"The good witch there noted you were able to vanquish her in a full-on contest. Impressive stuff! You get much farther?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I did. Down to the chambers near the bottom of the sea. Strange music echoing all through the place. I wasn't prepared.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Strange music, huh? Reminds me of when... \"erm\". Oh, I'll spare the tales for another time, you've enough on your mind, I can tell.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Mourning\"&gt;Fields of Mourning&lt;/a&gt;.\n Odysseus : \n\"\"Ah\", you made it to the Mourning Fields, good! Tartarus is not too far behind... directly underneath, in fact, but the ingress is a bit of a walk from your initial drop...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"A bit of a walk, fraught with soul-devouring daemons and other life-hating fiends. Too powerful to be imprisoned so they're free to wander there, something like that?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"We mortals just love the Fields, Goddess! A place to rid oneself of misery \u2014 or drown in it. A perfect spot for daemons, only \"some \"of which shall leave you be.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"That has been my experience.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Tartarus/Hades%20II\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Odysseus : \n\"I heard your efforts to bring Cerberus back to his senses were successful... at least temporarily, Goddess. He bounded off to Tartarus, only to be cast out into the Fields again?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"That's what I gathered, yes. In Tartarus, he seeks his master... my father. Whom I happened upon, bound in chains! Chronos is torturing them... mocking them.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Chronos is using \"them \"to get at \"you. \"Instill in you emotions that compel you to throw caution to the wind. Remember, wars are won and lost in hearts and minds.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Did you not act on your emotions in your mortal days?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Well, yes... I always did...\"\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Why not send Nemesis to the surface in my stead? Even if I undo the wards sealing the path, I don't know that I'll last long up there.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"The matter on Olympus isn't as personal for Nemesis as it is for you; and she hasn't been especially receptive to suggestion recently.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"No, I suppose not.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Odysseus : \n\"The good witch always figured you would make your way up to the mortal realm. Once you were ready and the situation called for it. Well done.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"She warded the pathway there, until such time as I had the means to pass through. But the climate on the surface is another matter...\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Your Underworld birthright stuff getting in the way? A curse not just a blessing, it would seem. Well, if your witchery got you this far, surely it can aid with this... predicament.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"That's the plan.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Thessaly\"&gt;Rift of Thessaly&lt;/a&gt;.\n Odysseus : \n\"How was it sailing through the Rift of Thessaly, Goddess? Sometimes I long for my past days and nights at sea. Probably since I've forgotten just how miserable it was...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I feel I could remind you at this point. Chronos has this vast fleet of ships drawn from the very depths, drowned crews and all. I had to commandeer whichever craft I could.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"A proper nautical experience, then! Fraught with \"danger, mystery...! Ah\", I feel a little envious of those drowned crews! After I died, I thought my sailing days were done.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Well, Chronos could probably use more sailors after what I did to them.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Put in a good word for me would you?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Mount Olympus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Odysseus : \n\"Our good witch there knows you've a mountain of a journey ahead of you, Goddess. You hear about our mountains on the surface? Big tall rocks?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"What, you mean like Mount Olympus, or Mount Othrys? Of course I've heard of them! They reach up to the sky. I can only imagine.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"You look up from the base to the peak, you'll swear they can't be climbed, \"but! \"If you only concern yourself with making that next step... you'll make it to the top.\"\nAbout Enemies Dialogue.\n&lt;a href=\"Satyr%20Champion\"&gt;Satyr Champion&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Thessaly\"&gt;Rift of Thessaly&lt;/a&gt;).\n Odysseus : \n\"Not sighted Chronos on the surface yet. Why risk it when you've got bloodthirsty Satyrs serving as your eyes and ears? His forces are more organized than first they seemed.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I just had an unfortunate run-in with one of those Satyrs. Well-armed, well-trained... and Chronos has entire legions.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"\"Hrm\", this is the war they've sought ever since the gods put Chronos in the ground. The promise of the Titan's return; immortality and untold riches...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"...Lies.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Most likely, aye.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Goldwrath\"&gt;Goldwrath&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Tartarus\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt;).\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Not the report I wished to deliver, though I've some idea of what Chronos has been doing with all of his excess gold... I was trounced last night by a gigantic bag of coins.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"A \"Goldwrath\", then! I reckon if you're Chronos, and you've got a limitless supply of shiny metal... might as well use some of them for your profane research. \"Ah\", but you were close...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"That I was...\"\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Verminancer\"&gt;The Verminancer&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Tartarus\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt;).\n Odysseus : \n\"They sent the \"Verminancer \"after you, Goddess? We know that Satyr by no other title, nor of any others of that size. He's one of the Titan Lord's high priests!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Then the Titan Lord shall soon have one \"fewer \"high priest.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Even if you take him, our reports say that he cannot \"truly \"die. A gift from Chronos, in exchange for performing the ritual that brought him back...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I can at least test the veracity of our reports.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Lamia\"&gt;Lamia&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Mourning\"&gt;Fields of Mourning&lt;/a&gt;).\n Odysseus : \n\"Can you confirm a sighting of Queen Lamia down in the Mourning Fields, Goddess? I'd caution you to watch for signs of slithering about, except I reckon I may be too late...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I must have drawn her out of her den, yes. That or I barged into it, but either way, her magick proved too much for me last night...\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Too much even for \"you? \"Nay.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Mourning\"&gt;Fields of Mourning&lt;/a&gt;).\n Odysseus : \n\"Found yourself a Phantom Lair in the Fields, if my Shades down there are still to be believed. Blood-sucking bastards... the \"Phantoms\", not the Shades.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Don't such creatures usually stalk the surface in their search of \"living \"prey?

Don't care if you're immortal, I'm relieved you made it back in one piece...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It can't be. I did confront a rodent of extraordinary savagery, but it was so little! I assumed the King Vermin was huge.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Tall tales. The King Vermin's wrath is inversely proportional to its stature. And its stature, as I understand, is very small indeed...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"Brr...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Deep%20Serpent\"&gt;Deep Serpent&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Oceanus\"&gt;Oceanus&lt;/a&gt;).\n Odysseus : \n\"Heard reports you were proceeding well through Oceanus, but evidently they were not up-to-date.

I spent a good-sized portion of my mortal days away from home. Had a war to fight, got a little sidetracked after.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Sidetracked? Headmistress says that you spent many years at sea. Some of them in the company of goddesses, at that.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Yes, well. By the time I finally returned, I hardly recognized my son, and my wife... we lived out our mortal days together, and that was enough. I reckon they're comfortable somewhere below.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You haven't seen them? What happened?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Penelope and I drifted apart. Happens with mortals, sometimes. And it happens with Shades too. As for my son Telemachus, he's his own man. Such is life. Or death, as it turns out.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Yes...\"\nDialogue 02.\n Odysseus : \n\"Come join us, Goddess! I was just regaling the Shades about when first I traveled to the Underworld. Whilst I yet lived and breathed, if you can believe it! And thusly I got out.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Come on, Odysseus, there was no escape from here when my father ruled. Are these Shades truly so impressionable?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Oh I'm \"dead \"serious! My tales aren't... quite as tall as they may seem. But now, the gates of hell are flung wide open, aren't they...?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"We're going to seal them shut.\"\nAbout Rain.\n Odysseus : \n\"\"Ah\", I miss the feeling of the rain, sometimes. Then I remember years at sea, soaked to the bone, and thank the gods the blasted stuff can't get to me as once it did.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"The rain brings life, as well as death... especially the latter on this night. The Lost Souls out there seem to hate it near as much as you.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Aye, almost seems to soften them up, doesn't it? Leave them ripe for the harvest. Go pick some off for me, will you?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I think I will.\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Obol%20Points%23Charon%27s%20Stash\"&gt;Charon's Stash&lt;/a&gt;.\n Odysseus : \n\"See Charon's latest haul, Goddess? Shipment by the riverside, all yours. And we're watching the rivers, making certain this won't be the last.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Lord Charon risks aiding my efforts in such a direct way. Are we able to compensate him at all?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Aye, with what Gold we've gathered recently. He really means to melt down every last one of those Chronos coins we can get our hands on.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Oh yes.\"\nAbout Mood.\n Odysseus : \n\"Oh! Hail, Goddess, I, \"erm... \"didn't notice your approach. Half-inclined to blame the onset of the years, but I've no such excuses in this state.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I didn't mean to startle you, Od. How's the mood been around here, everything all right?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Mood and everything is well enough. Our ranks swell with Shades moved by the tale that the Princess of the Underworld has returned, with vengeance on her mind.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Nothing like a bit of sworn vengeance to inspire the masses. Though, what about you?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Everything's shipshape with me; especially after a brief reprieve right here. Be well, Goddess.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You, too.\"\nAbout Pressure.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"How did you manage it, Odysseus? Back when you had the outcome of a full-scale war riding on you, then a treacherous sea-journey, all with only one life to live... or so then you thought?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"For certain the one-life-to-live bit instilled in me the will to survive. Most mortals cling to life, but I was better than most at rejecting my doubts. And when my plans all fell apart, I improvised...!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"Your \"plans fell apart? How did you avoid becoming distraught? Keep all your doubts at bay in the face of failure?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"It's that I always relished finding a way out. No matter what I'd gotten myself into. Treating my predicaments as mazes to be navigated, puzzles to be solved...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"But at times there are impasses; outcomes that simply cannot be achieved...\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Nay, Goddess. Not if you ask me.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Odysseus : \n\"You asked before about how I managed it... the pressure to always prevail through what, in retrospect, were... many \"terribly exciting \"scenarios, all whilst bearing the burden of so many others' expectations and my own.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You said you always believed there was a solution, a positive outcome that could be discovered and achieved... I've been thinking about that.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Good. But, it occurred to me there's something else. 'Twas love that drove me on. The great war that earned me my place in Elysium... I wanted \"desperately \"not to go. To stay with my wife and then-newborn son.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You were left with no choice but to fight. So you held to hope that someday you'd see your family again...\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Sound familiar, does it?\"\nGifts.\n&lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Hey Odysseus, got you something here I wanted you to have. For always keeping an eye out!\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Goddess, your presence alone is all I could ask. Though, if you're in a giving mood, then perhaps you'll accept a small gift from me, in turn?\"\n\"Odysseus gives &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Knuckle%20Bones\"&gt;Knuckle Bones&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Your trusty Knuckle Bones? Thank you!\"\n2nd Time.\n Odysseus : \n\"I'm most grateful, Goddess, and expect to knock this back at the taverna at the soonest opportunity.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"No rush, just as long as you enjoy it when that opportunity presents itself!\"\n3rd Time.\n Odysseus : \n\"Well, would you look at that! How could I possibly say no? It seems you've found my weakness here, Goddess.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"The Great Tactician has no weaknesses, I'm sure! Though he does now have an extra bottle of Nectar.\"\n4th Time.\n Odysseus : \n\"I ought to be the one honoring \"you\", Goddess. My inclination is to save this for the moment of our victory, but it's good to have in reserve, in case of some emergency, you understand.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I understand indeed. And you already honor me with your friendship, Odysseus. As well as with your knowledge about how to deal swift death!\"\n5th Time.\n Odysseus : \n\"Oh I see what you're up to, here, Goddess. If you continue to exploit my weakness to this stuff, I may yet learn to turn it to a strength. Good plan!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"What can I say? I learned from the best. May you grow stronger and stronger.\"\n6th Time.\n Odysseus : \n\"You know, I journeyed far and wide throughout my mortal days. Met great mortals and even greater gods. But never could I have imagined ending up here, only to receive such a handsome gift from one such as you.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"They say life takes strange turns, and so apparently does death, Odysseus. Whatever the Fates may have in store, I hope you'll always be nearby to lend your counsel.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Ambrosia/Hades%20II\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"If you're not too caught up in your reports right now, what do you say we put this bottle of Ambrosia to its proper use?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"I \"am \"caught up in my reports, Goddess! Focused on what matters most... meet you at the taverna.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"...We mortals had what we called \"wine\", an acrid sort of drink made of crushed \"grapes\". We'd sometimes say it tasted as good as Ambrosia, but... it most certainly did not.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You speak of so many hardships from your mortal days and nights and yet, there's always this sense of longing there... you miss those times, don't you?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"...Such moments and occasions do occur. I know a lot more \"now \"than I did then, and... sometimes I miss that feeling... knowing less. Or the camaraderie of sailing with my crew.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"But many of your crew are with you here now, right? Even the Shade of your old dog. How can you miss them if they're still around?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"We're Shades, Goddess, and... not all quite as whole as I. Besides, you still can miss your past with those you still know now! Remember when you used to play at hiding with our good witch, back when you were very small?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I never thought that we were playing; she was teaching me to hunt for unseen prey. But, I \"do \"see your point.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Well my original point was merely that this Ambrosia's \"really \"something else! Let us ensure it does not go to waste.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"I'd not realized how much I needed that. It's true what they say, that Ambrosia tastes much better in good company.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n&lt;a href=\"Bath%20Salts\"&gt;Bath Salts&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I was just thinking nothing clears the mind like a refreshing, burning-hot soak. Care to accompany me?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Look, I do love a good hot bath, even whilst dead, and I am not one to say no to goddesses, so, \"erm\"... why not!\"\n Odysseus : \n\"My eyes are properly averted, Goddess. That I swear.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Would mortals often \"bathe\", Odysseus?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Oh! \"Erm\", well... most of them would bathe, from time to time, though... seldomly together, like this. Men with women... it could be... untoward.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I see. We gods have no such shame, I realize. Have I made you uncomfortable?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"\"Me? No\", no no, Goddess, of course not, \"no! \"In fact I've bathed with goddesses before, it's just... it's been a little while.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Well... as long as it's agreeable for you.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"It is! Agreeable, it is.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Well! Don't know about you, but I am properly relaxed, I'd say!\"\n2nd Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Hey I was thinking I'm due for a good boil in the springs. Join me for a bit?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"A visit to the baths, with you, right now? \"Hah! \"Sure! I'm honored to accompany you, Goddess.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"I trust the temperature is to your liking, aye?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You've met many goddesses even in your mortal days, haven't you, Od?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"In this I'm very fortunate, indeed. The lady Athena often watched over me. I'd never have survived the war if not for her. Then, on my travels home, there was Calypso... and Circe... a witch, not unlike you.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Circe used to study under Headmistress, always with her crystals. And Calypso... she's a nymph, correct? A lesser goddess I suppose.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Nothing lesser about her, with respect. These goddesses, the hospitality they showed me, why... it almost made me forget myself... forget my family.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"But you did not forget. You made your journey home. Even I know the tale.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"It's a tale, Goddess. Anyway, life takes its complicated turns. Take it from me.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"That was a splendid and much-needed time. Truly appreciate the invitation.\"\nGift Decline.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Maybe some other time.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Odysseus, how about alleviating the rigors of all this tactical planning with a visit to the springs?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"\"Erm, \"I really do appreciate the offer, Goddess, just... I think your Headmistress would rather I stay here. You understand, don't you?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Twin%20Lures\"&gt;Twin Lures&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Got these Twin Lures, Od, and I can't exactly use them on my own. You know the rules!\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Fishing! \"Ah\", my greatest weakness, Goddess! The waters and I have never mixed too well. But then, who am I to say no to you? Besides, I'm overdue for a short leave I think. Let's go!\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Used to be I fished out of necessity alone. The earth would oft be stingy with her bounties, whilst the sea would yield plenty to us mortals, if we knew where to look.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"What's been the biggest difference for you since those times? Not having to eat for sustenance? Not having to watch your mortal body slowly fall apart as you grew older?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"\"Heh\", well! You already know a couple of the points if for some reason we were tasked to make a list, but... the biggest difference, if I had to choose, is that... I finally am free.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You're free? But as a mortal, weren't you a king? A mighty warrior, leader of men... and a husband, and a father! Here you have a place of honor, too, except... we dwell in shadows. Our deeds are never to be told.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Well, we shall see about that last bit, but for the rest! Perhaps I got all of the wanderlust out of my system whilst I lived and breathed. Most of it, anyhow!\"\n Odysseus : \n\"I thoroughly enjoyed our outing, though I still thoroughly hate fish.\"\nGift Decline.\nTBA"}

The gods wielded the &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Arms\"&gt;Infernal Arms&lt;/a&gt; which gave them an advantage over the titans. Chronos and his ilk were ultimately defeated and sliced into many pieces which were cast off in &lt;a href=\"Tartarus\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt; so that they could never regenerate again.\nAfter the war, Zeus, Poseidon and Hades drew lots to divided the world. Zeus gained the Heavens and Poseidon the Seas while Hades received the Underworld.\n&lt;a href=\"Hades%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"Hades\", Zeus, Poseidon, Demeter, Aphrodite, Ares, Athena, Artemis, Dionysus and Hermes help &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; in his attempts to escape out of the &lt;a href=\"Underworld\"&gt;Underworld&lt;/a&gt; by providing their boons to him as they believed that he wanted to join them on Mount Olympus unaware that he was actually searching for his mother, &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the epilogue, they continue to help Zagreus on his new job of testing the defenses of the Underworld.\n&lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the events of the game, the Olympians lost contact with Hades and his family. At first, the gods assumed that Hades was just in one of his foul moods but found it strange that neither Persephone or Zagreus reached out to them. To their horror, they discovered that Chronos had returned and taken control of the Underworld. Chronos opened the gates of the Underworld allowing the &lt;a href=\"Shade\"&gt;dead&lt;/a&gt; to roam free which caused many of them to swear allegiance to him and attack Mount Olympus with &lt;a href=\"Prometheus\"&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt; leading the assault of their home. The Olympians managed to repel the constant assaults from the forces of Chronos, but this has only turn the war into a stalemate as the gods are too busy with the defense of Olympus and are unable to reach the Titan in his new domain.\nWhile searching for a possible advantage over their enemy, Artemis and Hermes discovered &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;the Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; and with it &lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;, the second child of Hades and Persephone. Hecate made them keep Melino\u00eb's existence a secret from the other Olympians until she was ready to face Chronos.\nAfter Melino\u00eb had completed her training, Artemis told Apollo about Melino\u00eb who then proceeded to inform the rest of his family.\nIn \"Hades II\", Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Hestia, Athena, Aphrodite, Apollo, Artemis, Dionysus, Hephaestus and Hermes help Melino\u00eb in her attempts to defeat Chronos by providing their boons to her as they see her as their hope to end the Titan.\nAres is currently the only Olympian that doesn't provide his boons as he has gone missing."}

{"id": "416", "revid": "29110118", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=416", "title": "Orpheus", "text": "Orpheus is a legendary musician. During his life, he lost his wife and muse &lt;a href=\"Eurydice\"&gt;Eurydice&lt;/a&gt; and ventured to the Underworld to plea for her return. Although he was ultimately unable to bring her back to life, he charmed &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; with his music such that after his death, Hades employed Orpheus as his court musician. However, because he has lost his muse, he is unable to bring himself to sing, though he may be persuaded otherwise. \nCharacteristics and Personality.\nA legendary musician, unfortunately, the loss of his wife and musical partner &lt;a href=\"Eurydice\"&gt;Eurydice&lt;/a&gt; deprived Orpheus of any desire to sing, he charms and brings to tears those who listen to him. No one sings a sweeter and sadder song than him.\nDespite his reputation for singing sad songs, Orpheus is kind, empathetic, and very friendly, being a good listener to &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;. Incredibly, the melancholic Orpheus wasn't always like this; he was full of life and passion for music. However, after his dramatic loss, he became completely devastated and unmotivated to sing, adopting a more bitter and dark personality.\nPoor Orpheus is usually sad and depressed, having completely abandoned his craft after the loss of his muse. Despite still playing and singing, his music sounds more like a personal lament. However, after hearing the epic narrative told by Zagreus, he becomes super inspired and creative, quickly composing a song about it, even though it was just a prank by &lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Zagreus brings news of Eurydice for the first time, and that they can still be reunited, Orpheus doesn't seem to care and prefers to relive his tragic memories, perhaps out of masochism or because it fuels his creativity. Zagreus is quite perplexed by this, but Orpheus actually feels this way because he believes he failed her completely and thinks she's better off without him. In the end, despite both being stubborn about your feelings, Zagreus helps him reunite with her and his mood starts to improve.\nPhysical description.\nOrpheus' appearance as a &lt;a href=\"Shade\"&gt;Shade&lt;/a&gt; is characterized by pale, sunken skin and extremely unruly dark-green hair. He always has a downcast expression, emphasizing his somber presence. According to &lt;a href=\"Eurydice\"&gt;Eurydice&lt;/a&gt;, this is a relatively younger look for him, as she remembers him having curly hair and a nice tan when they were together, much to &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;' surprise.\nHe wears a light purple vest with blue buttons. He wears a brown shawl with golden lining above it, coming from his left shoulder and circulating around his legs. He has some crossed green bracelets on his left wrist, a golden headband and his golden belt is decorated with blue and golden accessories. His nails are purple and he has dark strikes coming down from his green eyes; he also appears to have eyebags. In his right hand, he carries a golden lyre with blue details and three faces engraved in it; it also has some nature motifs in it, such as leaves and tiny flowers.\nHistory.\nPast.\nOrpheus is a legendary musician who once ventured into the underworld to try to retrieve his wife &lt;a href=\"Eurydice\"&gt;Eurydice&lt;/a&gt; after her untimely death. Although he failed, he was hired by &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; to be the court musician.\nHades.\nBy the time of the start of the story, Orpheus has been sent to Tartarus for refusing to sing given his grief, thus not doing his job as court musician. Zagreus is very upset over this, believing it to be an unfair punishment. Hades eventually brings him back to House, and if Zagreus offers him some Nectar, Orpheus will slowly start to sing again.\nDuring his escape attempts, Dionysus will ask Zagreus to play a little prank on Orpheus to lift his spirits. In doing so, Orpheus will compose the \"Hymn to Zagreus\", which is filled with the lies and nonsenses the prince fed him. Zagreus tries to explains it is all untrue, but Orpheus feigns ignorance, believing the prince is simply being benevolent and thanks him for the inspiration.\nZagreus comes into contact with Eurydice, transmitting that information to the musician. Glad to know his wife is doing well, Orpheus is nonetheless hurt to know he is a touchy subject to her, but understands. Upon learning she has created a new song, he requests the prince to retrieve a sheet with it, so he can sing it too. Zagreus is able to obtain the music sheet and hand it to Orpheus, who adds it to his reportory, but sings it slightly differently from Eurydice.\nAfter much back and forth, Zagreus is able to rewrite Orpheus's contract, allowing the musician to visit his wife in Asphodel from time to time.\nEpilogue.\nOrpheus can be seen either in the House or be found in Asphodel with Eurydice, singing together.\nAppearance.\nPrior to the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;\", Orpheus was locked into solitary confinement by Lord Hades due to his refusal to sing. His sentence can be revoked by purchasing the Court Musician's Sentence (which costs 1 &lt;a href=\"Diamond\"&gt;Diamond&lt;/a&gt;) from the &lt;a href=\"House%20Contractor\"&gt;House Contractor&lt;/a&gt;. Once revoked, Orpheus will immediately appear in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt;.\nAffinity.\nIf given &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;, Orpheus will give you the &lt;a href=\"Distant%20Memory\"&gt;Distant Memory&lt;/a&gt;. \nAfter giving him at least 1 , Orpheus will begin to sing again, citing &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus'&lt;/a&gt; determination as inspiration despite the loss of his muse. Thereafter, Orpheus may occasionally be heard singing when Zagreus returns to the House.\nOrpheus' affinity gauge is maxed out at 8 hearts.\nFavor.\nOrpheus' favor is earned by voiding his contract, which allows him to visit Eurydice in Asphodel.\nAs you deepen your relationship with both Orpheus and Eurydice, Zagreus will ask Eurydice for a copy of her song, Good Riddance, which he will share with Orpheus. After receiving the song, Orpheus will begin singing it in the House. After several more conversations with both, Eurydice will begin a meeting with:\n\"What happens now, hon...? What I mean is... now you got me thinking about Orpheus again, so... what am I supposed to do with that?\"\nTo progress further you will need to have:\nAfter finding the document in the Admin Chamber, speak to the House Contractor to purchase the Singer's Gamble for 3 .\nThe next conversation you have with Orpheus will earn his favor and complete the Musician and Muse prophecy in the &lt;a href=\"Fated%20List%20of%20Minor%20Prophecies\"&gt;Fated List of Minor Prophecies&lt;/a&gt;."}

Another most heroic feat of yours, and truth be told I find it quite inspiring.\"\n Zagreus: \"Inspiring enough to... make you want to sing, again?\"\n Orpheus: \"Oh, that's a rather bold insinuation, Zagreus. I don't know that I've the will for that, I... just, I need some time to think, is that all right?\"\n Zagreus: \"Of course!\"\n - \"After reaching &lt;a href=\"Asphodel\"&gt;Asphodel&lt;/a&gt; and finding &lt;a href=\"Eurydice\"&gt;Eurydice&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n Orpheus: \"Pray tell me something, Zagreus. How is she lately, hm? Eurydice, I mean. Her hair, fall colors, or full bloom? Her poise, as proud and supple as the oak?\"\n Zagreus: \"She's all right, Orpheus. Seems comfortable within her little place in Asphodel. The only thing that seems to bother her at all is... when I mention you. Is there nothing you can do to \n patch things up?\"\n Orpheus: \"Alas, I cannot change the past, my friend. So, no. As you can plainly see by now, I'm dead to her. Rightfully so, at that.\"\n Zagreus: \"But that's just a technicality! I mean, you're here, she's there! So what if you're not breathing anymore, you have all eternity ahead of you. Don't you want to see her again?\"\n Orpheus: \"Don't I want to see my Eurydice again...? Why, yes. That, more than anything, my friend. Provided she wanted to see me. I tried once to disturb her everlasting rest, as you well know. \n And that did not pan out as I had hoped...\"\n Zagreus: \"You're not making this easy, Orpheus.\"\n - \"After finding &lt;a href=\"Eurydice\"&gt;Eurydice&lt;/a&gt; again.\"\n Orpheus: \"I must confess something to you, my friend. My mind still wanders to Eurydice quite often, and my memories of her. Despite my best attempts to move along with my existence here. I would \n call it a fatal flaw, except, I am already dead.\"\n Zagreus: \"Don't torture yourself, mate. You've been through enough. As has she! You still care for one another just don't have a way to get the point across. But I have an idea.\"\n Orpheus: \"I, too, once had ideas, Zagreus. Ideas, and inspirations.

Eurydice never blames her husband, but he insists on punishing himself. Eurydice claims to be okay with herself and how things ended, but only because she is being stubborn. Deep down, both still deeply love each other, but they are both persistent and don't want to give in. Zagreus realizes this and has the opportunity to reconcile the two and make them a functional musical couple again.\nHouse of Hades.\nHades.\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;: Orpheus's boss.&lt;br&gt;When Orpheus came to rescue his muse, Hades struck a deal with him. Eurydice could return with him on one condition. Orpheus would fail the condition, resulting in Eurydice staying in the Underworld. Later when Orpheus died, Hades took pity on him and made him the official court musician. However, he could have done this because he liked Orpheus\u2019s singing, as evident when he repeatedly asked him to sing. Hades throws him in solitary confinement when Orpheus refuses to sing due to a broken heart but lets him stay as the court musician when Zagreus bails him out.\nZagreus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;: Prince of the Underworld.&lt;br&gt;Zagreus becomes captivated by Orpheus' laments and decides to help him reunite with his beloved Eurydice. He is surprised when Orpheus says that he should not rescue her because she is better off without her incompetent husband, even though Orpheus' exaggerated melancholy for her makes him more creative in composing, and he will prefer to torment himself for the rest his immortal death.\nOlympian Gods.\nApollo.\n&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;: Orpheus's former music mentor.&lt;br&gt;Orpheus explains that it was through his music teacher, Apollo, that he learned to play the lyre with such mastery. Although Apollo took the credit, he says it was mostly because of himself as he practiced tirelessly day and night.\nHermes.\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;: God of Swiftness\nIt was Hermes that guided Orpheus and Eurydice out of the Underworld, and upon Orpheus's failure, brought Eurydice back down. Orpheus never mentions him or his help, but Hermes comments on his musical abilities, praising them.\nDionysus.\n&lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;: God of Wine.&lt;br&gt;Dionysus proposes to Zagreus to have some \"harmless fun\" with Orpheus by tricking him into believing in an epic narrative where he and Zagreus are one and the same. When Zagreus does it, Dionysus has a good laugh. Orpheus later composes a song about it called the \"&lt;a href=\"Hymn%20to%20Zagreus\"&gt;Hymn to Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

{"id": "737", "revid": "40879385", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=737", "title": "Pact of Punishment", "text": "The Pact of Punishment is a contract provided by &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; for the purpose of making &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus'&lt;/a&gt; escape attempts even more difficult while earning valuable rewards. In a regular playthrough (save file), the Pact will only appear after the Final Boss is defeated at least once, and Zagreus has claimed victory. When he inevitably returns to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt;, the Pact of Punishment will block the open window in the courtyard, allowing Zagreus to customize aspects of his run before he leaves. In &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Mode\"&gt;Hell Mode&lt;/a&gt;, the Pact is available from the start and in fact cannot be fully disabled.\nConditions.\nThe Pact of Punishment features a total of 15 (16 in &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Mode\"&gt;Hell Mode&lt;/a&gt;) different conditions which can affect an escape attempt. Most of these have differing levels, allowing Zagreus to further increase how effective one condition is.\nEach Condition in the Pact of Punishment is worth a certain amount of &lt;a href=\"Heat\"&gt;Heat&lt;/a&gt;. The amount of Heat displayed in the gauge on the left of the Pact's UI represents the \"total difficulty\" of the conditions chosen.\nChoose your conditions for a run carefully. Many of the conditions can be nearly ineffective against one particular weapon build, but extremely difficult to another, yet can also run into unexpected difficulties (or lack thereof) based upon a run's Boons. The prophecy &lt;a href=\"Fated%20List%20of%20Minor%20Prophecies\"&gt;Harsh Conditions&lt;/a&gt; requires you to completely clear a run with each of the conditions in place, but the condition only needs a single rank active in it, and they do not need to be done all on the same weapon or within a single run.\nAdditional Information.\nConvenience Fee.\nAffects all items from &lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;'s Shops, &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Charon\"&gt;Wells of Charon&lt;/a&gt;, with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Diamond\"&gt;Diamond&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Titan%20Blood\"&gt;Titan Blood&lt;/a&gt; offered in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Styx\"&gt;Temple of Styx&lt;/a&gt;.\nExtreme Measures.\nAffects one boss for each level. At Level 1, it only affects &lt;a href=\"the%20Furies\"&gt;the Furies&lt;/a&gt;. At Level 2, it also affects the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Hydra\"&gt;Bone Hydra&lt;/a&gt;. At Level 3, it also affects &lt;a href=\"Theseus\"&gt;Theseus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Asterius\"&gt;Asterius&lt;/a&gt;, including Asterius's solo appearance as a mini-boss. At Level 4, also affects the &lt;a href=\"Hades%23Extreme%20Measures\"&gt;Final Boss&lt;/a&gt;. See the appropriate pages for details.\nIf Zagreus has not encountered all three of the Furies, Extreme Measures is hidden and cannot be selected. Extreme Measures Level 4 (Extremer Measures) can only be purchased from the &lt;a href=\"House%20Contractor\"&gt;House Contractor&lt;/a&gt; after the main game is completed and the Final Boss is fought an additional time.\nBenefits Package.\nAffects armored enemies, granting them one additional perk up to a max of 2 per level. The perks are:\nMiddle Management.\nAdds a unique effect to each and every mini-boss Encounter.\nMini-bosses summoned by the Final Boss during his boss fight also receive the extra abilities mentioned above.\nUnderworld Customs.\nZagreus must use the &lt;a href=\"Pool%20of%20Purging\"&gt;Pool of Purging&lt;/a&gt; provided in the staircase room between region to purge at least one Boon. He still receives the normal amount of Obols in exchange.\nIf Zagreus does not have any Boons, he can proceed anyway.\nTight Deadline.\nAfter the time runs out, Zagreus takes 5 damage every second while the timer is running. That damage cannot be reduced in any way, not even by invulnerability.\nWhen Zagreus enters a new biome, Tight Deadline will add the stipulated duration to the timer.\nThe timer will pause:\nChambers where Zagreus must survive for a set duration against continually spawning enemies will not appear while Tight Deadline is active.\nRoutine Inspection.\nZagreus does not start with any uses of Fated Authority or Fated Persuasion, though if he gains dice through &lt;a href=\"Chthonic%20Key\"&gt;Chthonic Key&lt;/a&gt;s with the Fated Keys work order, the talent selected by the Mirror still determines which one he can use.\nIf the Mirror of Night has not been fully unlocked, Routine Inspection is hidden and cannot be selected.\nPersonal Liability.\nOnly available on a &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Mode\"&gt;Hell Mode&lt;/a&gt; file.\nRewards.\nDefeating the Final Boss at certain Heat thresholds (8, 16, and 32) unlocks special rewards - though much to the disappointment of Zagreus (and perhaps also the player), these \"rewards\" are merely cosmetic statues of &lt;a href=\"Skelly\"&gt;Skelly&lt;/a&gt; to display in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt; courtyard.\nIn addition, powering the Pact up to 5, 10, and 15 Heat will allow Zagreus to access the &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Gate\"&gt;Infernal Gates&lt;/a&gt; that lead to Erebus in &lt;a href=\"Tartarus\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Asphodel\"&gt;Asphodel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Elysium\"&gt;Elysium&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.\nBounties.\nIn addition to the rewards above, completing the game with active Heat will award Zagreus with bounties. Each boss slain at (or above) a Target Heat value will drop a &lt;a href=\"Diamond\"&gt;Diamond&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Titan%20Blood\"&gt;Titan Blood&lt;/a&gt; which Zagreus can spend back in the House of Hades. After defeating the Final Boss and achieving victory at the target Heat value, the target will be raised for future bounties.\nBounties and Target Heat are tracked independently per weapon.\nThe limit for bounties is 20 Heat, with 21 completed runs that need to be completed to collect all bounties. In Hell Mode, bounties start at 5 heat, and the limit is increased to 25 Heat.\nBounties can only be collected once per weapon, per boss, per Heat level. So for example, once a player has defeated the Furies on 3 Heat with the Sword, they will no longer be able to collect a Bounty from defeating them with the Sword until they also defeat the Final Boss. However, the player can still collect a Bounty for defeating the Furies with a different weapon.\nYou can only claim rewards for the lowest Heat you have not yet completed, even if you defeat a boss at a higher heat (e.g If you have not yet beaten the Final Boss on 2 Heat for the Rail, then you go through and defeat them using 5 Heat, you will claim the remaining rewards for 2 Heat, and your Target Heat for the Rail will go up to 3). The Bounties for 0 Heat are tracked separately, and cannot be claimed by clearing on a higher heat."}

{"id": "896", "revid": "54583845", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=896", "title": "Patroclus", "text": "Patroclus was a warrior in the Achaean army during the Trojan War and was &lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt;' life-long companion and romantic partner. He currently resides in &lt;a href=\"Elysium\"&gt;Elysium&lt;/a&gt; and is one of the few shades there who does not attack &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;, instead offering an assortment of items, much like &lt;a href=\"Sisyphus\"&gt;Sisyphus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eurydice\"&gt;Eurydice&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is possible to interact with Patroclus many times without properly learning his name, even if he comes up in conversations with Achilles. Until his name is revealed, either by reading his &lt;a href=\"Codex\"&gt;Codex&lt;/a&gt; entry or via other means (such as speaking to him with Achilles' &lt;a href=\"Myrmidon%20Bracer\"&gt;Myrmidon Bracer&lt;/a&gt; equipped) he will be unable to receive &lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;gifts&lt;/a&gt; and will generally respond to Zagreus coldly or bitterly. \nCharacteristics and Personality.\nPatroclus, the forgotten one, is a former elite warrior who fought in the Trojan War and achieved eternal paradise in &lt;a href=\"Elysium\"&gt;Elysium&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; encounters him, he can be found meditating in his monotonously infernal paradise.\nUnlike many of the other shades residing in Elysium, who are utterly obsessed with endlessly fighting amongst themselves in the hopes of gaining eternal glory, Patroclus shows little to no interest in engaging in battle. Instead, he views the acts of extreme brutality and savagery of his fellow shades as nothing more than an embarrassment and the work of a bunch of deluded old fools desperately trying to cling to the memories of their fleeting moments of triumph, rather than that of any truly noble warriors. He bitterly concludes that Elysium was never meant for any genuinely good people. Patroclus even goes so far as to say that he would have preferred ending up in the (generally) more peaceful &lt;a href=\"Asphodel\"&gt;Asphodel&lt;/a&gt; than Elysium after death, perhaps believing that to be the true paradise.\nSimilar to his lover &lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt;, it is implied that Patroclus suffers from guilt and self-loathing for the many atrocities he witnessed and committed while alive, and when questioned about his past, he refuses to provide details about the battles he and Achilles fought in. Patroclus is indifferent, stoic, and dislikes small talk. He refers to Zagreus as a \"Stranger\" and is reluctant to engage with him, initially out of apathy. Achilles explains that this is just how Patroclus is and that he has much less flattering names for people he dislikes, so Zagreus should consider it a compliment.\nDespite being given Achilles' place in Elysium, Patroclus emotionally rejects it and almost shuts himself off, finding his time in Elysium dull without Achilles. Patroclus sits at the edge of the Lethe River, which can erase memories, and contemplates drinking more of it to forget his troubles. He has already taken a few sips, which makes him appear disoriented. He does not reveal his name to Zagreus, possibly as a personal form of escapism. However, he eventually finds the courage to leap into the abyss to retrieve his memories and confront them.\nPhysical description.\nPatroclus is an adult male with dark brown skin, with dark hair and a beard, and he often wears a pensive expression. His hair is adorned with a headband and turquoise leaves, possibly a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.hellenic.org.au/post/wreaths-of-glory\"&gt;wreath of glory&lt;/a&gt; made of laurel, and he is dressed in battle armor. His cloak (chlamys) is greenish blue, which matches with the one worn by Achilles, save for the motif on his cloak pin. His armor is separated by a belt with a Greek meander ornament, and ends in pelvic protecting elongations featuring a wave-like design. Underneath his armor he wears a white tunic (chiton) covered by a greenish blue wrap (himation) around his waist.\nHis upper right arm features a bandage and the lower one a bracelet, same as his upper left arm. He is also wearing a single bracer on his left forearm. His thighs, especially the left one, is wrapped in a strip of bandage as well. He is barefooted.\nHistory.\nBefore Hades.\nPatroclus served valiantly by the side of his beloved companion, &lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt;, their bond forged in the midst of the Trojan War. Together, they faced the perils of battle, their hearts entwined in an unbreakable unity. Sadly, tragedy struck, and Patroclus, a courageous warrior, fell on the battlefield.\nHowever, even in death, their souls could not be together. Achilles, driven by a noble impulse, without seeking the counsel of Patroclus, selflessly relinquished his cherished place in the sacred realms of &lt;a href=\"Elysium\"&gt;Elysium&lt;/a&gt;, bestowing it upon Patroclus, thus separating them.\nHades.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; can come across Patroclus's glade while going through Elysium. At first, he just finds a brooding Patroclus that doesn't even offer his name. He can learn his name by checking the codex or interacting while having Achilles's &lt;a href=\"Myrmidon%20Bracer\"&gt;Myrmidon Bracer&lt;/a&gt; equipped.\nFrom there, Patroclus will confess to feeling abandoned by Achilles and his distaste for Elysium. Zagreus, believing there's something behind the predicament between the two, works to find out and bring the two lovers together again, eventually succeeding.\nEpilogue.\nWith Achilles's contract rewritten, he is now able to visit Patroclus from time to time. Patroclus himself looks in better spirits, as he now has something to look forward to.\nAffinity.\nIf given &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;, Patroclus will give you the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Spearpoint\"&gt;Broken Spearpoint&lt;/a&gt;.\nPatroclus' affinity gauge is maxed out at 8 hearts, requiring 6 Nectar and 2 Ambrosia.\nFavor.\nPatroclus' favor is part of the &lt;a href=\"Fated%20List%20of%20Minor%20Prophecies\"&gt;Fated List of Minor Prophecies&lt;/a&gt;, much like Achilles; Zagreus has to find a way to reunite the two. At some point after Zagreus has deepened his relationship with both Patroclus and Achilles as far as possible, Patroclus will instruct Zagreus to tell Achilles to \"risk it all\". Achilles will eventually tell Zagreus to alter his contract; with the help of &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;, Zagreus will find it in the Administrative Chamber, and he can then spend 5 to modify it.\nThe affinity gauge is unlocked when Zagreus next finds Patroclus and Achilles together in Elysium."}

Yet, as fate would have it, death would be the force that would tear them apart. Desperate to ensure his beloved's eternal happiness, Achilles made a deal with the god of the underworld, Hades, that would keep Patroclus in &lt;a href=\"Elysium\"&gt;Elysium&lt;/a&gt;. But upon his own arrival in the afterlife, Achilles discovered that Patroclus was anything but content.

She married &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; and was noted to be a stately, kind woman as the Queen of the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Underworld\"&gt;Underworld&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe is &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;' biological mother but has since left for the world above. It is unknown why she left, or if she was successful in her escape, but she did not die. Had she died, she would have returned to &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;the House&lt;/a&gt; as he does via the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Styx\"&gt;River Styx&lt;/a&gt;. Following her departure, Hades forbade all mentions of her in the House, and as such she remains a figure of mystery. She is known only from a flashback sequence triggered by Zagreus sleeping in &lt;a href=\"Zagreus%27s%20Room\"&gt;his room&lt;/a&gt;, and from conversations between Zagreus and &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;. Before the events of the game, nobody in the House except for Nyx and Hades themselves knew that Persephone was Zagreus' mother; by the start of the game, everyone in the House (sans &lt;a href=\"Hypnos\"&gt;Hypnos&lt;/a&gt;) has learned that this is the case. The Olympian gods are, however, still unaware of this fact at the story's start, and do not know Zagreus' true motives in escaping the Underworld. Little is known regarding Persephone's appearance, until Zagreus reaches &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn one conversation, &lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt; mentions that Zagreus has \"her (green) eyes. One of them, anyway.\" Demeter will also confide in Zagreus regarding her daughter. She reveals that Persephone's father was an ordinary mortal and a farmer, and that she called her Kore, although she later took on the name Persephone. She left &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Olympus&lt;/a&gt; at some point in the past, and Demeter attempted to search for her in vain. Demeter seems to pay no heed to rumors surrounding her daughter's disappearance, even doubting her brother Helios when he told her that Persephone journeyed to the Underworld. On the other hand, Hades is unsympathetic to Zagreus' attempts to pry more information about his mother, although he does mention that she always despised the name Kore.\nLater, Persephone and Hades have a daughter, &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;, \nCharacteristics and Personality.\nPersephone is the goddess of harvest, daughter of &lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;, wife of &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;, and biological mother of &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;. She seems to exhibit many qualities such as her good humor, loving nature, resilience, fairness, sociability, and great courage, leaving her reign as Queen behind and her dwelling in the magnificent &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Mount Olympus&lt;/a&gt; forever.\nPersephone grew up with an excessively controlling and manipulative mother who did not let her walk on her own feet and take her own actions, so this was enough for her to crave freedom and become curious and develop an interest in knowing and living new things. She values sincerity and could not bear the constant fights, lies, and betrayals of the Olympians, which led her to hide and move to the Underworld.\nShe is considered decent company by &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;, loved by everyone in the Underworld, and they miss her very much. Persephone is very affable, but without losing her prestige, considered reliable and respectable, treating everyone as equals, praising House members for their good work. She is a good leader and could extract the best from everyone, making the dark Underworld a more productive and inviting place.\nPersephone is resourceful and adept at adapting to new situations, she has a \"green thumb\", which explains how she was able to establish herself in an uninhabited area and quickly cultivate various types of vegetables there. She is also skilled at persuading others to achieve her objectives, leveraging her charisma and previous position as the queen of the Underworld to convince the inflexible &lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt; to give her a ride to her destination, a trait that Zagreus visibly inherited from her.\nShe is very warm, affectionate, and advises Zagreus, and it is decided that she will return exclusively to him. Although she is very nice, Zagreus says that it is not a good idea to irritate her because it is implied that she inherited the powers of her mother and can be just as destructive as when she is angry.\nShe saw beyond Hades' impetuous figure and saw someone honest and fair. Persephone was like a welcoming gift to him. Neither Hades nor she were particularly pleased with this development, but they ended up falling in love, married, and had their son Zagreus, and later, a daughter named &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhysical description.\nPersephone has the appearance of a middle-aged woman. She has fair skin, green eyes, and pale blond hair. Her hair bears similarities to Zagreus' hair, and it is tied together with a green ribbon and two lavender plants are tucked into it. When on the surface, she wears a simple dress that is tied with a green ribbon. A rope is also tied in an X on her chest and on her shoulders. She also wears a green shawl, and simple golden bracelets, along with a silver one. She holds a basket full of vegetables on one arm.\nIn the family portrait, she wears a much longer dress with gold accents, a red and black detailed sash around her waist, and a green ribbon is seen. Her hair is untied, and she wears red and gold earrings that look similar to bloodstones. She wears the same fiery laurels Hades and Zagreus wears.\nAs Queen of the Underworld, her dress appears slightly longer than her normal dress. She now wears a black dress with white and gold stripes. She wears a belt with a skull with jewel eyes and mouth, and a red and gold cape-like shawl. Two skulls with golden teeth and eyes adorn her shoulders. She wears more jewelry, including a red bracelet, golden rings, golden bracelets, and a necklace bearing the symbol of Hades. Her hair is tied with the green ribbon from her surface outfit, but it is now raised similar to a bun. Her crown has a skull on top, and she wears the laurels that Hades and Zagreus also wear.\nHistory.\nBefore Hades.\nPersephone's birth was the result of an unknown mortal farmer man's union with her mother, &lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;. Due to her mortal heritage, Persephone was raised in a highly protected and supervised childhood by her mother. Tired of the constant game of lies and deceit among the &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Olympians&lt;/a&gt;, she felt an increasing desire to leave.\nAt some point, she meets and falls in love with &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;, someone her mother would never approve of as a suitor. She decides to devise a plan with Zeus to meet Hades, but to her surprise, the plan does not unfold as expected, as &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; stages a kidnapping, with Hades being the culprit. Demeter becomes so desperate for her daughter's return that she unleashes the \"Endless Winter\", causing the deaths of many mortals.\nOnce established in the underworld, Persephone served as an exceptional queen. However, she became inconsolable after the death of her son &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently abdicated her throne as the Queen of the Underworld, disappearing forever.\nHades.\nAlthough Persephone does not initially appear in &lt;a href=\"Hades%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;, she is introduced as a mysterious character whose name is considered taboo. When Zagreus discovers her existence and Hades refuses to divulge any information about her, this proves to be the final impetus for him to flee and try to find her. She is the character responsible for the entire plot of game.\nAfter the first successful escape attempt, Zagreus will meet Persephone in her secret home. Persephone does not recognize him and will react with disbelief and anger when he introduces himself as her son, telling him to leave. Zagreus says he does not care if she hates him but wants answers. She reveals that, at the moment of his birth, he had died, his burning feet sputtering out. Now believing his identity, she reacts with joy.\nZagreus tells her about his journey to the surface and informs her that Cerberus is doing well as requested by his father when defeating him for the first time. While asking him what convinced him to find her, Zagreus begins to weaken. He assumes it is the weather of the surface affecting him because he is unaccustomed to it, but Persephone explains that he is bound to the Underworld and will return there. Before he dies, she asks that he comes back, however long it takes.\nIn the next meeting, Persephone says that she never felt that she belonged in the Underworld despite the efforts of those within it to be welcoming. According to the Fates, a child born of surface dwellers could not survive in the Underworld, but Persephone and Hades attempted to have a child anyway. Overcome by grief from Zagreus emerging stillborn, she left the Underworld and began her own home \"Above the notice of the Underworld. Beneath the notice of Olympus.\"\nHades later reveals that the Fates said he would have no heir, and that it was through Nyx's efforts that he survived, likely convincing the Fates to spare him from death. Before he dies, he asks if Persephone would have returned had she known he lived, to which she responds that she would have gone through hell to see him.\nZagreus later suggests that Hades is protecting Persephone since she cannot be seen by the Olympians. She is surprised to know that Zagreus is aware of this, and later they make the conclusion that Hades believes that by letting her go will she be safe from the Olympians, who still do not know where she is, preventing a war between Hades and the rest of Olympus. As Zagreus begins to weaken, Persephone sounds regretful.\nThe next meeting starts with her requesting that Zagreus does not return to her afterwards, both for her safety and his. Zagreus is upset by this and argues with her, but she tells him that Hades must know what he is doing and that both of their safety is at risk whenever he visits. When returning in the next run, Persephone will tell him to leave again, but is stopped by him telling her that Hades still loves her. Before dying, he says that knowing she is safe is not enough and that their family is stuck together and has to work through their problems.\nAfter showing proof to her that Hades still loves her, the next attempt shows her packing her things to return to the Underworld, with Charon bringing both her and Zagreus back.\nUpon their return, she opens the gates. She tells Hades and Zagreus that she has a plan to resolve the conflict but needs them to cooperate. To keep appearances up, Zagreus is permitted to continue his attempts to escape the Underworld to find more security flaws while Persephone plans. Persephone's title also becomes Queen of the Underworld instead of Goddess of Verdure and her outfit changes.\nPersephone's plan can only begin when Zagreus has formed bonds with 5 (or 6) of the Olympians. Afterwards, Persephone will task him with sending out invitations to each one. The plan is revealed to be a party where all Olympians are invited, and she reveals herself to them. She claims to have eloped with Hades and had Zagreus, who then sought out his extended family. They would refuse this but are later moved by his numerous attempts to escape, leading to them reaching out. She leaves out the involvement of Zeus entirely. Zagreus expresses concern for Persephone's elaborate lie, but she assures him that they likely already know she is not entirely truthful but are willing to let it go to move on with no hard feelings.\nEpilogue.\nDuring the party, Persephone and Demeter spoke during it. Demeter's response was mixed, but she wanted Persephone to return to the surface and to her responsibilities. Zagreus first assumes she is leaving permanently, but she promises to return. In the next few runs, Persephone is not seen in the Underworld but will eventually return.\nBefore Hades II.\nAfter the events of Hades, Persephone and Hades were able to conceive a second child; &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;. A painting was commissioned to commemorate the joyous occasion showing Persephone, Zagreus and Hades surrounding their newest member of their family. Unfortunately for Persephone and her family, the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; of Time &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt; escaped from Tartarus. Chronos trapped Persephone and the other members of the House of Hades in time and locked them away deep within Tartarus. On Hades's orders, their daughter Melino\u00eb was taken away by &lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt; before the Titan had taken complete control of the Underworld.\nAffinity.\nPersephone can only be gifted &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt; once she returns to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt;; if this is done, she will give you the &lt;a href=\"Pom%20Blossom\"&gt;Pom Blossom&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersephone's affinity gauge is maxed out at 9 hearts, requiring the gifting of 6 Nectar and 3 &lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt;.\nFavor.\nPersephone's favor involves her asking Zagreus if she was a good mother. The affinity gauge will unlock once this conversation is triggered.\nLetter to Hades.\nInterestingly, she does not mention Zagreus in the note at all and instead wishes well for Cerberus. It is the narrator who accidentally tells Zagreus that she was related to him at all, providing him the revelation that spurs Zagreus to escape from the House. Nyx, who was left to care for Zagreus after Persephone's departure, mentions that this fact of his lineage and her and Hades' lies tell him only half the truth. Eventually, it is revealed that Zagreus was initially stillborn, and thus was not named until Nyx convinced the Fates to revive him, hence why Persephone did not mention what was, to her, a tragedy.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

It was a shock, to say the least. The others in your father's house were welcoming enough, but ... I never felt that I belonged.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"I know the feeling, I think. But you stayed. Long enough to have me. Those whom I've spoken to about you, it's as you said, they have fond memories of you. And then, you even had a child. Did Father ... did he mistreat you?\"\n Persephone: \n\"No, no. Your father could be very difficult. Though, he was gentle, with me. Soon enough, we got on fine, better than fine, at times, but ... when I was with child ... why, I struggled terribly. Because ... a child born of surface-dwellers could not live, down there.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Could not live down there, according to whom, exactly? The Fates?\"\n Persephone: \n\"According to them, yes. According to your father, and to Nyx. Even having heard ... I took my chances, anyway. But when you emerged stillborn ... it was too much. I fled. I fled, and came to reside here. Above the notice of the Underworld. Beneath the notice of Olympus.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"\"Urgh\" ... but ... why would Father lie to you? If he never wanted you ... or never wanted me ... surely he had the means.\"\n Persephone: \n\"I don't know. I'm wondering the same. But, oh, look at you, Zagreus! We're running out of time. It's happening again! Stay with me, please!\"\n Zagreus: \n\"... I'm trying ... but I can't ... stay that much longer ... I don't think.\"\n Persephone: \n\"Oh, my dear son! Then please ... ask Hades what you asked of me! Why he would lie? Tell him I must know, the same as you. And you farewell. Until we meet again!\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Until we .. ungh.\"\n3rd Meeting.\n Zagreus: \n\"Mother, I ... discovered how come Father led you to believe that I could not survive past birth. He didn't lie to you, exactly. So he says.\"\n Persephone: \n\"Wait, slow down, Zagreus, what do you mean? He told me you would not survive your birth, yet here you are. How wasn't that a lie?\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Because ... he thought it was the truth. The Fates appointed him dominion over the entire Underworld. But he would never have an heir, so he was led to understand. He never expected me to be born, much less survive.\"\n Persephone: \n\"He never expected you to survive? Then, forgive me my asking, but ... why did you? \"How\" did you? The Fates are not known for making mistakes when it comes to such things.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Nyx saved my life. Or gave me life, I guess. Then raised me in your absence. The Fates are her daughters, right? Maybe she persuaded them to go easier on me. She cannot say more. In any case, apparently it took her quite a while to revive me, and ... by then, you were gone.\"\n Persephone: \n\"Nyx ... of course she was involved. I only managed to escape because of her. Then, she restored my stillborn son to life, and nurtured him? And, I never would have known, unless that child, fully grown and having learnt the truth, defied his father, and then found me here?\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Yes. Although, we still don't know how come Father and Nyx never sent for you. Though, \"ungh\", let me ask you something Mother, if you please. If you had found out ... that I was born, and very much alive ... would you have come back?\"\n Persephone: \n\"Would I have come back ... to see my only child? Had I but known you lived ... I would have gladly gone through hell again to see you, Zagreus. Of course I would have.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Well then ... what if ... \"urgh\" ... what if Father ... didn't want you ... doing that?\"\n Persephone: \n\"What if he didn't want me coming back to him? Or seeing you? Oh no, you're fading again, Zagreus. You've pushed yourself too hard! But what is it you meant, by what you said?\"\n Zagreus: \n\"It's just ... a hunch ... of mine ...\"\n4th Meeting.\n Persephone: \n\"So good to see you, again, Zagreus. Since last you left, I couldn't help but think the worst, about what happened after I had left ... or soon before. You mentioned Nyx ... you don't suppose that she and Hades ... wanted me out of the way?\"\n Zagreus: \n\"I just ... don't think that can be. Though, let me ask you. How long did you know Father? And Nyx, for that matter? Did they seem trustworthy?\"\n Persephone: \n\"Yes. I knew them long enough to have decided yes, that they were trustworthy. As much as anyone I've ever met. But I also know never to be trusting to a fault. I have to consider the possibility I was deceived.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Especially since neither of them is being forthcoming with me even now, right? And yet, I have this feeling something else is going on, Mother. The way that Father speaks of you, the way Nyx speaks of you ... I think ... they care for you.\"\n Persephone: \n\"\"Ah, hahaha!\" Well, they have a funny way of showing it, I think. Your father, so ... you have to get through \"him\" each time you visit \"me\"?\"\n Zagreus: \n\"I do. Mother, what if ... what if Father thinks that he's protecting you? Have you ... considered that?\"\n Persephone: \n\"Protecting me? Why Zagreus, what do you mean by that? As you can see, I can fend for myself.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Well ... \"urgh\" ... you're from Olympus, aren't you. But ... the gods, none of them seem to know ... you're here ... so ...\"\n Persephone: \n\"What, how would you know something like that? Zagreus? Ah, curse the Fates, you're leaving me again ...\"\n Zagreus: \n\"I ... I won't be long ...\"\n5th Meeting.\n Persephone: \n\"Son, I have to ask you, how much do you know about your relatives upon Olympus?\"\n Zagreus: \n\"I think I know quite a bit by now. I've been in steady contact with Athena, Zeus, and other members of the family ever since I first left Father's House ... they've been assisting me in getting here.\"\n Persephone: \n\"No ... Zagreus, what have you done? You've led them \"here\"?\"\n Zagreus: \n\"No, no, they think ... they think I'm trying to escape from Father so that I can join them on their mountaintop. At least I \"think\" that's what they think. Most of them, anyway.\"\n Persephone: \n\"But then ... does Hades know of this? That Olympus is involved?\"\n Zagreus: \n\"He does. Both he and Nyx. In fact, it's Nyx who put me and Olympus into contact. I could never have broken free of the Underworld if not for their help.\"\n Persephone: \n\"So Nyx and Hades are against each other, then. And Olympus is helping you ... but they don't know I'm here, as far as you're aware?\"\n Zagreus: \n\"That's right. More or less. Nyx and Father seem to put up with each other. Don't seem to have much of a choice. Though, ever since I learned of you, Nyx has been helping me to find you ... while Father's tried to stop me.\"\n Persephone: \n\"That fool ... what was he thinking? What \"is\" he thinking ...? Do you suppose ... he thinks that he's protecting me from \"them\"? Oh, no ...\"\n Zagreus: \n\"I ... \"urgh\" ... I think maybe he does think so, indeed ... because, now having met my relatives upon Olympus, I ... can definitely see that they can be a bit ... vindictive about things.\"\n Persephone: \n\"Vindictiveness runs in the family, my son. Then, if Olympus is involved, that would explain a lot. I'm here, not there with them, as you can see. But, oh, it seems we'll have to speak some more, when next you return ...\"\n Zagreus: \n\"When I ... return ...\"\n6th Meeting.\n Persephone: \n\"I could not stand it on Olympus, Zagreus. The blustering, the posturing ... my overbearing mother ... none of it. I would have left the mountain voluntarily, except ...\"\n Zagreus: \n\"... Except Father absconded with you, didn't he? Dragged you down with him into the Underworld. So if Olympus were to find that out ... I shudder to think of the consequences.\"\n Persephone: \n\"That fool is trying to protect me even now. It wasn't he who absconded with me, my son. And it's more complicated even than that. I was content to leave. Willing to make my life within the Underworld. With your father.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"I don't not ask who \"did\" bring you to Father, then. So, essentially, you ran away from home, to live with \"him\"? I mean no disrespect, but ... did you realize what you were getting yourself into?\"\n Persephone: \n\"We have a tendency to be impetuous when we are younger, Zagreus. I'd heard all about your father before we met. Admired paintings of him. It was very awkward, at first. But he had a bluntness I fancied. A sense of principle. I much preferred him to his brothers, I can tell you that.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"So, \"urgh\" ... then you secretly left Mount Olympus to be with the god of the dead in the Underworld. And Olympus never found out. What do you suppose would happen ... if they did?\"\n Persephone: \n\"... I think ... there would be war between Olympus and your father, Zagreus, if they found out. Especially now. After all this. And after all this time. They slew their parents once. If the Titans could be wiped from this world, so can we all.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"So it makes sense ... if Father, he agrees with you, and thinks ... that leaving you in hiding here, that's the only way ... he can prevent that war ...\"\n Persephone: \n\"I can see how your father, shrewd but also single-minded as he was, might have followed such a line of reasoning as that. Oh, Zagreus ... what have I done?\"\n Zagreus: \n\"No ... what I have done ...\"\n7th Meeting.\n Persephone: \n\"Zagreus ... it's wonderful to see you, but ... I need to ask something of you. That you not visit me again, here in this place. Both for your safety, and for mine.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Wait, what? Because of what would happen if the Olympians found out? So, after everything, you're taking \"Father's\" side in all of this?!\"\n Persephone: \n\"I am. Your father is no fool when it comes to matters such as this. Besides ... all that has happened ... it's my fault. I was selfish! And now both sides of our family threaten to be torn apart.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Your fault? So let's say you never left Olympus! Then it'd be just like you thought, until quite recently, I think. That I'd never existed! Besides, they haven't found out any of this. What makes you so sure they will, all of a sudden?\"\n Persephone: \n\"Nyx may be veiling you from them as she veiled me when I fled here myself. But even her own powers aren't infallible. Each time you visit me, you are incurring risk. One small slip, and they shall find me. Discover your deception. Go home, Zagreus. Please.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Go home \"with\" me, Mother! You came here under false pretenses. I haven't fought all this way, over and over again, only to turn back now. I need you in my life! How can you just ... turn me away like this?\"\n Persephone: \n\"Oh, Zagreus ... I cannot return. After all that happened between Hades and me, and everyone, I just cannot fathom the idea. Besides ... the risks we're taking would be even greater if Olympus were to find me there, with him. And you.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Then ... \"ungh\" ... you're just ... going to stay here? Alone, in the middle of nowhere, in this little garden ... forever? After we part ways, just like that?\"\n Persephone: \n\"My son ... I know you've made hard choices and sacrifices to be here with me. And I'm forever grateful to have finally met you. But this is my home, now, yes. While your home is below. Please, if not for your sake, then for mine ... do not return. I love you, Zagreus. Good-bye.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Mother ... I ... blast ...!\"\n8th Meeting.\n Zagreus: \n\"You can't do this to me, Mother. You said Father is no fool, and neither are you. There has to be a way to fix this. Not just with you and Father, but with everyone. There has to be a way!\"\n Persephone: \n\"... You have your father's stubbornness. Listen to me. You're endangering everything you care about by coming here. Don't you understand? Besides ...\"\n Zagreus: \n\"What? Besides what? Tell me, please.\"\n Persephone: \n\"... The truth is that I like it here, Zagreus. I have done well for myself on my own. And your father, he has his domain to look after. The feelings he once had for me ... feelings we shared ... they fade, with time. You'll understand, someday.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"\"No!\" I won't be understanding anything of the sort. Father still loves you. I'm sure of it! And, he owes you an apology, damn it! I cannot make amends with you on his behalf. It's something only you can do together.\"\n Persephone: \n\"What do you mean he still loves me, Zagreus ...? How would you know?\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Because ... \"ungh\" ... I'm his blasted son, that's how I know! But \"trust me\" isn't ever good enough, I know that, too. I'll prove it to you, Mother! Just you wait and see.\"\n Persephone: \n\"You're fading, Son ... you don't need to prove anything to me. Please don't do anything rash. All of us made our choices. Now we have to live with them. Isn't it enough, to know that I am safe? That I'm content to be alone?\"\n Zagreus: \n\"No ... \"urgh\" ... it's not ... it's not enough, for me, because ... this blasted family ... it cannot just keep hiding from its problems! Running from them! We're stuck with one another, we ... we have to do everything we can ... for one another!\"\n Persephone: \n\"I ... oh, my dear boy ...\"\n Zagreus: \n\"We ... have to ...\"\n9th Meeting.\n Persephone: \n\"... Of everything down in that gloomy House, I miss old Cerberus the most, I think. But, I miss other things as well. The lack of light was gentler on my skin. Not being as cold. And Nyx, and her young sons. It was all very odd, but ...\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Mother ... in Father's bedchambers ... mind you, there's almost nothing there, just neatly sorted rows of all his samey capes ... but on his nightstand ... is a portrait of \"you\". Wearing a regal crown of red laurels. A Queen. \"His\" Queen.\"\n Persephone: \n\"I was fitted for those garments when I first arrived. They ... were not my customary style. So Hades has a portrait of me, still. Why would he put it back on display, now?\"\n Zagreus: \n\"No, no, he's never let anybody in his bedchambers! I broke in. Don't you see? He didn't put your portrait back on display. It's always been there! Ever since you left. So, Mother, why do you suppose he would do that?\"\n Persephone: \n\"Because he ... because he loves me still. Is that what you want me to say?\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Have you ever loved him, yourself?\"\n Persephone: \n\"All I really wanted was to leave Olympus. I didn't exactly abscond. I doubt I had much of a choice, but I went willingly. Perhaps Zeus knew how I felt, and thought he was doing me a favor. As for Hades ... I grew to love him, yes. He always gave me my space.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Won't you ... \"urgh\" ... won't you please talk to him? Or visit Cerberus again, or Nyx? As for Olympus ... surely all of you ... can figure something out ...?\"\n Persephone: \n\"... I just don't know, my son. Olympus is behind me. And the Underworld ... I cannot imagine I would be very welcome there after all this time.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"But ... you are ... the Queen ...!\"\n10th Meeting.\n Zagreus: \n\"Mother, wait, what is all this?\"\n Persephone: \n\"Oh, Zagreus, I almost missed you. Truthfully, I hoped that I could make it a surprise ...\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Make what a surprise?\"\n Persephone: \n\"My arrival. I'm going. To your home. To Cerberus. Nyx. Your father.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"You're ... \"really?!\" Mother, you're, you're serious?\"\n Persephone: \n\"I am. Now if you could just help me pack up my remaining things? Only a few loose odds I'm bringing, just in case. If we hurry, maybe you could join me, rather than return the customary way. Not something a mother ever wants to see.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Join you, but ... wait, how are you going to get back? I ... hadn't thought that far ahead.\"\n Persephone: \n\"Just so happens I know somebody who can give us a ride.\"\n\"A bell rings and Zagreus turns to see Charon waiting by his boat\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Charon?!\"\n Persephone: \n\"Doubtless he has pressing matters to attend to. So let's not keep him waiting any longer, Son. Come on, then!\"\n\"Zagreus and Persephone take a seat in Charon's boat\"\n Zagreus: \n\"\"&lt;Sigh&gt;\" ... I'm still alive ... but, how?\"\n Persephone: \n\"You're on the River Styx. No longer in the mortal realm, entirely.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"I can't believe that this is happening.\"\n Persephone: \n\"I know. My heart is racing. Nothing like a river journey to remind oneself that there's no turning back.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Seriously. Though, even after all of this ... it's like we only just met. I have so many questions for you still.\"\n Persephone: \n\"We'll have plenty of time for them, I think! For now, best we keep quiet. Pretend we're just a couple of dead souls on their final voyage.\"\n&lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt;.\n Zagreus: \n\"We're here!\"\n Persephone: \n\"We're here ...!\"\n Zagreus: \n\"This is embarrassing, but ... I don't know the way to get back in. Except, you know, the customary way.\"\n Persephone: \n\"That's quite all right; I do. \"In the name of Persephone, the Queen!!\" Open the gates!\"\n\"The gate opens and Zagreus and Persephone enter her Underworld garden\"\n Persephone: \n\"... I spent many days tending this garden ... or nights? Quite difficult to tell time here. But, it's held on longer than I would have expected ...\"\n\"Cerberus barks and Persephone see him standing with Hades\"\n Persephone: \n\"&lt;Gasp&gt; Cerberus ...?\"\n Hades : \n\"... Persephone ... I ...\"\n Persephone: \n\"Cerberus! I missed you so. And dutiful as ever, aren't you.\"\n Hades : \n\"... I'm sorry. Know that I am sorry.\"\n Persephone: \n\"Hades ... you look tired. Though, I am not the only one you ought to be apologizing to.\"\n Hades : \n\"I know. I know, I ... Why have you returned? If Olympus ... if your mother discovers what happened, not even Zeus, not even \"he\" could stop what would transpire, here!\"\n Persephone: \n\"\"Oh\", I've a thought or two about how we can settle that. Though I shall need for you and Zagreus to cooperate with me on a solution. Or, if you'd rather, I could return the way I came?\"\n Hades : \n\"A solution? What, do you intend to have them over for Ambrosia? Not even you can fix a broken family, Persephone.\"\n Persephone: \n\"You're right, Hades! I can't. Certainly not by myself. So, are you going to help me, or what?\"\n Hades : \n\"... I would do anything that you would ask of me.\"\n Persephone: \n\"Then, first, talk to your son.\"\n Hades : \n\"... \"Mm\". Zagreus? You have already met Persephone, our Queen. I expect for you to show deference to her, at all times!\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Wow, Father, you called me by my name! What is this strange sensation that I feel? Perhaps it's this \"deference\" of which you speak?\"\n Persephone: \n\"Oh, stop it, both of you. Don't make me regret this, Hades. Speak honestly with him. About yourself, not me. Go on.\"\n Hades : \n\"Yes. I ... Zagreus. I know there have been times ... when I've let my mood reflect on you. I showed very little patience. Questioned your judgement, often, when my own was flawed. Thus, I apologize to you, my son. I have no excuses. And I ask no forgiveness.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"What about the part where you lied to me about Mother, do you apologize for that? Your foul moods, and venting them on me ... I've long since come to expect that from you. And I resented you for it. But I always thought ... you're honest.\"\n Hades : \n\"Your mother did not come here willingly when we originally met. When she left ... believing you were stillborn ... her decision was final. I believed that she was better off without the lot of us, Olympus included. Deceiving both of you ... it tore against my being. But it needed to be done.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Well, you didn't need to vent all that inner turmoil onto me throughout my life. Though, I think I understand. I only wish I could have understood sooner. So, uh ... what now? I've grown so used to ransacking your domain, I think I'm really going to miss it.\"\n Hades : \n\"About that ... your \"ransacking\" revealed many flaws in our security. The types that never get into reports. Our reputation rides on there being no escape from here. Would you ... keep trying to break free? Not for my sake. But for this realm. For the Queen.\"\n Persephone: \n\"Zagreus ... If you keep fighting out of here ... it shall help keep appearances that everything is as it always was.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Question, Father. Let's say I accept. When next I reach the surface ... is it still going to be you waiting up there?\"\n Hades : \n\"Ah, boy. If you think for an instant that I shall go easier on you because of this, you'll soon learn otherwise.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"So I just battle to the surface and repeatedly kill my own father, then?\"\n Hades : \n\"You have it half-correct!\"\n Persephone: \n\"Perhaps you'll also tend to my little cottage while you're in the area? The garden doesn't take much care at all. I'd like to keep the place in decent shape. In case I cannot suffer this for long.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"\"Hahaha\", well! I guess I'll see what I can do.\"\n Persephone: \n\"Just do the best you can. And, clearly, I've work to do as well. We have a lot of it ahead of us, I'd say. So, shall we get started, then?\"\nGifts.\n&lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"\"Erm\", Mother? Was it always a custom in Father's House to secretly give Nectar to those you care about? I guess it also could have been a thing on Olympus. Look, I wanted you to have this. I'm so glad I found you.\"\n Persephone: \n\"Oh, Zagreus, you're so thoughtful, truly! Your father never permitted Nectar out in the open so I'd practically forgotten its savor. Though, just a moment, I have something for you, too!\"\n\"Persephone gives Zagreus the &lt;a href=\"Keepsakes\"&gt;Pom Blossom&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Oh, Mother, thank you!\"\n2nd Time.\n Persephone: \n\"For me? Are you quite sure? You know, this vintage must have made it all the way up from the surface, to the mountains, then to here. We've both had distant journeys, haven't we?\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Well, I, for one, am certain this vintage here has journeyed to the right place. Please enjoy it.\"\n3rd Time.\n Persephone: \n\"I must confess I do enjoy having a good bottle of Nectar, every now and then. And you appear to have a careful eye for such bottles, from what I can tell!\"\n Zagreus: \n\"My careful eye has got to be the green one, hasn't it. To having a discerning eye, Mother!\"\n4th Time.\n Persephone: \n\"Thank you very much, my son! You know, gift-giving customs of the Underworld are just so much more straightforward than the complicated social graces of Olympus!\"\n Zagreus: \n\"If there are other ways of showing one's appreciation than with Nectar and the like, well, they must pale in comparison I'm sure!\"\n5th Time.\n Persephone: \n\"\"Oh\", this is wonderful, except ... I'm wracked with guilt for having nothing much to give you, in return. You never even got a mother's love from me.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Please don't say that, it's just a gift, all right? Besides ... can't we start now? Mother and son type things. If you would like.\"\n Persephone: \n\"I'd like that even more than this fine Nectar, Zagreus!\"\n6th Time.\n Persephone: \n\"Somebody raised you very well indeed, my son. Nyx, I suppose. I'll never be half the mother she is. She's done it for aeons! While I'm only getting started.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"For what it's worth, I happen to think you're off to an excellent start. Nyx did teach me a lot. Achilles, too, and Father, in a way. But there is no replacing your presence. I felt that before we even met. And now I know for sure.\"\n Persephone: \n\"Thank you, Zagreus. Let's hope you're right. I nurtured very many plants, at least, of that I can assure you! Perhaps my gardening experience provided a bit of a head start on this whole mothering thing.\" \n Zagreus: \n\"Perhaps I am part plant!\"\nConversations with Other Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Zagreus: \n\"How has it been for you so far, Mother? Reacclimating to all this. You said before it was a struggle. Must be very strange, being back. Being in darkness all the time.\"\n Persephone: \n\"You know, I think it's gone all right so far! Thank you for asking, Son. Everyone has been quite welcoming. The darkness is a pleasant change of pace, and while this dress can be a little difficult to move in ... I quite like it.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"That's good to hear. I have to admit I was a little worried you'd be desperate to return to your cottage by now. This place can be a little much.\"\n Persephone: \n\"I'm sure it can. And I do miss my little cottage here and there, but ... I think I'm through running away. There may be times when it is necessary, of course. But no matter how far you run, it doesn't make your problems go away. You taught me that, you know.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"I did? But ... I tried desperately to run away, myself ... Oh.\"\n Persephone: \n\"Indeed.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Persephone: \n\"Were you able to make it to my cottage on the surface, Zagreus? I hope my lavender patches are doing all right.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"I, \"erm\" ... I couldn't make it all the way there, Mother. It's like ... without your presence on the surface, I'm unable to hang on for very long at all.\"\n Persephone: \n\"\"Ah\", I was afraid of that. Well, don't despair. I placed a charm upon my seedlings there that ought to keep them flourishing on their own. Your duty now is simply to escape. You keep it up!\"\n Zagreus: \n\"I will. Thank you, Mother.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Zagreus: \n\"You know, that painting in Father's ... I mean your bedchambers, it turned out rather well, didn't it? Some very talented shades around here.\"\n Persephone: \n\"\"Oh\", it's beautiful! I tried to persuade your father to hang it out in the hall but he's too coy about such things. Though, I like it where it is ... a reminder to us, every day and night.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Still can't believe he let me hold his spear.\"\nDialogue 04.\n Zagreus: \n\"So, Mother, all the pomegranates around here ... those are your doing?\"\n Persephone: \n\"Not a lot of fruit trees take to this environment, my son. Though, there's something about pomegranates! Maybe it's that their seeds so resemble the gemstones your father likes so much. Or that they don't need much water.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"... Fruit trees, huh. I grew up around all these poms and never thought much of it. Are there many other types of fruit trees on the surface then?\"\n Persephone: \n\"Well ... I suppose there are a few. But I like pomegranates most of all.\" \n Zagreus: \n\"I like them, too.\"\nDialogue 05.\n Zagreus: \n\"This garden isn't quite the sight yours was back on the surface, is it, Mother.\"\n Persephone: \n\"On the contrary, Zagreus! It has its own unique charm. As each garden does. I was impressed it wasn't left entirely to rot after my absence.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"it was totally off limits to me.

Though, let's look after it from here, shall we?\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Sounds good.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Nyx : \n\"... Persephone, my Queen ... it has been too long. Although, the passing of the time was very kind. It is an honor to see you again.\"\n Persephone: \n\"Oh, please, Nyx! No formalities between us, right? It's wonderful to see you, too, my friend. The days there on the surface, they were very different, but the nights ... I was reminded of our time together, here.\"\n Nyx : \n\"Good times, I trust.\"\n Persephone: \n\"Good times, most certainly! I try not to remember the others!\"\n Nyx : \n\"We are pleased to have you back. Although, it shall be a difficult adjustment for you once again, I fear. For all of us.\"\n Persephone: \n\"Well, having built a little house all by myself up there, I think I'm up to anything! You know what it's like.\"\n Nyx : \n\"I do.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Persephone: \n\"... So if there's anything that I can do for you, Nyx, you need but ask, all right? I plan to pull my weight.\"\n Nyx : \n\"Your services were always welcome, here. Please acclimate yourself at your own rate. I am available to answer any questions you may have at any time.\"\n Persephone: \n\"Thank you, my friend. I have to tell you ... it's good to be back.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt;.\n Persephone: \n\"...Honored to have met you, great Achilles, our royal guard! Good to know whom to turn to, should anything run afoul around here. So it was you who instructed my son in the martial ways?\"\n Achilles: \n\"Indeed, Your Grace. He was a talented student. If only you could have seen his progress. Surely you would have been very proud.\"\n Persephone: \n\"I \"am\" proud. You know, you were already quite the name back on the surface when I lived upon Olympus. I should think your legend's spread much farther still, since then!\"\n Achilles: \n\"Oh, I doubt that ... although, thank you, Your Grace.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Dusa\"&gt;Dusa&lt;/a&gt;.\n Dusa: \n\"\"Um\", it's my great pleasure to make your acquaintance. Call me Dusa, please! I, I'm your House custodian? And I am at your service! Anything you need, just call, OK?\"\n Persephone: \n\"Dusa! Wonderful to know you! This House is immaculate! Night-and-day difference from before. Now I know exactly whom to compliment.\"\n Dusa: \n\"Thank you so much! I will not let you down!!\"\n Persephone: \n\"Thank you, in turn!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Orpheus\"&gt;Orpheus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Persephone: \n\"... \"Ah\", but to think that our esteemed musician of the court is none other than \"you\", Orpheus! In matters of music, at least, Hades and I have similar tastes. Anyway, I don't mean to keep you!\"\n Orpheus: \n\"I shall be honored to perform my songs, Your Grace. And, might I add, Your Grace bears many of the striking features of your son? I understand now where he gets his charm.\"\n Persephone: \n\"Oh, you're too kind!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;.\n Thanatos: \n\"Queen Persephone. All of us, we are most pleased you're back. If there is anything that I can do to ease your acclimation to this House, you need but ask.\"\n Persephone: \n\"Why, thank you, Thanatos! I'll take you up on that if I can think of anything anytime soon. But my, you've grown! I understand you've been looking after my son, in the meantime?\"\n Thanatos: \n\"Your son, he ... is very capable of looking after himself, it turns out. Although I try to be there, just in case. Though, I must beg your pardon, Queen. Someone awaits me on the surface now.\"\n Persephone: \n\"I know how mortals hate waiting around!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt;.\n Megaera : \n\"... It was my duty to prevent him from getting farther. If I succeeded ... he never would have found you. So this once, I'm glad I failed. I hope you know that, my Queen.\"\n Persephone: \n\"I hoped, but did not know for certain till I heard from you just now, Overseer Megaera! And, if I may? I understand you have achieved an awful lot since I took my, \"erm\", leave of absence from this House. I see why Nyx and Hades put their trust in you!\"\n Megaera : \n\"Thank you, my Queen. Then, if there's anything else that I can do to help you reacclimate yourself, I'm always at your service. You are most welcome, here.\"\n Persephone: \n\"Likewise, you be sure to let me know if my son there happens to make more trouble for you than you welcome in your life. All right?\"\n Megaera : \n\"Heh. As you say.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Persephone: \n\"\"Oh\", come on, Hades! Mortals are much more resilient than that! What, you think they'll show up at your gates here, all at once? They have our family looking out for them.\"\n Hades : \n\"That is what I'm afraid of. Do you truly believe my brothers and the rest shall take the sort of care of them while they draw breath, as we do here after they have expired?\"\n Persephone: \n\"It's true we have to look out for them indefinitely, while Olympus need only look out for them for a little while. But our relatives are always watching from their mountain! And if they do turn a blind eye once in a while ... mortals aren't bad at fending for themselves.\"\n Hades : \n\"But they are never satisfied! Always begging us to provide more, and more.\"\n Persephone: \n\"They \"like\" us, Hades! They praise us, tell one another about us. What do you expect? Would you rather they forgot about us?\"\n Hades : \n\"... No. No, I suppose not. But they \"need\" us!\"\n Persephone: \n\"Well, we need them.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hades : \n\"... Well, be that as it may ... if they pester you at all, do let me know, and I shall have them dealt with quickly.\"\n Persephone: \n\"\"Oh\", Hades ... I think the shades around here have been through enough as it is! I don't them. After all the time I spent on my own, having some company has been a welcome change.\"\n Hades : \n\"You are certain all your needs have been provided for? Because if there is anything that you require ...\"\n Persephone: \n\"Require?\" Look at this place, Hades. Look at \"me!\" I have everything! And so do you. Try not to worry quite so much. And be patient with your son. That's all I ask.\"\n Hades : \n\"Persephone, I cannot promise you such things, they're ... not my strengths. Besides, I have a reputation to uphold! \"God of the dead!\" If the wretches do not fear me, or \"you\" for that matter ... what, then?\"\n Persephone: \n\"I'm not going to tell you how to balance your work, your marriage, and your parental responsibilities. I don't think anybody on Olympus or below knows quite how best to manage that. So long as we do our best.\"\n Hades : \n\"Our best ... that I can promise you.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hades : \n\"... And what of the complaints from Elysium? They wanted the lawns thoroughly manicured for their athletic contests.\"\n Persephone: \n\"Alright taken care of. Though, the flooding in Asphodel, \"hm\", that doesn't look like something we can clear up for quite some time. Fortunately, the residents seem to be getting accustomed to it.\"\n Hades : \n\"There have been fewer reports about it as of late. And what of the Satyr problem? Blasted things are rampant up there, still.\"\n Persephone: \n\"Well, they're probably contained up there, at least. And Zagreus has been keeping them in check, hasn't he?\"\nDialogue 04.\n Hades : \n\"... Sometimes, I ... still cannot believe that you are here. Returned to us. Your radiance, in all this darkness ... you must miss seeing the coast.\"\n Persephone: \n\"The coast was nice enough, Hades. But nothing is ever perfect, right? No matter how hard you try. Still ... I think we get quite close around here, every once in a while.\"\n Hades : \n\"You have taken much less time adjusting to this place than when first you joined us. Part of my surprise. I, myself, was forced to be here. I never thought anyone would come from the surface here by choice.\"\n Persephone: \n\"The heart can make us do the strangest thing, can't it?\"\n Hades : \n\"Indeed.\"\nAbout Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Persephone: \n\"Oh, Cerberus! Doubtless you deserve the biggest thanks that this House still stands, don't you? Did you enjoy the treat I brought you from the surface?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Persephone: \n\"You're such a good boy, aren't you, Cerberus? Yes you are! Guarded the place while I was out. And even let my son come visit me!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;.\n Zagreus: \n\"Mother, one thing I was wondering about was, how did you summon Charon to your surface residence? Especially without, you know, being dead.\"\n Persephone: \n\"Oh, why\u2026 he gave me his calling card after he graciously helped get me out of here the first time. No doubt at Nyx\u2019s request, but still. Never thought I\u2019d use it, but\u2026 I still kept it. Just in case.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"No idea what a calling card is, but OK!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;.\n Zagreus: \n\"Mother, just how long has it been snowing on the surface, do you know? Because, it seems to me that Demeter ... Grandmother, I should say, she ... well, it's been very cold up there each time I've been.\"\n Persephone: \n\"I was afraid of that ... I wanted to believe the snow about my cottage, it was native to the climate there, but ... seems that Mother took my absence harder than I thought. Oh, what have I done. All those poor people.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"It's not your fault. You couldn't have known. And we can fix this, right?\"\n Persephone: \n\"We can, and shall.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;.\n Persephone: \n\"Nyx has a very steady presence, doesn't she? I want to say she hasn't changed a bit since before you were born, but ... I know that she's been through a lot.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"She's always managed, and quite gracefully at that. Never seen her break a sweat over anything. Even when I confronted her about you. Though, you two seem closer than I realized, I think.\"\n Persephone: \n\"Well, your father isn't always the conversationalist, and Nyx ... she was the first chthonic god I ever met. I suppose she welcomed having another lady about the House.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"I'm sure she did.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;.\n Persephone: \n\"I always fancied Thanatos, you know. So put together and everything! I'm pleased to see you've grown so close. Things good between you two?\"\n Zagreus: \n\"They are. Thank you, Mother.\""}
{"id": "2500", "revid": "29110118", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2500", "title": "Persephone/Relationships", "text": "Family.\nMortal Farmboy.\n&lt;a href=\"Mortal%20Farmboy\"&gt;Mortal Farmboy&lt;/a&gt;: Persephone's father.&lt;br&gt;Though little is known about Persephone's relationship with her father, she says he was kind and funny to her, while she was a little terror. She also mentions thinking she'd grow old like him, believing to be closer to his side of the family only to be proven wrong as time passed. \nShe clearly loved and respected him a great deal as she idolized the farming lifestyle to the point where, after leaving the Underworld, she settled down and began living on a small farm of her own. Persephone is also the name he gave her, and she prefers it much more than her mother's Kore. \nHades.\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;: Persephone's husband.&lt;br&gt;Although Persephone had left Olympus willingly, she was technically forced to come to the Underworld by Zeus. Hades was similarly forced into the situation by his scheming brother, although they have been smitten with each other for a while. Hades did his best to give his would-be bride her space. The two would eventually come to love each other genuinely, and she brought a kinder side out of him. However, their relationship eventually faltered, largely due to the death of their newborn son, Zagreus. She left the Underworld, but did not return to Olympus, and Hades left her alone. However, Nyx pulled a favor with the Fates, and had Zagreus revived, but Hades chose to not tell Persephone in a bid to protect them from the Olympians, and concealed Zagreus' true parentage from the boy, even going so to forbid her mention in the House of Hades. When Zagreus brings Persephone back from the surface, she reunites with Hades, and the two slowly patch things up. She encourages her husband to be kinder and more patient with Zagreus, and their subjects. \nZagreus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;: Persephone's son.&lt;br&gt; Persephone spent many years believing that her son had died at birth, only to discover years later that he had been revived by Nyx when he visits her on the surface. Although she was upset that the truth had been hidden from her, she eventually comes to understand that Hades had done this to protect her from the Olympians, and asked Zagreus to stop visiting her. However Zagreus, who had come to decide he needed his mother in his life, persisted and convinces her to return to the Underworld with him. From there the two are simply grateful to have the chance to get to know each other, and work together with Hades to resolve the tension between the Olympians and the Chthonic gods. Persephone decides to return to the underworld exclusively for him.\nMelino\u00eb.\n&lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;: Persephone's daughter.&lt;br&gt;At some point after the events of the first game, Persephone gave birth to her second child, a daughter named Melino\u00eb. Their relationship is currently unknown as Persephone was imprisoned by the Titan of Time, Chronos, shortly after. However, Hades mentions how proud Persephone was when their daughter was born and the unfinished painting Melino\u00eb has shows her smiling happily at the infant.\nCerberus.\n&lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt;: Persephone's animal companion.&lt;br&gt;Persephone adores Cerberus and even wrote in her farewell note to Hades for him to take care of the dog. When Persephone returns to the Underworld, it is Cerberus she greets first (even before Hades, her own husband), saying that she missed him very much. \nChthonic Gods.\nPersephone, in her time as Queen was regarded as a fair and graceful leader to the shades and other &lt;a href=\"Chthonic%20Gods\"&gt;Chthonic gods&lt;/a&gt;, and thus is fondly remembered by many of the denizens of the Underworld. She recalls that while she was treated kindly, had felt she never quite fit in in the Underworld, but remains nonetheless grateful. When she eventually returns, it becomes a point of celebration, and she eagerly takes on responsibilities in helping Hades and Nyx run the Underworld.\nNyx.\n&lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;: Persephone's co-manager and close friend.&lt;br&gt;Persephone greatly respects Nyx, due to the kindness she shared during Persephone's time as queen of the Underworld, and for her role as Zagreus' godmother. She admits to feeling she is unable to measure up to Nyx as a mother, due to having not been present for much of Zagreus' life, but Zagreus assures her that he is happy to have both his mothers in his life. Nyx is very fond of Persephone, considering her to be a respectable, stately woman with a good head on her shoulders. She considers her to be a good influence on Hades and Zagreus, and was instrumental in reuniting the family, something that Persephone is also grateful for.\nCharon.\n&lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;: Stygian Boatman.&lt;br&gt;A kinder side of Charon can be seen when he secretly helps Persephone herself to enter and exit the Underworld, crossing the River Styx. Previously, he also recruited &lt;a href=\"Skelly\"&gt;Skelly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt; to help Zagreus and Persephone reunite in secret.\nThanatos.\n&lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;: Death Incarnate.&lt;br&gt;Thanatos is the son of his co-manager and best friend Nyx. Their relationship isn't very clear, but it is understood through dialogues with Thanatos that Persephone was a queen admired by all, and Thanatos is no exception. Persephone makes a comment about him, admitting that Zagreus has much better taste in men than she does.\nMegaera.\n&lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt;: First of the Furies.&lt;br&gt;Their relationship hasn't been explored yet, but it's evident that she was popular in the underworld, even with Megaera.\nDusa and Skelly.\n&lt;a href=\"Dusa\"&gt;Dusa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skelly\"&gt;Skelly&lt;/a&gt;: Duty-Bound Gorgon and Training Dummy.&lt;br&gt;Their relationship wasn't fully explored, but employee comments suggest that Persephone treated everyone well in the underworld. It's highly likely that they all still miss her. Furthermore, the dedication and devotion of Dusa and Skelly were evident as they devised a plan to bring her back.\nOlympian Gods.\nPersephone did not get along with her fellow &lt;a href=\"Olympian%20Gods\"&gt;Olympian gods&lt;/a&gt;, due to their constant squabbling and scheming. She was so fed up with them, that when Zeus took her to the Underworld, she would have gone willingly, although she admits she probably did not have a choice in the matter regardless.\nDemeter.\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;: Persephone's mother.&lt;br&gt;Persephone calls her overbearing, controlling (implied to be somewhat similar to the relationship Zagreus and Hades shared) and one of the reasons why she decided to leave Olympus. She spent years avoiding Demeter and the other Olympians, due to the potential ramifications of what could happen if they discovered that Zeus had taken her and she married Hades. It is repeatedly suggested that should Demeter discover the truth about Persephone's abduction, it may lead to war between the Olympian and Chthonic gods, or even the Olympians themselves given Zeus' involvement. When she returned to the Underworld, Persephone discovered the eternal winter her mother had placed upon the Earth. Meanwhile, the loss of Persephone had changed Demeter, turning the once generous goddess of season cold and vengeful. Once Persephone announces herself to the Olympians (with a slightly altered retelling of the events that had transpired to suggest that Persephone had simply run off), Demeter is simply relieved to know her daughter is alive, even if she doesn't approve her husband of choice. \nFrom there, Persephone and Demeter reach an agreement where Persephone must spend six months of the year on Olympus, and spend the rest of her time with her husband and son. Humbled by having lost her daughter before due to her harsh treatment, Demeter seems to have softened up on Persephone significantly and, whenever Persephone is in the Underworld, regularly asks Zagreus to send her regards.\nZeus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;: Persephone's brother-in-law.&lt;br&gt;He's the only one who knows why she disappeared because he was the one who kidnapped her in the first place and has no intention of letting Demeter or the other Olympians find out. He even goes along with Persephone's lie that she ran away with Hades just to keep that secret. Persephone admits to Zagreus, that when Zeus took her to the Underworld, she would have gone willingly, although she admits she probably did not have a choice in the matter regardless.\nHermes.\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;: Persephone's foster cousin.&lt;br&gt;He knows all of Persephone and Zeus' plan. He helped her return to the Underworld again, and he's also hiding the fact that Charon was the one who arranged for him and Skelly to help Zagreus find her. After it's decided Persephone is to spend half the year on Olympus, Hermes is the one who guides her there."}

During &lt;a href=\"Odysseus\"&gt;Odysseus&lt;/a&gt;'s journey, he and his crew entered a cave filled with provisions that belong to Polyphemus. The cyclopean caught them and ate some of the crew but Odysseus managed to trick Polyphemus by getting him drunk and blinding him which allowed him and his crew to escape.\nHe appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;\" as the boss encounter of the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Ephyra\"&gt;City of Ephyra&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nPolyphemus is a Cyclops with tremendous physical strength. However, since his eye was gouged out by Odysseus, he's \"blind\" with rage. Though he still misses it, his heightened sense of smell and hearing compensate; he still seems unsure about his sight and adorns himself with fake eyes. If anyone startles his sheep, he'll destroy everything in his path.\nDespite being brutish, he has a special fondness for the sheep and can be quite gentle, guiding them well. He has absurd laws to protect them. He is very naive and believes literally in everything. Easily prone to explosions of anger and quick to be irritated by anything, devoid of emotional intelligence, he doesn't mind acting like an animal. Apparently, Polyphemus hasn't learned that it's wrong to eat people and goes back to sleep.\nHe displays an affable exterior, willing to converse with passersby and even to thank them for any service they provide him. However, this courtesy is tempered by his hunger for flesh, which he will satisfy with barbaric force; he nearly devoured Odysseus's entire crew in the past. Nevertheless, he seems to have a minimal sense of humanity, saying that it would be strange to devour a \"relative\".\nPhysical description.\nAlthough Polyphemus is a cyclops, the distinctive single eye of his race is concealed beneath a blindfold with a blue eye drawn on the middle. However, his towering stature and sharp teeth still betray his monstrous nature. He has a curl of pale green hair on his forehead, and similar green hair on his forearms and under his arms. He wears a tunic lined with sheepskin and a crudely made woolen mantle which appears to have been made by sewing entire sheep together, given that one of them is still alive and occasionally blinks. His chest is bare, but similarly to his blindfold, there are painted on his pectorals, perhaps invoking the Nazar amulets. He's also seen holding a sheperd's crook comically undersized for his stature which his portrait is seen picking his teeth with.\nHistory.\nPast.\nPolyphemus was a shepherd who lived on an island with other cyclopes. When &lt;a href=\"Odysseus\"&gt;Odysseus&lt;/a&gt; and his crew landed on his island during their journey back home from the Trojan War, they became trapped in his cave, and Polyphemus ate some of his crewmen. To escape, Odysseus jabbed Polyphemus' one eye out with a sharpened stick while he was drunk. After that, he stopped actively seeking human prey.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt; fooled Polyphemus into thinking that he was his father. Polyphemus later discovered this deception, and was relieved to find out that he was not related to the gods.\nHades II.\nWhen Chronos launch his war against the Gods, Polyphemus allied with him. Polyphemus moved into the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Ephyra\"&gt;City of Ephyra&lt;/a&gt; after the forces of &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt; drove out the human inhabitants, and began grazing his flock in a field in front of the city's harbor. This brought him into conflict with the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;, who passed through that field on her way to &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Mount Olympus&lt;/a&gt;."}

You'll eat dust!\"\nAbout Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;.\n Polyphemus : \n\"Hey what's your beef with Chronos, anyhow? He wants to change stuff up a bit, so what. Life's hard up here. It could be easier.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It won't be. That \"town \"back there, as you call it, would have been bustling with mortals. Now it's a festering necropolis. All thanks to the Titan.\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"My sheep, they're glad to be alive. No complaints. But individuals like you? You got too many ideals. Best I \"eat \"you, and be done.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Medea\"&gt;Medea&lt;/a&gt;.\n Polyphemus : \n\"Something \"nasty \"in the air tonight. And it's not just \"you \"or the stink from town. Must be that witch up to no good. You palling up with her?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"If you know of Lady Medea then you must know she's not somebody to be crossed. She would not hesitate to curse my foes; including you.\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"Was that a threat? I think it was. You don't go saying stuff like that, not in this town. Your \"pal \"knows to stay where I can't smell her, unlike \"you.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Heracles\"&gt;Heracles&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"How is it you detain \"me \"every time, yet the mighty Heracles can rampage through the city all he likes and never has to deal with you? Or so he says.\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"It's called a \"double standard\", little sheep. Don't need my eye to know he's way bigger than you. You can knock me out for a nice short nap; he can knock me into next week. No thanks.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Odysseus\"&gt;Nobody&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Polyphemus : \n\"You know who's disrespected me like this? Nobody. Nobody took my sheep. Took my eye.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Nobody took your eye? You must have lost it. I'll keep an eye out for it! I mean... \"augh...\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"Nobody's gonna pay for all that someday. But you're gonna pay right now. \"Heh. \"Metaphorically, I mean! I'm not gonna take your money. Just gonna eat ya... bones and all.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You said nobody took your eye before, as well as your sheep. How did you lose them, then?\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"Nobody played a dirty trick on me, is how. Bunch of sailors thought they could get away with my sheep, so I ate a couple of 'em. The sailors, that is! But Nobody got me when I wasn't looking. Then he got away...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"And you've sought vengeance on this Nobody ever since?\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"Oh, not me personally! Someday, somebody's gonna get Nobody for what he did. Though, I am gonna get \"you \"right here and now.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Polyphemus : \n\"No wonder you and Nobody are pals. He and his rats are the only ones that ever got away from me, other than you. That worthless good-for-nothing put you up to this?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"His name is Odysseus! He's a great hero and tactician, though you needn't worry about slaying him, for he's long dead already. Not your problem anymore.\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"Not my problem, I'm not so sure. You and the dead seem to go hand-in-hand! Don't care what he's callin' himself now, he's \"Nobody \"to me. Now how 'bout I send him a \"message?\"\nDialogue 04 (Keepsake).\n Polyphemus : \n\"\"&lt;Sniff, Sniff&gt; \"I never forget a scent, you know. And you got something that's familiar to me from way back when. I know those Bones. \"Nobody \"had 'em before you.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You must mean these Knuckle Bones... if they've ever been a source of ill fortune for you before, then perhaps you know what's coming.\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"Nobody's your \"pal\", is that what you expect me to believe? Then first I'm gonna crush \"your \"bones, and then I'll eat 'em. And those Knuckle Bones, too.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You're very obstinate for a peaceful shepherd. Did Poseidon do something to offend you at some point? Is \"that \"what this is about?\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"Oh, I don't get \"offended... \"I get \"even. \"And you don't get to ask questions no more... you get \"eaten.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Last I'll say about Poseidon, I swear. He's my uncle, you know. For what it's worth... I'm sorry if he truly led you to believe you were his son.\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"Yeah, well, I like to play up the family resemblance just in case. Though I'm glad he's not my pop neither. Otherwise I'd be about to eat my own cousin, and that'd be real weird.\"\nAbout the Scenery.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Underworld\"&gt;The Underworld&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Polyphemus : \n\"You some kind of \"deathless goddess of the Underworld\", you said? Seems you'd be better off staying on \"your \"side of the fence.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'm here to pay my relatives a visit. You just keep getting in the way. Almost as though violence better suits you than the shepherd's life.\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"Why, you're a real thinker for a slice of meat! Just 'cause I'm retired don't mean I don't want to work up an appetite no more, does it now?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Polyphemus : \n\"\"&lt;Sniff&gt; \"You stink like the dead. But you're not from the town. You're from further below. You'd be better off staying on your side of the fence.\"\n&lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Ephyra\"&gt;City of Ephyra&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Are you the one responsible for that spectral barrier at the city gates? It has the markings of Chronos all over it, and you seem to be the extra backup in case it fails.\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"Oh that thing, yeah, I knew it'd never hold. But they keep fixing it anyway. Almost like somebody out there don't want you here...\"\nDialogue 02 (&lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Thessaly\"&gt;Docks&lt;/a&gt;).\n Polyphemus : \n\"I made those docks back there with my bare hands. Know some guys, they tally every skiff and trireme in the drink. We know where you're going.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"So what if you do? You're just another servant of Chronos. The gods shall punish you when all this is over.\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"\"Ehh\", what do you know about it? They only care about their own. I'm just a joke to them. Am I a joke... to \"you?\"\nDialogue 03 (Barn).\n Polyphemus : \n\"You went through my old barn the other night while I was out. Coulda cased the joint but you didn't. Drank from my well and that was it.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'm no thief. And besides, your residence is filthy! You could stand to clean it up instead of facing me. Let me know if you need assistance, as I'll soon be passing through again.\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"\"Nah\", thanks. If it was tidy in there I couldn't sniff my way around. And also, you \"shut up! \"I don't go tellin' \"you \"the way \"you \"oughtta live!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Thessaly\"&gt;Rift of Thessaly&lt;/a&gt;.\n Polyphemus : \n\"Where do you think you're goin', anyway? No ship that sails from the docks back there is gonna take the likes of \"you. \"Come to think of it... lately, we've had no ships at all.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"The deathless fleet of Chronos is still out there in the waters of the Rift. Apparently when one ship sinks, another rises to replace it from the depths, drowned sailors for its crew...\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"You're pulling my leg. The dead can sail nowadays? I thought they were no good for anything but food. Might have to teach 'em to take on some of my household chores...\"\nMiscellaneous Conversations.\nAbout Flock.\n Polyphemus : \n\"Can't you see I'm busy over here? Personally, I can't see a thing. Do I complain? No. I just tend my flock.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Your blasted sheep are some of the most high-strung animals I have ever encountered.\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"Sheep are fast. It's not an easy job. And it's even harder when somebody makes a ruckus in my meadow. So what choice do I have? Besides eating \"you?\"\nAbout Friendship.\n Polyphemus : \n\"You coulda had my friendship. A couple of my sheep. But instead? You spit in my eye.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I have done no such thing. I merely need access to the docks. Yet you insist on getting in my way.\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"Put yourself in my sandals. What would \"you \"do? You'd say: \"I don't like the way you're treating me. I am gonna eat you.\"\nAbout Diet.\n Polyphemus : \n\"I try to watch my diet. Three square meals, that's it. No snacks. You're making it real difficult for me.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Where I am from, we fast under the waxing moon. And we grow many nutritious plants and fungus. I could bring you some next time if you would like?\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"I can't just save you for later. You'd try to run. They always do. Oh, \"I \"know! I'll just start with the legs!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"No you won't.\"\nAbout Past.\n Polyphemus : \n\"Just wanted to be left alone. Move to the countryside, quiet life of the shepherd and all. Only for you to drag me out of retirement.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I've done no such thing. I'm going to the docks. You're choosing to try and stop me, when you could be tending to your sheep instead.\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"Oh I'll \"tend \"to them all right. But in order to do that, I got to tend to the likes of \"you \"first. Just like I used to in the good old days.\"\nAbout War.\n Polyphemus : \n\"\"&lt;Sigh&gt; \"Look, I'm just a humble shepherd trying to live in peace. But I gotta protect my own, you understand. Plus, I gotta eat.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You call this trying to live in peace?! Perhaps you shouldn't be interfering with my efforts to put an end to this war raging all around us!\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"The dead don't bother me. It's the living always been a pain in my behind. Good thing the \"living \"taste better than the \"dead.\"\nAbout Boulder.\n Polyphemus : \n\"You know I can always hear you storming through town all the way from this calm relaxing pasture. Even before my sheep get spooked.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Yes, I figured the boulders raining down back there weren't landing near me by coincidence. You have excellent hearing, and rather good aim.\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"Aw, thanks. And you got \"excellent \"taste, I'm sure. Now hold still, so I can practice my \"rather good aim \"some more.\"\nAbout Blindness.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Each time you know I'm here, no matter the softness of my approach or anything I do to mask my scent. Your senses are very keen.\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"Yeah, well, when you lose your eye... you got to learn to compensate. And I never saw too good to start with. Could never tell how far away things were.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It must have been extraordinarily difficult, nevertheless. And now you use these heightened abilities to tend your flock...\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"\"Heightened abilities\", I like that. Look, this world's a real ugly place. Difference between you and me is, I don't got to look at it no more. Now, hold still or start running... I don't even care.\"\nAbout Sheep.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"If you care so much about your sheep, why keep putting them in harm's way? Not to mention eating them. Let them leave here, now.\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"Scuse me? I didn't ask you for your shepherding advice, and besides... these sheep got nowhere else to be. And we're the \"dinner entertainment.\"\nAbout Cyclopes.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"What's become of the other Cyclopes? Your kind once aided the gods against the Titans, crafting weapons of war and such. Yet \"you \"turn your back...\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"What, you think we all keep in touch just 'cause we got one eye at most? What they did and what happened to 'em don't matter to me. 'Specially not when I'm \"hungry...\"\nAbout Insomnia.\nDialogue 01.\n Polyphemus : \n\"Funny. Running into you again and again like this? It's made for some of the best sleep I got in years.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Is that so? Well it would be even easier for me to knock you out cold if you didn't fight back.\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"\"Eh\", the fight's what does the trick. I don't give it my all, I don't get that deep relaxing slumber afterwards. Or the opportunity to get a hearty meal.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You know, if you've been having trouble sleeping, there's got to be a better solution than these repeated drubbings from me.\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"I tried a lot of stuff. Sleeping on a full stomach, sleeping on an empty stomach. Nothing worked, but this? This works just fine for now...\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; At Low Health.\nDialogue 01.\n Polyphemus : \n\"\"&lt;Sniff&gt; \"I smell \"blood. \"I was just getting ready to prepare my next meal... but the town welcoming committee must have prepped you already.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"The \"welcoming committee\", as you call it, are servants of Chronos... and shall suffer for their arrogance. You would cast your lot with \"them?\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"You know, I used to have a little trouble eating food that looked back at me, or talked back at me. But I don't got that problem no more.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Polyphemus : \n\"\"Ooh, \"I can tell the town welcoming committee must have done a number on you already. Softened you up \"good. \"All the better for \"me.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"The city's filled with the unburied dead. I can slay them but they merely rise again; they're very troublesome. The same as you.\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"Now don't you get testy. This is \"my \"pasture not yours. And every little sheep around here answers to \"me.\"\nAbout Battle (&lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;'s Loss).\nDialogue 01.\n Polyphemus : \n\"\"Ah! \"Just when I thought I had you last time, you gave me the slip. Didn't think I'd have another shot.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You'll soon have many more such \"shots. \"But you're going to fail every time, I promise you.\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"How 'bout you promise me the \"meat on your bones. \"Though I get the feeling you don't got much to offer.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Polyphemus : \n\"Don't like playing with my food. Like it even less when my food plays with \"me. \"I'm on to that disappearing act of yours.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I am a deathless goddess of the Underworld; the shadows will always take me before you will. Yet you would fight me endlessly anyway?\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"Oh yeah! Everybody slips up once in a while. Even you. And when you do... we'll find out just how \"deathless \"you are.\"\nDialogue 03 (Close Call).\n Polyphemus : \n\"Almost got me last time, but not quite. Come to finish the job? You wouldn't be the first to try. But I'm still here, and you don't see anybody else around, do ya?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Finish \"what \"job? You're not my mark. I'd just as soon slip past you and be on my way, except your blasted sense of smell and hearing are too good.\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"Why, thanks. And you know how I keep 'em top-notch like this, don't ya? When you got gifts like these, you gotta put 'em to good use.\"\nAbout Battle (&lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;'s Victory).\nDialogue 01.\n Polyphemus : \n\"Oh, \"hey! \"I wanted to say thanks. Gave me a real zinger there last time, you know that?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You're back. And you're grateful that I vanquished you earlier? You seem more the sort to hold a grudge.\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"I am, I am, it's just... I hadn't had a good night's sleep in I-don't-know-how-long. After you knocked me out cold, I woke up feeling more refreshed than ever! And real hungry, too.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Polyphemus : \n\"\"Tsch! \"Don't even try and sneak by. What, you think you were gonna catch me napping here? Not gonna happen.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It might. If you keep blocking my path, you'll get another thrashing, and you'll be sound asleep again in no time. That what you want?\"\n Polyphemus : \n\"Oh! Got a dilemma on my hands! I'm always sleepy, yeah. But I'm always hungry, too. Guess that makes this a \"can't-lose proposition.\""}

It can be recieved as a room clear reward or purchased from &lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt; for 100 .\nWhen received as a reward from an &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Gate\"&gt;Infernal Gate&lt;/a&gt;, Elite &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Styx\"&gt;Temple of Styx&lt;/a&gt; Wing, or when purchased for 300 from Charon's Styx shop, it will increase the boon's level by two levels.\nIncreasing the level of a boon will boost its power, albeit the exact effects of a Pom differ between boons. Most boons will have decreasing boosts from levels when several Poms are applied on them, usually the first 2 or 3 having the greatest effect. A few however scale linearly and the boost from levels does not fall off. However, in most boons the drop off benefit has a floor as well, so even very high levelled boons will still recieve a small boost that does not fall further.\nBoon rarity affects levels inconsistently. Most boons that directly relate to damage (be it % increases or flat amounts) will generally recieve greater bonuses from Poms if their rarity is higher, but levels and rarity do not seem to double up like usual with some support boons.\nNot all boons can be affected by Poms. Legendary and Duo boons cannot be levelled up, and some other support boons are also ineligible. Usually, direct damage, damage reduction or % damage boosts are affected, while boons that affect the duration of other effects or that have healing effects are ineligible. This however, isn't entirely consistent either.\nIf you don't have any boons, or only have boons that can't be levelled up (such as Poseidon's Huge Catch), you will instead get 115 as Spare Wealth.\nPom Slice.\nA Pom Slice is similar to a Pom of Power, in that it increases the level of one of your boons on acquisition. The primary difference is that it levels up a boon at random, rather than giving up to three choices. Pom Slices can only be purchased from Charon's shop for 50 .\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nLeveling Mechanics.\nFrom level 1 to 6, for most &lt;a href=\"boons\"&gt;boons&lt;/a&gt;, strength increases with diminishing intensity, i.e. there is a more significant boost between level 1 to 2 than 2 to 3, etc. With some approximation, the rate between level 1 and 6 can be expressed as divided by 2 every 2 levels with a starting value set. For example &lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;'s Special level 2 to 6 is +28%, +20%, +14%, +10%, +7%. Past level 6, for most boons, strength will continue to increase at a small linear value; for example, &lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;'s Strike level 5 to 6 and higher will always increase by 5% per level. Some exceptions exist, however, such as &lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;'s Doom-inflicting boons, that will continue to decrease until it will add 1 per level only.\nBoons that have low base value (Such as &lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;'s Hangover damage, &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;'s Pressure Points, or &lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;'s Glacial Glare) will increase linearly by 1 with each level from the start. A select few, such as &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;'s Aid, increase less than 1 per level.\nThe strength increase from a level is independent of a boon's &lt;a href=\"Boons%23Standard%20Boons\"&gt;quality&lt;/a&gt;, and the level of a boon is preserved when its &lt;a href=\"Boons%23Standard%20Boons\"&gt;quality&lt;/a&gt; changes.\nIncreasing a boon's level also increases its value when being sold at a &lt;a href=\"Pool%20of%20Purging\"&gt;Pool of Purging&lt;/a&gt;."}

Only &lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt; shares this trait.\nPoseidon's Cast boon, Flood Shot, is a frequent prerequisite for &lt;a href=\"Duo%20Boons\"&gt;Duo Boons&lt;/a&gt;, making it a notable choice for those that are prioritizing their Cast.\nHis signature &lt;a href=\"Status%20Curse\"&gt;Status Curse&lt;/a&gt; is Ruptured, which rapidly deals damage to enemies as they move. Ruptured not only affects an enemy's movement, but also affects the movement from various other Knockback effects.\nPoseidon is one of five Olympian gods (the other four being &lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;) who will never appear in the very first run of a save.\nPoseidon returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;\" and offer his boons to &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; in her fight against &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;. His new &lt;a href=\"Status%20Curse\"&gt;Status Curse&lt;/a&gt; is Slip, which makes enemies take more damage and get knocked farther away.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nThe Sea God, Poseidon, embodies a wild, laid-back, yet reasonable demeanor, occasionally referring to himself by the title of \"Earthshaker.\" He assumes the role of a cool uncle to &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; and was among the first to offer support upon learning of his existence.\nDespite his inviting and relaxed nature, Poseidon has the power to unleash tsunamis. His receptive and rustic aura sometimes leads Zagreus to wish his father were as easygoing as his beloved uncle. However, when things get stormy, Poseidon can exhibit the worst traits of both &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;.\nLacking tact when interacting with others, yet still considering himself a \"Gentleman of the Sea,\" Poseidon lacks subtlety and tends to barge in loudly. For instance, upon seeing &lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt; and Zagreus alone, he casually remarks that he saw nothing, leaving them \"to their own devices,\" implying that the goddess has ulterior motives. This, in turn, infuriates Aphrodite with his crude interpretations. Poseidon also possesses a certain level of irony, claiming to find Theseus inconvenient, which can be quite humorous, as everyone sees him in the same light.\nComments from other &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Olympians&lt;/a&gt; indicate that Poseidon is a kind of \"friend that nobody likes.\" Most conversations about Poseidon imply that he is not taken seriously, with people mocking his \"hippie\" disposition and speaking ill of him behind his back. It is always evident, Poseidon always leaves a trace, and others will recognize his wild nature when they see that Zagreus has already received a favor from him.\nAs deep as the ocean, despite his positivity and carefree attitude, he seems to resent always being in second on the podium, suggesting that he is overshadowed by his younger brother, Zeus. However, despite his occasional bothersome, he possesses commendable qualities, he tries (exaggeratedly) to connect with his nieces and nephews, even &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;, such as his efforts to be open and welcoming to Zagreus. His words are less arrogant and more straightforward among the Olympians. &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; comments on how Poseidon was the first to leap and pledge his power over the sea. He certainly has a soft spot for Zagreus and will not be pleased if anyone dares to harm his favorite nephew.\nPhysical description.\nPoseidon is an older man, but still well-built. As the god of the oceans, Poseidon has a relaxed expression, tanned skin, a long goatee, and navy green hair that evokes waves and bubbles. He carries his verdant trident, which holds a purple pearl. Some body hair is noticeable. He wears a long scarf, and his attire consists of a turban adorned with marine imagery wrapped around his waist, with one leg prominently exposed. He wears bracelets on his arms and wrists. Poseidon wears a designer tiara adorned with seahorses, his symbolic creatures.\nIn Hades II, Poseidon's outfit changes, notably how frivolous almost every piece is now. His turban is a different one, though it maintains marine imagery, and it's held in place by a large golden belt with seahorses. His scarf has seemingly been changed for an armored one, or he has simply placed armor on top of it. He no longer uses a bracelet on his left wrist, and the one on his right is a more detailed one; the little bracelet on his forearm has also been changed to a simpler one. His crown of seahorses now has more details and he uses earings. His trident, previously clouded in shadow, can now be fully seen, but it would appear to be a different one. His trident now has a more detailed handle, the central purple pearl is gone, being traded for a small blue central pearl and two little red pearl on its sides, its tips are decorated with golden scales and have a gradient from blue to red.\nHistory.\nBefore Hades.\nPoseidon is the second son of &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt; and like his siblings he rebelled against &lt;a href=\"The%20Titans\"&gt;The Titans&lt;/a&gt;. Poseidon fought alongside his brothers and foster sisters &lt;a href=\"Hestia\"&gt;Hestia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt;, using his sword, ending their reign of terror. He would later trade his sword for a trident and asked Hades to teach him how to use it.\nPoseidon was often at odds with his family. Be it with Demeter, &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; and even Zeus. They don't like him very much, but he nonetheless tries to socialize with them.\nHades.\nPoseidon is one of the gods that comes to Zagreus' help. He's very excited to meet his nephew and actively lends his help. He portraits himself as someone very friendly and whom Zagreus would really like to meet, but the others will commonly call him out on his recklessness. He also loves to talk about fish, but mostly sticks to encourage his nephew.\nEpilogue.\nHe'll attend the feast with the other &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Olympians&lt;/a&gt;, and afterwards keeps on lending his help to Zagreus.\nAffinity.\nIf given &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;, Poseidon will give you the &lt;a href=\"Conch%20Shell\"&gt;Conch Shell&lt;/a&gt;.\nPoseidon's affinity gauge is maxed out at 7 hearts.\nFavor.\nPoseidon's favor requires using the &lt;a href=\"Fishing\"&gt;Rod of Fishing&lt;/a&gt; and successfully fishing up a minimum of 18 fish, and having at least 1 fish on your person. You can catch this fish in a previous run if you do not give the fish to the chef. \nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Well, I'll just leave the two of you alone. My lips are sealed tighter than a warship hull!\"\n Aphrodite: \n\"Oh, feel free to stay, Poseidon! I was just explaining what an idiot you are, though you're able to articulate this best!

Is that not so, Uncle?\"\n Poseidon: \n\"Exactly so, Athena! You, with that fine memory of yours! For it isn't everyday I learn my doleful brother Hades sired a fine son! He does not know how good he has it, there! And you, Nephew, could have it even better, here!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Poseidon: \n\"As you can see by now, we are a big and clever family, little Hades! My niece Athena here being the cleverest of all. You'd never know that she was childless, the way she looks after and cares for all of us!\"\n Athena: \n\"Such my cleverness comes from your brother and yourself, Lord Uncle Poseidon. And I would only add, my feeling is we've more than enough children in this family, thus no further need for more of them, for now.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Poseidon: \n\"My foster-sister Goddess Demeter, despite her stern approach, she often likes to make good sport of me, Nephew!

Don't you, young sprout?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Demeter: \n\"Ah, little sprout. I was just notifying Lord Poseidon here that all of his domain exists because it pleases me; remember, my good foster-brother, I could freeze your oceans solid if I chose.\"\nspan style=\"color:#32FFBE;&gt; Poseidon: \n\"Ah, hahahah!

You want a real feast, though, you just stick with me; now take my blessing, go!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\n Poseidon: \n\"Now, little Hades, you have met my brother Zeus! He's sometimes known as the king of all the gods! Although, in many ways, he's not as powerful as I! Nor anywhere near as dashing. Why, I, oop--!\"\n Zeus : \n\"Now, Brother, you know better than to say such things about me, I should think! I know that tact does not come easily to you, though I'd be careful what you say to our good nephew there.\"\n Poseidon: \n\"Erm, anyway, as I was saying, little Hades! Brother Zeus is king of all the gods! And the most dashing, powerful, and--hey, let's face it--godliest of all!\"\nGifts.\n&lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Uncle Poseidon, it's been excellent to know you, sir, so, please, this is for you.\"\n Poseidon: \n\"Oh I am positively moved by your affection, little Nephew!

Would that my father were as easygoing as yourself.\"\n Poseidon: \n\"Ah-hah, a show of generosity from my most favored Nephew! Your gift is mightily appreciated!! I'll just go ahead and add it to the pile.\"\n3rd Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Mighty Poseidon, greatest of my uncles, arguably, please accept this gift!\"\n Poseidon: \n\"For all the times I'm offered gifts or sacrifices, little Nephew, I still always very much appreciate it! I mean, look! I'm grinning ear to ear!\"\n4th Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Uncle Poseidon, I have a special catch for you! Although it pales next to your sheer awesomeness.\"\n Poseidon: \n\"Whaaa, now would you look at that! Is that an offering, to your most favored uncle, me? You know what, Nephew, I've decided I shall take it! Thanks!!\"\nAbout Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Poseidon: \n\"Whenever Dionysus calls a feast, I'm turning up sooner or later, hear me, Nephew? So make room for one more blessing, and, let's go!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;.\n Poseidon: \n\"Ah, you've received a blessing from Athena there already, little Hades! So careful all the time, that one, but here, I'll help you live a little, just in case!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;.\n Poseidon: \n\"Oh-hoh, so you've already heard from Aphrodite, have you, Nephew? Understandable, but first things first, now let me add a little something to all that!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;.\n Poseidon: \n\"Hoy, Nephew, it's my understanding you've been blessed already by one of my other nephews, Ares! As you can see, not all of us are cut from the same cloth; and thank the Fates for that!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;.\n Poseidon: \n\"I sense that you've been marked by the elusive Artemis, correct, Nephew?! She shies away from most of us, so if she's taken somewhat of a liking to you, great!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Poseidon: \n\"So, Nephew, my honored brother Zeus already has endowed you with his thunderous might? Well you shall soon forget about all that, after a taste of this!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Poseidon: \n\"You've come to know your Uncle Zeus, by now, correct? Just want to let you know, good Zeus gets very busy on the regular, so you just stick with me, I've always time for you, Nephew!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;.\n Poseidon: \n\"Why, little Hades, there's a certain chill about you, meaning you received an ice-cold blessing courtesy of Elder Goddess Demeter, correct? Now, personally, I think water's best in liquid form, but who am I to judge?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Poseidon: \n\"Little Hades, it appears that you are moving right along! Almost at an uncanny pace!! I wonder how you got to be so fast! Aquatic exercise?!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Poseidon: \n\"Nephew, how is it you're navigating your cruel father's realm at such a blinding speed?! There's only one Olympian who moves that quick! Besides myself! Where is he, anyway?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Theseus\"&gt;Theseus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Poseidon: \n\"So, little Hades, doubtless you have seen that we upon Olympus also lend our favour to the mighty Theseus, who bars your passage from Elysium! Now, don't you take this personally, there, because our blessings go to all who deserve them. Although, we try to save the best for you!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Poseidon: \n\"Ahh, it seems to me you've had yourself a spot of lady trouble, lately, isn't that correct, Nephew? I mean the Fury down in Tartarus, of course! You going to let her keep on bossing you around?!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Poseidon: \n\"Hah, I heard you showed that good-for-nothing Fury after all, I knew you'd handle that old crone, Nephew! And if she troubles you again, you just remind her who's in charge down there!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Asterius\"&gt;Asterius&lt;/a&gt;.\n Poseidon: \n\"Ohh, Nephew, you've stood against the Bull of Minos, have you? Well I must apologize for any inconvenience there, because, he was a living testament to my revenge! Long story, boring really, rather sordid, too. Stay strong!\"\nBeing Invited to the House of Hades (Pre-Epilogue).\n Zagreus: \n\"All right, here it goes. In the name of Hades! Olympus! This is an official message! Uncle Poseidon, hope you can make this out.\"\n Poseidon: \n\"What's this, Nephew? Why, isn't this a note? Or, part of one, addressed to me, but it appears there should be other pieces, for the others here? Ah, it's like a sunken treasure, then! Which means I must seek its mysteries at once!\"\nPost-Epilogue.\n Poseidon: \n\"You know, Nephew, I had a positively raucous time down there, with your old father, and Persephone, was she a sight! I never thought I'd see her again! So then, we're one big happy family, at last! But you've a job to do, and we upon Olympus, we'll do our fair share!\""}

She never favors \"me!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;.\n Poseidon : \n\"\"Ah\", you seem lovelier than ever, Niece! As though the splendrous Aphrodite herself bestowed to you her gifts! She did so, didn't she, the scamp!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;.\n Poseidon : \n\"You've met the brilliant Apollo, have you, Niece? He's near as popular with mortals as am I!

And now her fiery ability is yours!

To which she threatens to freeze my oceans! To which I apologize profusely, and we move on!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;.\n Poseidon : \n\"\"Whoa\", my niece, you seem possessed of an uncanny haste! Such swiftness as to be the envy of that rascal Hermes, who as per usual is nowhere to be found. Some messenger \"he \"is!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Selene\"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt;.\n Poseidon : \n\"You're shining like the Moon herself, my niece! Selene's aid, is it?

Although it also took the wisdom of my noble brother, Zeus, who formed our plan! We've quite the plan this time as well, don't we, Brother?!\"\n Zeus : \n\"Oh, Poseidon, always raring to go. A good plan needn't be discussed out in the open. For now, young Melino\u00eb? We offer you that combined might of ours! Please complicate things for our foes, would you?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus : \n\"Melino\u00eb, one tidbit you ought to know about our side of the family is, while we may not agree on each detail, in the end, we always find ourselves on the same side of every challenge that we face. Isn't that right, Brother?\"\n Poseidon : \n\"Oh, absolutely, Lord Zeus! When you get down to it, our clan is of a single will! Although I guess, you \u2014 \"w-w-we \"don't count Chronos in that estimation, do we, now? He's technically family, but very much opposed to everything we stand for!\"\nDialogue 03.\n Zeus : \n\"We are as one big family upon Olympus, and we pride and celebrate our differences. So many varying perspectives to account for at all times! Although Poseidon here, we always manage to see eye-to-eye, don't we...\"\n Poseidon : \n\"Oh that we \"do\", most certainly, Brother! Not always right away, and there are some occasions when I might decide elsewise if it were solely up to me, but even \"still! \"You always have your head up in the clouds, where smart ideas form!\"\nDialogue 04.\n Poseidon : \n\"The only greater strength than that belonging to Lord Zeus, my niece, is his combined with mine! Lightning can surge across my waters even faster than it ravages the land! And now, my kingly brother and I grant our terrifying might to you!\"\n Zeus : \n\"We \"lend \"our terrifying might to you, that is, Melino\u00eb.

Now go and use our united strength to take back what's ours!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Poseidon : \n\"\"Ahoy\", my little niece, I'm here with the spectacular Queen Hera, fairest wife of my distinguished brother, and all that! Shame I have never found myself a perfect mate as she! \"You\"'d bless us if I did, wouldn't you, Hera?\"\n Hera : \n\"\"Oh\", I'll assuredly bless you \"and \"your beloved mate whomever they may be, Poseidon. Perhaps when all of this is over, you may resume your search in earnest! But until such time, get your mind out of the gutter.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hera : \n\"A shame you never knew your father, girl... but at least now you know his good brother Poseidon, here! Imagine this one, but without the foolish grin, nor the inappropriate remarks, with frankly better hair, in finer physical form.\"\n Poseidon : \n\"\"Ah, hahaha! \"See how strong a family we are, my niece?! For even in the face of such catastrophe as we have all endured, the Queen herself is able to make such humorous remarks! At my expense. But \"still!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Poseidon : \n\"When battle rages all around, there's little time for love, little room for beauty! Yet Aphrodite here, she never loses heart! It's almost precious how she strives with all her might, brandishing that decorative spear of hers!\"\n Aphrodite : \n\"Well, good Lord Poseidon, I'm pleased to know how I inspire you. Though perhaps you ought pay more attention to our \"foes \"than to what I do with my spear, so we can turn this battle in our favor, finally!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Aphrodite : \n\"I used to think your Lord Uncle Poseidon was a rude and useless oaf... but, after having seen his fighting prowess in this war firsthand, I've come to realize how wrong I was! He isn't useless in the least!\"\n Poseidon : \n\"Why thank you, Aphrodite! For I know how challenging it is for you to fathom the totality of my strength, as let's face it, you're not exactly the goddess of wisdom! \"Nor am I! \"And we have other common ground, in the \"beauty of the sea!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Poseidon : \n\"Have you yet come to know golden Apollo, Niece? He's so well known and loved among the mortals that he had no choice but to involve himself in our most recent family affair! Bending to mortal pressure like a bow, \"hah!\"\n Apollo : \n\"Oh, come now, Uncle, I don't yield to pressure quite so easily. I just knew this situation would be more than you could handle on your own! We're not just family, we're a team, aren't we?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Apollo : \n\"Cousin, our uncle and I were just debating what to do about mortals who turned their backs on us... I think a year or so of plague should settle up the score! But, Lord Poseidon here thinks it's more important to \"go big...\"\n Poseidon : \n\"Why would you \"not \"go big, given the choice, my delicate nephew?

Isn't that right, dear foster-sister?\"\n Demeter : \n\"Oh, Poseidon! You needn't lie to young Melino\u00eb like that.

Let me know should you ever find one. Now... \"we \"here best get back to hammering things out.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Proud family, this one! Uncle Poseidon here forgoes full armor on account that he's too quick and too thick-headed, \"erm... \"thick-\"skinned\", I mean to say. Ain't that the case, Uncle?\"\n Poseidon : \n\"Come, Nephew, you know how much I value your craft! Even if I'd not be caught \"dead \"wearing much of it myself! It's just, only a \"coward \"goes to battle clad in plating head-to-toe; a coward far more likely to withstand his wounds, but \"still!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hestia\"&gt;Hestia&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Poseidon : \n\"I have known Hestia practically since the cataclysmic day that I was born! Although when things are normal we avoid each other at all costs, she's like an old, wise sister to me at this point, and I am glad she's here! \"Right \"here!\"\n Hestia : \n\"You \"best \"be glad I'm here, you lug! Lest I leave all of you again to fend for your own damn selves. You won't be putting Chronos back into the ground without me, anyhow! That goes for you, too, hot stuff.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hestia : \n\"Take our blessings but \"don't \"follow our example's what I say, dearie. A case in point's fish-faced Poseidon over here! Always trying hard to make a splash, \"never \"caring much who ends up getting wet. That about right, you big oaf?\"\n Poseidon : \n\"Quite on the contrary, dear Hestia! You're wrong at least on two accounts I think: First, I need never \"try hard \"to make a splash! I effortlessly do it every time. And second, don't you call me \"fish-faced\", you mean wrinkly old hag, \"ha-hah!\"\nAbouth the Scenery.\n&lt;a href=\"Oceanus\"&gt;Oceanus&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Poseidon : \n\"Where are you, Niece, the bottom of the sea?! Or very close to it! Must be even darker than what you're accustomed to. And the \"terrible \"pressure! Not even \"I \"can stand it for too long! So how can \"you?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Poseidon : \n\"Your father never told me that his realm had all those twisting passageways right next to my domain! A \"drainage system \"of some sort, is it? Pouring right into my waters? Oh, I'd have words for Hades about \"this!\"\nDialogue 03.\n Poseidon : \n\"Those watery horrors you face... I just want you to know, they're not my fault!

It near resembles some of Demeter's rolling fields of grain! Who knew old Hades had a pasture growing in the Underworld, if but a rather dismal-looking one, near as I can tell!\"\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Poseidon : \n\"You made it to the surface, little niece! Too bad we couldn't scour the place before you got here, though! We're right in the middle of a big shake-up!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Poseidon : \n\"All that you look upon, both land and sea, that's \"my \"domain, you know! Long as you don't look up toward the heavens.

I thought your father's line was doomed to linger underneath the earth, something like that? Ah, how the times have changed!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Thessaly\"&gt;Rift of Thessaly&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Poseidon : \n\"Welcome to my boundless terrifying seas, my niece! Unfortunately teeming with invaders now. Got my hands full dealing with \"them\", if you must know! But see if you can break through their blockade!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Poseidon : \n\"Right on that very spot once stood a massive army headed for our mountain, Niece! So I just split the earth right under them, \"haha! \"So now we have a massive \"navy \"to contend with, and contend we shall!\"\nDialogue 03.\n Poseidon : \n\"You braved the waters in the Rift of Thessaly!

May you have smoother sailing there next time!\"\nDialogue 04.\n Poseidon : \n\"When next you sail across the Rift, know this: I shall do my utmost to ensure a water-current speeds you mightily along!

Who does that Chronos think he is, showering mortals with shiny metals?\"\nDialogue 04.\n Poseidon : \n\"I trust your Boatman there appreciates that the smooth sailing he's experienced in his mercantile routes is no coincidence at all?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; Clearing A Run (&lt;a href=\"The%20Underworld\"&gt;The Underworld&lt;/a&gt;).\nDialogue 01.\n Poseidon : \n\"Did you do it, Niece?! Strange things have happened since the other night; \"good \"things, if you are not one of our enemies! We think perhaps you cut old Chronos down to size! But he just grows right back, as I recall!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Poseidon : \n\"We've all been counting on you, little Niece, but \"still! \"I'd not expected you could take on Chronos and prevail! I thought at best you'd keep him busy for a while. You must be very strong, like \"me!\"\nAbout Family.\nDialogue 01.\n Poseidon : \n\"Our family's scattered to the winds a bit, my niece! You've heard from those of us upon this mountaintop, but Zeus sent several of his children to take care of things down closer to the base! They're probably just fine!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Poseidon : \n\"I know it can be difficult, but now we all must stand together, Niece! An uncommon family with a common goal! A crashing wave to wash away these troubled times!\"\nAbout Devotion.\n Poseidon : \n\"Ask \"any \"god upon Olympus whether we think you ought to join in our defense here, or take the fight to Chronos in your father's realm, and you'll get a \"range of views! \"A range of \"highly civil \"views, which we don't fight about \"at all!\"\nAbout In-Fighting.\n Poseidon : \n\"Remember how I said that we don't ever fight with one another on Olympus, little Niece? Well, that might have been a slight exaggeration on my part. But I stand with Hera on this one! We think your efforts are best spent up here!\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Moonstone%20Axe\"&gt;Moonstone Axe&lt;/a&gt;.\n Poseidon : \n\"I must say that's a most-substantial labrys that you wield! The Moonstone Axe, Hephaestus says? Well nothing bests a trusty trident! The tongs of this little fork of mine have wrenched free many a blade!\"\nAbout Water.\n Poseidon : \n\"Water's a fascinating substance, Niece! Cuts through the tallest mountains with sufficient time, and yet mortals need to drink the stuff to live! You're multitalented as well, aren't you?\"\nAbout Rain.\n Poseidon : \n\"Is that a bit of rainfall in your whereabouts? \"Ah\", you should see old Demeter and Zeus fight over who's responsible! I merely watch and laugh, for either way, it's more water for me!\"\nAbout Dams.\n Poseidon : \n\"You know what dams are, Niece? Ramshackle structures mortals use to hold my waters back!

Be like that water, don't hold back, all right?\"\nAbout Luxuries.\n Poseidon : \n\"A shame you had to grow up in the middle of nowhere, my niece! We gods require certain luxuries.

I know the feeling only all too well! \"Vengeance! \"As cold and dark as the bottom of the sea!\"\nAbout Pressure.\n Poseidon : \n\"Within my oceans, Niece, the deeper you go, the fiercer the pressure! It's almost like you're in too deep yourself!\"\nAbout Choices.\n Poseidon : \n\"As gods, we \"all \"must make hard choices, Niece.

What are we even fighting for, if not the right to fish whensoever we desire?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Poseidon : \n\"You know, Niece, the Cocytus River flowing through those musty woods of yours is quite the fishing-spot! You'd be doing all those river denizens a favor getting them out of there!\"\nDialogue 03.\n Poseidon : \n\"You've something freshly caught thanks to that Rod of Fishing, I can tell! I don't permit just \"anybody \"to dredge up my denizens of the deep!

Well then, what say we scour clean this little corner of the sea!\"\nAbout Legendary Boon.\nDialogue 01.\n Poseidon : \n\"No point in holding back even a smidge when we're in such a serious predicament, is there? So here, some of my raw unbridled power ought to \"tide \"you over, I should think!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Poseidon : \n\"So many of our enemies once feared us gods, but turned their backs on us! I'd say a show of overwhelming force ought to remind them who's the captain of the ship, however, no?\"\nDialogue 03.\n Poseidon : \n\"As you embark on your fateful voyage yet again, my niece, I have something for you!

You're like a proper little lady, I'm impressed!\"\n3rd Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"A little something to soothe the senses, Uncle Poseidon! I know it's hardly the occasion now, but isn't there always some cause to celebrate?\"\n Poseidon : \n\"You praise your uncle, and your uncle, why, he thinks it's really great! \"I \"think it's great, that is! That you would think of gifts in times like these!\"\n4th Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"This one's for you, Uncle! May you shake all our foes from the land, and your seas swallow them, that they rue the day they rose against us!\"\n Poseidon : \n\"Of all the many sacrifices I have been receiving as of late, and there have been a lot, yours have been the very best of all, my niece!\""}

However, there is an implication that he feels overshadowed by his younger brother, Zeus. Nevertheless, he is also clearly intimidated by Zeus. This can be seen in their Duo Boon dialogue, where Poseidon claims to be more powerful and daring than his brother, only for Zeus to subtly warn him to be careful with what he says to Zagreus, prompting Poseidon to quickly flatter his brother by proclaiming Zeus as \"the most elegant, powerful, and divine of the gods\".\nDespite these hints of toxicity, they have good cooperation as they work well together and unite against common adversaries, such as the Titans.\nDemeter.\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;: Poseidon's foster sister.&lt;br&gt;Demeter does not have a pious relationship with Poseidon. He tells Zagreus that despite his subtle approach, she enjoys mocking him. Demeter will continue to speak ill of him indirectly, telling Zagreus that he has more important things to do than listen to Poseidon. They do not share the same opinion about the weather, and Demeter probably has a long and complicated history of struggle with him.\nPoseidon sarcastically comments on Zagreus shivering after receiving his icy blessings, courtesy of the ancient goddess Demeter. He humorously suggests that while he prefers water in its liquid state, who is he to judge.\nHestia.\n&lt;a href=\"Hestia\"&gt;Hestia&lt;/a&gt;: Poseidon's foster sister.&lt;br&gt; Poseidon once referred to his foster sister as 'you mean wrinkly old hag'.\nHera.\n&lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt;: Poseidon's foster sister and sister-in-law.\nAthena.\n&lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;: Poseidon's niece.&lt;br&gt;Poseidon and Athena incredibly seem to have a positive relationship between them. She comments that, when she enlisted her family's help to help Zagreus, her uncle Poseidon was the first who jumped in and pledged his power over sea and land. Poseidon says that his niece Athena is the smartest of the family, and by the way she takes care of everyone, no one would know that she doesn't have children.\nAres.\n&lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;: Poseidon's nephew.&lt;br&gt;Both have caused wars, on land and at sea, but they have different opinions on warfare. Poseidon believes that if his nephew were not so peculiar and made an effort to be more approachable, they would have more in common. Ares is grateful to his uncle; it was Poseidon who spoke up for the god of war when he was sometimes detained and humiliated.\nArtemis.\n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;: Poseidon's niece.&lt;br&gt;She can be reserved with her family members, but Artemis doesn't like to hear her uncle talking; she will avoid Poseidon as much as possible. Poseidon, in turn, considers Artemis to be too rigid, unable to take a simple joke, and believes that her stern demeanor makes it difficult for her to attract a potential mate. He finds it gratifying that she is finally opening up and enjoying conversations with Zagreus, in addition to her nymph friends, hoping it will help her loosen up and become more approachable.\nApollo.\n&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;: Poseidon's nephew.&lt;br&gt;Their relationship is currently unknown.\nAphrodite.\n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;: The Goddess of Love and Beauty.&lt;br&gt;The relationship between Aphrodite and Poseidon is marked by her impatience and disdain towards him, and tension, lack of delicacy, and rudeness on his part. Aphrodite delivers a beautiful speech to Zagreus in which she confesses that, although each member of her family has their quirks, they always remain united and the love they feel for each other will persist until the end. However, the plan backfires when Poseidon discovers the two of them talking alone. Poseidon says he will keep his mouth shut and leave them alone, implying that the goddess had ulterior motives. Aphrodite is incensed by Poseidon's rude comment and explodes in anger in front of Zagreus, expressing her surprise at how foolish and brutish he can be.\nHermes.\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;: Poseidon's nephew.&lt;br&gt;He takes pleasure in teasing his uncle, pointing out that Poseidon granted his blessing to Zagreus before him, though only because Hermes allowed it. Hermes finds amusement in the fact that Uncle Poseidon still perceives himself as agile. Unbeknownst to Poseidon, his nephew jests about him behind his back.\nDionysus.\n&lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;: Poseidon's nephew.&lt;br&gt;Poseidon appears to have a good rapport with his nephew Dionysus, seeing similarities between them. Both are laid-back, receptive, and enjoy a good time, making them compatible companions. They share a relaxed demeanor and are open to indulging in festivities, even considering joining a feast with Zagreus. Even though Dionysus didn't hear Poseidon calling Zagreus his \"favorite nephew.\"\nStill, Dionysus appears to fear his uncle to a degree, similarly to his father, likely given Poseidon's authority and how his uncle his older.\nChthonic Gods.\nThe Gods of the Underworld.\nHades.\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;: Poseidon's older brother.&lt;br&gt;They, who were unable to escape Chronos and remained trapped in their father's stomach, share a common understanding about Zeus. However, Poseidon's reluctance makes him less likely to directly confront Zeus, unlike Hades, Poseidon prefers to align with Zeus and has less in common with his stern brother.\nWhile Poseidon enjoys his brother's company, he admits that he rarely misses him and prefers not to let his methodical and honest nature interfere with his approach to things, fearing it would drain all joy and excitement from his agited life.\nPoseidon finds the nature of Hades being reserved and reluctant to communicate disturbing, despite his brother having valid reasons for keeping things to himself. But this was more evident during Hades II. Hades's infrequent contact with Olympus meant they were unaware of his and his family's capture by Chronos until recently. Initially, they dismissed Hades's concerns due to his typical mood swings and did not realize that something worse was happening there.\nZagreus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;: Poseidon's nephew.&lt;br&gt;Poseidon is one of the first to offer his blessings to his nephew Zagreus, affectionately calling him \"little Hades\" and showing great fondness for him. He even refers to Zagreus as his favorite nephew. Throughout their interactions, Poseidon embodies the role of a caring and supportive uncle, always looking out for Zagreus's well-being and offering his protection whenever needed. Zagreus stands out from Poseidon's other nieces and nephews for treating him with the utmost respect.\nIn the second game, Poseidon mentions that Melino\u00eb reminds him a lot of his brother, expressing how both of them used to shower him with praise. He was a bit strange, but quite captivating.\nMelino\u00eb.\n&lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;: Poseidon's niece.&lt;br&gt;Poseidon is surprised to find his lost niece, Melino\u00eb, thinking that she had suffered the same fate as her father, mother, and brother. The way Melino\u00eb's compliments remind him of his brother Zagreus. Poseidon contemplates granting her blessings like the other Olympians; however, he considers her exercising a terrible vengeance for what happened to poor Hades.\nThe Titans.\nThe previous rulers of the world, defeated in the Titan War and imprisoned in the pits of &lt;a href=\"Tartarus\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt;.\nChronos.\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;: Poseidon's father.&lt;br&gt;\nHouse of Hades.\nAchilles.\n&lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt;: Forgotten Hero.&lt;br&gt;While he appreciates Poseidon's past mercy, he now finds little connection with the god in the underworld. Contemplating Poseidon's control over the sea, Achilles wonders how many of his comrades met their demise at Poseidon's hands. Despite Poseidon's outward friendliness, Achilles cannot bring himself to forgive him."}

They created the majority of the world as we know it, as well as other entities, such as &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;, that would come to rule different portions of their creations. They then stepped back and resigned themselves to the void from whence they came, deciding to be just a watcher of what transpires, causing a strain between their relationship with their daughter.\nNyx was assigned to &lt;a href=\"the%20Underworld\"&gt;the Underworld&lt;/a&gt;, which she shaped and ruled as its queen. She alone would birth a next generation of &lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20Nyx\"&gt;deities&lt;/a&gt;, each a personification of an abstract concept. Later, &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; would be assigned as King of the Underworld, letting Nyx resign from her position, but both kept a friendly and working relationship, aiding each other in the matters of the realm.\n&lt;a href=\"Ouranos\"&gt;Ouranos&lt;/a&gt;, the Primodial of the Sky, ruled the world above alongside his wife &lt;a href=\"Gaia\"&gt;Gaia&lt;/a&gt;, the Primordial of the Earth. From them both came the &lt;a href=\"Titans\"&gt;Titans&lt;/a&gt;, most notably &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;, who, tired of the constant abuse and with his mother's help, overthrew his father and took his place as the new ruler of the world, initiating thus the so called \"Golden Age\".\nBy the events of \"Hades\", most if not all of the Primordials in question have long-since chosen to quietly step down from their positions of authority and retired to their own domains effectively abandoning the world they created. One exception to this was the Primordial &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt; who continued to serve under &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; in the Underworld. \n&lt;a href=\"Hades%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"Hades\", Nyx is &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;' foster mother, having raised him in the stead of &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt; following the latter's leave. She alone confronted her &lt;a href=\"Fates\"&gt;daughters&lt;/a&gt; so that Zagreus could live, since he had died at birth initially. She was the one who contacted &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; and requested &lt;a href=\"Olympians\"&gt;Olympus&lt;/a&gt;' aid in Zagreus' plight, claiming he wished to know and visit his family up above, while in truth he is searching for his birth mother.\nZagreus can come across Chaos, who although impartial in most matters, wishes to participate in his plight and see it through. Zagreus can also help Chaos and Nyx reconnect.\nBefore Hades II.\nChronos, having been revived, wishes to overthrow his son and claim the Underworld, and then the whole world, back to himself. In this, he ends up imprisoning Nyx alongside other members of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt;. To continue his plans, he seeks out Chaos, asking for the location of the Fates, as their meddling could be his downfall like before. Chaos, unaware of the deceit, reveals the Fates locations, leading to their kidnapping.\n&lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"Hades II\", Chaos offers their aid to &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to fix what they inevitably caused and recover their daughter."}

After the war he stole the gift of fire and gave it to mortalkind, and for this act he was punished by &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; by being bound to a rock and having &lt;a href=\"Aetos\"&gt;an eagle&lt;/a&gt; eat his liver, which would regrow the next day only for it to be eaten again.\nHe appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;\" as the boss encounter of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Mount Olympus&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nA titan of foresight who is always two steps ahead. He is considered a well-intentioned, sane and intelligent &lt;a href=\"Titans\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;, but also rebellious\u2014one of the cunning figures who betrayed his peers during the Titanomachy by stealing fire from the gods under the watchful eyes of his superiors to bestow it upon humanity. This bold decision resulted in severe punishment from &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, he was hardened over time and he finds himself disillusioned with the other gods and has allied with &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;, seeking justice against those who afflicted him.\nPrometheus is calculated and resolute, always devising strategies and determining his next moves. While he acknowledges the possibility of defeat at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;, he envisions multiple potential futures and is committed to postponing that outcome in pursuit of more advantageous paths for revenge. Despite standing alongside Chronos, Prometheus is seen as wise and genuinely kind, and even some Olympians recognize that his vengeance against them is warranted. His suffering has convinced him that the Olympians are unfit to rule, but moreover has given him a personal grudge against all gods. He opposes them for the sake of mortalkind, but also vindictively, wanting them to feel the same pain he did.\nAs his struggles progress, Prometheus, though he may seem harsh, indifferent, and inflexible, remains acutely aware of the consequences of his choices. He bears the burden of guilt for his betrayal and recognizes the significance of his gift to humanity. Similarly to &lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt;, he recognizes Melino\u00eb as an \"agent of change\" who will be a decisive figure in the war. Prometheus is discreet, and even while serving Chronos, he asserts that he does not share his foresight, not even with him, suggesting that he may harbor broader and hidden plans behind his future actions.\nPhysical description.\nPrometheus has a shock of blue hair and glowing red eyes. He is powerfully built, and wears nothing on his upper body save for a bandage that wraps around his midsection, exposing his physique as well as the scar left by his torture, which stretches from his left shoulder down to his right hip. He wears loose pants and a tasseled sash adorned with &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;' hourglass icon, a headband, dangling earrings, and on his left hand, a falconry glove with a blue flame motif. His other hand is wreathed in blue flames, which he can project at will.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nPrometheus is the progenitor of all mortals, whom he fashioned from clay.\nPrometheus sided with the Olympian gods in their war against his kind, and thus was able to survive the war. He fell out of their favor, however, for his crime of stealing fire from the gods and bestowing it on mortalkind. For this transgression, he was bound to a cliff with adamant chains, and &lt;a href=\"Aetos\"&gt;an eagle&lt;/a&gt; was sent to eat his liver. Since he was immortal, it would regenerate every day, only for the eagle to return and tear him open again. Eventually, he was freed from his punishment; however, he would nurse a grudge against the gods for his mistreatment, and for their disregard of mortals. He also took the eagle into his care, naming it Aetos, and trained it to follow his command.\nHades II.\nWhen Chronos launched his war against the Gods, Prometheus foresaw his victory and allied with him.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

You must have premonitions all the time. I'd not heard you were liberated, or that Chronos is the master you serve. Solidarity between Titans, then?\" \n Prometheus : \n\"Call it a change of heart.

There are 4 available save slots and starting a new game requires you to choose one of the 4 slots to save in. You can also start a new save file with &lt;a href=\"Hell_Mode\"&gt;Hell Mode&lt;/a&gt; difficulty, but this option cannot be changed later on.\nAutosave.\nProgress is saved whenever the Hades sigil appears in the top right corner of the screen. This happens whenever Zagreus enters a new room, in the House of Hades or in the Underworld during a run.\nThe game also autosaves before generating the preview for the next chambers after completing an encounter (i.e., after accepting the room reward). This prevents savescumming to generate different rewards for the next chamber.\nGiving Up a Run.\nYou can quit the game at any time during a run by bringing up the menu and choosing 'Quit' to exit to the main menu.\nHowever, if you received any damage during an encounter, the option to 'Quit' is replaced with 'Give Up'. This means you will abandon the run and return back to the latest save when you were at the Courtyard, before you started the run. This prevents savescumming through reloading the save when you are hit. Giving up does not break your win streak.\nThe first chamber's reward will not be changed if you 'Give Up' (e.g., if the first reward is Zeus's boon, giving up and restarting the run will still let Zeus offer you the first boon, unless you use another god's keepsake. This method does not replace Deadalus Hammers if they are the first reward). Abandoning the run brings you back to the Courtyard without changing the seed for the run (the randomly-generated pool of rewards). To get a new seed, you need to be killed during the run.\nTo save your progress in that run instead of 'Giving Up', complete the encounter and enter the next room. This should let the 'Quit' option appear instead of 'Give Up', letting you exit the game with the progress saved. You can then continue from where you left off.\nThere is currently an exploit where you can unlock/upgrade Weapon Aspects or Companions in the Courtyard and bring them to a run to 'try out'. If you get hit during the run and 'Give Up', you will return back to the latest save when you last entered the Courtyard, so it will be as if you have not yet invested Titan Blood/Ambrosia to unlock the Aspect/Companion. If you won that run, you will return to the House of Hades and overwrite that save, making your upgrade permanent for that save file.\nDeleting a Save File.\nYou can delete a save file from the main menu to get an empty save slot. However, the save file actually still remains on your computer until it is overwritten by a new save file.\nIf you accidentally deleted a save file and wish to recover it, DO NOT start a new save file in that slot. Exit and restart the game. The previous save file should be retrieved, as long as you did not start a new save file in that slot."}

She finds Melino\u00eb \"ugly\" and dislikes her manners. Easily provoked, she's very offended when Melino\u00eb compares her to a mollusk. Despite her band's ironic name \"Scylla and the Sirens,\" they are her backing vocals; she treats them as her supporting. After defeating her at least once, Melino\u00eb's resentful reprimand will likely be inspired by her loss to her.\nUp to a point, Scylla becomes friendlier, genuinely happy to introduce herself to Melino\u00eb, considering her, at worst, a boring critic.

She is daughter of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Titans\"&gt;titans&lt;/a&gt; Hyperion and Theia, the younger twin sister of &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt; and the sister of &lt;a href=\"Hestia\"&gt;Hestia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eos\"&gt;Eos&lt;/a&gt;.\nSelene appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;\" and offers her hexes through the Gifts of the Moon which can later be upgraded with the Path to Stars to &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; in her fight against &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;. \nHer signature &lt;a href=\"Status%20Curse\"&gt;Status Curse&lt;/a&gt; is Morph which turns enemies into harmless critters.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nAs the goddess of the moon, Selene is dreamy, as well as affectionate in disposition. She is poetic, contemplative, and tender with &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;. She is kind at all times. As a celestial observer, nothing escapes her attentive gaze during the night.\nHer nature is primarily serene, supportive, and enchanting. Despite being associated with darkness, and despite being a &lt;a href=\"The%20Titans\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;, she stands against them. Due to her loneliness, with only the company of the starry sky, Selene is very emotional, tending to form an emotional bond guickly.\nDespite her serene and elegant disposition, she enjoys adrenaline and wild routines of rides while majestically riding her pegasi, and she thanks Melino\u00eb for being able to warm up with them once again.\nYet nothing escapes her gaze. Selene seems a bit like a stalker, enjoying observing a bit too much and becoming overly interested in others' lives, feeling too intimate, as was the case with the mortal &lt;a href=\"Odysseus\"&gt;Odysseus&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite her tenderness, she is the most powerful among the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Sisters\"&gt;Silver Sisters&lt;/a&gt;, yet the most benevolent. Other characters might say 'The moonlight guides you' as a greeting. The power of moonlight cannot be underestimated, 'the moon has its spells' influencing hearts, and she can render enemies helpless at her feet.\nDespite being a powerful Titan, her horses symbolize freedom, but her vast powers do not grant the freedom she desires. Selene is bound to follow her path across the sky every night due to her role as the moon; simply speaking exhausts her and she needs to be invoked. Thus, she feels powerless for not having helped her adoptive mother &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt; attacked right under her nose during the Saturnalia, yet she remains optimistic and and puts everything she has into Melino\u00eb.\nPhysical description.\nSelene, as the goddess of the moon, presents herself as an elegant woman. She wears a blueish-white dress alongside lots of silver jewelry with moon motifs. She uses a helmet with two spikes on which side, decorated in the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Sisters\"&gt;Silver Sisters&lt;/a&gt; colors and letting flow a white fabric strip on each side, and a full moon at the center. Her white hair flows behind her, forming a sort of cloud, and it too is decorated with a few silver crescent moons. Her eyes are of a gold color, she has light blue lipstick and uses golden crescent moon earings. \nShe rides a Pegasus, a mythical horse with wings. Hers is white with a light blue mane and, just like their owner, they're decorated with silver moons jewelry on their head. Their eyes are mostly covered by their mane, but their silver color can be slightly seen. \nAffinity.\nIf given &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;, Selene will give you the &lt;a href=\"Keepsakes/Hades%20II\"&gt;Moon Beam&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of Early Access, October 2024, Selene's affinity gauge maxes out at 4 hearts."}

Then perhaps I am too late this time. But while you still can stand, you still can harness the great power I illuminate in you.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Selene : \n\"Such injuries you have sustained already, little star. Pain, it seems, is built into the cycle of our lives. I cannot make it go away; but you may learn to set it well aside.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Selene : \n\"You are hurt; your light is waning, little star. Do not lose heart. Our light never goes out; a new moon always rises.\"\nAbout Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Selene : \n\"The Titan Chronos, he is Time itself. Thus by his nature, we can never be entirely prepared for him. He seeks the downfall of Olympus, but how exactly, we still do not know.\"\nDialogue 02 (Lost Battle).\n Selene : \n\"You have descended into Tartarus, and must have seen what Chronos made of that most-sacred place. I know your confrontation did not go as you desired, but this is a new night. And you are all the more prepared.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Fates\"&gt;The Fates&lt;/a&gt;.\n Selene : \n\"I know through your Headmistress of your vision in which Chronos found and captured the Three Fates. This must have been a key component of his plan... but, it does \"not \"change ours. The Silver Sisters never cede control.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt;.\n Selene : \n\"Nyx spoke highly of your brother to me, little star. I too am distant from my brother Helios, the Sun. Sometimes I slow my steeds to catch a glimpse of him as he engulfs the surface. I do not think we would have much to talk about.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Eos\"&gt;Eos&lt;/a&gt;.\n Selene : \n\"Perhaps some morning on the surface you shall finally see Eos, little star. She is quite beautiful, so much that mortals now admire her. But I have never known her very well. She makes her brief appearances, then she is gone.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;.\n Selene : \n\"Here in the sky, I am immune to earthly troubles, such as having to share living space with the goddess of retribution. Nemesis never treated me as a sister. She inherited only her mother's strength.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hypnos\"&gt;Hypnos&lt;/a&gt;.\n Selene : \n\"I remain troubled by the ever-sleeping son of Nyx, there in your Crossroads. Neither your Headmistress nor I have thus been able to awaken him. But every ailment must have a remedy...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Selene : \n\"Your Headmistress and I have worked together ever since Mother Nyx asked we watch over our domains, while she kept watch over the Underworld. Two Titanesses, bound by Night.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Selene : \n\"Little star, you grow in strength and knowledge rapidly. How proud your Headmistress must be that you are able to surpass her finally. Yet, we know the burden that you bear.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Selene : \n\"Of late, your Headmistress asked me, do not your rides across the sky become monotonous? I was amused to hear her jest. Each night is like none other I have known.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Odysseus\"&gt;Odysseus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Selene : \n\"You are fortunate to learn from the wanderer Odysseus. I used to follow all his mortal struggles, from his warring to his voyages. Some of the tales about him are embellished, but not all. He is an interesting man.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hephaestus\"&gt;Hephaestus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Selene : \n\"A Boon from Master Blacksmith Hephaestus is prized by warriors all the world over. To you he gives it readily, knowing Olympians alone cannot stop what has begun.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt;.\n Selene : \n\"You bear the mark of Chaos, little star. The most ancient being in existence lost a child to our common foe. Thus, the great creator becomes the great destroyer, through you.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;.\n Selene : \n\"I watched the goddess Aphrodite seek you out. From her I learned a bit of how to influence the heart. But only when my strength is at its peak, and even then, I fear I pale in comparison.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Medea\"&gt;Medea&lt;/a&gt;.\n Selene : \n\"The witch Medea learned to blot out my light, creating an eclipse whenever she required. We had a conversation after that, and all is well between us ever since. Between her curses and my Hexes... you shall be feared.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Polyphemus\"&gt;Polyphemus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Selene : \n\"The Cyclops Polyphemus, whom you faced, once hid within a cavern not even \"my \"silver light could reach. Now he has taken sides with Chronos. Too many rise against the gods...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt;.\n Selene : \n\"We shall see to it that the rightful Queen and King of the Underworld retake their throne. Your father I knew only from Nyx's account, though I would see your mother when she visited Olympus. You have her regal bearing, little star.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt;.\n Selene : \n\"Black-winged Eris has become an obstacle; she sometimes flies across my path, thus startling my steeds. I am the Eye of Night yet cannot see much worth in her at all...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Heracles\"&gt;Heracles&lt;/a&gt;.\n Selene : \n\"I saw that you encountered Heracles. Beware that man, who has made many enemies in service to the gods. He even wronged me once, and still walks brazenly as ever in my light.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Selene : \n\"I saw the great King of the Olympians already bestowed on you his thunderous strength. He would contend it is more than sufficient on its own. But we Silver Sisters four know otherwise.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt;.\n Selene : \n\"It is uncommon to have earned Queen Hera's Boon. She would confide in me sometimes while she would bathe. But she has been more guarded, as of late. As have we all...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;.\n Selene : \n\"The sea-god's strength already flows through you? Poseidon holds that he alone controls the tides. For this I cannot blame him. He does not know or understand my influence.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;.\n Selene : \n\"I see you shine already with another light. The god Apollo's doing, I should think. Fear not; his power is compatible with mine. Light envelops light, never rejecting.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hestia\"&gt;Hestia&lt;/a&gt;.\n Selene : \n\"The fire-goddess Hestia always proved difficult to track, and yet she willingly revealed herself to you? Either your reputation grows, or does the desperation of the gods.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;.\n Selene : \n\"At last you met the goddess of the seasons, whose great power often shapes the course of my night's ride. In Demeter, you have a fierce supporter, I can tell.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Selene : \n\"There is one god whose swiftness far surpasses any steed's. And he has granted some of it to you, I see. I caution you to not make too much haste. Steadfastness is the key to victory.\"\nDialogue 02.\n\"We have heard nothing from fleet-footed Hermes since he told us of our enemy's advance. Thus we strike, yet hold to faith that some night hence he shall return to us with news about what else the Titan Chronos has in store.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Selene : \n\"I held to faith your task would not require you above, only below. But Hermes indicates the threat here on the surface now looms larger than we thought. Rise to us, then; whenever Time permits.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Selene : \n\"You have no memory of Nyx? It was the Night herself who found me, discarded and unwanted, and raised me from my youth. But when the Titan Chronos took the House of Hades, she was there. I miss her still.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Selene : \n\"On nights as dark as this I think only of Nyx. She ruled the Underworld within your father's House. And she cared for me, among so many others. She knew I sought the heavens. \"Go\", she said. \"And please keep watch for me up there.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Selene : \n\"The goddess Nyx, in all her grace, began referring to me as the Eye of Night. For I could see even where she could not. This honor spurs me even now, just as I spur my steeds. We shall avenge her, little star.\"\nWith Other Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt;.\n Selene : \n\"It gladdens me to see you, Hecate. I have observed the stalemate upon Olympus holds, although the Titan Chronos musters forces in Ephyra still. Shall I continue monitoring them?\"\n Hecate : \n\"Yes, Selene, do. Blasted Ephyra is the closest exit out of here. Do you suppose they are prepared for a single assailant to weave through their ranks?\"\n Selene : \n\"The Titan's forces are somewhat in disarray. Thus no, I do not think they are sufficiently prepared for one of us. But I shall watch and make certain of it. For now I must be off. Together we shine.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Farewell. Together we shine.\"\nAbouth the Scenery.\n&lt;a href=\"Erebus\"&gt;Erebus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Selene : \n\"To have lived all your life in misty Erebus... the world is so much vaster than that place. You shall see much more of it, I think, ere your task is complete.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Oceanus\"&gt;Oceanus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Selene : \n\"I found you, though my light is but a flicker at these depths. You trace the secret path between Poseidon's and your father's realms. What lurks here has no love for either one.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Mourning\"&gt;Fields of Mourning&lt;/a&gt;.\n Selene : \n\"None of my light pierces this dismal region normally, but for you, little star? I shall not hesitate to pierce the heavens and the earth alike. Together, let us strive for victory.\"\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01 A (&lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; Hasn't Reached &lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt;).\n Selene : \n\"I welcome you to our world's surface, little star. I knew you would discover your way here. If you feel lost, you need but look to me. And I shall always be watching.\"\nDialogue 01 B (&lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; Has Reached &lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt;).\n Selene : \n\"I ought to welcome you more formally to our world's surface, little star. Part of me knew you would discover your way here. If you feel lost, you need but look aloft.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Selene : \n\"The city of Ephyra has seen so much strife. If only you could have witnessed it when its people still worshiped your mother and father. We shall avenge them all.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Selene : \n\"Here my light yields no greater strength than you experience below, for I give all I safely can wherever you reside.

I shall watch you sail on and help you make haste.\"\nMiscellaneous Conversations.\nOffering Hex at The Start of a Run (Any).\nMain Lines.\nDialogue 01.\n Selene : \n\"Another evening filled with possibility. I ride from Dawn and cannot stay for long; I see your own night's journey has begun, so let us shine together, now and always.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Selene : \n\"The dark of night begins, as does your task. And I am here to usher you into that dark, toward inevitable victory, and death.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Selene : \n\"I have arrived to join you at the outset of this cycle, to illuminate each step along your path. The path only appears familiar, so take care.\"\nDialogue 04.\n Selene : \n\"As daylight fades upon the surface, we begin to shine. I shall distract your enemies, while you press ever closer to the resolution that we Silver Sisters vowed would come to pass.\"\nDialogue 04.\n Selene : \n\"Another night now beckons, and I shall cast such shadows as to bring you strength and comfort each in turn. Choose well the magick that shall be of greatest benefit.\"\nOffering Hex Upgrade.\nDialogue 01.\n Selene : \n\"Behold.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Selene : \n\"Please make your choice.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Selene : \n\"Look forth.\"\nDialogue 04.\n Selene : \n\"The choice is yours.\"\nDialogue 05.\n Selene : \n\"Which suits you?\"\nDialogue 06.\n Selene : \n\"Now...\"\nDialogue 07.\n Selene : \n\"Your choice?\"\nDialogue 08.\n Selene : \n\"Behold my light.\nBuying Hex at &lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;'s Shop.\nDialogue 01.\n Selene : \n\"The Boatman Charon is familiar with every twisted pathway through this world. Yet, I provide for him my light nevertheless. He need not always find his way alone.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Selene : \n\"I do not care to see the glimmer of the golden coins that Charon takes from you. It is far too much like the light of day, which likewise I can stand only so long.\"\nAbout Switching Runs (&lt;a href=\"The%20Underworld\"&gt;The Underworld&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt;).\n Selene : \n\"Chronos can wait, for he is Time itself. You turn your energies instead toward his armies on the surface, and can slow him down that way. Growing stronger all the while.\"\nAbout Mission.\nDialogue 01.\n Selene : \n\"I regret our meetings are in haste, and that we are unable to converse when thus we meet. I am expected high aloft for all to see. Our connection is to remain as hidden as the Crossroads. We are to move in shadows.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Selene : \n\"Our charge as Silver Sisters is to work in shadow to uphold the will of Night. Olympus remains unaware of us; that their own Goddess of the Hunt is one of us; that their own Messenger serves us as well. Let us keep it this way.\"\nAbout Backstory.\n Selene : \n\"Long have I been the Eye of Night, watching you grow and train in secrecy; knowing that upon some evening such as this, we Silver Sisters would make our stand. Shall we go?\"\nAbout Speech.\n Selene : \n\"All beings struggle to communicate. I learnt from Nyx how to express myself, as you, from your Headmistress. Our speech is rooted in the past; our connections, tenuous.\"\nAbout Weapons.\nDialogue 01 (Aspect of Eos) ).\n Selene : \n\"You bear the Flames of Ygnium, but in the guise of Eos. My sister, in her youthful ignorance, knows nothing about this. May she enjoy her morning rides until a distant age.\"\nDialogue 02 (&lt;a href=\"Sister%20Blades\"&gt;Sister Blades&lt;/a&gt;).\n Selene : \n\"I see often the gleaming Sister Blades within your grasp. I knew eventually that they would reawaken and accept you as their bearer. May their swiftness overwhelm your foes.\"\nDialogue 03 (&lt;a href=\"Moonstone%20Axe\"&gt;Moonstone Axe&lt;/a&gt;).\n Selene : \n\"You wield the Moonstone Axe, whose broad blade shimmers with my light. Then you must hear the song it sings. Such strength, combined with yours.\"\nDialogue 04 (&lt;a href=\"Umbral%20Flames\"&gt;Umbral Flames&lt;/a&gt;)1.\n Selene : \n\"The Umbral Flames suit you quite well... so much akin to the twin torches of your Headmistress, however old they are. In any form, a guiding light is welcome company.\"\nDialogue 05 (&lt;a href=\"Argent%20Skull\"&gt;Argent Skull&lt;/a&gt;).\n Selene : \n\"You now possess the Argent Skull Revaal... an everlasting reminder that Death and Fear ought always to be allies in our cause. Woe unto whomever meets her gaze.\"\nAbout Lunar Cycle.\nDialogue 01.\n Selene : \n\"We breathe, we bleed, we rest, we start anew. Did we create this cycle, or are we merely part of it? Sometimes I ask myself this question while I ride.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Selene : \n\"Let us begin another cycle, little star. Each has its unexpected qualities, but in the greater pattern lies a certain pleasure, does it not?\"\nAbout Darkness.\n Selene : \n\"So many mortals fear the onset of the dark, but we? The dark is merely where we ply our trade. Come forth, then, little star, and let us shine together in the darkness now.\"\nAbout Her Steeds (Horses).\nDialogue 01.\n Selene : \n\"Whenever you invoke me thus, I urge my steeds toward the earth, as far as they dare tread. They are becoming braver, I should think. Now please use well the power I reveal in you.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Selene : \n\"My ride across the sky tends to be quite a solitary one. I have my steeds to speak to, yes. But it is not the same as when I have the opportunity to speak with you.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Selene : \n\"It has been too long since I saw you last. My steeds had grown rather exhausted from our rides. Where would I be if not for them? Closer to you, yes, but... this is where we belong.\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; Clearing a Run (Any).\nDialogue 01.\n Selene : \n\"You have gone far since last we met, especially for someone with no steeds. Thus I commend you, and may all of your future attempts in turn succeed.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Selene : \n\"You faced the Titan in the lowest depths... that much I knew before your Headmistress confirmed you vanquished him, as I had faith you would. If his life-force is like grains of sand, then you took one; eventually, \"all.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Selene : \n\"\"Death to Chronos. \"I sense that you are growing closer to manifesting the reality that we have long since sought. May you yet drain whatever light is left in him.\"\nPost-Gift Lines.\n Selene : \n\"If only you could see the world from where I ride. Some night perhaps? I know just how much ugliness there is. But it is rather hidden from afar.\"\nAbout The &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Trials\"&gt;Chaos Trials&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Selene : \n\"I felt a weight drawing me toward the Crossroads recently, and realized it was the Pitch-Black Stone. So then it has awakened; almost like an Eye itself, but far older than mine, and peering from the infinite abyss.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Selene : \n\"I sense that something is amiss tonight... as though I did not find you by my will. The Pitch-Black Stone... I see, of course. It is a weight on everything that we perceive.\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt; Penalty.\nDialogue 01.\n Selene : \n\"You are not meant to be here, little star. Your cursed blood shall fight your every step. Yet Nyx herself would understand the struggle that you face. She too once thwarted what the Fates foretold...\"\nDialogue 02.\n Selene : \n\"I feel you closer to my light. You suppressed that Fate-wrought curse that binds you to your realm. I was uncertain such a thing was possible... yet you surprise me fairly often, little star.\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt;'s Warded Gates.\n Selene : \n\"You dispelled the Crossroads surface gateway wards... traversed the veil between the world you know and this one that I look upon each night. Perhaps our plan required this new phase.\"\nAbout Magick.\nDialogue 01.\n Selene : \n\"Remember, little star: The magick that my light awakes in you requires active focus on your part; it has no power without your intent. In moments when you need it, do not hesitate.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Selene : \n\"This gift of magick does not come from me, but from within. Yet it is also true my luminance awakens innate possibility. An ill-kept secret even mortals of the surface know.\"\nAbout Hexes.\nDialogue 01.\n Selene : \n\"My innumerable journeys through the sky provided me with ample time to understand my light. By now, I have a Hex for each occasion, every phase. And you shall have them, too.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Selene : \n\"You have grown quite familiar with my Hexes, little star. By now you must have a particular favorite or two. Perhaps you shall continue to discover new dimensions in them all.\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt; War.\n Selene : \n\"We need you where you are. Your battles through the Underworld are consequential to the war that rages here, but leave the surface to the gods and me; do not become distracted by the sealed Crossroads gateway leading up.\"\nAbout The Silver Sisters.\n Selene : \n\"At last, we Silver Sisters four unite. I, in the heavens; the goddess of the hunt, on the surface; your great Headmistress, between realms; and you, within the Underworld. All that transpires, we observe.\"\nAbout Obscurity.\n Selene : \n\"Now that Artemis has revealed to Olympus what they need to know of you, she had pretext to return to your woods. But your reunion needed to be brief. Once our troubles have subsided, may we Silver Sisters meet together, and rejoice.\"\nAbout The &lt;a href=\"Selene/Gifts%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Path of Stars&lt;/a&gt;.\n Selene : \n\"You have seen the Path of Stars, and experienced its connection to my strength and yours. Though our Paths may diverge at times, they often lead us to a single point.\"\nAbout The &lt;a href=\"Oath%20of%20the%20Unseen\"&gt;Oath of the Unseen&lt;/a&gt;.\n Selene : \n\"At last you looked upon the Oath of the Unseen... for this night is beyond compare with any I experienced in an age. It is as though Darkness suffuses everything...\"\nAbout The New Moon.\n Selene : \n\"I am entirely enshrouded now; a new moon, for a new beginning. Use my cover of darkness to advance toward your goals.\"\nAbout Phases.\n Selene : \n\"The great night sky affords an advantageous vantage-point, and I see your struggles plain. Know that the hardship you endure is but a phase. Seek pleasure in the rhythm of it all.\"\nGifts.\n&lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Selene, I now send to you the Nectar of the gods, that it may warm your passage 'cross the sky!\"\n Selene : \n\"But, little star, you offer this to me? The connection that we share as Silver Sisters is already more than I can ask. Now be that as it may, \"I \"have something for \"you.\"\n\"Selene gives &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Beam\"&gt;Moon Beam&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You honor me, Sister.\"\n2nd Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"To you, Selene! I never feel lost knowing the Moon herself is there to help me find my path.\"\n Selene : \n\"You are most kind to honor me this way. It doubtless shall sustain my steeds and me on long nights such as these. You have our thanks.\"\n3rd Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"O Moon, my steady friend through all these nights, I have for you this humble offering!\"\n Selene : \n\"I am grateful for your generosity. Though the kinship that we share is more than sufficient, and makes the lonely nights seem to soar by.\"\n4th Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Great Eye of Night, who watches over me, may your brilliance always shine across the world.\"\n Selene : \n\"The customary gifting of the gods... I am becoming fond of this cycle. Some traditions of Olympus may be worth adopting after all.\""}

Its Special has you throw a light dagger forward. Its \u03a9 Attack has you quickly teleport behind an enemy and strike them once, while \u03a9 Special charges a set of up to 5 daggers to throw in a spreadfire pattern (switched to a straight line with one Hammer upgrade). Compared to other &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal%20Arms\"&gt;Nocturnal Arms&lt;/a&gt; this weapon is quite capable of being used in a \"low Magick\" build that relies more on uncharged attacks, and not needing a high &lt;a href=\"Magick\"&gt;Magick&lt;/a&gt; regeneration which can allow you to focus your runs more on attributes like Health.\nRelated to a low &lt;a href=\"Magick\"&gt;Magick&lt;/a&gt; build: Boons that Prime a quantity of your max Magick do not need you to actually have that much capacity of Magick to function.

{"id": "417", "revid": "47838920", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=417", "title": "Sisyphus", "text": "Sisyphus is a former king sentenced to an eternity of punishment within &lt;a href=\"Tartarus\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt; for attempting to cheat death. He succeeded twice, each time only temporarily before the consequences caught up with him. His punishment is to roll a boulder up a steep hill; the boulder, however, always rolls back down the hill before he reaches the top, despite his best efforts. The Furies - and &lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt; in particular - torment him as he attempts to push the boulder, though with &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus'&lt;/a&gt; recent escape attempts, they appear to be slacking on this particular duty.\nIn spite of his never-ending punishment, Sisyphus is generally good-humoured and polite, having had ample time to reflect on his deeds in life. He refers to his boulder as \"&lt;a href=\"Bouldy\"&gt;Bouldy&lt;/a&gt;,\" treating \"him\" as a friend and confidante, and speaks quite casually with Zagreus, whom he typically calls \"Prince Z. (Zed)\"\nZagreus can sometimes encounter Sisyphus taking a break from boulder-pushing while making his way through Tartarus. During these meetings, Sisyphus will offer Zagreus a choice between , 50-55 or 100 . He can only appear once during each escape attempt. Sisyphus is immune to damage, though he will respond if Zagreus takes a swing at him or Bouldy regardless.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nThe former king of Corinth, despite his eternal punishment of pushing a rock up a hill only to watch it roll back down every day, Sisyphus remains positive, kind, helpful, cheerful, and friendly. Sisyphus seems to fully understand a rock named \"&lt;a href=\"Bouldy\"&gt;Bouldy&lt;/a&gt;\" and considers it a good friend and confidant.\nHe is quite observant and often gossips about various underworld subjects, although he is often forced into routine by the lashes of the &lt;a href=\"Furies\"&gt;Furies&lt;/a&gt;, he still remains friendly, including with them, and lives a life of ostracism and solitude. Despite this, he has embraced his useless work with enthusiasm and even invaluable befriended the rock he pushes, which he nicknamed \"Bouldy,\" indicating that Sisyphus may have gone mad over time, because he is talking to a stone.\nThe former king is very persistent, even more than &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;, and his insights and advice are often helpful and greatly aid Zagreus in his escape attempts. Sisyphus provides tips whenever he can, considering Zagreus to be \"more or less\" similar to himself. He has memorized the entire map of Hades due to his constant attempts to escape, making him an invaluable resource for Zagreus.\nMisery builds character, implying that before his punishment, Sisyphus used to be a tyrant king, manipulative, and selfish, an intolerable individual, a poor king who had no fear of his own arrogance and considered himself smarter than the gods themselves. Sisyphus had nothing left to lose, so he reflected so much that he became a decent person, despite still trying to escape routinely.\nPhysical description.\nSisyphus is a robust man chained to a rock (&lt;a href=\"Bouldy\"&gt;Bouldy&lt;/a&gt;), dressed in tattered green clothes. His olive-brown hair is adorned on his head by a golden tiara resting on his forehead. Despite his lifeless state, the arduous effort and relentless whipping have left visible scars on his body, witnessing the enduring torment he endures.\nHistory.\nBefore Hades.\nSisyphus is the former king of Corinth who cheated &lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; twice before his crimes caught up with him, and he was sent to &lt;a href=\"Tartarus\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt;. His eternal punishment is to push a &lt;a href=\"Bouldy\"&gt;boulder&lt;/a&gt; up a hill, only for it to roll back down, and he must repeat this task endlessly.\nHades.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; comes across a prisoner chained to a large &lt;a href=\"Bouldy\"&gt;rock&lt;/a&gt; in the Underworld, who is also attempting to escape his imprisonment.\nEpilogue.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; grants Sisyphus his freedom from the terms of his contract, Sisyphus consciously elects to remain in his current position. His decision predominantly stems from his unwavering attachment to &lt;a href=\"Bouldy\"&gt;Bouldy&lt;/a&gt;, as he refuses to venture anywhere without the company of his trusted stone companion. The fortuitous alteration of his sentence permits him to dedicate his days to ceaselessly pushing Bouldy, shielded from the &lt;a href=\"Furies\"&gt;Furies&lt;/a&gt;' merciless lashes. Furthermore, Sisyphus derives great satisfaction from the opportunity to lend his assistance to Zagreus whenever feasible.\nBefore Hades II.\nHades was sent to Sisyphus' chamber after &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt; took control of the Underworld. Sisyphus talked with Hades and forgave him for his punishment and told Bouldy to keep Hades company until more arrived and left.\nHis current whereabouts are unknown.\nAffinity.\nIf given &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;, Sisyphus will give you the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Shackle\"&gt;Shattered Shackle&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter 6 bottles of Nectar in total, further gifts will be locked until you complete his favor.\nAfter completing his favor, giving Sisyphus &lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt; will give you &lt;a href=\"Companion%20Shady\"&gt;Companion Shady&lt;/a&gt; in exchange.\nSisyphus' affinity gauge is maxed out at 9 hearts, requiring the gifting of 6 Nectar and 3 Ambrosia.\nFavor.\nSisyphus' favor is earned by voiding his sentence.\nAs you get to know Sisyphus, he will introduce you to &lt;a href=\"Bouldy\"&gt;Bouldy&lt;/a&gt;. In order to start Sisyphus' quest, you will need to be at 6 hearts with him, learned about his backstory, and to have spoken to Bouldy at least once previously (giving nectar to Bouldy is not required).\nSisyphus' liberation quest begins with this piece of dialogue from Zagreus:\nAfter this you will need to have:\nAfter finding the document in the Admin Chamber, speak to the House Contractor to purchase the Knave-King's Sentence for 4 .\nThe next conversation you have with Sisyphus will earn his favor and complete the End to Torment prophecy in the &lt;a href=\"Fated%20List%20of%20Minor%20Prophecies\"&gt;Fated List of Minor Prophecies&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter this is done, Sisyphus may be given &lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt; right away.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

They are not gods or anyone special, but the time spent with each other has made them very strong.

{"id": "435", "revid": "48934972", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=435", "title": "Skelly", "text": "Skelly is a &lt;a href=\"Bloodless\"&gt;Bloodless&lt;/a&gt; \"employed\" by the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt; as a training dummy. While Skelly claims to be on the House's payroll, he refuses to reveal who hired him and is similarly unwilling to discuss his past, instead preferring to play various pranks on Zagreus. Oddly, no one in the House seems to be aware of his existence besides Zagreus and &lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt;, unless the former asks them about him.\nSkelly has 900 HP. As he's already dead, he will simply reform after being \"killed\" in training. He seems suspiciously enthusiastic about getting beaten up.\nSkelly returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;\" as Commander Schelemeus, who aids &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; in her fight against &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;. His role is similar to the previous game, where he can be used as a training dummy and in addition he'll comment on the various game mechanics.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nSkelly, the excessively animated skeleton, remains a mysterious figure. Despite lacking flesh and blood, he eagerly assists &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; in mastering the use of weapons, serving as a willing punching bag for the prince's practice sessions. Surprisingly, Skelly finds joy in this role, deriving satisfaction from the experience.\nAlthough he is a skeleton, Skelly possesses a vibrant spirit. He is fiercely loyal and courageous, aiding Zagreus in his escapades behind &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;' back. Skelly tends to exhibit extreme behavior, being highly enthusiastic, talkative, and condescending towards those within earshot. He often engages in playful banter, even going as far as pretending to be capable of experiencing death to play pranks on Zagreus, much to the prince's amusement.\nSkelly is friendly and helpful by nature, but he has a tendency to quickly develop a sense of familiarity with others, as if he were an expert in the ways of war. &lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt; disapproves of Skelly's imprudent advice and questions who Skelly might have been in life to possess such unwavering confidence in death. Additionally, Skelly exhibits a peculiar masochistic inclination, deriving pleasure from enduring blows.\nAs \"Schelemeus\", Skelly takes on an almost over-the-top parody of a Drill Instructor training Melino\u00eb and various other Shades on how to defend themselves against Chronos' forces. Though he acts more serious than in Hades, he nonetheless retains his old joking manner and will occasionally lose his stiff demeanor and respond to Melino\u00eb casually. \nPhysical description.\nSkelly is depicted as a blue-white skeleton with vibrant red eyes, an anatomically upside down nose in the shape of a heart and an expression of excitement. In an interesting departure from typical skeletal appearances, he possesses a few strands of black hair on the top of his head, accompanied by shaggy sideburns and an irregular ridge along his back. Notably, Skelly places a coin with the symbol of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt; in his mouth. This unique combination of features further enhances Skelly's distinct appearance in the game.\nAs Schelemeus he looks vastly different from his previous appearance. He now sports a white beard, a headband and his chest is adorned with three medals (gold, silver and bronze). Also, he now wears a long red cape that covers a small part of his right arm, a brown skirt held in place by a silver belt with a crescent moon on it and uses a walking stick. He's no longer hunched back, either, instead standing perfectly straight.\nHistory.\nBefore Hades.\nSkelly's past is shrouded in mystery. It's implied that he was once a formidable warrior who finally died after surviving numerous legendary battles. \nHades.\nSkelly first appears right after you purchase your first &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Arms\"&gt;weapon.&lt;/a&gt;\nSkelly is shrouded in secrecy, claiming to have been hired by someone who seeks to aid the prince's escape, yet he refuses to disclose the identity of his employer. His actions are driven by a greater purpose, as he plays a part in helping Zagreus reunite with his &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt;.\nEpilogue.\nWhen he discovers Zagreus has finally reunited and brought back his mother, Skelly first assumes his job is done and he must find something else to do. However, after Zagreus explains his escape attempts are now official security checks and he could use some help, Skelly stays to help the Prince get even better at fighting.\nZagreus will repeatedly try to convince Skelly to spill out who he is working for, having discovered it's not anyone from the House, but Skelly will always evade the question, even playing a little prank on the prince by providing a fake backstory. Only when Zagreus threatens to stop beating him does Skelly reveals he is working for Charon. Although shocked by the revelation, Zagreus figures the boatman has his own motives, and Skelly agrees.\nBefore Hades II.\nSkelly was able to escape Chronos' hostile takeover of the &lt;a href=\"Underworld\"&gt;Underworld&lt;/a&gt;.\nHades II.\nNow styling himself as 'Commander Schelemeus', he now resides in &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;, helping &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; with her training. In contrast to his appearance in the first game, he seems particularly cagey about the possibility of Charon being aware of his location and activities.\nAffinity.\nIf gifted &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;, Skelly will give you the &lt;a href=\"Lucky%20Tooth\"&gt;Lucky Tooth&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter giving Skelly 6 Nectar in total, you will be unable to give him any other gift until you complete a favor for him.\nOnce completing his favor, giving him &lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt; will earn you the &lt;a href=\"Companion%20Rib\"&gt;Companion Rib&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkelly's affinity gauge is maxed out at 9 hearts, requiring the gifting of 6 Nectar and 3 Ambrosia.\nFavor.\nSkelly's favor is directly requested by him the next time he is encountered and his affinity gauge is as complete as it can be. He won't give you the quest until you've unlocked 4 non-Zagreus aspects of weapons. After you've done that, on your next run he should offer the new quest.\nHe will request that &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; kill him with the &lt;a href=\"Stygian%20Blade\"&gt;Stygian Blade&lt;/a&gt;, but using its Level 5 Zagreus Aspect (which costs a total of 5 &lt;a href=\"Titan%20Blood\"&gt;Titan Blood&lt;/a&gt;), claiming it will set him free of his \u201ccontract.\u201d\nOnce this has been done, Zagreus will be able to gift him Ambrosia the next time he encounters Skelly in the courtyard.\nCompleting Skelly's favor also completes the Eternal Rest prophecy. \nChallenge Statues.\nSkelly will add 3 covered statues to the southwest of the courtyard which require you to complete runs at certain &lt;a href=\"Pact%20of%20Punishment\"&gt;heat levels&lt;/a&gt;: 8, 16, and 32.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\nMerchandise=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

But only for a moment, and even then... I can't prevail by dodging all night long.\"\n Schelemeus : \n\"\"Eh\", I'd do it all the time if I was you! See the little trail when you Dash?

I was just thinking about all the reagents I still need. Some grow in different regions, or require different tools... it's a lot to keep in mind.\"\n Schelemeus : \n\"But you don't gotta keep it all in mind!

I can see you're at a loss for words, such is the splendor of her likeness! And this is just the first of 'em!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Indeed. And are the other Gifts just as, \"erm... \"detailed? Either way, I'm not so certain I can handle twice let alone three times the glory, when my task is difficult enough as it is...\"\n Schelemeus : \n\"\"Ahh\", so then the Fear is getting to you. Do not give in to it, young one! Instead, give in to Curiosity about those other glorious Gifts! Think of the \"prestige! \"Now you can be a little scaredy quitter, or &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Night's Champion&lt;/a&gt;, which is it gonna be?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"...Do I have to decide this instant?\"\n Schelemeus : \n\"\"Nah \"you take however long you need.\"\nDialogue 09.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"...Commander, I... I'm rather at a loss for words, I think! Though I am honored, truly.\"\n Schelemeus : \n\"Oh you \"better \"be!

It's covered in Night's drapery... what's to stop me from merely taking a look? Apparently \"you've \"already seen it.\"\n Schelemeus : \n\"Sounds like \"you \"might not be &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Night's Champion&lt;/a&gt; \"after all, suggesting underhanded tactics such as that!

While I value your encouragement and am inspired by your words of validation, perhaps I shouldn't be so quick to pin my sense of self-worth on accumulating material possessions.\"\n Schelemeus : \n\"Come \"on\", young one, you mustn't \"speak \"that way!\"\nDialogue 10.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I... I'm deeply honored, Commander. To be in service to the realm, and to have earned such... provocative sculptures. I thought art was about the expression of beauty; I never realized that it could inspire so many... complicated emotions.\"\n Schelemeus : \n\"I got a lot of complicated emotions just thinking about what it took to get those things in here without you noticing! But anyway, congrats. We'd have a feast in your honor or something, but... \"eh\", nobody's supposed to know about this stuff. So it's gonna have to be our secret and all that.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"So, does this mean I truly am Night's Champion?

Your disciples and I are fortunate to study under you.\"\n4th Time.\n Schelemeus : \n\"I must not partake in such extravagances! For my disciples are counting on my clear-eyed counsel and undivided attention. But tell you what I'm gonna save this one for later when I'm off, OK?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"What you call an extravagance... it must be nothing compared to the luxuries of my father's House.

These often debilitate enemies in some various way (debuffs), but can also provide positive benefits (buffs), in particular to Zagreus.\nBuffs.\nIncreased Damage.\nIncreased Damage is gained with &lt;a href=\"Boons\"&gt;Boons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daedalus%20Hammer\"&gt;Daedalus Hammer&lt;/a&gt; upgrades, aspects of &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Arms\"&gt;Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, or abilities from the &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20of%20Night\"&gt;Mirror of Night&lt;/a&gt;. Temporary buffs are generally expressed with an effect visible on Zagreus. \nEach buff can affect different types of damage sources which each have different base damages (Attack, Dash-Strike, Special, Dash-Upper, Cast, Status Curses, Revenge Damage, and other boons). &lt;a href=\"Daedalus%20Hammer\"&gt;Daedalus Hammer&lt;/a&gt; upgrades and &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt;'s Boons affect Attack and Dash-Strike independently of each other, but for other gods' &lt;a href=\"Boons\"&gt;Boons&lt;/a&gt;, buffs that increase Attack affect both basic Attack and Dash-Strike. The same is true for Special and Dash-Upper.\nSeveral buffs apply to all types of damage, such the Eris Aspect and the Targeting System Daedalus Hammer upgrade for the &lt;a href=\"Adamant%20Rail\"&gt;Adamant Rail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;'s Bad Influence, &lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;'s Sweet Surrender, and &lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;'s Blood Frenzy. \nMore detail about calculation can be found here: &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Calculation\"&gt;Damage Calculation&lt;/a&gt;.\nReduced Damage.\nReduced Damage affects the damage dealt by enemies. It can be gained from &lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;'s Weak effects and Different League, &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;'s Bronze Skin, and &lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;'s High Tolerance. It can also be gained from &lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Myrmidon%20Bracer\"&gt;Myrmidon Bracer&lt;/a&gt; Keepsake, the &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20of%20Night\"&gt;Mirror of Night&lt;/a&gt; upgrade Abyssal Blood, and the &lt;a href=\"Stygian%20Blade\"&gt;Stygian Blade&lt;/a&gt;'s Aspect of Arthur. These sources of Reduced Damage do not affect Traps or the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Styx\"&gt;Temple of Styx&lt;/a&gt;'s Poison, which can only be reduced with &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;'s Sure Footing.\nReduced damage is multiplicative; therefore, it's impossible to have 100% damage reduction. Details about about calculation can be found here: &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Calculation%23Damage%20Reduction\"&gt;Damage Calculation&lt;/a&gt;.\nSturdy.\nSturdy is gained from some &lt;a href=\"Daedalus%20Hammer\"&gt;Daedalus Hammer&lt;/a&gt; upgrades or &lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;' Hyper Sprint.\nWhen Sturdy, you take 30% less damage and your actions aren\u2019t interrupted by taking damage. A light shield is visible on Zagreus when Sturdy is active.\nDodge.\nDodge Chance is gained from &lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;' Greater Evasion, Second Wind, &lt;a href=\"Lambent%20Plume\"&gt;Lambent Plume&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Fists\"&gt;Zagreus's Twin Fists aspect&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20of%20Night\"&gt;Ruthless Reflex&lt;/a&gt;. Dodging an attack completely negates all damage and effects that would be caused by an attack. Dodge chance is additive and it's possible to reach 100% dodge and be nigh invincible.\nIncreased Move Speed.\nIncreased Movement Speed is granted by &lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt; boons, such as Greater Haste, Hyper Sprint, or Second Wind, &lt;a href=\"Stygian%20Blade\"&gt;Zagreus's Stygian Blade aspect&lt;/a&gt;, and with &lt;a href=\"Lambent%20Plume\"&gt;Lambent Plume&lt;/a&gt;, and is signified by a movement trailing effect coming from Zagreus. Movement Speed bonus is multiplicative.\nShielded.\nSome boons, like some Aids, &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;'s Divine Protection, Dash, or Holy Shield, offer shields which protect Zagreus from incoming damage, making him invulnerable while shielded.\n&lt;a href=\"Voidstone\"&gt;Voidstones&lt;/a&gt; can provide shields to enemies near them, and bosses gain shields while they are between phases, such as when the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Hydra\"&gt;Bone Hydra&lt;/a&gt; summons additional heads to fight for it. Charmed Voidstones can provide shields to Zagreus.\nWhen taking a large amount of damage in a short time, a short shield is provided to Zagreus. Hell Mode removes this shield with its exclusive pact option, Personal Liability.\nDebuffs.\nStatus Curses.\nStatus Curses are a variety of temporary effects inflicted under certain circumstances. Each Olympian god (with the exception of Hermes) has at least one boon capable of inflicting a Status Curse. Zagreus cannot be inflicted with Status Curses himself, except in &lt;a href=\"Trial_of_the_Gods\"&gt;Trials of the Gods&lt;/a&gt; or when fighting &lt;a href=\"Theseus\"&gt;Theseus&lt;/a&gt; after he calls for Olympian Aid.\nPunished.\nWith the Privileged Status ability active in the &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20of%20Night\"&gt;Mirror of Night&lt;/a&gt;, an enemy is Punished and takes additional damage while inflicted with 2 or more different Status Curses. Enemies that are Punished have the icon () next to their health bar.\nIf Doom is one of the 2 Status Curses counting towards Punished, the burst of damage \"will\" be increased by the Punished status, since Doom inflicts damage immediately before it expires.\nCharmed.\nSome Aphrodite boons inflict Charmed on enemies. Charmed causes those enemies to attack other enemies, and deal no damage to Zagreus while charmed. While Bosses can be charmed, the charm lasts for a significantly shorter duration than on a normal enemy, though this will still disrupt a boss\u2019s attack like a stun. Charmed does not count as a Status Curse, despite the fact that it comes from an Olympian god. Theseus and Asterius will occasionally comment when Charmed.\nStun.\nStuns prevent an enemy inflicted with them from moving or attacking, interrupting their previous action. Some boons, such as Trippy Shot, can inflict brief stuns. Most weapon attacks and some specials inflict small duration stuns (more commonly referred to as \"staggers\") which interrupt enemy attacks and movements. Wall Slams and Traps also inflict stuns on enemies. Some attacks in the game can also stun Zagreus, such as &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Lord Hades&lt;/a&gt;' Vase Summon. The &lt;a href=\"Duo%20Boons\"&gt;Duo Boon&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt; gives Zagreus immunity to being stunned. Bosses cannot be stunned.\nPetrified.\nPetrified is a debuff inflicted by &lt;a href=\"Gorgon\"&gt;Gorgon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Megagorgon\"&gt;Megagorgon&lt;/a&gt; projectiles. It prevents Zagreus from moving or attacking until he breaks free by rapidly dashing or attacking. The projectiles can also be deflected (with Athena's boons) at enemies to petrify them, except for armoured mini-bosses. Using &lt;a href=\"Companion%20Fidi\"&gt;Companion Fidi&lt;/a&gt; also lets Zagreus petrify enemies (except for mini-bosses with armour and bosses).\nStyx Poison.\nStyx Poison is a debuff which deals damage over time to Zagreus or enemies it is inflicted on, as well as inflicting a green tint around the edges of the screen. Poison is inflicted by traps in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Styx\"&gt;Temple of Styx&lt;/a&gt;, pools created by &lt;a href=\"Gigantic%20Vermin\"&gt;Gigantic Vermin&lt;/a&gt;, and darts thrown by &lt;a href=\"Satyr%20Cultist\"&gt;Satyr Cultists&lt;/a&gt;. Poison stacks, allowing it to deal increased damage over time, but stacks eventually wear off. Stacks can be immediately cleansed by using a Curing Pool in a Styx chamber, which grants brief immunity to the effect. Poison can be applied to enemies by deflecting Satyr Cultist darts at them, and will deal 5 times the damage it deals Zagreus. It can also be applied to enemies via the pools created by Gigantic Vermin."}

It is also available to Melino\u00eb through certain boons, keepsakes, and Path of Stars upgrades.\nUsing a Death Defiance also briefly grants Impervious.\nDodge.\nDodge is the ability to ignore an attack made by an enemy. Dodging an attack completely negates all damage and effects that would be caused by an attack. Dodge chance is additive (stacking), meaning it's possible to reach 100% dodge and be nigh invincible.

Sources of Shielded include:\nBlock.\nBlock prevents incoming damage from one or multiple sides for a certain duration. \nUnlike Shielded, Block has no limit to the number of attacks nullified and will expire whether or not its user is struck; and unlike Impervious, Block leaves its user vulnerable on at least one side.\nA type of Block is available to Melino\u00eb via the Aspect of Artemis on the &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Blades\"&gt;Sister Blades&lt;/a&gt;, and the Special on the &lt;a href=\"Moonstone%20Axe\"&gt;Moonstone Axe&lt;/a&gt;. \nCertain enemies, such as Satyr Hoplites and Shellbacks, use Block.\nDebuffs.\nStatus Curses.\nStatus Curses are a variety of temporary effects inflicted under certain circumstances. Each God (with the exception of Chaos, Hades and Hermes) has at least one boon capable of inflicting a Status Curse. Melino\u00eb cannot be inflicted with Status Curses herself.\nPunished.\nWith the Origination &lt;a href=\"Arcana%20Cards\"&gt;Arcana Card&lt;/a&gt; active, an enemy is Punished and takes additional damage while inflicted with 2 or more different Status Curses. Enemies that are Punished have the icon () next to their health bar.\nBlessing of Strife.\nThe Blessing of Strife is a debuff given by &lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt; on certain encounters (except her boss fight), that increases damage taken by +20% and gains more damage taken by an additional +5% whenever you clear Encounters. The only way to remove this debuff is by failing a night.\nCharmed.\nAphrodite's &lt;a href=\"Duo%20Boons/Hades%20II\"&gt;Duo Boon&lt;/a&gt; Ecstatic Obsession inflicts Charmed on enemies. Charmed causes those enemies to attack other enemies, and deal no damage to Melino\u00eb while charmed. While Bosses can be charmed, the charm lasts for a significantly shorter duration than on a normal enemy, though this will still disrupt a boss\u2019s attack like a stun. Charmed does not count as a Status Curse, despite the fact that it comes from an Olympian god.\nCharmed lasts until the end of an Encounter.\nChthonic Fate.\nChthonic Fate is a unique debuff that appears once Melino\u00eb reaches &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Ephyra\"&gt;the surface&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. It deals self damage that increases per 5 seconds, making it impossible to do any surface runs. To permanently remove the Chthonic Fate, the Unraveling a Fateful Bond &lt;a href=\"Cauldron%23Incantations\"&gt;incantation&lt;/a&gt; must be performed.\nStun.\nStun interrupts Melino\u00eb's actions and prevents her from moving or attacking for a certain duration.

Supergiant Games was formed by Amir Rao and Gavin Simon in 2009. Both had been working at the Los Angeles studio of Electronic Arts, involved with the Command &amp; Conquer series. In 2009 they agreed to quit their job, move into the same house, and begin to work on a new game together. Artist Jen Zee became the studio's third member, and, later, its art director. Musician Darren Korb was hired for audio and music work. They employed a number of freelance programmers and developers at various times during the development of their first game.\nSupergiant Games is best known for the critically acclaimed games Bastion (2011), Transistor (2014), Pyre (2017), &lt;a href=\"Hades%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; (2020) and &lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "773", "revid": "54583845", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=773", "title": "Tartarus", "text": "Tartarus is an indoor biome just outside of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt;. It is a maze of dungeons and corridors which holds the souls of those who committed crimes and sins in their lives. The flows through and around Tartarus, emptying into a pool inside the House of Hades itself. Tartarus is the first biome &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; must fight through to escape the Underworld. It naturally consists of 15 chambers but can be extended by taking a &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Gate\"&gt;Chaos Gate&lt;/a&gt; in the 12th chamber.\nTraps.\nTartarus features three different kind of traps. The first are spike pits on the floor. If an enemy or Zagreus walks on them, after a very short delay, spikes will protrude from the plate, dealing low damage to Zagreus and high damage to enemies.\nAdditionally, Tartarus features Chimera traps, referred to by Zagreus as \"dart traps.\" These traps are small cannons linked to pressure plates in rooms. When an enemy or Zagreus walks onto the pressure plate, the cannon will fire a barrage of missiles in the direction of the pressure plate, dealing low to moderate damage to Zagreus, and high damage to enemies.\nTartarus also has barrels of explosives placed in some rooms. When hit with an attack, these barrels will ignite, and explode after a short delay. Any enemies or Zagreus caught in the blast will take high damage (though enemies will take considerably more damage than Zagreus will.) These barrels can only be set off by Zagreus' attacks and cannot be detonated in any other way.\nUnique Chambers.\nTartarus features a unique chamber with the shade &lt;a href=\"Sisyphus\"&gt;Sisyphus&lt;/a&gt;, who is tasked with pushing a boulder (affectionately named \"&lt;a href=\"Bouldy\"&gt;Bouldy&lt;/a&gt;\") up a hill in his chamber. When encountered, Sisyphus will offer Zagreus a brief conversation, and then grant him either &lt;a href=\"Charon%27s%20Obol\"&gt;Obols&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Darkness\"&gt;Darkness&lt;/a&gt;. After many encounters Zagreus will eventually be able to gift Bouldy with Nectar, giving Zagreus the Heart of Stone boon in exchange. Sisyphus can only be encountered one time per run and is not guaranteed to be encountered. Zagreus cannot use Fated Authority on his chamber to swap it to a different reward.\nSince Sisyphus's chamber features no combat, it will not count towards Encounters for &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt; boon debuffs, but it will count for Encounters for items from the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Charon\"&gt;Well of Charon&lt;/a&gt; (but only non-combat ones, like the HydraLite).\nMini-Boss Encounters.\nTartarus features three separate mini-boss encounters. Zagreus can encounter only one of them in a run. It is possible to encounter none of them, depending on the paths the player takes.\nThe rewards for each mini-boss encounter are a &lt;a href=\"Boons\"&gt;Boon&lt;/a&gt; of increased rarity. When Fated Authority is used on them, the god boon reward will change, but the room itself will not, and the mini boss will remain. Additionally, Fated Authority will not change which mini-boss room is encountered.\nEach room is marked with an elite skull beneath the offered god boon. There is no way to distinguish between the three encounters without entering one.\nThe first mini-boss encounter is the Bloodless chamber. In it, Zagreus must fight two Elite Inferno Bombers. This encounter takes place in two possible rooms. One room is a small room with four destructible pillars in it, allowing the player to drop rubble on the enemies to deal lots of damage. The other room is much larger, with an inner ring of platforms surrounded by an outer ring of playable area. This room features a variety of traps in it, with spike pits along the outer ring and four Chimera traps targeting each inner platform. This room will only appear with the Middle Management pact enabled.\nThe second mini-boss encounter is the Wretched Sneak chamber. In it, Zagreus must fight the Sneak, which teleports around the room after each attack, a melee jab or a fast-flying projectile, and summons Wringer reinforcements from the River Styx to the left and right sides of the room if not taken down quickly. The encounter takes place in a heart-shaped room with two gaps that can be cleared with dashes and a destructible pillar at its center. The room has two entryways and two exits.\nThe third mini-boss encounter is the Doomstone chamber. In it, Zagreus must fight a Doomstone which floats above its chamber, firing beams in a radial pattern around itself. The encounter takes place in a square chamber with deep chasms cutting into the chamber's center from the top-left, top-right, and bottom-right.\nBoss Encounters.\nTartarus features three different bosses, the Furies. When you reach chamber 14, one of these bosses will be randomly selected to fight. Each boss has their own unique chamber and attacks.\nInitially, &lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt; will be the only fight the player can experience at the end of Tartarus. After a few attempts, &lt;a href=\"Alecto\"&gt;Alecto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tisiphone\"&gt;Tisiphone&lt;/a&gt; will begin appearing.\nThe reward for this encounter is a &lt;a href=\"Titan%20Blood\"&gt;Titan Blood&lt;/a&gt; Bounty if it is the player's first victory against the Furies, or if they meet the Target Heat from the &lt;a href=\"Pact%20of%20Punishment\"&gt;Pact of Punishment&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, it is a &lt;a href=\"Darkness\"&gt;Darkness&lt;/a&gt; drop. By default, this drop is 50 , and is affected by boons and bonus effects.\nOnce the Fury is defeated and reward collected, the door at the opposite side of the chamber will open, allowing access to a Stairway encounter. This stairway will always lead to &lt;a href=\"Asphodel\"&gt;Asphodel&lt;/a&gt;, the second biome of the game.\nFor more information on the Furies as the boss of Tartarus, see &lt;a href=\"The%20Furies\"&gt;The Furies&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnemies.\nThese are all the enemies that can be encountered in any other Tartarus chamber. These enemies can also appear as Elites, giving them armor and upgraded attacks."}

At the back of the temple, the watchful hellhound &lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt; assumes his post, devouring any soul attempting to leave. The Temple is the 4th and final biome &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; must fight through in order to escape the Underworld, after surviving the perils of &lt;a href=\"Elysium\"&gt;Elysium&lt;/a&gt;. This biome is structured differently than the previous three biomes of the game, featuring five wings of small chambers with rewards only offered in the final room of a wing. A full clear of the Temple of Styx will be 33 chambers.\nLayout.\nThe Temple features a different layout than previous biomes. The first room of the biome is a hub room, which Zagreus will be returning to often as he travels here. &lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;'s final shop (aka the \"Mega Shop\") will always be found in the hub, as well as a side passage which leads to the five encounter wings.\nCharon's shop will always offer a Hermes Boon of boosted rarity for 500 or an &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20of%20Fates\"&gt;Anvil of Fates&lt;/a&gt; for 275 , one of two bounty resources: a &lt;a href=\"Diamond\"&gt;Diamond&lt;/a&gt; (1000 ) or &lt;a href=\"Titan%20Blood\"&gt;Titan Blood&lt;/a&gt; (1200 ), and four other upgrades (God Boons, &lt;a href=\"Centaur%20Heart\"&gt;Centaur Hearts&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Pom%20of%20Power\"&gt;Poms of Power&lt;/a&gt;). Two of his offerings will be upgraded versions of Boons or Poms with increased prices: Boons will cost 450 rather than 150 but have boosted rarity, whereas Poms cost 300 rather than 100 but increase a boon's level by 2 instead.In order to escape Styx, Zagreus must find a Fetid Sack within the Satyr Tunnels of the temple, in order to persuade Cerberus to abandon his post and allow Zagreus past. Five wings of Satyr Tunnels open in the western part of the hub room. Each wing consists of compact and small chambers with no reward, concluding in one final larger chamber where the reward is offered. Two of the wings will always be Elite wings, offering more dangerous encounters which end with a mini-boss, and have increased rewards.\nThe Styx wings, with no Fated Authority used, will always offer two or three Boons, a Daedalus Hammer (if only one Hammer had been offered prior to the Temple) and a combination of Obol, Pom of Power, and Centaur Heart rewards for the remaining wings. If Fated Authority is used on a chamber, it will not revert back to its original version if Zagreus travels down a different path instead, and returns to the hub later.\nAfter finding the Fetid Sack, Zagreus can talk to Cerberus, who will accept it and leave the room, allowing access to the Exit Door of the Underworld. When Cerberus moves, all remaining wings of Styx will be closed, and Zagreus will no longer be able to enter them. Charon's shop will remain open, allowing for potential last minute upgrades.\nTraps and Features.\nTraps.\nStyx features the most deadly traps in \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;\". All of its traps deal very high damage and activate very quickly.\nGuillotine traps are the most common trap in Styx. These traps drop large axes from the ceiling, which do very high damage should Zagreus or an enemy be beneath them. Networks of these axes can be linked to pressure plates in rooms, or they can automatically trigger on a loop.\nAnother dangerous trap in Styx is the Snake Saw launcher. These traps continuously shoot large buzz-saws across the room, in a straight line. These saws can be deflected, but cannot be destroyed, and do very high damage to anything in their path.\nStyx also features poison vents on the floor, which randomly release poison clouds. These clouds can only harm Zagreus, and inflict him with a stack of Styx Poison if he lingers for too long within a cloud.\nFeatures.\nEvery Styx chamber contains at least one Mandragora Curing Pool, with larger rooms containing 2 or 3 of them. Mandragora Curing Pools can be used to cleanse the &lt;a href=\"Status%20effects\"&gt;Styx Poison&lt;/a&gt; debuff from Zagreus. Curing Pools are often placed in precarious positions, usually around traps. Using a Curing Pool puts it on a very short cooldown (about 3 seconds) before it can be used again.\nAdditionally, Chaos Gates, Treasure Troves and Infernal Gates cannot spawn in any Styx chamber. Wells of Charon and Pools of Purging can however, albeit at a reduced rate compared to other biomes.\nIf unlocked, Valuable Urns (Urns which contain gold) are more frequent in Styx than in every other biome.\nUnique Chambers.\nStyx features one unique chamber which is the \"Storage Room\". The Storage Room is guaranteed to spawn in one of the five wings of Styx, as a replacement for a larger final room in a wing. The Storage Room will contain that wing's room reward, as well as the Satyr Sack and a Fountain. The fountain will heal for more health than any other fountain in a run but is the only fountain in Styx. The Storage Room will not be the first wing you choose to enter.\nStyx currently features no NPC room encounters, unlike every other biome in the game (not counting the hub room with Cerberus and Charon in it).\nMini-Boss Encounters.\nStyx features four potential mini-boss encounters, which only spawn as the final room of an elite wing. Up to two of these can be encountered in a run. The mini-boss encounters of Styx are an upgraded Dire &lt;a href=\"Bother\"&gt;Bother&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Snakestone\"&gt;Snakestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gigantic%20Vermin\"&gt;Gigantic Vermin&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Satyr%20Cultist\"&gt;Satyr Cultist&lt;/a&gt;, with various Styx enemy reinforcements. These variants will have a different appearance, increased armor and health (more than a typical Elite of the same type) and improved attacks. While alive, these Dire enemies will continue to spawn enemy reinforcements up to a cap. These encounters end when all enemies in the room have been defeated, including all remaining enemy reinforcements. Their reward is always the reward of the wing they were found in (which will be of increased quality).\nIf the pact Middle Management is active, two different mini-bosses will appear in each encounter instead of one.\nBoss Encounters.\nThere are only two bosses to be found once the player reaches the temple, one inside the temple itself, and another one, after Zagreus leaves for the Surface. One of them, which can be found inside the chambers, is the &lt;a href=\"King%20Vermin\"&gt;Tiny Vermin&lt;/a&gt;, a much stronger version of the regular &lt;a href=\"Crawler\"&gt;Crawler&lt;/a&gt;. The Tiny Vermin attacks much faster than its regular counterpart, deals a lot more damage, and has 12,000 health. \nThe second boss of the area and final boss of the game is &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Lord Hades&lt;/a&gt; himself. He can be found in the Surface, once the player gives Cerberus the &lt;a href=\"Satyr%20Sack\"&gt;Satyr Sack&lt;/a&gt; and goes through the final door. He will talk briefly to Zagreus before initiating combat. His boss fight consists of two phases.\nThe reward for this encounter is a Titan Blood bounty if the player meets bounty conditions, either through first victory against the boss or Heat Levels through the &lt;a href=\"Pact%20of%20Punishment\"&gt;Pact of Punishment&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, it is a Darkness drop. By default, this drop is 250 , which can be affected by boons and bonus effects.\nOnce the Final Boss is defeated and the reward accepted, a path will be revealed to escape the entrance of the Underworld and Zagreus can finally travel to the surface world. However, prior to release 1.0 of the game, this led to an end game cutscene which narrated a potential way for Zagreus to die on the surface world, and returned him to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt; with a congratulating message from the development team.\nEnemies.\nThese are all the enemies that can be encountered in any Temple of Styx chamber. All of these enemies can also appear as Elites, giving them armor and occasionally upgraded attacks."}

{"id": "833", "revid": "48934972", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=833", "title": "Thanatos", "text": "Thanatos is the personification of Death, son of &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt; and the older twin brother of &lt;a href=\"Hypnos\"&gt;Hypnos&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the embodiment of death, Thanatos has many duties requiring him to venture up into the mortal realm. His most recent such venture took longer than usual - speculated by Hypnos and &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; to be related to the ongoing war - but returns some time after the game's opening. He apparently dislikes the mortal realm, in particular how bright it can get.\nThanatos occasionally appears at the beginning of regular encounters and challenges Zagreus to see which of them can slay more shades. He is immune to damage during the contest, and will not retaliate if struck (he'll just complain). If Zagreus either kills more enemies than Thanatos does or ties his total, he will award Zagreus a &lt;a href=\"Centaur%20Heart\"&gt;Centaur Heart&lt;/a&gt; in addition to the regular room-clear reward.\nWithin the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt;, Thanatos can be found in the same hallway where &lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt; keeps guard. After a run in which he was encountered, he has a high (but not 100%) chance of appearing in the House. If he is given &lt;a href=\"nectar\"&gt;nectar&lt;/a&gt; during the run right before appearing in the House, he won't be able to be gifted.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nThanatos prioritizes a job well done and likes to keep a perfect record but despite his strong work ethic, this does not stop him from moving in the shadows, as Thanatos breaks his loyalty vow to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt; by offering his support to &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; to help him escape. As the embodiment of Death itself, Thanatos represents the natural and non-violent end to mortal existence, removing life in a painless and expected way. He sees death as a compassionate friend responsible for taking souls to the end of their journey and treats it only as an aspect of his work.\nTo most in the Underworld, Thanatos is known as a chronic workaholic and a ruthless perfectionist: aloof, insensitive, and almost always in a bad mood. Even when he apologizes, his words can be harsh. However, Zagreus claims that beneath his prickly exterior, Thanatos can in truth be responsive, respectful, and even friendly when he so desires, deconstructing the icy persona his years of duty have cultivated. Thanatos is also reserved, does not open up easily, and does not share details about his private life unless they are related to his work. However, he is surprisingly talkative in combat, sometimes even announcing his next move. Zagreus considers listening to this to be a \"death sentence\" in its own way.\nThanatos has a strict code of conduct at work, especially when it comes to his twin brother Hypnos. Hypnos tends to be sloppy in his work, while Thanatos is methodical, solemn, and completes his tasks in an orderly manner. Thanatos tends to ignore or reprimand Hypnos, but he sees it as an incentive for his twin to improve. When Hypnos is at risk of losing his job, Thanatos intervenes. As Hypnos becomes more active in his tasks in the House, Thanatos secretly praises him, and even apologizes for how he previously treated him.\nProud and hesitant, Thanatos is not honest about his feelings, but is also not good at hiding them, irrespective of his cool exterior. Everyone in the Underworld seems to already know how he feels about Zagreus, whom he is said to adore. He takes things extremely seriously, so when Zagreus says he wants to go further with their relationship, Thanatos asks him to clarify and hopes that Zagreus doesn't think he's joking. If Zagreus accepts Thanatos' offer, he needs to understand that Thanatos' distant and unsettling silence does not indicate indifference and Zagreus will have to deal with it as it is simply a part of his personality. Also, Thanatos has no problem with Zagreus pursuing other romantic partners such as &lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt; and will engage in a polyamorous relationship with both of them should Zagreus wishes to engage in such a relationship.\nPhysical description.\nThanatos is a figure with a greyish-brown skin tone, though pale, slim, and slender, but sculpted with striking features and short silver hair that used to be long, now falling in strands around his face. He has dark circles around his eyes, with remarkable golden eyes that gleam with a supernatural light. He is generally seen with an apathetic expression. \nHis dark leather armor is adorned with golden wings, similar to his twin brother's, but with three ornaments instead of four, placed on just one shoulder. He wears a hood that covers the top of his head and frames his face, and his black cloak flows behind him as he moves gracefully and agilely. In his hand, he wields a black scythe with a sharp, curved blade that emits a purple light resembling an eye.\nHades.\nThanatos and his twin Hypnos were one of many children born to Nyx, and was designated as Death incarnate. He gained the ability to shift around; however, he couldn't control his teleportation powers very well and was constantly warping around, being a real handful to Nyx.\nHe came to know of &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt; and like many others appreciated her and her rule. Persephone herself liked Thanatos due to his composed and hard-working style.\nOne day, he was tasked with bringing the the King of &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Ephyra\"&gt;Ephyra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sisyphus\"&gt;Sisyphus&lt;/a&gt;, whom the gods had grown tired of his poor treatment of guests and other misdeeds. He departed with special chains made to bind the king, but Thanatos was tricked by Sisyphus and captured Death itself. Without Thanatos there were no more deaths which greatly upset the God of War &lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;, since no one would die in his wars. Ares tracked Thanatos and freed him from his prison. Thanatos then took Sisyphus to the Underworld to receive his punishment.\nLater, Zagreus was born to Hades and Persephone. Unknown to Thanatos, Zagreus was stillborn, which caused great despair for Persephone and ultimately made her leave the Underworld. This made Thanatos erroneously believe that she was just unhappy staying in the Underworld, and had no idea that Zagreus's death was the cause of her departure. In secret, his mother Nyx managed to restore Zagreus back to life and raised him as her own son on Hades' orders. Over the years, both boys bonded and became great friends. \nThere was also a time when Thanatos lost his chthonic companion Mort and was very sad over it.\nWhen Zagreus starts his escape attempts, Thanatos is too busy fetching mortals due to the ongoing war and thus is not aware of them until much later. He eventually returns and hears of them and sets out to look for Zagreus. The prince assumes his presence is another of his father's way to stop him, which greatly annoys Thanatos who is, in fact, helping him out, and of his own free will.\nThanatos is deeply hurt when he finds out Zagreus is thinking of leaving, namely for not having been told beforehand. However, as time passes and Zagreus continues to attempt to escape, Thanatos keeps helping him, despite the risks, and comes to understand his motives better. He's still sad Zagreus won't stay in the Underworld with him and those that cared for him and watched him grow.\nAfter the epilogue, Thanatos is glad that Zagreus' family matters are taken care of, and that Zagreus won't actually leave for good.\nHades II.\nThanatos was caught and frozen in time without his weapon by &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt; along with the other members of the House of Hades. &lt;a href=\"Moonstone%20Axe\"&gt;The Moonstone Axe, Zorephet&lt;/a&gt; ended up in the possession of &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;, who could unlock the &lt;a href=\"Moonstone_Axe%23Aspects\"&gt;Aspect of Thanatos&lt;/a&gt; on the Nocturnal Arm.\nAffinity.\nIf given &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;, Thanatos will give you the &lt;a href=\"Pierced%20Butterfly\"&gt;Pierced Butterfly&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter 6 bottles of Nectar, further gifts will be locked until you complete his favor.\nAfter completing his favor, giving Thanatos &lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt; will give you &lt;a href=\"Companion%20Mort\"&gt;Companion Mort&lt;/a&gt; in exchange.\nThanatos' affinity gauge is maxed out at 10 hearts, requiring the gifting of 6 Nectar and 4 Ambrosia total.\nIf affinity is maxed out with Thanatos, there will be unique text above his keepsake. this text states: \"From Thanatos; you share an undying bond\" as well as \"with whom should death belong, if not with blood, with life?\"\nFavor.\nThanatos' favor is not mentioned, and acts more as a narrative event between Zagreus and Thanatos.\nBeating Thanatos after giving him 6 Nectar will randomly prompt a discussion between the two about Zagreus being powerful enough to escape the Underworld without Thanatos' help. Once Zagreus proves his strength to Thanatos, Thanatos can be given Ambrosia the next time he is encountered in the House of Hades.\nRomance.\nReaching maximum affinity with Thanatos will unlock a scene in &lt;a href=\"Zagreus%27s%20Room\"&gt;Zagreus's Room&lt;/a&gt;, where Zagreus can either begin a romantic relationship with him or continue as friends. Thanatos, &lt;a href=\"Dusa\"&gt;Dusa&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt; can be romanced at the same time with no negative repercussions.\nIf Zagreus is able to fully romance both Thanatos and Megaera, another scene will be unlocked in Zagreus\u2019s Room, in which he, Thanatos and Megaera meet up and can begin a polyamorous relationship.\nEncounters.\nAfter seeing either &lt;a href=\"Alecto\"&gt;Alecto&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Tisiphone\"&gt;Tisiphone&lt;/a&gt; for the first time, Thanatos has a chance to first be seen after the 3rd chamber of Elysium. Once this occurs, Thanatos has a chance to appear in any area except for the Temple of Styx. He may appear at the beginning of any encounter (excluding Trials of the Gods or Survival Rooms). This initiates a contest where they compete to slay more foes than the other, for that encounter. The spawn rate of foes is noticeably higher and the encounter lasts three waves. If Zagreus either kills more enemies than Thanatos does or ties his total, he will award Zagreus a &lt;a href=\"Centaur%20Heart\"&gt;Centaur Heart&lt;/a&gt;. Zagreus and Thanatos are immune from each other's attacks.\nThanatos has two types of attacks that can instantly kill foes, even those with &lt;a href=\"Gameplay%20mechanics\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, during the contest:\nThanatos's attacks are slow and delayed, which gives Zagreus a chance to kill the enemies and claim more points.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Elysium\"&gt;Elysium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Wheel\"&gt;Flame Wheels&lt;/a&gt; that self-destruct are not counted as points. Exalted warriors count as two points, once when they are wielding weapons, and another time when they are in their weapon-less soul form. Exalted warriors will not spawn a soul when Thanatos kills them, but only count as one point for him.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\nMerchandise=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

{"id": "2518", "revid": "48934972", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2518", "title": "Thanatos/Relationships", "text": "Family.\nNyx.\n&lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;: Thanatos's mother.&lt;br&gt;Thanatos holds great respect for his mother and consistently shows deference towards her. To him, Nyx's word is law, not just for him but for everyone else as well. He can't even bring himself to get angry with Zagreus for commuting Sisyphus' sentence simply because he knows Nyx must have approved it herself. In fact, his unwavering belief in Nyx's words even leads to a quarrel with Zagreus, where he reprimands the prince for continuing to talk to Dusa, despite Nyx instructing him not to. This may have earned him the reputation of being a \"momma's boy\" among other Chamber subordinates.\nIt is implied that Thanatos doesn't handle criticism well and doesn't appreciate when others offer their opinions about the way he works. He doesn't take well to his mother's disrespect when she suggests that he's doing more than his fair share of work, even though it's hypocritical because both are helping Zagreus. They share similarities in that they both operate in the shadows, working against Hades to assist Zagreus, and he knows her well enough to understand that she rarely changes her mind on matters related to the state of the House of Hades.\nAs his mother and superior, Nyx encourages Thanatos to strive for excellence in his work due to its importance. He offers to help her with domestic matters, but she encourages him to continue helping in his own way.\nHypnos.\n&lt;a href=\"Hypnos\"&gt;Hypnos&lt;/a&gt;: Thanatos's twin brother.&lt;br&gt;Despite being twins, Thanatos and Hypnos have notably distinct personalities. While Hypnos is relaxed and carefree, Thanatos is efficient and focused.\nThanatos considers his brother too monotonous and finds his work approach uninspiring. He views Hypnos as inattentive and inefficient, leading Thanatos to not pay much attention to him. It seems that Hypnos spends more time chatting and doing other things besides actual work, which makes Thanatos believe it's not a good idea to invest too much time in him. Even when Hypnos delivers a quality report, Thanatos remains skeptical, presuming that someone else must have helped him.\nDespite Thanatos' seemingly distant behavior, in his own way, he genuinely cares about Hypnos and sees it as an encouragement for improvement. He intervenes when Hypnos is at risk of losing his job. Thanatos is the first to notice Hypnos's passion for writing letters, and this time, he invests trust in him by offering assistance through task lists to help him manage his time more effectively. Although he doesn't express it openly, Thanatos secretly acknowledges Hypnos's improvements.\nZagreus also plays a pivotal role in fostering a better relationship between the twins. He encourages Thanatos to be more compassionate towards Hypnos and points out how \"cruel\" he has been to his brother. Thanatos takes this advice seriously, making an effort to be less harsh with his brother, resulting in a gradual improvement in their relationship over time.\nCharon.\n&lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;: Thanatos's brother.&lt;br&gt;Charon is an enigmatic figure in the Underworld, and Thanatos finds himself just as perplexed as the others. When Zagreus inquires about Charon, even Thanatos is unable to provide any insights into the boatman or his intentions, hinting that Zagreus may have a deeper understanding of Charon than he does. Interestingly, when Thanatos deploys the Companion Mort to engage Charon, he greets Charon enthusiastically with a hearty \"Hail, brother!\" This suggests a peculiar connection or familiarity between them.\nMoreover, during friendly combat between brothers, Thanatos occasionally mimics Charon's distinctive battle cry, the \"Hraaaagh!\" This curious behavior implies that there may be more similarities or shared experiences between Thanatos and Charon than either of them openly acknowledges.\nNemesis.\n&lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;: Thanatos's sister.&lt;br&gt;Thanatos looks at his sister with caution and doesn't appear to be close to her, but he recognizes her crucial role in providing shadows for the underworld.\nMoros.\n&lt;a href=\"Moros\"&gt;Moros&lt;/a&gt;: Thanatos's brother.&lt;br&gt;\nEris.\n&lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt;: Thanatos's sister.&lt;br&gt;He rarely mentions her and hesitates even to evoke her name.\nThe Fates.\n&lt;a href=\"Fates\"&gt;The Fates&lt;/a&gt;: Thanatos's sisters.&lt;br&gt;Despite all being children of Nyx, Thanatos isn't close or even in contact with his prophetic sisters.\nChaos.\n&lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt;: Thanatos's grandparent.&lt;br&gt;\nHouse of Hades.\nZagreus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;: Thanatos' colleague/childhood friend/potential lover&lt;br&gt;Zagreus and Thanatos are childhood friends and share a connection that goes beyond mere colleagues in the Underworld. Depending on the chosen path, their bond can evolve into something deeper.\nOver the years, they have cultivated a close and rigorous connection. From Thanatos' perspective, Zagreus is like a burning flame of unpredictability. Throughout the years, Thanatos nurtured feelings for Zagreus that surpassed friendship, though it seemed apparent to everyone except Zagreus himself, and even Thanatos was \"too occupied\" to risk leaving the friendship zone.\nWhen Zagreus made the decision to leave the Underworld without informing the God of Death, Thanatos was visibly hurt. However, he continued to assist Hades' son in his endeavors. Their relationship is marked by affectionate banter and moments of mutual care. Nevertheless, underlying tension persists as Thanatos is tasked with collecting the souls of mortals whom Zagreus helps escape from the Underworld.\nThanatos becomes disheartened by how Zagreus frequently trivializes serious matters. Between a fifth bottle of Nectar and a first bottle of Ambrosia, he confronts Zagreus, demanding rigorously to know what he truly desires in their relationship. Even as he accepts Zagreus's advances, Thanatos asks that Zagreus not take his distant silence personally.\nDespite their contrasting personalities, they may eventually form a romantic connection. This inexplicable attraction possibly stems from the fact that Thanatos is the God of Death, while Zagreus is the God of Life, Blood, and Rebirth. There is a magnetic attraction between them, uniting them despite their differences, which explains the attraction to the God of Death.\nMegaera.\n&lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt;: Thanatos' colleague.&lt;br&gt;Megaera and Thanatos they are Zagreus's childhood friends and are long-time coworkers and friends. They are bound together by their mutual frustration over being deceived by Sisyphus in the past. This shared history has created a strong bond between them. Additionally, in the present, they both share a sense of frustration (along with some reluctant affection) towards Zagreus.\nIf Zagreus chooses to pursue a romantic relationship with Thanatos, he will reveal that Meg encouraged him to confess his feelings. This suggests that there is a level of trust and openness between Megaera and Thanatos.\nIt's possible that the three of them may eventually form a polyamorous relationship. Their relationships can evolve based on the player's choices, with both parties comfortable with it.\nHades.\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;: Thanatos' boss.&lt;br&gt;Thanatos, much like his boss, values maintaining order within the House, and Hades has no issues with the accuracy of soul collection. As a result, Hades holds Thanatos in high regard due to his strong work ethic.\nZagreus, the defiant son of Hades, had a penchant for challenging the status quo within the realm. Thanatos, initially loyal to Hades and the House's traditions, found himself torn between allegiance to his employer and empathy for Zagreus' cause. Thanatos chose to assist Zagreus without Hades' knowledge, all while continuing his regular work for Hades, effectively maintaining a dual role.\nCerberus.\n&lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt;: Thanatos' friend.&lt;br&gt;He used to take care of Thanatos and Megaera when they were very young. They still play with Zagreus from time to time.\nSkelly.\n&lt;a href=\"Skelly\"&gt;Skelly&lt;/a&gt;: Thanatos' colleague.&lt;br&gt;While not unpleasant about it, he is a fan of Thanatos and is very pleased if Zagreus summons him when Than and Zag have a body count contest.\nDusa.\n&lt;a href=\"Dusa\"&gt;Dusa&lt;/a&gt;: Thanatos' colleague.&lt;br&gt;When dating Thanatos, Dusa lets slip to having thoughts about Zagreus and Thanatos, imagining lately \"the things they do together,\" blushing in panic before going into further detail. At least Thanatos must acknowledge that Dusa works better than her brother.\nAchilles.\n&lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt;: Thanatos' colleague.&lt;br&gt;In the Codex, it is stated that Achilles hard encourages the relationship between Zagreus and Thanatos.\nPersephone.\n&lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt;: Thanatos's queen.&lt;br&gt;Their relationship was little explored, and Thanatos drops hints to Zagreus about his relationship with Persephone, suggesting that one of his eyes was inherited from her. He implies that he, like everyone else in the underworld, used to say she was an exemplary queen.\nUnderworld Residents.\nSisyphus.\n&lt;a href=\"Sisyphus\"&gt;Sisyphus&lt;/a&gt;: The Tortured Soul.&lt;br&gt;The former king had once tricked Thanatos to dodge his own death. This earned the ire of the god of Death, as well as many of the other gods of the Underworld. His ire continues to persist, even ages after the fact, and continues to distrust Sisyphus despite his changed demeanor after being punished, and even with Zagreus' support of the former king.\nOlympian Gods.\nAres.\n&lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;: God of War.&lt;br&gt;Thanatos is quite perplexed when Zagreus tells him how much Ares sings his praises. When asked what his opinion is of Ares, Thanatos admits that he doesn't like Ares' views on death, but at least appreciates that he is genuinely cordial to him, unlike most other Olympians. Ares sometimes tells Zagreus to send his regards to the god of death or just take the time to ask if he's doing well. He'll also be fully on board if Zagreus and Thanatos ever become a couple, saying that Zagreus has chosen a good mate.\nHermes.\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;: Fellow psychopomp.&lt;br&gt;Thanatos: Although Thanatos ends up bumping into Hermes at some point and likes to stay well informed at work, he finds the way Hermes delivers information irritating.&lt;br&gt;"}

The widest circle has three stones placed over it, which are equidistant to each other. All stones have a distinct symbol written over their surface.\nThe smallest circle is in the middle of the widest. Instead of marking the grass, it marks a round stone with a circle, a triangle, and a collection of inscriptions. Around the markings, there can be seen what appears to be a slice of pomegranate, a shard of darkness stone, and two gold coins (it is indistinguishable if the coins are the ones made my &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt; or if they are still &lt;a href=\"Charon%27s%20Obol\"&gt;Charon's Obol&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; transports herself directly above this circle when losing a run.\nLiving Space.\nThis area is the main part of the overall tent. Its limits are defined by an assortment of purple fabric (which could presumably be silk provided by &lt;a href=\"Arachne\"&gt;Arachne&lt;/a&gt;, considering the colors are similar to the silk robes she provides Melino\u00eb when aiding her in her run) that seem to hang from above, and inside, there can be seen an assortment of books, flasks, and rugs addorning the space in a very organized fashion (unlike &lt;a href=\"Zagreus%27s%20Room\"&gt;Zagreus's Room&lt;/a&gt;, which, according to the &lt;a href=\"Narrator\"&gt;Narrator&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hades%20%28game%29\"&gt;the first game&lt;/a&gt;, was in a \"perpetual state of dissarray\".)\nIn the middle of the living space, there is a small table with a lit candle above it and a cushioned seat. In the back of the living space, there is a small area, not unlike a shrine, Melino\u00eb dedicated to her missing family (her father &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;, her mother &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt;, and her older brother &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;) On a corner table with a bouquet and pomegranates sits a piece of parchment paper with an unfinished portrait of Melino\u00eb as a baby surrounded by her family; a portrait &lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt; brought with herself when fleeing the fallen &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsually, &lt;a href=\"Dora\"&gt;Dora&lt;/a&gt; can be seen floating in this living space.\nThe Cauldron.\nA section of &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt; usually occupies along with four &lt;a href=\"Wretched%20Witch\"&gt;witches&lt;/a&gt;. This area is surrounded by pottery, all filled with a liquid that constantly lets off steam. Towards the right side, thick tree roots can be seen framing a large circle inscribed on the ground, which is marked with runes and symbols.\nIn the middle of this circle is a large cauldron, which is constantly filled with green, boiling liquid. This cauldron can be used by &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; to concoct &lt;a href=\"Cauldron\"&gt;incantations&lt;/a&gt;.\nNemesis' Post.\nA section of &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt; usually occupies along with two tall &lt;a href=\"Shade\"&gt;guard shades&lt;/a&gt;. This area is defined by a circular lining of stone filled with mosaic tiles. Over this area, there is an assortment of pottery, also filled with liquid, and filled with burning embers. The edges of Nemesis' post are surrounded by rocks and tall, pale grass.\nOdysseus' Post.\nA section of &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Odysseus\"&gt;Odysseus&lt;/a&gt; usually occupies. It is small compared to other areas, only consisting of a short path of planks, a wooden table with a piece of purple fabric, and a silver foundation with inscriptions marked on the perimeters of its top. This foundation holds a pot filled with liquid and an assortment of lit wax candles.\nHypnos' Corner.\nAn area of &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; reserved for &lt;a href=\"Hypnos\"&gt;Hypnos&lt;/a&gt;. This section is demarcated by a collection of six tall pillars surrounding a tiny patch of dark stone flooring. This patch of stone and the tops of the pillars are all surrounded by a field of &lt;a href=\"Poppy\"&gt;poppies&lt;/a&gt;, which are the flowers known to symbolize sleep. \nThree &lt;a href=\"Shade\"&gt;shades&lt;/a&gt; can be seen always accompanying Hypnos as he sleeps in the middle of this area. Two of them hold a makeshift hammock, also littered with poppies, for Hypnos to sleep comfortably on, and one of them stands guard behind him, constantly.\nHecuba and Gale.\nBehind The Cauldron's space, in the beginning of the game, there is an area dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt;'s two pets: &lt;a href=\"Hecuba\"&gt;Hecuba&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gale\"&gt;Gale&lt;/a&gt;. Hecuba is a dog with black fur wearing a silver collar and bronze bracelets on its front paws. Gale is a polecat with light brown fur wearing a green rope collar. They often go out to scout the area and perform other errands for Hecate.\nUnfortunately, after unlocking The Hot Springs, they completely vanish from the entire game. Since the &lt;a href=\"The%20Olympic%20Update\"&gt;Olympic Update&lt;/a&gt;, Hecuba can be obtained as &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;'s fourth &lt;a href=\"Animal%20Familiars\"&gt;Animal Familiar&lt;/a&gt;, found later in the &lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Mourning\"&gt;Fields of Mourning&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Pathway to the River.\nBelow &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb's&lt;/a&gt; Tent, there is an area which is mostly empty, save for a few mushrooms, stones, and a large gate with a red rune painted on it guarded by two tall &lt;a href=\"Shade\"&gt;shades&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt;, when visiting &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;, will usually occupy this area .\nIn the beginning of the game, by trying to engage with the gate, it is understood that the River Cocytus, the body of water that runs through &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;, has flooded, and therefore, it is impossible to traverse beyond the gates.\nThe gates only get unsealed after performing an incantation at The &lt;a href=\"Cauldron\"&gt;Cauldron&lt;/a&gt; to unlock The Fishing Pier.\nUnlockable Sub-Locations.\nThe Fated List.\nAn area of &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; may check the predictions the &lt;a href=\"Fates\"&gt;Fates&lt;/a&gt; weaved for her journey. Once unlocked by concocting the Fated Intervention incantation in The &lt;a href=\"Cauldron\"&gt;Cauldron&lt;/a&gt;, the list will be placed to the right of it over a small ring of stone. The list itself and its decorations float above the ground, and around them, plants and mushrooms grow. A fortune teller crystal ball floats on a pot with liquid behind the list, and on its right, is located a small cushioned seat.\nAfter concocting the Doomed Beckoning incantation in The &lt;a href=\"Cauldron\"&gt;Cauldron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moros\"&gt;Moros&lt;/a&gt; will usually stand by the list.\nThe Garden.\nAn area of &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; may plant the &lt;a href=\"Seeds\"&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt; she finds during her runs when using the shovel. This area is located below Odysseus' Post and, once unlocked by concocting the Flourishing Soil incantation in The &lt;a href=\"Cauldron\"&gt;Cauldron&lt;/a&gt;, the garden can be progressively developed by concocting more spells; at first unlocking two additional plots of soil (Rich Soil incantation), then another additional two (Verdant Soil incantation).\nOccasionally, &lt;a href=\"Odysseus\"&gt;Odysseus&lt;/a&gt; will walk by the garden to check on the plants.\nThe Hot Springs.\nAn area of &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; may unwind alongside a guest of her choosing. The Hot Springs are unlocked after concocting the Rite of Vapor-Cleansing incantation in The &lt;a href=\"Cauldron\"&gt;Cauldron&lt;/a&gt;, and may be used after offering &lt;a href=\"Bath%20Salts\"&gt;Bath Salts&lt;/a&gt; to a potential guest.\nThe Springs comprise a round green-glowing pool of warm water that has the &lt;a href=\"River%20Phlegethon\"&gt;River Phlegethon&lt;/a&gt; as its heat source. Thick slabs of light-colored stone partially covered with grass make the flooring around the pool and five pillars draped in leaves and blue fabric adorn the edges of the area alongside stones marked with the same symbols seem in Melino\u00eb's Tent's ritual circle. &lt;a href=\"Shade\"&gt;Shades&lt;/a&gt; can be seen floating around the warm water with towels around their midsections as if about to submerge themselves, despite most likely not being able to feel the heat.\nOnce the Hot Springs are used, in-game time is fast-forwarded to the equivalent of traversing 12 chambers.\nThe Fishing Pier.\nAn area of &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; may unwind alongside a guest of her choosing. The Fishing Pier is unlocked after concocting the Rite of River-Fording incantation in The &lt;a href=\"Cauldron\"&gt;Cauldron&lt;/a&gt;, and may be used after offering the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Lures\"&gt;Twin Lures&lt;/a&gt; to a potential guest.\nThe Fishing Pier comprises a short wooden dock with a wooden square archway. The River Cocytus surrounds most of the area, and on its surface, multiple lily pads float about. On the edges where the water meets the ground of &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; there are sprouts of weeds and moss that make the scenery.\nOnce the Fishing Pier is used, in-game time is fast-forwarded to the equivalent of traversing 16 chambers.\nThe Taverna.\nAn area of &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; may unwind alongside a guest of her choosing. The Taverna is unlocked after concocting the Rite of Social Solidarity incantation in The &lt;a href=\"Cauldron\"&gt;Cauldron&lt;/a&gt;, and may be used after offering &lt;a href=\"Ambrosia/Hades%20II\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt; to a potential guest.\nThe Taverna has a design that is reminiscent of &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;the Lounge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hades%20%28game%29\"&gt;the first game&lt;/a&gt;: There are four tables distributed about the space, each supporting sets of plates and cutlery alongside a floating star-shaped candle. There's a pot held over a bonfire in the center of the Taverna, and on the left, back side, there is a bar structure made of a hollowed-out tree trunk and a wooden counter, where a &lt;a href=\"Shade\"&gt;shade&lt;/a&gt; stands behind.\nFurther in the game, once the incantations \"Summoning of Personal Insights\" and \"Summoning of Historical Travails\" are completed, both the &lt;a href=\"Record%20Keeper\"&gt;Record Keeper&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Learned%20Sage\"&gt;Learned Sage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shade\"&gt;shades&lt;/a&gt; will occupy the Taverna, respectively.\nOnce the Taverna is occupied, in-game time is fast-forwarded to the equivalent of traversing 20 chambers.\nThe Broker's Shop.\nA place in &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; where the &lt;a href=\"Wretched%20Broker\"&gt;Wretched Broker&lt;/a&gt; will reside when the \"Summoning of Mercantile Fortune\" incantation is completed in The &lt;a href=\"Cauldron\"&gt;Cauldron&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Broker's shop is much more quaint, if compared to the way it used to be in &lt;a href=\"Hades%20%28game%29\"&gt;the first game&lt;/a&gt;: The broker does not sit behind a counter like he once did, and the luxury before provided by the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt; is completely gone. Even so, the Broker's business does not seem to have waned a bit, if the piles of &lt;a href=\"Darkness\"&gt;darkness stone&lt;/a&gt;, golden coins, and &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;nectar&lt;/a&gt; the Broker floats beside are taken into account.\nJust below the Broker, a small wooden pier holding a chest can be seen. The chest is &lt;a href=\"Obol_Points%23Charon%27s_Stash\"&gt;Charon's Stash&lt;/a&gt;, and it can be used by &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; to order special items by spending &lt;a href=\"Obol%20Points\"&gt;Obol Points&lt;/a&gt;."}

A silver skull with the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt; symbol scried on its forehead and a green laurel wrapped around its cranium decorates the middle of the archway alongside lengths of rope. On the ground directly below, a rectangular slab of stone with an etched pentagram on the center glows green anytime Melino\u00eb walks over it alongside a collection of candles and incense sticks. Cards are strewn about the entire structure.\nThe Silver Pool.\nThe Silver Pool is an area of the training grounds &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; may use to unlock different &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal%20Arms\"&gt;Nocturnal Arms&lt;/a&gt; to aid in her journey.\nPhysical Description.\nIt comprises a sculpture in the middle of the training Grounds formed by a collection of circles. The main circle is the biggest, and it contains a border made of stone that separates the grass from violet mosaic tiles. In the middle of it, there is a smaller circle-shaped pool that is shallow enough to resemble a puddle. Star shapes and moon sculptures decorate the perimeter of the pool.\nAnother six circles, also bordered with stone, are tangentially attached to the main circle; all are equidistant to each other. Each circle has, in its middle, a mosaic of tiled shapes that imitate different phases of the moon (full moon, waning gibbous, third quarter, waning crescent, waxing crescent, and first quarter). For each mosaic (except for the first quarter moon representation) has a Nocturnal Arm floating above it.\nA last circle below the main one is distinguished by being filled with a darker variant of grass. This last circle contains another six circles; tangentially attached to it, and all are equidistant to each other. Four have a mosaic inside it representing the new moon phase, while two others have a mosaic representing the full moon phase. After a few runs, The Gathering Tools become available to unlock, upgrade, and equip, and those float over the new moon phase mosaics.\nSchelemeus' Post.\nAn area of the Training Grounds where &lt;a href=\"Skelly\"&gt;Schelemeus&lt;/a&gt; occupies.\nLike in the &lt;a href=\"Hades%20%28game%29\"&gt;first game&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;, Schelemeus makes himself avaiable to &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; as a training dummy so she can learn and understand the mechanics of the &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal%20Arms\"&gt;Nocturnal Arms&lt;/a&gt; she unlocks and, eventually, command the shades around him to attack him after having concocted the Necromantic Influence incantation in the &lt;a href=\"Cauldron\"&gt;Cauldron&lt;/a&gt;. Schelemeus will also provide Melino\u00eb with tips and tricks about different reagents, ores, incantations, and so on so she may go further in her journey.\nPhysical Description.\nIt comprises a small, circular patch of light stone surrounded by three training dummies and &lt;a href=\"Shade\"&gt;shades&lt;/a&gt;.\nStatues.\nOnce you have completed a number of runs affected by the &lt;a href=\"Oath%20of%20the%20Unseen\"&gt;Oath of the Unseen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Schelemeus\"&gt;Schelemeus&lt;/a&gt; will reveal a set of 3 statues initially covered by tarps. Like the statues of &lt;a href=\"Skelly\"&gt;Skelly&lt;/a&gt; from the first game, these \"rewards\" are revealed by completing runs with a high enough Fear level from the Oath.\nThe Moonlit Hills.\nAn area of the training grounds &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; may use to gaze upon the moon to gather her thoughts and courage before venturing on another run.\nThe Gateways.\nAn area of the Training Grounds where the warded passageways to the Underworld and the Surface are located.\nPhysical Description.\nIt comprises a stone-bordered circle on the ground over a dark purple patch of grass. On two opposing sides of this circle are located the warded passageways to the Underworld, unsealed and guarded by two tall &lt;a href=\"Shade\"&gt;guard shades&lt;/a&gt;, and to the Surface, also guarded by two tall guard shades, but sealed.\nThe Pitch-Black Stone.\nA structure located in the Training Grounds. It serves no purpose until &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; has traversed &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Gate\"&gt;Chaos Gates&lt;/a&gt; an arbitrary number of times and given Chaos at least one bottle of &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;nectar&lt;/a&gt; ().\nPhysical Description.\nIt comprises a dark violet crystal with a metal decoration littered with red-magenta eyes reminiscent of &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt; hugging its bottom."}

Only three of the six rivers appear in the first game. The other three appear in &lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;, with one of them being a major location.\n&lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Styx\"&gt;Temple of Styx&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce a majestic temple dedicated to honoring all of the &lt;a href=\"Chthonic%20Deities\"&gt;deities&lt;/a&gt; of the Underworld, in more recent years the temple has fallen into a state of disrepair. It is notable for being the only way in or out of the Underworld with Achilles mentioning that no other known entrance exists in the world. \n&lt;a href=\"Erebus\"&gt;Erebus&lt;/a&gt;.\nA dark forgotten corner of the Underworld which appears to be only accessible via an &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Gate\"&gt;Infernal Gate&lt;/a&gt;, it is home to the Shades who were unfortunate enough to not have any coins on them when they died, as Charon in Greek mythology would refuse to give a soul passage to the rest of the Underworld without proper payment first.\nNotably the Minotaur &lt;a href=\"Asterius\"&gt;Asterius&lt;/a&gt; was stated to have ended up in Erebus after his death before Theseus was able to convince Hades to allow him into Elysium.\nIt's also implied that Charon might also reside in Erebus when off duty, as whenever Zagreus tries to steal from him, the ferryman teleports them both to a specialized dojo like area in Erebus so he can beat up the prince as punishment.\nBy the time of Hades II, Erebus has been invaded by overgrown plants, destroying the structures that existed there. &lt;a href=\"Arachne\"&gt;Arachne&lt;/a&gt; has made it her home here.\n&lt;a href=\"Oceanus\"&gt;Oceanus&lt;/a&gt;.\nA watery area of the Underworld reserved for Shades who have died at sea. \nNotably, the shade Narcissus moved from Asphodel to here after &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt; opened the Underworld's gates. \n&lt;a href=\"Elysium\"&gt;Elysium&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe final resting place of the souls of the heroic and the virtuous in the Underworld. \nNotably, the shade &lt;a href=\"Odysseus\"&gt;Odysseus&lt;/a&gt; was said to reside here before moving to &lt;a href=\"the%20Crossroads\"&gt;the Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; as of the events of Hades II. \n&lt;a href=\"Asphodel\"&gt;Asphodel Meadows&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe section of the Underworld where the souls of people who lived lives of equal good and evil rest. \nFields of Mourning.\nAn area of the Underworld where those who have died heartbroken dwell. \n&lt;a href=\"Tartarus\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe section of the Underworld where people who were evil during their lives are sent to face eternal punishment for their crimes after death. Workers of the House of Hades also reside here. \n&lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt;.\nA lavish estate located in the very heart of Tartarus. It is home to most of the Chthonic gods and is also where all the newly deceased souls gather to be judged by Hades personally. \n&lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Gate\"&gt;Chaos Gates&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocated even deeper than Tartarus itself, the strange realm which the primordial Chaos chooses to call home has long been a source of mystery and intrigue both among mortals and deities alike. Many have speculated what hidden secrets may lie within just waiting to be discovered, but very few have ever managed to successfully reach it to find out and even fewer have ever returned to tell exactly what it is they've found there. \nDeities.\nThe Underworld is the main destination for all deceased people and creatures after death, however, it is also home to powerful deities such as &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;, who act as the celestial bureaucracy and who are in charge of running the various day-to-day activities of the Underworld.\nThe Dead.\nAll souls of deceased people and creatures go to the Underworld after they die. Most mortals who enter the Underworld after death, seem to appear primarily as &lt;a href=\"Shade\"&gt;Shades&lt;/a&gt;. However, there have been exceptions to this rule in the past. As great heroes such as &lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Patroclus\"&gt;Patroclus&lt;/a&gt; for example are allowed to keep their physical bodies after death. The villains and other neutral individuals dead have also been shown to keep their physical forms such as &lt;a href=\"Sisyphus\"&gt;Sisyphus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eurydice\"&gt;Eurydice&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn some cases, depending on what sort of life a Shade might've had back when they were alive, they will begin undergoing a physical transformation eventually becoming terrifying creatures known as the Perilous Foes. These formidable Shades makeup the majority of Hades security forces within the Underworld to ensure that no one ever escapes."}

{"id": "894", "revid": "47838920", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=894", "title": "Theseus", "text": "Theseus is a former hero and king of Athens, most famous for slaying the &lt;a href=\"Minotaur\"&gt;Minotaur&lt;/a&gt;. He was recruited by &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; to help prevent &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus's&lt;/a&gt; escape. He fights alongside the Minotaur as the final boss of &lt;a href=\"Elysium\"&gt;Elysium&lt;/a&gt;, and serves Elysium as its champion and its king.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nTheseus, often proclaiming himself as \"the great king of Athens,\" is a hot-headed, stubborn, and even childish ex-hero, but he is best known for his youthful exploits that were significant enough to earn him an immortal soul and boast for eternity in &lt;a href=\"Elysium\"&gt;Elysium&lt;/a&gt;.\nTriumphant Theseus is a pompous and arrogant man, perpetually proud and confident in his victories. Most residents outside of Elysium can't stand him because of this. Theseus will occasionally shine during dialogue when he feels particularly proud of himself. The complete opposite of &lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt;, Theseus is immodest and acts more like a schoolyard bully than a noble ex-hero.\nHe tends to interpret things to the extreme and dismiss evidence that doesn't fit his preconceived notions - thus, he will push &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;' buttons. In his mind, Zagreus is useless and not a true warrior, despite accumulating multiple victories against Theseus. Zagreus' attempts at conversation are taken as lies and deception, and he will not accept any provocation if Zagreus says that there are better &lt;a href=\"Heracles\"&gt;Heroes&lt;/a&gt; than him.\nAn overly confident warrior in his winning streak, Theseus puts on a show for the crowd. He doesn't accept defeat and can behave in a dramatic and comically immature manner. When Zagreus defeats him in combat, &lt;a href=\"Asterius\"&gt;Asterius&lt;/a&gt; becomes exasperated if Theseus continues to cry over Zagreus. But he has shown a noble and redeemable side, revealing that he used to be more modest, and deep down, he is a noble hero, as seen when he freed Asterius from his imprisonment and accepted him as a worthy comrade, sharing his champion title.\nDespite becoming a broken pedestal for Zagreus, there are enough hints scattered through dialogue that Theseus was indeed a great hero when he was still living: Hades speaks rather highly of him. Given how cynical he is, the fact that Hades continues to hold respect for him and gave him such a high station in Elysium is telling. Asterius' Undying Loyalty towards Theseus is rooted in the fact that it was thanks to Theseus that he was allowed to end up in Elysium. The Olympians offer Theseus their blessings. The Olympians are noted as being rather fickle, and despite both Poseidon and Dionysus considering Theseus to be a blowhard, they still view him as worthy of their blessings.\nPhysical description.\nHe and &lt;a href=\"Asterius\"&gt;Asterius&lt;/a&gt; wear identical clothes, with the only difference being that Theseus keeps his left shoulder uncovered and wears a wide belt around his waist. He is a muscular man who overdid the tan, his blond hair styled back (which in the past was long, similar to &lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt;'), and he always maintains a confident expression on his face. His height is similar to &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;'. He can transform into a sophisticated battle outfit that includes a golden mask and ammunition on his chest.\nThe Portrait, Exalted Hero item depicts Theseus in his youth. In it, he dorns a blue cape with yellow details and a cloak pin with the Zodiac symbol of Taurus, more likely a reference to his connection with bulls throughout many of the stories related to him rather than that being his actual Zodiac sign. His hair is longer and his skin isn't as tanned as it is in-game. His right arm is cover in some red fabric hold together with line by the elbow.\nHistory.\nPast.\nTheseus's own birth was a complicate mess. His father, Aegeus, the king of Athens, was childless and asked the Oracle of Delphi for advice. He did not understand her prophecy and sought further advice from his host, king Pittheus of Troezen, who in turn understood the prophecy and thus got Aegeus drunk and gave him his daughter Aethra. However, following &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena's&lt;/a&gt; instructions, Aethra wandered off in the middle of the night to the island of Sphairia near Troezen. There, she poured a libation to Sphairos and &lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;, and the God of the Seas possessed her for the remainder of the night. Thus Theseus was partly divine, as per usual in demigods.\nWhile his mother was pregnant, his father Aegeus would return to Athens, but only after leaving his sandals and sword behind for Theseus to one day uncover. Theseus spends his youth with his mother in Troezen, helping her with multiple tasks and strengthening himself. Now a young man, he uncovers the items left behind by his father and makes way to Athens to reunite. He has the choice to go by sea or land, and chooses the latter, travelling alone through the dangerous Saronic Gulf and defeating six vicious bandits, specifically killing them the same way they kill others.\nWhen he reached Athens, he didn't reveal his true identity right away. His father gave him hospitality, but was suspicious of his intentions. &lt;a href=\"Medea\"&gt;Medea&lt;/a&gt;, Aegeus's wife, recognized Theseus and afraid that he would become the heir instead of her son Medus, arranged to have Theseus killed during the capture of the Marathonian Bull, a symbol of Cretan power. He was successful in the hunt, however, and so instead Medea tried to poison him, but Aegeus recognized his son at the last second and knocked the poison cup away from his hands. Thus, father and son were finally reunited.\nDue to a previously lost war, Athens was charged with sending fourteen youths, seven males and seven females, every Great Year to Crete to feed the &lt;a href=\"Asterius\"&gt;Minotaur&lt;/a&gt;. Theseus eventually volunteered to go one day in place of one of the youths with the intent to end his people's suffering. Upon arrival, he met &lt;a href=\"Ariadne\"&gt;Ariadne&lt;/a&gt;, with whom he had a fleet affair and also lent him a ball of yarn to help him find his way around the labyrinth. With yarn in hand, Theseus made his way through the labyrinth's corridors and eventually found and fought the Minotaur bare-handed, leaving victorious. On his way back to Athens, Ariadne accompanied him and they stopped on the Island of Naxos, where Theseus eventually abandoned her, but she was later rescued by &lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheseus would come to go on multiple adventures later on, mostly accompanied by his friend Pirithous, himself a son of &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;. One such adventure of them has them going to the Underworld to kidnap &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt; for Pirithous. They manage to reach &lt;a href=\"Tartarus\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt; and, feeling tired, decide to sit down to rest. However, they can't get up when they try, now that they're stuck in the rocks. It would only be later when &lt;a href=\"Heracles\"&gt;Heracles&lt;/a&gt; came to get &lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt; for his last labour that Theseus would see himself free, but Pirithous had to be left behind as when they tried to take him out, the whole Underworld shook.\nFollowing that trespassing, Theseus is exiled from Athens and seeks refuge in the island of Skyros. He would eventually be thrown off a cliff by Lycomedes, drowning and dying in the process.\nUpon reaching the Underworld, now dead, he came to be aware of Asterius's, the Minotaur, predicament and used his status as king to negotiate with Hades and have Asterius live in &lt;a href=\"Elysium\"&gt;Elysium&lt;/a&gt; with him, claiming the Bull of Minos had been his most formidable opponent in life and deserving of living among the other formidable warriors. They've since shared the title of Champion of Elysium.\nHades.\nTheseus was tasked by Hades to stop Zagreus's escape attempts by guarding the Elysium Stadium.\nEpilogue.\nJust like everyone else, Theseus too is aware of the Queen's return, but refuses to believe she is Zagreus's mother. He'll keep guarding the exit of Elysium whenever the prince attempts an escape.\nWith the Pact of Punishment, Theseus receives the Macedonian Tau-Lambda, designed by &lt;a href=\"Daedalus\"&gt;Daedalus&lt;/a&gt; himself, and supposedly the best chariot ever made. He becomes very attached to it, to the point of avenging it whenever Zagreus destroys it in battle. It's also Theseus that apparently does the repairs afterwards, though it's possible he might have help.\nAs the battles go on, Theseus starts to lose heart. With Zagreus constantly inviting Asterius to join him, the King begins to imagine that come true day by day, eventually breaking down completely and declaring their friendship over. It would be in the next fight that Asterius would remind Theseus that he'd always follow him, and lift Theseus's spirits once more.\nAffinity.\nTheseus cannot be given &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt;.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\nMerchandise=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}
{"id": "4758", "revid": "34189", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4758", "title": "Theseus/Combat", "text": "Theseus is always encountered in the Elysium Stadium, the final chamber of Elysium, alongside &lt;a href=\"Asterius\"&gt;Asterius&lt;/a&gt;. The Stadium is a large circular arena with indestructible pillars in the center. Some of these pillars act as stands for an audience to watch the duel between Zagreus and Theseus. The ring of the stadium is also outlined with spectators as well.\nTheseus will begin the fight with access to all of his main attacks: Spear Spin, Spear Throw, and Charge.\nTheseus also carries a shield to defend himself from attacks. All attacks that hit Theseus from the front will be blocked, and do no damage to him. (The exception to this is any projectile created by an &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Boons\"&gt;boon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"cast\"&gt;cast&lt;/a&gt; will ignore the shield and deal damage. Additionally, any projectile with a \"piercing\" effect offered by a &lt;a href=\"Daedalus%20Hammer\"&gt;Daedalus Hammer&lt;/a&gt; will ignore his shield and deal damage.)\nWhen Theseus is reduced to 50% max HP, he will become briefly invulnerable and enter his second phase. In his second phase, he has access to a new passive ability, Olympian Aid. After his invulnerability ends, he will call for aid from a random Olympian, who will assist Theseus against Zagreus in the fight. Theseus can only call for aid from an Olympian who has not yet given Zagreus a boon in the current run. Theseus will never call for aid from &lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;. If Zagreus has boons from every Olympian, Theseus will call for aid from Artemis.\nWhile initially calling, the Olympian will spawn damaging circles at Zagreus' position very quickly, doing damage if Zagreus stands in them when they activate. After this, Theseus will resume his normal attack pattern, and an aid attack below will happen every 10 seconds, depending on which Olympian was called. Theseus' attacks will also be given the Olympian's respective curses.\nThe damage from Olympian Aid is counted as Theseus' attacks, thus if Theseus is affected by &lt;a href=\"Status%20effects\"&gt;Weak&lt;/a&gt;, the damage from Olympian Aid attacks will be reduced as well.\nIf Asterius is killed before Theseus, Theseus will become enraged, moving and attacking at a faster rate. Theseus will also lose access to Charge.\nExtreme Measures.\nWhen using Extreme Measures Level 3 from the Pact of Punishment, Theseus will be outfitted in a golden mask and armor set. He will also appear riding a bronze Macedonian Tau-Lambda, supposedly the strongest chariot to have ever been made. His normal weaponry will be placed with two miniguns which he will mount onto his chariot.\nWhile outfitted in his beautiful chariot, the fight with Theseus has notable changes:\nReward.\nWhen both Theseus and Asterius are defeated in the Elysium Stadium, Zagreus will be awarded with &lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt; if Bounty conditions are met. This means that it must either be Zagreus' first victory against them with a weapon, or the Target Heat must be met for that weapon.\nOtherwise, they will drop 150 &lt;a href=\"Darkness\"&gt;Darkness&lt;/a&gt;. (The Darkness reward is improved by Dark Thirst, &lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Ocean's Bounty&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe order in which you defeat Theseus and the Minotaur does not matter for Bounties. Beating Theseus last, after you've already beaten Asterius last on the same Heat, won't award you any bounties for that Heat level again."}

{"id": "2509", "revid": "48934972", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2509", "title": "Theseus/Relationships", "text": "Friends.\nAsterius.\n&lt;a href=\"Asterius%20\"&gt;Asterius &lt;/a&gt;: Theseus's colleague and best friend.&lt;br&gt;Theseus and Asterius, despite their unimaginable friendship, are fighting brothers. Asterius respects Theseus greatly, but also seems aware of his foibles, even if he forgives them. Although Asterius is responsible for keeping Theseus in line, he is incredibly grateful and loyal to his companion. Theseus once killed Asterius in life, but later requested his release from &lt;a href=\"Erebus\"&gt;Erebus&lt;/a&gt;, granting him a place in &lt;a href=\"Elysium\"&gt;Elysium&lt;/a&gt; and the title of Champion. The two have formed a strong bond, complementing each other's strengths and making a formidable team in the battles of the underworld. Their camaraderie and loyalty are a testament to the power of true friendship.\nHouse of Hades.\nZagreus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;: Prince of the Underworld.&lt;br&gt;Theseus dislikes Zagreus, constantly throwing accusations and demeaning him by calling him names such as monster, hellspawn, daemon, fiend or blackguard. No matter how hard Zagreus tries to convince him of his innocence, Theseus will refuse to believe or change his opinion of him. Later in the game, Theseus will accuse Zagreus of trying to ruin his friendship with Asterius, who is more friendlier with Zagreus, and only serves to fuel his disdain of him. Likewise Zagreus also dislikes Theseus, although at first Zagreus held him in high regard due to his legend as a great hero; however that all ended once he met the arrogant Athenian.\nNonetheless, Theseus acknowledges Zagreus' strength and battle powress, seen as when he comments \"a clean hit\" and others upon being hit, as well as confessing he fears he might grow to acknowledge said strength.\nHades.\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;: Theseus's boss.&lt;br&gt;He recognized Theseus and Asterius as his champions. Hades summoned them to defeat his rebel son in whatever way they desired.\nOlympian Gods.\nDionysus.\n&lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;: God of Wine.&lt;br&gt;Dionysus dislikes Theseus for abandoning Ariadne on an island, despite her having helped him against her own family. Nonetheless, he will still heed Theseus's call if the latter requests his help when fighting Zagreus.\nPoseidon.\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;: God of the Sea.\nTheseus seems to think that, at least in life, he was Poseidon's favorite. Poseidon, however, doesn't look so fondly at the former hero, displeased by Zeus calling him his son. He'll still aid Theseus in battle if called upon.\nOthers.\nAriadne.\n&lt;a href=\"Ariadne\"&gt;Ariadne&lt;/a&gt;: Asterius' sister&lt;br&gt;Ariadne fell in love with Theseus and gave him a ball of yarn to prevent him from getting lost in the labyrinth. However, on the way back to Athens, Theseus abandoned Ariadne on the island of Naxos, breaking her heart. If Zagreus brings the &lt;a href=\"Yarn%20of%20Ariadne\"&gt;Yarn of Ariadne&lt;/a&gt; to their battles it greatly annoys him and he begins to belittle Ariadne, who he considered to be naive and that her feelings for him was not his responsibility to reciprocate and the only thing he cherised about her was that she helped him meet Asterius. However, during the last exchange about the Yarn, Asterius will be upset at Theseus' constant demeaning of his sister. Theseus apologizes to his friend and promises that he will one day seek Ariadne to reconcile.\nHeracles.\n&lt;a href=\"Heracles\"&gt;Heracles&lt;/a&gt;: Greek hero and former aquaintance\nBack in life, these two heroes knew each other and even helped each other out occasionally. One such remarkable moment was when Heracles rescued Theseus from spending eternity forever stuck in the Underworld. How they actually looked upon each is unknown, but they likely had some respect for the other's strengths and accomplishments.\nThe first time Zagreus mentions Heracles in front of him, Theseus will accuse Zagreus of trying to make him jealous before triumphantly adding that he sees through Zagreus' scheme. This subtly hints that Theseus sees himself as an inferior before Heracles."}

{"id": "836", "revid": "55390750", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=836", "title": "Tisiphone", "text": "Tisiphone is one of the three sisters &lt;a href=\"Furies\"&gt;Furies&lt;/a&gt;. She is the intermediate sister of &lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alecto\"&gt;Alecto&lt;/a&gt;, she does not initially appear in the game, as both she and Alecto are busy with matters in the mortal world. Tisiphone is responsible for punishing those who have committed murder.\nAfter Megaera has been defeated a certain number of times, Alecto and Tisiphone will begin appearing, randomly substituting her in Tartarus. Tisiphone does not appear in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt; after she's been defeated.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nOne of the relentless &lt;a href=\"Furies\"&gt;Fury sisters&lt;/a&gt;, Tisiphone is the most emotional and mentally unstable of the three sisters, and \"murder\" and \"murderer\" are the only words she can say. Like her sisters, she prevents &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; from reaching his destiny.\nDue to her limited vocabulary, there may be errors in interpretation, as she was specifically assigned to torment those who committed \"murder\" in their mortal lives.\nShe tends to take things seriously and reacts strongly to anything that disturbs her. As a result, she is often the target of teasing, especially by Zagreus, who seems to consider her just a little shy, and who will constantly try to add a new word to her vocabulary.\nShe is obsessed with her work, like &lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alecto\"&gt;Alecto&lt;/a&gt;, who also take their work seriously, although she is not as sadistic as Alecto. Tisiphone practically lives for it. Zagreus and Meg wonder if this amount of work has led her to her current state of madness.\nPhysical description.\nIn contrast to her sisters, Tisiphone's face resembles that of a withered corpse. She has black eyes with bright yellowish green ascleres and a catatonic expression. Tisiphone has pale skin and foggy light green hair, with a single wing protruding from her back that appears to be blue from a different angle. Her eyes are piercing green, and she has prominent cheekbones. She wears a similar outfit to her sisters, but in green. Her forearms are wrapped in bandages, and she wields a large whip-like weapon. She exudes an aura of ferocity and anger, fitting for her role as one of the enforcers of punishment in the Underworld.\nHades.\nAfter Megaera has been defeated multiple times, Hades will summon both Tisiphone and Alecto to deal with Zagreus.\nAfter the epilogue, Tisiphone will continue to oppose Zagreus at the end of Tartarus.\nAffinity.\nTisiphone cannot be given &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt;.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\nMerchandise=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Titan or Titaness) were the second generation of deities who inherited the universe after their creators, the &lt;a href=\"Primordials\"&gt;Primordials&lt;/a&gt;, chose to step down. Unlike their predecessors, the Titans were cruel and merciless tyrants who would regularly kill and torture those they deemed inferior to them which in their eyes was everyone. \nEventually, they were overthrown by their own godly children, the &lt;a href=\"Olympians\"&gt;Olympians&lt;/a&gt;, and were exiled to the deepest and darkest pit of &lt;a href=\"Tartarus\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt; for all eternity. The Olympians then took over the duty of ruling the Universe. \nNot all Titans were banished to Tartarus at the end of the war, some who had aided the Olympians during the conflict such as &lt;a href=\"Prometheus\"&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Selene\"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt; were given positions of power within the new world order after the Olympians became the new rulers of the universe.\nHistory.\nBefore the reign of the Olympians, the Titans were the rulers of the world who were said to be extremely cruel and terrible beings, so much so that eventually, their own children rose up in rebellion against them. This started the war known as the Titan War, in which both Titans and Gods fought for supremacy over the world. Eventually, the Titans were defeated, their remains sliced up into many pieces and thrown into the pits of &lt;a href=\"Tartarus\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt; so they could never regenerate and to serve as their eternal prison.\nAfter the war, the three sons of Chronos drew lots to divide the rulership of the world; &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; would rule the Heavens, &lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt; the Sea and &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Underworld\"&gt;Underworld&lt;/a&gt;.\nHades.\nThe Titans do not make an appearance in \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;\", having been imprisoned in Tartarus by the Olympians long before the events of the game.

The broker also offers a limited deal following each run. Each limited deal may only be traded once, with new ones appearing every run, and allows trading &lt;a href=\"Darkness\"&gt;Darkness&lt;/a&gt; in addition to other rewards. \nRepeatable Trades.\nRepeatable trades only let you convert materials in the sequence Gemstones \u2192 Chthonic Keys \u2192 Nectar \u2192 Diamonds \u2192 Ambrosia \u2192 Titan Blood. They do not let you reverse this sequence or make trades involving darkness.\nAnalysis of Limited Time Offers.\nThere are three types of limited time offers available at the broker: indirect trades that give a better rate of exchange compared to what you can get with repeatable trades, trades that let you reverse the conversion sequence in repeatable trades, and trades involving darkness.\nValues from the Item and Offer Price columns are what appear in-game (eg. 1 Nectar for 10 Gemstones).\nIndirect trades.\nThese trades convert resources in the same direction as the repeatable sequence Gemstones \u2192 Chthonic Keys \u2192 Nectar \u2192 Diamonds \u2192 Ambrosia \u2192 Titan Blood, but skipping steps and at a better rate. The Repeatable Price column shows how much you would pay if you used Repeatable Trades to obtain an item instead of the Limited Time Offer. The Savings column shows the percentage savings that the Offer Price represents, compared with the Repeatable Price.\nReverse trades.\nThese trades convert resources in the opposite direction as the repeatable sequence Gemstones \u2192 Chthonic Keys \u2192 Nectar \u2192 Diamonds \u2192 Ambrosia \u2192 Titan Blood. The \"efficiency\" of such a trade is how much of the original resource you can get back using repeatable trades. Though the 1 Titan Blood \u2192 200 Gemstones trade has the worst efficiency compared to repeatable trades, it can actually be used with the 15 Chthonic Keys for 1 Titan Blood indirect trade to get back more than you started with: 1 Titan Blood \u2192 200 Gemstones \u2192 20 Chthonic Keys \u2192 1 Titan Blood + 5 Chthonic Keys. You can also use the alternate sequence 1 Titan Blood \u2192 200 Gemstones \u2192 20 Nectar \u2192 2 Ambrosia \u2192 2 Titan Blood, but this involves 22 separate indirect trades and would take many runs to accomplish.\nDarkness trades.\nThe 3 other currencies (Nectar, Ambrosia, and Chthonic Keys) are converted to Gemstone equivalents via Repeatable Trades. For the first two rows you can think of this as letting you buy darkness with gemstones (indirectly using repeatable trades). For the last two rows, you can think of this as letting you use darkness instead of gemstones to buy items. \nDue to the direction of the trade (Darkess to Gemstone vs. Gemstone to Darkness), sometimes a high ratio is good and other times a high ratio is bad. The Efficiency column shows the \"value\" you get out of the trade (using the first row of 1 Darkness = 1 Gemstone).\nTrade manipulation.\nCertain limited trades can result in infinite titan blood. Runs must be repeated to get the needed titan blood, gemstones, or keys. First, you must sell your titan blood for 200 gemstones. Then, you must buy 20 keys with that. Then, later, you can trade 15 keys back for 1 titan blood and 5 extra keys. You can repeat this process to get exponentially more resources."}

He is the older brother of &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; and is the &lt;a href=\"Characters\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHe always had a sense that he doesn't belong in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt;. After finding out the truth about his lineage, he decides to escape the underworld no matter what, going against his father's will.\nHe is aided and encouraged in his journey by his mentor &lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt; and his caretaker &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;, who puts him into contact with the Olympian Gods who grant him boons to make him more powerful during his escape attempts. Despite their aid, they only see him as a half-god.\nIn his escape attempts, Zagreus will start at Tartarus, continue upwards and end his journey at the surface, where he cannot stay for long and must return back down along the river. Along the way, he may meet &lt;a href=\"Sisyphus\"&gt;Sisyphus&lt;/a&gt; and other friendly faces who will help him, as well as &lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt; the shopkeeper who sells his various powerful wares.\nZagreus is met with many obstacles in his journey upwards such as aggressive shades working for his father and has run-ins with the guardians of each region like the &lt;a href=\"Furies\"&gt;Furies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Hydra\"&gt;Bone Hydra&lt;/a&gt;, and the champions of Elysium &lt;a href=\"Theseus\"&gt;Theseus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Asterius\"&gt;Asterius&lt;/a&gt; - culminating in a fight against his father, Lord &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;. Losing all of his health at any point results in an express trip back home.\nZagreus is mentioned in &lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;, as he is &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;'s brother and part of the driving force of her mission.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nDespite being born in the &lt;a href=\"Underworld\"&gt;Underworld&lt;/a&gt;, unlike most residents of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt;, Zagreus is laid-back and characterized by his good humor, kindness, and tireless persistence. Although he is friendly, he is also restless, reckless, and stubborn, which often complicates his relationships. His confident attitude, sarcasm, and occasional lack of awareness can lead to turbulent dynamics, especially with those close to him, and his constant attempts to escape leave others, like &lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;, exhausted.\nZagreus is known for his self-deprecating humor and has a complex about \"bleeding red,\" feeling as if he is the god of nothing, unlike others in the House. His emotionally distant relationship with Hades has left him harboring frustration and anger from a toxic upbringing, preferring to neglect the tasks assigned to him and fueling his determination to escape his hellish prison and find purpose, as well as find his mother.\nZagreus demonstrates a natural inclination to mend relationships and often uses his influence to strengthen connections. He makes a point of getting close to everyone he meets, frequently offering gifts of &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt; to build bonds. His interactions with his &lt;a href=\"Olympians\"&gt;Olympian&lt;/a&gt; relatives are marked by respect and politeness, even though he is aware of his occasional shortcomings.\nThe young prince is notably forgiving and friendly with the residents of the House and the peaceful inhabitants of the Underworld. However, this does not prevent him from feeling frustration with certain characters, such as &lt;a href=\"Hypnos\"&gt;Hypnos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Theseus\"&gt;Theseus&lt;/a&gt;, who seem to constantly irritate him, although he strives to be kinder to Hypnos.\nAs a warrior, Zagreus takes pride in his combat skills but feels conflicted about taking the lives of living beings, such as the Satyr Cultists and the Giant Worms, even when he gives in to the violence that accompanies his battles, even in a realm where death is common.\nHe is na\u00efve about the &lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;surface&lt;/a&gt; world due to his sheltered upbringing. His curiosity about simple things makes him seem strange to others. Zagreus is unaware of birds and other land creatures, highlighting his innocence and desire to learn about &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;'s owl and &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;'s quails.\nPhysical Description.\nZagreus has spiky black hair and wears a burning laurel crown on his head. He has differently colored eyes, his mother's green on his left and his father's red on his right. He has pale skin and is physically strong and muscular. Like his father, his feet are constantly on fire. He is often described as short. He bleeds red due to having mortal blood.\nHe wears a black and red toga, decorated with bone white belts leading to triple-headed hound skulls on his shoulder. His arms are adorned with red ribbons and bracelets.\nHades.\nZagreus is the son of &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;, god of the dead, and &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt;, goddess of verdure. As the &lt;a href=\"Fates\"&gt;Fates&lt;/a&gt; prophesied that Hades would never have an heir, Zagreus was born dead. Heartbroken, his mother fled the Underworld. However, Nyx used her power and the aid of her daughters to revive him without Persephone's knowledge. From then on, Nyx raised him as her own son, and he was trained and mentored by &lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs Zagreus' sense of unrest about his family grew, he asked &lt;a href=\"Hypnos\"&gt;Hypnos&lt;/a&gt; to put a spell upon the house and sought the truth. Once he found out Persephone is his birth-mother after rifling through Hades' desk and finding a letter written by her hand, he was dead set on getting out of the underworld to find her. He quit his job at the administrator's chamber and set out to find Persephone with Nyx's help, despite Hades' insistence that there is no escape from the Underworld. He then got in contact with Athena, and from there, the rest of his relatives - who were under the impression he is Nyx's son, trying to get to Olympus. All but Hermes were oblivious to his true goal.\nAt the end of every escape attempt, Zagreus must confront his father and vanquish him in order to leave and see Persephone. Since their first meeting, she is overjoyed to meet her son. However, he cannot stay on the surface for long due to his chthonic blood, and after a brief conversation he perishes and goes down the river Styx and back to the house. Each time, they discuss the circumstances under which Persephone arrived in the underworld and her relationship with Hades as she is hesitant to go back, fearing she will be discovered by Olympus and a war will break out. After numerous victories, Hades lets him go freely and Persephone agrees to return to the Underworld, with Charon as their ferryman.\nImpressed by his ability to pass through Underworld defenses, Hades hires Zagreus back to keep escaping and finding breaches in the Underworld's security in an official capacity.\nAfter the family is reunited and many bonds have been formed with his relatives, Persephone hatches a plan to peacefully resolve the potential conflict her absconding could cause. A great feast is held in the House of Hades after Zagreus personally invites all the Olympians, and most of everything is set straight with careful wording and a bit of deception.\nHades II.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt; escapes his imprisonment in Tartarus and captures the residents of the House, Zagreus is trapped. He appears in a painting that was commissioned right after Melino\u00eb is born, which she sees as a grim motivator to rescue her family.\nCodex entry.\nCompleting the Epilogue will unlock the complete Codex Entry. \nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\nMerchandise=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nAdditional notes.\n\"For additional information about Zagreus that does not pertain to &lt;a href=\"Hades%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;, see Wikipedia's article: .\""}

{"id": "2484", "revid": "29110118", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2484", "title": "Zagreus/Relationships", "text": "Family.\nHades.\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;: Zagreus's father.&lt;br&gt;Zagreus has a bitter relationship with his father Hades, who seems to think of him as lazy, naive, and foolish. The two frequently bicker, and Hades thwarts his escape attempts at every turn. Zagreus's memories of his father's treatment of him spur him on at the beginning of his escape attempts. Upon Persephone's return and subsequent encouragement, the two eventually come to something of an understanding, with Hades making Zagreus' escape attempts an official job to stress-test the security of the Underworld. By the time of Persephone's return, Zagreus' relationship with his father has improved significantly, in part due to her presence. However, Zagreus is still not able to forgive his father's rude and bitter treatment over the years, while Hades expects no such grace, and instead recognizes that it is his fault in the first place. During their fights on the surface, after the Epilogue, they will mock each other with trivial matters in a lighthearted manner, while showing mutual respect for their skills and combat abilities.\nPersephone.\n&lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt;: Zagreus's birth mother.&lt;br&gt;For most of his life, Zagreus was unaware of the existence of his mother or their relation to each other. He had been led to believe that Nyx was his mother. The realization of her existence was one of the reasons for his attempts to escape. Upon meeting her, he discovers that she also did not know of his existence. She had been led to believe that he had died at birth and was left in mourning. She becomes ecstatic with the news that her son is alive. The two immediately connect, discovering that they are very similar. With each meeting, they learn more about the circumstances of their separation and why the truth was kept from them. Eventually, through Zagreus' persistence, Persephone formulates a plan to finally ease the tension between the Chthonic and Olympian gods. She decides to return to the underworld exclusively for him.\nMelino\u00eb.\n&lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;: Zagreus's younger sister.&lt;br&gt;At some point after the events of the first game, Hades and Persephone had a second child, Melino\u00eb, making her Zagreus's sister. Their relationship is currently unknown as Zagreus was imprisoned by the Titan of Time, Chronos, shortly after Melino\u00eb was born. However, the unfinished painting Melino\u00eb has shown Zagreus looking happy at his baby sister.\nNyx.\n&lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;: Zagreus's foster mother.&lt;br&gt;Though Zagreus is initially shocked to learn that Nyx is not his biological mother, he was understanding, and they remained on good terms. Nyx supports his decision to leave and helped him contact the Olympians. Zagreus eventually learns that Nyx's intervention was the reason that Zagreus exists at all, due to her pulling a favor with her daughters, the Fates, to revive Zagreus when he died at birth. Zagreus has the option of reuniting Nyx with her parent, &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, after their years of separation and no contact. He is grateful for all that Nyx has done and considers himself fortunate to have two wonderful mothers.\nCerberus.\n&lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt;: Zagreus's beloved pet and best friend.&lt;br&gt;He is affectionate towards Zagreus, and is quite mournful when he leaves. Zagreus also refuses to fight Cerberus and dislikes his father using him as a way to guilt him into staying, implying emotional harm and potential physical harm (since the two would eventually have to fight should Zagreus continue his escape attempts) on the pet as a result of his son leaving. \nHouse of Hades.\nAchilles.\n&lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt;: Zagreus's mentor.&lt;br&gt;Achilles is his ideal male role model and a father figure to he, having taught him to fight, Zagreus holds Achilles to an incredibly high regard. He supports Zagreus's escape attempts and expresses pride in his progress. Upon receiving a 5th nectar bottle, Achilles takes Zagreus's generosity for possible romantic affection and apologizes, explaining that his heart belongs to someone else. Zagreus's reply implies he already 'kind of' felt that was the case and whatever affection he bestowed to Achilles were not for such a pursuit. Zagreus eventually has the option to reunite Achilles with his former lover, Patroclus, in Elysium, through relaxing the terms of Achilles' contract with the House of Hades.\nMegaera.\n&lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt;: Zagreus's colleague/possible lover.&lt;br&gt;Zagreus and Megaera appear to have some past history, but their relationship has since ended due to a mistake from Zagreus part. Megaera is aloof and hostile towards Zagreus and thinks his escape attempts are foolish. Further strain is placed on their relationship each time they have to fight to the death. Eventually, Hades brings the other two Furies into play on attempts to stop Zagreus from escaping, and their turns standing guard take some of the pressure off Megaera. Zagreus has the option to mend their relationship and rekindle their romance.\nDespite their history, Zagreus and Megaera are also longtime friends, having agreed to put the past behind them. During downtime at work, Zagreus interacts normally with Megaera and Thanatos, often sharing drinks together. These moments provide brief respites from Zagreus's escape attempts, though Megaera remains steadfast in her duty. Zagreus is aware that he's putting Meg in a difficult position but feels compelled to pursue his goal, even if it means seemingly neglecting his responsibilities at home.\nAs their battles grow increasingly intense, Zagreus and Megaera's interactions take on a dynamic that Zagreus seems to enjoy, with Megaera exhibiting traits akin to a dominatrix. \nDespite this, there's a hint of friendly competition between them as their clashes escalate. In the midst of this tension, Zagreus has the option to mend their relationship and reignite their romance.\nThroughout his journey, Zagreus also helps Megaera reconnect with her sisters, showing that it wasn't all completely wasted time for her.\nThanatos.\n&lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;: Zagreus's colleague/possible lover.&lt;br&gt;He and Zagreus are childhood friends, both being raised by Thanatos's mother, Nyx. They share a deep bond despite their opposite ways and perspectives. Thanatos, severe and disciplined, and Zagreus, reckless and warm-hearted. Despite being hurt by Zagreus' choice to leave the underworld, Thanatos decides to support him on his journey.\nWhen Zagreus chooses to flee to the surface in search of his true mother without bidding farewell, he remarks, \"I thought you might just run from me, did you not?\" Thanatos responds coldly, \"Well, if you won't say it, I will. Farewell, Zagreus.\" Although Zagreus sees some dramatic flair in Thanatos' reaction, he realizes that Thanatos isn't genuinely angry with him. Instead, Zagreus' actions have put Thanatos in a difficult spot. On one hand, Thanatos chooses to help Zagreus behind Hades' back and despite his personal feelings for his closest friend, even if it means defying Hades and risking his position. Even when Hades discovers his complicity, he still continues to support Zagreus.\nZagreus understands Thanatos well, being one of the few who can see through his rigid armor and aloof demeanor. In Zagreus' eyes, Thanatos is a kind-hearted individual, albeit one who struggles to express it openly. With Zagreus bringing out Thanatos' playful side, a facet that few are aware he possesses.\nZagreus can eventually provoke a competitive streak in Thanatos, challenging him to see who can dispatch more enemies.\nDespite being a close friend and confidant, Zagreus may still find it challenging to get Thanatos to open up completely. Among all the romance options, Thanatos is the most elusive due to his busy schedule. When pursued, Zagreus may struggle with Thanatos' reserved nature, even though he understands that Thanatos doesn't mean any harm. The connection between them remains somewhat of a mystery, even to Zagreus, possibly owing to their respective roles in representing death and life/rebirth.\nHypnos.\n&lt;a href=\"Hypnos\"&gt;Hypnos&lt;/a&gt;: Zagreus's colleague.&lt;br&gt;Initially, Zagreus views Hypnos as an irritating younger brother, despite the fact that Hypnos is older than him. Hypnos consistently greets Zagreus upon his emergence from the Pool of Styx and often offers seemingly \"useless\" advice as a member of the reception team, surprising others in the Underworld with Zagreus's tolerance of him.\nHowever, as their story progresses, Zagreus begins to form a closer bond with Hypnos within the House of Hades. By paying closer attention to Hypnos and realizing his underlying loneliness and desire for companionship, Zagreus becomes more empathetic and friendly towards him. Zagreus even expresses uncertainty about feeling welcomed without Hypnos there to greet him after one of his escape attempts.\nDespite occasional unkindness, Zagreus notices Hypnos' joy in conversing with him each time Zagreus dies, and this sentiment is reciprocated. Zagreus is one of the few who pays attention to and genuinely enjoys Hypnos' company. Hypnos willingly puts the entire house to sleep at Zagreus's request, allowing him to explore freely. When Hypnos admits to being a fan of the Minotaur, Zagreus tries to obtain an autograph for him, but Zagreus can also choose to assist Hypnos in overcoming obstacles to get it himself. Additionally, Zagreus assists his brother in becoming kinder to him.\nAs their relationship deepens, Hypnos begins to see Zagreus not just as a friend, but as a \"true friend.\"\nDusa.\n&lt;a href=\"Dusa\"&gt;Dusa&lt;/a&gt;: Zagreus's colleague.&lt;br&gt;Zagreus deeply values Dusa's companionship, recognizing her as an invaluable ally within the House. Despite any discrepancies in their positions, he treats her with unwavering care and respect, fostering a warm and genuine bond between them that often leaves Dusa feeling both flattered and appreciated.\nInitially, Nyx harbors reservations about their friendship, particularly concerning Dusa's tendency to overextend herself. This disapproval leads to Dusa's sudden dismissal from her duties. However, Zagreus swiftly intervenes, advocating for Dusa's reinstatement and compelling Nyx to reconsider her decision, ultimately leading to Dusa's return to her role within the House.\nAlthough there is potential for romantic involvement, Dusa perceives Zagreus solely as a compassionate friend. Despite this, their relationship remains steadfast and supportive, as evidenced by Dusa's willingness to aid Zagreus in his quest to bring Persephone back to the Underworld.\nCharon.\n&lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;: Zagreus's colleague.&lt;br&gt;Initially, Charon is portrayed as a Determined and unwavering ferryman of the underworld. He prevents Zagreus from escaping and doesn't hesitate to engage in physical confrontations to fulfill his duty. Charon does not tolerate any attempts at deception by Zagreus. \nWhen Zagreus \"borrows\" from him (even though Zagreus considers it borrowing), Zagreus discovers that Charon is stronger than he thought. However, when Zagreus encounters him again, he is surprised to discover that Charon is not angry and actually reacts positively to Zagreus. Later, Zagreus realizes that Charon wasn't being sarcastic but genuinely happy to have a rival and competitor.\nAs the story progresses, Charon agrees to aid Zagreus in exchange for Obols, the currency of the underworld. Upon questioning other characters about Charon's compassionate behavior, Zagreus discovers that Charon's acts of kindness were undertaken willingly. This realization dawns upon Zagreus that Charon played a much more significant role in his escape attempts than initially perceived, displaying profound dedication to their cause, and perhaps even considering Zagreus as \"a good friend.\"\nSkelly.\n&lt;a href=\"Skelly\"&gt;Skelly&lt;/a&gt;: A &lt;a href=\"bloodless\"&gt;bloodless&lt;/a&gt; hired to help Zagreus as a training dummy.&lt;br&gt;Zagreus has a bantering relationship with Skelly, and they get along well enough, but Zagreus isn't a fan of how Skelly views wars and how eager he is to be dismembered, and he wonders what Skelly could have done in his past life to be that way.\nUnderworld Residents.\nOrpheus and Eurydice.\n&lt;a href=\"Orpheus\"&gt;Orpheus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eurydice\"&gt;Eurydice&lt;/a&gt;: A couple of musicians that Zagreus meets.&lt;br&gt;Zagreus is fond of the morose musician, and is upset when Hades casts him off into the depths of Tartarus for refusing to sing out of his depression for losing his muse, Eurydice. Zagreus has the option of both having him be returned to the House of Hades, and having the terms of his contract lightened so he may visit his muse in Asphodel. Zagreus overall tries to cheer the musician up and get him to sing more, even going as far to tell him tall tales to improve his mood. Eurydice reveals that many of Orpheus' songs were originally hers, but when Zagreus asks him about it, Orpheus reveals that he tried his best to give her proper credit and people just wouldn't listen. Zagreus and Eurydice grow to have a friendly, even neighborly, relationship where they chat about music or history or food, and she gives him prepared treats she's made. Gifts of nectar and Ambrosia are taken as ingredients for more cooking.\nSisyphus and Bouldy.\n&lt;a href=\"Sisyphus\"&gt;Sisyphus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bouldy\"&gt;Bouldy&lt;/a&gt;: The former king of Corinth and his companion who Zagreus meets in &lt;a href=\"Tartarus\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt; Recent escape attempts by Zagreus have left the &lt;a href=\"Furies\"&gt;Furies&lt;/a&gt; with little time to watch Sisyphus which allows him the occasional rest. After repeated interactions with Sisyphus, Zagreus is able to talk to Hades and Meg about lightening his sentence. Also after multiple conversations with Sisyphus, Zagreus gains the ability to communicate with Bouldy and offer him Nectar as a gift.\nPatroclus.\n&lt;a href=\"Patroclus\"&gt;Patroclus&lt;/a&gt;: A sullen warrior who Zagreus meets on &lt;a href=\"Elysium\"&gt;Elysium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;Patroclus doesn't open up easily to Zagreus initially, to the point where his name is only discoverable from the codex or by visiting wearing Achilles' Myrmidon Bracer. Repeated visits and talks work to gain the melancholic man's friendship, and Patroclus finds Zagreus' exploits entertaining in how they disturb the tranquility of Elysium. If Zagreus succeeds in reunite Achilles and Patroclus, it blossoms into a friendship as the grateful Patroclus' demeanor brightens enormously. Later, Patroclus teams up with Achilles in a double effort to help him.\nTheseus and Asterius.\n&lt;a href=\"Theseus\"&gt;Theseus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Asterius\"&gt;Asterius&lt;/a&gt;: The Champions of Elysium.&lt;br&gt;The two will stop Zagreus from passing. Zagreus finds them very strong, and sees them as training as well. \nAt first, Zagreus saw Theseus as a hero and was a fan, but that changed once he actually met him, turning to dislike him and all of his insufferable boasting. On the other hand, he finds a sort of kinship in Asterius, since both have grown in darkness, away from the surface and under very restricted environments, not to mention the far more approachable personality of the Minotaur. Thus, Zagreus often attempts to have a more casual chat with him, even wishing to not fight, but Asterius always refuses, claiming loyalty to Theseus and stay only with the King. \nAlecto and Tisiphone.\n&lt;a href=\"Alecto\"&gt;Alecto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tisiphone\"&gt;Tisiphone&lt;/a&gt;: Fury Sisters.&lt;br&gt;If Megaera fails, her younger sisters are summoned to capture him in her place. They don't make it easy for him. Even though he wants to get along with them and avoid confronting them. Despite everything, Zagreus managed to get Tisiphone to learn his name before the others, something no one had succeeded in before. When Alecto says she never wants to speak to him again, he cannot agree, irritating her, because they are Meg's sisters and he wants to get along with them.\nChaos.\n&lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt;: The ancestor of Zagreus.&lt;br&gt;Zagreus is respectful of his primordial ancestor, and in turn, they are fond of Zagreus, finding his actions and goals fascinating. Although normally disinterested in predictability and ever blunt, Chaos finds Zagreus's gestures of kindness and reverence refreshing, and aids the young god in their own way.\nOlympian Gods.\nThe Olympians, most of whom are aunts, uncles, and cousins to Zagreus, seem to sympathize with him and welcome him to join them on Olympus. They contact Zagreus during escape attempts, offering a friendly chat and &lt;a href=\"Boons\"&gt;Boons&lt;/a&gt; to aid him in his escape. They believe Zagreus is trying to escape so he can be with them; which is not the case as his objective is actually finding &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt;.\nZeus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;: Zagreus's uncle.&lt;br&gt;Zeus is proud of his nephew, often comparing him favorably to Hades (even jokingly offering to tell others that he is Zagreus's father instead of Hades). He occasionally brings up his distant relationship with his brother, and at one point brashly tries to have Zagreus mend their relationship by offering forgiveness to Hades, an attempt that only irritates Hades. Eventually Hades reveals to Zagreus that Zeus was the one who spirited away Persephone to the Underworld without telling anyone or asking Persephone's wishes, after learning of her discontent of Olympus and Hades' fondness of the goddess; Hades severed ties with his brother on this disrespect. Upon learning this, Zagreus thinks that his uncle might be the type to act without thinking of the consequences.\nPoseidon.\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;: Zagreus's uncle.&lt;br&gt;Poseidon is ecstatic to learn of Zagreus' existence, and shows a great fondness for his long lost nephew. Like the others, he offers his aid. Much like his younger brother, he sometimes compares Zagreus to Hades favorably. Zagreus will say how he considers him easygoing, wishing his father was more like Poseidon. Poseidon in turn is very fond of Zagreus wishing on going fishing with him and calls him his favorite nephew and refers to him as \"Little Hades\".\nDemeter.\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;: Zagreus's maternal grandmother.&lt;br&gt;Both Zagreus and Demeter are initially unaware of their relationship, that Demeter is Zagreus's grandmother through Persephone. Zagreus, like many of the other gods, shows reverence and a level of fear towards Demeter, who has developed a reputation of being ruthless and cold upon losing her daughter. He is often reminded of the potential repercussions of what she might do if she were to learn of the truth of Persephone's disappearance. When Persephone does eventually reveal herself to be alive (albeit with a slightly fabricated retelling of the events), Demeter's demeanor begins to soften simply out of relief; and she begins to regard Zagreus much more fondly, affectionately calling him her \"little sprout'\". However, despite undoing her eternal winter upon Persephone's return, she keeps the area around the Temple of Styx frozen over, out of lingering resentment over being deceived.\nArtemis.\n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;: Zagreus's cousin.&lt;br&gt;In her relationship with Zagreus, she refrains from using affectionate terms, addressing him solely by his name. He might perceive her as a distant figure, yet deep down, she harbors considerable nervousness and uncertainty in his presence. Artemis doesn't hesitate to admonish him whenever he engages in actions she disapproves of, such as succumbing to Dionysus' influence. However, if Zagreus manages to cultivate a stronger bond with her, she will reluctantly acknowledge, tinged with a hint of disdain, that he holds a place among her closest confidants, though not a priority for her.\nIn the codex, Achilles theorizes that Artemis finds common ground with Zagreus because, from her perspective, she feels they both share similar circumstances with their difficult relationships with their respective parents and not fitting into what should be considered their home. Although with Zagreus, it's a bit more complicated than meets the eye.\nIn Hades II, her friendship with Zagreus went further, with her making a personal commitment to herself to take care of his younger sister Melino\u00eb. She serves as Melino\u00eb's protector and aids her in her quest to defeat Chronos, acting as a mentor and big sister figure, something Zagreus couldn't be for Melino\u00eb at the beginning of her life due to being captured by Chronos.\nAthena.\n&lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;: Zagreus's cousin.&lt;br&gt;Athena was one of the first Olympians to reach out to Zagreus and offer her aid. She, like Artemis, seems personally invested in Zagreus's success and the idea of having her cousin reach Olympus, due to her interest in mending the tensions among her family. She has a good relationship with Zagreus's foster mother, Nyx, and admits to Zagreus that she envies their relationship due to not having a mother. When Persephone reveals her relationship with Hades and tells a false story of their apparent love-affair, Persephone suspects that Athena likely sees through the ruse, but due to her interest in keeping the peace in the family, chooses to play along with it.\nAphrodite.\n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;: The Goddess of Love and Beauty.&lt;br&gt;Aphrodite, like the other Olympians, takes an interest in Zagreus' escape attempts, She is very sweet and approachable to Zagreus, affectionately calling him \"darling\". She is acutely aware of the unresolved love tension between Zagreus and Megaera. She will act as a love advisor of sorts to Zagreus, and will support Zagreus if the two end up getting intimate again, she will chime in later and tell him that she is glad they were able to work this out once and for all. She will notice Zagreus and Dusa too. She also implies she had amorous intentions on Zagreus once he reaches Olympus, making him feel \"embarrassed\".\nAres.\n&lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;: Zagreus's cousin.&lt;br&gt;Ares is proud of his cousin and admires his capacity in bringing death (albeit to the already-dead); Zagreus on the other hand is a little wary of the god of war, due to his reputation of cruelty and violence. He shows interest in Zagreus' foster mother, Nyx, due to feeling a debt of gratitude for her role in his work as the manifestation of night herself and asks Zagreus to send his regards to her. The two eventually form a correspondence and meet in person with Zagreus's help (albeit with some unease on his part due to Ares violent, bloodthirsty nature and desire of violence). He seems to have a similar appreciation for Thanatos, and if Zagreus pursues a relationship with him, Ares will express approval at his cousin's choice of partner, though he admits he didn't expect Death himself to seek such companionship.\nDionysus.\n&lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;: Zagreus's cousin.&lt;br&gt;Initially, he helps Zagreus because he doesn't have anything else interesting to do, and it's been a long time since anything \"bombastic\" has happened. Dionysus shares a relaxed and genuine relationship with Zagreus and like the other Olympians, offers his aid to his cousin. He refers to him as \"zag\", \"guy\" or \"prince z\". At one point, the two collaborate together in pranking Orpheus, leading the musician to believe that the two are the same person. Dionysus plans to have an epic feast and party with Zagreus once Zagreus reaches Olympus.\nHermes.\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;: Zagreus's cousin.&lt;br&gt;Hermes is the only Olympian who has ever seen Zagreus in-person prior to the events of the game, due to his role as a Psychopomp and his working relationship with Charon; although like the rest of the Olympians, he appears to be unaware of Zagreus' true parentage. When he and the other Olympians are invited to the Underworld for a feast, he pretends to not have met Zagreus previously. It is unclear if he knew of Persephone's absconding to the Underworld prior the events of the game, but much like his sister Athena seems more interested in maintaining peace than getting the full story."}

He is &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;'s younger brother and &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;'s uncle. He offers &lt;a href=\"boons\"&gt;boons&lt;/a&gt; to his nephew which give his abilities chain lightning or lightning strikes.\nZeus' boons excel at dealing damage to groups of enemies, as chain lightning effects bounce between enemies, and lightning strikes can hit multiple enemies.\nHis signature &lt;a href=\"Status%20Curse\"&gt;Status Curse&lt;/a&gt; is Jolted, which causes enemies to inflict damage to themselves when they attack, consuming the Curse.\nZeus is one of five Olympian gods (the other four being &lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;) who will not appear in the very first run of a save.\nZeus returns in &lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt; and offer his boons to &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; in her fight against &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;. His new signature &lt;a href=\"Status%20Curse\"&gt;Status Curse&lt;/a&gt; is Blitz, which causes enemies to be hit with lightning after taking a certain amount of damage.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nThe King of the &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Olympians&lt;/a&gt;, Zeus appears gregarious, affable, and especially paternal, in contrast to his brusque &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;brother&lt;/a&gt;. However, this is only superficially. While his brother Hades is well-intentioned and fair beneath his exterior, Zeus is the opposite. In his essence, Zeus can be quite cunning, superb, displays a superiority complex, and possibly has the most inflated ego of the Olympians.\nZeus tries to act like a benevolent god, but even his acts of \"kindness\" are rooted in what pleases him. He is not afraid of the consequences of his actions and never takes responsibility. He seems unable to acknowledge that he participated, does not listen to others, and is always making fun of serious matters.\nZeus tends to act compassionate with &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;, offering encouragement, but he is also somewhat self-centered. He forces everyone to say something good about him, about how he is \"the most elegant, powerful, and divine of the gods.\" and can joke about his nephew having a \"Celestial Revenge\" if he accepts another benefit.\nZeus can be quite cynical, like when he likes to mention &lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;'s missing &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;daughter&lt;/a&gt; in their family conversations and commenting blatantly about how lamentable the whole case is, while acting as if he's just as perplexed as the others. However, he is absolutely aware that he is entirely responsible for the kidnapping of Persephone. His audacity also leads him to send his nephew to send a message to his father on his behalf, saying that \"Zeus forgives him,\" maddening Hades with fury with his contradictory insolence, despite having caused the all problem in question.\nZeus in his splendor is not purely selfish, as he was when he saved the cosmos by waging war against the Titans and dividing the world almost fairly with his brothers. He very much wanted to reconnect with Hades and liked Zagreus, wishing him as a son. Although in the most wrong way possible, he certainly saw Persephone as a \"gift\". Zeus realized that his older brother was alone in the underworld, liked Persephone, and that she reciprocated and wanted to leave Olympus. So he staged the kidnapping with her and brought her to Hades, in part to fix things with him and reconcile, however radical the approach.\nPhysical description.\nZeus appears as an imposing, elderly man with a tan skin tone and a loose robe revealing his musclebound chest. His hair and beard are stark white and emulate the clouds of his heavenly domain. He is armed with his signature lightning bolt, alongside two other bolts worn in his hair as a laurel wreath. He also adorns golden bracelets and rings.\nIn Hades II, Zeus now wears a muscle cuirass.\nHistory.\nBefore Hades.\nZeus is the third son of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Titans\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;, and like the rest of the Titans' children he rebelled with his siblings against their tyrannical rule. During the Titan War he wielded &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Aegis&lt;/a&gt; and defended his brothers and sisters from the Titans. After the Titans were defeated, Zeus and his older brothers &lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; would draw lots to decide how the world should be ruled. Zeus gained the Heavens, Poseidon the Sea and Hades the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Underworld\"&gt;Underworld&lt;/a&gt;. Zeus would rule as the King of the Gods in &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Mount Olympus&lt;/a&gt; and took &lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt; as his wife and queen and conceived two sons with her named &lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hephaestus\"&gt;Hephaestus&lt;/a&gt;. However despite his marriage, he would prove to be extremely unfaithful and have multiple affairs with other goddesses who conceived gods and goddesses, for example &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt; and others, and with human women who conceived demigods and demigoddesses, for example &lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heracles\"&gt;Heracles&lt;/a&gt; and others.\nKnowing his brother had an interest in Persephone and feeling sorry that Hades had gotten stuck with overseeing the Underworld, Zeus kidnapped the daughter of Demeter as a \"consolation prize\" for his brother. Hades, however, was not a party to this act and did not approve of Zeus' decision. While Persephone was happy for any reason to leave Olympus (a fact Zeus was aware of) and went with him willingly, she notes that even if she didn't want to go, Zeus still would have taken her.\nThis act led to his and Hades' estrangement, as in addition to his disgust at Zeus for treating Persephone like an object, this \"gift\" put Hades himself in a difficult position; Demeter would be enraged over her daughter's kidnapping if Hades returned her, but since Persephone didn't WANT to return to Olympus, he couldn't send her back anyway. \nHades, knowing the tendencies of his kin, assumed that if the Olympian gods were to find out the truth, total war would break out. Already at the limit of tolerance for Zeus's selfish antics, this final act caused Hades to cut Zeus and the rest of Olympus out of his life.\nHades.\nZeus appears to Zagreus after he attempts a second escape from the Underworld and offers his boons to his nephew to help him escape. Like the rest of the Olympians he believes that Zagreus wishes to join them in Mount Olympus not knowing his true goal is to find his birth mother; &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt;. He'll often talk of the pleasantries Zagreus will have once he's in Olympus.\nAs Zagreus gets closer to the truth, Zeus asks him to tell Hades that \"Zeus forgives him\". This only angers Hades further, but Zeus is unaware of that.\nEpilogue.\nAfter Persephone returns, she decides to hold a feast and invite the family to sort everything out. Zeus is obviously also invited, and content with the fake tale Persephone told that doesn't put him in any risks, he and Hades shake hands and consider this a matter solved. From then on, he'll keep lending Zagreus his help.\nHades II.\nAfter the events of the Hades, his father Chronos escaped his prison in Tartarus taking his brother Hades captive and launching a war against Olympus. Zeus in turn will offer his boons to his niece &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; to aid her in her quest to vanquish the Titan and his forces.\nAffinity.\nIf given &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;, Zeus will give you the &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Signet\"&gt;Thunder Signet&lt;/a&gt;.\nZeus' affinity gauge is maxed out at 7 hearts.\nFavor.\nZeus' favor involves hearing the other Gods' opinions of him, as well as seeing Zeus express a desire to reconnect with &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;, along with Hades' response.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\nMerchandise=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Is that...?\"\n\"Is this really him? OK. In the name of Hades! Olympus! I accept this message.\"\n Zeus : \n\"Greetings there, young man. Look, your father's always been rather difficult, and he's not so much as called in quite some time. You'll have a better home where you belong, here on Olympus! And to help you on your journey, have my blessing.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Lord Uncle Zeus lending his support...I never thought I'd see the day. Or night. Whenever.\"\nKeepsake Dialogue (&lt;a href=\"Keepsakes\"&gt;Thunder Signet&lt;/a&gt;).\nKeepsake Equipped.\n Zeus : \n\"Ah, must be my gleaming Thunder Signet that I transferred to you! Why, I could feel its call from all the way up here!\"\nReactions.\nBoon Bought From Charon.\nDialogue 01.\n Zeus : \n\"Why here I am, young man, in such strange circumstances I might add! Luckily the boatman Charon is much easier to get ahold of than your father!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus : \n\"I see the boatman of the Underworld has found the means to reach you with my blessing, Nephew. Such strange alliances we forge these days!\"\nLow Health.\nDialogue 01.\n Zeus : \n\"Why you look positively dreadful, Zagreus, that place is doing you no favors I can tell! Luckily I'll do you favors aplenty!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus : \n\"You seem in dire need of some assistance, Nephew, so of course I dropped what I was doing and then sought you out as quickly as I could!\"\nDialogue 03.\n Zeus : \n\"Well, let's face it, Zagreus, you are as good as dead right now. But you'll just slosh right back out of the River Styx, and give it a good try again, won't you?\"\nWeapons.\nWielding Aegis.\n Zeus : \n\"That shield of yours, called Aegis, why, in fact, it's mine from long ago, young man! I've no more need of it, of course, though how you found it, you shall have to tell me once you're here!\"\nWielding Aegis - Aspect Of Zeus.\n Zeus : \n\"Ah, now that's the Aegis that I know and love! Or used to love, at least, the dear old thing! Now I quite love these shocking bolts of mine. Though I am proud you've given Aegis a good home, and bear it in my name!\"\nWielding Coronacht.\n Zeus : \n\"It seems the bow called Coronacht is safe and sound there in your hands, young man.

An odd connection to a past or future beaerer, apparently one who defied a god.\"\nWielding Exagryph - Aspect of Lucifer.\n Zeus : \n\"Now that is an entirely unusual design, even for Exagryph! So then the waking-phrase has worked. That aspect's bearer, Lucifer, was it? Struck his own lord father! Tried to, anyway.

Zagreus, rather than greet you as I normally would do, instead allow me to present you my illustrious, kind, generous Lord Father, your greatest Uncle Zeus.\"\n Zeus : \n\"Um, thank you for the introduction daughter. Now, you run along, go frolic with your nymphs or something, leave me to assist my nephew here. Bestow on him your faint blessing if you must.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus : \n\"Now, Zagreus, once you arrive, we'll have to find for you a suitable mate, won't we? Fine young man such as yourself! Normally, there's much to choose from around here, with some exceptions, of course... such as my cunning daughter, Artemis. Willfully, uninclined to take a mate, at all!\"\n Artemis: \n\"Yes, Zagreus, in spite of all these perfect, chiseled prospects everywhere about, yearning to marry or embarrass me, for some reason, I prefer to spend my time mostly alone or with my nymph friends in the woods!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\n Poseidon: \n\"Now, little Hades, you have met my brother Zeus! He's sometimes known as the king of all the gods! Although, in many ways, he's not as powerful as I! Nor anywhere near as dashing. Why, I, oop--!\"\n Zeus : \n\"Now, Brother, you know better than to say such things about me, I should think! I know that tact does not come easily to you, though I'd be careful what you say to our good nephew there.\"\n Poseidon: \n\"Erm, anyway, as I was saying, little Hades! Brother Zeus is king of all the gods! And the most dashing, powerful, and--hey, let's face it--godliest of all!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Zeus : \n\"Now, now, young man, whatever you heard about good Demeter, I'm here to clear the air. She's like a sister to me, yes, but only thus. Although her Titan parents and my one met the same fate.\"\n Demeter: \n\"Why, Foster-Brother Zeus! Such an unlikely bit of candor there, from you! Almost as though you felt compelled to speak the truth only whilst I'm directly within earshot.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Demeter: \n\"Well now, young sprout, you met the so-called King of the Olympians and I. Whom do you now suppose is genuinely the ruler of this snow encrusted mountaintop of ours?\"\n Zeus : \n\"Oh, hahaha, Lady Demeter, your wit is just as dry as the earth flying quite fallow in your care, perhaps you should go tend to that again though unless we go ahead and help our young man first.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\n Dionysus: \n\"Hey Zag, my Dad, he's here and wants to have a word, be cool man, go along with what he says, OK?\"\n Zeus : \n\"That Dionysus, always much too kind with introductions, though at least he shows me suitable respect. Perhaps someday he can instruct you in the customs of Olympus here.\"\nGifts.\n&lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Lord Zeus, erm, Uncle, please, accept this offering, and all my gratitude.\"\n Zeus : \n\"Goodness, Nephew, that's an offering, indeed! I'm thankful for your piety to me, and as a show of generosity to you, in turn, I present this!\"\n\"Zeus gives &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Keepsakes\"&gt;Thunder Signet&lt;/a&gt;\"\n Zagreus: \n\"My thanks, Lord Uncle Zeus.\"\n2nd Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"I thank you, my Lord Uncle Zeus, for your benevolence and your thunderous might.\"\n Zeus : \n\"You honor me, young man, as well you should, for I am ruler of Olympus, am I not? Such courtesies are shown me constantly, yet I appreciate them all.\"\n3rd Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Lord Zeus, I bid you please accept my humble offering, for all you've done for me.\"\n Zeus : \n\"Why that is rather generous of you, and I am grateful for it, Nephew! How good of you to make attempts at reciprocity!\"\n4th Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"This offering is but a trifle, Uncle Zeus, for all your magnanimity.\"\n Zeus : \n\"So fine a gift again, my dear Nephew? Would that my sons and daughters on Olympus here would show me such respect from time to time!\"\n5th Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Please, Lord Zeus, accept this gift of Nectar in your honor, though it is such a pittance in comparison to all the generosity you've shown.\"\n Zeus : \n\"I'm very pleased to see a show of such respect and admiration for your uncle, Zagreus. You'll go quite far here on Olympus with an attitude like that! Not everyone's as mannered, nor as wise.\"\n6th Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"If you can hear me, mighty Uncle Zeus, I wish to make to you this simple gift, and with it send my humble wish that someday you and Father settle all your differences, and be at peace.\"\n Zeus : \n\"Ah\", most splendid of an offering, young man. And while we've yet to even meet in person, I already feel as though the two of us are close, why, closer than you must be even with your father! \"Oh, hahaha\"! Perhaps we ought go telling everybody \"I'm\" your real father, am I right?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt;.\n Zagreus: \n\"King of the Olympians, Lord Zeus! Forgive this offer of Ambrosia, for I know you have no limit of it there. But here, it is the finest gift that can be given, and even still it isn't anything compared to all you've done for me. Thank you, Uncle.\"\n Zeus : \n\"Now, now, Nephew, you are most generous, indeed, in showing all this deference to me. But we must keep some distance, shouldn't we? Lest all the others here, why, they would be most jealous if they caught me play favorites! Even though you \"are\" my favorite! Presently, at last.\"\nAbout Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;.\n Zeus : \n\"Has lovely Aphrodite put you in a trance already, Zagreus, or might I offer you the blessing of Olympus to intensify her catastrophic power with my own?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;.\n Zeus : \n\"Getting along with Ares, are you, Nephew? Would that you were my son instead of he, but no, I jest, I jest, here, take my blessing, please!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;.\n Zeus : \n\"So my elusive Artemis has shown you favor, has she? The little scamp, she seldom shows respect to anyone, not even me! But I'll enhance her blessing nonetheless.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;.\n Zeus : \n\"My brave daughter Athena beat me to you this time, has she? No matter, with her blessing and my own, you shall be nigh unstoppable!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Zeus : \n\"I gather Lady Demeter's already got her frigid hold on you, certainly not the warmest member of the clan, now, is she? But do be patient with her, she's been through a lot.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus : \n\"My good sister Demeter already tried to poison you against me, as I understand, young man? Oh, \"foster\"-sister she prefers I say, loath as she is to accept her role as part of our great family.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Zeus : \n\"It pleases me to know, young man, that you and Dionysus have been getting on so well. He could use a level-headed friend, and you could use my blessing!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Zeus : \n\"Your father must have told you that his governance over the Underworld is due more to the weaving of the Fates than by his choice. Admittedly, he got the short end of the stick. Whereas Poseidon and myself, why, we've been doing rather well indeed.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus : \n\"My brothers Hades and Poseidon once fought bravely by my side, you know that, don't you, Nephew? We prevailed against the Titans and established law upon the earth. Your father then descended to the land of death, and we've not seen much of each other since.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;.\n Zeus : \n\"So you are son to Hades by that Nyx, the night goddess, is that correct, Nephew...? Well I suppose she's the closest to a queen as your lord father's like to find down there. I tried to match him up with some more wholesome types, but no, and here we are.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;.\n Zeus : \n\"Poseidon sought you out already, hm? My boastful brother gets on with Lord Hades even worse than I, so let me put a little spark into his storms for you!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt;.\n Zeus : \n\"Your dear mother Persephone is a shrewd woman, Zagreus. More than an equal to your mighty father! I'm pleased to know you've made amends with her, and taken new responsibilities within your House! Naturally, I'll continue to pitch in. And, I hope that we'll meet again, someday!\"\nBeing Invited to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt; (Pre-Epilogue).\n Zagreus: \n\"Sure hope this works... In the name of Hades! Olympus, this is an official message! For you, in all your splendor, Lord Uncle Zeus.\"\n Zeus : \n\"My, what is this you have for me, young man? Appears to be a message of some sort, bearing my thunder sigil! Though, there's one for everybody on Olympus? Have they as yet receive their own? I must know what it says... it's from your father, who else could it be? I'd better check on this!\"\nEpilogue.\n Zeus : \n\"I say, Big Brother! You and your better half put on a positively smashing night! It's a relief, for all of us, knowing Persephone is safe and sound. And mother to as noble of a son as my good nephew, there!\"\n Hades : \n\"Well, Little Brother. The Queen and I, in turn, appreciate you all taking time out of your doubtless-busy lives, to come all this distance to my House.\"\n\"I'm certain it is very modest in comparison to Mount Olympus, but... I trust you were suitably entertained.\"\n Zeus : \n\"Oh, haha, of course, of course, Hades! Now, then, farewell! And let us keep in better touch, from here!\"\n Hades : \n\"Hrm. Farewell, indeed, Lord Zeus.\"\nPost-Epilogue.\n Zeus : \n\"I have to tell you, Zagreus, that it was wonderful to meet with you, at last! We were so pleased to learn Persephone was safe! And Nyx, why, she's as stunning as they say. Shouldn't have lied to us about your parentage, but, I know things get complicated, here, and that what's done is done!\""}

Chronos seized an awful opportunity to strike. Imagine our shock when you sprang from the shadows into our lives!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus : \n\"When we realized Chronos struck your father's House, we feared you were lost with all the rest. How fortunate the Witch of the Crossroads was able to whisk you away! Though she ought have reached out sooner with such news...\"\nDialogue 03.\n Zeus : \n\"We'd grown so accustomed to having little contact with your father down in the Underworld that Chronos was able to gain a foothold there before we knew it.

Now perhaps you'll get to do the honors for me, \"hm? \"I have the family to look after, and must oversee our plans as they unfold.\"\nDialogue 05.\n Zeus : \n\"The Fates themselves knew Chronos would be overthrown by his own kin. We've done it before, and we're going to do it again! Your assistance in the matter is appreciated.\"\nDialogue 06.\n Zeus : \n\"Chronos has quite the relentless fleet there in the Rift of Thessaly!

Now certainly is not the time for selfishness!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Polyphemus\"&gt;Polyphemus&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Zeus : \n\"That worthless Cyclops Polyphemus, turning his broad back against the gods! His kind once aided us against the Titans; yet he's of a newer generation, lacking loyalty, apparently! His actions cannot be excused.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus : \n\"Would that Poseidon didn't make sport of ridiculing Cyclopes, perhaps old sightless Polyphemus would be standing with us rather than against! \"Ah\", but we all make mistakes, don't we?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;.\n Zeus : \n\"Where is that flighty Artemis in this?

Well, I'll be blunt: You're going to need more help than \"that\", so here.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Zeus : \n\"The brightness of my fair son Apollo has illuminated you in the dark, if but for a moment, there, young lady! Would that all of my kin were equally as talented as he!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus : \n\"Shining Apollo has availed himself to you again, has he? Excels at just about anything he sets his mind and body to, that one! Though even he's been having a bit of trouble what with everything of late!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hestia\"&gt;Hestia&lt;/a&gt;.\n Zeus : \n\"You've no idea what a feat it is having old Hestia invested in your task! She can be very disagreeable, and loath to participate in any shared activity of ours.

Already blessed you, sure enough. She's like the enduring winter, that one! But meeting her granddaughter thus has reminded her of fairer seasons, I think.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;.\n Zeus : \n\"You got here rather quickly, quite unlike that rascal Hermes, I should say. Lately he's never about when needed!

Almost as if fairest Selene herself anointed you. Alas, that she must ride across the night, while you're left to your own devices on the ground.\"\nWith Other Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Zeus : \n\"You witches like to use your feminine wiles to get your way? Well \"now \"is the time to use every means at our disposal! Why, even Aphrodite has taken up the cause, not to mention the spear!\"\n Aphrodite : \n\"Oh I'm no novice with the spear, Lord Zeus. For there \"are \"those against whom not even my \"feminine wiles \"prove as effective as a sharp and pointy bit of metal tends to be. I think our Underworld kin can probably relate!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Aphrodite : \n\"Love binds us all together, and inspires us to feats we never could accomplish on our own! And don't just take \"my \"word for it, gorgeous. Your \"wise \"and \"even-handed \"uncle... he knows all about spreading the love around!\"\n Zeus : \n\"You're most correct, dear Aphrodite, for my rule is based on love of family and of mortalkind as well. What are we fighting for, if not a way of life in which our passions are the driving force?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Zeus : \n\"Niece, I expect from you only the best behavior, manners, and performance in the presence of my dear beloved wife, without whom I would be the merest shadow of my greatness.\"\n Hera : \n\"The truest words you've spoken in quite some time, Husband! And I'm more than just your \"dear beloved \"wife, aren't I? Seeing as I am the blasted Queen. Not that \"your \"authority or mine has been worth much of anything of late.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus : \n\"My command of the heavens is nothing compared to the strength of our family bond! The Queen and I have stood together through worse times than \"this. \"Haven't we, Dear?\"\n Hera : \n\"\"Oh \"why, we've stood together now through more hard times than I can count! I daresay we're well past due for a break. Perhaps after our present difficulties finally subside?\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hera : \n\"\"Ah! \"Look, my dear! It's my beloved husband. The distinguished \"King of the Olympians\", who shall lead us all out of this mess. How goes it, Son of Chronos, any news?\"\n Zeus : \n\"Oh, \"hahaha! \"Come now, Hera dear, for all your jesting with me, it can send the wrong impression to one unaccustomed to your dry and clever wit! You see that, Melino\u00eb? Humor is the bond that makes a marriage strong!\"\nDialogue 04.\n Hera : \n\"Our family's unity does not come cheap. We all must work together to ensure the bonds connecting us don't fray, or split entirely as was the case with Chronos. My Lord Husband knows this better than anyone, don't you, Zeus?\"\n Zeus : \n\"You're quite right, Dear, that marriage can most certainly begin to feel like work! It was so easy for us in the early days, but our responsibilities have grown since, haven't they?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Zeus : \n\"Melino\u00eb, one tidbit you ought to know about our side of the family is, while we may not agree on each detail, in the end, we always find ourselves on the same side of every challenge that we face. Isn't that right, Brother?\"\n Poseidon : \n\"Oh, absolutely, Lord Zeus! When you get down to it, our clan is of a single will! Although I guess, you \u2014 \"w-w-we \"don't count Chronos in that estimation, do we, now? He's technically family, but very much opposed to everything we stand for!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus : \n\"We are as one big family upon Olympus, and we pride and celebrate our differences. So many varying perspectives to account for at all times! Although Poseidon here, we always manage to see eye-to-eye, don't we...\"\n Poseidon : \n\"Oh that we \"do\", most certainly, Brother! Not always right away, and there are some occasions when I might decide elsewise if it were solely up to me, but even \"still! \"You always have your head up in the clouds, where smart ideas form!\"\nDialogue 03.\n Poseidon : \n\"Our combined might was once \"more \"than enough to vanquish Chronos, little Niece!

A good plan needn't be discussed out in the open. For now, young Melino\u00eb? We offer you that combined might of ours! Please complicate things for our foes, would you?\"\nDialogue 04.\n Poseidon : \n\"The only greater strength than that belonging to Lord Zeus, my niece, is his combined with mine! Lightning can surge across my waters even faster than it ravages the land! And now, my kingly brother and I grant our terrifying might to you!\"\n Zeus : \n\"We \"lend \"our terrifying might to you, that is, Melino\u00eb.

I'm here now with none other than the bringer of thunder and lightning, magnanimous King of Olympus, your great Lord Uncle and my illustrious father, Zeus!\"\n Zeus : \n\"Oh, \"haha\", my niece and I are well past such a level of formality, my son! Though while we have the pleasure of her company, what say we show her how we put the \"light \"into \"lightning?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus : \n\"Melino\u00eb, my bright son Apollo, you'd be wise to learn a thing or two from \"him! \"Why he is just about the best at everything. Envy of Olympus, here to greet you, and to teach you, \"here he is!\"\n Apollo : \n\"I'm grateful for the flattery, Father. Though, your fair niece is more than capable of fending for herself. Still, an extra bit of insurance from the heavens couldn't hurt, right?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Zeus : \n\"Our upstart enemies shall scatter to the Four Winds once we're through with them! Our challenge is to purge them whilst minimizing unspeakable devastation. And Lady Demeter could always make the Earth re-grow.\"\n Demeter : \n\"Well, Lord Zeus... it is much harder to re-grow where not a trace of life remains. But that's of little consequence right now. Let all who oppose us \"wither! \"And we shall salt the Earth beneath their feet.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Demeter : \n\"When my sisters and my foster-brothers and I overthrew Chronos long ago, we were much closer to \"your \"age, flower. Now we are older, and one should think wiser... although our frequent bickering and inaction suggest otherwise.\"\n Zeus : \n\"We are a strong-willed family, as you know perfectly well, Lady Demeter. We must move forward in unison! Building that sort of consensus is not always quick; though we each could do our part to hasten it along.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hephaestus\"&gt;Hephaestus&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Zeus : \n\"If there's one good thing about this war, it's that even our most reserved family members have to rise up and make themselves known! Or just make themselves known in the case of my good son Hephaestus here, \"haha!\"\n Hephaestus : \n\"\"Ah! \"Another one of your fine jests there, Dad, and right in witchie's earshot too! Just when I thought he couldn't possibly stoop to my level, he continues to surprise.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Always grand whenever our Lord Zeus decides to drop by unannounced, and watch over my shoulder whilst I work my forge! Even likes to point where my hammer ought to strike. Well, Dad, where to next?\"\n Zeus : \n\"Need I remind you, my good son, that this is not, in fact, \"your \"forge, but a facility that all of us may use? And I would use it now to benefit your distant cousin over there! \"Erm\", show me how to use this thing again...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hestia\"&gt;Hestia&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Zeus : \n\"We're so accustomed to my sister-in-law Hestia being off on her own, why, we even stopped saving a seat in my palace! But she's here to stay this time, aren't you, Hess?\"\n Hestia : \n\"\"Oh\", why, dearest Zeus, perish the thought that I would ever leave again! You've given me such a warm welcome after all, having removed my blasted seat only to put it back. Though, let's not worry hot stuff here with all of that!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hestia : \n\"In olden days I never took strapping young Zeus here for the marrying type, and was none too pleased when he picked my poor sister Hera for the job! But you've been a right good husband to her, haven't you, Zeus?\"\n Zeus : \n\"...I sometimes pity you, Hestia, for never having known the joys of matrimony for yourself. Challenges arise in any such relationship, but together with your beloved partner, you find a way! All you must do is compromise and cooperate.\"\nAbouth the Scenery.\n&lt;a href=\"Erebus\"&gt;Erebus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Zeus : \n\"You must reside somewhere in those terrible woods at the edge of your father's domain. So then you know the sensation of rainfall, the sound of distant thunder. That power now is yours.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Oceanus\"&gt;Oceanus&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Zeus : \n\"Now, where exactly are you, young lady? The outskirts of Poseidon's realm, it seems. You mean to circumnavigate your father's domain! Why confront the armies of Chronos head on, when you could go around. A clever move!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus : \n\"How unseemly that you need to trudge across the border in between my brothers' realms! Though if it's any consolation, those aquatic monstrosities you face are in for a real shock!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Tartarus/Hades%20II\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Zeus : \n\"The deepest reaches of the Underworld have surely changed a lot; dismal in all-new ways! To think that Chronos made his stronghold down in Tartarus, where once we buried him...\"\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Zeus : \n\"Something is different with you, Niece. You seem so very much alive... upon the surface here, no less! You cured your curse somehow? Impossible...\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus : \n\"I don't know how you circumvented the curse that bound you to the Underworld, young lady; but I \"do \"know this changes everything! You can help us defend this mountaintop! Help we could use, even \"I \"must admit...\"\nDialogue 03.\n Zeus : \n\"Observe the handiwork of Chronos all about you, there! The once-thriving city of Ephyra, laid to ruin; the Underworld's gates, flung open! Unconscionable acts, for which there must be dire consequences!\"\nDialogue 04.\n Zeus : \n\"It's all mixed up here on the surface, young lady. The very ground beneath your feet shifts constantly, due either to Poseidon's quakes, or to whatever Chronos has devised. You know which way to go, if not the precise path.\"\nDialogue 05.\n Zeus : \n\"We have the matter on Olympus well in hand, young lady! I'd rather you stay focused on our common foe within your father's realm. Though you shall have my blessing either way!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Thessaly\"&gt;Rift of Thessaly&lt;/a&gt;.\n Zeus : \n\"Chronos has quite the relentless fleet there in the Rift of Thessaly! Ships packed with bodies and supplies. Very clever of you, stowing away to disrupt the enemy lines!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Mount Olympus&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Zeus : \n\"Once all of this is settled, you come join us on Olympus here, won't you? No need to toil on within that witch's glade. Though, I suppose you may be needed in your father's House. At any rate, know that the invitation stands!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus : \n\"You've seen it now firsthand: Our great mountain is perpetually besieged, and we've not had a moment's peace of late. Yet this trial only makes us stronger as a family!\"\nMiscellaneous Conversations.\nOffering Boon at The Start of a Run (Any).\nDialogue 01.\n Zeus : \n\"Greetings, my fair niece! I expected I might find you setting forth here on another of your escapades! And I would have this be a most successful one, for you and all of us!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus : \n\"\"Ah\", your journey begins anew again, young lady! Though, let's see how it goes for you when you have my incomparable blessing from the start!\"\nDialogue 03.\n Zeus : \n\"As you set forth again this evening, let me guarantee that you start off on the right foot. Know that all of us are behind you, every step of the way!\"\nDialogue 04.\n Zeus : \n\"You're just getting started for this evening, aren't you, young lady? Well let me usher you along. Harness the thunder, and ensure our victory!\"\nOffering Boon at The Start of a Run (&lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt;).\nDialogue 01.\n Zeus : \n\"You must be somewhere near a gateway to your father's realm. So you're headed \"here \"again, rather than toward his House? Well be that as it may, my aid is yours.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus : \n\"You've a long way to go before you reach Olympus, Niece; and there's been some inclement weather. But you don't mind a little thunder and lightning now, do you?\"\nBuying Boon at &lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;'s Shop.\nDialogue 01.\n Zeus : \n\"I trust this message finds you well! We must remain in close communication as best we can, even if it means employing the services of your Underworld's Boatman every so often.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus : \n\"Old Charon must have ample time to spare, now that he isn't busy sending souls to their eternal rest. Although I do suspect that we can keep him plenty busy in service to us here!\"\nDialogue 03.\n Zeus : \n\"How vain of Chronos to have pressed all of those golden coins in his own image! The promise of a new \"Golden Age\", some mortals say, \"pah! \"That age has long since passed. And no amount of shiny metal shall bring it back.\"\nDialogue 04.\n Zeus : \n\"\"Ah, haha! \"To think my blessing could be had for a mere bit of coin. Know that the Boatman brokered this particular exchange only for \"you! \"Our services have never been for sale.\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Olympians\"&gt;Olympians&lt;/a&gt;.\n Zeus : \n\"You've met most members of the clan by now, but unfortunately, several are away. I'm certain they'll have the most fascinating explanations for their absences during such a circumstance.\"\nAbout Mortals.\nDialogue 01.\n Zeus : \n\"The mortals, they don't shower us with offerings at quite the rate at which they used to, young lady. How brazen they've become, seeing Chronos as some sort of savior, I suppose. \"Pah!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus : \n\"Some mortals are such fools to be enticed by the promise of a new Golden Age. \"When Chronos ruled, it was a time of peace\", they claim! \"No war or strife! \"And no advancement or society, either. The path of progress isn't paved!\"\nAbout Weapons.\n Zeus : \n\"That silver sickle that you wield. It seems not only are the Arms of Night awakened, they are in your grasp. I once fought Titans with their counterparts. Now it seems that history repeats.\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Gods\"&gt;Trial of the Gods&lt;/a&gt;.\n Zeus : \n\"I regret you've been swept up in some of our little disagreements here, young lady. We all wish to bestow our favor, and should not be fighting over who gets to go first! Yet our pride is not so delicate as it may seem, and we always stand together in the end!\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt; Penalty.\nDialogue 01.\n Zeus : \n\"\"Augh\", what are you doing on the \"surface\", young lady? How will you survive? Surely you know your line is bound beneath the earth. Your strength is better spent against our foes down \"there!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus : \n\"Your treks up here seem ill-advised, Melino\u00eb. I trust you have some sort of plan, don't you? You and that Witch of the Crossroads can be quite difficult to read!\"\nAbout Route Choice.\n Zeus : \n\"There is some difference of opinion here regarding where your efforts are of greatest benefit. We shall keep the matter on Olympus well in hand, but we cannot get to Chronos in your father's realm as easily as you!\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; Clearing A Run (&lt;a href=\"The%20Underworld\"&gt;The Underworld&lt;/a&gt;).\nDialogue 01.\n Zeus : \n\"It's been a while, young lady! Word reached me that you've made significant advances as of late, and furthered our great cause. So I commend you, and of course, I give my blessing to you, too!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus : \n\"How exactly you shall vanquish Chronos, someone shall have to explain to me at some point! Your witching-ways shall help you to prevail where we could not, \"hm? \"At least he hasn't yet imprisoned you along with your kin!\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; Clearing A Run (&lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt;).\n Zeus : \n\"What happened to you on your journey to our mountaintop, my niece? We lost contact with you somewhere on your way, just when it seemed you were so close. Well, don't despair, and don't relent, either!\"\nPost-Gift Lines.\nDialogue 01.\n Zeus : \n\"I must admit, Melino\u00eb... your commitment to this task of yours is greater than I had surmised. My offspring can be easily discouraged. I'm pleased to see my older brother's offspring isn't thus.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus : \n\"A pity that you're unattached, or so I hear. Your ceaseless training, living in a hidden grove... no \"wonder \"that there's no one special in your life! Fear not, though, you'll be fending off suitors left and right once word of you gets out!\"\nAbout Legendary Boon.\nDialogue 01.\n Zeus : \n\"Enough with the \"little \"jolts, I say, my niece! I'm in a giving mood, so all my thunderous might is yours to do with as you please! Well, not quite \"all \"of it, but more than enough, I'm sure!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus : \n\"I grow weary of this interminable stalemate! Take now my strength, young lady, and crash through the enemy ranks like a bolt in the night!\"\nAbout The &lt;a href=\"Oath%20of%20the%20Unseen\"&gt;Oath of the Unseen&lt;/a&gt;.\n Zeus : \n\"Such a dreadful night this is, the likes of which I haven't felt in quite some time! But you and that Witch of the Crossroads, you must revel in the stifling fear and darkness, don't you? Go then and terrify our foes!\"\nAbout The &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Trials\"&gt;Chaos Trials&lt;/a&gt;.\n Zeus : \n\"I can always sense when something is amiss, and on this night, strange forces are at work. Perhaps it was the Fates themselves ensuring you would find me thus!\"\nGifts.\n&lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"To mighty Uncle Zeus, vanquisher of Titans! Your strength has saved our family before. You are most kind to now share some of it with me.\"\n Zeus : \n\"This hardly seems the time to make me offerings. All the more reason I appreciate the gesture, Niece! And per the custom of our family, I've prepared something for you, in turn!\"\n\"Zeus gives &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Bangle\"&gt;Cloud Bangle&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You are most generous, Lord Uncle.\"\n2nd Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Lord Zeus, king of Olympus, I am honored to be in your service! I vow to use your thunderous power for the greater good of our family.\"\n Zeus : \n\"Even in such a time, you pay proper respects to your lord uncle, my well-mannered niece. Know, in turn, you have my gratitude!\"\n3rd Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Benevolent Lord Uncle Zeus, I have for you another offering, as meager as it is! May you soon have occasion to enjoy it peaceably.\"\n Zeus : \n\"I'm often showered in such offerings, you know. However, coming from one such as you, it means a lot more to me than the rest. My other children stand to learn from you!\"\n4th Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Lord Uncle, a token of my appreciation! Though I knew of your generous spirit well before we finally met, I'd not expected you'd make time for me again and again like this.\"\n Zeus : \n\"Your brother once was similarly generous to me! I often wondered who could have taught him such deference. Old Hades didn't, that I knew!\""}

However, it's evident that Poseidon harbors a degree of intimidation towards Zeus, as seen in their Duo Boon exchanges. While boasting about his own prowess compared to Zeus and how he may excel in various domains, Zeus promptly admonishes Poseidon to tone it down and to be mindful of his words in front of Zagreus, suggesting his brother lacks tact. In response, Poseidon quickly shifts to flattery, acknowledging Zeus as \"the epitome of elegance, power, and divinity,\" highlighting Zeus's dominance over him. \nHe ironically remarks that his arrogant brother gets along with Hades even worse than he does.\nDemeter.\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;: Zeus's foster sister.&lt;br&gt;Demeter considers Zeus an adopted brother, but blames him for mortals confusing their real relationship with a true brother-sister bond. Zeus is the Olympian who seems to fear her the least and often acts cynically, commenting on every case as if it were pitiful, showing off false condolences for Persephone's disappearance without any remorse or shame, even though he knows he is the main culprit.\nHestia.\n&lt;a href=\"Hestia\"&gt;Hestia&lt;/a&gt;: Zeus's foster sister.&lt;br&gt;\nAthena.\n&lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;: Zeus's daughter.&lt;br&gt;Zeus loves his beloved daughter and counselor, Athena, and is particularly proud of your offspring. He values her greatly, especially because she always comes to his rescue when his own impulsive recklessness leads to unforeseen problems.\nHe often openly refers to her as the perfect daughter. While he loves all of his children in his own way, he is not subtle about expressing his favoritism for her, spreading comments and showcasing her achievements throughout all of Mount Olympus, making it clear that Athena holds a special place among his children. \nAthena proves to be a reliable, proactive, and with all her cunning, she knows how to win over Zeus. She generously reciprocates and respects her father, the supreme ruler of Olympus, offering generous praise in her presentations to him. Although his daughter, who is much more mature than he, has to intervene, and Zeus also wasn't pleased to learn that he wasn't the first to be contacted by her, their strengths often align, complementing each other with an overwhelming combined strength of father and daughter.\nAres.\n&lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;: Zeus's son.&lt;br&gt;Zeus isn't very good at hiding his disappointment with his son, the \"often misunderstood\" Ares. He even tells Zagreus that he would prefer him as a son instead of Ares. Although Ares maintains a respectful tone with his father, it's strongly implied that he's not Zeus's favorite due to his disapproval of Ares' violent and impulsive nature.\nZeus doesn't seem to be a fan of Ares; in Zeus's eyes, Ares comes off as arrogant and still has much to learn. However, even though it doesn't seem like that, Zeus loves all his children in his own way, including Ares. Zeus can't comprehend Ares's strange admiration for his undesirable neighbors, the chthonic gods.\nDespite it all, Zeus keeps a spark of trust alive in his son. He sees potential in Ares, even if it means going against the opinions of his daughters, who believe that Ares is a bad influence on Zagreus. Zeus hopes that Ares can be useful in some way and approves of their companionship, hoping that Zagreus can be a positive influence on Ares.\nArtemis.\n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;: Zeus's daughter.&lt;br&gt;Artemis's disposition aligns more with her uncle Hades than with her own father himself. For Zeus his daughter is out of reach. Even with his watershed opinions, they are not very far from a father-daughter relationship. \nFor him, she doesn't treat others with due respect, including him. However, realizes that she is not the social butterfly seen among the gods. He occasionally feels disheartened by her deviation from his expectations, perplexed by her preference for the wilderness, and has difficulty understanding why his daughter hasn't found a consort and prefers to spend her time in the forest, hunting or whatever else she may be doing.\nDespite his occasional discussions. Zeus acknowledges that Artemis possesses a keen understanding of how to achieve her goals and a shrewd awareness of her vulnerabilities. Artemis cites the tumultuous romantic stories of the gods as the reason for her singleness, causing Zeus to step back, struck by his daughter's words that are like swords, and admit that she might actually have a valid argument.\nApollo.\n&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;: Zeus's son.&lt;br&gt;Their relationship is currently unknown. But they are likely to have a good father-son bond.\nHephaestus.\n&lt;a href=\"Hephaestus\"&gt;Hephaestus&lt;/a&gt;: Zeus's son.&lt;br&gt;Their relationship is currently unknown.&lt;br&gt;\nHermes.\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;: Zeus's son.&lt;br&gt;Zeus fully trusts Hermes, considering him of great utility. Hermes frequently carries out tasks at Zeus's request, such as delivering messages and fulfilling various missions on behalf of the great god of olympus, keeping Zeus well-informed.\nZeus seemingly exerts pressure and intimidates his talkative son to keep secret what he heard about Persephone beneath the surface, under the threat of unfavorable consequences.\nZeus confesses to Hermes's tendency to evade him, recalling that he hasn't seen him lately. He supposes that the scamp is probably out having fun, unaware that, in reality, he is aiding Zagreus. This demonstrates that, even as his father, Zeus can be deceived by him.\"\nDionysus.\n&lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;: Zeus's son.&lt;br&gt;Zeus adores Dionysius and indulges him. While Zeus acknowledges that his son Dionysus rarely takes things seriously, he approves of Zagreus spending time with him as he believes his eloquent son needs a sensible friend for a change. It is implied that Dionysus was once a demigod, and Zeus liked him so much that he elevated him to a full god and invited him to live on Mount Olympus with him.\nZeus can appreciate Dionysus's sociable, laid-back, and festive nature. However, he might not entirely agree with Dionysus attending family gatherings while always being drunk. Nevertheless, Zeus recognizes that Dionysus is very kind in his interactions and always shows him the proper respect.\nIn the second game, Zeus remarks that his loving and peaceful son Dionysus wants nothing to do with the current situation. He expresses disbelief at Dionysus' courage to believe that wine is the solution to all life's problems and predicts that soon he won't have to drink as such.\nAphrodite.\n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;: The Goddess of Love and Beauty.&lt;br&gt;She has a lot of disdain for Zeus, tolerating him superficially and scraping together formalities just because they are substantial. Aprodite addresses Zeus in a fawning and respectful manner, informing him that he need not meddle in her affairs, which are under her control. With him hurling a crass comment that the only things Aphrodite has under control are her long list of uninformed suitors.\nChthonic Gods.\nThe Gods of the Underworld.\nHades.\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;: Zeus's older brother.&lt;br&gt;Zeus has a complex relationship with his eldest brother. While they united against the Titans, they rarely spoke afterward, with Hades isolating himself in the Underworld. Although Hades had an interest in the daughter of the goddess Demeter, he never asked for his brother's help in getting her attention, let alone kidnapping her, and he certainly didn't see her as a \"gift\" that could be given as an object. Zagreus will say that Hades is furious with him, Zeus says that he and Hades had a fight, which he wants to fix, and that the next time Zagreus sees Hades, tells him that he forgives him, this forgiveness only serves to drive him crazy, because their disagreement was entirely Zeus's fault.\nDespite his tendency not to take his brother's words seriously and to occasionally provoke him, Zeus made a misguided attempt to reconcile with his big brother. Sensing Hades' loneliness in the Underworld and his affection for Persephone, Zeus orchestrated her abduction and delivered her to he. However, this radical action only served to further complicate matters for his brother, despite Zeus' intentions.\nZagreus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;: Zeus's nephew.&lt;br&gt;Initially helping Zagreus as a way to get revenge on his brother, he quickly becomes attached to Zagreus and helps him reciprocally. He also literally tells Zagreus that he wanted all of his children to be like him. Eventually, Zeus uses him as his messenger boy, attempting to mend his relationship with Hades.\nIn the second game, he comments that unfortunately Melino\u00eb never met his brother, who was very angry and determined, and that they didn't always get along with their father, but who does? He is certain that she fought with the same bravery as him.\nMelino\u00eb.\n&lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;: Zeus's niece.&lt;br&gt;He will offer his blessing to help her defeat Chronos. In Melino\u00eb's first encounter with Zeus, he expresses his eager desire to finally meet her, he refers to her as 'young lady'. Zeus praises Melino\u00eb, commending her for emerging from the darkness to help them settle old scores that are not her responsibility. He praises her for inheriting her father's strength, indicating that they now have an advantage and will attack with full force.\nUnlike some of the gods who may not believe in her strength, Zeus genuinely believes in Melino\u00eb. This belief may result from his own experience as the youngest child of a prophecy, who also remained hidden all his life, training until he was ready to emerge and defeat his progenitor. He then at least sees Melino\u00eb as similar to himself in this aspect and trusts in her abilities, believing that lightning can indeed strike twice in the same place.\nPersephone.\n&lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt;: Zeus's foster niece.&lt;br&gt;He's the only one who knows why she disappeared because he was the one who kidnapped her in the first place and has no intention of letting Demeter or the other Olympians find out. He even goes along with Persephone's lie that she ran away with Hades just to keep that secret. Persephone admits to Zagreus, that when Zeus took her to the Underworld, she would have gone willingly, although she admits she probably did not have a choice in the matter regardless.\nNyx.\n&lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;: Night Incarnate.&lt;br&gt;Zeus initially believed that Nyx was the closest thing Hades had to a Queen; a misconception that would be resolved following the first game's epilogue.\nThe Titans.\nThe previous rulers of the world, defeated in the Titan War and imprisoned in the pits of &lt;a href=\"Tartarus\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt;.\nChronos.\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;: Zeus's father.&lt;br&gt;Zeus fought and overthrew Chronos and the other Titans. By the time of &lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;, Chronos has launched a war against Olympus."}

{"id": "307", "revid": "44872912", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=307", "title": "Achilles", "text": "Achilles is a demi-god hero famed for his role in the as both a peerless warrior and as the leader of his tribe, the Myrmidons. He was dipped in the &lt;a href=\"Styx\"&gt;Styx&lt;/a&gt; by his mother as a child to grant him immortality but was left vulnerable on the heel by which Thetis held him.\nAfter he was fatally wounded when Paris shot his heel with an arrow, he descended to the Underworld as a &lt;a href=\"Shade\"&gt;Shade&lt;/a&gt;, where he was eventually hired by &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; to train a young &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; in battle and military discipline in exchange for allowing his lover &lt;a href=\"Patroclus\"&gt;Patroclus&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Elysium\"&gt;Elysium&lt;/a&gt;. Since he was hired, Achilles has made an effort to be a source of support and encouragement for Zagreus in the face of Hades' often harsh treatment.\nAchilles is responsible for authoring all entries in the &lt;a href=\"Codex\"&gt;Codex&lt;/a&gt;, which he gives to Zagreus to provide information and guidance about the Underworld and the Olympian Gods, as well as the many foes, fish, and items he may come across.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nA formidable demigod known for his role in the Trojan War. Achilles serves as a source of support and encouragement for &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;.\nA modest hero, despite being a renowned Greek hero, Achilles is very humble and self-deprecating. He sees no reason to regale people with stories of his past. Unlike, for example, &lt;a href=\"Theseus\"&gt;Theseus&lt;/a&gt;, he does not boast about the deeds that earned him fame. He seems content to guard the west wing of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt; and teach Zagreus.\nAs Hades is so distant, Achilles acts as emotional support for Zagreus, and becomes the \"older male role model\" for Zagreus. Achilles is cool, caring, a wise and noble mentor, and one of the few genuinely heroic heroes. Achilles is in charge and provides information and guidance about the Underworld and the &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;gods of Olympus&lt;/a&gt;. It is implied that in the past, Achilles was someone very different from who we know now, and he is ashamed of who he used to be, not interested in dwelling on the past. Much calmer in his afterlife, he was famous for his Unstoppable Rage and could be a proud and arrogant warrior, like Theseus, but he grew as a person thanks to his time for reflection in the Underworld.\nThough not immediately apparent, it eventually becomes clear that Achilles is secretly tormented by guilt and self-loathing for the many atrocities he had both witnessed and committed while alive, especially when it came to the war with the Trojans, which also led to his death. Because of this, when questioned about the many battles he participated in, Achilles always refused to go into real detail. After accepting Zagreus as his student, he resolves to do everything in his power to ensure that Zagreus becomes a better man than he was in life. \nAchilles can become comically serious. He hates onions, and the funny part is that he's dead serious about it. He even says that he would rather vanish into nothingness than be forced to eat an onion again.\nAn honorable sacrifice for true love, after his death, Hades approached Achilles with the offer to train a young man, Achilles agreed to become Zagreus' mentor, sacrificing his place in &lt;a href=\"Elysium\"&gt;Elysium&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Patroclus\"&gt;Patroclus&lt;/a&gt; in return.\nPhysical description.\nAchilles is portrayed as a well-built adult male with a height similar to &lt;a href=\"Patroclus\"&gt;Patroclus&lt;/a&gt;. He has curly, light blond hair that is combed to the left side and back, and he wears a braided headband as an adornment. He is often seen wielding his spear. His cloak, known as a chlamys, is green and matches the design of Patroclus', except for the motif on his cloak pin, which displays the symbol of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt;. His silver chest armor extends into a belt adorned with a Greek meander pattern. Underneath his armor, he wears a white tunic, known as a chiton, covered by a green waist wrap that transitions into a long skirt called a himation. His left arm is adorned with a silver bracelet, while his right arm is partially covered by his cloak. Achilles also wears bracers with hand guards, presumably made of metal and leather strips, as well as golden shin guards. He is depicted as being barefooted.\nHistory.\nBefore Hades.\nA demigod hero known for his role in the Trojan War, Achilles is famous for his strength in battle. After his death in battle, his shade descended to the Underworld, where he ended up being hired to train &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;' rebellious son and guard the West Wing of the House.\nHades.\nHaving been Zagreus's mentor, the prince will often confine in Achilles about his escape attempts, regarding the enemies he fought, items and people he discovered and possible difficulties. Although he has nothing new to teach, Achilles keeps encouraging Zagreus to never give up and complete his mission. After a while, the hero will hand over his Codex, which helps Zagreus learn more about those he encounters, as well as the items he finds, all through Achilles's point of view and limited knowledge, however.\nWhen Zagreus met &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt; for the first time, Achilles was the first to know. Unable to help, all Achilles can do is keep on encouraging the prince to reach the truth behind his family's situation. It's partly thanks to his continuous support and encouragement that Zagreus manages to bring his mother back at all.\nEpilogue.\nDuring the feast, Achilles was approached by Artemis, a great fan of his.\nAs Zagreus travels through Elysium, he comes across a warrior that, unlike all others, doesn't wish to fight, but doesn't want him around either. He comes to learn this is Patroclus, Achilles's lover, and sets to reunite the two.\nAt first, Achilles is overjoyed to know Patroclus is in Elysium and well, but saddens upon learning Patroclus believes he abandoned him. The hero eventually explains the whole story to Zagreus: he gave his place in Elysium to Patroclus to ensure him a life of luxury and great respite without the other's consent, and in turn he had to work for Hades at the master's House, unable to vist Elysium, and consequently his lover. Zagreus thus purposes he rewrite Achilles's contract as he has done to other shades' contracts, but Achilles refuses. Only after Patroclus instructs the prince to say to Achilles to \"risk it all\", does Achilles finally asks Zagreus to help solve his predicament.\nWith the contract rewritten, Achilles is now able to go to Elysium and visit Patroclus from time to time. Sometimes, they can be found together when Zagreus is out.\nBefore Hades II.\nLike most residents of the House of Hades, Achilles was trapped in a never-ending moment by &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt; and set aside in his collection when the Titan attacked the House.\nAffinity.\nAfter your third escape attempt, you can talk to him to get the &lt;a href=\"Codex\"&gt;Codex&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf given &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;, Achilles will give you the &lt;a href=\"Myrmidon%20Bracer\"&gt;Myrmidon Bracer&lt;/a&gt;. After giving him 6 Nectar, you will not be able to give him any more gifts until you complete a favor for him. Doing so will allow you to gift him &lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt;, and he will give you the &lt;a href=\"Companion%20Antos\"&gt;Companion Antos&lt;/a&gt; in return for the first bottle.\nAchilles' affinity gauge is maxed out at 9 hearts, requiring the gifting of 6 Nectar and 3 Ambrosia.\nIf affinity is maxed out with Achilles, there will be unique text above his keepsake. this text states: \"from Achilles, you share an unyielding bond\" as well as \"Fated for glory, he shall forever be remembered, and remember you.\" \nFavor.\nPart of the &lt;a href=\"Fated%20List%20of%20Minor%20Prophecies\"&gt;Fated List of Minor Prophecies&lt;/a&gt;, Achilles' favor involves finding a way to reunite him with his lifelong partner &lt;a href=\"Patroclus\"&gt;Patroclus&lt;/a&gt;. As &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; grows closer to them both and learns of their relationship, Patroclus will tell him to pass on a message to Achilles, to \"risk it all\". Upon hearing this, Achilles will reminisce on the last time he heard the phrase. Progressing this favor further requires you to complete the favors of both &lt;a href=\"Sisyphus\"&gt;Sisyphus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orpheus\"&gt;Orpheus&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Eurydice\"&gt;Eurydice&lt;/a&gt;. \nLater, after having he will ask Zagreus to alter his pact with Hades to allow him to enter Elysium and see Patroclus. After Zagreus locates the pact with the help of &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;, it will cost 5 to grant Achilles' wish at the &lt;a href=\"House%20Contractor\"&gt;House Contractor&lt;/a&gt;. He will then leave for Elysium, and Zagreus can find him by Patroclus' side in his resident chamber. \nUpon his return to the House of Hades, his affinity gauge will be unlocked, and he can be gifted Ambrosia. He may also visit Patroclus again in subsequent runs.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\nMerchandise=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Yet, as fate would have it, death would be the force that would tear them apart. Desperate to ensure his beloved's eternal happiness, Achilles made a deal with the god of the underworld, Hades, that would keep Patroclus in Elysium. But upon his own arrival in the afterlife, Achilles discovered that Patroclus was anything but content.

Prior to that patch, &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt; had been known as Ambrosia."}

She offers &lt;a href=\"boons\"&gt;boons&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; that inflict her Weak, or make enemies more susceptible to damage.\nHer signature &lt;a href=\"Status%20Curse\"&gt;Status Curse&lt;/a&gt; is Weak, which reduces the afflicted enemies' damage by 30%. Aphrodite also offers boons which increase the effectiveness of her Status Curse itself, such as Empty Inside (which increases the effect's duration).\nAphrodite is one of five Olympian gods (the other four being &lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;) who will not appear in the very first run of a save.\nAphrodite returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;\" and offers her boons to &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; in her fight against &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;. Her signature Status Curse is still Weak. Her boons have shifted to a much more close-range style.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nAphrodite is playful, seductive, and optimistic. As the Goddess of Love, she can be very sweet and accessible with &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; in Hades II and her &lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;admirers&lt;/a&gt;, and openly flirts with them. However, it's not a good idea to irritate her by insinuating second intentions. She will express her anger against anyone who threatens those she considers important or \"her little god.\"\nDespite being the goddess of love, she can be quite venomous, mischievous, and prone to making lethal comments. Comments from other &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Olympian gods&lt;/a&gt; indicate that Aphrodite has shallow interests. She can be quite hypocritical, and frequently conflicts with other Olympians, especially &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;, who are like water and wine. However, she firmly believes in the power of love and will do everything to ensure that it is given and received in its purest form.\nEven the love expert can make mistakes, and her quickness to perceive passions is not always accurate. Aphrodite is a confidant of love and can be well-intentioned at times, acting as a counselor for broken hearts and assisting pending passions.\nAphrodite uses her status as the goddess of love to her advantage, with her charm and charisma, taking advantage of the benefits this provides, using people's passions and desires at your pleasure, making her a skilled strategist in both love and battle. &lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt; remarks that, among the Olympians, Aphrodite terrifies him the most. Her domain can cause great turbulence with more devastating consequences than a lightning bolt, literally destroying the hearts of her adversaries.\nShe views the eternal feud between the &lt;a href=\"Olympians\"&gt;Olympians&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Titans\"&gt;Titans&lt;/a&gt; as pathetic lamenting that even after centuries of supposed progress they still refuse to put aside their differences and instead choose to continue fighting among themselves like spoiled children. \nAs the goddess of love, Aphrodite still finds herself in conflict primarily with other gods because she dislikes dull and monotonous environments, preferring to shake things up. However, she also possesses a loving and protective nature, which becomes evident in her interactions with Zagreus and later with Melino\u00eb in the second game. In these moments, she comforts Melino\u00eb about her kidnapped family, showing empathy and compassion. Additionally, she feels sorry for &lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt; due to the situation he finds himself in because of the war.\nHer treacherous nature, coupled with her many loves, including her openly flirtatious interactions with everyone from &lt;a href=\"Hephaestus\"&gt;Hephaestus&lt;/a&gt; to Ares and even Zagreus, is well-known. However, she later develops a crush on &lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;, demonstrating that she lacks taming over her own domain.\nPhysical description.\nThe most feminine goddess of Olympus, Aphrodite exudes a confident and seductive aura and is depicted with small vegetables adorning her head. She is depicted unabashedly, as a voluptuous nude goddess with peach-colored eyes and a defined jawline. She is adorned on the sides of her head with decorative vegetation brooches, with jewelry intertwined on her wrists and forearms. Her incredible long silky peach-colored hair covers her breasts and pubic area, with its ends entwining in a heart shape.\nIn Hades II, she now wears a more elegant head jewelry and protective golden arm &amp; leg guards but nonetheless still remains naked. In addition, she wields a spear and shield adorned with hearts and roses, a symbolic flower of hers; however, her most distinct feature is her white warpaint over her eyes which is similar to that of her lover Ares.\nHistory.\nPast.\nAphrodite lived during the Golden Age of &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt; but she found it to be the \"dullest time\" ever. After the &lt;a href=\"Titans\"&gt;Titans&lt;/a&gt; were overthrown by the young &lt;a href=\"Olympians\"&gt;Olympians&lt;/a&gt;, she ended up being part of the new world order of divine beings.\nAs a result of her divine beauty she had many suitor vying for her favor. In an attempt to keep her settled down, Zeus had her married his son &lt;a href=\"Hephaestus\"&gt;Hephaestus&lt;/a&gt;. However, this was not a happy marriage since she was forced to marry, and it was to the one considered the ugliest god of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Olympus&lt;/a&gt;. She thus began having affairs in secret with other gods behind her husband's back, especially with Hephaestus's older brother, &lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe's one of the three goddesses responsible for starting the famous Trojan War, alongside &lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;.\nHades.\nAphrodite won't appear right away to Zagreus, but eventually reaches out. She decides he is worthy of receiving her boons and thus lends him her powers. Her topics of conversations focus mostly on her and how adored she is by others or on the concepts of love. She can come to comment on her husband, and freely speaks her opinion about the others, with no regrets or fears. She'll also be aware of Zagreus's romancing paths and encourages him to pursue them.\nEpilogue.\nShe attends the feast like the rest. Afterwards, she keeps on lending Zagreus her boons.\nHades II.\nAphrodite lends &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; her boons once she becomes aware of her existence like the rest of the Olympians.\nAffinity.\nIf given &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;, Aphrodite will give you the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Rose\"&gt;Eternal Rose&lt;/a&gt;.\nAphrodite's affinity gauge is maxed out at 7 hearts, requiring the gifting of 6 Nectar and 1 &lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf affinity is maxed out with Aphrodite, there will be unique text above her keepsake. this text states: \"From Aphrodite; you share a beautiful bond\" as well as \"Her true affection is reserved for those who find love and beauty on their own.\"\nFavor.\nAphrodite's favor requires Zagreus to illustrate his capacity for love, both platonically and passionately, by forging bonds with &lt;a href=\"Dusa\"&gt;Dusa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt; (you will trigger 1 dialogue with the goddess for each bond you forge with them and a 4th one to actually get the favor).\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

If my perfectly developed senses are correct, then you appear to be quite smitten with a little gorgon that you've met down there...?

I always figured that his brooding quality was just an act!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Aphrodite: \n\"Little godling, would that I knew every last detail of how you and Thanatos are getting on of late!

Aphrodite, how about you bestow your blessing and be off, and I'll take it from here.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus: \n\"Young man, I know you'd like to get to know the comely Aphrodite face to face, or I don't know, you can decide once you arrive at last! He can decide, isn't that right, my Lady Aphrodite, hm?\"\n Aphrodite: \n\"Why, I never, Lord Zeus! That sounded rather like a crass remark, from \"you\"! How shocking that the golden standard for the rest of us should have such words for \"me!\"\"\n&lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Aphrodite: \n\"You must forgive us, little godling, meaning our extended family here upon Olympus! Some of us are terribly stuck up, and must be making matters much more complicated than they have to be.\"\n Athena: \n\"I wonder, dearest Aphrodite, whether you'd be willing to repeat such things directly to my countenance?\"\n Aphrodite: \n\"Oh, you must know full well that I would do much more than that directly to your countenance, Athena dear! Quite frankly, you could use a lot of work!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Aphrodite: \n\"Dearest, you must know, Goddess Athena and myself, we don't always share a common view, perhaps because she overthinks things constantly, while my heart leads me on!\"\n Athena: \n\"I'm glad we understand each other, then. It would be most embarrassing to be caught bickering amongst ourselves in front of Zagreus.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Athena: \n\"Your predicament has pulled our family together, united in a desire to assist you, Cousin. Even those who typically do not think much of those other than themselves.\"\n Aphrodite: \n\"Oh, if only I had wisdom such as yours, Athena dear, so that I was more capable of picking up on subtle jabs and insults such as that! You're not fooling anybody with your feigned benevolence, you know.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Aphrodite: \n\"The thing to know about this family, dearest, is that, each of us, we have our little quirks. Although, we always stick together and our love for one another perseveres!\"\n Poseidon: \n\"Oh, \"hoh\"! What do we have here, little Hades? Seems to me that you have \"company\"! Well, I'll just leave the two of you alone. My lips are sealed tighter than a warship hull!\"\n Aphrodite: \n\"Oh, feel free to stay, Poseidon! I was just explaining what an idiot you are, though you're able to articulate this best! Anyway, dearest, what was I on about...?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Aphrodite: \n\"I think for many of us, dearest, it can come as a surprise to learn that love and war often go hand in hand. Opposite forces, yet this connects them, doesn't it. The fiercest passions of gods and mortals! Isn't that right, Lord Ares?\"\n Ares: \n\"Mortals are so bent on clinging to their lives, that many among them would gladly kill for it. The surge of emotion which they feel... one passion is no different from another, Lady Aphrodite, dear.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Ares: \n\"Wars waged over love, my kin... can you imagine that? The lady Aphrodite and I can endlessly discuss such circumstances. I trust, from time to time, you stop to ask yourself how come you choose to fight. Not that you need a reason, of course.\"\n Aphrodite: \n\"Oh, Lord Ares, truly there isn't the need to cloud our little godling's thoughts and judgment with such comments, is there, \"hm\"? Let's give him what he wants, and we can carry on in private, about that.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Ares: \n\"I so anticipate the day you finally arrive upon Olympus. There are few amongst us here with interests such as those I think we share.\"\n Aphrodite: \n\"There are at least a few of us who share such interests here, isn't that so, Lord Ares? As for \"you\", dearest, you take all the time you need!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Aphrodite: \n\"The venerable goddess of the seasons, Demeter, chooses to look as stately as can be, can you believe it, dearest? Although, why one would mark so many fine lines upon their face, I wouldn't know.\"\n Demeter: \n\"Oh, Aphrodite, dear... you wouldn't know a thing of substance if it offered you a cloak. Your chosen countenance makes plain the full extent of your intentions, and your interests alike.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Demeter: \n\"Remember something for us, Zagreus. A frozen heart holds no sway over anyone at all. Isn't that right, oh Aphrodite, dear?\"\n Aphrodite: \n\"Oh, I don't know, my dearest Demeter! The frozen heart has tendency to thaw, and then begin to beat with renewed vigor after that. I trust your time shall come! It can never be too late, except for mortals, the poor things.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Aphrodite: \n\"My powers, dearest, oft go hand-in-hand with those of Dionysus, with his power to persuade the mind to find such beauty where it isn't, really!\"\n Dionysus: \n\"\"Ah, haha\", no need to flatter me like that, there, Lady Aphrodite! Beauty's almost entirely within the mind, I'm sure! And in the muscles and the jawline and the winning smile and, well, who am I to tell you, yeah?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Dionysus: \n\"Look, Zag, you should know by now that when it comes to feasting, it's Yours Truly here who puts on the best performance. But I do have Lady Aphrodite's help!\"\n Aphrodite: \n\"Wine does have a rather special way of making everybody look even more beautiful than ever, Dionysus dear! And from such beauty, why, long-lasting love is born! And also shorter-lasting love, much of the time.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Aphrodite: \n\"Oh dearest! I have brought you keen-eyed Artemis, who, in her focus on the hunt, has not developed social graces suitable enough to come to you herself!\"\n Artemis: \n\"Social graces, she says! Going about like \"that\"! I'm sure you know that I can find you when it's necessary, Zagreus. Though, how to get away from Aphrodite, I have no idea.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Artemis: \n\"\"Erm\", Zagreus, despite my hunter's instincts here, it seems I was unable to elude Aphrodite in this particular case, who insisted that we present ourselves to you at the same time, for whatever reason...\"\n Aphrodite: \n\"Oh, come now, Artemis! I'm sure you're very capable of hiding from a common beast, but I can see you plain. Why not be honest with yourself, next time?\"\nDialogue 03.\n Artemis: \n\"Hey, \"uh\", Zagreus! There's something I've been wondering, and don't take this the wrong way or anything, OK? Oh, no. It's her.\"\n Aphrodite: \n\"Why, Artemis, you're absolutely tongue-tied! Due to our little godling in the Underworld, or a little due to me? \"Hm-hm\", you shall figure it all out I'm sure!\"\nBeing Invited to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt; (Pre-Epilogue).\n Zagreus: \n\"OK, I think I'm ready. In the name of Hades! Olympus, this is an official message! And I hope it finds you well, Lady Aphrodite!\"\n Aphrodite: \n\"Why, \"this \"is something, dearest!

So many new sights and sounds and smells, why, it was wonderful! And you are burdened with a big responsibility, aren't you? Mind if I lend my graces to you still from time to time...?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Aphrodite: \n\"To think your father and that sweet Persephone, they were together down there, all along! I was so certain that your father's heart was cold. That's just the thing with love, dearest! That, sometimes, it surprises even me!\"\nMiscellaneous Conversations.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; Clearing a Run.\n Aphrodite: \n\"Oh what is going \"on \"down there, dearest? I thought for certain you would make it out, but seems that nasty place has kept you grounded, hasn't it. But don't despair, and you take heart, won't you?\"\nBuying Boon at &lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;'s Shop.\nDialogue 01.\n Aphrodite: \n\"Looks like we meet again, dearest, here among the foul detritus of the boatman's wares! You truly take me to the best of places!\" \nDialogue 02.\n Aphrodite: \n\"At first I didn't know how to get through to that odd river-boatman, Charon. Turns out he lusts for coin, and now I understand him well!\" \nDialogue 03.\n Aphrodite: \n\"You spent your hard-earned wealth on my account, dearest? Why if that isn't just the sweetest thing!\" \nDialogue 04.\n Aphrodite: \n\"One cannot put a price on love, but on my blessings, from the boatman, for my dearest? I'd say we're settled up.\" \nHigh Affinity Dialogue.\n Aphrodite: \n\"My dearest little godling, how fares everything with you of late? I love to have these little interactions with you, simple as they are, for they have brightened many of my evenings here.\"\nPost-Flashback Dialogue.\nDialogue 01.\n Aphrodite: \n\"You're going to love it on Olympus, little godling. The air is beautiful and brisk, the gardens lush, the feasting plentiful...! Why, it must be the opposite of everything to which you are accustomed!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Aphrodite: \n\"What shall we do here once you finally arrive? Perhaps we could go out and meet some \"mortals\"! I know all too many maidens and/or noble gentlemen who'd absolutely love to get to know you.\"\nAbout Legendary Boon.\nDialogue 01.\n Aphrodite: \n\"I have been waiting for a special moment to confess my great appreciation for your deeds... this moment's special enough, isn't it?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Aphrodite: \n\"My loveliest of blessings is reserved only for those who've earned my deepest adoration. So, congratulations, love! And here you go!\"\nDialogue 03.\n Aphrodite: \n\"Sometimes, our hearts become so full that they could burst! If only you could see how much I care. I would do anything to aid you in your plight! My heartfelt blessings be with you, dearest.\"\nDialogue 04.\n Aphrodite: \n\"Little godling, you must know that the heart has infinite capacity for empathy. And I so feel for you there, that I have mustered for you some of the most beautiful of blessings I can offer!\"\nAbout Love.\nDialogue 01.\n Aphrodite: \n\"Little godling, you must know the seven types of love by now, don't you? It's quite a complicated field, though several types intrigue me most of all. In fact, why, I have several types of love for you, right here!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Aphrodite: \n\"Dearest, why... I sense your heart is very full, indeed! You positively emanate with love. You must have grown quite close to many dear to you. Perhaps so you may do the same with me...? I'm so delighted to have seen your spirit shine.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Aphrodite: \n\"Oh, my, dearest! I have to say, your heart is positively bursting with such love for so many you have come to care about! Your dearest friends, your burning passions, family, \"everyone\"! Why, you're like a living testament to my entire body of work!\"\nAbout Backstory.\nDialogue 01.\n Aphrodite: \n\"I cannot help but wonder, dearest, why Lord Hades would have kept your mere existence hidden from us all this time. Perhaps he knew that, once you met us, you would stop at nothing to come seek us out!\"\nGifts.\n&lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Lady Aphrodite, I am truly blessed simply to have made your acquaintance, so, this is for you.\" \n Aphrodite: \n\"Lasting relationships are built on reciprocity.

I love it, and I would be lying if I said you shouldn't have!\" \n3rd Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Lady Aphrodite, I'm afraid there really isn't much here worthy of you, but perhaps this can suffice.\" \n Aphrodite: \n\"My, but if this isn't such a treasure to behold, and I accept it as a sign of your affection! Of something even more, perhaps...?\" \n4th Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Dear Aphrodite, surely you have all the offerings you can stand, but I would ask that you accept one more.\" \n Aphrodite: \n\"Ah, dearest, but it stirs my heart to know you care so deeply for our wonderful relationship! To celebrate it with such princely gifts!\" \n5th Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Dear Aphrodite, the incomparable beauty of Olympus is less difficult to fathom, having already met you. I am so grateful to have earned your favor.\" \n Aphrodite: \n\"My, but don't \"you \"come on rather strong, there, little godling! Though, I can take much more of your affections, you shall see!\" \n6th Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Aphrodite, you must have more worshipers and suitors than all your kin upon Olympus combined. I may not fall exactly into either category, though I hope you know my gratitude for all you've done for me is true.\" \n Aphrodite: \n\"You know, dearest, I am more worshiped than perhaps anybody else upon Olympus! You'd think getting such praise would roll right off my back by now, but no! I love receiving it. Especially from you.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"My lady Aphrodite, once more you've graced me with your presence and your favor, which inspire the best from me. Let this modest gift of Ambrosia signify I'm forever in your debt.\" \n Aphrodite: \n\"My little godling. I'd say you've honored me more times than I could count, but that would be a lie, now, wouldn't it. I so admire your devotion and your perseverance! If ever you do reach us on Olympus, I should very much enjoy getting to know you even better, then.\" "}

I'd hate to think the goddess of the hunt's too busy stalking some old woodland beast to join us in our time of need?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Aphrodite : \n\"Your brother, he was always such a sweetheart, love! Then out of the blue one day, he stopped accepting all my messages! Had I done something to offend? Imagine my relief when I much later learned that Chronos was to blame!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Aphrodite : \n\"I wonder what exactly Chronos did to cut your brother off, and all your family. Perhaps he \"bound them! \"In any case, don't worry overmuch. They're gods! They're probably all right.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hephaestus\"&gt;Hephaestus&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Aphrodite : \n\"You've met Hephaestus, heard the tales, no doubt. Well, he has a beautiful heart. Surely not just I can see that? Of all my many suitors, he alone has been content to let me be.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Aphrodite : \n\"Already met with my strong-armed Hephaestus, \"hm? \"The sordid things said of the two of us, they roll right off his back! Would that \"my \"skin were half as thick as \"his\"...\"\nDialogue 03.\n Aphrodite : \n\"I've heard many a hero claim the next best thing to arms forged by Hephaestus is his blessing! Though I think they'd all rather have mine.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;.\n Aphrodite : \n\"You've met many of us now, but not yet proud Athena, I presume? Apparently she's too busy defending our front lines. Take no offense; she's not the goddess of good manners, after all.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;.\n Aphrodite : \n\"Among all of Lord Zeus' kin, you've still yet to encounter Ares, \"hm? \"The god of war has been quite busy, what with everything of late. There are those who question his motives, but not I. I long simply to find out where he is.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Aphrodite : \n\"One thing's for certain, there's been \"far \"too little feasting on Olympus as of late!

I know them and their entrancing song only too well. They must have grown bored of dooming sailors to the deep!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Narcissus\"&gt;Narcissus&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Aphrodite : \n\"A little birdie told me you have met none other than the beautiful Narcissus, haven't you? You must think he's a shining example of all I stand for... well, he's not! Because the greatest love is \"shared\", not hoarded for oneself.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Aphrodite : \n\"I hope for your sake you avoid that no-good Narcissus. His suitors \"begged \"me to do something about his love of his own reflection, but who am I to break up such a harmonious relationship? As far as I'm concerned, he finally met his match!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt;.\n Aphrodite : \n\"You know, gorgeous, you're fortunate you got your mother's best! Of course your \"father \"always had a certain something, too.

We stopped inviting her to \"any \"of our feasts up here even before all this!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Heracles\"&gt;Heracles&lt;/a&gt;.\n Aphrodite : \n\"So, lumbering old Heracles is storming around down there, massing bodies of the dead in the name of the gods, is he? That one's as moody as a bull, and probably reeks even more. At least we have \"good \"help to lean upon!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Aphrodite : \n\"Lord Zeus already sought you out, \"hm? \"Family or no, if he's offered you his blessing, he's expecting something in return.

She and I work together frequently and have an understanding that we share. Fair goddesses must stick together, after all.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;.\n Aphrodite : \n\"I heard Poseidon boasting he'd already blessed you with his might. Now, just in case one could still be left wanting even after all \"that\", here.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;.\n Aphrodite : \n\"Bright Apollo's been in touch already, \"hm? \"How quick to lend fair goddesses a hand.

If nothing else, perhaps now Demeter shall tone it back a smidgen with the rest of us?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;.\n Aphrodite : \n\"More oft than not of late, swift Hermes has been nowhere to be found.

And don't just take \"my \"word for it, gorgeous. Your \"wise \"and \"even-handed \"uncle... he knows all about spreading the love around!\"\n Zeus : \n\"You're most correct, dear Aphrodite, for my rule is based on love of family and of mortalkind as well.

Well \"now \"is the time to use every means at our disposal! Why, even Aphrodite has taken up the cause, not to mention the spear!\"\n Aphrodite : \n\"Oh I'm no novice with the spear, Lord Zeus.

Behold, \"our Lady Hera!\"\n Hera : \n\"I think we're past the need for such pomp, Aphrodite. But then, more goddesses ought better understand the need to keep appearances even in troubled times... \"especially \"in troubled times.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hera : \n\"Even Titans and gods are quite vulnerable creatures, deep down. For we are all driven by a most-delicate instrument, as liable to stir our spirits or drive us to despair, as my dear Aphrodite knows full well.\"\n Aphrodite : \n\"Come now, my Queen! The heart's the strongest part we've got and tougher than it seems! We've withstood a bit upon this mountaintop, but we can take much more. Especially when our hearts \"all \"beat as one!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Aphrodite : \n\"I used to think your Lord Uncle Poseidon was a rude and useless oaf... but, after having seen his fighting prowess in this war firsthand, I've come to realize how wrong I was! He isn't useless in the least!\"\n Poseidon : \n\"Why thank you, Aphrodite! For I know how challenging it is for you to fathom the totality of my strength, as let's face it, you're not exactly the goddess of wisdom! \"Nor am I! \"And we have other common ground, in the \"beauty of the sea!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Poseidon : \n\"When battle rages all around, there's little time for love, little room for beauty! Yet Aphrodite here, she never loses heart! It's almost precious how she strives with all her might, brandishing that decorative spear of hers!\"\n Aphrodite : \n\"Well, good Lord Poseidon, I'm pleased to know how I inspire you. Though perhaps you ought pay more attention to our \"foes \"than to what I do with my spear, so we can turn this battle in our favor, finally!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Aphrodite : \n\"There's so much beauty on Olympus, love!

But on the count that we've much catching up to do, she's right...\"\nDialogue 02.\n Demeter : \n\"Aid from Olympus can take many different forms... as not all of us are suitably prepared or even \"built \"to face significant ordeals. Take, for instance, fairest Aphrodite over here...\"\n Aphrodite : \n\"Oh, Lady Demeter, you know that's \"patently \"untrue! I may be more a lover than a fighter, but that doesn't mean I won't mangle the faces of our foes, if that is what it takes to get them to \"back off! \"Now why don't we show your granddaughter how well we get along?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hephaestus\"&gt;Hephaestus&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Aphrodite : \n\"It pains me to admit there are occasions when love is not the answer, and a bit of sharpened metal can much sooner do the trick.

Whatever's going on out there, you got to love what you do, simple as that. Though don't take it from \"me! \"Got the authority right here!\"\n Aphrodite : \n\"Why, thank you, dear! We each have so much love to give. And the beauty of it is, the more of it we give, the more we \"have! \"To think that such a \"precious \"thing can have a limitless supply!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hestia\"&gt;Hestia&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Aphrodite : \n\"The fleeting quality of beauty is what makes us \"long \"for it! But even for those whose \"outer \"beauty has abandoned them, there's oft an \"inner \"beauty that burns bright! Don't you agree, dear Hestia?\"\n Hestia : \n\"Careful with that line of reasoning there, Aphrodite. You don't have much inner beauty to speak of, and your \"outer \"beauty I can melt off in a \"snap. \"And growing all those lustrous tresses back would take a while, by my reckoning...\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hestia : \n\"Come on, hop to it, hot stuff! While you've still got your looks! Not like Aphrodite here is gonna let you hold to them forever. She doesn't care for competition, you can trust me on that.\"\n Aphrodite : \n\"Sweet Hestia, whatever do you \"mean? \"I'll be the first to admit looks aren't \"everything. \"Who even needs them?

Olympus sure takes on a different feel when you're \"stuck\". We've cut back on the feasting and the frolicking a lot.

However, given how she delivers the line, the truth likely is that they don't spend time together due to her infidelity.\nWith Melino\u00eb, both express their great love for one another, showing that despite their differences, love can still bloom and be as strong as ever. Hephaestus reveals Aphrodite, despite the great attention she receives, probably feels lonely, for she lacks real friends. He isn't too keen on talking, but enjoys spending time talking with her, sometimes leaving his adored forge solely because of her. He calls her Aph for short.\nFrom Aphrodite's side, she praises his great craftsmanship and considers him a sweetheart, allowing her to be herself, being that the main reason she fell for him.\nAres.\n&lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;: The God of War.&lt;br&gt;Aphrodite regards him as a \"piece of the bad way,\" and she is the sole Olympic god with whom he appears to get along. He is exceedingly friendly and gallantly courts Aphrodite, dropping subtle hints about his affair with her. She deems him \"authentic\", as he genuinely experiences his emotions, unlike others who merely project perfect and righteous images of themselves, believing that love and war go hand in hand.\nShe does not seem to resent his peculiar taste, suggesting that Aphrodite looks beyond her own family. She notes that the others' antipathy is more rooted in Ares' dominion than in his actual personality.\nZeus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;: The King of the Olympians.&lt;br&gt;She has a lot of disdain for Zeus, tolerating him superficially and scraping together formalities just because they are substantial. Aphrodite addresses Zeus in a fawning and respectful manner, informing him that he need not meddle in her affairs, which are under her control. With him hurling a crass comment that the only things Aphrodite has under control are her long list of uninformed suitors.\nPoseidon.\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;: The God of the Sea.&lt;br&gt;Aphrodite delivers a beautiful speech to Zagreus in which she confesses that, although each member of her family has their quirks, they always remain united and the love they feel for each other will persist until the end. However, the plan backfires when Poseidon discovers the two of them talking alone. Poseidon says he will keep his mouth shut and leave them alone, implying that the goddess had ulterior motives. Aphrodite is incensed by Poseidon's rude comment and explodes in anger in front of Zagreus, expressing her surprise at how foolish and brutish he can be.\nDemeter.\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;: The Goddess of Seasons.&lt;br&gt;Despite being the goddess of love, Demeter claims that Aphrodite can be particularly venomous towards all the Olympians. Aphrodite will say how Demeter is pitiful for neglecting her appearance or how she has become cold and rigid. Demeter hints at how young Aphrodite is, considering her superficial intentions and interests.\nAthena.\n&lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;: The Goddess of Wisdom.&lt;br&gt;Athena and Aphrodite are like oil and water, Athena tries to maintain composure in front of her Olympic and cousin companions, with Aphrodite being the only exception; the two will openly insult each other in front of Zagreus and make no attempt to hide it. If she and Aphrodite are together, she will immediately express her disdain but puts it aside to help Zagreus. Even by Olympic standards, the two simply do not like each other, and their double-edged benefits often result in Zagreus being thrown in the middle of their feud.\nArtemis.\n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;: The Goddess of the Hunt.&lt;br&gt;Artemis finds Aphrodite invasive, and Aphrodite knows that Artemis isn't honest with her feelings, and may also tease her for being nervous in Zagreus' presence. Though even Aphrodite acknowledges that this could also be due to her frequent night outs. Aphrodite can be quite a hypocrite, claiming that Artemis is so focused on the hunt that she has forgotten to acquire \"social graces\". Artemis retorts that walking around naked is hardly a show of social graces.\nApollo.\n&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;: The God of Light.&lt;br&gt;Aphrodite appears to get along fairly well with Apollo. She considers him as one of the beautiful things that can be found on Olympus (herself included), and states that love and sunshine go together. However, a line of dialogue suggests that Aphrodite is upset that Apollo was nowhere to be seen when Zagreus was taken by Chronos.\nDionysus.\n&lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;: The God of Wine.&lt;br&gt;Aphrodite does not mix with most of the Olympians, except for Ares and Dionysus. She seems to have a good relationship with fellow Olympian Dionysus, considering him to be sociable to the fullest and referring to him as a common brother. She participates in his revelries, telling Dionysus how amazing it is to have the power to persuade minds through wine, which flatters him.\nIn the second game, she appears concerned about him. Aphrodite mentions his absence, noting that there have been few banquets on Olympus lately and that poor Dionysus hasn't been himself. She remarks that normally he would be among the first to welcome Melino\u00eb.\nHermes.\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;: The God of Swiftness.&lt;br&gt;Hermes comments to Zagreus how amazing Aphrodite is, he doesn't usually stop, but always pauses to wave at her. She never complained, so she seems to enjoy the attention.\nChthonic Gods.\nThe Gods of the Underworld.\nZagreus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;: Prince of the Underworld.&lt;br&gt;She is very sweet and approachable to Zagreus, affectionately calling him \"dearest\". She openly flirts with just about everyone, including Zagreus, making him feel embarrassed. She is acutely aware of the unresolved love tension between Zagreus and Megaera. She will act as a love advisor of sorts to Zagreus, and will support Zagreus if the two end up getting intimate again, she will chime in later and tell him that she is glad they were able to work this out once and for all. She will notice Zagreus and Dusa too.\nAphrodite also mentions him in the second game, saying that he has always been a sweetheart, full of love. She mentions that even after everything, Aphrodite kept sending him messages. One day, he simply stopped accepting her messages, leaving her worried if something she did offended him. She felt relieved when she found out it was Chronos who was responsible. \nMelino\u00eb.\n&lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;: Princess of the Underworld.&lt;br&gt;Aphrodite, upon learning that the missing princess was no longer missing, found it quite scandalous, becoming the talk of the moment on Mount Olympus. She immediately notices Melinoe's beauty and compliments her, calling her lovely and predicting that she will break many hearts. Aphrodite also remarks how proud Melinoe's brother must be of her for fighting for her family. \nShe is kind enough to tell Melino\u00eb not to worry about her brother Zagreus and his family, that they are gods and everything will be fine. \nAdditionally, she notices Melinoe's interactions with Moros and finds them intriguing, recognizing Moros's own attractiveness.\nHades.\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;: The God of the Dead.\nCharon.\n&lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;: Stygian Boatman.&lt;br&gt;Aphrodite finds Charon attractive; praising his sturdy, tall figure and powerful build but noting his loneliness. Unfortunately, Charon seems uninterested in the goddess of love.\nThe Titans.\nThe past rulers preceded the Olympians.\nChronos.\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;Aphrodite, like the rest of the Olympians, isn't fond of Chronos, commenting that \"the times when Chronos ruled were dreadfully dull.\""}

He appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;\" and offers his &lt;a href=\"boons\"&gt;boons&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; in her fight against &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;. His signature &lt;a href=\"Status%20Curse\"&gt;Status Curse&lt;/a&gt; is Daze which has a chance to cause enemies to deal no damage.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nApollo is a polite and confident god who tries to quickly sway Melino\u00eb with his charm. He is also somewhat egocentric, boasting about his numerous formidable talents, stating that all members of his &lt;a href=\"Olympian%20Gods\"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt; are talented but \"some are more blessed than others\". Despite being twin to &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;, they possess opposite personalities. Apollo is an extravagant socialite who enjoys being the center of attention, and his way of speaking is grandiose compared to his withdrawn and reserved twin sister.\nLike the rest of the gods, Apollo is vindictive when his pride is hurt and will turn on Melino\u00eb if his boons are not chosen during the Trials of the Gods. &lt;a href=\"Medea\"&gt;Medea&lt;/a&gt; will point out that he is also the god of plagues, sometimes sending an epidemic to haunt humanity without reason and during a duo boon conversation with his uncle &lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;, he says that a year or two of plague to the mortals who turned their backs on them will settle the score.\nApollo is also implied to be a notorious gossiper who can't be trusted to keep anything private to himself as Artemis knew that telling him about Melinoe's existence would ensure that all of Olympus would soon know about her as well. \nPhysical description.\nApollo appears as an attractive young man befitting his role as the god of light. He does not share many physical similarities with his fraternal twin, with almond-shaped eyes being one common feature with &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;, albeit in a lighter shade of honey, and his skin is darker, closer to his half-siblings, &lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;. He inherits his &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt;'s flowing, wavy, platinum blonde hair, but in a much shorter cut. His physique is lean yet defined, suited to his status as a celestial archer.\nHe wears elegant, gleaming golden armor richly embossed with a stylized sun at the center of the chest. A light blue flowing cape and golden pauldrons patterned with laurel cover his shoulders. He sports gold earrings in his left ear and dons a triangular striped red garment with golden details, fastened by a brown leather belt and golden accessories, with a colorful patterned underskirt peeking out. His neck and arms are adorned with golden cords and blue and red cloth ribbons. He wields a large golden bow with strings reminiscent of a lyre.\nHades II.\nApollo was informed of Melino\u00eb's existence by his sister Artemis, who then proceeded to inform the rest of his family. He thereafter provides his boons to Melino\u00eb to help her defeat Chronos.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\nMerchandise=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Ten words... \"In the name of Hades! Olympus, I accept this message!\"\n Apollo : \n\"Greetings from Olympus and well met, there, sunshine! Look, we can't get to the Titan, but if you truly mean to stop him, then the least I can do is light your way down.\"\nKeepsake Dialogue (&lt;a href=\"Purest%20Hope\"&gt;Purest Hope&lt;/a&gt;).\n Apollo : \n\"See, sunshine? Hope can work wonders when it's part of a good plan. For when you bear the Purest Hope I gave to you, I won't be far behind. And the warm fuzzy feeling's not bad!\"\nAbout Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Apollo : \n\"That Chronos is up to something, but not even Athena knows what. His assaults on Olympus always fail, even if they've kept us occupied. What's his next move...?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Apollo : \n\"To think we'd wage war against our own grandfather. Not that we should give Chronos that sort of credit. He's a disgrace to our line; a hateful Titan, not a god. Not family.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Apollo : \n\"I rather hoped old Chronos and his ilk would have seen the light by now, but alas. We'll just have to keep shining it in their faces for a while.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;.\n Apollo : \n\"When Artemis first told me your tale, I figured it was just one of her pranks. Taking on the Titan yourself, \"come on. \"But it \"did \"sound like something a vengeful child of Hades might attempt...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;.\n Apollo : \n\"I never was particularly close with your father, but I guess neither were you. Always struck me as a gloomy sort, though he did seem to care a lot about his own. He'll get his justice yet.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt;.\n Apollo : \n\"You trained under Hecate, the Witch of the Crossroads? She's well respected here, though we've not seen her in a while, of course. I often speak ill of Titans lately but I'm reminded that they're not all bad.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Apollo : \n\"Artemis always calls me little brother, when we're \"twins! \"At least she never comes home empty-handed from her hunts. Just recently she found a family relative and ally, poised to strike behind enemy lines! You are \"quite \"the prize.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Apollo : \n\"If Artemis was terse or impolite with you, don't take it personally, please. It's how she is with everyone. Always been the solitary sort, and we never know where she is when we need her.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;.\n Apollo : \n\"My half-sister Athena knew your brother well, and sends her regards. She's preoccupied with our defense, leading our front-line forces and all that! She regrets that she can't aid you thus.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Polyphemus\"&gt;Polyphemus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Apollo : \n\"The sightless Cyclops Polyphemus bars your passage, does he now? Don't know what good my light will do against the likes of \"him\", though perhaps I can help get you there in one piece.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt;.\n Apollo : \n\"We've confirmed sightings of that \"Eris \"buzzing about. She's from your realm not ours, so you may be more privy to how come she's showed up uninvited! Though, that tends to be her style. Somebody needs to shoo her away, already...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Apollo : \n\"My father Zeus already got to you, did he? \"Blessed \"you, I should say! He's a god of many inclinations. But when our rule is threatened, or even insulted, no one fights back more fiercely.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt;.\n Apollo : \n\"\"Ah\", you've met my stepmother, have you? I'm fortunate to feel loved, but Hera, well, I'm not her favorite. Long as no one leads her to believe you're Zeus's child, you will be just fine.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;.\n Apollo : \n\"Beneath our uncle Poseidon's affable veneer is a ferocity I've learned to carefully avoid. If he's backed you with his ocean-strength, you're better off. Go make the most of it!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;.\n Apollo : \n\"Word of advice about good Lady Aphrodite? Don't get distracted. She speaks of love and beauty, though she's no stranger to conflict. Perhaps my power can offset her own.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hestia\"&gt;Hestia&lt;/a&gt;.\n Apollo : \n\"Hey you got old Hestia to crawl out of the woodwork! She normally wants nothing to do with any of us, though this business with Chronos got her all worked up. Well, good!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;.\n Apollo : \n\"When Artemis first told me about you, I couldn't help but think of Demeter. She couldn't be there for your mother when Chronos struck, but I know she'll do everything she can for you.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;.\n Apollo : \n\"You got there faster than expected, which might mean you got a bit of a boost from Hermes! He's swift for sure, though I can never get a straight answer out of him about anything...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Prometheus\"&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Apollo : \n\"Prometheus himself, leading the assault against us ... one of our sole allies amongst Titankind, become a bitter foe! All because of how we treated him! Or because ... he knows which side shall be victorious when all is said and done.\"\nWith Other Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Apollo : \n\"\"Erm\", greetings, honored Cousin! I'm here now with none other than the bringer of thunder and lightning, magnanimous King of Olympus, your great Lord Uncle and my illustrious father, Zeus!\"\n Zeus : \n\"Oh, \"haha\", my niece and I are well past such a level of formality, my son! Though while we have the pleasure of her company, what say we show her how we put the \"light \"into \"lightning?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus : \n\"Melino\u00eb, my bright son Apollo, you'd be wise to learn a thing or two from \"him! \"Why he is just about the best at everything. Envy of Olympus, here to greet you, and to teach you, \"here he is!\"\n Apollo : \n\"I'm grateful for the flattery, Father. Though, your fair niece is more than capable of fending for herself. Still, an extra bit of insurance from the heavens couldn't hurt, right?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Apollo : \n\"I know you were expecting me, sunshine, but my \"glorious \"stepmother the Queen would like a word! This instant... so I'd better step aside, all right?\"\n Hera : \n\"You see, my dear? There are yet those upon Olympus who show their Queen the proper deference. Seek not to earn the love of your subjects; make them a bit afraid, instead.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hera : \n\"I fear for the younger generation. What can you possibly achieve when you're born with our worst qualities and not merely our best? Take good Apollo here... just like his father.\"\n Apollo : \n\"Now, Stepmother, don't all we gods aspire to your husband's excellence? I do appreciate the kind comparison! My fair cousin likewise surely has her father's finest traits!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Apollo : \n\"Cousin, our uncle and I were just debating what to do about mortals who turned their backs on us... I think a year or so of plague should settle up the score! But, Lord Poseidon here thinks it's more important to \"go big...\"\n Poseidon : \n\"Why would you \"not \"go big, given the choice, my delicate nephew? I'll shake the earth so strongly it shall swallow all those nasty mortals up, and deliver them straight down into the arms of your comely cousin there!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Poseidon : \n\"Have you yet come to know golden Apollo, Niece? He's so well known and loved among the mortals that he had no choice but to involve himself in our most recent family affair! Bending to mortal pressure like a bow, \"hah!\"\n Apollo : \n\"Oh, come now, Uncle, I don't yield to pressure quite so easily. I just knew this situation would be more than you could handle on your o\n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Apollo : \n\"I, \"erm\", lost my train of thought, Cousin, for Aphrodite here, she doesn't seem to understand the meaning of a \"private conversation. \"Lady, would you care to join us, then?\"\n Aphrodite : \n\"Oh, dear Apollo, \"yes\", I \"always \"care to join your conversations, \"especially \"the private ones! And is there any who could blame me? Love and sunshine go together, after all!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Aphrodite : \n\"There's so much beauty on Olympus, love! Take \"me\", for instance, or bright Apollo, \"hm? \"Your cousin, is he not? I daresay I see a hint of resemblance!\"\n Apollo : \n\"Now that you mention it, Lady Aphrodite, these flaxen locks of mine are a little bit akin to the pale luster of my cousin's flowing mane. There must be so much beauty in her realm, as well!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Apollo : \n\"All of us here want you to succeed, Cousin, though none so much as Lady Demeter... I'm reminded that you are her grandchild, after all. \"Erm\", wait, she wants to speak to you herself!\"\n Demeter : \n\"Thank you for your advocacy services, Apollo. Should I have need of them again, I shall apprise you. For now, my granddaughter requires our abilities, not honeyed words.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Demeter : \n\"You know, flower, how mortals seek to be like us? Yet in so doing, they take on our ignoble qualities. Perhaps it's Lord Apollo's fault, as the standard to which they aspire!\"\n Apollo : \n\"Did I offend somehow, good Lady Demeter? I know the times have been quite cruel, though why don't we direct that cruelty at our enemies, instead of heaping it upon each other here?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hephaestus\"&gt;Hephaestus&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Apollo : \n\"You know, Cousin, one thing you and Hephaestus have in common is you don't seem to get a lot of sun! I often try to coax him from his cave, and while I usually fail, not \"this \"time!\"\n Hephaestus : \n\"Come off it, mate, before the witchie catches on to your routine! Now make yourself useful over here, lest I stick this hammer right where \"you \"don't get a lot of sun!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hephaestus : \n\"\"Oi\", witchie, was just chatting with \"Apollo \"how not all of us are gifted with good looks, and silver tongue, and all. Got to \"work \"at something to be good at it! Like he couldn't imagine!\"\n Apollo : \n\"Oh, I can more than \"imagine\", Brother. Part of being talented is making things look easy. Take you and blacksmithing! For me it's quite like \"that\", but with a bunch of \"other \"things!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hestia\"&gt;Hestia&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Apollo : \n\"Great Hestia has joined us here, Cousin! Returned from all her journeys 'cross the world, to lend her wisdom in our time of need. Where glows her hearth-flame, you shall also find my light. And together, we can, \"oh\u2014!\"\n Hestia : \n\"\"Oh \"shut it, Golden Boy, we don't have time for pageantry! Instead, how about we show your wee cousin there how we can light up the night? Won't do for her to wander in the dark!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hestia : \n\"All right, dearie, let's get a real fire going! No more fussing about merely with sparks and such. Oh, \"Apollo? \"Get your buttocks over here right now, 'cause I could use a light!\"\n Apollo : \n\"\"Erm\", right away, dear Lady Hestia! Though, might we please take more precaution not to burn down half the mountaintop this time...?\"\nAbouth the Scenery.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;.\n Apollo : \n\"So you were born and raised in some secluded grove down there? No luxuries, mortal worshipers... so much living to catch up on once this ugly matter is resolved.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Erebus\"&gt;Erebus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Apollo : \n\"Wonder what there is to do for leisure down in Erebus, when one isn't rigorously training to vanquish hateful Titans and such. There must be something...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Oceanus\"&gt;Oceanus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Apollo : \n\"Where in blazes are you now, sunshine? It's like you're at the bottom of the sea. Wherever it is, it's awful dark, and as you know, I've always got the cure for that.\"\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Apollo : \n\"My word, you reached the surface, didn't you, sunshine? I thought your birthright meant you couldn't live up here! You're just full of surprises. So, headed this way? Let me help.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Apollo : \n\"The surface used to be more pleasant. But ever since the siege, Uncle Poseidon has been going all out with quakes and cataclysms in response. Stirring up the land like it's his mixing bowl.\"\n&lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Ephyra\"&gt;City of Ephyra&lt;/a&gt;.\n Apollo : \n\"How fares your voyage here, sunshine? If only we could whisk you over with more-godlike means, but the skies are as treacherous as the waters... as I suspect you've noticed.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Mount Olympus&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Apollo : \n\"We'll keep holding it together on this mountaintop, just as long as you keep holding it together... wherever it is you happen to be! Take care, all right?\"\nMiscellaneous Conversations.\nOffering Boon at The Start of a Run (Any).\nDialogue 01.\n Apollo : \n\"Just getting started for the evening, are you, sunshine? Don't know about you but I've got a good feeling about how this is going to go.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Apollo : \n\"The night is young, and I found you already. You don't suppose some of my sister's tracking skill is starting to rub off on me, do you?\"\nBuying Boon at &lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;'s Shop.\nDialogue 01.\n Apollo : \n\"It's fortunate the Underworld Boatman's still plying his trade even during a downturn such as this! I trust his prices have gotten better, at least? Or, perhaps worse...\"\nDialogue 02.\n Apollo : \n\"We have to reach you however we can, and Charon's been more than keen to oblige. Bit of an odd fellow, but then, aren't we all?\"\nAbout The War.\nDialogue 01.\n Apollo : \n\"Do bide your time, sunshine. The Titan thinks he has us pinned, but we have the situation here under control! Just locked in a bit of a stalemate is all.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Apollo : \n\"\"Augh\", this blasted war. Leaves little time for music or for poetry or any of life's joys. Though, it's brought the family closer together, I guess!\"\nAbout The Silver Sisters.\n Apollo : \n\"My sister Artemis once also trained with Hecate, you know! Trained in \"what\", however, I have no idea. I still remember how they'd howl at night like a pack of wolves, \"heh\". Bit unnerving, honestly!\"\nAbout Hard Times.\n Apollo : \n\"Our world's been through worse times than \"this, \"Cousin! So I am told at least, I've not seen anything this bad. Still, it's nothing we can't handle, right?\"\nAbout Route Choice.\n Apollo : \n\"So you get to pick your poison between going after Chronos in the Underworld, or coming to our rescue here! Truth is there's been some dispute as to which is the brighter idea. But, you must know what you're doing better than we.\"\nAbout Witchcraft.\n Apollo : \n\"So you're a witch, are you? Interesting craft. Your magick-making words possess a certain rhythm and power. Poetry is much the same! Except its magick affects only the heart.\"\nAbout Mortals.\n Apollo : \n\"Mortals look to us for guidance and inspiration. They must be \"horrified \"by what they're seeing of late! Half of them seem to be against us now. Let's hope it's the \"other \"half that's left once all this is over.\"\nAbout Family.\nDialogue 01.\n Apollo : \n\"I don't like getting swept up in family affairs. Much better things to do, you know? But I couldn't exactly sit this one out. Nor you I guess.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Apollo : \n\"No wonder Chronos hates us, right? Admittedly we've got some prickly personalities here, but for all our quirks, we're family; and we stick together. Something Titans wouldn't understand.\"\nAbout Prophecy.\nDialogue 01.\n Apollo : \n\"Bit embarrassed to admit that I'm the god of prophecy, among everything else. I ought to have seen this Titan business coming! But I didn't... and old Chronos caught us out.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Apollo : \n\"As god of prophecies, I'm certain that we're going to succeed. Exactly how, though, I can't say for sure. That's prophecies for you! Blasted frustrating things most of the time.\"\nAbout Route Choice.\nDialogue 01.\n Apollo : \n\"What sort of light can I provide for you today? I've got hard light, soft light, blinding light, last thing a mortal ever sees light... you name it!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Apollo : \n\"You ever wonder what light really is, Cousin? Can't grasp it in your hand, doesn't weigh a thing, yet it's all around us! A real mystery... I'm waiting for the mortals to figure it out!\"\nDialogue 03.\n Apollo : \n\"You're more of a night person, aren't you, sunshine? Accustomed to the dark. Me, I'm more the broad daylight type, but hey, to each their own.\"\nDialogue 04.\n Apollo : \n\"Don't know how you managed all this time without so much as a ray of light down there. Different worlds, I guess, but sometimes good things happen when such worlds collide.\"\nAbout Passions.\n Apollo : \n\"I like being the god of many things.

She was a mortal weaver who challenged and beat &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; in a weaving contest. The Goddess was so enraged by her loss that she cursed Arachne and transformed her into the first spider. \nShe appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;\" and offers her outfits through her Silken Fineries, which provide &lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;. She can be encountered in &lt;a href=\"Erebus\"&gt;Erebus&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nA skilled weaver, Arachne is exceptionally kind and helpful, a friend for all occasions, while offering her weaving services.\nArachne loves what she does, often humming as she admires her own creations, though she sometimes gets caught off guard doing so while working, blushing when caught but ironically speaking seductively when offered praise. She dislikes toads because they eat spiders, so she freaks out when she sees Frinos.\nShe's a lovely spider, but she sees small creatures as her adversaries, so they're wrapped in silk, showing the tiny arachnid is a dangerous predator. She dismisses when Melino\u00eb asks, insisting it must be the work of other spiders. Though she may seem charming, her laughter carries a sinister tone.\nDespite being a small spider, Arachne is quite bold and fearless, especially if Athena is not around. She claims to be a better weaver than all the gods combined, though her arrogance led to her transformation into a spider to begin with.\nSuperficially, she's quite cheerful, but beneath lies a deep melancholy. Delving into conversation reveals Arachne's profound resentment towards Athena for her current appearance and the Olympian gods for their general apathy. She's shocked to learn they are Melino\u00eb's family and are helping her against Chronos, leaving her torn but in the end chooses to still be her friend and help her despite her lineage.\nPhysical description.\nArachne is only met after she's been cursed to be a spider, with no description of how she was before other than she was a mortal young girl. She's not just any spider though. She has short blonde hair, decorated with a gold little crown, and green eyes. Her multiple legs are full of different colorful lines, interestingly focused on the colors of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Sisters\"&gt;Silver Sisters&lt;/a&gt;, with the occasional golden bracelet here and there. Finally, she uses orange gloves.\nHistory.\nBefore Hades II.\nArachne was once a mortal girl who lived with her father Idmon, who was a dyer. From a young age Arachne developed a passion for weaving, eventually becoming so good at it that she started to boast that she was better than Athena and the Fates. \nHelp Text Description.\nArachne: Silk Weaver. &lt;br&gt;\n\"Her pride in her craft, though not unfounded, provoked the gods to cut her down to size.\""}

It's not a \"partnership\" you've got with them, you know. They'll tolerate you just as long as they think you're \"inferior\" to them. Now, here. Take this and go.\"\nDialogue 05.\n Arachne : \"You know the gods did this to me, don't you? Although I shouldn't say \"the\" gods. Was truly just the one. But the others... they didn't \"care.\" They were complicit in the whole thing! It was as though \"I\" was a spider to them all along.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"Arachne... the gods could be kinder to mortals. You'll hear no argument from me on that. I've a certain point of view on it, myself. Most mortals I've met... they've all been dead.\"\n Arachne : \"Yet you abide Olympus, anyhow. I understand, I do! They're family. And that's one thing we can never change... not really. Although the Titan whom you're up against... isn't he family, too? \"Ha ha ha ha...\"\"\nDialogue 06.\n Arachne : \"So what's she truly like? \"Gray-eyed Athena.\" As wise and calculating as they say? \"Ha ha ha ha...\" to think she's supposedly the \"sensible\" one. She's just as cruel and vindictive as the rest...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"I wouldn't know. I've heard from most of the Olympians by now, but not Athena. Sounds like she's got her hands full, holding back the Titan's armies gathered at the mountain's base.\"\n Arachne : \"How very noble of her. Well, if you meet eventually, you'll have to tell me how she is. And do feel free to let her know Arachne's still alive and well, and weaving even \"better\" than before.\"\nAbout Pay.\n Melino\u00eb : \"There must be something I can do to repay you for all your hard work. We live modestly in the Crossroads, though we're not without our sources of supplies. Whatever you need, name it.\"\n Arachne : \"Well that's rather forward of you, my friend, and I appreciate it, truly. Whatever I need, huh. I'll have to give a little thought to that! But right now, I need for you to decide which of these dresses you like, and try it on.\"\nAbout Outfits.\n Melino\u00eb : \"Arachne, the outfit you wove for me was so beautiful. I'm sorry to say I got into a bit of a scrape or two... and I'm afraid it didn't survive.\"\n Arachne : \"Oh, \"hah\", that's quite all right, silly! It wasn't made to last. What is? It was made to be in the moment with \"you.\" Now here, I've plenty more.\"\nAbout Silk.\nDialogue 01.\n Arachne : \"My silk is everything to me. It's stronger than it looks. Keeps me safe! It can suffocate even the strongest prey. Don't you like it? Is there a certain... pattern-color combination you admire?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"It's lovely, Arachne. Look, I wish I could stay and admire it, but...\"\n Arachne : \"...But you can't. I understand, I truly do. Though, it would mean a lot to me if you would take some of my silk with you on your way.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \"Your silk is so luxurious, and the enchantments on the thread are strong. Arachne, it's incredible, really. You know that, right?\"\n Arachne : \"Of course I know, my friend. While I may not be quite as strong as you, for my size, I'm something else. And I don't tire easily! As for the rest... trade secret, \"hah, ha ha ha ha...\"\"\nAbout Food Dialogue.\n Arachne : \"You must be famished! Might I interest you in a little sustenance? And I do mean \"little, hahaha!\" I have a fresh batch here if you'd like to try them!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"Oh! No thank you, Arachne. I... have no appetite at all. And I'm not much for eating animals, even insects. Although I'm certain your flies are very delicious.\"\n Arachne : \"They \"are!\" A touch of an acquired taste, I know. But I got used to them much faster than just about any other aspect of this life. \"Ah\" well! Your loss, I'm sure.\"\nAbout Spiders.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \"You're always here all by yourself. The woods are filled with spiders... don't you ever get together, something like that? Make great big webs you couldn't on your own?\"\n Arachne : \"...I'll let you in on a little secret, my friend... I happen to \"hate\" spiders. Near as I can tell, all spiders do. Weaving's a solitary exercise. And besides! I much prefer \"your\" company.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \"I... for what it's worth, I never have disliked spiders, myself. They keep the woods free of pests. And what would this place be without their webs?\"\n Arachne : \"Thank you, my friend. I know you mean well when you say such things. If it makes you feel any better, I don't just hate what \"I've\" become. You gods... I hate you, too. \"Ha ha ha ha...\"\"\nDialogue 03.\n Arachne : \"You know the thing about spiders, my friend, it's that... well, they're my kin. My own brood, you see. But they're \"ungrateful\" rascals to the last! They want nothing to do with me at all.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"Your own brood...! You were the very first. But, how did you, \"erm...\" wouldn't you have needed...?\"\n Arachne : \"A \"mate?\" Oh, he didn't stick around. So you see, this curse isn't just \"mine.\" It's for generations still to come. Perhaps we spiders aren't so different from you gods. \"Ha ha ha ha...\"\"\nAbout Weaving.\nDialogue 01.\n Arachne : \"I loved to weave since I was very small. My father, he would make the richest dyes... reds like the setting sun, blues as deep as the sea, and \"oh\", the \"purples!\" I wanted to make fabric worthy of such colors as those...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"And now you do. You have extraordinary talent. How long did it take to get so proficient? I've practiced my craft all my life though still fall short of my goals far too often...\"\n Arachne : \"You'll get to where you need to be, my friend. I see how hard you work! As for me, as a young woman, I was already quite good. But truth be told, I'm even better now that I'm like this. A blessing... and a curse, \"ha ha ha...\"\"\nDialogue 02.\n Arachne : \"All I wanted was to have a little shoppe. \"Arachne's Garments, Dyes, and Fabrics!\" Not the catchiest of names, now that I sound it out. But our reputation would have been impeccable.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"I know it's not what you imagined... but you've a loyal customer in me. Although, the part where you ask nothing for your services does make me feel a bit guilty, I suppose.\"\n Arachne : \"Don't even start with that! My weavings and my garments aren't just for show, they're practical evening-wear! \"You\", my friend, are helping them fulfill their life's purpose, \"ha ha ha...\"\"\nGifts.\n&lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \"Each time I pass through Erebus, it's comforting to know I may run into you along the way. Here's something for your lovely lair.\"\n Arachne : \"Oh, why this is very sweet! It should attract a host of flies, I think, so thank you, very, \"very\" much! Now won't you please take this? It's only fair...!\"\n\"Arachne gives &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Silken%20Sash\"&gt;Silken Sash&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"Arachne, this is beautiful...!\"\n2nd Time.\n Arachne : \"Wait, is this what I think it is? Oh, \"no\", I shouldn't, not again. Weaving silken fineries for somebody such as you truly is an honor and its own reward! Besides, this stuff is for the gods...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"The gods may often be the ones indulging in this stuff, but it's not just for them. It's for you! For those whom we regard as friends.\"\n3rd Time.\n Arachne : \"\"Oh\", you're much too kind to me! I'm only doing what anybody would be doing in my place, but \"you?\" You're treating me like royalty! This Nectar... I tried a touch of it before. It's too good for flies... or spiders.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"Too good for flies, perhaps. But it's especially for \"you.\" A gift of friendship, whose savor only grows the deeper the friendship is. May it warm you on a cold night such as this.\"\n4th Time.\n Arachne : \"Come now, this is all too much! If I were still myself, why, I'd be blushing from my cheeks to my toes. It's just... it's been so long since anybody got me anything, you know?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"I like getting you such things, Arachne. It makes me so unhappy, sometimes, seeing you all by yourself like this. I can never stay for long... so perhaps this Nectar can remind you of the pleasant times we share, when I'm not around.\"\n Arachne : \"It most certainly shall. I won't forget your kindness.\"\n5th Time.\n Arachne : \"Ha ha ha ha\", I don't mean to be rude, it's just... \"imagine\" what the gods above would think, seeing their \"proudest \" tradition used to honor the \"lowliest\" of creatures in this world.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"You're not lowly! You're a magnificent talent. A beautiful voice. A trusted friend. I don't know anybody like you, Arachne! And I'm glad you're \"you.\" Exactly as you are. I mean it.\"\n Arachne : \"I... why, I'm \u2014 I'm very flattered you would feel that way... it's just... it's too bad you never knew me in my prime, you know? \"Ah\", but what am I saying, I'm just... \"ha ha ha ha...\"\"\n6th Time.\n Arachne : \"I know you're doing this just to be kind, my friend, except... the heart does what it wants, and... I, well... I'm concerned I'm beginning to take it the wrong way! I like being alone, I do... but I get lonely still, from time to time.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"I get lonely, too. But when I'm here, with you in your lovely little lair, I feel... oh I don't know, I... just want you to be happier! Perhaps it's as you said; the heart does what it wants.\"\n Arachne : \"Oh, your poor heart, if all it wants is \"this!\" You're a goddess... positively sublime, you realize? You must have a dozen others falling over themselves just to win your affection!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"Even if there were. My other relationships... none of them is any substitute for the one I have with you.\"\n Arachne : \"I see... \"ha ha ha ha...\"\""}

It is one of the main meta progression systems in \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nAt first only 9 cards are visible in the Altar, however, after a card is obtained, this will reveal other cards that are adjacent to it, making them unlockable. The total number of Arcana that can be revealed and unlocked is 25 cards. \nEach card first needs to be unlocked, most Arcana Cards require &lt;a href=\"Ashes\"&gt;Ash&lt;/a&gt; to be acquired. Once a card is unlocked, it can be activated depending on the level of Grasp they require. Grasp is the point value that each individual card posses, this number is the one found in the upper-right corner of the card, it may vary from the numbers of 0-6 Grasp. Although for the cards that have a 0 Grasp requirement, they have another \"special awakening method\" instead.\nThere's a limit to the number of Grasp points. This means that some Arcana Cards may have to be deactivated if they exceed the limit.\nThe limit starts at 10, however, it can be increased through the reagent of &lt;a href=\"Psyche\"&gt;Psyche&lt;/a&gt; up to a total of 29. In order to reach 30, the highest amount, you need 500, 2 and 2. However this still will not let you start a run with every card active, as there is a total of 62 worth of cards available, so you will need to prep accordingly typically based around which of the &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal%20Arms\"&gt;Nocturnal Arms&lt;/a&gt; you intend to use for a run.\nCurrently the Altar allows to have up to 6 pre-set Arcana builds to quickly swap combinations of cards back and forth.\nWith the Consecration of Ashes incantation, Arcana can be upgraded up to rarity by using &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Dust\"&gt;Moon Dust&lt;/a&gt; and other materials.

Unlike the more strategically oriented &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;, Ares' domain is the physical, violent, and untamed aspects of warfare. \nHe offers &lt;a href=\"boons\"&gt;boons&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;, which can increase his ability damage, inflict his signature Status Curse, Doom, or create Blade Rifts which deal rapid damage to enemies who walk into them.\nAres boons deal high amounts of damage over time, either by keeping enemies inside Blade Rifts, or by continuously applying Doom to enemies.\nHis signature &lt;a href=\"Status%20Curse\"&gt;Status Curse&lt;/a&gt; is Doom, which causes enemies to take a large amount of damage shortly after being inflicted, consuming the Curse. Ares also offers boons which increase the effectiveness of his Status Curse itself, such as Dire Misfortune.\nAres does not currently appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;\"'s Early Access, having gone missing.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nAres is a lover of war and chaos, and while he may have a calm and courteous demeanor, he revels in the chaos of battle. As the Blood Knight, he is willing to aid his cousin &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; in his struggles in the Underworld, leading him to sow a chaotic trail wherever he goes in his name.\nOther &lt;a href=\"Olympians\"&gt;Olympians&lt;/a&gt; are not particularly fond of Ares, and may curse him for his weak compliments. They find his thirst for polite carnage disconcerting. Ares is very confident, even arrogant, about his boons and often boasts about how his boons are better or will help Zagreus more than those of other gods, particularly &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;'s. They see Ares as a terrible influence on Zagreus. &lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, doesn't seem to mind and considers him a \"bad boy\". \nThe God of War is often misunderstood by his fellow Olympians. &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;, in particular, finds Ares' conversations \"embarrassing\", as he always lets slip his \"peculiar tastes\" and prefers to keep her distance from him, with his attempts to start a conversation always ending in disaster. He secretly admires the Chthonic Gods for their darker roles, and he is the only Olympian who treats them beyond cold affability. Unfortunately, his joy in death is not even shared by the Chthonic gods, who see it more as a mundane aspect of their work. \nIn conversation with &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, it is revealed that surprisingly, Ares is one of the few who still venerates them. However, it is implied that Ares' worship of \"chaos\" was misguided, as he confused it with the vast and infinite void of violence and disorder. He also mentions having studied \"all the designs of &lt;a href=\"Fates\"&gt;fate&lt;/a&gt;\" and is the only god to express familiarity with Excalibur, implying he knows much more about the future than Athena does.\nPhysical description.\nAres is described as a powerful man with broad shoulders, a dark skin tone, and white warpaint over his eyes. He is dressed in a complex set of heavy battle armor and a badly tattered cape. However, his golden helmet is damaged with a large red \"X\" carved into the forehead, and he holds it in his arms, revealing his white hair, strong jawline, and black-leafed victory laurel. Ares is armed with a red-edged Kopis, along with two other swords strapped to his back. His body armor appears to be themed around a vulture, one of his sacred animals, with a large raven's-face motif on his breast, alongside black feather-like decorations tucked into his shoulderpieces.\nHistory.\nBefore Hades.\nAres is one of the sons of &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike his younger brother &lt;a href=\"Hephaestus\"&gt;Hephaestus&lt;/a&gt;, Ares was born fairly normal and beautiful, being thus more adored than his brother. However, his bloodthirsty personality often pushed people away and made others dislike him still.\nHe is one of the Gods of War, specifically the main one from the Pantheon. He was accompanied often by &lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt;, the strife incarnate. \nAres and &lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt; have had lots of affairs behind Hephaestus's back and have been caught for it before. Despite not being Aphrodite's husband, Ares behaves possessively towards her, and he is often involved in the death of other lovers because of his jealousy. He did consort with others lovers.\nHades.\nAres is one of the gods that reaches out to Zagreus. He is eager to lend his powers to his cousin to aid him in his killings and wishes he could be present to see it. He often talks about war and death and his respect and admiration for the chthonic gods, as well as encouraging Zagreus with his killings and wishing many more.\nEpilogue.\nHe attends the feast alongside the other &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Olympians&lt;/a&gt;, glad to have seen Nyx face to face during it. From then on, he will continue lending Zagreus his help.\nAffinity.\nIf given &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;, Ares will give you the &lt;a href=\"Blood-Filled%20Vial\"&gt;Blood-Filled Vial&lt;/a&gt;.\nAres' affinity gauge is maxed out at 7 hearts.\nFavor.\nAres' favor requires completing the War-God's Bloodlust &lt;a href=\"Fated%20List%20of%20Minor%20Prophecies\"&gt;prophecy&lt;/a&gt; and slaying at minimum 10,000 enemies total. The affinity gauge will not immediately unlock upon completing the prophecy, but rather from a dialogue with Ares a few encounters later.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

For war shall come to you no matter what, as I shall presently reveal.\" \nDialogue 08.\n Ares: \n\"The whims of our kind are unpredictable, my kin. But you shall find responses to such acts to be the definition of consistency.\" \nDialogue 09.\n Ares: \n\"I'll not abide such disregard of our past companionship, my kin. In war, one must take sides, and you had best choose mine.\" \nDialogue 10.\n Ares: \n\"War shall be waged here, no matter what, my kin. But even still, I am dismayed you would have sided against me.\" \nDialogue 11.\n Ares: \n\"You wish to have a taste of what a war against me would be like? Well, then, I shall oblige.\"\nDialogue 12.\n Ares: \n\"Did I detect some hesitancy on your part just then? Perhaps you knew that you were making a mistake. No matter; you'll learn now.\" \nDialogue 13.\n Ares: \n\"You shall not goad me into anger with a petty insult such as this, you know. Nevertheless, there is a price which must be paid for it.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Gods\"&gt;Trial of the Gods&lt;/a&gt; (Making Up).\nDialogue 01.\n Ares: \n\"A sacrifice in blood is fully paid, and we are squared away. Though think you twice next time before you cross me, hm?\" \nDialogue 02.\n Ares: \n\"Well haven't you withstood my murderous intent! Resilience as this deserves reward, and I am feeling rather generous.\" \nDialogue 03.\n Ares: \n\"It is not often I attempt to kill someone and they survive. Bravo! Our score is settled up for now, so let us carry on as friends.\" \nDialogue 04.\n Ares: \n\"You capably survived my wrath, and I commend you for it. Let us continue on, as friends and kin.\" \nDialogue 05.\n Ares: \n\"I think that we are squared away, for now. Though, do not test my patience further, hm?\" \nDialogue 06.\n Ares: \n\"You crossed the fields of death impressively back there. Though, you are fortunate I'm in a giving mood.\" \nDialogue 07.\n Ares: \n\"When blood is spilled and death is dealt, I simply cannot remain discontented for too long.\"\nDialogue 08.\n Ares: \n\"What I could see of that display of violence you just sowed was thoroughly commendable, my kin. Then, here.\" \nDialogue 09.\n Ares: \n\"Your sacrifice to me just now has moved me to forgiveness for the time; thus shall we call a truce.\" \nDialogue 10.\n Ares: \n\"A war can only last so long, my kin. This one is not worth the pursuit, I think, when we can wage a greater one, together.\" \nDialogue 11.\n Ares: \n\"Ah, after a show of violence such as that, how can I possibly remain upset, my kin?\" \nDialogue 12.\n Ares: \n\"Your slight against me is already forgotten; for I was more than pleased to witness such a monstrous show of force.\"\nGeneric Greetings.\nLong Lines.\nDialogue 01.\n Ares: \n\"I must say you deal death rather exquisitely. Though, perhaps I could be of some further assistance in such matters, yes?\" \nDialogue 02.\n Ares: \n\"\"Ah\"! I figured that you must have been the source of all that bloodshed underneath the earth. Let me see if I can make your death-dealing a little more efficient.\" \nDialogue 03.\n Ares: \n\"Well, my hell-born kin, my blessing now is yours to do with as you wish; provided you inflict a little suffering for me?\" \nDialogue 04.\n Ares: \n\"I've just the thing for you this time, my kin. May I present my instruments of pain?\"\nDialogue 05.\n Ares: \n\"I surely hope your bloodshed's going well, and long that there shall be no end to it. I am, as ever, here to serve your benefit.\" \nDialogue 06.\n Ares: \n\"How fares your endless war against the dead? Let it be known that I am happy to take sides in such affairs. Please, I insist!\" \nDialogue 07.\n Ares: \n\"Death rears its head in all too many forms, I'm sure you know. Though you may never find them all, I nonetheless encourage you to try.\" \nDialogue 08.\n Ares: \n\"The wretched dead you face perhaps forget themselves. Go, then, remind them of the agony which brought them to your realm.\" \nDialogue 09.\n Ares: \n\"Life and death are inextricable, and war is often what connects the two. Don't you agree?\"\nDialogue 10.\n Ares: \n\"This world has a limitless capacity for pain; and so, it truly is no inconvenience to help you to bring out a little more.\" \nDialogue 11.\n Ares: \n\"The living and the dead alike desire what I represent. Their appetite for bloodshed cannot easily be sated. A goal to strive for, no?\" \nDialogue 12.\n Ares: \n\"Perhaps the dead you stand against have long forgotten the experience of anguish and despair. I trust that you shall soon remind them for me?\" \nDialogue 13.\n Ares: \n\"Beautiful, isn't it? The strife which follows you. You have a real knack for this, and I for one am happy to assist.\" \nDialogue 14.\n Ares: \n\"Some would question the destruction which you sow, but I shall never do so. I fully understand your impulses. Allow me to indulge them.\"\nDialogue 15.\n Ares: \n\"Not once has your Lord Father thanked me for delivering vast portions of his clientele. Surely you shall be more grateful for my gifts.\" \nDialogue 16.\n Ares: \n\"Do you suppose the dead feel pain unlike the living? This is for me an endless fascination, so go on, and give me more to think about.\" \nDialogue 17.\n Ares: \n\"As you continue waging war against the dead, I gladly lend you my support; family to family, no questions asked.\" \nDialogue 18.\n Ares: \n\"It is a veritable crime your father distances himself from all the rest of us. It is fortunate that you yourself are not so disagreeable.\" \nImproved Relationship Lines.\n Ares: \n\"Ah, my favorite Underworld death-dealer. I so look forward to the pain you shall inflict this time around.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Ares: \n\"Would that a sudden scourge of war would help you out of your predicament. Why, I would stir one up for you without a second thought.\" \nDialogue 03.\n Ares: \n\"Ah, my closest kin in all the Underworld, I see you there, I think! What sort of violence shall we sow together this time, you and I?\" \nDialogue 04.\n Ares: \n\"There's so much insufferable talk of peace up here, my kin. It is quite the relief to focus on much more important things, with you.\" \nDialogue 05.\n Ares: \n\"You must know I often hunger for destruction, almost uncontrollably at that. Though I am finding you are able to sate that appetite of mine.\" \nDialogue 06.\n Ares: \n\"May all the death you bring become the stuff of legends told in fearful mortal whisperings around the world, my kin.\" \nAbout Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Ares: \n\"Would that I knew the goddess Nyx, myself, my kin! So many of my wars are waged by night. I am most grateful, and I wish her well.\" \nDialogue 02.\nOption A.\n Ares: \n\"How is your mother Nyx of late, my kin? Have you yet given to her my regards? For I should think that Night and War would share a common ground.\" \nOption B.\n Ares: \n\"How is Nyx of late, my kin? Have you yet given to her my regards? For I should think that Night and War would share a common ground.\" \nDialogue 03.\nOption A.\n Ares: \n\"Do tell your mother Night Herself that I am often thinking of her here, although we haven't met. She must believe that there are those upon Olympus who admire her.\" \nOption B.\n Ares: \n\"Do tell Night Herself that I am often thinking of her here. She must believe that there are those upon Olympus who admire her.\" \nDialogue 04.\nOption A.\n Ares: \n\"Perhaps once all of this is over, my good kin, you might arrange 'twixt myself and your dark mother, Nyx, some sort of chance to meet? Do think upon it, and declare to her my interest if you please.\" \nOption B.\n Ares: \n\"Perhaps once all of this is over, my good kin, you might arrange 'twixt myself and the goddess Nyx some sort of chance to meet? Do think upon it, and declare to her my interest if you please.\" \nDialogue 05.\nOption A.\n Ares: \n\"Your mother Nyx and I, we have begun a correspondence, my good kin. I do appreciate you putting us in touch. She is a lovely specimen, if you don't mind my saying so, perhaps?\" \nOption B.\n Ares: \n\"The goddess Nyx and I, we have begun a correspondence, my good kin. I do appreciate you putting us in touch. She is a lovely specimen, if you don't mind my saying so, perhaps?\" \nDialogue 06.\nOption A.\n Ares: \n\"You shall be pleased to hear that your own mother Nyx and I, why, we intend to meet. I'm quite excited to exchange ideas in the flesh.\" \nOption B.\n Ares: \n\"You shall be pleased to hear that Nyx and I, why, we intend to meet. I'm quite excited to exchange ideas in the flesh.\"\nDialogue 07.\nOption A.\n Ares: \n\"Please send your mother Nyx my warm regards, won't you, my kin? Would that the others on Olympus knew and understood your kind as I now do.\" \nOption B.\n Ares: \n\"Please send the goddess Nyx my warm regards, won't you, my kin? Would that the others on Olympus knew and understood your kind as I now do.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Ares: \n\"Perhaps you know a god called Thanatos? The two of us are very close associates, you know. Do give him my best wishes, should you see him soon.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Ares: \n\"I trust that Thanatos is doing well? Although he brings to mortals merciful release, whilst I most certainly do \"no \"such thing, I do appreciate his take on it.\" \nDialogue 03.\n Ares: \n\"It is my understanding that you have grown rather close with Thanatos, my kin? A perfect choice of mate; though I confess I'd not expected Death to have affection for another save himself.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Ares: \n\"Lord Zeus has gotten to you first, I see? My father's gifts are generous, indeed, though... I think I can help in my own way.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;.\n Ares: \n\"So Artemis, my lonely half-sister, got to you first? She merely helps you hunt, whilst I shall help you kill. Observe.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;.\n Ares: \n\"You bear the blessing of Athena, yes? She would protect you from your enemies, whilst I would rather that you slay them, and be done.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;.\n Ares: \n\"\"Mm\", I see you have the Lady Aphrodite's blessing there already. Love and death, together, hand in hand? Sounds most agreeable to me.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Ares: \n\"That drunkard Dionysus cannot help you near as much as I, my hell-born kin. Compare the gift he gave to what I offer you.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;.\n Ares: \n\"Our messenger Hermes has been in contact with you by now, yes? Perhaps you shall not see him very often, for my work keeps him rather preoccupied, shepherding souls and such.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;.\n Ares: \n\"The blessing of your uncle Lord Poseidon might have helped you to this point, but here: My gift shall see you further still.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;.\n Ares: \n\"I faintly sense the mark of Goddess Demeter upon you, \"hm\"? Her power over plentitude is opposite to mine in some respects. But, lately, she has channeled it in manners more agreeable to me.\" \nWith Other Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Zeus: \n\"Nephew! By my divine authority, my oft-misunderstood son, Ares, now shall lend you a small token of his power. I'll make him helpful yet!\" \n Ares: \n\"It shall be exactly as you say, Lord Father. Your wishes are identical to mine.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Ares: \n\"I wished only to speak to you in private once again, my kin, except, you see...\" \n Athena: \n\"...Except you see, dear Cousin, that some members of our family are predisposed toward the unspeakable. I caution you around my half-brother, is all. Now carry on.\" \n Ares: \n\"You interrupt me once again, dear sister. You know I do not care for that. I warn you to stay out of my affairs. I shall aid my kin as I see fit.\" \n Athena: \n\"You only do as you see fit, Lord Ares. Mind that you continue pulling in the same direction as us all.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Ares: \n\"Well, my hellborn kin, I have to say that there are times I wish I could have been acquainted with your father somewhat more, if you'll forgive my saying so. My father and my uncle, here... they're predisposed quite differently than I.\" \n Poseidon: \n\"Perhaps if you were not so odd, and made more effort to be somewhat more approachable, Ares, then we'd have more in common, you and I! Should you need any tips on that, why, you just let me know!\" \nDialogue 02.\n Poseidon: \n\"Now, little Hades, you must know by now I've other nephews here, don't you? For instance, Ares comes to mind, the god of war! Some mighty wars have taken place at sea, is that not so?\" \n Ares: \n\"Indeed, they have, good Uncle Poseidon. Mortals show great ingenuity when war is concerned; it drives their sense of progress, more than anything at all. Perhaps someday they shall wage war even in Father's skies.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Ares: \n\"I so anticipate the day you finally arrive upon Olympus. There are few amongst us here with interests such as those I think we share.\" \n Aphrodite: \n\"There are at least a few of us who share such interests here, isn't that so, Lord Ares? As for \"you\", dearest, you take all the time you need!\" \nDialogue 02.\n Ares: \n\"Wars waged over love, my kin... can you imagine that? The lady Aphrodite and I can endlessly discuss such circumstances. I trust, from time to time, you stop to ask yourself how come you choose to fight. Not that you need a reason, of course.\" \n Aphrodite: \n\"Oh, Lord Ares, truly there isn't the need to cloud our little godling's thoughts and judgment with such comments, is there, \"hm\"? Let's give him what he wants, and we can carry on in private, \nDialogue 03.\n Aphrodite: \n\"I think for many of us, dearest, it can come as a surprise to learn that love and war often go hand in hand. Opposite forces, yet this connects them, doesn't it. The fiercest passions of gods and mortals! Isn't that right, Lord Ares?\" \n Ares: \n\"Mortals are so bent on clinging to their lives, that many among them would gladly kill for it. The surge of emotion which they feel... one passion is no different from another, Lady Aphrodite, dear.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Ares: \n\"The cold of death is quite becoming of the Goddess Demeter, do you not think so, my death-dealing kin? She is becoming well accustomed to it, too.\" \n Demeter: \n\"I think that you forget yourself, Lord Ares, sir. For I am much your elder; my famines had already slain the mortals by the tens of thousands by the time such thoughts of doing so first crossed your mind.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Demeter: \n\"Young Zagreus, once you arrive, do tell Lord Ares here that his great power's not worth anything without my own. Wars have their causes, among which, many I control.\" \n Ares: \n\"I do not question that your influence can stir a mortal's impulses toward war, O Goddess Demeter. At least we can agree that our domains are quite compatible!\" \n&lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Ares: \n\"Ah, my kin! I was just inquiring with Lord Dionysus here, under which circumstances are the greatest mortal feasts of all prepared? Because I have a certain hunch, regarding that...\" \n Dionysus: \n\"Yeah, yeah, Ares, I will hand it to you, man. There's nothing like a feast after a war, all right! Provided you're on the surviving side, that is! Otherwise I guess they'll be feasting with \"you \"down there, Zag!\" \nDialogue 02.\n Dionysus: \n\"You know, Zag, maybe once you get here, you could get old Ares to just lighten up a little, you know, man? Always dragging down the mood, with talk of blood, and nastiness, all sorts of stuff like that!\" \n Ares: \n\"Why, my Lord Dionysus! I fail to see why such discussion is perceived as unbecoming of a feast. A successfully conducted war is certainly a cause for celebration, is it not?\" \n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Artemis: \n\"Zagreus, I wish we all could hear you so that good Lord Ares here might be persuaded that my powers are entirely for different purposes than his!\" \n Ares: \n\"Perhaps our skillsets once were meant for different purposes, dear Artemis; but who are we to doubt the end result? Observe what shall transpire once we grant our kin our combined might.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Artemis: \n\"Zagreus, I was just hoping for a little privacy before this hunt, which is consistently my preference here, except, you see, Lord Ares always seems to come sniffing about, first sign of any hunting instruments!\" \n Ares: \n\"Why, my dear Artemis, the hunt is but a prelude to a war, is that not so? For if all mortalkind knew naught of hunting, why, they would not be nearly so adept at killing one another.\" \n Artemis: \n\"Look, Lord Ares, if I lend you better marksmanship ability, you think that you could bother someone else?\" \nBeing Invited to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt; (Pre-Epilogue).\n Zagreus: \n\"Here goes, then. In the name of Hades! Olympus, this is an official message! Lord Ares, please consider our proposal... once you're able to decipher it.\" \n Ares: \n\"My, what is this, my kin? Some sort of invitation for me, I presume. Not just for me... this symbolizes all the others, here? Most intriguing. I shall investigate the meaning of this as quickly as I'm able, then. But first!\" \nPost-Epilogue Dialogue.\nDialogue 01.\n Ares: \n\"I wish to tell you once again I had a splendid time during our recent shared festivities, my kin. At last, I've finally seen your death-filled realm firsthand! I learned a great deal. And I look forward to learning more from our successful collaboration, hm?\" \nDialogue 02.\n Ares: \n\"You know, my kin, I had misunderstood that Nyx was your mother. But, Persephone? I never took her for the sort to have an interest in your realm. Alas that we never had opportunity to discuss the subject here.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Ares: \n\"Your good mother, Persephone... dread Queen of the Underworld! I certainly misjudged her when we had occasion to interact whilst she resided on Olympus. Perhaps I, too, should consider a life there in your realm...\" \nMiscellaneous Conversations.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; Progressing in a Run.\nDialogue 01.\n Ares: \n\"You traveled rather far down there since last we met, my kin. And that means you have dealt incalculable death. I must commend you thus.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Ares: \n\"\"Ahh\", my kin! I sensed fresh bloodshed from you recently, the real kind! For you have slain the living near the surface, have you not? Mere vermin, yes, but good enough for me.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; Clearing a Run.\nDialogue 01.\n Ares: \n\"Recently, there was a burst of violence on the surface, near to where you are, but higher up. 'Twas altogether odd, but must have forced you to return once more. No matter; time is on our side.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Ares: \n\"I sense so much death at the gates of your father's realm, of late, my kin. Now, I know that seems perfectly ordinary on the face of it, except... there's something more. I wonder if \"you \"know the reason why...\" \nDialogue 03.\n Ares: \n\"I know your efforts to come here have repeatedly been thwarted, my good kin. However, we have caused such violence in the intervening time, that we must take this as a real victory. Let us continue for however long it takes.\" \nBuying Boon at &lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;'s Shop.\nDialogue 01.\n Ares: \n\"I knew that foul boatman would come through, and you would find amongst his wares this gift!\" \nDialogue 02.\n Ares: \n\"I give to you this token of respect, buried though it must have been within the boatman's hoard.\" \nDialogue 03.\n Ares: \n\"I trust the river-boatman Charon has been keeping plenty busy lately thanks to me?\" \nDialogue 04.\n Ares: \n\"The boatman Charon ought invest into a boat of more substantial size if he's to keep up with my work, my kin.\" \nDialogue 05.\n Ares: \n\"Your boatman there is a reliable deliverer of death, it seems. And that makes three of us, I think.\" \nAbout Backstory.\nDialogue 01.\n Ares: \n\"Know that I admire your Lord Father very much. For his grim work lets me continue mine. I trust that one day you shall settle your dispute.\" \nPost-Flashback Dialogue.\nDialogue 01.\n Ares: \n\"You are the son of Night herself, they say? A fascinating character, ill-liked upon Olympus, although I myself have always longed to meet her.\" \nAbout Legendary Boon.\nDialogue 01.\n Ares: \n\"The greatest wars require great alliances, my kin. And so, I shall entrust to you some of the greatest methods of destruction I've devised thus far.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Ares: \n\"The winds of war blow fiercely on the surface now, my kin. Thus I am able to confer upon you even greater power than has been my custom.\" \nAbout Kill Count.\nDialogue 01 (100 kills).\n Ares: \n\"Did you happen to know, my kin, that you have slain more than a hundred foes since you began your quest? You have! For I am keeping count. And I am most impressed.\" \nDialogue 02 (1.000 kills).\n Ares: \n\"You are a most impressive death-dealer, my kin. For by my estimation, you have slain at least a thousand souls down there! Souls mostly having died before, but still.\" \nDialogue 03 (2.000 kills).\n Ares: \n\"I know that you have many aspirations, my good kin. To be plain with you about my own motive for a moment: As long as you continue bringing swift and steady death, you shall have my unyielding support.\" \nDialogue 04 (10.000 kills).\n Ares: \n\"Ten thousand souls have fallen to you, now, my hellborn kin. I am rather beside myself, I must admit. Fine work.\" \nDialogue 05 (Aftermath).\n Ares: \n\"The more you slay your enemies, my kin, the stronger the bond between us, I think. Can you not feel it, too? Though, perhaps your lust for blood overpowers your other senses, hm?\" \nAbout Hades' &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Keepsake&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Ares: \n\"Ah, you bear your own father's blessing, my kin? Such a surprise... I know the two of you are now in league, and yet... I am still quite accustomed to the thought that you harbor war-like hatred for one another. Perhaps there's still a trace of that, though, hm?\" \nAbout War.\nDialogue 01.\n Ares: \n\"Surely you've heard rumblings about a war which has erupted on the surface, here? Doubtless you've seen an influx of fallen mortals. It's quite a decent one, I have to say! Though, unlikely to rise to the ranks of the greats. Too few armies involved in it, I fear.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Ares: \n\"War's such a wondrous thing, my kin. It solves so many different problems, whilst perpetuating its own inevitability. Let's keep it up, then, hm?\" \nDialogue 03.\n Ares: \n\"Do you ever think to yourself that you were born a bit too late, my kin? For my part, I wish that I could have been there myself when my father and the others waged ferocious war against the Titans. Ah, it must have been a sight!\" \nAbout Weapons.\nDialogue 01 (&lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Spear\"&gt;Varatha&lt;/a&gt;).\n Ares: \n\"You bear Varatha, the Eternal Spear...! I thought it lost! Have you any idea how many lives it drank during your father's glory days?\" \nDialogue 02 (&lt;a href=\"Heart-Seeking%20Bow\"&gt;Coronacht&lt;/a&gt;).\n Ares: \n\"Ah, you wield Coronacht, the Heart-Seeker. It pierced three Titans in one shot back in the war amongst our kind. Please do take care of it!\" \nDialogue 03 (&lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Aegis&lt;/a&gt;).\n Ares: \n\"You have the Shield of Chaos, Aegis... quite unlike the one my good sister Athena likes to flash around. You have much better taste.\" \nDialogue 04 (&lt;a href=\"Adamant%20Rail\"&gt;Exagryph&lt;/a&gt;).\n Ares: \n\"Why, you are wielding Exagryph, the Rail of Adamant! A most fascinating device. Imagine the new face of war, should its secrets someday be revealed, and spread to mortalkind!\" \nDialogue 05 (&lt;a href=\"Twin%20Fists\"&gt;Malphon&lt;/a&gt;).\n Ares: \n\"Well if it isn't Malphon, the Twin Fists, bound to your very capable hands! So many weapons are so indirect, I think. With Malphon, you are about as close to the destruction as can be.\" \nAbout Aspects.\nDialogue 01 (In General).\n Ares: \n\"I sense that you have forged a greater bond with your instruments of destruction there, my kin. Then that is very good. And may their altered forms serve you quite well.\" \nDialogue 02 (&lt;a href=\"Eternal_Spear%23Aspects\"&gt;Aspect of Guan Yu (Varatha)&lt;/a&gt;).\n Ares: \n\"Why, I believe that is the Frost Fair Blade you bear! I understand it shall become the instrument of choice of yet another god of war, someday. I long to meet him, this fellow student of death.\" \nDialogue 03 (&lt;a href=\"Stygian_Blade%23Aspects\"&gt;Aspect of Arthur (Stygius)&lt;/a&gt;).\n Ares: \n\"Ah, that blade of yours... it looks as though it could relieve a mortal of his head with ease. Excalibur, is it? I've studied all the Fates' designs, and this one is among my favorites.\" \nDialogue 04 (&lt;a href=\"Heart-Seeking%20Bow%23Aspects\"&gt;Aspect of Rama (Coronacht)&lt;/a&gt;).\n Ares: \n\"The fated bow Sharanga, in your grasp! That is not a form I'd expected you to wield. You have exquisite taste in weaponry, my kin!\" \nDialogue 05 (&lt;a href=\"Shield_of_Chaos%23Aspects\"&gt;Aspect of Beowul (Aegis)&lt;/a&gt;).\n Ares: \n\"Is that the fire-eating shield of the great warrior Beowulf, which you have there? I knew the Fates had plans for it, but I did not expect for you to be a part!\" \nDialogue 06 (&lt;a href=\"Twin%20Fists%23Aspects\"&gt;Aspect of Gilgamesh (Malphon)&lt;/a&gt;).\n Ares: \n\"Those are the gauntlets of the fated king Gilgamesh, are they not? A bringer of destruction, and an agent of the Fates. You are full of surprises, my kin!\" \nDialogue 07 (&lt;a href=\"Adamant_Rail%23Aspects\"&gt;Aspect of Lucifer (Exagryph)&lt;/a&gt;).\n Ares: \n\"You bear the warring instrument of one called Lucifer, I see. I've little to go on about him, but it is clear he knows a thing or two about destruction, is it not?\" \nGifts.\n&lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Lord Ares, please accept this offering, for giving me such strength as necessary to succeed.\" \n Ares: \n\"You are a flatterer, my death-inflicting kin. And I am feeling generous, as well, so here! A small token for you of my affection.\" \n\"Ares gives &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Blood-Filled%20Vial\"&gt;Blood-Filled Vial&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"You have my thanks, Lord Ares.\"\n2nd Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Lord Ares, I honor you for all the strength you've given me to overcome my foes.\" \n Ares: \n\"Such a splendid offering, to me!

She is the only one among the Olympic athletes with whom he seems to get along. He is very friendly and gallantly courts Aphrodite, dropping some indirect hints about his affair with her. She considers him \"authentic,\" contrasting him with others who merely go through the motions to pretend to be what they are not.\nShe doesn't seem to resent his peculiar taste, suggesting that Aphrodite looks beyond her own family. She observes that their antipathy is more based on Ares' dominance than his actual personality. Ares can only be tamed by her and she seems to appreciate his wild side.\nHera.\n&lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt;: Ares's mother.&lt;br&gt;Their relationship is currently unknown.\nZeus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;: Ares's father.&lt;br&gt;Even though Ares is his \"legitimate\" son, it is evidently explicit that he is not his father's favorite. Ares maintains a respectful and superior tone when addressing his father, not sparing compliments. However, the shadow of Zeus's disapproval looms over him. Nonetheless, Ares is determined in his quest for his father's approval.\nAres wonders if his father should try to understand his son better, and if he can find a side he appreciates, which he doesn't.\nZeus does not conceal his disapproval and wonders if he should try to better understand his son. Even though Zeus condemns Ares for his violent behavior and believes that his son does not seek help in the same way he does, Ares considers that their desires are identical to those of his father. They both seek the same results but through different approaches and methods.\nHephaestus.\n&lt;a href=\"Hephaestus\"&gt;Hephaestus&lt;/a&gt;: Ares's brother.&lt;br&gt;Their relationship is currently unknown.\nAthena.\n&lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;: Ares's half-sister.&lt;br&gt;Alongside Athena, his older half-sister, Ares represents bloodshed, while Athena represents military strategy. The two are war gods with opposing perspectives and temperaments. Athena disapproves of Ares' style, and he warns her to stay out of his own business. Despite their sibling quarrels, Ares considers Athena a worthy adversary and praises her battle strategy to Zagreus. Athena is quite cordial and respectful towards her fellow Olympians, even Ares, despite how much they butt heads.\nArtemis.\n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;: Ares's half-sister.&lt;br&gt;In his Duo Benefit with Artemis, he is happy to try to work together, as he considers Hunting and War quite similar domains. Artemis finds his older half-brother's comments chilling, cringes and does not reciprocate or share the same vibe.\nApollo.\n&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;: Ares's half-brother.&lt;br&gt;Their relationship is currently unknown.\nDemeter.\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;: Ares's maternal aunt.&lt;br&gt;Demeter is the aunt of Ares through his mother Hera, yet he does not receive preferential treatment from her. He mentions her as a companion of death, as her cold has already caused the death of many mortals. Demeter will not appreciate her nephew's comment and will say that her famines had killed tens of thousands of mortals before Ares properly thought about it.\nHermes.\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;: Ares's half-brother.&lt;br&gt;Although Hermes does not directly criticize his older half-brother Ares, he does indirectly comment to his cousin Zagreus that there's \"nothing like a good old fashioned war between mortals to create demand for lots and lots of messages to circulate!\", indicating that he is burdening him further.\nDionysus.\n&lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;: Ares's half-brother.&lt;br&gt;Dionysus finds Ares too tempestuous. He thinks Zagreus can help him feel lighter. Ares seems to enjoy the parties his youngest half-brother throws, but dislikes his general passivity.\nPoseidon.\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;: Ares's uncle.&lt;br&gt;Both have caused wars, on land and at sea, and they have different views on war. Poseidon thinks that if his nephew weren't so odd and made an effort to be more approachable, they would have more in common. Ares is grateful to his uncle; it was he who spoke for the god of war when he was sometimes imprisoned and humiliated.\nChthonic Gods.\nThe gods of the underworld exercise a real fascination over Ares. Unlike the other Olympians, he is a big fan of their work.\nZagreus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;: Ares's cousin.&lt;br&gt;Ares sees Zagreus as a fellow student of death and tries to take him under his wing to guide him into becoming more bloodthirsty. Athena and Artemis, in particular, are wary that Ares will be a toxic friend and a negative influence on Zagreus. Despite this, Ares commends Zagreus's immense skill in killing, which comes naturally given his love for violence. Ares gladly offers his cousin his blessings so that Zagreus can carve a bloody path through the underworld on his way out.\nHades.\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;: Ares's uncle.&lt;br&gt;Ares will express his admiration for his Uncle Hades, as he sees War and Death as going hand in hand. Ares is notably the only Olympian god who will offer praise to Hades without it feeling like a backhanded compliment.\nNyx.\n&lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;: Night Incarnate.&lt;br&gt;Ares has a fixation on chthonic gods and has an admiration and apparent platonic crush or mutual respect for Nyx. As the other Olympians dislike Nyx, they consider Ares an abominable admirer. Nyx suggests that she might actually enjoy the attention and surprisingly, seems to appreciate affection from him.\nThanatos.\n&lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;: Death Incarnate.&lt;br&gt;Thanatos is quite perplexed when Zagreus tells him how much Ares sings his praises. When asked what his opinion is of Ares, Thanatos admits that he doesn't like Ares' views on death, but at least appreciates that he is genuinely cordial to him, unlike most other Olympians. Ares sometimes tells Zagreus to send his regards to the god of death or just take the time to ask if he's doing well. He'll also be fully on board if Zagreus and Thanatos ever become a couple, saying that Zagreus has chosen a good mate.\nChaos.\n&lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt;: The ancestor of Ares.&lt;br&gt;Ares idolizes Chaos; however, Chaos says that despite his worship, Ares does not know them well."}

The standard attack throws out a skull like a bouncing explosive grenade which explodes in a moderate area when it hits an enemy, and the \u03a9 Attack charges up a skull to fire at a more specific targeted point. Both of these leave the skull where it is after it explodes and you will need to pick them up to re-use them, it starts with an ammo capacity of 3 skulls. The Special is a quick dash, while the \u03a9 Special is virtually identical to the rushing charge of the Shield of Chaos; a long-range dash that damages everything in the way and you are protected from damage during the dash, with this one also firing bolts to both sides as you dash. Note, however, you are NOT protected from damage while charging and holding this like the original shield did. Overall this is built more around an evasive playstyle."}

She offers &lt;a href=\"boons\"&gt;boons&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; which give his abilities the chance to deal &lt;a href=\"Critical\"&gt;Critical&lt;/a&gt; damage. In addition, she also offers boons that improve &lt;a href=\"Cast\"&gt;Cast&lt;/a&gt; abilities.\nWhile the damage bonus offered on her boons is lower compared to other Gods', the Critical hits they offer deal three times the damage of a normal ability, granting some of the best overall DPS gain offered by any single god or goddess. Artemis boons, when properly combined with other boons, have the potential to deal tremendous damage. In addition, her Cast related boons increase your total ammo or add a projectile, further enabling a powerful ranged tool.\nHer signature &lt;a href=\"Status%20Curse\"&gt;Status Curse&lt;/a&gt; is Marked, which increases the chance of dealing a critical hit to the afflicted enemy, consuming the Curse and reapplying it to a nearby target. This essentially allows you to snowball critical hits in a crowd. This increase in chance will stack with her boons that offer Critical hit chance.\nArtemis returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;\" and offers her boons to &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; in her fight against &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;. Her signature Status Curse is still Marked. Unlike the first game, Artemis appears in specific chambers in-person and can help clear enemies. She can be encountered on &lt;a href=\"Erebus\"&gt;Erebus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oceanus\"&gt;Oceanus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Ephyra\"&gt;City of Ephyra&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nArtemis is taciturn, unsociable, and indifferent to her &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Olympian family&lt;/a&gt;. As a goddess associated with hunting and a master archer, she prefers to retreat to the forest and be alone or with her nymphs, hunting or engaging in activities that do not involve social interaction or spending too much time with her noisy and complicated family.\nA stoic goddess who prefers to associate with nature through her hunting and hide in her own private world. Artemis is seen as \"a lone she-wolf.\" As noted by other gods, she is socially awkward, which may be due to her presence as the goddess of the wilderness or the lack of social interaction due to her frequent nocturnal outings.\nThe Goddess of the Hunt tends to be direct and practical, questioning &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; about his choice of the &lt;a href=\"Adamant%20Rail\"&gt;Adamant Rail&lt;/a&gt;, as it is too noisy and doesn't seem very effective as a hunting weapon. She prefers the good old bow and arrow. \nDespite not being \"perfect &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;,\" she tries to act as the obedient daughter. However, all she receives is criticism from her &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt;. Artemis can be quite sarcastic and doesn't like it when the gods poke their noses where they're not wanted or question why she's still single. She is a vengeful goddess and rebels quickly, unafraid to poke at the wounds of other Olympians if necessary.\nDistant, reserved, is a master of dodging others, Artemis is not honest about feelings, and she is the only one who doesn't use a term of endearment to Zagreus, calling him only by his name. He may see her as a sort of distant role model, although in reality, she is quite nervous and unsure how to react in his presence. As she opens up, she will admit in a somewhat dismissive way that she considers him one of her best friends. She too sees nymphs as equals, despite them minor deities, which is quite revealing for a goddess of such high echelon.\nPhysical description.\nArtemis appears as a nimble young maiden with green hair and skin, adorned with a variety of snug animal skins alongside a green hunting cloak and a large quiver. Her hair is styled in a single large braid and crowned with a pair of animal horns, specifically those of a deer, one of her sacred animals. Her right eye is painted green with a star pattern, accentuating her dark eye (In Hades II her eyes are more visible and almond-shaped like her twin &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;'s, but in a darker shade than his). Her association with the moon can be seen in the crescent symbols worn in her hair and on her body. She is seen armed with a large wooden bow with a trio of perched quails at one end.\nArtemis' physical appearance hasn't changed much in Hades II, but she appears more confident in her stance. She now sports a new bow and quiver and has traded her green hunting cloak for a fur cloak. Her right wrist holds a wristband with a crescent moon on it instead of bandages, as does her left leg. Her belt has been changed to a larger and silver one, also with crescent moons. Further decorating her belt and quiver are the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Sisters\"&gt;Silver Sisters&lt;/a&gt; braided cords. She no longer has the green star on her eye and her hair is styled into two ponytails rather than a single braid.\nHades.\nArtemis is one of the &lt;a href=\"Olympian\"&gt;Olympian&lt;/a&gt; gods that lends their help to Zagreus. Her conversations often include talks about hunting and encouragements to Zagreus. She also speaks her opinion about others freely, and often mentions her discomfort in them always being on her case or misinterpreting her intentions and domain.\nIn the Epilogue, Artemis was super excited to have finally met &lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt; face to face. Despite not being very sociable, she enjoyed the time she spent there. From then on, she keeps on lending her help to Zagreus on his new job.\nHades II.\nAlong with her brother Hermes, only Artemis knew of Melino\u00eb's existence prior to her beginning her task. \nAffinity.\nIf given &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;, Artemis will give you the &lt;a href=\"Adamant%20Arrowhead\"&gt;Adamant Arrowhead&lt;/a&gt;.\nArtemis' affinity gauge maxes out at 7 hearts, requiring the gifting of 6 Nectar and 1 &lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt;.\nFavor.\nArtemis' favor requires seeing multiple strings of dialogue in which she talks about her partner, Callisto. The gauge is unlocked when Artemis says that she feels like she can be herself with Zagreus.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}
