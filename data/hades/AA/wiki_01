Well, several, really. Anyway! In the name of Hades! Olympus? I accept this message.\" \n Artemis: \n\"I heard about you. Look, I'm not like all the others on Olympus. The power of the hunt helps keep me company, so... maybe it'll help you, too!\" \nKeepsake Dialogue (&lt;a href=\"Adamant%20Arrowhead\"&gt;Adamant Arrowhead&lt;/a&gt;).\nKeepsake Equipped.\n Artemis: \n\"Hey, that's my Adamant Arrowhead on you! Normally, it's for killing things, but in your case it makes it even easier for me to hunt you down, even in the dark. Now that I found you... here!\" \nReactions.\nSeeing &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; at Low Health.\nDialogue 01.\n Artemis: \n\"Hey, you all right there, Zagreus? Wouldn't do to have you die on me just moments after meeting here like this.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Artemis: \n\"\"Oh\"! Look at you, you're hurt there pretty bad, but, just stay focused on the hunt, and it'll help to keep the pain at bay.\" \nDialogue 03.\n Artemis: \n\"Look, I'm just goddess of the hunt, not medicine, so... I don't know if this is going to help right now, but, here!\" \nDialogue 04.\n Artemis: \n\"Your hunt has evidently not been going very well so far, I see. Though, maybe we can still turn it around.\" \nDialogue 05.\n Artemis: \n\"Well, one good thing about all of the blood you've lost is it was even easier to track you down this time!\" \n&lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Gods\"&gt;Trial of the Gods&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Gods\"&gt;Trial of the Gods&lt;/a&gt; (Rejection).\nDialogue 01.\n Artemis: \n\"Why would you side with...?! \"Ugh\", why do I even bother with some lesser god!\" \nDialogue 02.\n Artemis: \n\"I thought we had an understanding, Zagreus. But, this wouldn't be the first time I was wrong about someone.\" \nDialogue 03.\n Artemis: \n\"\"Huh\", so that's your choice! Maybe you're more like my relatives than I'd care to admit.\" \nDialogue 04.\n Artemis: \n\"Good shot, there, Zagreus! I guess you got me. Now why don't you go take a shot at \"this\".\" \nDialogue 05.\n Artemis: \n\"Don't be messing with my feelings, Zagreus. My loyalty's hard-won, and quickly lost.\" \nDialogue 06.\n Artemis: \n\"You really missed an easy shot, here, Zagreus. But I will not. You'll see.\" \nDialogue 07.\n Artemis: \n\"Ah, good! Just when I had almost forgotten what an arrow to the back felt like!\" \nDialogue 08.\n Artemis: \n\"Am I some kind of pushover to you, Zagreus? Is that what you think?\" \nDialogue 09.\n Artemis: \n\"Oh, look, turns out it's time for target practice once again! Start running, Zagreus.\"\nDialogue 10.\n Artemis: \n\"What made you think I'd stand for this, from you?\"\nDialogue 11.\n Artemis: \n\"\"Ah-hah\", I knew you'd pull this old maneuver, Zagreus. And I am ready for you, now.\" \nDialogue 12.\n Artemis: \n\"You're getting quite predictable when you betray me like this, Zagreus! Start running, then.\" \nDialogue 13.\n Artemis: \n\"Oh really, that's the way it's going to be? You Underworld gods are all alike!\" \n&lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Gods\"&gt;Trial of the Gods&lt;/a&gt; (Making Up).\nDialogue 01.\n Artemis: \n\"Fine, I'm not angry anymore, not really anyway, but you just watch yourself with me, you got it?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Artemis: \n\"Oh you're still there I see. Well then, all right, let's call it even for the moment and get on with this.\" \nDialogue 03.\n Artemis: \n\"All right, all right, I'm going to forgive you now I guess, no need to beg, you just think twice next time OK?\" \nDialogue 04.\n Artemis: \n\"Got to say you handled yourself pretty well back there. I can't stay mad after a show like that.\"\nDialogue 05.\n Artemis: \n\"Good hunting just now, Zagreus. You passed my little test, so now we're good, just like it never happened.\" \nDialogue 06.\n Artemis: \n\"So you survived, so what. Here, why not take a Boon, and then be off?\"\nDialogue 07.\n Artemis: \n\"I will admit mistakes were made back there, so you just don't make them again, next time all right?\" \nDialogue 08.\n Artemis: \n\"You know what, I decided not to kill you, Zagreus. No sport in cornered prey, so here, get on with it.\" \nDialogue 09.\n Artemis: \n\"Good thing you're nowhere near our mountaintop or I'd have shot you for that stunt, myself.\" \nDialogue 10.\n Artemis: \n\"Well, Zagreus, it turns out you need all the help that you can get, so here's a pity Boon for you!\" \nDialogue 11.\n Artemis: \n\"I could keep hunting you until you're dead, but there's too little meat on you to make it worth my while.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Gods\"&gt;Trial of the Gods&lt;/a&gt; (Killing &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;).\nDialogue 01.\n Artemis: \n\"You may be good at running, Zagreus, but you're bad at hiding.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Artemis: \n\"You make me mad, I'll hunt you like a stag. You heard of those?\"\nDialogue 03.\n Artemis: \n\"Don't anger me next time, won't shoot you dead, is it a deal?\"\nGeneric Greetings.\nLong Lines.\nDialogue 01.\n Artemis: \n\"Hey. You're not alone. You're not alone down there, OK? Here, let me show you.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Artemis: \n\"The dead must make a rather easy target, wouldn't you say? Let's see what you can do to them, given your choice of these.\" \nDialogue 03.\n Artemis: \n\"You busy, Zagreus? Thought maybe I could interest you in some of these old hunting tricks of mine.\" \nDialogue 04.\n Artemis: \n\"How fares the hunt this time around, OK? I bet it could be better, so, \"erm\", here! Maybe this'll help.\" \nDialogue 05.\n Artemis: \n\"Let's take a little hunting expedition, yeah? You'll do most of the work, but hey, I'll be with you in spirit!\" \nDialogue 06.\n Artemis: \n\"Sorry you're still stuck down there. Sometimes I feel stuck myself, but, a good hunt always sets me straight.\" \nDialogue 07.\n Artemis: \n\"When I am on the hunt, my mind is clear, and nothing stands between me and my target. Though, have a blessing just in case you can't relate!\" \nDialogue 08.\n Artemis: \n\"I'd love to know about your life down there. I'll try and help you live through it this time so that way you can tell me?\" \nDialogue 09.\n Artemis: \n\"The wretches whom you face down there have died already, sometimes more than once. Should make for easy targets, right?\" \nDialogue 10.\n Artemis: \n\"I've never come across a target I couldn't take down. I expect the same of you, you hear me? Hopefully you hear me.\" \nDialogue 11.\n Artemis: \n\"Good hunting, Zagreus! The sooner you get out of there the sooner you can save me from my insufferable relatives. Please?\" \nDialogue 12.\n Artemis: \n\"Hey, Zagreus, good luck out there, this time. I'd tell you \"'may your aim be true' \"but I can guarantee it, actually.\" \nDialogue 13.\n Artemis: \n\"The hunt requires utter concentration, so, I'll leave you to it, and... just watch your every move in silence over here...\" \nDialogue 14.\n Artemis: \n\"You want to make it out of there, you... don't have to listen to a word I say, to be quite honest, but... my huntress blessings ought to help.\"\nDialogue 15.\n Artemis: \n\"Well, Zagreus, you getting out of there this time, or am I going to have to keep on hunting by myself for the time being? Probably?\" \nDialogue 16.\n Artemis: \n\"Looks to me like you could use a little help, so I'll just have a look in my big bag of blessings here, and, \"oh\"! Here's just the thing.\" \nDialogue 17.\n Artemis: \n\"The hunt comes down to kill-or-be-killed. Except for us immortals, who have to live with our shame, which is worse?\" \nDialogue 18.\n Artemis: \n\"Those wretched things harassing you throughout that Underworld just won't give up, will they? Well, just keep killing them, I guess!\" \nDialogue 19.\n Artemis: \n\"Need a hunting partner, Zagreus? Not that I'm able to join you myself down there, or even hear you respond for that matter, but, anyway, here.\" \nDialogue 20.\n Artemis: \n\"Need a hunting partner, Zagreus? Not that I'm able to join you myself down there, or even hear you respond for that matter, but, anyway, here.\" \nImproved Relationship Lines.\nDialogue 01.\n Artemis: \n\"Zagreus, it's me! I'm here to join the hunt with you again. Let's show them what we can do.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Artemis: \n\"Hello again, you ready for this hunt? Me, I've been looking forward since last time, so, let's get on with it.\" \nAbout Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Artemis: \n\"Your name, it means great hunter, Zagreus! I guess your mother Nyx must have expected someday that you'd pick up a few pointers from myself!\" \n&lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt;.\n Artemis: \n\"That Fury down in Tartarus has been a real problem, hasn't she. I see the huntress instinct in her. She thinks she knows your weaknesses. Don't let yourself become predictable.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Artemis: \n\"Hey, I once heard Lord Hades has in his employ the greatest hero of the Trojan War, you happen to know anything about that? I'm kind of a fan. You see Achilles, tell him he's the best for me!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Artemis: \n\"So, I have heard that Achilles, himself, taught you how to fight! No wonder you can hold your own down there, that is amazing...! You be sure to honor him from time to time, got it?\" \n&lt;a href=\"Callisto\"&gt;Callisto&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n\"Not everybody on Olympus is a total disappointment, Zagreus. Why, someday maybe you could meet Callisto, she goes hunting with me all the time! Bet you don't see many woodland nymphs down there.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Artemis: \n\"Hey Zagreus, that Nectar you sent? Callisto and the nymphs and I, we popped it open recently, and it was really good! Had us positively frolicking about. So, thanks!\" \nDialogue 03.\n Artemis: \n\"You must have a friend or two, don't you? It's hard being alone all of the time. At least I have Callisto and the other nymphs, and... I have you! A distant friend is still a friend, isn't that right?\" \nDialogue 04.\n\"Hope you don't mind, I told Callisto all about you recently! Don't worry, I was quite discreet about it, the two of us were on the hunt, not like I just shouted out your story from the mountaintops!\" \nDialogue 05.\n Artemis: \n\"Zagreus, if only you could turn yourself into a woodland creature and just fly or burrow out of there! My Callisto, she can turn into a bear, you ever seen those? Monstrous, furry things, quite huggable, if they don't kill you first!\" \nDialogue 06.\n Artemis: \n\"You've never even seen the woods, have you? I hope you do, someday. You could meet Callisto and the others! It's quite beautiful, and green, and calm, it's... anyway.\"\nDialogue 07.\n Artemis: \n\"Don't know what it is about you, Zagreus, but I feel like I can be me with you, you know? Maybe it's that you don't constantly talk over me like everybody else, besides Callisto and the nymphs I guess. Not that I can even hear you, but, you know what I mean, right?\" \n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Artemis: \n\"Ah, good old Father Zeus, he must have blessed you with his lightning bolts, did he? Always looking out for everyone.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;.\n Artemis: \n\"So Aphrodite reached you first, did she? Sounds exactly like something she'd do. She has a knack for trouble. So, let's just stay focused, here!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;.\n Artemis: \n\"You're pretty close with Ares, aren't you? And here they said it couldn't be done. If I were you I'd watch myself with him.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Artemis: \n\"That lush and lecher, Dionysus, counts you as a friend? I'm hoping that there must be some mistake, yeah, Zagreus?\" \n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;.\n Artemis: \n\"You seem particularly light on your feet, there, Zagreus. I'd figure Hermes, himself, was speeding you along, except I've not seen him about in... been a while, really.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;.\n Artemis: \n\"Uncle Poseidon blessed you, didn't he. To think that big, fat oaf is your own father's brother. I'm told to be respectful near him, but it's hard.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;.\n Artemis: \n\"So even Demeter's become involved in this! Didn't think she would. Though you'll be glad she did! Provided you stay on her warm and fuzzy side, of course. Working on that, myself!\" \nWith Other Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Artemis: \n\"Hey, \"uh\", Zagreus! There's something I've been wondering, and don't take this the wrong way or anything, OK? Oh, no. It's her.\"\n Aphrodite: \n\"Why, Artemis, you're absolutely tongue-tied! Due to our little godling in the Underworld, or a little due to me? \"Hm-hm\", you shall figure it all out I'm sure!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Aphrodite: \n\"Oh dearest! I have brought you keen-eyed Artemis, who, in her focus on the hunt, has not developed social graces suitable enough to come to you herself!\"\n Artemis: \n\"Social graces, she says! Going about like \"that\"! I'm sure you know that I can find you when it's necessary, Zagreus. Though, how to get away from Aphrodite, I have no idea.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Artemis: \n\"\"Erm\", Zagreus, despite my hunter's instincts here, it seems I was unable to elude Aphrodite in this particular case, who insisted that we present ourselves to you at the same time, for whatever reason...\"\n Aphrodite: \n\"Oh, come now, Artemis! I'm sure you're very capable of hiding from a common beast, but I can see you plain. Why not be honest with yourself, next time?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Athena: \n\"If you've a moment, Zagreus? One of my relatives has claimed that I usurp your time. So I invited her to contact you.\" \n Artemis: \n\"Um, hello, Zagreus... Athena here is grandstanding or trying to prove a point, or something. I don't know. Anyway, nice talking to you.\" \n Athena: \n\"Well, I suppose that's settled, then. I am afraid such interactions aren't uncommon here amongst my family; but what's a family without flaws?\" \n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Artemis: \n\"You know my father and my uncle, by now, right, Zagreus? I don't know which of them is worse. \"Uh\", I mean... superior! Superior, despite technically spending most of his time in the seas, beneath Olympus, isn't that right, Uncle?\" \n Poseidon: \n\"Oh, Artemis, you needn't boast to little Hades there on my account! Besides! Whether you're in the sea, above it, or beneath, makes little difference to your measure as a god! You two are young as yet! Keep at it, and you'll soon be practically as great as I!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Poseidon: \n\"The thing about me, Nephew, is I get along with everybody, here! A skill apparently that's rather rare! Take my niece Artemis, for instance! Can't ever take a simple jest, at all! You won't easily attract a mate with such a sour look about you, girl!\" \n Artemis: \n\"Oh, and wouldn't that be such a pity, Uncle Poseidon. I wonder what could be the cause of this sour look that I perpetually have up here? Maybe Zagreus knows.\" \n Poseidon: \n\"\"Hahaha\"! See exactly what I mean, Nephew?\" \n&lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Artemis: \n\"Zagreus, I wish we all could hear you so that good Lord Ares here might be persuaded that my powers are entirely for different purposes than his!\" \n Ares: \n\"Perhaps our skillsets once were meant for different purposes, dear Artemis; but who are we to doubt the end result? Observe what shall transpire once we grant our kin our combined might.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Artemis: \n\"Zagreus, I was just hoping for a little privacy before this hunt, which is consistently my preference here, except, you see, Lord Ares always seems to come sniffing about, first sign of any hunting instruments!\" \n Ares: \n\"Why, my dear Artemis, the hunt is but a prelude to a war, is that not so? For if all mortalkind knew naught of hunting, why, they would not be nearly so adept at killing one another.\" \n Artemis: \n\"Look, Lord Ares, if I lend you better marksmanship ability, you think that you could bother someone else?\" \n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Artemis: \n\"Oh, hi there, Zagreus, I was just failing to persuade the Lady Demeter to ease up off the snowy stretch that we've been having for a while. Some of the mortals are quite weary of it now, and it sure doesn't make the hunting any easier!\" \n Demeter: \n\"The mortals are resourceful, Artemis. Their one redeeming quality, perhaps! They'll find a way through our long winter here. They ought to, since they brought it on themselves.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Demeter: \n\"Why, Zagreus, my gentle Artemis here was just saying how concerned she was for your predicament! I'm sure she'd like it if we both could help you in this case.\" \n Artemis: \n\"Concerned? I don't see anyone concerned, you have this, Zagreus! You don't need anybody's help, and you can get through this all on your own, though just in case, and I mean just in case! Um, here.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Artemis: \n\"Oh, great, it's you, Zagreus! Here, let me offer you some fine new Boons, as well as Lord Dionysus here, who I am sure would love to talk your ear off just as much as mine!\" \n Dionysus: \n\"\"Eh\", tells me I'm being awful loud, and to back off, all sorts of nasty stuff like that, what can you do, though, right?\" \nDialogue 02.\n Dionysus: \n\"Zag, man, I was just attempting here to get our good friend Artemis to finally make an appearance at one of my feasts, it's just... wouldn't you know, she's all preoccupied, something about a hunt?\" \n Artemis: \n\"That's right, Lord Dionysus, a \"hunt\"! Which requires lots and lots of \"total quiet\", and clear-minded focus. So, if you'll excuse me?\" \n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Artemis: \n\"\"Tsk\", \"um\", Zagreus... rather than greet you as I normally would do, instead, allow me to present you my illustrious, kind, generous lord father, your greatest Uncle Zeus!\" \n Zeus: \n\"\"Erm\", thank you for the introduction, Daughter! Now, you run along, go frolic with your nymphs, or something! Leave me to assist my nephew, here. Bestow on him your faint blessing, if you must.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus: \n\"Now, Zagreus, once you arrive, we'll have to find for you a suitable mate, won't we? Fine young man such as yourself! Normally, there's much to choose from around here, with some exceptions, of course... such as my cunning daughter, Artemis. Willfully uninclined to take a mate, at all!\" \n Artemis: \n\"Yes, Zagreus, in spite of all these perfect, chiseled prospects everywhere about, yearning to marry or embarrass me, for some reason, I prefer to spend my time mostly alone or with my nymph friends in the woods!\" \nBeing Invited to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt; (Pre-Epilogue).\n Zagreus: \n\"Found you, Huntress, here. In the name of Hades! Olympus, this is an official message! Especially for you, Lady Artemis!\" \n Artemis: \n\"Some kind of special message for me...! Oh, looks like there's one for everybody on Olympus, then. Felt rather special for a moment, there! And now you're making me check in with all the others. Great!\" \nPost-Epilogue Dialogue.\n Artemis: \n\"Have to say, I had a pretty decent time with everybody at our little visit recently! Met you, Uncle Hades, even great Achilles! Still don't quite appreciate you tricking us, but \"eh\"! I can get over it eventually. Anyway, you still could use assistance from me, right?\"\nMiscellaneous Conversations.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; Clearing a Run.\n Artemis: \n\"Hey, hold a moment, Zagreus, I could have sworn... you were so close, before, but now you're back? Ah, must have tripped up just when victory was close at hand, it happens all the time. We'll get you out of there, you'll see!\" \nBuying Boon at &lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;'s Shop.\nDialogue 01.\n Artemis: \n\"You know, one thing I'll say for Charon there? He doesn't talk too much. And since neither do you, I'm letting you have this.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Artemis: \n\"I guess this means you must have paid the boatman's ransom here, and whatever price he charged you, it was worth it.\" \nDialogue 03.\n Artemis: \n\"Even there in your Underworld, it seems quality hunting gear doesn't come cheap, apparently!\" \nDialogue 04.\n Artemis: \n\"You hunted down a real bargain there in Charon's shop, though how about we try a slightly bigger deal on for size right now?\"\nHigh Affinity Dialogue.\nDialogue 01.\n Artemis: \n\"I think you might enjoy it on Olympus, there's... a lot of feasting here, I guess, and the air is cool and crisp, and it's much brighter than it is down there. Sounds like a dream, right?\" \nDialogue 02.\n Artemis: \n\"I hope that once you make it to Olympus we'll go hunting sometime, you and I, you know? I like being on my own and all, but it's been nice, talking to you like this.\" \nDialogue 03.\n Artemis: \n\"I grow so tired of the others here, you know? Much rather be out with the woodland nymphs than with these gods upon this mountaintop. You must know what it's like.\"\nPost-Flashback Dialogue.\n Artemis: \n\"Living on Olympus here, I'm surrounded by my family, but I always felt alone. I know that's not the same as your experience, but, I'm just saying I relate to what you're going through.\" \nAbout Legendary Boon.\nDialogue 01.\n Artemis: \n\"All right, get ready for this, Zagreus, because I seldom share the greatest of my hunting secrets like I am about to.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Artemis: \n\"All right, no need to keep on toying with your prey. Here comes one of my finest blessings, \"now\"!\" \nDialogue 03.\n Artemis: \n\"I don't reveal my greatest hunting techniques for just anybody, Zagreus, so you better appreciate what you're about to get, and use it to go far!\" \nDialogue 04.\n Artemis: \n\"How about we not take any chances this time, Zagreus? So here, this is the best I've got. You better not waste it!\" \nAbout Backstory.\nDialogue 01.\n Artemis: \n\"Something's troubled me a little, about you. You fight so desperately. At first I thought you simply lacked in patience. But now I see it's urgency that drives you. What is it that you're after, really...?\" \nAbout Run Progress.\nDialogue 01.\n Artemis: \n\"Let's see. You blundered headlong into danger for the past six chambers or more. And you made such a racket I could almost hear it from Olympus. I have to say, your hunting skills are rather unconventional.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Artemis: \n\"I'm with you every step till you arrive here, Zagreus. Then I will probably ignore you like the rest. Just warning you ahead of time, all right?\" \nAbout &lt;a href=\"Gigantic%20Vermin\"&gt;Vermin&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Artemis: \n\"Say, were you hunting vermin near the surface lately, Zagreus? That's practically just like the real thing! It must have been a thrill!\" \nDialogue 02.\n Artemis: \n\"You've become a right accomplished vermin hunter, Zagreus! Maybe you'll get to use those skills against worthier creatures soon enough.\"\nAbout The &lt;a href=\"Heart-Seeking%20Bow\"&gt;Coronacht&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01 (&lt;a href=\"Heart-Seeking%20Bow%23Aspects\"&gt;Aspect of Rama&lt;/a&gt;).\n Artemis: \n\"Um, Zagreus, did you attempt to chat with Coronacht just yet? Remember, tell the bow \"I see you drawn in the arms of the seventh avatar! \"Something good's supposed to happen if you do, some divine archer-person's aspect I should think? You going to try it soon, or not?\" \nDialogue 02 (&lt;a href=\"Heart-Seeking%20Bow%23Aspects\"&gt;Aspect of Rama&lt;/a&gt;).\n Artemis: \n\"Hey, look at that! The message must have worked! Practically can see that shiny bow from here! I've never wielded Coronacht myself, at least not yet. Though if the Fates are sending visions to me of its past or future bearers, why, I guess I'm bound to get my shot eventually!\" \nDialogue 03 (Revealing &lt;a href=\"Heart-Seeking%20Bow%23Aspects\"&gt;Aspect of Rama&lt;/a&gt;).\n Artemis: \n\"Now listen, Zagreus, admittedly this is a little strange, even from me. I have a message for your bow! That's right, just go on up to Coronacht next time, and tell it with a firm, commanding voice, \"I see you drawn in the arms of the seventh avatar! \"Let me know how it goes, OK?\" \nDialogue 04 (&lt;a href=\"Heart-Seeking%20Bow%23Aspects\"&gt;Aspect of Chiron&lt;/a&gt;).\n Artemis: \n\"That's not the Coronacht I know, isn't that... Chiron the centaur's bow? So that was Coronacht, as well? Seems every decent bow was just a version of that thing! Except for mine, of course.\" \nDialogue 05 (&lt;a href=\"Heart-Seeking%20Bow%23Aspects\"&gt;Aspect of Hera&lt;/a&gt;).\n Artemis: \n\"Say, that's the bow Stepmother Hera herself once wielded, isn't it? Her aspect of Coronacht! I'd know it from the... frankly rather sinister skulls all over it. It's very Hera, trust me.\" \nDialogue 06 (In General).\n Artemis: \n\"Hey, how'd you get your hands on a nice bow like that? You take good care of Coronacht for me, so I can try it too once you're up here.\" \nDialogue 07 (In General).\n Artemis: \n\"Have to admit, you're very capable with Coronacht. Now I can hit a bull's eye in my sleep, but you'll be right there with me if I don't keep practicing I think!\" \nAbout The &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Fists\"&gt;Twin Fists&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Artemis: \n\"When did you get your hands on Malphon, the Twin Fists? Hands \"in\", I ought to say! I heard that one time, Demeter, she smacked her father right square in the face with those! Bet you can probably relate.\" \nAbout The &lt;a href=\"Adamant%20Rail\"&gt;Adamant Rail&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Artemis: \n\"Well, look at you, with Exagryph, the Rail of Adamant! Seems much too noisy-complicated as a hunting weapon when you could just use a nice quiet bow, but hey, to each her own.\" \nGifts.\n&lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Lady Artemis, I hope that you'll accept this offering, for all your kindness and support.\" \n Artemis: \n\"Hey thank you for this, really. And, I've just the thing to offer in return. It's just a gift, OK?\" \n\"Artemis gives &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Adamant%20Arrowhead\"&gt;Adamant Arrowhead&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Lady Artemis, you honor me.\"\n2nd Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"My lady Artemis! This is nothing, next to all your grace and favor.\" \n Artemis: \n\"Hey wait, this is an offering, for me? I, \"oh\", that's very kind, though, let's get back to hunting, now, OK?\" \n3rd Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Lady Artemis! I am indebted to you, for the strength and cunning you have given me.\" \n Artemis: \n\"Look, Zagreus, I don't know what to say, except for... thanks!\" \n4th Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"My lady Artemis, your favor's been invaluable to me. No finer huntress ever walked the surface of the earth, or underneath.\" \n Artemis: \n\"You're being very nice to me, and that makes me suspicious, understand? So, you want more of that... you keep this up.\" \n5th Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"At the risk of incurring your wrath, Lady Artemis, I hope you will accept this from me, and see that my gratitude for all you have done for me is genuine.\" \n Artemis: \n\"What do you know, another gift of Nectar, that's... quite thoughtful of you, Zagreus! Normally don't care much for the stuff, but, every now and then, I mean... why not?\" \n6th Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"In your honor, Lady Artemis! Your mighty blessings have helped me through so many trials now, and I always welcome your level-headed presence here.\" \n Artemis: \n\"Look, I like being worshiped just as much as anybody, Zagreus, though bear in mind that you can always leave the worship of me to the forest nymphs, all right?\" \n&lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"I know you have no shortage of Ambrosia on Olympus, Lady Artemis, but I imagine it's less often that the stuff go all the way from there to here, and back. What can I say? You make me proud to be a member of this family.\" \n Artemis: \n\"I never felt like I could be myself with everybody on this mountaintop, you know? So much posturing, and bickering, and... I just head out to the woods most of the time. Maybe you understand me better than the rest, I've no idea still. But I appreciate you've made attempts to try.\" "}

Look at you, on your great hunt! Not the ideal circumstances but you've finally begun. Know that the family has your back, surprised as they are about this.\n Melino\u00eb : No shortage lately of surprises on Olympus or below. It's good to see you again, Artemis. But, I must be off. Time's against us, and all that.\n Artemis : Time's an old fool to busy besieging the mountain of the gods to sense the threat headed his way. Go get him.\nDialogue 02.\n Artemis : \"Hey Melino\u00eb, I just wrapped a debrief here with Sister &lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt;. This place has changed a \"lot\" since last I checked!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"Hi Artemis, welcome! We've had to scramble a bit to make ready for everything. Can I show you around? Have you said hi to &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n Artemis : \"Oh, \"no\", I have to go. Olympus needs me back up top, at least a little while. Maybe next time, all right?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"I hear you. Bye for now.\"\nKeepsake Dialogue (&lt;a href=\"White%20Antler\"&gt;White Antler&lt;/a&gt;).\n Artemis : \"Brought the White Antler with you just in case! The stag who gave it up, it was his time. And I vowed to him I'd make it quick. His Shade and I, we still commune every so often!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"Artemis, your tales have this remarkable capacity to warm the heart and yet disturb the mind. In case you ever need a calling other than the hunt.\"\n Artemis : \"If none of this works out, I was thinking \"songs\" and \"music-making?\" If Apollo can do it, so can \"I.\" Though we've not tired of the hunter's life just yet.\"\nAbouth the Scenery.\n&lt;a href=\"Erebus\"&gt;Erebus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Artemis : \"Poor wretches, left to linger here. Could be relaxing in Elysium, or Asphodel at least. No wonder they're upset.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"Chronos claimed it was an act of magnanimity, unsealing the Underworld gates, letting the dead roam free. This can't possibly be better than when my father ruled.\"\n Artemis : \"Hey, at least it means I can set foot in these parts without inciting some huge territorial dispute! Setting aside the fact that we're already in the middle of one.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Oceanus\"&gt;Oceanus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Artemis : \"Fine mess we made! Not many hiding-places here compared to Erebus. Might be the end of the line for me... I'm a huntress, not a fisher.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"Fishing is a form of hunting, isn't it? Anyway I appreciate the backup, and understand if you're now at the limit of your range. Olympus probably expects you back.\"\n Artemis : \"They'll want to hear from me! About the situation, and about {#Emph}you{#Prev}, too. You know they still take me and Hermes for their spies? Although, we do tell them a lot...\"\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Artemis : \"You made it quite a ways up on the surface recently, Sister Selene said. Did it live up to all your hopes and dreams?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"I tend to have a lot of nightmares, and it did live up to those. The dead are left to linger there. They should be safely in the Underworld!\"\n Artemis : \"Well, Chronos evidently has other ideas for how things should be governed. I know your main objective is below, though... thank you for any aid you can provide up top.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Artemis : \"So much for visiting the surface, huh? Not seen a trace of you up there! Don't feel bad. You have nice woods here, too!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"I'm not supposed to be up there... could hardly breathe. But there might be something I can do. Hermes wouldn't have asked me to go if it wasn't important.\"\n Artemis : \"No, I guess not. I'd offer to escort you though Olympus wants me to stay out of sight. And I won't bother saying not to push yourself too hard...\"\n&lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Ephyra\"&gt;City of Ephyra&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Artemis : \"Look at \"you\", Sister! Your brother once had us all convinced he was trying to fight his way to Olympus. Now none of us can believe you're trying to do it for real.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"I've known Hermes about as long as you, and can count the number of favors he's asked of me on one hand. Besides, I could use the change of scenery.\"\n Artemis : \"Then by all means! What a time, that you're on your way up to the mountain while I'm on my way down to the Underworld. At least we crossed paths!\"\nDialogue 02 (loose dialogue in the files).\n Melino\u00eb : \"Hermes wouldn't have asked me to go if it wasn't important. Besides, I could use the change of scenery.\"\nMiscellaneous Conversations.\nAbout Mission.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \"Why has Olympus sent you all the way out here, anyway? I thought you'd have gone back by now. You're always welcome in the Crossroads!\"\n Artemis : \"Appreciate it, Sister, and I might stop by, but... I don't mind the woods. As for why I'm all the way out here, mostly to spy on you! Olympus likes to be informed.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"I'm certain that they do. Do you ever slip up with them? By now the other gods must have their suspicions about you and Hermes.\"\n Artemis : \"Depends on who you're talking about I guess, but for the most part they just think we're young and flighty. But we're the best they've got.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \"So when you're not aiding me in my repeated failures, what else have you been up to, Artemis? Some special quarry you're after?\"\n Artemis : \"There might be. Olympus has been shaking, for reasons unknown. Sister Selene asked that I look into it. Surely it's nothing, right?\"\nAbout The &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Sisters\"&gt;Silver Sisters&lt;/a&gt;.\n Artemis : \"When I became one of the Silver Sisters, I figured all we'd really do was stalk in shadows, make occasional reports... but this is a full-on \"worst-case scenario!\"\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"You sound excited rather than dismayed. You must have known it'd come to this eventually. Not like Headmistress would band us together just for ceremony's sake.\"\n Artemis : \"No, I guess you're right. Still, we've been together biding our time for so long... I got to thinking we might never get the opportunity to strike. Yet here we are!\"\nAbout Family.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \"You've been so far from home for so long. Don't you miss being on Olympus? If not now, then... back before the Titan's siege?\"\n Artemis : \"What, you mean being with my father and stepmother, my perfect twin brother, and all the rest? Just because I'm willing to aid them doesn't mean I'm willing to live with them again.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Artemis : \"So what do you think of the family? Most of them are stuck on their mountaintop, though... you've seen what they're like.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"Oh they don't seem so bad! Especially things being as they are. But you can't stand any of them...\"\n Artemis : \"Hey I wouldn't go \"that\" far! Though, yes, they can get under my skin. They're going to owe us \"big\" once all of this is over.\"\nAbout the &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Blades\"&gt;Sister Blades&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Artemis : \"Those blades of yours doing you any good? Let me know if you need any, \"erm... pointers...?\"\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"The Sister Blades are almost like having you by my side in every fight. Though, you can shoot a lot farther than I can throw...\"\n Artemis : \"\"Oh\", don't be so hard on yourself, I can shoot farther than anybody! Especially Apollo. Well, just keep going for their vitals, and you'll be fine.\"\nDialogue 02 (Aspect of Artemis).\n Artemis : \"Hey, I recognize those blades! Didn't want to let on before, but... now I guess you know. You best be taking care of them! \"\n Melino\u00eb : \"Not to worry. I am, I swear! So, \"you\" were the bearer of the Sister Blades yourself? Did you have to give them up because of me...?\"\n Artemis : \"I gave them up because I did what needed to be done. Hecate so likes her little tests. Anyway I'm glad to see old Lim and Oros in good hands.\"\nAbout the Moon.\n Artemis : \"A full moon... Sister Selene's power at its peak. On nights like this, I truly feel my immortality. May our combined strength be enough.\"\nExtended Send-off.\n Melino\u00eb : \"Hey, Artemis. Is everything all right?\"\n Artemis : \"So much to talk about, so little time, Sister. I'm needed elsewhere, but I wanted to make sure to send you off.\"\nAbout Progress.\n Melino\u00eb : \"Any progress yet with your investigation?\"\n Artemis : \"Not near as much as I'd like. Here, let me give you a boost. Maybe you'll get somewhere even if I don't.\"\nAbout Retrying.\n Melino\u00eb : \"You've likely heard I didn't get there, Artemis. Didn't even come close.\"\n Artemis : \"Sister, I have \"every\" faith in you, but not even \"I\" believed you were going to vanquish Chronos straightaway. Let's be a little realistic here?\"\nAbout Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;.\n Artemis : \"Has my little brother lived up to his shining reputation so far? At least he did his part. Soon as I told him about you, sure enough he was plenty eager to let all Olympus know.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"Apollo was very kind. Though, easy for me to say, I'm not his twin. What'd you tell him anyway?\"\n Artemis : \"Only the truth! That I ran into the reclusive Witch of the Crossroads while scouting out our foe... and that she introduced me to a secret \"Titan killer\" she's been training up.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"You just didn't tell him how long ago that was. So now they really think this long-lost relative of theirs is going to find Chronos and slay him?\"\n Artemis : \"Oh, they think you don't stand a chance! But they don't have a lot of options, so... they'll support you anyway, especially since you're family and all. And you know \"I\" will.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt;.\n Artemis : \"You bested Sister Hecate! She told me so herself, and with dare-I-say more than a hint of pride. Though, she's intent on testing you still?\" \n Melino\u00eb : \"She always said I can't beat Chronos if I can't beat her. And so we spar. I think she's gone easy on me, to boost my confidence.\"\n Artemis : \"Well, I can plainly see she failed. Gone \"easy?\" If there's one thing the Witch of the Crossroads hasn't ever done, it's that.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Selene\"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Artemis : \"I can often depend on Sister Selene's light to guide me on my hunts. But where you're going, she can't follow, can she? Nor can I.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"And Headmistress Hecate is needed at the Crossroads. I alone have the authority to enter the House of Hades. If I can make it there.\"\n Artemis : \"Hey, what do you mean \"if?\" It's a matter of \"when\", as far as I'm concerned. I'm thinking maybe very \"soon\", in fact.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Artemis : \"I can often depend on Sister Selene's light to guide me on my hunts. But where you're going, she can't follow easily, can she? Nor can I.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"Sister Selene has her ways, though I know it's difficult for her, and Headmistress is needed at the Crossroads. I alone have the authority to enter the House of Hades. But I'd have never gotten there without you all.\"\n Artemis : \"Could \"really\" use a proper hunting party for this one! Fortunately it's kind of our thing as Silver Sisters to not have to be in the same place at the same time.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;.\n Artemis : \"Hermes finally got a hold of you, did he? Sounds like things have really taken a turn on Olympus. Glad I'm not there!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"Artemis, how can you say that? It's your home. I'm going to see if I can head up there and lend a hand.\"\n Artemis : \"Is that even possible for you, born of the Underworld and all that? Then again, you're a witch! Must have a remedy for everything!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \"You haven't seen Nemesis tonight, have you? Not that she should be anywhere near here, as opposed to keeping watch over the gateways at the Crossroads.\"\n Artemis : \"I haven't seen her, no. But I was tracking her! Those footprints are only slightly harder to spot than \"she \" is. She's not supposed to be out here, is she...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"...That she is not. She's just trying to make herself useful, I get it. And the Fates themselves know that I probably could use the help. Though, how have you two been?\"\n Artemis : \"We each need company, we each need solitude, the same old thing. She's frustrated, which can go a couple of ways depending on the night. Anyway, she's a big girl!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Fates\"&gt;The Fates&lt;/a&gt;.\n Artemis : \"It's really true about the Fates, that Chronos somehow got to them? Doesn't want to take any chances anymore. Did the Fates prophesize their own captivity...?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"How can you be so casual about this? If the Fates themselves couldn't stop Chronos, we won't have an easy time! We're beholden to chance ourselves.\"\n Artemis : \"So what if we are! You know not even \"I\"always hit my mark. What do I do if I miss? \"I take another shot.\"The greater the skill, the less is up to chance.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Artemis : \"It's strange, isn't it? He's our own grandfather... Chronos, I mean. But, I feel no connection to him at all! I just want him gone.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"Doesn't matter who he is; he's a threat. We're the Silver Sisters. We'll \"make\" him gone. For the sake of the realms.\"\n Artemis : \"Strictly business then, is it? Even still, funny how it falls on \"us\" to settle the older generation's scores.\"\nDialogue 02 (Lost Battle).\n Artemis : \"Got all the way down to the House of Hades, so I heard. Must be nice having fated authority over the lowest reaches of the Underworld... unless you're Chronos.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"He was most certainly annoyed. Wields a scythe that's twice my height, surrounds himself with feral Satyr-worshipers ready to die for him. I'm not surprised it once took both our fathers and more to bring him down.\"\n Artemis : \"No reason to compare yourself. They're high and mighty lords of the heavens and the Underworld, but they fought Chronos by necessity. You were trained to do \"precisely this.\"\"\nDialogue 03 (Won Battle).\n Artemis : \"You found Chronos... sank your fangs into his throat. Sister Hecate gave me the gist. How'd you do it...? Found some exploitable weakness, something like that?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"Mostly I just kept evading a lot. He's very powerful, but must have underestimated my ability to resist his tricks.\"\n Artemis : \"He won't always underestimate you, though. Must have his vulnerabilities. \"The old are seldom wise, and often weak\", right? He's bloodied... go for the kill.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Moros\"&gt;Moros&lt;/a&gt;.\n Artemis : \"Hey, is it really true Moros himself showed up at your Crossroads because you \"summoned\" him? As in, you \"literally invited Doom...?\"\"\n Melino\u00eb : It doesn't seem the wisest course when you put it that way. Chronos once was brought low by a prophecy of the Three Fates. I felt they might be willing to intervene again.\"\n Artemis : \"And they did so by sending you the embodiment of misfortune and unforeseen consequences. Well if that's what the Fates have in store, you're going to need \"this.\"\"\n&lt;a href=\"Polyphemus\"&gt;Polyphemus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Artemis : \"That massive Cyclops Polyphemus... saw him fast asleep the other night! Then \"you\" were able to sneak up and incapacitate him, just like \"that!\" I stay far downwind of him, myself.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"I'm tempted to just smile and nod through this one, Artemis, but my dealings with the Cyclops haven't involved much stealth. Though at least I can get past him, at this point.\"\n Artemis : \"And how do you get through the Rift beyond the docks, you \"swim?\" You still like doing things the hard way. The \"only\" way!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt;.\n Artemis : \"You probably know \"Eris\" has been buzzing around Olympus recently? One good lightning bolt from Father Zeus would normally take \"care\" of that, but... he's been occupied.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"One good lightning bolt, how about one good arrow? We'd be saved a lot of trouble if Eris were to be plucked from the sky one of these nights.\"\n Artemis : \"I'd gladly volunteer, it's just that Father has everything \"well under control.\" Says I'm needed way out here instead. But if I do spot the wings of Strife... they're going down.\"\nGifts.\n&lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \"It's been a pleasure to have worked more closely with you, Sister Artemis. This is hardly worth the gift of impeccable precision, though I wanted you to have it.\"\n Artemis : \"Doing the old traditions now, are we? Well sure, then I accept your offering, Sister Melino\u00eb. And I've an offering for \"you\", in kind!\"\n\"Artemis gives &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"White%20Antler\"&gt;White Antler&lt;/a&gt;.'\n Melino\u00eb : \"Truly? You're the best.\"\n2nd Time.\n Artemis : \"You do know we have \"barrels\" of this stuff up on Olympus, right? Used to, at least. Damn near forgotten what it tastes like, come to think...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"May the good memories come flooding back! Whenever you have the time for it, of course.\"\n3rd Time.\n Artemis : \"What's all this extra generosity from you lately? It's putting me on edge. Don't you go acting like this is goodbye...!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"It's merely that the arrow-riddled remnants of my foes give me occasion to reflect! I tell myself never to take my dear friends for granted.\"\n4th Time.\n Artemis : \"I can't exactly drink this on the hunt, you know! But I can squirrel it away for safekeeping. Maybe once all this is settled, we can share a bottle and get properly caught up.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"Or, failing that, we could always keep on teaming against vengeful spirits and the like! Although it's nice to keep the possibility in mind.\"\n5th Time.\n Artemis : \"Hey, thank you! Sure enough, Olympus started running a little low on this stuff. I'll be sure to lord it over the others, long as you don't mind me exploiting your good graces.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"I don't recall anything about exploiting one another's good graces in the bylaws of the Silver Sisters, so you should be fine! May you enjoy it either way.\"\n6th Time.\n Artemis : \"...Hard making friends with goddesses, but I have what {#Emph}I {#Prev}need. We can be on our own without feeling alone, you know? I hope you know. That's how it is for me.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"I do know, and feel much the same. When we're not watching one another's backs, we have Selene and Headmistress watching over us. Still, it's always good to see you face-to-face.\"\n Artemis : \"You, too. Most of my family I can do without most of the time. You're an exception! We may not be sisters by blood, but... you'll always be Sister Melino\u00eb to me.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"Likewise, Sister Artemis.\""}
{"id": "2488", "revid": "47838920", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2488", "title": "Artemis/Relationships", "text": "Family.\nZeus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;: Artemis's father.&lt;br&gt;She strives to be an obedient daughter, going so far as to make a grand presentation for him, even though long speeches are not her strong suit. However, Zeus often responds with indirect criticisms, suggesting that he may not fully understand her. At the same time, Artemis feels that her father likes to invade her personal space and constantly leaving her red-faced in front of &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; with embarrassing paternal comments.\nShe kept &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;'s existence a secret from her family, especially her father, which shows their untrustworthy nature.\nApollo.\n&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;: Artemis's younger twin brother.&lt;br&gt;Artemis and Apollo share a bond as twin siblings. Artemis likes to affectionately refer to him as her \"little brother\". Despite being like night and day, Artemis entrusted Apollo firsthand with the revelation of Melino\u00eb's existence on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Olympus&lt;/a&gt;, a secret that her brother quickly spread. This indicates the great consideration that Artemis has for Apollo, despite not always trusting him, making him one of the few men, alongside Zagreus, with whom she shares a strong relationship. Melino\u00eb acknowledges that she lacks the twin connection to fully understand their twin bond.\nHera.\n&lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt;: Artemis' stepmother.&lt;br&gt;Likely out of loyalty for her biological mother Leto, Artemis prefers to keep her distance from her stepmother.\nAthena.\n&lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;: Artemis's half-sister.&lt;br&gt;Artemis comments to Zagreus that she's never sure if Athena is showing off or trying to prove something. Athena retorts, commenting that such interactions between the two are not uncommon for sisters; \"and what is a perfect family without routine fights?\"\nAphrodite.\n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;: The Goddess of Love and Beauty.&lt;br&gt;Artemis finds Aphrodite invasive, and Aphrodite knows that Artemis isn't honest with her feelings, and may also tease her for being nervous in Zagreus' presence. Though even Aphrodite acknowledges that this could also be due to her frequent night outings. She can be quite a hypocrite, claiming that Artemis is so focused on the hunt that she has forgotten to acquire \"social graces\". Artemis retorts that walking around naked is hardly a show of social graces.\nAres.\n&lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;: Artemis's half-brother.&lt;br&gt;In his Duo Benefit with Artemis, he is happy to try to work together, as he considers Hunting and War quite similar domains. Artemis finds her older half-brother's comments chilling, cringes and does not share the same feelings.\nHephaestus.\n&lt;a href=\"Hephaestus\"&gt;Hephaestus&lt;/a&gt;: Artemis's half-brother.&lt;br&gt;\nHermes.\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;: Artemis's half-brother.&lt;br&gt;She usually turns her back on him, not out of disdain, but because she is quiet and he is very talkative. Hermes considers Artemis a very cool distant big sister and comments on how skilled Artemis is, although he is faster, she is still very fast.\nThey both were key figures in Melino\u00eb's childhood and kept her existence a secret from the rest of their family. This shows that despite their opposite personalities, they trust each other.\nDionysus.\n&lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;: Artemis's half-brother.&lt;br&gt;He regards Artemis as a kind of hermit. Dionysus has tried more than once to include her in his usual feasts and revelries, but she cannot stand the noise. She disapproves of Dionysus' inconsequential lifestyle. In her dialogues with Zagreus, she warns him not to get involved with her partying half-brother.\nDemeter.\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;: Artemis's foster aunt.&lt;br&gt;Though they share similar views of Athena, they don't have the same assessment of mortals, Artemis complains how the snowy weather is making their hunts difficult. Demeter warns that humans are resourceful and deceitful and will nonetheless find a way to survive.\nHestia.\n&lt;a href=\"Hestia\"&gt;Hestia&lt;/a&gt;: Artemis's foster aunt.&lt;br&gt;\nPoseidon.\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;: Artemis's uncle.&lt;br&gt;Artemis seems to have a low opinion on her uncle, dodging him as much as she can, insulting him by calling him a big fat oaf, and wondering as to who is worst; him or her father Zeus. Because of this, she has been told to be more respectful around her uncle, something that she considers to be hard. Poseidon in turn, considers Artemis to be too stiff, unabled to take a simple jest and that her sour looks makes it harder for her to attract a potential mate. \nFriends.\nCallisto.\n&lt;a href=\"Callisto\"&gt;Callisto&lt;/a&gt;: Artemis's best friend.&lt;br&gt;Although Callisto does not appear in Hades, she is mentioned by Artemis many times. She will begin telling Zagreus stories of her adventures with Callisto, the forest nymph who can mysteriously transform into a bear. Artemis notes that she considers Callisto and the other nymphs her closest friends. Later, Artemis also tells Callisto about Zagreus' adventure. Eurydice points out that nymphs are often treated as lesser deities, so the fact that Artemis treats them as equals is quite telling for a goddess of high status.\nChthonic Gods.\nThe Gods of the Underworld.\nZagreus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;: Artemis's cousin.&lt;br&gt;In her relationship with Zagreus, she is the only one who refrains from using affectionate terms, addressing him solely by his name. He may perceive her as a distant role model, although deep down she experiences considerable nervousness and uncertainty in his presence. Artemis doesn't hesitate to reprimand him whenever he engages in actions that she disapproves of, such as succumbing to Dionysus' influence. However, if Zagreus manages to cultivate a stronger bond with her, she will reluctantly acknowledge, with a touch of disdain, that he holds a place among her closest confidants, although not a priority to her.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;, after Zagreus is captured by &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;, she grows relatively close to his younger sister, Melino\u00eb. Assuming the role of Melino\u00eb's protector, she assists her in the mission to defeat Chronos, serving as both a mentor and an older sister figure, a role that Zagreus couldn't fulfill.\nMelino\u00eb.\n&lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;: Artemis's cousin.&lt;br&gt;She was a key figure in Melino\u00eb's childhood, and alongside Hecate and Selene, they're part of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Sisters\"&gt;Silver Sisters&lt;/a&gt;. She kept her cousin's existence a secret from the rest of the family until it was deemed worthy of being known. Artemis will aid Melino\u00eb out in field whenever possible, and both can engage in conversations afterwards. She affectionately calls her cousin \"Sister Melino\u00eb\".\nHecate.\n&lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt;: Artemis's maternal cousin.&lt;br&gt;They both belong to the Silver Sisters, besides already having a familiar connection. Hecate allowed Artemis to take part in Melino\u00eb's childhood, showing great trust in her ability to keep it a secret.\nHades.\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;: Artemis's uncle.&lt;br&gt;Achilles believes that of all the Olympians, Hades would get along the best with Artemis, and indeed, the two have much in common. \nEven though Artemis doesn't spend as much time away from her Olympian relatives as her equally solitary uncle, it is also asserted that Hades approves of Artemis, as she doesn't care about being praised and is dedicated to her work, much like he is.\nIn the Epilogue she finally met her uncle and is excited, although she doesn't like him hiding many things, but she is willing to forget everything to maybe get to know each other better.\nNemesis.\n&lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;: Retribution Incarnate.&lt;br&gt;Artemis is the only Olympian who outright grants boons to Nemesis. They're familiar with one another, and share some similarities, like wanting to be left alone every now and again. It's implied their relationship is currently a little strained.\nUnderworld Residents.\nAchilles.\n&lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt;: The famed warrior hero of the Trojan War.&lt;br&gt;Artemis is a huge fangirl of Achilles. She admires his combat style and will recognize the Aspect of Achilles; she will talk excitedly about how many mortals have been \"completely slaughtered\" by him and will ask Zagreus to pass on her regards. If Zagreus comes into contact with her while using Coronacht, she will eagerly tell him to take it to Olympus so she can try it out.\nEurydice.\n&lt;a href=\"Eurydice\"&gt;Eurydice&lt;/a&gt;: A nymph musician.&lt;br&gt;Eurydice is surprised by the fact that Artemis, even though she is a goddess, sees the nymphs as equals.\nTitans.\nSelene.\n&lt;a href=\"Selene\"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt;: Moon Incarnate.&lt;br&gt;They both are part of the Silver Sisters, and Artemis says she can always count on Selene's light to guide her in her nocturnal hunts. \nChronos.\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;: Artemis's paternal grandfather.&lt;br&gt;Despite being her own grandfather, Artemis feels no connection to him and simply wants him gone."}

Travel between these islands is done via small bone rafts. Asphodel is the second biome &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; encounters during his escape attempts and is always 10 chambers long: beginning at Room 16 with an overlook of the region and ending at the 25th Chamber in the Stairway Chamber.\nSupposedly, the Asphodel Meadows once lived up to their name. They were verdant plains dotted with their namesake flowers in which the unremarkable dead - those who had earned neither punishment in Tartarus nor glory in &lt;a href=\"Elysium\"&gt;Elysium&lt;/a&gt; - roamed for eternity. At some point before the game's story, the fiery river overflowed, flooding the legendary meadows and reducing them to the magma-filled, barren hellscape seen in-game.\nTraps.\nSince Asphodel is a natural biome, traps are more natural hazards and environments. However, the explosive barrels from Tartarus return in Asphodel. These can only be triggered by Zagreus' attacks, and after a short delay, will detonate doing high damage to anything caught within the blast radius (but will do considerably less damage to Zagreus compared to enemies).\nIn Asphodel, the rivers of magma around the islands serve as the biome's main trap. After a brief delay while standing on magma, non-floating enemies will begin to take damage very rapidly, which increases the longer they stand in it. Zagreus will also take rapid damage in magma, starting at 1 damage per tick and increasing rapidly until death. Dashing or stepping off the magma resets the ticks back to 1. The magma also has a slowing effect on both Zagreus and enemies - though this can be easily countered with a Dash (for Zagreus) or cross-room leap (for enemies). Fireballs will sometimes be spewed out, covering parts of the islands in magma for limited amounts of time.\nAdditionally, after enough enemies have been killed in Asphodel chambers, smoke vents will open around the room. These occasionally create smoke which obscures the area around them and blurs the screen of the player should Zagreus step into the smoke. These traps do not affect enemies.\nUnique Chambers.\nAsphodel features a unique chamber with the soul &lt;a href=\"Eurydice\"&gt;Eurydice&lt;/a&gt;, who is encountered in her house singing and baking various desserts. When encountered, Eurydice will offer Zagreus a brief conversation, and then grant him one of three desserts to take with him.\nEurydice can only be encountered one time per run and is not guaranteed to be encountered. Zagreus cannot use Fated Authority on her chamber to swap it to a different reward.\nSince Eurydice's chamber features no combat, it will not count towards Encounters for Chaos boon debuffs (except Enshrouded), but it will count for Encounters for items from the Well of Charon (but only non-combat ones, like the HydraLite).\nMini-Boss Encounters.\nAsphodel features three separate mini boss encounters. Zagreus can encounter only one of them in a run. It is possible to encounter none of them, depending on the paths the player takes.\nThe rewards for each mini-boss encounters are a god boon of increased rarity. When Fated Authority is used on them, the god boon reward will change, but the room itself will not, and the mini boss will remain. Additionally, Fated Authority will not change which mini-boss room is encountered.\nEach room is marked with an elite skull beneath the offered god boon. There is no way to distinguish between the three encounters without entering one.\nThe first mini-boss encounter is the \"Barge of Death\" encounter. In it, Zagreus will be assaulted by three waves of various Elite Bloodless, Inferno Bombers, Slam Dancers, Burn Flingers, and Wave Makers. Additionally, these waves will be protected by 1-2 \"Dire\" Voidstones. The Voidstones in this encounter cannot be Elites. This encounter takes place on a large moving raft that travels over a large section of the river Phlegethon.\nThe second mini-boss encounter is the Megagorgon chamber. In it, Zagreus must fight both a Megagorgon and a Dire Skull-Crusher. The magma at the edges of the room more frequently spews fireballs onto its floor.\nThe third mini-boss encounter is the \"Witches Circle\" encounter. In it, Zagreus must fight against four Dire Spreaders. The chamber consists of a central island separated from four extant islands by a moat of magma. Two pillars offer cover in this chamber from the Spreaders' projectiles.\nBoss Encounters.\nAsphodel features only one final boss, the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Hydra\"&gt;Lernaean Bone Hydra&lt;/a&gt;. This boss will appear at Chamber 24. More details about this encounter can be found on its respective page.\nThe reward for this encounter is a &lt;a href=\"Diamond\"&gt;Diamond&lt;/a&gt; Bounty if it is the player's first victory against the Hydra, or if they meet the Target Heat from the &lt;a href=\"Pact%20of%20Punishment\"&gt;Pact of Punishment&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, it is a &lt;a href=\"Darkness\"&gt;Darkness&lt;/a&gt; drop. By default, this drop is 100 , and is affected by boons and bonus effects.\nOnce the Hydra is defeated, a raft will arrive in the top left quadrant of the room, which will escort the player to a Stairway chamber. This stairway leads to &lt;a href=\"Elysium\"&gt;Elysium&lt;/a&gt;, the third biome of the game.\nEnemies.\nThese are all the enemies that can be encountered in any other Asphodel chamber. These enemies can also appear as Elites, giving them armor and upgraded attacks."}

In life, Asterius was locked in a labyrinth by his step-father, &lt;a href=\"King%20Minos\"&gt;King Minos&lt;/a&gt;, only to eventually be slain by &lt;a href=\"Theseus\"&gt;Theseus&lt;/a&gt;. In death, the two are apparently comrades.\nAsterius is a potential mid-boss encounter in Elysium, as well as always appearing as the final boss of Elysium, alongside King Theseus in the Elysium Stadium.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nThe figure of the Minotaur was feared along the entire coast of Greece. Thrown into the Labyrinth against his will, the terrifying monster persona is actually a lie, as Asterius possesses a chivalrous and intelligent personality.\nHis formidable appearance doesn't reflect his true nature. Asterius is the complete opposite of his companion &lt;a href=\"Theseus\"&gt;Theseus&lt;/a&gt;; he is more sensible, he knows how to read him very well and prevents him from acting inappropriately. He remains calm, modest, rational, and emotionally balanced, knowing when to lose and not taking his fights personally like Theseus does.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; continues to invade &lt;a href=\"Elysium\"&gt;Elysium&lt;/a&gt;, he manages to make Asterius laugh with a joke, revealing a more reasonable side. The battles become more competitive, yet cordial and respectful. Zagreus invites Asterius to hang out and have a drink together, but Asterius declines due to work commitments.\nA learned and powerful warrior in his own right, Asterius and Theseus form an unbeatable team. Although he swears loyalty to Theseus, he often loses patience because of his lack of listening and carelessness in important matters. Asterius is noble and seems to have found redemption in him, although Theseus' incalculable actions often leave him exasperated with him. He appears to be the only one who can tolerate Theseus, as he is immensely grateful to him. After being defeated by Theseus, he became his vassal, sharing the Champion's title, and an unlikely friendship between the two was formed.\nPhysical description.\nHe and &lt;a href=\"Theseus\"&gt;Theseus&lt;/a&gt; wear matching outfits, and like Theseus, he wears a short chiton with a large belt around his waist. Asterius is a large, brown humanoid bull. Asterius has a crest with a tuft of hair, adorned with blue laurel wreaths around his massive horns that have magenta colors at the top, and he wields a huge battle axe. He will also switch his cloak for a suit of pure gold armor.\nHistory.\nPast.\nBorn out of &lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;'s punishment to &lt;a href=\"King%20Minos\"&gt;Minos&lt;/a&gt;, Asterius is the son of Queen Pasipha\u00eb and the Cretan bull. Although his mother cared for him for a while, as he grew, he came to be seen more and more as a beast and grew more ferocious, forcing Minos to order Daedalus to construct the famous labyrinth that housed him ever since.\nFollowing the defeat of Athens to Crete in a war, King Minos required that several Athenian youths be brought to Crete to feed the Minotaur. And it was like that for years. Until one time, a young &lt;a href=\"Theseus\"&gt;Theseus&lt;/a&gt; came among the youths with the intend to kill the Minotaur and save his people from this suffering. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Ariadne\"&gt;Ariadne&lt;/a&gt;, Asterius's half-sister, Theseus managed to find his way around the labyrinth and defeated him bare handed.\nFollowing his death, given his beastly nature, Asterius was sent to &lt;a href=\"Erebus\"&gt;Erebus&lt;/a&gt;. However, much time later, following Theseus death, the former King of Athens, using his influence, managed to convice &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; to have Asterius in &lt;a href=\"Elysium\"&gt;Elysium&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that he was his most formidable foe in life. The two have shared the title of Champion ever since.\nHades.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; can come across Asterius's solo arena and both engage in a fight. He will always find him in the stadium alongside Theseus, ready to stop him from advancing further.\nTaken notice of their disparing personalities, namely Asterius's much more approachable and noble aura in contrast to Theseus' boasting, Zagreus will often question why he stays with the King and offer to join him instead. Asterius will always refuse his offer, claiming loyalty to Theseus only since he saved him.\nEpilogue.\nAsterius, as well as Theseus, will keep trying to hold Zagreus from reaching the surface.\nAffinity.\nAsterius cannot be given &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt;.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\nMerchandise=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

He begins both fights with three abilities: Axe Combo, Leap Combo, and Bull Rush. When reduced to 50% max HP, Asterius enters his second phase, where he gains two additional abilities: Overhead Axe and Crescent Combo.\nWhen reduced to 50% max HP, Asterius will briefly become invulnerable, and taunt the player, then enter his second phase. When reduced to 20% max HP, he will become briefly invulnerable, and call off the fight, congratulating Zagreus for his victory, and leaving his arena to recover before the Elysium Stadium encounter. Despite this, it is possible to kill Asterius using damage over time effects that outlast the invulnerability: managing to do so will play his death animation and voice line, but has no effect on the Elysium Stadium encounter.\nElysium Stadium.\nAsterius' attack patterns do not change in the Elysium Stadium encounter.\nUnlike in his own arena, the pillars in the Elysium Stadium are unbreakable, meaning that Asterius will not do damage to himself when running into them.\nIf defeated as a mid-boss in the current run, Asterius will begin the Elysium Stadium encounter with 20% reduced health (11200 Health instead of 14000).\nWhile Asterius will still enter his second phase at 50% max HP as well as gain brief invulnerability, he must be killed in order to progress in the Elysium stadium encounter, instead of calling off the fight at 20% max HP.\nIf Theseus is killed before Asterius, Asterius will become enraged, moving and attacking at a faster rate. If Asterius is killed before Theseus, Theseus will lose access to his Charge attack with Asterius.\nExtreme Measures.\nWhen using Extreme Measures Level 3 from the Pact of Punishment, Asterius will be outfitted in a set of bronze power armor in both his own arena and in the Elysium Stadium.\nWhile in the bronze power armor, the fight with Asterius has notable changes:\nReward.\nWhen defeated in his mid-boss chamber, Asterius will leave the chamber, and Zagreus will be awarded with a god boon of increased rarity, based on the chamber preview when entering.\nWhen both Theseus and Asterius are defeated in the Elysium Stadium, Zagreus will be awarded with &lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt; if Bounty conditions are met. This means that it must either be Zagreus' first victory against them with a weapon, or the Target Heat must be met for that weapon.\nOtherwise, they will drop 120 &lt;a href=\"Darkness\"&gt;Darkness&lt;/a&gt;. (The Darkness reward is improved by Dark Thirst, &lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Ocean's Bounty&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;).\nBounties for Theseus and the Minotaur are tracked as a whole for the Stadium fight, and not individually. (This means defeating the Minotaur last at 0 Heat will provide a bounty, but a later defeat of Theseus last at 0 Heat with the same weapon will not provide a bounty, as the 0 Heat victory has already been completed with that weapon.)"}

Maybe the outcome will be the same, maybe it won't. We'll find out.\"\n \"- After unlocking the Aspect of Gilgamesh and encountering Asterius with the Claws of Enkidu.\" \n "}

Although Asterius is responsible for keeping Theseus in line, he is incredibly grateful and loyal to his companion. Theseus once killed Asterius in life and later rescued him from &lt;a href=\"Erebus\"&gt;Erebus&lt;/a&gt; in death, granting him a place in &lt;a href=\"Elysium\"&gt;Elysium&lt;/a&gt; and the title of Champion.

She offers &lt;a href=\"boons\"&gt;boons&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; that cause his abilities to &lt;a href=\"Gameplay%20mechanics\"&gt;Deflect&lt;/a&gt; enemy attacks. In addition, she also offers boons that reduce damage or increase other defensive options.\nAthena offers excellent defensive options with her boons, protecting you from damage with the ability to deflect enemy projectiles and melee attacks, as well as reduce the damage you will take in a run.\nHer signature &lt;a href=\"Status%20Curse\"&gt;Status Curse&lt;/a&gt; is Exposed, which causes enemies to take additional damage from behind. This stacks with Backstab bonuses offered by the &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20of%20Night\"&gt;Mirror of Night&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs her boon is the reward for clearing the very first room in a fresh save, she will always be the first of the Olympian gods to be encountered.\nAthena returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;\" and offers her boons to &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the first game, Athena appears in specific chambers in-person and can help clear enemies. She can be encountered on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Mount Olympus&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nStoic, gracious, and refined, Athena is the first deity contacted by &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt; and offers her help to Zagreus. As the goddess of wisdom and military strategy, Athena sincerely wishes for her cousin to escape his unjust imprisonment with an elaborate plan.\nAthena tends to be less personal with Zagreus compared to the other gods and does not share details of her personal life or interests, as her focus is always on helping Zagreus escape, and she is the only &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Olympian&lt;/a&gt; willing to help simply because it is the right thing to do. She genuinely respects her cousin as a member of her family.\nAthena certainly can be considered the favorite child of her father &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;. He constantly brags about her cunning, but Athena will deny any resemblance to him. On the other hand, she is equally willing to punish Zagreus for accepting another god's blessing instead of hers when given the choice. In fact, behind her image of a \"perfect\" and obedient daughter, calm and calculated, Athena can lose her composure when interacting with other gods, as is the case with &lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;, who are like water and oil.\nDespite the best intentions, comments from Olympians indicate that Athena is a kind of \"know-it-all,\" an \"unbearable genius\" who considers her ideas superior to others. &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt; remarks that she never knows for sure whether Athena is trying to prove something or show off. Other Olympian gods indicate that she is somewhat fawning and that her benevolence is just an act.\nIn fact, beneath all her apparent benevolence, Athena is far from as wise as one might expect from a goddess of wisdom, having her own hidden depths and may have made serious mistakes in her past. &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt; speculates that the true reason Athena is carrying everything on her shoulders and is so eager to help Zagreus escape the underworld is that she sees him as a form of personal redemption, viewing him \"as a tool with which her broken family can still be fixed\" and to correct the rift between Olympian and chthonic gods.\nPhysical description.\nAthena appears as an imposing warrior figure, tall and upright with a dark grey skin tone, posing like a statue, with lavender braided hair and matching eyes. She wears a radiant collection of golden armor with a Gorgon stamped on the hip and lightweight robes, crowned with a blue helmet with a horsehair crest. She holds an owl, her sacred animal, in one hand and is armed with her characteristic golden shield, with golden discs adorning her forehead, ears, and chest.\nIn Hades II, Athena's appearance varies slightly: she now wears a Corinthian style helmet that covers most of her face and her hair has been restyled to multiple thin braids instead of a single one; her armor is also different. Instead of an owl, she carries a spear, itself with said owl motif in turn, and her plain golden shield has been upgraded to resemble the &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Aegis&lt;/a&gt; while with the Aspect of Zeus, but with a Gorgon's face.\nHistory.\nHades.\nAthena is the one that &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt; contacts in order to have the &lt;a href=\"Olympians\"&gt;olympians&lt;/a&gt; lend their help to Zagreus in his escape attempts. She is informed Zagreus wishes to leave the Underworld and meet his family up top, but this is just a lie to convince them to join their cause.\nShe'll actively and gladly lend Zagreus her help. Her points of conversation are mostly encouragements to Zagreus, and she doesn't often bring other topics up.\nShe participates in the feast alongside the other Olympians. She's shocked to find the truth and that she's been lied to, but understands the reasons behind it, seeing as otherwise they wouldn't be as keen to help, and the repercussions would be severe. She keeps on lending her help afterwards.\nHades II.\nAthena oversees the defense of Mount Olympus against the forces of &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;. She can be encountered while Melino\u00eb traverses Mount Olympus and offers some of her boons to her.\nAffinity.\nIf given &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;, Athena will give you the &lt;a href=\"Owl%20Pendant\"&gt;Owl Pendant&lt;/a&gt;.\nAthena's affinity gauge is maxed out at 7 hearts.\nFavor.\nAthena's favor requires seeing all three of Athena's remarks after successfully clearing a run, acknowledging Zagreus' strength.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\nMerchandise=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

It is quite evident to me how much she cares for you. I must admit I envy your relationship, sometimes. For I've made do without a mother's presence in my life.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Athena: \n\"Lord Ares has suggested he and goddess Nyx have grown much closer to each other, in all this. Nothing untoward, if you must know. Ares and I have often disagreed, about so many things, and yet we share a fondness for the Night herself, it seems.\" \nDialogue 03.\n Athena: \n\"Sometimes I think about the goddess Nyx, and how I long for her to be the mother that I never had, Cousin. Is it improper that I say such things to you? One would expect I would already have somebody on Olympus, yet... it often feels as though I am the mother, here.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Olympians\"&gt;Olympians&lt;/a&gt;.\n Athena: \n\"You've met your distant relatives by now.

He's taken interest in your plight; you should feel honored!\" \n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;.\n Athena: \n\"I'll tell you something, Cousin: If even Artemis is aiding you, it's proof your cause is just. She doesn't often take an interest in family affairs.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;.\n Athena: \n\"Cousin, you've met Aphrodite, no? She likes beguiling others with her charms; but her intentions with you I believe are pure. You'll find our strengths are complementary.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;.\n Athena: \n\"My warlike brother Ares reached you, didn't he. I've always found his conduct quite disturbing. At least it seems he's helping you for now.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Athena: \n\"Did Dionysus truly visit you before? He tends to seek out revelry, not conflict. I'm pleased to know he's making himself useful here.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;.\n Athena: \n\"You arrived sooner than anticipated, Cousin, and my estimations seldom are inaccurate. All for the best, of course. Perhaps you're simply faster than I thought.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;.\n Athena: \n\"You've met the master of the seas, Poseidon, haven't you? Our uncle's affable but quick to anger. Be on your guard with him, is my advice.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;.\n Athena: \n\"The biting cold surrounding you must mean the Goddess of Seasons decided to take an interest in your struggle, Zagreus? I did not count on Demeter being a part of this. Take heart, though use discretion around her.\" \nWith Other Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Athena: \n\"Noble cousin, my lord father has taken keen interest in your journey and your plight, and now seeks to aid you with the thunder of heaven itself. And you've my support, as well, of course.\" \n Zeus: \n\"I thank you for the generous introduction, fair Athena, and I always rest assured when you are close at hand. I trust with our combined might, our good Zagreus is virtually certain to succeed!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus: \n\"Why, look, Zagreus, here comes brave Athena, first to reach you among all my kin, in all her shrewdness. So proactive, you contacted Zagreus prior to even telling me, my dear!\" \n Athena: \n\"Lord Father, would that I could settle even more such matters quickly and discreetly, so that only the most vital of them rise up to the level of your notice, sir. Though, I'm certain Zagreus and I are very grateful you have intervened.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Athena: \n\"Your predicament has pulled our family together, united in a desire to assist you, Cousin. Even those who typically do not think much of those other than themselves.\" \n Aphrodite: \n\"Oh, if only I had wisdom such as yours, Athena dear, so that I was more capable of picking up on subtle jabs and insults such as that! You're not fooling anybody with your feigned benevolence, you know.\" \n Athena: \n\"The world is not all lies and deceit as you make it out to be, Aphrodite. Sometimes, a lending of assistance is no more than it appears to be. Now either back up Zagreus, or stand aside.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Aphrodite: \n\"You must forgive us, little godling, meaning our extended family here upon Olympus! Some of us are terribly stuck up, and must be making matters much more complicated than they have to be.\" \n Athena: \n\"I wonder, dearest Aphrodite, whether you'd be willing to repeat such things directly to my countenance?\" \n Aphrodite: \n\"Oh, you must know full well that I would do much more than that directly to your countenance, Athena dear! Quite frankly, you could use a lot of work!\" \nDialogue 03.\n Aphrodite: \n\"Dearest, you must know, Goddess Athena and myself, we don't always share a common view, perhaps because she overthinks things constantly, while my heart leads me on!\" \n Athena: \n\"I'm glad we understand each other, then. It would be most embarrassing to be caught bickering amongst ourselves in front of Zagreus.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Athena: \n\"When I first notified Lord Father Zeus and other members of our family of your existence, Zagreus, it was Uncle Poseidon here who first leapt up, and pledged his power over sea and earth to you. Is that not so, Uncle?\" \n Poseidon: \n\"Exactly so, Athena! You, with that fine memory of yours! For it isn't everyday I learn my doleful brother Hades sired a fine son! He does not know how good he has it, there! And \"you\", Nephew, could have it even better, \"here\"!\" \nDialogue 02.\n Poseidon: \n\"As you can see by now, we are a big and clever family, little Hades! My niece Athena here being the cleverest of all. You'd never know that she was childless, the way she looks after and cares for all of us!\" \n Athena: \n\"Surely my cleverness comes from your brother and yourself, Lord Uncle Poseidon. And I would only add, my feeling is we've more than enough children in this family, thus no further need for more of them, for now.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\n Ares: \n\"I wished only to speak to you in private once again, my kin, except, you see...\" \n Athena: \n\"...Except you see, dear Cousin, that some members of our family are predisposed toward the unspeakable. I caution you around my half-brother, is all. Now carry on.\" \n Ares: \n\"You interrupt me once again, dear sister. You know I do not care for that. I warn you to stay out of my affairs. I shall aid my kin as I see fit.\" \n Athena: \n\"You only do as you see fit, Lord Ares. Mind that you continue pulling in the same direction as us all.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Athena: \n\"I bring to you the Lady Demeter, Cousin. I've asked that she please rest assured knowing we have your matter well under control. Though, in her infinite compassion, she has taken up your cause, nevertheless!\" \n Demeter: \n\"Oh, you needn't lavish me with your faint praise, Athena dear. In all your boundless intellect, I'd have expected you would know I see through your intentions, plain as day.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Demeter: \n\"To think, young sprout, our strategist Athena, warrior-goddess, sprang from Zeus' head! I would expect that no high intellect could come from there.\" \n Athena: \n\"Please do not mind the Lady Demeter's good-natured sense of humor, Zagreus. She and my father often like to jest with one another, even in the most difficult times.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Athena: \n\"Some members of our family do not yet fully understand just how precarious your situation is, Cousin. My Lord Dionysus here, he goes about as though this is a festive matter of some sort!\" \n Dionysus: \n\"Oh, come on, Athena girl, you really mean to tell me that discovering a long-lost relative isn't a cause for celebrating right away, I mean, you can't be telling me a thing like \"that\"? Because if Zag isn't a cause for feasting, I don't know what is!\" \nDialogue 02.\n Dionysus: \n\"Hey, Zag, when you arrive, it's going to be a real scene, I'll tell you now! Even Athena here will cut loose for a bit, let down her hair, you know, put on something more comfy, yeah, it's going to be \"great\"!\" \n Athena: \n\"Perhaps Lord Dionysus here is the true god of strategy, as it appears he is uncannily aware of my next move, Cousin. Although, be that as it may, I shall attempt to remain focused on your situation. Not his feast.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Athena: \n\"If you've a moment, Zagreus? One of my relatives has claimed that I usurp your time. So I invited her to contact you.\" \n Artemis: \n\"Um, hello, Zagreus... Athena here is grandstanding or trying to prove a point, or something. I don't know. Anyway, nice talking to you.\" \n Athena: \n\"Well, I suppose that's settled, then. I am afraid such interactions aren't uncommon here amongst my family; but what's a family without flaws?\" \nBeing Invited to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt; (Pre-Epilogue).\n Zagreus: \n\"This is it, then. In the name of Hades! Olympus, this is an official message! Lady Athena, I trust you'll quickly figure this one out.\" \n Athena: \n\"Is this some kind of offering for me? No, hold a moment, this appears to be a message! Part of one. Then, can this mean...? I have to notify the others. I trust they also have received something from you, or shortly shall.\" \nPost-Epilogue Dialogue.\nDialogue 01.\n Athena: \n\"It was my privilege to have visited your father's House, and briefly had a chance to meet \"you\", Zagreus. Nyx and your mother each are very shrewd; perhaps you've taken after both of them. As for your new responsibilities... exposing weak points in defenses is my specialty.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Athena: \n\"It's fortunate your troubles with your mother were resolved. Persephone, I mean! To think I led all of my family to believe your mother was the goddess Nyx, instead. It seems I was an unwitting accomplice to a bit of a deception, there. But Nyx, I know she merely tried to help.\" \nMiscellaneous Conversations.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; Progressing in a Run.\nDialogue 01.\n Athena: \n\"It comforts me to see how far you've come, Cousin. And I am confident that you shall make your way, eventually. I shall look forward to our conversations then.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Athena: \n\"You reached the flames of Asphodel, well done! You may have quite a distance still to go, but having crossed through Tartarus is no small step, Cousin.\" \nDialogue 03.\n Athena: \n\"I see you've made it all the way to hallowed Elysium, Cousin? A significant way toward the surface, and if you could get there the one time, surely you have what it takes to do it again, and overcome the dangers that await therein.\" \nDialogue 04.\n Athena: \n\"I understand you nearly reached the surface lately, Zagreus. My confidence remains unshaken that you shall get out of there, eventually. No matter what sorts of unknown horrors lie shrouded beyond the boundary there.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; Clearing a Run.\nDialogue 01.\n Athena: \n\"Were you not close to having reached the surface lately, Cousin? Then, this can only mean some unforeseen impediment prevented your escape.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Athena: \n\"There must be some unconquerable force or foe awaiting you, just at the border of your realm and ours. We cannot even see it through a shroud of darkness, there. I shall make certain that your family knows it may take considerable time to surpass... so fear not, for we are patient, here.\" \nDialogue 03.\n Athena: \n\"Despite whatever difficulties you've encountered, dear Cousin, again and again, you have never yielded. I must admit, your strength of will is quite inspiring. For, even I have doubts, from time to time. It's all the clearer to me why the goddess Nyx spoke so highly of you.\" \nBuying Boon at &lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;'s Shop.\nDialogue 01.\n Athena: \n\"It feels unseemly to make contact from that most-unpleasant boatman's stash of ill-gotten wares. Nonetheless, this was an opportunity.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Athena: \n\"You're difficult to track there in the depths, Cousin; though, the boatman Charon thankfully is proving of some help.\" \nDialogue 03.\n Athena: \n\"The river-boatman Charon is beholden to your father's realm, but seems agreeable enough, for a fair price.\" \nDialogue 04.\n Athena: \n\"A shrewd expenditure of wealth is sometimes all that stands between a victory and sore defeat, isn't that right, Cousin?\" \nDialogue 05.\n Athena: \n\"We cannot effectively communicate with Charon from Olympus, but he is amenable to certain trades, and seems unfettered by your father's influence.\" \nHigh Affinity Dialogue.\n Athena: \n\"Supporting you through your ordeal, Cousin? It's reminiscent of the thrill of doing battle by the side of those whom I hold dear. I may be safe upon our mountaintop, though I am with you there, as well... for every well-earned victory, and bitter loss.\"\nAbout Backstory.\nDialogue 01.\n Athena: \n\"The one called Nyx... she is your mother, as I understand? We Olympians rarely consort with the chthonic gods. Though Nyx herself reached out to me about your plight, and I was spurred to act.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Athena: \n\"Please send the goddess Nyx my kind regards. That she supports you in your effort to escape her own domain suggests a selflessness I would not have expected.\" \nDialogue 03.\n Athena: \n\"It's such a cruelty that your father hid the knowledge of your birth and life from us, my cousin. It's unacceptable.\" \nDialogue 04.\n Athena: \n\"Your father Hades and my father Zeus have not communicated in some time, and Zeus refuses to explain. Something transpired between the two of them. Perhaps you know better than I.\" \nDialogue 05.\n Athena: \n\"There's something that I've wished to tell you, Zagreus: There is no shame in your upbringing. Many of us on Olympus, we likewise were born and raised under the strangest circumstances. Someday I'll have to tell you about mine.\" \nPost-Flashback Dialogue.\nDialogue 01.\n Athena: \n\"You're nothing like your father, Zagreus. I mean that as a compliment. He cut himself off from the rest of us. Many times have we attempted peace, to no avail.\" \nAbout Legendary Boon.\nDialogue 01.\n Athena: \n\"You cannot withstand your father's legions, Zagreus. But if you possess one of my greatest blessings, things may unfold differently, I think.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Athena: \n\"Dear Cousin, would that I could give to you everlasting, tireless resolve. Though, come to think of it, this may be suited as a counterpart.\" \nDialogue 03.\n Athena: \n\"For you, my cousin Zagreus, I wish to offer the most potent of the blessings I am able to bestow. Make wise your use of this, and rise toward us!\" \nDialogue 04.\n Athena: \n\"The circumstances spur me now to offer you the greatest of my powers, Cousin. Take my strength, and strike the darkness down!\" \nAbout Hades' &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Keepsake&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Athena: \n\"Zagreus, perhaps it is a fancy of imagination, but it seems almost as though, this time, you bear the blessing of... your own father! If Lord Hades is assisting you in any way in this, then I shall hold out hope that your relationship yet has capacity to heal, to some extent at least.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Athena: \n\"So you've another blessing from Lord Hades, then. Zagreus, I'm under no delusion you and your father shall become the closest friends, from here. Neverthless, I do believe it's possible to move forward even such a relationship as yours. Believe me... I know.\" \nAbout The &lt;a href=\"Fated%20List%20of%20Minor%20Prophecies\"&gt;Fated List of Minor Prophecies&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Athena: \n\"The goddess Nyx has indicated you possess a list of prophecies from the Three Fates. I've such a list upon Olympus, here! It seems to be connected to your own, as several prophecies already are fulfilled. Isn't it such an honor to urge Fate along?\" \nAbout Weapons.\nDialogue 01 (&lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Spear\"&gt;Varatha&lt;/a&gt;).\n Athena: \n\"You brandish the Eternal Spear we call Varatha...! So then it wasn't lost during the war. A magnificent weapon, in deserving hands.\" \nDialogue 02 (&lt;a href=\"Heart-Seeking%20Bow\"&gt;Coronacht&lt;/a&gt;).\n Athena: \n\"Why, you wield Coronacht the Heart-Seeker...! I never took you for an archer, though the power of that bow is undeniable. Use it wisely!\" \nDialogue 03 (&lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Aegis&lt;/a&gt;).\n Athena: \n\"You bear Aegis, the original itself...! My own shield was forged much later, in its image. You'll have to tell me someday how you found it.\" \nDialogue 04 (&lt;a href=\"Adamant%20Rail\"&gt;Exagryph&lt;/a&gt;).\n Athena: \n\"The Rail of Adamant, itself, has found its way into your hands, Cousin? A malignant thing, if you were to ask me, and not one I would ever use, myself. Unless, perhaps, I had no other choice. I suppose it must have been that way for you.\" \nDialogue 05 (&lt;a href=\"Twin%20Fists\"&gt;Malphon&lt;/a&gt;).\n Athena: \n\"You got your hands on Malphon, the Twin Fists, I see. No ordinary weapon. Prone to fits of savagery quite unbecoming of a well-trained warrior. Then watch yourself, and throw not caution to the wind.\" \nGifts.\n&lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"I'm indebted to you, Goddess, for all that you and your side of the family have done for me.\" \n Athena: \n\"Well it simply isn't in my nature to allow such offerings to go unanswered, noble Cousin. In turn, I wish for you to have this, with my compliments.\" \n\"Athena gives &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Owl%20Pendant\"&gt;Owl Pendant&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Lady Athena, thank you.\"\n2nd Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"For you, Lady Athena, without whom I would assuredly be lost.\" \n Athena: \n\"This is an unexpected gesture, Cousin! I do appreciate it, though please do not feel obliged. I offer you my friendship, not a loan to be repaid.\" \n3rd Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"I have a simple token for you, Goddess. Although it's insufficient thanks for all the aid you've given me.\" \n Athena: \n\"You are most gracious, Cousin, to extend this offering. You honor me, yet I would ask you think of your well-being for the time, not mine.\" \n4th Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Goddess Athena, please accept this gift. Your wisdom ever guides me toward the light.\" \n Athena: \n\"My, how very generous of you, to offer me this gift! I'm very grateful, though I ask that you not go out of your way on my account. Let's please stay focused, here?\" \n5th Time.\nOption A.\n Zagreus: \n\"As I remain committed to my task, Goddess, I'm reminded none of this would have been possible without your aid. And so, I must give thanks, even if through a meager offering.\" \n Athena: \n\"I know there isn't much that you can do to show your gratitude at present, Zagreus. But I would ask that you save it for when your task is complete. You've more important matters to attend to now!\" \nOption B.\n Zagreus: \n\"As I remain committed to my task, Goddess, I'm reminded none of this would have been possible without your aid. And so, I must give thanks, even if through a meager offering.\" \n Athena: \n\"I know there isn't much that you can do to show your gratitude at present, Zagreus. But I would ask that you save it for a better time. You've more important matters to attend to, now!\" \n6th Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Lady Athena, I know there's more at stake for you in this than just my plight... you care so much about this family. That care and your determination spurs me on. I'm ever grateful.\" \n Athena: \n\"Perhaps there really is no time quite like the present when it comes to showing thanks to one another, my dear Cousin. You've opened my eyes to the possibility, though I remain steadfast in my resolve to fight for you.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"I know this Ambrosia originated on Olympus, Lady Athena. Though through its long voyage to these depths, I trust its savor is more worthy of your grace. No one's ever had a greater cousin. And I'll never forget what you've done for me.\" \n Athena: \n\"Zagreus? When Nyx revealed herself to me and I first learned of you, I saw it as an opportunity to bridge the great divide between Olympus and your father's realm. But, having had all these glimpses into who you are, it is an even greater honor to have forged this partnership with you.\" "}

I am your cousin Athena, and proud to welcome you to Olympus. Yet I could be prouder, as this wasn't always such a miserable place.\"\n Melino\u00eb: \n\"Hail, Lady Athena and well met! Please call me Melino\u00eb. Now where can I direct my wrath, that we may liberate your mountain stronghold and see its glory all restored?\" \n Athena: \n\"Well met indeed, Melino\u00eb. The wretched Titan's armies have infiltrated our most sacred grounds. On them, your wrath may be well-spent; especially as you rise towards the summit, where most of our family now takes refuge.\" \n Melino\u00eb: \n\"The Palace of Zeus. And what of you, why aren't the others out here fighting by your side?\" \n Athena: \n\"Because that is precisely what our strategy requires, for they aided your arrival, did they not? Now, let us go our separate ways, and may my blessing aid in your ascent.\" \nAbout Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Arachne\"&gt;Arachne&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb: \n\"Lady Athena, by your leave ... we have a mutual acquaintance I would ask about, because ... well ... do you recall the weaver Arachne?\"\n Athena: \n\"I seldom forget anything, Cousin. Especially not insolent mortals who see themselves as equal to the gods. Though she is not exactly mortal anymore. What of her?\"\n Melino\u00eb: \n\"Well ... she lives down in Erebus now, near where I reside, and ... she's so wretched about her appearance, which I understand is from a curse you wrought ... doubtless entirely deserved, but ... have mercy on her, Lady Athena. Please.\"\n Athena: \n\"So many mortals grovel to me all the time. But goddesses? And on behalf of mortals far too prideful to grovel for themselves? Cousin, do not waste my time with this.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Athena: \n\"The mortal woman called Arachne. Have you any idea what she did? She fancied herself the greatest weaver in the world; superior even to me, if not the Fates themselves? Is it not our obligation, then, to remind mortals of their place?\"\n Melino\u00eb: \n\"I ... can't say I rightly know the answer to that, Lady Athena. Nor would I ever question your decision about her! I only ask if the term of her punishment could be less than eternal. She's humbled, and she's learned from her mistakes.\"\n Athena: \n\"Has she, now? In my experience mortals can be \"very\" slow to learn. And she was not punished as a lesson to \"her\", but as a lesson to \"everyone else\". I do not go back on my decisions, Melino\u00eb. For I don't make them lightly.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Athena: \n\"I must say, Cousin ... I've not seen such unity from our family in some time. Almost everybody stands together now against our foes. Though Dionysus, probably he's lying somewhere in a stupor.\"\n Melino\u00eb: \n\"If Lord Dionysus hasn't taken up arms against the forces of Chronos, surely he has his reasons ...\"\n Athena: \n\"Oh, he does. Why should he callus his hands, when he could laze about feasting? He's fortunate I've more important matters to consider than locating him.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Heracles\"&gt;Heracles&lt;/a&gt;.\n Athena: \n\"You have perhaps encountered mighty Heracles along your route. He has surpassing strength and capability, but do report to me any suspicious actions on his part.\"\n Melino\u00eb: \n\"I have encountered him, and seen him lay waste droves of our foes, though he's not been keen on conversation. Which sorts of suspicious activities do you mean?\"\n Athena: \n\"Consorting with our foes, defying our will, anything of that sort. I have no real reason not to trust him, yet ... I've come to trust you more.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt;.\n Athena: \n\"After we settled certain troubles with your brother's situation at home, your mother Persephone, she would regularly return to Olympus for part of each year. I should have trusted my instincts when one day she failed to show ...\"\n Melino\u00eb: \n\"Presumably when Chronos struck. Wouldn't her sudden disappearance have been cause for considerable alarm?\"\n Athena: \n\"You'd think. However, we knew your mother was with child, and our conclusion was that your new family wanted privacy. So we waited patiently, not realizing it as Chronos gained his foothold. A grave miscalculation on my part ...\"\n Melino\u00eb: \n\"Your father and mine first fought and vanquished Chronos long before either of us was born. You couldn't have expected the Titan Lord to suddenly return.\"\n Athena: \n\"Yet if I'm to be the strategist upon Olympus then I have to consider each possibility, however unlikely, that can threaten our peace. At any rate, a lesson harshly learned ...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Prometheus\"&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Athena: \n\"Beware ahead. The Titan Prometheus is able to elude me, knowing that I'm focused on his vanguard forces. But he'll have no choice but to confront you if you press on.\"\n Melino\u00eb: \n\"He's the Titan of Foresight. He knows exactly what we're planning, doesn't he? And can retaliate accordingly.\"\n Athena: \n\"He knows what is to come to some extent, yes. But he can only see outcomes, not read minds. And just because he knows you're coming doesn't mean he can stop you.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb: \n\"Have you confronted Prometheus before? You mentioned he's been able to elude you. Perhaps he knows he'd stand no chance against you if you fought.\"\n Athena: \n\"I knew Prometheus prior to all this. I suppose our tendencies towards matters of the mind connected us. You know that he stole the gift of fire for mortalkind. Well ... he also gave them reason, from me. Some of them, anyway.\"\n Melino\u00eb: \n\"I shudder to think what mortals must have been like before they had any reason. Although perhaps Prometheus ought to have kept some reason for himself.\"\n Athena: \n\"Perhaps he thinks he did, or has as much as he requires. Unfortunately, reason tends to be in lesser abundance than most would dare to admit.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Athena: \n\"Even if you're thwarted by the Titan Prometheus, it is a benefit to our war effort. For if he's having to confront you, then he's unable to cause his mayhem elsewhere.\"\n Melino\u00eb: \n\"That is of little consolation to me, Lady Athena. This is not his first crime against Olympus and our family; thus his punishment is to be even more severe.\"\n Athena: \n\"Do not concern yourself with that. His prior punishment inspired this still-greater transgression, rather than remorse for his past deeds. For the moment, our strategy merely requires that he no stand in our way.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Selene\"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt;.\n Athena: \n\"The Moon herself assists you, that I know. We often underestimate her here, believing all she does is faintly light the sky. But I know there is more to her than that.\"\n Melino\u00eb: \n\"Selene may be a Titaness but she's an ally to us through and through. She upholds Night's will, as do I.\"\n Athena: \n\"Nyx's will is none of my concern, Cousin. But apparently it's yours, and Nyx has likewise been an ally to Olympus in the past. If you trust Selene's involvement, that is enough.\"\nGifts.\n&lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Melino\u00eb: \n\"Lady Athena, while we have a moment, I wish to offer you this Nectar as a token of my gratitude. If I'd only known that we would meet here, perhaps I'd have arrived even sooner.\"\n Athena: \n\"Nonsense, for I'm certain that you made your journey here as quickly as you could. Well, I of course accept your offering, though shall be saving it for when our victory's achieved. This, however, you may be able to use sooner ...\"\n\"Athena gives &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Keepsakes/Hades%20II\"&gt;Gorgon Amulet&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n Melino\u00eb: \n\"You honor me with such a gift, Goddess.\"\n2nd Time.\n Athena: \n\"\"Huh.\" Try as I might to consider each possibility, partaking of Nectar in the midst of conflict that we're in is quite unthinkable. Still, it's something to look forward to.\" \n Melino\u00eb: \n\"If it's something to look forward to, then it's a greater gift than I thought. The idea of a sip of Nectar while at peace ... it does sound good.\"\n3rd Time.\n Athena: \n\"Your gesture in unnecessary. Warring mortals often make me offerings in hopes that I might guide them to victory. But you and I have a shared purpose, so I require no such incentives in our case.\" \n Melino\u00eb: \n\"This is no incentive, merely a way of saying thank you. For accepting me, and recognizing what potential I may have to aid our family in a time of need.\"\n4th Time.\n Athena: \n\"You honor me, and have my thanks. This Nectar, it's been to the Underworld and back ... along with you. It'll take on a particularly complex flavor, I should think.\"\n Melino\u00eb: \n\"If this bottle indeed traveled to the ends of the earth before returning home, then it's all the more suited to someone of your wisdom and experience. May you enjoy it once you lay down your arms.\""}
{"id": "2506", "revid": "47838920", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2506", "title": "Athena/Relationships", "text": "Family.\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;: Athena's father.&lt;br&gt;Athena is possibly his favorite daughter. Athena knows how to address her father appropriately, much more so than any of his other descendants on Mount Olympus. Athena praises him elaborately and shows respect to the great king of Olympus. Although she probably disapproves of some of his imprudent actions, which often lead her to intervene.\nWhile Zeus enjoys boasting, according to Athena, she herself would prefer to handle things more \"discreetly,\" in contrast to the occasional sensationalism her father causes. However, she is grateful for him having intervened and wielded his power over the lightning bolts.\nAlthough Athena says she is very different from her father and bears no resemblance to him beyond being a family member, she is equally willing to act imperiously and punish Zagreus should he choose another offering, showing that they are much more alike than she cares to admit.\n&lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;: Athena's half-brother.&lt;br&gt;Alongside Ares, her half-brother, Athena represents military strategy, while Ares represents bloodshed. The two are war gods with opposing perspectives and temperaments. Athena disapproves of Ares' style, and he warns her to stay out of his own business. Despite their sibling quarrels, Ares considers Athena a worthy adversary and praises her battle strategy to Zagreus. Athena is quite cordial and respectful towards her fellow Olympians, including Ares, despite how much they butt heads. She also comments that despite their differences, \"[they] both share a fondness for the night herself\". \n&lt;a href=\"Hephaestus\"&gt;Hephaestus&lt;/a&gt;: Athena's half-brother. \nTheir relationship is currently unknown. \n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;: Athena's half-sister.&lt;br&gt;Athena isn't a fan of her familial withdrawals, antisocial attitudes, or her younger half-sister's prolonged monologues. Artemis comments to Zagreus that she's never sure if Athena is showing off or trying to prove something. Athena retorts, commenting that such interactions between the two are not uncommon for sisters; \"and what is a perfect family without routine fights?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;: Athena's half-brother.&lt;br&gt;Their relationship is currently unknown.\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;: Athena's half-brother.&lt;br&gt;Athena finds fault with her brother's secrecy and tendency to withhold information. He believes his stepsister is overly curious and overly problem-solving. Athena is worried that her brother's meddling could do more harm than good.\n&lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;: Athena's half-brother.&lt;br&gt;She indirectly criticizes him, suggesting that some of his relatives are participating only because they consider all of this a festival. However, it can be suggested that, unlike Athena, who may be acting, he genuinely thinks discovering a long-lost relative is cause for celebration.\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;: Athena's uncle.&lt;br&gt;Poseidon and Athena incredibly seem to have a positive relationship between them. She comments that, when she enlisted her family's help to help Zagreus, her uncle Poseidon was the first who jumped in and pledged his power over sea and land. Poseidon says that his niece Athena is the smartest of the family, and by the way she takes care of everyone, no one would know that she doesn't have children.\nDespite this, even with his amiable demeanor, he easily becomes irritating, and she prefers to stay cautious around him.\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;: Athena's foster aunt.&lt;br&gt;Athena greets her foster aunt with reverence, addressing her as \"Lady Demeter,\" a gesture that underscores her respect for the Olympian authority figure she is. Athena didn't anticipate Demeter to be involved in the cause, presuming that Demeter might not have much interest in Zagreus' cause and that she should be immersed in her ongoing acts of infinite boundless benevolence these days.\nAlthough grateful for any assistance, Athena finds Demeter's cold and capricious temperament unpleasant. She advises exercising caution and discretion in her presence, recognizing the need for care and tact when engaging with this particular goddess.\n&lt;a href=\"Hestia\"&gt;Hestia&lt;/a&gt;: Athena's foster aunt.\nTheir relationship is currently unknown.\n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;: The Goddess of Love and Beauty.&lt;br&gt;Athena and Aphrodite are like oil and water, Athena tries to maintain composure in front of her Olympic and cousin companions, with Aphrodite being the only exception; the two will openly insult each other in front of Zagreus and make no attempt to hide it. If she and Aphrodite are together, she will immediately express her disdain but puts it aside to help Zagreus. Even by Olympic standards, the two simply do not like each other, and their double-edged benefits often result in Zagreus being thrown in the middle of their feud.\nChthonic Gods.\nAthena reaches out to them for assistance in aiding Zagreus, as part of a grander scheme to reconcile relations between the Chthonic and Olympian deities.\nZagreus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;: Athena's cousin.&lt;br&gt;Athena, compared to the other Olympians, tends to be impersonal and is the only one who doesn't give Zagreus an affectionate nickname as she is busy coming up with a strategy. Athena will always try to dissuade Zagreus whenever he gives her a bottle of nectar because she doesn't want to be rewarded for helping him. Despite her aloofness, the goddess of wisdom is also probably the most benevolent Olympian, helping Zagreus partially because it's the right thing to do and not just because he's family...but mostly because they're family.\nHades.\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;: Athena's uncle.&lt;br&gt; \nAs a god from a previous generation, Athena shows a lot of respect for her uncle, and despite being a goddess with argumentative abilities, not even she is able to convince him to change his mind when he puts something into his thick head.\nNyx.\n&lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;: Night Incarnate.&lt;br&gt;Athena seems to be on good terms with Nyx, whom she considers to be shrewd. She is one of the first Olympians to respond to Nyx's plea to help Zagreus. At one point, she confesses that she sometimes envies Zagreus' relationship with his (foster) mother, having never had one herself.\nHouse of Hades.\nAchilles.\n&lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt;: former prot\u00e9g\u00e9.&lt;br&gt;Athena was once the patron of a young Achilles during tumultuous times in his past, during the \"Trojan War\".\nDusa.\n&lt;a href=\"Dusa\"&gt;Dusa&lt;/a&gt;: Duty-Bound Gorgon.&lt;br&gt;Although the nature of her relationship with Athena remains undisclosed, it is noteworthy that whenever Athena makes an appearance on screen, she noticeably displays terror and seeks to conceal herself in order to avoid being seen by the goddess."}

It now dwells in the fiery Phlegethon river that flows through &lt;a href=\"Asphodel\"&gt;Asphodel&lt;/a&gt;, and guards the passage to &lt;a href=\"Elysium\"&gt;Elysium&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Bone Hydra is the boss encounter for Asphodel, as well as the second boss encountered in every run of \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;\". They are always encountered at Chamber 24, the final Chamber of Asphodel.\nCombat.\nThe Bone Hydra is fought in its own unique chamber. This chamber is shaped like a semi-hexagon island surrounded by magma. It also features 4 indestructible pillars which are placed in the more center area of the island. The Hydra rests at the top edge of the island, only extending down to the center of the island when Lunging.\nThe Bone Hydra's attacks start off relatively simple and grow more complex as the fight goes on. It begins the fight with three abilities: Lunge, Volley, and Ground Slam. \nIt also has 4 Variant options it can become after the player has killed it three times, based on what the Support Heads can do.\nNOTE: effects applied before the Hydra becomes invulnerable will not cause damage once the phase change begins.\nEach Support Head has access to the Lunge attack, and one other attack:\nExtreme Measures.\nWhen using the second rank of the Extreme Measures condition of the &lt;a href=\"Pact%20of%20Punishment\"&gt;Pact of Punishment&lt;/a&gt;, the Bone Hydra's arena will change. Rather than one large island with the Hydra tethered to the topmost edge, it will instead be fought in the center of a smaller island split up by streams of magma. There are no permanent pillars in this arena, but there are a number of breakable pillars scattered around.\nWhen summoning Support Heads, instead of being trapped to the left, right, and bottom edges of the island, they will spawn on all four sides of the island. The main head will remain in the middle.\nUpon reaching 66% health, the Bone Hydra will shatter the neck keeping it tethered to the center of the arena before summoning the support heads. The now-disembodied head will begin to chase Zagreus around the arena, frequently lunging at Zagreus and triple ground slamming. It will continue to act like this even after all 6 of its Support Heads are vanquished. It is still invulnerable while its Support Heads are alive.\nAfter being reduced to 33% max HP with Extreme Measures, it will lose the ability to use Volley or Barrage for the rest of the fight.\nReward.\nWhen defeated, the Bone Hydra drops a &lt;a href=\"Diamond\"&gt;Diamond&lt;/a&gt; if Bounty conditions are met. This means that either it must be Zagreus' first victory against it with a weapon, or the Target Heat must be met for that weapon. Otherwise, it will drop 100 . The &lt;a href=\"Darkness\"&gt;Darkness&lt;/a&gt; reward is affected by Boons and bonuses (Dark Thirst, &lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon's&lt;/a&gt; Ocean's Bounty, &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos's&lt;/a&gt; Eclipse, etc.)\nAfter picking up the reward, the door on the opposite side of the chamber will open, allowing Zagreus access to the Stairway Chamber between Asphodel and &lt;a href=\"Elysium\"&gt;Elysium&lt;/a&gt;. In the chamber is a Healing Fountain, a &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Charon\"&gt;Well of Charon&lt;/a&gt;, Pool of Purging, and the Keepsake Display Case (if it has been purchased at the House Contractor)."}

As his punishment for cheating death, Sisyphus is forced to push Bouldy up a hill constantly, only to have him roll back to the bottom, repeating this process for eternity. Over time, however, Bouldy has become something of a confidante for Sisyphus rather than merely a source of unending torment.\nBouldy returns in &lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;, having been left to keep &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; company by Sisyphus.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nBouldy does not seem to like talking very much, but &lt;a href=\"Sisyphus\"&gt;Sisyphus&lt;/a&gt; considers him a good friend and confidant.\nAlthough Bouldy is claimed to be a living being, he is never heard or seen moving on screen, but Sisyphus seems to be able to understand what he is saying; however, this is likely just Sisyphus's imagination.\nIt is massively questioned whether Bouldy really is alive or not. If &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; offers Bouldy &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;, Bouldy will apparently happily accept the gift and somehow gives Zagreus the Heart of Stone boon implying that he does seem to possess some form of sapience.

From then on, Bouldy is willing to lend a little help to Zagreus at the price of one Nectar.\nOnce Sisyphus's contract is revised and he's no longer bound to his previous torment, he still decides to stay in Tartarus, mostly to stay with Bouldy, among other reasons.\nHades II.\nHades was sent to Sisyphus' chamber after &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt; took control of the Underworld.

{"id": "631", "revid": "33105", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=631", "title": "Cast", "text": "Cast is an attack ability that is innate to Zagreus and thus does not depend on &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Arms\"&gt;Infernal Arms&lt;/a&gt; for the base damage, though a few aspects, most notably &lt;a href=\"Beowulf\"&gt;Beowulf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt; do modify how casting works.\nBy default Cast is a slow long-range spell that launches a &lt;a href=\"Bloodstones\"&gt;bloodstone&lt;/a&gt; , dealing 50 base damage on impact. Casting costs one from the bloodstone magazine. Zagreus has up to three reusable when using Infernal Soul with the &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20of%20Night\"&gt;Mirror of Night&lt;/a&gt;, or only one that regenerates after 3-5 seconds when using Stygian Soul. When Cast hits an enemy, it stays lodged inside the foe until they are killed or 15 seconds elapse, giving them a status effect. When the bloodstone falls it can be collected to be launched again, or will disappear when using Stygian Soul.\nCast is a boon slot and can be upgraded using Poms of Power, however unlike other boons, cast upgrades do not give a % increase, but rather a large base damage increase. Each god's Cast also modifies the speed, area of effect and additional mechanics of the cast. Three casts, Dionysus, Demeter and Ares, create a projectile that does damage on its own instead of lodging into enemies.\n&lt;a href=\"Mirror%20of%20Night\"&gt;Mirror of Night&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Mirror of Night can modify Cast in several ways. The biggest impact is from choosing between Infernal Soul and Stygian Soul as it changes the way are collected. Infernal Soul gives three that will stay present in game once launched and have to be recollected on the ground in order to be launched again. Meanwhile Stygian Soul gives only one , but it regenerates after three seconds, regardless of where the previously launched is. This bloodstone does not drop from enemies to be collected.&lt;/br&gt;\nRegardless of the choice, it is always possible to augment the number of during an escape attempt with &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt; Boons, &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;\u2019 Legendary Boon and Prometheus Stones from the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Charon\"&gt;Well of Charon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/br&gt;\nThe second choice is between Boiling Blood and Abyssal Blood, it affects the status given to enemies with at least one lodged in them. Boiling Blood gives +50% Attack and Special damage, while Abyssal Blood reduces the enemy\u2019s speed and damage by 30%.\nShots.\nRather than providing a % damage increase, cast boons increase the base damage of the cast. Because upgrades which apply % damage augementation in Hades stack additavely based on the base damage of the abilities which they affect, additional upgrades which provide a % damage increase synergize much more effectively with cast boons than they do with Zagreus' attack or special boons.&lt;/br&gt;\nCast boons also affect the mechanics of the cast more significantly than other core boons affect their respective abilities. Five of the cast boons (Aphrodite, Artemis, Athena, Poseidon, and Zeus) retain some of the mechanics of the unmodified cast, most notably the ability of the cast to lodge in foes. These five therefore function similarly in some respects, although even they have more significant mechanical differences from the unmodified cast than do Zagreus' other core boons; Athena's cast, for example, inflicts a bust of AOE damage on impact, whereas Artemis' cast tracks foes, and Zeus' cast bounces between foes. Three of the casts, however (Ares, Demeter, and Dionysus) retain none of the mechanics of the unmodified cast. In addition, many cast boons can themselves be mechanically altered through the use of duo boons, such as Hunting blades for Ares cast and Blizzard Shot for Poseidon cast. The functional variety found in cast boons is, therefore, more significant than that of any of Zagreus' other core slots. \nInfernal Arms changes.\nWhile Cast boons deal big bursts of damage, the long time they stay stuck in enemies make them unreliable as the primary damage dealer against bosses if using Infernal Soul. Several weapons aspects remedy this by changing the ammo and firing mechanics.\nAspect of Poseidon.\nThe third aspect of the &lt;a href=\"Stygian%20Blade\"&gt;Stygian Blade&lt;/a&gt; allows to dislodge from enemies by hitting them with the Special. The weapon also gives upgradable Cast Damage, from +10% to +50% Cast Damage.\nThis aspect works great with high burst damage casts, but the Special\u2019s ability to dislodge is useless with projectile casts or if using Stygian Soul.\nAspect of Hera.\nThe third aspect of the &lt;a href=\"Bow\"&gt;Bow&lt;/a&gt; allows to load in the next attack, releasing it on impact. Like Beowulf, this allows for massive burst damage, but the does lodge into enemies, keeping a delay between loaded attacks. The Aspect of Hera does not modify the cast boons, but it reduces the drop time of the lodged in enemies, from 10 to 5 seconds when fully upgraded.\nAspect of Beowulf.\nThe hidden aspect of &lt;a href=\"Aegis\"&gt;Aegis&lt;/a&gt; allows the player to load into the Attack, releasing all the casts loaded in an area of damage burst at the end of a Dragon Rush. (Dragon rush is Beowulf's modified Bull Rush). The cannot lodge itself in enemies and falls instantly, greatly reducing the delay to reuse it. Using the Aspect of Beowulf modifies all casts, including the base cast, into flare attacks which have similar damage to their shot equivalent, but work differently to put more emphasis on AOE damage. Zeus' chain-lightning becomes a lightning bolt, and Demeter's Crystal beam is replaced by AOE chilling damage."}

He is reliable and cannot disobey his master's orders, but he can sometimes be persuaded with a simple bone.\nCerberus patrols the shores of the Styx to prevent strangers from entering or residents from leaving. It is possible to pet Cerberus (although only one of his heads enjoys pets) and indeed necessary to unlock certain improvements from the House Contractor. He can be needy, and when he becomes anxious, he may carelessly destroy the lounge, making it unavailable for immediate use.

{"id": "1270", "revid": "4139698", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1270", "title": "Chamber Reward", "text": "Most chambers in &lt;a href=\"Hades%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hades (game)&lt;/a&gt; has one or more pickups as rewards to the player upon clearing them.\nReward for Regular Chamber.\nA regular room's reward can be of either MetaProgress or RunProgress category. The MetaProgress category consists of / / / . The RunProgress category consists of &lt;a href=\"Centaur%20Heart\"&gt;Centaur Heart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Obol\"&gt;Obol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pom%20of%20Power\"&gt;Pom of Power&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daedalus%20Hammer\"&gt;Daedalus Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boons\"&gt;Boons&lt;/a&gt; from Olympian Gods, and &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Gods\"&gt;Trial of the Gods&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhether a room's reward will be MetaProgress or RunProgress is determined by this formula (simplified for clarity):\ntargetMetaRewardsRatio.\nThis value expresses how much the game wants the player to have a certain percentage of MetaProgress. The value is different for each Biome:\nThe wings of &lt;a href=\"Styx\"&gt;Styx&lt;/a&gt; cannot have MetaProgress as rewards.\nMetaRewardsAdjustSpeed.\nA factor to increase the impact of getting each room's reward. The value of it is , which is defined in codice_1\ncurrentMetaProgressRatio.\nTo measure how many rooms' MetaProgress rewards the player has received. It is calculated with codice_2. Only MetaProgress from room reward counts as MetaProgressCount. &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Trove\"&gt;Infernal Trove&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darkness\"&gt;Darkness&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon's Shop&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Charon\"&gt;Well of Charon&lt;/a&gt; don't count.\nCounter Example.\nAccording to the Full Example above, the 2nd chamber's reward must be MetaProgress. But it has been witnessed that the 2nd chamber's reward can be a God's boon, which is RunProgress.\nSpecial Reward.\nSome chambers' rewards are constant / less randomized. They don't conform to the formula above and cannot be rerolled by &lt;a href=\"Fated%20Authority\"&gt;Fated Authority&lt;/a&gt;. \nLanding Chamber.\nWhen a new run is started, the first chamber that Zagreus lands in has an enforced reward \"before\" the room is cleared. It's either a &lt;a href=\"Daedalus%20Hammer\"&gt;Daedalus Hammer&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Boon\"&gt;Boon&lt;/a&gt; from an Olympian God except &lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;.\nMini-boss Chamber.\nThe reward in a mini-boss chamber is enforced to be a Boon from an Olympian God.\nBoss Chamber.\nThe reward in a Boss Chamber is either a &lt;a href=\"bounty\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt;, or a large amount of Darkness if the bounty for the current weapon &amp; current heat level is already acquired. If it is Darkness, it counts as MetaProgressCount.\nTips.\nCollect Bounties for More RunProgress.\nIf a boss room drops bounty, it doesn't count as MetaProgress. Thus it'll make future rooms more likely to have MetaProgress rewards. But after the bounty is claimed, the room will have a Darkness reward, which counts as MetaProgress.\nPrefer Non-boon Reward in Erebus.\nThe calculation of MetaProgressRatio only counts number of rooms. One pickup of Pom of Power / Obols / Centaur Heart in &lt;a href=\"Erebus\"&gt;Erebus&lt;/a&gt; gives double the amount of its regular version, but only counts as one non-MetaProgress. But picking up a boon in Erebus is still just one boon.\nOn the other hand, losing the challenge of Erebus also counts as one non-MetaProgress."}

The reward for each chamber is visible on its entrance door, and is obtained after clearing the chamber. A total number of 73 chambers may be encountered in a run.\n Chamber Number (without &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt; rooms and troves):\nEncounters.\nMost of the Chambers during an escape attempt will be Encounters with waves of enemies. Once all waves of enemies have been defeated, the room's reward will appear for Zagreus to collect, and entrance doors to the next chamber(s) will unlock.\nSome encounters are more difficult than others, denoted by a skull underneath the reward symbol on the room's door. These are encounters with increased rewards such as double Darkness rooms, &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Gods\"&gt;Trial of the Gods&lt;/a&gt;, and mini-boss / boss encounters.\nAll normal encounters have a chance of spawning an &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Trove\"&gt;Infernal Trove&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Charon\"&gt;Well of Charon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pool%20of%20Purging\"&gt;Pool of Purging&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Gate\"&gt;Chaos Gate&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Gate\"&gt;Infernal Gate&lt;/a&gt;, which will open after the reward has been collected. Some of these can be forcefully spawned in with items from the Well of Charon.\nRewards.\nChamber rewards are denoted on their entrance door by a symbol surrounded by an either blue or yellow laurel wreath. Blue Laurels accompany persistent resources (&lt;a href=\"Chthonic%20Key\"&gt;Keys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darkness\"&gt;Darkness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gemstone\"&gt;Gemstone&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;) that can be &lt;a href=\"Wretched%20Broker\"&gt;traded&lt;/a&gt; or used to unlock new &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Arms\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, power up the &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20of%20Night\"&gt;Mirror of Night&lt;/a&gt;, or earn &lt;a href=\"Keepsakes\"&gt;Keepsakes&lt;/a&gt;. Gold Laurels represent rewards that impact the current run, such as &lt;a href=\"Charon%27s%20Obol\"&gt;Obols&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boons\"&gt;Boons&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Centaur%20Heart\"&gt;Centaur Heart&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe presence of a skull symbol on a room reward indicates increased difficulty and enhanced rewards. Persistent rewards and &lt;a href=\"Pom%20of%20Power\"&gt;Pom&lt;/a&gt; strength are doubled, while &lt;a href=\"Boons\"&gt;Boons&lt;/a&gt; are more likely to be of higher rarity. \nSpending a Fated Authority will reroll an upcoming room reward with one from the same pool, e.g. a Boon can replace a &lt;a href=\"Daedalus%20Hammer\"&gt;Daedalus Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, but not &lt;a href=\"Gemstone\"&gt;Gemstone&lt;/a&gt;s. NPC Encounters, &lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon's Shop&lt;/a&gt;, and Bosses cannot be re-rolled.\nUnique Encounters.\nThere are also some unique encounters you may find in your travels. Most unique encounters are specific to certain biomes, and are typically mini-boss or boss encounters. More information for all of these encounters can be found on the specific biome pages.\nTartarus.\nTartarus features one mini-boss encounter which pits Zagreus against 2 armored Bloodless such as &lt;a href=\"Slam-Dancer\"&gt;Slam Dancers&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Inferno-Bomber\"&gt;Inferno Bombers&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Doomstone\"&gt;Doomstone&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"Wretched%20Sneak\"&gt;Wretched Sneak&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt also features three potential boss encounters: The &lt;a href=\"Furies\"&gt;Furies&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alecto\"&gt;Alecto&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tisiphone\"&gt;Tisiphone&lt;/a&gt;. Each of them has their own unique chamber to fight in, but only one will appear per run.\nAsphodel.\nAsphodel features three mini-boss encounters: The &lt;a href=\"Megagorgon\"&gt;Megagorgon&lt;/a&gt; chamber, the Witches' Circle chamber, and the Barge of Death encounter (previously named the River Crossing chamber). In the first, Zagreus will fight a Megagorgon (an enemy exclusive to this encounter) and an Elite &lt;a href=\"Skull-Crusher\"&gt;Skull-Crusher&lt;/a&gt;. In the second, he will fight five special Elite &lt;a href=\"Spreader\"&gt;Spreaders&lt;/a&gt;. In the third, Zagreus will fight waves of enemies protected by &lt;a href=\"Voidstone\"&gt;Voidstones&lt;/a&gt; as he crosses the river of fire beneath him.\nIt features only one boss encounter, the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Hydra\"&gt;Lernaean Bone Hydra&lt;/a&gt;, which has its own unique chamber.\nElysium.\nElysium also features two mini-boss encounters: The Elite &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Catcher\"&gt;Soul Catcher&lt;/a&gt; chamber and the &lt;a href=\"Asterius\"&gt;Asterius&lt;/a&gt; arena chamber. In both of these chambers, Zagreus will have to fight either an Elite Soul Catcher, as well as any reinforcements it has, or Asterius (The Minotaur), respectively.\nElysium features only one boss encounter, which is &lt;a href=\"Theseus\"&gt;Theseus&lt;/a&gt;' Arena, where Zagreus will fight both Theseus and Asterius. Like all other boss encounters, it has its own unique chamber.\nOther Unique Encounters.\nThanatos.\nAfter encountering him for the first time in Elysium, &lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt; has the ability to appear in a chamber, changing it drastically. In a Thanatos chamber, there will be an increased number of enemies, and Thanatos will help the player clear the room. If the player manages to score as many (or more) kills than Thanatos, he will reward the player with a &lt;a href=\"Centaur%20Heart\"&gt;Centaur Heart&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the chamber, in addition to the chamber's reward. If the player fails to score more kills, there is no extra penalty, besides some slightly disapproving commentary from Thanatos.\nThanatos can appear in any room which is not already a unique encounter or chamber. He can only appear once per run and is not guaranteed to appear every run. He can also be gifted &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt; after the encounter, before he leaves.\nTrial of the Gods.\nA Trial is denoted by a pair of boons along with a skull marker indicating a difficult room. Two boons are offered and Zagreus must choose one over the other. The spurned god becomes displeased and summons waves of enemies, as well as an effect unique to each god.\nAfter completing the Trial, the spurned god forgives Zagreus and offers their boon. There is no penalty or advantage for spurning either god.\nSurvival.\nExclusive to Tartarus, occasionally &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; will change a standard encounter into a survival encounter. In a survival encounter, Zagreus must survive for 45 seconds against increasing numbers of enemies, which are spawned constantly instead of in waves. After 45 seconds, Hades himself will destroy every spawned enemy, and the room's reward will spawn. Although you are not required to kill any of the enemies that spawn, it is recommended that you do. Enemies will still drop &lt;a href=\"Charon%27s%20Obol\"&gt;Obols&lt;/a&gt;, and rooms may be too cramped to easily avoid damage if there are lots of enemies. \nThe mandatory 45 seconds of a survival encounter are \"not\" counted towards the total time of the run. However, survival encounters are disabled when the &lt;a href=\"Pact%20of%20Punishment\"&gt;Pact of Punishment&lt;/a&gt; condition Tight Deadline is enabled.\nErebus.\n&lt;a href=\"Erebus\"&gt;Erebus&lt;/a&gt; encounters can only be found by using &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Gate\"&gt;Infernal Gates&lt;/a&gt;. In an Erebus encounter, waves of enemies will spawn in a unique room. Zagreus is challenged to defeat all the waves of enemies without being hit once. If he is successful, he is rewarded with the Infernal Gate's reward, which is always an amplified reward (a god boon of increased rarity, a Pom of Power that upgrades by two levels instead of one, double obols, or a double max health drop). If he fails, the reward will be replaced with a &lt;a href=\"Red%20Onion\"&gt;Red Onion&lt;/a&gt;, which heals one Health when taken. Regardless of the outcome, three exit gates will spawn, leading Zagreus back to the biome he was currently in.\nOther Chambers.\nNot all chambers are Encounters specifically. There are several rarer chambers in the Underworld that can offer brief respite, which lack enemies. These rooms still offer rewards to the player. It is important to note that all non-combat chambers do not count towards items and boons timed around Encounters, such as Chaos boon debuffs or consumable items. (The only exceptions are HydraLite and HydraLite Gold, which will activate and be consumed as if it were an Encounter.)\nNon-Encounter chambers cannot spawn Infernal Troves, Wells of Charon, Pools of Purging, Chaos Gates, or Infernal Gate (with a couple exceptions detailed below).\nCharon.\nThe most common type of combat-free chamber are the shops run by &lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;. Charon's shops are denoted by his special symbol (a bag of his coins). In it, Zagreus will meet Charon, who will always be selling three random rewards. Charon can be gifted with Nectar.\nFree Room.\nFree rooms can be found if the player chooses the alternative door to Charon before a boss chamber. If so, they will enter the same chamber that Charon would have spawned in, but instead of Charon appearing, the reward of that room will simply appear in the center of the room for Zagreus to take.\nFree rooms also spawn as the first chamber of each biome (with the exception of Tartarus, as its first room has enemies in it). However, these free rooms do not offer rewards, and only offer passageway to the next chamber. These specific opening free rooms can also spawn Chaos Gates and Infernal Gates. When in Asphodel, the player cannot choose where to go, for there is only one option. In Elysium, however, there are generally two options.\nIt has also been noted that the two encounters found when entering Elysium have a much higher chance of spawning a &lt;a href=\"Daedalus%20Hammer\"&gt;Daedalus Hammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nFountains.\nFountain rooms can be found in any biome. When encountered, the reward for the room will be sitting near a large fountain. After Zagreus collects the room's reward (which can be any reward offered by a combat encounter), he must then drink from the fountain to open the room's exit gates. Drinking from the fountain restores a percentage of your health. (You must drink from the fountain even if you are at max health, or if it would offer you no health due to the Pact of Punishment.)\nStairways/Adjoining Chambers.\nStairway chambers spawn after boss chambers, and separate two separate biomes. Stairway chambers will always contain a fountain which heals a percentage of your health. After using the fountain, a Well of Charon and Pool of Purging will unlock in the shop, as well as a Keepsake Cabinet, allowing you to swap to a different keepsake for the next biome. \nNPC Chambers.\nSome biomes have various NPC chambers which can be found while exploring. Currently, there are three NPC chambers in \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;\": &lt;a href=\"Sisyphus\"&gt;Sisyphus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eurydice\"&gt;Eurydice&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Patroclus\"&gt;Patroclus&lt;/a&gt;. Sisyphus can only be found in Tartarus, Eurydice in Asphodel, and Patroclus in Elysium. Each chamber can be encountered in a run, but each chamber can only be encountered one time in a run. For more detail on what these chambers offer, visit their NPC's respective pages.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nTartarus=\nAsphodel=\nElysium=\nTemple of Styx=\nChaos=\nErebus=\nOceanus=\nFields of Mourning=\nHouse of Hades=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

{"id": "711", "revid": "47838920", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=711", "title": "Chaos", "text": "Chaos is the embodiment of the primordial void from which &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Primordials\"&gt;Primordials&lt;/a&gt; arose. They offer &lt;a href=\"boons\"&gt;boons&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; which, unlike the instant boosts offered by the Olympian gods, trade a debuff for a certain number of encounters in exchange for greater power further down the line.\nChaos resides within the &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Gate\"&gt;Chaos Gates&lt;/a&gt; sometimes found within chambers. \nChaos returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;\" and offers their boons to &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; in her fight against &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nThis primordial spectator is the keeper of secrets. They speak in a monotone and without emotion, and yet their voice seems to contain a multitude of separate voices of varying genders, all speaking in unison. Despite their eternal curiosity about existence, they have a distaste for 'small talk' and are impassive, content to merely watch Zagreus as he fights his way out of the underworld, never once trying to stop him. Chaos seems to derive amusement from this, perhaps out of boredom or sheer curiosity. They brand Dionysus as \"the drunk,\" for his unpredictability and thus act as a source of amusement for them. \nChaos will make sensitive, critical comments about the people that Zagreus meets, sometimes having knowledge of secrets known to very few due to their eternal watch over reality. They seem to have a low opinion of the Olympians believing most of them to be either too cocky or too presumptuous for their own good and that they choose to help Zagreus purely out of self-interest, rather than family loyalty. Composed, their decisions are mysterious, and Chaos doesn't like to be talked about unless they request it. When engaged in dialogue with another, often Zagreus, they will prompt the individual directly at the end of their statement by saying \"Answer.\" Nevertheless, Chaos makes it known that they do not or will not compel the individual to answer, as that is their own choice to make.\nChaos cannot be measured or quantified in any meaningful way. Furthermore, leaving their realm would potentially destabilize all of order and existence, so they just decide to watch. They were distant in their role as a parent to Nyx, much to her dismay, and after much reflection during the events of the game, they later reveal to Zagreus their remorse for this.\nChaos suggests they would miss Zagreus too, were his visits to their realm ever to cease, but also seems content merely to be an observer of reality, happily gazing eternally into existence from afar and alone.\nThey love their daughter Nyx, and regret being absent for most of her life. They also used to play hide-and-seek when they were still together.\nDespite Chaos saying that they are content to ponder the possibilities of the world they created, Chaos is grateful for being able to see glimpses of it when Zagreus wears the Chaos Aspect of the &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Aegis&lt;/a&gt;. \nChaos doesn't care for material gifts and seems happy to be alone most of the time but will give Zagreus the cosmic egg in part because they want him to visit more. Combined with Chaos secretly missing Nyx (and possibly Chaos' other children as well), Chaos seems lonelier than they admit to.\nPhysical description.\nWhile the other gods could pass for human, or at least human-like, it's immediately clear that Chaos is not of this world, yet even they have some human characteristics. Their skin is gray higher up on their body, gradually darkening to dark yellow further down, and then becoming featureless black and brown.\nThe closest Chaos has to \"normal\" in their appearance is their human head and torso. Bat-like wings are where their ears should be, and in the middle of their chest is a red stone or eye. Another large eye is on their forehead, and on that eye itself, two smaller eyes can be seen.\nWhere Chaos's abdomen and lower torso would be, and circling up their chest and behind their head, is a tangle of red-eyed, melted-together human heads, including one that's missing its upper half above the nose. Mixed in with this mass are a few bones, small plants (some with red leaves, some the same color of Chaos's skin), and a human fetus, eventually trailing down into a dark, indistinct shape. On the right side of their body is the edge of what seems to be a robe, which blends back into the mishmash of flesh and faces.\nA starry background is seen behind Chaos, and behind their head are two shapes reminiscent of a human eye, one having many colors and the other gold, all symbolizing their existence outside reality as we know it while watching our reality from beyond. Held in Chaos's right hand, between their index finger and thumb and the size of a large marble in comparison to their hand, is the planet Earth.\nIn Hades II, Chaos adopted a more solid, human-like appearance, now with a full body and pale skin. Their face is slightly more androgynous, reminiscent of Nyx's, with long hair tied in a ponytail of silvery white with streaks of pink and golden. Said ponytail is adorned with a golden halo and burgundy flowers. The small \"planet earth\" held between their fingers is now an earring on their left ear. Chaos robes appear to resemble a modern suit with gold embroidery and trim, small eye-shaped buttons on the cuffs and two skull-shaped buttons closing at ther waist with a chord, the third eye was then moved from their forehead to the lapel and many face-like shapes still visible on areas around the shoulder and arm. An eye-shaped gem now addorns their chest which seem to simply be a cosmic-like void within their suit. A gray bat wing reminiscent of the ones from the &lt;a href=\"Furies\"&gt;Furies&lt;/a&gt; springs from their back. Chaos is now holding what appears to be their old form's severed head still attached to a spinal chord with a small fetus coming out of its mouth and another flower adorning the ear.\nHistory.\nPast.\nChaos is the first living and divine being of all. They're the anthropomorphic personification of the void, matter, universe, existence and reality. Chaos resides in the space between the surface and the underworld, where the walls are thin, and can only be accessed through the &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Gate\"&gt;Chaos Gates&lt;/a&gt;.\nHades.\nThey offer their own set of boons to &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; for their inscrutable purposes.\nEpilogue.\nZagreus has the ability to invite Chaos to the gathering of Olympians if he visits them before the party occurs. Chaos will accept, and state that while they cannot appear in full, they will still arrange to appear in some capacity.\nRegardless of if they are invited or not, Chaos will state that they were amused by the gathering, and express appreciation for Zagreus\u2019 continued visits.\nZagreus can also take part in a quest to reunite &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt; and Chaos. Knowing her parent has been helping the prince, Nyx thinks of reuniting after long years apart, and Chaos thinks of the same. Zagreus is instructed he must fix the Eldest Sigil so Nyx can reach Chaos, and once he achieves that, Nyx parts for a visit. From then on out, she may be found near her parent.\nBefore Hades II.\nChaos was visited by &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;, who asked Chaos for the location of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Fates\"&gt;Three Fates&lt;/a&gt;. Chaos helped Chronos who, unaware of his scheme, used their omniscience to find the location of the Fates.\nHades II.\nChaos offers their boons to Melino\u00eb when she reaches Tartarus to help her defeat Chronos once they had learn of the Titan's duplicity.\nAffinity.\nIf given &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;, Chaos will give you the &lt;a href=\"Cosmic%20Egg\"&gt;Cosmic Egg&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce you have given Chaos 6 Nectar, you will not be able to give more gifts until you complete a favor for them.\nAfter you complete the favor, they can be gifted &lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt;, although they will not give a &lt;a href=\"Companion\"&gt;Companion&lt;/a&gt; in return.\nChaos' affinity gauge is maxed out at 8 hearts, requiring the gifting of 6 Nectar and 2 Ambrosia total.\nFavor.\nChaos' favor is part of the same event as Nyx's favor, requiring you to reunite the two of them to fulfill one of the &lt;a href=\"Fated%20List%20of%20Minor%20Prophecies\"&gt;Fated List of Minor Prophecies&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, Chaos will reveal that they tried to reach out to Nyx, per Zagreus' advice. Later on, Nyx will instruct you to upgrade the eldest sigil in the administrative chamber to serve as a bridge to Chaos, which will cost you 3142 at the &lt;a href=\"House%20Contractor\"&gt;House Contractor&lt;/a&gt;. After purchasing the upgrade, you can find Nyx in Chaos' domain, and Chaos will remark that they are pleased to be able to reconnect with their daughter. From then on, you can give Ambrosia to Chaos.\nCodex entry.\nUnlocking the complete Codex Entry requires deepening Zagreus' relationship with Chaos.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\nMerchandise=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

They come in two halves: a Curse and a Blessing, which are randomly selected. The Curse negatively affects Zagreus for a given number of encounters, after which it permanently transforms into the Blessing for the remainder of the run. The rarity of the overall boon only affects the Blessing.\nA boon's name depends on which effects were randomly chosen, with the first half being the Curse and the second half the Blessing (e.g. Pauper's Favor, Abyssal Grasp).\nUnlike other boons, you can get the same Blessing more than once in a run and the effects stack additively. Their boons cannot be upgraded with &lt;a href=\"Pom%20of%20Power\"&gt;Pom of Power&lt;/a&gt; or sold.\nThe damage inflicted by the Maimed, Flayed, and Addled Curses cannot reduce Zagreus below 1 . The animation, sound, and voice line for taking damage will still play, but his health will not actually drop.\nList of Curses.\nIf you're in the middle of a biome and trying to decide whether to accept a curse, check your current chamber number (upper right corner of the Boons screen) and be mindful of upcoming boss encounters. Bosses for the first 3 biomes appear in chambers 14, 24, and 36. The rooms immediately before them (13, 23, and 35) will always be non-combat chambers. \nWith the exception of Enshrouded, curses last for numbers of encounters (chambers with enemies) rather than chambers, so a 3-encounter curse accepted in chamber 10 would still be around for the boss fight in chamber 14 because of the shop or Pom in chamber 13. \nOr a 4-encounter curse in chamber 8 could be around for the boss fight if you get a fountain afterwards - a fight in chamber 9, fountain in 10, fights 11 and 12, and shop/Pom in 13.\nZagreus will make a comment when injured by a curse (Addled, Flayed, and Maimed) and a visual effect displaying bleeding will play. The damage from these curses has no cooldown, which means that activating their condition rapidly (for example, with a weapon with very fast fire rate) can drain large swaths of HP near instantly. These curses will not reduce your health below 1 HP, albeit the visual effect and Zagreus's comment will still play."}

It seems my asking you, and your success, was in accordance with the Fates' design, as well. The result is more amusing even than expected. Thus, thank you.\"\nKeepsake Equipped.\n Chaos: \n\"I trust the small round catalyst which I provided you has been of value, Son of Hades?

I could hasten your demise, if you so choose?\" \nDialogue 02.\n Chaos: \n\"I almost did not notice you, O Son of Hades, for you are closer now to death than life. Perhaps, though, we can stave off the inevitable for a little while.\" \nDialogue 03.\n Chaos: \n\"Your deaths are but a temporary setback, Son of Hades. Though it appears to me you are quite close to having such a setback, now.\" \nDialogue 04.\n Chaos: \n\"Your next experience with death seems to be imminent, though let us see if I can hasten or forestall it.\" \nDialogue 05.\n Chaos: \n\"It may seem cruel that I would wish you death, O Son of Hades. But from my perspective, it means you are much more likely to return to me.\" \nDialogue 06.\n Chaos: \n\"Although you may succumb soon to your injuries, please make the most of your remaining life, rather than anticipate the next. The future is uncertain to all save the Fates.\" \nGeneric Greetings.\nLong Lines.\nDialogue 01.\n Chaos: \n\"I sensed a certain rumbling here within the bowels of the earth. It is as though it had ingested something that did not sit well... perhaps the earth itself wishes to spit you up and out...?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Chaos: \n\"The Olympians are vying for your favor, are they not? So often they forget themselves. They force their blessings onto you, whilst I?

Your mother must have been one who called herself Persephone. Her stay within the Underworld was brief, from my perspective, but impactful, nonetheless. You seek her now? Respond.\" \n Zagreus: \n\"I do. She's somewhere on the surface. That's why I keep on finding you like this. I'm trying to find her.\" \n Chaos: \n\"I hope that your attempts achieve success. She is beyond my senses, presently, though of course I am still able to assist you in your journey, thus.\" \nOption B.\n Chaos: \n\"Son of Hades, I believe I have deduced something I ought have sooner recognized. Your mother must have been one who called herself Persephone. Her stay within the Underworld was brief, from my perspective, but impactful, nonetheless. You seek her now? Respond.\" \n Zagreus: \n\"Oh, Master Chaos... you should know I have located her, already. Though where she is, I cannot stay for long. So I am visiting, as often as I can. It's... not unlike our visits here. Only, somehow, even harder to get to where she is.\" \n Chaos: \n\"I see. Then, it is good to know that you have been in contact. And I trust that your successive visits shall be worth their while. Not unlike our visits here.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Chaos: \n\"Son of Hades, if you locate the one who called herself Persephone, shall it then come to pass that we no longer see each other in this way? Respond.\" \n Zagreus: \n\"Oh! I... Master Chaos, I don't know what to expect from there. But, to be direct with you, if I could leave the Underworld forever... I think I would. Though, I would miss you. Many others here.\" \n Chaos: \n\"...I would miss you as well. Thank you for telling me.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos: \n\"Your father and his brothers, when they sealed the Titans in the darkest reaches of this world, that was the last they saw of me, as well. You are dissimilar from them, and I feel safe communicating thus with you.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01 (Before Triggering Quest).\n Chaos: \n\"I understand that Zeus and all his kin on Mount Olympus think that you are born of Hades and the goddess Nyx? I was amused to learn of this deception. Nyx has mothered many of the Underworld's own, so, why not you?\" \n Zagreus: \n\"She isn't my birthmother, no, but she is like a mother to me. Do you know her?\" \n Chaos: \n\"Oh, I know the goddess Nyx quite well, of course. Though, it has been a while since we last communicated, and I fear... well, I was not the charitable sort, back then. It is my hope that Nyx is faring well.\" \nDialogue 02 (Before Triggering Quest).\n Chaos: \n\"I knew you would arrive. But only in the moments prior to the fact. Thus, I am experiencing residual surprise. Your movements through the Underworld are as though a veil of darkness enshrouds you. The goddess Nyx's influence, perhaps? Respond.\" \n Zagreus: \n\"I... do not know how to respond to that, exactly, Master Chaos, but, Nyx, yes, she has been aiding me, in my attempts to flee my father's realm.\" \n Chaos: \n\"You move in darkness, not as infinitely black as hers, but reminiscent to me, nonetheless. I would invite her to try to elude me, and then attempt to locate her. A minor amusement for the both of us. Now, I have you for this, I see.\" \nDialogue 03 (Before Triggering Quest).\n Chaos: \n\"I was at times uncharitable with the goddess Nyx, when we were closer, long ago. After she bore her first children, I nevertheless expected her attention to remain undivided. I kept creating. When finally I slowed, I realized my mistake. But our connection had been severed, by that point.\" \nDialogue 04 (Before Triggering Quest).\n Chaos: \n\"Son of Hades, should eventually you spawn your own offspring... I recommend maintaining sub-infinite distances with them in space and time. Even if they are most tiresome, there always seems to come a point when one wishes to be in their presence once again.\" \nDialogue 05 (Before Restoring the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//hades.fandom.com/wiki/House_Contractor%23%3A~%3Atext%3DEldest%2520Sigil%2520Restoration\"&gt;Eldest Sigil&lt;/a&gt;).\n Chaos: \n\"After some consideration, and on your recommendation, I attempted lately to make contact with the goddess Nyx again. She is quite distant from me now, of course. If you happen to know... did she receive the message well? Respond.\" \n Zagreus: \n\"Well, Master Chaos, she can be a little difficult to read at times, but... I got the impression she was quite surprised, even excited to have heard from you again. She said that she would think about how to respond. Or, whether to respond.\" \n Chaos: \n\"I see. Well, she shall find a way, if it is warranted. I always did expect the world from her. There were times when I expected her to shine as bright as day, though she is Night. When she achieved a certain level of ability... she left. And I could not find her.\" \nDialogue 06 (Before Restoring the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//hades.fandom.com/wiki/House_Contractor%23%3A~%3Atext%3DEldest%2520Sigil%2520Restoration\"&gt;Eldest Sigil&lt;/a&gt;).\n Chaos: \n\"I sense that something is the matter, Son of Hades. Speak, then, what is on your mind? I can decipher some of it without your telling though would rather hear it from you voluntarily.\" \n Zagreus: \n\"\"Erm\", Master Chaos? The goddess Nyx, she... seems to want to speak with you again. I wonder, would you maybe contact her sometime? She seems convinced it is your move to make if you so choose.\" \n Chaos: \n\"The goddess Nyx wishes to hear from me...? Now that is unexpected, Son of Hades, and I wonder if, perhaps, this is a jest of yours. Though, your intentions evidently are sincere. Then, I shall make no promises in this, except that... I am considering the possibility.\" \nDialogue 07 (After Restoring the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//hades.fandom.com/wiki/House_Contractor%23%3A~%3Atext%3DEldest%2520Sigil%2520Restoration\"&gt;Eldest Sigil&lt;/a&gt;).\n Chaos: \n\"I have detected some unusual activity within the reaches of the Underworld, Son of Hades... vast sums of Darkness, collected in an ancient catalyst, which I see now almost like a beacon, shining in the night. This either is the work of Nyx, or you, or both. I am anticipating the result.\" \nDialogue 08 (After Nyx's First Visit).\n Chaos: \n\"It pleases me immensely, Son of Hades, to have seen the goddess Nyx again. The significant amount of time that has elapsed since last this happened dulled sufficiently old pains, I think. Thus, it becomes a basis on which our connection may, in time, take shape again.\" \nDialogue 09 (After Nyx's Visits).\n Chaos: \n\"My daughter, the goddess Nyx. When I learned the Olympians mistakenly assumed she was your mother, I did not fully consider the possibility that she essentially was a mother to you... the technicality of birth, aside. She cares for you to the extent a mother can.\" \nDialogue 10 (After Nyx's Visits).\n Chaos: \n\"Prior to your intervention, Son of Hades, I expected that the goddess Nyx had forgotten about me... whether purposefully, or from passage of time. I believed that to be forgotten was the one true inevitability. Perhaps, however, I was incorrect.\" \nDialogue 11 (After Nyx's Visits).\n Chaos: \n\"I find that it is difficult maintaining my connection with many consciousnesses, such as yours, and that of the goddess Nyx. Yet I am also finding that this difficulty is fully warranted. Our connections give me much to consider as I await our next exchange.\" \nThe &lt;a href=\"Fates\"&gt;Fates&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos: \n\"How strange it is to be subjected to the Fates. But do not fall into the cognitive delusion that they have already made your choices for you, Son of Hades. Rather, they are keen about anticipating every choice that everyone shall make. Such as the following.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Olympians\"&gt;Olympians&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Chaos: \n\"You have met many of the Olympians by now, each spurring you toward their mountaintop. They place such value on familial bonds, yet none of them remember who I am. Do not place too much faith in them, O Son of Hades.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Chaos: \n\"I ask you listen but not speak, O Son of Hades, whilst the Olympians? They do not ask at all. They merely send their messages to you, unprompted, providing a choice of blessing, but no say. I seek to understand their point of view. But it is difficult.\" \nDialogue 03.\n Chaos: \n\"When you extend an offering to the Olympians, for a fleeting instant, it appears as though they are able to hear your prayer. Or so I have observed. How interesting that your thoughts are capable of breaking free, yet you cannot.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos: \n\"You bear the blessing of the great Lord Zeus. He still believes he holds dominion over both heaven and earth. I think, perhaps, he has forgotten about me.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos: \n\"The charms of goddess Aphrodite are upon you unmistakably, although I shall be curious to see if her command over one's sense of love shall have any effect beneath the earth.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos: \n\"I understand the hunting-goddess Artemis recently has turned her gaze towards you. It is unexpected she would offer her assistance, even to a relative in need.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos: \n\"This wise goddess Athena has imbued you with her charms, I see, O Son of Hades. Perhaps to her you are a tool with which her broken family may as yet be mended.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos: \n\"It is not unexpected that you consorted with the violent Ares, and now bear his Boon. He still worships me, you know; yet, I would say he does not know me very well.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos: \n\"The drunkard Dionysus offered you his services, I see? He can be rather unpredictable, and therefore offers me a source of some amusement.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos: \n\"Swift Hermes spurs you on, I see, O Son of Hades. Beware the narrow distance between hastiness and swiftness; a distinction I am not so sure the god of travel fully understands.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos: \n\"Lord Poseidon offered you his blessing, it would seem. He can be rather boastful and belligerent, exhibiting the most unattractive manners of your father and Lord Zeus alike.\" \n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos: \n\"Embittered Demeter has reached you, hasn't she? She once was full of warmth, you know; but lately, as I understand, she is more prone to taking it away.\" \nWith Other Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Chaos: \n\"Your presence is appreciated, Son of Hades, but please leave us here, for now.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Chaos: \n\"Forgive us, Son of Hades, as we are amid exchanging memories.\" \nDialogue 03.\n Chaos: \n\"Son of Hades, I am pleased the goddess Nyx returned to me.\" \nDialogue 04.\n Chaos: \n\"Forgive me, Son of Hades, but I must continue this discussion with the goddess Nyx.\" \nDialogue 05.\n Chaos: \n\"I had not seen the goddess Nyx in quite some time.\"\nDialogue 06.\n Chaos: \n\"I am quite unaccustomed to having all this company of late.\" \nDialogue 07.\n Chaos: \n\"My daughter was just in the midst of telling me the latest occurrences about your House.\"\nDialogue 08.\n Chaos: \n\"As you are able to observe, the goddess Nyx and I are in the midst of conversation now.\" \nBeing Invited to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt; (Pre-Epilogue).\n Chaos: \n\"Again I sensed some sort of shifting in your father's residence. You seek to ask something of me about it, do you not? Respond.\" \n Zagreus: \n\"Oh, I'm glad you asked, it's just... my mother, she's... we're reaching out to the Olympians. Trying to reconnect the family. It's been a while, relatively, since she and Father saw the others, but... in case a gathering occurs, I did wish you to know you're cordially invited, too.\" \n Chaos: \n\"Cordially invited...? A generous proposal, Son of Hades, though unless your gathering is to occur within my space, please understand it would be difficult for me to bring the full entirety of my presence there. However... I think I can arrange to be with you in some capacity. Thank you.\" \nPost-Epilogue Dialogue.\nDialogue 01 (Invited).\n Chaos: \n\"It pleases me your gathering of the Olympians occurred. I must inform you... I had never once before detected quite so many of my offspring in a single space. At least not without violent intent. I appreciate that you included me, and that you have returned. Shall we continue, then?\" \nDialogue 02 (Not Invited).\n Chaos: \n\"It pleases me your gathering of the Olympians occurred. I must inform you... I had never once before detected quite so many of my offspring in a single space. At least not without violent intent.\" \nMiscellaneous Conversations.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; Improving the &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20of%20Night\"&gt;Mirror of Night&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Chaos: \n\"Such darkness emanates from you, O Son of Hades, that I once again did not entirely anticipate you would arrive just now. I suspect even your father must have difficulty keeping track of you through the domain he calls his own.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Chaos: \n\"You move in darkness, practically unseen, Son of Hades. It is quite difficult even for me to sense your presence at times. The Olympians catch their glimpses now and then. But you are always in a shroud. Thus is the influence of Nyx.\" \nBuying Boon at &lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;'s Shop.\nDialogue 01.\n Chaos: \n\"Perhaps you did not think that I would seek you out among the boatman Charon's trifles, which precisely is the reason I have done it.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Chaos: \n\"The boatman Charon understands my whims, and his loyalty is purchased easily by one for whom base wealth is meaningless, so, I am here.\" \nAbout &lt;a href=\"Black%20Shawl\"&gt;Nyx's Keepsake&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Chaos: \n\"You have arrived within a certain shroud of darkness, Son of Hades. The goddess Nyx's ancient shawl. I had not sensed its void in a considerable amount of time.\" \nPost-Flashback Dialogue.\nDialogue 01.\n Chaos: \n\"Have you grown trusting yet of the Olympians, for all their generosity? Perhaps you ought to let them know the truth about your journey's goal. They are vain, and think that it is them you seek.\" \n Zagreus: \n\"I'll never get out of here if not for their help, but... I can't let them know about Mother. She wants to remain hidden from them.\" \n Chaos: \n\"A difficult position to be in, Son of Hades. The Olympians may not appreciate being misled. But you can trust that I shall keep your secret. I wish to see how your predicament plays out.\"\nPost-Ending Dialogue.\nDialogue 01.\n Chaos: \n\"Lately, Son of Hades, I have sensed what I would call a sort of shift within your father's residence. Did something noteworthy occur, perhaps? Respond.\" \n Zagreus: \n\"Master Chaos, it's Persephone, my mother. She's returned! She's chosen to return. So... things feel different, certainly, with her around, although... I didn't feel any sort of shift.\" \n Chaos: \n\"You may not sense these shifts as I. The lightness of this space bends and adjusts with time. What you describe... it must have been the cause. I trust that the occasion is a welcome one. And I am pleased that you returned, nevertheless.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Chaos: \n\"Tell me something, Son of Hades. If the one who called herself Persephone is back, then... why do you continue to return? Respond.\" \n Zagreus: \n\"Master Chaos, it seems I've developed something of a talent around breaking out of here. Or, there, I mean, the Underworld, so... it's become more of an official role for me, I guess. If escape shouldn't be possible, then someone needs to find the gaps.\" \n Chaos: \n\"Indeed. Then, you shall visit with me still, despite accomplishing the principal object of your journey back when first we met. Good.\" \nAbout Responding.\nDialogue 01.\n Chaos: \n\"As we become acquainted, Son of Hades, I shall make myself quite clear in one respect: I fear I have a lack of patience for discussion. When visiting, please merely listen, then accept my mark, and then depart. Respond only when necessary. Or when prompted. Yes?\" \n Zagreus: \n\"...Merely listen, so it's just like when I get those messages from the Olympians. Wait, you did just prompt me, Master Chaos, didn't you? Or should I have remained silent just now?\" \n Chaos: \n\"I cannot offer you advice. But you were prompted, yes. You may speak freely, then, or anytime, despite my wishes that you not do so. Absolute silence is my general preference. It may not be yours.\" \nAbout Infinity.\nDialogue 01.\n Chaos: \n\"I sense your consternation, Son of Hades, as you look about this space; you have another question, and are free to ask.\" \n Zagreus: \n\"Oh, it's just... I sometimes wonder, Master Chaos... if you created all of this, then... who created \"you\"? What was this place before you arrived?\" \n Chaos: \n\"All of this simply came to be, and so did I, presumably after a former time had finally reached its end. I hesitate to say it was an act of will. It was more like a sudden shift, as when a conflagration happens from a spark. I arrived at such a time, and all else then arrived, from me.\"\nAbout Death.\nDialogue 01.\n Chaos: \n\"When you expire, and then suddenly return to life within your father's residence, perhaps it is akin to when I first gained consciousness so long ago. Perhaps I, too, had just expired, only to reawaken.\" \nAbout Discovery.\nDialogue 01.\n Chaos: \n\"You may have wondered, Son of Hades, how it is you came to find me in this space, when I have gone unseen by most for quite some time. I have wondered this, as well, and think that our connection to Goddess Nyx is the most likely answer.\" \nAbout Fishing (Legendary Catch).\nDialogue 01.\n Chaos: \n\"I am impressed that you were able to procure a specimen out from the flowing currents here in my domain, with nothing but a simple instrument. I shall look forward to your subsequent attempts.\"\nAbout The Styx.\nDialogue 01.\n Chaos: \n\"You have traveled recently beyond my senses, Son of Hades. I persist here only in the fathomless depths. I know what lies out there, having created it. But I know nothing of what it is like, right now. Do not tell me. I prefer to think of all the possibilities.\" \nAbout &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;' Task.\nDialogue 01.\n Chaos: \n\"From the rumblings of the earth, I have deduced your father, himself, stands against you when at last you are about to leave these depths. It must be quite an interaction between you. Have I deduced correctly? Respond.\" \n Zagreus: \n\"That's right, Master Chaos. My father personally takes it upon himself to stop me in the event none of his underlings beat him to it. He... can be a handful.\" \n Chaos: \n\"Well, then. Consider bringing to one of your future interactions the small round catalyst, which I provided you. The one in the shape you call an egg? It shall serve no purpose there at all. Yet if you succeed, then it shall bring us some amusement, shall it not?\"\nAbout Weapons.\nDialogue 01 (&lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Aegis&lt;/a&gt;).\n Chaos: \n\"You come to my domain bearing an all-seeing artifact that sprang from me after the dawn of time. It is considered a defensive instrument, I do believe. Though, I suspect you have discovered, or soon shall discover, it is nothing of the sort.\" \nAbout Aspects.\nDialogue 01 (&lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Chaos%23Aspects\"&gt;Aspect of Beowul&lt;/a&gt;).\n Chaos: \n\"I sense that you have not yet spoken with the all-seeing artifact you call Aegis. Tamper with the Fates' design, then, all you like. But if you change your mind, do speak the words to it: \"I see you stand your ground against the serpent's flame.\"\" \nDialogue 02 (&lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Chaos%23Aspects\"&gt;Aspect of Beowul&lt;/a&gt;).\n Chaos: \n\"You have not yet used the waking-phrase that I imparted? Or perhaps you merely chose not to present me the result. I would quite like to see it, at some point. Remember, Son of Hades: Say to the all-seeing artifact, \"I see you stand your ground against the serpent's flame.\"\" \nDialogue 03 (&lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Chaos%23Aspects\"&gt;Aspect of Beowul&lt;/a&gt;).\n Chaos: \n\"Out of the infinitely spanning possibilities, here before me stands the Son of Hades, bearing my all-seeing artifact, appearing in the aspect of a bearer yet unborn, who shall be known throughout the north as Beowulf. How very droll.\" \nDialogue 04 (&lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Chaos%23Aspects\"&gt;Aspect of Beowul&lt;/a&gt;).\n Chaos: \n\"I bear a message for you, Son of Hades. One recorded in an age when certain concepts it describes did not yet all exist. Remember this: \"I see you stand your ground against the serpent's flame. \"A waking-phrase, to which you and the all-seeing artifact of my creation may respond.\" \n Zagreus: \n\"A waking-phrase... and an all-seeing artifact, you must mean Aegis, right? So I'm to say to it, \"I see you stand your ground against the serpent's flame\", and it'll wake right up. Though, can you tell me what it means, or who?\" \n Chaos: \n\"Oh, I can tell you almost anything. However, I would much prefer it if you learned most of the answers you seek by yourself.\" \nDialogue 05 (&lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Chaos%23Aspects\"&gt;Aspect of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;).\n Chaos: \n\"I expected your arrival, Son of Hades. For I am able to see through you. Rather, through the all-seeing artifact, which sprang from me after the dawn of time, and now resembles, in your hands, its foremost form. Respond.\" \n Zagreus: \n\"What, you must mean the Shield of Chaos, here? \"Your \"shield, Master Chaos, I should say. It's a remarkable artifact. Imposing, too! Your original creations must have been astounding.\" \n Chaos: \n\"Your response is acceptable. And I am grateful to have had my recent firsthand glimpses of this vast domain.\" \nDialogue 05 (&lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Chaos%23Aspects\"&gt;Aspect of Zeus&lt;/a&gt;).\n Chaos: \n\"Ah, you have that all-seeing artifact of mine, but in the old guise that the great Lord Zeus once used when he retaliated violently against his parentage. I watched his movements through it for some time.\" \nGifts.\n&lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Master Chaos? Everyone makes offerings to my relatives upon Olympus. I wish to make an offering to you. Thank you for... everything.\" \n Chaos: \n\"How droll of you to make attempts to tempt me with material things. Here, then, please in turn allow me this attempt at reciprocity.\" \n\"Chaos gives &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Cosmic%20Egg\"&gt;Cosmic Egg&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Master Chaos, thank you.\"\n2nd Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"This is for you, Master Chaos. Everyone beneath the heavens and earth enjoys this stuff.\"\n Chaos: \n\"You honor me in making such an offering, though please; it is not necessary to endear yourself using material means, for it is the thought alone which counts.\" \n3rd Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Master Chaos, forebear of the gods, it is an honor to have met you. Please, accept this gift.\" \n Chaos: \n\"Seldom do mortals or immortals think of making offerings to me. As I do not expect such token gestures, I am very much amused, and I accept.\" \n4th Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Master Chaos, I pledge never to forget you or your good graces. May your wisdom and your whim forever guide me.\" \n Chaos: \n\"Is this an offering of fealty or friendship, Son of Hades? I do not wish to know from you the answer, so that I might dwell on it and all the possibilities.\" \n5th Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"I'm ever-grateful that my journeys through the Underworld mean that we can get to know each other, Master Chaos.\" \n Chaos: \n\"Your repeated generosity with me is starting to become a bit predictable, and yet... somehow, I nonetheless appreciate it, still. How very odd.\" \n6th Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Master Chaos, it's little wonder all existence sprang from you, because I see the noble qualities in so many I've met embodied in you. Please, accept this gift.\" \n Chaos: \n\"If it is unclear yet, Son of Hades, I shall not be giving more to you in exchange for your repeated offerings. You give them to me knowing it shall serve no purpose and achieve no end. I know that there are some among both mortals and your kind for whom this is quite unacceptable.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"This is the greatest delicacy of Olympus, Master Chaos. It's for you. I think normally it would be difficult for the Olympians to get it to you here.\" \n Chaos: \n\"You make an even greater offering to me, knowing it shall produce no material result. You are aware that I am not persuadable? Yours is a squandering of resources and time. Although, of course, we do have each of these in great supply. Now then, respond.\" \n Zagreus: \n\"...I just think the act of giving isn't quite the same as an exchange. I know I won't be getting any sort of other talisman or something in return. But, through these offerings, I can express my thanks. That's worth it by itself.\" \n Chaos: \n\"...I see. So then, the action is akin to theft. For you are getting something in return that I did not intend to give. I still have much to learn from my creations, Son of Hades. So let us say that we have made an even trade. My learning for your worth.\" \n2nd Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"If you'll forgive me, Master Chaos, this Ambrosia is intended to be given to those whom I care about, and I can think of few recipients I'd like to have it more. Please.\" \n Chaos: \n\"I shall accept this, as a final offering, O Son of Hades. For I have given it additional consideration, and decided that my previous analysis of your intentions was too narrow, too inaccurate. And, I regret comparing what you have been doing to an act of theft. Respond?\" \n Zagreus: \n\"Don't even mention it, please, Master Chaos. All of this is new for me, as well. I try never to overanalyze... my father does enough of that for all of us. I just know, when I encounter the primordial creator, I am going to give thanks. For everything.\" \n Chaos: \n\"...I see. Then, your response is quite acceptable. And, since the act of giving is not an exchange, let us say that you already had my gratitude.\" "}

Well, \"in the name of Hades! Olympus... \"are you there...?\"\n Chaos : \n\"Olympus cannot hear you, Spawn of Hades. But I can. And I have for you a proposition: Assist with a quandary of mine, and benefit. Your response?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Almighty Chaos...! I'm honored to make your acquaintance. Wh-what sort of quandary would concern the Origin of All Existence...? And, how do I fit in?\"\n Chaos : \n\"Time shall tell. But at present, I have inferred that your response, in essence, was affirmative. Thus, may our newly formed arrangement prove most interesting. Accept my mark, and go; and later I shall open the abyss for you again.\"\nKeepsake Dialogue (&lt;a href=\"Transcendent%20Embryo\"&gt;Transcendent Embryo&lt;/a&gt;).\n Chaos : \n\"You bear the Embryo I gave to you. It creates an impression as though a part of me is with you, even whilst you are absent from this space. You may continue to make use of it, or not.\"\nReactions.\nSeeing &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; at Low Health.\nDialogue 01.\n\"You have suffered in your journey to reach me. Perhaps I should reward your struggle; or hasten your likely failure. You shall have to decide.\"\nDialogue 02.\n\"I created life, which later gave rise to death; so I can sense how close you are now to the latter state. Even if your godhood means that you can never truly die, it must be quite unpleasant.\"\nDialogue 03.\n\"Your present ailments are not beyond my notice. Perhaps it was unwise of you to visit me within this space whilst you are in such a state. Though I have also made mistakes before.\"\nDialogue 04.\n\"I understand that physical injuries, such as the ones you have sustained, mean little to you gods. Though even gods are able to withstand only so much. Thus, caution is advised.\"\nAbout Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Chaos : \n\"Time, of course, did not always exist. Chronos provided a means of measuring the rate at which everything grew and changed, or did not. He was quite useful by his very nature. But Time can be a source of problems, too, I know.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Chaos : \n\"I believe that I am an impartial being, Spawn of Hades. However, even I can be provoked, as Chronos soon shall come to realize. Our experiment concerns his fate; if he believes that he can change his fate, then so may we.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Chaos : \n\"I shall hold Chronos to account for what has come to pass. But I am not without blame, myself. For I fear that I made present matters worse. We shall see whether any such mistakes can be corrected.\"\nDialogue 04.\n Chaos : \n\"In retrospect, I ought not have permitted Chronos to speak with me, but he was persuasive. I still do not fully understand how you communicate; what you say is not always what you mean, and your intentions may be carefully veiled. So I pay closer notice now.\"\nDialogue 05 (Won Battle).\n Chaos : \n\"There was a certain rumbling I felt within the depths... you reached your destination, did you not? Confronted Chronos, and prevailed. And yet his influence remains. But perhaps the Titan shall relinquish control with further persuasion.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Chaos : \n\"The Fates' designs for us perhaps are intertwined. For we each seek our close kin. I have lost contact with my spawn and daughter, Nyx, who resided in your father's House. Her influence remains, yet I feel her absence...\"\nDialogue 02.\n Chaos : \n\"If Chronos holds the goddess Nyx as captive in your father's House, along with other members of her family and yours, then I would like for that to change. Perhaps he shall release them if you use sufficient violence.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Fates\"&gt;The Fates&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos : \n\"The weavings of the Fates are said to bind both mortals and immortals alike. The course and outcome of all lives, all preordained. Thus the sense of choice is merely an illusion. Do you believe this, Spawn of Hades? Respond.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I think the Fates determine much about our lives... when and where we are born, for instance, and to whom. But I don't think they set every detail. And, I know they're not weaving at all right now... because Chronos has them.\"\n Chaos : \n\"I see. For the most part, I concur with your assessment. I am the reason Chronos has them now. He asked me where to find them, and I decided to tell him; to verify such choices could be made without their influence. Now do you understand my quandary? Respond...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Oh, no. Almighty Chaos, you were deceived! Chronos wished to find the Fates for his own gain. They were one of the only forces in this world powerful enough to stop him.\"\n Chaos : \n\"Yet they are not so powerful as they appeared. Nevertheless, I think you are correct. Chronos indicated his intentions were benign. I am unfamiliar with deceit, and was misled. I remain quite displeased about this still.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Chaos : \n\"Recently a daughter of Nyx entered my domain. Such is her likeness that I mistook her for her mother-goddess at first, for many beings appear similar to me. I shall permit her here.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Chaos : \n\"That daughter of Nyx resembling her mother-goddess is assisting with my quandary, much like you. She is dutiful, but some offspring are not. Perhaps I should have ensured all obeyed; but that would not be quite as interesting.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos : \n\"One of the offspring of the goddess Nyx, the one called Strife... I find it interesting Nyx spawned one such as her, but then, we all make mistakes. I acknowledge all that I have wrought can be seen as disorderly as well.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos : \n\"You come from a domain not of the surface nor the Underworld, but between. The caretaker of that domain I have seen occasionally for some time, and serves the goddess Nyx; you are reminiscent of her to me.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos : \n\"I cannot know what it is like to meet one's creator, but you may, and perhaps have. Your father is no longer in his residence, where I sense much has changed. Yet he is not far from there. Perhaps I shall assist you in locating him.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos : \n\"I am aware the goddess of the hunt has lately plied her trade at the boundaries between realms. Artemis was not always so bold; but it is little wonder she was drawn deeper into shadow. You seem to know each other well.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hephaestus\"&gt;Hephaestus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos : \n\"The blessing of Hephaestus is upon you. The god of the forge fashions arms and armor fit for war, whilst I created the very things he uses for his trade. No one's work is solely their own, Spawn of Hades.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos : \n\"Does there remain a place for beauty and for objects of desire in a world such as this? The goddess Aphrodite must think so, and you work now as allies. I believe it a worthwhile cause; this world was born of a certain desire, after all.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos : \n\"You bear the blessing of the King of the Olympians himself. I expected that he would have been too preoccupied to be of direct assistance, although he does have a vested interest in your victory...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos : \n\"You know the one called Queen Hera of Olympus. She has a certain power over creation, herself. Mortals worship her, begging her favor as they bond and bring their offspring into being. She must enjoy the attention.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos : \n\"You have been visited by Lord Poseidon. The waters that he claims are his, they were among the first of my creations, and turned out rather well I think. I wonder if he comprehends the extent of the power they conceal.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos : \n\"The golden son of Zeus has given you his blessing, I see. Apollo was not always so willing to involve himself in your family's struggles. Perhaps the present matter gives him little choice.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hestia\"&gt;Hestia&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos : \n\"Even the goddess Hestia has lent you her power. She typically has been content merely to stoke the little flames warming the hearths of mortal homes. But now those flames threaten to spread beyond even her control.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos : \n\"The goddess Demeter is set for war, and lends to you her wrathful strength. The mother of your mother has experience fighting Titans... her predecessors. You all have grown so numerous that very little common ground remains.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos : \n\"We have eternity to conduct our experiment. I am unconvinced as to whether the results shall come more quickly with the haste of Hermes benefiting you. That is another facet to explore.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Selene\"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos : \n\"Selene rides across the sky, yet her attentions she directs towards you. Perhaps she is wondering, \"what is the Moon without Night? \"Yet I suspect that she is capable in Nyx's absence.\"\nAbouth the Scenery.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01 (Penalty).\n Chaos : \n\"When you return to shadow, I briefly sense your presence in the infinite abyss. So I have seen that the servant of the Three Fates found you in that hidden place. He relayed to you a secret, did he not? Respond.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You mean Moros. His secret was about the surface... about how I can survive up there. I know this goes against the Fates' designs, but Olympus needs me. And to achieve my task, I need \"them.\"\n Chaos : \n\"I see. As you may know, I am uninterested in the Fates having undue influence. Perhaps you may find a catalyst here for this incantation. Whether they like it or not.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Chaos : \n\"Recently I found myself unable to detect you much at all, and deduced that you must have completed your forbidden incantation. Thus the surface is laid bare to you. Perhaps I shall ask you to describe it to me sometime.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Chaos : \n\"Your ability to reach beyond the boundaries that the Fates placed upon you proved inspiring to me. After some consideration, I discovered how to call upon you even from the surface of this world. I find it rather interesting there.\"\nDialogue 04.\n Chaos : \n\"Perhaps I ought to start over again: That is what I think when I observe all that has transpired on the surface of this world. Eventually I expect I shall, though for now, I permit my offspring to continue to multiply and interact as they will.\"\nDialogue 05.\n Chaos : \n\"You have been exploring the surface of this world, where my influence is comparatively limited. I was amused to consider the possibilities, though I did anticipate you would return.\"\nMiscellaneous Conversations.\nOffering Boon at The Start of a Run (Any).\nDialogue 01.\n Chaos : \n\"As you commence your evening's pursuit, you may be best prepared to receive my mark and overcome its undesirable effects. Subsequently you shall have more opportunity to test the limits of the possibilities that it creates.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Chaos : \n\"You need not venture far to find me, Spawn of Hades. For I am everywhere, particularly where the darkness coalesces into seeming nothingness. Perhaps we shall see each other again when you are closer to your goal.\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; Completing A Run (&lt;a href=\"The%20Underworld\"&gt;The Underworld&lt;/a&gt;).\nDialogue 01.\n Chaos : \n\"There was a recent moment when Time briefly ceased to be, and I alone could tell. I believe this coincided with your confrontation with Chronos. Now you return to me, attempting to repeat the same outcome. Interesting.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Chaos : \n\"You recently entered your father's residence within the Underworld's depths, but did not remain there. Did you at least discover what you sought? Do not respond; I am considering all the potential truths.\"\nAbout Life.\n Chaos : \n\"When I created life, I had my doubts: Would it invite more problems than it solved? I would be curious to see. Thus my experiment continues to unfold; its outcome, yet uncertain.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Almighty Chaos... with your experiment so vast in scope, what can one individual achieve? The quandary you mentioned when first we met... what would you have me do?\"\n Chaos : \n\"Spawn of Hades, I ought to clarify I do not care for idle talk. Ask me no questions. Respond only when prompted, or when necessary in absolute. But above all, do as you will.\"\nAbout The &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Trials\"&gt;Chaos Trials&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01 (Granting The &lt;a href=\"https%3A//hades.fandom.com/wiki/Cauldron%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dof%2520Peace.-%2CAbyssal%2520Insight%2C-Activate%2520the%2520Pitch\"&gt;Abyssal Insight&lt;/a&gt; Incantation).\n Chaos : \n\"To make the most of our arrangement, I bid you activate a certain artifact where you reside. Within the pitch-black facets of this standing-stone are possibilities to be explored. I shall reveal how to see them all, but first...\"\nDialogue 02 (Not Yet Activating the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//hades.fandom.com/wiki/The_Crossroads/Training_Grounds%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dbetween%2520the%2520gateways.-%2CThe%2520Pitch%252DBlack%2520Stone%2C-The%2520Pitch%252DBlack\"&gt;Pitch-Black Stone&lt;/a&gt;).\n Chaos : \n\"I sense that you have not yet activated the pitch-black standing-stone as I requested earlier. You may take as long as you wish to do so. Our experiment proceeds nevertheless.\"\nDialogue 03 (Activating the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//hades.fandom.com/wiki/The_Crossroads/Training_Grounds%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dbetween%2520the%2520gateways.-%2CThe%2520Pitch%252DBlack%2520Stone%2C-The%2520Pitch%252DBlack\"&gt;Pitch-Black Stone&lt;/a&gt;).\n Chaos : \n\"You have restored the standing-stone where you reside, and now can see the possibilities within. Should you assist me in exploring my ability to determine outcomes like the Fates themselves, I shall make it worth your while.\"\nDialogue 04.\n Chaos : \n\"I anticipated speaking to you thus as you explore the possibilities within the standing-stone. Perhaps you see them as a series of important missions to complete; but they are merely part of our experiment.\"\nDialogue 05.\n Chaos : \n\"Perhaps I should not actively participate within the Trials of my own design, for I unduly influence the outcome. But I believe this way, it shall be much more interesting for us both.\"\nDialogue 06.\n Chaos : \n\"The Trials I devised all begin precisely as planned; but from that point, not even I can influence the outcomes entirely. For instance, I did not expect to find \"you \"here, Spawn of Hades.\"\nDialogue 07.\n Chaos : \n\"You have completed a number of the Trials I have put before you, Spawn of Hades. I would offer you my gratitude, except I thought my Star Dust would be of more use.\"\nDialogue 08.\n Chaos : \n\"Your usage of the pitch-black standing stone enables me to temporarily emerge from my abyss, and I thank you for that. I can observe more clearly, both the outcome of your Trial, and all else.\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Star%20Dust\"&gt;Star Dust&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos : \n\"The act of creation is not always pristine. The residue of it you know as Star Dust, which retains some power over consciousness. Consider it an incentive to look upon the standing-stone and undertake the Trials you see there.\"\nAbout The &lt;a href=\"Oath%20of%20the%20Unseen\"&gt;Oath of the Unseen&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos : \n\"I sensed the growing influence of the goddess Nyx; as though my daughter plunged the world into deeper darkness recently. Yet it was not she who did this; I believe it was you.\"\nAbout Weapons.\n Chaos : \n\"I recognize the artifacts you bear. Their brother-weapons of infernal origin drink deep the blood of Titans and grow strong, whilst these? Fate-forged servants of the Underworld that thrive on pure Nightmare itself.\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Gate\"&gt;Chaos Gate&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Chaos : \n\"I understand entering gateways to my domain is not a pleasant sensation, and my mark by its nature yields mixed results. Thus I ask myself why you often venture here; perhaps you merely wish to look upon me thus.\"\nDialogue 02 (&lt;a href=\"https%3A//hades.fandom.com/wiki/Well_of_Charon%23%3A~%3Atext%3DInstant-%2CLight%2520of%2520Ixion%2C-Ensure%2520a%2520Chaos\"&gt;Spark of Ixion&lt;/a&gt;).\n Chaos : \n\"A Spark of Ixion brought you to me... an ember from the flame forever burning in the Underworld. Its light reveals gateways into my abyss, and relieves the common side effects of entering. I recommend continued use of it.\"\nAbout Trust.\n Chaos : \n\"Some who sought to answer my call turned out to lack the fortitude for the descent. Thus I never call on mortals anymore, and seldom anyone. For Titans and gods can be duplicitous, I know. I ask that you do not betray my trust.\"\nAbout Creation.\n Chaos : \n\"Responsibility is partly mine for all that has transpired. I attempted to create this world with a degree of care. I nurtured it. Adhered to certain principles, as might a mother and father; for I created them, too. But this world is no longer young. It persists now by its own whim.\"\nAbout Darkness.\n Chaos : \n\"Once there was Darkness all throughout the Underworld, but now... Chronos works to re-shape the realm to suit his preferences. However, there shall always be Darkness here in this space. And I have made it visible to you.\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Olympians\"&gt;Olympians&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chaos : \n\"The Olympians send you their blessings and their messages, having some limited awareness of your circumstances and your whereabouts. So shall it be with me, whilst you are here.\"\nAbout Family.\n Chaos : \n\"The Olympians often speak of family, but I do not entirely understand what they mean. All beings have a common origin, yet are not considered family. Chronos, for example: Is he family, or not?

In Greek mythology, he required a single obol - placed into the mouth before burial - as payment for his services, or else the soul in question would be left to wander the banks of the Styx for a hundred years.\nCharon's services in-game are, unfortunately, much more expensive; he functions as the game's shopkeeper, selling &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; various power-ups, healing items, and &lt;a href=\"boons\"&gt;boons&lt;/a&gt; in return for the &lt;a href=\"Charon%27s%20Obol\"&gt;obols&lt;/a&gt; he collects throughout his escape attempt. He can be found in chambers with a preview showing a brown sack, usually around the mid-length of each biome before a mini-boss encounter and at the penultimate chamber of a biome, before the boss encounter.\nHe also operates the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Charon\"&gt;Wells of Charon&lt;/a&gt; which can be randomly found throughout the Underworld.\nHe doesn't say much, communicating only in groans of various intonations, which Zagreus appears to either understand or enjoy interpreting in humorous ways. Zagreus often expresses annoyance that Charon apparently either cannot or will not simply ferry him up to the surface in his boat.\nWhile all the gods (except &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt;) can use Charon's shop to offer their boons to Zagreus, &lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt; is the only god with whom Charon has a lasting professional relationship, as seen in dialog with Hermes, as well as in Hermes's Codex Entry.\nCharon returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;\" and sell his wares to &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;, this time using &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt; as currency instead of his obols as they were melted by Chronos.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nCharon, or simply the \"Boatman,\" is the main figure who transports the souls of the departed to their final destination. He remains a mystery and does not like to be persuaded or bribed, having been deceived and paid dearly for it in the past.\nCharon is a mysterious and enigmatic figure even to the rest of the inhabitants within the &lt;a href=\"The%20Underworld\"&gt;Underworld&lt;/a&gt;. However, conversations with Zagreus and other characters suggest that he is actually quite affable and reasonable, so long as he isn't deceived, and especially \"stolen\" from. Even his brothers, including &lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;, seem to fear him and dare not challenge him. When forced to confront Zagreus, Charon will demonstrate that he is not a fool and will use his paddle as an \"unlikely weapon.\" &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt; explain that he may actually enjoy having someone to fight with from time to time.\nCharon is generally antisocial even by Underworld standards. His odd friendship with &lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;, the Messenger God, is surprising as Charon manages to intimidate even the most powerful of beings within Hades' realm. \nAbove all else, Charon was also shown to be extraordinarily money-hungry, as he was obsessed with acquiring golden obols by any means necessary for reasons that were known only to him. His obsession with gold was so strong, that he would make it a point to demand payment from all of the souls that came to him before delivering them to the House of Hades. Should a soul be unfortunate enough not to have any coins on them when they die, Charon would refuse to allow them safe passage instead leaving them to rot for eternity in Erebus unable to make the rest of the trip. \nAlthough he usually does not respond to requests, he can make exceptions. Charon's sweet side was revealed afloat, when at the request of &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt;, he helped by secretly returning her and her son. Charon offered a ride on his boat from Greece to the House of Hades. During the transport, Charon remained in perpetual silence, but it was something that was very kind of him.\nPhysical description.\nCharon appears as a seedy, shadowy floating figure. He always carries his oar, and sometimes uses it as an unlikely weapon. He wears a large hat that obscures his face, revealing only one of his eyes that appears a vivid purple light. His long black clothes with golden details are lined with coins collected from his salary, the &lt;a href=\"Charon%27s%20Obol\"&gt;obols&lt;/a&gt;. His hair is dirty blond and wavy, and he exudes smoky purple air coming out of his mouth when he breathes.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;, all of Charon's gold has been replaced with silver, his robes are torn and his hat is different, now with a cone point instead of being flat. His face remains obscured, but his hair is more visible now. He's seen manipulating &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Crowns\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, if it's with magic or his own smoke is unclear. His oar has also lost its golden details in exchange for new silver ones.\nHistory.\nBefore Hades.\nCharon is one of &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;'s many children, an ancient being present in the underworld long before &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; arrived. After Hades's arrival, he offers to ferry the souls of the dead across the River Styx to Hades.\nIn addition to his role as a ferryman accepting the funeral coin, the obol, in exchange for passage, Charon also functions as a local merchant, offering a variety of goods and services.\nIt's hinted that Charon took Persephone to the surface when she decided to leave the Underworld.\nHades.\nCharon will appear intermittently during escapes, selling items he unearthed from the Styx during his travels. However, it is anticipated that the cost of any of these items will surpass a single obol, with many being notably pricier compared to their regular rates. Nevertheless, they do offer enhanced effects or rarity at the very least to offset their higher prices.\nIt was also Charon that arranged for Skelly to be Zagreus's training dummy and for Hermes to lend an extra hand, all in secrecy.\nDuring Zagreus's last visit to his mother, she'll be ready to depart. Charon is the one that ferries them down to the House, much to the prince's surprise.\nEpilogue.\nCharon will attend the feast thrown at the House and enjoy it alongside Hermes.\nAfter that, he'll keep being the shop in Zagreus's security checks. The prince can also try to win a discount, if he manages to survive the boatman's strong attacks.\nHades II.\nCharon provides assistance to Melino\u00eb in her war against &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;.\nAffinity.\nIf given &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;, Charon will give you the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Hourglass\"&gt;Bone Hourglass&lt;/a&gt;, which increases the duration of items sold at &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Charon\"&gt;Wells of Charon&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharon's affinity gauge is maxed out at 7 hearts.\nFavor.\nCharon's favor requires spending at least 10,000 in total at his shop.\nCodex entry.\nUnlocking the complete Codex Entry requires deepening Zagreus' relationship with Charon. \nWares.\nBefore Styx.\nThe following offerings are available in Charon's Shop in Tartarus, Asphodel or Elysium:\nTemple of Styx.\nCharon's Shop in &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Styx\"&gt;Temple of Styx&lt;/a&gt; has 6 offerings in total. \nThe Boosted rarity for higher priced Gods' boons are:\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\nMerchandise=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The surface was no longer welcoming, or safe, for her. And now, I fear that Erebus is not much better off...\"\n Charon : \n\"\"Mmrrrnnnggghhh...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You're right.

Perhaps I could have protected them as was my charge. To think the Fates themselves may have denied me the attempt.

Nonetheless, I'm grateful that our paths have intertwined again. Be safe, Charon.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Moros : \n\"Charon... you, Nemesis, even Hypnos. Who else, Eris?

{"id": "2514", "revid": "29110118", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2514", "title": "Charon/Relationships", "text": " \nFamily.\nNyx.\n&lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;: Charon's mother&lt;br&gt;Nyx and her son seem to have a positive relationship. He is always there, carrying out various tasks for Nyx, including his regular duties of rowing and ferrying tormented souls across the River Styx, or even engaging in combat against wrongdoers when necessary.\nNyx was surprised when Charon broke his work commitment to help &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt;, even though such behavior isn't typical of Charon, he was still approved by her. Nyx commends Charon for his unwavering dedication to his responsibilities, considering him a reliable and helpful member of the House. She also understands her son, the enigmatic figure whom few can decipher what he's thinking, although this is not unusual for a mother.\nThanatos.\n&lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;: Charon's younger brother&lt;br&gt;Thanatos fears and admires his brother for his good work. He tells Zagreus that Charon was already present in the Underworld before Hades, and admits that despite his role of simply being the ferryman, the entire Underworld would stop functioning without him. They don't seem to understand each other, but when using &lt;a href=\"Companion%20Mort\"&gt;Companion Mort&lt;/a&gt; against Charon will illicit an enthusiastic \"Hail, Brother!\" from Thanatos. Thanatos will occasionally imitate Charon's \"Hraaaagh!\" in battle, suggesting the two have more in common than either one lets on. Further supporting this is the fact both have wielded &lt;a href=\"Moonstone%20Axe\"&gt;Zorephet&lt;/a&gt;, possibly passed down from Charon to Thanatos.\nHypnos.\n&lt;a href=\"Hypnos\"&gt;Hypnos&lt;/a&gt;: Charon's younger brother&lt;br&gt;One of Charon's little brothers, Hypnos respects and admires his brother. Unlike many of their other siblings who refer to him in a mostly professional manner with little mention of their familial relationship, Hypnos uses more affectionate terms, and Charon doesn't seem to mind, so he must like it. Charon doesn't seem to pay much attention to Hypnos, but Hypnos knows that Charon always takes care of them despite being busy with his constant responsibilities.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;' takeover of the underworld, Charon remarks to &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; that he is of more use asleep than awake, seemingly urging her not to pursue awaking him any time soon. It's unclear if this refers to some unknown effort against Chronos that Hypnos is able to put in only when asleep, or if Charon is joking at his brother's expense.\nNemesis.\n&lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;: Charon's younger sister\nCharon and his younger sister are not close, though Nemesis respects Charon's dislike of talking and will provide him with gold in exchange for wares.\nMoros.\n&lt;a href=\"Moros\"&gt;Moros&lt;/a&gt;: Charon's younger brother&lt;br&gt;Moros expresses surprise upon discovering Melino\u00eb can understand Charon perfectly, pointing out it isn't easy to understand him, even among their family.\nEris.\n&lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt;: Charon's younger sister.&lt;br&gt;\nThe Fates.\n&lt;a href=\"Fates\"&gt;The Fates&lt;/a&gt;: Charon's sisters.&lt;br&gt;\nChaos.\n&lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt;: Charon's grandparent.&lt;br&gt;\nHouse of Hades.\nZagreus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;: Charon's colleague.&lt;br&gt;Initially, Charon will prevent Zagreus from leaving and may even engage in a physical fight to stop him. He won't like it if Zagreus tries to trick him. He later helps Zagreus in exchange for Obol, and is involved in his escape attempts much more heavily than most other characters in the story.\nMelino\u00eb.\n&lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;: Princess of the Underworld.&lt;br&gt;Charon was a key figure in her childhood, to the point where she came to fully understand him, a task pointed out to be difficult. He aids her in her task, pulling shops on her way and sending cargo to &lt;a href=\"the%20Crossroads\"&gt;the Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;.\nHades.\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;: Charon's boss.&lt;br&gt;Charon is one of the most loyal employees of the House. Charon has been present in the underworld long before Hades arrived, faithfully carrying out his duties. His role is of paramount importance, and the underworld would be in chaos without him. Both Charon and Hades acknowledge this fact. While Zagreus recognizes Charon's strength and his potential to challenge his father, Charon remains unwaveringly loyal to Hades in this role. Consequently, Hades doesn't take Charon lightly and knows how to show him the respect he deserves. Charon's role as a shopkeeper and collector ensures that he continues to earn money, so Charon maintains good terms with his employer, as Hades wants to keep him and wouldn't dare to confront or dismiss him.\nMegaera.\n&lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt;: Charon's colleague.&lt;br&gt;Although she doesn't even want to get close to him, Charon was seen taking Megaera, Thanatos, and Zagreus on a casual boat ride for fishing, which was very nice of him.\nSkelly.\n&lt;a href=\"Skelly\"&gt;Skelly&lt;/a&gt;: Charon's colleague.&lt;br&gt;Charon is Skelly's employer, Skelly is very eager to work for him.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;, he instructs Melino\u00eb to behave when Charon visits the Crossroads, demonstrating he heavily respects him and doesn't want to get on his bad side.\nDusa.\n&lt;a href=\"Dusa\"&gt;Dusa&lt;/a&gt;: Charon's colleague.&lt;br&gt;Although she finds Charon scary, they come up with a plan to reunite a certain mother and son.\nPersephone.\n&lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt;: Charon's queen.&lt;br&gt;A kinder side of Charon can be seen when he secretly helps Persephone herself to enter and exit the Underworld, crossing the River Styx. Previously, he also recruited Skelly and Hermes to help Zagreus and Persephone reunite in secret.\nOlympian Gods.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Olympians\"&gt;Olympians&lt;/a&gt; don't like Charon, not even &lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt; who speaks so highly of other &lt;a href=\"Chthonic%20Deities\"&gt;Chthonic gods&lt;/a&gt;. Whenever Zagreus purchases a boon of them from Charon's shop, they'll often speak their opinion of him and it's never a positive one. Hermes is the only exception to this behaviour.\nIn Hades II, some have changed their views on him, but most still remain skeptical in having to resort to him.\nHermes.\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;: Fellow psychopomp and bestie.&lt;br&gt;Pals Psychopomp and longtime friends, Charon and Hermes possess a remarkable bond despite their contrasting personalities. Charon exudes an aura of chill and reserve, even among the denizens of the underworld, while Hermes, responsible for guiding souls to the River Styx, stands as a stark contrast with his lively and talkative nature.\nDespite their differences, Charon seems to genuinely enjoy Hermes's company, displaying an unexpected warmth in their interactions. While Charon typically remains reticent, Hermes's animated chatter doesn't seem to faze him, in stark contrast to other characters. Their camaraderie is further accentuated by Hermes's admiration for Charon, as he speaks highly of him to others.\nTheir bond is strengthened by their roles: Hermes, the god of merchants and traders, naturally gravitates towards Charon, the game's primary merchant. This alignment reinforces their connection, as Charon's pivotal role in the underworld's economy aligns perfectly with Hermes's domain.\nDuring the second game, their relationship has deepen, as many characters spend the beginning assuring Charon that Hermes is alright and will return from his mission. Upon Hermes' return, he mentions the first thing he did was go to Charon. Melino\u00eb is also tasked with sending a quick \"Hey\" in their stead to each other every now and then.\nFuthermore, they operate in similar ways, controlling the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Charon\"&gt;Wells of Charon&lt;/a&gt; and Shrines of Hermes, similar by nature. Hermes may also drop an Olympian boon to Melino\u00eb if she pays for it as if it were a package, which is similar to Charon's visit to the Crossroads.\nAphrodite.\n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;: Admirer.&lt;br&gt;Aphrodite has a secret crush on him, which unfortunately appears to be one-sided. She mentions how she finds that Ferryman; he's such a solitary soul. Robust... tall... with a powerful build. Hmm. As Melino\u00eb truly understands Charon, she asks Melino\u00eb to send messages to him, which probably won't be reciprocated. When Melino\u00eb questions Aphrodite, she says that everyone has fantasies."}

Now, he launches a war against the &lt;a href=\"Olympians\"&gt;Olympian Gods&lt;/a&gt;, besieging &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Mount Olympus&lt;/a&gt; itself with the intent of restoring his old rule upon the world. \nCharacteristics and Personality.\nChronos is a Titan of the golden age, the great evil of the game. A tyrannical and composed king, a bad father to Hades and his brothers, and a force that cannot be contained. Chronos looks down upon his granddaughter's attempts with underestimation, serving as the ultimate obstacle. \nChronos behaves with an elegant and superficial affability; he is arrogant, cold, and calculating, showing apathy towards Melino\u00eb's attempts to challenge his dominion to free the Underworld, and, ultimately, his son Hades and his enslaved family, compelling him to witness his loved ones frozen in time as his dominion is conquered. \nThough initially coming off as apathetic to anything that does not involve his domain, he is not completely devoid of curiosity about the &lt;a href=\"Surface\"&gt;outside world&lt;/a&gt; sometimes taking the time to go out and observe the state of the world that his children have left his former kingdom in. He is also often insulting and mocking towards Melino\u00eb throughout her journeys, and when they finally meet officially at the House of Hades, he often criticizes her and the other &lt;a href=\"The%20Unseen\"&gt;freedom fighters&lt;/a&gt; in the Crossroads as being an uncivilized bunch. During their fight, while he does not hesitate to wield his weapons against her, Chronos still maintains a diplomatic stance, preferring conversation over combat. \nHe is apparently an abusive and hated father, feared by all of his children for being cruel and terrible to them, although Hades readily admits that he was least a better father to them than &lt;a href=\"Hyperion\"&gt;Hyperion&lt;/a&gt; ever was to his own daughters. Chronos has a strong desire for control and is a supreme egotist, seeing himself as the victim of the story. He was hurt by his own children going against him and views them as adversaries. His approach is less that of a traditional dictator and more that of a disappointed father who always believes he knows what is best for everyone, disciplining and punishing his offspring as he sees fit from which they will only learn \"over time\". \nHe also has a comedic side, joking that his son let his beard grow before him; he can't help but let out a sinister laugh if the player backs down from a confrontation. \nHe is also very cunning, being a master of deception, he manages to locate and banish the Fates far away where they could no longer interfere in his plans. It is revealed that he deliberately deceived Chaos into telling him where they lived simply because he had wanted to test the magnitude of their power out of curiosity. \nAlthough one might assume he was as chaotic and destructive as the rest of the Titans, Aphrodite mentions that she found his reign to be \"overall boring\", ironically implying that his reign over the universe was in fact very similar to Hades' benevolent yet tyrannical approach to ruling over the Underworld and the dead, and he seems to have garnered a legion of loyal subjects as they all rallied to him when they summoned him, showing that he was at least a good king to them.\nPhysical description.\nAs a Titan, Chronos towers over mortals, being roughly twice Melino\u00eb's height, although his frame is far leaner than his sons' bulky frame. He has dark grey skin with a number of golden scars, combed back white hair, and glowing white eyes. When fighting, he has a set of large dark wings.\nHis attire has a curiously Egyptian aesthetic, consisting of a white tunic with a golden hourglass, a collection of bangles along his arms, and a golden necklace decorated with the Roman numerals I-XII.\nHistory.\nPast.\nChronos ruled the earth in ancient times but was overthrown by his three children &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;, and their three allies &lt;a href=\"Hestia\"&gt;Hestia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt;, the founding Olympians. They cut him into innumerable pieces with his own scythe and scattered them throughout the darkest depths of &lt;a href=\"Tartarus\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore Hades II.\nChronos appeared suddenly in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt;, using his control over time to imprison the majority of its inhabitants in a moment that would never pass. After ensuring his daughter &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb's&lt;/a&gt; safety, Hades confronted his father, who explained that he sought vengeance against the gods for stealing his throne and killing him. He ordered Hades to tell him the location of the &lt;a href=\"Fates\"&gt;Three Fates&lt;/a&gt;, but Hades didn't know it. Rather than freezing his son in time, Chronos imprisoned him in &lt;a href=\"Sisyphus\"&gt;Sisyphus&lt;/a&gt;' chamber of Tartarus so that he could send his minions to torment Hades for his amusement. He then visited &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, who, unaware of his scheme, used their omniscience to find the location of the Fates. Chronos used this knowledge to capture the Fates, imprisoning them somewhere in the Underworld.\nHades II.\nWith the leadership of the Underworld destabilized, Chronos put his plan into action. He deliberately disrupted the workings of the Underworld, creating a situation where the lost souls of dead mortals would stagnate in &lt;a href=\"Erebus\"&gt;Erebus&lt;/a&gt; and their bodies would remain animated on the mortal plane. With his army of faithful cultists, he organized these dead into an army that would march on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Mount Olympus&lt;/a&gt; to dethrone the gods. They were able to successfully hold back the undead forces for years, but the attacks only grew in intensity, as the dead could not permanently die without being processed through Erebus.\nUnbeknownst to the Titan, forces loyal to Hades had gathered under the banner of &lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt; and plotted to kill him once more. One such soldier was Melino\u00eb, daughter of Hades, who was able to repeatedly infiltrate the House of Hades and kill Chronos. However, she could not inflict damage to his body nearly as thoroughly as the Olympians had, and he regenerated much more quickly to continue his assault on the gods."}

He required a special arrangement. For aeons, he incarcerated countless souls within this place; not to mention \"me.\" Seemed only fitting he should have to waste away accordingly.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"You couch it in morality, when vengeance is reason enough. Though, since you've reasoned it all out, by what right did you take the other members of my family? And Nyx and all the rest?\"\n Chronos : \"Why, because they opposed me. Except you have this rather vexing knack for resisting some of my time-honored techniques... a recessive family trait, perhaps. Although, your brother... he was not so fortunate. You, too, shall break, however... soon enough.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Chronos : \"Hades used some of his failing strength to spur you on! Even whilst bound in chains no god can break, your father yet proves to be a pest.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"You've tortured and humiliated him. All this talk of how you plan to bring about a bygone age, yet petty vengeance seems to be your chief concern.\"\n Chronos : \"The thing is, my girl, I can have \"both.\" You should have seen the cruel, inventive ways your father tortured mortal souls! Thus I dispense a form of justice to \"him\", and to \"you.\"\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chronos : \"You are \"quite\" dangerous, I must admit. You have repeatedly breached into Tartarus, and this House; impossibilities, if not for your tainted bloodline! And you are able to withstand my conjuring. Might I again politely ask you \"how?\"\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"You call that \"politely?\" You didn't even say the magick word. But since you really want to know... I'm from the future. You'll later come to realize the error of your ways, and teach me to stop you before you can cause more harm.\"\n Chronos : \"\"Ha ha ha!\" Oh, quite an imaginative tale. A comedy, for the utterly outrageous premise beggars belief! My girl, one cannot travel \"back\" in Time! Time marches ever forward; and I alone determine at which rate.\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chronos : \"You are proving to be quite a nuisance, if only because you insist on continually setting loose your father's wretched old three-headed cur! To think how such a beast used to be kept within these walls.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"So you keep casting out poor Cerberus into the Mourning Fields, where he rages alone. Of all your unforgivable offenses...\"\n Chronos : \"What would you have me do? I do not require him to guard the gates to this realm, for they are open wide.

I know that Polyphemus well enough by now... his loyalty can almost certainly be bought.\"\n Chronos : \"\"Oh\", that it \"can. Loyalty\" is either earned or bought, and it makes very little difference either way. Polyphemus has his limitations, to be sure. But he is not a \"lost cause.\"\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \"You know, I'm almost impressed. Not only have you ransacked my father's domain and made war on Olympus, you had the audacity to deceive Primordial Chaos! That takes a spine.\"\n Chronos : \"Why thank you, my girl! I must admit, I thought that Chaos would be something of a bargainer, for I was willing to exchange their daughter Nyx for the Three Fates. But now, I have them all!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"You played the chthonic gods for a pack of fools... these eldest, most powerful forces in existence.

No, what happens now... is entirely up to {#Emph}us.\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chronos : \"I am quite flummoxed with that \"Boatman\" fellow just outside, who has the gall to scull his little boat right to my very doorstep! The Satyrs have more fear of him than you.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"You ought fear him yourself. Lord Charon knows every stone in the Underworld... every drop in the five rivers. You say you can't be stopped? Neither can he.\"\n Chronos : \"...That trinket-peddler, crudely hawking his ill-gotten wares to his very limited base of customers! And hoarding so much Gold I generously wrought. A noble ally that you have!\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : I thought all the chthonic gods opposed you openly. But you persuaded \"Eris\", of all creatures, to your side! A laughable alliance, though not bad for sowing more destruction and dissent.\"\n Chronos : \"I am owed credit for a great many things, my girl; but not for any such alliances with Strife! What use have I for Nyx's youngest whelp? Although perhaps she is no fool, if she has rallied to my banners as you say.\"\nAbout Weapons.\nAs a Whole.\n Chronos : \"What \"are\" those \"garish\" instruments with which you try to do harm? Like as not some gadgets that the Fates themselves had vainly hoped would put an end to me.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"Whether they \"vainly\" hoped is yet to be determined. These may not be the arms the gods once used to bring you down, but they'll get the job done just the same. You watch.\"\n Chronos : \"Oh, we are eager to learn more, Hrodreptus and I. This scythe is not merely for cutting short the wheat whilst I put Cerberus away; it is for cutting short just about anything, you see.\"\nAspect of &lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chronos : \"I recognize that blade you bear: The scythe of Death himself! Alas that he was momentarily without it when I caught him in my snare, along with this House's other former residents.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"You may have taken Death, yet death is here for you. It would be fitting if you met your end by Zorephet.\"\n Chronos : \"It would be most unlikely, I should think. Then let us match now, scythe to scythe! Your Zorephet against my Hrodreptus. And we shall imminently see who reaps, and who sows.\"\nAbout the Scenery.\nAbout The Fallen &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades/Hades%20II\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chronos : \"You should have seen the hideous appearance of this place when I arrived! Or, I suppose you {#Emph}did{#Prev}, but were too little to recall. I daresay now it is a little more presentable. Yet you barge in, tracking blood and filth across the floor.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"My apologies to your custodial staff. Next time, I'll have to try to be a little more presentable when I arrive.\"\n Chronos : \"You seethe with bitter irony; but look at yourself! Come to confront me whilst more dead than alive. Well, the sooner I cast you out, the sooner my \"custodial staff\" can start to tidy up.\"\nAbout The Fallen &lt;a href=\"River%20Styx\"&gt;River Styx&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chronos : \"Did you enjoy your swim? The River Styx once flowed through here like blood. Foul traces of it yet remain in the Fields above, but now in my vicinity, it is all grains of gold.\"\n Melino\u00eb : You would transform the River Styx itself to suit your fancy? Or perhaps I heard you incorrectly. I may still have too many of your grains of gold stuck in my ears.\"\n Chronos : \"No wonder you have had such difficulty listening to me. Nevertheless, I trust the point I am about to make shall come through loud and clear.\"\nAbout The &lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Thessaly\"&gt;Rift of Thessaly&lt;/a&gt;.\n Chronos : \"You have been busy on the surface, have you not? Paid witness to indomitable fleets that sail toward inevitable victory, and the destruction of the mountain of the gods.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"The only fleet I saw up there was a ramshackle mess whose crew could barely stand, much less put up a fight. No wonder you have failed to take Olympus yet.\"\n Chronos : \"My fleets may not be to your standards, girl; but they have one important characteristic, which the gods all sorely lack: They are loyal to \"me\" to the end. Whichever end I \"deem!\"\"\nAbout the Enemies.\nAbout the Satyrs.\n Chronos : \"My legions know you well by now; the trouble you have caused. Yet only my most ardent followers may spill their blood within my halls.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"These Satyr worshipers of yours must be very honored to be the first to die here. Not the wisest creatures, though, are they?\"\n Chronos : \"The wise do not follow; the wise \"lead.\" These Satyrs lack a mortal fear of death, believing that their sacrifice shall bring me strength, and that they shall live on. Let us \"grant their desire.\"\"\nAbout Wretches.\n Melino\u00eb : \"Pardon my lateness, I had some wretches to contend with. I thought you let everyone go, regardless of past transgressions.\"\n Chronos : \"I let just about everyone go, yes. You may be surprised, however, to learn that some of those so-called \"wretches\" do not care for Hades very much. They were quite eager to serve me instead, when nicely asked. With you, I shall not even bother.\"\nMiscellaneous Conversations.\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;'s Loss.\n Chronos : \"You slipped through my fingers before, only to return and give to me another opportunity to add you to my collection? Did Athena truly get all the wisdom in our family?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"Your \"collection...\" you speak of your kin as objects to be put on display. The gods ought have put \"you\" on display after cutting you to pieces, instead of discarding you like common filth.\"\n Chronos : \"You know, I am still rather sore about all that. I truly thought my children would be different; that they would show their elders some respect. But they did not. And my tolerance... has its limits.\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;'s Success.\n Chronos : \"Your eyes do not deceive; I am as hale and hearty as can be! That sinking sense you must have felt after our previous exchange? The fear of the utter senselessness of your entire enterprise? You now know it to be true.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"I was never going to destroy you in a single clash. You more than anybody ought to know results of any worth take time.\"\n Chronos : \"\"Ahh\", so then you wish to make a habit of such unceremonious appearances as this. As though they might amount to something, in the end. Fine. For my part, I occasionally need to stretch my limbs.\"\nAbout History.\n Chronos : \"The course of history is mine to shape. Yet you continue vexing me, as though you wish to do so in my stead. Fine, what shall it be? Shall I just go ahead and cede my rightful throne?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"You don't set the course of history... you're Time. You're just the paving stones we cross along our way. More than getting back at the gods, you're getting back at the Fates, who know your rightful place in all of this.\"\n Chronos : \"I do, in fact, take issue with the Fates. Though they ought to be none of {#Emph}your {#Prev}concern, or anyone's. Imagine being free to make your own decisions now, only to long for the weight of their yoke upon your back! How {#Emph}pathetic.\"\nAbout the Golden Age.\nDialogue 01.\n Chronos : \"You are too young to know what it was like. Before the gods re-shaped the world to be like this. Mortals did not have to die in agony, and waste away within this \"pit\". A simpler age, and all the better for it.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"All the better, because you controlled every detail, is that it? You couldn't stand that others had a different outlook than your own. You went to war with your own children! After eating them whole, so they say.\"\n Chronos : \"They say a lot of things! \"They\" went to war with \"me.\" My offspring and my other charges did not always take to discipline; I had too many to look after to take cheek from any one. And \"you\", my girl, are not entitled to anything more.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Chronos : \"You have by now seen something of this world. Consider what the gods have wrought: war, famine, betrayal! During my Golden Age, there were no such concerns. It was a tranquil time... until the gods decided to wrest control forcibly!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"Perhaps your rule was not as perfect as you claim. Perhaps you were a stifling presence on your children and their generation, leaving them with little choice but to rid themselves of you.\"\n Chronos : Well, they \"failed!\" And thus presents itself this golden opportunity to teach my \"children and their generation\" a most-valuable lesson about having to live with the consequences of their actions!\"\nAbout the Future.\n Chronos : \"The future is unwoven; uncertain. Not even the Fates themselves can anticipate how all of this shall end, or \"when.\" Yet you press on.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"I thought you were all about the inevitable. Whether the outcome of all this has been foretold or not, I'll see it through. Call it a morbid curiosity.\"\n Chronos : \"I call it reckless abandon, nothing more. You fail to consider the many possibilities in which you prove unable to enjoy the fruits of your labors...\"\nAbout Time.\n Chronos : \"A moment passes... then another, and another. I have names for them in every measure, you know? The very brief ones. The ones that linger...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"If you're quite finished, I'll try to not to take up more than a few of the very brief ones you mentioned.\"\n Chronos : \"I understand the need to cut \"Time \" down to smaller bits, I do. Hours, cut down to minutes. Minutes, cut down to seconds. Because the whole of it, my girl... is \"too much to fathom.\"\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Titans\"&gt;Titans&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \"You're so indignant of my father's generation. What came of yours? I don't see many of your contemporaries rallied to your cause, or any other for that matter.\"\n Chronos : \"Well, you see, most of the other Titans met their end, just as did I! The doing of your father and his \"generation.\" Perhaps when all of this is settled, I shall see to bringing my \"contemporaries\" back. A few of them.\"\nAbout Origin.\n Melino\u00eb : \"Get up, wretch. Titan. \"Lord Master Chronos.\" Whatever they call you now. It's \"time\", as you might say.\"\n Chronos : \"It is, indeed. And they have called me many things; many names, in aeons past. There are those who think me nothing more than the offspring of Heaven and Earth, of all the \"nerve.\" And you are even less cordial than \"they.\"\"\nAbout Clockwork.\n Chronos : \"Have you once marveled at the ever-turning gears in Tartarus? My little contribution to the Underworld's design; a steady means of moving things along. I call it \"clockwork.\" A cycle without end! Akin to the turning of the seasons.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"I'm not here for a tour. That \"clockwork\" could have only come from \"you.\" An eyesore, going nowhere, groaning all along.\"\n Chronos : \"Going \"nowhere?\" One with capacity for magick ought espouse a deeper understanding of this world! We are always going \"somewhere;\" the \"future\", my girl! Into the \"future.\"\"\nAbout The Gameplay Timer.\nDialogue 01.\n Chronos : \"So you are keeping careful track of Time; such things of course are plain for me to see. But your reasons for it, I hardly can surmise. To gauge, perhaps, how quickly you shall fall?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"Either me or you. So how much time shall we require here tonight? In all your wisdom, surely you must know.\"\n Chronos : \"Oh, this shall take but a \"trifle\", I expect! Not yet a formal measurement, although perhaps that too shall change...\"\nDialogue 02.\n Chronos : \"You ceased to track the measurement of just how quickly we may settle our disputes. Was it too much for you? To be so self-aware of your inexorable flight toward uncertainty?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"I am an immortal goddess of the Underworld. Time means nothing to me. I can do this forever.\"\n Chronos : \"Is that so? \"Forever\" is a very long while. We shall have to make this slow and excruciating, to sate your gluttonous desire for more...\"\nAbout Pausing the Game.\n Chronos : \"You have considerable power over Time, that you can turn some of my innate power against \"me!\" Perhaps your knack for this is merely a recessive family trait.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"Don't insult me, and don't fool yourself. When you took my family, you created in me a lifelong desire to see you destroyed. So I simply prepared.\"\n Chronos : \"A lifelong desire. Your \"life\", girl, is but a blink of an eye to \"me!\" No one achieves abilities as yours through force of will alone. Though you are no mere \"god\"; you are a \"witch.\"\"\nDefeat.\nFirst Loss Against Melino\u00eb.\n Chronos : \"\"&lt;Gasp&gt;\" I thought... \"none\" could resist the ravages of Time... but, \"you\"? \"How\"...?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"You'll get no answers from me, and no mercy, either. Now \"die\", already. And I'll collect the ichor from your veins. Or whatever flows through them.\"\n Chronos : \"\"Hah\", hah, hah! What is death to the deathless? A mere nuisance! This House is \"mine\". Once I am gone... you shall be cast away.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"I expect so. And you'll be re-made and back on the throne before I can return. But I \"shall\" return. And I'll slay you again, and again, and \"again\", if I must.\"\n Chronos : \"Even if, in so doing, it meant that you would never see your dear old family again? Because the mercy I have shown to them thus far is something I may have to re-evaluate.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \"\"Our\" family. And what do I care? I don't even know them. But I \"do\" know you ought be dead here in another moment; any last words?\"\n Chronos : \"...For you, my girl...? No... none, for now...\""}

Chthonic, also known as the Chthonic Gods) is an umbrella term for any and all deities associated with the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Underworld\"&gt;Underworld&lt;/a&gt;, subterranea, or agriculture. \nUnlike their &lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;surface-dwelling&lt;/a&gt; counterparts, the &lt;a href=\"Olympians\"&gt;Olympians&lt;/a&gt;, who rule over the living, most of the Chthonic Deities reside within the Underworld and act as the celestial bureaucracy in charge of running the various day-to-day activities of the afterlife. \nBecause of this, they are often seen as being far more mature and responsible than the Olympians who, more often than not, prefer to eternally live out narcissistic, hedonistic lifestyles. \nHistory.\nOrigins.\nMost Chthonic Gods were &lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20Nyx\"&gt;born&lt;/a&gt; to the goddess &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt; who for a time ruled the Underworld alone. After the &lt;a href=\"Titans\"&gt;Titans&lt;/a&gt; were overthrown by their children, &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; gained rulership of the Underworld after he and his brothers had drawn lots to divide the world.

During &lt;a href=\"Odysseus\"&gt;Odysseus&lt;/a&gt;' journey, he encountered Circe on her island of Aeaea where Circe transformed his crew into swine. Odysseus was able to convice her to change his crew back into men and lived with her for a year. The two ended up having a brief affair during Odysseus' stay that ended when he left to continue on his journey back home.\nCirce appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;\" and offers her Changes &amp; Fortunes to &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; in her fight against &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;.

She behaves like an aunt, being talkative and displaying great familiarity, despite Melino\u00eb not having seen her since infancy, affectionately referring to her as Molly. She mentions that Hecate was akin to a mother to her and seems to regard her as a model witch, thus she diligently watches over Melino\u00eb.\nShe consistently maintains a cheerful demeanor and can often be observed happily reciting the ingredients for her next dubious transfiguration potion. Furthermore, she exhibits considerable hypocrisy, particularly concerning her niece Medea, fearing the possibility of her adopting bad habits, despite not being the best influence herself. Nonetheless, she genuinely cares for her.\nPhysical description.\nCirce is depicted as a voluptuous woman. Her eyes gleam with a bright golden hue, similar to her &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; aunt &lt;a href=\"Selene\"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt; and her father Helios. She has full, reddish-tinged hair adorned with cat ears and a garland.\nShe wears a sand-colored dress decorated with moons and its topped by cheetah skin, held in place with a golden belt. Her armbands are also made of cheetah skin. The front depicts silk below decorated with a similar symbol as the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Sisters\"&gt;Silver Sisters&lt;/a&gt;', but in gold instead of silver on top of it. She wears other golden jewelry, like her choker, bracelets and earrings. She's seen with crystals, feathers and other items on her belt.

Such hospitality I don't extend to anyone, \"hmhm! \"And I make no exceptions, not even for you!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Madame Circe, that is perfectly all right, and there's no need to explain. We all live in seclusion in our own way. What other way is there? With privacy comes peace of mind.\" \n Circe : \n\"I'm grateful that you understand. Of late, I share my simple home with beasts but that is all! This Isle of Aiaia is not mine of course; rather, it's my dear companion, and can be \"yours. \"So please, help yourself to anything you need whilst here.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Thessaly\"&gt;Rift of Thessaly&lt;/a&gt;.\n Circe : \n\"\"Fie \"on that never-ending fleet of ghastly sailing-ships, all headed for the mountain of the gods, \"hah! \"My little isle sometimes gets \"right \"in the way! No hospitality awaits their boorish crews, \"ahaha! \"Whilst \"I \"replenish my supply of firewood.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You must long for the days when your island was more secluded, and had much less unwanted company. I hope I'm not disturbing your peace, Madame!\"\n Circe : \n\"\"Oh\", heavens \"no! \"In actuality, it could be rather all too quiet with only the rustle of the vegetation, and the snuffle of my piggies, and the like. I more than welcome your returns!\"\nMiscellaneous Conversations.\nAbout Backstory.\n Circe : \n\"You and I are much alike in that our Lady Hecate discovered us when most we needed someone such as her, poppet. Perchance, her similar affinity for beasts made her take some pity on me then... a witch, amongst the polecats and the pigs!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Take pity on you, how? That doesn't sound like the Headmistress I know. She has always thought highly of you, and depends on you to be our eyes here at this key juncture.\"\n Circe : \n\"I owe her this, and more. When I was a young outcast, practicing an art oft thought to be profane, it was our Lady who discovered me and showed me that my path led not to ruin, but to harmony. It veritably is a long and winding path, but one I shall not stray from anymore.\"\nAbout Miracles.\n Circe : \n\"I foresaw within the facets of my crystals that you were headed here again... or \"through \"here, I should say. Is there a salve, potion, or poultice that might ease your passage?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Most certainly, and thank you, Madame Circe. I don't suppose you have anything that renders me invulnerable, or lets me find vast quantities of rare reagents on my way?\"\n Circe : \n\"Heavens \"no\", poppet, \"hah! \"The greater the effect, the greater the unintended consequence, that much we know is true. \"Erm\", there is a \"balance \"to creating miracles! Shall one of these suffice?\"\nAbout Studies.\n Circe : \n\"How you were \"always \"at your studies, little miss! That you are here suggests how much you have achieved. I always wanted you to visit me; you used to say it was \"impossible!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It turns out even prophecies of the Three Fates are circumventable. Though, I still have much to learn... or so I keep reminding myself night after night. How about you? You must have perfect mastery over our craft by now!\"\n Circe : \n\"Now it's \"my \"turn to say something \"is \"impossible! I've been practicing enchantment for three quarters of my life, and have yet to ever change the essence of a thing! Only the \"form. \"But the pursuit I find is fascinating without end!\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Arcana%20Cards\"&gt;Arcana&lt;/a&gt;.\n Circe : \n\"Our Lady Hecate would sometimes tell me of your progress, and let on that you attuned to the Altar of Ashes at long last, \"hoho! \"How marvelous... for the Arcana have so much to offer us.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I couldn't agree more. Through grasping the Arcana, I've discovered strength I never realized I had. To think I used to use our Altar merely to collect my thoughts.\"\n Circe : \n\"Collecting one's thoughts is valuable enough! Mine own at least are prone to scattering. As for your innate strength and magickal acuity, perchance we shall discover even more.\"\nAbout Family.\n Circe : \n\"I oft forget, we share some kinship, do we not? My father is the shining Sun itself, the Titan Helios. Distant accomplice to the gods! Not close with anyone. But he is... brother to the Lady Demeter, my aunt, who is your grandmother, correct...?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Oh Madame Circe, right you are! That makes us cousins once removed, I think. I don't know how any of us can keep all this genealogy straight! In any case, the bond matters more than the blood, does it not?\"\n Circe : \n\"Quite veritably so! Though, you'll forgive me that I've shied from all of it. Amongst family, I was expected to act differently with each and every one. I scarcely understood how to be \"me! \"Things are much simpler on this isle here.\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Moly\"&gt;Moly&lt;/a&gt;.\n Circe : \n\"Something felt \"different\", just as you arrived. It's \"Moly\", isn't it? And quite a \"lot\", as I perceive! You need no such protection in this place. A miracle it does not interfere with your own craft!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I have been gathering what Moly I can find in Erebus. It has its uses to be sure, though in my purse it doesn't bother me, and remains fresh. You have an aversion to it? And here I thought that every plant and herb had earned your love.\"\n Circe : \n\"Some earn my caution sooner than my love! Moly has a \"stifling \"effect I care for not at all! So much so, that I have learned to negate it. As you have no need of its powers here, it shall do neither of us any harm! Though, do be careful, little miss.\"\nAbout Crystals.\n Circe : \n\"\"Ah-ha\", I knew you would arrive just now, poppet, \"haha! \"No innate gift of foresight required, merely intuition and my crystals hereabouts. Have you incorporated any into \"your \"routine?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Well... I've learned to see into our &lt;a href=\"https%3A//hades.fandom.com/wiki/The_Crossroads/Training_Grounds%23The_Pitch-Black_Stone%3A~%3Atext%3Dbetween%2520the%2520gateways.-%2CThe%2520Pitch%252DBlack%2520Stone%2C-The%2520Pitch%252DBlack\"&gt;Pitch-Black Stone&lt;/a&gt;! I used to think that it was there to help make us unseen, but it has other potent uses, too. Crystals! So full of potential.\"\n Circe : \n\"Mother Gaia's multicolored bounty, \"oh! \"I sometimes envy that you live beneath the Earth where crystals and gemstones grow in abundance! Each has its special properties suggested by a single touch, \"oh-hohoh! \"How brilliant they all are!\"\nAbout the &lt;a href=\"Witch%27s%20Staff\"&gt;Aspect of Circe&lt;/a&gt;.\n Circe : \n\"How fares my \"marvelous \"Descura, little miss? I knew that you were next in line for her, though I still feel a bit emotional to see my favored staff again, \"hohoho. \"Our Lady Hecate had to do more than a \"bit \"of prodding to make me give her up, \"hehehoho!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I've done my best to wield Descura with respect; to live up to those who possessed the Witch's Staff before me. And it... or rather she has served me well. My presence here is evidence to that. Do you... wish to hold her again?\"\n Circe : \n\"Oh, no, I mustn't! We had our time. Long had she grown heavy in my hands before I passed her on, besides. May she protect you just as fiercely as I know she can!\"\nAbout Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt;.\n Circe : \n\"How lately is the temperament of our Lady Hecate? Long has it been since last I basked in her wisdom; for I have wisdom of my own, she says! You must have needed her attention more than I...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Madame Circe, I... I did not mean to deny you her attention. Although Headmistress has been preoccupied not just with my training, but with leading the Unseen, warding the Crossroads against any harm, readying our plans to take back what's ours. She's counting on us... on you.\"\n Circe : \n\"I know, I know... and I apologize that I insinuated any feelings of resentment on my part; for none exist towards you, let alone her! You have my \"word\", poppet. It's just... she was like a mother to me! \"Oh\", how she hated when I told her so, \"haha!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Selene\"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt;.\n Circe : \n\"You've one of great Selene's precious blessings on this eve, that I can tell, poppet! Even from afar, the Moon has always kept me company. Her light can be so \"utterly \"transformative!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"And may Selene's light ever shine for us, Madame. I'd likely not have found my way to you if not for her. As for her magick... sometimes I wonder if it isn't transforming me, so much as revealing who I really am.\"\n Circe : \n\"That may well be so! Who is to say where our true nature lies? A spell of transformation is a spell of revelation; when we change, we become more like \"ourselves\". Not less!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Medea\"&gt;Medea&lt;/a&gt;.\n Circe : \n\"I have seen neither hide nor hair of that Medea as of late! Her charge was far less pleasant than my own, having to watch over that ghastly town. I worry she's developing bad habits, practicing in such a place!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I've seen Lady Medea recently. She seems rather comfortable in Ephyra, in spite of what's happened there. Though, has she always had such a singular interest in curses and the necromantic arts?\"\n Circe : \n\"Since she was old enough to think for herself, yes, \"heh\". To \"fend \"for herself, I should say. She may be my niece yet she was always \"far \"more interested in our blood's \"other \"properties. At least she hasn't put a curse on \"me, haha. Ah! \"As far as I can tell!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Odysseus\"&gt;Odysseus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Circe : \n\"I wonder, does our Lady Hecate as yet consort with that Tactician Shade of hers, \"heh? \"Swarthy in his mortal days, not of surpassing stature, prone to talk. \"Oh\", what was his name again?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You mean Odysseus? He remains indispensable to our cause. What knowledge I possess of this route and the dangers along it are thanks largely to him. Why do you ask?\"\n Circe : \n\"\"Oh! \"No reason at all! It's merely that he was a flighty sort as I recall, quite prone to wandering about! So his continued service is a bit of a surprise. A pleasant one, mind you!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Did you use to know him? I don't recall you interacting at the Crossroads. Not that I was paying much heed to anything besides my studies then. I was so little last you visited!\"\n Circe : \n\"Once I relocated this isle, the journey to the Crossroads became \"much \"more arduous. As for Odysseus, yes, him I have met before. Him and his pig-headed crew. A different age, poppet! Perchance he's learned a bit since then.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Scylla\"&gt;Scylla&lt;/a&gt;.\n Circe : \n\"All of this sea-water must feel very disconcerting, little miss. For me, though, it feels rather much like home! Even the depths of Oceanus bring a sense of comfort, more than fear!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'm getting used to it. My path into the Underworld requires me to skirt the edge of Oceanus. The water's beautiful, though I could do without the sea-monsters. Particularly Scylla and her Siren friends... perhaps you know of them?\"\n Circe : \n\"Oh, \"yes! \"I do indeed. I grew up underneath the sea, and Scylla I remember from my youth. Always yelping about \"this \"or \"that! \"Was \"deafening! \"Perchance why I prefer the silence now.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;.\n Circe : \n\"What has the world come to, little miss? \"Uh! \"Living on my little isle, I must have been the last to learn calamity had spread all from the heavens to beneath the earth!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"And Chronos is responsible for all of it. \"Time \"apparently wishes to ruin everything eventually, though we are not about to let him have his way. We'll drive his forces from Olympus and unseat him from my father's throne.\"\n Circe : \n\"\"Oh\", we immortals and our warring ways! What example do we set for \"mortalkind? \"But I know certain battles must be fought; and I remain committed to our Lady Hecate, and you.\"\nGifts.\n&lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Madame Circe, I'm grateful that we had a chance to meet again after all this time. Your kindness to me always meant a lot, and I wanted to give you this small token in return.\"\n Circe : \n\"\"Nectar! Ohh, thank you\", little miss! I've made attempts to brew my own but never get it right! Though why don't you take \"this \"in kind? Think of it as a little island souvenir!\"\n\"Circe gives &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Figurine\"&gt;Crystal Figurine&lt;/a&gt;.'\n Melino\u00eb : \"It's beautiful, and quite adorable! Thank you!\"\n2nd Time.\n Circe : \n\"Good heavens! More, for \"me? \"I'm unaccustomed to receiving gifts here on my little isle.

Her other boons vary between helping survivability by healing, increasing damage, or boosting your different boons over time by increasing their rarity.\nDemeter boons excel at control, as Chill slows enemies down the more Zagreus strikes them. Since Chill is easy to stack and maintain, this also enables good synergy with the &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20of%20Night\"&gt;Mirror of Night&lt;/a&gt; Upgrade, Privileged Status.\nDemeter only appears after reaching the surface for the first time (just reaching the final boss, they don\u2019t have to be defeated), making her one of the five Olympian gods (the other four being &lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;) who will not appear in the very first run of a save.\nDemeter returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt; \" and offers her boons to &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; in her fight against &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;. Her new signature &lt;a href=\"Status_effects/Hades_II%23Status_Curses\"&gt;Status Curses&lt;/a&gt; are and . \nCharacteristics and Personality.\nDemeter was once benevolent, hardworking, strong-willed, and protective goddess. However, her pain and grief over losing her beloved daughter &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Kore&lt;/a&gt; resulted in the infamous \"Endless Winter,\" causing her to take on a more wintry appearance and bitter personality.\nAs a mother, she was kind but overly controlling, keeping her daughter on a tight leash out of fear for her safety. Due to Persephone's mortal heritage, she saw her as fragile, and refused to consider her feelings, not even listening when she tried to tell her about &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; and this overprotection led to a rift between them.\nHer interactions with the other &lt;a href=\"Olympians\"&gt;Olympians&lt;/a&gt; are shown to be despising them and unfoundedly blames the mortals for daughter's disappearance. She is quite imperious, spiteful and only seems to hold her daughter and later Zagreus in high regard. They respect her and are cautious around her, fearing what one of the eldest of the Olympians might do.\nEven the most inflexible of the Olympians appeared to yield to &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;, despite her 'steel-like gaze,' reluctance and distrust of everyone. However, gradually, she opens up and reciprocates the young man's captivating kindness, seeing in him 'something \"familiar\" to her eyes' and reminding her of happier times when she used to have a soft heart and aids him in his escape from the Underworld.\nAt first, she seems to act as a kind of icy matriarch, always rigid and sour in Zagreus' presence. She bitterly advises Zagreus never to fall in love with a mortal, as such cases are doomed to failure. When she discovers that Zagreus is actually her grandson, she warms up in his presence, and acts more reasonably with all. Demeter starts to soften with him by affectionately calling him \"little sprout\" and undoing her eternal winter with Persephone's return, slowly warming her frozen heart. However, she makes it clear that she hasn't forgotten the incident, leaving a part of the Underworld's surface entrance frozen as a perpetual reminder of that fact.\nPhysical description.\nDemeter's appearance is themed around winter and ebbing life. She is an elderly woman with blue lips and silvery-white hair worn in twin braids that cross her chest and loop back over the opposite shoulder. Six shoots of pale blue wheat frame her head, and she wears icicle-like earrings and ornaments that resemble snowflakes above her head. Her blue robe is flecked with a frost-like pattern on the abdomen, and her cape is made of snow with large blue snowflakes on its shoulders. Her forearms are mostly covered in ice, with only her digits and small parts of her forearms having visible skin, and she wears a small ring or bit of snow on her left ring finger. The only bits of green on her person are her eyes and the green ribbon she holds, which looks much like Persephone's hair ribbon. A cornucopia, covered in snow and containing no food, appears behind her.\nIn Hades II, Demeter has tied her hair and now wears armor. She maintains a winter motif in her clothes, but now it seems it fades into an autumm motif in some points.\nHistory.\nPast.\nDemeter is the daughter of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Titans\"&gt;titans&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hyperion\"&gt;Hyperion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Theia\"&gt;Theia&lt;/a&gt;, and sister of &lt;a href=\"Hestia\"&gt;Hestia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Selene\"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eos\"&gt;Eos&lt;/a&gt;. Together with her sisters, Hestia and Hera, she joined &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;' side and helped him defeat the Titans. During the war she wielded the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Fists\"&gt;Twin Fists of Malphon&lt;/a&gt; in battle and personally defeated her father Hyperion in combat.\nShe once fell in love with a mortal farmer and the two conceived a daughter named &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Kore&lt;/a&gt;. However her mortal lover passed away, leaving her alone to raise their daughter. She lived with her daughter on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Mount Olympus&lt;/a&gt; until one day she disappeared. Demeter searched the world for her missing daughter but her search proved fruitless. With her daughter lost, she concluded that all of humanity must suffer for it, creating the infamous Endless Winter that caused devastation through plant death, famine, and drought for mortals.\nHades.\nDemeter appears to Zagreus after he reaches the surface for the first time and lends Zagreus her boons to help him escape the Underworld. When Hades learns of Demeter aiding Zagreus, he's fearful of her and is one of the reasons why he is keeping Persephone's existence a secret, partially out of fear of what she would do if she knew the truth about Persephone's disappearence, this is due to Zeus, who took her by surprise and without consulting her or Hades. Even if Persephone wanted to join Hades, whom her mother doesn't like and would blame for everything, Demeter would not accept hearing that her daughter made that choice on her own account. Not even Zeus could contain her fury if Demeter found out the whole truth.\nEpilogue.\nWhen she finally learns that Persephone is the Queen of the Underworld and that Zagreus is her grandson, she takes it relatively calmly. Although she disagrees with Persephone's choice of suitor, she accepts that their hearts do what they want.\nShe lifts the endless winter upon the world except for the entrace to the Underworld.\nHades II.\nDemeter lends her granddaughter &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; her boons once she becomes aware of her existence like the rest of the Olympians.\nAffinity.\nIf given &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;, Demeter will give you the &lt;a href=\"Frostbitten%20Horn\"&gt;Frostbitten Horn&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemeter's affinity gauge is maxed out at 7 hearts, requiring the gifting of 6 Nectar and 1 &lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt;.\nFavor.\nDemeter's favor requires completing the Epilogue, then a few instances of dialogue with her. The favor is completed when Demeter requests Zagreus to \"be more candid with her\" next time.\nWhile it is not possible to forge a bond with Demeter before the Epilogue is completed, maxing out her affinity gauge to the locked heart will count towards the requirements to trigger the Epilogue.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

At least that Charon is amenable to our attempts to contact you.\"\nLow Health.\nDialogue 01.\n Demeter : \n\"Why, you've the look of one who has endured a terribly long winter, Zagreus! I trust you'll cling to life a little longer, now.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Demeter : \n\"I sense your grip on life is coming loose, young Zagreus. Now turn that cold you feel against your enemies.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Demeter : \n\"You seem to be in dire need of some assistance, Zagreus. I think perhaps I have a bit to spare.\"\nDialogue 04.\n Demeter : \n\"You're in the winter of your current stretch of life, aren't you, Zagreus? Do try and live a little longer for me, hm?\"\nDialogue 05.\n Demeter : \n\"You waste away just like a common mortal, Zagreus. How rather unbecoming of a god.\"\nDialogue 06.\n Demeter : \n\"The flame of life is easily extinguished by the cold, young Zagreus. Surely you feel the warmth within you giving way?\"\nDialogue 07.\n Demeter : \n\"Cold comfort for your terrible predicament, young Zagreus, but I am here.\"\nWeapons.\nWielding Exagryph.\n Demeter : \n\"Why isn't that there Sister Hestia's oddly constructed armament you bear?

If it's to be in any hands, then may as well be yours.\"\nWielding Coronacht.\n Demeter : \n\"That's Sister Hera's Heart-Seeker you have! The very weapon which she used to put our predecessors down. It hasn't lost its potency I see. Fear not, I shall not mention this to her, if I see her.\"\nWith Other Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\n Ares: \n\"The cold of death is quite becoming of the Goddess Demeter, do you not think so, my death-dealing kin? She is becoming well accustomed to it, too.\"\n Demeter : \n\"I think that you forget yourself, Lord Ares, sir. For I am much your elder; my famines had already slain the mortals by the tens of thousands by the time such thoughts of doing so first crossed your mind.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Athena: \n\"I bring to you the Lady Demeter, Cousin. I've asked that she please rest assured knowing that have your matter well under control. Though, in her infinite compassion, she has taken up your cause, nevertheless!\"\n Demeter : \n\"Oh, you needn't lavish me with your faint praise, Athena dear. In all your boundless intellect, I'd have expected you would know I see through your intentions, plain as day.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Demeter : \n\"To think, young sprout, our strategist Athena, warrior-goddess, sprang from Zeus's head!! I would expect that no high intellect could come from there.\"\n Athena: \n\"Please do not mind the Lady Demeter's good-natured sense of humor, Zagreus.

Regardless, you'll not coax a better crop from me.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Demeter : \n\"The crops shall wither and decay so long as I may please, young Zagreus. Although we do have those upon Olympus who take issue with my reasoning...\"\n Dionysus: \n\"Um, yeah, milady, I take issue here!

Why, here she is right now!\"\n Demeter : \n\"If you're quite finished blathering, Poseidon, our young Zagreus has more important things to do. He needs your blessings, not your point of view. Don't you, young sprout?\nDialogue 02.\n Demeter : \n\"Ah, little sprout. I was just notifying Lord Poseidon here that all of his domain exists because it pleases me; remember, my good foster-brother, I could freeze your oceans solid if I chose.\"\n Poseidon : \n\"Ah, hahahah! Excellently stated, venerable Goddess Demeter! I'm reminded once more of your vast experience, though, I think we all prefer our oceans liquidy, isn't that right, Nephew?!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Zeus : \n\"Now, now, young man, whatever you heard about good Demeter, I'm here to clear the air. She's like a sister to me, yes, but only thus. Although her Titan parents and my one met the same fate.\"\n Demeter : \n\"Why, Foster-Brother Zeus! Such an unlikely bit of candor there, from you! Almost as though you felt compelled to speak the truth only whilst I'm directly within earshot.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Demeter : \n\"Well now, young sprout, you met the so-called King of the Olympians and I. Whom do you now suppose is genuinely the ruler of this snow encrusted mountaintop of ours?\"\n Zeus : \n\"Oh, hahaha, Lady Demeter, your wit is just as dry as the earth flying quite fallow in your care, perhaps you should go tend to that again though unless we go ahead and help our young man first.\"\nGifts.\n&lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Good Lady Demeter, you've shown me warmth and generosity, and I am very grateful for it. Please, accept this as a small token of my appreciation.\"\n Demeter : \n\"An offering well suited for the season, there, young Zagreus! In turn, as you are honorable and obedient, you'll have from me what the mortals have not.\"\n\"Demeter gives Zagreus the &lt;a href=\"Keepsakes\"&gt;Frostbitten Horn&lt;/a&gt;\"\n Zagreus: \n\"I'm in your debt, great Goddess Demeter.\"\n2nd Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"A little offering for you, good Lady Demeter. I'm deeply grateful for your willingness to aid me in all this.\"\n Demeter : \n\"I must acknowledge and accept your thoughtful gift of nectar, Zagreus; would that the mortals showed deference thus.\"\n3rd Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"May this small offering bring you some joy there on Olympus, Lady Demeter. Thank you for all your help.\"\n Demeter : \n\"A conscientious gift, my little sprout; and I am grateful for your generosity. A bit of nectar cuts straight through the cold, I say.\"\n4th Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Your power and your wisdom has been of such help, good Lady Demeter. I'm honored, and this is the least I can do in exchange.\"\n Demeter : \n\"I was quite certain that the youth today was lacking any sort of tactfulness, young Zagreus. For once I'm thankful to be proven wrong.\"\nAbout Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;.\n Demeter : \n\"All of the love and beauty in the world can wither in a season, Zagreus. Remember that when next the goddess Aphrodite makes her promises.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;.\n Demeter : \n\"Lord Ares already got hold of you, has he? He's good at making mortals kill each other, yes. But he has utterly no knack for subtlety.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;.\n Demeter : \n\"The gentle Artemis already found you, Zagreus? She takes my orders well; one cannot blame her, for she'd have nothing to hunt if not for me.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;.\n Demeter : \n\"Athena has imparted you her wisdom, Zagreus? A simulacrum of the real thing, at any rate. True wisdom only comes with age, I think.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Demeter : \n\"You stumbled into Dionysus, Zagreus? One of these days I shall prevent his vineyards all from ripening; put to the test his carefree attitude.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Minor%20Characters\"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt;.\n Demeter : \n\"I have a brother, Helios, the Sun. A nonsense-talker with a flaming chariot. Why, he once told me that my Kore,that she went into that Underworld of yours! Preposterous. The clouds now blot him out entirely.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Minor%20Characters\"&gt;Hyperion&lt;/a&gt;.\n Demeter : \n\"We all are willful children, are we not? I'm daughter to Hyperion, you know; a Titan so obscure and hated that Lord Zeus, he started calling me his birth-sister, so much did he dislike this bit of truth! And to get a rise out of me, too.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;.\n Demeter : \n\"You bear the blessing of Poseidon, Zagreus? Someday I shall remind him of his place, and freeze his watery domain entirely.\"\nDialogue 01.\n Demeter : \n\"I see the noble King of the Olympians has reached you prior to me, Zagreus. I wonder which of all his many lies he's told you last.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Demeter : \n\"I ought to warn you that my foster-brother Zeus, he has just a disgusting sense of humor, little sprout. He'd have you think he sired half the countryside! I have to shudder at the very thought.\"\nDialogue 01.\n Demeter : \n\"You are entirely too young to have had meaningful experience with loss, young Zagreus. Pray to me that you never have to learn.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Demeter : \n\"My foster-brother's wayward son appears! I, too, once lost a child, Zagreus. I was quite foolish with her from the start. Her father was a baseborn farm-boy; worshipped me! He's gone as well, of course. Only the cold remains.\"\nBeing Invited to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt; (Pre-Epilogue).\n Zagreus: \n\"Hope Mother knows what she's doing, in the name of Hades! Olympus, this is an official message! Lady Demeter, this is for you.\"\n Demeter : \n\"What's all of this, young Zagreus, a message of some sort, for me, indeed? I... can't decipher it, although... it bears the marks of my two foster-brothers here, and... well! It seems we'd better compare notes!\"\nPost-Epilogue.\n Demeter : \n\"Why, little sprout, young Zagreus... my grandson! I can scarce believe it, still! To think that, Kore, or... Persephone, my daughter... she had been with Foster-Brother Hades, all this time! A match I wouldn't have expected...or approved. That's why she left! Our blasted hearts do what they want.\""}

She must be growing soft!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Demeter : \n\"\"Ahh\", you bear the blessing of Poseidon! Surely such a loud and blustering god must have more than sufficient might to back it up?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Demeter : \n\"So Poseidon has again availed himself to you! Well, good, and may he prove of use. I'll hold my threat to freeze his oceans then, for now.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;.\n Demeter : \n\"Your fair cousin Apollo wields the light that mortals so cherish, for it brings them warmth, melting away my snow. With my permission, of course! His power shall only help you so much.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hestia\"&gt;Hestia&lt;/a&gt;.\n Demeter : \n\"So Hestia gave you her gift of flame? Normally the old miser wants nothing to do with any of us, not even her sisters. But extraordinary times do call for extraordinary measures.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;.\n Demeter : \n\"Normally, sweet Aphrodite's power over beauty provides no shortage of entertainment I'm sure, though I fail to see how her blessing can be of much benefit in such a predicament as ours.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;.\n Demeter : \n\"You're making haste, flower! I'd swear that you were graced by swift Hermes himself, except he must be too busy keeping watch over our enemies to be of much benefit to you.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Selene\"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt;.\n Demeter : \n\"There's a touch of moonlight about you, flower, as though Selene lights your way. Would that the Moon concerned herself with more than her path across the sky...\"\nWith Other Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Demeter : \n\"When my sisters and my foster-brothers and I overthrew Chronos long ago, we were much closer to \"your \"age, flower. Now we are older, and one should think wiser... although our frequent bickering and inaction suggest otherwise.\"\n Zeus : \n\"We are a strong-willed family, as you know perfectly well, Lady Demeter. We must move forward in unison! Building that sort of consensus is not always quick; though we each could do our part to hasten it along.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus : \n\"Our upstart enemies shall scatter to the Four Winds once we're through with them! Our challenge is to purge them whilst minimizing unspeakable devastation. And Lady Demeter could always make the Earth re-grow.\"\n Demeter : \n\"Well, Lord Zeus... it is much harder to re-grow where not a trace of life remains. But that's of little consequence right now. Let all who oppose us \"wither! \"And we shall salt the Earth beneath their feet.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Demeter : \n\"Of late, even my radiant young sister must sully her delicate hands in all the field work that must be done. She is even beginning to take to it... aren't you, Hera our Queen?\"\n Hera : \n\"\"Oh\", Demeter. These hands have seen more than you know! I simply do not flaunt the hardships I've endured. One \"can \"be as strong as a rock, without taking on its texture.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hera : \n\"Much as your father was custodian of all the dead, so are we responsible for the rest of the world! The hour has grown dark, yes, but... we have the power to \"restore. \"Thanks be to my good sister Demeter...\"\n Demeter : \n\"The time for restoration always comes as does the spring.

Isn't that right, dear foster-sister?\"\n Demeter : \n\"Oh, Poseidon! You needn't lie to young Melino\u00eb like that. It sends a terrible impression, and may make her hold you in as much contempt as do I!

I'm reminded that you are her grandchild, after all. \"Erm\", wait, she wants to speak to you herself!\"\n Demeter : \n\"Thank you for your advocacy services, Apollo. Should I have need of them again, I shall apprise you. For now, my granddaughter requires our abilities, not honeyed words.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Demeter : \n\"Aid from Olympus can take many different forms... as not all of us are suitably prepared or even \"built \"to face significant ordeals.

I may be more a lover than a fighter, but that doesn't mean I won't mangle the faces of our foes, if that is what it takes to get them to \"back off! \"Now why don't we show your granddaughter how well we get along?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Aphrodite : \n\"You and your Granny Demeter, you must have \"so \"much catching up to do! Perhaps you even have the power to un-freeze that disapproving scowl I oft fear is \"permanently \"set, though... I can see she wishes to address you now herself!\"\n Demeter : \n\"Please pay no heed to Aphrodite, flower. She's more concerned about the contours of my face than doing anything of use. But on the count that we've much catching up to do, she's right...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hephaestus\"&gt;Hephaestus&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Demeter : \n\"Even \"I \"could use a bit of heat on some occasions, flower, which the forge of Hephaestus here provides. Perhaps as compensation for the utter lack of \"warmth \"between most members of our family.\"\n Hephaestus : \n\"\"Ah\", just \"listen \"to the Lady Demeter! Everybody on our mountaintop thinks they're \"so sharp\", but \"this \"one? She is blunt like my hammer.

But now we got something in common, witchie: \"you! \"I say you've got things well under control, but I... can't fool the likes of Lady Demeter!\"\n Demeter : \n\"Not one of us has \"got things well under control\", Granddaughter.

I have on good authority that \"somebody \"around here's laid a claim to being \"Eldest of Olympus. \"Oh, Demeter? Care to explain \"that \"one?\"\n Demeter : \n\"Hestia, you had \"abandoned \"us!

I thought perhaps it would provide a bit of cheer...\"\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Demeter : \n\"My understanding was your line could scarce survive beyond the reaches of the Underworld.

If you mean to visit our mountain, merely follow the path of desolation leading straight to us...\"\nDialogue 03.\n Demeter : \n\"Fear not for this mountaintop, nor for the Earth; for she is far more resilient than us all.

Not unlike \"you\", for they too hold power far beyond that suggested by their form.\"\nAbout Legendary Boon.\nDialogue 01.\n Demeter : \n\"As the sapling struggles to grow, so too must we push ourselves to discover our truest potential. Behold my power over life and death; may you find yours.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Demeter : \n\"The seasons are a never-ending cycle of decay and renewal... though there are such times when the seasons assert themselves much more fiercely than usual; times such as \"now.\"\nGifts.\n&lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"To think the goddess of seasons herself is my grandmother.

{"id": "2515", "revid": "30972", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2515", "title": "Demeter/Relationships", "text": "Family.\nPersephone.\n&lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt;: Demeter's daughter.&lt;br&gt;Demeter loves her daughter, adoring her and calling her Kore (the name Demeter gives her) instead of Persephone, which she prefers to be called. She was extremely protective of her because Demeter believed her daughter was fragile due to being half mortal. When Persephone disappeared, it affected Demeter, turning the once gentle and generous goddess into a cold and vengeful one.\nShe blamed Mortalkind for her daughter's disappearance and unleashed her wrath upon them by casting an endless winter upon the world. It is repeatedly suggested that if Demeter were to uncover the truth about Persephone's abduction, it could lead to a war between the Olympian gods and the chthonic gods, or even among the Olympian gods themselves, due to Zeus's involvement. Once Persephone reveals herself to the Olympians (with a slightly altered retelling of the events to suggest that Persephone simply fled), Demeter is simply relieved to know that her daughter is alive, even if she does not approve of her husband's choice.\nFrom then on, Persephone and Demeter come to an agreement where Persephone must spend 6 months of the year on Olympus and the rest of the time with her husband and son. Humiliated by having lost her daughter before due to harsh treatment, Demeter seems to have significantly softened towards Persephone, and whenever Persephone is in the underworld, she regularly asks Zagreus to send her regards.\nIn the second game, after Chronos kidnaps Persephone, she vows not to lose her again, even if it means freezing the flames of hell to have her back.\nZagreus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;: Demeter's grandson.&lt;br&gt;Initially, she presents herself as a cold and distant leader in Zagreus' presence and doesn't understand why he would exchange the underworld where she lives for the frozen surface, always cold and grumpy. But gradually she begins to accept him and reciprocate the kindness he offers her so he can escape. Upon discovering that Zagreus is actually her grandson, she becomes more drawn to him and starts to act more sensibly and lovingly in his presence. \nDemeter starts to soften simply out of relief, but soon she begins to look upon Zagreus more kindly. He gives her a reason to smile, gradually warming the heart that was once cold and hopeless.\nMelino\u00eb.\n&lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;: Demeter's granddaughter.&lt;br&gt;After the first game, Persephone gave birth to her second grandchild. Demeter acts much more warmly towards her granddaughter, lending her strength so she can achieve her goal of saving Persephone and Zagreus. However, due to the war against Chronos, she has no time to spare, and any closeness between them must wait. Demeter did not meet Melino\u00eb; she assumed she had met the same fate. During their eventual encounter, Demeter finds Melino\u00eb remarkably similar to Persephone and uses the same endearing nickname with Zagreus, \"little sprout.\" She is determined to retrieve Persephone again, even if it means freezing hell itself to do so, and believes her granddaughter will help her with that.\nHestia.\n&lt;a href=\"Hestia\"&gt;Hestia&lt;/a&gt;: Demeter's older sister.&lt;br&gt;She mentions her sister in the dialogue about Exagryph. She says that there is no strangely armament more elaborate than that of Sister Hestia and that she has always been so predisposed to flames.\nHera.\n&lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt;: Demeter's younger sister.&lt;br&gt;She mentions her sister in the dialogue about Coronacht, referring to it as the same weapon that Hera used to defeat their predecessors. She acknowledges that the weapon has not lost its power and assures Zagreus not to be afraid and promises not to mention it to Hera if she happens to encounter her.\nHelios.\n&lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt;: Demeter's brother.&lt;br&gt;When Helios from his chariot across the sky informed her of what had happened to Persephone, she not only didn't believe him but also blocked out the sun.\nSelene.\n&lt;a href=\"Selene\"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt;: Demeter's sister.\nEos.\n&lt;a href=\"Eos\"&gt;Eos&lt;/a&gt;: Demeter's sister.\nHyperion.\nHyperion: Demeter's father.&lt;br&gt;Hyperion was said to be a terrible father, even more than the Titan &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;. Demeter hated Hyperion and personally slew him with the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Fists\"&gt;Twin Fists of Malphon&lt;/a&gt; by pummeling him so much that his immortal body was thoroughly pulverized and even his legacy was erased.\nTheia.\nTheia: Demeter's mother.&lt;br&gt;She refers to Theia as \"whoever she is\" implying that she was not part of Demeter's life.\nOlympian Gods.\nThe Olympians are Demeter's adoptive family. She has a long-standing enmity with them, stemming from the abduction of her daughter, Persephone, which resulted in the infamous \"Endless Winter.\"\nZeus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;: Demeter's foster brother.&lt;br&gt;Demeter regards Zeus as an adopted brother, but blames him for mortals mistaking their real relationship as true brother-sister. She despises his deceitful nature, cynically questioning which ideas he's implanting in young Zagreus's mind, highlighting his deceptive nature and disgusting humor, speaking for her part the deities are her relatives . He is the Olympian who seems least to fear her, and remains calm in her presence, but deep down, shamelessly showing her false condolences for Persephone's disappearance, without even a hint of remorse, even though he knows he's primarily responsible. \nDuring the epilogue, Zeus is superficially forgiven easily, as for now, she seemed to ease the situation at her daughter's request. But it's only superficial. Demeter still has many things to discuss with him, as she still left a part of Olympus frozen, showing that she hasn't forgotten the occasion.\nPoseidon.\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;: Demeter's foster brother.&lt;br&gt;Demeter does not have a pious relationship with Poseidon. He tells Zagreus that despite his subtle approach, she enjoys mocking him. Demeter will continue to speak ill of him indirectly, telling Zagreus that she has more important things to do than listen to Poseidon. They do not share the same opinion about the weather, and Demeter probably has a long and complicated history of struggle with him.\nIn the Duo - Poseidon and Demeter, she says that his domain only exists because it pleases her; she could completely freeze it if she wanted to.\nAthena.\n&lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;: Demeter's foster niece.&lt;br&gt;She praises her foster niece Athena for her 'wisdom', and is amazed that she emerged from the head of Zeus!! Since she wouldn't expect any high intellect to emerge from there. Although Demeter thinks Athena has the best of intentions, Demeter notices her weak praise and considers her adopted niece to be a bit sycophantic and condescending and sees through her intentions like daylight. \nShe doesn't appreciate the way she omniscient knows everything, and thinks that true wisdom comes with age, and not that it is innate.\nAres.\n&lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;: Demeter's nephew.&lt;br&gt;Ares is the nephew of Demeter through her sister Hera, yet she does not accord him differential treatment in relation to her other adopted nieces and nephews. He mentions her as a companion of death, which has claimed many mortal lives, Demeter is displeased. She responds, reminding Ares that her famines had taken tens of thousands of mortal lives long before Ares gave it a second thought.\nHephaestus.\n&lt;a href=\"Hephaestus\"&gt;Hephaestus&lt;/a&gt;: Demeter's nephew.&lt;br&gt;\nArtemis.\n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;: Demeter's foster niece.&lt;br&gt;Though they share similar views of Athena, Demeter and Artemis differ in their opinions about mortals. While Artemis complains about the challenging snowy weather hindering their hunts, Demeter warns that humans are resourceful and deceitful, suggesting they will adapt and find alternative means, showcasing their differing perspectives on mortals as well.\nApollo.\n&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;: Demeter's foster nephew.&lt;br&gt;Their relationship is currently unknown.\nAphrodite.\n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;: The Goddess of Love and Beauty.&lt;br&gt;Despite being the goddess of love, Demeter claims that Aphrodite can be particularly venomous towards all the Olympians. Aphrodite will say how Demeter is pitiful for neglecting her appearance or how she has become cold and rigid. Demeter hints at how young Aphrodite is, considering her superficial intentions and interests.\nHermes.\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;: Demeter's foster nephew.&lt;br&gt;Hermes complains about how much he's been fearing the cold lately, as it has been interfering with his work. He sarcastically remarks, \"We have Demeter to thank for that,\" implying that it's her fault. Hermes doesn't like crossing paths with Demeter, as she doesn't value his services much. He hopes that spending time with Zagreus will lift her spirits and warm her heart.\nDionysus.\n&lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;: Demeter's foster nephew.&lt;br&gt;Dionysus finds Demeter very uptight and disagrees that the plants must die in winter, he considers this a great exaggeration. He thinks his aunt should relax and enjoy some good wine with him. She warns him that drinking less wine for a while might do him good.\nChthonic Gods.\nThe gods of the underworld, most of whom the Olympians seem to despise, including Demeter.\nHades.\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;: Demeter's foster brother and son-in-law.&lt;br&gt;Demeter finds her brother dull and dislikes his dark presence. He is undoubtedly the last suitor she would ever want for her daughter. Hades is terrified of her and is keeping Persephone's existence a secret, partially out of fear of what she would do. Hades, in particular, calls her a \"witch\" who could do terrible things if she was angry. \nWhen Demeter found out the whole truth, she was incredibly willing to accept that her daughter was married to him and loved him. She does so primarily to avoid losing her daughter again, rather than approving of him as a worthy consort for her Kore.\nThe Titans.\nThe previous rulers of the world, defeated in the Titan War and imprisoned in the pits of &lt;a href=\"Tartarus\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt;. \nChronos.\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;:"}

He offers &lt;a href=\"boons\"&gt;boons&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; revolving around his signature Status Curse, Hangover, slowing, and stunning enemies, as well as various drinking-themed Boons.\nDionysus offers strong damage over time abilities on nearly all his offensive boons. However, he can also give Zagreus strong utility abilities in the forms of stuns, slows, heals and health, damage reduction effects, and items.\nHis signature &lt;a href=\"Status%20Curse\"&gt;Status Curse&lt;/a&gt; is Hangover, which deals continuous damage to afflicted enemies every half second. Hangover can be stacked onto an enemy up to a base amount of 5 times, and stacks wear off one at a time after 4 seconds.\nDionysus returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;\" and offers his boons to &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the first game, Dionysus appears in a specific chamber in-person. He can be encountered on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Mount Olympus&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nDionysus is usually very receptive, fun-loving, and playful, and he joins in helping &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; because he finds him entertaining to watch while drinking a good wine. Even his speech tends to be a little slurred, as if he's always a little drunk.\nGood-natured, Dionysus is probably the friendliest among his &lt;a href=\"Olympians\"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt;, and he only cares about one thing: having fun. He uses informal terms to address his cousin, like \"guy\" or \"Prince Z\" while genuinely helping Zagreus and teaching him the art of playing pranks. Although some of his family members think that he is only participating because he considers it all a \"festival,\" Dionysus genuinely thinks discovering a long-lost relative is cause for celebration. \nHowever, like his fellow gods, Dionysus has his pride and will turn on his cousin during the Trial of the Gods if Zagreus doesn't pick his boon first. Unlike everyone else who genuinely gets angry with Zagreus momentarily, Dionysus simply gets disappointed.\n&lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt; notes that Dionysus is the only god on Olympus who genuinely seems to like mortals, possibly because he was once a demigod.\nPhysical description.\nDionysus appears as a dark-skinned man with a toned body and long dark blue hair with curls. His eyes are purple and sports a small stubble. In addition, his cheeks are flushed due to his constant drinking.\nFor clothing, he wears a short, wide, smoky purple chiton and wears gold bracelets on his wrists and thighs and adorns his shoulders with grape vines and animal skin. On his head he wears an ivy crown with grapes. On his right arm rests a staff of fennel adorned with a pine cone (the thyrsus which symbolizes prosperity, fertility, and hedonism) and between his thumb and index fingers he holds a single grape. On his left hand he holds a drinking cup that emits a purple smoke.\nIn Hades II, Dionysus only wears a leopard-print thong while holding several wine cups.\nHades.\nDionysus will eventually reach out to Zagreus and lend his help in the prince's escape attempts. Having grown in a very secluded place, Zagreus is surprised at first to experience revelry, even if minimal.\nAfter Zagreus reaches the surface for the first time, Dionysus will comment how the gods in Olympus could feel his presence, but then suddenly ceased to do so. Nonetheless, this doesn't let that stop him from trying to help his dear cousin.\nSomehow, Dionysus came to know that Orpheus hasn't been feeling his best lately, and so, to cheer him up, he asks Zagreus to come up with a tale about how they're one and the same, hoping this will bring creativity and lift the spirits of the musician. In the end, the prank got out of hand, but Dionysus is satisfied with the result.\nIn the Epilogue, Dionysus shows up at the family reunion party completely drunk and emptied the whole stash of drinks the House had prepared. After the party, he continues to help Zagreus on his new job of testing the defences of the Underworld.\nHades II.\nDionysus refuses to participate in the war against Chronos and has fallen into a drunken stupor. When Melino\u00eb encounters him, Dionysus is holding a secret party and briefly confuses her with Zagreus. Afterwards, he gives Melino\u00eb his boons whenever she visits.\nDuring one of Melino\u00eb's visits, Dionysus requests her to relay an invitation to his feast to &lt;a href=\"Prometheus\"&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt;. Melino\u00eb begrudgingly does this task but Prometheus refuses the invitation.\nAffinity.\nIf given &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;, Dionysus will give you the &lt;a href=\"Overflowing%20Cup\"&gt;Overflowing Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nDionysus's affinity gauge is maxed out at 7 hearts.\nFavor.\nDionysus's favor requires forging bonds with at least 6 different characters, and gifting a minimum of 10 to any number of characters.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

But I have \"just \"the thing to go with her!\" \n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;.\n Dionysus: \n\"\"Hoh-ho\", no way Zag, looking like you got yourself a gift from old Poseidon there? He's quite the catch, but here, hope you saved some room for more!\" \n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;.\n Dionysus: \n\"Felt a shiver in the air just now, and that can only mean that chilly Demeter decided to give you a little help, there, huh?

We know you're going to make it, I would say eventually?\" \n&lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Dionysus: \n\"You know, Zag, maybe once you get here, you could get old Ares to just lighten up a little, you know, man? Always dragging down the mood, with talk of blood, and nastiness, all sorts of stuff like that!\" \n Ares: \n\"Why, my Lord Dionysus! I fail to see why such discussion is perceived as unbecoming of a feast. A successfully conducted war is certainly a cause for celebration, is it not?\" \nDialogue 02.\n Ares: \n\"Ah, my kin! I was just inquiring with Lord Dionysus here, under which circumstances are the greatest mortal feasts of all prepared? Because I have a certain hunch, regarding that...\" \n Dionysus: \n\"Yeah, yeah, Ares, I will hand it to you, man. There's nothing like a feast after a war, all right! Provided you're on the surviving side, that is! Otherwise I guess they'll be feasting with \"you \"down there, Zag!\" \n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Dionysus: \n\"Hey Zag, got a favor here I mean to ask, could you maybe persuade the Lady Demeter to ease up on the whole \"'not let anything grow' \"thing she's been going on about?\" \n Demeter: \n\"I daresay, my Lord Dionysus, that partaking of less wine for some amount of time might do you good. Regardless, you'll not coax a better crop from me.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Demeter: \n\"The crops shall wither and decay so long as I may please, young Zagreus. Although we do have those upon Olympus who take issue with my reasoning...\" \n Dionysus: \n\"\"Erm\", yeah, milady, I take issue here! I mean how are the grapes supposed to grow and wine supposed to flow when you are so uptight, now, just ease up a little there, let's see what we can do!\" \n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Dionysus: \n\"Look, Zag, you should know by now that when it comes to feasting, it's Yours Truly here who puts on the best performance. But I do have Lady Aphrodite's help!\" \n Aphrodite: \n\"Wine does have a rather special way of making everybody look even more beautiful than ever, Dionysus dear! And from such beauty, why, long-lasting love is born! And also shorter-lasting love, much of the time.\" \nDialogue 02.\n Aphrodite: \n\"My powers, dearest, oft go hand-in-hand with those of Dionysus, with his power to persuade the mind to find such beauty where it isn't, really!\" \n Dionysus: \n\"\"Ah, haha\", no need to flatter me like that, there, Lady Aphrodite! Beauty's almost entirely within the mind, I'm sure! And in the muscles and the jawline and the winning smile and, well, who am I to tell you, yeah?\" \n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Dionysus: \n\"Zag, man, I was just attempting here to get our good friend Artemis to finally make an appearance at one of my feasts, it's just... wouldn't you know, she's all preoccupied, something about a hunt?\" \n Artemis: \n\"That's right, Lord Dionysus, a \"hunt\"! Which requires lots and lots of \"total quiet\", and clear-minded focus. So, if you'll excuse me?\" \nDialogue 02.\n Artemis: \n\"Oh, great, it's you, Zagreus! Here, let me offer you some fine new Boons, as well as Lord Dionysus here, who I am sure would love to talk your ear off just as much as mine!\" \n Dionysus: \n\"\"Eh\", tells me I'm being awful loud, and to back off, all sorts of nasty stuff like that, what can you do, though, right?\" \nBeing Invited to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt; (Pre-Epilogue).\n Zagreus: \n\"Hope this lives up to your expectations, mate.

It seemed like you were rather close, but then, we couldn't see you anymore from here, and now you're back? Well, give another go!\" \nDialogue 02.\n Dionysus: \n\"Want you to know something, here, man.

So you get out of there, and you'll be more than welcome here, with us!\" \nAbout Legendary Boon.\nDialogue 01.\n Dionysus: \n\"\"Oh-hoh\", Zag, have I got something special here for you, I mean \"this \"here is top-notch stuff, \"even \"among the top-notch stuff I have to give, just look at this!\" \nDialogue 02.\n Dionysus: \n\"Look, man, I am feeling generous right now, know what I mean?

I'd no idea you could get that stuff downstairs! Do me a solid, though, hang on to any more you find, or better yet, give it away! I'd hate to think even a drop has gone to waste!\" \nDialogue 02.\n Dionysus: \n\"Well, would you just look at yourself, Zag! You are like a walking stockpile of Ambrosia, aren't you? Taking the best care of it, at that. I knew I could count on you, but... \"&lt;Sniff&gt; \"I didn't know I could be just so proud of you, you know, man?\" \nDialogue 03.\n Dionysus: \n\"Zag, turns out I am quite the judge of character, and you, man, have an \"awful \"lot of it, I mean, you've given out how much Ambrosia now?

Have I mentioned how pleased I am to have made your acquaintance?\" \n Dionysus: \n\"\"Hoh-oh\", what, is that for me, \"really\", I mean, cheers man, that is awful generous of you, I'm much obliged!\" \n3rd Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Lord Dionysus mate, you have made the mood down here materially less miserable, and I am much obliged.\" \n Dionysus: \n\"What, is that for me, why Zag, I mean you really shouldn't have, you know I can't get enough of this stuff, right?\" \n4th Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Lord Dionysus mate, you must have no shortage of supreme vintage at your disposal, but this one's from me.\" \n Dionysus: \n\"Why Zag, how positively thoughtful, man, I mean I love it, positively love this stuff, and I am very moved that you would think of me for it!\" \n5th Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Hey, on no occasion whatsoever, cheers to you again, Lord Dionysus mate! This place is so much less dreary under your influence!\" \n Dionysus: \n\"Ah, this is the greatest, Zag! This feast I'm headed to? I was getting a little concerned I wasn't going to have quite enough to go around for everyone. Well, you just saved my evening, man! Too bad you couldn't be there, yeah?\" \n6th Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Dionysus mate, sometimes things weigh heavily on me, but then I hear from you, and it's like I don't have a care in the world! To your health!\" \n Dionysus: \n\"Oh, you're really too much for me sometimes, you know that, man? Got to tell you, I don't think I ever felt so close to somebody so damn far away. But through the gift of drink? It's like we're with each other in spirit, all the time, you know?\" \n&lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"What does one offer to the god of wine?

To have such a connection, with you despite all the distance between us...!\" \n Dionysus: \n\"Zag, I cannot believe what you are offering to me! Ambrosia, man, for \"me\"? And talk about a bottle that has seen some wild days and nights, I mean if it got all the way to you down there, only to come back up! Know what? I'm saving it, till we can share it, here!\" "}

Dionysus is aware that his father, Zeus, generally perceives him as someone irresponsible who rarely takes things seriously and underestimates him. However, he possesses the talent to please his father, who is notably indulgent with him.\nZeus held such great paternal affection for Dionysus that he elevated him to the status of a full god and invited him to reside on Mount Olympus. \nDionysus is sociable and excels in social gatherings. Zeus observes that Dionysus is polite in his interactions and always shows the due respect, finding him decent company for Zagreus.\nAthena.\n&lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;: Dionysus' half-sister.&lt;br&gt;She indirectly criticizes him, suggesting that some of his relatives are participating only because they consider all of this a festival. However, it can be suggested that, unlike Athena, who may be acting, he genuinely thinks discovering a long-lost relative is cause for celebration.\nAres.\n&lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;: Dionysus' half-brother.&lt;br&gt;Dionysus finds Ares too tempestuous. He thinks Zagreus can help him feel lighter. Ares seems to enjoy the parties his youngest half-brother throws, but dislikes his general passivity.\nAphrodite.\n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;: The Goddess of Love and Beauty.&lt;br&gt;She seems to have a good relationship with Dionysus, considering him to be sociable to the fullest and referring to him as a common brother. She participates in his revelries, telling Dionysus how amazing it is to have the power to persuade minds through wine, which flatters Dionysus.\nArtemis.\n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;: Dionysus' half-sister.&lt;br&gt;He regards Artemis as a kind of hermit. Dionysus has tried more than once to include her in his usual feasts and revelries, but she cannot stand the noise. She disapproves of Dionysus' inconsequential lifestyle. In her dialogues with Zagreus, she warns him not to get involved with her partying half-brother.\nApollo.\n&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;: Dionysus' half-brother.&lt;br&gt;Their relationship is currently unknown. \nHermes.\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;: Dionysus' half-brother.&lt;br&gt;Hermes is Dionysus's older half-brother, and both of them are playful. Hermes tells Zagreus that Dionysus never feels like life is moving too fast. He also comments on Dionysus' ability to throw a great feast, hinting that he's probably attended many such parties with his brother.\nDemeter.\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;: Dionysus' foster aunt.&lt;br&gt;Dionysus finds Demeter very uptight and disagrees that the plants must die in winter, which he considers it a great exaggeration. He thinks his aunt should relax and enjoy some good wine with him. She warns him that drinking less wine for a while might do him good.\nPoseidon.\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;: Dionysus' uncle.&lt;br&gt;Poseidon seems to get along well with his nephew Dionysus, considering him similar, as they are both very relaxed, receptive and enjoy a good time and consider joining a feast with Zagreus as well.\nNonetheless, it seems Dionysus fears his uncle to a degree, similarly to his father, likely due to his authority and how he's from an older generation.\nChthonic Gods.\nThe Gods of the Underworld.\nHades.\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;: Dionysus' uncle.&lt;br&gt; As someone who values work, Hades isn't too fond of Dionysus's life style of constant partying. He's even afraid the feast won't be good enough because of Dionysus's insane drinking habit.\nZagreus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;: Dionysus' cousin.&lt;br&gt; Initially, he helps Zagreus because he doesn't have anything else interesting to do, and it's been a long time since anything \"bombastic\" has happened. Dionysus shares a relaxed and genuine relationship with Zagreus and like the other Olympians, offers his aid to his cousin. He refers to him as \"Zag\", \"guy' or \"Prince Z\". At one point, the two collaborate together in pranking Orpheus, leading the musician to believe that the two are the same person. Dionysus plans to have an epic feast and party with Zagreus once Zagreus reaches Olympus.\nMelino\u00eb.\n&lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;: Dionysus' cousin.\nUnderworld Residents.\nTheseus.\n&lt;a href=\"Theseus\"&gt;Theseus&lt;/a&gt;: Hero of Athens.&lt;br&gt;Dionysus admits that he doesn't like Theseus for abandoning Ariadne shortly after defeating Asterius. Nonetheless, he'll grant him his help if called upon.\nOrpheus.\n&lt;a href=\"Orpheus\"&gt;Orpheus&lt;/a&gt;: Court Musician.&lt;br&gt;He proposes to Zagreus to have some \"harmless fun\" with Orpheus by tricking him into believing in an epic narrative where he and Zagreus are one and the same. When Zagreus does it, Dionysus has a good laugh. Orpheus later composes a song about it called the \"&lt;a href=\"Hymn%20to%20Zagreus\"&gt;Hymn to Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;\".\nOthers.\nAriadne.\nAriadne: Dionysus's lover.\nIt was Dionysus that rescued Ariadne after she was abandoned by Theseus on the Island of Naxos. He'll tell Zagreus she's a nice lass and very attractive, and that they'll talk once Zagreus reaches Olympus.\nChaos.\n&lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt;: The ancestor of Dionysus.&lt;br&gt;Chaos finds entertainment in Dionysus's unpredictability, much like Zagreus."}

Her mood swings are constant, oscillating between friendliness and menace. Yet, once people get to know her, they realize she's not as she appears; everyone understands she's harmless to her peers.\nHer personality is primarily mischievous, relaxed, sarcastic, and somewhat lethargic, though she maintains a friendly and even casual relationship with &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;. She often speaks of her endeavors in 'haunting,' to which the protagonist provides guidance and encouragement.\nDora can also alter her appearance to exude a more menacing aura, often speaking in macabre and theatrical terms when doing so. Additionally, her ghostly form allows her to enact 'minor possessions,' which presumably allows her to inhabit objects (like Melino\u00eb's mushroom bottle, as per her jests) to some degree.\nA few characters, such as &lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt;, mention that there are rumors about Dora being a wicked, vengeful, and untrustworthy spirit, and that Melino\u00eb should stay away. However, in their interactions, Dora is only friendly and not at all apathetic towards Melino\u00eb, indicating that even its official title \"listless shade\" is mere speculation.\nRegarding the events of Hades II, particularly the renewed siege on Olympus by &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;, she primarily expresses a lack of familiarity with them. She sees &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Olympus&lt;/a&gt; as the domain of Melino\u00eb's less agreeable relatives, and views Chronos as a malevolent figure, albeit one who has never personally wronged her.\nPhysical description.\nIn her casual form, Dora is a smugly smiling shade with long hair and bangs that almost cover her eyes, as well as large hands that resemble the paws of a cat. By contrast, her 'haunting' form is lengthened, and has sharper features; it is further shrouded in shadow, marked by piercing yellow eyes with no irises, and a silhouetted, sharp mouth.\nDecorations.\nAs of the Olympic Update, Dora can be interacted with to add decorations to &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;. This costs a mixture of a new resource &lt;a href=\"Prestige\"&gt;Prestige&lt;/a&gt; and occasionally additional harvested resources.

You trifle with powers far beyond your comprehension, witch. Speak!\"\n Dora : \n\" \"...That was pretty decent, right, Mel? Maybe pushing it. OK if I call you \"witch \"like that?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"Witch \"worked for me in context, and a solid haunting all in all, Dora. But, I'd better run. Something I have to do.\"\n Dora : \n\"\"Then begone!\"\nKeepsake Dialogue (&lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Onion\"&gt;Ghost Onion&lt;/a&gt;).\nTBA\nAbout the Scenery.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//hades.fandom.com/wiki/The_Crossroads%23Melino%25C3%25AB%27s_Tent%3A~%3Atext%3DSub%252DLocations-%2CMelino%25C3%25AB%2527s%2520Tent%2C-%25E2%2580%259C\"&gt;Melino\u00eb's Tent&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Dora, couldn't help but notice that my jar collection wasn't sorted properly. I would never store fungus with herbs. Are you trying to subtly drive me mad?\"\n Dora : \n\"No... Although, now that you put it that way, maybe in the future, \"yes\". I was working on minor possessions and your mushroom bottle kind of slipped. So I put it back!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You put it \"incorrectly \"back. I... \"augh\". Just tell me of such things next time, would you?\"\n Dora : \n\"Maybe I will, maybe I won't.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Dora : \n\"You know, Mel, you can be a bit uptight sometimes. Where'd you even get that from? Even the head witch is more relaxed than you.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Look I'm under a lot of pressure right now, all right? Everybody's counting on me to literally \"kill Time... \"so I would like this tent to be an orderly place! Seeing as I'm having to return so often...\"\n Dora : \n\"\"Eh\", so what? Killing time's my specialty, don't see \"me \"gettin' all worked up.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"Ungh...\"\nDialogue 03.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Dora, I was thinking... if I promise not to be so \"uptight\", as you call it... would you promise not to move my belongings about when I'm away?\"\n Dora : \n\"\"How dare you make demands of me, you insignificant fleck? Mmm\", nope, no deal. Want to be uptight, go ahead. Don't stop on my account.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You just want to keep messing with my stuff!\"\n Dora : \n\"\"Mmm\", that's right.\"\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It's been nice to see you out and about a little more often lately, not just cooped up in here. How are you managing? \"\n Dora : \n\"\"Eh\", I'm managing. Those other Shades don't know the first thing about haunting, and it turns out they've got the dirt on \"everybody \"here... including \"you.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Comforting to know the brunt of our resistance is enjoying themselves a good bit of gossip.\"\n Dora : \n\"\"Ohh \"yeah.\"\nOceanus.\n Dora : \n\"Hey, you're up. You were out a while. See anything good down there that time?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I fought past Erebus, down into Oceanus. It was so strange, being underneath the sea. Do you remember the sea, Dora?\"\n Dora : \n\"The sea... the sea, the sea, the sea, \"that's \"the thing with all the \"water \"in it, \"right? \"Heard it's nice \"sometimes! \"Also \"kills \"a bunch of people, death by drowning, so... \"Huh\", I've been getting mixed messages, I guess.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It's a big place...\"\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You must remember something of life on the surface, right, Dora? Anything at all? I wonder what it must have been like.\"\n Dora : \n\"I \"don't \"remember, and I \"don't \"wonder! Who cares? \"This \"is the life, right here.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"&lt;Sigh&gt;\"\n&lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Mourning\"&gt;Fields of Mourning&lt;/a&gt;.\n Dora : \n\"\"Oof\", you look rough, if we're being honest, Mel. Want to talk about it, or at least tell me the juicy bits because I'm bored?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Last night I visited the Mourning Fields, and... being surrounded by that much despair... I think I must have brought some of it home.\"\n Dora : \n\"Well why don't I just \"scare it out of you, you wretched worm?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Hey that worked.\"\n Dora : \n\"I know, right?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Thessaly\"&gt;Rift of Thessaly&lt;/a&gt;.\n Dora : \n\"Hey where've you been? You \"smell! \"Not in a bad way necessarily, and I don't know how I \"can \"smell, or remember any smell, so... that is weird.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I was up top. Must be the sea air and the salt, distinct from Oceanus down below. I sailed across the waters, toward Olympus, on a ship! \"\n Dora : \n\"Exciting! I was right here the whole time.\"\nMiscellaneous Conversations.\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; Returning to the Tent.\nDialogue 01.\n Dora : \n\"Mel! Thought I finally had the place to myself, then next I know, you're back. Damn near scared me to life. Rough night again?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Rough night, Dora. Fear not, you'll have the tent to yourself yet! See you.\"\n Dora : \n\"Yeah, you too.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Dora : \n\"You know, it's kind of spooky how you never come in through the front flap anymore. Ever think of taking up haunting, yourself?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Oh, yes! I figure if none of this works out, the lot of us can wander the earth, striking fear into the hearts of any mortals who dare look upon us.\"\n Dora : \n\"\"&lt;Gasp&gt; \"Now we're talking...\"\nDialogue 03.\n Dora : \n\"\"Whew! \"Thought you'd never snap out of it. You OK?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Yes, thank you, Dora. I hope I didn't cause you any concern. Have you been by my side here all this time?\"\n Dora : \n\"What, me? No. Just out for a breather.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"But you don't even breathe...\"\n Dora : \n\"Cut it out...!\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Shade\"&gt;Shades&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Don't you have friends among the other Shades, Dora? You could join them for some activity out there. It's picked up a lot of late.\"\n Dora : \n\"\"Foolish witch! \"Haunting this tent is a full-time obsession. We lesser Shades can be a little single-minded. I guess kind of like mortals.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Not just mortals...\"\nDialogue 02.\n Dora : \n\"How'd you get all those other Shades out there to do the busywork around here, anyway? They practically worship the ground you walk on.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Headmistress took them in. I helped train and communicate with them. Many came from being trapped between the realms. Some never got a proper burial. Others died unfulfilled, or violently. They never made it to the Underworld.\"\n Dora : \n\"\"Oof\"... that's rough. Say, you don't think \"I \"fall into one of those categories, there, do you? I'd hate to think I didn't get a \"proper burial\".\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It's not a laughing matter, Dora.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Dora : \n\"Getting crowded out there! More Shades, guy with the horns. I don't like it, Mel! Not one bit.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"As we grow in numbers, we grow in strength. What's your concern with that?\"\n Dora : \n\"Don't like to share. Except this tent, I don't mind sharing it with you! Most of the time.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'm honored.\"\nDialogue 04.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Dora! \"Wow! \"What brings you all the way out here? The taverna's just about the last place I expected to find you.\"\n Dora : \n\"\"Um\", way to make me feel incredibly self-conscious, thanks, Mel! But, yeah I'm, I'm trying to put myself out there a bit more, I guess...!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Well I think that's great. Though, I know how difficult it is. I used to never be able to approach others, but I kept doing it, and... it's easier now.\"\n Dora : \n\"Easier, but... never \"easy\", right? \"Ehh\", don't know why I bother... most of these Shades are pretty boring.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"They haven't met \"you \"yet!\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;'s Progress.\n Dora : \n\"\"Gah! A scourge upon your bloodline for re-summoning me, witch! \"Hey, \"uh, \"everything OK, there, Mel?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Oh, yes Dora, it's just... I should have gone farther that time. I'll give more notes on your haunting later, all right?\"\n Dora : \n\"Oh. Sure...\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Trials\"&gt;Chaos Trials&lt;/a&gt;.\n Dora : \n\"Hey, what happened, you look weird or something, I don't know. Weren't out too long. Took someone to the woods...?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"No, Dora, though I don't think I can sufficiently explain. You know the Pitch-Black Stone? Turns out it can... do things.\"\n Dora : \n\"The purple rock can \"do things\", you say... Know what? I don't even want to know the rest, just gonna let my imagination take over for you, thanks.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Anytime?\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"https%3A//hades.fandom.com/wiki/The_Crossroads%23Melino%25C3%25AB%27s_Tent%3A~%3Atext%3Dportrait%2520of%2520Melino%25C3%25AB%2520as%2520a%2520baby%2520surrounded%2520by%2520her%2520family\"&gt;The Family Portrait&lt;/a&gt;.\n Dora : \n\"You've been staring at that picture more and more. \"Happy family! \"Well it's starting to get to me, because I think it's starting to get to \"you. \"Don't get all misty on me, Mel.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Thank you, Dora. Though you needn't worry. I won't get lost in memories because there isn't much for me to remember. I just wonder what my brother and my birthparents were like.\"\n Dora : \n\"\"Uh-huh! \"Sounds awful lot like dwelling on the past to me. Nothing you could have done! Hey... you could be doing nothing right \"now.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'll give it some thought.\"\n Dora : \n\"Or don't!\"\nAbout Existing.\n Dora : \n\"\"Ahh \"hey Mel, I was just... floating! Floating around, I guess. And existing! Just kind of existing a lot lately. You?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Failing. Making progress, I don't know. Speaking of, shouldn't you be practicing your haunting, Dora?\"\n Dora : \n\"Oh! Yeah, no, I thought maybe I'd take a break from that. Why do now what you could do later, right?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"For the sense of accomplishment?\"\n Dora : \n\"\"Pffsh!\"\nAbout Being a Listless &lt;a href=\"Shade\"&gt;Shade&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Dora : \n\"Not going to lie, Mel, sometimes I wish \"I \"had a big important task. Not that floating isn't one.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You know my stance on this, Dora. You need to get out of this tent. You're very talented! I've never met a Shade that speaks like you.\"\n Dora : \n\"\"Ooh\", I can talk, makes me \"so special. Tsch! \"I'm sure any lowly Shade could do it after being stuck here listening to \"you people \"long enough. I was fed up with just warbling, so I learned to sound it out, I guess.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'm glad you did.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Everything all right, Dora? Any new hauntings need evaluation or anything?\"\n Dora : \n\"\"Nah! \"I \u2014 I'm \u2014 I'm fine, it's just... think I've hit a bit of a slump is all. \"Happens\", right? I'll get over it.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Good.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Dora : \n\"Hey, if I were you I'd... well, come to think of it, I'd... I'd do a lot of things. Go for a jog! That seems nice. Having legs! Getting the heart rate going, a heart seems nice!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Stop it, Dora. I don't like it when you get like this.\"\n Dora : \n\"...Make something with my hands! I don't know, a cup? A bowl. I'd eat! Eating seems \"nice. \"Or even just remembering what that was like...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Take care, Dora...\"\nAbout Mission.\n Dora : \n\"Ever think maybe we're just not cut out for this, Mel? Me with the haunting, you with the... what're you trying to do, again?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"Find the Titan of Time. Punish him for his crimes against my family. Restore the rightful ruler of the Underworld... \"Hey, you're cut out for haunting, Dora!\"\n Dora : \n\"\"Aw\", thanks! Just like I'm sure you're cut out for all that other stuff.\"\n\"DoraAboutHaunting01\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"What would you do if you had the tent all to yourself, anyway, Dora? You could invite all the other Shades and absolutely trash the place I suppose.\"\n Dora : \n\"Wh, what, you mean \"share \"it? Mel, \"not sharing \"the tent is the entire point, a proper haunting has a one-to-one ratio between the haun\"ted \"and the haun\"tee\". Even \"I \"haven't forgotten the basics.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I can't imagine all you want to do is float around in here, minus the part where we get to speak.\"\n Dora : \n\"Then you simply lack imagination, friend!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"Heh.\"\nAbout Haunting.\n Dora : \n\"\"Everlasting pain and suffering upon you, witch! You trespass on my hallowed ground. Your cries for mercy shall drown in your throat!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Please! Forgive my careless indiscretion, madam-spirit, I beg of you! I intended no offense...\"\n Dora : \n\"\"Ho-hoh, wow! \"You're really into this stuff, huh?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Oh, come on!\"\nAbout Nightmares.\nDialogue 01.\n Dora : \n\"Whoa, what gives there, Mel? Y-you look like you've seen a... \"ungh\", I don't know, but... whatever it was it got under your skin. \"&lt;Gasp&gt; Oh! \"Skin seems nice!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'm all right, just a little shaken. First nightmare since all this started.\"\n Dora : \n\"About time, you were past due. Oh, how scary would you say it was, compared to, \"um, the terrifying visage that you see before you now?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Not even close.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Dora : \n\"Wonder if I ever used to have nightmares... so, so you can just... imagine yourself in these completely different \"horrible \"situations?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Yes. And sometimes I'm not even there, which can make them even more unsettling. Though they don't trouble me as much anymore...\"\n Dora : \n\"Well, at least you've got me.\"\nAbout Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt;.\n Dora : \n\"Hey, the head witch isn't busting your chops too bad, is she? What with you coming back here pretty often lately and all.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I know Headmistress can be very demanding. I'm sure she hopes I would have encountered more success by now, but... she's been nothing but patient.\"\n Dora : \n\"Really? Well I hope \"that \"sticks!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Dora, don't you pay any attention to what's been happening out there? The rise of the Titan of Time? The siege of Olympus?\"\n Dora : \n\"Nope. Can't say any of that rings a bell. Olympus, that's where the family members you \"don't \"like live, right? And the Titan of Time, I get that he's bad, but he's never done anything to me personally, as far as I know, so...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"This entire encampment exists to resist his efforts to overthrow the gods and rule the world?\"\n Dora : \n\"Well then! Maybe I should thank him because I happen to like this encampment.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Oh shush!\"\nDialogue 02 (Won Battle).\n Dora : \n\"\"Whoa\", hold on, what's going on with you? Never seen you so excited in my life. Death. Whatever. What, did you discover a new species of root vegetable or something?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Dora, I found him... Chronos... and I \"beat \"him! Withstood every trick he had, until he yielded and expired.\"\n Dora : \n\"Oh, \"nice! \"So then it's \"over\", right? Or what...?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Well, no, he isn't \"dead... \"I mean, he isn't \"gone\". Not yet. I have to go... all right?\"\n Dora : \n\"Yeah. All good.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;.\n Dora : \n\"Hey if you showed up just a bit sooner, you could have heard Nemesis complaining up a storm again!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Best not mock Retribution Incarnate if you know what's good for you. She and Headmistress have been at each other's throats...\"\n Dora : \n\"You know I could, like, \"possess \"her for you, right? Just kind of... swoop in there, rattle around in her head a little bit, make her do some \"bad \"stuff... \"&lt;Gasp&gt; embarrassing \"stuff! Just for a little while, I mean. If I got caught in there...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Dora, don't...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hypnos\"&gt;Hypnos&lt;/a&gt;.\n Dora : \n\"Get any sleep at least while you're zonked out back there? \"Huh\", can't even wrap my head around what it must be like for you. Sleeping? They... they say it's like being dead, right? But I'm dead, and I'm always awake.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I think the only one getting good sleep of late is Hypnos, himself. Still hasn't even stirred, no matter what Headmistress has tried.\"\n Dora : \n\"Lucky him.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Moros\"&gt;Moros&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Dora : \n\"So, what's the deal with the horned guy, anyway? Saw him and Nemesis chatting like they were an item, or something. It was weird.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"They're siblings, Dora. The horned one is Lord Moros, emissary of the Three Fates. Our distinguished guest, and a valuable ally.\"\n Dora : \n\"Yeah! Looks like we really put him up in style...\"\nDialogue 02.\n Dora : \n\"Wait, so the horned guy over there... \"he's \"the one who shows up whenever some mere mortal is about to \"die \"in some horrific, unexpected way?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Well, yes. He ensures the will of the Three Fates is done. But don't misjudge him for it, and there's no need to be afraid of him, either.\"\n Dora : \n\"Are you kidding? I think that's awesome, I... I wonder if he saw \"me \"die! Maybe I got crushed by a boulder! Struck by lightning! \"&lt;Gasp&gt; \"Murdered by my own lover...! Could you introduce us?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"Erm... \"sure?\"\nDialogue 03.\n Dora : \n\"Saw you chatting up Horns again! Yeah, he's a bit of a stiff, but I guess he's not so bad. Think maybe I \"met \"him before, back when I died...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Oh I doubt it. You'd remember having met someone like that. And he'd remember you as well! Though, you have been dead a while...\"\n Dora : \n\"Yeah. Maybe I was one of his first jobs. Just an innocent young woman, doomed to a cruel inevitable future she never deserved...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"OK, Dora.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Heracles\"&gt;Heracles&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Do you remember the name \"Heracles? \"The greatest half-god hero of the surface, slayer of the Nemean Lion, and so on?\"\n Dora : \n\"Nah, not really. But I hear the other Shades go \"on \"and \"on \"about him every now and then. Why do you ask?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I encountered him. He's as big as they say, that much is sure. He has such a storied past, I thought maybe you'd recall one of the tales.\"\n Dora : \n\"Well, you thought wrong, my friend.\"\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//hades.fandom.com/wiki/Characters/Hades_II%23The_Unseen%3A~%3Atext%3DBook%2520of%2520Shadows-%2CThe%2520Unseen%2C-Melino%25C3%25AB\"&gt;The Unseen as a Whole&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Have you ever even spoken with Commander Schelemeus, Dora? Or Odysseus? We have these great masters on our side, who know so much of history. So much they can teach us.\"\n Dora : \n\"History? That what they call it nowadays? Well, I don't have big plans to go to war with the rest of you anytime soon, though if I change my mind, I'll probably check in with those guys.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"They're good people!\"\nWith other Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Moros\"&gt;Moros&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Dora : \n\"...And so I say, \"begone accursed witch! I have occupied this grove for aeons, long before your pitiable tent came to rest upon it! \"Oh hey Mel.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I see the two of you have met! Lord Moros, Dora speaks the truth as always. She's been here longer than I have, if you can believe it!\"\n Moros : \n\"I can, indeed. For I know an old soul when I see one. It's a pleasure to meet you, Dora. Do let me know if I can be of service in some way.\"\n Dora : \n\"\"Haha. \"Count on it, Horns! Now then, \"I bid your leave. Farewell!\"\n Moros : \n\"Farewell!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Dora : \n\"...His own \"brother? Eugh, \"no way, that is twisted! Your sisters are sick!\"\n Moros : \n\"Well... they have many mortal lives to untangle, so to speak. The work can grow repetitive, lose its spark. So they liven things up from time to time.\"\n Dora : \n\"Oh totally I, I would completely do the same if I were them. I wonder what they did to \"me... \"Could you, like, look me up, or something...?\"\n Moros : \n\"\"Heh! \"I fear I'm not at liberty to do such things.\"\n Dora : \n\"\"Ah\", come on...\"\nGifts.\n&lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Wanted you to have this, Dora. To the best haunter in all the Crossroads!\"\n Dora : \n\"See, I \"knew \"you were going to pull this gift-custom thing on me sooner or later, so I have come prepared.

Thank you, Dora!\"\n2nd Time.\n Dora : \n\"Oh, you don't need to get this kind of stuff for me! I can just take whatever stuff of yours I want when you're out!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Well you can't take \"this \"while I'm out! I keep it on me at all times, for just such an occasion.\"\n3rd Time.\n Dora : \n\"\"Fool! I am not susceptible to mere baubles such as this! Ah\", just kidding. \"Totally \"susceptible. Gimme!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"At last, I have discovered a vulnerable point in your defenses!\"\n4th Time.\n Dora : \n\"Starting to get the feeling maybe I liked this stuff back when I had eyeballs and so on.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Doesn't matter whether you liked it then, what matters is you like it now.\"\n5th Time.\n Dora : \n\"\"Ungh\", on the one hand, I really don't know what I did to deserve this. But on the other hand, I really don't care! It's mine now.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It most certainly is!

What are we waiting for?\"\n Dora : \n\"Wonder if I was ever shy about this kind of stuff...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You still can sense something of the waters' warmth, can't you, Dora?\"\n Dora : \n\"Well, I can see all the steam rising, which I associate with warmth, so... I guess it kind of tricks me into thinking warm thoughts.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"That doesn't sound so bad. Though, you do remember what warmth was like, then? From your mortal days?\"\n Dora : \n\"\"Ohh\", not really, no. I, I guess I've just heard so much about it, it's like I've experienced it myself.\"\n Dora : \n\"\"Whew! \"That was basically like floating around in your tent, though I appreciate it nonetheless!\"\n2nd Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Hey I've got these bath salts here that are more than enough for me, if you're not busy at the moment...?\"\n Dora : \n\"Mel, you know I like doing nothing.

She works as a maid in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;, constantly floating around and cleaning, and after a time is promoted to the House's Head Custodian. \nCharacteristics and Personality.\nDusa is the severed head of a Gorgon who works as a suffering maid for the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt;. She appears very optimistic, cheerful, extremely hardworking and is one of the best people &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; could ever meet, but always seems doomed to do everything on her own.\nDusa is friendly, shy, playful, a great company and likes to share gossip in their free time. She has a painfully obvious crush on Zagreus (you can even hear some sighs), but she is never able to express her feelings due to her strong social anxiety and, more importantly, her never-ending cleaning tasks.\nHowever, Dusa doesn't like pity eyes, as she is seen as the \"Cinderella.\" Sometimes the residents of the House sympathize with her and offer their help, but she shows her fangs and refuses any assistance, insisting on doing everything on her own. She is a victim of her workload, especially under &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;'s supervision, and gets skittish with anyone she wants to avoid.\nDusa is not good at hiding things and can speak without filters. In a conversation with Zagreus, she confesses that she has fantasized about Zagreus and &lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt; in her mind when they are alone, which makes her run away in embarrassment.\nIn the end of her romance arc she rejects him, when Zagreus invites her to go out, she realizes that she loves him and admits that he is one of the coolest people in the House of Hades, but she simply doesn't feel attracted him in a romantic way. She asks to remain friends for eternity.\nPhysical description.\nDusa is a small Gorgon, and her body remains unknown. She has light green skin with freckles and large yellow eyes, giving her a positive expression. One of her serpentine locks always holds a duster, and she ties the emblem of the House of Hades around her forehead.\nHistory.\nBefore Hades.\nLittle is known about Dusa's past, as she doesn't talk much about it. \nHowever, the codex entry on gorgons says that when Medusa was killed, her blood soaked into the underworld and spawned a brood of vengeful offspring. In a conversation between Zagreus and Dusa where Zagreus asks about Asphodels's gorgons, Dusa says to imagine having mindless siblings made from your own blood. It can then be assumed that when the hero Perseus decapitated Medusa, her blood soaked into Asphodel and created the gorgons, the Megagorgon, and Dusa. Dusa does specifically say your blood when talking about the gorgons which might mean that Dusa is the soul of Medusa, or perhaps some of Medusa's memory given physical from. She does mention that she thought anyone could turn others into stone by just looking, like she did.\nHer cause of death was decapitation, the preferable method to kill gorgons.\nHades.\nDusa is a maid in the House of Hades. She's tasked with feeding Cerberus and cleaning the House, occasionally checking on other workers as well. She constantly overworks herself, which often worry those around her. Even if they try to help, she'll just hiss at them and deny their offer.\nAs Zagreus starts to talk more frequently to her and building a friendship, Nyx grows weary of this, and in what she sees as an act of compassion for the gorgon, fires her. Zagreus doesn't take the news well, and neither does Megaera, so after a little convincing from him, Nyx re-hires Dusa, warning her to not overwork herself so much, and promotes her to Head Custodian.\nEpilogue.\nShe keeps on working for House, now taking better care of herself.\nBefore Hades II.\nDusa was trapped in time like all of the House of Hades by &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt; after the Titan escaped his imprisonment.\nAffinity.\nIf given &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;, Dusa will give you the &lt;a href=\"Harpy%20Feather%20Duster\"&gt;Harpy Feather Duster&lt;/a&gt;. \nAfter being given 6 bottles of Nectar, further gifts will be locked until her favor is completed. \nCompleting the favor and gifting her a bottle of &lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt; will have her give you &lt;a href=\"Companion%20Fidi\"&gt;Companion Fidi&lt;/a&gt; in return.\nDusa's affinity gauge is maxed out at 10 hearts, requiring the gifting of 6 Nectar and 10 Ambrosia, differing from other romanceable characters. Further information detailed in &lt;a href=\"%23Romance\"&gt;Romance&lt;/a&gt;.\nFavor.\nDusa's favor involves the lounge renovations, which she has fallen behind on doing. Zagreus must help her bring the lounge up to Nyx's standards by using the &lt;a href=\"House%20Contractor\"&gt;House Contractor&lt;/a&gt; to complete a minimum of 12 Lounge-focused renovations, which \"must\" include at least one rug for the area as well as cleaning up &lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus's&lt;/a&gt; fur and the scratches he left in the floor. After doing this, talking to Dusa will complete the A Place of Revelry &lt;a href=\"Fated%20List%20of%20Minor%20Prophecies\"&gt;prophecy&lt;/a&gt; and unlock the ability to give &lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt; to her.\nRomance?\nDusa's romance differs from the other options in that each successive gift of Ambrosia requires an increased number of bottles; while her first only requires 1, subsequent gifts require 2, then 3, until her final gift is given as 4 bottles.\nAfter giving Dusa the tenth gift, she and Zagreus will have a conversation where Dusa explains that she has come to realise she isn't looking for an intimate relationship, and isn't attracted to him in that way. They agree to remain \"friends for all eternity\" instead, though as Zagreus points out, that in itself can be its own form of love.\nSome time after the final romance conversation, Dusa will offer to return all the Ambrosia she has been given; Zagreus may take them back or persuade her to keep them as the gift they were intended as, with no negative repercussions for either choice.\nDusa can be romanced at the same time as &lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt; with no drawbacks.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\nMerchandise=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Despite their contrasting statuses, he treats her as an equal, never condescending or looking down on her. Whenever they interact, Dusa often finds herself flustered, her demeanor betraying the depth of her feelings towards Zagreus, though she may not readily admit them.\nInitially, Nyx holds reservations about their friendship, concerned about Dusa's tendency to overwork herself and the potential implications of her closeness to Zagreus. This unease reaches a breaking point when Nyx abruptly dismisses Dusa from her duties. However, Zagreus intervenes, advocating for Dusa's reinstatement, emphasizing her value to the household, albeit with certain conditions to ensure her well-being.\nWhile Zagreus and Dusa share a deep bond and mutual respect, there's a subtle undercurrent of romantic tension between them. Zagreus may entertain the idea of pursuing a romantic relationship with Dusa, but she ultimately turns down his advances. Despite her admiration for him, Dusa realizes that her feelings for Zagreus are rooted more in their friendship and camaraderie, prioritizing their platonic connection above any romantic entanglement.\nMegaera.\n&lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt;: Dusa's colleague.&lt;br&gt;Megaera maintains friendly relations with Dusa and acknowledges that Megaera has always treated her kindly. The two often invite each other out when they have time off, and they always take the day for girls, drinking and gossiping on days off.\nDespite Dusa's reluctance to accept help from others and even telling Megaera that she's fine and not to worry about her, Megaera was the first to oppose Nyx and the main force behind getting Dusa back to work and taking a break.\nBefore accepting the proposal to date Zagreus, Megaera will talk to Dusa about it. Dusa is happy that she's the first to know the news. Despite having a crush on Zagreus, she believes it feels so right, and she supports her and Zagreus being together. She insists that Megaera shouldn't deny her feelings, sacrificing in favor of their friendship. Dusa acknowledges Megaera's care and concern for her, and this time, she is willing to make the sacrifice for the sake of their friendship.\nNyx.\n&lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;: Dusa's boss.&lt;br&gt;Nyx is very fond of Dusa but disapproves of her tendency to overwork herself and associating with Zagreus. She eventually removes Dusa from her job without warning. It is when Zagreus intervenes that Nyx is persuaded to allow Dusa to work in the House again, although not without \"certain stipulations\". Dusa is eventually promoted to head guardian of the house by her, when Nyx provided that she may have been unfair.\nThanatos.\n&lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;: Dusa's colleague.&lt;br&gt;When dating Thanatos, Dusa lets slip to having thoughts about Zagreus and Thanatos, imagining lately \"the things they do together,\" blushing in panic before going into further detail. At least Thanatos must acknowledge that Dusa works better than her brother.\nHypnos.\n&lt;a href=\"Hypnos\"&gt;Hypnos&lt;/a&gt;: Dusa's colleague.&lt;br&gt;She is efficient and he is lazy, but they seem to have a friendly disposition. As Hypnos becomes more productive, he is praised by his brother and also by Dusa for his good service, but she still puts in more effort.\nSkelly and Charon.\n&lt;a href=\"Skelly\"&gt;Skelly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;: Dusa's colleagues.&lt;br&gt;Dusa's colleagues.

It's highly likely that they all still miss her. Additionally, the devotion of Dusa and Skelly were evident as they wanted her back home.\nAchilles.\n&lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt;: Forgotten Hero.&lt;br&gt;Even though they don't talk much to each other, he noticed that she hates it when residents feel sorry for her. Once, Achilles sympathized with the suffering of the maiden Dusa and offered to help her clean, but she just bared her teeth and refused.\nOlympian Gods.\nAthena.\n&lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;: Goddess of Wisdom.&lt;br&gt;Although the nature of her relationship with Athena remains undisclosed, it is noteworthy that whenever Athena makes an appearance on screen, she noticeably displays terror and seeks to conceal herself in order to avoid being seen by the goddess.\nHermes.\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;: God of Swiftness.&lt;br&gt;Dusa and Hermes were part of a team, along with Charon and Skelly, joining forces to bring Zagreus and Persephone together."}

Echo would later fall in love with &lt;a href=\"Narcissus\"&gt;Narcissus&lt;/a&gt; but like all his other suitors she was rejected by him which caused her to die with a broken heart. Her treatment by Narcissus caught the eye of &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;, who cursed Narcissus to only fall in love with himself.\nEcho appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt; \" and offers her Plaintive Echoes to &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; in her fight against &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;.

This led Echo to become heartbroken even in death which led her to inhabit the Fields of Mourning.\nAlthough repetitive in nature, Echo possesses the ability to distort and manipulate what she hears. She presents herself with an air of propriety, capable of twisting Mel's words to her advantage as she wishes.\nPhysical description.\nBeing an Oread nymph, she's of the mountains and her skin and hair reflect as such. Her body is hourglass shaped with various carvings and moss adoring her, along with gold jewelry accents. Her hair is mostly held above her head and looks liked carved stones stacked atop each other, with two 'rock buns' lower down. Echo's ears are pointed and her eyes are a light shade of purple.\nHades II.\nEcho is encountered by Melino\u00eb while traversing the Fields of Mourning and gives her Plaintive Echoes to Melino\u00eb whenever she visits her. During one of the conversations with Echo, Melino\u00eb mentions Narcissus which makes Echo repeat his name in a rather sad tone which caught Melino\u00eb's attention and makes her realize that Echo is in the Fields because of him.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

About Narcissus... \"about Narcissus...!\"\n Melino\u00eb: \n\"I don't know what he was like back when you met, but he has a certain vanity about him that... perhaps dulls his other senses a bit.

{"id": "928", "revid": "33138", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=928", "title": "Elysium", "text": "Elysium (also known as the Elysian Fields) is the section of the underworld reserved for those who were great heroes or particularly beloved by the gods in life. It is seen as an eternal paradise, where warriors, heroes and kings relive their living days by engaging in recreational combat. Elysium is filled with ageless crystal structures and statues depicting various heroes, all overgrown with moss. The river of forgetfulness, , flows through the area, numbing the memories and old pains of the shades who reside there.\nElysium is the third biome &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; encounters in his escape attempts and is always 11 chambers long (Elysium will always end with a Stairway chamber in the 37th room of any run.)\nTraps.\nThe traps of Elysium act differently than the traps from previous levels and can be used more offensively than the ones in &lt;a href=\"Asphodel\"&gt;Asphodel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tartarus\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt;. Elysium features a variety of traps.\nOne of these traps are the regrowing phoenix eggs. Like the explosive barrels in both Tartarus and Asphodel, these eggs can be primed by Zagreus (or by the projectiles from other traps) to explode, dealing high damage to anything caught within the radius. Unlike the barrels, these eggs will eventually regrow in the same spot, thus they can be reused to deal damage to enemies (and serve as a constant threat)\nElysium also features automatic firing crossbow traps. These traps will regularly fire slow-moving, high-damage bolt projectiles across the room. These bolts can trigger the destruction of phoenix eggs, with many rooms having an egg across the room from each crossbow. Like most projectiles, these bolts can be deflected. However, they cannot be destroyed.\nFinally, Elysium features statues which line some of the walls of its chambers. Anything that stands directly in front of a statue will be attacked by its spear after a brief delay, dealing moderate damage. Rows of these traps often form a shield wall along the outer edges of the chambers, and occasionally appear around the centerpieces of rooms as well.\nAnother thing to note, while not a trap for Zagreus, is that pillars in Elysium\u2014shaped as phoenix statues\u2014will also regrow after a delay once (completely) destroyed, similarly to phoenix eggs. These can be used to repeatedly bring down rubble on enemies, dealing high damage when used effectively.\nUnique Chamber.\nElysium features a unique chamber with the shade &lt;a href=\"Patroclus\"&gt;Patroclus&lt;/a&gt;, who can be found reflecting moodily on a bench overlooking the River Lethe. When encountered, Patroclus will offer Zagreus a brief conversation, and then grant him an amplified item from the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Charon\"&gt;Well of Charon&lt;/a&gt;. Patroclus will always offer a choice between these 3 items:\nPatroclus can only be encountered one time per run and is not guaranteed to be encountered. Zagreus cannot use Fated Authority on his chamber to swap it to a different reward. Patroclus's chamber will not count towards Encounters for &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt; boon debuffs, but it will count for specific items from the Well of Charon (like the HydraLite or HydraLite Gold).\nMini-Boss Encounters.\nElysium features two separate mini boss encounters. Zagreus can encounter only one of them in a run. It is possible to encounter neither of them, depending on the paths the player takes.\nThe rewards for both mini-boss encounters are a god boon of increased rarity. When Fated Authority is used on them, the god boon reward will change, but the room itself will not, and the mini boss will remain. Additionally, Fated Authority will not change which mini-boss room is encountered.\nBoth rooms are marked with an elite skull beneath the offered god boon. There is no way to distinguish between the two encounters without entering one.\nThe first mini-boss encounter in Elysium is a fight with a Dire Soul Catcher. The room will spawn an Elite Soul Catcher in the center, surrounded by pools of the River Lethe. Elite Exalted will begin to spawn in the room but will spawn in unarmed. Their weapons will appear around the room, and they will attempt to rearm themselves during the fight with the Elite Soul Catcher. While the Exalted spawned in eventually have a cap, they can very easily overwhelm a player if not dealt with while taking care of the Soul Catcher. Once the Soul Catcher dies, Exalted will stop spawning. The encounter will end when every enemy has been slain, including any Exalted.\nThe second mini-boss encounter in Elysium is a fight with &lt;a href=\"Asterius\"&gt;Asterius&lt;/a&gt;, the Bull of Minos (more commonly known as the Minotaur). Asterius' chamber is always a small arena with 2 wall pillars in it. Unlike other mini-boss encounters in Hades, Asterius will have a health bar, and will become briefly invulnerable at 50% health, after which he will gain new attacks. The fight with Asterius will end at 20% health, where he will become invulnerable again and call off the fight, complimenting Zagreus before leaving the chamber through the exit door. After he leaves, the god boon will be awarded.\nMore details on Asterius' attacks can be found on his respective page.\nBoss Encounters.\nElysium features one final boss: &lt;a href=\"Theseus\"&gt;Theseus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Asterius\"&gt;Asterius&lt;/a&gt;. This boss will appear at chamber 36. This boss is unique in that the player is fighting two separate boss entities at one time.\nThe reward for this encounter is an &lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt; Bounty if it is the player's first victory against the Heroes, or if they meet the Target Heat from the &lt;a href=\"Pact%20of%20Punishment\"&gt;Pact of Punishment&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, it is a &lt;a href=\"Darkness\"&gt;Darkness&lt;/a&gt; drop. By default, this drop is 150 , and is affected by boons and bonus effects.\nOnce the Heroes are defeated, the back entrance of the stadium will open, which leads to a Stairway encounter. This stairway will always lead to &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Styx\"&gt;The Temple of the Styx&lt;/a&gt;, the final biome of the game.\nEnemies.\nThese are all the enemies that can be encountered in any other Elysium chamber. Most of these enemies can also appear as Elites, giving them armor and upgraded attacks.\nThe Exalted.\nOne enemy type that is worthy to note are the Exalted. These come in various classes with different weapons. However, all Exalted are merely separated from their weapons when killed. Disarmed Exalted Souls will attempt to re-arm themselves by traveling to a nearby weapon and performing a short channel on it. If successful, it respawns as an Exalted of that weapon's type, with full health. Exalted of any type can re-arm with any weapon, and thus swap their weapons mid combat.\nIt is important to note that Disarmed Exalted Souls have very low life amounts and have no attacks. Their channel on a weapon is also interrupted by a weapon's stagger effect, knockback, and stuns. (Assuming they are unarmored.)\nElite Exalted will be disarmed as Elite Disarmed Souls, giving the soul armor. If it rearms with armor, it rearms as an Elite Exalted of the weapon's type. If it only re-arms with health and no armor, it will rearm as a normal Exalted."}

While it can be thought of as being the story's final chapter, minor events continue to occur for a period of time afterwards.\nGeneral tips for reaching the epilogue:\n=Epilogue Requirements=\nInitiating the epilogue is a two-part process. The first involves developing relationships with major characters and the second is a task that triggers the event itself.\nPart I.\nSPOILERS: This section names related prophecies.\nThe first part entails meeting specific dialogue requirements and developing relationships with the Olympian gods. After meeting the requirements Persephone will tell Zagreus about a plan she has involving the Olympians and next steps. When Zagreus has finished speaking to Persephone, &lt;a href=\"Fated%20List%20of%20Minor%20Prophecies\"&gt;The Queen's Plan&lt;/a&gt; prophecy will be fulfilled and the Family Reunion prophecy will be foretold.\nThere are two types of requirements - dialogue and affinity\nDialogue Requirements.\nSPOILERS: This section contains post-credits spoilers and dialogue about Persephone's backstory.\nEach piece of dialogue that follows has its own dialogue and affinity requirements, and those have their own requirements. Because of this, it is not practical to provide a comprehensive list of requirements. \nFull quotes of dialogue from Zeus and Demeter will be printed but only the beginnings of conversations between Zagreus and Hades or Persephone are quoted to aid recognition.\nNote that due to the random nature of dialogue displayed in each run, you may experience delays in receiving a specific piece of dialogue even if you have met the requirements.\nThe first three conversations take place shortly after Persephone returns to the House of Hades.\nAffinity Requirements.\nSPOILERS: This section describes how many Olympians you need to raise affinity with and to what level.\nSix of the following are required:\nPart II.\nSPOILERS: This section describes the setting of the epilogue (but not what happens in the event itself) and the tasks required to initiate it. The epilogue's setting is described in Persephone's dialogue after completing Part I, so do not read ahead before reaching that point if you wish to remain spoiler-free.\nPart II begins when Persephone asks Zagreus to invite the Olympians to a gathering in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt;. This task will appear in the Fated List as the &lt;a href=\"Fated%20List%20of%20Minor%20Prophecies\"&gt;Family Reunion&lt;/a&gt; prophecy.\nThe next step entails speaking to each Olympian god to deliver an invitation to the gathering, followed by speaking to Persephone.\nInviting &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt; may also be required depending on affinity level and whether you have spoken to Nyx about inviting them.\nThe epilogue will begin after meeting the requirements.\nWhen the event is complete, the Family Reunion prophecy is fulfilled."}

Eris will \"\" Melino\u00eb with an increase damage taken debuff that increases with each area cleared. She is also the final boss encounter in the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Thessaly\"&gt;Rift of Thessaly&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nAs strife incarnate, Eris's purpose is to cause chaos wherever she goes and is seemingly attached to Melino\u00eb, having a history of following her around wherever she goes according to Icarus. She offers her a 'helpful' gift that brings about an annoying curse, besides being an occasional annoyance. Despite being an immortal, Eris's behavior is reminiscent of that of a spoiled teenager; she is only interested in short-term gratification and having fun at the expense of others. Her fondness for candy and her tendency to leave the wrappers for Melino\u00eb to pick up is a good representation of her overall disposition. \nEris displays a sheer kinetic chaos and love of bringing mischief and insanity, particularly in her boss fight on the Surface where she shows Melino\u00eb exactly what the &lt;a href=\"Adamant%20Rail\"&gt;Adamant Rail&lt;/a&gt; can do in her hands as she fires waves of bullets and carpet-bombs entire parts of the beach front, all the while giggling like a wicked schoolgirl. \nShe is mischievous and, at times, casually destructive, not being interested in anything in particular related to the war against Chronos or her family's fate and simply relishes in the strife of the situation. She is a nuisance to Melino\u00eb, not out of any real allegiance to Chronos, but simply because she likes to torment people, and she sees Melino\u00eb as an easy target. Her lack of direction and petulant behavior makes her rather unpopular among her siblings; both &lt;a href=\"Moros\"&gt;Moros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt; mention clashing with her on various occasions. This unpopularity appears to extend to everyone else in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; as well who see her as troublesome and untrustworthy. \nEris also has a tragic side; without choice, her purpose is to only cause strife for others, being imbued with it, even though she has made little effort to change. She harbors an inferiority complex towards all her siblings who seem to be better, more responsible, and more dedicated than her in their roles, making her the black sheep of her family.\nThough she often claims to be content with her lot in life, she in truth harbors a deep resentment and bitterness towards her mother and the rest of her siblings as she feels that she was never given a choice to be anything other than the goddess of strife unlike them who presumably did get to choose. In a conversation with Melinoe, Eris confesses that she actually envies them for their domains lamenting that she could've been the goddess of &lt;a href=\"Geras\"&gt;old age&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Philotes\"&gt;friendship&lt;/a&gt; if her siblings hadn't come along and taken them before she had a chance to. \nAfter arriving at the Crossroads, Eris will continue to be mischievous, but she may attempt to be friendlier with Melino\u00eb, though this might be her rebellious spirit coming into play. Despite their tension, Melino\u00eb is uncharacteristically drawn to her, described in the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Book of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; like a moth to a flame.\nPhysical description.\nEris has fair skin and a youthful appearance, with a grey buzzcut and purple irises. Eris is considerably smaller than her sister Nemesis; she is about the same size as Melino\u00eb. She has large, feathery black wings which enable her to fly. She wears extremely thick, black eye makeup, black lipstick, and a moon-shaped stone on her forehead.\nShe wears a black gorget adorned with multicolored tassels, which match her earrings. Her lime green, cobalt, and red color motif (most visible on her shawl) correlates with the three attack colors of the &lt;a href=\"Furies\"&gt;Furies&lt;/a&gt;. Her dress consists of a blue skirt, a black bodice, and a white, quilted bustline with three triangles in each color. She carries her ammunition on a belt with a gold buckle shaped like an apple, which is a reference to the . Her nails are painted to match the rest of her outfit, and she wears a bracer on one arm and bracelets on the other. There are what appear to be candy bars tucked into her belt, which she consumes when she visits the crossroads.\nHistory.\nPast.\nEris was born as the last of the children of Nyx and was designated as Strife, never having the choice to decide what she wanted to be. Surrounded by her various siblings, she always felt that they ignored her and thought themselves better without trying to understand her, allowing her rebellious nature to flow, and always disobeying her mother's strict control and rules.\nAt some point after the Titan War, Eris stole the &lt;a href=\"Adamant%20Rail\"&gt;Adamant Rail&lt;/a&gt; from the goddess &lt;a href=\"Hestia\"&gt;Hestia&lt;/a&gt; and planned to use it to sow chaos. It's unknown exactly what happened during this period but eventually the weapon would end up leaving her possession.\nAt an unknown period prior to the events of Hades, Eris conceived many children of her own, with her brother Thanatos remarking that it's partly thanks to the \"dedicated efforts\" of Eris and her offspring that he is so busy all the time.\nHades.\nThe Adamant Rail ended up in the possession of &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;, who could unlock her Aspect.\nBefore Hades II.\nAt some point, the Adamant Rail ended up back in her possession.\nHades II.\nEris appears as Melino\u00eb traverses the borders of the Underworld, giving her a curse to make her attempt more difficult if the game detects that the player is progressing too fast. She later appears at &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;, where she uses the pact between Hecate and Nyx to hang out safely even as she pollutes the area and taunts the residents. Her main appearance is at the beach of the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Thessaly\"&gt;Rift of Thessaly&lt;/a&gt;, where she fights Melino\u00eb to prevent her from proceeding to the Olympians' aid. Her motive appears to be keeping the war between Chronos and the Olympians going for as long as possible due to sheer amount of Strife it causes.\n\"Blessing\" Of Strife.\nIf Melino\u00eb progresses too fast in the early-game, Eris will appear and \"bless\" her. This \"blessing\" cannot be refused and there is no way to get rid of it, as it lasts for the whole current run. This can be avoided by having roughly half health, calculated after each zone's post-boss fountain, as Eris will only appear if the player is above a certain current health threshold. "}

During the first phase, her attacks are as follows:\nFirst Phase.\nAfter receiving enough damage, the second phase begins.\nSecond Phase.\nIn this phase, she reuses her attacks from the first phase but also includes new attacks, as follows:\nThird and Fourth Phase.\nThese phases are mainly signified by Eris buffing her own damage again by 100%. Be extremely careful: her damage output in this state is EXTENSIVE; defensive buffs like Soot Sprint from &lt;a href=\"Hestia\"&gt;Hestia&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Keepsakes/Hades%20II\"&gt;Engraved Pin&lt;/a&gt; keepsake are highly recommended to be able to survive her final two stages.\nAs Eris' health gets lower, she starts using a variation of her Burst Fire attack where she fires all bullets much more rapidly. Her final buffing phase fires a bomb with a greatly increased blast radius, forcing Melino\u00eb to the edges of the arena. Eris is highly mobile after receiving this final buff, and will prioritize flying to random parts of the arena before using Burst Fire for a short period."}

So, what brings you back? For a while there, I thought maybe you really were gone for good this time.\"\n Eris : \n\"Hate to disappoint, but I just couldn't stay away! Especially not with everything we're in the middle of right now. \"You \"have been \"real \"busy lately, \"huh?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Whatever it is you heard, please keep it confidential.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Eris : \n\"Miss me, Trouble? Thought I'd flit on over for a bit again, and see how everybody's doing, since I'm \"welcome here and safe \"still, aren't I? Though it \"has \"been a little while.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It's not been long enough. Much as I wished you'd grown past your childishness, Eris, I can't imagine you've returned for any reason other than to keep it up.\"\n Eris : \n\"What, you can't imagine I just want to visit my big sister, if not you? I get it, you're still mad I slowed you down before, but... I will not do that again, I swear. So truce?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"We'll see.\"\n Eris : \n\"Truce!\"\nBasic Narrative Dialogue.\nGranting Curse.\nDialogue 01.\n Eris : \n\"\"You're \"a long way from the Crossroads, Trouble! So, this is where the real action is, \"huh? \"Weren't you supposed to still be practicing?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Things took a turn, Eris...! You know how it goes. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some urgent business to attend to.\"\n Eris : \n\"Always in such a rush! I'd really hate to slow you down, though let's hang out sometime, OK? Have a great night.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Here to set another curse on me, Eris? For all your \"idiosyncrasies\", I never took you for a traitor.\"\n Eris : \n\"I'm not, \"I swear! \"It's just... \"ugh\", you'll never understand. I wanted this to be a \"special moment\", but you had to go and \"ruin \"it!\"\nDialogue 03.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You again. What, are you concerned my task just isn't difficult enough? Going a bit too swimmingly?\"\n Eris : \n\"Actually, yes, I was a little worried about that. You got past the \"Sirens! \"What next, you'll go kill Chronos, and then what? Come on, babe. Let's not do anything \"rash.\"\nDialogue 04.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Out of my way, Eris! I won't be wasting any further breath on you while you perpetuate this nonsense.\"\n Eris : \n\"You never understood me, Trouble. Fine! You don't have to. Just remember that I'm doing this for your own good. And actually, mine too!\"\nDialogue 05.\n Eris : \n\"What's all the commotion, anyway, \"huh? \"Chronos started bashing on Olympus again, sure. But it's not like you have to go after him now, do you?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Believe me, I'd much rather stay and chitchat with you than sully my hands in Titan blood. But you have a choice, Eris. You can help me finish this, rather than hinder me.\"\n Eris : \n\"You know, babe... when you're right, you're \"right. \"You've given me a lot to chew on. Now you chew on \"this.\"\nDialogue 06.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"What are you doing here in Tartarus? There's no way you could have access to this place, unless...\"\n Eris : \n\"Unless I could, like, \"fly? \"Come off it, babe, you're \"way \"too stuck in your own head.

Got to breathe some fresh surface air. What made you go and do a thing like that? Thought you were single-mindedly going after Chronos!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Figured that I might do well with a change of scenery for a bit. Though, I'm surprised you're not up there yourself, considering how things are.\"\n Eris : \n\"It does sound pretty exciting! But, I'd probably just be getting in the way. From what I hear, Ares has things well in hand up there. \"Imagine \"being the god of war right now. You'd be \"thrilled!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Your whole family would be in peril.\"\n Eris : \n\"...So?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Eris : \n\"I figured it out! All these visits topside. \"You're \"trying to get to \"Olympus! \"Come to the family's rescue! Put an end to the war up there, is that it?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Oh, I just go up there to gather fresh reagents, really. Moss, bits of bronze. Comes in handy! The Olympians are very good at taking care of themselves.\"\n Eris : \n\"Sure they are. And they're too proud to ask for help. Just don't go ruining it for Ares when you're up there \"picking Moss. \"He's on a real hot streak lately!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Sounds like you and the god of war are still pretty close.

I grew up surrounded by siblings all thinking they were better than me. There's hoity-toity \"Retribution\", over there! And \"Death\", and \"Doom! \"Nobody wanted anything to do with \"Strife.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Moros could relate more than you know. You children of Nyx are widely feared, but so what? You don't need a lot of friends. You just need a few good ones. And the very meaning of \"Strife \"is for \"you \"to define, isn't it?\"\n Eris : \n\"I mean, I \"guess...\"\nDialogue 02.\n Eris : \n\"Don't hate me, babe, OK? It's not my fault I keep lying to you, manipulating you, shooting you with the Rail, making you clean up after me, saying awful things behind your back...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"While I cannot shake the sense that this is a personal failing of mine, in spite of everything, I \"don't \"hate you, Eris. Not entirely. Although... whose fault \"is \"all of that, if not your own?\"\n Eris : \n\"My \"mother's! \"It's Nyx's fault, \"that's \"whose! Because she literally made me what I am, and what I'll always be. I could have been \"Old Age\", or \"Friendship! \"But, no! And I can't change my nature. No matter \"how \"hard I try.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"And, approximately how hard would you say you've tried?\"\n Eris : \n\"I mean, I haven't \"really\", yet! But I'm going to this time, I swear!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"And I encourage you.\"\nAbout Mission.\n Eris : \n\"You know how come I'm \"really \"back, don't you, Trouble? Because things \"finally \"started getting \"interesting. \"But you're trying to put a stop to it...!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I won't let you cast doubt on my task.

I have \"every \"right to be here, and you're never getting rid of me! And you're never getting rid of Chronos, either. No going \"back \"to how things \"were!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"We're going forward not back.\"\nAbout Purpose.\n Eris : \n\"I don't get you people, honestly. So set on making things the way they used to be. \"You\", especially! You don't even know what you're missing!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"We're trying to set things right, not make them how they used to be. Though, what's your point, Eris?\"\n Eris : \n\"What's my point? What's \"your \"point? All of you are \"so \"obsessed with there being a \"Point \"to everything. You do know there isn't one, don't you? Can't just let loose and have a good time?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Not under the present circumstances, no.\"\nAbout The Heart.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Eris, you... you said before that I don't even know what I'm missing. What did you mean by that?\"\n Eris : \n\"Didn't mean your family, that's for sure! Come on, look at yourself. You've never lived a day in your life! That heart beating in your chest, you think it's only there to pump your blood. Just another muscle!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"The heart \"is \"a muscle. And so what if I never lived a day? I'm more of a night person. What, should I be out feasting? When Olympus is in peril, and the Underworld in utter disarray?\"\n Eris : \n\"Maybe! But you just want everything nice, and orderly, and predictable, and \"boring.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"That's not true.\"\n Eris : \n\"You sure...?\"\nAbout The Past.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Look... you're right I've never known what it was like before Chronos returned. You keep insinuating it was worse than now. How so?\"\n Eris : \n\"Already told you, babe! Your father, my mother, whole inner circle... they got off bossing everyone around! Didn't give me space to spread my wings. Bunch of Olympus wannabes, but with \"mood lighting!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"...So you prefer living in a state of total disorder and constant mayhem to living under a principled set of rules?\"\n Eris : \n\"That's a really good way to put it!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Eris : \n\"You really want to know the way things used to be, Trouble? Think about everything that gets you to come out of your tent night after night. Gets you \"fired up! \"What comes to mind?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Sure. Those I care about are counting on me. And, I wish to learn; to grow strong in body, mind, and spirit.\"\n Eris : \n\"Inspiring. Now, imagine having everything you want... so you're left wanting nothing at all...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"No, I can't imagine that. So, everyone besides you was self-indulgent and unmotivated? But now the roles are reversed, I suppose?\"\n Eris : \n\"You don't get it. Fine.\"\nAbout The &lt;a href=\"Adamant%20Rail\"&gt;Adamant Rail&lt;/a&gt;.\n Eris : \n\"\"Whoa, haha! \"You startled me there, Trouble! Sneaking up on me like that, I almost blasted you. You gotta be more careful!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I don't appreciate you brandishing that thing about. Weapons remain prohibited outside the training grounds, in case you didn't know.\"\n Eris : \n\"\"Weapons? Ah-ha. \"Hello, this is the Adamant Rail you're talking about. This baby once took \"Titans \"down! It's a work of art. And no one's taking it from me!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You ever going to tell me how you got your hands on it to begin with?

What happened then?\"\n Eris : \n\"\"Eh\", long story...\"\nDialogue 02.\n Eris : \n\"Speaking as someone with no small experience starting wars, I gotta say... just 'cause I'm not working for Chronos, doesn't mean I don't respect what he's been able to achieve.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Eris... that was one of the worst sentences I think I've ever heard.\"\n Eris : \n\"Go look at what he's done, objectively, and tell me I'm wrong!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"No, thank you...\"\nAbout The Truth.\n Eris : \n\"Know what your problem is, Trouble? You're too green. Not done enough hard living to tease apart the truth from whatever it is you're told.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Thank you for the feedback, Eris. You've given me a lot to think about.

And to whom exactly are you referring, and can you cite an example of the words purportedly said?\"\n Eris : \n\"\"Oh\", it's just... Odysseus and Hecate.

Doesn't make it OK for Hecate to lecture me, in \"private\", where I couldn't even get full credit for the things I did.

We've discussed my task from time to time, and she's interested in helping out however she can. I think she's just very determined to see our plans succeed.\"\n Eris : \n\"\"Ah\", I hear you! Fine.

Though, you'll just clean that up too, won't you?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You're not to eavesdrop on my private conversations. Particularly if they induce in you a sense of nausea! You might do well to speak with your brother yourself, sometime.\"\n Eris : \n\"I'd much rather see how long he'll keep pretending I'm not here.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Heracles\"&gt;Heracles&lt;/a&gt;.\n Eris : \n\"That Heracles sure is \"something\", isn't he? Too bad there's not much going on between his ears. That lion pelt he likes to strut around in probably has got more smarts than \"him.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"What makes you say that?

Have you heard of even a single incident where that turned out for the best?\"\n Eris : \n\"\"No! \"But there's a first time for everything, and I'm not interested in hearing veiled threats from them through \"you. \"If they care so much about what I'm up to, why don't they contact me \"themselves?\"\n Moros : \n\"You know that isn't how it works.

There must be something else we can discuss.\"\n Eris : \n\"\"Oh\", I can think of \"lots \"of things. I want to know what's going on with you two. I see the way you look up at her as she trots by. Maybe the Three sent you here to \"set the two of you up...?\"\n Moros : \n\"You're trying to embarrass me... it isn't going to work.

I \"do \"like you just a little more, I think.\"\nGift Decline.\n Eris : \n\"You know I can't accept this, now. Not after everything that's \"happened \"between us.

Eris has a strained relationship with her brother. Her lack of direction and petulant behavior make her quite unpopular among her siblings; both Moros and Nemesis mention clashes with her on several occasions. Eris teases him by suggesting the Fates intended to set him up with Melino\u00eb.\nEris will notice when spending more time with her siblings at the crossroads. She comments on Moros being different, stranger than usual. She notices the way he looks at Melino\u00eb, which makes her feel nauseous. It's possible that Eris is jealous of her older brother, even if she doesn't admit it.\nNemesis.\n&lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;: Eris' older sister&lt;br&gt;Eris has a strained relationship with her older sister, during a conversation at the Crossroads, Eris dismisses Nemesis' attempts at ordering her. In the past, Eris would often pester her into fights, which resulted in Nemesis beating her up. Nemesis threatened to beat Eris up if she interfered with the task to defeat Chronos.\nUnlike Nemesis, who shares a healthy bond with her mother, Nyx, Nemesis often lashes out at Eris with hurtful remarks, not just to her face. This stems from Eris feeling she doesn't fit into Nemesis's mold of a star disciple, unlike Nemesis does for Nyx. Eris had to move on; after all, she doesn't need anyone like that in her life.\nEris's hurt by Nemesis is palpable; Nemesis claims she promised Nyx she would take care of Eris but ended up abandoning her. It's clear that Eris still nurses a grudge. Once close, Eris used to admire Nemesis, making her slightly envious seeing Nemesis with Melino\u00eb.\nShe tells Melino\u00eb she only wants to spend time with her \"big sister,\" which might not have been entirely sarcastic. Eris enjoys purposefully riling up her sister to witness Nemesis's wild side.\nThanatos.\n&lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;: Eris' older brother&lt;br&gt;Eris has a strained relationship with her brother who she considers to be a stuck up and has no interest in saving him from Chronos.\nHypnos.\n&lt;a href=\"Hypnos\"&gt;Hypnos&lt;/a&gt;: Eris' older brother&lt;br&gt;Eris enjoys vandalizing Hypnos during his nap, probably scribbling on his face with a pen. The relationship between Eris and Hypnos doesn't seem to be as tense as with her other siblings, as she doesn't mention him feeling superior to her like the more efficient siblings do, since both can be seen as failing in their roles. However, when she's bored, she doesn't hesitate to see Hypnos as an easy target for mischief.\nThe Crossroads.\nHecate.\n&lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt;: Eris' guardian&lt;br&gt; According to the pact between Hecate and Nyx, all of Nyx's children are welcome at the Crossroads. Eris loathes staying still and has the freedom to come and go from there as she pleases. However, she also goes out of her way to make life as irritating as possible for everyone else, using Hecate's cauldron to prepare explosives.\nMelino\u00eb.\n&lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;: Eris' favorite target&lt;br&gt; Melino\u00eb has become Eris's favorite target for mischief and pranks at the moment. Eris calls her 'Babe,' not that she's allied with Chronos or anything like that. Despite Eris's pestering, Melino\u00eb is drawn towards Eris as though she were \"a moth to a flame.\" Eris often sends mixed messages towards Melino\u00eb, claiming she is boring on one occasion, then asserting that she \"likes her face\" and is willing to fight her night after night, and said fights are \"thrilling.\"\nTheir exchanges with Melino\u00eb, although initially humiliating and immature, gradually ease as they converse. This shift may be attributed to Mel's attempts to treat her normally rather than as a bother, prompting a more positive response from her. She pledges to make an effort to change, though not excessively\u2014just a bit. Eris makes strides to try to \"loosen\" Melino\u00eb up, usually involving fighting her at the banks of the Rift of Thessaly and is pleased when Melino\u00eb is angry or shows her displeasure at her."}

The special throws the spear, which will damage enemies along its path until it stops. Activating the special again recalls the spear, which will deal damage on the way back. It can also be picked up manually by running over it, and will automatically return if leaving the room.\nCharging Spin Attack.\nThe Spin Attack of the spear needs to be charged before released to deal damage. It has three stages of charges:\nAspects.\nThe Eternal Spear has 4 Aspects: &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Guan%20Yu\"&gt;Guan Yu&lt;/a&gt;. Like all other weapons, each Aspect has 5 levels that can be unlocked by spending &lt;a href=\"Titan%20Blood\"&gt;Titan Blood&lt;/a&gt;. The higher the level of the Aspect, the more effective its improvement is. Reaching the highest level in all Aspects requires 51 &lt;a href=\"Titan%20Blood\"&gt;Titan Blood&lt;/a&gt;. An Aspect will not only change the appearance of the Eternal Spear, but will also improve its attacks. The Aspect of Guan Yu has a unique move set which changes the fighting style of the Eternal Spear.\nRevealing the Aspect of Guan Yu.\nReveal the Aspect of Guan Yu by meeting the following requirements: \nTo meet the &lt;a href=\"Titan%20Blood\"&gt;Titan Blood&lt;/a&gt; requirement while spending the minimal amount, invest 5 into 5 different weapons with 1 each in non-Zagreus aspects (eg. Nemesis Sword, Achilles Spear, Chaos Shield, Chiron Bow, and Talos Fists). It's also possible to reveal Guan Yu with 3 or 4 weapons but this involves spending more Titan Blood (minimum of 7 for 3 weapons or 6 for 4 weapons).\nWhy is Achilles taking so long to talk about Guan Yu?\nAchilles has a \"dialogue pool\" containing the conversation about Guan Yu and everything else he has a comment about but you haven't heard yet. His dialogue about Guan Yu will happen randomly from that pool, so if you have large dialogue pool it could take a while for Guan Yu to come up. If you've exhausted his dialogue options (you visit him and he has no \"!\") before meeting Guan Yu's requirements, he will very likely talk to you about it after the very next run.\nIs it possible to trigger this conversation faster?\nIf you don't mind doing suicide runs (letting yourself die in the first or second rooms and talking to Achilles afterwards), you can quickly cycle through his available dialogue options so Guan Yu comes up faster. To do this quickly, reset your mirror and in the Pact of Punishment put a point into Heightened Security and max Hard Labor.\nIf you play normally, keep in mind that you will add to his dialogue pool if you do things that he has something to say about (like beating the final boss and advancing the storyline)."}
{"id": "1029", "revid": "47838920", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1029", "title": "Eurydice", "text": "Eurydice is a deceased oak nymph and the former wife of the musician &lt;a href=\"Orpheus\"&gt;Orpheus&lt;/a&gt;. Despite having some qualities of other gods and immortals, she died from a snake bite and was ferried to Underworld. A grieving Orpheus ventured to the Underworld to plea for her return. He charmed Lord &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; with his music and was given leave to bring Eurydice with him back to the surface, on the condition that he not look back at her until he left the Underworld. Ultimately he succumbed to his own insecurities, and Eurydice was forced to remain in the land of the dead.\nEurydice now resides in her own private corner of &lt;a href=\"Asphodel\"&gt;Asphodel&lt;/a&gt;, where she spends eternity singing and cooking with the help of the river Phlegethon's heat. Her former husband still seems to be a bit of a sore subject for her. The two are apparently kept apart by an official separation order issued from Hades' desk, likely as a condition of the deal that allowed Orpheus to attempt to rescue her.\nIf interacted with, she will offer &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; a selection of Underworld delicacies designed to boost his &lt;a href=\"Boons\"&gt;Boons&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nEurydice, imprisoned in the underworld and destined for the meadows of &lt;a href=\"Asphodel\"&gt;Asphodel&lt;/a&gt;, made the best of a bad situation and settled in a small place on an island in the river Phlegethon, where &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; can occasionally find her acting calmly as if everything is \"fine,\" despite actually being in a terrible place.\nAlthough she lost everything due to her death, Eurydice is one of the most optimistic people you can find in the Underworld. She is a strong woman who knows how to adapt and find joy and productivity through her music and cooking. The way she sings 'Good Riddance' sounds happy, unlike the melancholic &lt;a href=\"Orpheus\"&gt;Orpheus&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that she can leave the past behind despite all that she has lost.\nShe wasn't particularly good or bad in life and generally happy in her residence in Asphodel. With a carefree, positive and sociable personality, she enjoys dedicating herself to her favorite songs and cooking after her death. Unlike Orpheus, she wiped away her tears and moved on. She is friendly, generous, and welcoming, even cooking for Zagreus. The flavor is exquisite.\nShe doesn't admit it, but she is quite stubborn and doesn't give up easily. Eurydice isn't truly angry or bitter towards Orpheus, She didn't ask him to rescue her and thinks he's just being too dramatic, but she pretends not to care and proudly claims to be fine with herself and how things happened, although she does so insistently. They can still be together, but neither of them gives in.\nPhysical description.\nEurydice is an oak nymph, adorned in vibrant hues and with leaves. As a nymph, she is always barefoot and unadorned. Her skin, reminiscent of tree bark, and her hair styled in an afro bun resembling a tied tree, further emphasize her connection with nature. She constantly holds a branch with oak leaves in her mouth, giving her a deduction air. She has hazel eyes and oak leaves earrings.\nShe has multiple colorful fabrics covering her, some have some patchwork on them. Their colors vary from the predominant yellow to blues and greens, and the patchwork appears as brown and purple. Her upper body is covered by a white fabric atop a red one, further covered by the yellow cloth. She has lots of tattoos covering her upper body, more noticeably her arms; the tattos are all related to nature, the one in her back is of an oak leaf. She wears a brown belt decorated with more nature motifs keeping it all together, as well as a blue and red belt. She has a thick white rope serving as a hanging belt where she carries three acorns (a pink, a blue and a brown one), a sash made of fur and her tambourine, itself decorated with blue and red rope. She wears a purple and dark teal bracelet near her right elbow and a loose red circlet on her right wrist. On her left forearm, she wears a black armlet and her left wrist has a red and green wristlet with tiny bells hold together by purple rope. Her right leg has loose white and red fabric strips.\nHistory.\nBefore Hades.\nEurydice is Orpheus's wife, but unfortunately died to a snake bite.\nFilled with grief, Orpheus tried to get her back to the realm of the living by charming Hades with his music talent. Impressed, Hades gave Orpheus a chance of getting his wife back under the condition that he could not look back as he exited the Underworld with her. Guided by &lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;, the group made their way out; however, at the last moment, Orpheus looked back due to his insecurities and thus Hermes was forced to drag Eurydice back. She's been in Asphodel ever since.\nHades.\nZagreus can come across her glade when passing through Asphodel. She's taken to cooking with the flood of the Phlegethon and will offer some delicacies to him.\nAfter some time, Zagreus will ask about Orpheus and the possibility of reunion, but she will refuse, and continues to do so for a while. Nonetheless, she still misses her husband and comes to get on board with the offer. Zagreus manages to rewrite Orpheus's contract, allowing him to go to Asphodel and visit his wife, and she thanks him.\nEpilogue.\nAlthough Orpheus is now free to visit her, he still is Hades's court musician and cannot stay with her forever. Still, she now has something to look forward, and keeps aiding Zagreus and chatting whenever he passes by.\nAffinity.\nIf given &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;, Eurydice will give you the &lt;a href=\"Evergreen%20Acorn\"&gt;Evergreen Acorn&lt;/a&gt;.\nEurydice's affinity gauge is maxed out at 8 hearts.\nFavor.\nEarning Eurydice's favor requires voiding &lt;a href=\"Orpheus\"&gt;Orpheus'&lt;/a&gt; contract, allowing him to visit her in &lt;a href=\"Asphodel\"&gt;Asphodel&lt;/a&gt; (see Orpheus' Favor for details).\nItems Offered.\n\"*does not stack on the same boon\"\n\"**if a boon is already to be epic through sources such as Exclusive Access, the boon will remain epic instead of being upgraded to heroic\""}

She reveals that many of Orpheus' songs were originally hers, but when Zagreus asks him about it, Orpheus reveals that he did his best to give her proper credit and people simply didn't want to listen.

In the crossroads, he can be found sitting on a stone at the respawn location, where &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; has the option to \"confide\" in him, typically about how she last died.\nHe is very tranquil, as he shows little reaction to being struck by projectiles. According to his codex entry, he enjoys eating any kind of insect that comes near Melino\u00eb's tent.\nHistory.\nBefore Hades II.\nFrinos is a regular toad that would one day by chance hop into Melino\u00eb's tent, &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; herself quickly growing attached to the amphibian who became one of her closest confidants, close enough with his owner for her to talk about the things that bothered her.\nHades II.\nFrinos is perched on a rock where he tends to witness Melino\u00eb return from her runs, who in turns tends to greet him in multiple ways. Melino\u00eb eventually makes him her official familiar, allowing him to join on her runs.\nAffinity.\nAfter using the Faith of the Familiar Spirits &lt;a href=\"Incantations\"&gt;Incantation&lt;/a&gt;, Melino\u00eb can offer Frinos a &lt;a href=\"Witch%27s%20Delight\"&gt;Witch's Delight&lt;/a&gt;, allowing him to be used as a familiar. When Frinos is equipped, he leaps randomly about the encounter arena and absorbs projectiles, ostensibly serving as portable cover. He cannot be stunned or take damage, though he is typically knocked back when he takes a hit. Some types of projectiles, most notably wave-shaped ones, can pass through him, however.\nHe also has the &lt;a href=\"Gathering%20Tools\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt; function of the &lt;a href=\"Tablet%20of%20Peace\"&gt;Tablet of Peace&lt;/a&gt;; he increases the chances of Lost Shades to appear during a run and can turn them directly into Psyche, skipping the minigame.\nBonds.\nAfter the initial &lt;a href=\"Witch%27s%20Delight\"&gt;Witch's Delight&lt;/a&gt; used to unlock him as a companion, further offerings can be used to strengthen bonds which make both of you stronger while together."}

They are always encountered at Chamber 14, the final Chamber of Tartarus. Initially when encountered, only &lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt; will oppose &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;. After enough runs have been attempted, eventually her sisters, &lt;a href=\"Alecto\"&gt;Alecto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tisiphone\"&gt;Tisiphone&lt;/a&gt;, will occasionally appear in her place, leading to more varied and different fights.\nOnce the Extreme Measures condition of &lt;a href=\"Pact%20of%20Punishment\"&gt;Pact of Punishment&lt;/a&gt; has been unlocked, it can be used to allow the Furies to fight together, with one of them serving as the primary boss, and one or both of the other two acting as \"support sisters\" pelting Zagreus with additional attacks.\nCombat.\nMegaera.\n&lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt; is fought in her own unique chamber. The chamber is a large rectangular shaped room lined with pillars on the edges, with Spike Traps in between the pillars. Her chamber contains more pillars than the other Fury boss fight chambers.Megaera has four abilities she will use throughout the fight. Two of them - her Lunge and Whip Whirl attacks - she will always begin the fight with access to. Volley and Flame become available after she has been reduced to 75% max HP and 50% max HP; which one becomes available first is random.\nMegaera also summons reinforcements in the form of &lt;a href=\"Wretched%20Thug\"&gt;Thugs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wretched%20Witch\"&gt;Witches&lt;/a&gt; during the fight, beginning after being reduced 75% max HP. The amount of summons spawned will increase after being reduced to 50% max HP, and then again at 25% max HP. When reduced to each of those stages, she will briefly become invulnerable, and perform a short summoning animation. She will not attack Zagreus during these transitions.\nExtreme Measures.\nWhen using Extreme Measures Level 1 from the Pact of Punishment, Megaera has a chance to appear as a support sister if Alecto or Tisiphone is the main sister of the fight. As a support sister, she will use 2 modified attacks from her abilities to assist the main fury in the fight. As a support sister, she cannot be damaged, and has no effect on the main fury's health.\nAlecto.\n&lt;a href=\"Alecto\"&gt;Alecto&lt;/a&gt; is fought in her own unique chamber. The chamber is a large square with 4 pillars in the middle of the room, and Spike Traps in the center as well as around the edges of the arena. Her chamber contains more traps than the other Fury boss fight chambers.Alecto has five abilities she will use throughout the fight. Three of them - her Lunge attack, Whip Arc attack, and Build Rage - she will always begin the fight with access to. Lightning Chase will become available first at 75% max HP, and then Whip Shot at 50% max HP.\nAlecto also summons &lt;a href=\"Wretched%20Lout\"&gt;Louts&lt;/a&gt; as reinforcements during the fight, though she summons considerably fewer than Megaera does. At most, only 1 or 2 Louts will be in the arena at a time.\nAlecto has a Rage meter that fills during the fight, either through receiving damage or from her Build Rage ability. After the Rage meter is filled, Alecto becomes invulnerable for a very brief duration. She then rapidly increases her attack/movement speed and briefly unlocks all of her abilities, regardless of her current health. Her Lunge and Whip Arc attacks release volleys of projectiles, her Lightning Chase receives an increase to the rate of summons, and her Whip Shots become larger.\nWhen Alecto is reduced to 75% max HP, she becomes briefly invulnerable and unlocks her Lightning Chase ability. When reduced to 50% max HP, she becomes briefly invulnerable and unlocks her Whip Shot ability. When reduced to 25% max HP, she becomes briefly invulnerable and enters \"Perma-Rage\" which will immediately fill her Rage Meter and prevent it from decreasing for the rest of the fight (putting her into her enraged state until she dies). She also loses access to her Build Rage ability.\nExtreme Measures.\nWhen using Extreme Measures Level 1 from the Pact of Punishment, Alecto has a chance to appear as a support sister if Megaera or Tisiphone is the main sister of the fight. As a support sister, she will use 2 modified attacks from her abilities to assist the main fury in the fight. As a support sister, she cannot be damaged, and has no effect on the main fury's health.\nTisiphone.\n&lt;a href=\"Tisiphone\"&gt;Tisiphone&lt;/a&gt; is fought in her own unique chamber. The chamber is (initially) a large square room with no pillars or traps in it, unlike her sisters' chambers.Tisiphone has four abilities she will use throughout the fight. Two of them - her Whip attacks - she will always begin the fight with access to. Lightning and Slow Beam become available after she has been reduced to 67% max HP and 33% max HP; which one becomes available first is random.\nTisiphone, unlike her sisters, does not summon reinforcements to fight with her. She also only has 3 phases, in contrast to the other Furies' 4.\nTisiphone will alter the layout of the battlefield during the fight, closing in the walls around the center of the room after a brief fade to black. She will close in the walls at 50% max HP and 25% max HP. She becomes briefly invulnerable while changing the size of her chamber. Any &lt;a href=\"Cast\"&gt;Bloodstones&lt;/a&gt; that would be placed at an inaccessible location during this change are moved to the center of the arena, where they can be picked up to be used again.\nExtreme Measures.\nWhen using Extreme Measures Level 1 from the Pact of Punishment, Tisiphone has a chance to appear as a support sister if Megaera or Alecto is the main sister of the fight. As a support sister, she will use 2 unique attacks, unlike her sisters, to assist the main fury in the fight. As a support sister, she cannot be damaged, and has no effect on the main fury's health.\nReward.\nWhen defeated, the Furies drop a &lt;a href=\"Titan%20Blood\"&gt;Titan Blood&lt;/a&gt; if Bounty conditions are met. This means that either it must be Zagreus' first victory against them with a weapon, or the Target Heat must be met for that weapon.\nOtherwise, they will drop 50 &lt;a href=\"Darkness\"&gt;Darkness&lt;/a&gt;. This Darkness reward is affected by boons and bonuses (Dark Thirst, Poseidon's Oceans Bounty, Chaos's Eclipse, etc.)\nBounties for the Furies are tracked as a whole, and not individually. (This means defeating Megaera at 0 Heat will provide a bounty, but a later defeat of Alecto with the same weapon at 0 Heat will not provide a bounty, as the 0 Heat victory has already been completed with that weapon).\nAfter picking up the reward, the door on the opposite side of the chamber will open, allowing Zagreus access to the Stairway Chamber between Tartarus and &lt;a href=\"Asphodel\"&gt;Asphodel&lt;/a&gt;. In the chamber is a Healing Fountain, a &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Charon\"&gt;Well of Charon&lt;/a&gt;, Pool of Purging, and the Keepsake Display Case (if it has been purchased at the House Contractor)."}

It also functions as a glossary of terms.\nAbilities.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; has 5 different abilities that he can use in his escapes from the Underworld. They can all be enhanced with &lt;a href=\"Boons\"&gt;Boons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Keepsakes\"&gt;Keepsakes&lt;/a&gt;, or items. The &lt;a href=\"Daedalus%20Hammer\"&gt;Daedalus Hammer&lt;/a&gt; tweaks a weapon's Attack, Dash Attack, or Special, often drastically changing the ability and substantially increasing its damage.\nAttack.\nA &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Arms\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;'s primary attack; usually a fast hit with a short cooldown. Some weapons have a separate attack used by holding the Attack button.\nSpecial.\nA weapon's special attack; usually a slower-hitting ability with utility, like ranged damage or damage within an Area of Effect (AoE).\nCast.\nA long-range spell that launches ammo at foes, dealing 50 base damage on impact. When hits an enemy, it stays inside the foe until they are killed or 15 seconds elapse (unless shortened by &lt;a href=\"Quick%20Reload\"&gt;Quick Reload&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20Hera\"&gt;Aspect of Hera&lt;/a&gt;), and then it can be collected to fire it again. If Zagreus equips &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20of%20Night\"&gt;Stygian Soul&lt;/a&gt;, won't fall out of enemies and can't be collected, but instead regenerates over time.\n&lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt; Boons can grant extra ammo.\nDash.\nA movement ability which can evade attacks or get into position. While Dashing, Zagreus is immune to all damage. Dashes can cross gaps and barriers, such as the pools of magma in &lt;a href=\"Asphodel\"&gt;Asphodel&lt;/a&gt; or the hedges in &lt;a href=\"Elysium\"&gt;Elysium&lt;/a&gt;. Attacking during or immediately after dashing performs a quick Dash Attack. It is possible to use cast, special, or attack while dashing with most weapons, but doing so disables Zagreus' immunity for the rest of the dash.\nCall (Wrath).\nA powerful ability only usable if Zagreus has an \u201cAid\u201d &lt;a href=\"Boons\"&gt;Boon&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Sigil of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;. With either, a \"God Gauge\" will build when Zagreus deals and takes damage. One charge of the gauge can be used for a powerful effect, or charges can be saved up for a \"Greater Call\", which costs the full bar but is more powerful. (When usable, the God Gauge displays below Zagreus' health bar.)\nDamage.\nDamage can be inflicted by Zagreus, enemies, and a variety of environmental and bonus effects.\nDamage increase percentages in \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;\" are \"additive\", which means any % increase is based on an ability's initial damage (a.k.a \"base damage\") and are added separately \u2014 they do not scale off each other.\nExample: if an attack does 10 damage, a 50% increase would make the attack deal 10 + (10 \u00d7 0.5) = 10 + 5 = 15 damage. If that same attack gains another 30% increase, it would produce 10 + (10 \u00d7 0.5) + (10 \u00d7 0.3) = 10 + 5 + 3 = 18 damage.\n(Early versions of \"Hades\" multiplied bonuses together, which got out of hand with multiple buffs \u2014 an 80% attack Boon, 60% Chaos boon, 50% backstab bonus damage, and the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20Earring\"&gt;Skull Earring&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s 40% would combine to increase damage by 6.05\u00d7.) \nBackstab.\nBonus damage applies to foes attacked from behind, known as a Backstab. Backstab damage can be enhanced through &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20of%20Night\"&gt;Mirror of Night&lt;/a&gt; upgrades, Chaos boons, Daedalus enchantments, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Shawl\"&gt;Black Shawl&lt;/a&gt; keepsake, or the &lt;a href=\"Status%20Curse\"&gt;Exposed&lt;/a&gt; Status Curse. Some abilities cannot backstab: Cast (by default) and most Area of Effect abilities, including &lt;a href=\"Exagryph\"&gt;Exagryph&lt;/a&gt;'s basic special.\nBoiling Blood.\nBonus damage can be applied to enemies with in them, through the Mirror of Night\u2019s Boiling Blood upgrade.\nPunished.\nBonus damage can be applied to enemies suffering from at least 2 Status Curses, through the Mirror of Night\u2019s Privileged Status upgrade.\nCritical Hits.\nCritical (Crit for short) is a modifier that makes foes take more damage than usual (multiplicative increase). A critical attack will deal at least 300% damage to an enemy, but can be further increased by other effects.\nWall Slam.\nIf an enemy is knocked into a wall by an attack, they take Wall Slam damage, calculated from momentum, the distance to the wall, and the current biome (later biomes deal more damage). &lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt; has multiple Boons that enhance Wall Slams. Wall slamming an enemy with unblockable will still deal wall slam damage. \nBody Slam.\nBody Slams are similar to wall slams, but when you hit an enemy against another enemy. This deals less damage than wall slams.\nCornered.\nCornered is similar to wall slams, but when you hit an enemy against two walls, dealing extra damage.\nTraps.\nTraps are various hazards found in the Underworld, such as the Spike Pits in &lt;a href=\"Tartarus\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt;, to Phoenix Eggs in &lt;a href=\"Elysium\"&gt;Elysium&lt;/a&gt;. Traps can damage Zagreus and enemies, but hurt enemies considerably more than Zagreus.\nOther Effects.\nThese are other gameplay mechanics in \"Hades\" without a general category.\nArmor.\nArmor is found on Elite enemies. Armored enemies are outlined in yellow, gain an extra yellow health bar, and are immune to stuns and Knockback until that extra health bar is depleted. (Poseidon\u2019s Boons are the only source of knockback that works on armored enemies.) \nDestroying armor by depleting its health bar usually briefly stuns the affected enemy. If Zagreus deals more damage than the entire armor health bar in a single hit, the remaining damage is ignored \u2014 it doesn\u2019t \u201coverflow\u201d.\nSome Daedalus Hammer upgrades and Boons increase damage to armor.\nEnemies with a partially depleted armor bar are not considered \"undamaged\" for the sake of effects such as the \"Fiery Presence\" &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20of%20Night\"&gt;Mirror of Night&lt;/a&gt; upgrade.\nDefend.\nDefending is exclusive to the &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Shield of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;. Hold Attack with the shield to block damage (and charge a Bull Rush attack) in the direction you face.\nElite Foe.\nElite Foes are a variant of enemies marked with a skull symbol next to their health bar. These enemies are stronger than their normal counterparts, possessing Armor and additional abilities.\nSome elite foes, such as the &lt;a href=\"Megagorgon\"&gt;Megagorgon&lt;/a&gt;, only appear in miniboss chambers or the Extreme Measures &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; boss.\nPierce.\nPiercing projectiles continue their trajectory through targets, but not walls. The &lt;a href=\"Heart-Seeking%20Bow\"&gt;Heart-Seeking Bow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stygian%20Blade\"&gt;Stygian Blade&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Adamant%20Rail\"&gt;Adamant Rail&lt;/a&gt; can get pierce effects from Daedalus Hammers, and the Heart-Seeking Bow pierces by default for its primary attack. The &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Spear\"&gt;Eternal Spear&lt;/a&gt;'s special and recall both pierce targets by default.\nReload.\nReloading is exclusive to the Adamant Rail. Reloading refills the ammunition to capacity. Reload can be activated any time the ammunition is below capacity (at least 1 bullet is missing). When the weapon runs out of bullets, it must be reloaded before it can be fired again. (The Rail's current Ammo is displayed to the right of your health bar.)\nZagreus automatically reloads when out of ammo once the player releases the attack button, and can manually reload at any time by pressing the Reload button. The Rail cannot be fired while reloading, but you can still move, dash, and use the Rail\u2019s Special. \nShared Suffering.\nShared Suffering is a status effect of the Special of the Heart-Seeking Bow\u2019s Aspect of Rama. Foes marked by Shared Suffering take a percentage of the damage dealt by Attacks to other foes. It works on the enemy it's marked on, so the Shared Suffering damage stacks with the regular damage. Only direct Attack shots toggle it; Specials, Casts and other supplemental damage sources do not trigger it.\nStatus Curses.\nStatus Curses are debuffs applied by Boons. See &lt;a href=\"Status%20Curse\"&gt;the full list of Status Curses&lt;/a&gt;.\nSturdy.\nWhen Sturdy, you take less damage and your actions aren\u2019t interrupted from suffered damage.\nUnblockable.\nSome foes (like the &lt;a href=\"Greatshield\"&gt;Greatshield&lt;/a&gt;) block attacks from the direction they face, nullifying the damage. Unblockable attacks bypass such shields. The &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Shield of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heart-Seeking%20Bow\"&gt;Heart-Seeking Bow&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Adamant%20Rail\"&gt;Adamant Rail&lt;/a&gt; have upgrades with this effect."}

Melino\u00eb's cast is a magick circle that she can conjure on the ground at her current position that ensnares any enemy caught within it.\nDash &amp; Sprint.\nDash is movement ability which can evade attacks or get into position. While Dashing, Melino\u00eb is immune to all damage. Dashes can cross gaps and barriers. Attacking during or immediately after dashing performs a quick Dash Attack. It is possible to use cast, special, or attack while dashing with most weapons, but doing so disables Melino\u00eb' immunity for the rest of the dash.\nSprint is another movement ability that can be activated while holding the dash key/button. When activated, Melino\u00eb will move at faster rate but will be unable to attack until she ends her sprint.\nMagick.\nMagick is a resource that Melino\u00eb uses to primarily cast \u03a9 Moves however, some Boons and Daedalus Hammer upgrades may have a Magick cost.\n\u03a9 Moves.\n\u03a9 Moves are empowered abilities that Melino\u00eb can cast by holding their respective activation key/button. Only Attacks, Specials and Cast are able to become \u03a9 and each have a cost of .\n\u03a9 Attacks and Specials are dependent of their weapon that Melino\u00eb is currently using but the \u03a9 Cast is the same. \u03a9 Cast causes damage to enemies within the cast once the cast effect ends.\nDamage.\nDamage can be inflicted by Melino\u00eb, enemies, and a variety of environmental and bonus effects.\nDamage increase percentages in \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;\" are \"additive\", which means any % increase is based on an ability's initial damage (a.k.a \"base damage\") and are added separately \u2014 they do not scale off each other.\nExample: if an attack does 10 damage, a 50% increase would make the attack deal 10 + (10 \u00d7 0.5) = 10 + 5 = 15 damage.

It is initially darker, but at some point, while walking, Zagreus will reach an overlook where he can stand, and the camera will zoom out to reveal the sun rising over the horizon.\nThe first time Zagreus reaches Greece, he will be unable to Dash or sprint in the snowy map, with movement speed being cut down to walking pace. On subsequent visits, he will be able to Dash and sprint as per normal.\nAfter traversing the first map, the second map sees the snow melt away and open into a lush and colorful garden area, with Persephone standing in front of a cottage. Talking to Persephone will advance the story. Unfortunately, as Zagreus is of the Underworld, he is unable to stay long in Greece, dying of natural causes (according to &lt;a href=\"Hypnos\"&gt;Hypnos&lt;/a&gt;, anyway), and taken by the River Styx back to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt;.\nOccasionally, a &lt;a href=\"Fishing\"&gt;Fishing&lt;/a&gt; point will spawn in the pools on the snowy map or the rivers around Persephone's cottage.\nAfter the main story is completed and Persephone decides to return to the House of Hades, Greece becomes inaccessible; the fishing points are moved to the Hades battle arena. Instead, after Zagreus defeats his father, a small cutscene where the narrator explains one of the myriad ways Zagreus now dies plays, and Zagreus thus returns to the House of Hades."}

He is in charge of maintaining order within the Underworld, determining the placements and punishments of the dead, and hearing the petitions of shades that come before him.\nHades is stern, serious, and dedicated to his work. In the Remembrances that play before some escape attempts, he is shown to have been strict and often cruel to Zagreus during his childhood. He employed &lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt; to teach Zagreus fighting and give him more of a \"firm direction in life.\" Meanwhile, Hades seems to have left much of the caretaking and raising of Zagreus to &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe is resentful of Zagreus' repeated attempts to escape the Underworld and greets his returns with scorn and mockery. Additionally, he will sometimes order shades to congregate near Zagreus to punish him with time trials or to defend his &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Trove\"&gt;Infernal Trove&lt;/a&gt;s, in addition to overseeing the &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Gate\"&gt;Infernal Gate&lt;/a&gt;s to Erebus. He berates Zagreus upon the prince managing to progress from &lt;a href=\"Tartarus\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Asphodel\"&gt;Asphodel&lt;/a&gt;, from Asphodel to &lt;a href=\"Elysium\"&gt;Elysium&lt;/a&gt;, and finally from Elysium to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Styx\"&gt;Temple of Styx&lt;/a&gt;. After Zagreus successfully bribes &lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Satyr%20Sack\"&gt;Satyr Sack&lt;/a&gt; to let him by without violence, Hades realizes that he needs to become personally involved and heads off to face Zagreus at the snowy grounds on the living side of the Temple's archway, having equipped his Helm of Darkness and his fearsome spear Gigaros, to vanquish his son and banish him back to the House. He is the final boss of the main game.\nThe twin-pronged &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Sigil of the Dead&lt;/a&gt; forms Hades's personal seal, appearing on his person and war gear and being widely used as a mark of chthonic power throughout the Underworld. In the labyrinthine bureaucracy of the House, he is officially afforded the title of &lt;a href=\"Resource%20Director\"&gt;Unseen One&lt;/a&gt;, a ceremonial rank of immense status only achievable by Zagreus through an incredible amount of work and dedication.\nAfter the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;\", he and &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;his wife&lt;/a&gt; manage to conceive a second child, &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;. Soon after, his father &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt; broke free and took control of the Underworld. By the time of \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;\", Hades is now his father's prisoner.\nHe can be encountered in &lt;a href=\"Tartarus\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bouldy\"&gt;Bouldy&lt;/a&gt; keeping him company. He will give boons to Melino\u00eb to give her an edge against Chronos himself.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nA perplexing individual, Hades is the benevolent yet tyrannical god responsible for ruling the &lt;a href=\"The%20Underworld\"&gt;Underworld&lt;/a&gt;, a gloomy place and the home of the souls of the deceased. He has the task of commanding and maintaining order within it, determining the placements and punishments of the dead and listens to petitions from the &lt;a href=\"Shades\"&gt;Shades&lt;/a&gt; that come before him choosing to either accept or reject them. He's also egotistical and merciless towards anyone who is brave enough \u2014 or stupid enough \u2014 to try and circumvent his authority. He will block any chance of escape from his son Zagreus and ensure that the inhabitants of the Underworld are after him so that he does not escape. \nHades appears disciplined, dominant and rigid with work, applying the many rules of his domain with severe bureaucratic rigor. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, most if not all of his subjects respect him and see him as a stern but fair ruler. His son, Zagreus, on the other hand has always seen his father as a \"villain\" in his life and has always considered him a distant, impatient, and hard-working man with no time for his son, belittling and acting harshly towards him, constantly reprimanding and repressing him, and always wishing for more attention from his father, but without success. \nDespite maintaining composure, one can observe in Hades an extremely short fuse, especially with his brother, &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;. Upon hearing from his son that \"Zeus forgives him,\" in a tone of sarcasm and contradiction, Hades goes mad with fury at the insolence.\nHades is an enigmatic figure, even to the inhabitants of his own kingdom, and even to his own son. It is difficult to read him and say whether he does something for the good of someone or for inscrutable reasons. Despite his rough exterior, unlike his younger brother Zeus, who appears gregarious and benevolent, only on the outside, beneath all his tough exterior, Hades is well-intentioned, fair, takes his role seriously, and it was thanks to these qualities that &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt; saw in him that led to their marriage and eventually having \"children\" together.\nHades was also depressed from having his heart broken by Persephone after she left the Underworld due to Zagreus' tragic stillborn birth. Even after &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt; was able to convince her daughters, the &lt;a href=\"Fates\"&gt;Fates&lt;/a&gt;, to bring Zagreus back to life, Hades was unable to fully shake off this depression, shutting everyone, including his son, out emotionally and refusing to so much as acknowledge Persephone, even going so far as to forbid anyone in the Underworld from uttering her name and threatening to harshly punish anyone who breaks this rule. It wasn't until Persephone returned to the Underworld and they were able to rekindle their romance that Hades finally snapped out of his depression and began to have a more positive outlook. \nHades appears incredibly serious and practical. However, a healthy attitude can be observed; whenever Hades sees something he finds funny, he cannot contain himself and momentarily begins to laugh. Despite being inflexible, he appears to fear his wife Persephone, who seems to know all his weaknesses and complies with any request made by her.\nDespite being the main antagonist of Hades, in the end, he chooses not to reveal to Zagreus about Persephone, to protect Zagreus from his own truth and largely to avoid a civil war by &lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;, and free Persephone from all the circumstances that bind her son. Hades apologizes to his son and admits that he was a poor father. Now, with Persephone, she is able to bring out the sweeter and gentler side of Hades, leading him to be more paternal and open about his affection for him. He is still not particularly warm towards him afterward. Nevertheless, their relationship improves considerably as he is more willing to acknowledge Zagreus's positive traits and not constantly belittle him as before, sounding more like a father and son.\nOne might have a hard time believing so, but Hades is open to criticism and others' opinions and judgements, as evidenced by when Persephone helps him with paperwork and the fact he let Hermes influence slightly the rules of the Pact of Punishment.\nThough he hides it well beneath his usual gruff exterior, Hades is constantly stressed from his endless job of sorting the dead, often feeling overworked, understaffed, and unappreciated, especially during times of great turmoil up on &lt;a href=\"the%20Surface\"&gt;the Surface&lt;/a&gt; such as wars and plagues, which ensure that he's never far from his desk for very long. \nHades is also well-known for his impartiality when it comes to sorting the souls of the dead. While he can and will sentence Shades to an eternity in Tartarus for any bad deeds they committed in life, he often shows a degree of leniency towards most of them as many Shades can often be seen wandering the House of Hades and chambers of Tartarus seemingly content and unpunished in any significant way. Only the darkest of souls who have committed truly wicked deeds (i.e., child abuse, hate crimes, kin slaying, pedophilia, rape, slavery, treachery, etc.) is enough to earn his eternal ire and prompt him to give them a special punishment. \nPhysical description.\nHades is a massive, hulking figure, significantly larger than any human. He has gray skin, red eyes with black sclera, and long, wavy, black hair. Notably, he also possesses a waist-length mustache whose two halves intersect each other across his upper chest, forming the shape of his symbol, Gigaros. He wears decadent red robes adorned with numerous pieces of golden, gem-encrusted jewelry with a skull motif. There is a flame-colored wreath laurel upon his head. Like &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;, Hades's bare feet emit a fiery glow and singe the ground as he walks. The skull on his shoulder is revealed to be one of &lt;a href=\"Typhon\"&gt;Typhon&lt;/a&gt;'s children.\nBefore fighting Zagreus, he also wears a long, red cape that he discards as the fight begins. In combat, he dons the Helm of Darkness, a tall, regal crown bearing the Gigaros symbol and the shape of three canine skulls.\nIn \"Hades II,\" his beard and fiery feet are his only identifiable traits; he wears only a tattered cloak and giant shackles with chains. He is generally gaunter and more sickly-looking than he was in the first installment.\nHistory.\nBefore Hades.\nHades was born as the eldest son of the titan &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt; and rebelled with &lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hestia\"&gt;Hestia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt; against his father's rule which began the Titan War. The Titans were ultimately defeated and imprisoned in the pits of &lt;a href=\"Tartarus\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt; by the gods. After the war, Hades and his brothers drew lots to equally divide the world. Hades drew the shortest lot, receiving the Underworld as his domain.\nAt some point during his rule, Hades became enamored with the daughter of his foster sister &lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt; but was unable to express his feelings to her due to fearing her overprotective mother's retaliation. Zeus felt sympathy for his brother's plight and also to Persephone's general unhappiness on Olympus and so he brought Persephone to the Underworld as a gift to Hades. Instead of being grateful, Hades was furious at his brother's recklessness as his actions could have potentially cause a war amongst the gods, and so, he finally decided to cut off contact with Zeus and the rest of the Olympians. He allowed Persephone to stay in the Underworld despite the danger it could cause should her whereabouts be discovered by her mother or the other Olympians. \nSlowly, Hades and Persephone fell in love and began their relationship culminating with Persephone becoming pregnant. Persephone was warned by Hades and others that the Fates had decreed that he would never have an heir, but Persephone nonetheless was determined to have their child. Disaster soon befell Hades and Persephone the day their child was born, as their new son who they named Zagreus was stillborn. The loss of their son was too much for Persephone and she left the Underworld for the surface leaving only a &lt;a href=\"Persephone%23Letter_to_Hades\"&gt;letter to Hades&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Goddess &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt; sought to restore Zagreus to life and succeeded in her endeavor. Hades requested Nyx with the care of the young Zagreus and fabricated the lie that Nyx was Zagreus' true birth mother. Hades' relationship with his son became estranged over time as he grew up, due to Hades being hard to please and rarely showing affection to him. Although harsh, Hades saw that his son receive the best training and had the famous hero of the Trojan War &lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt; tutor him in exchange for sending Achilles' lover &lt;a href=\"Patroclus\"&gt;Patroclus&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Elysium\"&gt;Elysium&lt;/a&gt;.\nHades also gave Zagreus a job in the administration of the Underworld, but Zagreus was unable to fulfill his tasks as he had a lack of interest for the job and usually would arrive late for work. Hades ultimately fired Zagreus from the administrative duties after the two had gotten into an argument. Later, Zagreus convinced Hypnos to make everyone in the House fall asleep so that he could make some mischief to get back at his father. However, while rummaging through his father's desk, Zagreus discover something that would change his life; the letter left by Persephone, his true birth mother. Zagreus went to Nyx, who told him the truth about Persephone. \nWith this knowledge, Zagreus decided to leave the Underworld and find his mother. Hades soon found out what his son's intentions were and amassed an army of shades among them &lt;a href=\"Asterius\"&gt;Asterius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Theseus\"&gt;Theseus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt; and even Cerberus to stop him from leaving.\nHades.\nIn the game, Hades serves as the main antagonist and the final boss.\nWhen Zagreus manages to leave the Underworld, he encounters Hades waiting for him and two fight and Zagreus wins their battle. A weakened Hades asks Zagreus to tell his mother that Cerberus is fine and is taken to the Underworld before he can answer any of Zagreus' questions. Zagreus manages to reunite with Persephone but only briefly because of the curse that runs in their family, Zagreus is unable to live on the surface and must return to the Underworld.\nHades and Zagreus continue to fight multiple times as Hades believed that Zagreus would bring calamity to the Underworld and harm to Persephone. During their last encounter, Zagreus berated Hades for his choices for keeping Persephone safe, Hades knowing that his son was in the right agreed and let him go without a fight.\nEpilogue.\nWhen the Queen comes back, Hades at first fears the possible consequences, but as she devises a plan to reunite the family, he agrees to follow it, doing his part. During the planned feast, Hades and Zeus shake hands as the situation comes to an end and they come to an understanding.\nFrom then on, Zagreus is thus tasked with checking the security of the Underworld, looking for flaws in it. As such, Hades will keep appearing as the final challenge, but their fights now are full of familiar banter in contrast to before, serving as a bond exercise between father and son.\nBefore Hades II.\nAfter the events of Hades, he and Persephone were able to conceive a second child named &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; and commissioned a portrait to commemorate the joyous occasion. However shortly after Melino\u00eb was born, Hades' father, Chronos, escaped his imprisonment within Tartarus and overpowered the entire &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt;, freezing them in time. Hades ordered &lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt; to take Melino\u00eb away from the Underworld and went off to confront his father. At his throne, Chronos demanded that Hades tell him the location of the &lt;a href=\"Fates\"&gt;Fates&lt;/a&gt; however, Hades was unable to answer him as he did not know where they were. Afterwards Chronos imprisoned Hades and the others in &lt;a href=\"Tartarus\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt;.\nHades II.\nWhen Melino\u00eb reaches Tartarus, she encounters Hades and the uncorrupted &lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt; in the room where &lt;a href=\"Sisyphus\"&gt;Sisyphus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bouldy\"&gt;Bouldy&lt;/a&gt; resided.\nAffinity.\nUntil the main story has been completed, Hades' affinity gauge will be locked at 1 heart. If given &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;, there will be some brief dialogue, but he will \"not\" give any &lt;a href=\"Keepsakes\"&gt;Keepsakes&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the affinity gauge is unlocked and if Hades is given 2 Nectar in total, he will give the &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Sigil of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;.\nHades' affinity gauge is maxed out at 5 hearts, requiring the gifting of 5 Nectar total. After the fifth Nectar is gifted and the bond is forged, Hades will return all 5 previously gifted Nectar to the player.\nIf affinity is maxed out with Hades, there will be unique text above his keepsake. this text states: \"From Hades; you share an intractable bond\" as well as \"The feared and distant underworld king knows that his hardest work is still ahead of him.\"\nFavor.\nHades' favor involves getting &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt; to return to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt;. The affinity gauge will be unlocked when Hades expresses his gratitude for returning her.\nCodex entry.\nUnlock the complete Codex Entry by speaking to Hades after reaching the True Ending.

Ha, haha!\" Well, if I'm to be remembered, I could think of far worse ways than that. Though, this \"beast\" has yet to so much as snarl at you...\n Melino\u00eb : \"&lt;Gasp&gt;\" Lord Hades, you're my... Father, I'm... Melino\u00eb. I'm your daughter.\n Hades : ...My daughter. Melino\u00eb? Merciful Fates...! You cannot be here. He shall find you. He'll find you, and...\n Melino\u00eb : ...I'll slay him where he stands. Where is he?\n Hades : He's in my blasted House! Where you were meant to be, and I. Look at me, Daughter. I could not confront him on my own. What do you expect shall happen?\n Melino\u00eb : I expect he'll underestimate me. Father, let me free you from these bonds!\n Hades : \"No!\" No, that would bring greater ruin, nothing more. Now, get out of this place. Though let me lend to you what strength I still possess.\nResponse 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"...I'll slay him where he stands. He's in the area, is he not?\"\nResponse 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"...I'll slay him where he stands. And not for the first.\"\n Hades : \n\"\"Not for the first\", truly? Then you must know the meaninglessness of the act! Look at me, Daughter. I could do nothing against him on my own. Even though I, too, have fought him before. \"Slain \"him before!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'm sorry, Father. But I shall not be deterred, even by you. Now let me free you from these bonds!\"\nBasic Narrative Dialogue.\nSecond Meeting.\n Hades : \n\"What are you doing here again? I told you, you \"cannot \"be here!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"And I told \"you \"I'd be back for you. Though my priority is Chronos. You vanquished him before. Can you reveal to me any weaknesses? Anything at all?\"\n Hades : \n\"\"I \"vanquished him with the aid of \"five other gods! \"What hope have you, alone? He has no weakness, save his arrogance. And it appears you have that weakness, too.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Then it seems we are equally matched. Father, how long have you been this way? Is there aught I can do?\"\n Hades : \n\"You think I've any sense of time in such a place? And I've said already what you can do: \"Risk not your everything. \"Go now, and be unseen.\"\nThird Meeting.\n Hades : \n\"I know not how you withstood the Titan, if truly you confronted him. Quickly now, tell me but this: Have you been... are you well?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Am I... well? All my life I've been preparing for this moment, to bring the usurper of the House of Hades to justice. So, I'll have to get back to you, depending on how it goes.\"\n Hades : \n\"...I'm sorry... I'm sorry. Get back to me if you must. I'd grant your vengeance if I could. But this is all that I can do for now.\"\nSend-offs.\nTBA\nAbouth the Scenery.\n&lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades/Hades%20II\"&gt;Fallen House of Hades&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hades : \n\"If you'd indulge a senseless curiosity... how fares my House? Your brother, he was more or less in charge of the decor. I highly doubt the Titan shares his taste.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Well, unless Zagreus was enamored of gold trim and the Titan's sneering likeness everywhere, then it's probably quite different from what you recall...\"\n Hades : \n\"\"Urgh... \"you have your mother's candor to a fault. You ought have told me everything was \"fine! \"The comfort of lies at times is all we have.\"\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hades : \n\"I cannot believe that I am asking but, how fares Olympus in all this? Even trapped within this chamber, it is evident to me that the Titan's legions are at war.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"The surface swarms with the dead, and the armies of Chronos are besieging the mountain. Our family is holding them back. I've been trying to break the stalemate in their favor, but all in all, it's not a pretty sight up there right now.\"\n Hades : \n\"\"Not a pretty sight up there... \"you mean to say you've seen all this firsthand? \"How?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You mean our birthright. Would you believe I learned a means by which I could withstand the surface climate for a while? Long enough to make a difference up there... or to try.\"\n Hades : \n\"Impossible... yet seemingly, all these impossibilities continue to occur. So you must vanquish the Titan, as well as come to the rescue of Olympus. How utterly absurd that you are burdened with all that...\"\nMiscellaneous Conversations.\nAbout Pain.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It hurts my heart to see you like this, Father. But, it brings me peace. And strength. Helps that this chamber isn't crawling with Satyrs...\"\n Hades : \n\"Oh they have sense enough to keep their distance from me... or perhaps Cerberus. Well if seeing me in this pitiable state should spur you to your fullest wrath, then so be it.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"That's not quite it; I don't feel loathing or hatred. Elsewhere in Tartarus, perhaps, but not here. Not anymore. I just hope my presence doesn't cause you further pain.\"\n Hades : \n\"No. The only pain... is that your mother and I, your brother, this dog, that we were not... we could not be there to see you grow. Each time I see you now... it fills an absence that was there.\"\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//hades.fandom.com/wiki/Chronos/Quotes%23Hades_Flashback_in_Tartarus%3A~%3Atext%3Dmy%2520little%2520spell...-%2CHades%2520Flashback%2520in%2520Tartarus%2C-Collapse\"&gt;About the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"When Chronos took our family and the House, and you bade the Witch of the Crossroads take me... I remember it somehow, or dreamt of it. Did he... demand you tell him of the Fates?\"\n Hades : \n\"How could you possibly...? He did. Perhaps the Fates themselves permitted you that bit of insight. He did his worst to discover where they hide... though would have failed, even if I did possess the knowledge that he sought.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Wait, you never told Chronos how to find the Fates? Then how did he? Because he's captured them. Not long ago, perhaps, but nonetheless. I'm certain of it.\"\n Hades : \n\"\"Hah! \"If this is true, well then my father's plan for conquest is much closer to fruition than I thought. I do not know how he could find the Fates. But if they can do nothing against him now... Daughter, what chance do you have...?\"\nAbout The &lt;a href=\"Oath%20of%20the%20Unseen\"&gt;Oath of the Unseen&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hades : \n\"The darkness stirs in such a way as I've not felt since very long ago. This cannot be the Titan's work. It must be that of the Witch of the Crossroads, if not you.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Father: \"In shadow, I serve; to shadow, I return. \"Thus have I sworn the Oath of the Unseen, who serve this realm, and execute the will of Night.\"\n Hades : \n\"I know less of the Unseen than you suppose. As it should be, lest the Titan could have learned much more. Then, may you serve the will of Night judiciously...\"\nAbout Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hades : \n\"Daughter, tell me what... became of the Witch of the Crossroads, should you know. When all seemed lost... your mother and I, we left you in her care.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"And she has cared for me ever since. Prepared me. Though, we had best not speak of her in these chambers. Suffice it to say, the Unseen remain in shadow.\"\n Hades : \n\"Good. She was... well as you say, we'd best say nothing more. Though if you have the opportunity, extend to her my deepest gratitude.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hades : \n\"Nyx, herself... even she was powerless against the Titan. Two of Night Incarnate's own sons served in my House along with her... I suppose he has them, too.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"No, Hypnos is with \"us! \"Fast asleep for all this time, perhaps some sort of... defensive response, for we have found no way to wake him. Brave Schelemeus is with us as well!\"\n Hades : \n\"Hypnos, asleep \"again? \"And I've no recollection of that other name... but time has worn on me, perhaps. Regardless, if the Witch yet leads the Unseen... the will of Night is not yet lost.\"\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//hades.fandom.com/wiki/Hades/Relationships%23Olympian_Gods%3A~%3Atext%3Dthan%2520fearing%2520Hades.-%2COlympian%2520Gods%2C-Hades%2520once%2520fought\"&gt;About Hades' Brothers&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hades : \n\"My brothers each are aiding you, are they? Zeus, doubtless leading from behind the safety of his palace walls... Poseidon, blustering as though his victory is already at hand...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Father, they're fighting to defend their home... and they're fighting for \"you! \"You're right that neither one is much inclined to show concern, but why should they? Fear spreads.\"\n Hades : \n\"They sat oblivious upon their surface realm for far too long...! But do not listen to my rantings about them. Had you known your own brother, perhaps you'd better understand the impulse for such ill-conceived remarks...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hades : \n\"What has that blasted Titan done to Cerberus, that he should storm into this place with such abandon, only to be ushered out again? Takes a small army of Satyrs to drive him back...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Chronos casts him out into the Mourning Fields above. Then rage and despair congeal about him, and his better senses take leave. My own path leads me through where he resides.\"\n Hades : \n\"So you must face him in that sorry state. Thank you, Daughter, for taking pity on the moody beast. He has seen better, but been through worse. You were too young to form a bond before, but perhaps... it is not too late.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Bouldy\"&gt;Bouldy&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Where's Cerberus, Father? He's usually right here. I saw him in the Fields as before!\"\n Hades : \n\"He runs amok at my behest. Spreads the attention of the Titan's legions thin. Eventually they drive him back, but can do him no harm.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"So just you and the boulder, then. Looking as though it's not been heaved up any hills in quite a while. Chronos doesn't make you do it?\"\n Hades : \n\"I'd have less difficult a time than a mere Shade. Besides, these shackles cannot be unlocked, save by the Titan's command. But I'd remain here for eternity before I'd grovel at his feet.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You say this boulder was companion to a mortal king? I... sense something from it. There can be so much energy within a common stone.\"\n Hades : \n\"I'll take you at your word. The boulder and I... we're not as close as was its last relationship. Though perhaps you shall coax something from it; the Witch apparently has taught you everything.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Sisyphus\"&gt;Sisyphus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hades : \n\"This chamber... it once held a prisoner of mine. A mortal king who had attempted to cheat Death! I forced the wretch to heave that boulder up that path forever. He forgave me anyway.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Forget him, Father. What purpose does it serve to dwell on some dead mortal now? Chronos wants you to wallow in your guilt. Don't.\"\n Hades : \n\"You misunderstand. The prisoner, he was called Sisyphus the King. His boulder there was like a friend. He... asked his friend to keep me company. Until more company arrived, he said.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Well then, I'm grateful to that boulder and the king. Chronos must not have accounted for your former prisoners being fond of you.\"\n Hades : \n\"Oh most of them are not. Some chose to join the Titan's legions and remain here in Tartarus. Not anywhere I cast my gaze, of course.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hades : \n\"...The scent of blood. You're injured. And you expect to face the Titan still? At least you're in the right place should you die.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I won't be dying here no matter what. As for my injuries, perhaps Lord Charon has some Life Essence in stock.\"\n Hades : \n\"Even now the Boatman plies his trade? Absurd. Our entire operation was shut down! Although... I ought remember that he serves this realm, not me.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hades : \n\"Daughter. Tell me something of yourself, for I know not a thing. For instance... what is it that you like to do? When you are not... attempting this.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"What do I like to do? Well... I ensure all of my reagents are in order, so when practicing my craft, what I need is always close at hand. And I like to... \"ungh\", Father, this rings false...\"\n Hades : \n\"\"Mm. \"Neither the time nor place for trivialities... perhaps, however, at some point... we may discuss such matters more. But there are scores to settle first.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hades : \n\"You have the Death Defiance. Runs in the family. Your brother Zagreus, he was also rather sturdy for his stature. Hard-headed, as a boy.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Don't speak of him as though he's gone! Chronos has him, and Mother, and the rest. But when all this is over... we'll see each other again.\"\n Hades : \n\"How can you be so certain? To make such guarantees of the unknown! The Titan... my father... he shall not stop. He is the most hard-headed of us all.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hades : \n\"Your mother was so proud when you were born. We... did not always think that we would have another child. But we decided to try again.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"And you did the most important thing parents can do. You \"protected \"me. As for my mother, I know her beautiful smile. The way she's looking at me in the painting that I have.\"\n Hades : \n\"The painting, it survived?! The Witch, she must have taken it... and such a risk, for such a thing. Know that your mother's radiance... cannot be captured. No matter the artist's skill.\"\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//hades.fandom.com/wiki/Hades/Relationships%23Family%3A~%3Atext%3DHeracles-%2CFamily%2C-Persephone\"&gt;Family&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You saw what happened... what Chronos did to Mother, and my brother, and the rest. Where are they? Where is he holding them?\"\n Hades : \n\"My knowledge of this is not up-to-date. He... made everybody stop, somehow. I saw them, still as stone; not petrified exactly but ensnared, in the Great Hall of the House. He must have stored them someplace else inside...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Even when I'm able to vanquish Chronos on a given night, most of the House is sealed off, and I'm unable to remain for long. How can we break them out...?\"\n Hades : \n\"Perhaps if you ask the Titan very nicely, he shall comply? Daughter, I know of no way to undo his work, and have no wisdom to impart. But \"this\", I can provide.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt; (Won Battle).\nDialogue 01.\n Hades : \n\"Such a cacophony occurred, after you last visited. Exactly when I cannot say. All of the Titan's wretched servants flew into a panic. Their cries would not cease. What transpired?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Perhaps they were concerned for their master. Or busy trying to bring him back to life. Because I slew him, finally. And it won't be the last time.\"\n Hades : \n\"Blood and darkness, \"hah... urgh! \"Then you accomplished... that which once took half the blasted strength of Olympus... all on your own.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Not on my own at all. I had their strength, if not their support; as you've given me yours. Father, we can stop him. And for now... we can kill him.\"\n Hades : \n\"He shall seek vengeance with a renewed zeal. This entire plot of his is driven by the same impulse. Then, kill him if you must.

{"id": "2521", "revid": "29110118", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2521", "title": "Hades/Relationships", "text": "Family.\nPersephone.\n&lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt;: Hades' wife.&lt;br&gt;Their relationship fell apart at some point in the past, partly due to the apparent stillbirth of Zagreus. Persephone left the underworld, while Hades hid the truth about her to Zagreus and forbade all mention of her in the House. Although Persephone had left Olympus willingly, she was technically forced to come to the Underworld by Zeus. Hades was similarly forced into the situation by his scheming brother, although they've been smitten with each other for a while. Hades did his best to give his would-be bride her space. The two would eventually come to love each other genuinely, and she brought a kinder side out of him. However, their relationship eventually faltered, largely due to the death of their newborn son, Zagreus. She left the Underworld, but did not return to Olympus, and Hades left her alone. However, Nyx pulled a favor with the Fates, and had Zagreus revived, but Hades chose to not tell Persephone in a bid to protect them from the Olympians, and concealed Zagreus' true parentage from the boy, even going so to forbid her mention in the House of Hades. When Zagreus brings Persephone back from the surface, she reunites with Hades, and the two slowly patch things up. She encourages her husband to be kinder and more patient with Zagreus, and their subjects. \nHades hasn't seen his wife since the day his father Chronos conquered his House. He mentions to his daughter Melino\u00eb that no artist could capture Persephone's beauty and expresses disappointment that the Argent Skull did not protect her as much as he preferred. \nZagreus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;: Hades' son.&lt;br&gt;Hades has a bitter relationship with his son, viewing him as a disappointment. Prior, he tried various methods to toughen Zagreus up and shape him according to his ideals. He is deeply displeased by Zagreus's attempts to escape. Upon Persephone's return and encouragement, their relationship softens somewhat, resembling mutual respect. However, Zagreus has yet to forgive his father fully, and Hades does not expect forgiveness for his actions. Hades eventually makes Zagreus' escape attempts an official job description to stress-test the Underworld's security. By the time of Persephone's return, Zagreus' relationship with his father has improved significantly, in part due to her presence. However, Zagreus is still not able to forgive his father's rude and bitter treatment over the years, while Hades expects no such grace, and instead recognizes that it is his fault in the first place. During their fights on the surface, after the Epilogue, they will mock each other with trivial matters in a light-hearted manner, while showing mutual respect for their skills and combat abilities.\nHades hasn't seen his son since the day his father Chronos conquered his House. He mentions to his daughter Melino\u00eb that Zagreus was quite headstrong for his stature when he was a boy and that it was he who was in charge of decorating the House.\nMelino\u00eb.\n&lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;: Hades' daughter.&lt;br&gt;At some point after the events of the first game, Hades and Persephone had a second child, a daughter they named Melino\u00eb. However, shortly after her birth, the House of Hades was overthrown by Chronos. Hades entrusted Melino\u00eb to the Titaness Hecate, who was to keep her safe at the Crossroads.\nHades wouldn't see his daughter again until years later when she begun her task to defeat Chronos. Hades is calm and soft towards her, a clear contrast to how he is with Zagreus. He fears Melino\u00eb's mission and the toll it might take on her, as before it took six gods to overthrow the Titan of Time, and now that task fell to only one. Nonetheless, he stays determined in his own mission and lends her his personal aid against Chronos.\nCerberus.\n&lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt;: Hades' animal companion.&lt;br&gt;Cerberus appears to be Hades' only genuine companion and reprieve from his ongoing work.\nHouse of Hades.\nNyx.\n&lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;: Hades' co-manager.&lt;br&gt;Hades and Nyx co-manage the underworld domain. Though they seem to tolerate each other begrudgingly, they hold mutual respect for one another. Before Hades' arrival to the underworld, Nyx held everything together but wasn't quite as scaled up on the parchment work or the details of the daily operations of the underworld. Upon Hades' arrival to the underworld, Nyx found Hades to be resourceful and efficient in keeping the underworld's details and operational aspects in good order. Occasionally, Hades and Nyx may disagree on certain things concerning Zagreus and the Olympians. Still, Nyx has no trouble reminding Hades of his place and shows it by literally shaking the entire house of Hades. Hades may control the maintenance of the underworld and placement and punishment of the shades, Titans, and primordial gods, but Nyx is the Night itself and not under the rule of Hades. Nyx and Hades, therefore, have a mutually beneficial arrangement, but Nyx is not a force to be toyed with by anyone, including Hades.\nHypnos.\n&lt;a href=\"Hypnos\"&gt;Hypnos&lt;/a&gt;: Hades' employee.&lt;br&gt;Supposedly, Hypnos is tasked with overseeing the newly arrived deceased souls. However, he prefers to spend most of his time sleeping, chatting, and only occasionally fulfilling his duties. The reason he hasn't been fired is because Hades finds him highly amusing, and Hypnos often gets a good laugh out of his boss (a rarity for Hades). As a result, Hades keeps him around as an unofficial court jester of sorts.\nDespite Hypnos not being the best employee, at some point, he became more dependable to Hades and more obedient than Thanatos, who often assists Zagreus from the shadows. Hypnos' effort is recognized by Hades, especially in improving his reception duties. This eventually leads to Hypnos having his face on the employee recognition board of Hades.\nIn Achilles' Codex, Hades seems to genuinely appreciate Hypnos' presence, as it brings a softer and more fun side to the House, which is much needed.\nAchilles.\n&lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt;: Hades' employee.&lt;br&gt;Hades had Achilles sign a contract stating that he would work for Hades; his job involves training and looking after Zagreus, and guarding the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//hades.fandom.com/wiki/House_of_Hades%23West_Wing\"&gt;West Wing&lt;/a&gt;.\nMegaera.\n&lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt;: Hades' employee.&lt;br&gt;Hades places deep trust in Megaera, selecting her exclusively to punish Zagreus. He does so because he knows she has unresolved matters with Zagreus and will execute the task efficiently. She is also a crucial figure in the administration of the underworld, extremely important as an enforcer in her role to maintain order. Megaera is the Fury sister in whom Hades has the most confidence because she is helpful and worth keeping within the House. She also fulfills her role of disciplining her sisters for him.\nAlthough Megaera is strict in the work environment, Hades likely sees her as similar, although he's not sure if Megaera agrees with this. He understands her sense of duty towards him, and she never breaks an order.\nThanatos.\n&lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;: Hades' employee.&lt;br&gt;Hades regards him quite highly owing to his unwavering work ethic, to the extent that he becomes the poster child for motivational posters in the administrative office. Nevertheless, within the inner circle, Thanatos doesn't appear to hold Hades' directives as unassailable decrees, unlike the unquestionable authority of his mother, Nyx. He's even open to adjusting or finding loopholes in these directives, a departure from his usual demeanor, all in a bid to aid Hades' offspring, Zagreus.\nThis favor, however, dissipates when Hades uncovers his complicity in Zagreus' actions. The discovery casts a shadow over their once-respected professional relationship.\nCharon.\n&lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;: Hades' employee.&lt;br&gt;Charon is regarded as one of Hades' most valued employees. Hades acknowledges that Charon is present in the underworld before him, diligently performing his duties. It's likely that Charon's role is of utmost importance, and he holds an equal standing with Hades. Hades doesn't take Charon lightly and knows how to show him the respect he deserves. He also understands the significance of Charon's presence, realizing that the underworld would face uncertain outcomes without him.\nUnderworld Residents.\n&lt;a href=\"Alecto\"&gt;Alecto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tisiphone\"&gt;Tisiphone&lt;/a&gt;: Hades' employees.&lt;br&gt;The Furies are the main employees that Hades sends after his runaway son to punish him in his place. Even though he doesn't have as much security and confidence in them as he does in Megaera and Thanatos, he will send them in Megaera's place if she fails, despite her protests. This is because they have caused him a lot of headaches, having expelled Tisiphone and Alecto from the house due to previous conflicts they caused within the House. He still chooses them for this task.\n&lt;a href=\"Theseus\"&gt;Theseus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Asterius\"&gt;Asterius&lt;/a&gt;: Hades' employees.&lt;br&gt;Hades's champions, he recognized Theseus and Asterius as his champions. Hades summoned them to defeat his rebel son in whatever way they desired.\nOrpheus.\n&lt;a href=\"Orpheus\"&gt;Orpheus&lt;/a&gt;: Hades' employee.&lt;br&gt;Hades's Court Musician. In fact, Orpheus does not see his wife, due to his favor to the House. He is too torn over Eurydice to even sing, let alone compose, so Hades puts him in solitary confinement, revealing that Eurydice is more important than fearing Hades.\nOlympian Gods.\nHades once fought alongside his Olympian siblings to defeat the Titans. Nowadays, he has a low opinion of the Olympians, and has cut off communication with them. In particular he seems to resent his brother Zeus due to past quarrels (and, as is later revealed, the reason behind Persephone initially departing Olympus for the Underworld).\nZeus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;: Hades' younger brother.&lt;br&gt;Hades has a complicated relationship with his youngest brother. Although Hades had an interest in the daughter of the goddess Demeter, he never asked for his brother's help in getting her attention, let alone kidnapping her, and he certainly didn't see her as a \"gift\" that could be given as an object. Zagreus will tell Hades is enraged with him, Zeus says that he and Hades had a fight, which he wants to fix, and that the next time Zagreus sees Hades, tells him that he forgives him, this forgiveness only serves to drive him crazy, because their disagreement was entirely Zeus's fault.\nPoseidon.\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;: Hades' younger brother.&lt;br&gt;Poseidon and Hades were trapped in their father's stomach for part of their lives, indicating they share a drama that Zeus does not share with them.\nHades was the one who taught Poseidon how to fight with his trident, after giving up using the sword. When he gave up using a sword, and much to Hades' dismay, Poseidon became so well known that he is now associated with the weapon. Poseidon is fond of his brother, Hades, however, admits he rarely misses him and wouldn't want his right influence to interfere with the way he handles things.\n-Upon use of Poseidon's Greater Call. Hades remarked, 'Poseidon has the habit of meddling in others' affairs!' He truly dislikes his brother's meddling habit!\nDemeter.\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;: Hades' foster sister and mother-in-law.&lt;br&gt;\nDemeter finds Hades dull and dislikes his dark presence. He is undoubtedly the last suitor she would ever want for her daughter. Hades is terrified of her and is keeping Persephone's existence a secret, partially out of fear of what she would do. Hades, in particular, calls her a \"witch\" who could do terrible things if she was angry. When Demeter found out the whole truth, she was incredibly willing to accept that her daughter was married to him and loved him.\nAthena.\n&lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;: Hades' niece.&lt;br&gt;-Upon use of Athena's Greater Call. Hades is too busy and did not directly contact his niece in Hades. He reminds Zagreus that Athena can't always protect him, indicating her subordination to him. This statement shows that, despite being an influential goddess, as part of a younger generation, she is subordinate to Hades and lacks the power to directly interfere with his commands. At least Hades knows that his niece puts herself in her place when addressing him, unlike Zagreus.\nAres.\n&lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;: Hades' nephew.&lt;br&gt;-Upon use of Ares's Greater Call. Hades found it predictable that the god of war would be present! and made it clear that it is best for his nephew Ares to stay out of his affairs, labeling him a busybody.\nAres will express his admiration for his Uncle Hades, as he sees War and Death as going hand in hand. Ares is notably the only Olympian god who will offer praise to Hades without it feeling like a backhanded compliment.\nArtemis.\n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;: Hades' niece.&lt;br&gt;-Upon use of Artemis's Greater Call. Hades thinks that Artemis should choose smaller prey and that this hunt is out of her reach.\nHades and Artemis are both indifferent, stoic, and preoccupied. Achilles speculates that despite all Hades resents and complains about regarding his \"irresponsible\" Olympian relatives, he could actually get along well with his reliable niece, equally distant and obedient, if he tried.\nIn the Epilogue, her encounter with her uncle fills her with excitement, even though she harbors reservations about his tendency to keep secrets. Still, she's willing to set aside these concerns.\nApollo.\n&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;: Hades' nephew.&lt;br&gt;Hades finds his nephew Apollo too bright for his eyes.\nAphrodite.\n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;: The Goddess of Love and Beauty.\n-Upon use of Aphrodite's Greater Call. For Hades, Aphrodite has no jurisdiction in his domain. He calls her \u201cthat meddling goddess of love!\u201d Indicating that she herself interfered a lot in his love life.&lt;br&gt;\nHermes.\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;: Hades' nephew.&lt;br&gt;Hermes has met his uncle Hades once before the events of the game, presumably when he got assigned his role as psychopomp. He claims to have been a \"memorable experience\".\nInitially, they don't seem to have much in common in terms of temperament, but both are quite dedicated to their duties. Hermes was present during the making of the Pact of Punishment, and likely gave his own insights, which implies Hades doesn't mind his opinion, a rare occurrence.\nDionysus.\n&lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;: Hades' nephew.\n-Upon use of Dionysus's Greater Call. \"Hades says that drunk's power means nothing to him!\". \u201cWhy are you staining my clothes with wine?!\u201d. \"This is a battle, not a time for revelry!\" Indicating that his nephew is clueless enough.\nLater, Zagreus suggests that his father enjoyed a good party, but Hades will never agree, especially if Dionysus is in the mix.\nThe Titans.\nThe previous rulers of the world, defeated in the Titan War and imprisoned in the pits of &lt;a href=\"Tartarus\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt;.\nChronos.\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;: Hades' father.&lt;br&gt; Hades fought and overthrew Chronos and the other Titans, and imprisoned them in Tartarus. In various dialogues with Zagreus, Hades has described the Titans as exceedingly cruel and terrible parents, far worse than he ever was. The only good thing Hades has said about his father, was that he was less of a terrible father than the Titan Hyperion (Demeter's father), who was considered to be the worst of them all. By the time of &lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;, Chronos has escaped the pits of Tartarus, and captured Hades.\nOthers.\nHeracles.\n&lt;a href=\"Heracles\"&gt;Heracles&lt;/a&gt;: Mightiest of Men.&lt;br&gt; \nHades despises Heracles entirely and still harbors resentment and anger toward him for invading the Underworld and unexpectedly stealing Cerberus in the past to fulfill one of his \"12 Labors\" requirements."}

{"id": "2296", "revid": "48934972", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2296", "title": "Hecate", "text": "Hecate is the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; Goddess of Witchcraft, Necromancy, Doorways, and Crossroads closely associated with the &lt;a href=\"Selene\"&gt;Moon&lt;/a&gt;. \nShe appears in &lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt; and serves as a mentor to &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; in her quest against &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nHecate is strong-willed, independent, and a morally dubious witch. She is primarily a source of comfort and encouragement for Melino\u00eb, serving as a mentor to Melino\u00eb, and loving her dearly, but is very strict and rigorous with her training. However, Hecate does not see herself as a parental substitute and is shown to be greatly annoyed whenever Melino\u00eb implies that she sees her as anything more than a teacher.\nHecate is very mysterious, withholding much of her past involving dark magic and avoids answering certain questions as much as possible. One such instance is when Melino\u00eb asks Hecate for a way to remove the curse of &lt;a href=\"Arachne\"&gt;Arachne&lt;/a&gt;. Hecate explains that Arachne's fate is not for Melino\u00eb to undo and accidentally reveals her knowledge of the feud between Arachne and Athena. When Melino\u00eb questions her on how she knew about the feud between them Hecate brushes her off.\nShe also possesses a sense of humor, finding it fun to transform Melino\u00eb into a sheep during their fight at Erebus. She reserves her attention and affection exclusively for Melino\u00eb and acts very strictly with her other pupil &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;, who Hecate puts in second place due to seeing her behavior as a detriment and only tolerates both her and her sister &lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt; because of her oaths to &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;.\nHecate is more covertly blaming herself for Chronos taking over the Underworld, as she was tasked to defend it from such forces, seeing it as her greatest failure.\nPhysical description.\nHecate wears a large, wide-brimmed hat with a crescent moon and the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Sisters\"&gt;Silver Sisters&lt;/a&gt; braided cord, alongside a purple cape over her top and dress. The top is of a lighter shade than the cape and ends with a silver trim; above it she uses a silver crescent moon neckpiece as well as a pin of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt;'s symbol. For the bottom part, she uses a purple dress below a burgundy one, the latter noticeably having a star pattern on top, and both being topped by a black fabric; above it she uses a loose double silver belt, adorned with moons and the circle seen in her spells. Her belt and shoulders have green tassels hanging from them. Most of her face is veiled by a burgundy fabric, leaving only her green eyes visible. Although most of her body is not visible, her outfit leaves her toned midriff exposed. She has pauldrons in the shape of a head on each shoulder which connect to her neckpiece and veil with silver moons. Her hair is long and braided and is shown to emit a silvery green tone under the moonlight. Her signature weapons are a pair of Torches.\nHades II.\nHecate was charged with detecting any threats against the Underworld. Unfortunately, Hecate like many others did not foresee the return of the Titan of Time, Chronos. When the Titan attacked, she was ordered by Hades to escape with the infant Melino\u00eb and to take care of her. Hecate took Melino\u00eb, &lt;a href=\"Hypnos\"&gt;Hypnos&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"The_Crossroads%23Living_Space\"&gt;unfinished portrait&lt;/a&gt; of the royal family to the Crossroads.\nDuring the game's events, Hecate leads the resistance against Chronos and oversees Melino\u00eb's progress on her mission to slay the Titan. She serves as the boss encounter of &lt;a href=\"Erebus\"&gt;Erebus&lt;/a&gt;, the reason being that she needs to make sure that Melino\u00eb is strong enough for the challenges in the lower levels.\nAffinity.\nIf given &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;, Hades will give you the &lt;a href=\"Keepsakes/Hades%20II\"&gt;Silver Wheel&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of Early Access, October 2024, Hecate's affinity is maxed out at 9 hearts, which requires 6 Nectar, 2 &lt;a href=\"Bath%20Salts\"&gt;Bath Salts&lt;/a&gt;, and 1 &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Lures\"&gt;Twin Lures&lt;/a&gt;.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

But, you accomplished something of great import.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I lack such forgiveness for my failure, Headmistress Hecate. The Titan yet lives, and Olympus yet burns, while I'm back where I started! What is it I accomplished?\"\n Hecate : \n\"You're here to speak of it! Recovered in body, if not in spirit. You've not failed; merely begun. Thus may you learn, grow stronger, and complete your task. \"Death to Chronos.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Death to Chronos.\"\nContinuation 01.\n Hecate : \n\"This cauldron's filthy still, alas. But there's something at our Altar you may use, and I've unsealed the Silver Pool as well.\"\nContinuation 02.\n Hecate : \n\"We shall await your safe return. May moonlight guide you.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hecate : \n\"'Twas a worthwhile first attempt, Melino\u00eb. I trust you'd have gone farther still had I not obstructed your path. Quite unsuccessfully, I concede.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You needed to ensure I was prepared, Headmistress Hecate. And I know there is much left to prove.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Just so. Trust well your instincts and your craft, and continue the task. \"Death to Chronos.\"\nBasic Narrative Dialogue.\nChanting.\nChanting 01.\n\"\"Upon this cauldron, by the will of Night,\" &lt;br&gt;\n\"\"Hear me, Shades of the Dead, and listen well,\" &lt;br&gt;\n\"\"Your strength is needed now to join our fight,\" &lt;br&gt;\n\"\"Upon Olympus and in depths of hell.\" &lt;br&gt;\n\"\"Within these Crossroads you are safe with us,\" &lt;br&gt;\n\"\"Yet we would ask your service to our cause.\" &lt;br&gt;\n\"\"Your will is yours, your choice is given thus:\" &lt;br&gt;\n\"\"Together, let us rise above our flaws.\" &lt;br&gt;\n\"So mote it be.\"\nChanting 02.\n\"\"By light of Moon, in darkest Erebus,\" &lt;br&gt;\n\"\"Look well upon the wards about this place,\" &lt;br&gt;\n\"\"Which keep us hidden within Night's embrace.\" &lt;br&gt;\n\"\"Ensure that each is whole, its strength secure,\" &lt;br&gt;\n\"\"As we hold out against our common foe;\" &lt;br&gt;\n\"\"To achieve victory we must endure\" &lt;br&gt;\n\"\"The ravages on us Time would bestow.\" &lt;br&gt;\n\"So mote it be.\"\nAbouth the Scenery.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hecate : \n\"Grow not attached to such a place as this; you belong within the luxury of your great father's House.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"As you say, Headmistress...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Oceanus\"&gt;Oceanus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hecate : \n\"'Tis fortunate your father's realm is vast indeed, that you may circumnavigate it at the edge of Oceanus, where our enemy is relatively weak.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"If we cannot pass directly through Elysium, then we shall make what way we can. Though the fiends that lurk the border of the sea care not for my presence.\"\n Hecate : \n\"God-hating monsters with salt in their veins; the seas covering the world's surface just were not enough for them. The sunken chambers they occupy have not yet fallen to Chronos, at least.\"\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Headmistress, if I may? What is it that you and Master Odysseus are planning? He's always with his charts and diagrams.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Odysseus considers our plan of attack. \"Yours\", more specifically. He plots a course from the nearest Underworld entrance to Olympus.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"The \"surface...? \"I am to attack \"Olympus? \"When? How?\"\n Hecate : \n\"\"Attack, defend... \"'tis all the same. Patience, Melino\u00eb. As you observed, we are still... working through some of the details.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"But... \"mm.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Headmistress, if Olympus is besieged, then why am I not permitted on the surface? If I could aid the gods, then they could aid us even more!\"\n Hecate : \n\"Melino\u00eb, however you complete the task is up to you; I have not barred you from the surface. But I caution, if you go, your strength shall fail you. Your birthright is to blame; no fault of yours.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Born in the Underworld and here I'll stay, thank the Fates. I don't intend to live up there, I just... Do you know how long I'd even have?\"\n Hecate : \n\"I know your brother and father had a day at best ere they could not stand it any longer. Perhaps you're different, but don't count on it.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"A day at best...?\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hecate : \n\"You visited the surface. I can't imagine \"that \"played out particularly well. At least you made it back at all.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It was draining... even at night, something about being under the stars, I... didn't know there were so many. It was more than I could take. You were right.\"\n Hecate : \n\"A lesson learned, and an experience gained. The Fates themselves do not want you up there. What shall you do?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I have an incantation to complete. I don't need to stay forever on the surface... I just need to hold on long enough to make it to Olympus...\"\n Hecate : \n\"\"Ah\", then you seek to improve this aspect of yourself, without rejecting it outright. I see how that may work...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It has to...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Thessaly\"&gt;Rift of Thessaly&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hecate : \n\"How fares the ever-sinking fleet of ships within the Rift of Thessaly? 'Tis a wonder Chronos gathered as many followers as he has, using such shoddily built craft.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"The fleet shows no real sign of slowing down. Fortunately, the same sorcery that seems to be holding those ships together lets me transfer quickly from one to the next. Are all surface ships so odd-looking?\"\n Hecate : \n\"I certainly think not. \"These \"are merely emblematic of the Titan's false promises of a new age. They assault not just Olympus but our sensibilities as well.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"We'll fight them off.\"\nMiscellaneous Conversations.\nAbout Backstory.\n Hecate : \n\"Such a mess made of our best-laid plans. Leave it to swiftest Hermes to show up one evening with bad news, then scurry off! Nary a message from him since, whilst \"you \"are forced now to attempt the task we'd no intention to initiate till many moons hence...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Hermes must still be trying to figure out what Chronos is up to... the attacks on Olympus grown so much bolder all of a sudden. We just couldn't afford to wait any longer for details, could we...?\"\n Hecate : \n\"No, Hermes was quite insistent about that. Persuaded Artemis to do her part, and now it seems your other \"mountain relatives \"are finally aware of you. They have been quick to be of benefit, at least?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Most certainly.\"\nAbout Mission.\nDialogue 01.\n Hecate : \n\"What troubles you, Melino\u00eb? Your brow is furrowed not with fierceness but with doubt... the one emotion we cannot afford.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"Ungh\", Headmistress, it's just... I'm struggling to muster the rage I should feel. I'm tasked with slaying a Titan I do not even know, to avenge a family I cannot remember...\"\n Hecate : \n\"Your feelings never lie to you; 'tis their origins that may deceive. You feel no rage? Then \"you \"are in control. Tell me, do you question the need to complete our task?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"No, Headmistress. Treachery against the House of Hades cannot go unpunished.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Just so. Center yourself on that.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hecate : \n\"How fares the task thus far, Melino\u00eb? Our enemy yet remains indisposed with more pressing matters. The time to strike at him is now.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"There is much left to do, Headmistress. You must know that. How much time do I have?\"\n Hecate : \n\"Who can say? Our enemy is Time itself. Time's passage seems to bear little meaning anymore. Do not rush needlessly. The task shall only take longer that way.\"\nAbout Pressure.\n Hecate : \n\"Much is expected of you. The pressure that you feel; you never speak of it, and yet full well I know it's there. Your constant companion.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I can hardly distinguish between pressure and faith anymore. My entire life has led to this, and all of you are counting on me. Are you truly so certain in my inevitable success, Headmistress?\"\n Hecate : \n\"Pressure and faith are intertwined, 'tis true. Ever in conflict. Should the pressure utterly prevail, out comes despair. Only then do we truly falter.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You didn't answer my question. The combined might of the gods was not enough to stop Chronos before. And you know the Fates are unpredictable. My success is not a certainty...\"\n Hecate : \n\"My faith is not in outcomes, 'tis in you! And I've enough of it to last. Should you find yours lacking, I shall always spare you some of mine.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"...Thank you for believing in me.\"\n Hecate : \n\"No need.\"\nAbout Quest Log.\nDialogue 01.\n Hecate : \n\"At least our cauldron's finally purified, praise the Fates! Speaking of which, are you as yet considering an invocation to them? I have my doubts that they would listen, even now...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"If there's any chance the Three Fates shall aid us, I'll take it. Thank you for preparing things for me. Though, I'm well short of freshly picked reagents still.\"\n Hecate : \n\"\"Mm. \"I'd offer such reagents if I could but, as you venture past this glade look carefully along your path and you shall find them. Fates willing...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Yes, Headmistress.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hecate : \n\"The Fates indulged you after all. That is their scroll beside your tent; it followed you out of the shadows. Perhaps it can provide some answers.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Would that it does. The Fated List has tasked me with ensuring certain minor prophecies are fulfilled, though says little else as yet.\"\n Hecate : \n\"May it reward your efforts, at least. But do not expect the Fates to always favor you; the bane of our enemy is not necessarily our friend.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"We'll have to take our chances...\"\nAbout The &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Trials\"&gt;Chaos Trials&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hecate : \n\"Those paths and possibilities are real, like as not; as are the splendors that await, should you indulge our primordial benefactor. There always is uncertainty where Chaos is concerned... yet I trust that Nyx's parent is an ally, not a threat.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I trust so too.\"\nAbout The &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Book of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hecate : \n\"Have you had opportunity to glean much from the Book of Shadows yet, Melino\u00eb? Our task shall take you far beyond these Crossroads; you've much to learn as yet.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"As I begin to have insights into my experiences, the Book reveals more. Are they \"your \"teachings within, Headmistress?\"\n Hecate : \n\"Not mine alone, though heed them anyway...\"\nAbout The &lt;a href=\"Umbral%20Flames\"&gt;Umbral Flames&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hecate : \n\"I recall when I myself first grasped the Flames of Ygnium. I must have been about your age. Now you are possessed of their power.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"All it takes is a bit of light to cast a long shadow; isn't that so, Headmistress? I'll do my best to wield the Flames as you have taught.\"\n Hecate : \n\"In your \"own \"way, Melino\u00eb.\"\nAbout Nightmares.\n Hecate : \n\"Your dreams have troubled you again, I see. Despite your brave attempts to conceal it.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I can manage them, Headmistress, it's just... it's Chronos. I now hear him even when I'm still as death.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Then turn your nightmares into his. Your subconscious self is your greatest refuge. Let none there remain whom you do not permit.\"\nAbout Family.\nDialogue 01.\n Hecate : \n\"You always reminded me of your father, Melino\u00eb, but lately you remind me of your mother... more and more. The concern for others that you sometimes show... it can be an exploitable weakness.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I would never put any such concerns ahead of the task, Headmistress.\"\n Hecate : \n\"See that you don't! Although my remark was not intended as admonishment; it was my honor to have known your family... even if merely from the shadows.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"They'll be avenged.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hecate : \n\"You always reminded me of your father, Melino\u00eb, but lately you remind me of your mother... more and more.

I see and sense the changes in this place. Changes for all our betterment, not just your own.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"A proper incantation is never to be used for selfish gain. Though, if I can help bring about positive change from which I benefit, isn't that selfish, still?\"\n Hecate : \n\"Discard such doubts as that. You are not thinking solely of yourself, thus you are not thinking selfishly. I've not taught you to neglect your needs, have I?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Of course not.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Then, good.\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Arcana%20Cards\"&gt;Arcana Cards&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hecate : \n\"Returning from the shadows restores your body, whilst meditating at your Altar emboldens your spirit. Such knowledge in the ashes of the past.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'm still struggling to internalize the Arcana, Headmistress. If I share the same potential as my predecessors, why don't I feel a stronger bond?\"\n Hecate : \n\"Your bond can only be as strong as your understanding. One either learns from history or else repeats mistakes. I suggest the former.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"...I'll keep studying.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hecate : \n\"You have been fixed upon your Altar even more than usual of late. Have the Arcana shown you aught of note?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'm beginning to see the cards in a new light... each depicts a significant choice made in the past. Such knowledge may help make better choices in the future.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Indeed. We choose as wisely as we can, using what knowledge we have. So you now clearer see into the \"cards\", as you call them...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Indeed.\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Arcana%20Cards\"&gt;Arcana Card&lt;/a&gt; Upgrades.\n Hecate : \n\"I was curious to see if you would consecrate the Altar of Ashes on your own. It ought to be further attuned to you as a result; the secrets of the Arcana, nearer to your grasp.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"The Altar is a threshold through which we all pass, going to and from these Crossroads. A gateway to the past, present, and future. I know it isn't mine alone; it's ours. \"\n Hecate : \n\"Correct, on all three counts.\"\nAbout Resources.\nDialogue 01.\n Hecate : \n\"Have you been finding anything of use out there, in your forays? No point returning empty-handed. Though you may lack the necessary tools, I suppose.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Erebus still teems with hidden life. I'm finding all sorts of things we need out there. I'm very grateful for the purse! It never weighs me down.\"\n Hecate : \n\"A witch cannot afford to be encumbered. The blessings and such from your relatives may be fleeting, but whatever goes into that purse isn't going anywhere. Not till you use it, of course.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I wanted to ask you something, Headmistress. All these reagents I've been gathering, taking from the earth. From Mother Gaia. How can I make it up to her?\"\n Hecate : \n\"Well, you can start by not wallowing in senseless guilt. Think you that Gaia would reveal her abundances to you if she believed you would not put them to good use?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"But you taught me never to take more than I need. Now I'm taking everything in sight.\"\n Hecate : \n\"And Gaia knows you'll need all that and more. Fear not, your plunder returns whence it came through your craft. If not your garden there.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hecate : \n\"You're frustrated, Melino\u00eb. Why can't I simply furnish you with all of the reagents you require? So many incantations you could sooner cast...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I know full well the answer, Headmistress. Your own reagents bring power to your craft, as my own do to mine. Only through the effort of their procurement do they gain their properties.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Just so. At time 'tis quite the pain, admittedly. Yet what is our craft but making our intentions manifest? For which there can be no shortcuts.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"No shortcuts.\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Familiars\"&gt;Familiars&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hecate : \n\"That indolent little amphibian whom you keep... did my eyes deceive, or did I see him hopping rather energetically toward the egress?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You saw it true! I've compelled little Frinos to join me in my attempts out there. Surely you've taught me wards and charms enough to keep a familiar safe?\"\n Hecate : \n\"One can but hope! And may your familiar keep \"you \"safe, in turn. And perhaps scrounge up some more roots and such for us.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hecate : \n\"A cat recently strutted clear into our grove, as though my wards of shadow weren't even there! Please tell me that's a new familiar of yours?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"That would be Toula, Headmistress, and yes! I figured I could use a confident and independent companion such as that.\"\n Hecate : \n\"As can we all. The beasts whom you entrust are welcome here. Would that all our acquaintances were such a welcome sight...\"\nDialogue 03.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"How fare Hecuba and Gale lately, Headmistress? They must be ill-at-ease with all of the bustle and new faces and the like.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Oh, they're fine. The hound and polecat make strange bedfellows, but are able to withstand more than their share of hardship or discomfort. Especially when you lavish them with attention.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'm sure to win their hearts one of these nights! Do you ever think they miss their former selves? Or are their transformations utterly complete?\"\n Hecate : \n\"Each of them I turned at her behest. Hecuba retains her regal poise, Gale her mischief. They relish one another's company; and ours.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"The feeling's mutual!\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Shade\"&gt;Shades&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hecate : \n\"The Shades about this place are all abuzz in their support of you, you know. You have a gift for leaving an impression on them. And for compelling more of them to join with us.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"They were just people once, or other living beings. All they ever needed was something to believe in, in death as well as life. And a way out of Erebus.\"\n Hecate : \n\"\"Hm\", well. They're sworn to you, that much is clear to me. I'd purge them all if I had any doubt! Perhaps they think they'll find a cushy spot within Elysium once all is said and done.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I think it's more than that.\"\nAbout Surviving &lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Headmistress... Olympus seems reluctant to ask outright, but I can tell my family there needs me. I cannot shake the sense that I have to help them, before I can achieve our task.\"\n Hecate : \n\"You needn't shake that sense, for it may well be accurate. Are you still thinking of an incantation that may help you to survive such a journey?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I am. Up there, I'll be like a fish out of water, right? Suffocating. But with a proper incantation, I was thinking maybe I could hold my breath. Until Olympus is secure.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Such a spell shall not be simple. Though, if you demonstrate that you're sufficiently well traveled, then... perhaps magick such as that shall help you go farther still.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'm counting on it.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hecate : \n\"Your recent travels to the surface. How were you able to survive up there? You were away for longer than I would have expected.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"My surface-breathing incantation made a difference after all, Headmistress. I still felt the oppressive atmosphere up there, weighing down on me... but not crushing me quite like before.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Magick born of your resolve. I'm impressed, though not entirely surprised. May your craft thus protect you ere Olympus is secure.\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt; Anomaly.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Headmistress, I saw him. Chronos! First beyond Erebus, in the guise of an old man. He then attempted to ensnare me in some vision out of time... the river of flame, everything ablaze...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"So he claims. I broke free from his spell like it was second-nature, but... neither could I raise a hand against him. What must I do now?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"The influence of Chronos is much stronger in Oceanus than here. He attempted to ensnare me in a vision of another time. A field of flame.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Yet you were able to elude his grasp. An aspect of your condition we expected would come into play as you pushed closer to our foe. Continue with still-greater caution, nonetheless...\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt; Time Stop.\n Hecate : \n\"Those Sands that you recovered from our enemy. They've something of his nature in each tiny grain. A key of sorts, to the Dissolution of Time. Do you concur?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I do. That very incantation sprang to mind... an expression of all you taught me of his weaknesses. A means to unravel his very being... to bring death to Chronos at last. He doesn't seem to realize it's possible... still thinks I'm just an agent of Olympus.\"\n Hecate : \n\"'Tis merely evidence that our concerted efforts have not been in vain. You cross the Underworld like a tempest, whilst I remain in shadows. But, when the Titan's time at last comes to an end, I \"dearly \"wish to be there myself. To see the look on his face.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"We'll get him, Headmistress...\"\nAbout Weapons.\n Hecate : \n\"The Nocturnal Arms are beginning to awaken. May we yet see an age when they can slumber once again. Have you a favored sister yet among the lot?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I am grateful that the weapons of Night have accepted me. I intend to treat them equally, Headmistress.\"\n Hecate : \n\"A commendable approach, but not a necessary one. The Nocturnal Arms share our purpose. They care little as to which of them you use, only that the task is completed.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"We'll see it through.\"\nAbout The Aspects.\n Hecate : \n\"So, the Arms of Night have revealed to you some of their former selves; or future selves, perhaps. Few have earned the right to bear such weapons. Much less take advantage of their different likenesses!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"The various Aspects I've discovered... some of the bearers I know well. Medea, Artemis... they're all connected to \"you\", aren't they?\"\n Hecate : \n\"'Tis not as simple as you may presume... you bear a set of artifacts whose aim is to safeguard the Underworld. Each Aspect is of somebody who played a part in this, or shall.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It seems I'm in good company...\"\nAbout Boss Battle.\nDialogue 01 (Lost Battle).\n Hecate : \n\"Melino\u00eb. I held back against you out there. And even still, you could not surpass me. Do you know why?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"...I know I can grow stronger still, but... it's my lack of knowledge that betrayed me in the end. Some of your many tricks I've yet to learn.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Correct! Strength; knowledge; patience. When faced with a seemingly indomitable adversary, all three are required. Or a stroke of fate...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'll count on the former.\"\nDialogue 02 (Lost Battle).\n Hecate : \n\"I thwarted you again out there. 'Tis unfair, I know. I arrive fresh as rain in anticipation of our clash, whilst you may already be battle-worn.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Fairness is a luxury, Headmistress. Though, I do sometimes envy your ability to travel such long distances in an instant.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Do not be quick to envy what you do not understand. Along your path are to be found resources and reagents we require. And if you cannot get past me, then you are unprepared for what awaits beyond.\"\nDialogue 03 (Won Battle).\n Hecate : \n\"You have gone far, Melino\u00eb, and you bested me. Gave me quite a scrape, at that! There is much left to be done. But, you are learning.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Thank you, Headmistress. Although, I know that I could not have bested you had you held nothing back.\"\n Hecate : \n\"You \"know? \"Why do you self-impose such limits on your capability? \"Alter your thoughts\". I shall see you again out there.\"\nAbout Clearing the &lt;a href=\"Underworld\"&gt;Underworld&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hecate : \n\"You prevailed in your attempt; but our enemy is Time itself, and 'twould seem that he is not prepared to abdicate his stolen throne as yet.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"Prevailed\", sure. And yet, I feel as though I've come no closer to achieving our true goal. My task, sometimes I fear... it's impossible.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Impossibility tends to be transient. Time would wear us down; but with patience, we can withstand him until our night arrives at last.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Patience, then...\"\nAbout Beasts.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Headmistress, have you always been so fond of beasts? It seems you would do anything for each other.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Beasts... saddled with such an uncharitable name. Beasts are far more trusting than most any mortal or immortal I have met.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"They make it seem so simple, don't they? To fully trust.\"\n Hecate : \n\"One knows where she stands with beasts, whether she is loved by them or doomed to sate their hunger. Would that the gods were so dependable.\"\nAbout Wellness.\n Hecate : \n\"You look unwell. Returning is difficult, I know. Tell me if you need anything.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I think I'm all right, thank you, Headmistress. How do you manage it when you are out of sorts?\"\n Hecate : \n\"Oh I've a draught for every mood, and more. Sorrow, pain, anxiety, love-sickness, dispassion, rage, fear, nausea, cowardice... all sensations one can rectify, whether with mental fortitude or, failing that, a potent drink.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Perhaps some other time.\"\nAbout Relationships.\n Hecate : \n\"You have a flush about you I could see as you approached! No need to tell me of its source, if you prefer to keep whomever it is to yourself.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"Whomever it is\", Headmistress? Could it not have been the product of a balmy night, or lingering effect of my return?\"\n Hecate : \n\"Unlikely. Look, Melino\u00eb, I was much like you once. I've said to you before that feelings mustn't be ignored. Heed the ones that spur you on, they're good! Confront the rest.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Plenty of each...\"\nAbout Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Fates\"&gt;The Fates&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I dreamt of Father once again. When Chronos came for him, and you took me to safety. Except this time, I remained there longer than before.\"\n Hecate : \n\"'Tis more than a dream, of course. And what else did you learn whilst you lingered thus?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I learned Chronos wanted for Father to tell him where to locate the Three Fates. Chronos hates them, or feels threatened by them. He's been searching for them all this time, hasn't he? And finally found them.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Which means they may not take our side if forced to choose. I feared as much, yet didn't wish to lend the possibility my voice. Well, this certainly fits the spirit of the news swift Hermes relayed when he spurred us to act! \"Something real real bad\", I believe were his words?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"Real real bad\", yes...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Selene\"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hecate : \n\"Sister Selene tells me that she lent you her brilliance and might. You were able to draw her down even within this place?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I found a source of moonlight and invoked Selene's aid using the Words, Headmistress. I can't imagine the extent of her power.\"\n Hecate : \n\"You know her power perfectly well. You simply haven't had the opportunities to wield it. You shall have them very soon, I think.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"This task... why does it fall solely to me, Headmistress? Because, Nemesis, she...\"\n Hecate : \n\"\"She \"is a burden. Had I not sworn to Nyx that I would watch over her children, I'd have cast her out for insubordination long ago.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"She's frustrated you haven't given her a chance. Her strength far surpasses mine, and she's trained at least as hard, I've seen it!\"\n Hecate : \n\"Why defend her thus, Melino\u00eb? Her attitude speaks far louder than she. I shall entrust nothing of import to one such as that.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"&lt;Scoff&gt;\"\n&lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Last night, Headmistress, I... traversed a gate that led me to the depths of Chaos. Where I met its host! I've heard so much from you of Nyx, yet somehow I never expected to meet her mother and father... of all creation, not just her.\"\n Hecate : \n\"An audience with Primordial Chaos... I'd not entirely expected that! Although given that Nyx herself has not been seen since Chronos took the House of Hades, I am unsurprised. There is no fury like that of a parent bereft of their child. Does Chaos seem an ally to us, then?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I believe so.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Well, thank you Nyx for that...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hecate : \n\"Eris has returned to us, I trust you've seen! It was my dearest hope that leaving all her rubbish here would soon enough inspire her to pick it up, but alas... You stay away from her.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I thought perhaps you'd finally relieved her of her entry privileges. I won't let Eris turn this place into a sty for pigs, even if it means having to clean up after her myself.\"\n Hecate : \n\"\"Ah\", how she'd chortle could she see now the frustration on your face. I know, ignoring things is seldom how one makes them go away, but... when it comes to Eris, I fear it's our best shot...\"\nDialogue 02 (Lost Battle).\n Hecate : \n\"Sister Selene notified me it was Eris herself who barred you from gaining the heights of Olympus. She never should have got her hands on the Rail of Adamant again, that \"wretch.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Headmistress, is there truly nothing we can do? Your oath to Nyx means Eris can come and go here as she pleases, only to try and blast me to bits when I approach my goal?\"\n Hecate : \n\"One must carefully consider the terms of binding contracts, Melino\u00eb. A mistake on my part you are paying for firsthand, \"heh. \"And I apologize. Do bring her hell when next you meet?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Sounds good...\"\nDialogue 03 (Won Battle).\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I vanquished Eris on the surface, but could go no farther from that point... I was nearly at the base of Olympus, yet my path was sealed, like it didn't even exist!\"\n Hecate : \n\"Eris must find all of this delightful, certainly. That pathway wasn't sealed, 'twas a void. No incantation is required, merely patience... for the future to unfold.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"But Olympus needs us \"now. \"My task could ill-afford to wait, that's why we started when we did! That's what you said!\"\n Hecate : \n\"Time works in curious ways, Melino\u00eb; that much we have experienced firsthand. Fear not! The path to Olympus \"shall \"open. Mortals \"pray \"for such outcomes; \"we but wait.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"...We but wait.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Headmistress, I saw him. \"Chronos! \"He was in the pathways beyond Erebus. I struck as soon as I realized who he was, but to no avail.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Wily bastard. Arrogant to the last... So then, he knows of you. What did he say?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"He thanked the Fates that we had finally met, as though he'd been searching for me all this time... and told me to not make the same mistakes as my family.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Eject that poisoned memory from your mind; he knows nothing of the Fates' designs. I shall reinforce all our protective sorceries, and \"you: \"Fear not your enemy; \"slay him!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Chronos was waiting for me again outside of Erebus. This time I recognized him right away, but I could do nothing against him...\"\nDialogue 03 (Lost Battle).\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Headmistress, I found him! \"Chronos! \"Deep within Tartarus, just as you said. I did everything as practiced and as planned, except... he was too strong.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Still your heart, Melino\u00eb, you're safe. And you were able to return again, which means that all your training served you well... So then... he realizes who you are?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"He does. We've lost the element of surprise now, haven't we? Damn it... how could I fail?\"\n Hecate : \n\"Nothing has changed; you're to confront him down where he resides. Where your mother and father rightly ought to be. But go with patience, not with haste. He may know something of your power now, yet not enough.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"...I'll get him.\"\nDialogue 04 (Lost Battle).\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I reached the House, Headmistress. Did everything as practiced and as planned, except... he was too strong.\"\n Hecate : \n\"\"No\", this is an \"excellent \"result! You are still here, having learned more of what it takes to reach our enemy, and what \"he \"can do to resist! Do you feel ready to continue your pursuit?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Yes. If I can reach him... I can take him.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Take him.\"\nDialogue 05 (Lost Battle).\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Again I've failed to destroy the Titan, Headmistress. Night after night he thwarts me, expecting I'll eventually give in...\"\n Hecate : \n\"But you've no such intent, correct? You cannot stop him, and neither has he been able to stop \"you. \"You are resistant to his power and he cannot bar you from \"your realm.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You make it sound as though I've beaten him.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Not yet; but soon enough, I trust.\"\nDialogue 05 (Won Battle).\n Hecate : \n\"You're back...! Now tell me everything. You found your mark? What then?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I reached the edge of Tartarus and made my way into the House, just as we planned. Chronos was there, on my father's throne. We clashed. He lost. But I know he isn't gone. And I was unable to linger there for long.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Truly? And, you retrieved something from him, I see. We were never going to destroy him with brute force alone, but soon enough, he may yet be undone entirely. Until then, study him. And I shall study what you found...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"By \"study him\", you mean find him again, and fight him... weaken him... distract him?\"\n Hecate : \n\"Precisely that.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Oh, by the way... something awaits you in the training grounds. You proved beyond a doubt that you're prepared.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Moros\"&gt;Moros&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hecate : \n\"One more of Nyx's kin is here for us to mind. Your incantation tracked him after all! \"Doom \"typically arrives \"un\"invited, of course.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Lord Moros is to be our guest. I know his presence must seem an ill portent, but if the Fates wanted him here, who are we to fight it?\"\n Hecate : \n\"Who, indeed.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I found him, Headmistress! My father! Chronos has him locked away in Tartarus. But, I couldn't save him... he asked I leave him be...\"\n Hecate : \n\"Truly? How utterly predictable of Chronos to gloat in such a way. I regret that your reunion with Lord Hades thus transpired... though, I am gladdened you discovered him. How does he fare?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"He... \"ungh. \"I really wouldn't know. He seemed sound of mind and body, and he knew me soon enough. Gave me what blessing he could still bestow. What can we do?\"\n Hecate : \n\"If he asked you leave him be, then 'tis evidence he wishes to remain unseen. Use full discretion and be brief, should you encounter him again; and \"I \"shall see about ensuring Chronos remains ignorant of your newfound connection.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Headmistress, I've a message from my father that he asked me to relay: He sends his deepest gratitude...\"\n Hecate : \n\"Lord Hades told you this? \"Whyever for? \"He \"rots \"in his own prison whilst the Titan ransacks his domain! My charge was to safeguard the realm and I did not.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Father spoke of when he left me in your care, when Chronos struck. He must have feared the worst. Now he knows I'm well... all thanks to you.\"\n Hecate : \n\"No, Melino\u00eb, all this is thanks to \"Chronos. \"Your father would do well to save his gratitude ere we settle certain scores. Though... speak not to him of this... undignified response. I merely was taken aback.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Of course. I understand.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"At the edge of the Mourning Fields... I faced some sort of dark, infernal beast. Three monstrous canine maws, bellowing with fury and sorrow. It was my father's... my \"family's \"old dog... wasn't it?\"\n Hecate : \n\"Through Odysseus we have a few reports about a creature fitting that description, more or less, but... Cerberus was \"red \"in hue, as blood. Nevertheless, a stay within the Fields could have transformative effects. \"Tsk\", wretched thing. Torn from its home.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"He doesn't seem to know who I am. Whether because it's been too long, or there's too much on his mind. Minds? But I felt a flash of recognition. He isn't too far gone, is he...?\"\n Hecate : \n\"The nature of a beast can never change. Like us, however, they at times must fight the daemons that torment them... a battle in which you can assist! Trust your training, and perhaps he can yet shake the spell that's overtaken him.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'm certain that he can.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hecate : \n\"You've not escaped the Mourning Fields as yet. The beast guarding the entrance into Tartarus seems insurmountable. 'Tis the effect of the Fields themselves.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"What hope I have begins to drain from me as soon as I set foot in there. I know it's just a trick of the mind, but...\"\n Hecate : \n\"...but an effective trick it is, I know.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Headmistress, Lord Zeus requested \"prompt reports\", his words, from you about the situation in the Underworld. He seemed a little frustrated. Asked me to let you know.\"\n Hecate : \n\"And you're as dutiful as ever, aren't you? Exactly as Lord Zeus wants us to be. Think you he truly cherishes these Underworld reports?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I... hadn't considered that he might not. He seems the sort to want to know about all goings-on, especially ones dangerous to him.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Correct! He grows uneasy when the silence thickens. He'll get his prompt reports; though, just remember, he already \"has \"a messenger.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Headmistress, I found Artemis out there. I'd not expected her so soon, but then, she's quick. Speaking of which, what of Hermes, any word?\"\n Hecate : \n\"Alas, not yet. However, those two are resourceful and discreet... and Olympus remains none the wiser to our long-standing connection with them, if that is your concern.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"My concern is their safety. May Hermes soon discover what exactly Chronos is scheming and return, though I know we can ill afford to wait.\"\n Hecate : \n\"No, we cannot. Hermes convinced me of that.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Hermes is back, Headmistress. He was able to lend some of his swiftness, and... also asked that I come to the aid of Olympus. Has the hour grown so desperate up there?\"\n Hecate : \n\"He would not ask otherwise. To be sure, this complicates the task. My view, however, is that you are not yet prepared for the surface. I'll not lift the wards barring that path.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"And if I were to lift them myself? I've seen you do it.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Then you'll be more prepared than you are now.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Arachne\"&gt;Arachne&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Headmistress, there must be something we can do for Arachne. Her curse torments her. What use is our craft if we cannot ease a friend's suffering?\"\n Hecate : \n\"Arachne's fate is not yours to undo. 'Tis a matter between her and Athena. I suggest you leave it well alone.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"How... did you know it was between her and Athena?\"\n Hecate : \n\"I do not care for your insinuations, Melino\u00eb.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Medea\"&gt;Medea&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'd not expected Lady Medea to be stationed in Ephyra still, Headmistress. To think even a witch of her experience was unable to prevent the city's fall.\"\n Hecate : \n\"It was not her responsibility to try. Medea was there to blend with the locals. It seems she's even more successful at it now, with most of them deceased. I trust she aided you in her own way?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"That she did, yes.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hecate : \n\"How fares Medea on the surface lately from your point of view? Having a grand old time by her account, and Sister Selene seems to think the same! Perhaps I should not be surprised.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Lady Medea does seem very much at home amid all the death and decay, which fuels her research. She's always toiling at one curse or another. Is that a concern?\"\n Hecate : \n\"My concern is only for her wellbeing, and it sounds as though she is all right for now. So long as her \"research \"does not come back to haunt her anytime soon.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'll be checking up on her.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Circe\"&gt;Circe&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I found Circe the Enchantress on my route toward Olympus; or likely, she found me. She hasn't changed a bit from what I recall. You have her keeping watch over the seas?\"\n Hecate : \n\"That I do. Selene takes to water like a cat, whilst Circe hails from the sea. Thus has it been a good arrangement for a while. I trust Circe's work retains its potency?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"She's been great.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hecate : \n\"We have a bit of a personnel problem with our Circe the Enchantress. Her isle is poised to survey our enemy's fleet, reports of which ought go directly to Odysseus. Except they go to me.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"A gap in communication. By your leave, Headmistress, I can notify her of the proper protocol when next we meet.\"\n Hecate : \n\"You shall not speak of this to her at all. I raise the point so you can be aware. Circe has long been a valuable asset and ally. Your visits to her isle may help keep it that way.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Understood.\nHide and Seek Flahsback.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Got you, Hecate!! You're dead!\"\n Hecate : \n\"\"Haha\", got me you did, Melino\u00eb. But I daresay I can escape your clutches yet!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Hey...!\"\n Hecate : \n\"\"Awooo...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Can't hide from me...!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"There you are! Got you again!\"\n Hecate : \n\"\"Aah! \"So persistent! Give up already, Witch! For I'm a Titaness! \"You \"cannot vanquish \"me!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I can, and shall!\"\nDialogue 03.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"Hahaha\", I \"got \"you!! ...Hecate...? What's the matter?\"\n Hecate : \n\"...\"Ah\", it's merely that... \"tsk\", I've not heard your laughter before. Reminded me of your mother! A much preferable sound to that of grief.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I promise not to cry again! I still get sad sometimes, but not as much...\"\n Hecate : \n\"Do not make promises you cannot keep. When tears well up, let them spill forth; they're not so precious that they need be contained.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"But you never cry, Hecate! And I wish to become strong, like you! So that I might find Chronos, and destroy him for what he's done. And then you could hear my mother's laugh again!\"\n Hecate : \n\"And I shall do everything in my power to prepare you, so that you may succeed where I failed. If not for your family's sake, then for your birthright... as the Princess of the Underworld.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"What do you mean you failed? You tried to beat Chronos yourself? He hurt you?\"\n Hecate : \n\"Concern yourself with your own pain, not mine. Destroying Chronos shall not change the past, and the pain shall linger, though assert itself less frequently with age... but enough of this! On the morrow, we shall teach you to hunt greater prey.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"&lt;Gasp&gt; \"Truly?\"\nGifts.\n&lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Headmistress, if it isn't inappropriate, I have a little gift. Seeing as your personal supply ran out a while back?\"\n Hecate : \n\"\"Ah\", the hounds shall lap this stuff right up I think! I shall safeguard it for them as a treat. And why don't you hold onto \"this\", in kind?\"\n\"Hecate gives &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Wheel\"&gt;Silver Wheel&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Your Silver Wheel? I can have this?\"\n2nd Time.\n Hecate : \n\"Oh, come, Melino\u00eb, you need not influence me with such gifts. We have a task. Let us stay focused on it, no?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You have taught me to apply myself to many things at once, Headmistress. Why can't I stay on task while paying my respects?\"\n3rd Time.\n Hecate : \n\"\"Eh\", well... I do have a bit of a taste for this stuff, I suppose. I once traveled much more often, to places where 'tis easier to procure. Perhaps you sensed in me some wistfulness about that.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I've learned from you, Headmistress. So, this is just a small token of my gratitude.\"\n4th Time.\n Hecate : \n\"Whilst I appreciate the gesture, and the drink, 'tis entirely unneeded on your part. Have I not conditioned you to resist the temptations of unspoken contracts such as this?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I know not to expect anything in return, Headmistress. The act of giving needs to be sufficiently rewarding in itself. And please believe me that it is, with you.\"\n5th Time.\n Hecate : \n\"I've little taste for the traditions of the gods, you know. Lest you forget, I am a Titaness. More in common with our enemy I daresay, than with the likes of Zeus and his ilk.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"No matter your heritage, Headmistress, you have been a sure and steady guardian of mine throughout my life. A bit of tradition helps express the gratitude I feel.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Tradition is all well and good lest 'tis followed blindly; senselessly, I should say, for the blind are often very much aware. But let me not belabor your kind gesture; I am grateful, truly.\"\n6th Time.\n Hecate : \n\"I thought I said you needn't curry favor with me thus. I shall take this bottle, nonetheless; if but to penalize you for not offering it up instead to someone more deserving of your affection.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I can think of no one else I would rather have this than you, Headmistress. You've made me the goddess I am, and not a night goes by that I'm not grateful for it.\"\n Hecate : \n\"How often must I say, I'm not your mother, Melino\u00eb. You needn't lavish me with such unbridled praise. I raised you to destroy our common foe. You owe no gratitude to me.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You've often said, what we intend and what we do are not the same. I know you're not my birthmother, so what? You've cared for me; that's more than enough.\"\n Hecate : \n\"I've used you, and I'm using you still. Can't you see that? I've attempted not to hide this fact from you. Yet you turn it aside.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You have raised me in accordance with the promises you made to my father. He never asked you to coddle me, did he? Surely he wanted me to fend for myself.\"\n Hecate : \n\"And do you think you can? You remain under my auspices, take aid from Olympus! You're not as independent as I planned. And furthermore, I've inadvertently caused you to think I've made you better off!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I believe you have. I know no other way. It fills me with sorrow, knowing you feel undeserving of the love I have for you.\"\n Hecate : \n\"...Set your sorrow well aside for now. I'll drink your Nectar and enjoy it, if you please.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I would.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Bath%20Salts\"&gt;Bath Salts&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Headmistress, I was wondering if you might accompany me to the springs for a short while? If you're not overly preoccupied?\"\n Hecate : \n\"\"Eugh\", well, I do believe I could use a bit of a soak. I've more knots in my back than that tree! Let's be quick about it, then.\"\n Hecate : \n\"\"Ah\", but this is all right. Thank you for replenishing these waters! One of those details I had been meaning to get to, but... alas.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You're very welcome, Headmistress. I appreciate your saying so, as I half-thought you would admonish me for using magick and resources on this sort of thing.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Magick mostly \"is \"for self-improvement, Melino\u00eb. Not a shortcut, mind you. And if an occasional scalding-hot soak in the springs isn't self-improvement, then my concept of it must be very flawed.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I wish I could bring myself to relax. I feel like I'm wasting precious time while I'm here.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Time spent being good to oneself is never wasted... unless you overthink it overmuch! We are \"here. \"Seize the moment, ere it passes.\"\n Hecate : \n\"A shame we cannot cook indefinitely in those springs, but... a brief dip is better than none at all.\"\n2nd Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I was thinking of putting these purifying salts to use, Headmistress. Call it a cleansing ritual. Would you accompany me?\"\n Hecate : \n\"A visit to the springs ought rid us of unwanted thoughts for a while. Let us be cleansed together, then.\"\n Hecate : \n\"\"Mm. \"We're like two nettles boiling in a cauldron, aren't we?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I remember bathing in this spring when I was very small. You would ask me never to splash your hair, and I would do it anyway. You were so tolerant of me.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Well, now at least you know the reason that your training was so rigorous! There came a point where even my vast tolerance for all your splashing finally wore thin.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Wait... you trained me to the height of my ability as a witch because I got your hair wet?\"\n Hecate : \n\"\"Mm\", was either that, or transform you into a newt, or something! Come off it, Melino\u00eb. You are entirely too serious, sometimes.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"Heh. \"A lesson I've been unable to take to heart, Headmistress. I suppose it's been a while since we talked like this.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Yes, well, that's growing up for you. And present circumstances haven't helped, either. This blasted hot-spring got all covered up with moss and had been stagnant, I don't know how long. Being here again... it takes me back.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Do you think we'll be able to keep the moss from reclaiming this place again?\"\n Hecate : \n\"I'll watch the moss, you watch the splashing. Deal?\"\n Hecate : \n\"\"Whew! \"Much better. Sometimes I think that hot-spring could raise the dead.\"\nGift Decline.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I know it's a difficult time, Headmistress, but just in case, would you be interested in joining me for a brief while at the hot springs?\"\n Hecate : \n\"As much as I would enjoy basking in the springs, I've incantations to complete, wards to reinforce... No, I cannot. Not now.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Twin%20Lures\"&gt;Twin Lures&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"The Cocytus teems with life there by the riverbank again, Headmistress. Would you please join me for a look?\"\n Hecate : \n\"\"Ah\", very well, why not! I suppose I could use a little walk, and we could use the fish.\"\n Hecate : \n\"...'Twas not very long ago that you never would have permitted yourself this type of excursion. Nor had the mettle to request that I accompany you.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Headmistress, you're right. I could be hunting for our enemy this very moment, and you... you've so many responsibilities, yet I'm wasting your time. This was a mistake.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Hold, lest you frighten the river denizens; only \"then \"should my time be wasted here, Melino\u00eb! You mistook the meaning of my words. Your capacity to still your racing mind is not a detriment. It is a growing strength!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'm... surprised you see it that way. Sometimes I feel I'm losing my focus. Why else would I have brought us here? \"\n Hecate : \n\"Perhaps you reasoned that we each need occupy our minds with other matters for a little while. And we are failing at it by continuing to speak! Let us be still together and direct our focus on the waters there.\"\n Hecate : \n\"The river always provides, and let no such task ever be beneath us.\"\nGift Decline.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Care to accompany me to the riverside?\"\n Hecate : \n\"I do wish to see firsthand whether your skill at fishing has improved, yet unfortunately I have other matters that I must attend to now.\"\n\"NPC_Hecate_01.MissingDistanceTrigger.VoiceLines\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Headmistress is away.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"No sign of Headmistress.\"\nPre-Fight Conversations.\nFirst Meeting.\nAlternative 01.\n Hecate : \n\"Welcome to the edge of Erebus. Well done, Melino\u00eb.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Thank you, Headmistress Hecate. I could not have reached this point without your guidance.\"\n Hecate : \n\"And, in turn, you shall not \"pass \"this point without a demonstration of your capability.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"My capability? You'd have us face each other here... even though my task has already begun?\"\n Hecate : \n\"Your training shall never be complete. And I would know if you stand any chance at all against our enemy.\"\nAlternative 02.\n Hecate : \n\"You reached the edge of Erebus already. You have surpassed my expectations, Melino\u00eb.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Thank you, Headmistress Hecate. For all your guidance, and the compliment.\"\n Hecate : \n\"In my place you'd have done the same. However, now is not the time for pleasantries; 'tis for a demonstration of your capability.\"\nAbout Keepsake (&lt;a href=\"Silver%20Wheel\"&gt;Silver Wheel&lt;/a&gt;).\nDialogue 01.\n Hecate : \n\"You bear the Wheel trinket I bestowed. I once used it to hone my craft. May it now help you do the same.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"This wheel, a labyrinth with no beginning and no end... pathways that circle back upon themselves. Like Erebus...\"\n Hecate : \n\"Like life itself! Three stages, intertwined. Let us go through the stages now.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hecate : \n\"Again you bear the Wheel I gave to you; rather, that I \"held \"for you ere you were ready, for it was always yours. A means of focusing your magickal acuity, if nothing else.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It's much more. A never-ending labyrinth with three distinct sides... a reminder of our home, and the limits of our power.\"\n Hecate : \n\"The Crossroads may serve as something of a home to you, but most certainly it is \"not your home. \"It is that labyrinth in which you are trapped. \"Break free!\"\nAbout Scenery.\n&lt;a href=\"Erebus\"&gt;Erebus&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"What can we do for the wretched souls wandering lost in Erebus, Headmistress? An afterlife of lashing out in impotent rage...\"\n Hecate : \n\"We can achieve our task. The souls of Erebus ought have been placed somewhere within your father's realm, but all that ceased once Chronos took the throne. Go, wrest it back from him.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"This grove is already regrown since last we clashed. For all the death in Erebus, life flourishes as well.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Death and life; the two are intricately intertwined. These woods shall easily survive our clashes here. What about \"you?\"\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hecate : \n\"\"Hmm. \"I was beginning to think you had grown so fond of the surface that you would not be coming back here anytime soon.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Our task takes me to the very ends of the earth. I have unfinished business there as well as here. I'm much more comfortable in these environs, though.\"\n Hecate : \n\"\"Comfortable? \"You should be fully on your guard, and braced for battle! Let's see how \"comfortable \"this is for both of us.\"\nAbout Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Selene\"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hecate : \n\"Sister Selene aided you in getting here to me. But have you learned to harness her power?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"On that account, I would prefer to demonstrate than speak. With your permission, of course, Headmistress.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Permission granted. Now, show me what the Moon can do once in your grasp.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hecate : \n\"How fares the goddess of the hunt? By now these woods must feel a second home to her.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Sister Artemis appears quite well, so much as possible of late. If anything, she seems in better spirits than before.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Good. She, Selene, you, and I have all prepared for this contingency, and now 'tis time we shine... particularly you and I, right now.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Does anyone besides me ever happen on you in this glade? Perhaps some evening Artemis or someone may appear instead.\"\n Hecate : \n\"This clearing, rest assured, is ours alone; these woods are vast enough. Yet I see everyone who passes through. No matter how clandestine they may think they are...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hecate : \n\"A chill swept through the air as you approached. Unseasonably cold; though perhaps it is as Demeter desires. She aids you, does she not?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"She does. She knew me for her granddaughter at once. Have you had opportunity to speak with her, about me and all that's transpired?\"\n Hecate : \n\"No; I've been a bit preoccupied. At least here, Demeter shall be able to cool her wrath against me for keeping you a secret for so long...\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hecate : \n\"I sense that Demeter is with you once again. I suspected she would either be among the first to lend support, or to refuse.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Could you not have told her about me, Headmistress? To have lost her daughter and grandchildren... I cannot imagine her sorrow.\"\n Hecate : \n\"'Twas a painful choice to leave her in the dark. She would have gone to war immediately; but our task requires patience, as you know.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Headmistress, I'm concerned Chronos may find us. I first encountered him not far beyond these woods...\"\n Hecate : \n\"There are so many passageways to Erebus, 'tis exceedingly unlikely he shall find the way. \"You \"face a greater risk than \"that \"right now...\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hecate : \n\"Our enemy's strength even exceeds my own. We're both Titans, yes, Chronos and I, but he is my elder... as I am yours. What say you?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"His age doesn't mean anything to me. The old are seldom wise, and often weak. And, he did not study under \"you\", Headmistress. Only I have.\"\n Hecate : \n\"\"Hah! \"Just so. He is an arrogant old fool. The impression of wisdom comes with age more than the real thing. Remember that.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'll get him, Headmistress. I swear it. All that you've taught, I'll bring to bear. And no matter the obstacles that stand in the way, Chronos shall fall by \"my \"hand.\"\n Hecate : \n\"I require no convincing, Melino\u00eb, although perhaps you do. However much I've taught, what's important is you're a capable student.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I have to be more than that.\"\nDialogue 04 (Won Battle).\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I've vanquished Chronos... everything you've trained me to do. Yet still you stand in my way. Still more to learn even now.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Now and always. That tinge of frustration you expressed? I would see you rid yourself of it, in your attempts to rid yourself of \"me.\"\nDialogue 05 (Won Battle).\n Hecate : \n\"Our enemy surely is beginning to wonder how you are able to thwart him. Do leave him in the dark. The less he knows of us, the better.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Chronos seems to think my family bond with him is why I'm able to resist. He hasn't made the connection that \"you're \"the one who's prepared me.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I heard from Hermes, Headmistress. He gave me the impression that Olympus needs my aid. What of my task?\"\n Hecate : \n\"Your task remains, as does the adversary whom you face. We shall discuss the matter with Hermes elsewhere. We have other matters first.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hecate : \n\"Hermes urged me to address a certain matter with you here. However, my view is you are unprepared for the surface, as of yet.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Meaning you won't lift the wards barring the path to the surface. What if I remove them myself? I've seen how you do it.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Then you'll be more prepared than you are now. Till then, remember your objective lies below. Past \"me.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Perhaps some evening I shall reach this point so quickly that I'll slip by before you arrive, Headmistress.\"\n Hecate : \n\"I've no intent to permit any such possibility, not even if you've the swiftness of Hermes speeding you on. Though, why don't we get to it, then.\"\nThe &lt;a href=\"Olympians\"&gt;Olympians&lt;/a&gt; As a Whole.\n Hecate : \n\"Olympus has emboldened you, and made you strong. Yet, 'tis a fleeting strength; one false step, and I could wipe it all away.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'll take a fleeting strength over no strength at all. We take every advantage that avails itself.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Just so. Then come and show me how you would make use of such \"advantages.\"\nMiscellaneous Conversations.\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Arcana%20Cards\"&gt;Arcana Cards&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hecate : \n\"Your aura is different. Stronger. You have been studying the Arcana. Meditating at your Altar to prepare for your attempts.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Each Card reveals to me a different strength. If I steady myself and concentrate, then it's as though I become one with whomever they depict. If only I could focus on them all.\"\n Hecate : \n\"To focus, by its nature, is to choose. Come, demonstrate to me this newfound understanding of yours...\"\nDialogue 02 (No Arcana).\n Hecate : \n\"The Altar in our training grounds is for your benefit, yet you would face me whilst ignoring the Arcana! An oversight, or bit of cheekiness?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Merely a bit of deception with which to take you off your guard, Headmistress.\"\n Hecate : \n\"\"Hah! \"I think not. I'm fully on my guard, and suggest \"you \"be on yours.\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; at Low Health.\nDialogue 01.\n Hecate : \n\"Forgive my bluntness but you're in a rather sorry-looking state, Witch. 'Tis unfair for me to fight you whilst I am at my best and you are not.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Life, however, is unfair, is it not, Headmistress? Here lies a lesson to be learned I think.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Just so. Pray you fare as capably in battle as in speech. Now commence!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hecate : \n\"You've suffered injuries, Melino\u00eb. You know that I can cure them for you, and you know that I shall not. Not here. It brings me no pleasure.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"My injuries are teachings, Headmistress. I could have been more careful getting here. Now I face the consequence.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Correct! Stand tall and fight me, then. Use well your last remaining strength.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hecate : \n\"Your wounds give me the upper hand, Melino\u00eb. What hope have you of ever finding our enemy in such a state?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I've not much hope for it at all, Headmistress. Although perhaps I'll get through \"you\", at least.\"\n Hecate : \n\"\"Perhaps\", as you say. We fight for every step, for every scrap that we can get. Get through \"me \"if you can!\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Weapons\"&gt;Weapons&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Sister%20Blades\"&gt;Sister Blades&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hecate : \n\"A flash of silver... Lim and Oros. So, the Sister Blades availed themselves to you. The other Nocturnal Arms shall follow their lead, I expect.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Nyx entrusted them to you to safeguard the realm as a last resort. But, this cannot possibly be how they were meant to be used...\"\n Hecate : \n\"And whyever not? To safeguard the realm, you shall have to clear a wide variety of obstacles standing in your way. \"I \"am but one.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Umbral%20Flames\"&gt;Umbral Flames&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hecate : \n\"I trust the dark of Erebus was not too much to handle with the ever-burning flames of Ygnium to light your path?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"No, Headmistress, it was not. Although, I've much to learn in how to wield these Flames.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Then you have come to the right place. Show me how you make the shadows dance.\"\nDialogue 02 (Aspect of Ygnium).\n Hecate : \n\"The Umbral Flames of Ygnium, at your command! You use them in your own way; not merely copy my technique.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You always said once I was ready to brandish the Flames, that I ought wield them with my intuition as my guide.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Just so. I always favored these old Flames of mine, but... as to whether \"you \"and \"yours \"truly connect, we'll have to see.\"\nDialogue 02 (Aspect of Moros).\n Hecate : \n\"Now in whose guise is Ygnium this time? If you are comfortable answering. 'Tis not \"your \"Aspect of the Umbral Flames, that much is clear.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"This Aspect is of Moros, Headmistress. But he has not yet used the Flames. Perhaps in knowing first... we become instrumental in bringing him into our fold.\"\n Hecate : \n\"'Tis how the Fates do like to operate. As soon as we know what the future holds, we may try to resist... only to stumble into bringing it about.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Moonstone%20Axe\"&gt;Moonstone Axe&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hecate : \n\"Now that's a sight, you bearing down on me with that gigantic Moonstone Axe! I wasn't certain you'd prefer that one.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Zorephet is weightier than the other Arms. But having an axe such as this in woods such as these has been convenient, overall.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Well, much as I hate to \"inconvenience \"you, I must. Although, that monstrous thing suggests this oughtn't take too long...\"\nDialogue 02 (Aspect of Charon).\n Hecate : \n\"'Tis not the typical slim figure of the Moonstone Axe. \"Ah! \"The Aspect of Charon! He has since taken up the simple oar.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Lord Charon used to wield such a thing? I scarce imagine him heaving this around. Perhaps he rowed with it.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Perhaps he did, or hewed off a few heads. If Nyx and the Three Fates entrusted the protection of the Underworld to a certain few, they could have chosen worse.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Argent%20Skull\"&gt;Argent Skull&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hecate : \n\"Using the Argent Skull of Revaal, now, are we? You're becoming a most-capable necromancer, to have earned its trust.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Was this once a living creature's skull, Headmistress? Only to be infused with silver and enchanted as an instrument of Night...\"\n Hecate : \n\"\"That \"is rather a personal question, considering all evidence at hand! Perhaps Revaal herself shall reveal to you the answer in due course.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Witch%27s%20Staff\"&gt;Witch's Staff&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01 (Aspect of Circe).\n Hecate : \n\"Your staff takes on an unexpected form. Last I saw it thus was on a distant isle in the seas above. Where the enchantress Circe plied her trade.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"This is the form Descura took with her. I feel a greater sense of calm and focus now, as though her own experience fused with mine.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Circe knew Descura's next bearer would need it for a task of some import. Thus she lent some of her strength to complement your own.\"\nThe &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal%20Arms\"&gt;Nocturnal Arms&lt;/a&gt; As a Whole.\n Hecate : \n\"What's that you're brandishing? \"Ahh\", the Nocturnal Arms begin to show their myriad colors. The silver you well know is but one.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Each of the Aspects of the Arms of Night represents a bearer from another time. I'm still learning the full extent of what they can do.\"\n Hecate : \n\"And I suspect you shall continue doing so. If nothing else, this ought to make things further interesting here for the both of us.\"\nAbout The &lt;a href=\"Animal%20Familiars\"&gt;Animal Familiars&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Animal%20Familiars\"&gt;Animal Familiars&lt;/a&gt; As a Whole.\n Hecate : \n\"There's not much glory in confronting adversaries one to one. I myself invoke Shades of the dead to alter the odds. Some may well favor \"you\", instead.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Perhaps if I brought with me a legion of animal Familiars next time, Headmistress? Not that any beast would bare its fangs at you.\"\n Hecate : \n\"You jest, yet a Familiar may be of considerable benefit given all that you have to do. A possibility to think upon, once you are rid of me...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Frinos\"&gt;Frinos&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hecate : \n\"You brought some company along! An unassuming choice; your amphibious friend does not appear to have capacity to sway the outcome here.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I never trust appearances entirely, Headmistress, and know neither do you. This must be an exciting night for Frinos.\"\n Hecate : \n\"We are not here to entertain your woodland friends, Melino\u00eb. Pray they don't get underfoot.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Toula\"&gt;Toula&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hecate : \n\"I scarce believe my eyes! I've seen that little cat about these woods. You have persuaded her to follow you...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Toula did take some convincing, Headmistress. But she seems to appreciate my company! At least, most of the time.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Moody creatures, cats; born huntresses but uncontrollable. I almost fear to see just what this little one can do! With hounds, at least I know exactly where I stand.\"\nAbout Arachne's &lt;a href=\"https%3A//hades.fandom.com/wiki/Arachne%23Silken_Fineries%3A~%3Atext%3DHades%2520II-%2CSilken%2520Fineries%2C-Outfit\"&gt;Silken Fineries&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hecate : \n\"You wear one of those silken dresses, always with a vivid hue. I know whose handiwork they are. This one quite suits you, though it is unlikely to withstand the heat...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Just have to avoid it!\"\nAbout the &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Trials\"&gt;Chaos Trials&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hecate : \n\"You've a particular objective to achieve here, haven't you? Seen what must be done within the facets of the \"Pitch-Black Stone.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"A trial, on top of a trial. This is one of the infinite possibilities that Chaos anticipated. I chose this path, but... it was already there for me to find.\"\n Hecate : \n\"'Tis very much disquieting to know the choices that we make might all be preordained to some extent. Nevertheless, Night's will is to be done.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hecate : \n\"That Pitch-Black Stone in our training grounds... I've sensed it ever since your incantation. The subtle influence of Chaos on this realm.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Our goals are intertwined. When I gaze upon the Stone, I begin to see different paths and possibilities in every facet. Some leading closer to our victory.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hecate : \n\"I sense the changes in the night; in \"you. \"Your strength has waned significantly. Chaos wishes to see the outcome of this particular arrangement, then?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Another trial, Headmistress. My magick may be weakened, but you taught me never to depend on it entirely.\"\n Hecate : \n\"And whether you took such lessons to heart, we shall imminently see. As Selene be our witness above, so shall Chaos below.\"\nAbout The &lt;a href=\"Oath%20of%20the%20Unseen\"&gt;Oath of the Unseen&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hecate : \n\"You spoke the Oath of the Unseen, and would enact Night's Testament this eve. I sensed the growing Fear. How much of it is yours?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"A healthy fear, no more, no less, Headmistress. I'm honored that you granted me the right to take the Oath. Assuming it was your doing, rather than Commander Schelemeus.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Best not to speculate too much. 'Twas your own doing most of all. Then, face me on this terror-stricken eve! You have made certain vows, and shall experience the consequence.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hecate : \n\"Decided to forgo the Oath for now? A wise move, like as not. Or, evidence of some restraint and circumspection on your part, at least.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"My path is treacherous enough as it is; why make such Vows as would reduce my chances of success?\"\n Hecate : \n\"'Tis through adversity that we grow strong! But to your point, you face adversity enough. The Oath is there to guarantee you always shall.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hecate : \n\"The Fear in the air... 'tis almost palpable tonight. You have made many Vows this eve. Feeling so very bold, or merely curious to see what shall transpire?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"A little of each, Headmistress? Perhaps I made a terrible mistake. It's fortunate the Vows contained within the Oath can be undone... unlike most vows.\"\n Hecate : \n\"\"All \"vows can be undone. But yes, the Oath is oddly forgiving in this way; its Vows, never strictly binding. Perhaps so that each evening may be interestingly different from the last.\"\nAbout Learning.\n Hecate : \n\"You cannot beat me with anxiety, you know. Still your senses, and prepare yourself. Know you the purpose of these bouts of ours?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"To complete my training. Each clash between us is an opportunity to learn and grow strong.\"\n Hecate : \n\"You're partially correct. For our training shall never be complete. Yet, onward we must strive.\"\nAbout Other's Keepsakes.\n&lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hecate : \n\"What is that foul artifact you bear? \"Ah! \"An Eye of Nemesis. Warding against those harboring ill will. The sheer irony of it, coming from her.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I mean nothing untoward, Headmistress. The Eye is indiscriminate in its effect, and makes me match more strongly with my strongest foes.\"\n Hecate : \n\"'Tis a wonder this Eye does not cause the two of us to combust on the spot! Then take your vengeance, if you can!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Odysseus\"&gt;Odysseus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hecate : \n\"Blood and darkness, I can sense you've those accursed Knuckle Bones on you. I shall have to thank Odysseus for providing such a gift...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"My Keepsake? I'm surprised these have any effect on you, Headmistress. I thought for certain you enchanted them yourself.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Odysseus has known his share of witches besides us. Well, I'm braced for impact; the Knuckle Bones strike first, and then, we fight.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Moros\"&gt;Moros&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hecate : \n\"Do I detect an artifact from Moros? Something to bring Doom swiftly to your foes by forestalling your own. Seems rather handy, that.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'm certain Lord Moros means you no offense. But his Keepsake is of benefit to me, and I'm to take every advantage that I can.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Correct. 'Tis no wonder Doom has come to stay with us for now. His presence lingers over every action that we take...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Medea\"&gt;Medea&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hecate : \n\"The air hangs heavily about you here tonight. \"Ah! \"'Tis from the scrap of something that Medea gave to you. A gift more than a curse, I trust?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Her Keepsake, yes. A bit of fleece... sheep roam about Ephyra, but none with coats as black and brilliant as this. It's something special, I can tell.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Indeed it is, as fleeces go, at least. Medea is not quick to accept others into her circle; bit of a black sheep herself. But, aren't we all?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hecate : \n\"\"Eugh...! \"Whatever foul Keepsake you decided to bring along for good fortune this eve, 'tis a horrid thing. Which sort of comrade would reward you thus?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It... was a gift from Eris, Headmistress. I know the effect isn't strictly to my benefit, or anyone's... but I just thought...\"\n Hecate : \n\"...That Eris was doing you a favor? Or has \"any \"sense of purpose other than to sow disorder where she can? You two make a strange match, Melino\u00eb. So shall \"this \"be.\"\nAbout Flattery.\n Hecate : \n\"Decided to take a break from all your recent outings to the surface, have you now?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"There's much to be done, both above and below. You always say the greatest teacher is \"out there\". But I always seem to find her here.\"\n Hecate : \n\"I taught you nothing of such flattery. One of Odysseus' tricks, perhaps! Let's see what others you have learned.\"\nAbout Failure.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You must wear that veil so as not to betray your disappointment, Headmistress. All these failures yet you still do not admonish me?\"\n Hecate : \n\"Oh silence, Melino\u00eb. For your setbacks I've boundless patience, but for your petulance, I've none. You ought find a better catalyst for such inner turmoils, as I lack sympathy for them!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"That's fine...!\"\nAbout Solitude.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I didn't mean to keep you waiting long, Headmistress. Or do you always arrive at just the right instant?\"\n Hecate : \n\"A bit of solitude here hardly is a waste of time; I never merely wait. I've more matters to attend to in these woods, besides. But \"first...\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hecate : \n\"We are alone; nary the baying of a single hound is to be heard. Selene high above shall have to be sufficient for an audience.\"\nAbout Silence.\n Hecate : \n\"'Tis a particularly quiet night. Observe the silence for a moment, ere we begin our little test of just how capable you have become.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It does seem unusually still, and the Moon wanes. An ill portent, Headmistress? Our Shades should check up on your hounds...\"\n Hecate : \n\"No need, the hounds fend mostly for themselves. Like as not, they use this time to rest; as you'd be wise to do, now and again.\"\nAbout Repeated Wins.\nDialogue 01.\n Hecate : \n\"Strength; knowledge; patience. You have exhibited the three repeatedly. Well done.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Thank you, Headmistress. Though I continue learning from our every clash.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Good, because I've no intent to stand aside. Our craft is called a \"practice \"for a reason. Now, on your guard.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hecate : \n\"You surpassed me before, yet I wonder: Was it your mastery over our craft, or did the Fates themselves perhaps provide a little \"nudge?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Come, Headmistress. If I could be provoked \"that \"easily, I'd stand no chance at all. Not even if the Fates desired otherwise.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Good fortune seldom comes to those in no position to receive it. Show me your victory was no mere accident.\"\nAbout Battle (Close Call).\n Hecate : \n\"You almost had me last we clashed, although a narrow loss is nonetheless a loss. I expect you to follow through to victory this time.\"\nAbout Battle (Missed Fight).\n Hecate : \n\"I had expected your arrival here the prior eve, but 'twas not for me to cut short that attempt. However, I shan't hesitate to cut short \"this \"one.\"\nAbout Battle (Strictly Business).\n Hecate : \n\"So much ado of late, both on Olympus and below. Yet I would have you cast all your worldly troubles aside whilst here.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"My circumstances are what spur me on. Casting them aside shall be difficult, Headmistress...\"\n Hecate : \n\"I've no concern for \"difficult\". We've time enough to gaze upon our navels at the Crossroads. Here, we are adversaries. Nothing more.\"\nAbout Testing.\n Hecate : \n\"There you are. I cannot stay for long. Just long enough to put you to the test.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I got here as quickly as I could, Headmistress. And still you had to wait.\"\n Hecate : \n\"To wait is the practice of patience. Now, on to other practices, I think.\"\nAbout Respect.\n Hecate : \n\"Set your respect for me aside whilst here. You must give no such quarter to our enemies.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"But you are not my enemy, Headmistress. How am I to treat you as one?\"\n Hecate : \n\"\"How? \"Allow me to give you a demonstration, then.\"\nAbout Expectations.\n Hecate : \n\"Much is expected of you. So you must learn to bear that burden with grace.\"\nAbout Mission.\nDialogue 01.\n Hecate : \n\"I know your task is difficult, and also know you have it in you to succeed.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hecate : \n\"Your task may be an honor, but the wisest whom you know shall not envy you for it.\"\nAbout Witchcraft.\n Hecate : \n\"Our craft leaves little room for doubt, yet some always remains; and even a little can be far too much.\"\nAbout Confidence.\n Hecate : \n\"If you lack confidence, then how are you to manifest your will? Be certain of your heart's desire.\"\nAbout Anger.\n Hecate : \n\"You're angry; let it out. Anger's not to be suppressed, nor misdirected. To be \"angry\"... is to be \"alive.\"\nDefeat.\nFirst Loss Against &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hecate : \n\"You fought with diligence and with ferocity. But surely there is more for you to learn beyond this threshold.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I look forward to it, Headmistress. What about you? Can you not join me?\"\n Hecate : \n\"No; I dare not stray too far from our abode. Continue now your task. I shall await your safe return.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Thank you, Headmistress...\"\nOther Losses.\nNo &lt;a href=\"Arcana%20Cards\"&gt;Arcana Cards&lt;/a&gt; Loss.\n Hecate : \n\"The Arcana gave to you no benefit at all this eve and still you bested me. I know not whether to heap praise, or reprimand you for being such a little show-off! \"Hah!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I've gotten stronger...\"\nGiving the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Book of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hecate : \n\"You have survived against me, and for \"that\", you're owed a gift. May you learn well through it, Melino\u00eb.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"The Book of Shadows...\"\nGiving the &lt;a href=\"Animal%20Familiars\"&gt;Animal Familiars&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cauldron\"&gt;Incantation&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hecate : \n\"Do bring an animal Familiar along next time, if but to keep things livelier for me! We have the means to keep them safe, even in scuffles such as these.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"Faith of Familiar Spirits\"... this should work on Frinos, or perhaps...\"\nGiving the &lt;a href=\"Arcana%20Cards\"&gt;Arcana Cards&lt;/a&gt; Upgrade &lt;a href=\"Cauldron\"&gt;Incantation&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hecate : \n\"You have grown physically quite strong... but spiritually, more is to be done. The Altar of Ashes; there is an incantation that may make your nightly meditations at it better spent.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"The Consecration of Ashes...\"\nGiving the &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal%20Arms\"&gt;Nocturnal Arms&lt;/a&gt; Upgrade &lt;a href=\"Cauldron\"&gt;Incantation&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hecate : \n\"To bear each of the Nocturnal Arms is a terrible responsibility. You've only begun to realize their nature; a certain incantation shall deepen your understanding.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"The Aspects of Night and Darkness...\""}

But he's very helpful to everyone and doesn't make distinctions. He's a bit reserved, elusive, and solitary, due to spending so much time isolated only in the company of his weapons and the forge fire.\nDespite being a god, he is skeptical, a practical man who prefers things done manually. He refers to Melino\u00eb as \"Little Witch\". Hephaestus stands somewhere on the side of 'science'. He despises Melino\u00eb's magic when he meets her and boasts that his weapons perform 'magic' and are superior to the powers of witches.\nAlthough he is more closed off than other &lt;a href=\"Olympian%20Gods\"&gt;Olympian Gods&lt;/a&gt; and doesn't easily open up, others might say Hephaestus acts a bit rough and without class when he interacts, but he and &lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt; are quite affectionate with each other, implying that Hephaestus's skills were one of the reasons she was attracted to him; he's very skilled with his hands.\nHe has a calm expression on his face and pretends not to care. Internally, Hephaestus is insecure and afraid of rejection, so he avoids any deeper personal involvement before it can happen, as he grew up being shunned and is bitter towards &lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; sought aid from the Olympians, Hephaestus chose to ignore the plea, reluctant to entangle himself in another familial conflict and convinced himself that it was best for all parties to handle their own affairs. However, he now acknowledges his regret for not intervening and likely sees Melino\u00eb as a chance to make amends, helping this time.\nPhysical description.\nHephaestus is portrayed as a chubby god who uses a wheelchair. He's completely naked, saved for the light blue mantle that covers his lower half. The tattoos on his arms show traditional Greek patterns, some including people in many different situations. His dark hair is tied into a bun and blends into his beard, and he uses a golden headband. His most prominent feature besides his wheelchair is his mechanical left leg. He carries a forge hammer.\nHistory.\nPast.\nHephaestus is the son of &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt;, brother of &lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;. His mother, feeling envious upon seeing the splendor of Zeus' children, &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;, tried to do the same, but instead, resulted in the birth of Hephaestus. Hephaestus grew up feeling rejected by the queen of Olympus.

Olympus, I accept this message!\"\n Hephaestus : \n\"They told me you needed a weapon or something? \"Bah! \"You already got one! Right lousy one, can spot that piss-poor workmanship from here. Though, \"erm\"... I could tune it up...\"\nKeepsake Dialogue (&lt;a href=\"Adamant%20Shard\"&gt;Adamant Shard&lt;/a&gt;).\n Hephaestus : \n\"See you still got that Adamant Shard I sent over before! Just a bit of scrap, really, but... it's a shiny one, and has some decent heft. And I can use it to pinpoint you \"quick!\"\nReactions.\nSeeing &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; at Low Health.\nDialogue 01.\n Hephaestus : \n\"You look like you've been beaten like a chunk of ore! Just keep it together long enough to appreciate my handiwork.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hephaestus : \n\"\"Eugh\", you're in shambles there, witchie. Mayhap this'll be too little too late! Could've come in handy earlier.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Well, you look plain awful right now, and that's coming from \"me! \"Though hey, you get a free weapon service with the, \"erm... \"unwelcome remark.\"\nDialogue 04.\n Hephaestus : \n\"So you took some hits along the way, so what? You're an extension of your weapon, witchie! And a decent one can take a lot of punishment.\"\nAbout Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Nothing like a good honest fight to settle a family dispute, \"eh? \"Especially productive seeing as we can't even kill each other, as old Chronos hisself can attest. \"Ah well! \"Plenty of work for me!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Right clever of old man Chronos to recruit a bunch of bitter dead against us, isn't it? We got them killed in wars and such... reckon the payback's only fair.

Then what do you need \"me \"for? Mayhap that fancy magick of yours ain't all it's cracked up to be! \"My \"work, witchie, is reliable.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Icarus\"&gt;Icarus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hephaestus : \n\"You seen that Icarus flying about? At first I took him for some giant ghostly bird, but... it's the kid of Daedalus all right! Reckon he made his latest wings hisself. He's not too bad!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hephaestus : \n\"\"Erm\", not met your dad, but... heard plenty about him. Shame, might've gotten on better with him than the rest. Likes his metals and gemstones and such as I'm to understand, so... we'd have that at least.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Been living under the auspices of the old Witch of the Crossroads, \"huh? \"Not met her face to face. Keeps to herself, so I scarce believed it when Apollo said that she'd reached out with something important. Turns out, it was \"you!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hephaestus : \n\"While back, your brother came to us for help, what's his name... \"Zagreus? \"I wasn't having it. This family's problems would disappear overnight if we could just stop getting in each other's business! Felt bad sitting it out, though...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Polyphemus\"&gt;Polyphemus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Ran into no-eyed Polyphemus, so I hear? Mean bastard, big, all meat and muscle. Could've used \"that \"one at the old forge. Ah well!

It's bloody \"war! \"Must be he's out there having a great time!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hephaestus : \n\"You've not seen Dionysus, right? Probably just getting sloshed somewhere is all. Don't like when everybody's fighting... can you blame him?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Pandora\"&gt;Pandora&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Used to be this lass Pandora who, through right mean circumstances, ended up accidentally cursing mortalkind forever more. Long story, long ago... though I still think about it now and again. Mayhap she cursed us, too...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Heard Eris got her poor wings plucked, witchie! Next make her hand over her Rail of Adamant, would you? Shoots faster than any bow I've seen! Demands a closer look...!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Daedalus\"&gt;Daedalus&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Like to think I can spot the handiwork of Daedalus, best mortal craftsman ever lived; and I \"have \"spotted it! Still keeping busy nowadays, is he? I'm sure even his work leaves bits of room for improvement here and there.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hephaestus : \n\"\"Ohh\", this is going to be a real piece of work, since Daedalus already left his mark! I'd bless that dead old busybody bastard if I could, but I can never pin him down.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Reckon my dad'll be of help in all this! Lord Zeus, he loves to help! Especially hisself... lot on the line right now, and you don't get to be the king of Olympus being coy.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hephaestus : \n\"So Mum gave you her blessing, just like \"that? \"Hard won's the favor of Queen Hera. Whilst mine... reckon it's a bit easier to come by...\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Got off on the wrong foot from the first, me and my mum. Can you blame her? Imagine seeing splendorous Apollo and Athena and so on, thinking, \"oi, I want to make me one of those! \"But instead, \"heheheh\", you make me.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hephaestus : \n\"\"Whew\", Aphrodite, she's a real force of nature, isn't she? And just about the only thing gets me to leave the forge! Not that she minds me working all the time. We've always had an understanding, I reckon!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Oi Aphrodite seems to like \"you \"quite a bit! Likes just about everybody, granted, but with you it's different. She'd never fess to it though I reckon she gets a bit lonely here, you know? Lots of acquaintances, not many friends.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hephaestus : \n\"\"Erm\", wanted to say cheers for keeping Aphrodite company, being a decent listener and all. Me? I find talk more tiresome sometimes than this here forge... but not with her. Anyway! Small thing, big help.\"\nDialogue 04.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Got to say, when we first met, I was uncertain what to make of you. Don't always trust you witchy types is all. But, if you're worthy of Aphrodite's blessing, you get the package deal.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hephaestus : \n\"\"Ahh\", Uncle Poseidon's been of some assistance, then? \"Heh! \"Reckon it's more welcome than him stomping uninvited in my forge, all sopping wet, filling the place with steam. \"Psh. \"What a kidder!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Fresh-faced Apollo got to you before me, \"eh? \"Well ain't that a surprise. He can help boost your spirit, \"I \"can boost your weapon. Tough choice om?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hestia\"&gt;Hestia&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hephaestus : \n\"When old Hestia said she liked you, 'twas all I needed to hear. The forge would be no good if not for her! She sparks the flame, I bend the metal, and \"you \"get the benefits.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hephaestus : \n\"I keep forgetting that you're Demeter's grand-kid! Can't stand being around her myself. Nothing personal, mind, I just can't get anything done when it's so blasted cold.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Haven't the faintest what Hermes is up to. Where is he? Best make hisself useful, else I'm taking back the sandals \"and \"the hat! And then we'll see how blasted quick he is!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Selene\"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Don't know if it's your silver gear or what, but for a bit there I thought I was staring at the Moon... don't much get to see the Moon in my line of work.\"\nWith Other Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Always grand whenever our Lord Zeus decides to drop by unannounced, and watch over my shoulder whilst I work my forge! Even likes to point where my hammer ought to strike. Well, Dad, where to next?\"\n Zeus : \n\"Need I remind you, my good son, that this is not, in fact, \"your \"forge, but a facility that all of us may use? And I would use it now to benefit your distant cousin over there! \"Erm\", show me how to use this thing again...\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus : \n\"If there's one good thing about this war, it's that even our most reserved family members have to rise up and make themselves known! Or just make themselves known in the case of my good son Hephaestus here, \"haha!\"\n Hephaestus : \n\"\"Ah! \"Another one of your fine jests there, Dad, and right in witchie's earshot too! Just when I thought he couldn't possibly stoop to my level, he continues to surprise.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Hephaestus : \n\"My Mum the Queen could not believe that you and I had been conversing lately, witchie. So I had to prove it to her here, you understand. Though seems she wants to be conversing in my stead...\"\n Hera : \n\"My son Hephaestus need only prove he can exude the \"confidence \"befitting a god, rather than whatever it is that he exudes instead. He's made himself useful at least, yes?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hera : \n\"I know full well we cannot stand on ceremony whilst our entire way of life is under threat! Yet surely my dear son Hephaestus here need not be so \"uncouth \"at every opportunity?\"\n Hephaestus : \n\"Not like you ever taught me proper manners, Mum. Fortunately, I did learn a couple things even without having a role model like you or Dad around to set me straight! Just \"watch\". And witchie, too!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Proud family, this one! Uncle Poseidon here forgoes full armor on account that he's too quick and too thick-headed, \"erm... \"thick-\"skinned\", I mean to say. Ain't that the case, Uncle?\"\n Poseidon : \n\"Come, Nephew, you know how much I value your craft! Even if I'd not be caught \"dead \"wearing much of it myself! It's just, only a \"coward \"goes to battle clad in plating head-to-toe; a coward far more likely to withstand his wounds, but \"still!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Poseidon : \n\"My niece, we all must tirelessly work to counteract the harm Chronos has wrought! Some even more tirelessly than the rest! Take, for instance, my nephew Hephaestus here! I told him he could have a word if he got back to hammering after!\"\n Hephaestus : \n\"See how generous our Lord Poseidon is? \"Everybody \"needs a decent uncle, I say! Let me know should you ever find one. Now... \"we \"here best get back to hammering things out.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Hephaestus : \n\"\"Oi\", witchie, was just chatting with \"Apollo \"how not all of us are gifted with good looks, and silver tongue, and all. Got to \"work \"at something to be good at it! Like he couldn't imagine!\"\n Apollo : \n\"Oh, I can more than \"imagine\", Brother. Part of being talented is making things look easy. Take you and blacksmithing! For me it's quite like \"that\", but with a bunch of \"other \"things!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Apollo : \n\"You know, Cousin, one thing you and Hephaestus have in common is you don't seem to get a lot of sun! I often try to coax him from his cave, and while I usually fail, not \"this \"time!\"\n Hephaestus : \n\"Come off it, mate, before the witchie catches on to your routine! Now make yourself useful over here, lest I stick this hammer right where \"you \"don't get a lot of sun!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Your grandnan and I, we don't usually get talking very much. But now we got something in common, witchie: \"you! \"I say you've got things well under control, but I... can't fool the likes of Lady Demeter!\"\n Demeter : \n\"Not one of us has \"got things well under control\", Granddaughter. So pay what Hephaestus said no heed! Instead use our strength combined... and Fates willing, restore for us some sense of normalcy.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Demeter : \n\"Even \"I \"could use a bit of heat on some occasions, flower, which the forge of Hephaestus here provides. Perhaps as compensation for the utter lack of \"warmth \"between most members of our family.\"\n Hephaestus : \n\"\"Ah\", just \"listen \"to the Lady Demeter! Everybody on our mountaintop thinks they're \"so sharp\", but \"this \"one? She is blunt like my hammer. And some jobs call for a blunt instrument, don't they?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Hephaestus : \n\"No point in wallowing, witchie! Whatever's going on out there, you got to love what you do, simple as that. Though don't take it from \"me! \"Got the authority right here!\"\n Aphrodite : \n\"Why, thank you, dear! We each have so much love to give. And the beauty of it is, the more of it we give, the more we \"have! \"To think that such a \"precious \"thing can have a limitless supply!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Aphrodite : \n\"It pains me to admit there are occasions when love is not the answer, and a bit of sharpened metal can much sooner do the trick. In such matters, my Hephaestus can be of assistance, can't you, dear?\"\n Hephaestus : \n\"For you, Aph? \"Anytime. \"And as for witchie here, \"most \"of the time! Now come \"on. \"Even when the situation calls for sharpened metal, you know how to get the point across!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hestia\"&gt;Hestia&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Hephaestus : \n\"The mortals, they like giving thanks to us, but what are \"we \"supposed to do, you know? Well, I just do the same. Give thanks to Lady Hestia, at least! For keeping my forge burning hot. She even visits me now and again!\"\n Hestia : \n\"Well, that's because I \"like \"it here, my lad! In spite of all the clanging and whatnot, it's \"peaceful\", more or less. And you're not such bad company to keep. Though, why don't we show your cousin what we can cobble up \"together?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hestia : \n\"If there's one thing I learned from my strong-armed nephew here, dearie, it's that you always have to strike while the iron's still hot. Now \"come \"on, \"hop \"to it, Hephaestus my lad!\"\n Hephaestus : \n\"I'm hoppin', I'm hoppin', Lady, \"augh! \"Though if you keep on turning up the heat in here, then this whole \"forge \"is going to blow, and take the rest of the damn mountain with it, \"too! \"And what would witchie have to fight for then?\"\nAbouth the Scenery.\n&lt;a href=\"Oceanus\"&gt;Oceanus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Where'd you get off to, witchie? The Underworld's gutter from the looks of it, all cold and wet... piss-poor working conditions, that much is clear.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Mourning\"&gt;Fields of Mourning&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Supposedly you're passing through the Mourning Fields along your way down there? Glad \"I \"ain't never seen a place like that. Misery's like smoke, gets in your eyes and such... hard to shake off!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Tartarus/Hades%20II\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Wonder what Chronos did to Tartarus? Was quite the architectural feat under your mum and dad! But the Titan hasn't got any taste. Probably turned everything to gold...\"\n&lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades/Hades%20II\"&gt;Fallen House of Hades&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hephaestus : \n\"While back, made your mum and dad bit of a housewarming gift, guess you could say. Scale model of Dad's palace here, for you Underworld lot to remember us by! That Chronos better not have scrapped the thing...\"\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hephaestus : \n\"\"Oi! \"What are you doing on \"this \"side, you lose your way? Thought you had business in the Underworld, not here. Mayhap I'm just a bit out of the loop is all... you need this stuff or not?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hephaestus : \n\"I heard the latest, witchie, that you're headed for our mountain tippy-top! Just don't expect warm welcomes when you get here, as we are a... a bit preoccupied right now?\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Welcome to the fine city of Ephyra, witchie! Most important thing to know is, whatever happens to you there, \"I \"cannot be held liable. I work weapons, not miracles...\"\nDialogue 04.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Ain't you not supposed to be able to breathe up here or something? Well, what can you do but push on through, is what I say! Ain't always easy but we manage or we try.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Thessaly\"&gt;Rift of Thessaly&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hephaestus : \n\"See all those Chronos ships trudging this way, witchie? Most of 'em already sunk before, however many times. They and their dead crews keep coming back to haunt us! Now that's some dedicated service, \"eh?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Mount Olympus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Oi, you made it all the way up to the mountain earlier? I'd give you a tour of the old forge next time, it's just... it's sealed up. Damn near impossible to find! Security's sake.\"\nMiscellaneous Conversations.\nOffering Boon at The Start of a Run (Any).\nDialogue 01.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Had an opening come up in my schedule, so I figured why not get your gear back to better-than-new condition right from the start?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Oi, wanted to catch you right on your way out! Got a special this evening: free tune-ups for secret silver weapons, if you got one there?\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Fine evening to you, witchie! My work ain't quick, but sometimes \"I \"can be. And here I thought, why don't I join her from the get-go, \"eh? \"Can't hurt!\"\nDialogue 04.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Where do you think \"you're \"off to, \"eh? \"Best not head out against \"impossible \"odds whilst \"unprepared! \"So, here. Let's get you suited up right quick.\"\nOffering Boon at The Start of a Run (&lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt;).\n Hephaestus : \n\"Off to pay us all a visit then, or try? Reckon you're liable to get into a \"tussle \"or two on the way, but... I can offer a \"complete \"protection plan against that sort of thing!\"\nBuying Boon at &lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;'s Shop.\nDialogue 01.\n Hephaestus : \n\"That Gold you used to pay for this... \"hoh\", it's shiny-looking, sure. But blasted soft as metal goes! Cannot make halfway decent armaments with it, I've tried!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Your Boatman over there? He's one of my best customers, you know! Shows up reliably, knows how to keep his mouth shut, all business, no nonsense.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Normally my work fetches a hefty price, but... you're entitled to the family discount! Though Charon there does take a service fee, you understand.\"\nDialogue 04.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Keep getting shipments of those golden Chronos coins! I melt 'em down, and dump the goop into the Earth from whence it came. So Chronos can make more!\"\nDialogue 05.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Having to pay for blessings strikes me as a bit \"crass! \"The favor of the gods only for the deepest pockets? \"Oi! \"You don't even \"have \"pockets.\"\nAbout Forge.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Dark times of late, witchie, but what can you do? Tell you what \"I \"can do: I can sit here sweating over my forge, clanging away at armaments and such. So blasted hot and loud in here, nobody dares disturb my work. Ain't bad!\"\nAbout Family.\nDialogue 01.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Never knew your family, \"eh? \"Better off if you ask me. Though you... didn't ask me. Probably wouldn't even if you could, and I'm also keenly aware you're expecting my services not my opinions, so, \"erm\"... here.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hephaestus : \n\"My mum and dad, they don't get on too good. But once in a long while, there's a spark between 'em, and they're like a proper king and queen again. The envy of all gods! Lately, though, they're mostly panicking.\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Olympians\"&gt;Olympians&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Right clever of old man Chronos to recruit a bunch of bitter dead against us, isn't it? We got them killed in wars and such... reckon the payback's only fair. More chances for my handiwork to shine!\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt; Threats.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Don't know what's been with all the rumbling of late, but it ain't Poseidon, and it ain't my forge. Probably something bad! But, I ain't sweating it till I know what it is.\"\nAbout Weapons.\nDialogue 01.\n Hephaestus : \n\"\"Oi\", I take back \"everything \"I said about your weapon first we met. In my defense, ain't often I see workmanship superior to mine! Though, don't go telling anyone I said as much...\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Wracked my brain about those fancy silver weapons of yours, trying to sort out who exactly could have made such things... or when? They're the Nocturnal Arms, ain't they? Meant only as a last resort! But here we are, I reckon.\"\nDialogue 03 (&lt;a href=\"Witch%27s%20Staff\"&gt;Witch's Staff&lt;/a&gt;).\n Hephaestus : \n\"So that's the Staff of Dusk, is it? Descura, that's her name! Forged who-only-knows-how-deep within the Earth under the watchful eye of Night... something like that.\"\nDialogue 04 (&lt;a href=\"Sister%20Blades\"&gt;Sister Blades&lt;/a&gt;).\n Hephaestus : \n\"You got the Sister Blades of Lim and Oros, huh? Delicate-looking but damn near indestructible. Light as a feather, too. This is going to be a treat!\"\nDialogue 05 (&lt;a href=\"Umbral%20Flames\"&gt;Umbral Flames&lt;/a&gt;).\n Hephaestus : \n\"Hold on, that's Ygnium you've got! The Flames of the Crossroads Witch! What, has the student become the master or somesuch, or is she just getting you to do all the dirty work?\"\nDialogue 06 (&lt;a href=\"Moonstone%20Axe\"&gt;Moonstone Axe&lt;/a&gt;).\nDialogue 01.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Oi, that is Zorephet the Moonstone Axe, all right! Though not expected ever to lay eyes on it. Some mortals worship the labrys, you know? Here! Let's give 'em something to believe in.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Never got why some mortals prefer axes with a single blade. Why settle for one? Twice the blades, twice the benefits, I say! No downside. In fact, I've been developing a \"triple\"-bladed axe! Still needs a bit of time to bake, but, \"erm\", anyway...\"\nDialogue 07 (&lt;a href=\"Argent%20Skull\"&gt;Argent Skull&lt;/a&gt;).\n Hephaestus : \n\"All right, that's called Revaal, I think, that skull you got? Ain't exactly my mental picture of a weapon, liable to give me night terrors in fact, but... then I'll be the first to say, \"whatever works!\"\nDialogue 08 (Aspects).\n Hephaestus : \n\"Now hold on, that another weapon you got...? \"Ahh, right\", the Nocturnal Arms and their shape-shifting tricks. Figures! You witches \"like \"changing things about, as I'm to understand.\"\nAbout Silver.\n Hephaestus : \n\"\"Say\", where'd you get that silver armor you've got on? Much finer work than first I thought. Not too much coverage, mind, but you seem more the sort that likes to freely move about. Always a trade-off to be made!\"\nAbout Legendary Boon.\nDialogue 01.\n Hephaestus : \n\"...You wouldn't know it, witchie, but I'm mad this evening. Nothing you did, mind! Fortunately, when I'm mad, I do good work.

But I \"can \"guarantee you're getting the very best.\"\nAbout Relationships.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Got off on the wrong foot from the first, me and my mum. Can you blame her? Imagine seeing splendorous Apollo and Athena and so on, thinking, \"oi, I want to make me one of those! \"But instead, \"heheheh\", you make me.\"\nAbout Parents.\n Hephaestus : \n\"No telling how many cousins I got, but you're another, \"eh? \"You're getting special treatment only 'cause my mum and dad, they asked me real nice. Don't mind the extra work!\"\nAbout Mortals.\nDialogue 01.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Those mortals, they sure got it rough of late. Sometimes I think there's just so blasted many of them now. More suffering and such! \"Eh\", reckon that's life! Don't get any say in being born, then do what we can.\nDialogue 02.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Oi what I said before, 'bout more mortals begetting more suffering and the like? Aphrodite, she reminded me there's more to it than that. And maybe she's right. It's just, I reckon the bad in things is easier to spot...\"\nAbout Volcanoes.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Feel any tremors, they are probably Uncle Poseidon shaking up the place. Though there \"are \"times it's me! When Earth herself gets angry with the state of things, I give 'er a good outlet to let off a little steam.\"\nAbout Practice.\n Hephaestus : \n\"This lot up here act like they all was born with all the talent in the world! Mayhap Apollo and Athena, sure, and Artemis, and Hermes... Aphrodite definitely, too, but, \"erm... point is! \"Most of us, we got to \"work \"at things before \"we're \"any good.\"\nAbout Legs.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Must like to run about don't you? Me, at this point I would rather sit. And so I do! Won't find a better set of legs than this anyplace besides on Aphrodite herself! Yet even still.\"\nAbout Backstory.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Must think I got it all up here, don't you? Well you'd be right! But let's just say you're not the only one who had to learn things the hard way, witchie. I needed to do what I do.\"\nAbout Automatons.\n Hephaestus : \n\"All this warring, bit concerned I'll end up typecast as a weaponsmith! I make a lot of things, you know! Jewelry, fancy chairs, walking automatons even! Though lately, it's all weapons, all the time...\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; Cleating A Run (Underworld).\nDialogue 01.\n Hephaestus : \n\"\"Ohh, there \"you are! We'd lost you for a bit! Must have gone so deep, we couldn't spy on you no more. Well, you've still got your arms and legs! Must have turned out all right.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hephaestus : \n\"Am I to understand you gave a certain \"Titan \"a right thorough walloping of late? Mayhap I helped in my own way?

Call it a trade.\"\n\"Hephaestus gives &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Adamant%20Shard\"&gt;Adamant Shard&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'm in your debt for this, Hephaestus sir.\"\n2nd Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"For you, mighty Hephaestus! Though, you may not have occasion for such offerings, working a hot forge every night and day...\"\n Hephaestus : \n\"Oi, this is just a service job, no need to get all cordial and the like. Nice gesture from you, though. So cheers and all.\"\n3rd Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Great Hephaestus! Your work is beyond compare, and I'm grateful for your candor with me as well. Please, take this offering.\"\n Hephaestus : \n\"Anytime I get an offering it's 'cause somebody wants something from me. You're already getting premium service, but hey, it's your Nectar! Well, mine now I reckon.\"\n4th Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Lord Hephaestus, you're so much more than your ingenious craft.

Despite Apollo's persistent attempts to draw him out of his cave, Hephaestus remains resolute in his seclusion.

Known for his critical eye, he often scrutinizes the weaponry Melinoe wields, pointing out flaws and commenting on their imperfect craftsmanship. Initially reserved, Hephaestus keeps his distance; he harbors a disdain for magic, favoring manual craftsmanship, which occasionally earns Melino\u00eb the nickname \"little witch.\"\nOver time, Hephaestus begins to realize that she isn't like her other relatives. He sees Melino\u00eb's unique qualities, recognizing her genuine desire to help others without prying too much into their lives. Gradually, he opens up to her, sharing his insecurities about his artistry and family. When Melino\u00eb's brother, Zagreus, sought his aid, Hephaestus hesitated, unwilling to entangle himself in another family dispute. Yet, he later regrets his decision and chooses to assist Melinoe, seeking personal redemption for his past actions concerning Zagreus.\nZagreus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;: Hephaestus's cousin.&lt;br&gt;Hephaestus didn't come to his aid in the first game, but it's implied that they met later. He seems to find Zagreus naive for thinking that the problems of their families would vanish overnight. Hephaestus recalls when Zagreus sought help from his family; at that time, he didn't assist as he was tired of family dramas and intrusions. Later, he felt guilty for staying out of it, indicating that perhaps Zagreus was worth considering, just like Melino\u00eb.\nThe Titans.\nChronos.\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;: Hephaestus's paternal grandfather.&lt;br&gt;"}

Hera seems to despise those beneath her, she looks with little animosity, and only helps Melinoe because she doesn't have many options.\nParticularly discontent with her tiresome married life due to her &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;husband&lt;/a&gt;'s constant escapades, Hera maintains a cynical view. Despite her pride and irony, she never admits her dissatisfaction. She sarcastically refers to herself and her husband as \"ideal models.\"\nKnown for her vengeful nature, Hera is not a loving stepmother, evident in her pursuit of Zeus's illegitimate children, like &lt;a href=\"Heracles\"&gt;Heracles&lt;/a&gt; and his enduring trials.

However, her sighs and interactions suggest regret, especially regarding the strained relationship with her son. She gradually develops affection for Melino\u00eb, seeing her as the daughter she never had.\nPhysical description.\nHera appears as an imposing and beautiful woman with a dark complexion. She has light bluish hair framing her face and part of it is held high by a golden helmet. A feathery mantle falls from her head, with tons of greens and blues. Her eyes are violet, she wears golden hoop earrings and her nails are dark blue. She wears a teal dress with green peacock feathers for a pattern with an opening that leaves her leg exposed, on top of it a golden breastplate, and around the breasts it resembles feathers. Her neck is covered in dark green fabric with a golden infinite loop on the centre, also resembling wedding rings; it's further held together and decorated with golden plates shaped like feathers on the side. Her shoulders are covered in the same material as her dress, however resembling a plummage even more. She wears golden bracelets on both her wrists and an armband on her right forearm. Finally, she carries a scepter, one of her symbols, itself shaped like two intercepted wedding rings, further decoarted with loose bluish green fabric on the top and a floating green orb on the bottom circle.\nHistory.\nPast.\nHera is the daughter of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Titans\"&gt;titans&lt;/a&gt; Hyperion and Theia, and sister of &lt;a href=\"Hestia\"&gt;Hestia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Selene\"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eos\"&gt;Eos&lt;/a&gt;.

During the war she wielded &lt;a href=\"Coronacht\"&gt;Coronacht&lt;/a&gt;. After the war, Hera married Zeus and together they became the rulers of Olympus and its residents.

Olympus, I accept this message!\"\"\n Hera : \n\"Pleased to make your acquaintance finally, my dear! Already had enough of the surface, yes? \"Heh\", well I promised the family that once you demonstrated your resolve to us, I'd take you under my wing. And I \"always \"keep my vows.\"\nDialogue 02 (Boon Dialogue).\n Hera : \n\"Pleased to make your acquaintance finally, my dear! Welcome to our world's surface, such as it is. I promised the family that once you demonstrated your resolve to us, then I'd take you under my wing... and, I \"always \"keep my vows.\"\nReactions.\nSeeing &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; at Low Health.\nDialogue 01.\n Hera : \n\"\"Oh! \"You're a frightful mess, if you'll forgive my saying, girl! I can't help you when you're practically dead! At least, not very much.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hera : \n\"What happened to all your lifeblood? That's precious stuff! Yet you've gone spilling it about, then have the \"nerve \"to thus present yourself to me.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hera : \n\"However much you've trained, it evidently was not \"nearly \"enough, if you've \"already \"taken such a \"beating \"before I can even begin to protect you!\"\nDialogue 04.\n Hera : \n\"Not having a good night...? Your injuries will heal eventually, my dear. But, I can't make any promises about your pride.\"\nAbout Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hera : \n\"Remember, girl, this world is ours by right. The Fates themselves decided it! Now Chronos seeks to overthrow our reign? He already had his opportunity to rule. There is no going back to how things were.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hera : \n\"The Titan Chronos is no father of mine. But \"your \"father sprang from him, as did my husband, and Poseidon as well. So, now we're all tied up in this little family affair!\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hera : \n\"Would that I could put another arrow in between the eyes of Chronos again myself, but alas, you're closer and I'm stuck. Kill him for me, would you?\"\nDialogue 04.\n Hera : \n\"This matter with Chronos, it may seem unconscionable that a parent could resent their own children. But let me tell you, girl, there are moments when I \"almost \"sympathize.\"\nDialogue 05.\n Hera : \n\"I always knew Chronos would return. Zeus kept saying I was fearful over nothing! We buried the old wretch in the depths of Tartarus, after all. But he's a deathless Titan. \"Time\", it seems, slipped through our fingers...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Fates\"&gt;The Fates&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hera : \n\"The Fates are gone, then, yes? According to Hermes? Quite the unfortunate turn of events if true. Well, if Chronos is bent on vengeance, it only makes sense that he would take it out on \"them\", not just on \"us.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hera : \n\"\"Ah\", your poor father. You must have been the jewel in his eye, only to have been ripped away! He would have been so very proud. Well, perhaps not \"proud\", as such.

Her temper and my own don't often mesh, but I respect her wisdom, and her power to simply burn everything down if and when necessary.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hera : \n\"Cold vengeance...

My Lord Husband knows this better than anyone, don't you, Zeus?\"\n Zeus : \n\"You're quite right, Dear, that marriage can most certainly begin to feel like work! It was so easy for us in the early days, but our responsibilities have grown since, haven't they?\"\nDialogue 03.\n Zeus : \n\"My command of the heavens is nothing compared to the strength of our family bond!

I daresay we're well past due for a break.

But then, more goddesses ought better understand the need to keep appearances even in troubled times... \"especially \"in troubled times.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Hera : \n\"A shame you never knew your father, girl... but at least now you know his good brother Poseidon, here!

For even in the face of such catastrophe as we have all endured, the Queen herself is able to make such humorous remarks! At my expense.

Perhaps when all of this is over, you may resume your search in earnest! But until such time, get your mind out of the gutter.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Hera : \n\"I fear for the younger generation. What can you possibly achieve when you're born with our worst qualities and not merely our best? Take good Apollo here... just like his father.\"\n Apollo : \n\"Now, Stepmother, don't all we gods aspire to your husband's excellence? I do appreciate the kind comparison!

One \"can \"be as strong as a rock, without taking on its texture.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hephaestus\"&gt;Hephaestus&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Hera : \n\"I know full well we cannot stand on ceremony whilst our entire way of life is under threat! Yet surely my dear son Hephaestus here need not be so \"uncouth \"at every opportunity?\"\n Hephaestus : \n\"Not like you ever taught me proper manners, Mum. Fortunately, I did learn a couple things even without having a role model like you or Dad around to set me straight! Just \"watch\". And witchie, too!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hephaestus : \n\"My Mum the Queen could not believe that you and I had been conversing lately, witchie. So I had to prove it to her here, you understand. Though seems she wants to be conversing in my stead...\"\n Hera : \n\"My son Hephaestus need only prove he can exude the \"confidence \"befitting a god, rather than whatever it is that he exudes instead. He's made himself useful at least, yes?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hestia\"&gt;Hestia&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Hera : \n\"We goddesses can be too proud to beg for aid! I'd never stoop to it myself. Why bother, when my hard-headed sister Hestia shall insist on intervening, anyway? And at this very moment \"whilst I speak!\"\n Hestia : \n\"Because, respectfully, you just don't know what's \"good \"for you, O Queen! Sometimes it's ones can't bring themselves to ask for help that need it \"most! \"Now why don't we set a \"proper \"example for the latest unceremonious addition to our family?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hestia : \n\"Not always big on family business, though I take exception for my little sis. She of all goddesses has to put up with the most around here, and that's not even counting all this Chronos stuff. How do you manage it, \"O Queen?\"\n Hera : \n\"I manage it one evening at a time is how, Sister! Perhaps we shall have to burn the old world down and start anew, but... I can think of \"none \"more suited, should the need arise.\"\nAbouth the Scenery.\n&lt;a href=\"Oceanus\"&gt;Oceanus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hera : \n\"\"Eugh\", I can barely reach you as it is within that murk, and you seem even farther away now. The very outskirts of your father's realm, is it? That's... not the customary path into the Underworld...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Mourning\"&gt;Fields of Mourning&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hera : \n\"You've seen the Mourning Fields within your Underworld, yes? A solid portion of the residents are there due to failed marriages, most typically their own. I bless each matrimony that I can, but it can only do so much.\"\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hera : \n\"Welcome, my dear, to our world's surface! First time? It's a vast place! All sorts of different climates, mortal cultures, and the like. So don't let your first impression shake your faith; it isn't always such a disaster!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hera : \n\"Mortals complained their city of Ephyra was forsaken by the gods, yet here we are! Ungrateful wretches. Not had many weddings of late. Not many funerals either... though, lots of death, destruction, and the like!\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hera : \n\"There are many potent reagents growing on the surface here, if you know where to look! Mere roots and flowers to the untrained eye, but in your hands, or better, in your cauldron?

The very idea is absurd; yet, there you are, paying for goods and services as though Chronos has already prevailed!\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hera : \n\"We cannot always reach you in those depths, though your boatman seems to have no trouble at all. Keeps to himself, fends for himself... I quite like him!\"\nDialogue 04.\n Hera : \n\"At least this was a shorter delivery for your trusted boatman, compared with having to drag our Boons all the way into the Underworld. Although, he probably prefers it there...\"\nAbout Route Choice.\n Hera : \n\"My husband Zeus and I have \"spirited \"debates regarding how you may ensure our victory. He is too proud to seek your help here on our mountaintop, whilst I would welcome it with open arms, so... come along!\"\nAbout Meeting.\n Hera : \n\"\"Ah! \"There you are \"again\", my dear! Pity to have only met in circumstances such as these. Yet families all go through their ups and downs, yes? Let me help you help us all.\"\nAbout Mission.\n Hera : \n\"To level with you, girl, I don't know that you've got what it takes to thwart the Titan. But, what choice do we have at this point? I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt.\"\nAbout Family.\n Hera : \n\"This is hardly the first time I've been pressed to intervene on \"your \"side of the family's behalf. I've stood my ground! We cannot keep getting involved in each other's affairs. Yet, if you've come to our defense, you're owed an exception...\"\nAbout Children.\nDialogue 01.\n Hera : \n\"Oh, the blessings that my kin and I bestow, why... they're a bit like children, I suppose. You don't always get the kind you want, but if you're clever, you can make them work!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hera : \n\"I always wanted a little girl, you know? But I got Ares. Hephaestus. \"Eugh! \"Zeus' girls Athena and Artemis stay well afield of me, and Aphrodite, oh, she does what she wants. Some family we are.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hera : \n\"Our great big family, why, we would have been just a small fraction of the size, if not for my husband's escapades! So many delightful children in my life as a result.\"\nAbout Eternity.\n Hera : \n\"One thing I've learned, my dear, is that \"forever \"is a very long time. It seems to me that nothing \"truly \"lasts forever anymore. Perhaps that is why we find ourselves in this particular predicament.\"\nAbout Mortals.\nDialogue 01.\n Hera : \n\"We had an obligation to your father here. Each mortal death adds to the population of the Underworld, after all! I tried to do my blasted part to curb the flow a bit. Have you any idea how onerous it is for mortals to give birth?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hera : \n\"If ever you wondered whence came all the \"wretches \"in your Underworld, there are such mortals who see it as \"our \"responsibility to protect \"them! \"Can you believe it?\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hera : \n\"I hardly blame them but \"some \"mortals have grown skeptical about our governance. They have this newfangled idea of \"luck... \"strokes of fortune from thin air! Sheer \"mindless \"happenstance, not the work of gods or the Three Fates.\"\nAbout Witchcraft.\n Hera : \n\"I know something of witchcraft myself, girl. A subtle art, and therein lies its strength. Easy to disbelieve, or to dismiss as mere coincidence. But true power need not assert itself.\"\nAbout Reputation.\n Hera : \n\"We might not care for it but there's a certain power to being underestimated constantly. Right, girl? Let them think what they want; my blessings aren't merely for couples about to tie the knot. \"\nAbout Survival on &lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hera : \n\"They said you weren't cut out for being aboveground! Some Underworld curse holding you back... I'd not believed the hearsay for a moment, and sure enough. Perhaps they merely fear your potential.\"\nAbout Relationships.\n Hera : \n\"Aphrodite has quite gleefully informed me that \"you \"and certain friends of yours have grown quite close. Well if one thing leads to another and you decide to make a serious commitment, I should be \"only \"too pleased to oblige!\"\nAbout Marriage.\n Hera : \n\"I realize this may seem odd coming from me, my dear, but from one goddess to another: Do not rush into marriage! As much as it may seem a wondrous idea. Consider my example; and I'm the blasted goddess of marriage, herself!\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; Completing A Run (&lt;a href=\"The%20Underworld\"&gt;The Underworld&lt;/a&gt;).\n Hera : \n\"We saw reports suggesting that you made it to the lowest depths! I thought perhaps you had prevailed... though, not yet, it seems. A sign of progress, nonetheless! Press on.\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; Completing A Run (&lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt;).\n Hera : \n\"You came closer than ever to our mountaintop! I hoped, perhaps, that we could meet at last, but... we've more pressing matters to attend to now, the both of us.\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Gods\"&gt;Trial of the Gods&lt;/a&gt; (Previous Rejection).\n Hera : \n\"The other night, given the opportunity, you sided with my kin, forgoing my Boon when I first generously offered it. Whilst that little scuffle is behind us, I do \"not \"appreciate any such slights. I trust I've made myself quite clear?\"\nPost-Gift Lines.\nDialogue 01.\n Hera : \n\"How fare you in your task of late, my dear? Much better than we fare up here, I hope. Oh, all of us are fine, except... being besieged does mean we're stuck in closer quarters than I'd like. There's not a moment's peace!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hera : \n\"Take it from me, my dear, don't listen to your heart. I know it's difficult, seeing as the blasted thing tends to be very loud. But if you heed it, it'll lead you straight to your mistakes more often than not.\"\nAbout Polymorph.\n Hera : \n\"You know the Twilight Curse, oh I can tell. The power to change a form into another! A favorite of mine, and one small step removed from shapeshifting oneself. The possibilities are limitless, really.\"\nAbout Bows.\n Hera : \n\"You seem adept at keeping distance from your foes. I once excelled at this myself, although I favored an arrow through the heart over magick, which I found rather unreliable! But, whatever works for you.\"\nGifts.\n&lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Queen Hera, out of all the matters you could be attending to, you've chosen to aid me. I am honored, and would honor you in kind.\"\n Hera : \n\"Is there a wedding date that I should know about or are you merely being generous with me? In any case, when I am offered to, there's always a catch. So, here!\"\n\"Hera gives &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Iridescent%20Fan\"&gt;Iridescent Fan&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You truly needn't have, Your Majesty.\"\n2nd Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Great Queen of Olympus! I am humbled to have earned your favor, and will do everything I can to honor you!\"\n Hera : \n\"Unbound by wedlock yet you praise me thus? I must say you are full of surprises, my dear. Or potentially just very ignorant. Or both!\"\n3rd Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"This golden Nectar is nothing in comparison to your splendor, Queen Hera; but it's the very best we have where I am from. To your eternal beauty, grace, and wisdom!\"\n Hera : \n\"You needn't be a flatterer, you know? I aid you not from love but from necessity. If there's a lesson I can impart, it's that you ought to keep your guard up at all times.\"\n4th Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"To the Queen of Olympus! Long may you reign, and may that reign be one of great prosperity and peace, both for your devoted family and subjects, and for you!\"\n Hera : \n\"Go on, girl. We each know I'm not really your Queen. You're not even an Olympian, so why don't you drop the act? Or if it's not an act, wise up. This is a complicated world.\""}

She is the queen, and they constitute a dysfunctional family.\nZeus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;: Hera's husband.&lt;br&gt;Hera and Zeus united to defeat Cronos together, and from there, a spark ignited between them. They fell in love and married, with Hera assuming the role of queen of the gods. Despite her status as a goddess of marriage, her wedded life is far from idyllic due to her husband's constant infidelities. Hera's frustration with Zeus is palpable; she has lost count of his transgressions and is weary of his cynical attitude towards them. Despite her weariness, Hera remains committed to their marriage, sacrificing much for its stability and proving herself to be a faithful and devoted spouse unlike Zeus.\nThe strain in their relationship is a central theme in many of Hera's blessings, and their tumultuous marriage is symbolized in her unique Duo Boon, \"King/Queen's Ransom.\" In this boon, players must choose between sacrificing all their blessings from Zeus to enhance each of their blessings from Hera, or his husband.\nAlthough it is implied that Hera keeps Zeus in line with a steely gaze, she is also known for her harsh treatment of her stepchildren, a behavior that cannot be excused. Nevertheless, her resentment towards Zeus is understandable given the circumstances. Yet, despite the trials they face, the love between them remains unwavering. They are regarded as soulmates, and if Zeus remains married, it is because he and Hera are in sync in their shared struggles and triumphs.\nAres.\n&lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;: Hera's son.&lt;br&gt;\nHephaestus.\n&lt;a href=\"Hephaestus\"&gt;Hephaestus&lt;/a&gt;: Hera's son.&lt;br&gt;Hera doesn't have as good a relationship with her son Hephaestus. His birth stemmed from Hera's jealousy of Zeus's other children, wishing for someone more akin to Apollo or Athena. She expresses disdain for how \"crude\" and lacking in manners he is, while Hephaestus sarcastically describes her and Zeus as \"proper role models\" who never made an effort to teach him good manners.\nHestia.\n&lt;a href=\"Hestia\"&gt;Hestia&lt;/a&gt;: Hera's older sister.&lt;br&gt;Hera has a rather tense relationship with her older sister, often referring to her as 'hard-headed' and expressing irritation when Hestia interrupts her. However, she does respect Hestia's wisdom and fire powers.\nDemeter.\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;: Hera's older sister.&lt;br&gt;\nPoseidon.\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;: Hera's foster brother and brother-in-law.&lt;br&gt;Hera fought alongside Poseidon in the Titanomachy.\nAthena.\n&lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;: Hera's stepdaughter.&lt;br&gt;Hera has mentioned that Athena prefers to keep her distance from her.\nArtemis.\n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;: Hera's stepdaughter.&lt;br&gt;\nApollo.\n&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;: Hera's stepson.&lt;br&gt;She doesn't harbor much fondness for her stepson Apollo, but she does recognize his social adeptness. During her conversation with Duo Boon, she mentions that Apollo seems to have inherited both the best and worst traits from his father Zeus. Apollo, taking her words as a compliment, suggests that he shares many similarities with his \"esteemed father,\" and reassures Melino\u00eb that he must have inherited Zeus's finest characteristics.\nHermes.\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;: Hera's stepson.&lt;br&gt;\nDionysus.\n&lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;: Hera's Stepson.&lt;br&gt;\nAphrodite.\n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;: Hera's daughter-in-law.&lt;br&gt;\nChthonic Gods.\nThe gods of the underworld, most of whom the Olympians seem to despise, including she.\nHades.\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;: Hera's foster brother and brother-in-law.&lt;br&gt;Hera fought alongside Hades in the Titanomachy.\nMelino\u00eb.\n&lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;: Hera's grandniece.&lt;br&gt;In her initial presentation, Hera is very polite, welcoming Melino\u00eb when she reaches the surface. She helps Melino\u00eb, but not willingly like other gods, only because she promised the family protection if Melino\u00eb showed determination. Hera never breaks her vows. Initially, she doesn't even maintain a facade of civility towards Melino\u00eb and clearly only helps her because she doesn't have many other options. Even gifting her nectar doesn't make Hera warmer towards Melino\u00eb. Instead of gratitude, Hera tells Melino\u00eb to drop \"the act,\" as she's not even the queen of the Chthonic goddess. She then remarks that if Melino\u00eb's kindness isn't an act, then she needs to learn how complicated the world is. Even her boons have a noticeably cynical touch, like granting bonuses only if she have no common rarity boons or losing power when the shine of her Bridal Glow boon begins to fade, among other examples. \nDespite this initial distance, Hera gradually develops an affection for Melino\u00eb, seeing her as the little girl who she never had.\nPersephone.\n&lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt;: Hera's niece.&lt;br&gt;\nThe Titans.\nThe previous rulers of the world, defeated in the Titan War and imprisoned in the pits of &lt;a href=\"Tartarus\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt;.

She still harbors traumatic memories of Chronos, as she maintains that she never truly believed he had vanished forever, and her apprehensions were brushed aside by Zeus."}

He is encountered in the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Ephyra\"&gt;City of Ephyra&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Thessaly\"&gt;Rift of Thessaly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Mount Olympus&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality and characteristics.\nA enigmatic demigod renowned for his strength, he's still revered for his accomplishments. So beloved by &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; that upon his death, he ascended to Olympus.\nHe's rugged, tough, and exudes the demeanor of a seasoned warrior. He greets Melino\u00eb coldly, instructing her to leave as he prefers to work alone without any interference and advises her that it's not a wise idea to provoke him.\nHeracles excelled in his endeavors, earning recognition even among other heroes like &lt;a href=\"Theseus\"&gt;Theseus&lt;/a&gt;. However, he harbors bitterness towards the &lt;a href=\"Olympians\"&gt;Olympians&lt;/a&gt; and is weary of constantly fulfilling their requests. Despite his fatigue, he acknowledges the lingering sense of duty.\nIn his book of shadows entry, it is said that wherever he goes, everyone around him becomes unhappy upon seeing him, and that he is a monster with a human face and an animal heart. This may be because, due to having enemies on all sides, many people around Heracles end up getting hurt accidentally.\nHe's harsh towards Melino\u00eb, partly due to his prejudice against witches. When questioned, he remains evasive, refusing to divulge further. Nonetheless, his respect for Melino\u00eb grows gradually upon discovering her non-divine lineage, akin to his own, and her prowess in combat.\nPhysical Description.\nHeracles appears as an imposing man with a tan skin tone, wearing only the Nemean Lion cloak on his back, with its paws serving as a belt, revealing his musclebound and scarred chest. His face is almost identical to his father's, although much younger and with a more sour expression. His beard is blond, wild, and mixed with the fur of the lion pelt on his head.\nHe's seen with multiple weapons of all sorts, some on his hands, others bound to him by ropes and straps. He also adorns more ropes around, namely on his left forearm, on top of his left bracelet, as well as the strap that crosses his chest. The knots seen on some of the ropes are known as \"square knots\".\nHistory.\nHades.\nIt's unclear where is Heracles and how is he doing during the game. However, seeing as his death was before the Trojan War, which has clearly already happened, he's likely residing on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Olympus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt; also mentions Heracles died a death more gruesome than his and briefly stayed in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Underworld\"&gt;Underworld&lt;/a&gt;, but since he's favored by the gods, a pact must have been made that allowed him to leave.\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; comments that he's still sour from the time the hero came to take &lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt; from him, meaning he has already completed all twelve of his labors. &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; also makes comments about wishing to fight him instead of &lt;a href=\"Theseus\"&gt;Theseus&lt;/a&gt;, and can even purchase former weapons of the hero, as well as a statue for the West Hall.\nHades II.\nHeracles can appear in an Encounter in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;Surface&lt;/a&gt; to assist &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; as she makes her way to Olympus through a competition to see who can earn the most &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Crowns\"&gt;Gold Crowns&lt;/a&gt; from defeating enemies.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\nMerchandise=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

{"id": "942", "revid": "48112766", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=942", "title": "Hermes", "text": "Hermes is the &lt;a href=\"Olympian\"&gt;Olympian&lt;/a&gt; God of Commerce, Trickery, and Travel, as well as the messenger of the gods. He works with &lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt; to guide souls to their proper place in the Underworld, with Hermes delivering the souls to Charon, for him to ferry them down the Styx the rest of the way (giving Hermes the title of psychopomp, or someone who guides souls to the afterlife, which he and Charon share). He offers &lt;a href=\"boons\"&gt;boons&lt;/a&gt; that enhance &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus's&lt;/a&gt; speed in various ways, including attack speed and special speed. His boons can also improve Zagreus's dash and cast recovery.\nHermes is one of five Olympian gods (the other four being &lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;) who will not appear in the very first run of a save.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;\", Hermes has become a spy for Olympus and has inflitrated &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;'s army to gain an edge in the fight against him. Despite this, he will provide his boons to &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; in her fight against Chronos.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nMessenger of the Gods, God of Merchants, and Tricksters, Hermes rushes in to help Zagreus escape. Hermes is quite talkative, frenzied, and rarely pauses to take a breath. Despite his other duties, he is also a psychopomp tasked with guiding the souls of the dead alongside &lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;.\nHermes is free-spirited, has a bright personality, and is an animated and chatty god. He is well-informed and more aware of the situation than any other &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Olympian&lt;/a&gt;. Hermes speaks extremely quickly, without pauses, making it difficult at times to keep up with him, and causing some things to slip by less attentive ears. His rapid speech is due to the fact that he is always overloaded with messages to deliver.\nHe has a genuine camaraderie with his colleagues guardians of the dead, even appeasing the feared Charon, who is inaccessible even by underworld standards. Charon doesn't seem to find Hermes' energy tiring, and seems to enjoy his company, although &lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt; and many others think that he is irritatingly excitable to listen to.\nDespite the nature of his job dealing with the dead, he is very vivacious. He is a jovial, mischievous god. Even though Hermes seems to be an \"open book\", he is the most \"secretive\" among the Olympians, revealing that not even his fellow Olympians know that he is helping Zagreus, and later Melino\u00eb, and he will omit and keep certain information in secrecy for his own benefit. Although he is Zeus's accomplice, he is hiding the fact that he knows &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt; has returned to the underworld and will keep his mouth shut about it, no matter what it costs.\nPhysical description.\nHermes wears wings on his head and a smaller pair on each of his ankles and boots. He wears a slight smirk, is shown with his caduceus in his hands, and has legs that are firm and adapted for running. He wears a cream-colored chiton held by multiple belts, and with his wing symbol on top, and carries a pouch full of parchments, letters, and trinkets he needs to deliver. He also has a &lt;a href=\"Chellen\"&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt; inside his satchel, which is one of his symbolic animals.\nHis appearance drastically changes in \"Hades II\". Hermes now wears a black with orange and golden details hanging over his right shoulder with his left chest exposed, in a contrary way to Zagreus's own attire, and the hem also has chthonic wings as a pattern. It is held in place by his old belt, which is now further decorated with a golden medallion with a chthonic wing on it. He maintains his scarf and bands on his right leg and left wrist, adding now a golden bracelet on his right wrist. He wears rings on some of his fingers. His caduceus now has two little fabrics tied on it and his satchel remains the same, albeit emptier than before, fully exposing his turtle companion. His hair is now longer and darker, being tied into a tiny ponytail by a brown band, and he has a slightly paler complexion, hinting he hasn't been under the sun as much as before. He also no longer uses earrings. His field model shows his sandals are different than the ones he wore in \"Hades\", since now his toes are exposed.\nHistory.\nPast.\nEven when he was just born, he was incredibly mischievous. With his playful nature, he jumped out of his swaddling clothes and stole &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;'s cattle. To prevent his brother from chasing him, he even threatened to plunder Apollo's temple. What is most known about him is that he is the god of roads, businessmen, and thieves. He once stole the scepter of Zeus, the trident of Poseidon, Apollo's bow, and Ares's sword. His swiftness and dexterity made him the embodiment of vigor, and he was later christened as a messenger of the gods.\nHe also accompanied the souls of the dead to the underworld of Hades and closed their eyes with the snake rod in his hand. He met Charon, a creepy figure, and they ended up becoming great friends.\nHades.\nHermes comes to be aware of Zagreus's escape attempts and lends his own help. However, he requests that his involvement remains hidden, as no one else besides Charon, Skelly and Zagreus himself know he's helping.\nHe comments on a multitude of different subjects, from his family and colleagues to work related matters, namely his job as a psychpomp, and commonly speaks as if delivering a message, sometimes doing truly that.\nUpon Persephone's return to the Underworld, Hermes is aware of the fact, but won't spread the news unless asked to, keeping it to himself in the mean time.\nEpilogue.\nAt first skeptical to join given his non-official involvement, Hermes nonetheless comes to the feast and enjoys it with Charon.\nHe becomes aware of Zagreus' new \"escaping arrangement\" with Hades, and keeps it to himself.\nAffinity.\nIf given &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;, Hermes will give you the &lt;a href=\"Lambent%20Plume\"&gt;Lambent Plume&lt;/a&gt;.\nHermes' affinity gauge is maxed out at 8 hearts.\nFavor.\nHermes' favor requires speaking with him while having the &lt;a href=\"Lambent%20Plume\"&gt;Lambent Plume&lt;/a&gt; equipped and max leveled to 3*. It does not matter how many stacks of its bonus you have.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Well, if they're interested in getting things done quickly, I am sure you can oblige them in a bit!\"\nGeneric Greetings.\nDialogue 01.\n Hermes : \n\"Hey, uh, could you do a little favor for me, Coz? My brothers, sisters, family, and whatnot, they are unaware I'm working with you, here. It's no big deal, but let's keep it that way for now. All right?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hermes : \n\"Message for you boss. It says, 'You're rather slow. If only somebody could help you out with that.'

If you do ever make it up here on this mountaintop for whatever reason, we should hang out, alright? I can show you around.' Your friend, Hermes.\"\nDialogue 04.\n Hermes : \n\"Another message here!

Seeing as the mortal folk up here keep dying off, and someone's got to\u00a0bring their souls to your domain, now, don't they.\"\nDialogue 11.\n Hermes : \n\"Boss, you probably caught yourself thinking: Hermes sure is quick! So how come it took so long for him to show up in first place? Well, I'm afraid, it's not for you to know. But! It's not because I was late. Not late for anything.\"\nDialogue 12.\n Hermes : \n\"Afraid there's no one faster than myself, here, Coz. But good news is, you are about to close the gap a little bit!\"\nDialogue 13.\n Hermes : \n\"Heard the news you broke your streak of victories of late, boss. Happens, right?

Go!\"\nDialogue 15.\n Hermes : \n\"Some members of the family up here, I know they haven't helped at all, but just don't take it personal or anything, all right?

And furthermore, I think you can do this rather quick! Now go!\"\nDialogue 17.\n Hermes : \n\"It's you, boss, that's good! But you're standing still! That's bad.

Though, sooner you can make it out of there, the better it'll be!\"\nDialogue 24.\n Hermes : \n\"You've got a tough climb up ahead, Coz, so you just pace yourself, all right? Just kidding, go as quickly as you can. It works for me!\"\nDialogue 25.\n Hermes : \n\"Hey, boss! Not much to report up here. But I've not exactly come this far to bring you news, have I?\"\nDialogue 26.\n Hermes : \n\"Hiya, boss! I'd ask what's new, but I already know! I have my ways.

Normally I'd stop for no one here. But when it comes to her, exceptions must be made!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"You know who keeps me awful busy, Coz? Ares. Nothing like a good old war amongst the mortals to create demand for lots and lots of messages to go around!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"Did Artemis manage to locate you already, boss? She's pretty good at that, I have to say. I'm faster! But she's fast, she's pretty fast, all right.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"So then Athena's looking out for you, that's good, that's good! She likes to put a lot of thought and stuff in everything, it's all a little much, if you ask me!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"So my professional associate, the fearsome boatman on the River Styx? You got to know him pretty well in all of this right, Coz? Hard getting through to him, I know, but his heart's in the right place! It's why I'm working with him, after all this time!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"Been downright chilly up here lately, Cos! We've Demeter to thank for that! Me, I try to stay out of her way, she doesn't think I'm of much help to her. Although I'm sure she's warmed to you at least!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"You ever get the feeling life's been moving all too quickly for you, boss? Well Dionysus doesn't, as you're probably aware. Throws quite a feast, though!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"Heard you've been seeing the Fury, Megaera, Coz? Got the impression she was quite a handful, though I guess the same can probably be said of you, there, huh? You two have fun!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"Want to bring you in on something, boss. Reason that Uncle Poseidon got to you before I did is, I let him. He's under the impression he's spry as ever! Hah!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Skelly\"&gt;Skelly&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"Boss, I know you've heard a certain rumor from a very skinny individual who's uninclined to move. You best keep that one to yourself, all right? Or else our jig is up, and your father wouldn't like that, nor would you. So, cheers!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"General\".\n Hermes : \n\"You're pretty close with Thanatos, aren't you, boss? We don't often run in the same lanes, though our duties sometimes intersect a bit. Odd chap. Seems good at what he does, though!\"\n\"Romanced\".\n Hermes : \n\"Saw Thanatos again lately, here, boss, and want to tell you, almost looked as though he cracked a smile when he mentioned you, never seen anything like that with him!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"You heard already from my pop, haven't you, Coz. Wonderful guy. Don't get to spend a lot of time together, though! You know how that is. Well, see you!\"\nGifts.\n&lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Lord Hermes, please accept this gift as a small token of my appreciation. Thank you for always keeping me on my toes.\"\n Hermes : \n\"Oh! Mighty keen of you to leave a tip, there, boss. And I've a tip for you: Don't be slow! Maybe this will help with that.\"\n\"Hermes gives &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Keepsakes\"&gt;Lambent Plume&lt;/a&gt;\"\n Zagreus: \n\"Lord Hermes, I am in your debt.\"\n2nd Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Lord Hermes sir, you've asked for nothing in return, and so, please take this humble offering because...it's nothing, really!\"\n Hermes : \n\"Well now, that's awful kind, there, Coz! No need to thank me, though. Not so profusely anyhow!\"\n3rd Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Hermes, my friend? May I call you my friend? I hope this modest offering will lift your spirits but won't slow you down.\"\n Hermes : \n\"I look like I got the sort of time to sip ambrosia, Coz? Well, guess what, I do. So, cheers!\"\n4th Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Ever since we met, Lord Hermes, life here in the Underworld has been much faster-paced, and I am ever grateful. This is for you.\"\n Hermes : \n\"Hey, boss, I appreciate the tip. But just as a reminder, all my services are paid in full already! No need for special thanks. Though...cheers.\"\n5th Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"I never could have come this far this quickly had it not been for your tireless support, Lord Hermes, sir. I'm in your debt.\"\n Hermes : \n\"You know, Coz, I got to say I had a few concerns when first we met, your father being who he is and all. But you're all right!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"I salute you, Lord Hermes, with this rarest of delicacies! Pretty rare here, anyway. You never show it, but I can only imagine how hard you must be working to back me up. Cheers, mate!\"\n Hermes : \n\"You know, the last time anybody offered me Ambrosia from the Underworld was \"never\", before now! That's quite a gesture on your part. You could have just as well taken my services for granted and I'd not have minded in the least! But, thank you, Coz.\"\n2nd Time.\n Zagreus: \n\"Message for you, Lord Hermes! It says, \"'This offering is dedicated to the incomparable god of swiftness, from whom the news is always good, because he's bringing it. You are a real mate, you know that? I really owe you one.\" Zagreus.\"\n Hermes : \n\"Look, Coz, I am going to accept this choice Ambrosia from you one last time, all right? But from this point, I am doubling down on all professional responsibilities, here. Strictly business between us! Although, secretly, you're one of my best mates. Want you to know.\"\nBeing Invited to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt; (Pre-Epilogue).\n Zagreus: \n\"I get to be the messenger this time. In the name of Hades! Olympus, this is an official message! Lord Hermes? Got here as quickly as I could.\"\n Hermes : \n\"Why, that looks like you've got a message just for me, this time, how special is that, boss? Some sort of invite from the looks of things. You sure that I'm supposed to have this, seeing as I'm not officially involved?\"\nPost-Epilogue Dialogue.\nDialogue 01.\n Hermes : \n\"So you get to keep breaking out of there, time after time, so that your father can keep finding ways to make it even harder to escape? Something like that? Sounds like an interesting assignment, Coz!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hermes : \n\"Got to tell you, Coz, that was a real something of a feast back your place! A little awkward, having to pretend we just met, but hey, I'm an Olympian! Means I can posture with the best of them. Good times, Coz! Glad it all worked out.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hermes : \n\"Everybody on Olympus, they're still going on about Persephone, Queen of the Underworld! They had no idea she was down there all along, none whatsoever, Coz!

That way nobody slows me down.\"\nDialogue 05.\n Hermes : \n\"You know, I never knew the pomegranate seeds down in the Underworld held such power if not for your mother mentioning it, Coz! And here I thought they were just tasty, that was it!\"\nDialogue 06.\n Hermes : \n\"Your mother got from there just fine, don't worry, Coz! She had me looking after her, and such. Seemed real nice! Told me to tell you hi.\""}

I'm back!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You are!\"\nDialogue 02 (Boon Dialogue).\n Hermes : \n\"How's things, you good? I'm good. Mostly! And good to see your task is underway, but change of plan, though it's a lot to ask: Up for a visit to Olympus sometime soon?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Lord Hermes, just a moment, what do you mean \"Olympus? \"My task is to stop Chronos in the Underworld. I can hardly breathe the surface air, much less get to a mountaintop!\"\n Hermes : \n\"Come on, M! You have your ways! Gramps is up to something bad, more than his usual attacks, so just give it some thought. Wouldn't ask if it was nothing, right? OK, got to run, and so do you. I'll be in touch by Boon!\"\n Hermes : \n\"So long for now!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Good-bye!\"\nKeepsake Dialogue (&lt;a href=\"Metallic%20Droplet\"&gt;Metallic Droplet&lt;/a&gt;).\n Hermes : \n\"You're moving right along there, M!

Do watch your step, though when you're moving fast, I know it can be tough!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hermes : \n\"It's rough out there tonight, isn't it M? Well, just hang on. And maybe one of these will help you go a little farther faster, hey?\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hermes : \n\"Oh, no! You're hurt! What happened to you, M? Gramps must have got to you before I did! How is that even possible...?\"\nDialogue 04.\n Hermes : \n\"That's not the safest place to travel, is it, M? So you picked up a scrape or two, so what! Now you'll pick up some speed!\"\nAbout the Scenery.\n&lt;a href=\"Oceanus\"&gt;Oceanus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"You're taking something of a scenic route down to your father's House! Gramps has the major regions of the Underworld locked down, so... come to think, that makes a lot of sense!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Mount Olympus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"You finally saw what it was like up here! Most of the others are holding out at the top of Olympus, and \"you \"are the reinforcements. So come on back when you can, all right?\"\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hermes : \n\"You made it up here, M!

And \"speed!\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hermes : \n\"Hey M! You're here! That's great! Hec says you even got your Underworld blood-curse sorted so you're ready for a bit of a long-distance run. Just watch for bumps along the way, though let's speed you past them if we can!\"\nDialogue 04.\n Hermes : \n\"The dead throughout Ephyra should be resting easy in your father's care, but Gramps shut it all down, flung open the Underworld's gates, and here we are. If I were dead, I'd be mad, too.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Thessaly\"&gt;Rift of Thessaly&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"If only I could whisk you clear across the sea-rift that Poseidon carved out.

Well let's see if we can't cut out a little travel time to your destination, hey?\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hermes : \n\"Thought I'd catch you right on your way out! Travel can be a very rewarding experience, but sometimes, you just want to get to where you need to be!\"\nDialogue 04.\n Hermes : \n\"Another race to the finish line begins, hey, M?

Well then, \"get set\", because we'll have you there in no time flat! Provided you survive and all...\"\nOffering Boon at The Start of a Run (Underworld).\n Hermes : \n\"Had enough surface air for now, I get it, M. The more familiar path is often best! Either way, take this at your own pace. Don't anybody rush you!

He still won't say a word. Think he's just covering his tracks so Gramps can't pin him down!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hermes : \n\"You know, it's gotten harder sneaking down into the Underworld of late! Good thing I happen to know an expert on the subject. And so do \"you\", I see!\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hermes : \n\"Cheers for your business, on behalf of my erstwhile professional associate there! Feels good to be working together with that one again, you tell him I said \"hrrnnggh!\"\nDialogue 04.\n Hermes : \n\"The boatman always takes his toll, that's just the way it is! Though the benefits are \"more \"than worth the asking price, you got my guarantee!\"\nAbout Reaching &lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"M, I know it's not an easy trip, or even possible for you right now, heading all the way up here. But just imagine how hard it is for our family to swallow our pride and ask for aid! Things are that grim!\"\nAbout Route Choice.\n Hermes : \n\"Time of need here, M, and we need you at the bottom of the Underworld, \"and \"the top of Olympus! Two places at once, my sympathies. The \"trick \"is to move really, really fast!\"\nAbout Clearing Run.\n Hermes : \n\"You made it pretty far down there before! Impressive work, I knew you had it in you, M! But Gramps still isn't backing down, is he? Maybe he's having second thoughts at least!\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Mount Olympus&lt;/a&gt; Being Under Siege.\n Hermes : \n\"Olympus has been under siege before! Normally, it's not too big a deal. But Gramps has something else in mind this time. Got some individuals here pretty spooked!\"\nAbout Mission.\nDialogue 01.\n\"Officially, I'm keeping tabs on you, you're not supposed to know, just so you know. I tell Olympus \"all \"the latest happenings, nothing too private, mind; and then I tell \"you \"more! Just keeping tabs on everyone I guess!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hermes : \n\"These last few nights since you got started, all I managed to confirm is Gramps got hold of someone whom he's sure gives him the upper hand. Right now he's readying the next stage of his plan to bring this mountain down! I'd better go.\"\nAbout Family.\n Hermes : \n\"At least the family knows about you now! Always wanted to say, \"Message to Olympus! Persephone and Hades had another kid! And she's all right! \"But Hec knew we had to wait, and she knows a lot! So my lips were sealed.\"\nAbout Past.\n Hermes : \n\"To think I used to fill my days with whisking mortal newly-deads down to your father's realm! Honestly grew to like it soon enough, so even after Gramps showed up, I kept on stopping in when I could sneak a trip!\"\nAbout Surface Threats.\n Hermes : \n\"Gramps sends forces to Olympus, we can send them whence they came, no sweat. But he's got something else in store, and whatever it is, it's big. Learn anything, let Hec know right away.\"\nAbout Legendary Pick-Ups.\nDialogue 01.\n Hermes : \n\"Somebody call for Premium Express delivery, hey, M? This is the \"best \"I've got, and it'll take you far and fast! You have my \"guarantee!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hermes : \n\"Fresh from the highest peaks of Olympus, it's the \"Premium Express! \"The finest, fastest blessings, for only the most discerning customers. That's \"you!\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hermes : \n\"Hey, hear that, M? Why, that's the sound of \"Premium Express delivery\"! Always bringing \"you \"only the very best. So, make the most of it?\"\nAbout The Gameplay Timer.\n Hermes : \n\"Keeping track of your best time, that's what I like to see! Take anything worth doing, then do it just as well a little faster, and a \"little \"faster, and soon, you'll be like \"me! Almost!\"\nAbout The &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Trials\"&gt;Chaos Trials&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"Had a feeling that I'd find you here one of these nights, you know? Like something's in the air. I'm all keyed up, just want to get things done as \"mega\"-fast as possible!\"\nAbout The Aspect od Momus.\n Hermes : \n\"Nice snake-staff that you've got there, M, must be they're all the rage! These snakes of \"mine \"are from Apollo, helps remind me of the family, you know? Stuck together, skin not so thick, pitch hissy-fits sometimes... love 'em anyway.\"\nAbout The &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Hermes\"&gt;Shrine of Hermes&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"You found my special Shrines, good good! Some mortals pray to me both for safe travels and free stuff. \"Almost \"free. Small surcharge, mind! Associate has got to take his cut.\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Animal%20Familiars\"&gt;Animal Familiars&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"Wise move having an animal companion along! I've got a soft spot for the quiet self-sufficient types. My little tortoise Chellen always feels at home wherever we go!\"\nAbout Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"Known Hec a while, and don't envy either one of you. She couldn't just send you off to deal with Gramps before you were ready! You must have \"hated \"having to wait. I know I do!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"Hec always said you're quick to learn, you know? And sure enough, whenever I'd drop in, you'd be over a cauldron, working some new spell. Well, \"this is it! \"Your time to work some magick for our sake!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hermes : \n\"What a customer, the Titan of Time! I've not met Gramps before, though I can imagine what he must be like. Used to wonder how come my pop and his brothers were so dodgy sometimes. Now I know where they got it from!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hermes : \n\"You'd think the Titan of Time wouldn't be so stuck in the past, caught up in his idea of a \"Golden Age \"when \"he \"used to rule, and mortals hadn't a care in the world? Caring's not such a bad thing I think!\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hermes : \n\"No way you could have already stopped Gramps by now, but going after him right when you did, you're buying us some time to put a little wrinkle in his plan. So \"cheers!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Moros\"&gt;Moros&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"Hec tells me Moros, son of Nyx, is staying with you for a bit down there? I thought he always stuck with the Three Fates. There's something going on, and I don't like it, M.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"You found your father down there, M! Never could get close enough myself, hope he's still all right. Hope \"everyone\"'s all right! We'll get them back, keep doing everything we can.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Circe\"&gt;Circe&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"Ran into Lady Circe on your way last night, did you, M? She's quite the talent with those magick spells of hers. Liked turning mortals to all sorts of things! Bit \"mean \"if you ask me!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"Your mum would travel back and forth between Olympus and your father's House, and \"I \"had the pleasure of accompanying her! One day, she didn't show up. I knew right then and there something was off...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"All this reminds of the time I backed your brother when he was searching for your mum! Had a vested interest in the outcome, sure. But before I knew it, I really started to care! We'll find a way to help them, won't we, M?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hermes : \n\"Artemis and I weren't always close, each keeping to ourselves and all. But working with you and Hec brought us closer! We were so busy sneaking around, helped knowing we didn't have to sneak around each other!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hermes : \n\"You already caught up with Artemis, good good! She and I don't always chat, running around a lot, being discreet and all. But we exchange a knowing look from time to time!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n\"You run into a certain Underworld Boatman rowing about, you tell him I said hey? We've not collaborated much as before, what with everything of late. I miss those times!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hermes : \n\"So the Boatman's been all right, has he? That's good! I know that he's been looking out for Hec and the rest of you for a while now, but do look out for him in turn, would you?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Heracles\"&gt;Heracles&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"Ran into big old Heracles, did you? My stepmum's sent him on another labor of some sort. Got the feeling that his heart's not in it anymore. But hey, he's tough! And we could use the help.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Fates\"&gt;The Fates&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"So Gramps somehow got hold of the Three Fates! That isn't good, not sure what we can do about it, M. At least now everybody on Olympus knows, I figured it was time! Got us a bit on edge, though we do hide it pretty well!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"Heard from my pop tonight already, M? He's always been a very busy god but never tires out. Now that you've got his lightning strength, how about some lightning \"speed \"to boot?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"Apollo's lighting up your life? Last thing he ever wants to do is get his hands dirty, but now, things being as they are, he doesn't have much of a choice I guess!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"For all that's happened, glad you finally met Demeter, even if only by Boon. She had a funny way of showing it sometimes but \"always \"loved your mum an awful lot. She'll fight to get her back, to the bitter end.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hephaestus\"&gt;Hephaestus&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hermes : \n\"You got Hephaestus to come out of his shell! All I can get from him are work orders, \"bring me more bronze \"and such! Glad you can put the fruits of all his labor to good use!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hermes : \n\"Hephaestus makes a \"mean \"set of armor, and you know what? He makes a mean pair of sandals, too. I wear mine all the time! \"Footwear\", M! I really think it's going to catch on!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Selene\"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hermes : \n\"Oh good, Selene got a hold of you already, M! Quite the vantage point the Eye of Night has got! Always looking out for you and all of us. Her steeds are pretty quick as well!\"\nWith Other Characters.\nTBA\nGifts.\n&lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'm glad you're here, Hermes, and it's an honor to finally be working together. To our swift victory!\"\n Hermes : \n\"Oh, hey! It's been a minute since I got an offering! Cheers, M, although you needn't have. But here, I've just the thing for you!\"\n\"Hermes gives &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Metallic%20Droplet\"&gt;Metallic Droplet&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Nothing like a quick exchange of gifts!\"\n2nd Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Hermes, if there's anyone out there who can help me outpace Time, it's you. Please accept this, for your swift and reliable service.\"\n Hermes : \n\"Right charitable of you, really, M, it's just I \"really \"need to move along, so let's get to the blessings if you please?\"\n3rd Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"If not for all your speed and bravery, we never would have had a fighting chance against our enemy, Hermes. I don't think we'll soon be able to repay you for this, but I can try!\"\n Hermes : \n\"Right cordial of you, M, though I'm not much for tips and we've got pressing matters to attend to, don't you think? Though I appreciate it, honestly.\"\n4th Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I know you've been exceptionally busy as of late, but... might I briefly interrupt our routine to give to you this little offering? It isn't much, but down here, it's some of the best we've got.\"\n Hermes : \n\"Don't know how you can find the \"time \"these days, though I am grateful that you thought of me like this! Now straight to business, then? Got lots to \"do!\""}
{"id": "2513", "revid": "47838920", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2513", "title": "Hermes/Relationships", "text": "Family.\nZeus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;: Hermes's father.&lt;br&gt;Hermes is one of Zeus's many illegitimate children, and he considers his father to be a \"wonderful guy.\" However, he advises &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; not to spend too much time with Zeus. \nHermes is deeply involved in the disappearance of &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt; and is an accomplice in it alongside his father. He appears to have a certain fear of \"falling\" along with Zeus.\nWhile he keeps his father well-informed, sends messages on Zeus's behalf, and is highly reliable in this role, he doesn't share all the details to prevent Zeus from causing more harm. In reality, Hermes keeps his collaboration with Zagreus a secret, hiding this partnership even from his siblings and initially from Zeus. Hermes acts as a double agent, helping Zagreus and Persephone reunite alongside &lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, in &lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;, Zeus reveals he sees his son as lazy and never around when he's most needed, hinting their relationship isn't as good as Hermes likes to portray. This comes from Hermes constantly working behind the scenes, but never revealing as such to his family, an indication of their untrusty nature.\nAthena.\n&lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;: Hermes's half-sister.&lt;br&gt;He comments on how his stepsister thinks a little too much about things, 'and cares a bit too much,' trying to solve everything on her own, insinuating that she may be a bit intrusive. Athena criticized her brother's tendency to withhold information. She is worried that his interference may do more harm than good.\nAres.\n&lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;: Hermes's half-brother.&lt;br&gt;Although Hermes does not directly criticize his older half-brother Ares, he does indirectly comment to his cousin Zagreus that there's \"nothing like a good old fashioned war between mortals to create demand for lots and lots of messages to circulate!\", indicating that he's burdening him even more.\nArtemis.\n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;: Hermes's half-sister.&lt;br&gt;She usually turns her back on him, not out of disdain, but because she is quiet and he is very talkative. He considers Artemis a very cool distant big sister and comments on how skilled Artemis is, although he is faster, she is still very fast.\nThey both withheld the information of &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;'s existence from the remaining of their family, demonstrating that, despite their differences, they trust each other mutually and think similarly in regards to their family.\nArtemis and Hermes didn't always talk much, but they've always had a lot in common, as they're constantly on the move, busy, and prefer to keep a low profile. Taking care of themselves and their duties, Hermes realizes that working with Melino\u00eb and &lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt; brought them closer. Due to their constant business and scouting around, they now recognize they don't need to dodge each other and are more willing to help one another.\nApollo.\n&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;: Hermes's half-brother.&lt;br&gt;Hermes appears surprised at Apollo's intervention in &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;'s situation, saying the God of Light doesn't like to dirty his hands. He also sarcastically remarks the snakes of his caduceus remind him of his brother and thus he always carries a piece of him around, 'Stuck together, not so thick-skinned, occasional skirmishes... love them anyway.' This observation, comparing family relationships to snakes is somewhat sardonic and shows that Hermes acknowledges that Apollo may not have always been the best brother, but he still holds memories.\nHephaestus.\n&lt;a href=\"Hephaestus\"&gt;Hephaestus&lt;/a&gt;: Hermes's half-brother.&lt;br&gt;Hermes mentions Hephaestus was the one who made him his sandals, and praises his craftsman abilities. However, he also says Hephaestus is constantly asking him to deliver materials and nothing else, showing they aren't that close despite any efforts put, and implying Hephaestus is one of the gods that keep him the most busy.\nDionysus.\n&lt;a href=\"Dionysus\"&gt;Dionysus&lt;/a&gt;: Hermes's half-brother.&lt;br&gt;Dionysus is Hermes's younger half-brother, and both of them are playful. Hermes tells Zagreus that Dionysus never feels like life is moving too fast. He also comments on Dionysus' ability to throw a great feast, hinting that he's probably attended many such parties with his brother.\nPoseidon.\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;: Hermes's uncle.&lt;br&gt;He likes to play with his uncle, commenting that his uncle Poseidon gave Zagreus his blessing before him, of course, only because Hermes allowed. Hermes finds it amusing that Uncle Poseidon still thinks of himself as agile. Poseidon is not aware of this fact.\nHestia.\n&lt;a href=\"Hestia\"&gt;Hestia&lt;/a&gt;: Hermes' foster aunt.\nDemeter.\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;: Hermes's foster aunt&lt;br&gt;Hermes complains about how much he's been fearing the cold lately, as it has been interfering with his work. He sarcastically remarks, \"We have Demeter to thank for that,\" implying that it's her fault. Hermes doesn't like crossing paths with Demeter, as she doesn't value his services much. He hopes that spending time with Zagreus will lift her spirits and warm her heart.\nShe is happy to receive a letter from her daughter &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt; after the Epilogue, courtesy of Hermes himself, showing that he still puts his work above his personal feelings.\nHera.\n&lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt;: Hermes' stepmother.\nAphrodite.\n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;: The Goddess of Love and Beauty.&lt;br&gt;Hermes comments to Zagreus how amazing Aphrodite is, and how he doesn't usually stop, but always pauses to wave at her. She never complained, so she seems to enjoy the attention.\nChthonic Gods.\nThe gods of the underworld, Hermes frequently visits them, for it is his duty to guide the souls of the dead to the underworld. He usually has a friendly relationship with them.\nCharon.\n&lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;: Fellow psychopomp and bestie.&lt;br&gt;Pals Psychopomp and longtime friends, the relationship of the two is quite impressive as Charon really causes the chills and seems reserved even for the denizens of the underworld. Hermes is responsible for guiding the souls of the dead to the banks of the River Styx, where Charon would take over. Hermes is in real contrast with his dry companion Charon, both apparently, as one being extremely talkative and the other barely saying a word or letting out frightening murmurs. Even so, Charon seems to enjoy interacting with and listening to Hermes, not seeming to be bothered by his frantic voice like the rest of the characters and Hermes will speak highly of Charon to others.\nHermes accepts a favor from Charon and also owes him a debt, concealing the fact that he arranged for both Charon and &lt;a href=\"Skelly\"&gt;Skelly&lt;/a&gt; to assist Zagreus. If Zagreus were to uncover this, Hermes playfully reminds him that he also keeps many secrets, suggesting it's best for him to maintain secrecy as well.\nDuring the events of the second game, both have been key figures in Melino\u00eb's childhood and everyone notes how close they are with each other. Ever since Hermes left for his spy mission, many characters reassure him Hermes is well and will come back. When he finally does, Hermes reveals the first thing he did was go to Charon. Dialogue with the two will reveal they share a mutual longing for each other, as Melino\u00eb is often in charge of delivering a quick \"Hey\" in their stead to the other.\nBoth also operate in similar ways, delivering items to Melino\u00eb and the Crossroads and taking care of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Charon\"&gt;Wells of Charon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Hermes\"&gt;Shrines of Hermes&lt;/a&gt;, similar by nature.\nZagreus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;: Hermes's cousin.&lt;br&gt;Zeus trusts Hermes a lot, whether to deliver messages or keep a secret, he has the epithelium of \"messenger of the gods\". Hermes is always delivering messages from him around without complaining or covering up for something rowdy his father caused. Like Zagreus, though not quite, Hermes has spent most of his life in the Underworld, however, he notes that he is some sort of shadow of his father, Hades. As much as Hermes is considered the most honest of his family, like Zeus he is hiding the game of agreu and does not intend to tell it.\nIn the second game, when Melino\u00eb calls upon him, it reminds him of Zagreus asking for help in finding his mother. Initially, he had a mild interest in the outcome, but before he realized it, he actually began to care. His interest now extends to helping Melino\u00eb.\nMelino\u00eb.\n&lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;: Hermes's cousin.&lt;br&gt;He was a key figure in her childhood. He calls her M for short, though she is more cordial with him, always refering to him as Lord Hermes.\nDuring their encounter, Hermes expresses gratitude to Melino\u00eb, as being with her and Hecate working together has brought him closer to Artemis. He asks how things are going and if their tasks are progressing well, offering advice on adjusting plans if necessary. Hermes suggests that Melino\u00eb should visit Olympus soon, even if she can't reach the surface yet. Despite this, he bids Melino\u00eb farewell, asking her to promise to keep in touch with him and offering his support.\nHades.\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;: Hermes's uncle.&lt;br&gt;Hermes met his uncle before the events of the game, likely when he was sent to be a psychopomp. He says that this encounter was a memorable moment to him.\nThey're both very given to their work, and Hermes often mentions he respects people like that, so his uncle likely is no exception. Hermes was also present during the making of the Pact of Punishment, and possibly gave his own insights, implying Hades is open to hear his opinion, a rare occurrence.\nThanatos.\n&lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;: Fellow psychopomp.&lt;br&gt;Although Thanatos ends up bumping into Hermes at some point and likes to stay well informed at work, he finds the way Hermes delivers information irritating. He doesn't like to listen to him talk.\nPersephone.\n&lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt;: Hermes's foster cousin.&lt;br&gt;He knows all of Persephone and Zeus' plan. He helped her return to the Underworld again, and he's also hiding the fact that Charon was the one who arranged for him and Skelly to help Zagreus find her. Hermes is also the one that guides Persephone up to Olympus.\nHecate.\n&lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt;: Witch of the Crossroads.&lt;br&gt;She trusts in him to spy on Chronos, as well as keep Melino\u00eb's existence a secret from Olympus. He calls her Hec for short.\nHouse of Hades.\nSkelly.\n&lt;a href=\"Skelly\"&gt;Skelly&lt;/a&gt;: Peer relationship.&lt;br&gt;Skelly is in the service of Charon, and both of them appear to be frenetic conversationalists, maintaining a \"peer relationship.\" Hermes also seems to share confidential matters with Skelly without hesitation.\nDusa.\n&lt;a href=\"Dusa\"&gt;Dusa&lt;/a&gt;: Duty-Bound Gorgon.&lt;br&gt;They were part of a team, along with Charon and Skelly, joining forces to bring Zagreus and Persephone together.\nUnderworld Residents.\nHermes is one of the few gods that will sometimes comment on the shades Zagreus can befriend during his escape attempts. This is because he was the one that brought some of them there, some under better cirscumstances than others, but has since cut contact, likely due to his huge piles of work.\nOne such shade he leaves unnamed, but mentions they \"had it coming\", due to all their lying and cheating in life.\nOrpheus and Eurydice.\n&lt;a href=\"Orpheus\"&gt;Orpheus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eurydice\"&gt;Eurydice&lt;/a&gt;: a couple of musicians Hermes has helped before.&lt;br&gt;Hermes will make an honorable mention to these two shades, whom he helped when Orpheus tried to take Eurydice out of the Underworld, commenting on Orpheus's great ability with the lyre and lamenting not having had a proper goodbye last he saw Eurydice. He'll later be privy of information regarding Eurydice's current predicament and be glad that she is well.\nThe Titans.\nHermes is acting as a double agent, pretending to be on their side, and passing information to the surface.\nSelene.\n&lt;a href=\"Selene\"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt;: Moon Incarnate.&lt;br&gt;She mentions his welcome help in their cause. He praises her steeds for their speed.\nChronos.\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;: Hermes's paternal grandfather.&lt;br&gt;Hermes never met his grandfather before, but now can see similarities between him and his sons, pointing they're all dodgy sometimes. He is against Chronos \"Golden Age\", finding that caring isn't so bad. He also remarks it's ironic how the Titan of Time is stuck in the past."}

{"id": "2154", "revid": "30836967", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2154", "title": "Hestia", "text": "Hestia is the &lt;a href=\"Olympian\"&gt;Olympian&lt;/a&gt; Goddess of flame and hearth.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;\", she is only mentioned as one of the previous bearers of &lt;a href=\"Adamant%20Rail\"&gt;Adamant Rail&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;\" and offers her boons to &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; in her fight against &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;. \nHer signature &lt;a href=\"Status%20Curse\"&gt;Status Curse&lt;/a&gt; is Scorch, which deals damage-over-time to enemies and increasing with additional Scorch stacks.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nHestia is often regarded as being the kindest and most understanding among the Olympians. She is shown to be very comforting and caring, speaking in a maternal and advising tone when addressing her great-niece &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;, and is shown to enjoy making fire-related puns. However, despite her gentle nature, she is not to be underestimated when it comes to matters like war. Beneath that gentleness, Hestia is a \"hotheaded\" goddess; a veteran who participated in the first Titanomachy, and once wielded the &lt;a href=\"Adamant%20Rail\"&gt;Adamant Rail&lt;/a&gt;, a devastating weapon that even &lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt; hopes never again reaches the mortal world. That being said, due to its destructive nature, Hestia willingly gave up the weapon after the war (though she still doesn't appreciate &lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt; using it to spread mischief). Despite being immortal, Hestia likes to refer to herself as elderly. She is shown to take pride in her position as the eldest of the Olympians and takes offense to Demeter\u2019s claim of being the eldest. Although Hestia is not seen on Mount Olympus as often anymore, she still defends her position.\nAlthough benevolent, denying her blessings is like playing with fire - one must be careful not to get burned. In the trial of the gods, her second nature reveals itself; she warns Melino\u00eb that the 'first-degree' burn was just a glimpse of what the goddess of the flame is capable of. That being said, she also assures Melino\u00eb that she is not really mad at her for not choosing her blessing, and only attacks her because she doesn't have the energy to go against her family\u2019s traditions, which she herself finds ridiculous. \nPhysical description.\nAs the Goddess of Flame, Hestia shows a lot of fiery elements in her. She dresses in red and orange garments, complemented by a white hood with flame motifs. She uses a pyre on her head that's constantly burning, and her hair is styled as if it were a fire, even being orange to keep the theme. She wears a sort of brazier around her waist and neck, as well as a red choker. Her eyes are red, her earrings are like molten rocks and her skin is dark brown with vitiligo. She holds a scalding fire poker. Her appearance is reminiscent of that of a kindly grandmother, reflecting her maternal nature.\nHistory.\nPast.\nHestia is the eldest daughter of the &lt;a href=\"Titans\"&gt;titans&lt;/a&gt; Hyperion and Theia, and sister of &lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Helios\"&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Selene\"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eos\"&gt;Eos&lt;/a&gt;. Together with her younger sisters, Demeter and Hera, Hestia joined &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;' side and helped him defeat the &lt;a href=\"Titans\"&gt;Titans&lt;/a&gt;. During the war she wielded the &lt;a href=\"Adamant%20Rail\"&gt;Adamant Rail&lt;/a&gt;. After the war, Hestia became one of the twelve Olympian deities and discarded the Adamant Rail which was later taken by &lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt;.\nHades.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Adamant%20Rail\"&gt;Adamant Rail&lt;/a&gt; ended up in the possession of &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;, who could unlock her Aspect.\nHades II.\nHestia lends &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; her boons once she becomes aware of her existence like the rest of the Olympians.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\nMerchandise=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}
