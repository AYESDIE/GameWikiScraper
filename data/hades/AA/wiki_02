Olympus, I accept this message!\"\n Hestia : \n\"Well, look at you, hot stuff! Come to help the elderly, \"ah \"what a good girl you are. And here I was just about to burn this whole blasted place to the ground myself! Now, here's a little \"warm-up \"for ya...\"\nKeepsake Dialogue (&lt;a href=\"Everlasting%20Ember\"&gt;Everlasting Ember&lt;/a&gt;).\n Hestia : \n\"You got my Everlasting Ember, haven't you? Can faintly see its flicker even here. Your way of signaling to your Great Auntie Hestia, and all the rest, that you are hankering for Boons with just a \"little bit \"of spice!\"\nReactions.\nSeeing &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; at Low Health.\nDialogue 01.\n Hestia : \n\"Oh, dearie, you look \"terrible\", what happened to you there? Well maybe you can sweat it out or something. Would that I could cauterize your wounds!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hestia : \n\"\"Tsk, ooh\", you've had more than a scrape or two, there, haven't you? \"Augh\", such is life! Bite down and press on through, that's how we end up in a better spot.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hestia : \n\"\"Ohh\", looks to me like you've been through a \"lot! \"Well if you find yourself in a bad place, you just push on through! Or go scorched-earth on everything around you if you must.\"\nDialogue 04.\n Hestia : \n\"Oh dearie, if you're all banged up from head to toe like this, then you're in no shape for the next stage of our little firefight! So pull yourself together, \"eh?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Gods\"&gt;Trial of the Gods&lt;/a&gt; (Making Up).\n\"That there is what I call the \"first \"degree. Like letting you off with a \"little \"warning!\"\n\"HestiaMakeUp02\"\n Hestia : \nAbout Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hestia : \n\"We've been holding our own up here against that Chronos and his forces, but there's something going on, oh I can feel it. Whatever the Titan thinks he has in store, however, I suspect that it can \"burn...\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hestia : \n\"We don't quite know what Chronos has been cooking up for us, but we're all thinking that his little recent skirmishes against our mountainside are not the brunt of it. Not keen here to find out.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hestia : \n\"You should have seen it, dearie, when we brought old Chronos down! Took six of us, at least, but we got him! Little wonder he's all sore about it still. We'll just have to dispose of him more thoroughly! \"Cremation\", mayhaps?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hestia : \n\"Your dad and I got on all right, comparatively speaking, I suppose. After we put the Titans in their place, though, he went down into your Underworld, and I drifted away, like a spark from a flame...\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hestia : \n\"Your dad and I, we've got a lot in common, I suppose. The two \"not-technically-Olympians! \"At least I get to visit when I want, whereas poor Hades, soon as he got saddled with the Underworld, they never counted him among their kind again!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hestia : \n\"Old Hecate's your teacher, is that it? Known her since I was probably \"your \"age, right proper dame! Been far too long since last we saw each other, come to think. \"Eh\", what can you do? She hates everybody, I hate everybody.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hestia : \n\"So it was Artemis who sniffed you out, was it? Seems like an awful big coincidence, but then we're gods, these things they happen all the time! I'll say I'm glad she found you when she did.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hephaestus\"&gt;Hephaestus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hestia : \n\"I'm pleased to know you and Hephaestus get along. That one, he's often on his own, as though my flames are all the company he needs. He's not the worst of sorts as we gods go.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hestia : \n\"We're not too worried here right now what with Athena holding down the fort. She can be a little much if you two ever meet, but out of everybody here, she'd be the first I'd pick to watch my back.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Polyphemus\"&gt;Polyphemus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hestia : \n\"You had it out with Polyphemus, so I hear! Recall distinctly how he lost his eye. Let's say \"flame \"played a vital part and leave it there. Almost felt sorry for the lad, but he's been getting by. And getting in your way...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hestia : \n\"I'm sensing something different in you there, dearie. It's like a divine mark of ours but it's most certainly not anybody's here. It's positively ancient, even next to me! Got some old friends that we don't know about?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hestia : \n\"You had a bad run-in with that wretched Eris on your way here, eh? Just \"great\", to know that Strife herself is up against us now! And got her grubby little fingers on my Rail of Adamant... I ought have kept the thing.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hestia : \n\"Heard you plucked that nasty Eris from the sky! Well, serves her right! Though we could never make her stay away for good. To think she's one of \"Nyx's \"many pups! Squeeze out a big litter like that, you're liable to get a runt.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Heracles\"&gt;Heracles&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hestia : \n\"Oh while you're up here do watch out for Heracles, big burly sort of man? One of the best we've got but sometimes gives the sense that he's become unhappy with his job. How that is possible, though, is beyond my ken!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hestia : \n\"Oh, the mighty ruler of Olympus gave to you a bit of his thunderous power, did he now? Well that's not going to take you very far at all, so let me set you up with a \"little extra firepower \"here.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hestia : \n\"Already had a brush with sister Hera, have you, now? She's more accustomed to attending youngsters such as you, but then again, she's got her own to deal with. So why not stick with me?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hestia : \n\"Our young Queen Hera, she'd always say one ought to keep her feelings bottled up and carefully in check. Look where that attitude got her! I say let loose your temper and your rage. Let it \"all \"out!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hestia : \n\"Blessed already by the mighty god of earth and sea, are you? Poseidon's power and my own don't often mix, but then again, neither do he and I, of that you can be certain, there, dearie.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hestia : \n\"Why, the flamboyant god of light has put a little \"sparkle \"on you, hasn't he? Shines like the sun, Apollo does, \"oh sure! \"But there's more than one way to light up a place, you know.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hestia : \n\"You bear the gift of Aphrodite, don't you, there? You know, she's much, \"much \"older than she looks. Appearances are everything to her, whilst as for me, I'm about hotness of a different sort...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hestia : \n\"My frosty little sister Demeter has been in touch already, I can tell! Your nan fancies herself the \"eldest of Olympus\", she does! Only true because I'm usually not here. Mayhaps she left you cold, well not to worry, I have \"just \"the remedy!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hestia : \n\"Poor little sister Demeter. She bore but one child, a girl, dearie. Persephone, your mum! And even still, that child caused her at least as much grief as joy. It's not your mum's fault, mind. She was a lovely one, with hair like yours.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hestia : \n\"You've got a real spring in your step if I'm not mistaken, dearie! The handiwork of swiftest Hermes, I suppose. You know what else moves awful quick? Here, let me give to you a little hint.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Selene\"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hestia : \n\"You've got Selene's moonlight shine on you, eh? I'll not deny it has a certain power and allure... but such a cold and distant light, next to a scorching flame? There's no comparison!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Prometheus\"&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hestia : \n\"So the Titan of Foresight slipped his chains and fights against us now! A pity, that. Been on the outs with us ever since we caught him red-handed with my flames. Stole fire for the sake of mortalkind! Could have just asked me nice!\"\nWith Other Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Hestia : \n\"In olden days I never took strapping young Zeus here for the marrying type, and was none too pleased when he picked my poor sister Hera for the job! But you've been a right good husband to her, haven't you, Zeus?\"\n Zeus : \n\"...I sometimes pity you, Hestia, for never having known the joys of matrimony for yourself. Challenges arise in any such relationship, but together with your beloved partner, you find a way! All you must do is compromise and cooperate.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Zeus : \n\"We're so accustomed to my sister-in-law Hestia being off on her own, why, we even stopped saving a seat in my palace! But she's here to stay this time, aren't you, Hess?\"\n Hestia : \n\"\"Oh\", why, dearest Zeus, perish the thought that I would ever leave again! You've given me such a warm welcome after all, having removed my blasted seat only to put it back. Though, let's not worry hot stuff here with all of that!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Hestia : \n\"Not always big on family business, though I take exception for my little sis. She of all goddesses has to put up with the most around here, and that's not even counting all this Chronos stuff. How do you manage it, \"O Queen?\"\n Hera : \n\"I manage it one evening at a time is how, Sister! Perhaps we shall have to burn the old world down and start anew, but... I can think of \"none \"more suited, should the need arise.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hera : \n\"We goddesses can be too proud to beg for aid! I'd never stoop to it myself. Why bother, when my hard-headed sister Hestia shall insist on intervening, anyway? And at this very moment \"whilst I speak!\"\n Hestia : \n\"Because, respectfully, you just don't know what's \"good \"for you, O Queen! Sometimes it's ones can't bring themselves to ask for help that need it \"most! \"Now why don't we set a \"proper \"example for the latest unceremonious addition to our family?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Hestia : \n\"Take our blessings but \"don't \"follow our example's what I say, dearie. A case in point's fish-faced Poseidon over here! Always trying hard to make a splash, \"never \"caring much who ends up getting wet. That about right, you big oaf?\"\n Poseidon : \n\"Quite on the contrary, dear Hestia! You're wrong at least on two accounts I think: First, I need never \"try hard \"to make a splash! I effortlessly do it every time. And second, don't you call me \"fish-faced\", you mean wrinkly old hag, \"ha-hah!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Poseidon : \n\"I have known Hestia practically since the cataclysmic day that I was born! Although when things are normal we avoid each other at all costs, she's like an old, wise sister to me at this point, and I am glad she's here! \"Right \"here!\"\n Hestia : \n\"You \"best \"be glad I'm here, you lug! Lest I leave all of you again to fend for your own damn selves. You won't be putting Chronos back into the ground without me, anyhow! That goes for you, too, hot stuff.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Hestia : \n\"All right, dearie, let's get a real fire going! No more fussing about merely with sparks and such. Oh, \"Apollo? \"Get your buttocks over here right now, 'cause I could use a light!\"\n Apollo : \n\"\"Erm\", right away, dear Lady Hestia! Though, might we please take more precaution not to burn down half the mountaintop this time...?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Apollo : \n\"Great Hestia has joined us here, Cousin! Returned from all her journeys 'cross the world, to lend her wisdom in our time of need. Where glows her hearth-flame, you shall also find my light. And together, we can, \"oh\u2014!\"\n Hestia : \n\"\"Oh \"shut it, Golden Boy, we don't have time for pageantry! Instead, how about we show your wee cousin there how we can light up the night? Won't do for her to wander in the dark!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Hestia : \n\"Would you believe it, hot stuff? I have on good authority that \"somebody \"around here's laid a claim to being \"Eldest of Olympus. \"Oh, Demeter? Care to explain \"that \"one?\"\n Demeter : \n\"Hestia, you had \"abandoned \"us! To be an Olympian is not merely a birthright, but a \"pledge; \"both to this family, and this mountain. Restore your rightful status, and join me now to aid my granddaughter!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Demeter : \n\"Your Great Aunt Hestia is not exactly as she \"seems. \"In olden times, she was content merely to let her flames keep sputtering within the hearths of mortal homes. Admit to it, Sister: You've changed.\"\n Hestia : \n\"And you, Demeter, you've not changed at \"all! None \"of you have! It's why you're in a heap of \"trouble \"now, or \"we \"I ought to say. Good thing your grandkid's coming to our rescue!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hephaestus\"&gt;Hephaestus&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Hestia : \n\"If there's one thing I learned from my strong-armed nephew here, dearie, it's that you always have to strike while the iron's still hot. Now \"come \"on, \"hop \"to it, Hephaestus my lad!\"\n Hephaestus : \n\"I'm hoppin', I'm hoppin', Lady, \"augh! \"Though if you keep on turning up the heat in here, then this whole \"forge \"is going to blow, and take the rest of the damn mountain with it, \"too! \"And what would witchie have to fight for then?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hephaestus : \n\"The mortals, they like giving thanks to us, but what are \"we \"supposed to do, you know? Well, I just do the same. Give thanks to Lady Hestia, at least! For keeping my forge burning hot. She even visits me now and again!\"\n Hestia : \n\"Well, that's because I \"like \"it here, my lad! In spite of all the clanging and whatnot, it's \"peaceful\", more or less. And you're not such bad company to keep. Though, why don't we show your cousin what we can cobble up \"together?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt; (Duo Boon).\nDialogue 01.\n Hestia : \n\"Come on, hop to it, hot stuff! While you've still got your looks! Not like Aphrodite here is gonna let you hold to them forever. She doesn't care for competition, you can trust me on that.\"\n Aphrodite : \n\"Sweet Hestia, whatever do you \"mean? \"I'll be the first to admit looks aren't \"everything. \"Who even needs them? But on the other hand, we're blessed to have someone of such vast wisdom and experience as \"you \"here on our side!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Aphrodite : \n\"The fleeting quality of beauty is what makes us \"long \"for it! But even for those whose \"outer \"beauty has abandoned them, there's oft an \"inner \"beauty that burns bright! Don't you agree, dear Hestia?\"\n Hestia : \n\"Careful with that line of reasoning there, Aphrodite. You don't have much inner beauty to speak of, and your \"outer \"beauty I can melt off in a \"snap. \"And growing all those lustrous tresses back would take a while, by my reckoning...\"\nAbouth the Scenery.\n&lt;a href=\"Oceanus\"&gt;Oceanus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hestia : \n\"Where in those bloody depths \"are \"you, dearie, underneath the sea?! It's hard to get a blaze a-roaring when there's water all about, but if you can handle the pressure down there, I can bring the heat!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Mourning\"&gt;Fields of Mourning&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hestia : \n\"You made it all the way down to the Mourning Fields before? A horrid place, or so I hear, and covered in dry brush, \"far \"as the eye can see. Well, next time you're there, you burn your way on through! Hear me, hot stuff?\"\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hestia : \n\"Well, look at you, hot stuff, you made it to the surface after all! I figured that you might. It's maybe even colder here than down below, but \"that\", at least, we can fix right away, I think!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hestia : \n\"Mortals go from worshiping the flame to fearing it. As well they ought! The hearth-fires of every home there in that wretched city you reside in, all of them burned out. Not that I'm mad, oh no.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hestia : \n\"Poor thing, been all cooped up inside that Underworld, haven't you? There's a whole great world to see out there, once your business is done. Do let me know, I can suggest some wondrous spots not far from here!\"\n&lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Ephyra\"&gt;City of Ephyra&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hestia : \n\"The city of Ephyra burns, but it's not entirely my fault! Flames are like a tool, I suppose... one of those things requiring precaution on one's part. Lose something in a fire, sorry! Can't help you with that!\"\nMiscellaneous Conversations.\nOffering Boon at The Start of a Run (Any).\nDialogue 01.\n Hestia : \n\"Why hello, dearie, getting ready for your next excursion, there? You're just a glowing ember for the moment, so how about we get you good and fired up?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hestia : \n\"Now don't go wandering into the dark without a proper light! And I don't mean the kind Apollo's offering, although mayhaps I'd settle for the Moon. Anyhow, no matter, \"here!\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hestia : \n\"Think you can slip right out of there this late without my noticing? Well, typically you can, but not this time! And your punishment is a fine selection of hearth-warming Boons!\"\nOffering Boon at The Start of a Run (Underworld).\n Hestia : \n\"You must live somewhere 'round those parts, don't you, dearie? Well, since it seems a little cold out there tonight, why don't we make some \"temperature adjustments \"here...\"\nOffering Boon at The Start of a Run (&lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt;).\n Hestia : \n\"So, headed up this way again? Won't be hearing any arguments from me! Not sure you can hear me at all down there, come to think. Anyhow, let's get you \"all warmed up!\"\nBuying Boon at &lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;'s Shop.\nDialogue 01.\n Hestia : \n\"You must have had an excess of those golden coins that Chronos strewed across the land. To tempt the greediest of mortals, I suppose! Or the poorest. Not for me to judge!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hestia : \n\"That Boatman's good at taking messages, isn't he? Almost like taking corpses down into the Underworld like he used to. \"Eh\", nothing to do for those these days... except to \"burn!\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hestia : \n\"You really have to pay that Charon character in these situations! What sort of daft system is \"that? \"What, no blessings for the poor? Doesn't seem fair at all.\"\nDialogue 04.\n Hestia : \n\"My blessing made it all that way on just a rickety old wooden ferryboat? Must be a litany of fire-safety hazards there, although plenty of water near with which to put them out.\"\nDialogue 05.\n Hestia : \n\"What, that ferryman having a fire sale there? Don't want you paying an exorbitant amount! Not that there ought to be a price on blessings, anyhow.\"\nAbout Flame.\nDialogue 01.\n Hestia : \n\"For every candle that you light, for every cauldron that you boil, that's \"my \"flame working its own magick for you, dearie! So you just think of me whenever the sparks fly.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hestia : \n\"Funny thing about flame, dearie, it's warm and pretty, isn't it? But it can kill you in a couple of licks. Really makes you think! And really makes you burn to a crisp, if you're not careful...\"\nAbout Soot.\n Hestia : \n\"Guess what, hot stuff, your Great-Aunt's back again to turn your foes to soot! Best way to make it so they never bother you again, though tidying up can be a bit of a pain...\"\nAbout Sisters.\n Hestia : \n\"\"Eh\", this mountaintop. Gave up my seat here, you know. Wanted to see the world, not my blasted sisters everyday! But now I'm stuck here with the lot of them. Burns me right up, even to think about!\"\nAbout Darkness.\n Hestia : \n\"You're used to living in darkness, aren't you? Up here, darkness is widely feared. Even in the warmth of my firelight, they jump at shadows, mortals and even gods sometimes! They trust their weak eyes overmuch I think.\"\nAbout Parents.\n Hestia : \n\"Been on your own all this time, haven't you? Well, might be you're better off. Wish I never knew \"my \"blasted dad and mum! They taught me nothing I couldn't have learned better on my own.\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Olympians\"&gt;Olympians&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hestia : \n\"Know what this family's problem is, dearie? It's just too big! The others act as though they pity me, \"poor childless Hestia\", they say! But they all long for their childless days, I can see it in their eyes.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hestia : \n\"I almost pity you, dearie, all swept up in our affairs! You don't know how hard I've tried to avoid it myself. Must we always have to take a blasted side in everything? But we gods, we just love a good fight...\"\nAbout Backstory.\nDialogue 01.\n Hestia : \n\"\"Ohh\", I was something in my glory days. Lots of suitors. \"Pfeh! \"I was a crack shot with the Rail of Adamant. You heard of it? Monstrous thing, gave it up. Gave up warring altogether! Until now, apparently!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hestia : \n\"\"Ah\", the passions of youth! I've smoldered away, not much of a feast for the eyes at this point. Fine. But \"you? \"Still just a kindling. Though, we'll make an inferno of you yet!\"\nAbout Witchcraft.\n Hestia : \n\"So you're a bit of a witch, are you? Well, not I! Stuck with \"this \"family already, don't see why I'd want another one. But I understand the appeal, I suppose. Plenty of candles and fire to it, isn't there?\"\nAbout Mortals.\nDialogue 01.\n Hestia : \n\"We ought have been kinder to mortals, really. Then Chronos would've had a harder time compelling the dead to rise against us! I've always tried to look after the living. But our family's best known for looking after ourselves.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hestia : \n\"The mortals used to make us many offerings, giving up their own food and the like. They always praised me first among the gods, for it's my fire they used when making sacrifice. It was very sweet!\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt; Penalty.\n Hestia : \n\"You're not supposed to be up here, are ya? Don't think your dad's permitted back up top, at least. But you're a witch, must be you've got your cures for everything under the sun!\"\nAbout Route Choice.\n Hestia : \n\"Don't let us keep on jerking you around, all right? First we got you going after Chronos, now we got you coming here to our defense, \"blast! \"Though just in case nobody's said it yet, we \"really do \"appreciate the help.\"\nAbout The &lt;a href=\"River%20Phlegethon\"&gt;River Phlegethon&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hestia : \n\"Someday I'd like to see the River Phlegethon you've got down in the Underworld! A river full of \"flame... \"tried making something like that here on our side, but it sent mortals panicking, and the gods didn't much care for it either...\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; Clearing A Run (&lt;a href=\"The%20Underworld\"&gt;The Underworld&lt;/a&gt;).\nDialogue 01.\n Hestia : \n\"They're saying that you gave him one from all of us! Chronos, that is. A right proper old fashioned \"beating\", that is! Must have felt all warm and cozy, didn't it? Makes you want to do it again and \"again!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hestia : \n\"You got that bloody Titan, didn't ya? Don't feel too bad you couldn't end him altogether, not like any of the rest of us were able to, as you can plainly see. Instead, mayhaps go kick him while he's \"down! \"Happy to help with \"that!\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Cinder\"&gt;Cinder&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hestia : \n\"Got yourself some Cinder there, don't ya? Not a flashy substance, but it's strong, good source of flame! Most gods and mortals only care for shiny baubles and the like. But some of you witches rather know your stuff!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hestia : \n\"You're loaded up with Cinder, aren't ya? That much of it I can detect from here... a special kind from torches I know well. Some remnants of your bouts with Hecate? You can't really be fighting. Probably just your nightly exercise!\"\nAbout Myths.\n Hestia : \n\"The others, each in their own way, they do like when mortals make them subjects in their tales and songs. Well, not \"I! \"In that regard I think you Underworld gods are in the right. Best keep our business to our own damn selves!\"\nAbout Weapons.\nDialogue 01 (&lt;a href=\"Umbral%20Flames\"&gt;Umbral Flames&lt;/a&gt;).\n Hestia : \n\"What's that you got there, Ygnium is it? Reminds me of those twin torches that old Hecate would always have with her. If these are anything like those, they'll never sputter out. But just in case, we'll keep them nice and hot!\"\nDialogue 02 (Aspect of Eos).\n Hestia : \n\"What happened to those Flames of yours? Now shining almost like the break of Dawn. Mayhaps that rosy-fingered Eos has decided to pitch in! Much as we'd hate to interrupt her from the one thing on her schedule each day...\"\nAbout The &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Trials\"&gt;Chaos Trials&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Hestia : \n\"Just earlier I felt the strangest urge to seek you out, dearie! Almost as though it wasn't even me deciding it! Messing with eldritch forces or somesuch? Well if you want to gaze into the cold abyss, I'll keep you nice and warm.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hestia : \n\"Don't know how you got so far so quick tonight, hot stuff, but you're not going any farther till you're properly prepared. Got to bring plenty of \"heat \"where you're going!\"\nPost-Gift Lines.\nDialogue 01.\n Hestia : \n\"\"Ah\", I like a girl who's ready to gird up her loins, get her hands dirty and the like. Too many just waiting for someone to clean their messes for them, blast it all. Speaking of, why don't you go and do some \"blasting \"for me, eh?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hestia : \n\"We've burned bright on Olympus I don't know how long already, dearie. Suppose our time has come and gone? Mayhaps we're more like mortals than we care to admit. Well, whatever doom awaits, I welcome it!\"\nDialogue 03.\n Hestia : \n\"You really are an odd one, hot stuff. At first I thought you were a little stuck up, much like some others whom I happen to know only too well. But you truly are committed to righting this wrong from well before your time, aren't you?\"\nAbout Legendary Boon.\nDialogue 01.\n Hestia : \n\"Even I'll admit the quaint crackle of the hearth just doesn't always do the job. Sometimes, what we need is a great big conflagration, an inferno of the highest order! How about one, then?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Hestia : \n\"The hearth is at the center of the mortal household, dearie, keeping my flames comfortably in place. But I can make a wildfire in a \"snap! \"And when I get angry, that's \"exactly \"what I do.\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Oath%20of%20the%20Unseen\"&gt;Oath of the Unseen&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hestia : \n\"Something about this night gives me the proper chills, hot stuff. It's like the darkness is so thick, it suffocates! And problem is, you can't have fire without air. Careful, all right?\"\nGifts.\n&lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Dear Goddess Hestia, I hope you will accept this offering. It's a pleasure to have met someone with your warmth, wisdom, and strength.\"\n Hestia : \n\"Well look at you, making me offerings! Such hospitality, and while I'd throw most customs to the flames, the old exchange of gifts is one that I don't mind. So here, something from me.\"\n\"Hestia gives &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Everlasting%20Ember\"&gt;Everlasting Ember&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Something from Auntie Hestia...\"\n2nd Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Please accept this, Great Aunt Hestia! Your generous support means a lot to me. I know there's so much I can learn from you.\"\n Hestia : \n\"Come on now, I've nothing much to teach. You seem a recluse much the same as I, besides, although a looker still. But it's been nice to have made your acquaintance.\"\n3rd Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Great Hestia, goddess of hearth and flame! May your spark burn always as brightly. You've helped me so much on my way!\"\n Hestia : \n\"Why, thank you for that, dearie, you're too kind. Mortals were so convinced I only liked \"burnt \"offerings, they never gave me good stuff such as this.\"\n4th Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"A tribute for dear Lady Hestia! Your bright flames are a guiding light, and bane to all our enemies. Though your keen wisdom and fiery spirit spur me on at least as much!\"\n Hestia : \n\"No use buttering me up, you know. What, you think I'm going to withhold the best I've got unless you pay me some nice compliment? I can be petty, sure, but not \"that \"petty!\""}

Hestia appreciates Melino\u00eb\u2019s kindness and cares a great deal for her niece, looking out for her via boon. As a show of affection, Hestia often calls Melino\u00eb nicknames like \u201chot stuff\u201d and \u201cdearie\u201d, and Melino\u00eb, in turn, calls her \u201cAuntie Hestia\u201d. \nAlthough she does care for Melino\u00eb, just like the other Olympians, she will still attack her during the Trial of the Gods if she does not choose her boon.

After the trial, she, like the other Olympians, will give Melino\u00eb her boon anyway as a form of apology."}

{"id": "664", "revid": "48934972", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=664", "title": "House of Hades", "text": "The House of Hades is located in the deepest depths of the underworld. It is the personal estate of &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Lord Hades&lt;/a&gt;, who resides here with his family and staff. The floor plan of the House was designed by &lt;a href=\"Daedalus\"&gt;Daedalus&lt;/a&gt;. Shades are often seen milling about complaining about their lives and deaths, or forming part of the procession Hades tends to as part of his duties.\nMany &lt;a href=\"characters\"&gt;characters&lt;/a&gt; can be found and spoken with here, although not all may be present at any given time. &lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt; will only be present in the House after an escape attempt in which she was killed; the same is true of &lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;, once he returns to the underworld. Lord Hades may not appear after a run that reaches his fight. Sometimes characters will already be having conversations when &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; returns - if this is the case then he can only eavesdrop, and cannot give either character &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt;. However, if Zagreus enters his room, and returns to the foyer, the characters will no longer be talking, and he can gift them Nectar, although he cannot have a conversation with them.\nThere is apparently a rule against violence within the House, as Megaera is not permitted to harm Zagreus (no matter how much she might like to). This may be part of why neither &lt;a href=\"Tisiphone\"&gt;Tisiphone&lt;/a&gt; nor &lt;a href=\"Alecto\"&gt;Alecto&lt;/a&gt; are permitted within the House; both &lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt; and Megaera claim neither of them have \"earned the right\". Achilles further states that the two have no desire to \"exist here with the rest of us\", and their less-sensible dispositions makes them more suited elsewhere. \nGreat Hall.\nThe Pool of Styx, watched over by &lt;a href=\"Hypnos\"&gt;Hypnos&lt;/a&gt;, is located in the House's foyer. It is from this pool that Zagreus emerges whenever he dies in the underworld; according to Hypnos, only House staff and guests of honor can use the Pool in this manner. \nFollowing the foyer is the office and throne of Lord Hades, where he does paperwork and holds court for the shades with petty complaints and petitions. Beside him rests &lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt;, who lounges languidly in the Great Hall when he is not called to block the Exit Door of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Styx\"&gt;Temple of Styx&lt;/a&gt; from Zagreus. To the left of Lord Hades is the &lt;a href=\"House%20Contractor\"&gt;House Contractor&lt;/a&gt; and, after his sentence has been paid off by Prince Zagreus, the court musician &lt;a href=\"Orpheus\"&gt;Orpheus&lt;/a&gt;. \nWhile the House Contractor will always be found here after it is unlocked, Cerberus, Hypnos, and Orpheus will sometimes be absent on break. After an escape attempt in which Zagreus reached the Temple but did not clear it, Cerberus and/or Lord Hades may also be absent. Lord Hades will always be absent from the Hall after an attempt in which Zagreus fell during the final boss fight.\nWest Wing.\nThis long hallway connects the Great Hall of the House to the Administrative Chamber and Hades' bedroom. This region can be augmented with rugs, sculptures, seating and paintings purchased from the House Contractor. Outside of the Lord's personal chambers is a viewing area which contains an assortment of urns and other decorations from the various regions of the Underworld. \nAchilles vigilantly guards the hallway to prevent shades from going where they are not permitted, unless he is on break. \n&lt;a href=\"Dusa\"&gt;Dusa&lt;/a&gt; can sometimes be found merrily dusting somewhere along the hallway.\nWhen Thanatos is within the House, he can be found brooding near a balcony outside the Administrative Chamber which overlooks the River Styx, unless he is conversing with other characters.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt; returns to the House of Hades, Zagreus will be granted access to Hades' bedroom. A few runs after this, the &lt;a href=\"Resource%20Director\"&gt;Resource Director&lt;/a&gt; will appear inside the room, allowing Zagreus to arbitrarily spend resources for new ranks of badges.\nEast Wing.\nA short hallway leads from the Great Hall to the Lounge and Zagreus' &lt;a href=\"Zagreus%27s%20Room\"&gt;bedchambers&lt;/a&gt;. This region can be augmented with new flooring colors and flower vases from the House Contractor in the Great Hall tab.\nDusa can sometimes be found dusting in the eastern end of this hallway.\nNyx can typically be found watching the House here, floating next to the entryway to Zagreus' room. \nBefore the Lounge is reopened, Megaera is occasionally found standing on the opposite side of the entryway to Nyx after a run in which she was defeated.\nLounge.\nThis expansive kitchen and dining room is where shades and House staff alike can relax for a time during their eternal stay in the Underworld. This region can be augmented with a plethora of upgrades including kitchen renovations, rugs, and a shortcut from the House Contractor. \nIn rare cases, Achilles can be found here while on his break.\nDusa can sometimes be found here dusting in various locations.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Head%20Chef\"&gt;Head Chef&lt;/a&gt;, a tall shade wearing a fitting hat, can be found in the kitchen area. He rewards you with &lt;a href=\"Gemstone\"&gt;Gemstones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chthonic%20Key\"&gt;Chthonic Keys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Diamond\"&gt;Diamonds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Titan%20Blood\"&gt;Titan Blood&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt; depending on your &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; haul in the previous run.\nMegaera is sometimes standing next to a table here, either after a run in which she was killed, or randomly if either of her sisters was defeated instead. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Wretched%20Broker\"&gt;Wretched Broker&lt;/a&gt; is sequestered here in his well-stocked stall in the eastern corner.\nAdministrative Chamber.\nThis chamber is first seen in a flashback dream from before Zagreus tried to escape, in which he blunders his way through a work shift overseen by his lord father. Afterwards, he can buy back his privileges to enter the chamber through the House Contractor. Though no characters will enter this place, the shades doing bureaucratic work for the House found here will react negatively to Zagreus' entrance.\nAmong the many things found here are the Eldest Sigil, Permanent Record, Security Log, and the Water Cooler (filled with the 'waters' of the River Styx)\nThe Eldest Sigil is used by Lord Hades to teleport throughout his realm to meet Zagreus in battle, should he reach the surface. Another use for the sigil is discovered during Nyx's Favor.\nThe Permanent Record tracks the aggregate information about Zagreus' escape attempts. It lists how many times he has used and escaped with each of his &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Arms\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, how many times he has accepted each &lt;a href=\"Boons\"&gt;Olympian boon&lt;/a&gt;, how many times he has taken each &lt;a href=\"Daedalus%20Hammer\"&gt;Daedalus hammer&lt;/a&gt; upgrade, which weapon aspects he has used (other than his own), and how many times he has used each &lt;a href=\"Keepsakes\"&gt;keepsake&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Companions\"&gt;companion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Security Log accurately records information about each of Zagreus' various escape attempts. This information includes: the attempt number; its outcome; how long it took; how much &lt;a href=\"heat\"&gt;heat&lt;/a&gt; was used; what weapon (and aspect), keepsake, and companion he used; and an exact list of his boons and their levels.\nGarden.\nThe garden is unlocked after Persephone's return to the house. It serves as a location for conversations between Zagreus, Hades and Persephone.\nAfter the epilogue, a statue of Mount Olympus built by Hephaestus is placed in the far end of the garden."}

{"id": "30", "revid": "18175", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=30", "title": "How to play guide for Hades", "text": "This page will serve as a basic how to play guide for Hades. \nWarning: this guide has spoilers of all zones currently in the game.\nBasic Gameplay.\nBasic gameplay consists of progressing through randomly-generated rooms and killing enemies in an attempt to escape the Underworld. Between escape attempts you return to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt; where you prepare for another run.\nRewards for clearing rooms include:\nAfter clearing a room, rewards for the next room(s) will become visible over the door, allowing you to choose your rewards.\nOther rooms you will encounter along the way include:\nAfter escape attempts you return to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt;, where you can:\nNote that some of the above activities in the House of Hades become available through advancing the storyline.\nControls.\nMouse and keyboard users may find it helpful to rebind Special to the right mouse button and Cast to an easily accessible key or alternate mouse button. Special is more frequently used than Cast and Cast doesn't become an effective offensive ability until talent upgrades are purchased in the &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20of%20Night\"&gt;Mirror of Night&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdvanced Gameplay.\nKeepsakes.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Old%20Spiked%20Collar\"&gt;Old Spiked Collar&lt;/a&gt; is a very good first &lt;a href=\"Keepsakes\"&gt;keepsake&lt;/a&gt; for the early game. It can be obtained early on by giving a Nectar to &lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt;, and the health boost will greatly help survivability. As you unlock more keepsakes, experiment and find what suit your playstyle the most. Once you have the &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20of%20Night\"&gt;Thick Skin&lt;/a&gt; mirror upgrade, the collar becomes rather unimportant, but it may still be situationally useful.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Myrmidon%20Bracer\"&gt;Myrmidon Bracer&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt; is a good defensive keepsake to run in high damage areas such as Asphodel or Elysium, where it can get lots of value. However, you must keep in mind that it only reduces damage from in front of you, and will increase damage from behind you. &lt;a href=\"Skelly\"&gt;Skelly&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Lucky%20Tooth\"&gt;Lucky Tooth&lt;/a&gt; will act as a Death Defiance, granting you one extra chance should you end up in trouble. Finally, once you reach Elysium, the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Spearpoint\"&gt;Broken Spearpoint&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Patroclus\"&gt;Patroclus&lt;/a&gt; is very useful for dealing with enemies with rapid and fast repeated attacks, such as Soul Catchers and the Exalted.\nAll the Olympian keepsakes will let you target your boons to create a build that works well. If you like &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt; boons, the &lt;a href=\"Cosmic%20Egg\"&gt;Cosmic Egg&lt;/a&gt; greatly increases the rarity of Chaos boons and removes the health cost of the Chaos Gate. However, the Cosmic Egg does not increase the chance of a Chaos Gate spawning in the first place, so buy Light of Ixion from wells to make the most use of it.\nDungeon Structure.\nThough the chambers are somewhat randomized, there are patterns that can help you predict the upcoming encounters.\nSetting up an effective build.\nAt first you may simply grab whatever upgrades come your way, but picking the right upgrades for your builds can greatly increase your chance of success. Later zones become a huge slog if your damage output can't keep up with the increasing enemy health.\nThe golden rule is to have a plan, but be flexible. You won't always get the specific build you're gunning for, so if something else just as good comes along, take it. \nDaedalus Hammers.\nIt is recommended to grab Daedalus Hammers as soon as they appear. Daedalus Hammers are the upgrades that change and modify your run the most, and thus are often the most important to choose early, so you can build around them. In addition, taking a Hammer as soon as it is available means that the Hammer will not have a chance of spawning in a less favorable location later (such as in a shop). It is important to keep in mind when obtaining your 2nd Hammer that not all Hammer upgrades can be combined together, and the Hammer's choices will only be from modifiers that can still be combined with your first one. It is important to choose modifiers that work well together or good enough on their own independently.\nDuo Boons and Legendary Boons.\nOften, some of the strongest combinations in the game are Duo Boons, and some of the strongest individual focus boons in the game are Legendary Boons. If running a multi-god build, it is a good idea to focus on pairings where you can get helpful Duo Boons, such as Hunting Blades and Low Tolerance. Duo Boons can be offered by either god who they pair with, but it can take a couple tries to get one, even if you have all the proper prerequisites. It is easier to attempt to grab Duo Boons earlier rather than later, so you can focus more on gaining health and strength in Elysium rather than hunting for boons. God keepsakes might be helpful for doing this.\nAlternatively, Legendary boons such as Black Out are great for focusing on one specific god, and offer huge benefits for doing so. Be mindful though that other gods will want to offer boons as well, potentially making it more difficult to search for the exact god you want a legendary from.\nHermes Boons.\nSimilar to Daedalus Hammers, the number of Hermes Boons you can find in a run is fixed. These boons are often much more situational and less run defining than Daedalus Hammers, but they can still provide useful bonuses. The most useful Hermes boons are: Relative Speed, Greatest Reflex (more dashes are always good), Greater Evasion (directly translates to less damage), Swift Strike/Swift Flourish/Rapid Cast, whichever corresponds to your primary method of attack (the Common versions can be rather unnoticable, but the Rare or Epic versions give you a very significant attack speed increase)\nSingle ability vs mixed combat build.\nYou have three main offensive capabilities: attack, special, and cast. You only have a limited number of upgrade opportunities before facing each area boss, so you can focus on upgrading a single ability or upgrading them evenly. Both approaches are viable, but single attack builds do tend to be stronger. If you find your upgrades are spread a little thin, try to focus on upgrading one ability.\nPros of single ability build:\nCons:\nChoosing boons.\nYou should establish the core of your build first. Before you get to Elysium, you should at least have your major damage dealers, Dash, and maybe Call filled with boons. You can weigh your options and take a really good support boon early, but you really don't want to be going far into Asphodel with baseline damage. Once you have a solid core, you can freely look for support boons that will synergize with what you have. Look for status effects, then aim for Legendaries and Duos.\nSometimes, gods will offer to exchange a boon with a higher rarity one, this is the only way to get Heroic boons (outside of upgrades through Demeter's &lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Rare Crop&lt;/a&gt; boon), but don't rely on it happening. If you've already built around that boon with status effects and upgrades, exchanging it may be a downgrade. \nOne additional later upgrade in the game that can greatly assist you in tailoring your Boons as you go through a run is Fated Persuasion, or to a lesser extent, Fated Authority, available from the &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20of%20Night\"&gt;Mirror of Night&lt;/a&gt;'s final unlocked set. If an unappealing selection of options shows up in the boon selection/room previews this can randomize the set to give a better chance at selecting the key boons you need. \nThe Olympians' &lt;a href=\"keepsakes\"&gt;keepsakes&lt;/a&gt; let you choose a specific god's boon, once per zone. It comes at the opportunity cost of not equipping a more directly useful keepsake, so maybe you find it sufficient to use an Olympian's keepsake in the first zone or two, and switch to a defensive keepsake for the later zones. If you want a specific boon on one of your five main slots, it might a good idea to fill up the other slots with random boons you come across, so when you do find the right god, they're more likely to offer the boon you want. If you have &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20of%20Night\"&gt;Fated Authority&lt;/a&gt;, you have even more opportunities to seek out specific gods.\nSome gods require a lot of investment into higher tier boons to be truly effective, but others are quite good right away, so they make good choices for filling out your five main slots:\nFinally, here are some secondary boons worth looking out for. These complement almost any build fairly well.\nChaos Cast Damage boons are especially noteworthy for cast focused builds, as all Cast boons from the Olympian gods replace and modify the base damage of your cast, rather than increasing the base damage by percent or adding secondary damage effects as it is for Attack or Special boons. Further Pom of Power upgrades likewise increase this Base Damage rather than adding percent damage. This is important because the Cast Damage boons from Chaos are percent bonuses, meaning that a first +100% cast damage boon from Chaos will equal a 100% increase in your cast damage output regardless of the Rarity or Pom level of your Olympian cast boon. \nChaos can also provide additional Cast ammo that stacks with Fully Loaded from Artemis - and as stated before is not exclusive meaning you could theoretically stack multiple additional Cast ammo boons from Chaos in a single run, even though unlikely.\nObol and boon rarity increases are very useful if obtained early on, and Darkness increase can transform all Darkness rewards in very potent sources of healing if you are using the Dark Regeneration perk from the &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20of%20Night\"&gt;Mirror of Night&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the rework of Wrath into Aid, Aid boons are now much more viable to take early on. For maximum effectiveness against bosses, wait until you have a full gauge to activate it, but use the single charges in normal rooms for burst damage. You could also use Athena, Ares or Poseidon Wrath's brief invulnerability to tank &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Wheel\"&gt;Flame Wheels&lt;/a&gt; and Asterius's charge head on.\nUsing Poms of Power.\nWhen you pick up a Pom of power, you get to select from three random upgradable boons to upgrade. If you have a spammy, purely single-attack build, it's definitely viable to \"avoid\" taking too many upgradable boons, so that you can reliably apply Poms to the boons you want.\nYou'll want to funnel most pom upgrades to your primary damage dealers when possible. Upgrades have diminishing returns at higher levels so it's usually not worth upgrading beyond level 6 or so. Notably, Dionysus's Poison-applying boons don't suffer as much from diminishing returns, because each upgrade has to at least increase the damage by 1, so you could upgrade them to high levels with mostly linear returns."}

{"id": "388", "revid": "47838920", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=388", "title": "Hypnos", "text": "Hypnos is the embodiment of sleep. He is one of &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx's&lt;/a&gt; many children, and the younger twin brother of &lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe watches over the procession of newly-arrived shades coming before &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;, checking their names off his list. He is often seen sleeping on the job.\nHe greets &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; most of the time when the prince is killed and returns to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; via the Pool of Styx, and often gives unhelpful advice and a quip about whichever enemy or natural force did Zagreus in.\nHypnos returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;\", but in a state of deep coma induced by sleep. One of &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb's&lt;/a&gt; missions is to wake him up. \nCharacteristics and Personality.\nIn a constant battle against sleep, Hypnos is found sleeping more often than performing his task of accounting for the newly arrived dead to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; while awaiting judgment. He is the physical embodiment of sleep and is much more powerful than he appears, as he can put the entire House to sleep.\nHypnos is a serious case of immortal immaturity, constantly lounging around, and finding many ways to avoid his responsibility of accounting for the dead, from doodling to sleeping. Despite being lazy he is usually quite chatty. &lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt; speculates that the reason he hasn't been fired yet is that &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; finds him very funny and considers him an \"unofficial court jester.\"\nDespite the dark nature of his work, Hypnos is very cheerful, and although he does not have the best professional conduct, he is always very receptive. Some dialogues suggest that Hypnos may be bored at work, \"being one sad clown\" feeling lonely, and wanting someone to talk to. He will greet Zagreus and happily comment and jot down notes in his report about his latest death, and often give \"advice\" to the prince which is always met with sarcasm or outright rejection due to how blunt and obvious it is, making it almost seem as if Hypnos is mocking Zagreus instead of actually helping like he wants to.\nIn sharp contrast to &lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;, who does his job masterfully, Hypnos does not take his work too seriously. Hypnos cannot be found outside the House at any point in the game and will remain in the House, unlike Thanatos, who often moves to help Zagreus behind Hades' back. Hypnos clearly admires his brother and wishes to spend more time with him, despite Thanatos' cold rejection. At one point, he suggests that Thanatos \"kill all the mortals at once\" to make his job easier and thus free up more time together, and this may save his brother from his hard work, but Thanatos reprimands him for the \"stupidity\" of his idea.\nHe's apparently powerful enough that he can put the entire House except Nyx to sleep, which Zagreus asks him to do when he goes to snoop around. But overall, he's not very good at his job and prefers lazing about and chatting to Zagreus when he appears from the pool from time to time.\nPhysical description.\nHypnos flaunts a lazy expression and sports curly hair, with a pen feather resting on top. His silver hair and golden eyes are the only features he seems to share with his twin brother. His complexion is extremely pale, almost taking on a bluish undertone. Hypnos possesses an average stature for a god; when not hunched or stretching, he stands noticeably taller than Zagreus and has a height similar to that of his brother, boasting a slender physique. He is frequently observed lying face down during sleep.\nHis attire comprises a long red tunic adorned with golden details, complemented by a long, velvety red coat with white trim that resembles a blanket. His belt is fashioned with &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papaver_rhoeas%27%27poppies%27%27\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which are often associated with sleep, and features a sleeping skull emblem. He always carries a clipboard and a feather, which he uses to read his reports. Much like his brother, he displays a pair of golden wings on his back, embellished with \"four\" ornaments on both shoulders. Furthermore, he wears a red eye mask to \"feign\" that he's awake when he's actually asleep.\nIn Hades II, Hypnos's curly hair has been straightened and grown. His face mask has changed from a red one to a light purple one. His clothes remain the same.\nHistory.\nBefore Hades.\nHypnos was born as one of the numerous children of the goddess of the night, &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;, alongside his twin &lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;, the god of death. Initially inseparable, the shared closeness between Hypnos and Thanatos gradually diminished, eclipsed by the incessant demands of Thanatos' vocation.\nHis essence summarized the very essence of sleep, gifting mortals with serene and tranquil nights. Despite being born of Nyx herself, Hypnos never gained fame as an independent child, often labeled as careless and lacking in his other vocations. He had a reputation as the least somber of chthonic gods.\nLater, owing to the influence of their mom Nyx, Hypnos managed to secure a job as a receptionist at the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt;.\nHades.\nHypnos appears as the receptionist and the first to welcome &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;, trying to comfort him when his first death occurs, but miserably failing and initially unsettling Zagreus.\nEpilogue.\nHe falls asleep during the family meeting of the Olympian gods in the epilogue.\nBefore Hades II.\nHypnos was rescued by &lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt; and brought to &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt; took control of &lt;a href=\"Underworld\"&gt;Underworld&lt;/a&gt; but has since fallen into a deep slumber from which he cannot be awoken. During a flashback, a young &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; can interact with him but he still remains asleep.\nHades II.\nYears later, Hypnos still remains asleep with no way for him to be awakened. Interacting with him will only cause him to snore. When gifted Nectar, he only manages to mutter \"Welcome to the house...\" before going back to snoring. Any Nectar given to him will not be logged as advances to his friendship as of Early Access, October 2024.\nAffinity.\nIf given &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;, Hypnos will give you the &lt;a href=\"Chthonic%20Coin%20Purse\"&gt;Chthonic Coin Purse&lt;/a&gt;.\nHypnos' affinity gauge is maxed out at 8 hearts, requiring the gifting of 6 Nectar and 2 Ambrosia total.\nFavor.\nCompleting Hypnos' favor involves witnessing a series of events between him and Thanatos. To start, Hypnos will tell Zagreus that Thanatos has said some things to him that make him feel as though he's displeased his brother, and Zagreus states he will talk to Thanatos on Hypnos' behalf.\nAfter Zagreus confronts Thanatos about Hypnos, periodically between runs Zagreus will encounter the brothers engaged in conversation. Thanatos will repeatedly criticize Hypnos' work ethic until finally seeming to discover a way to help Hypnos focus. Later, Thanatos praises the quality of his brother's improved work and apologizes for treating him badly. Afterward Hypnos will thank Zagreus for speaking to Thanatos, completing his favor.\nOther characters shall comment on the quality of Hypnos' work, such as &lt;a href=\"Dusa\"&gt;Dusa&lt;/a&gt; asking Hypnos how he managed to keep the shades orderly and moving swiftly, only for him to refuse to divulge his secrets, and state that he shall one day have his picture on the wall in the Lounge.\nAutograph from the Minotaur.\nAfter dying for the first time while facing &lt;a href=\"Asterius\"&gt;Asterius&lt;/a&gt;\u2014whether as a miniboss or in the arena of &lt;a href=\"Elysium\"&gt;Elysium&lt;/a&gt;\u2014Hypnos will start asking Zagreus to get him an autograph from the Minotaur. In order to actually get him this autograph, Zagreus must first die a total of six times in order to hear six unique greetings from Hypnos: three of these require dying to Asterius himself, two require dying to &lt;a href=\"Theseus\"&gt;Theseus&lt;/a&gt;, and one requires dying in the final boss room of Elysium. The game tracks which of the two deals the final blow, but it doesn't matter if you have activated the Extreme Measures aspect of the &lt;a href=\"Pact%20of%20Punishment\"&gt;Pact of Punishment&lt;/a&gt;. After getting all six lines of dialogue from Hypnos, encountering Asterius as a miniboss will finally allow Zagreus to get Hypnos his prized autograph. \nIt says: \u201cTo Hypnos, my biggest fan, stay tuned\u201d with a small image of a bull. \nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\nMerchandise=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

I'm up, I'm up!\" - \"Hypnos being woken up by Zagreus.\"\nConversations With &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;.\nHypnos will often talk with Zagreus after he dies. Detailing how he died, and to what. Even giving tips to him, of varying helpfulness.&lt;br&gt;\n Hypnos: \"Welcome to the House of Hades, where... wait I know \"you\"! Guess that means you died out there, huh? Well don't be sad, though, pretty much everybody dies sometime!\"\n Zagreus: \"Some of us more than others.\"\n - \"First time meeting Hypnos.\"\nHypnos: \"Hey, you're back! Wait, what happened?

Here's the thing, I keep asking around about them and no one seems to know what I'm talking about! Could you maybe describe them for me, please?\"&lt;br&gt;\n Zagreus: \"Suprise, Hypnos! I got you this.\"\n Hypnos: \"Whoa whoa whoa you can't bring it in here! Hah, just kidding, thanks!

You just plain died, like...nothing stabbed you, bludgeoned you, poisoned you, burned you, crushed you, blew you to bits, turned you to stone, but... you're back here! Must have been these Natural Causes mortals talk about!\"&lt;br&gt;\n-\"After successful escape\"\nHypnos: \"Natural Causes got you again,huh? That's a real shame, I mean, imagine one day you're just going about your business, and then ack!! You're dead!

What would it take for you to let me through the locked door down the hall?\"\n Hypnos: \"Oh, hahaha, that's a good one, you know I can't let you enter your father's private chambers anymore since you betrayed his trust and tried to run away from home! Sorry, Master's \n orders!\"\nHypnos: \"It's fun watching the Pool of Styx, you know? The ripples in the blood, and everything, and sometimes, somebody pops out of there, like you!

But, tell me something, any progress on that autograph request of mine?\n Zagreus: Nope, none whatsoever.\n Hypnos: The Minotaur killed you again, that must have been exciting, huh? \"So\", any chance you got that autograph for me, before you got destroyed? \n Zagreus: Sorry, no.\n Hypnos: Look, I have to say, I just don't think you have a real chance against both Theseus and the Minotaur, together! But, you might just have a chance to get the Minotaur's autograph for me, if maybe you ask nice or something?\n Zagreus: Hahaha, no.\n Hypnos: Good, you're back! So, prior to when Theseus killed you again back there, did you, by any chance, happen to ask his big bull buddy for an autograph for me, this time?\n Zagreus: Did not come up.\n Zagreus: Hey, Hypnos? This is for all the well-meaning advice you\u2019ve given me. A little something from a certain double-bladed-axe-wielding, bull-headed, oversized monster of a man who you admire?\n Hypnos: What\u2019s this, it\u2019s kind of hard to read the hand-writing, it says, no way\u2026 \"To Hypnos, my biggest fan.

Do you understand how little sense that makes?\n Hypnos: I'm just saying, maybe if you just, I don't know, had all the mortals die at the same time, it'd save you a bunch of trips, and then we'd have more time to spend together, huh?\n Thanatos: I don't know why I bother with you, honestly. Get back to work, and let me do the same.\n Zagreus: \"Oh...\"\nWith &lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt;.\n Megaera: ...Would you look at that, Hypnos. Care to repeat to me the unsolicited advice you just now offered, now that Zagreus is here?\n Hypnos: Oh, \"hahaha\", well, it is my custom to give pointers to our visitors, who come involuntarily, because, I do pick up a lot of bits and pieces, talking here to everyone! About, you \n know... dying?\n Megaera: Zagreus. He told me that I ought to evade more of your attacks next time.

{"id": "2517", "revid": "30965", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2517", "title": "Hypnos/Relationships", "text": "Family.\nNyx.\n&lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;: Hypnos' mother.&lt;br&gt;Hypnos appears to want a closer relationship with his mother, even though he's fully aware that their current work circumstances don't permit him to address her as \"mother\" at the workplace \u2014 a rule he breaks all the time. Nyx, on the other hand, has concerns about Hypnos' overdependence on her, which may be inhibiting his growth in the role of the Incarnation of Sleep.\nThis has led Nyx to try to avoid getting involved in too many conversations with Hypnos, which only exacerbates his feelings of isolation and loneliness. It has reached the point where Nyx praises Hypnos for his work, and he believes it is someone else (even considering Hades) praising him through their words, not his mother directly. \nHowever, Hypnos continues to express his love for his mother, with occasional comments about how she often ignores him. Nevertheless, as he takes on the role of the housekeeper and Nyx learns to be more open, there is still hope that she'll pay more attention to Hypnos, for the sake of his happiness.\nThanatos.\n&lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;: Hypnos' twin brother.&lt;br&gt;Hypnos yearns to spend more time with his brother, seeking to rekindle the relationship of twin brothers.\nHypnos' current interactions with his brother consist of Thanatos delivering long lectures on professional ethics and how to properly perform his duties, which Hypnos finds tedious monologues. However, Hypnos continues to express love and adoration for his brother, often wishing to spend even more time with him than he can. Unfortunately, the only response he receives is a cold look of disapproval. \nIn an attempt to capture Thanatos' attention, Hypnos suggests that Thanatos should eliminate all mortals at once so they can have more time together, with Thanatos quickly reprimanding the stupidity of his idea.\nHypnos nurtures familial concerns about his relationship with Thanatos, wondering if his brother truly cares for him or if disturbing his sleep is an intentional act. Although he doesn't worry much about what others think of him, he fears the rejection of his twin brother. Hypnos cares deeply for his brother and knows him well enough to recognize how overwhelmed Thanatos is, even if he denies it or doesn't seem that way, and in turn offers that Thanatos should come and relax with him.\nEventually as Hypnos becomes more productive in his tasks at the House, Thanatos is surprised and praises him, even if not directly. Thanatos also reevaluates how hard he has been on him, and their relationship begins to gradually improve.\nCharon.\n&lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;: Hypnos' older brother.&lt;br&gt;Hypnos respects, greatly esteems, and fears his brother Charon, often referring to him in terms of fraternity, unlike Thanatos, who always approaches him professionally, with few mentions of their family relationship. And despite being constantly occupied with his constant tasks, he is always there, available to discipline him, often by hitting him on the head with a shovel.\nHypnos is surprised that Charon killed Zagreus, saying it's not like his brother, even though he's been smacked by Charon a few times.\nHypnos acknowledges Charon's effort and strength and praises him to Zagreus, saying that he knows him well enough to know that he has a lot of upper body strength, 'and those arms didn't get defined for no reason, right? They got so strong from rowing,' and tells Zagreus that rowing is not as easy a task as he might think.\nNemesis.\n&lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;: Hypnos' sister.&lt;br&gt;\nMoros.\n&lt;a href=\"Moros\"&gt;Moros&lt;/a&gt;: Hypnos' brother.&lt;br&gt;\nEris.\n&lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt;: Hypnos' sister.&lt;br&gt;\nThe Fates.\n&lt;a href=\"Fates\"&gt;The Fates&lt;/a&gt;: Hypnos' sisters.&lt;br&gt;\nChaos.\n&lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt;: Hypnos' grandparent.&lt;br&gt;\nHouse of Hades.\nZagreus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;: Hypnos' colleague.&lt;br&gt;Hypnos is the first to greet Zagreus whenever he emerges from the Pool of Styx. As a member of the team responsible for recording details of deceased shades and their deaths, Hypnos knows precisely how Zagreus died and offers (often unhelpful) advice on how to avoid a specific death or handle a particular enemy in the future.\nAfter numerous deaths, due to the often solitary journey, Zagreus grows increasingly close to Hypnos. Hypnos is equally happy to converse with Zagreus, who seems to appreciate his company. Zagreus is one of the few who genuinely enjoys talking to Hypnos and does not find him overly irritating, whenever the Prince emerges from the Pool of Styx, waking up startled but smiling and waving. Zagreus eventually also helps him patch things up with Thanatos.\nThe transformation of Hypnos from an initial annoyance into a dear friend showcases the power of understanding and empathy. Zagreus learns to appreciate Hypnos for who he is, and in turn, Hypnos begins to regard Zagreus as his \"best friend.\" This evolving friendship adds a layer of warmth and humanity to the rich tapestry of relationships within the world of Hades.\nMegaera.\n&lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt;: Hypnos' colleague.&lt;br&gt;Hypnos seems to have a soft spot for the Punishing Fury. When Megaera emerged from the River Styx, she appeared to be Hypnos' \"dream woman,\" and though he initially brushed it off, she offered him the same kind of advice she gave to Zagreus. With each visit from Meg, Hypnos began to develop a growing fondness for her, seeing her as a kind of lone wolf, an incredibly tough figure.\nWhile he had always held her as invincible, that pedestal began to crack, and the cracks deepened with each defeat to Zagreus, despite her \"amazing advice.\" In this way, Hypnos allowed himself to believe that Meg died more frequently just to see him exclusively, as if they had some kind of platonic connection. He began to notice subtle changes in her behavior\u2014the occasional smiles she reserved just for him and how her eyes lingered a bit longer in his presence\u2014leading him to deduce that she felt the same way.\nThough Hypnos no longer sees her as invincible, especially after she rejected his advances, he is content to be a close friend to her. He cherishes the moments they spend together, even though they are now just friends, and he is grateful for the special bond they share, managing to even draw a smile from her.\nHades.\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;: Hypnos' boss.&lt;br&gt;Hypnos was hired by Hades as a receptionist, most likely as a favor upon the request of his mother, Nyx. He probably receives many comments from Hades comparing him to his brother, Thanatos. However, unlike his brother, Hypnos is extremely loyal to Hades and values his boss' opinions.\nHypnos seems to be aware that Hades could dismiss him at any moment if he \"slips up again,\" which nearly happens, even though he's not very cautious most of the time.\nAs Hypnos improves his work, everyone begins to praise him, to the point where even Hypnos believes he deserves compliments from Hades for the excellent job he's doing. This eventually leads to Hypnos having his face on the employee recognition board, something that Hypnos takes great pride in.\nDusa.\n&lt;a href=\"Dusa\"&gt;Dusa&lt;/a&gt;: Hypnos' colleague.&lt;br&gt;She is efficient and he is lazy, but they seem to have a friendly disposition. As Hypnos becomes more productive, he is praised by his brother and also by Dusa for his good service.\nUnderworld Residents.\nAsterius.\n&lt;a href=\"Asterius\"&gt;Asterius&lt;/a&gt;: Champion of Elysium.&lt;br&gt;He is a big fan of Asterius and pleads for an autograph from Zagreus if he dies to him. This prompts Zagreus to request an autograph from Asterius before their mid-boss fight, which Asterius obliges. However, he informs Zagreus that the favor is for him and not for Hypnos. In his autograph for Hypnos, Asterius writes, \"To Hypnos, my biggest fan. Stay vigilant. Asterius.\" It also includes a small image of a bull. Hypnos is delighted with the attention from his idol."}

While both were imprisoned in Crete, Daedalus created a pair of wings and gave them to Icarus. Drunk on the freedom that he'd received, Icarus flew too close to the sun, which made the wax that held the wings in place melt and let him fall to his death.\nHe appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;\" and offers his Inventions to Melino\u00eb in her fight against &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;. He can be encountered on the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Thessaly\"&gt;Rift of Thessaly&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nIcarus is a curious and humbled young soul who aspires to be just as great an inventor as his father. The events of his death taught him a great deal of humility and caution, but he will still fly out of the Underworld if he feels that the living need help. Before his death, he was an impatient, stubborn, and reckless young boy, and it was this arrogance that led him to his downfall, along with his dreams, transforming into a shadow of what he once was.\nHe will provide Melino\u00eb with his latest inventions on her journey as he found purpose in helping her. Icarus is very shy, and his interactions are overly friendly with Melino\u00eb, calling her Meli\". Despite his shy and reserved nature, he doesn't let his modesty fade, even with all the help he's offering. When he makes an obstinately appearance in from the sky, he launches explosives everywhere, combating Melino\u00eb's enemies in a quite flashy way if he wants to. However internally, Icarus has always felt that everything he does ends in disaster and feels guilty for the loss of Melino\u00eb's arm, despite Melino\u00eb not blaming him for the incident.\nNevertheless, he still wishes to be helpful and will confront his fears by creating inventions to aid in Melino\u00eb's journey, becoming an invaluable ally and friend for the princess.\nPhysical Description.\nDespite being a shade, Icarus still maintains the appearance of a human boy when he was alive, thanks to Melino\u00eb. He is very pale, thin, with dark circles giving him a sickly appearance, and his eyes are golden caramel. His hair is short and brown.\nHistory.\nBefore Hades II.\nIcarus lived in the Crossroads where he met Melino\u00eb and became friends.

Melino\u00eb tried to with an incantation using &lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt;'s cauldron but the endeavor ended in failure which cost Melino\u00eb her left arm. Icarus felt guilty for the accident and left the Crossroads. During his time away, he managed to build his own pair of wings that he uses to fight the armies of Chronos and help the living on the surface.\nHades II.\nIcarus appears on the Rift of Thessaly and lends Melino\u00eb some of his own inventions. In a conversation with Melino\u00eb, Icarus reveals that his father has retired and that he is the one that has been dropping the &lt;a href=\"Daedalus%20Hammer\"&gt;Daedalus Hammer&lt;/a&gt;s that Melino\u00eb finds.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;"}

Before you say anything, I know I'm not supposed to be here, but I spotted this ship and had to drop in for a closer look. And now I'm going to take off! So let's pretend this never happened, hey?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Hold it right there, Icarus! I'm not about to let you just fly out on me again without a chat at least. To start with, what are you doing in the middle of this blasted war?\"\n Icarus : \n\"The same thing I've \"been \"doing: slowing these bastards down. If everyone like me pitched in a little bit, this war would have been well over by now.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"That may be so. But this is a matter between gods and Titans. I wouldn't want you to get hurt.\"\n Icarus : \n\"Bit late for that, Meli! Anyway, I've kept you for too long, but let me give you something I've been working on before I go \u2014 and these all work. I swear!\"\nKeepsake Dialogue (&lt;a href=\"Experimental%20Hammer\"&gt;Experimental Hammer&lt;/a&gt;).\n Icarus : \n\"You brought along the little Hammer from me, hey? First one I ever made! First that was any good, at least. Sort of a funny process, making things for making things...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Icarus, how could you give me this? You should hold onto it, as a reminder of how far you've come as a creator. I would have figured this to be one of your father's masterworks...!\"\n Icarus : \n\"It's much more special in your care than mine. Creating tools that others can use to reach new heights... that's how I reach them myself. You're doing me a solid here, Meli!\"\nPicking the Keepsake in The Chest.\nTBA\nAbouth the Scenery.\nTBA\nMiscellaneous Conversations.\nDialogue 01.\n Icarus : \n\"Been flying for a while now! At first, it brought me back to the terror I felt as a kid. Those final moments... I wanted to put myself through them, again and again. Don't know why.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Icarus, you were young and you made a mistake. What's the use torturing yourself for it for all eternity? I thought you wanted to learn to fly to prove yourself to your father.\"\n Icarus : \n\"Come on, Meli. I'm never going to prove myself to him. But something happened as I kept trying to use my wings... I, I started to like it! Seeing from a different point of view.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You look so in your element up there! I always believed, if I could make you whole again, perhaps some night we'd learn to fly together. I still want to feel what it's like.\"\n Icarus : \n\"You've no idea know how much I wanted that too. But, it was something I had to do on my own. I'd offer to take you up with me now, but... yeah, Shades and goddesses don't mix.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You know, you've changed. You seem... more full of life. I catch these glimpses of your face while you're in flight, and... it's like there's a joy in you I never saw before.\"\n Icarus : \n\"\"Heh\", well... there's the flying, which admittedly doesn't get old... and then there's seeing you, taking on the legions of Chronos single-handedly. Using all your training. \"Wow...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I didn't take them on single-handedly, Icarus, but... it's good to know about the flying! It must be exhilarating.\"\n Icarus : \n\"It is, Meli. You could always see right through me so no point in trying to sell it short. I hope some night you'll get a shot at it and tell me what you think.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"If you love flying so much, why do you keep helping me? Once my father's throne is restored, the gates of the Underworld will shut, and you'll be forced to return.\"\n Icarus : \n\"I know. I would miss flying, sure. But, I think I could live without it if I had to \u2014 \"exist \"without it, you know what I mean. My plan is just to make the most of it, for now. We mortals are taught to believe nothing lasts forever anyway.\"\nAbout Returning.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You said yourself you're not supposed to be here, Icarus. Chronos may have flung open the Underworld gates, but your place is still below with us. Come back.\"\n Icarus : \n\"...I always messed everything up, you know. I just want to be useful to someone, for once! So please... let me stay here. Let me have this!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Icarus : \n\"The wretches on these ships don't have their wits, but they hit hard. I, I know you're good and everything, \"better \"than good, it's just... if things go bad... what happens to you then?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"The first thing Headmistress taught me was how not to give in. If my strength is failing me, I use it to return to shadow whence I came. Almost a reflex at this point.\"\n Icarus : \n\"And then at the Crossroads, you're up and about by the following night, raring to go? Too bad you can't return-to-shadow back to where you left off...\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt; Curse.\n Icarus : \n\"Wait, what are you even \"doing \"here? I thought you were supposed to be bound to the Underworld, but here you are, commandeering warships and whatnot!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I am still bound there, I just loosened the bindings a bit. Though I feel absolutely wretched now, so if the legions of Chronos don't stop me soon, my blood-curse surely will.\"\n Icarus : \n\"Really? Because you look great! \"Erm\", you look... you look \"well\", I mean. Unafflicted by a curse of any sort. Maybe a little seasick is all! Just, take one of these hey?\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Daedalus\"&gt;Daedalus&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"How fares your father, by the way? You've no idea how happy I am to find Daedalus Hammers out there... I never see him around, so can never thank him in person.\"\n Icarus : \n\"\"Heh! \"I'll be sure to send him your regards when next I happen to run into him, though it's been a little while. I'm glad his Hammers have been of some use. Have another?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Icarus : \n\"You asked about my father the other night... and truth is, though you probably already know, I never see him around either. I think he might have retired!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Daedalus, \"retired? \"I just found one of his Hammers earlier! He's been of constant help to me since all this started, he... wait... \"what...?\"\n Icarus : \n\"Meli, I'm his apprentice! He'd been building for a long time and needed a break. I'm nowhere near him but it's not like there was anybody else... The Hammers come in handy though?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Stop, you're hurting my head. The \"Daedalus Hammers \"I've been finding are from \"you? \"Shouldn't they be \"Icarus \"Hammers then?\"\n Icarus : \n\"\"Erm\", we have a certain reputation to uphold. Not sure slapping my name on my father's designs would do us any good. Please... don't go telling anyone about this hey?\"\nDialogue 03.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You made your own wings, munitions, apparently the latest Daedalus Hammers... you've become quite the craftsman!\"\n Icarus : \n\"Come on, Meli. My father was a master by the time he was my age, even before I died. I'll never surpass him.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"That's not what I've said. Your work is your own, and it's good! Better than good. When are you finally going to step out from your father's shadow?\"\n Icarus : \n\"Funny question coming from you! My father may not be a god... but he's probably the greatest artist and inventor that ever lived. He'd be the first to say I'll never reach his level. Anyway, I'm through trying to prove myself to him.\"\nAbout Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;.\n Icarus : \n\"Your arm...! Never got better, did it? I'm really sorry, I should never have put you on the spot.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Not your fault. I had... grown very confident in my abilities. Headmistress always said there was no way to make Shades whole again, but I thought otherwise. Overextended, learned a lesson I'm not going to forget.\"\n Icarus : \n\"I felt so bad... couldn't look at anybody in the Crossroads anymore. Thought I'd never see you again. That it'd be for the best. I... had a lot I needed to sort out.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"And how did it go? You learned to fly, at least! Top of your list of fears, conquered. With your father's wings, no less!\"\n Icarus : \n\"These wings are mine, Meli. That was all part of it. Had to learn to do things for myself, like you did. And for what it's worth, I still think your arm looks amazing. Now, here.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt;.\n Icarus : \n\"The other night, I saw these huge black wings on the horizon; definitely \"not \"a Harpy. Could have sworn it was bloody Eris... but, wasn't she still at the Crossroads, with you?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Well I'm not at the Crossroads either, but... unfortunately Strife Incarnate has been getting in my way. So she showed up around the time I did?\"\n Icarus : \n\"Come to think of it, yes! \"Whew...! \"I was beginning to worry she was here because of something \"I \"did. Never occurred to me she was just following you around, same as ever.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Odysseus\"&gt;Odysseus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Icarus : \n\"How's everybody back at the Crossroads lately hey? Master Odysseus putting all his plans to action at long last?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Oh, yes. My route through here is thanks only to him. Say, he didn't put you up to this, did he? Deploying Shades with makeshift wings and explosives seems like something the Great Tactician would do...\"\n Icarus : \n\"I'm acting on my own. Although maybe we're all part of the Great Tactician's plan and just don't realize it yet. He always said we'll have to improvise... might be I finally took it to heart.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;.\n Icarus : \n\"Something happened since the last time you were here... these ships, one after another they all \"sank! \"Never seen these waters so calm. \"Did you...?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Did I reach Chronos in my father's House and slay him? Yes. And, did he then reconstitute himself, perhaps entirely negating whatever I achieved? Also, yes.\"\n Icarus : \n\"I always knew you'd get him, Meli. Well as you can see his risen fleet has risen once again! Though sounds to me like you've found one of its weaknesses.\"\nWith Other Characters.\nTBA\nGifts.\n&lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You can fly wherever you want now! But, I'm glad you didn't go so far I couldn't catch up. Here! In light of your godlike wings, a little gift.\"\n Icarus : \n\"Oh come on, just because I've been flying around near Olympus, doesn't mean I get to feast like I'm from there! Maybe with your permission, hey? Know what, I got something for you, too.\"\n\"Icarus gives &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Experimental%20Hammer\"&gt;Experimental Hammer&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Is this one of your inventions? Amazing! Thank you...!\"\n2nd Time.\n Icarus : \n\"The last Nectar you got me was \"so \"good, can't even imagine what it would have been like while I was still alive. Wasn't going to ask for another, but... since you're offering!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'm offering, so here! Maybe it's even better now that you're a Shade. You mortals had to eat and drink out of necessity. But Nectar helps fulfill a different kind of need.\"\n3rd Time.\n Icarus : \n\"As a mortal kid confined to a tower, I was relatively well provided for, but \"this? \"I know better than to envy the gods, especially with what they're going through lately... but they definitely know their drink.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"The gods have always lived well... but your own life was so short and difficult. You must still have a lot of making up to do, and I thought maybe this could help!\""}

Initially, only the &lt;a href=\"Stygian%20Blade\"&gt;Stygian Blade&lt;/a&gt; is available, but additional weapons can be unlocked by spending &lt;a href=\"Chthonic%20Key\"&gt;Chthonic Keys&lt;/a&gt; in the Arsenal Room. Unlocking all the weapons requires a total of 24 &lt;a href=\"Chthonic%20Key\"&gt;Chthonic Keys&lt;/a&gt;. They can be upgraded during a run with a &lt;a href=\"Daedalus%20Hammer\"&gt;Daedalus Hammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach weapon has a number of \"Aspects\" that can be unlocked using &lt;a href=\"Titan%20Blood\"&gt;Titan Blood&lt;/a&gt;. Aspects become available one run after the Rail has been unlocked and the player has collected at least one Titan Blood.\nThe infernal arms are the weapons the Olympians used to defeat the Titans. The Olympians bound them afterwards to prevent their use, but the arms are supposedly the strongest or some of the strongest weapons that exist in the universe which is why they are supposed to be locked away. Why exactly they appear in the courtyard is unknown, but some of the weapon descriptions found in the &lt;a href=\"Codex\"&gt;Codex&lt;/a&gt; suggests Achilles might have had some influence.\nBecause of their history with titan blood they both react to it when it is collected and seem to have developed some form of consciousness.\nThey are the sister weapons of the &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal%20Arms\"&gt;Nocturnal Arms&lt;/a&gt; and were created by a group of ancient cyclopean forger-masters in accordance to the design ordained by &lt;a href=\"Fates\"&gt;The Fates&lt;/a&gt;.\nHidden Aspects.\nEach weapon has a hidden aspect based on myths from a culture other than Greece, which requires a secret phrase to 'wake' it and reveal the option. The spear's aspect must be unlocked first; once it is revealed, revealing the others becomes possible. (Paying to unlock the spear's hidden aspect is not necessary.) Each phrase comes from a different character, and does not require that the correct weapon be wielded while interacting with that character. However, several weapons require that you first have a conversation with the same character while wielding the correct weapon, and only after that conversation occurs is the later conversation with the secret phrase accessible. In most cases the character who conveys the phrase is thematically related to the weapon and therefore can be guessed. (It is not possible for the player to enter the phrases manually, Zagreus must learn them diegetically.)\nFor the spear, Zagreus must have reached the surface and must unlock several aspects of his various weapons. For the others, substantial upgrades of the weapon in question are required. Details appear below, collapsed for those who prefer to discover it themselves, organized in approximate ascending order of difficulty."}

After ten years of marriage, Jason annulled his marriage to her and chose instead to wed the daughter of the King of Corinth. As vengeance, Medea killed Jason's new bride and her own sons by him, ensuring that he would have no heir.\nMedea appears in &lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt; and offers her Nightly Curses to &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; in her fight against &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;. She can be encountered on the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Ephyra\"&gt;City of Ephyra&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nMedea is an eccentric, cunning and sadistic dark witch who conjures spells to cause harm, inflicting revenge against those who retaliate against Melino\u00eb. She is passionate about making potions with strange effects, even testing them herself. Medea's concoctions make even Melino\u00eb hesitate, as does Medea's constant delight in poisonous air and the abundant bones she collects, eagerly awaiting what will happen.\nMedea prefers to work alone, and excels at it. She is very confident, feared, especially when contrasted with the friendlier temperament of her aunt Circe. But, in reality, she is on Hecate's side, acting as her eyes and supporting the gods against Chronos.\nPhysical description.\nMedea is depicted as a striking-looking woman. Her eyes are bright green, with one covered by her long, straight black hair, and her lips are vivid red. She has very pale skin.\nShe adorns a moon shaped headband with green tassels, further decorated with small moons. She wears a black dress with green details and silver moons on top, forming a small boob window and enclosing her neck. She also has small silver pauldrons on her shoulders and spiked armbands and wristbands, with the armbands' spikes being noticebly bigger. She has a black shawl hanging loose her right arm. Medea holds a bloody knife in her left hand and is seen using her magic to make a chalice float with her other hand; this chalice has some red magic coming out of it.\nHistory.\nBefore Hades II.\nMedea is the daughter of Ae\u00ebtes and Idyia, and from her father's side a descendant of Helios and niece of &lt;a href=\"Circe\"&gt;Circe&lt;/a&gt;. Her aunt taught her some of the magic she now possesses, and despite their differences, they both care for one another.\nShe helped Jason back in the day, during his Argonauts adventures, and eventually married him, but was later betrayed and in a rage, killed their children and left him. Now she resents others as a result of her past.\nMedea occasionally helped &lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt; raise Melino\u00eb when the Titan Goddess came to be in such a predicament, and has vowed to stand guard at the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Ephyra\"&gt;City of Ephyra&lt;/a&gt; during their plight with &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;. Here, she continues her researches, using the enmies of the region for her own deeds.\nHades II.\n&lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; can come across Medea as she walks through the City of Ephyra. The witch will gladly lends some of her &lt;a href=\"Medea/Nightly%20Curses\"&gt;Nightly Curses&lt;/a&gt; to aid the princess in her climb.

Welcome to Ephyra. Suffering spreads every which way you cast your gaze, and on a night most foul. Simply appalling, no?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Indeed, Lady Medea. Unfortunately, I can only appreciate the suffering for so long, as Olympus calls. Though, how fares your research?\"\n Medea : \n\"Oh, I've been \"dying \"to show you! The air here's \"absolutely \"poisonous. The conditions? Utterly atrocious! Observe what I have wrought...\"\nInside &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;.\n Medea : \n\"So many more shades of the dead now linger here! And the earthy aroma, quite unlike before. These Crossroads changed since last I visited!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Welcome back to the abode, Lady Medea. What brings you here, and will you be staying with us for a little while?\"\n Medea : \n\"No, I am Great Hecate's eyes upon the surface. But the night is young, and I've business with the Broker there; a surplus of Bones to exchange. See you above and below, sorceress.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"See you.\"\nBasic Narrative Dialogue.\nChanting.\nChanting 01.\n\"\"O wand'ring dead who cannot find your peace,\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"\"I bid you listen closely to my voice.\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"\"The moment at which mortal life does cease\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"\"Is not for your despair, but to rejoice!\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"\"For I can lead you to where you belong,\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"\"Beneath the earth where Death and Sleep reside,\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"\"I bid you merely serve me for a song,\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"\"Unto the will of the Unseen, confide.\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"\"...So mote it be.\"\nChanting 02.\n\"\"To all the enemies of Hades, near and far,\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"\"May ravens strip you of your flesh and eyes,\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"\"All your extremities sent to a pickle-jar,\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"\"And beetles spit up from your mouths of lies.\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"\"Whether you dwell upon the surface or below,\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"\"Your every step shall be with stabbing pain.\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"\"No peace or mercy you shall ever know,\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"\"Ere you repent, and die and die again.\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"\"...So mote it be.\"\nKeepsake Dialogue (&lt;a href=\"Blackened%20Fleece\"&gt;Blackened Fleece&lt;/a&gt;).\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Thank you again for the gift, Lady Medea. This bit of fleece is extraordinary, isn't it... and very soft!\"\n Medea : \n\"You have the blackened tuft of wool I gave to you! It once shone golden as the sun. But I saw fit to modify its properties, to make it better serve sorceresses such as we...\"\nPicking the Keepsake in The Chest.\nTBA\nAbout the Scenery.\n&lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Ephyra\"&gt;City of Ephyra&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"How long have you resided here, Lady Medea? I thought all our forces fled once the city was overrun, but you seem rather comfortable.\"\n Medea : \n\"Oh, yes! All the death and panic made for many vacancies. I slipped in through the shadows soon after the city fell, and remained, practicing, observing... Great Hecate has eyes upon the surface \"everywhere...\"\nMiscellaneous Conversations.\nAbout Foes.\n Medea : \n\"\"Ah\", the sorceress returns. Not had your fill of this putrescent atmosphere? Or merely not succeeded yet in breaking the Titan's siege?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Not succeeded yet. Chronos can replenish his forces as quickly as Olympus can repel them. Have you found any weaknesses in their ranks?\"\n Medea : \n\"They cannot be permanently slain, are barely susceptible to my most noxious poisons, and are single-minded in their devotion to the Titan Lord. Any of those sound like weaknesses?\"\nAbout Blood.\n Medea : \n\"I have to thank you, sorceress! After you last rampaged throughout this city, I obtained a sample of your blood. Oh, it's very potent stuff!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"Erm\", you're welcome, Lady Medea. Although, moving forward, please ask me prior to using my lifeblood as part of your experiments.\"\n Medea : \n\"How about I use it anyway but never mention doing so again? Fear not, I use it only toward a common outcome we desire...!\"\nAbout Poisons.\n Medea : \n\"Vast is the breadth of our craft, isn't it, sorceress? For all your studies with Great Hecate, I suspect you've scarce learned anything about \"my \"areas of expertise...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You're right that my experience is no match for yours, Lady Medea. I've spent very little time with mortals... still-living ones, that is.\"\n Medea : \n\"Of late, I'm spending little time with the still-living ones, myself. Most are highly susceptible to insinuation, or at least to certain types of toxins, easily administered in food or drink.\"\nAbout The Undead.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"The Shades about this place... they're trapped in the decaying bodies of their mortal selves, aren't they? Unable to travel to my father's realm.\"\n Medea : \n\"I know, right? This is a \"revolution \"in the necromantic arts! These shuffling wretches, trapped on the very verge of death... I could study them for moons and moons on end!\"\nAbout Vengeance.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You work so tirelessly at your craft, Lady Medea. If I may ask, where do you find the strength for your pursuits night after night?\"\n Medea : \n\"It's very much straightforward, sorceress. I seek to punish all who wronged me, in proportion to the harm they caused. Though have no fear, you're not on any list of mine!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Have you been wronged so often that you need more than one list of wrongdoers? What happens when you've cursed them all?\"\n Medea : \n\"My lists are based on categories of affront; from mere dislikes, to deep betrayals. As for what happens after I've achieved my work... I'll have to get back to you on that one.\"\nAbout Reputation.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You know, for all the dread and despair everywhere I turn, you've come to be a welcome sight, Lady Medea. I'm pleased to know you a bit better now.\"\n Medea : \n\"Do not profess to know me, sorceress. You know my reputation, and express surprise that I do not appear as cruel as it suggests. Yet the greatest cruelties can be cleverly disguised...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I meant no offense. I don't profess to know you well at all, only to say I look forward to our encounters. As for your reputation, I care little for what others say of those such as us.\"\n Medea : \n\"Perhaps you ought care more, for we are rightly to be feared. And there are those who'd turn upon us, sullying our names, or worse. Safeguard your trust, is my advice to you.\"\nAbout Optimism.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Your curses have been of great help, Lady Medea. Though if only I had your optimism. You're always smiling, even in such a place as this.\"\n Medea : \n\"What's not to like? No shortage here of blood for my research, and the dead are wise enough to stay afield of me. Now here, let's cast another curse and you'll be right as rot!\"\nAbout Witchcraft.\n Medea : \n\"How much has changed with time. It's not as often that I see familiar faces such as yours, or hateful ones. So many fail to understand our ways.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You've always seemed to have ways of making them understand, Lady Medea. Though do you find you miss living among mortals?\"\n Medea : \n\"Locating live subjects for my research used to be easier, but that exception notwithstanding, no. A few true friends are better than a thousand friendly-feigning strangers.\"\nAbout Solitude.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You're always on your own, Lady Medea. Are there no family members or loved ones who could be accompanying you in your... experiments?\"\n Medea : \n\"Oh they are with me, in a way; their spirits or their memories. But why suggest that solitude's in need of remedy? There can be times when one could use companionship, but such impulses can be sated, case-by-case.\"\nAbout Suffering.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You must know a great deal about mortals. How they live, suffer, and die. Have you found ways to ease their passing, at least?\"\n Medea : \n\"Whyever would I do a thing like that? Great Hecate herself says that the greatest teacher is out \"there. \"To suffer is to learn! I merely wish to become a good teacher, myself.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Mortal cries of anguish and despair do nothing to move you to compassion, or to mercy at least? I find them quite unnerving.\"\n Medea : \n\"You learn to close your heart to all of it. No mortal has a right to live for long! Certainly there exist those whose skill is to ease suffering; I merely seek to understand its cause.\"\nAbout Curses.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"What gives your incantations such great potency, Lady Medea? So many curses have intangible effects, yet yours pierce like a blade...\"\n Medea : \n\"A well-wrought curse requires suitable reagents, and pure intention without compromise. Any hesitancy, any second-guessing undermines an ill effect.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"That I understand... it's the pure intent toward misfortune that I struggle to achieve. How can one wish such ill upon another, without imagining some of it turning back one's way?\"\n Medea : \n\"With practice, sorceress! Ill intent does threaten to reflect back upon oneself, often with greater potency. But with the blackest of intent... there's nothing to reflect at all.\"\nAbout Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt;.\n Medea : \n\"How fares Great Hecate amid such inauspicious nights? Scarce has she had occasion lately to illuminate this place...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Headmistress seems well enough. I've not once seen hardship ever get to her. But then, perhaps she wears that veil of hers so as to never show even a trace of doubt.\"\n Medea : \n\"We all wear veils, don't we, sorceress? Great Hecate, she merely puts aside all pretenses about it. Well, good to know that she is still herself. And I remain her humble servant, here.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Heracles\"&gt;Heracles&lt;/a&gt;.\n Medea : \n\"I meant to warn you, by the way, to not engage with the big burly lion-maned fellow who sometimes stalks about the streets out there...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You must mean Heracles. We've already met, and I gathered that I ought to keep my distance. He says he serves the gods but... he's a threat?\"\n Medea : \n\"Oh, he's just a big downer! I cure his injuries yet still he incurs more, and not even \"I \"possess the power yet to cure his spirit. The dead have more cheer than a man like that. Now, come! I've curses to concoct.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Circe\"&gt;Circe&lt;/a&gt;.\n Medea : \n\"How absurd, the very idea of family, sorceress. That we've some innate bond with those who share some of our blood! You've met my Aunt Circe; do you believe that we're at all alike?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Madame Circe seems very devoted to our craft in her own right. Just, not in the same way as you, Lady Medea. Are you so loath to think that you may have something in common?\"\n Medea : \n\"Circe was never willing to push our practice to the depths of what it can achieve. She would turn mortals into livestock; \"I \"would turn them dead. A differing approach is all, perhaps...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;.\n Medea : \n\"\"Ah! \"You bear the light of Apollo himself! Well, just remember that he's not the only one who can create a decent plague around here.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Apollo certainly has a broad range of talents. So, he would sometimes cast down plagues on mortalkind? Do you know why?\"\n Medea : \n\"Why do the gods do anything at all? Simply because they can! Besides, a good plague now and then helps keep the common stock in line.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt;.\n Medea : \n\"Glorious Hera has opted to lend to you her power, if my senses don't deceive. You're family of hers, and come to her defense. Perhaps she shall be favorable to you!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"She has been thus far. I know the gods can take care of themselves, but we seem to have a mutual understanding and a shared interest at the moment.\"\n Medea : \n\"How mercenary. And the proper posture with the gods, I think! You needn't second-guess my aid. Great Hecate wills it, so it shall be yours.\"\nWith Other Characters.\nTBA\nGifts.\n&lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I almost pity our enemies, knowing you shall make them rue each night they dare oppose us, Lady Medea. Please, I wanted you to have this.\"\n Medea : \n\"The Nectar of the gods! Why, this shall be most useful to my work. For the strongest curses come from honeyed words!

{"id": "395", "revid": "55390750", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=395", "title": "Megaera", "text": "Megaera is one of the three sisters &lt;a href=\"Furies\"&gt;Furies&lt;/a&gt;. She is the older sister of &lt;a href=\"Tisiphone\"&gt;Tisiphone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alecto\"&gt;Alecto&lt;/a&gt;, being responsible for punishing adulterers, oathbreakers, and thieves. She is sent by &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; to stop &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; from escaping the Underworld. Zagreus must defeat her before progressing to &lt;a href=\"Asphodel\"&gt;Asphodel&lt;/a&gt; during any given escape attempt.\nAfter her first defeat, Megaera will join the House of Hades as a &lt;a href=\"Characters\"&gt;character&lt;/a&gt; that can be interacted with, though she will still attempt to stop Zagreus from entering Asphodel. She will be found drinking in the House's lounge, but only after a run in which she was defeated; if the lounge has yet to be re-opened, she will instead hang around in the hallway, on the opposite side of Zagreus's door from where Nyx usually stands.\nApparently, she has been tasked with handling matters in Tartarus apart from her sisters; this includes dealing with Zagreus. According to Megaera, a war amongst the mortals has made the Underworld particularly busy, and her sisters are handling matters elsewhere.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nMegaera is confident, obstinate, and conducts her work with perfection. She has a special hatred for oath-breakers and takes joy in torturing them for eternity. Despite her composure, her pleasure in punishing them is evident.\nMegaera disapproves of all the chaos that &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; is causing in the Underworld and dislikes his challenging nature. She doesn't want to stop him, but his continued rebellion forces her into a position she hates. &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt; trusts her, and her dutiful, law-abiding nature won't stop her from challenging orders if she has a good reason to do so. Zagreus refers to her as his \"ex,\" and both admit that he was responsible. Although Meg does not hold any resentment about it, she will unload her frustration on Zagreus.\nWhen she's off duty, she tends to relax inside the Lounge and interact with other underlings of Hades, notably &lt;a href=\"Dusa\"&gt;Dusa&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers her 'best friend'. Among her sisters, she's the most balanced, sane, and calm, and often gets irritated with their mischiefs. Megaera has a cold gaze, but also has a sweet side towards her friends and towards Zagreus. Outside of the battle against her, she is friendly with him and asserts that she is just doing her job, not for personal reasons. \nMegaera has a competitive side, taking note of her wins or losses against Zagreus. She doesn't take losing to him well, but her battles against him fuel a friendly rivalry between the two, not a vendetta. Even if Megaera pleads, whether she wants it or not, if she can't handle the task, her younger sisters will be contacted by Hades in her place, which she considers as extreme measures. Despite appearing relentless, even she can have a fragile side. After a stressful day, in the arms of &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;, she'll express her work-related frustrations.\nPhysical description.\nMegaera exudes a stern but alluring presence with her yellow eyes, pale blue skin, and slightly darker blue hair pulled back into a long ponytail. A large, bat-like wing protrudes from the right side of her back, with the inside being black and blue and the outside pink and red. She has bright pink lips, fingernails, and toenails. Her attire consists of dark gray and deep blue robes adorned with gold plates on her calves, shoulders, and right wrist. Additionally, she wears gold earrings, a headpiece, and piercings in her left nostril and eyebrow. She wears coordinate clothing like her sisters, primarily in shades of blue with gold accents. Megaera carries a bright pink leather whip as her weapon of choice.\nHades.\nMegaera, born from the blood of a &lt;a href=\"Titan%20Blood\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;, was the first of the &lt;a href=\"Furies\"&gt;Furies&lt;/a&gt; to emerge from &lt;a href=\"Tartarus\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt;. She was created with the purpose of punishing transgressors, thieves, and especially those who committed adultery during their mortal lives.\nWhen Megaera grew up, &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;, whom she sees as a maternal figure, hired her alongside her sisters, &lt;a href=\"Tisiphone\"&gt;Tisiphone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alecto\"&gt;Alecto&lt;/a&gt;, to work in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt;. She has been a longtime friend of &lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, it seems that she had a relationship with &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;, which apparently ended. However, Megaera holds no grudges regarding the matter, and she and Zagreus have moved on, leading their respective lives.\nMegaera is the only Fury around at first, and Hades orders her to stop Zagreus's escape attempts. After she fails a few times, Hades will turn to her sisters, which greatly displeases her.\nWith time, Zagreus tries to rebuild a friendship with her, and eventually is successful. This leaves her at a tight spot, since she has to stop Zagreus at Hades's order, but doesn't really hate him and doesn't want him to think so.\nA situation may come up where Dusa is fired by Nyx. Since both are close, this greatly angers Megaera, and she reachs out to Zagreus to solve the situation, as he was partly the reason she was fired. Eventually, Dusa is re-hired, and both thank the prince for it.\nWith the family problems solved, and Zagreus's escape attempts becoming official securities checks, Megaera will continue to appear at the end of Tartarus to try to stop him, but now their fights are more like friendly banter.\nHades II.\nMegaera became &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;' prisoner after he took control of the Underworld.\nAffinity.\nIf given &lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;, Megaera will give you the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20Earring\"&gt;Skull Earring&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter giving Megaera 6 Nectar in total, you will be unable to give her any other gift until you complete a favor for her.\nOnce completing her favor, giving her &lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt; will earn you the &lt;a href=\"Companion%20Battie\"&gt;Companion Battie&lt;/a&gt;.\nMegaera's affinity gauge is maxed out at 10 hearts, requiring the gifting of 6 Nectar and 4 Ambrosia total.\nFavor.\nIn order to trigger the first encounter with Megaera in Zagreus' room (to collect her belongings), she must have been gifted at least 4 Nectar.\nAfter a random number of encounters with the Furies, Megaera will approach Zagreus in his room, and tell him that she's only stopping him from escaping because she has to. After this interaction, Megaera can receive Ambrosia the next time she is met in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is NOT necessary to enable the \"Extreme Measures\" condition of the &lt;a href=\"Pact%20of%20Punishment\"&gt;Pact of Punishment&lt;/a&gt;.\nRomance.\nReaching maximum affinity with Megaera will allow Zagreus to either begin a romantic relationship with her or continue as friends. &lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dusa\"&gt;Dusa&lt;/a&gt; and Megaera can all be romanced at the same time with no negative repercussions.\nIf Zagreus is able to fully romance both Megaera and Thanatos, another scene will be unlocked in Zagreus\u2019s Room, in which he, Megaera and Thanatos meet up and can begin a polyamorous relationship.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\nMerchandise=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

While Megaera dislikes her sisters' pranks, she finds Tisiphone easier to handle compared to Alecto. However, she worries about Tisiphone and considers her too sensitive for her stressful role, thinking that Tisiphone takes her job so seriously that she is exaggerating. Megaera wonders if the workload is overwhelming Tisiphone psychologically.\nAlecto.\n&lt;a href=\"Alecto\"&gt;Alecto&lt;/a&gt;: Megaera's younger sister.&lt;br&gt;Megaera didn't want things to be like this, but currently, Megaera is distant and doesn't seem to get along well with her sisters, the Furies, due to differences in personality and past interests. However, Megaera tells Zagreus that her youngest sister, Alecto, loves her work even more than she does. Despite Megaera being tired of her sisters' pranks and the trouble they have caused in the House of Hades, as well as their contrasting professional conduct, Alecto will cover for her sister if she can't handle the task.\nHouse of Hades.\nZagreus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;: Megaera's colleague.&lt;br&gt;Megaera and Zagreus were once in a relationship, but by the events of the game, this relationship has long since ended due to some mistake on Zagreus' part. They are shown to be on uneasy terms from that point on. When Zagreus begins his escape attempts, Megaera is tasked in stopping him. She disapproves of his attempts to leave the Underworld, viewing it as him avoiding his responsibilities and his family. Zagreus has the option to repair their relationship, and perhaps rekindle their romance, should he choose to.\nDuring quieter moments, Zagreus has the opportunity to deepen his bond with childhood friends Megaera and Thanatos. It's evident to all three that romantic feelings have blossomed between Zagreus and Megaera. She is very tender with him, channelling her frustration into their confrontations. These encounters occasionally take on an intense dynamic, with Zagreus seemingly relishing the charged atmosphere, akin to a dominatrix scenario.\nFurthermore, Meg finds Zagreus' rebellious and persistent nature, as well as the attention he attracts in the underworld, disturbing. Despite her reluctance to directly oppose him, her loyalty to her duties and to Hades compels her to confront Zagreus when necessary, despite her discomfort, putting her in a difficult position.\nMegaera may exhibit a competitive spirit towards him, keeping track of their encounters. While she may not graciously accept defeat, their conflicts foster a sense of camaraderie and rivalry. However, it's evident that with each loss, she becomes frustrated and dislikes being seen as if she had made things easy for him. \nIf certain conditions are met, their relationship may evolve into something more significant. During his travels, Zagreus also aids Megaera in rebuilding her bond with her sisters, demonstrating that her experiences weren't entirely fruitless.\nThanatos.\n&lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;: Megaera's colleague.&lt;br&gt;Megaera and Thanatos are co-workers who bonded over the incident of being deceived by Sisyphus in the past and, more recently, their frustration due to their reluctant affection for Zagreus.\nIf Zagreus decides to pursue a relationship with Thanatos, he will reveal that Megaera encouraged him to do so, and vice versa. Furthermore, if Zagreus also seeks a romantic relationship with Megaera, the three of them may eventually form a polyamorous relationship, and Megaera is perfectly fine with this arrangement.\nMeg and Thanatos have a private conversation and come to an agreement. To Zagreus's surprise, he finds both of them in his room one day, with Thanatos offering a casual greeting and Megaera chuckling. She playfully asks why he's so surprised, considering his room lacks doors. Initially intrigued, Zagreus quickly realizes that both of them are smiling at him and understands their intentions. Megaera encourages Zagreus to have more faith in both of them, mentioning that they were friends long before Zagreus was even born.\nHypnos.\n&lt;a href=\"Hypnos\"&gt;Hypnos&lt;/a&gt;: Megaera's colleague.&lt;br&gt;Initially, she paid little attention to Hypnos, viewing him as a clown whose childish antics did not justify his lack of work ethic. However, whenever Megaera emerged from the Styx after facing Zagreus, Hypnos had the habit of offering her the same useless yet captivating advice he used to give Zagreus.\nAs she spent more time conversing with him, Megaera began to appreciate his qualities, like Hypnos' optimistic and and fun-loving side, a rare trait in the underworld. Megaera started to view the information that Hypnos provided about Zagreus as quite useful for her next rematch too. Over time, Meg's constant presence started to spark a growing interest in Hypnos. To Hypnos, he was Megaera's \"dream man,\" making Meg have to clarify things for him all the time, but she believes he is more than capable of handling the eventual rejection.\nShe became the only person, apart from Zagreus, who willingly engaged in regular conversations with him. Even when he mentioned his \"break up with him\", Megaera takes Hypnos calmly. She even told Zagreus that Hypnos had given her \"wonderful advice.\" She even mentions to Zagreus that Hypnos here had given her \"wonderful advice,\" which makes Hypnos agitated.\nDusa.\n&lt;a href=\"Dusa\"&gt;Dusa&lt;/a&gt;: Megaera's colleague.&lt;br&gt;\nMegaera considers Dusa her most intimate friend, despite the differences in their positions. She holds Dusa in high regard, seeing her more like a sister than Alecto and Tisiphone. She is shown careful and concerned about the wellbeing of the gorgon maid. They are always seen together gossiping on days off, drinking and Megaera always staying updated on Dusa's latest gossip.\nAfter completing Dusa's favor, Megaera states to Zagreus that he and Dusa did a good job renovating the Lounge. When Dusa is briefly fired, Meg becomes visibly upset, blaming Zagreus for losing her bestie friend in the House. Megaera forcing Nyx's hand, goes to Zagreus, and even confronts him about it in the Underworld, insisting that he fix it. Upon Dusa's return, Meg is relieved but remains frustrated with Zagreus, feeling that it should never have come to that point in the first place.\nBefore accepting Zagreus' proposal, she first checks if Dusa will be okay with it, cancelling it if necessary. When Dusa expresses that this is great news, and she supports her and Zagreus, and that they should dive into it headfirst, Megaera says that Dusa is indeed a very kind friend, and if Dusa is fine with it, she's also fine with it.\nNyx.\n&lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;: Megaera's boss.&lt;br&gt;Megaera shows a great deal of reverence to the goddess of Night. She very rarely doubts her, and consistently listens to her advice. Megaera sees beyond a mentor and sees maternal figure. Unlike the other Furies, and as much as Megaera is largely closed off about her feelings, while Nyx brushes her hair, she will open up to her, crying in her lap and sharing her work frustrations, while Nyx comforts her.\nHades.\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;: Megaera's boss.&lt;br&gt;Megaera is one of the Fury sisters and acts as the enforcer of Hades' orders, punishing those who defy his dominion over the dead. The relationship between Megaera and Hades is professional and hierarchical. Hades relies on Megaera to carry out his orders to punish wrongdoers and maintain order in the underworld. She holds a significant position in the administration of the underworld and fulfils her role efficiently, despite internal conflicts with Hades' rules and desires.\nIn reality, she does not agree with following them lately due to her unresolved matters with Zagreus. Indeed, he is putting her in a position she detests, and he likely knows it. He primarily sends her after Zagreus to keep him at bay, but it is beyond her reach to question them.\nCerberus.\n&lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt;: Megaera's friend.&lt;br&gt;He used to take care of Megaera and Thanatos when they were very young. They still play with Zagreus from time to time.\nAchilles.\n&lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt;: Megaera's colleague.&lt;br&gt;He encourages Zagreus to pursue both Than and Meg. Almost everyone likes Achilles, including Megaera.\nCharon.\n&lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;: Megaera's colleague.&lt;br&gt;Although she doesn't even want to get close to him, Charon was seen taking Megaera, Thanatos, and Zagreus on a casual boat ride for fishing, which was very nice of him.\nPersephone.\n&lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt;: Megaera's queen.&lt;br&gt;Their relationship hasn't been explored in depth, but everyone in the underworld misses her. Megaera probably considered her a better queen in terms of treatment than the temperamental Hades.\nUnderworld Residents.\nSisyphus.\n&lt;a href=\"Sisyphus\"&gt;Sisyphus&lt;/a&gt;: Responsible for torturing him.&lt;br&gt;Megaera loathes the former king for his past crimes, and is often tasked in punishing him, alongside her sisters. She pays little mind to his apparent change of heart, even when Zagreus vouches for him. The Furies - and particularly Megaera - torment him as he tries to push the boulder, Bouldy, although with Zagreus's recent escape attempts, they seem to be neglecting this specific duty."}

Before the events precede up to Hades II, while Melino\u00eb's family lived a happy life in the underworld, the titan &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt; broke free from his prison deep in &lt;a href=\"Tartarus\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt; and took control of the Underworld. On her father's orders, &lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt; took Melino\u00eb and trained her to be a titan slayer. \nMelino\u00eb now must descend to the Underworld and defeat Chronos.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nThe Princess of the Underworld has been trained her entire life to kill &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt; but has not become bitter despite all that has been stolen from her. Melino\u00eb is resilient, hardworking, compassionate, and friendly to all, striving to get along with everyone beyond her reach. Despite being a dark goddess and her position, she races against time but will not fail to show kindness to others.\nMelino\u00eb, despite being a fierce fighter, has a soft heart and wants to reunite the separated, like the &lt;a href=\"children%20of%20Nyx\"&gt;children of Nyx&lt;/a&gt;. She is polite, diplomatic, and well-mannered, continuing to be unreasonably kind to everyone, sometimes even too much, which may make those unaccustomed to such praise find her \"strange.\" She also harbors divergent perspectives on the majority of characters: she adores the slumbering &lt;a href=\"Hypnos\"&gt;Hypnos&lt;/a&gt;, regards Commander &lt;a href=\"Schelemeus\"&gt;Schelemeus&lt;/a&gt; with seasoned respect, and maintains an idealized vision of her family to a degree. Upon encountering someone expressing disdain towards those she knows, Melino\u00eb becomes not only perplexed but also deeply intrigued wishing to learn more from them about her family and heritage.\nMelino\u00eb only wishes to fulfil her duty, to honor her mentor Hecate, and to reunite her family. She uses respectful honorifics when referring to everyone, whether they are lofty gods or minor ones, except for Chronos, for whom she has nothing but disdain. In spite of being understanding, she can loosen up and join in the fun by making sarcastic comments, much like &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;, and comically mocks &lt;a href=\"Scylla\"&gt;Scylla&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Scylla%20and%20the%20Sirens\"&gt;band&lt;/a&gt;, whose musical style is not to her taste and even compares Scylla to a mollusk. \nAn avid animal lover, she cannot help but pause in her mission just to pet them. She is also horrified to see &lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt; damaged and does her utmost to alleviate the beast's pain. Her magnetism with living creatures extends to the point where they happily and willingly align with her as her familiars. As expected of her bloodline, she has a connection to the inhabitants of the underworld, more pronounced than her brother's, as &lt;a href=\"Shade\"&gt;shades&lt;/a&gt; seem to follow her.\nMelino\u00eb is a dedicated student and dislikes disorder as she keeps her quarters tidy and is bothered by mess, scolding &lt;a href=\"Dora\"&gt;Dora&lt;/a&gt; for misplacing a single vial on her shelf and being annoyed by &lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt; littering in front of her. She can be extremely innocent, inviting &lt;a href=\"Odysseus\"&gt;Odysseus&lt;/a&gt; for a bath in the hot springs, unaware that she's embarrassing him a bit when she starts undressing in front of him.\nShe desires to assist all her friends but often ends up being reckless. This recklessness is the reason for her missing left arm, as she tried in the past to help her friend &lt;a href=\"Icarus\"&gt;Icarus&lt;/a&gt; despite not being fully versed at the time in witchcraft. Melino\u00eb, however, refuses to let Icarus blame himself for her condition, as it serves as a reminder of her own arrogance.\nAlthough kind-hearted, Melino\u00eb is vindictive against those that she considers enemies especially with Chronos and declares that she will not surrender until all the traitors of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt; are broken at her feet or until she takes back what Chronos took from her.\nShe also has a one-track mind, which while admirable in achieving her goals, presents some obvious drawbacks. Having been molded mentally and physically into the perfect God-Killer almost from the point of birth by &lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt;, Melino\u00eb does not care what happens to her so long as her goal of slaying Chronos is achieved demonstrating both a fearlessness and recklessness during her runs. This same one-track focus also means that she has not ever stopped to consider what she'll do next if or when she ever achieves it. Conversely whenever she fails in her task, she'll slip into periods of depression and stress feeling that she's not living up to the prophecy which she feels is her only purpose for existing. \nTraining Methods.\nMelino\u00eb, like her brother &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; before her, trains herself to get stronger through various methods on her quest to defeat &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;:\nOne crucial difference between &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt; and Melino\u00eb is the latter's use of &lt;a href=\"Magick\"&gt;Magick&lt;/a&gt;, i.e. Mana, to charge up much stronger attacks known as \u03a9 Moves. She is at her most powerful when she has a very strong Magick regeneration rate allowing her to fire these moves at a high frequency, so take note of the various ways that exist for increasing this.\nPaired with the above is the potential &lt;a href=\"Selene/Gifts%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Hex&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=\"Selene\"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt;. The successor to the powerful Calls available for &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;, Melino\u00eb can choose one of several possible effects for the Hex the first time she encounters &lt;a href=\"Selene\"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt;, and every subsequent encounter grants upgrade points to the ability in an upgrade tree. The Hex is fuelled explicitly by spent &lt;a href=\"Magick\"&gt;Magick&lt;/a&gt;; each available Hex ability can only be fired once Melino\u00eb has spent a certain amount of Magick in the current Encounter, and this always resets to 0 at the beginning of every Encounter. High &lt;a href=\"Magick\"&gt;Magick&lt;/a&gt; builds will also naturally be able to use Hexes frequently.\nPhysical description.\nGeneral.\nMuch like her older brother &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;, Melino\u00eb has heterochromia with one eye red like her &lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;father's&lt;/a&gt; and the other green like her &lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;mother's&lt;/a&gt;. However, the colors are inverted in relation to Zagreus. Her left arm appears spectral with a supernatural green glow, revealing her skeleton that can be seen within it. This arm was lost in a sorcery-related accident while trying to help her friend &lt;a href=\"Icarus\"&gt;Icarus&lt;/a&gt;. Her hair is wheat blonde like her mother's, the haircut is short and does not share the spiky characteristics of hers and Zagreus. In the hot spring, her hair gains more body and waves than when it is dry. Her skin is pale like her brother's, but she is slender and less muscular than him, and like her father and brother, her bare feet glow with warmth.\nClothing Description.\nMelino\u00eb adorns her head with a laurel wreath that glows like embers when on her head, similar to her brother's. Parting her bangs at the center is an upward-facing crescent moon on her forehead. She wears a short saffron-colored dress fastened up to the neck brace, with her limbs adorned with metal ornaments, including lunar shapes on her right leg. On her left leg, Melino\u00eb wears a braided cord in the colors of orange, green, blue, and black, matching that of the members of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Sisters\"&gt;Silver Sisters&lt;/a&gt; which Melino\u00eb is a part of.\nHades II.\nAfter the events in &lt;a href=\"Hades%20%28game%29\"&gt;\"Hades\"&lt;/a&gt;, Hades and Persephone welcomed Melino\u00eb, their second child. A painting was commissioned to mark the joyful occasion, with their new family member. However, it didn't last long, as the Titan of Time, &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;, escaped from Tartarus, imprisoning her family and the other members of the House of Hades deep within Tartarus. Under Hades' orders, &lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt; took Melino\u00eb, alongside the unfinished family painting and Hypnos, who was present at the time. Hecate fled with the child and hid her at &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;, a safe place, out of Chronos' reach.\nDuring this time, &lt;a href=\"The%20Fates\"&gt;The Fates&lt;/a&gt; predicted a prophecy that Hades' second child would overthrow the Titan. Because of this, Hecate chose not to contact Melino\u00eb's family on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Olympus\"&gt;Olympus&lt;/a&gt;. Based on this prophecy, Hecate decided to raise Melino\u00eb alone and train her under her supervision to one day defeat Chronos and fulfil the prophecy. Trained extensively to achieve mental and physical perfection, Melino\u00eb would grow up in The Crossroads, always feeling like something was missing and only having flashes of memories and confusing dreams about her family; she would end up knowing only two of her Olympian relatives: &lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point when she was much older, she lost her left arm after trying to help her friend Icarus using Hecate's cauldron.\nWhen Melino\u00eb's training finally ended, she set out on her journey to try to defeat Chronos. Artemis decides to inform &lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; about Melino\u00eb and her attempt to defeat Chronos, with Apollo spreading the news to all the other &lt;a href=\"Olympian\"&gt;Olympian&lt;/a&gt; gods. Melino\u00eb ends up meeting her family from Olympus, and they give her their boons, helping her on her journey.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\nMerchandise=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

In the present day, she understands who they are and what was taken from her, but is unable to feel any grief over people she never knew.\nHades.\n&lt;a href=\"Hades\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;: Melino\u00eb's father.&lt;br&gt;Melino\u00eb was unable to form any meaningful relationship with her father in her youth as the Titan Chronos conquered the Underworld shortly after she was born. The two encounter each other years later when she begins her task and manages to reach the depths of Tartarus. At first Melino\u00eb does not recognize the imprisoned Hades as her father but quickly assures him she will defeat Chronos and reunite the family. Since then, they interact whenever Melino\u00eb descends into Tartarus, with Melino\u00eb keeping her father informed of what is happening within the Underworld and on Olympus.\nPersephone.\n&lt;a href=\"Persephone\"&gt;Persephone&lt;/a&gt;: Melino\u00eb's mother.&lt;br&gt;Melino\u00eb was unable to form any meaningful relationship with her mother in her youth as the Titan Chronos conquered the Underworld shortly after she was born. Melino\u00eb does mention she knows her mother has a beautiful smile from the unfinished painting she has.\nZagreus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;: Melino\u00eb's older brother.&lt;br&gt;Melino\u00eb was unable to form any meaningful relationship with her brother in her youth as the Titan Chronos conquered the Underworld shortly after she was born. Melino\u00eb is however curious to learn more about her brother from people who knew him.\nCerberus.\n&lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt;: The royal family's dog.&lt;br&gt;Melino\u00eb currently doesn't have a bond with Cerberus like the rest of her family. Despite this, Melino\u00eb still cares deeply for him, as seen when she first has to fight him, immediately recognizing him in his infernal state and feeling bad for having to fight him.\nChthonic Gods.\nThe Gods of the Underworld.\nHecate.\n&lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt;: Melino\u00eb's mentor and mother figure.&lt;br&gt;Hecate has trained Melino\u00eb to kill Chronos and became a parental substitute to Melino\u00eb. She raised Melino\u00eb after she was ordered by Hades to take her away when Chronos attacked the Underworld.\nHecate is a very nurturing mentor to the princess, who in turn treats her with great respect and mutual love. Despite filling her with daily rigorous training since a young age, Melino\u00eb visibly seeks to surpass herself for Hecate to take pride in her and becomes frustrated when she fails to meet the expectations she set for herself.\nFlashbacks of Melino\u00eb's childhood memories show Hecate playing hide-and-seek with her, allowing Melino\u00eb to find her. Though many of these games involved Melino\u00eb playing the role of a titan slayer in their play, it demonstrates that Hecate has always subtly manipulated and influenced Melino\u00eb, perhaps reinforcing her own desire for Melino\u00eb to unconsciously, become a titan slayer.\nWhile Melino\u00eb views Hecate as a parental substitute the same cannot be said of Hecate, who does not hold the same views as her and greatly dislikes whenever Melino\u00eb implies that she views her as such.\nNemesis.\n&lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;: Retribution Incarnate and fellow student of Hecate.&lt;br&gt;Nemesis aids Melino\u00eb in her quest for vengeance against Chronos. It appears that she and Melino\u00eb have a strained relationship, as they frequently engage in arguments and exchange sarcastic remarks. Nemesis openly displays her dissatisfaction with Hecate by choosing Melino\u00eb over her, effectively positioning Melino\u00eb as a titan slayer. From the beginning, she displays skepticism towards Melino\u00eb's efforts and doesn't believe that this work is up to par.\nMoros.\n&lt;a href=\"Moros\"&gt;Moros&lt;/a&gt;: Doom Incarnate.&lt;br&gt;Moros aids Melino\u00eb in her quest against Chronos. They often discuss matters of the Fates and their lack of oversight now that they have been captured. They seem to be kindred spirits and confide in each other when the other feels insecure. When Moros shows interest in learning magic, Melino\u00eb is supportive.\nEris.\n&lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt;: Strife Incarnate.&lt;br&gt;Melino\u00eb is \"drawn to her like a moth to a flame.\" They have a complex and contentious relationship. Melino\u00eb is among the few gods to show courtesy towards Eris, despite Eris's repeated efforts to thwart her goals by either administering a \"blessing\" of strife, or outright fighting her at the bank of the Rift of Thessaly. Despite Eris's rivalry and forcing Melino\u00eb to pick up her litter, Melino\u00eb admits she cannot make herself hate Eris.\nMelino\u00eb mentioned to Eris that the concept of \"Strife\" is Eris's to define, and that she doesn't have to live in constant animosity with everyone else. Eris considers this, and the possibility of change, but not too much. Eris, similarly, seeks to influence Melino\u00eb, having her \"loosen up\" from her responsibilities, and points out that Melino\u00eb doesn't \"have a life\" outside of her mission. She asserts that Melino\u00eb derives thrills from their fights, something that Melino\u00eb neither affirms nor denies. Eris often sends mixed messages towards Melino\u00eb or otherwise \"mak[es] [things] weird\" between the two of them. She refers to her as \"Babe\" yet at one occasion calls her boring and that she doesn't like her. Yet, Eris regularly follows Melino\u00eb around, to the extent that Icarus points out that Eris following Melino\u00eb to the Rift of Thessaly was a continuation of a similar trend as always. Eris on other occasions has mentioned enjoying Melino\u00eb's face, and gifts her a nectar in return for Melino\u00eb gifting her some in the past. She enjoys the fights she has with Melino\u00eb.\nHypnos.\n&lt;a href=\"Hypnos\"&gt;Hypnos&lt;/a&gt;: Sleep Incarnate.&lt;br&gt;Since childhood, she has held reverence for the slumbering Hypnos, carrying one of his poppies on her belt as a testament to her memories. Where Hypnos resides, there lies a garden of poppies, his favorites, a place that ensures his comfort and provides cool shade to shield him from the sunlight. This, orchestrated perhaps by Melino\u00eb, demonstrates her attentive care and special affection for him, until the day he awakens.\nDuring a conversation with Nemesis about Hypnos, it becomes evident that over the years, Melino\u00eb has greatly idealized him, perceiving him in his slumbering countenance as wise and mysterious, appropriate for a child of Nyx. Nemesis eagerly anticipates witnessing the dormant \"dream man\" awakening in Melino\u00eb's presence, so she can finally meet her muse.\nCharon.\n&lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;: Stygian Boatman.&lt;br&gt;\nThe Crossroads Residents.\nDora.\n&lt;a href=\"Dora\"&gt;Dora&lt;/a&gt;: Listless Shade and Melino\u00eb's friend.&lt;br&gt;Dora is a shadow, seemingly a friend of Melino\u00eb. She attempts to be menacing when speaking with her, but upon closer acquaintance, it becomes evident that things are not quite as they seem, constantly oscillating between being friendly and threatening. Melino\u00eb already appears accustomed to this unsettling routine and aspect of Dora.\nOther characters with Hecate mention that she could be relentless and dangerous, and advise Melino\u00eb to stay away from her, but Melino\u00eb only harbors sympathy for her, apparently dismissing it all as mere gossip.\nOdysseus.\n&lt;a href=\"Odysseus\"&gt;Odysseus&lt;/a&gt;: Veteran Tactician.&lt;br&gt;Melino\u00eb regards Odysseus as something of a brother or an uncle.\nSchelemeus.\n&lt;a href=\"Skelly\"&gt;Schelemeus&lt;/a&gt;: Melino\u00eb's Training Master.&lt;br&gt;Melino\u00eb regards Schelemeus with reverence as a seasoned veteran.\nArachne.\n&lt;a href=\"Arachne\"&gt;Arachne&lt;/a&gt;: Silk Weaver.&lt;br&gt;Melino\u00eb may randomly cross paths with her in &lt;a href=\"Erebus\"&gt;Erebus&lt;/a&gt; and outfit her with special clothing featuring passive enhancements. Their interactions suggest they've met before and get along well. She is exceptionally kind when the princess speaks to her, offering her services as a weaver.\nOlympian Gods.\nThe Olympians, most of whom are aunts, uncles, and cousins to Melino\u00eb, aid her in her quest to defeat Chronos. \nArtemis.\n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;: Melino\u00eb's cousin.&lt;br&gt;Melino\u00eb is close to Artemis, as she and Hermes were the only Olympians who knew of her existence. Unlike the other Olympian gods, Artemis personally appears to Melino\u00eb when offering her boons.\nApollo.\n&lt;a href=\"Apollo\"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt;: Melino\u00eb's cousin.&lt;br&gt;Apollo aids Melino\u00eb in her battle against Cronos, granting her his blessings. When Artemis tells him about Melino\u00eb, he quickly spreads the word throughout Olympus about her existence to ensure she receives the utmost assistance possible. He acts with friendliness and great chivalry. Apollo knows his boundaries and where he cannot to surpass, but he remains vigilant, always ready to help his cousin so she doesn't lose her path in the way.\nDemeter.\n&lt;a href=\"Demeter\"&gt;Demeter&lt;/a&gt;: Melino\u00eb's maternal grandmother.&lt;br&gt;Melino\u00eb never directly met her maternal grandmother Demeter, as she remained hidden. Hecate always told her stories about her grandmother, and Melino\u00eb is anxious to meet her.\nHermes.\n&lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;: Melino\u00eb's cousin.&lt;br&gt;Melino\u00eb is close to Hermes as he and Artemis were the only Olympians to know of her existence. During the events of Hades II, Hermes has gone undercover to infiltrate the forces of Chronos, this has worried Melino\u00eb as she asks Charon of Hermes' whereabouts in one of her conversations with him.\nZeus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;: Melino\u00eb's uncle.&lt;br&gt;Zeus aids Melino\u00eb in her battle against Chronos by providing his boons to her.\nPoseidon.\n&lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;: Melino\u00eb's uncle.&lt;br&gt;\nHestia.\n&lt;a href=\"Hestia\"&gt;Hestia&lt;/a&gt;: Melino\u00eb's grandaunt.&lt;br&gt;\nHera.\n&lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt;: Melino\u00eb's grandaunt.\nAphrodite.\n&lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt;: The Goddess of Love and Beauty.&lt;br&gt;When Melino\u00eb summons her, she undoubtedly mentions that Aphrodite must know both hate and love. Upon learning that the missing princess was no longer missing, Aphrodite found it quite scandalous; it became the talk of the moment on Mount Olympus. She remarked that Melino\u00eb's brother must be immensely proud of her for fighting for her relatives.\nAphrodite also observed Moros's handsome and Melino\u00eb's interactions with him. From the outset, she noticed Melino\u00eb's beauty and complimented her, predicting that she would shatter many hearts. This led Melino\u00eb to ponder Aphrodite's advice, perhaps considering dressing up more.\nAphrodite kindly reassured Melino\u00eb not to fret about her brother Zagreus and his family, assuring her that they were gods and that everything would be fine.&lt;br&gt;\nHephaestus.\n&lt;a href=\"Hephaestus\"&gt;Hephaestus&lt;/a&gt;: Melino\u00eb's cousin.&lt;br&gt;\nThe Titans.\nThe previous rulers of the world, defeated in the Titan War and imprisoned in the pits of &lt;a href=\"Tartarus\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;: Melino\u00eb's paternal grandfather&lt;br&gt;Melino\u00eb greatly hates Chronos as the Titan took over her home and destroyed her family. She has made it her life mission to slay the Titan and free the Underworld from his grasp.\n&lt;a href=\"Selene\"&gt;Selene&lt;/a&gt;: Melino\u00eb's grandaunt."}

It is one of the main meta progression systems in \"&lt;a href=\"Hades%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hades&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nReflecting at the Mirror gives Zagreus the ability to spend &lt;a href=\"Darkness\"&gt;Darkness&lt;/a&gt; gathered from the Underworld to improve his own abilities. However, many of the abilities are locked at first, each requiring a varying number of &lt;a href=\"Chthonic%20Key\"&gt;Chthonic Keys&lt;/a&gt; to unlock. After several escape attempts, the ability to refund spent Darkness for use on other abilities is unlocked. Refunding Darkness costs one &lt;a href=\"Chthonic%20Key\"&gt;Chthonic Key&lt;/a&gt; and refunds all Darkness spent in the Mirror of Night.\nEach ability from the Mirror has two versions, one colored red and one colored green (the green talents are not available from the start \u2014 they will be unlocked following a conversation with Nyx after collecting a minimum of 300 ). Each version needs to be invested in separately. For example, spending Darkness on Shadow Presence does not upgrade Fiery Presence. Only one version of each ability can be active at a time, and they can be switched between freely while reflecting at the Mirror.\nTotals.\nIt takes a total of 65 to unlock all upgrades on the Mirror.\nTo unlock all non-Boon, non-Fated Authority upgrades requires 6,165 ; including the Boon upgrades takes this total to 14,365 . Including Fated Authority and Fated Persuasion, the total required to max out the Mirror is 35,365 .\nFated Authority.\nOne point of Fated Authority can be used to change a room's reward into any other item from its pool. Room rewards belong in two distinct item pools. \nOne pool consists of permanent resources, indicated by a blue laurel wreath on the door:\nThe other consists of temporary (run-specific) resources, indicated by a golden laurel wreath around the door:\nSome rooms cannot be altered, nor can they be acquired through Fated Authority: Charon's shops, friendly NPC encounters with Sisyphus, Eurydice, and Patroclus, passageways through Underworld areas, and boss rooms.\nMini-boss encounters can have the reward altered, but the encounter itself is unaffected; all standard encounters can be altered by Fated Authority however, including skull symbol rooms turning into regular rooms (and vice versa)"}

The \u03a9 Special fires a trio of wide circular blasts in a forward line pattern that do VERY good damage, especially if you position yourself so an enemy gets hit by more than one of the blasts. The \u03a9 Attack, which can be fired after only a partial charge, has you spin around in a cyclone doing multiple strikes to nearby enemies with the amount of charge beforehand determining how many spins you do.

{"id": "2294", "revid": "33600", "url": "https://hades.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2294", "title": "Moros", "text": "Moros is the personification of doom, bad luck, and inevitability. A grim and rustic incarnation, he is the son of &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt; and is seemingly the only one out of his kin to maintain some connection or priviness to the designs of his older sisters, &lt;a href=\"The%20Fates\"&gt;The Fates&lt;/a&gt;, due to his use of a large needle-like sword as his signature weapon. \nHe appears in &lt;a href=\"Hades%20II\"&gt;Hades II&lt;/a&gt;, providing the &lt;a href=\"Fated%20List%20of%20Minor%20Prophecies/Hades%20II\"&gt;Fated List&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; in her fight against Chronos and becoming a permanent resident of &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nMoros embodies misfortune, foreseeing the inevitable fate; even his name seems rarely invoked. However, his behavior contradicts this, as he personally exalts politeness, compassion, solemnity, and moderation. Despite his pessimistic role, Moros personally believes that &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; can herald a better future for all.\nBeing solitary, Moros is unaccustomed to others besides his &lt;a href=\"The%20Fates\"&gt;sisters&lt;/a&gt; visiting him; he is socially awkward, treating everyone with formality and great cordiality, addressing Melino\u00eb by the royal title of \"princess\". As his presence is undesirable, he even becomes surprised and timid in Melinoe's presence when she offers him her first Nectar, commenting that no one has ever paid him homage before.\nMoros is a great fan of &lt;a href=\"Odysseus\"&gt;Odysseus&lt;/a&gt;, impressed with his ability to deceive fate; he was so skilled at it that Moros couldn't help but admire him. Though inwardly graceful, Moros is pleased when some defy fate, signifying more work for him when he needs to appear to deliver the new misfortune they suffer. Despite his admiration for Odysseus, he harbors no grudge. Moros remains analytical and calm, even when reminded of what happened to the Fates, maintaining composure by acknowledging the futility of holding resentment for the immutable.\nDespite appearing responsible in his duties, Moros actually dislikes fulfilling them. As his sister &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt; observes, Moros's appearance is never a good sign, a sentiment with which Moros unfortunately agrees. Nonetheless, he strives to be a friendly face, dignifying the lives of mortals in their last and often terrible moments. He notes that this gesture rarely occurs, but he perceives it nonetheless.\nDespite his reliability, Moros's words betray a sense of inferiority, placing his sisters, the Fates, on a pedestal and considering their functions more important than his own. He feels impotent and resentful for not having been able to save them from &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;'s clutches, imposing on himself the role of protecting them without trusting himself to do so. Moros's desire to be useful to Melinoe stems from his wish not to be a burden, but to assist in the fight against Chronos.\nPhysical description.\nMoros strongly resembles his &lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;younger brother&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; in many ways; he has purple irises, grey skin, and prominent cheekbones. His long, white hair spills elegantly over an obsidian circlet, which is adorned with gnarled horns. He is bare-chested, and wears a black, patterned shendyt adorned with a gold cloth belt that terminates in multicolored tassels. There are numerous references to the &lt;a href=\"Fates\"&gt;Moirai&lt;/a&gt; in his design, most notably the giant needle he wields and the tiny pictures of thread-spinning tools on his belt. His gold armor is adorned with skulls, indicating his connection with death. Much like Thanatos, he wears a gorget around his neck and armor on his forearms. Both his portrait and his overworld model depict him as having very rigid posture, with his feet together and his arms folded behind his back.\nHistory.\nBefore Hades II.\nMoros, born of Night, is among her somber progeny. &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;, with numerous offspring to tend, entrusted him to the guardianship of his elder sisters, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Fates\"&gt;Moirai&lt;/a&gt;, who fashioned him into the herald of destinies.\nHades II.\nMoros only engages with others when they are \"condemned\". He appears to &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; when she fails a race for the first time, and this is how she must seek him out and be able to invite him to &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nMoros doesn't initially appear at the beginning of Hades II, due to being busy with his work. He will first appear after performing the Fated Intervention &lt;a href=\"Incantation\"&gt;Incantation&lt;/a&gt; and only if &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; dies during a run but he will leave after giving Melino\u00eb the &lt;a href=\"Fated%20List%20of%20Minor%20Prophecies\"&gt;Fated List of Minor Prophecies&lt;/a&gt;. \nTo summon him again, the prophecy Doom Harbinger from the Fated List of Minor Prophecies must be selected. This will cause the cauldron to have a new incantation: Doomed Beckoning (which costs 3 &lt;a href=\"Fate%20Fabric\"&gt;Fate Fabric&lt;/a&gt; and 1 &lt;a href=\"Nightshade\"&gt;Nightshade&lt;/a&gt;). When the incantation is performed Melino\u00eb must die again during a run and Moros will appear. Melino\u00eb invites Moros to &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; which he accepts. Moros will now be permanently at the Crossroads next to the Fated List. Much like &lt;a href=\"Dora\"&gt;Dora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Odysseus\"&gt;Odysseus&lt;/a&gt;, he can be gifted Nectar and Bath Salts. He offers the &lt;a href=\"Engraved%20Pin\"&gt;Engraved Pin&lt;/a&gt; after receiving Nectar for the first time.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\nIllustration=\nMerchandise=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Almost like a \"Doom Repellant\"... except, it works in the opposite way. Such technicalities aside, I trust it shall be of some benefit.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'm certain it shall. Sometimes all I need is a few moments more. So if I use your Pin, you get to accompany me on my evenings out?\"\n Moros : \n\"Only in the final moments of your evenings, I'm afraid. Of course, we also have the evenings here...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Then I'll be seeing you around.\"\nKeepsake in Encounter.\n Moros : \n\"Ten.\nNine.\nEight.\nSeven.\nSix.\nFive.\nFour.\nThree.\nTwo.\nOne.\nZero.\"\nReactions.\n&lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; Inspecting Moros.\n Storyteller : \n\"\"The widely-hated, feared embodiment of Doom goes wherever the ever-weaving Fates decide, and none but they can anticipate his arrival.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"He sure knows how to make an entrance...\"\n Moros : \n\"Princess?\"\nAbouth the Scenery.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Hail, Lord Moros. How have you been acclimating so far? Is there something we can do to make your stay more comfortable?\"\n Moros : \n\"No, Princess, I'm well, and acclimating, as you say. I've never been to such a place as this! And making every effort not to be a nuisance here.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You're welcome here and safe.\"\nMiscellaneous Conversations.\nAbout &lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt; Penalty Cure.\nDialogue 01.\n Moros : \n\"...You traveled to the surface. Knowing full well the Fates decided long ago that those of your line could not survive there, and would always be forced back to the Underworld.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Their curse was... palpable. I never intended to stay for long. Just long enough to lend my relatives support. But it seems your sisters insist that I do no such thing.\"\n Moros : \n\"Well... I don't see them around right now, do you? Incidentally, there once was an incantation that I happened upon, which was not intended for my eyes. But I now choose to think that it was intended for yours.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"Unraveling a Fateful Bond...\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Thank you for visiting me last night, Lord Moros. So, hypothetically, if I were to complete a certain incantation that somehow loosened the grip the Three Fates have on my birthright... how angry would they be?\"\n Moros : \n\"Please understand, Princess, that I am not at liberty to give advice on matters such as that, not even hypothetically. I trust I've been sufficiently direct in putting it this way?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"In other words, we shouldn't be talking about this at all, and I assume all risk for my actions related to any potentially forbidden incantations that I've learned.\"\n Moros : \n\"Yes, that covers it.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Moros : \n\"Princess, officially I cannot condone your actions. Your visits to the surface violate the terms the Fates set for your father's lineage, and you invite whichever consequences they see fit.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Yes, but \"un\"officially, Lord Moros? If you'll permit yourself to speak of it this once. Or are we limited to candid conversations only when I'm on the verge of death?\"\n Moros : \n\"Our conversations are most definitely more secure that way, but \"un\"officially... I am amazed by your accomplishment. Perhaps living so close to the surface predisposed you, but still... I was uncertain it was possible.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"May the Fates forgive my transgressions.\"\n Moros : \n\"Likewise...\"\nAbout Returning.\n Moros : \n\"Are you all right, Princess? I'm realizing that whenever you return, it's likely due to some unfortunate result. One I might have easily anticipated in the past, but not anymore...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'm fine, Lord Moros, thank you for asking. I'm fairly accustomed to such outcomes at this point. It's interesting to know the Fates are not forcing it along... that it's all in my control. And all my fault.\"\n Moros : \n\"Well... now that you mention it, I can't entirely be sure the Fates have no more influence at all. How frustrating, not knowing whether our actions have been preordained or not...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I try not to think on it too much.\"\nAbout Search.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You must know what I'm about to ask, Lord Moros... especially since I promised many questions. You mentioned you were on a fruitless search. What was it that you sought?\"\n Moros : \n\"Oh! Well, the Fates do like to send me off to fetch them this or that, now and again. My search in some respects was similar. Though, I'm beginning to think they tricked me...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"They sent you to find something that couldn't be found. And, you can't just tell me what it is, can you?\"\n Moros : \n\"I think they simply wanted me out of the way. Although, I shouldn't speculate, or further speak of this at all... apologies.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I understand...\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"When you and I first met, you were searching for the Fates. But you discovered \"me \"among the shadows. I can navigate back to the Crossroads that way... but you can go farther?\"\n Moros : \n\"I can, yes. I'm from the deepest reaches of the Underworld, where there exists no light at all. The chasm from which all creation sprang a while back.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I suppose even if one knew the Fates resided in such a place, they might still prove difficult to find...\"\n Moros : \n\"Difficult, though not impossible, as we now know...\"\nAbout Mission.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I have to ask you something, Lord Moros, though I think I may already have the answer. Has the war with Chronos and Olympus taken some new turn?\"\n Moros : \n\"I'm sorry I can't answer you, Princess. I'm bound never to speak of matters in connection to the weavings of the Fates. If you knew more right now, it could unduly influence your path.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"And...? Knowledge is preparation. It seems strictly to our benefit for me to know as much as possible about what I'm getting myself into.\"\n Moros : \n\"Perhaps. Nevertheless, I cannot break my oath. I trust, though, that you'll learn the truth of it when the time is right.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'll be waiting.\"\nAbout The &lt;a href=\"Fated%20List%20of%20Minor%20Prophecies\"&gt;Fated List of Minor Prophecies&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Moros : \n\"If I may, Princess? The Fated List of Minor Prophecies... have you been able to make use of it?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I have. Thank you for bringing it to me. So then, the Fates already know what's going to happen in all this? Everything I'm going to do?\"\n Moros : \n\"Well, yes and no. The Fated List says as little of your future as necessary. I briefly was its host, myself, and saw there but a single prophecy... that I would pass it on to you.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Then that's a prophecy fulfilled.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Moros : \n\"The Fated List continues to unfold, so thank you. While the Fates often let events unfold naturally, at times they value an additional degree of certainty. And are willing to make it worthwhile.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I've seen a number of the listed prophecies already come to pass. Still others are foretold in their place. The magick in that scroll, it's beyond anything I've learned...\"\n Moros : \n\"You must have your doubts; the Fates are rather famous for their sense of irony. But, no matter the outcome, I'm grateful for your willingness to discover their design. Our families are at stake.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Our families, and more...\"\nDialogue 03.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I confess I feel a bit self-conscious that the Fated List is there for you and all to see. Some of the matters it describes are rather personal.\"\n Moros : \n\"If it's any comfort, the prophecies appear only to you. We see there only what's meant for us. Although, when you fulfill a prophecy... I can usually tell. It's like a sudden realization.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"We know our paths are intertwined to an extent. Well, may your sudden realizations connected to my actions not be \"too \"embarrassing.\"\n Moros : \n\"I'm certain that they won't.\"\nDialogue 04.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You know, some of these Fated prophecies are rather substantial. I shudder to think what might be on a list of \"major \"prophecies...\"\n Moros : \n\"I trust this doesn't make you feel as though your service hasn't been of value, because certainly it has. However, the prophecies listed there are indeed minor, in the grand scheme of things.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"The grand scheme of things... as in all existence, the unfathomable past, unknowable future... that sort of grandeur, you mean?\"\n Moros : \n\"Yes. The Fates preside over the smallest minutiae and the greatest of patterns. So don't take the idea of minor prophecies the wrong way. A small ripple can become a great wave.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Now you sound like Poseidon.\"\nDialogue 05.\n Moros : \n\"Your father once was bearer of the Fated List, you know. A \"House-warming \"gift, my sisters said. But Hades put it away... until your brother unearthed it from the archives, and started using it himself.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I know Zagreus sought our mother... perhaps the Fated List helped him succeed. Come to think, I wouldn't have even been born if he hadn't. Wait... how did you end up with the List after that?\"\n Moros : \n\"It wasn't until rather recently. The Fates sent me to retrieve the List from your father's House. Chronos would be absent, they said. And they were right; for when I returned, they were gone.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"That's when he got them...\"\n Moros : \n\"Yes.\"\nAbout The &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Trials\"&gt;Chaos Trials&lt;/a&gt;.\n Moros : \n\"A Pitch-Black Stone has been here this entire time, and I failed to detect it. I fear I'm beginning to slip up more often than acceptable.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It was inert just recently, Lord Moros. Until your grandparent gave me an idea for how to see the possibilities within. Though, perhaps I ought have checked with you first. You're troubled...\"\n Moros : \n\"Well, it's just... Chaos and my sisters didn't always get along. Chaos wanted everything to be possible... while the Fates, their desire is for things a certain way. But, they would all agree that you should use the Stone as you see fit.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Nothing like a Pitch-Black Stone to bring the family together, right?\"\n Moros : \n\"Right.\"\nAbout The &lt;a href=\"Oath%20of%20the%20Unseen\"&gt;Oath of the Unseen&lt;/a&gt;.\n Moros : \n\"The Oath of the Unseen is somewhere here, isn't that so, Princess...? The aura that it emanates... I haven't felt it since before all this. I thought the Oath was lost with Mother Nyx, but it was in the care of Lady Hecate.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It's in my own care now. The will of Night shall be done, no matter what, isn't that so? You're here among the Unseen; you know our charge.\"\n Moros : \n\"The Oath is clearly in good hands.\"\nAbout Self.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"What did you use to do, Lord Moros? I mean before all this. I have only the vaguest sense of it.\"\n Moros : \n\"I served my sisters the Three Fates, both as their advocate, and as their guardian. The Fates determine when mortal lives draw to a close, and also sometimes \"how. \"I would bear witness to these more-specific weavings...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"The mortals must have appreciated your diligence. Has somebody else since taken over your responsibilities?\"\n Moros : \n\"\"Heh! \"You could say that, I suppose.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"The Shades around here... I know they've been avoiding you, Lord Moros. Some are filled with fear. Others with contempt. You ended their lives?\"\n Moros : \n\"It never was for me to decide why a mortal's life should suddenly be cut short. But, I did get to choose the \"how \"of it. Knowing the future could be monotonous work, so my sisters and I tried to keep things... interesting.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You brought misery to mortals because you were bored?\"\n Moros : \n\"I'm not proud of it. Especially not when you put it that way. And I regret I've caused dissension in your ranks.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'll handle it.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Moros : \n\"You said something before to me, Princess. Concerning mortalkind. That surely they \"appreciate my diligence\", because I'm with them in the final moments of their lives. The truth of it, however, is they hate me; most of them. In life, as well as death.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I appreciate your candor. What you say aligns with some of the rumblings I've heard from Shades loyal to us. Though, it's strange, Lord Moros. Your reputation is one thing; but \"you\", it seems, are entirely another.\"\n Moros : \n\"\"Heh! \"From you, Princess, I'll take that as a compliment.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It \"was \"a compliment.\"\nAbout Foresight.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You used to know everything that was going to occur, didn't you, Lord Moros? Up until recently, from what I gathered. I can't imagine...\"\n Moros : \n\"Well, imagine it being rather dull, always knowing what's to come. But now I'm no different than you. How do you... get by like this? Many surprises are unwelcome, yet there also can be pleasant ones, true?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'm sure it helps that I don't know it any other way. This must be very difficult for you.\"\n Moros : \n\"\"Hah! \"Yes.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Something the matter, Lord Moros? You seem more ill-at-ease than usual. If there's additional bad news you're at liberty to share, I'm listening.\"\n Moros : \n\"Oh, \"haha! \"It's nothing of the sort, at least for now, Princess. It's just... this sensation of uncertainty. Not just in the grander scheme, but even from one evening to the next... I'm still unused to it.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"There can be pleasure in the unexpected. But even those of us who never had the gift of foresight struggle in the way that you describe. For me, it helps to focus on a present state of mind. In being here right now.\"\n Moros : \n\"The now... thank you, Princess...\"\nDialogue 03.\n Moros : \n\"I've been attempting what you said before, to focus on a present state of mind. It's proving difficult, because... my mind invariably drifts to many possibilities of negative outcomes.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'm familiar with that feeling. We have to consider favorable outcomes side-by-side, and plan for them. Then, at a certain point, all we can do is hope...\"\n Moros : \n\"Hope... I much prefer a sense of certainty. It's odd to think that my sisters the Fates, to others, represent sheer chance. Matters beyond one's control. Yet to me, they made everything so clear. I'd rather trust than hope.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You can do both.\"\nAbout Witchcraft.\n Moros : \n\"There's so much here for me to learn! Lady Hecate has been generous enough to teach me something of the herbal ways, and of your craft. An everlasting pursuit! I'm getting a late start.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You wish to become a witch, Lord Moros? Maybe I can give you some pointers sometime.\"\n Moros : \n\"Oh I would welcome that.\"\nAbout Death.\n Moros : \n\"If you don't mind me asking, Princess: Have you ever died before? Not in the mortal sense, it's just... you seem to have exceptional tenacity in moments most gods couldn't endure.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I cannot afford to lose my grip on consciousness out there. Headmistress taught me always to return to shadows with my final bit of strength. I learned the hard way, but I learned.\"\n Moros : \n\"It shows. Remarkable, to have met someone equally as comfortable with death as well as life. I practically see it in your eyes.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It's not a big concern.\"\nAbout Weapons.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Lord Moros, you must know something of the Nocturnal Arms. So, your mother and sisters collaborated on these weapons to be used only in dire need? And entrusted them to Headmistress?\"\n Moros : \n\"Mother Nyx knew the fickle nature of the Olympians and the Fate-forged weapons that they used to seal away the Titans. She desired a set of counterparts that would awaken only if the realm itself was in upheaval.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I suppose there ought to be another set of weapons forged to keep these in check, and another for those, and so on.\"\n Moros : \n\"Now you are being humorous, Princess.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I wasn't.\"\nDialogue 02 (Aspect of Moros).\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I figured that you knew something of the Nocturnal Arms, Lord Moros. But your connection to Ygnium, I'd not have guessed. You once wielded the Umbral Flames yourself! I revealed an Aspect of them that could only be your own.\"\n Moros : \n\"Princess, I take it you're not saying this to humor me, so please believe in turn that I have never used the Flames before; I know them only by their reputation. Can you be certain that this Aspect is my own? I've many relatives...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I... yes, I think it is. The Nocturnal Arms bond with their bearers in such a way that their connections to other bearers become almost like shared memories. Although...\"\n Moros : \n\"...Although, these glimpses can be both of bearers past, and still to come, true? So it may be that I shall bear those Flames in some other age in which the realm's in need. I... trust the Fates must have wanted me to know in advance.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Well, \"erm... \"surprise...!\"\nAbout Relationship.\nDialogue 01.\n Moros : \n\"I've been thinking more about what you said at the taverna, Princess. About finding one's source of motivation, whether through encouraging results or through adversity. Or more Nectar.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Oh I wasn't being serious about the Nectar part. It's just, I find it remarkable sometimes that adversity and negativity spurs me more fiercely than an expression of faith and support...\"\n Moros : \n\"\"Hah! \"As a force of adversity and negativity myself, I appreciate your open-mindedness. But I wanted to say that Nectar's quite a motivator, too. I trust we can share one again sometime.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"For certain.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Moros : \n\"I have a bit of an awkward question, Princess. What is the custom here for making declarations of affection? I did try asking Dora first, but she didn't give me practical advice.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"Erm... \"declarations of affection. I'm afraid I have bad news in that there is no custom for that here. You just choose the moment to express yourself, and hope your feelings are reciprocated.\"\n Moros : \n\"I see. Well then, I'll have to choose a moment very carefully. I appreciate the information and your patience.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Oh. Anytime!\"\nAbout Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;.\n Moros : \n\"How far were you able to go last night, Princess? You were gone for some time. I sensed the growing fear and excitement in the air, even heard some of the rumblings.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"If the rumblings were that I reached the depths of Tartarus, broke into my father's stolen House, confronted Chronos there, and outfought him, then you heard correctly. Hardly a final victory, but still.\"\n Moros : \n\"I would object to anyone but you diminishing such a victory. Is this not a vitally important component of the task you've been entrusted to complete?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Well, yes it is, but...\"\n Moros : \n\"Then congratulations, and may the Fates avail your next move.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Fates\"&gt;The Fates&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Lord Moros... I understand you can't reveal the weavings of the Fates. But, could you just tell me what the three of them are like?\"\n Moros : \n\"My sisters. They... well, each is her own goddess, I suppose. Clotho the spinstress is the talkative one, the decisive one. Lachesis is a little more agreeable; she apportions the thread. And Atropos, she sticks to the cutting.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It must be a little imposing, knowing your sisters determine the course of every life. Even your own?\"\n Moros : \n\"Even my own.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"...My task began immediately following reports that Chronos found a way to gain the upper hand against Olympus. We just didn't know which sort of way. But, now I think I do: your sisters the Three Fates... he got them, didn't he? Is that why you're here?\"\n Moros : \n\"...You ask while making clear to me that you already know. I ought to have been there when it happened. Perhaps the Fates knew I lacked the strength to protect them; so they protected me.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"How did he find them? What does he want from them?\"\n Moros : \n\"I don't know how he found them. Few beings with knowledge of their whereabouts exist. As to what he wants from them... and this is a conjecture of my own... surely he'll try to influence their weavings from here on.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Oh...\"\nDialogue 03.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Lord Moros, you said before you think Chronos is going to influence the weavings of the Fates. You mean he's going to try to change the future? Force a favorable outcome?\"\n Moros : \n\"Yes. I think he's already trying to do just that. Unfortunately for him, the Three Fates can be a bit headstrong. I trust they may be quite resistant as captives.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I can't imagine Chronos tolerating insolence, whether from your sisters or anybody else. How he must hate them! When he was overthrown before, that was the outcome of a fated prophecy...\"\n Moros : \n\"Indeed. As for now, I sense there are no weavings happening at all. No new futures foretold. Chronos believes he has no prophecy to fear. Yet, I believe this is an opportunity for you. To make a better future for us all.\"\nDialogue 04.\n Moros : \n\"Your family has been of keen interest to the Fates for some time, hasn't it? Ever since Chronos learned he was doomed to be usurped by his own children.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"A prophecy that was only fulfilled because Chronos learned of it, and desperately tried to prevent it from coming to pass. Perhaps I'd have an easier time with the Fated List if I try to thwart it at every turn.\"\n Moros : \n\"I wouldn't second-guess too much. Later your father and uncles drew lots to divide up their rule of the world. By \"chance\", your father wound up with the least desirable part, didn't he?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Perhaps the Underworld best suited him. So now it's my turn to see that the will of the Fates is done? If they even planned this far ahead.\"\n Moros : \n\"They \"were \"captured, so this can't all be according to their plan. But they are counting on your aid.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I appreciate their confidence.\"\nDialogue 05.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"How can you be so certain that there are no more weavings taking place? That rather than the Fates setting the course of our lives, there's no pattern anymore... only sheer, mindless chance?\"\n Moros : \n\"I never said I was certain... only that I no longer sensed my sisters' work, and it's a relatively well-honed sense. But, I've also never been apart from my sisters like this. I feel... unmoored.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"As though you don't know where you're going. To me, everything feels the same as ever. Present circumstances notwithstanding. How much control did the Fates truly have?\"\n Moros : \n\"They are highly influential, I can tell you that. But can they force your every action, every thought? Of course not. You are conscious. It was your choice to speak with me just now.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"But the Fates knew we'd meet.\"\n Moros : \n\"Precisely.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You must know the Three Fates better than anyone, besides maybe Nyx, herself! \"Erm\", though, forgive me for invoking her...\"\n Moros : \n\"It's quite all right. The Fates, I know full well, but Mother Nyx...? We saw her seldomly. The nature of our work was such that even she would almost never get involved. Besides, she'd many other children to attend to.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'm sorry to hear that. My mother's the Queen. We've never even met since I was an infant. Nobody around here seems to know their blasted mothers, come to think!\"\n Moros : \n\"Come now, the mothers can't be blamed. We children can be so insufferable, true?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"Heh. \"True.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"How well would you say you know your grandparent, Lord Moros? I'd not expected to meet Primordial Chaos of all beings. But they summoned me to their domain, and... I don't quite know what they want from me.\"\n Moros : \n\"Chaos summoned you...? That is unusual, though not entirely without precedent. And in this case, I can imagine why. Chaos and Mother Nyx were rather close, after all.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"So Chaos seeks their daughter. They did mention something about a quandary.\"\n Moros : \n\"This isn't the first time they took an interest in your family. Or took action that the Fates themselves likely never preordained. I choose to think you've made a new ally.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I hope you're right.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I learned what happened to the Fates, Lord Moros. Or rather, how Chronos discovered where they were. It was Chaos who led Chronos to them. Chaos, of course, seems to regret this now, and I don't think had any ill intent...\"\n Moros : \n\"Oh. That is a lot of information to take in. It does make some amount of sense. Chronos, having free reign in your father's House, eventually found his way to Chaos, then coaxed this vital information out of them. Then, he ambushed the Fates, as part of his plans for conquest.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You're taking all this better than I would have. Come to think of it, I've never seen you angry.\"\n Moros : \n\"You're seeing me right now. It's just, my anger changes nothing, typically. So, Chaos now is working to undo some of the damage caused? Chronos removed one threat in the Fates, but created another. Perhaps an unwise trade.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Making a mockery of Chaos seems unwise to me!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Moros : \n\"Forgive me if I overstep, Princess. It's just... it seems to me that you and Nemesis don't always get along...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Whatever could have given you such an impression, Lord Moros? Perhaps all our incessant squabbles over petty things?\"\n Moros : \n\"They can't be petty things if they're of your concern, or for that matter, hers. I understand there's some dispute about your task. You were chosen for it, she was not. True?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"That's true. Nemesis trained hard, but so have I. The choice was never mine, yet she blames me.\"\n Moros : \n\"If I know Nemesis, she blames herself. Although, she takes it out on you, that I can see. If anyone, she ought to blame the Fates...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I know, right?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Moros : \n\"You and Nemesis appear to have been interacting in a more productive way of late. If I may ask, what changed between you two?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I think we're becoming more comfortable with our respective roles in all of this. And perhaps Nemesis has finally gained a modicum of faith in my ability.\"\n Moros : \n\"I see... although I think there's something more. Her respect for you doesn't seem newly formed.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Could have fooled me.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Moros : \n\"I'd ask what my sister Eris is doing here, but then they say \"wheresoever goes Doom, Strife follows. \"Or the other way around, whether I like it or not. Has she been here long?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"She comes and goes from time to time, typically after some bloody battle between the forces of Chronos and Olympus. We first met a while back. Briefly trained together though Headmistress soon gave up on her, as patient as she is.\"\n Moros : \n\"The Fates gave up on her as well. Ordered that we never interact, that I not clean her messes anymore; although sometimes she'll goad a conversation out of me. I trust she hasn't made your lives too difficult?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"We've managed.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Eris outright attacked me, just as I was approaching Mount Olympus. Who gave her the Adamant Rail, anyway? A weapon once used to slay Titans, turned against the gods...\"\n Moros : \n\"The Rail \"has \"turned against the gods before. Only the Fates know its true and final purpose... but Eris has it by their own decree. Perhaps as a plaything to keep her occupied.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"To keep \"me \"occupied, apparently. Makes me wonder if the Fates want Chronos stopped, or not. Did you and Eris ever fight like this?\"\n Moros : \n\"Oh, yes. Much as I tried to avoid it.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Odysseus\"&gt;Odysseus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Moros : \n\"I'm attempting to contain my enthusiasm for the venerable hero of mortalkind over there, Princess. Our adversary may be crafty, but Odysseus is renowned for his wiles above all.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It figures you would be familiar with the Great Tactician! Likely he evaded you at least once or twice in his life, if his many tales are to be believed.\"\n Moros : \n\"Oh, they're to be believed, I can attest.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Dora\"&gt;Dora&lt;/a&gt;.\n Moros : \n\"Your companion Dora... she's a lively one. Especially for her age. Most of the dead grow quite lethargic over time. Although I suppose things have been more eventful recently.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Dora seems to be quite intrigued by you, Lord Moros. Call it a morbid fascination. You mention her age... she doesn't seem to have any recollection of such details. But, you can just tell?\"\n Moros : \n\"I have my ways. Dora is... well, she's not the eldest one here, though she's been around longer than most. That much is safe for me to divulge.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Huh.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Skelly\"&gt;Schelemeus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Considering how well you seem to know Odysseus, surely you know brave Commander Schelemeus, do you not? Brave and humble, for I scarce know anything about his past.\"\n Moros : \n\"\"Schelemeus\", you say...? I know of no one by that name. And my recollection is infallible. Perhaps he hails from a distant land, presided over by its own strange gods...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"No, that can't be...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Arachne\"&gt;Arachne&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Lord Moros, I've a friend who lives in the woods called Arachne. Long story, but she was on the receiving end of a powerful curse that... changed her into a spider. Do you deal in curses at all?\"\n Moros : \n\"I remember the case of Arachne. I didn't know what became of her after her metamorphosis, so... it's interesting to learn that you are friends. But no... I'm afraid curses aren't my specialty.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You called it \"the case of Arachne. \"She was thought to be the greatest weaver in the world, greater than the gods... greater even than the \"Fates? \"Unwelcome competition, perhaps...?\"\n Moros : \n\"...Perhaps.\"\nWith Other Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Dora\"&gt;Dora&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Dora : \n\"...And so I say, \"begone accursed witch! I have occupied this grove for aeons, long before your pitiable tent came to rest upon it! \"Oh hey Mel.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I see the two of you have met! Lord Moros, Dora speaks the truth as always. She's been here longer than I have, if you can believe it!\"\n Moros : \n\"I can, indeed. For I know an old soul when I see one. It's a pleasure to meet you, Dora. Do let me know if I can be of service in some way.\"\n Dora : \n\"\"Haha. \"Count on it, Horns! Now then, \"I bid your leave. Farewell!\"\n Moros : \n\"Farewell!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Dora : \n\"...His own \"brother? Eugh, \"no way, that is twisted! Your sisters are sick!\"\n Moros : \n\"Well... they have many mortal lives to untangle, so to speak. The work can grow repetitive, lose its spark. So they liven things up from time to time.\"\n Dora : \n\"Oh totally I, I would completely do the same if I were them. I wonder what they did to \"me... \"Could you, like, look me up, or something...?\"\n Moros : \n\"\"Heh! \"I fear I'm not at liberty to do such things.\"\n Dora : \n\"\"Ah\", come on...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Odysseus\"&gt;Odysseus&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Moros : \n\"To be direct with you, Master Odysseus, I am what you might call an admirer. At first, I found you \"extraordinarily \"frustrating, so adept were you at avoiding certain Doom. But gradually, perhaps grudgingly, I grew very impressed.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Oh, \"hah\", I'm... flattered and relieved to hear it, very kind of you to let me know, particularly after... all this time...\"\n Moros : \n\"It's quite humorous, in fact. While you drew breath, I never once had opportunity to tell you!\"\n Odysseus : \n\"\"Erm, \"quite humorous indeed, milord! I intended no offense by avoiding you, you know that, of course? A mortal impulse, whilst in mortal peril.\"\n Moros : \n\"Oh, you were a wonder to behold! There were the Laestrygonian giants, Charybdis, and, lest we forget... the war of Ilium...!\"\n Odysseus : \n\"I never do...!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Moros : \n\"...So then... were you ever certain you had finally met your Doom? Or did you truly think there was always a plan of escape to be discovered, no matter how dire the circumstance?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Well, to be quite frank with you, Moros \u2014 may we be informal thus? I had the hardest time untangling myself not from near-fatal situations, but the arms of certain goddesses... my greatest weakness, looking back...\"\n Moros : \n\"\"Ah\", indeed... but how was this a weakness? As I understand, your wife Penelope stood by your side despite your indiscretions... I trust I do not overstep; I know this can be a sensitive topic with those from the surface.\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Aye, Penelope stood by my side... because I only told her so much about my \"indiscretions\", as you call them. Then when we reunited after death, I had to tell her the rest. She had spent her best years awaiting an unfaithful man.\"\n Moros : \n\"I see. After everything you'd been through, did your relationship end in an amicable way, at least?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Aye, surprisingly enough... it did.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Moros : \n\"...The wooden horse was an exquisite trick. Your own inevitable Doom, misdirected toward your unsuspecting foes! A masterstroke. But my personal favorite had to be the Polyphemus incident...\"\n Odysseus : \n\"You speak of it like an old action yarn. Big bastard massacred my crew. My heart threatened to burst from my chest getting past him, and \"now \"he's up to his old antics with the Goddess there.\"\n Moros : \n\"\"Oh\", but I have no doubt that with your guidance, the Princess shall outsmart the Cyclops \"again \"and \"again. \"As recompense for the trouble that he caused you!\"\n Odysseus : \n\"Hear that, Goddess?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Moros : \n\"...Nevertheless, I feel as though I ought have been there, Brother. Perhaps I could have protected them as was my charge. To think the Fates themselves may have denied me the attempt. It's discomforting that I may never know.\"\n Charon : \n\"\"Keeehhhh, hraaauuggghhh...!\"\n Moros : \n\"You have every reason to be angry. I'm angry, too. Nonetheless, I'm grateful that our paths have intertwined again. Be safe, Charon.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Moros : \n\"Charon... you, Nemesis, even Hypnos. Who else, Eris? It seems I was one of the last to know of these Crossroads among the children of Nyx. Perhaps I ought have stayed in better contact.\"\n Charon : \n\"\"Mrrnngggghhh, hnnnn...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Come, Lord Charon, your brother is our guest. And even if you did all drift apart, you're here together now. Moving forward.\"\n Moros : \n\"Wait, how did you...? No matter.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hypnos\"&gt;Hypnos&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hypnos : \n\"\"Zzzzzzzzz\"...\"\n Moros : \n\"How strange to be encountering this brother of mine here. So then he truly hasn't stirred at all?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Not once. Headmistress Hecate says Hypnos was already fast asleep when she recovered him from my father's House. You never visited him there before?\"\n Moros : \n\"It wasn't my place. We each come from big families, don't we? Odd families.

You're not doing yourself any favors by impeding the will of the Fates. Have you heard of even a single incident where that turned out for the best?\"\n Eris : \n\"\"No! \"But there's a first time for everything, and I'm not interested in hearing veiled threats from them through \"you. \"If they care so much about what I'm up to, why don't they contact me \"themselves?\"\n Moros : \n\"You know that isn't how it works.

Gotta tell me why you're really \"here! \"The Three don't just send you out on long \"assignments \"like this! Wait... is it because of \"her?\"\n Moros : \n\"Please, Eris. The Princess ought to be addressed as such. And lest you forget, the details of my arrival are not for me to divulge. There must be something else we can discuss.\"\n Eris : \n\"\"Oh\", I can think of \"lots \"of things. I want to know what's going on with you two. I see the way you look up at her as she trots by. Maybe the Three sent you here to \"set the two of you up...?\"\n Moros : \n\"You're trying to embarrass me... it isn't going to work. And besides, we both know the Fates have better uses of their weaving-time than things like that.\"\n Eris : \n\"Do they \"really? \"Thought they were all about meddling with the smallest details of everybody's lives! \"But\", you'd know better than me.\"\n Moros : \n\"I know better than to be provoked like this...\"\n Eris : \n\"\"Hm!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Nemesis : \n\"...And there she is! Shouldn't you be halfway down to Tartarus by now?\"\n Moros : \n\"Princess. Thank the Fates you're well. Nemesis and I, we were just catching up. She's told me a lot about you.\"\n\"Oh, great. I can imagine! Though, you never told me about your brother, Nemesis...\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Got a lot of brothers. What's to tell?

Come on! Their prophecies are vague because they don't really know what's coming.\"\n Moros : \n\"Even if that were true, the burden of choosing who deserves what... I wouldn't want to bear it on my own. Otherwise my judgment would have to be perfect at all times; yet we are fallible beings.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Speak for yourself.\"\n Moros : \n\"I was...\"\nGifts.\n&lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Lord Moros, as our honored guest, \"erm\", we wanted you to have this.

Forgive me, I don't quite know what to say, except... thank you.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You're very welcome! Though, I'd not intended it as \"flattery\", it's just... Don't even mention it, all right?\"\n3rd Time.\n Moros : \n\"You're very kind to me, Princess. I arrived at these Crossroads in a desperate state. I didn't expect to be made welcome here.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"And I didn't expect to meet Doom face-to-face, much less for him to be rather agreeable. Yet here we are!\"\n4th Time.\n Moros : \n\"Why, thank you for this, truly, though you needn't go out of your way for me. You've been so generous. Forgive my asking, but... this isn't due to some sort of prophecy in the Fated List, is it?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"No! \"No, of course not, Lord Moros. Although, even if it was, I would be duty-bound not to inform you, wouldn't I?\"\n Moros : \n\"\"Heh! \"That's true.\"\n5th Time.\n Moros : \n\"I'm honored to accept this, Princess Melino\u00eb. When the Fates first indicated that we'd meet, I asked them what I should expect; what you were like. Clotho smiled and simply said, \"you'll see. \"I felt certain they were playing a prank!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You make me glad I don't have any sisters, Lord Moros. So what would you have said in Clotho's place?\"\n Moros : \n\"Oh! Perhaps I would have said... she's a great witch and enchantress. The Princess of the Underworld, daughter to the goddess of spring and the lord of the dead. Though whatever you imagine her to be... she's more.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"...That's not bad.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Ambrosia\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Lord Moros, I wanted you to have this either way, though if you're not too busy at the moment, would you care to share it with me at the taverna? I know this is sudden, it's just... I'm past due for a little break...\"\n Moros : \n\"Princess Melino\u00eb, it would be my pleasure. Would you please lead the way?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"...So, it \"can \"be a lot, of course. I don't know what's the better source of motivation, those completely certain I'll succeed in everything, or those completely certain that I'll fail.\"\n Moros : \n\"\"Hah! \"I have the same thought pattern frequently. The Fates, they could anticipate the outcomes of my efforts and would chastise me sometimes for small mistakes I'd yet to make. It wasn't always as encouraging as intended.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Then, where did you find the strength? Your responsibilities sound like they must have been a lot.\"\n Moros : \n\"It all simply became a force of habit at some point. You practice a skill to a level of proficiency, then fear letting it go... fear you'll never be as capable at other things...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I wouldn't have expected Doom himself to harbor such misgivings.\"\n Moros : \n\"Well! Perhaps I should have been born as \"Fear! \"So then where do \"you \"think it comes from? Your source of motivation for your task.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I've decided it comes from the thought of finding more of this Ambrosia out there; this is \"good!\"\n Moros : \n\"I very much enjoyed your company, Princess, and thank you for the drink. I trust we'll have more opportunities like this?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I trust so too.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Bath%20Salts\"&gt;Bath Salts&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Have you experienced our hotsprings yet, Lord Moros? The waters cleanse the body and the mind. I'm headed over if you'd care to join me?\"\n Moros : \n\"Why, I... I don't see why not! I've seen and heard about such springs as these, though never been.\"\n Moros : \n\"...To think that such a place is hidden here...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"So, what did you and the Fates do for recreation where you're from, anyhow?\"\n Moros : \n\"Have I mentioned that they liked to weave? Their weaving was their occupation and their \"passion. \"I never got too good at it myself, and all they needed was the three of them, so...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I know an excellent spinstress who could maybe help with your technique. What did you do while they were busy spinning away?\"\n Moros : \n\"Well, I would travel the world! To witness mortals in their final moments. Look them square in the face as they perished... often in horror...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"...You do this for recreation's sake?\"\n Moros : \n\"The nature of the role leaves little time for recreation. And it's all I could do to make those final moments dignified... though I don't think the gesture always comes across.\"\n Moros : \n\"I've not felt so refreshed in... well, it's been a while now. Thank you again.\"\n2nd Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Lord Moros, would you accompany me to the springs again sometime? And by sometime I mean... are you busy now?\"\n Moros : \n\"I feared you'd never ask again, Princess! I've longed for the warmth of the springs since last we visited.\"\n Moros : \n\"...I surely can get used to this...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Your relationship with the Fates sounds like it must have been a complicated one. You've never been on your own, have you?\"\n Moros : \n\"I haven't. They're my sisters, and my elders. I grew up under their watchful eye, and I'm more than their brother; I was their guardian. But I couldn't protect them, in the end. Perhaps they always knew I'd fail them, and loved me anyway.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You can't go thinking like that. You had one of the most important responsibilities in the world. The Fates are as all-knowing as they come, aren't they? Then it stands to reason there wasn't anybody better suited for the task than you.\"\n Moros : \n\"...Princess? Would you just let me wallow in my misery a bit? \"Ah... \"no, wait. Forget it. It's gone. A mighty incantation on your part just now.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"Heh\", anyway. I know you love your sisters, but... the circumstances being what they are, perhaps some distance will be good for you.\"\n Moros : \n\"Perhaps... These springs are good for me, of that I have no doubt.\"\n Moros : \n\"I think I really needed that. And always wonderful to have your company.\"\nGift Decline.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I was thinking about a visit to the hot springs and thought you might be interested, my lord.\"\n Moros : \n\"Respectfully, Princess, I've past events to document so I had better not. Some other time, perhaps?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Twin%20Lures\"&gt;Twin Lures&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Say, Lord Moros, would you accompany me to the riverside? I've a feeling your mere presence may help with the evening's catch.\"\n Moros : \n\"I have a way with mortal creatures of all sorts, so I'll accompany you, yes.\"\n Moros : \n\"Forgive me, though I never have quite understood the compulsion to extract water-creatures from their natural environs. I know for mortals it is sometimes necessary sustenance, though others do it for the sake of sport. Why?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"For mortals, it seems to be an opportunity to assert themselves over the natural world. Though I would take no pride in outsmarting such creatures if I were them. In our case... we safeguard habitats for all the species that we find.\"\n Moros : \n\"That seems like a burdensome responsibility for creatures that ought to take better care of themselves.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Well there's more to it, I suppose. For one thing... it sets a contemplative mood, right? Means we can talk a little about matters unrelated to our \"own \"burdensome responsibilities.\"\n Moros : \n\"I can certainly appreciate that part. And now we wait...\"\n Moros : \n\"Perhaps it's good to let the mind wander a bit to such pursuits, every once in a while.\"\nGift Decline.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I don't suppose you'd join me for a little while at the fishing pier, Lord Moros? Thought we could use these Twin Lures.\"\n Moros : \n\"\"Ah! \"I fear the river denizens will not approach this evening if I'm there, for they can sense me every now and then. Apologies.\""}

After his birth, Nyx entrusted Moros to them, who would raise him to be their herald. Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos are considered harsh even by their own family members, but Moros doesn't see them in that light. To him, they are simply fulfilling their duties, although he admits feeling powerless when contemplating the level of control they exert over reality, even his own.\nMoros mentions that sometimes he's unsure if his sisters are playing with him; they always tease him about small mistakes or when he makes none at all. Sometimes he feels like they send him to fetch something just to keep him out of something that doesn't concern him, and he already feels guilty for thinking of them that way. Despite this, Moros remains dedicated to his sisters and feels a certain duty of gratitude towards them, knowing deep down that they value and cherish him as much as he does them. Their intricate bond is a testament to the strength of family, even in the face of uncertain destiny.\nHe sees himself as their herald and protector, but when Chronos came for his sisters, they sent him away to protect him. On several occasions, he expresses guilt for not being able to protect them and feels he's failing his purpose as a protector. He places them on a higher pedestal, believing they would know better than him how to help, and their work is much more important than his.\nCharon.\n&lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;: Moros' older brother&lt;br&gt;Moros can occasionally be seen talking with Charon at The Crossroads. It is implied that they didn't speak very often before the events of Hades II, and that Charon is apparently displeased by this (though it is difficult to ascertain what exactly Charon is saying). Evidently, Moros can understand Charon, and reacts with surprise when he sees that Melino\u00eb can as well.\nMoros respectfully addresses his brother, maybe prioritizing his wisdom. Charon inherited the words of Nyx, so whenever Moros attempts to argue with him, Charon always has the final word.\nNemesis.\n&lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;: Moros' younger sister&lt;br&gt;As is the case with many of Nyx's children, Nemesis and Moros aren't particularly close. According to Nemesis, their interactions generally only occur under professional circumstances, specifically when their duties (as the embodiments of doom and retribution respectively) intersect. Functionally, their relationship is more akin to that of a pair of co-workers than of siblings.\nIt can be observed, however, that they still have typical sibling arguments because of their conflicting beliefs. Moros argues that Nemesis shouldn't dictate what's best for mortals, deferring to destiny for the final decision. However, Nemesis, being stubborn, resists the idea of destiny dictating her actions.\nMoros notices her change in demeanor, remarking on his sister's newfound calmness and greater tolerance, particularly towards Melino\u00eb.\nHypnos.\n&lt;a href=\"Hypnos\"&gt;Hypnos&lt;/a&gt;: Moros' younger brother&lt;br&gt;Outside of being kin, Moros does not have any sort of relationship with Hypnos. When Melino\u00eb asks him if he never visited Hypnos at the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt;, Moros will reply that it was not his place to do so.\nThanatos.\n&lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;: Moros' younger brother&lt;br&gt;Like Hypnos, Moros did not form any sort of relationship with Thanatos.\nEris.\n&lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt;: Moros' younger sister&lt;br&gt;Even Moros, with his calm demeanor, has no patience for his younger sister's mischief. Both Moros and Nemesis, being more organized, mention the constant conflicts with her.\nThe Crossroads.\nMelino\u00eb.\n&lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;: Moros' ally&lt;br&gt;Moros first encounters Melino\u00eb when she attempts to contact the Fates and he answers in their stead. He is surprised and flattered when she later summons him to the crossroads, where he oversees her progress on the &lt;a href=\"Fated%20List%20of%20Minor%20Prophecies\"&gt;Fated List of Minor Prophecies&lt;/a&gt;. She often asks him questions about the Fates in her effort to locate and rescue them, a cause he is eager to help with. \nThough he is generally polite and friendly towards all of the characters he interacts with, he is a little more willing to be vulnerable with Melino\u00eb, like when he vents about how the Fates may have known that he would fail to protect them from Chronos. He isn't used to the level of hospitality she shows to her friends, and is often surprised by her kind gestures.\nHecate.\n&lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt;: Moros' ally/host&lt;br&gt;Although their relationship isn't shown Moros is respectful with Hecate and considers her to be a generous hostess. In a conversation with Melino\u00eb, he will tell her that Hecate has been teaching him witchcraft.\nOdysseus.\n&lt;a href=\"Odysseus\"&gt;Odysseus&lt;/a&gt;: Moros' ally&lt;br&gt;Moros is an admirer of Odysseus, when Odysseus was alive Moros found him to be frustrating due to the former's ability to escape his Doom. Over time, Moros became impressed with him even wishing to tell him of his respect for him in person when Odysseus was alive. When Moros speaks to Melino\u00eb about Odysseus he praises his cunning. When the two finally meet Moros is nothing but cordial with Odysseus, revealing his admiration for him and the two discuss various topics such a Odysseus' former wife Penelope.\nSchelemeus.\n&lt;a href=\"Skelly\"&gt;Schelemeus&lt;/a&gt;: Moros' ally&lt;br&gt;When Melino\u00eb asks Moros if he knows Commander Schelemeus, Moros replies that he has never heard of him despite his keen memory and speculates that Schelemeus might be from a distant land with their own gods.\nTitans.\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;: Moros' enemy&lt;br&gt;Moros is understandably angry at Chronos for kidnapping his sisters, whom he is very close to. This is one of the reasons why he is willing to show support for Melino\u00eb's campaign against the Titan."}

It's all in vain, as his only love is his own.\nA figure who took the concept of self-love very seriously, Narcissus only cares about himself, forgetting others, with dialogues filled with comedy. He seems to mistakenly believe that Melino\u00eb is named \"Laurel,\" proof of his egocentric nature, despite her repeated clarifications.\nGiven the attention he claims to receive, Narcissus has become excessively egocentric, spoiled, and superficial. He fails to distinguish Melino\u00eb from his numerous other suitors (even among the gods themselves) and fans. A revealing sign of what Echo means to him.\nHe's accustomed to the spotlight, appearing demanding and dramatic, longing for personal space. Though initially seeming to delight in the attention from other shades, it later becomes evident that he finds his legion of suitors irritating, as they distract him from admiring his reflection.\nAlthough he doesn't care about anyone else but himself, even acting indifferent in Nemesis' presence, he's not without heart, as with time he starts to wonder what happened to Echo and somewhat care, in his own way. With Melino\u00eb's incentive, he might take it upon himself to visit Echo down in the &lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Mourning\"&gt;Fields of Mourning&lt;/a&gt;, and even though there isn't any better than Oceanus for him, this shows how impactful Echo was in his life, for he did not forget her.\nPhysical description.\nNarcissus is a young, handsome and muscular man with toned skin and curly black hair which gets greener on its tips, faintly looking like algae. He also wears a cape which is covered in flowers and moss alongside the rest of his body, as if they had grown over time as he stayed still gazing upon himself. His eyes are yellow, he has pointy ears and is seemingly naked.\nHistory.\nBefore Hades II.\nNarcissus is an attractive former hunter whose beauty attractred many admirers, but he rejected them all, as he himself didn't have any feelings for them. This would culminate after he rejected the mountain nymph &lt;a href=\"Echo\"&gt;Echo&lt;/a&gt;, leading to the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt; and retribution incarnate &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt; to put a curse on him in which he ends up falling in love with his own reflection, refusing to leave, which in turn leads to his death. \nUpon arriving to &lt;a href=\"the%20Underworld\"&gt;the Underworld&lt;/a&gt;, Narcissus was sent to &lt;a href=\"Asphodel\"&gt;Asphodel&lt;/a&gt;; however, he didn't like the place much. So, once &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt; took over the underworld, sending it to chaos, Narcissus made his way to &lt;a href=\"Oceanus\"&gt;Oceanus&lt;/a&gt; where he resumed admiring his own reflection.\nHades II.\nNarcissus can be found lovely looking at his own reflection when the goddess &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; encounters him. He has no interest in her and even mistakes her for another of his admirers, so he offers her gifts he had received in attempts to drive her away. \nWhen the waters of his pool turn murky, making him unable to see himself, Narcissus ends up going into despair, and with nothing else to do thinks back on his life, where he realizes how harshly he had treated Echo, who still has a crush on him after all this time. With this epiphany, he ventures to the &lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Mourning\"&gt;Fields of Mourning&lt;/a&gt; where he finally clears things up between himself and &lt;a href=\"Echo\"&gt;Echo&lt;/a&gt;. \nHe later returns to Oceanus once the murky water is cleared and continues to stare at his reflections while still gifting Melino\u00eb to shoo her away. He eventually gets approached by Nemesis, whom he has no recollection of despite her part in the curse that led to his demise.\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nConcept=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Another would-be suitor journeyed far and wide, just to gaze upon me, not that I blame you... and get totally rejected! \"Fine. \"Ogle if you \"must.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You have the wrong idea. I'm not seeking a mate. I don't even know who you are.\"\n Narcissus : \n\"What? I'm Narcissus, dummy! \"The \"Narcissus? And if you're no would-be suitor... then why don't you relieve me of one of these innumerable gifts the others offered in vain. \"Then beat it.\"\nKeepsake Dialogue (&lt;a href=\"Aromatic%20Phial\"&gt;Aromatic Phial&lt;/a&gt;).\n Narcissus : \n\"There was this wonderful aroma in the air just now... lilac on a summer breeze, or something like that. I \"thought \"it was you. But it's just the gift I gave you before. \"Good stuff.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"This Aromatic Phial you gave me does smell rather pleasant, doesn't it? I scarcely notice with all the brine and fishy odor around here. Though it doesn't seem to bother you.\"\n Narcissus : \n\"Oh I just tune it out. Like all the rest. I give my undivided attention... to \"me... \"and I guess some of it to you, but you don't stay for long so it's OK.\"\nAbout Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Nothing gets to you! A war rages between the Titan Chronos and the gods, but you've shown not even the slightest concern. What's your secret?\"\n Narcissus : \n\"I don't keep secrets, Laurel. It's just that... \"I don't care. \"If it doesn't affect me, it doesn't affect me. Got enough problems of my own... such as, how best to get rid of all \"these.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Narcissus : \n\"\"Huh\", it's only you. Been getting crowded lately between all these chats and \"what's-her-name \"stomping around... least you're not \"her.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"What's-her-name, that sounds like Nemesis. Scornful expression, dark hair and armor? What's your concern with her?\"\n Narcissus : \n\"Gives me a bad \"vibe. \"Storms around, shakes everything up. Something about her, I don't know. Don't hurt my head, OK?\"\nDialogue 02 (Post Nemesis Visit).\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Are you all right? Nemesis can be rather terse. She didn't hurt you or anything, did she?\"\n Narcissus : \n\"She said something just there... about how I'm \"stuck forever in the company of a buffoon. \"She couldn't have meant... no way. She's jealous. She \"likes \"me! And playing hard-to-get. Unlike \"some \"people, who come on a little strong.\"\nDialogue 03 (Post Nemesis Visit).\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I don't think Nemesis was playing hard-to-get. She wants to make certain you don't have too much of a good thing! Fortunately, I think she may leave you alone from here out.\"\n Narcissus : \n\"Is that so? Or are you just trying to get her out of the picture so you can have me to \"yourself? \"Expecting special favors just because you helped me with the water situation, \"eugh!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"What? I don't want any special favors from you! Although... I fear I've grown accustomed to the gifts you've offered me each time I visit. How easily we take to certain habits.\"\n Narcissus : \n\"Yeah well, \"I've \"taken to getting a headache whenever you talk about this stuff. I'm gonna keep giving you these because I pity you... and because I \"don't want 'em.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Echo\"&gt;Echo&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You're very focused. Centered on the self. Become inured somehow to the incessant singing that always echoes through these halls.\"\n Narcissus : \n\"Speak not to me of Echo's this or Echo's that, OK? Echo meant nothing to me and somehow got the wrong idea anyway. And don't \"you \"get any ideas either.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"Speak not to me of echoes\", what...? I'm talking about Scylla's song. You've somehow learned to block it out, though... gods, I think I'm beginning to like it...\"\n Narcissus : \n\"How about I learn to block \"you \"out! With \"this.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"Echo meant nothing to you\", what... I was talking about Scylla's song and how you've blocked it out. Come to think, I can't quite hear it now either.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Narcissus : \n\"Look, I can tell you're having trouble moving on. Maybe you ought to spend a little time down in the Fields. Clear your head, put the pieces of your heart back together, and all that?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"If you mean the Mourning Fields, I don't think that's a healing place. The Shades there wallow in self-pity and speechless despair. Although, there is one who repeats whatever I say to her...\"\n Narcissus : \n\"Repeats whatever you say to her! I knew a Nymph like that one time. Nice girl. But she didn't get me! Only ever talked about \"herself. \"I had to cut her off.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"So you do know Echo, the Mountain Nymph! She's languishing in the Fields even now. Apparently because of you. I can hardly get through to her...\"\n Narcissus : \n\"Oh, that's too bad. Well, tell her Narcissus really wants what's best for her. Unless that's \"me. \"Don't tell her that part, though.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I spoke to Echo about you. Said you didn't mean to hurt her, though perhaps I shouldn't have. She responded in her usual way but I could tell something happened. You broke her heart?\"\n Narcissus : \n\"She broke her \"own \"heart! They always fall for people who don't love them back. Anyway, I'm sure she'll find someone who thinks she's... \"awesome. \"Plenty of fish... \"in the sea!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Yes, I've noticed. So, has anybody ever fallen out of love with you? Or do they all end up in the Mourning Fields, pining for you for eternity?\"\n Narcissus : \n\"All I know is no one's ever loved me as much as \"me. \"They're all too busy feeling sorry for themselves to really care, you know? Can't love someone... if you can't love \"yourself.\"\nDialogue 04.\n Narcissus : \n\"Hey tell me something. Is Echo really not OK? I thought about the things you said, how she was all alone down in the Fields... how could I hurt someone without even trying, you know?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Narcissus, don't take this the wrong way, but I'm impressed you've given any thought to someone else. As for Echo, she seems to be getting by. Is there something you'd like to say to her should I cross paths with her again?\"\n Narcissus : \n\"Sure, \"um... \"go ahead and tell her that I hope she finds someone who loves her like I love \"me. \"But don't tell her I said it, she'd just get the wrong idea and her heart would break... again.\"\nDialogue 05.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Do you think you'll ever visit Echo again in the Fields? You seemed to have no trouble getting there and back.\"\n Narcissus : \n\"You know, maybe I might! But it's a little crowded there, and I do like it here. So then again, maybe I won't! We made a clean break. Why mess with a \"perfectly good thing?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Scylla%20and%20the%20Sirens\"&gt;The Sirens&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Ever been to one of the local shows around here? Scylla and the Sirens keep playing night after night, much as I'd hoped they'd move on to the next stage of their tour by now...\"\n Narcissus : \n\"Only music that I care for is \"my voice. \"The rest can get so loud, it disturbs the surface of the water. And whatever disturbs the surface of the water... \"disturbs me.\"\nWith Other Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Echo\"&gt;Echo&lt;/a&gt; (While in &lt;a href=\"Oceanus\"&gt;Oceanus&lt;/a&gt; Wearing The &lt;a href=\"Concave%20Stone\"&gt;Concave Stone&lt;/a&gt;).\n Narcissus : \n\"Be seeing you, Laurel!\"\n Melino\u00eb: \n\"It's Melino\u00eb! Forget it...\"\n Echo : \n\"Melino\u00eb, forget it... forget it... \"forget it...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Nemesis : \n\"...Look at me when I'm talking to you, you louse. Oh, right. You can't. Must be so sick of staring at yourself by now.\"\n Narcissus : \n\"The only thing I'm sick of, \"I-Forget-Your-Name\", is you tramping about, disturbing my peace! If you don't have anything nice to say, why don't you \"go?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Still indignant after all this time. Had you learned to show respect, you might not be stuck forever in the company of a buffoon. Well, drink it in.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Nemesis?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Nemesis : \n\"...Tell me again I'm playing \"hard-to-get\", and so help me, I will pluck your limbs from you one at a time like they're the petals of an \"itty bitty flower. \"How's that sound?\"\n Narcissus : \n\"Sounds \"bad\", that's how! But also like something somebody playing hard-to-get would say. So I don't know! Now why don't you... \"tell me some more about yourself?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Wait, you want me to \"stay. \"Something's come over you, all right. Well, clear enough that my work here is done. Know what's good for you, then don't go breaking any other hearts.\"\n Narcissus : \n\"Oh \"yeah. \"She wants you, man. That much is \"very \"clear!\"\n Narcissus : \n\"Speaking of which...\"\nAbouth the Scenery.\n&lt;a href=\"Oceanus\"&gt;Oceanus&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Narcissus, how did you discover this place anyhow? I'd not expected to have a friendly chat along the outskirts of the Underworld.\"\n Narcissus : \n\"I always knew my way around the rivers and the seas. After I died, I got stuck in Asphodel for a while. Way too \"dry. \"So once the Underworld opened up, I swam straight here. Where it's \"cool.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Narcissus : \n\"Hey what's your problem, anyway? Always huffing through here like you're late to something. You got to learn to \"relax.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Sounds like you were there when the Underworld opened up. It shouldn't have.\"\n Narcissus : \n\"How come? That way I'd still be shriveled up in Asphodel! Know what, though, just forget I asked. You're killing my mood here.\"\nMiscellaneous Conversations.\nSeeing &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; at Low Health.\nDialogue 01.\n Narcissus : \n\"Uh \"whoa \"what's wrong with you? Coming in here like that. You don't need \"me\", dummy. You need a doctor, or \"healer\", or something.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Yes, well, I've found those somewhat difficult to locate around here. Though on the flip side, no shortage of fishlike monstrosities determined to cut me a set of gills.\"\n Narcissus : \n\"Yeah that's what they all say. Look, there's probably a fountain or something somewhere around here. Wash up, come back, we'll \"talk.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Narcissus : \n\"\"Whew, \"you are never gonna find a mate looking all scratched up like that, bleeding everywhere. Might have something you could use to patch yourself up, if it'll make you go away.\"\nAbout Looks.\nDialogue 01.\n Narcissus : \n\"I have one rule, and that's \"look, but don't touch\", OK? In fact, why don't you stand a little farther back, and also tell me how come you keep showing up like this?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I've some affairs to settle in the lower reaches of the Underworld. Thought I'd take this rather scenic route, through this chamber of yours.\"\n Narcissus : \n\"Oh, it isn't my chamber. I just find the waters here particularly clean and reflective, and far fewer would-be suitors than in Asphodel. Remember to take a gift before you go!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Narcissus : \n\"Sometimes I wonder, what would it have been like were I not so unbelievably attractive? Some things would've been easier... not having everybody fall in love with me... maybe arithmetic...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You're concerned that you're too winsome for your own good...? Well if it makes you feel any better, I don't find you particularly attractive...\"\n Narcissus : \n\"Oh, I know you don't mean that. Though I appreciate you trying to comfort me. \"As a friend.\"\nAbout Beauty.\n Narcissus : \n\"Here comes Laurel or whatever her name is. I was just thinking about the time we met. I mean, the time I first gazed upon my reflection. Up till that point, man, I had \"no idea...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I have to say, I don't think I've met anyone who's quite so taken with themselves as you, Narcissus. I'm a little envious. When I see myself... I see so many flaws.\"\n Narcissus : \n\"\"Oof\", I know what you mean. Not everybody's born with perfect skin... lustrous hair... total package. But everybody's beautiful in their own way! \"Even you.\"\nAbout Love.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It's hard to believe you're so completely in love with yourself. Don't you ever... consider the mistakes you've made, or ways in which you can improve? Or \"not \"improve, even...\"\n Narcissus : \n\"What, are you kidding? How could you possibly improve on \"this? \"Though, I definitely see your point. In your case.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Was that a bit of ridicule, or do you in fact have some keen bit of insight or feedback about me you're willing to share?\"\n Narcissus : \n\"If you're unhappy with the way you are, why don't you just, like, \"change? \"Or if you can't... get over it I guess, I don't know.\"\nAbout Solitude.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Don't you get lonely sitting here, staring into those waters? Especially in a place like this.\"\n Narcissus : \n\"Lonely? I don't know the meaning of the word. I have the best company you could ever ask for: \"Me!\"\nAbout Danger.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Don't the vicious creatures contaminating these chambers make this a rather dangerous place in which to laze about?\"\n Narcissus : \n\"Oh, I've made clear to them that they don't stand a chance with me at all. In my position, it's not good to send mixed messages. Both for my suitor's sakes... and for \"my own.\"\nAbout Reflection.\nDialogue 01.\n Narcissus : \n\"...Don't worry, man, she's not so bad, she doesn't stay for long. Soon it'll just be you and me again... and all those \"Shades \"back there.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Pardon the interruption, Narcissus. Were you just... speaking to your own reflection there?\"\n Narcissus : \n\"They're always quick to judge, aren't they? Look, Laurel, or whatever your name is: You'll never understand what I've got. Don't even \"try.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Narcissus : \n\"...What would you say is your best quality, if you had to choose? The one thing you most adore... what drives everyone around you \"wild...?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Oh, I, \"erm... \"well... I'm quite attentive, I think. If you tell me something, you don't have to tell me twice! Chances are I'll take it to heart the first time. Though, why do you ask?\"\n Narcissus : \n\"\"Pff\", there she goes, butting into our private conversations! I know your best quality, man: your \"looks. \"Whoever says looks aren't everything's a dummy. Like this girl over here! Just give her a gift, and she leaves us alone!\"\nDialogue 03.\n Narcissus : \n\"...Got to say, your hair is looking \"awesome \"lately, you know? Whole wet-look thing! Must be all the humidity and brine. \"Keep it up.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I was about to thank you for the compliment when it occurred to me that you're just talking to yourself again, most likely. In which case, forgive the interruption!\"\n Narcissus : \n\"Don't worry about it. I have plenty of time to myself. But you only get to see me, what, maybe once a day, tops? Better than nothing, though \"not nearly enough.\"\nDialogue 04.\n Narcissus : \n\"...Hey remember the time you were, like, checking yourself out, and then a bee or something lands right on your face, so you swat it, \"bam! \"Your eye was swollen shut for like a week. You looked \"terrible\", man!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Pardon, Narcissus. That sounds like it must have been a harrowing experience. Was your love for yourself tested when the reflection staring back at you had a big puffy eyelid?\"\n Narcissus : \n\"\"No! \"I mean... not really. But this love is more than skin-deep. Even if I can't look at me... I can still talk to me... and even if I can't do that, I can always \"think \"about me, you know? And so can \"you.\"\nAbout Dirty Waters.\nDialogue 01.\n Narcissus : \n\"Oh it's you again. Look, I... want you to leave me alone, OK? Because I'm in a state of grief. And the only one I want to see me that way... is \"me.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"State of grief\", wait. What's with the water here...? It's gone all murky or something. Oh, no! You can't see your reflection anymore...\"\n Narcissus : \n\"Don't need to rub it in, dummy! Not like you can do something about it anyway. A lot of things turn ugly after a while. So please excuse me while I mourn for what I've lost...\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"These waters are still filthy. I know all sorts of purification rites. You've aided me so often, the least I can do is help sort this out.\"\n Narcissus : \n\"And what exactly do you have in mind, a bunch of soap? I don't think that's gonna work. It's a big sea out there. No, I think... I think I'm just gonna have to move on...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"That may be just the thing. You said before you wished to mourn for what you've lost. I know the perfect place for that. Find Echo in the Mourning Fields, sincerely speak to her, thus cleansing your aura... and I can do the rest.\"\n Narcissus : \n\"You think me talking to Echo's gonna clear things up? Well... couldn't hurt, I guess. And they love me down in the Fields! Tell you what. I'm gonna... \"give it some thought...\"\nDialogue 03.\n Narcissus : \n\"Oh, hey. Yeah I'm still here and everything. Though I've been thinking of a visit to the Fields one of these days. Nights? I dunno.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Take all the time you need. I know it must be difficult, and the trip is treacherous. You could accompany me if you wish?\"\n Narcissus : \n\"Sounds like a date, \"no \"thanks. I get around just fine all by myself. But for now... I can still see a bit of my reflection if I squint hard enough. \"It's a good look...\"\nDialogue 04.\n Narcissus : \n\"I talked to Echo like you said I should. What \"gives? \"This place is still the same! I thought you were gonna fix everything.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Fear not, I keep my vows; I still have a purification rite to complete. I appreciate that you had the courage to meet with Echo, even if it was for your own sake.\"\n Narcissus : \n\"Yeah, well, that's love for you, right? I guess I'll just... hang out here till you do your thing. The Fields are nice and all, but... too many would-be suitors over there.\"\nDialogue 05.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You're still wallowing in misery trying to see your reflection in a muddy pool. Why not just relocate? The waters aren't like this everywhere.\"\n Narcissus : \n\"...I'll never leave you, man. I got us into this, I'll find a way to get us out, OK? So don't you quit on me! We'll figure something out, just need to stay focused. No distractions!\"\nDialogue 06.\n Narcissus : \n\"Laurel, look! The waters are all clear! You don't know how glad I am to see \"me. \"You must have done your thing! I'd give you a hug or something, but... I wouldn't want you to take it the wrong way.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Excellent. So then the purification worked out after all. Echo must have taken whatever you said to heart. Perhaps you're not as hopelessly self-absorbed as I feared.\"\n Narcissus : \n\"...Say what? Sorry, I was just... yeah, I mean, just \"look \"at this, the \"chin\", the turn of the \"cheek... \"have you ever seen anything like it? Tell Echo I said hi. But as a \"friend.\"\nGifts.\n&lt;a href=\"Nectar\"&gt;Nectar&lt;/a&gt;.\nGiving Gift.\n Narcissus : \n\"Don't know how to thank you for the water-cleaning thing! Look at how crisp my reflection is! And the color contrast, \"ungh! \"You've got a real future in water sanitation!\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Perhaps the improved image quality will help you start to notice details other than yourself. The effect of the purification should last longer if you do.\"\n Narcissus : \n\"What I'm trying to say is, I've decided to give to you the greatest gift of all that I've received. So here's something from my \"private reserve!\"\n&lt;/div\n1st Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"As you've made no attempt to snap my head from my shoulders unlike many other things lurking about, I'm compelled to give you this. Just as a casual acquaintance, to be clear.\"\n Narcissus : \n\"You'd give me such tokens of affection, full knowing I've already got a lot of them and, more importantly, am spoken for? Fine! Here's something to remember me by.\"\n\"Narcissus gives &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Aromatic%20Phial\"&gt;Aromatic Phial&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"How could I ever forget you, Narcissus?\"\n2nd Time.\n Narcissus : \n\"Whoa, a present, you're so thoughtful and all that. Don't mean to be rude about it, just... don't get the wrong idea, OK?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"If I'm to keep taking from your copious supply of unused gifts, seems only fair that I give something in return from time to time.\"\n3rd Time.\n Narcissus : \n\"Oh! How thoughtful, and all that. You dummy, though! Don't you realize I'm just going to add this to the pile with the rest, so that some other would-be suitor ends up taking it?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Sure, it's a gift! You get to decide what to do with it. Perhaps one of those other would-be suitors would enjoy it, if that's what you want.\"\n4th Time.\n Narcissus : \n\"Oh whoa, for \"me\", how thoughtful. Look: Try all you like, I can't requite your \"love. \"Thought I'd make myself about as clear as these waters, just in case you've got the wrong idea \"again.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Not every gesture needs to be interpreted as having some romantic overtones, does it? You've made your feelings unambiguous, and I appreciate that. \"As a friend.\""}

Melino\u00eb still tries to find good in him and strike conversation, most times to no avail.\nWhen the water of his glade becomes murky, she promises to solve the situation and says he could go find Echo as he waits. Although he isn't too fond of the idea, he eventually goes, and Melino\u00eb can see him besides Echo on rare occasion.

He shall eventually have no more ideas. But the Prince, as often is the case, is wrong.\"&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n[Inescapable] - \"The master of this realm, Lord Hades, states that death is inescapable.

And then, what shall become of him and I? Well, hopefully, not this:\"&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n[Peel] - \"In his great hurry to explore the country-side, the hapless-footed Prince steps on the peel of a most-exotic sallow-colored fruit, and tumbles backward with such sudden, violent force that you-know-what occurs.\"&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n[Precipice] - \"The never-learning Zagreus then... carelessly fell off a precipice, or something, plunging him into the rapids of the Styx.\"&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n[Rather Good] - \"The Underworld Prince is getting rather good at this.

It greets him venomously back, using its fangs.\"&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n[Setbacks] - \"Having ventured successfully much farther than before, the surface-seeking Prince encounters setbacks far too hideous to be described.\"&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n[Shiver] - \"After defeating his lord father, yet again, Prince Zagreus begins to shiver, and catch cold. And, as is well known, there sadly is no cure for such a thing.\"&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n[Spears?] - \"Alas, the wisely-spoken Zagreus... stumbled upon a pit of deadly spears, perhaps?\"&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n[Spines] - \"Amid the wondrous ever-springing garden of Persephone, Prince Zagreus discovers a greenish plant of some sort, supple-skinned and covered all in spines, a bit too small to see, until it is too late...\"&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n[Splendid] - \"Having already seen the splendid cottage of Persephone sufficient times, the stubborn Underworld Prince nevertheless attempts to go there once again. Although, his memory of it shall have to do.\"&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n[Steam] - \"Just when his victory was all but certain, a fissure opens underneath the feet of the ill-fated Prince, and from it vents a cloud of superheated water-vapor; steam, as it is known! And probably you know what happens next.\"&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n[Sure...] - \"The favor-doing Zagreus then walks into a chamber, black as night, but with a blood-red pool, and from it comes a voice which says: Would you mind diving in these waters, Prince? To which the Prince replies, Oh! Sure.\"&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n[Tale] - \"One might suppose the Prince's tale most likely ends akin to other tales of the heroes of our time, like so:\"&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n[Telling] - \"...I have no new tales left to tell. But do not think that you have won, Prince Zagreus... for any tale worth telling... is a tale worth telling again, and again, and again. Bye-Bye!\"&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n[Tenacious] - \"Once more, tenacious Zagreus achieves his lofty goal, and just as every time before, except with some sort of new twist of Fate, perhaps, he goes a little distance, then dies.\"&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n[Tool] - \"As he explores the wonders of the world, Prince Zagreus discovers a quaint farm, in which he carelessly trespasses, stepping on a farming-tool, which swoops up and strikes him in the forehead, fatally.\"&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n[Transgress] - \"The hint-ignoring Prince again attempted to transgress, to no avail, into domains not yet prepared for his arrival.\"&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n[Unrelenting] - \"The unrelenting Underworld Prince again vainly attempted to proceed beyond the current limits of this tale.\"&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n[Variety] - \"Although there are innumerable ways for one to die, our danger-seeking Prince has come to know a sizable variety.\"&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n[Victory] - \"Reflecting on his victory, Prince Zagreus observes how death can take hold in so many different ways, at times quite slowly, and at other times--\"&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n[Waiting] - \"Upon the surface realm, the mortal-loving Prince would doubtless find that death still comes in a variety of different forms. One of the most common, yet perhaps least interesting, involves simply waiting... long... enough... until...\"&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n[Wall] - \"Just then, the carefree-running Underworld Prince runs headlong into a thick and deadly wall of stone, painted to look like the way out.\"&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n[Zagreus] - \"Thus, having once more gained the surface of his grim-faced father's realm beneath the earth, resourceful Zagreus makes his way toward the one-time abode of radiant Persephone. It is a journey of considerable distances, which he has already completed many times, and which has always ended in the same result. So... imagine he made it there with just time enough to water the crops and tidy up a bit before...\"&lt;br&gt;\nCerberus / 'Conversations' With Zagreus.\nCerberus resides in the House Of Hades and the Temple.

She serves as a sentry for &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads\"&gt;The Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; but will occasionally appear at the beginning of regular encounters and challenges Melino\u00eb to see which of them can slay more enemies in the Underworld path. In addition, she can enter chambers and block Melino\u00eb out of them and take items from &lt;a href=\"Charon%23Wares\"&gt;Charon's Shop&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacteristics and Personality.\nA fiery and tough-hearted goddess who strongly opposes &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;, acting as her rival. Nemesis inspires Melino\u00eb to always strive to be better.\nNemesis is hot-blooded, vulgar and tends to be brutally honest, her words are like barbs to Melino\u00eb. She is direct and to the point, proud and arrogant about her abilities. However, Nemesis is also cold, condescending, and resentful, Melino\u00eb remarks that one wouldn't expect such behavior from a goddess of retribution. Nevertheless, she is one of &lt;a href=\"Nyx\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;'s most loyal and obedient children, to her mother and her family.\nNemesis has a competitive streak and loves to prove herself and her skills, competing in a body count to see who can take down more monsters. She seems to take everything personally and turns everything into a competition. Occasionally, she acts impulsively and recklessly, putting herself in harm's way and behaving like an adrenaline-fueled fool. When Melino\u00eb enters a room, to test her, Nemesis will tell her to hit her as hard as she can or the other way around in exchange to reward Melino\u00eb.\nHer effort is admirable, particularly noticed by Melino\u00eb, who, although not openly admitting it to Nemesis, sees her as a role model. Though both train hard, Mel and Nem comment that Nemesis has always been the stronger, tougher, and braver of the two. This is why Nemesis is constantly frustrated at being relegated to a useless guard post, while a newcomer barely out of diapers is tasked with taking down a titan.\nAlthough she's very stubborn and acts like a full-time tsundere, Nemesis often speaks without thinking and later regrets it. Deep down, Nemesis is so rude to Melino\u00eb because it's evident that this is her way of dealing with the pain. She also misses the rest of her kidnapped family a lot and deeply blames herself for not being there, so her jealousy makes her take it out on Melino\u00eb, believing that as the goddess of retribution, it was her duty to be there to save them. In reality, she wants Melino\u00eb to give up to spare her. Other characters like &lt;a href=\"Moros\"&gt;Moros&lt;/a&gt; have noticed that over time, she will change her attitude towards Melino\u00eb and treat her better, striving to be better.\nPhysical description.\nNemesis is portrayed as a tall, stately woman with an emphasis on the muscles she gained from her training. She has long dark hair tied in a bun, two large wings with crimson tips around her head, and piercing golden eyes. Nemesis is similar in looks to her mother Nyx but appears more combat ready. Her silver armor is adorned with gold and red accents, with a shield on her left arm and her sword in the other. Her posture is straight and confident. She also wears large hoop earrings and red nail polish. \nHistory.\nBefore Hades.\nNyx gave birth to Nemesis at some point after the Fates, but before the twins &lt;a href=\"Hypnos\"&gt;Hypnos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;; the exact order of her middle children isn't specified. Unlike &lt;a href=\"Moros\"&gt;Moros&lt;/a&gt;, Nemesis was actually raised by Nyx, and mentions having a positive relationship with her mother. Some time after &lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt; discarded the &lt;a href=\"Stygian%20Blade\"&gt;Stygian Blade&lt;/a&gt; (which he presumably used against &lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;) it came into the possession of Nemesis. It is unknown how long she wielded it or how she was separated from it before the events of Hades.\nHades.\nAlthough she grew up in her mother's care, Nemesis is not seen in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hades\"&gt;House of Hades&lt;/a&gt;, and she does not indicate that she witnessed the events surrounding &lt;a href=\"Zagreus\"&gt;Zagreus&lt;/a&gt;' birth. This would suggest that she reached adolescence and left the nest before he was born. The Stygian Blade was housed with the other Infernal Arms in the courtyard at the House of Hades, which allowed Zagreus to wield it and utilize Nemesis' Aspect.\nBefore Hades II.\nAt some point, the Stygian Blade ended up back in her possession, taking on her associated Aspect. She avoided capture during Chronos' capture, presumably because she did not live in the House of Hades with her younger brothers and mother. As a child of Nyx, she is permitted to take refuge with &lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt; at The Crossroads. After Chronos' conquest, Hecate enlists Nemesis to protect The Crossroads and its residents, a task Nemesis feels is a waste of her talents.\nHades II.\nTBA\nGallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nIllustration=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

It's insane that she's sending you out on foot, all on your own.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Your skepticism's duly noted.\"\nReactions.\n&lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; Inspecting Nemesis.\n Narrator : \n\"\"The unhappy goddess of comeuppance casts her judging gaze on all within the Crossroads, which she safeguards out of duty, and of spite.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Don't want to get on Nem's bad side...\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Whatever.\"\nAbout Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01 (Lost Battle).\n Nemesis : \n\"They're saying you got all the way to Tartarus before. How far'd you get? Make it all the way back to your \"rightful home?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"If you're referring to the House of Hades, then yes, I did make it there. Though you could best describe it as the House of \"Chronos \"at this point. He was waiting within, just as expected, and... was strong, just as expected, too.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"\"Too \"strong, you mean. Well, can't fault you for trying. So what's the plan now, keep throwing yourself at him till you're totally demoralized? If that hasn't happened already?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"The task remains the same.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Fair enough!\"\nDialogue 02 (Lost Battle).\n Nemesis : \n\"Can't believe you got to Chronos before me. Knew you stood no chance against him, but... didn't think you'd get there at all anytime soon.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Is that supposed to be some sort of compliment? Or an apology, perhaps?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"No.\"\nDialogue 03 (Won Battle).\n Nemesis : \n\"Come here to gloat, I bet. \"I beat him! I beat the Titan! \"Well, hardly matters. He's still alive, you realize, don't you?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I wasn't coming here to gloat, and yes, I realize. But this is still a step. If I could vanquish Chronos once, I can do it again. And one of these nights... he's not going to come back.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Yeah. 'Cause one of these nights, I'll get my hands on him myself.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Then you can do the gloating, right?\"\nDialogue 04 (Battle).\n Nemesis : \n\"Ought to admit it when I'm wrong. Never thought you'd get to Chronos in the first place, before I did anyway. Much less beat him down, repeatedly. So \u2014 I was wrong. Sorry.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Nemesis, I want you to know it was astonishing to hear those words coming from you just now. It seems we're each more than capable of surprising the other. But mainly... thank you.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"No need. Fair is fair. Had my chances to catch up with you, but couldn't get through all the pitfalls in the way. Might be I could have taken Chronos, too. But now I'm not so sure.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Now don't lose heart! There's much left to be done, and we need all your strength and vigilance. We're the Unseen; together we prevail, or we fail.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Couldn't resist giving one of your pep talks, huh.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"...No.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Fates\"&gt;The Fates&lt;/a&gt;.\n Nemesis : \n\"They're not going to help you, you know. The Fates, I mean. They don't take pity on whoever asks. If anything, you'll make things even worse.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Maybe you just don't give your sisters enough credit. If they once aided my brother, then there has to be a chance they'll aid us. They have a stake in this, too.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"What, you mean their \"family? \"They couldn't care less. Too busy messing with everybody's lives, making it look like an accident.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You mustn't speak of them that way.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Odysseus\"&gt;Odysseus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Nemesis : \n\"Next time you got something to say about me, you come say it to my face. Know you witches would much rather sneak around, though.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"What are you even talking about? I think you're being accusatory and abrasive. There! I said \"that \"to your face.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Odysseus tried giving me one of his talks. Telling me you didn't go complaining to him?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"He was concerned with how we're getting on. You're not exactly being subtle, and he's quite perceptive in case you hadn't noticed.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Be. Quiet.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"So, just how much trouble are you in for mouthing off to Headmistress, Nem? That was utterly disrespectful, even for you.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"\"Heh! \"Well, looks like I've got a lot more guard duty ahead of me. But it was worth it. Help balance out you sucking up to her all the time.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It figures you have no ability to distinguish between basic courtesy, and what you call sucking up.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"You're just a tool to her, you know.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Was it always like this, between you and Headmistress? I used to think it was \"me \"you hated most of all.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"You've always been naive, Princess. As for Hecate, I liked her better before she decided this right here was the best use of my talents.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"She made that decision long ago. So you're going to resent her forever? Or are you going to do something about it?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"I \"am \"doing something about it! I'm honoring my vow to Mother Nyx. Else I'd be long gone, much to your disappointment, I'm sure.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I would be very disappointed, yes.\"\nDialogue 03 (Lost Battle).\n Nemesis : \n\"Wondered why Hecate took off all of a sudden. Was just to get in your way! Send you crying home. Guess she doesn't want you to succeed.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"She expects me to be prepared for whatever lies ahead.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"You're such a pushover sometimes.\"\nDialogue 04 (Won Battle).\n Nemesis : \n\"You passed her little test that time. Must have felt so good beating her ass to the ground. Don't get to spar with her, so I can only imagine.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"We're not just sparring. You don't know our craft.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"I know I could take her...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Moros\"&gt;Moros&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Nemesis : \n\"Can't believe sucking up to the Fates actually worked. That big scroll over there... that's really from them?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Personally delivered by Lord Moros, no less. He seemed a little pressed for time, so we didn't get to talk much. Are the two of you close?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"We're children of Nyx; none of us are close. But we crossed paths. When certain mortals get what they deserve, it involves us both.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I can only imagine.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Nemesis : \n\"Never thought I'd see Moros here of all places. But then again, it only makes sense Doom would come to the Crossroads sooner or later.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You make it sound like it's a bad thing. All Nyx's kin are welcome here. Headmistress gave her word.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Whatever. Guess I better go say hello...\"\nDialogue 03.\n Moros : \n\"Quite a predicament we find ourselves in, Sister. Certainly not one I could have anticipated when first I arrived. How odd... so what are we to do? It's not my wish to interfere.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Don't worry about that, worry about keeping your mouth shut when she's walking up on us. All casual like she doesn't know what's going on.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Wait, what \"is \"going on? What are you two talking about, if I may ask?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Talking about \"you\", Princess, though it's nothing you need to worry your \"pretty little head \"about. You've got enough going on, and... we can sort this out ourselves. If you'll excuse us?\"\n Moros : \n\"Wait. No, I would prefer to be forthright. Princess, the issue is we each developed certain feelings for you that, in some cases, can manifest as the kind of envy that Nemesis is committed to punishing. An outcome we are trying to avoid.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"Oh! \"I... I see. Thank you for letting me know. I would never want to hurt either of you. Well maybe \"you\", Nemesis, but only when we spar. How do we resolve this? Our feelings mustn't get in our way.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"They won't get in our way. And besides, you're busy, not like you were going to devote yourself to one of us, body and soul. Like some mortal that doesn't know any better.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Certainly not... why should I or any of us have to choose? We're gods. If you wish to know me better, wonderful. But please accept that I won't let myself be bound to anyone, nor would I expect any different from you. Are we clear?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"...Yeah.\"\n Moros : \n\"Yes, we are.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Ran into Artemis out there, at long last. Did she pass through and say hello at least?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"No, she didn't. So she's been skulking around in these woods? Thought she was busy rallying your aunts and uncles for you. Wait, you couldn't go the distance even with \"her \"help?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It's not that simple...!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Have you met Artemis out there? I suppose it may be worth repeatedly disobeying orders for the chance to see her.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"What would you know of it. You really think I'm sneaking out into those woods just to fool around?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Is everything all right between the two of you, at least?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"It's fine.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hypnos\"&gt;Hypnos&lt;/a&gt;.\n Nemesis : \n\"Been talking to Hypnos again? He can't hear you, you know. Kind of what happens when somebody's fast asleep.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Sleep is not as simple as you make it out to be. I think he can sense my words and intentions.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Sensing words and intentions, yeah... sounds exactly like the Hypnos I knew.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Strictly business between you and Lord Charon, isn't it? Never seen you speak except about his wares. At least you're providing him with Gold.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"You might technically have a brother, but you don't know what it's like having one around. Charon doesn't like to talk; I respect that.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Truly? He never seems to mind speaking with me, in his way.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Maybe it's 'cause you're \"special.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt;.\n Nemesis : \n\"So you've been chatting it up with Chaos, of all beings... trying to get the oldest force in the world to take sides? A fundamentally \"impartial \"force. Smart.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Sounds like you've been chatting it up yourself! I saw you plunge into a Chaos Gate, as though you knew exactly where it led. Not your first time?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Not your business. Just don't go thinking Chaos is going to help \"you \"and no one else. Seeing as that wouldn't be fair.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I suppose not.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Narcissus\"&gt;Narcissus&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Why all the rancor toward Narcissus, by the way? I see how he could be a little irritating, but he doesn't seem all that bad.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Should have seen what he did to this poor Nymph. Absolutely broke her heart. Didn't even notice, or care.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Didn't take you for the sentimental type. I thought you concerned yourself with worse than lovers' quarrels.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Narcissus cared only for himself, not for anyone around him. Had to make an example of him. He wound up madly in love. With his own reflection. Till the day he died.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"So now he's a Shade in the Underworld. And still staring longingly into his own eyes.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Hey, you're the witch, not me. You know how it is with curses.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"They're easily misused.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Hey, about Narcissus. I won't undo the curse you put on him, even if I could. He seems to be rather content, and besides... I can tell you truly believe he deserved it. Only problem is, that curse did nothing to aid Echo in her plight.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Echo... that was the Nymph who put Narcissus on my list of things to do. You're telling me getting divine retribution with no strings attached wasn't enough to put her mind at peace?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Correct. You evened the score between them, though you didn't set things right for either one. They had to set things right for themselves.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"With your help and encouragement, I guess? \"Eh\", same difference to me long as neither one ends up much better off. Sounds like you lectured both of them, so I'm sure it's close.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"So you don't care how they end up, as long as they're even.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"You're catching on.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Nemesis : \n\"Eris is back. What did you do? Did you summon her? I saw you talking.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You're not remotely pleased to see your sister again? I don't have any more control over her than you do. Headmistress still is giving her the silent treatment, though.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Ideally, Eris should be somewhere very far from here. Good thing this place is impossible to find, otherwise I'd half expect she would have led Chronos straight to us by now.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You truly think a daughter of Nyx would betray us? I know Eris is a different sort, but still.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Your father is a son of Chronos. How'd \"they \"get on?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"...That's fair.\"\nDialogue 02 (Battle).\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Eris stands against us. Just as I neared my destination on the surface, she was there. Let the Adamant Rail do much of the talking.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Imagine my surprise. So what to do? Can't kick her out, since \"all children of Nyx are welcome here\", whosever bright idea that was. Maybe give her some \"more \"second chances?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You've made your point.\"\nDialogue 03 (Battle).\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Isn't there something you can do to talk some sense into Eris? Get her out of my blasted way to Olympus. Or failing that, pin her in an arm bar or leg lock, perhaps?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Won't waste my time with her at all, though the arm bar or leg lock do have a certain appeal. Not seen her flying through the Underworld lately, have you.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Not other than these Crossroads. Though what's your point, that I should stay out of her way as well as focus solely on Chronos below? It's not so simple for me anymore.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Didn't say it was. But if you don't want to deal with \"Eris\", you could always stick to your main objective. Or just leave it to \"me\", like you should have in the first place.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Duly noted.\"\nDialogue 04 (Won Battle).\n Nemesis : \n\"Showed Eris didn't you. Could hear her crying practically from here. Been far too long since last I kicked her ass myself. At least \"somebody\"'s picked up the slack.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Perhaps all of those savage fights between you two contributed to her disagreeable nature. Or yours, for that matter. Unless you're certain neither one of you has changed a bit, in which case, what was all the fighting even for?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"You've met her. She always liked picking fights. And you've met \"me. \"I've never liked backing down from them. As for you, go learn to take a compliment next time.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"...I must have missed it.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Sure did.\"\nWith Other Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Odysseus\"&gt;Odysseus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Odysseus : \n\"...I'm saying that the possibility exists, yes. Eternal vigilance is near impossible. Enemies have always exploited the lack thereof. I ever tell you of the old wooden horse trick?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"The old wooden horse trick, yeah. Surely your reputation as the Great Tactician hinges on more than this one tale?\"\n Odysseus : \n\"\"Ah\", but classics ought to be retold! Though, if you'd rather, I have far more tales of trickery and valor. Take the Cave of the Cyclops!\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Not Cave of the Cyclops...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hypnos\"&gt;Hypnos&lt;/a&gt;.\n Nemesis : \n\"Look at him, all peaceful. Not a care in the world. Could you imagine?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"He's beautiful. He has this wisdom about him, even asleep. Nyx must have taught you all so much.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Not really. Hypnos served in the House of Hades under Mother's care. Ran into him now and then, though. He ever wakes up, hope I can be there when you finally meet.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Thank you, Nem...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt;.\n Hecate : \n\"You are required at your post, Nemesis. Or shall you take to openly defying me just as your sister does? I shudder to think what your mother would say of you two.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"...You have no right to invoke my mother. None of this would be happening had you fulfilled your role as Handmaiden, and warned her an attack was imminent.\"\n Hecate : \n\"Best watch your mouth or I shall seal it shut! You may continue dwelling on a past you were not witness to, or you may do what is expected of Nyx's daughters. Or whatever Eris is up to! Your choice.\"\n Nemesis : \n&lt;a href=\"Moros\"&gt;Moros&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Nemesis : \n\"...And there she is! Shouldn't you be halfway down to Tartarus by now?\"\n Moros : \n\"Princess. Thank the Fates you're well. Nemesis and I, we were just catching up. She's told me a lot about you.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Oh, great. I can imagine! Though, you never told me about your brother, Nemesis...\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Got a lot of brothers. What's to tell? Never a good sign when he shows up.\"\n Moros : \n\"I'm afraid she's right.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Nemesis : \n\"...It's my job, Moros. Simple as that. No one else wants to do it. No one else \"can \"do it.\"\n Moros : \n\"But the retribution you see fit to dole out... how can you be so certain that decisions about such consequences are yours alone? \"The Fates \"have quite a bit of say in it as well.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"What, you think I'm just another mindless puppet our sisters are pushing around? Come on! Their prophecies are vague because they don't really know what's coming.\"\n Moros : \n\"Even if that were true, the burden of choosing who deserves what... I wouldn't want to bear it on my own. Otherwise my judgment would have to be perfect at all times; yet we are fallible beings.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Speak for yourself.\"\n Moros : \n\"I was...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Nemesis : \n\"...No, one last thing, Eris. The Headmistress might have promised Mother she'd look after you, but I did no such thing. So get out of here before I get upset.\"\n Eris : \n\"Oh please, Nemmie, you're already upset! And I'll come and go as I like, thanks. So damn boring here I can't stand it for long anyways.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"\"Come and go as you like? \"You're jeopardizing the task. Don't be such a child.\"\n Eris : \n\"\"Don't be such a child. \"Waitwaitwait... does that make you my \"mom? \"I never answered to Nyx. Think I'm about to start with \"you?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"You'll get what's coming to you either way.\"\n Eris : \n\"\"Ooh! \"A threat!\"\nDialogue 02.\n Eris : \n\"\"...Yeah? \"And just what do you think you're gonna do about it, there, Nemmie? Can't just have it out with me in the middle of your little \"Crossroads.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Can't do anything about it \"here. \"But might run into you out there, snooping around. And then you won't get any special treatment. Just another target.\"\n Eris : \n\"\"Heh! \"Nemesis, how could you be so cruel? You're my \"sister! \"We don't have to \"fight! \"And besides, what makes you think you'd ever \"catch \"me? You're too \"slow.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"We'll see.\"\n Eris : \n\"\"You'll \"see.\"\nMiscellaneous Conversations.\nAbout Mission.\nDialogue 01.\n Nemesis : \n\"We're getting nowhere. I should be out there fighting! Not standing watch over a place nobody comes to uninvited. Damn it...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I think the circumstances justify heightened security around here. But if you don't, go take it up with the Headmistress, not me.\"\n Nemesis : \nDialogue 02.\n Nemesis : \n\"You don't deserve this. Any of this. It's unfair. But you're stuck with it. So the only question is, what are you going to do about it now?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"There's no such question in my mind. And what do you even know about fairness, or who deserves what?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"\"Hah! \"You almost had me going there.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Nemesis : \n\"Don't worry, you didn't miss much while you were out. Lot of standing around, chanting prayers for your victory and protection. How'd those work out for you, by the way?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Fine, thanks. And your own lack of support is a more significant motivator than you realize.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"You know all about lack of support...\"\nDialogue 04.\n Nemesis : \n\"How many attempts was that now? Good thing our Titan friend's too busy with your topside relatives to pay you much attention.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Sorry, not been keeping count. I'll get there when I get there. Though surely \"you \"would have vanquished the Titan Lord on your very first go?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Guess we'll never know, will we?\"\nAbout The &lt;a href=\"Fated%20List%20of%20Minor%20Prophecies\"&gt;Fated List of Minor Prophecies&lt;/a&gt;.\n Nemesis : \n\"Let me guess. The Fates have nothing but a bunch of busywork laid out for you. No grand revelations, just odd jobs.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I know better than to question their designs. A minor prophecy fulfilled may result in a greater one coming to pass.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Just keep telling yourself that.\"\nAbout Training.\n Nemesis : \n\"I always thought... if I could just train harder than you, she'd reconsider. And give the task to me. Worked my ass off. But it didn't matter.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I worked, too. And Headmistress always made herself clear about our roles. You can't change your birthright, nor can I change mine.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"It isn't fair...\"\nAbout Waiting.\n Nemesis : \n\"The hell are you doing talking to me, you get your scrawny ass back out there and get that Titan! What are you waiting for?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Rude!\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"https%3A//hades.fandom.com/wiki/Chronos/Quotes%23Hades_Flashback_in_Tartarus%3A~%3Atext%3DHades%2520Flashback%2520in%2520Tartarus\"&gt;Chronos Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Had one of my dreams, Nem. Your mother was there, and my father. He showed concern for her, she... was under the Titan's spell.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Mother Nyx made a mistake entrusting Hades with so much of the Underworld. This realm was never his by right, not till the Fates decided otherwise. Mother worked hard. They were probably just trying to send her help.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You're saying the Fates granted my father authority over the realm of the dead just to give Nyx a hand with all her responsibilities?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"That's right.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Huh.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Nemesis, about the dream I had... Chronos, he... demanded that my father tell him where the Fates reside.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Smart. Mother Nyx never would have told him. The Fates may be my sisters but even I have no idea where they are. Long as they're hidden, no one can mess with their designs.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You don't sound especially concerned that Chronos apparently found the three weavers of destiny and may be forcing their plans for the future.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"\"Really? \"I ever give you the impression I had any hope this would end well?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"How could he have found them? Wouldn't the Fates see the threat coming?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"They're always weaving. That means even they know only so much in advance. Chronos is Time. \"Time \"moves faster than expected.\"\nAbout Family.\nDialogue 01.\n Nemesis : \n\"Another failed attempt. About ready to give in? You don't have the fire. This isn't personal enough for you.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Isn't \"personal? \"You don't see my mother around, either, do you, Nem? Nor my father, nor my brother. Chronos took them all!\"\n Nemesis : \n\"I lost more than my mother, too. And I \"knew \"mine. What's yours to \"you? \"All you ever did was fall out of her womb.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Silence.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"What you said to me before, about my mother. That was very cruel.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"\"Hm\". Fair enough. Can't kill each other here, but we can use our words. If we were fighting for real I wouldn't have held back, either.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I figured not.\"\nAbout Weapons.\n Nemesis : \n\"Even Mother Nyx's weapons favor you. Always thought the Nocturnal Arms would wake for me first. Guess the Fates had other ideas.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I think the Fates had you covered. You're the bearer of Stygius! Vanquisher of heroes, gods, and Titans.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Seems it was due for a long break.\"\nAbout Golden Age.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Nem. You care so much for mortal justice. Where's your passion for ours? Chronos took \"everything \"from us! You said we all should get what we deserve, right?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"\"Khh. \"Well, that's the thing. If you knew anything about mortals, they had it better once. When Chronos ruled. Called it the \"Golden Age.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"How splendid that must have been for them! If only Chronos could have been so generous with his sons and foster-children. You think him being somewhat nice to some mortals makes up for what he did?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"No. Look. What if... what if this \"is \"what we deserve?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"We deserve better than this, Nemesis. Living in shadows. Denied our families. Don't you want justice for \"them?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"\"Hah.\"\n\"Melinoe\"\n\"Fine.\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"Cauldron\"&gt;Cauldron&lt;/a&gt;.\n Nemesis : \n\"Been hunched over that cauldron so much, least your craft is finally doing something around here. So much toiling with no results...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Our craft is typically about the self, and such results tend not to be immediate. Though, I appreciate you noticing.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Yeah, well...\"\nAbout &lt;a href=\"The%20Crossroads/Training%20Grounds\"&gt;Training Grounds&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Why don't I ever see you in the training grounds anymore? You used to let all your aggression out over there, but now it's like you're saving it for \"me.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Don't flatter yourself. Saving it for \"Chronos. \"And the training grounds increasingly are custom-fit for \"you\", in case you haven't noticed. From that Altar, to the weapons display.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'm the only one who uses it...\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Need my space.\"\nAbout Evil.\nDialogue 01.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Nemesis, for all the time you used to spend on the surface... surely there was something there that made it worth your while?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Oh, \"there was. \"Mortals like to reach beyond their means, thinking they're just like us. I'd sniff them out, and put them back in their place.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Put them back in their place... by punishing them in some inventive fashion, I suppose?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"That's right. We all should get what we deserve, no more, no less.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"But don't mortals already have ways to ensure justice is served, like my father did?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"\"Hah! \"Sure they do.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Hey. You miss being up there, don't you? Among the mortals and all that.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"You know, mortals have a word for deliberate cruelty or callous negligence: They call it evil. I could always catch wind of it. I'd go to the source. And whoever it was, I'd make them pay.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"But now you're stuck here, and the evil goes unchecked...\"\n Nemesis : \n\"A lot of it, I'm sure.\"\nDialogue 01.\n Nemesis : \n\"That Nectar you've been passing around? Don't see why you bother. Not everybody deserves it, anyhow.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"\"Deserves? \"And I suppose you think you're fit to be the judge of that?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Yes. Who do you think I am? If everybody just magically got what they deserved, I'd have no reason to exist.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"That's awful...\"\n Nemesis : \n\"That's life.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable, with the Nectar from before. It's just, I've always looked up to you, and... I'm doing the best I can.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Don't sweat it. Had myself a little drink the other day, and it didn't poison me as far as I know, so we're clear.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Want any more?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Eh...\"\nAbout Nemesis' Runs.\nDialogue 01.\n Nemesis : \n\"Back on your feet again there, Princess? All's well in the Crossroads, nothing to report.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It's fortunate we have you vigilantly keeping watch here, Nemesis...! Oh come on, drop the act. What happened, when did you return?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Don't know what you're talking about, and it's not your business anyway. Fates help you on your \"task.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Not quite as easy as you imagined, is it? To think that the embodiment of Retribution could be so arrogant.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Shut up.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Does Headmistress know yet of your little excursions? Not much escapes her notice, last I checked.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Strongly advise you mind your own responsibilities. Hecate doesn't control me, and \"you \"should show a little gratitude.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"For what, endangering us all? I didn't ask for your assistance, Nemesis.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Because you're weak.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"The first few times I saw you out there, I figured you were just venting your anger. But you keep heading out night after night. You're determined, but you're going to get caught.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Not if no one says anything. Besides, Hecate likely already knows. She isn't dense. Just letting me learn whatever she thinks I stand to learn the hard way. Works out for both of us.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Fine. We're both learning a lot I think. But I don't intend to let up on any of my responsibilities, just because you're trying to achieve what I've been tasked to do.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Somebody's got to do it.\"\nAbout Combat Failure.\n Nemesis : \n\"Got careless. All because of a little wager. You want to show me up that bad?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I could ask you the same thing. What are you doing back already? You couldn't have gone much farther.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Yeah. I got careless, too...\"\nFirst Meeting.\nDialogue 01.\n Nemesis : \n\"Missed all the fun. But least you won't have to get your hands dirty this time.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Nemesis, what are you doing here? Who's standing watch at the Crossroads?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"They'll manage, I'm on break. Tell Hecate you saw me, you'll regret it. And, \"you're welcome here and safe\", seeing as I cleared the path for you.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I don't need your aid in this, other than the responsibilities you've already been assigned.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Really? Look like you could use all the \"aid \"you can get. Here's something for your trouble, then I suggest you move along.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Nemesis : \n\"You're late. Already took care of things here, though you'll still get your share, I'm sure.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"If you insist on trying to hunt Chronos down, why don't we work at it together, at least?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Can't be seen with you, and don't need your help, besides. But I get you need mine, so here. Take this, and you never saw me. Got it?\"\nDialogue 03 (&lt;a href=\"Echo\"&gt;Echo&lt;/a&gt;'s Chamber).\n Nemesis : \n\"Expecting someone else? Taking a moment to get my bearings. Was nice and quiet here till you showed up.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You haven't seen a gentle-looking Nymph nearby, have you? She's often here on this bridge.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Might be I scared her off. Got more important things to do than chasing Nymphs. Anyway, go on. The spirits in this place won't like us making nice.\"\nDialogue 04 (Buying &lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;'s Wares (Any)).\n Nemesis : \n\"Always used to be Gold in the Underworld, right in its veins. But Chronos turned it into little coins! All over the damn place now.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Lord Charon's going to take care of it, soon enough. I give him all the Gold I find. Trade for his wares.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Think I can do the same, if you want to make a deal. Don't worry, any Gold I get from you, Charon gets from me.\"\nDialogue 05 (Buying &lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;'s Wares (&lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Mourning\"&gt;Fields of Mourning&lt;/a&gt;)).\n Nemesis : \n\"Well, look who! Also lost here in these Fields I guess? Trade you a map or something if I had one, but you wouldn't have been able to afford it, so I'd use it to get out of here myself.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I doubt a map would be of any use, as these pathways seem to shift from night to night. I've been able to make use of the Golden Boughs scattered about at least. What about you?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"The Golden Boughs. Had no idea those did anything but look all sad. Guess I should have paid better attention when the Headmistress was droning on and on over that Cauldron.\"\nDialogue 05 (Trading Item for Damage).\n Nemesis : \n\"These wretches were nothing. Back when we used to spar... almost never got a clean hit in on you. You'd always slip out of the way.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"What choice did I have? One clean hit from you was more than I could take back then. But I've been practicing!\"\n Nemesis : \n\"You're tougher, yeah. Though by how much? How about I hit you right now, and if you can take it, you'll get this nice reward I found. Deal?\"\nDialogue 06 (Combat.\n Nemesis : \n\"One word of this to Hecate, and you're meat, got it? Now go on while I take care of things.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"This is my task, not yours. And I'm disappointed with your dereliction of duty. Are you so desperate to prove you're superior to me?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"You know, maybe I am. So how about this: Got some Gold on you, right? Those wretches ought to swarm in any moment. Whoever takes more of them gets the other's coin. What do you say?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Must it always be a wager with you?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Fair odds of winning if you shut up and fight!\"\nKeepsake Dialogue (&lt;a href=\"Evil%20Eye\"&gt;Evil Eye&lt;/a&gt;).\n Nemesis : \n\"\"Aw\", you brought the Evil Eye I gave to you, how sweet. Make your enemies regret messing with you.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'm certain our foes will get what's coming. This Eye, though; it almost looks alive. Not using it to spy on me, are you?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Nah. See enough of you as it is. Now get out of here before that Eye does anything to me.\"\nAbout Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You must have thought you would have taken Chronos down by now. Have you even seen him? Gotten anywhere near my father's House?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Keep hitting snags along the way. The pathways down to Tartarus have changed a lot. Especially once you get to the Fields.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I have a sense for where we need to go. I'd suggest we proceed together had Headmistress not strictly forbidden it.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Not happening, no matter what she says. Doing this alone. Better odds that way anyway.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Across the Fields of Mourning, where the path descends to Tartarus... the monstrous creature there... do you know what it is?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"It's a problem. Can't always find my way to it, and even when I do, that thing forces me back. But don't worry; got my eye on it.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Scylla\"&gt;Scylla&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Have you been able to get past Scylla and her Siren friends? Just once I'd like to pass through and not have to hear their song...\"\n Nemesis : \n\"They know better than to mess with me. Wait, you've been \"fighting \"them? How'd you make enemies with a musical act?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I... can't entirely be sure. But they've been very hostile to me.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Can't imagine why.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Say, how do you get past Headmistress on your way down? She's always waiting for me at the edge of Erebus.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Just answered your own question. She's waiting for \"you\", not me. I'm not the one still being tested and trained. And I'm good at avoiding her.\"\nWith Other Characters.\n&lt;a href=\"Narcissus\"&gt;Narcissus&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue 01.\n Nemesis : \n\"...Look at me when I'm talking to you, you louse. Oh, right. You can't. Must be so sick of staring at yourself by now.\"\n Narcissus : \n\"The only thing I'm sick of, \"I-Forget-Your-Name\", is you tramping about, disturbing my peace! If you don't have anything nice to say, why don't you \"go?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Still indignant after all this time. Had you learned to show respect, you might not be stuck forever in the company of a buffoon. Well, drink it in.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Nemesis?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Nemesis : \n\"...Tell me again I'm playing \"hard-to-get\", and so help me, I will pluck your limbs from you one at a time like they're the petals of an \"itty bitty flower. \"How's that sound?\"\n Narcissus : \n\"Sounds \"bad\", that's how! But also like something somebody playing hard-to-get would say. So I don't know! Now why don't you... \"tell me some more about yourself?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Wait, you want me to \"stay. \"Something's come over you, all right. Well, clear enough that my work here is done. Know what's good for you, then don't go breaking any other hearts.\"\n Narcissus : \n\"Oh \"yeah. \"She wants you, man. That much is \"very \"clear!\"\n Narcissus : \n\"Speaking of which...\"\nAbouth the Scenery.\n&lt;a href=\"Oceanus\"&gt;Oceanus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"All of this water must be quite a nuisance in your suit. Not found another pathway down, have you?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Only other path is through Elysium, and that's not happening for you or me. What better way for Chronos to show he's in charge than to seal off the Underworld for good?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Good thing he missed a spot. Although he realizes now that we're using this path. That I am using it, at least.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Thanks for the tip! No wonder the fish are biting. Anyway, I'm off. This suit isn't supposed to rust, but just in case.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Tartarus/Hades%20II\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt;.\n Nemesis : \n\"Tell me something, and don't you dare mock me or you'll regret it: How do I... get into Tartarus. Managed to make it through the Fields, then hit a dead end. Kept hitting it.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Tartarus is sealed off. The only reason I'm able to get in is because not even Chronos can take away my birthright and divine authority over the place. Although if not for Headmistress, I wouldn't have known how to use it.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"No help at all, forget I even asked. Got to be some other way inside, and if not, just have to make one I guess. For now, enjoy the lack of competition while you can.\"\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Surface\"&gt;The Surface&lt;/a&gt;.\n Nemesis : \n\"First wager in a while. Been busy up top, breathing surface air? Thought maybe you came to your senses and left things to me.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Oh, I'm not finished here by any means. And evidently neither are you. Still at it like before? Quite difficult, I know.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Oh, shut up.\"\nMiscellaneous Conversations.\nDamage Trade Dialogue.\nDialogue 01 (Seein &lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; Often).\n Nemesis : \n\"You following me or something? Not used to running into you this many times per night. Find your own path.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Find my \"own \"path? You mean \"besides \"the one our Headmistress and Master Tactician endlessly toiled to refine to maximize my chances of success?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Just stay out of my way. But first, how about you let me take a good clean swing at you, since you've been mouthing off?\"\nDialogue 02.\n Nemesis : \n\"\"Urgh\", got to hit something sometimes. You know how it is. Could make it worth your while...\"\nDialogue 03.\n Nemesis : \n\"Blood's boiling still... got to get it out of my system. Just one clean hit, that's all.\"\nDialogue 04.\n Nemesis : \n\"Spilled some blood getting my hands on this. Spill some of yours if you want it.\"\nDialogue 05.\n Nemesis : \n\"You're tough. Can take a hit, can't you. Worth it for both of us...\"\nDialogue 06.\n Nemesis : \n\"You'd have taken more than one hit getting through this mess...\"\nDialogue 07.\n Nemesis : \n\"Took a hard hit getting here, how about you take one too.\"\nDialogue 08.\n Nemesis : \n\"Want something from me, you'll pay with blood.\"\nDialogue 09.\n Nemesis : \n\"Want to see this through, better be ready to bleed.\"\nDialogue 10.\n Nemesis : \n\"Doubt you could even handle just a single hit from me.\"\nDialogue 11.\n Nemesis : \n\"Thinking if you can't take a hit from me, you don't have a chance.\"\nBoon Trade Dialogue.\nDialogue 01.\n Nemesis : \n\"Sometimes I get a little boost from Artemis, but \"you? \"Just about all Olympus backs you up, and \"even still\", it's not enough. Some help \"they \"are.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Direct your criticism to the gods themselves. Now what is it you want with me?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Want a little taste of all that power for myself. Come on, I'll trade you...\"\nDialogue 02.\n Nemesis : \n\"All these hand-outs from your relatives... surely you don't need them \"all?\"\nDialogue 03.\n Nemesis : \n\"Blood's boiling still... got to get it out of my system. Just one clean hit, that's all.\"\nDialogue 04.\n Nemesis : \n\"Got something here you need, but it'll cost you some of your false power from Olympus.\"\nDialogue 05.\n Nemesis : \n\"Give me some of your borrowed strength, and you'll get some of mine.\"\nDialogue 06.\n Nemesis : \n\"Don't need Olympus handing everything to you.\"\nDialogue 07.\n Nemesis : \n\"Want what I've got, got to give something up.\"\nDialogue 08.\n Nemesis : \n\"Don't have Olympus helping me, only fair neither should you.\"\nDialogue 09.\n Nemesis : \n\"The mountain gods don't offer \"me \"their aid, though what about you?\"\nDialogue 10.\n Nemesis : \n\"Olympus isn't gonna care if you give up one little blessing, will they?\"\nDialogue 11.\n Nemesis : \n\"What would it take for you to give up some of your Olympian muscle?\"\nDialogue 12.\n Nemesis : \n\"Always depending on your relatives for help. How about you give it up.\"\nDamage Contest Dialogue.\nDialogue 01.\n Nemesis : \n\"Got here well before you did. Cleaned up, too. Makes you mad, I know. Don't hold back... let's see how strong you really are.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I don't want to fight you, Nemesis. I don't even want to speak with you right now.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Not asking you to fight me. Asking you to \"hit \"me. See if you can even make me budge. It'll be worth your while.\"\nDialogue 02.\n Nemesis : \n\"All that pent-up anger. Let it out, then. I feel anything, I'll make it worth your while.\"\nDialogue 03.\n Nemesis : \n\"Wretches couldn't even hit me. Wasn't fair. How about you make it up to them.\"\nDialogue 04.\n Nemesis : \n\"Look at you acting tough. Go on, hit me hard as you can. Free shot.\"\nDialogue 05.\n Nemesis : \n\"Let's see how strong you really are. Hit me, and don't hold back.\"\nDialogue 06.\n Nemesis : \n\"Can tell you're angry. Then let it out and show me what you're made of.\"\nDialogue 07.\n Nemesis : \n\"Look at you, all tough and fierce. Show me how strong you really are.\"\nDialogue 08.\n Nemesis : \n\"To the victor go the spoils. So come show me what you've got.\"\nDialogue 09.\n Nemesis : \n\"None of these wretches could touch me. But you're stronger than them, right?\"\nDialogue 10.\n Nemesis : \n\"Don't think you have what it takes, though go on and try to prove me wrong.\"\nDialogue 11.\n Nemesis : \n\"Getting stronger, but you'll never be at my level. Go on, try me.\"\nAbout Combat.\n Nemesis : \n\"Surprised you didn't bail out with that return trick of yours.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You don't know anything about me. What are you thinking, being this far from your post, in violation of Headmistress Hecate's direct orders?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"I'm \"thinking \"you don't have what it takes to take the Titan down. \"I \"do. Now, get out of here.\"\nAbout Progress.\n Nemesis : \n\"Thought for sure when first you saw me out here, you'd go telling Hecate soon as you could. But you didn't.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"It's fortunate for you Headmistress doesn't ask me to make reports. You're probably drawing some of our enemy's attention off of me, at least.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Very least I could do. Wasn't going to back down no matter what you did, but \"this \"way... can stay focused. On the task at hand.\"\nAbout Armor.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Doesn't all that heavy armor slow you down? Can't be too comfortable, especially around the waist.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Can't be too comfortable is right. Besides, not everybody wants to run half-naked into battle.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You really ought to try running half-naked into battle. You might like it!\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Rather be invulnerable, thanks.\"\nAbout Losing Wager.\n Nemesis : \n\"\"Damn \"it! How many times you going to take my Gold? Rules of this wager might be too much in your favor after all.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You set the rules of this wager yourself. You'd never go easy on me, would you, Nem? Though you can't bring yourself to make things overly unfair for me, either.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Beginning to think it might be a weakness of mine. Well, go buy yourself something nice, Princess. Don't need to hear more metal clinking around every step I take anyway.\"\nAbout Failure.\n Nemesis : \n\"Quit stalling.

Why don't you take your bottle before I smash it, and get your scrawny ass out of here.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I wasn't trying to get you in trouble, Nem, I was just... \"ungh\". You know what, forget it.\"\n3rd Time.\n Nemesis : \n\"Oh, for me? Can't find another way to test one of your poisons, I guess. You witches aren't as subtle as you think.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"That's exactly what someone who was unknowingly poisoned by a witch might say, you know.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"\"Ugh.\"\n4th Time.\n Nemesis : \n\"Oh no, not this again. Look, I forgave you for last time. Didn't mean it as an invitation to get me more of this stuff. Don't like owing anybody any favors.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Just take it and enjoy it, Nem. Besides, I heard you were looking for some more of our witches' poison. Nobody seems to appreciate it quite like you.\"\n5th Time.\n Nemesis : \n\"Why do you keep doing this? You won, OK? You beat me. Before you even started. Last thing I need now is your sympathy.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Nemesis... I don't know what I'm supposed to do. We're surrounded by enemies out there. Do we really need more?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"...You're not my enemy, Melino\u00eb. I just... Just go.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Bye, Nem...\"\nGift Decline.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Here, Nemesis! To your willful disobedience. May those instincts of yours never lead you astray.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Really think this is the perfect time for us to just kick back and have a few laughs over a nice bottle?

I've an extra-special poison bottle here, and thought maybe we could split it at the taverna, you and I?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"So damn polite! Well, it's less excessive if we split the bottle, I guess... \"ungh\", you know what? Whatever, sure.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"...Come on, say it: Got your ass kicked. By me. Think that was when I first thought I had a chance. That Hecate would pick me. If I could take you just like that a few more times.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"You're a monster, Nem! I practically started to fear having to spar with you. But, the best way to get stronger is to train against a stronger opponent.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Maybe that's why I've been stagnating. We don't get to fight like we used to. Makes me sick even thinking about it.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Wait... you stand around thinking about how we used to spar? Should I be flattered or afraid?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Finish your half of the damn poison already! Don't have all night to sit around and stroke your ego. I swear, mortals take after our worst qualities.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I wasn't being serious. Though, maybe I'm more self-centered than I realize. I \"am \"part-mortal on my mother's side...\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Makes you different, I will give you that. Now come on, I got to get back. Else Hecate might catch us making nice and then neither one of us will hear the end of it.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"...Can feel the poison starting to kick in.

Over at the Springs.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"\"Hm. \"Come to think, could really use a bath. \"You\", I mean. But I could too, I guess, so... why not.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"How long has it been since you last took off the armor?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"A while. Not been much incentive. You saw how much of a pain it is to undo the lacing, and the straps. Feels strange without, like I'm... I... I don't know.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"...Unburdened? Or more comfortable at least?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"\"Heh. \"Good letting off some steam sometimes, I guess. But there's a fine line between rest and complacency.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I don't know that we're at risk of becoming complacent here, Nem.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"The risk is greater than you think. We're lounging in a bath while who-knows-what is going on out there...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"We're not lounging. We'll be better equipped to deal with the who-knows-what out there if our muscles aren't all knotted up.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"All right, got to get back to work. Though, this suit does feel a little lighter now...\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Take care, Nem.\"\n2nd Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Hey Nem, are you available to make another visit to the springs? Take a load off, come back to our senses a bit...\"\n Nemesis : \n\"\"Eh. \"Shoulder's been acting up again, could be it helps with that. Don't like having to take the suit off, but that's the trade.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"First time you beat me in a fight? \"Sparring match\", whatever. Got me right in the back of the neck. Took advantage of our height difference. Was a surprise.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'd lost to you so often, at some point I figured I could lull you into overconfidence. That even you could be susceptible to such a thing.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"You weren't wrong. Made me so \"angry. \"Swore I'd never underestimate my opponent again. Then proceeded to convince myself you'd never beat me at the task. \"Our \"task.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"So you've a bit of pride. You're not trying to stamp it out completely, right? Just keep it in check. Besides, I'd like to think we're not at odds in what we're trying to achieve.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"We're not. But I can only push myself so hard. Seeing you getting stronger, getting closer... gives me the extra push I need.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I'd no idea. I always thought I got my competitive spirit from \"you. \"Anyway... do let me know if you need anything else. Such as lending a hand putting on that suit of yours.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Or taking it off, yeah. Though, can't let myself become too used to this.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Well, enough sitting around. Time for some standing around to balance it out.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Off we go, then.\"\nGift Decline.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Hey, \"erm\", I suspect I know the answer, though I don't suppose you want to pay a visit to the springs? Clear our heads?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Oh, \"uh... \"Appreciate the invite, but I'm on guard duty right now, probably until Time claims us all. And this suit takes forever to get on or off...\"\n&lt;a href=\"Twin%20Lures\"&gt;Twin Lures&lt;/a&gt;.\n1st Time.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"I thought I saw some movement by the fishing pier. A thorough investigation is probably in order, right?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Either that or rot here standing guard, right? Know what, fine, I'll bite. Doubt anything else will.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"To have been born a fish. A life spent mucking about in the River of Lamentation, only to be plucked out by \"you. \"What did they do to deserve this?\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Shouldn't you be the one to know the answer to that? Perhaps it's the will of the Fates that determines how we're born. Then you ensure we get our dues based on the choices that we make.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Be a lot easier if everyone was born on equal footing. But no one in my family thinks life's meant to be fair, other than me.\"\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"How can life possibly be fair, knowing there are creatures of all sorts, such as those dwelling in these waters?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"We'd have to put a bit more structure into who decides how mortals are born. Or how their souls come back to life. Topic for a different time. Think I saw a bit of movement over there.\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Gave them a fair shot, didn't we. Real battle of wits back there.\"\nGift Decline.\n Melino\u00eb : \n\"Say, would you accompany me to the riverbank a bit? Blow off some steam, or... maybe I could push you in or something?\"\n Nemesis : \n\"Could be going after perpetrators of unspeakable evil across the surface, but you're asking me to go after some poor fish? Uh, no.\""}

They have worked with one another in the past to complete certain missions, particularly those where certain retribution meant impeding doom for the offender. In the present, they appear to be cordial with one another, with Nemesis saying she has to greet his arrival to the Crossroads when she sees him. They disagree on the degree of influence the Fates should and have on people's lives; Nemesis believes their influence is limited. This disagreement apparently does not impact the quality of their relationship.\nEris.\n&lt;a href=\"Eris\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt;: Nemesis' younger sister.&lt;br&gt;Nemesis finds her youngest sister a brat; she tends to be irritating, always nagging Nemesis. It seems that Nemesis is Eris's favorite older sibling, though their relationship is tense. Unlike Hecate, Nemesis claims she never promised Nyx that she would take care of Eris. Consequently, she feels compelled to threaten violence towards Eris if she perceives her as jeopardizing the mission to resist Chronos. Eris, in turn, refers to Nemesis as \"Nemmie\" and is generally disrespectful towards her threats and person.\nIn the past, Eris was known to provoke fights with Nemesis, who, never one to back down, ended up physically confronting Eris. Nemesis mentions the promise to care for Eris but ultimately abandons her, possibly suggesting that Eris's ironic reference to Nemesis as a goddess of justice is justified, given Nemesis's unjust treatment towards her.\nFates.\n&lt;a href=\"Fates\"&gt;Fates&lt;/a&gt;: Nemesis' sisters.&lt;br&gt;She disagrees with them; Nemesis, in her view, fails to recognize the affection of her sisters, perceiving them as indifferent to family matters and only interested in meddling in others' lives, playing with them as entertainment, and seemingly making it appear that everything was a coincidence.\nShe has doubts about her sisters' vision of the future and resents the idea of being treated as a mere pawn in their schemes, similar to Moros.\nPerhaps Nemesis, as the goddess of retribution and justice, does not see interfering with others' destinies as fair.\nHypnos.\n&lt;a href=\"Hypnos\"&gt;Hypnos&lt;/a&gt;: Nemesis' brother.&lt;br&gt;She seems to think that Hypnos is overly dependent on Nyx, mentioning how he worked at the House of Hades for so long just to be with her.\nAfter Melino\u00eb remarks that Hypnos \"seems wise,\" Nemesis falls silent and only says she \"can't wait for Hypnos to wake up and for Melino\u00eb to meet him,\" indicating she knows the clown well and wants Melino\u00eb to meet him in person to become disillusioned.\nWhile looking at her brother in a deep coma, Nemesis admires Hypnos and is at peace without a worry in the world, indicating she's tranquil because Hypnos appears to be in safety and fine.\nNemesis apparently seems different from Charon, who always disciplines him, showing she might find him amusing. And the fact that she's standing in front of her brother before Melino\u00eb arrives could indicate she's really waiting for Hypnos to wake up.\n&lt;a href=\"Thanatos\"&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;: Nemesis'brother.&lt;br&gt;Nemesis remains resistant, but in a conversation with Melino\u00eb about his kidnapped relatives, Nemesis confesses to missing her brother.\nCharon.\n&lt;a href=\"Charon\"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;: Nemesis' brother.&lt;br&gt;As children of Nyx, Nemesis and Charon don't talk much, although lately there have been more interactions due to Melino\u00eb. Nemesis confides in Melino\u00eb that she knows nothing about having siblings and getting along with them, and since Charon never liked to converse much, Nemesis never makes any effort to engage with him and tends to avoid him. She simply respects his reticence.\nCrossroad Residents.\nMelino\u00eb.\n&lt;a href=\"Melino%C3%AB\"&gt;Melino\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;: Fellow student of Hecate.&lt;br&gt;Nemesis will aid her in her quest against Chronos. However she is disappointed that their mentor chose Melino\u00eb to deal with the Titan instead of her. Despite Melino\u00eb's impression, Nemesis does not hate her, but believes that she has not earned the right to fight Chronos personally, and that it is all \"unfair.\"\nHecate.\n&lt;a href=\"Hecate\"&gt;Hecate&lt;/a&gt;: Nemesis' mentor.&lt;br&gt;Nemesis is disappointed that she chose Melino\u00eb instead of her with the task of killing Chronos, as she believes that if she had trained harder than Melino\u00eb, Hecate would have given her the task of killing the Titan.\nOdysseus.\n&lt;a href=\"Odysseus\"&gt;Odysseus&lt;/a&gt;: Veteran Tactician.\nHe has told her all of his tales and former tricks, to the point she can't stand hearing them again. He appears to be a little afraid of her, prefering to be on her good side just as anyone else, but also mentions he and Hecate shall put her into her place if she oversteps boundaries.\nOlympian Gods.\nArtemis.\n&lt;a href=\"Artemis\"&gt;Artemis&lt;/a&gt;: Goddess of the Hunt. \nShe is the only Olympian who outright grants boons to Nemesis. They're both familiar with one another, and have similar tastes, like wanting to be left alone every now and again. It's implied their relationship is currently a little strained. \nThe Titans.\nChronos.\n&lt;a href=\"Chronos\"&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt;: Titan of Time.\nNemesis seeks to invoke retribution towards him for taking over the House of Hades and trapping her mother and brother. It does not stop her from questioning if Chronos's return was itself a retribution for the gods' actions.&lt;br&gt;"}
