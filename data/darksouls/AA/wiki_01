They will usually switch between conjuring a trail of fire directly at the player or creating a single pillar of flame under their feet. Both of these attacks can be used from a long distance and can hit the player even if they are behind cover.\nThese enemies often appear with &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Knight\"&gt;Pontiff Knight&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Irithyllian%20Slave\"&gt;Irithyllian Slave&lt;/a&gt;s, which makes them challenging to engage directly. It is recommended to take out the accompanying foes before dealing with the Witches themselves, as the player can easily be &lt;a href=\"stagger\"&gt;stagger&lt;/a&gt;ed by other attacks, leaving them open to the Witch's pyromancy.\nWitches are less capable of defending themselves at close-range, although they will use their trident as a melee weapon, as well as casting a medium-ranged stream of flames. They turn slowly and are easily staggered which makes dispatching them relatively easy, as long as the player stays behind them."}

Fireball has a very small blast radius, but anything caught in it will take full damage. Fireball is the weakest projectile pyromancy. Fireball has a somewhat long windup time that can be shortened with a high &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; level. It detonates automatically after traveling a certain distance, and will not deal damage if it detonated before it had time to reach a solid surface. Fireball has a fire attack power of 2.0 times the player's Pyromancy Flame's magic adjust.\nOverview.\nAlthough it is less damaging than its cousins, it can still deal a hefty percentage of most enemies' HP in NG with a well-upgraded &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20Flame\"&gt;pyromancy flame&lt;/a&gt;. The extra numbers of casts mean that Fireball is most well-suited to areas where stronger pyromancies would be overkill. Early in the game, Fireball will easily outclass any other form of attack in terms of damage until players can upgrade their statistics, &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Sorceries&lt;/a&gt;, and other Pyromancies enough. However, Fireball rather quickly loses its potency in &lt;a href=\"New%20Game%20Plus\"&gt;NG+&lt;/a&gt; and beyond.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, Fireball can be frustrating to use due to its small hitbox, relatively low damage, and its long windup time. &lt;a href=\"Great%20Fireball\"&gt;Great Fireball&lt;/a&gt; is much more favored due to both radius and damage."}

Multiple unnamed graves arise from surrounding terrain and the Shrine's interior. Partially decrepit and covered with dust and roots, it serves as the main hub for the player. Differently than in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\", in this game it is the only location where leveling up, upgrading weapons, and even buying new items take place.\nThe opening area is a large circular chamber where five great thrones face a central bonfire, the only bonfire guarded by a Firekeeper in the whole game. Each of the five thrones looks different and unique, fitting the &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord of Cinder&lt;/a&gt; it is made for: The first &lt;a href=\"Aldrich%2C%20Devourer%20of%20Gods\"&gt;draped with a extravagant red cloth and covered in saintly candles&lt;/a&gt;; the next &lt;a href=\"Ludleth%20of%20Courland\"&gt;plain and lightly decorated&lt;/a&gt;; the center is &lt;a href=\"Lothric%2C%20Younger%20Prince\"&gt;heavily charred with molten streaks and half-melted features&lt;/a&gt;; the next is &lt;a href=\"Abyss%20Watchers\"&gt;flanked with a number of swords besides it&lt;/a&gt;; and the final is &lt;a href=\"Yhorm%20the%20Giant\"&gt;much too large for any normal human to sit upon&lt;/a&gt;. All of these thrones (save the second) are missing their respective Lords, and thus the Unkindled must find them and force their cinders to be seated.\nBelow the main entrance is a tunnel that leads to a back chamber. The &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20Handmaid\"&gt;Shrine Handmaid&lt;/a&gt; sells goods here, and &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20Andre\"&gt;Blacksmith Andre&lt;/a&gt; smiths goods here. Throughout the journey, the Unkindled can recruit a number of vendors and tutors to get new gear and learn new spells.\nBehind the Shrine a tower arises, containing useful items and accessible after obtaining &lt;a href=\"Tower%20Key%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Tower Key&lt;/a&gt;. At the top of Shrine's dome &lt;a href=\"Nestling\"&gt;Nestling&lt;/a&gt; resides.\nBonfires.\nFirelink Shrine is a subsection of the &lt;a href=\"Cemetery%20of%20Ash\"&gt;Cemetery of Ash&lt;/a&gt; and comprises the following &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;:\nCharacters.\nThis is a list of characters that either reside or will visit the shrine at some point, whether it is temporarily or to stay there for the rest of the game:"}
{"id": "3731", "revid": "357109", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3731", "title": "Firestorm", "text": "Firestorm is an area-of-effect &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Pyromancy&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAvailability.\nSold by &lt;a href=\"Quelana%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Quelana of Izalith&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blighttown\"&gt;Blighttown&lt;/a&gt; for 30,000 &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s.\nGeneral information.\nFirestorm has twenty \"uses\" per slot. A full cast of Firestorm will expend 17 of these \"uses\"; attempting to cast Firestorm again will result in a much weaker spell. Using Firestorm causes many (17 in a full cast) pillars of fire to erupt from the ground in a large area around the player. The spell has a fire attack power of 3.2 times the Pyromancy Flame's magic adjust and most enemies that get hit by it will be knocked back, possibly into another flame pillar.\nFirestorm has a very long windup time that can be shortened through improving the Dexterity stat. Firestorm and its variants also have a distinctive sound accompanying its casting, which makes it difficult to surprise human enemies with. It may be canceled or interrupted if the caster is hit, in which case not all 17 casts will be used.\nDespite its description, Firestorm will not deal damage to allies. It will, however, damage neutral characters such as merchants.\nOverview.\nFirestorm and its variations are popular for their dramatic effect and high damage. It is a high-risk, high-reward set of pyromancy to use in PvP due to its very high damage but its lethargic cast time. Firestorm itself is less popular than both of its more powerful cousins, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Tempest\"&gt;Fire Tempest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Storm\"&gt;Chaos Storm&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirestorm and its variants deals some of the highest damage in the game. It has the potential to hit twice, and if it does so, the result is often fatal. Unfortunately, Firestorm also features the longest cast time in the game, half of during which the player cannot move. If opponents have a decent ranged attack (such as &lt;a href=\"Great%20Chaos%20Fireball\"&gt;Great Chaos Fireball&lt;/a&gt;), a firestorm caster may very likely be getting the short end of the stick."}

Each pillar will inflict 1.75 times the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Buff\"&gt;Spell Buff&lt;/a&gt; of the catalyst as &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage and knock any targets skyward.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt; cost of this spell is expressed per-pillar.

Gray crags, &lt;a href=\"archtree\"&gt;archtree&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"everlasting%20dragons\"&gt;everlasting dragons&lt;/a&gt; were the extent of that which existed there. This period was known as the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Ancients\"&gt;Age of Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut then, the Advent of Fire occurred. This created Disparity in the world: with it came heat and cold, life and death, and light and &lt;a href=\"The%20Dark\"&gt;dark&lt;/a&gt;. From the dark, came humanoid creatures - &lt;a href=\"Hollows\"&gt;Hollows&lt;/a&gt;. These creatures found &lt;a href=\"souls\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; near the First Flame, and took on the powers they gave. With the strength of these souls, four figures were born: &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Nito\"&gt;Gravelord Nito&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Witch of Izalith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20the%20Lord%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Gwyn, the Lord of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Furtive%20Pygmy\"&gt;Furtive Pygmy&lt;/a&gt;. With the powers gained, the &lt;a href=\"Lords\"&gt;Lords&lt;/a&gt; overthrew the dragons, ushering in the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Age of Fire&lt;/a&gt;.\nAge of Fire.\nWith the dragons defeated, the Lords took over the world. It was a prosperous era, and from it many nations were born. The land which the lords hailed from, &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt;, became the center of many adventures for those of other nations to engage in. The First Flame became linked to the bonfires throughout Lordran, and gave power to them. In time, however, the Flame began to fade. Had the Flame guttered out completely, it would have ended the Age of Fire and brought about the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Dark\"&gt;Age of Dark&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesperate to ensure that their Age of Fire continued, and afraid of the coming Dark, Gwyn did everything to keep the flame lit. They linked the bonfires to &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity, and shepherded the humans to kindle the flames. In contrast, the Witch of Izalith attempted to use her soul to create a new flame, but this did not work, instead birthing the &lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; and, by extension, the creation of &lt;a href=\"Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Demons\"&gt;Demons&lt;/a&gt;.\nAware that time was quickly running out for his kingdom, Gwyn and a detachment of his knights entered the &lt;a href=\"Kiln%20of%20the%20First%20Flame\"&gt;Kiln of the First Flame&lt;/a&gt;. Gwyn had them stand guard while he entered the room which contained the First Flame. Gwyn then sacrificed himself to the Flame, turning the Kiln to ash, and incinerating all of his knights, creating the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight\"&gt;Black Knight&lt;/a&gt;s and dooming them to wander the lands as disembodied spirits forever after.\nThe start of \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\" takes place some time after all of this has occurred, and the Flame is quickly fading. Soon, only Dark will remain.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;\", many Lords of Cinder had come and passed and the Age of Fire had persevered. However, when the new chosen Lord, Prince Lothric, refused to link the fire, a desperate attempt to save the fading Flame began. Four Lords of Cinder were resurrected to link the fire once more, however - aside from &lt;a href=\"Ludleth%20of%20Courland\"&gt;Ludleth of Courland&lt;/a&gt; - they too chose to abandon their duties, forcing the Ashen One to drag them back."}

They can be accessed by:\nStrategy.\nFlame Salamanders are powerful foes and their attacks can easily kill the\u00a0unprepared. The player is advised to eliminate them from a safe distance using spells or arrows, but they must still be ready to evade the fireballs they spit.\nA salamander will shoot three fireballs with a short pause between the first and second, if the first fireball connects, the player will be unable to evade the other two if they don't have enough poise (about 40 poise seems to enable dodging the other two fireball after the first one connects). Rarely they will also attack by breathing fire. This attack can be avoided by being out of its (fairly long) range or running around the Salamander's right side, as it spits fire from left to right.\nHitting a Salamander's stomach will deal increased damage. Although it is risky to do, one can use ranged attacks to hit the stomach as the Salamander rises up to shoot its fireballs. If timed correctly, one can get a hit in and then run to cover. It is also possible to hit their stomach without them shooting at the player, although this requires the player to be below them, and the Salamander has to be at an incline.\nAt close range, a salamander will use its long tongue to strike the player or ram them with its head. Both of these attacks drain an immense amount of stamina and will often bypass a shield completely. If the player wishes to engage them in melee combat, attacking the soft flesh on their necks and stomach will deal more damage than attacking their scales.\nA relatively safe way to kill them as a melee player is to position oneself between their front and hind leg. This will cause the tracking AI to overcompensate for the player's position, and send the salamander into a repetitive spinning motion. Sticking between its legs will prevent the player from being hit by its front or hind attacks, and will also hold the player in place as the salamander spins, allowing them to strike its midsection at leisure.\nA safe way to kill them from a distance is by using projectile magic, throwing knives or arrows from above. &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Throwing%20Knife%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poison Throwing Knives&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Arrows&lt;/a&gt; particularly effective. The poison takes effect after four to five hits, and will drain about 1,000 HP. On top of this, the physical damage can deal up to 500 damage, if a strong enough &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; is used. Using &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20Mist%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Toxic&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Poison%20Mist%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poison Mist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Fog%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dark Fog&lt;/a&gt; are good choices as well, although the range is limited, as a single cast is enough to poison a Salamander. Note that they will react to the poison, and aggro on the player as a result."}

The first phase will also ignite the sword, buffing it with 80 &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage for 46 seconds. Inputting a strong attack while in this lunge animation will bring the sword into an upward arc that ends behind the player, sending forth a plume of flame and inflicting 1.6 times the weapon's Attack Rating as damage and 2.1 times the weapon's base Poise damage to any enemies in front of the player, while knocking them skyward. The flame plume inflicts 1.0 times the weapon's Fire Attack Rating as damage, as well as 0.5 times the weapon's base Poise damage.\nUsage.\nSingle Player.\nThis skill allows the player to bring strong focused damage onto a single enemy in front of them. Like the &lt;a href=\"Greatsword%20of%20Judgment\"&gt;Greatsword of Judgment&lt;/a&gt;, it is also useful for buffing a weapon with innate elemental damage with additional damage of the same type, greatly increasing its effectiveness.\nOnline.\nThis skill is essentially a modified version of the &lt;a href=\"Stomp%20%28upward%29\"&gt;upward Stomp&lt;/a&gt;, and as such can be used similarly. Performing only the first phase of the skill can quickly buff the sword for a combat advantage, and the flame plume can be used to catch enemies in the distance or to make terrain hazardous to navigate, forcing enemy players to either roll predictably or move in a different direction."}

Both sides each dual wield their own respective weaponry of either spiked clubs or scimitars.\nLocation.\nThe Flexile Sentry can be found in the brig of the ship that arrives to &lt;a href=\"No-man%27s%20Wharf\"&gt;No-man's Wharf&lt;/a&gt;. The ship is called into dock by ringing the bell at the top of the cliffside village.\nA Flexile Sentry also appears in the &lt;a href=\"Shaded%20Woods\"&gt;Shaded Woods&lt;/a&gt;, near the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Winter\"&gt;Shrine of Winter&lt;/a&gt; on the path to &lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Castle\"&gt;Drangleic Castle&lt;/a&gt;. Two non-respawning Sentries are also found behind the torch-locked gate in &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Eleum%20Loyce\"&gt;Frozen Eleum Loyce&lt;/a&gt;.\nScholar of the First Sin.\nIn \"\", a respawning Flexile Sentry spawns in &lt;a href=\"Sinners%27%20Rise\"&gt;Sinners' Rise&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of the flooded prison area, replacing the &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Undead\"&gt;Enhanced Undead&lt;/a&gt; normally present here; from NG+ onward, both will spawn in this area. The Flexile Sentry normally found in the Shaded Woods has been replaced with a &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Guardian\"&gt;Forest Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nSummoning &lt;a href=\"Lucatiel%20of%20Mirrah\"&gt;Lucatiel of Mirrah&lt;/a&gt; will make the boss fight significantly easier, if you use her to distract the boss. As well, &lt;a href=\"Bradley%20of%20the%20Old%20Guard\"&gt;Bradley of the Old Guard&lt;/a&gt; can be summoned for this fight in \".\"\nMost of the Flexile Sentry's attacks are basic combos of up to three or four hits. The attacks from the club-wielding torso are typically slower but drain more stamina\u00a0if blocked, while the opposite is true for the scimitar-wielding side. If playing on the safer side, simply equip a shield with decent defense against &lt;a href=\"Physical%20Damage\"&gt;physical damage&lt;/a&gt;; dodge and attack in between the attacks of the clubs, whilst blocking when need be.\nThe scimitar-wielder has an attack that pierces guards and grapples the player, dealing massive damage. This can be detected by him pulling back and lining up one of his swords for a forward stabbing attack. It's generally best to try and keep one's health near full to avoid the risk of being instantly killed by the ensuing damage.\nAnother good tactic is to use the mast that is in the center of the room as a way to hinder the Flexile Sentry's movement. If a player positions himself such that the mast is between the boss and themselves, then the range of its attacks will be cut short, without coming close to the player. This makes it easier for the player to attack the Flexile Sentry after each of his combos. Bear in mind that the player will still have to move around the mast to make this tactic work, as the Flexile Sentry will jump around the room quite often and miss the mast.\nThe water level also rises gradually throughout the fight, making movement slightly more difficult.\nThere is an interesting way to get past the Flexile Sentry guarding the &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20Ward%20Key\"&gt;Garrison Ward Key&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Eleum%20Loyce\"&gt;Frozen Eleum Loyce&lt;/a&gt;. Simply go in and dispatch the first sentry and the &lt;a href=\"Retainer\"&gt;Retainer&lt;/a&gt; sorceresses with melee or range (range is preferred). Next, head up the ramp to the right side of the entrance to get to the uppermost layer. Drop down to the middle ledge and shoot the Flexile Sentry guarding the key with an arrow or a &lt;a href=\"Throwing%20Knife%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;throwing knife&lt;/a&gt;. It will attempt to travel up the tunnel to reach you, but will get stuck because the tunnel is too narrow. Its artificial intelligence will force it to continue trying to track you through the tunnel, so just jump down, grab the key and run out or warp using any method (&lt;a href=\"Homeward%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Homeward&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Homeward%20Bone%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Homeward Bone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Aged%20Feather\"&gt;Aged Feather&lt;/a&gt;).\nNG+.\nIt should be noted that in &lt;a href=\"New%20Game%20Plus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;NG+&lt;/a&gt; (New Game+) and all further NG+ levels, the boss fight has two &lt;a href=\"Suspicious%20Shadow\"&gt;Suspicious Shadow&lt;/a&gt;s included. They are small, fast striking minions which deal considerable damage, &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bleeding&lt;/a&gt; potential and &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; buildup. They should be fought away from the boss if possible and dodging should be prioritized over blocking, as they can easily smash through your &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; and begin to combo into you due to the speed of their attacks. They hang from the ceiling at the center of the room and will drop down shortly after entering the encounter. It is recommended to make use of a phantom/player summon, such as &lt;a href=\"Lucatiel%20of%20Mirrah\"&gt;Lucatiel&lt;/a&gt;, to pull aggro on the boss and ensure they are killed off first before proceeding with the sentry itself.\nDefenses.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 Flexile Sentry by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaIoN2syFmY&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

Like a normal torch, switching to it will make biting worms ditch the player, if they have been attacked by the corpse worms of the Cathedral or the insects of the painting. It sheds light like a torch. It does both strike and fire damage, in serviceable if unexciting amounts of each (though many enemies flail when hurt by fire damage, leaving them open to another hit). The major draw of the weapon, apart from its functionality for exploration, is its weapon art.\nThe weapon art spews a swathe of fire from left to right and back again in a wide arc in front of the player. This is pure fire damage, it can hitstun enemies, and can hit an enemy multiple times. It actually does excellent amount of fire damage for its FP consumption, making it more efficient than many pyromancies. It's excellent for slaying enemies that flinch when hit and those weak to fire, knots of enemies, and large enemies. If an enemy has the poise to go through it, the player will likely get hit by an enemy charging through the flames. Nonetheless, if the player is so inclined and has the stats and space, this is a worthwhile piece of gear.\nMoveset.\n&lt;br&gt;\nUpgrades.\n&lt;br&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

They usually perform one attack at a time, so it is a good strategy to let them attack first, blocking if they perform a headbutt or moving away if they breath &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;.\nCaution must be taken when they start rolling, as this attack has very good tracking and may hit the player even if they try to get out of the way. Roll to a side just as the lizard is about to make contact to evade it. This attack becomes much more dangerous in close quarters, where the lizard may end up locking the player in place while running them over, dealing continuous damage.\nAn easy method to dispose of them is to kick them toward a cliff. The lizard will be sent rolling backward and fall to its demise."}

{"id": "15970", "revid": "56333033", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15970", "title": "Rolling", "text": "Rolling is a element in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\".\nGeneral Information.\nContrary to popular belief, all roll types have 11 iframes except for the roll type associated with &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wood%20Grain%20Ring\"&gt;Dark Wood Grain Ring&lt;/a&gt; (also called Ninja Flip) which has 13 iframes. The main differences between roll types is the overall length of the animation coupled with Recovery Frames and Instability Frames. Instability Frames are the most critical aspect of rolling, as these are points in the animation where the player character will take 1.4x additional damage when hit. Dark Wood Grain Ring roll type is the only roll with no Instability Frames. \nDark Wood Grain Ring Roll - Ninja Flip.\nTo utilize the effect of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wood%20Grain%20Ring\"&gt;Dark Wood Grain Ring&lt;/a&gt; the player character must be at or less than 25% of their current equipment load. This roll type removes all Instability Frames in the animation and grants 2 additional iFrames to this roll type making the total iFrames 13. This is the most ideal roll type if the player is choosing to roll. \nFast Roll - Light Roll.\nPlayers have a Fast Roll if their &lt;a href=\"equipment\"&gt;equipment&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"weight\"&gt;weight&lt;/a&gt; is 25% or less of their maximum equipment load. Within the fast rolling category, there are four categories: Fast rolls have far fewer instability frames than Mid and Fat rolls. Fast Roll is one of the most ideal types of roll if the player is opting to roll, second only to Ninja Flip. While at Fast Roll weight, player movement speed will be at its fastest possible while sprinting and walking. \nMedium Roll - Mid Roll.\nPlayers have Mid Roll if their equipment weight is 26% to 50% of their maximum equipment load. Just like the fast roll, there are several different categories that affect speed of recovery after the roll: Medium rolls have 14 instability frames in their animation meaning there are more frames where the player takes 1.4x additional damage than they have iframes. This means that if the player is at Mid Roll weight, they should lean into &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Defense\"&gt;Defense&lt;/a&gt; mechanics rather than rolling. The 1.4x additional damage taken during Instability Frames is enough to partially or fully negate the defenses that player armor provides. While at Mid Roll weight player speed during actions like sprinting and walking will be reduced slightly. \nSlow Roll - Fat Roll.\nPlayers have a Fat Roll if their equipment weight is 51% to 100% of their equipment load. Fat rolls have vastly more instability frames in their animation than iframes. This means that if the player is at Fat Roll weight, they should lean into &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Defense\"&gt;Defense&lt;/a&gt; mechanics rather than rolling. The 1.4x additional damage taken during Instability Frames is enough to partially or fully negate the defenses that player armor provides. While at Fat Roll weight, player movement speed will be greatly reduced while sprinting and walking. It is best to never be within Fat Roll weight range. \nShould 100% equipment load be exceeded, the player cannot roll and staggers if attempting to do so. Over encumbered players will not be able to sprint, they can only walk in a style that as been affectionally dubbed as \"poop walking\" by the community. "}

She is voiced by , who also voices one of the &lt;a href=\"Milfanito\"&gt;Milfanito&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation.\nShe can be found as a petrified statue near\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Majula\"&gt;Majula&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0blocking the door to\u00a0the &lt;a href=\"Shaded%20Woods\"&gt;Shaded Woods&lt;/a&gt;. To find her, backtrack toward &lt;a href=\"Things%20Betwixt\"&gt;Things Betwixt&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0from &lt;a href=\"The%20Far%20Fire\"&gt;The Far Fire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;, and then enter the first cave on the right.\nPlot.\nRosabeth of Melfia is a gifted &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;pyromancy&lt;/a&gt; student, although she acknowledges she still has much to learn. She constantly talks highly about her teacher, a famed sorcerer from Melfia called &lt;a href=\"Carhillion%20of%20the%20Fold\"&gt;Carhillion of the Fold&lt;/a&gt;. Rosabeth got fascinated by his &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;sorceries&lt;/a&gt; and when Carhillion set off on a journey to &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt;, she went after him; however, not long after that they got separated. Trying to find his whereabouts, Rosabeth was attacked by a &lt;a href=\"Basilisk%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Basilisk&lt;/a&gt; on her way to the &lt;a href=\"Shaded%20Woods\"&gt;Shaded Woods&lt;/a&gt;. She was able to close the gate that gave access to that area, but not before the Basilisk could use its petrifying breath on her, transforming her into a stone statue still holding the contraption which activated the gate.\nEventually, the &lt;a href=\"Bearer%20of%20the%20Curse\"&gt;Bearer of the Curse&lt;/a&gt; released her from her petrified state. She then resumed her task of finding her teacher, although she also came to the conclusion that she might be more of a burden to him, thus deciding to keep her distance and suspecting Carhillion actually ditched her when she first lost track of him.\nAppearance.\nRosabeth's skin is dark-red tanned. She has pitch-black straight long hair and heavy dark-red lipstick. When the player first meets her, she's wearing a long dress made with various pieces of fabric stitched together, and is also barefooted. It is not specified, however, how or why she got that kind of outfit, as being petrified would supposedly preserve her wares and the dress doesn't seem to have been ripped apart by the attack (in fact, it appears to have been badly sewn with old rag pieces from the beginning).\nHer most distinctive trait, however, is a white tattoo on her forehead of what appears to be a third eye which opens vertically.\nGeneral information.\nThe player can use a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Fragrant%20Branch%20of%20Yore\"&gt;Fragrant Branch of Yore&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to un-petrify her. After she is saved, she will thank the player and give them a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Prism%20Stone%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Prism Stone&lt;/a&gt;. She will then sell items and upgrade &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20Flames\"&gt;Pyromancy Flames&lt;/a&gt;. If the player talks to her afterward, she will ask if they can give her a set of clothes as she is only using old rags, the player then obtains the option to give her pieces of armor (that can't be taken back), and if the player does so and uses the talk option, she will move to &lt;a href=\"Majula\"&gt;Majula&lt;/a&gt;, next to the staircase leading to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Saulden\"&gt;Saulden&lt;/a&gt;.\nOpening the door where she was petrified at releases many enemies into the area. Rosabeth and the &lt;a href=\"Bearer%20of%20the%20Curse\"&gt;Bearer of the Curse&lt;/a&gt; will then be trapped in an enclosed space, which may cause her to be unintentionally killed. It is best to ensure she leaves the area by getting her to go to Majula first, or simply leave the area and come back, which will cause her to stand outside, next to &lt;a href=\"Benhart%20of%20Jugo\"&gt;Benhart&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn , it's easier to save her, as there are some barrels filled with powder nearby. Making them explode will make all &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s come out from their cells without closing the entrance to the arena, allowing the player to deal with them before un-petrifying Rosabeth."}

However, it demands slightly higher stats and the blade is much shorter than the Flamberge, which impacts its usefulness somewhat, especially when multiple foes are faced at once. Additionally, the Flamberge is likely to have more bleed build-up per hit due to bleed &lt;a href=\"Scaling%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt; off of the player's &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;.

However Sir Syan was killed during the war against the Giants and his armor became cursed. Shortly after his death, the unfortunate knights that wore his armor were driven insane.\nLocation.\nRoyal Guards can be found most often in &lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Castle\"&gt;Drangleic Castle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Crypt\"&gt;Undead Crypt&lt;/a&gt;. In , they can be found throughout Drangleic, often guarding important paths or blocking the way to treasure.\nStrategy.\nRoyal Guards can wield either a greatsword or a &lt;a href=\"Syan%27s%20Halberd\"&gt;halberd&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on their armament, they require different strategies to deal with. However, in both cases they move very slowly, although they also have tremendous health that makes them tough to bring down, and in encounters in \"Scholar of the First Sin\" can deal tremendous damage to low-level players should their attacks connect.\nHalberd wielders will often attack from behind their shields, though don't track the player as they begin their attacks. They can be easily avoided by strafing to their left (player's right), and dealing critical damage with a &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe sword wielders will usually chain their attacks into two or three-swipe combos. Like the halberd wielders, these attacks have relatively poor tracking and can be sidestepped for easy backstabs.\nIf the player attacks their greatshield while they are blocking, the Royal Guard may bring their weapon up and charge it with lightning, and then bring it down for a very strong attack. It is very easily telegraphed, and its overhead nature makes it easy to avoid by &lt;a href=\"rolling\"&gt;rolling&lt;/a&gt; to the side so long as the player is not obstructed by terrain or obstacles.\nIt is easy to simply tank or avoid their attacks until they eventually start blocking and backing away, at which point the player can simply &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Break\"&gt;Guard Break&lt;/a&gt; them and &lt;a href=\"Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Riposte&lt;/a&gt; while they are &lt;a href=\"stagger\"&gt;stagger&lt;/a&gt;ed.

It is fought in the &lt;a href=\"Doors%20of%20Pharros\"&gt;Doors of Pharros&lt;/a&gt;, just past the second &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;. Initially, there are four small &lt;a href=\"Dog%20Rat\"&gt;Dog Rat&lt;/a&gt;s in the room. Once the small rats are engaged the boss will jump down and attack.\nPlot.\nThe Royal Rat Authority is one of the many loyal subjects of the &lt;a href=\"Rat%20King%20%28character%29\"&gt;Rat King&lt;/a&gt;, and serves as a test to prove the &lt;a href=\"Bearer%20of%20the%20Curse\"&gt;Bearer of the Curse&lt;/a&gt;'s worthiness to him.\nSummoning.\nThere are no NPCs that can be summoned as a &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt; for this fight. It seems that other players can't be summoned to assist as well. This is probably due to the fact that this area is a &lt;a href=\"PvP%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; area designed to forcibly take the player into another player's world.\nFight overview.\nOnce you enter the &lt;a href=\"Fog%20Door%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;fog door&lt;/a&gt;, the boss fight does not start immediately. This gives the player some time to devise a plan to take on the first phase. Whatever choice the player makes, it needs to be acted on quickly once the rats are aggroed because the boss will soon jump down and join the fight. The small rats can inflict large amounts of &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Toxic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"stunlock\"&gt;stunlock&lt;/a&gt; the player, while the Rat Authority can take the player out with one attack.\nStrategy.\nThere are a couple of ways to tackle this boss and all ways go to killing all four of the smaller rats immediately.\nPhase 1:\nPhase 2: The boss is very simple, but can be annoying. What one wants to do is stand under it as it has a spinning attack that will cause heavy damage and drain the &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; bar quite rapidly if blocked. It is possible to run under it and attack its left hind leg as it does its front paw swipes. Use caution as it can follow-up quickly with additional swipes. Circling to its right will help to avoid most of its attacks. The Authority's charging headbutt is possibly its most dangerous attack, and can be rather troublesome to dodge. However, this attack can easily be blocked if the player has a shield with high &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt;. It is advisable to &lt;a href=\"roll\"&gt;roll&lt;/a&gt; away or &lt;a href=\"backstep\"&gt;backstep&lt;/a&gt; when it is at critical health, as it will vomit an acidic substance that will &lt;a href=\"Durability\"&gt;degrade&lt;/a&gt; your equipment very quickly and potentially break it.\nDefenses.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 Royal Rat Authority by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJRRy1L0nvQ&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

It should be noted that killing the boss will stop rats from spawning in the area as when the boss was alive.\nDescription.\nThe Royal Rat Vanguard has a very similar appearance and size to the rest of the rats fought in the room. However, it has\u00a0a prominent crest of\u00a0hair on its back.\nPlot.\nThe Royal Rat Vanguard is one of the many loyal subjects of the &lt;a href=\"Rat%20King%20%28character%29\"&gt;Rat King&lt;/a&gt;, and serves as a test to prove the &lt;a href=\"Bearer%20of%20the%20Curse\"&gt;Bearer of the Curse&lt;/a&gt;'s worthiness to him.\nStrategy.\nUpon entering the &lt;a href=\"Fog%20Door%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;fog gate&lt;/a&gt; to this room, there will be no health bar at the bottom of the screen, nor seemingly any &lt;a href=\"Enemies%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after, though, many normal rats will attack the player. They are easy to kill, but can swarm the player easily and &lt;a href=\"stunlock\"&gt;stunlock&lt;/a&gt; them. The indestructible rat statues in this room also block movement. It is best to keep moving to avoid being trapped, and only stopping to attack so that each attack can damage multiple enemies. They can cause &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"buildup\"&gt;buildup&lt;/a&gt; with their attacks, so bringing &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Moss\"&gt;Poison Moss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Charm\"&gt;Dragon Charm&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"Common%20Fruit\"&gt;Common Fruit&lt;/a&gt; will help greatly.\nAlthough the normal rats spawn endlessly, after killing 10 rats, the boss' health gauge will finally appear, and the boss will fall into the room. It looks very similar to the rest of the rats though can be found in the crowd by looking for a rat that's slightly bigger than the rest and has a mane over its body. It does not have much health, though, and is thus easily killed with a powerful &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;. The other rats spawn endlessly but killing multiple rats in one go can give you some momentary breathing room.\nIt is a good idea to keep a close eye on the Vanguard once spotted, as this can help with finding it amongst the melee. The actual boss does much more damage and can cause more poison buildup than the rest of the rats.\nIf the player has access to either &lt;a href=\"Firestorm%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Firestorm&lt;/a&gt; or another high-damage &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; spell, it is highly recommended that they &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;attune&lt;/a&gt; it for use during the fight. A long-range weapon can be used to attack the Vanguard from a distance but the player must\u00a0keep an eye on the positions of the remaining rats at all times. A good example of an AoE spell to use is &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Appease\"&gt;Soul Appease&lt;/a&gt;, as it will almost always one-shot most of the rats present in the arena as well as do a large amount of damage to the boss itself, making the boss battle incredibly easy.\nAlso, if the player possesses the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Evil%20Eye%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Ring of the Evil Eye&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(A +1 version is obtained in the deep pit) this fight becomes easier as you can kill the rats and regain health rapidly if you have a high enough damage weapon.\nOnce The Vanguard is defeated, the remaining rats exit from the arena.\nBoss information.\nAttacks.\nThe boss itself and the normal rats share the same attacks.\nDefenses.\nAll Rats in the game have the below stats except that physical defense changes slightly, and the Mongrel Rat has only 50% poison resistance.\nAll rats except the boss have 30% curse resist.

He is found behind the staircase after taking a right.\nDescription.\nNavlaan appears to be a kind young man suffering from possession by a malevolent entity, as he speaks in a gentle and timid voice to a human player and an evil, malicious voice to a &lt;a href=\"hollow\"&gt;hollow&lt;/a&gt;ed player and refers to himself in the plural. His light persona also asks the player explicitly not to release him. The messages before the switch on the first floor warning the player to pull back, seem to refer to Navlaan and his dangerous dual nature.\nLore.\nA royal sorcerer once worked on research to devise powerful new spells, hoping to bring new forms of magic to the world. However, something went wrong during the experiments, causing the creation of a malevolent entity who possessed the young sorcerer, causing him to develop a split personality. Said entity calls itself Navlaan.\nOne day, Navlaan took full control of the sorcerer's psyche and went on a killing spree. After the \"good side\" of the sorcerer woke up, he discovered all the murders that Navlaan had committed. Terrified of such acts and feeling partially responsible for what had transpired, the sorcerer sealed himself and Navlaan away behind a magic barrier.\nThe description for the &lt;a href=\"hexes\"&gt;hexes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scraps%20of%20Life\"&gt;Scraps of Life&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Darkstorm\"&gt;Darkstorm&lt;/a&gt;, states that Navlaan and his entire village were executed for fear of necromancy. Therefore, it is possible that either the malevolent entity is the spirit of Navlaan himself or the entity is a separate being that simply adopted the name of Navlaan.\nNavlaan is discovered in his prison by the &lt;a href=\"Bearer%20of%20the%20Curse\"&gt;Bearer of the Curse&lt;/a&gt;. If the Bearer is hollow, the malevolent entity will speak them, asking them to perform a series of murders and to bring Navlaan proof of their victims' demise, in return for rewards. These victims are &lt;a href=\"Laddersmith%20Gilligan\"&gt;Laddersmith Gilligan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cale%20the%20Cartographer\"&gt;Cale the Cartographer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Felkin%20the%20Outcast\"&gt;Felkin the Outcast&lt;/a&gt;, and finally, the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Herald\"&gt;Emerald Herald&lt;/a&gt;. His first two targets appear to have angered Navlaan in some way, in particular Cale, who came upon Navlaan in his travels and treated him as if he were a rare species of animal. His reasons for wishing Felkin dead are unknown, and he requests that the Bearer kills the Emerald Herald because he wants them to kill \"someone of import\", though he expresses doubt in her claims to be the \"&lt;a href=\"Fire%20Keeper\"&gt;Last Firekeeper&lt;/a&gt;\". \nThe Bearer of the Curse may either assassinate Navlaan's targets, or acquire the proof Navlaan seeks through peaceful means, allowing them to trick him into believing his marks are dead. Either way, Navlaan will be at peace, and offer his services as a merchant. If the Bearer of the Curse releases Navlaan, Navlaan will declare that he has found a new mark, and will begin relentlessly pursuing them. \nAssassination quest.\nIf the player speaks to Navlaan while &lt;a href=\"hollow\"&gt;hollow&lt;/a&gt; and before releasing him, he will ask the player to return bounties from four characters in exchange for rewards. The items from the bounties will not be taken out of the player's inventory upon presenting them to Navlaan. Completing all bounties will reward the player with the &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Set\"&gt;Chaos Set&lt;/a&gt;.\nTricking Navlaan.\nAll four characters can be spared by obtaining their item through different methods, the following are how each item is acquired without murdering the character:\nReleasing Navlaan.\nNavlaan can be freed by throwing a lever located on the opposite side of the room he's found at. Doing this will end his assassination quests and allow a &lt;a href=\"dark%20spirit\"&gt;dark spirit&lt;/a&gt; version of him to occasionally invade while human, each yielding a &lt;a href=\"Human%20Effigy\"&gt;Human Effigy&lt;/a&gt; upon defeat.\nIf he is spoken to while Hollow now, he'll tell the player he's going to travel around the world, implying he'll continue murdering people indiscriminately throughout his journeys. If he is spoken to while human, his light persona will sell items.\nKilling his human form at Aldia's Keep will prevent any further invasions from his dark spirit form.\nInvasions.\nIf Navlaan is released, he will invade the player in the following locations:"}

They are often found in teams of around 3-4 soldiers and they will\u00a0work together to overwhelm the player. They wield greatswords and crossbows.\nThough both of them look alike, the Castle variant are more aggressive and can do more damage. Standing their ground when using the crossbow and switching weapons only when the player approaches within a few units of distance.\nStrategy.\nRoyal Swordsmen are weak individually but they work in teams and can easily overwhelm the player if they trap them in a corner. Greatsword-wielding soldiers will attempt to rush the player while their comrades armed with crossbows will open fire from a distance.\nThese enemies have low poise and are easily &lt;a href=\"stagger\"&gt;stagger&lt;/a&gt;ed. It is advisable to use ranged attacks to thin their numbers when they assault the player in a group. It is also worth noting that they are particularly weak to strike damage."}

The boss fight is a three on one, and players must achieve victory through dividing and conquering, separating the individual Sentinels and defeating them one by one.\nThe summon sign of &lt;a href=\"Pilgrim%20Bellclaire\"&gt;Pilgrim Bellclaire&lt;/a&gt;, an NPC &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;white phantom&lt;/a&gt;, can be found in a cell in the hallway before the fog gate. In \"\", a &lt;a href=\"Shade\"&gt;Shade&lt;/a&gt; summon in the form of &lt;a href=\"Felicia%20the%20Brave\"&gt;Felicia the Brave&lt;/a&gt; can be found near a wall switch in the room prior to the jail cell hallway.\nA total of five Ruin Sentinels appear as respawning enemies\u00a0in &lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Castle\"&gt;Drangleic Castle&lt;/a&gt;. They are found behind several doors found past the &lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Castle%23Bonfires\"&gt;King's Gate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;, with a high number of &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Soldier\"&gt;Stone Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s guarding the room. The doors require the release of nearby souls to open, so killing a Stone Soldier within their proximity will open the doors, forfeiting the souls in the process.\nLore.\nCreations of the jailer, the Ruin Sentinels are formless souls that haunt distinct &lt;a href=\"Ruin%20Set\"&gt;suits of armor&lt;/a&gt;. They seem to guard &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Bastille\"&gt;The Lost Bastille&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Castle\"&gt;Drangleic Castle&lt;/a&gt; which, combined with their nature as souls controlling a suit of armor, makes them similar to the &lt;a href=\"Ironclad%20Soldier\"&gt;Ironclad Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s that assumed positions in Drangleic's royal army.\nTheir design is based on the armor of a company of knights who were sent by an Old King to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Soul\"&gt;Dark Soul&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Ringed%20City%20%28location%29\"&gt;Ringed City&lt;/a&gt;. However they were soundly defeated and a dark fable was written about their fate. The original company ended up serving the judicators of the Ringed City.\nStrategy.\nThe Ruin Sentinels have hard-hitting attacks, however they can all be blocked with a good shield or dodged through rolling. As well, their attacks are easily telegraphed and most have long recovery times that allow players to inflict damage on them while they are immobilized. Care must be taken when fighting more than one at a time, as they can chain consecutive attacks together that can break a player's guard and leave them vulnerable to combos. Place priority in evading attacks and looking for opportunities to strike during their attack recovery, rather than going on the offensive.\nWhen entering the boss room, players are initially faced with only Ruin Sentinel Yahim on an elevated platform above the rest of the arena; Alessia will be on the ground level on the opposite side of the room, while Ricce on another elevated platform. If the player does not leave the initial platform, Alessia and Ricce will not attempt to assist Yahim, making the fight considerably easier. Once Yahim is defeated, Alessia and Ricce will join the fight, both approaching to attack the player.\nBear in mind, the Ruin Sentinels are able to jump up to the starting platform from the ground below, performing a smashing or sweeping attack as they do so. Should Yahim fall off the platform mid-fight he will attempt to jump back on, while Alessia and Ricce can both jump up to the platform to engage the player once aggroed. When jumping off the platform, beware that fall damage will be incurred, so try to fall off when there is enough time and space to prevent a Sentinel from immediately attacking. As well, attempting to roll immediately following the fall can help in creating more distance, giving players time to use a healing item prior to re-engaging. If positioning makes it possible, a &lt;a href=\"Plunging%20Attack%23Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;plunging attack&lt;/a&gt; on one of the Sentinels can inflict considerable damage.\nWhen fighting Alessia and Ricce, try to separate them out or keep one behind the other, and attacking only when one is outside of attack range and the other is recovering after their own attack. Keep both within visual range at all times, and try to goad attacks from one or both in order to create windows of opportunity where both are recovering from attacks and counter-strikes can be made. The best way to achieve victory is to focus damage entirely on one of the Sentinels, as quickly removing one of them from the field will allow players to freely move around the arena and concentrate only on a single foe without worry of being hit from the side or behind by another one.\nKeeping them both in view and managing their attack openings makes it easier to hit them between their slow attacks. All of their attacks deal physical damage, so a 100% physical blocking shield can be useful. Pilgrim Bellclaire is especially helpful with this fight, as she can inflict strong magical damage against them with her spells, provided that the player keeps the Sentinels' attention and allow her to cast uninterrupted.\nRuin Sentinels are very weak to both &lt;a href=\"Strike%20%28Damage%20Type%29\"&gt;Strike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage, so a good &lt;a href=\"Great%20Hammers%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;great hammer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Infusion\"&gt;infused&lt;/a&gt; with Lightning will deal massive amounts of damage, capable of defeating each Sentinel in only three to four hits. It's also recommended to wear the &lt;a href=\"Silvercat%20Ring\"&gt;Silvercat Ring&lt;/a&gt; before entering the fog gate, as it allows players to quickly jump down into the larger arena for more combat space without incurring fall damage.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Castle\"&gt;Drangleic Castle&lt;/a&gt;, the five Ruin Sentinels are far easier to deal with, as the Stone Soldiers can be dealt with at leisure, and the enclosed nature of their rooms allow players to aggro them one at a time. They will aggro only as far as the first part of the hallway into the room, giving players a guaranteed safe zone to retreat and heal. However, bear in mind that the inanimate Stone Soldiers can act as obstacles against movement, and that getting within the line of sight of any of the other Sentinels will immediately aggro them, so tread carefully.\nThe Ruin Sentinels can be &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;parried&lt;/a&gt;, but not riposted nor backstabbed.\nDefenses.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense. -35% strike means taking 135% damage.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 Ruin Sentinel by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic_iEajudgY&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}
{"id": "76545", "revid": "49243392", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=76545", "title": "Ruin Set", "text": "The Ruin Set is a in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAvailability.\nDrops from the five\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ruin%20Sentinels\"&gt;Ruin Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0located just past the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Gate\"&gt;King's Gate&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Castle\"&gt;Drangleic Castle&lt;/a&gt;. Drop rate is low and the enemies are few, meaning the player will likely have to farm to get even a single piece.\nFor maximum efficiency, wearing the &lt;a href=\"Jester%27s%20Cap\"&gt;Jester's Cap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prisoner%27s%20Tatters\"&gt;Prisoner's Tatters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Covetous%20Gold%20Serpent%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Covetous Gold Serpent Ring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Watchdragon%20Parma\"&gt;Watchdragon Parma&lt;/a&gt; and using &lt;a href=\"Rusted%20Coin\"&gt;Rusted Coin&lt;/a&gt;s is advised. As with all respawning enemies, one can join the &lt;a href=\"Company%20of%20Champions\"&gt;Company of Champions&lt;/a&gt; to make the Sentinels respawn indefinitely.\nCharacteristics.\nThe Ruin Set provides a good amount of defence for its &lt;a href=\"weight\"&gt;weight&lt;/a&gt;. Despite being relatively weak to it, even the set's &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; resistance is above average among the heavier medium sets. Additionally, the fully upgraded set's &lt;a href=\"physical\"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; defense is incredibly high relative to its weight.\nHowever, the Ruin Set has a huge weakness to &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bleed&lt;/a&gt;, providing only about half as much bleed resistance as other high-end medium sets, and even being beaten by some of the lighter sets in its category. Due to this, the wearer should use caution around enemies that can cause high bleed build-up, as this will allow them to aggress even more due to the wearer's reduced &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; and movement speed.\nThis overall makes the set quite effective in most situations, should one have the equip load to use it effectively, as well as the time to farm for it.\nRequires &lt;a href=\"Twinkling%20Titanite%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Twinkling Titanite&lt;/a&gt; to upgrade. Each piece can be reinforced up to +5.\nTrivia.\nDue to the character's proportions, the helm will visibly shrink the wearer's head so does not clip through the helm itself. This trait is also shared with the &lt;a href=\"Loyce%20Helm\"&gt;Loyce Helm&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Loyce%20Helm\"&gt;Charred&lt;/a&gt; variant, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Knight%20Helm\"&gt;Silver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight%20Helm\"&gt;Black Knight Helm&lt;/a&gt;s in other games."}

After descending the stairs, take a hard right and walk under the stairs instead of towards the gravestones.\nCharacteristics.\nReturning from \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\", the Ruin Set provides a similar defense spread to its predecessor but exceeds it in several categories as well.\nWhile its physical defenses are somewhat mediocre for its weight, it possesses no major weaknesses and is highly resistant to &lt;a href=\"Slash%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Slash&lt;/a&gt; damage. Similarly, its elemental defenses are somewhat average but here it also lacks any critical weaknesses, with its &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; absorption actually being quite high. It can resist most &lt;a href=\"Negative%20Status%20Effects%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;status effects&lt;/a&gt; quite well, only really possessing a weakness to &lt;a href=\"Frost\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith a good &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt;-to-weight ratio, the Ruin Set is well-suited to wielding large weapons, and its defense spread allows it to effectively combat most weapons it would trade against with ease."}

As well, it consumes twice as much stamina to perform parries as compared to other small shields, and as such this shield is very harsh on the wielder's &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;."}

As well, its &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; allows the wielder to grant a slow heal-over-time buff to all nearby allies for a small amount of &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt;, and, unlike with &lt;a href=\"Gentle%20Prayer\"&gt;Gentle Prayer&lt;/a&gt; chimes, can be un-equipped while retaining the healing buff.\nHowever, it is also one of the weakest Faith catalysts in the game, only reliably beating the &lt;a href=\"White%20Hair%20Talisman\"&gt;White Hair Talisman&lt;/a&gt; and matching strength with the &lt;a href=\"Saint-tree%20Bellvine\"&gt;Saint-tree Bellvine&lt;/a&gt;. This means that any scaling healing miracles will lose a significant fraction of their potency, negating the advantage granted by the larger effect radius.\nTo this end, the Sacred Chime of Filianore finds its niche in casting &lt;a href=\"Pray%20for%20Favor\"&gt;Pray for Favor&lt;/a&gt; to slowly replenish allies' health over time, and in casting non-scaling heal-over-time miracles and buffs, such as &lt;a href=\"Bountiful%20Light\"&gt;Bountiful Light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Oath%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Sacred Oath&lt;/a&gt;, neither of which scale with Faith. Ultimately, the catalyst performs poorly in the hands of a dedicated Faith caster, and instead finds its worth when wielded by a player that invests in low to moderate amounts of Faith for utility purposes.\nUpgrades.\nReinforced with &lt;a href=\"Twinkling%20Titanite%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Twinkling Titanite&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

The flame then burns the target for 9 more instances of damage, each inflicting 0.1 times the Attack Rating of the catalyst as Fire damage. Finally, the flame explodes, knocking the target down and inflicting a critical amount of damage. The standard &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20Flame%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Pyromancy Flame&lt;/a&gt; will inflict 2.3 times the Attack Rating of the catalyst as critical damage, the &lt;a href=\"Pyromancer%27s%20Parting%20Flame\"&gt;Pyromancer's Parting Flame&lt;/a&gt; will inflict 2.5 times the Attack Rating of the catalyst for an increase of 9% in damage over the standard Pyromancy Flame (while not inflicting the bonus &lt;a href=\"Combustion%20%28skill%29\"&gt;Combustion&lt;/a&gt; damage), and the &lt;a href=\"Demon%27s%20Scar\"&gt;Demon's Scar&lt;/a&gt; will inflict 20% more damage for a 2.76 multiplier.

Attempting to hit a valid target but failing due to terrain elevation differences will result in only dealing the initial grab damage.\nHow to obtain.\nIn order to survive the trip inside the lava, there are many strategies that can be followed and even combined before venturing inside. The main idea is to slow down the loss of &lt;a href=\"HP%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the player to heal up and advance a bit further, repeating the process as many times as necessary until they have successfully obtained the item.\nThe following strategies will help mitigate the damage incurred by the lava:\nNotes.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

A weak attack will cast the light beam thrust from &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Lothric%20Light\"&gt;Sacred Lothric Light&lt;/a&gt;, while a strong attack will perform a diagonal upward slash and launch the flame plume from &lt;a href=\"Flame%20of%20Lorian\"&gt;Flame of Lorian&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nSingle Player.\nThis skill grants great versatility to the Twin Princes' Greatsword, allowing the wielder to perform two different attacks with moderate range to catch enemies outside of immediate melee range. As with their originating weapons, performing either of the attacks at melee range can inflict great damage upon a target by hitting them with the physical weapon as well as the elemental projectile.\nOnline.\nBecause it is a greatsword and not an ultra greatsword, the Twin Princes' Greatsword is incapable of launching enemy players skyward like the &lt;a href=\"Stomp%20%28upward%29\"&gt;upward Stomp&lt;/a&gt;, and similarly is incapable of self-buffing. However, it still packs very strong offensive potential and versatility, making it more difficult for other players to fight against."}

A normal attack will perform an upward swing, dealing high stamina damage that can easily break the guard of shields. A strong attack will perform a quick thrust, sending forth a short-ranged beam of light.\nUsage.\nSingle Player.\nThis skill is essentially a modified version of &lt;a href=\"Stance%20%28Straight%20Sword%29\"&gt;Stance&lt;/a&gt;, where the weak attack can perform a guard break against a shield-wielding enemy and the strong attack can be used to attack targets at range. The strong attack can be handy for inflicting heavy damage on a target if they can be hit with both the sword thrust and the light beam.\nOnline.\nSynergizing with the sword's long reach, the strong attack can be handy for catching foes off guard by hitting them when they think they're outside of the wielder's reach. The guard breaking normal attack is just as useful as on other straight swords, capable of easily knocking aside shields for a &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;riposte&lt;/a&gt;."}

The duration scaling of this Miracle depends on Faith and ranges from 40 seconds when this spell is spiced down to 10 Faith all the way up to 65 seconds at 35 Faith where the duration scaling is capped. \nDue to the very high attunement slot requirement, some investment in the &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Attunement&lt;/a&gt; stat or the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Ritual%20Band\"&gt;Southern Ritual Band+2&lt;/a&gt; may be required to use this effectively with other spells.\nBuff Overriding.\nAs with other buffs of similar nature, casting another buff like &lt;a href=\"Great%20Magic%20Barrier%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Great Magic Barrier&lt;/a&gt; will remove the buffs from Sacred Oath, and vice versa, if the player is only buffing themselves with no other allies around. The only workaround with this is if the player was summoned by, or had summoned, another player and they cast a buff on their own; this will cause the buffs to compound with one another, making it ideal for someone to cast a &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Barrier%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;protective&lt;/a&gt; miracle of sorts, and another player follows up with Sacred Oath.\nSacred Oath has a unique interaction when using it in combination with a &lt;a href=\"Brightbugs\"&gt;Brightbug&lt;/a&gt;. Casting Sacred Oath before using a Brightbug will stack the effects of the buffs, while reversing the order and using a Brightbug before casting Sacred oath will only give the effects of Sacred Oath. It seems that the effects of a Brightbug are not overridden by casting Sacred oath.\nAttunement Milestones.\nLike all other spells, the amount of casts per slot increases upon reaching certain &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Attunement&lt;/a&gt; milestones:\nDuration Scaling Information.\nDuration values are listed in seconds. Base duration of this spell only depends on Faith, duration boosting items such as &lt;a href=\"Lingering%20Dragoncrest%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Lingering Dragoncrest&lt;/a&gt; Ring and the &lt;a href=\"Northwarder%20Set\"&gt;Northwarder Set&lt;/a&gt; do not boost the duration of Sacred Oath. This self buff has non-scaling ranges which is why the duration does not go up with each level of Faith. "}

It outstrips the &lt;a href=\"Talisman%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Talisman&lt;/a&gt; shortly after this point to become the strongest talisman up until it reaches the 60 Faith soft-cap. At this point, the only catalyst stronger than it is &lt;a href=\"Yorshka%27s%20Chime\"&gt;Yorshka's Chime&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, it also has only 30 &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt; health when using the &lt;a href=\"Unfaltering%20Prayer\"&gt;Unfaltering Prayer&lt;/a&gt; skill, half that of most other talismans.

As such, when used as the primary catalyst, the Saint-tree Bellvine is only useful for casting Miracles that do not rely on Spell Buff.\nHowever, one useful aspect of the catalyst is that as it only needs to be held in order to maximize the wielder's casting speed, one can wield a more powerful catalyst in the opposite hand and still cast spells at maximum casting speed. This includes &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Staves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20Flames%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Pyromancy Flames&lt;/a&gt;, not simply Chimes or &lt;a href=\"Talismans\"&gt;Talismans&lt;/a&gt;, which makes the Saint-tree Bellvine a powerful tool for any caster, as it is significantly lighter than the &lt;a href=\"Witchtree%20Branch%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Witchtree Branch&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpgrades.\nReinforced with standard .\nNotes.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

Its body is part lion, part goat, and has a long, spiked scorpion tail, in addition to two sets of wings.\nIts red-eyed lion half has white fur and large paws, which it uses to strike its opponent. Its goat legs have a dark purple color and can perform powerful kicks, and it uses its large set of curved horns to ram its opponent. Its four large wings give it the ability to fly for short periods of time and to release powerful blasts of wind, and its scorpion tail has &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;poisonous&lt;/a&gt; properties. In addition to these deadly abilities, the beast can spew &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; projectiles from its mouth.\nLore.\nThe Sanctuary Guardians are an amalgamation of traits from several animals like lions, goats, scorpions and birds. They were created by the sorcerers of &lt;a href=\"Oolacile\"&gt;Oolacile&lt;/a&gt;, capable of manipulating the forces of nature with knowledge and means that not even the sorcerers of &lt;a href=\"Vinheim\"&gt;Vinheim&lt;/a&gt; were able to replicate, to defend the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20Garden\"&gt;Sanctuary Garden&lt;/a&gt; of their country. Although these creatures were not created by the &lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; and therefore cannot be defined as &lt;a href=\"Demon%20%28lore%29\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;, the process with which they were obtained, mixing characteristics of different animals thanks to the sorcery of souls and life, makes them very similar to the demons of chaos, produced by the &lt;a href=\"Flame%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Flame of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; created in imitation of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nThe Sanctuary Guardian has a high &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; resistance, as well as a medium &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; resistance, but is weaker to &lt;a href=\"physical\"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; attacks.\nThe fight is primarily made up of fast physical combos, lightning projectiles thrown in as environmental hazards, and poisonous attacks. Most attacks can be dodged by &lt;a href=\"rolling\"&gt;rolling&lt;/a&gt;, but large stamina depletion will occur if blocking is preferred. The Sanctuary Guardian can easily stunlock and kill low &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; players with its four hit combos. Low &lt;a href=\"Stamina\"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt; or over-encumbered players may have a tough time enduring hit after hit.\nThis boss can be &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;bled&lt;/a&gt;, but up to four successive hits must land.\nIt can be tricky to sever its &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Tail\"&gt;tail&lt;/a&gt;, as only two of its attacks bring its tail within easy reach (&lt;a href=\"%23Head%20Charge\"&gt;Head Charge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%23Swoop\"&gt;Swoop&lt;/a&gt;).\nShould players decide to equip a shield to fight the Sanctuary Guardian, the &lt;a href=\"Eagle%20Shield\"&gt;Eagle Shield&lt;/a&gt; is \"particularly\" well suited for this battle: it combines 95% physical protection (100% before &lt;a href=\"patch\"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt; 1.06) and 75% lightning protection, with great &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt;, all for a moderate &lt;a href=\"weight\"&gt;weight&lt;/a&gt; and low &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; requirement.\nIt is ill-advised to take on this battle with &lt;a href=\"slow%20roll\"&gt;slow roll&lt;/a&gt;: Indeed, the slow roll will \"not\" take the player far enough to dodge the \"&lt;a href=\"%23Wave%20of%20Water\"&gt;Wave of Water&lt;/a&gt;\" attack, which otherwise leaves it wide open for a counterattack. If the player cannot dodge then it is better to &lt;a href=\"stagger\"&gt;stagger&lt;/a&gt; for a short time than to block this attack as blocking drains large amounts of stamina and will leave the player vulnerable to the Sanctuary Guardian's follow-up charge attack, while absorbing the blow will not damage the player and leaves time to block or roll afterwards.\nGuardian Tail.\nTo cut off a tail it's necessary to deal a certain amount of damage against it. The HP of the tail increases with higher &lt;a href=\"NG\"&gt;NG&lt;/a&gt; cycles and is based on the HP of the respective enemy. Its tail has 500 health on NG and 785 on NG+.\nBoss information.\nAttacks.\nWild Fury.\nAttacks rapidly in combos of 2 or 4 with its paws and horns. Two sequential paw or horn attacks is a 2 string attack. A paw attack followed by a horn attack, or vice versa, is a 4 string attack.\nPound.\nAfter rearing on its hind legs, it will proceed to slam its front paws down at the player.\nCharge.\nPerforms a quick charge and then thrusts its head upwards, launching the player into the air if it connects. Its tail will be lowered to the ground for a short time after this attack, providing an opportunity for the player to cut it.\nFlying Charge.\nGallops into the air and the swoops down to attack with its horns. Its tail will be lowered to the ground for a short time after this attack, providing an opportunity for the player to cut it.\nPounce.\nThe Sanctuary Guardian will fly up into the air and pause before launching straight at the player with lightning speed. If avoided it will be vulnerable to attack for a short time, however if the attack hits it will instead somersault backwards through the air landing far away from the player.\nWind Blast.\nIts wings are used to project a wave of water and wind in front of it. If blocked it will consume a huge amount of stamina, or outright break the block of shields without very high stability. If the player can not roll out of the way it is better to take the hit rather than attempt to block.\nWill occasionally follow up with a Charge attack if player stays in front of it.\nLightning Shot.\nLowers its head to charge, then releases a large ball of lightning at the target. Has an identical telegraph to Lightning Repeater.\nLightning Repeater.\nFires four lightning projectiles in moderately quick succession. Can be avoided by strafing to either side. Has an identical telegraph to Lightning Shot.\nLightning Strafe.\nStrafes around the target whilst flying, firing a heavy lightning projectile.\nLightning Overhead.\nFlies over the target, releasing a heavy lightning ball at the end of its flight. Can be effectively dodged by rolling backwards after the guardian has passed over the player.\nTail Sweep.\nSweeps its tail from right to left, causing medium poison &lt;a href=\"buildup\"&gt;buildup&lt;/a&gt;.\nTail Spin.\nIt will spin slightly above ground in 360 degrees, sweeping with its tail, causing heavy poison buildup.\nHind Kick.\nThe Sanctuary Guardian will kick with its hind legs if the player is too close to its rear.\nRetreat.\nThe Guardian will fly backwards far away from the player, causing them to lose target lock.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls \u2014 Sanctuary Guardian by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZV560JcJCw&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

Nearby, and sometimes hidden, there are large statues emanating a red aura. Destroying these statues returns the knight's color and makes them permanently vulnerable, even if the player dies or rests at a &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey are, however, vulnerable to diverse elements. If the player attacks with an elemental weapon, they can be damaged. The damage dealt will be minimal compared to if their statues were destroyed, but may be enough for removing certain knights positioned in strategic locations.\nStrategy.\nSanctum Knights are difficult without assistance, as they are aggressive from larger distances than most other foes. They have an impressive amount of poise and health points, even after they are rendered vulnerable. They fight with &lt;a href=\"Power%20Stance\"&gt;power stanced&lt;/a&gt; falchions and are capable of swift strikes to close in on the player. When the player is far away, certain knights will pull out two crossbows which are capable of dealing &lt;a href=\"Physical%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; damage.\nUnlike most enemies that will charge the player outright, the Sanctum Knights will usually pace into medium range. They will then hunker down and charge with a power stanced falchion strike. However, they are prone to cumbersome strikes and are slow to turn, allowing to be &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;bed with little trouble. Most problems arise because there are often two knights on the player, and they will follow the player for some distance if they try to escape.\nIf the player opts to fight a Sanctum Knight while in spirit form, a good strategy is to bring a &lt;a href=\"Greatshields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;greatshield&lt;/a&gt; with good &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt; and which provides 100% &lt;a href=\"Physical%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; defense (like the &lt;a href=\"Havel%27s%20Greatshield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Havel's Greatshield&lt;/a&gt;), and also an element-infused weapon that can deal &lt;a href=\"Strike%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Strike&lt;/a&gt; damage (e.g.: &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Demon%27s%20Great%20Hammer%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Demon's Great Hammer+5&lt;/a&gt;). The Sanctum Knight will stagger every time he hits the shield, giving the player a chance to score a free hit.

{"id": "84029", "revid": "49243392", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=84029", "title": "Sanctum Shield", "text": "The Sanctum Shield is a &lt;a href=\"Small%20Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;small shield&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nCharacteristics.\nThe Sanctum Shield is incredibly unique amongst all of the weapons in the game, in that aside from being a small shield, it also functions as a catalyst that can cast sorceries, miracles, AND hexes. This makes it one of the most versatile weapons in the game, which allows players to cast 3 different types of spells without the need to equip 2 or 3 different catalysts that cater to those spell types. And because it has the weight of a small shield, weighing in only at 2.5 units, this further eliminates the need to equip other catalysts which can take up unnecessary weight, and so is extremely useful for players who might need to bring with them weapon buffs like &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Weapon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Magic Weapon&lt;/a&gt; or utility spells like &lt;a href=\"Heal%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon upgrading it (upgrades with regular &lt;a href=\"Titanite%20Shard%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;titanite&lt;/a&gt;, up to +10), the stability, defenses, and damage output are all increased. going as far as 88.7% physical damage reduction and 48 &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt;. The scaling, however, does not improve at all, and players will need hefty investments in both intelligence and faith to make use of the broadly spread-out scaling.\nOne should note that this weapon does \"not\" deal any form of physical damage, but rather it features magic, lightning and dark damage. This makes it a very useful offense weapon against enemies that have low elemental resistances, as the damage from these 3 types will stack on top of one another. While players might attempt to raise their elemental defense, it is impossible to block 100% of all three damage types at once. If they do manage to block 100% of one of the shield's damage types, the other 2 types will punch through.\nThis weapon however, has two big downsides. Firstly, small shields are the usual go-to by players when they want to parry enemies, but you cannot parry with this shield because the heavy attack button (which normally functions as the \"parry\" button when using shields) instead activates the shield's special ability, which is casting spells. Secondly, being a catalyst, it has overall low scaling on its elements, nor does the scaling improve when you fully upgrade the shield, and it also has a slow casting speed. While you still can use offensive spells with it, their effectiveness is drastically reduced. As such, it is more useful instead when casting other types of spells:"}

Even with their condition, they continue to defend &lt;a href=\"Shulva%2C%20Sanctum%20City\"&gt;Shulva city&lt;/a&gt; from any invader who dares to set foot in.\nDescription.\nThey wear corroded and decaying armor that resembles the &lt;a href=\"Insolent%20Set\"&gt;Insolent Set&lt;/a&gt; in many ways. They are typically very aggressive and sometimes pretend to be dead to ambush the &lt;a href=\"Bearer%20of%20the%20Curse\"&gt;Bearer of the Curse&lt;/a&gt; as they explore the city.\nStrategy.\nMelee (great hammer).\nVery aggressive, these variants charge the player and attack with slow, overhead swings or right-to-left sweeps. They will also perform a leap attack if far enough away. The &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20Mace\"&gt;Sanctum Mace&lt;/a&gt; they wield does high &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poise damage&lt;/a&gt; and causes &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; build-up. There are also a few, later in the level, that has a poison aura much like the secondary effect on the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Butterfly%20Set\"&gt;Moon Butterfly Set&lt;/a&gt;.\nMelee (longsword).\nLess aggressive than their mace-wielding counterparts, these soldiers tend to time out their attacks and perform sweeping combos. They also cause poison buildup with their attacks.\nMelee (lance and shield).\nThese soldiers are the most defensive of the bunch, preferring to turtle behind their &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20Shield\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; and attack with standard, lance-type attack set. They can easily stun-lock with the charge attack and deal significant damage due to the multiple hits it can deliver. They will also sometimes perform a shield bash, though doing so leaves them open to a backstab. Like all soldiers, their attacks cause poison buildup.\nRanged (longbow).\nThis variant attacks at range, usually in groups, with a longbow and poison arrows. They are very accurate and will often land headshots, causing the player to stagger and open them up to being hit by the melee units that often accompany the archers. When engaged in melee, they draw a longsword and adopt the Melee (Longsword) attack patterns. They will switch back to the bow if the player moves far enough away."}

However, it does slowly regenerate the player's &lt;a href=\"HP\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; over time, granting limitless healing. The rate is very slow at 2 HP every 2 seconds, so its practical use in the middle of battle is limited, but patient players can greatly benefit from Sanctus' effects when out of combat.\u00a0\nThe shield has medium deflection and normal &lt;a href=\"parry\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt; speed.

Its attacks are fast with very short delays, but this is countered by having rather short range, requiring the wielder to get in close with the enemy. These characteristics help the Scimitar to define the \"light curved sword\" moveset that it shares with its lighter brethren.\nThe drawback of the Scimitar is that while it can chain together numerous small attacks, it lacks the heavier punch required to prevail against armored foes. Its strong attacks are simply chains of weak attacks, as is its &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;. As well, it does not possess a kick, but rather a quick slash that can be used to create distance from a foe; this prevents the weapon from being used to break the guard of a shield.\nHowever, complementing its light and fast nature, is that it possesses a usable off-hand moveset that allows it and other light curved swords to be wielded in the off-hand for unusual combinations. The off-hand weak attack mirrors that of the main-hand one-handed weak attacks, allowing for the use of a heavier weapon in the main hand to bring both fast and slow attacks to bear on opponents. The off-hand strong attack causes the wielder to perform a parry, with similar startup and active frames as a &lt;a href=\"Medium%20Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;medium shield&lt;/a&gt;, further increasing its offensive potential.\nThe Scimitar takes remarkably well to &lt;a href=\"Infusion%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Infusions&lt;/a&gt;, gaining immense &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt; when infused &lt;a href=\"Sharp%20Gem\"&gt;Sharp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Gem\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Gem\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpgrades.\nReinforced with ."}

When the player enters the boss room, only her torso is visible until after she is approached or hit. She will then burst out of the sand to reveal the rest of her scorpion body.\nLore.\nNajka and her betrothed, &lt;a href=\"Manscorpion%20Tark\"&gt;Manscorpion Tark&lt;/a&gt;, were created long ago by an unnamed master who has long since disappeared. It is implied that the two were experiments, similar to &lt;a href=\"The%20Duke%27s%20Dear%20Freja\"&gt;The Duke's Dear Freja&lt;/a&gt;, and that their creator was either &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Tseldora\"&gt;Duke Tseldora&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;Seath the Scaleless&lt;/a&gt; himself. Najka and Tark are the only two of their kind that speak the human tongue, though a ring is required to understand them.\nThe two were once a peaceful couple living a quiet existence in the Shaded Ruins. But as time passed, Najka slowly began losing her mind and became more and more violent and unreasonable as a result. A war began between Tark and Najka, and has been waged for many years before the player's arrival.\nSummoning.\nThe player is able to summon &lt;a href=\"Manscorpion%20Tark\"&gt;Manscorpion Tark&lt;/a&gt; if the player has used the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Whispers\"&gt;Ring of Whispers&lt;/a&gt; to speak with him and exhaust his dialogue. His sign is on the ground directly outside her fog gate.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Scholar%20of%20the%20First%20Sin\"&gt;Scholar of the First Sin&lt;/a&gt;, the summon sign for &lt;a href=\"Bradley%20of%20the%20Old%20Guard\"&gt;Bradley of the Old Guard&lt;/a&gt; is available beneath the arch at the bottom of the path leading up to the boss arena.\nFight overview.\nScorpioness Najka uses both physical and magic damage. At the start of the fight she will blast a bolt of magic upon entering the room, afterwards she will emerge from the ground, revealing her full scorpion body. She is able to use a sort of &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Soul%20Arrow\"&gt;Homing Soul Arrow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Soulmass%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Homing Soulmass&lt;/a&gt;. She normally engages her magic attacks when the player has retained some distance from her for an amount of time. As for physical attacks, she will strike the player with her pincers resulting in a two-hit combo, or strike with her staff, which normally comes in the form of a thrust followed by a swipe. She will also try to stab the player with her stingers, one where she launches both of them into the ground at once (if the player evades this attack she will take some time to recover, though damage done during her recovery stage is reduced), another where she launches one stinger into the ground at a time. Her stinger attacks result in two things: one that pins the player to the ground and another that picks the player up and infects them with &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Toxic&lt;/a&gt;. After a certain amount of time, she will burrow into the ground and move around in an attempt to get underneath the player and knock them off their feet as she jumps out. If the player lingers behind her for too long she will slam her tails down dealing large amounts of damage.\nStrategy.\nWhat the player wants to do is stick to her side and get damage in as she is recovering from an attack. Players may also attack from the front, but will require a high &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt; shield and the ability to dodge quickly. Her &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Soul%20Arrow\"&gt;Homing Soul Arrow&lt;/a&gt; can be easily dodged, the &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Soulmass%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Homing Soulmass&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0being more difficult. The best time to aim for damage is while she is casting her Homing Soulmass. She takes a little bit of time to cast and a little bit more time after that for them to fire. Players can dodge the Homing Soulmass by moving in one direction around her. Both spells can be dodged by getting some distance away from the Scorpioness and then sprinting to the left or right. The\u00a0Arrows are dodged easily, as she does not close the distance before launching them. The Soulmass can be dodged the same way, provided that players can keep a half-dozen or so meters from her, as they are rather fast. Another alternative is to hide behind any of the dead tree logs scattered throughout the arena.\nAfter a certain amount of time, Scorpioness Najka will dive underground and move around the room. Players can spot where she is by the little puffs of sand that trail the ground. If she is traveling under the player or close to the player, they will be slowed. The player should wait for the moment to dodge her as she jumps out. Alternatively, there are two chunks of ruined stone resembling a sort of platform in the sand. The player can stand on this to avoid the attack entirely, as she cannot surface through it. Remaining on the stone for a while will tire the Scorpioness and cause her to emerge from the sand, providing ample time to land a hit or two. If using the stones to avoid her jumping out from the ground, she will come up through the sand at exactly the same spot for that stone every time, allowing players to orient themselves properly to land heavy hits. A corpse holding an item (&lt;a href=\"Flame%20Butterfly\"&gt;Flame Butterfly&lt;/a&gt;) can be spotted hanging on top of a dead tree on the left side of the arena. To obtain it, the player may risk luring Najka jumping out of the sand on that spot to destroy the log and get the item.\nHer stingers may be cut off if the player so desires. The best method is to conserve a medium distance between Najka and the player to bait her into performing her &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Toxic&lt;/a&gt;-inducing stings into the ground and attack them until they fall off.\nManscorpion Tark will occupy most of her time until he is dead if summoned, which can be used as an advantage.\nAttacks.\nPincers: Will strike the player using her pincers, one at a time.\nStaff Strike: Thrusts her staff at the player and follows it up with a swipe.\nStingers: Launches one stinger at a time into the ground, hitting different points on the ground. A different variation is when she launches both of them into the ground at once; if evaded, any attacks done while she is cooling down will be reduced.\nBurrow: During the fight she will burrows into the ground and attempt to strike the player from underground. Her movements can be traced by the smalls patches of dust clouds that appear. This move can be used to knock the item that is in the room, hanging off a tree branch. Can be evaded by staying on the wooden planks found in the arena.\nHoming Crystal Soulmass: When the player has some distance between her, she will activate five bolts of &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Soulmass%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Homing Soulmass&lt;/a&gt; to hover above her and when the player gets close she will launch three of them at once, then fire the other 2 afterwards if the player is still within her range.\nSoul Spear: This attack is executed while she is half burrowed, which only happens at the start of the fight. Upon the player entering the boss room, she will fire a Soul Spear at the player, has slight homing capabilities.\nStinger Swipe: While the player lingers around the side of her double stingers she will swipe them in the direction of the player. To safely dodge this move, move to her front and the attack will completely miss.\nStinger Slam: If the player is behind her for a while she will slam both stingers into the ground at once.\nDefenses.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense.\n-35% thrust means taking 135% damage.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 Scorpioness Najka by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ69Xa9PTzg&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

He has a smooth torso that is quite humanoid and in place of legs he has several tentacle-like tendrils. He has six blue-violet wings and has long appendices extending from his head.\nLore.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeath is a descendant of the primordial &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;archdragons&lt;/a&gt; who inhabited the world when, before the appearance of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, every element of the world was composed only of grey rocks.\nHowever, due to the \"Disparity\" that appeared following the ignition of the First Flame, Seath was born with unique characteristics compared to the original archdragons as he didn't possess the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Scale\"&gt;rock scales&lt;/a&gt; that made his peers immortal. In addition, Seath's pale and deformed body was infused with the magical power of moonlight that he managed to study, using this form of magic to create &lt;a href=\"Old%20Moonlight\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; that catalyzed it.\nAt some point, the &lt;a href=\"Lords\"&gt;Four Lords&lt;/a&gt; who had found immense &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Soul\"&gt;Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt;s and built their civilizations underground, emerged to the surface with the intention of waging war against the Dragons and conquering the world for themselves. Seath thus decided to betray his race and abandon it to ally with &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; and help the Lords in their war, pillaging the Dragons of their sacred treasure: the \"Primordial Crystal. After a long struggle Gwyn and the Lords eventually emerged victorious, exterminating most of the archdragons and conquering the surface world, thus beginning the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Age of Fire&lt;/a&gt; defined by Gwyn's power and vision. \nThrough their successful alliance against the Everlasting Dragons, Seath became a sworn friend to the Lord of Sunlight and was amply rewarded for his indispensable contributions to the war. He was gifted one of the women of Gwyn's family in marriage, making Seath his relative, and ushering in the White Dragon's acceptance to the nobility of the &lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;Gods&lt;/a&gt; by bestowing upon him the honorific of \"Duke\". After earning this title, Gwyn further gifted Seath a &lt;a href=\"Bequeathed%20Lord%20Soul%20Shard\"&gt;fragment of his powerful Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt;. And finally, Seath was rewarded with the &lt;a href=\"The%20Duke%27s%20Archives\"&gt;Royal Archives&lt;/a&gt;, an enormous library towering above Anor Londo, which contained all the knowledge available to the city of the gods, leaving the betrayer the freedom to do his own research.\nSeath eventually even had a daughter with one of the women of Gwyn's family to whom he was married: &lt;a href=\"Shira%2C%20Knight%20of%20Filianore\"&gt;Shira&lt;/a&gt;, who became close to &lt;a href=\"Filianore\"&gt;Filianore&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord's last daughter. However the pale dragon had little interest in matters of politics or pleasure and immersed himself in research of the scales of immortality that the ancient dragons possessed but he lacked. His Archives became a magnificent pool of tomes and knowledge as the fruits of Seath's superior wisdom and unsound fixation over archiving the true immortality that was denied to him at birth.\nSeath's research thus focuses on &lt;a href=\"Soul\"&gt;Soul&lt;/a&gt;s and, by learning to manipulate them, the pale dragon became the founder of &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;sorcery&lt;/a&gt;, the art that allows to control souls and use them for any purpose. However, Seath, in possession of the powerful Primordial Crystal stolen from his race, noticed the peculiar connection between crystals and souls and the way in which this element could be used to best catalyze their power, as crystals represented an ideal medium to create a bond between an object and souls. The revelation was the beginning of Seath's obsession with crystals. The pale dragon began to experiment with these in all sorts of ways. He managed to create a &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Ember\"&gt;Crystal Ember&lt;/a&gt; capable of infusing weapons with the power of the crystals and passed this knowledge on to the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Blacksmith\"&gt;Giant Blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; of the gods.. The &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Cave\"&gt;Crystal Cave&lt;/a&gt; of the Archive's inner gardens in which his Primordial Crystal was kept began to fill with crystals and new creatures resulting from the experiments of the pale dragon who created &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Golem\"&gt;Crystal Golem&lt;/a&gt;s animated with the powers of souls and infused &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Crystal%20Soldier\"&gt;Undead Soldiers&lt;/a&gt; with crystals too. He even created the soul of the &lt;a href=\"Moonlight%20Butterfly\"&gt;Moonlight Butterflies&lt;/a&gt;, mystical creatures naturally infused with a pure and powerful crystal power and moonlight magic, Seath's own characteristics, which are capable of emitting crystal sorceries and moonlight energy.\nAs a nobleman on par of the gods, Seath also had personal servants like them and he employed his &lt;a href=\"Channeler\"&gt;Channeler&lt;/a&gt;s, trained sorcerers that became his hands, feet and even eyes in order to reach and see what the dragon could not and help him in his researches.\nMore and more absorbed in his work Seath even managed to crystallize his own magical power of moonlight, creating a &lt;a href=\"Moonlight%20Greatsword%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; that catalyzed it. At the culmination of his quest Seath was finally able to achieve what he had always sought: immortality through the Primordial Crystal. By connecting his body and soul to the powerful crystal, the pale dragon gained a true insulation from death, as that no mortal blow could affect him and his wounds would close promptly as long as the crystal was intact. His very breath became a powerful crystal breath with the terrifying power of a killing curse. .\nOver time Seath became increasingly lonely and this also eroded his sanity. Despite the fact that he was at the pinnacle of the world together with the very gods he still sought the immortality that he was born lacking and started to envy, resent and eventually hate others. This lead him to increasingly twisted experiments that toyed with life itself. The achievement of his goal of immortality through crystals, at least partially, did nothing but worsen Seath's condition who had now been driven to madness by his own researches. At some point, outside of marriage, Seath generated &lt;a href=\"Crossbreed%20Priscilla\"&gt;Priscilla&lt;/a&gt; as a crossbreed of the pale dragon and a human woman. This new creature was feared by the other gods and treated as an abomination due to her &lt;a href=\"Lifehunt%20Scythe\"&gt;Lifehunt&lt;/a&gt; powers and unnatural origin. Eventually she was drawn away to the cold and lonely &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariamis\"&gt;Painted World of Ariamis&lt;/a&gt;, trapped within a great canvas.. After this, Seath began to experiment directly on human beings to transform them into monstrous creatures with draconic features, initially obtaining &lt;a href=\"Serpent%20Soldier\"&gt;snake-men&lt;/a&gt;, bestial beings with a snake's head and a body covered in scales. As a consequence the Archives, once filled with precious books became a prison for his horrible twisted experiments and the snake-men, who did not value knowledge, became their jailers building chaotic prisons in improvisation. His &lt;a href=\"Channeler\"&gt;Channeler&lt;/a&gt;s, remaining faithful to his service even after Seath's fall into madness, continued to travel to various places for their master to kidnap subjects for his experiments.\nAt some point after Gwyn linked the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Nameless%20King\"&gt;Gwyn's firstborn son&lt;/a&gt; was dethroned and exiled , nearly all of the other deities abandoned Anor Londo and moved to an unknown location but Seath remained in his Archives, now completely estranged from the world and obsessed with his research.\nIn his madness he even kidnapped the holy maidens of &lt;a href=\"Gwynevere%2C%20Princess%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Gwynevere&lt;/a&gt;, to experiment on them and transform them into failed snake-like creatures called &lt;a href=\"Pisaca\"&gt;Pisaca&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, although &lt;a href=\"Gwyndolin\"&gt;Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt;, as the last remaining deity in Anor Londo, did not kill him for his actions, Seath was confined to his Archives, declared a forbidden area where no one was able to approach it due to a divine magical barrier.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt; was able to ring the &lt;a href=\"Bells%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Bells of Awakening&lt;/a&gt;, overcome the challenges of &lt;a href=\"Sen%27s%20Fortress\"&gt;Sen's Fortress&lt;/a&gt; and reach &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; thus being rewarded with the &lt;a href=\"Lordvessel\"&gt;Lordvessel&lt;/a&gt;, they would be guided by &lt;a href=\"Kingseeker%20Frampt\"&gt;Kingseeker Frampt&lt;/a&gt; to find immense souls to fill the receptacle and link the fading &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; to succeed Gwyn in his sacrifice. The Undead would thus reach the &lt;a href=\"The%20Duke%27s%20Archives\"&gt;Archives of Seath&lt;/a&gt; however, they were defeated by the immortal dragon and imprisoned in his prison. Managing to escape, the Undead would cross the dangerous Archives and reach the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Cave\"&gt;Crystal Cave&lt;/a&gt; where the Primordial Crystal was kept and that guaranteed the protection of the pale dragon. Once the crystal was destroyed, Seath would fall into the cave, challenging them but ending up killed to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Bequeathed%20Lord%20Soul%20Shard\"&gt;fragmented of the Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt; that Gwyn had granted him .\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the region and times of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt;, Seath's name had, like the other Lords, largely been forgotten. However the legend of a \"pale dragon\" remained told in various locales even if each account was fragmentary. His &lt;a href=\"Moonlight%20Greatsword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Moonlight Sword&lt;/a&gt; that shone like the brilliant rays of the moon and was born from his white being has become a thing of the oldest legends that are rarely spoken of. The smithing techniques of Seath that used souls to create artifacts were preserved by a clan of &lt;a href=\"Crow%20Demon\"&gt;Crow Demon&lt;/a&gt;s who managed to escape the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariamis\"&gt;Painted World of Ariamis&lt;/a&gt;, though over time they too lost knowledge of him, remembering the dragons only as a white grotesque being that existed in the distant past.. \nDespite the death of their creator, multiple &lt;a href=\"Moonlight%20Butterfly\"&gt;moon butterflies&lt;/a&gt; survived over the centuries, migrating to &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; and mutating into lesser &lt;a href=\"Great%20Moth\"&gt;Great Moth&lt;/a&gt;s and developing poisoning abilities. Despite this, they remained rare and mysterious creatures that appear only on full-moon nights in winter and whose larvae have never once been spotted. Additionally, other of Seath's creations survived the centuries and reached Drangleic. &lt;a href=\"Manscorpion%20Tark\"&gt;Manscorpion Tark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scorpioness%20Najka\"&gt;Scorpioness Najka&lt;/a&gt; are in fact another of Seath's many experiments on humans and the pale dragon, in addition to having fused their bodies with enormous scorpions, has cursed their souls togetherDespite their condition the two were well aware of being the product of Seath's madness and his obsessive attempt to achieve immortality.\nDespite the fact that the Primordial Crystal had been destroyed and Seath killed by a &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt;, the structures of the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Cave\"&gt;Crystal Cave&lt;/a&gt; managed to resist and drifted to settle underground in the south of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; and the power of the white dragon lingered as a radiance inside the crystals. The crystals infused with souls of Seath became known as \"Brighstones\" and the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Olaphis\"&gt;Olaphis&lt;/a&gt; mined these gems, refining and polishing them and their different powers for use as amplifiers for their sorceries with &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dispelling%20Ring\"&gt;rings&lt;/a&gt;. \nCenturies after the fall of the kingdom of Olaphis, the territory of the Brighstone mines came under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Brightstone%20Cove%20Tseldora\"&gt;Duchy of Tseldora&lt;/a&gt;. Under the reign of &lt;a href=\"Vendrick\"&gt;Vendrick&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Tseldora\"&gt;Duke of Tseldora&lt;/a&gt; rediscovered the precious crystals and, starting to extract and sell them again, made a fortune with brighstone. The citizens of Tseldora flourished thanks to the immense riches that the gem trade brought them and began to accumulate luxury and knowledge of witchcraft. The bewitching radiance of the crystals and the power of Seath that still permeated them began to influence the inhabitants who were captured by a desire that wasn\u2019t satisfied no matter how much prosperity they acquired and they always searched for what they lacked\nAn immense amount of time after his &lt;a href=\"Bequeathed%20Lord%20Soul%20Shard\"&gt;fragment of Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt; some &lt;a href=\"Old%20Paledrake%20Soul\"&gt;remnants of his soul&lt;/a&gt; manifested again in Drangleic, continuing to exert their influence on the region. This portion of Seath's will eventually remanifested and possessed a mere &lt;a href=\"The%20Duke%27s%20Dear%20Freja\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;. Despite his shape and condition, his obsession led him to search for what he wanted. At some point in time this small spider found its way deep inside the mines of Tseldora, since they were the old crystal cave of Seath and where the corpse of an ancient archdragon was found, preserved underground as it had returned to stone and made it into its lair.\nThe Duke of Tseldora, continuing to mine the brighstone in depth, discovered the stone body of the archdragon and the spider possessed by Seath who had transformed the cave into his lair. He eventually built his hidden chamber among the ruins deep within the mines, amassing a large library and conducting researches on sorcery. Since he was an oddball who loved and was fascinated by spiders, the Duke eventually found the one possessed by Seath and decided to take it in as his pet, naming it \"Freja\" and locking it in a cage in the library where he led his studies. At a certain point, however, \"Freja\" escaped from her cage and the numerous &lt;a href=\"Parasite%20Spider\"&gt;Parasite Spider&lt;/a&gt;s of its lair began to swarm the town of Tseldora, overrunning it and taking control of the bodies of their inhabitants as their hosts while the Duke, now completely mad, simply remained to gaze at their infestation with satisfaction. The spider haunted by Seath thus returned to the depths of the mines next to the petrified body of the ancient dragon and began to accumulate the souls gathered in the lands of Tseldora, absorbing them from people until they grew immensely.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the region and times of &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt; Seath was still widely considered the \"pale dragon\" of legends even by the sorcerers of &lt;a href=\"Vinheim\"&gt;Vinheim&lt;/a&gt; and his crystal sorceries had been lost.\nHowever, Seath's legacy had not been forgotten completely as the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Sage\"&gt;Crystal Sage&lt;/a&gt;s, two twin scholars that considered themselves as spiritual successors of the legendary &lt;a href=\"Big%20Hat%20Logan\"&gt;grand sage Logan&lt;/a&gt;, were able to gain possession of the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Scroll\"&gt;Crystal Scroll&lt;/a&gt; containing the sorceries and research of the pale dragon which lead to Logan's records of Crystal Sorcery. The two sages thus were able to carry on this branch of sorcery allowing them to replicate Logan's discoveries that utilize the power of crystals to their fullest as a medium for souls thanks to his \"enlightments\" in the Regal Archives of Seath.\nAt some point the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Sage\"&gt;Crystal Sage&lt;/a&gt;s reached Lothric and became the spiritual guides of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives%20Scholar\"&gt;scholars&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt;. The Crystal Sages introduced to Lothric not only &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Gem\"&gt;crystal gems&lt;/a&gt; but also the heretical belief in the pale dragon Seath and his mad knowledge. The sages would thus continue to work on their research within the Grand Archives, even taking &lt;a href=\"Daughter%20of%20Crystal%20Kriemhild\"&gt;Daughter of Crystal Kriemhild&lt;/a&gt; as their pupil and crafting &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Sage%27s%20Rapier\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sage%27s%20Crystal%20Staff\"&gt;casting tools&lt;/a&gt; that used the power of crystals to enhance their magical power, representing how the fruits of the lifetime of research had advanced to an impressive level and still followed the works of the pale dragon. Over time, the scholars of Lothric had accumulated an immense amount of knowledge and the grand Archives became an enormous structure containing an equal amount of books. However, the knowledge contained in the tomes not only represented a danger to their sanity, implying that they had come into contact with particularly &lt;a href=\"Big%20Hat%20Logan\"&gt;profound research into the nature of the soul&lt;/a&gt; that led their anchor to reason to be washed away, but the books were literally &lt;a href=\"Clawed%20Curse\"&gt;cursed&lt;/a&gt;, releasing ghostly and pale limbs towards those who reached them.\nIn the last years of Lothric's kingdom, &lt;a href=\"Oceiros%2C%20the%20Consumed%20King\"&gt;King Oceiros&lt;/a&gt; became fascinated by dragons in the search for a solution to the problem of finding a worthy Champion to link the fading &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; after his son, &lt;a href=\"Lothric%2C%20Younger%20Prince\"&gt;Prince Lothric&lt;/a&gt;, that was designated to become a &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;, sacrificing himself and link the Flame was not strong enough to do it. Eventually Ocerios turned to the cursed knowledge of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt;. Here he found the heretical faith in the white dragon Seath introduced by the Crystal Sages and became so absorbed in it that he wore a &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Ring\"&gt;ring with a dragon scale&lt;/a&gt; and had his army use &lt;a href=\"Wooden%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; decorated with a \"white dragon\" while giving his royal guard &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Stoneplate%20Ring\"&gt;magic rings&lt;/a&gt; that enhanced sorcery and he, now lost in his madness became known as the \"sorcerer king\". Continuing to study the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Scroll\"&gt;sorceries and knowledge&lt;/a&gt; contained in the Archives and brought by the Crystal Sages to Lothric, Oceiros found himself walking the same path as &lt;a href=\"Big%20Hat%20Logan\"&gt;Big Hat Logan&lt;/a&gt;, reaching the same level of \"enlightenment\" as him and then going completely mad. The king, in his deep delusions, believed he had to become a dragon himself in order to produce an heir strong enough to link the Flame. His mad plans would found support from &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Sulyvahn\"&gt;Pontiff Sulyvahn&lt;/a&gt;, who began experimenting with transforming humans into pale dragons. Despite the large number of &lt;a href=\"Wretch\"&gt;failures and abominations&lt;/a&gt; that presented only a faded fragment of the dragons' strength, the experiments were eventually successful and Oceiros managed to transform himself into a scaleless dragon resembling Seath, albeit an imperfect and distorted one, even obtaining the &lt;a href=\"White%20Dragon%20Breath%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;sorcery of Seath's crystal breath&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategies.\nWhen first encountered in The Duke's Archives, he regenerates health extremely quickly due to the power of Primordial Crystal, effectively making him invincible.. He inevitably kills the player. Loss of &lt;a href=\"Soul%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Humanity%20%28gameplay%20mechanic%29\"&gt;humanity&lt;/a&gt; can be avoided by wearing a &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Sacrifice\"&gt;Ring of Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt;, but if he kills the player through &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt;, then a &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Ring%20of%20Sacrifice\"&gt;Rare Ring of Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt; is needed to avoid penalties. In addition, it is possible to travel back through the fog door to avoid being killed by Seath, however can still go through the fog wall after exiting. Regardless, the player must be killed by Seath in order to progress.\nUpon encountering him again within the Crystal Cave, he will be fought within an arena that contains the Primordial Crystal. In order to defeat Seath, it is necessary to destroy the Primordial Crystal so that any damage dealt to him is not immediately healed. The crystal will respawn if the player dies or leaves the fight, making it necessary to destroy it in each attempt to defeat Seath.\nStaying at his side makes it easier to stay out of the area-of-effect of his breath attacks, and he won't be able to hit with his claws or tail as easily. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DDI022PgUq38%257CVideo\"&gt;Video&lt;/a&gt;\nIt is also possible to use only a bow against Seath with great success. Get a good distance away from him and it is possible to get 4-5 shots in before he gets too close. The only real danger in this strategy is when running past Seath to gain some distance.\nHis only long range specific attack is the far curse beam. That means if players stay at a distance, one can lure him to fire the beam and charge his defenseless body.\nCrystal curse explosion triggers when the player cannot be reached by any of Seath's other attacks; usually when situated behind Seath with the tails just out of reach. One strategy is to begin sprinting a good distance away from him once he arches forward to charge a ball of magic. A second approach would be to develop a high enough curse resistance and block some of the erupting crystals. Immediately heal the damage received before he executes his tail swipes/slams.\nBeing the grandfather of Sorcery, Seath is extremely resistant to &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; damage, so it would be wise to try to use a different element when combating him.\nWhen trying to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Moonlight%20Greatsword%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Moonlight Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; it is best to attack the tip of the tail, as the area around midway through the tail is considered his body. Thus dealing damage to this area will not help in acquiring the Moonlight Greatsword.\nA good strategy for acquiring it is when Seath himself breaks the Primordial Crystal. Wait behind the crystal until Seath starts to rear up his head for any of the Curse Beam attacks. Just before he fires it, start sprinting left or right around the sides and towards his tail. Seath will break the crystal and stun himself, giving the player ample opportunity to attack his tail three to four times. Make sure Seath's tail isn't clipping in the wall before trying.\nIt should be noted that Seath takes extra damage if hit in his belly. As an example, when hit with standard 1H fast attack Man-serpent Greatsword +15 in of his tentacles at STR 40, Seath takes 226 damage. And if hit in his belly by the same attack, he will take about 450 damage. If the character is tanky enough and has enough &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt; resistance, he can stay right at Seath's belly and hit him without pausing until Seath dies, using his Estus Flask only one or two times.\nMoonlight Greatsword.\nTo cut off a tail it's necessary to deal a certain amount of damage against it. The HP of the tail increases with higher NG cycles and is based on the HP of the respective enemy. Seath's tail has 825 health on Ng and 1,295 on NG+.\nBoss information.\nAttacks.\nClose Curse Beam.\nThe first of Seath's Curse Beams: Seath will fire a beam from his mouth in a circular arc close to his body, and crystals will erupt from the ground around where the beam touched.\nBreath Crystal.\nThe crystals that erupts form the ground after each Curse Beam attack, they are unblockable and deal continuous damage, as well as curse build up.\nCrystal Curse Explosion.\nSeath's most dangerous attack: he will begin charging briefly, and will then erupt crystals from his body in all directions. This crystal eruption is even more damaging than the others and, of course, much harder to evade. The only way to avoid it is to get quite far away from Seath's body, out of range of the eruption.\nTail Thrash.\nSeath will attack with his tails if the player stays near one of his three tails for too long. There are two variations of this attack, one where Seath repeatedly slams his tails onto the ground, and the other where he sweeps them. These can hit multiple times, stunlocking the player. This attack has considerable range, but it can be reduced by cutting off Seath's tail.\nFar Cursebeam.\nThe same effect as the Close Curse Beam, except this is fired in a circular arc further away from Seath's body.\nStraight Cursebeam.\nThe last of the different Curse Beam types, Seath fires a beam in a straight line from the base of his body to the end of the room, in the direction the player is standing.\nLeft or Right Hand Swipe.\nSeath will swipe his left or right hand at the player. This is incredibly damaging and can only be blocked by high stability shields, but fairly easy to dodge since his hand hitbox is small.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls \u2014 Seath the Scaleless by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7x-egO0Nkn0&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

If the projectile makes contact with an enemy or destructible level geometry (tables, chairs, boxes, etc.), it will impact and stagger, deal 2.0 times the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Buff\"&gt;Spell Buff&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Catalysts%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;catalyst&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage. However, if it lands on solid level geometry such as a floor or wall, it will attach to it and begin seething and growing in strength. Roughly 4.5 seconds after initial contact with the surface, it will explode, dealing 3.92 times the Spell Buff of the catalyst as Fire damage in an area.\nStrategy.\nSingle player.\nBy manipulating enemy behavior and drawing aggro to a single spot, it is possible to kill multiple weaker targets with a single cast, or inflicting tremendous damage to large targets while expending less &lt;a href=\"FP\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt;. Its ability to stick to surfaces also makes it ideal for destroying targets that latch onto such surfaces to await ambush such as &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Cleric\"&gt;Undead Cleric&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIt is also worth noting that the radius of the explosion is large enough to allow it to damage foes through walls.\nOnline gameplay.\nWhile tricky to employ, this spell is extremely powerful as the explosion inflicts the highest amount of burst single-instance damage of all Pyromancies, beating even &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Bed%20Vestiges\"&gt;Chaos Bed Vestiges&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Great%20Chaos%20Fire%20Orb\"&gt;Great Chaos Fire Orb&lt;/a&gt;. However, it is very difficult to trick other players into standing near the projectile as it explodes. For this reason, this spell is better employed as area denial, threatening the enemy with massive damage should they linger in an area. It can also be used to force a &lt;a href=\"roll\"&gt;roll&lt;/a&gt;-catch by timing an attack with the explosion, either catching them after the roll or by attacking before the explosion and forcing them to expend their dodge into the blast.

Accordingly, at the foot of &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; and behind the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Burg\"&gt;Undead Burg&lt;/a&gt;, the gods built Sen's Fortress on the only route leading to their city to serve as a further testing ground. The fortress would become the second main trial for the Undead that managed to overcome the first challenge of the &lt;a href=\"Bells%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Bells of Awakening&lt;/a&gt; and seeked to enter Anor Londo to receive the &lt;a href=\"Lordvessel\"&gt;Lordvessel&lt;/a&gt;. \nAfter ringing the &lt;a href=\"Bells%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Bell of Awakening&lt;/a&gt; placed on the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Parish\"&gt;Undead Church&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Burg\"&gt;Undead Burg&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Quelaag%27s%20Domain\"&gt;Quelaag's Domain&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt; would learn of their mission from the awakened &lt;a href=\"Kingseeker%20Frampt\"&gt;Kingseeker Frampt&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt;. The Primordial Serpent would tell them that their fate is to succeed Lord Gwyn and link the Flame to continue the Age of Fire and undo the curse of Undeath, directing them toward the Sen's Fortress, to be tested further and prove themselves worthy enough of entering the city of the gods where they would acquire the &lt;a href=\"Lordvessel\"&gt;Lordvessel&lt;/a&gt; and continue their journey. After ringing the two bells, an enslaved &lt;a href=\"Giant\"&gt;Giant&lt;/a&gt; would recognize that an Undead has completed the first trial of their quest and open the gate to allow them to enter the fortress.\nThe structure was filled with many lethal traps including swinging blades, large rolling boulders and hidden ballistae traps to create the ultimate deadly challenge path. Many deadly enemies also guarded the fortress to hinder those who attempt to venture though. The main force of the defenders is composed of &lt;a href=\"Serpent%20Soldier\"&gt;Serpent Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Serpent%20Mage\"&gt;Serpent Mage&lt;/a&gt;s, hybrids of humans and snakes with monstrous appearance and strength created by &lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;Seath the Scaleless&lt;/a&gt; to act as his jailers. Additionally enslaved &lt;a href=\"Giant\"&gt;Giant&lt;/a&gt;s were used as gatekeepers, living launchers of firebombs and loaders a machine which will send boulders rolling throughout the fortress, creating environmental hazards capable of destroying those who wandered around the location.\nAs the final challenge for those Undead that managed to venture past the fortress, the gods placed an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt;, a construct with the purpose of acting as a guardian for &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;. The golem is a hunk of iron that makes up its &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Set\"&gt;iron armor&lt;/a&gt; of immense weight and is equipped with a heavy &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Axe\"&gt;iron axe&lt;/a&gt; capable of releasing a powerful blade of wind. It's animated by a &lt;a href=\"Core%20of%20an%20Iron%20Golem\"&gt;core&lt;/a&gt; that the gods created by infusing the bone of an archdragons with the power of souls. The golem served its purpose well and, over the centuries, slayed countless heroes seeking to reach Anor Londo. For the few exceptional champions who would have managed to pass this further test, three &lt;a href=\"Batwing%20Demon\"&gt;Batwing Demon&lt;/a&gt;s would have come to pick them up and transport them inside the walls of Anor Londo where their trials and the journey to obtain the Lordvessel would continue.\nCenturies after Lord Gwyn's sacrifice, as the First Flame began to fade and the curse of Undeath to regain strength heroes and warriors from all different lands tried to reach &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt; and ventured to Sen's Fortress to try and reach Anor Londo. Very fre were successful, like the strongest &lt;a href=\"Berenike%20Knight\"&gt;Berenike Knight&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Black%20Iron%20Tarkus\"&gt;Black Iron Tarkus&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Warrior of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Solaire%20of%20Astora\"&gt;Solaire of Astora&lt;/a&gt;. However, most of them failed in their mission to conquer the fortress's challenges despite their multiple attempts over the decades, ending up trapped, hollow or only became additional roadblocks to further hinder future warriors. \nAmon them the famous sorcerer &lt;a href=\"Big%20Hat%20Logan\"&gt;Big Hat Logan&lt;/a&gt; that tried to reach the &lt;a href=\"The%20Duke%27s%20Archives\"&gt;Duke's Archives&lt;/a&gt; to seek &lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;Seath the Scaleless&lt;/a&gt;'s knowledge, the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Prince%20Ricard\"&gt;Undead Prince Ricard&lt;/a&gt; a legendary hero that wandered the lands in a fateful ill-conceived journey until he ended up Undead and in Lordran and the &lt;a href=\"Knight%20King%20Rendal\"&gt;Knight King Rendal&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Balder%20Knight\"&gt;Balder Knight&lt;/a&gt;s that attempted to seek the Lordvessel and restore the power of the Flame to save their country plagued by Undeath.\nBonfire.\nThe only &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt; in the area is located near the top of the fortress, in the area where the &lt;a href=\"Giant\"&gt;Giant&lt;/a&gt; throws firebombs down toward the player. To reach it, the player must immediately turn left upon crossing the mist barrier and spotting the first giant. After climbing the first flight of stairs, the player must run directly across to the second flight of stairs. After climbing the second flight of stairs, the player will be led to an open courtyard with scorch marks etched onto the ground along with a burnt corpse. To the right, there will be a broken segment of wall. Simply approaching and dropping down here will lead to the bonfire. The fall will cause minor damage to the player, and it is possible to die before lighting it. "}

However, if the player has a &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; equipped that cannot be wielded in one hand, the player will &lt;a href=\"stagger\"&gt;stagger&lt;/a&gt; upon rolling into an enemy. This happens even if the player is holding the weapon in both hands (and has sufficient &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; to wield it two-handed). Wearing the Set of Thorns also increases the damage dealt with &lt;a href=\"Gauntlets\"&gt;Gauntlets&lt;/a&gt; by 20%, and adds 20 physical damage to kicks.\nUnfortunately, the Set of Thorns offers below average defense and resistances for its &lt;a href=\"weight\"&gt;weight&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Set\"&gt;Dark Set&lt;/a&gt;, for example, provides better or equivalent characteristics in all fields, for a lower weight.\nDespite not dealing poise damage, when rolling into an enemy or another player that has 0 poise, they will be staggered by the roll."}

Each individual piece can add to the total damage dealt, but only one piece needs to be worn for the effect. As well, wearing the gauntlets inflicts increased damage with bare-handed punches, while wearing the leggings inflicts damage with kicks; this also applies to damage dealt with ladder attacks, allowing the wearer to inflict greater &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; damage to other entities and increase the odds of knocking them off. All of these combined characteristics make the individual pieces very popular for safely inflicting damage to enemies that will stagger upon taking any damage during certain animations such as the &lt;a href=\"Monstrosity%20of%20Sin\"&gt;Monstrosity of Sin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Corvian%20Knight\"&gt;Corvian Knight&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as for easily finishing off enemy players after proccing their &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Denial\"&gt;Tears of Denial&lt;/a&gt;.\nOutside of these properties, the Set of Thorns has respectable but token defenses for its weight. It has very strong protection against &lt;a href=\"Slash%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Slash&lt;/a&gt; damage but is quite weak to &lt;a href=\"Strike%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Strike&lt;/a&gt;, and while it does not have the traditional weakness to &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; its elemental defenses are all quite low.\nThe armor set provides great &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt; resistance, but otherwise un-noteworthy status effect resistances. As well, it has poor &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;, barely more than many cloth sets in the &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20Sets%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;light armor sets&lt;/a&gt; category. This makes the set a poor choice for players who wish to wield ultra weapons."}

The repeated slams will deal much damage if the blade has been buffed by &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20Weapon\"&gt;Blessed Weapon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Blade%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Darkmoon Blade (Dark Souls III)&lt;/a&gt;.

A mass of legs with a ribcage-like maw, these monsters dwell in the sewers underneath &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20City\"&gt;Irithyll City&lt;/a&gt; and the toxic marshes of the &lt;a href=\"Profaned%20Capital\"&gt;Profaned Capital&lt;/a&gt;.

They will often submerge themselves underwater but their exposed back and hair gives away their position. Players are advised to used ranged weapons to weaken or eliminate them before they can get too close, especially in the toxic waters of the Capital.\nSome of the Sewer Centipedes in the lake outside the sewer entrance are dead; this can be seen by that they have no hair flowing in the water, and their skin is grey, versus white. The active ones have visible brown hair that moves slightly in the water. Alternatively, locking on will make them easy to locate."}

Upon coming to a &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt; in a ruined, circular stone structure, the player will see three directions to go.

Instead, sets of two or three Forest Guardians will have a specific area assigned to spawn. If an enemy is killed, the next enemy in queue will spawn immediately in the surrounding area (while spawning, he'll be visible for a brief moment).\nThere are three chests hidden in the forest:"}

This means that the Shadow Dagger, as well as all of the other equipment the Shadows drop, is no longer NG+ exclusive.\nCharacteristics.\nThe Shadow Dagger is a top tier dagger, being widely used and considered by some the best of its class.\nAs a drop from the Suspicious Shadows, the Shadow Dagger is an extremely strong weapon for backstabbing and riposting as it has the highest crit multiplier in the game.\nAlthough it is easily the best crit weapon for Strength oriented builds. It is matched by the standard &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dagger&lt;/a&gt; at high levels of Dexterity. However, the Shadow Dagger will almost always crit for higher damage if it is &lt;a href=\"Infusion\"&gt;infused&lt;/a&gt;, owing to higher base damage while having similar elemental scaling.\nThe two major drawbacks of the Shadow Dagger is its rarity, being found as a rare drop on a NG+ exclusive enemy, and the fact that it weighs a fair bit more than the Dagger though such difference is barely troublesome. This may be off putting to lighter builds, but it is well worth the effort for PvP builds.\nIt should be mentioned that should player want to use a dagger for actual combat, this weapon will also fill that role as it has the regular horizontal slices as weak attacks for both one handed and two handed, and quick thrust attacks with both its one handed and two handed strong attacks, which benefit from the use of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Leo%20Ring\"&gt;Old Leo Ring&lt;/a&gt;.

Its ability to inflict Bleed build-up also makes the Spiked Shield a handy tool to have on a &lt;a href=\"Luck\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt;-based build, as it can benefit from the &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Gem\"&gt;Hollow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Infusion%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;infusion&lt;/a&gt; both to improve the damage of the attack itself and to further boost the wielder's Luck if &lt;a href=\"Hollowing\"&gt;Hollowing&lt;/a&gt; is greater than 15."}

It provides respectable elemental absorption in all categories save for &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, along with very good stability for a medium shield. As a cost, the shield requires an unusually high amount of &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; to carry, and is among the heavier of the medium shields. It allows the wielder to perform the &lt;a href=\"Skill\"&gt;weapon art&lt;/a&gt; of the right-hand weapon, which can be used to create various deadly combinations while protecting the player from damage as needed.\nThe Shield of Want's most notable feature is that it boosts the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; gain of the wielder, granting 20% more souls when defeating any enemy, including &lt;a href=\"Boss%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;other players&lt;/a&gt;.

It also weighs slightly more than other medium shields.\nDespite these drawbacks, this shield can be extremely useful if the player is fighting a &lt;a href=\"Hexes\"&gt;Hexer&lt;/a&gt; or other Dark damaging enemy. It can also be of some use against non-Hex spells as well, but will rely heavily on consistent spell parries at that point.\nDespite increasing &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;stamina regeneration&lt;/a&gt;, the weight penalty from having it equipped tends to negate the amount added unless having a relatively high Maximum Equip Load."}

Pressing L1/LB causes the player character to guard themself from incoming damage. Shields absorb damage; although weapons can also absorb damage through blocking, they almost always feature much lower &lt;a href=\"Stability\"&gt;Stability&lt;/a&gt; and damage reduction. How much shields absorb are reflected by their statistics. Generally speaking, shields are great at absorbing &lt;a href=\"physical\"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; attacks, but poorer at absorbing &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;, and particularly &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage. L2/LT generates a &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt; from light and medium shields, or a bash from heavy shields.\nShields may be used on the right hand slot as rather ineffectual weapons. There are effective exceptions, though.\nMost shields from each type can be upgraded down the &lt;a href=\"Standard%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;Standard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Divine%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;Divine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; paths.

He is voiced by .\u00a0\nPlot.\nShiva is a member of the Forest Hunter covenant, and will not be present unless the player is among their ranks. He greets members cordially in the Darkroot Garden, but offers nothing there other than dialogue. Travel to &lt;a href=\"Blighttown\"&gt;Blighttown&lt;/a&gt;, though, and he will sell a variety of exotic weaponry.\nBoth &lt;a href=\"Alvina\"&gt;Alvina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Patches\"&gt;Patches&lt;/a&gt; express their mistrust towards Shiva, but he will be amicable and friendly with the player unless provoked. This mistrust is a remnant of cut content which involves Shiva killing the player to obtain their &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Blade\"&gt;Chaos Blade&lt;/a&gt; (a reference to Satsuki from \"&lt;a href=\"Demon%27s%20Souls\"&gt;Demon's Souls&lt;/a&gt;\"). Shiva would then flee to the Painted World where the player could invade via a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Eye%20Orb\"&gt;Black Eye Orb&lt;/a&gt; and regain the Chaos Blade. (This is evident from cut dialogues from the game)\nLore.\nNot much is known of Shiva, other than that he likes collecting things and is from an &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Land\"&gt;Eastern Land&lt;/a&gt;. According to the cut content, he may have come to Lordran in search of the Chaos Blade.\nStrategy.\nThe chief danger of fighting Shiva is the fact that he always has his &lt;a href=\"Shiva%27s%20Bodyguard\"&gt;bodyguard&lt;/a&gt; close to him. Thanks to Patch 1.05, the bodyguard can now be targeted, but fighting the two remains a tricky proposition. After moving to his Blighttown location, Shiva can be led into the swamps and poisoned, allowing for a slow but easy kill. The player can also escape up the nearby elevator after poisoning the duo, where they will be unable to follow, and allow the poison to run its course without any danger.\nShiva himself wields the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Round%20Shield\"&gt;Iron Round Shield&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Murakumo\"&gt;Murakumo&lt;/a&gt;, which deals decent damage and should not be underestimated; greeting the pair with a powerful &lt;a href=\"area%20of%20effect\"&gt;area of effect&lt;/a&gt; attack such as &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Tempest\"&gt;Fire Tempest&lt;/a&gt; is a good idea.\nSometimes, when the Forest Hunter Archer is killed or players join another covenant, if players talk to Alvina she will disappear in a mass of white. Occasionally, as soon as she has done this, Shiva's bodyguard, a Forest Hunter Thief and the Forest Hunter Bandit will try to overrun the player in an attempt to kill them for their betrayal. In the case that this happens, Shiva will be alone later on if the player is victorious.\nRemoved content.\n\"The following is content that is present within the code of Dark Souls, but not actually implemented in the game.

She respawns when killed, and doing such only affects prices, from this point higher (also earnings for the player will be lowered). Her prices will return to normal after the player absolves sin at the shrine to &lt;a href=\"Velka%2C%20the%20Goddess%20of%20Sin\"&gt;Velka&lt;/a&gt;. \nHowever, her counterpart in &lt;a href=\"Untended%20Graves\"&gt;Untended Graves&lt;/a&gt; can be killed.

It can be bought, but its only drop is available after killing her, suggesting that the Priestess Ring is her personal belonging."}

It is found in the &lt;a href=\"Shaded%20Woods\"&gt;Shaded Woods&lt;/a&gt; by taking the left path at the &lt;a href=\"Ruined%20Fork%20Road\"&gt;Ruined Fork Road&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt; and is initially blocked by a door that demands a number of strong &lt;a href=\"Soul%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; to open.\nThe door can be opened in one of two ways. The first is by defeating the four &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ones\"&gt;Old Ones&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Sinner\"&gt;The Lost Sinner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Iron%20King\"&gt;Old Iron King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Rotten\"&gt;The Rotten&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Duke%27s%20Dear%20Freja\"&gt;The Duke's Dear Freja&lt;/a&gt;. This is the most linear option and will ensure most prior areas are visited beforehand, leading to the possibility of more loot and souls.\u00a0\nThe second is by accumulating more than one million &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Memory\"&gt;Soul Memory&lt;/a&gt; in a single &lt;a href=\"New%20Game%20Plus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;New Game cycle&lt;/a&gt;. This requirement increases by an additional one million souls per New Game cycle, requiring the player to obtain two million souls after starting NG+, three million after starting NG++, and so on.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20the%20Ivory%20King\"&gt;Crown of the Ivory King&lt;/a&gt;\" DLC can be accessed from this area by interacting with the glowing statue in the middle of the shrine. This will transport the player to &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Eleum%20Loyce\"&gt;Frozen Eleum Loyce&lt;/a&gt;.\nItems.\nMiscellaneous\nStrategy.\nObtaining one million souls is not as hard as it sounds; most players will earn this amount naturally over the course of one playthrough and may even reach it before beating any of the Old Ones. Playing online as a white phantom is a good way of earning souls; defeating bosses will usually earn players a few thousand or more.\nOffline players may find a few good farming spots and use particular equipment to maximize their soul gain maximum. The &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Keep\"&gt;Iron Keep&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent location and can easily yield 30,000 souls and more by progressing from the first bonfire to the &lt;a href=\"Belfry%20Sol\"&gt;Belfry Sol&lt;/a&gt; bonfire while wearing the &lt;a href=\"Covetous%20Silver%20Serpent%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Covetous Silver Serpent Ring&lt;/a&gt; +1 and the &lt;a href=\"Jester%27s%20Gloves\"&gt;Jester's Gloves&lt;/a&gt;. Having some magic spells such as &lt;a href=\"Great%20Heavy%20Soul%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Great Heavy Soul Arrow&lt;/a&gt; will make this far easier as well as being able to kill the &lt;a href=\"Alonne%20Knight%20Captain\"&gt;Alonne Knight Captain&lt;/a&gt;s on the lower levels at the start. It is also best to pull the lever twice and then step on the pads to drop the knights into the lava instead of getting tangled up fighting them.\nThis can be done twelve times before enemies stop respawning. Of course, confident players can also purchase a &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20Ascetic\"&gt;Bonfire Ascetic&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0from &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Trader%20Chloanne\"&gt;Stone Trader Chloanne&lt;/a&gt; and continue to farm until the respawn limit is reached once again. Although, simply using the &lt;a href=\"Company%20of%20Champions\"&gt;Company of Champions&lt;/a&gt; Covenant is not only safer, it also factors out the huge damage increases; the only down side is the soul gains stay the same meaning the player would need to farm for longer. It is up to the player to decide which is better.\u00a0\nBy following this strategy, the player also has the added bonus of possibly finding &lt;a href=\"Large%20Titanite%20Shard%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Large Titanite Shards&lt;/a&gt; dropped by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ironclad%20Soldier\"&gt;Old Ironclad Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s and the armor dropped by the Alonne Knight Captains which can then be sold to &lt;a href=\"Lonesome%20Gavlan\"&gt;Lonesome Gavlan&lt;/a&gt; for a small margin as well. The &lt;a href=\"Covetous%20Gold%20Serpent%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Covetous Gold Serpent Ring&lt;/a&gt; +1 and the &lt;a href=\"Jester%27s%20Cap\"&gt;Jester's Cap&lt;/a&gt;, both obtained from &lt;a href=\"Magerold%20of%20Lanafir\"&gt;Magerold of Lanafir&lt;/a&gt; in the same area, will prove useful in this endeavor."}

There are also a number of elevators, sliding walls and rotating doors suggesting that, perhaps, the former citizens were well-educated and inventive. They were also suspicious of sorcery and preferred to put their trust in faith and miracles. Within the city is the Dragon's Sanctum where a cult of &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20Priestess\"&gt;priestesses&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20Knight\"&gt;guardian knights&lt;/a&gt; worshiped the tortured dragon &lt;a href=\"Sinh%2C%20the%20Slumbering%20Dragon\"&gt;Sinh&lt;/a&gt; under the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Elana%2C%20the%20Squalid%20Queen\"&gt;Elana, the Squalid Queen&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nShulva was a city built around a &lt;a href=\"Sinh%2C%20the%20Slumbering%20Dragon\"&gt;slumbering dragon&lt;/a&gt; that was worshipped as a &lt;a href=\"deity\"&gt;deity&lt;/a&gt;. It was governed by the &lt;a href=\"Sunken%20King\"&gt;Sunken King&lt;/a&gt; and Elana. The dragon slept in the interior of the sanctum where &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20Priestess\"&gt;priestess&lt;/a&gt; would attempt to soothe it with calming melodies. Eventually the city of Shulva was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Yorgh\"&gt;Sir Yorgh&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Drakeblood%20Knight\"&gt;Drakeblood Knight&lt;/a&gt;s, who sought the blood of the dragon in order to obtain a true understanding of life. The guardians of the city were overmatched and the Sunken King was defeated. Sir Yorgh entered the sanctum and tried to kill the dragon with his spear but instead awoke it from its sleep. As it woke up it spewed a toxic fog that quickly killed Sir Yorgh and filled the entire city rendering it uninhabitable. Elana, filled with rage after the defeat of the king, took on her true form and now collects &lt;a href=\"Souls%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; while continuing to protect the city and the dragon."}

In an effort to regain his pride, Siegmeyer offers to help the player by sacrificing himself in &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Izalith\"&gt;Lost Izalith&lt;/a&gt;, to dispatch some &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Eater\"&gt;Chaos Eater&lt;/a&gt;s in the poisonous pits. The outcome depends on the player's actions:\nLore.\nSiegmeyer's wife had recently died, but apparently he was out adventuring and unaware of her death.\nSiegmeyer appears to be an adherent of &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;, but judging from his miracle, he may not be in the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20White\"&gt;Way of White&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nSiegmeyer's &lt;a href=\"Zweihander\"&gt;Zweihander&lt;/a&gt; deals heavy damage and has a powerful &lt;a href=\"stagger\"&gt;stagger&lt;/a&gt;ing capability. However, he is quite slow and doesn't boast particularly high HP. He is also very easy to stagger; a moderately &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt;-damaging weapon will throw him off-balance.\nWhen fighting him near the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Parish%20%28bonfire%29\"&gt;Undead Parish&lt;/a&gt; bonfire, the player can back up to the bonfire while fighting him. Doing so will cause him to disappear back to his spawn point with the same amount of health the player left him at, allowing an opportunity to recover.\nRemoved content.\nFrom text dumps, Siegmeyer was supposed to encounter &lt;a href=\"Basilisk\"&gt;Basilisk&lt;/a&gt;s, probably in the &lt;a href=\"Depths\"&gt;Depths&lt;/a&gt; or in &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Hollow\"&gt;The Great Hollow&lt;/a&gt;. The player can choose to help him there in a similar fashion to his other encounters.

He tells the player that he is trying to figure out how to get to the top of the tower, in order to speak with &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Archer%20of%20the%20Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;whoever is launching the giant arrows&lt;/a&gt;, but the elevator only goes down to the basement. Once the player takes the elevator in either direction, Siegward will relocate, having solved the mystery of the elevator with the player's assistance.\nWhen the player is traveling between the ground level and the top of the tower, Siegward can be heard pondering during the descent, indicating that he has changed locations. There is a hidden platform that can be accessed by jumping off the elevator as it travels between floors, which leads to an upper level of the Undead Settlement.\nSiegward can be encountered here, sitting on a ledge observing the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt; off in the distance. If the player goes down and engages it, Siegward will berate them but offer support in defeating it. When it is defeated, he will reward the player with a &lt;a href=\"Siegbr%C3%A4u\"&gt;Siegbr\u00e4u&lt;/a&gt; and the \"Toast\" &lt;a href=\"Gestures%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;gesture&lt;/a&gt;. If the player speaks to him again, they will learn the \"Sleep\" gesture as well.\nTrapped in the Cathedral of the Deep.\nAfter encountering &lt;a href=\"Unbreakable%20Patches\"&gt;Unbreakable Patches&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Cathedral of the Deep&lt;/a&gt;, the player can encounter Siegward stuck in a well in the Cathedral of the Deep, right outside of the Cleansing Chapel &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;. As Patches has stolen &lt;a href=\"Catarina%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;his armor&lt;/a&gt;, the player must retrieve it in order to rescue Siegward. The armor can be obtained by purchasing it from Patches, or by killing him and looting it. If the player missed Patches's encounter in the Cathedral, they must trigger his appearance at &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt;. The triggering flag for Patches's encounter event is opening the large double doors to the rooftop mausoleum, so opening these doors will cause Patches to sell the armor at Firelink Shrine.\nWhen the player returns the armor to Siegward, he will teach them the \"Rejoice\" gesture.\nBefore Irithyll Dungeon.\nNext, Siegward will be found in &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt;, near the Distant Manor bonfire in the kitchen past the &lt;a href=\"Sewer%20Centipede\"&gt;Sewer Centipede&lt;/a&gt;s. Upon talking to him, he will thank the player for their assistance at the Cathedral of the Deep, and gift them &lt;a href=\"Emit%20Force\"&gt;Emit Force&lt;/a&gt;, another &lt;a href=\"Siegbr%C3%A4u\"&gt;Siegbr\u00e4u&lt;/a&gt; and heal the player upon completion of the initial dialogue. He will also grant the \"Toast\" and \"Sleep\" gestures here if the player has not previously obtained them.\nWhile in this location, Siegward will rescue &lt;a href=\"Greirat%20of%20the%20Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Greirat of the Undead Settlement&lt;/a&gt; if the latter has been sent to pillage Irithyll. However, once the player sets foot in Irithyll Dungeon, Siegward will immediately relocate and thus be unable to rescue Greirat anymore, which will result in his death unless Patches is capable of rescuing him.\nJailed in Irithyll Dungeon.\nThe last place Siegward can be found is in the &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20Dungeon\"&gt;Irithyll Dungeon&lt;/a&gt;, locked in a cell.

If he survives the encounter, he will give the player one final &lt;a href=\"Siegbr%C3%A4u\"&gt;Siegbr\u00e4u&lt;/a&gt;. Upon reloading the arena, his armor set, &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; and Storm Ruler can be found within the arena. If the player has already defeated Yhorm before freeing Siegward from the cell in the Profaned Capital, the Storm Ruler will appear as a drop in the boss area, but the player will not receive his armor set nor shield or Siegbr\u00e4u."}

They specialize in fast and fluid combos, focusing on inflicting damage through a large number of small attacks. Uniquely, when equipped in the off-hand they retain the ability to strike at targets with the weak attack, and can &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt; with the strong attack. However, their main weakness is that they lack any hard-hitting attacks and cannot inflict a guard break on enemies equipped with shields.\nHeavy curved swords, those of the &lt;a href=\"Falchion%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Falchion&lt;/a&gt; class, generally have a longer reach and are harder-hitting than their lighter cousins, but require more stamina to wield and are slower to attack. They rely on strong and deliberate strikes, making each blow count. Its variant of the &lt;a href=\"Spin%20Slash\"&gt;Spin Slash&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"weapon%20art\"&gt;weapon art&lt;/a&gt; differs from that of the light curved sword, and it possesses a standard kick, though it also lacks the ability to parry when equipped in the off-hand.\nCurved Swords.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

Most daggers are capable of both &lt;a href=\"slash\"&gt;slash&lt;/a&gt;ing and &lt;a href=\"thrust\"&gt;thrust&lt;/a&gt;ing attacks, which makes them very versatile and useful against a number of &lt;a href=\"enemies\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt;. Their speed means they are excellent at interrupting an opponent's attack. Once a dagger attack connects, successive strikes are nearly always guaranteed. This is made even more deadly by the fact that daggers also have an extremely high &lt;a href=\"critical%20attack\"&gt;critical attack&lt;/a&gt; damage modifier, which allows them to do more damage with critical hits than many stronger weapons.\nThe quick strikes and small attack motion also make them perfect weapons to use in confined spaces like narrow tunnels or small buildings. Daggers also have the unique ability of being able to &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt; when equipped in the left-hand, which allows you to dual wield weapons and still be able to &lt;a href=\"counter\"&gt;counter&lt;/a&gt; enemy attacks.\nDaggers.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nDetailed=\nCondensed=\nUpgraded=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

This makes a dagger a very reliable weapon against enemies known to defend themselves often with a &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; or their weapon, allowing for a powerful, and punishing, critical attack against them.\nDaggers.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nDetailed=\nCondensed=\nUpgraded=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Careful tactical consideration should be taken by the player while using these weapons as you need to be very close to successfully attack.

For a player, the damage inflicted to their own character is displayed only as a brief animation of the character's HP bar, roughly indicating the percentage of HP lost. It is possible to determine the actual number of damage received by opening the status menu before and after receiving damage and comparing the HP values.\nAttack Damage.\nAttack damage is the most common form of damage in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\". It is inflicted by hits with &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spells\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;, as well as creature body parts, such as fangs, claws, and tails.\nEvery attack has one or two of the following elemental damage types:\nWhile most attacks have a single type of damage only, attacks with elemental weapons commonly inflict physical damage and one of magic, fire, or lightning damage. For example, attacks with a Magic &lt;a href=\"Longsword\"&gt;Longsword&lt;/a&gt; deal both physical and magic damage.\nThere are three primary means to reduce attack damage.\nThe damage inflicted by an attack to the target's HP is the sum of the attack's physical, magic, fire, and lightning damage, after factoring damage reduction and defense.\nIn Dark Souls 1, defenses are calculated per type; meaning, the AR type of a weapon is calculated using its corresponding defensive type. The further apart both values are, the more damage is done, and the closer the values are, the more damage is reduced.\nApplying an &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Modification\"&gt;elemental infusion&lt;/a&gt; to your weapon will cause its base physical AR to be reduced while adding new elemental AR. When you add these two numbers together it will look like the total AR of your weapon is now much higher on paper; but because the physical and elemental ARs are much closer to the enemies corresponding defensive values, you get significantly reduced damage. For general PvE purposes on a normal leveled run, it is significantly better to deal a single type of damage, rather than splitting the damage between to types. \nSweet Spot Damage Bonus.\nAll weapons with a \"whiff\" animation can gain the 12.5% boost to damage after defenses are calculated. A whiff animation is what happens on certain weapon types when the attack does not connect with an enemy, causing the player to stumble. If the hit does connect the wiff animation does not come into player and the user will more as normal. Weapon types that can benefit from Sweet Spot Damage Bonuses include all &lt;a href=\"Axes\"&gt;Axes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hammers%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Halberds\"&gt;Halberds&lt;/a&gt;. Not all attacks will gain Sweet Spot damage, attacks like Ripostes and Backstabs will not gain this benefit at all, though one-handed and two-handed light and strong attacks of these weapon types are capable of sometimes gaining this bonus depending on the angle of attack. The hammer class is specifically unique in that they usually get this damage bonus. \nCounter Damage.\nA Counter Attack is one of the techniques used to increase damage dealt by thrust/piercing damage. It is sometimes confused with stagger damage, which is a different mechanic that also boosts damage. Counter can be performed by striking an opponent at the same time their attack would have hit you, or immediately afterwards (but before they recover from their attack animation). It is essentially a boost given to &lt;a href=\"Thrust%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;thrust&lt;/a&gt;/piercing attacks that risk likewise taking damage from the enemy at the same moment, though the enemy does not have to actually hit you. It naturally also works with pokes while upholding the shield for weapons that have this. The counter-attack window generally follow right after the attack hitbox disappears, i.e. shortly after the actual damage is dealt. Almost all enemies in the game can be counter-attacked, including large enemies and bosses.\nIt works with most weapons, including bows and crossbows, but counters only give a bonus to thrust/piercing attack types, so the effect is weaker with weapons that have split &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage.\nProcess.\nDamage calculations in Dark Souls generally follow a simple pattern, where only the number and value of components varies by context. In general, to determine the Damage of an attack:\nOne may also consider the inclusion of an earlier step, in which AR, &lt;a href=\"Magic%20adjustment\"&gt;Magic Adjustment&lt;/a&gt; or Physical Adjustment is determined. This would include the weapon base AR, upgrade multipliers and its Scaling, as well as miscellaneous thing such as the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlets%20of%20Thorns\"&gt;Gauntlets of Thorns&lt;/a&gt; effect on fist weapons.\nMotion Values.\n\"Motion Value\" (MV) is a wider Video-Game term. In the case of Dark Souls, it refers to a multiplier every attack of each weapon and every spell has, that is applied before the Defense Calculation, that allows the developers to differentiate attacks in their damage potential. These are often given in their percent value, e.g. almost all one-handed light attack have an MV of 100, a 1x multiplier, two-handed light-attacks have an MV of 120, a 1.2x multiplier, and two-handed jumping attacks an MV or 155, a 1.55x multiplier.\nDue to the behavior of the Damage Function (Defense Calculation below), a multiplier on AR always results in a greater multiplier on the resulting Damage, which is not constant, e.g. depending on AR and Defense a two-handed light-attack will have a multiplier of 1.2, but might deal 1.3x to 1.4x more damage for a Katana.\nAs another consequence of the function, identical MVs will have a lesser multiplicative effect for attacks with higher AR, as such a two-handed light-attack of a &lt;a href=\"Dagger\"&gt;Dagger&lt;/a&gt; might instead deal 1.6x more Damage.\nA comprehensive list of motion values can be currently found on the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WLC5V1mn_SvKmEp1zocxAdHSkEQpkidI4dW3XTZuYY/edit%3Fusp%3Dsharing\"&gt;Motion Values Google Sheet&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefense Calculation.\nWhere DMG is only the unmodified, partial damage after defense calculations, ATK is result of step 2 and DEF is the Defense of the Damage taking target (e.g. fire defense, thrust defense if the attack is physical and of that attack type etc.).\nformula_1\nWhere DMG is only the unmodified, partial damage after defense calculations, ATK is result of step 2 and DEF is the Defense of the Damage taking target (e.g. fire defense, thrust defense if the attack is physical and of that attack type etc.)."}

No &lt;a href=\"Soul%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; are required in the transposition process.\nCharacteristics.\nThe Dancer's Enchanted Swords are a rather unique set of curved swords, even among paired weapons. Utilizing the heavy curved sword moveset of the &lt;a href=\"Falchion%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Falchion&lt;/a&gt;, the Dancer's Swords will inflict physical damage as well as either &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage, depending on the blade that connects.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt; on these weapons is also very peculiar. Leveling &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; will not only increase the physical damage of the blades, but will also increase both the Magic and Fire damage. Leveling &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; will increase both the Magic and Fire damage, while leveling &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt; will increase only the Fire damage. This means that the most efficient way to increase damage output on these weapons is on a quality build, and that the Fire damage of the off-hand sword will be increased no matter which stat is leveled.\nBecause of its base requirements and heavily spread-out scaling, the Dancer's Swords can be very difficult to build for. As well, due to being paired curved swords they cannot make use of &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt; in any way, even during the &lt;a href=\"Skill\"&gt;weapon art&lt;/a&gt;, short of buffing with &lt;a href=\"Perseverance%20%28skill%29\"&gt;Perseverance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Flesh\"&gt;Iron Flesh&lt;/a&gt;. However, one useful facet of its split elemental damage is that at least one of the blades will meet with low flat defense against human opponents, as resisting Fire and Magic damage would require leveling Strength and Intelligence, respectively, which few builds are capable of. The elemental damage also allows the paired attacks to deal strong chip damage through most types of shields, as most commonly used shields in &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; will resist either Magic or Fire but not both."}

She also wears a crown with a long mirage-like veil, an article that proves her direct lineage from the old royal family of the gods. Instead of crawling on all fours like the other boreal knights she stands with her torso bent forward and her back curved, fighting and moving like she's dancing with deceivingly slow steps.\nLocation.\nFound in the &lt;a href=\"High%20Wall%20of%20Lothric\"&gt;High Wall of Lothric&lt;/a&gt;, in the cathedral where &lt;a href=\"Emma%2C%20High%20Priestess%20of%20Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;Emma, High Priestess of Lothric Castle&lt;/a&gt; resides. Under normal circumstances, she will reveal herself after the player has defeated the first three &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lords of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;: the &lt;a href=\"Abyss%20Watchers\"&gt;Abyss Watchers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aldrich%2C%20Devourer%20of%20Gods\"&gt;Aldrich, Saint of the Deep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yhorm%20the%20Giant\"&gt;Yhorm the Giant&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the third Lord of Cinder has been defeated, a cutscene will play with Emma summoning the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20One\"&gt;Ashen One&lt;/a&gt; to the cathedral. Once there, she will bestow them the &lt;a href=\"Basin%20of%20Vows\"&gt;Basin of Vows&lt;/a&gt;. Walking up to the statue of the beheading knight behind her with it in possession will trigger the boss fight.\nAlternatively, the player may kill Emma at any time during the game, loot the basin from her body and approach the statue to commence the battle. This allows for early access to &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;Lothric Castle&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Consumed%20King%27s%20Garden\"&gt;Consumed King's Garden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Untended%20Graves\"&gt;Untended Graves&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nThe Dancer is a direct descendant of &lt;a href=\"Gwynevere%2C%20Princess%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; and as such she was among the &lt;a href=\"Gods%23Irithyllians%20and%20Descendants%20of%20Gods\"&gt;Irithyllians&lt;/a&gt;, hybrids between the race of the gods of Anor Londo and humans, who inhabit Irithyll of the Boreal Valley, the city built for them on the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Sulyvahn\"&gt;Sulyvahn&lt;/a&gt; imprisoned &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Dark Sun Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt;, proclaimed himself pontiff and assumed control of the city, he bestowed a set of &lt;a href=\"Dancer%27s%20Enchanted%20Swords\"&gt;paired enchanted swords&lt;/a&gt; to the Dancer, as a symbol of her new subjection to the tyrant, as they were enchanted with dark magic in the right-hand, and fire in the left, &lt;a href=\"Greatsword%20of%20Judgment\"&gt;mirroring&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Profaned%20Greatsword\"&gt;those&lt;/a&gt; of the Pontiff. After that he ordered her to serve as a \"dancer\" in his service.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Lothric%2C%20Younger%20Prince\"&gt;Prince Lothric&lt;/a&gt; refused to link the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt; fell into ruin due to various internal problems, Sulyvahn would order the Dancer to serve as a Boreal Outrider Knight, which was the equivalent to being exiled. These knights, before being dispatched to foreign lands, were given the &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%27s%20Left%20Eye\"&gt;eye rings&lt;/a&gt; of the Pontiff, with the power to transform them into savage, raving warriors who only knew how to serve as mindless guards. thus ensuring Sulyvahn total control over them and preventing them from betraying him. \nThe Dancer was thus sent to Lothric together with a division of Boreal Outrider Knights and under the watchful eye of &lt;a href=\"Vordt%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Vordt of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt;. Here she positioned herself to guard the Cathedral and &lt;a href=\"Emma%2C%20High%20Priestess%20of%20Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;High Priestess Emma&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike other Outrider Knights, she would end up transformed into a frenzied beast by the rings of the Pontiff, causing her armor to be fused with her hide.\nFight overview.\nStrategy.\nThe arena in which the Dancer is fought is not very large, and gives limited room for avoiding her attacks. As well, the furniture at the sides can obstruct movement, so rolling through them early in the fight can provide more maneuvering space later. The pillars at the sides can also be used as a limited form of cover to shield oneself from her attacks. These pillars as well as the walls can be set on fire by hitting them with a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; source like the &lt;a href=\"Torch%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;, or by the Dancer's attacks with her right-hand weapon.\nFor the first phase of the fight, the Dancer performs limited combos with her weapon, with a few attacks that can reach her sides or behind her. It is best to stay near the Dancer's right leg so that her grab is easier to see (although it doesn't reach far, it can reach far around her left side, making it a bad idea to side roll). Boosting fire resistance with the &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Stoneplate%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Flame Stoneplate Ring&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Red%20Bug%20Pellet\"&gt;Red Bug Pellet&lt;/a&gt; may be a good idea but not required as it is in your best interest to avoid her attacks altogether. Using stamina reinforcers like the &lt;a href=\"Grass%20Crest%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Grass Crest Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chloranthy%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Chloranthy Ring&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Green%20Blossom%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Green Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; are a good idea, as it will provide more stamina to be ready to evade her attacks.\nAround half health, the Dancer will bring out her second blade which does &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; damage, losing her ability to perform her grab attack. Her combos become much more dangerous and lengthy at this point, with several of them having unpredictable stopping points (particularly her twirl) or retaliatory follow-ups to punish attempts to attack at the end of a combo. During this phase, it is generally better to stay in front of her rather than behind, in order to more easily read her attacks and dodge. Be mindful that her twirling attacks coincide precisely with chained rolls, so performing repeated rolls at the right moment will dodge all of them including the finishing spin. The few chains that she does throw however can leave behind a dragging trail of fire, or dark. That tracks through the attacks path.\nThe Dancer is not a particularly fast boss, but her movements are deliberate and she has very long and powerful combos, so fast weapons that do not have long windup or recovery times can work better than slow and powerful weapons. She also does not have a lot of health for a boss at this stage of the game, reducing her difficulty for experienced players attempting to kill her early. She will eventually stagger after taking enough &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; damage, and enough hits targeted on her head will open her up for a &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;critical attack&lt;/a&gt;. A relatively heavy armor set and strong enough two handed weapon can stagger her in about 2 to 3 strikes. Though the stagger state only last for around 2.5 seconds and will only offer the enhance damage effect for around half as much time.\nThe Dancer is weak to &lt;a href=\"Strike%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Strike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; damage, as well as being susceptible to &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt; buildup. This makes &lt;a href=\"Human%20Pine%20Resin\"&gt;Human Pine Resin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carthus%20Rouge\"&gt;Carthus Rouge&lt;/a&gt; powerful tools to use for this fight, as well as weapons such as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Hand%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark Hand&lt;/a&gt;. Casters will have the option to use spells such as &lt;a href=\"Dorhys%27%20Gnawing\"&gt;Dorhys' Gnawing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Great%20Deep%20Soul\"&gt;Great Deep Soul&lt;/a&gt;, which will allow them to eviscerate her from a distance.\nKeep in mind that the Dancer's attacks are often lanky and very difficult to telegraph. So the player should take caution when choosing a time to attack."}

For weapons, this bonus value is expressed as blue text alongside the base attack value on the &lt;a href=\"Equipment%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Equipment&lt;/a&gt; Status screen in-game.\nThe Dark Attack Bonus value is determined by the lowest &lt;a href=\"Stats%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;stat&lt;/a&gt; of either &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt;. This value is then multiplied by the dark scaling weapon or casting tool's dark scaling stat, then added to the attack rating along with any other scaling. In order to continually increase innate Dark Attack Bonus, both Intelligence and Faith need to be leveled up side-by-side. For example, if both skills are at 50, Dark Defense will be set to 177 points. Dark Attack Bonus caps at 200 points, when both stats are at 99.\nDark weapons.\nThe following is a list of weapons and &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; that bear an innate Dark Damage effect. For information as to how these weapons are affected by Dark infusions, see this section.\nBoosting Dark Damage.\nThere are two &lt;a href=\"Rings%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;rings&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; that can grant a bonus to Dark Attack when worn.\nThe bonus granted from the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Clutch%20Ring\"&gt;Dark Clutch Ring&lt;/a&gt; can boost the Dark Attack value for both Hexes (via the &lt;a href=\"Casting%20Tools%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;casting tool&lt;/a&gt;) and Dark weapons, but reduced &lt;a href=\"physical%20defense\"&gt;physical defense&lt;/a&gt;s. The Dark bonus amount can vary depending on what type of casting tool or Dark weapon or is equipped, be it &lt;a href=\"%23Dark%20weapons\"&gt;innate Dark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%23Infusion\"&gt;infused Dark&lt;/a&gt; or both. The &lt;a href=\"Abyss%20Seal\"&gt;Abyss Seal&lt;/a&gt; grants a flat 7% boost to Hexes only, but at the cost of draining HP every time a Hex is cast. Both of these items can be worn together, which stacks the bonus.\n&lt;a href=\"Unleash%20Magic\"&gt;Unleash Magic&lt;/a&gt; is a unique &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;sorcery&lt;/a&gt; that temporarily increases the Dark Attack of all &lt;a href=\"Hexes\"&gt;Hexes&lt;/a&gt; by 20%, but at a cost of reducing Heath by 30%. Dark Attack on weapons is not affected.\nDark augmentation and consumables.\nMost weapons can be given the ability to deal Dark Damage temporarily through the use of Hexes or &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Pine%20Resin\"&gt;Dark Pine Resin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe damage of these buffs does not scale with the Dark Attack Bonus, rather applies a flat bonus based on the weapon's original Dark Damage (WoDD), if any. If the weapon bears an innate Dark effect, the Dark damage value is boosted. Applying Dark buffs result in the weapon taking on a purple glow.\nUnlike weapon buffs, the damage &lt;a href=\"Hexing%20Urn\"&gt;Hexing Urn&lt;/a&gt;s deal scale based on the Dark Attack Bonus value. They can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Titchy%20Gren\"&gt;Titchy Gren&lt;/a&gt; for 350 souls each. Arrows and Bolts laced with Dark deals a flat Dark Damage value, plus their physical damage. They can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Grave%20Warden%20Agdayne\"&gt;Grave Warden Agdayne&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefense.\nDark Defense (abbreviated as Dark DEF in-game) governs how robust the player is against Dark based attacks.\nInnate Defense.\nInnate Dark Defense describes the value of the players Dark Defense when not influenced by any outside factors, such as &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, spells or consumables. A hidden Dark Defense stat of 100 points is always granted, regardless of character class.\u00a0Dark Defense can be increased incrementally through leveling both &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt;. The Dark Defense value is determined by lower of the two stats. This means in order to continually increase innate Dark Defense, both Intelligence and Faith need to be leveled up side-by-side. For example, if both skills are at 50, Dark Defense will be set to 170 points. Innate Dark Defense caps at 200 points, when both stats are at 99.\nDark Defense cap.\nTotal Dark Defense is capped at 890 points. Combined with the hidden stat of 100 points, Dark Defense can reach a maximum of 990 points. Since 1000 points of any &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;magical&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; defense equals immunity, Dark Damage cannot be completely nullified, with the exception of blocking with a shield. For information on how to achieve this cap, see &lt;a href=\"%23Achieving%20the%20cap\"&gt;this section&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor and shields.\nVarious armor pieces grant varying levels of Dark Defense. The following armor table shows the armor pieces which grant the highest possible Dark Defense, for each body part.\nShields will only block Dark attacks if the player is actively blocking. Merely equipping the shield does not count towards defense. The Dark defense value on shields is expressed as a percentage in-game, as opposed to points on armor. The following shields table shows all shields that grant at least 75% reduction.\nItems and spells.\nCertain defensive spells can increase Dark Defense, with varying results, but they cannot be stacked with each other. Only one spell can be active at a time. &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Troches\"&gt;Dark Troches&lt;/a&gt; are consumable items that can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Cromwell%20the%20Pardoner\"&gt;Cromwell the Pardoner&lt;/a&gt; for 1200 souls each. Dark Troches cannot be stacked with any of the defensive spells either. Consuming a Dark Troche will remove the Dark Defense provided by the spell, and apply the Dark Troche defense value.\nRings.\nOnly two rings provide Dark Defense. Both can be worn together, granting a maximum of 270 Dark Defense, at the highest item level. Like all other rings, duplicate rings cannot be worn simultaneously.\nLowering Defense.\nAn overall Dark Defense penalty can be incurred by equipping certain weapons:\nAchieving the cap.\nIn practice, raising Dark Defense to ~990 (or 99%) is achievable by combining several pieces of gear - albeit temporarily as a spell is required. This can be useful in situations when facing &lt;a href=\"enemies\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; who deal very high levels of Dark Damage, such as &lt;a href=\"Darklurker\"&gt;Darklurker&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis table illustrates how the cap can be reached using a combination of gear with high resistance, however other methods using a combination different armor, spells or items is certainly possible.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"Warlock%20Mask\"&gt;Warlock Mask&lt;/a&gt; is a rare drop, it can be substituted with a &lt;a href=\"Executioner%20Helm\"&gt;Executioner Helm&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Velstadt%27s%20Helm\"&gt;Velstadt's Helm&lt;/a&gt;, both of which offer moderate defense. Similarly, since the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Witch%20Robe\"&gt;Black Witch Robe&lt;/a&gt; can be easily missed, it can be substituted with &lt;a href=\"Agdayne%27s%20Black%20Robe\"&gt;Agdayne's Black Robe&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote that the table does not take into account the player's displayed innate Dark DEF, which is a variable (between 0 - 200) based on the &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt; stat.\nInfusion.\n &lt;a href=\"Steady%20Hand%20McDuff\"&gt;Steady Hand McDuff&lt;/a&gt; can &lt;a href=\"infuse\"&gt;infuse&lt;/a&gt; most weapons with Dark through the use of a &lt;a href=\"Darknight%20Stone\"&gt;Darknight Stone&lt;/a&gt;. Once a weapon is infused, the Dark icon () will be displayed next to its image in the HUD.\nEnemies.\nThe following is a breakdown of enemies and &lt;a href=\"Boss%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt; information relating to Dark damage and resistance."}

Each area challenges the player with lighting a sconce with a &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;, killing all of the black phantoms so the fog wall covering the exit disappears, and then finally jumping through a dark, foggy pit which will teleport the player either back to Grandahl or, if all three areas have been successfully cleared out and their beacons lit, to the &lt;a href=\"Darklurker\"&gt;Darklurker&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe beacons that must be lit are a large black bowl with a little metal part one can interact with; it must be lit by using a torch that itself must be lit with a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Butterfly\"&gt;Flame Butterfly&lt;/a&gt;; one may see when they are approaching the bowl by the surrounding black columns on the walls. The sconce cannot be lit using &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Pyromancy&lt;/a&gt;, thus it may be a good idea to stock up on Flame Butterflies if one is low \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Weaponsmith%20Ornifex\"&gt;Weaponsmith Ornifex&lt;/a&gt; sells them.\nWhen one first enters the covenant, the portal will be open, but subsequent attempts at the Dark Chasm of Old requires the player give Grandahl a &lt;a href=\"Human%20Effigy\"&gt;Human Effigy&lt;/a&gt; to reopen the portal. Considering the many deadly falls in the chasm and the enemies that boast high HP, this can be a potentially costly procedure if one dies a lot. If the player dies inside the Dark Chasm, they will return to the last bonfire rested at.\nAfter completing three challenges, the end of the last area cleared will lead the player to face a boss: the Darklurker. Killing him will grant the player victory and the final rank in the covenant.\nWalkthrough.\n&lt;a href=\"Shaded%20Woods\"&gt;Shaded Woods&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are four enemies in this chasm. Follow the path until it opens up, and then follow the left wall downward in the next room where there will be three enemies: a shade and two black phantoms. Try luring them one at a time with magic or arrows. The shade has the least health, and a pit can be found directly ahead of the entrance, try positioning an enemy's back towards the pit and attack them so they stagger backwards and fall down the pit to their deaths. When the room is clear, light the sconce. At the end of the room (watch out for holes) is a switch that will bring up a lift; go down it to fight one last black phantom in a very open area with completely solid ground. Once the phantom has been defeated, the exit pit on the right will open.\n&lt;a href=\"Black%20Gulch\"&gt;Black Gulch&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are six enemies in this chasm. At the end of the short path, three enemies will block the player's way, and it is important not to draw all of their aggro at once. Use arrows or slowly edge along the right until the Ironclad phantom with two weapons comes after the player; sometimes the shade will come after the player too. Ideally, the pyromancer at the bottom will not notice the player. Kill the shade first if it notices the player as it has the least health, otherwise concentrate on the Ironclad phantom. When they have both been defeated, clear out the pyromancer as well.\nFurther on, when the path forks left and right, go left to light the sconce. Be careful when walking towards the sconce as the pathway is on the right and a large pit lies on the left. Return to where the path forked and go to the right this time, leading to the exit, which is again guarded by the same three enemies. Again, try to lure the Ironclad phantom out first, then deal with the shade too if it comes after the player, and then the pyromancer. After all enemies are defeated, the fog covering the exit pit dissipates and one can leave.\n&lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Castle\"&gt;Drangleic Castle&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the player arrives, they should be careful, as they can fall down and die instantly if they don't watch where they step; the path twists in an 'S' shape, so stick to the path and head through the door way. Lighting a torch using a Flame Butterfly can help here, or just simply move the camera overhead and aim it directly downwards. The path will open up in to a wider area with split ways. On the left will be the first black spirit who resembles &lt;a href=\"Havel%20the%20Rock\"&gt;Havel the Rock&lt;/a&gt;: a heavily armored knight equipped with a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Tooth%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dragon Tooth&lt;/a&gt;. Havel is the most deadly opponent in this area; his attacks drain a lot of stamina and can forcibly send the player backwards a great deal, even off the edge. Powerful magic works well against him, and if one is skilled or daring, they can fight him near the edge and attack him until he falls off it, instantly killing him. Much like in the first game, he can also be backstabbed, which helps immensely.\nOnce he's taken care of, a shade can be found to the left, &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Prince%20Ricard\"&gt;Undead Prince Ricard&lt;/a&gt; in a tunnel straight ahead (which also joins to the left), and a female phantom who inflicts &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt; to the right. The latter is fought in an area with a pit in the center, and it is fairly easy to position her back towards it and attack her until she falls down.\nThe sconce is on the left path, and the exit pit is on the right, just past the female phantom.\nAchievements/Trophies.\nAlthough there is no dedicated &lt;a href=\"Achievements/Trophies%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Achievement/Trophy&lt;/a&gt; for completing the Dark Chasm of Old or defeating the &lt;a href=\"Darklurker\"&gt;Darklurker&lt;/a&gt;, there are two &lt;a href=\"hexes\"&gt;hexes&lt;/a&gt; that can only be unlocked through completion of these areas.\n&lt;a href=\"Climax\"&gt;Climax&lt;/a&gt; is unlocked after completing all three areas of the Dark Chasm of Old and defeating the Darklurker. Return and speak to &lt;a href=\"Darkdiver%20Grandahl\"&gt;Darkdiver Grandahl&lt;/a&gt; to advance to the third and final rank of the &lt;a href=\"Pilgrims%20of%20Dark\"&gt;Pilgrims of Dark&lt;/a&gt; covenant, whereupon Grandahl will reward the player with this hex.\n&lt;a href=\"Lifedrain%20Patch\"&gt;Lifedrain Patch&lt;/a&gt; requires that the player trade the &lt;a href=\"Darklurker%20Soul\"&gt;Darklurker Soul&lt;/a&gt; and 5,000 Souls to &lt;a href=\"Straid%20of%20Olaphis\"&gt;Straid of Olaphis&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Bastille\"&gt;The Lost Bastille&lt;/a&gt; (players will need a &lt;a href=\"Fragrant%20Branch%20of%20Yore\"&gt;Fragrant Branch of Yore&lt;/a&gt; to free him if they have not done so first)."}

This makes the Dark Hand a very well rounded &lt;a href=\"Small%20Shields\"&gt;Small Shield&lt;/a&gt; alternative. It also has the highest durability available and is hidden when not actively blocking, helping to offset its very low &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt; negative.\nAs a weapon, the Dark Hand's special right handed strong attack is the only action capable of stealing &lt;a href=\"liquid%20humanity\"&gt;liquid humanity&lt;/a&gt; from NPCs and other players.

Dark Hand users may not steal more humanity than is available on their target; for example, if a Darkwraith +3 were to use the grab on someone with 8 humanity, they'd only steal 8 and not 10. Certain NPCs carry liquid humanity on them, and can have all their humanity stolen without becoming hostile towards the player thanks to the very low damage the Dark Hand deals to NPCs when initiating the grab move.\nMoveset.\nResistance Defense.\nAlong with Physical and Elemental damage reduction, weapons also have hidden stats that reduce the amount of status build-up while blocking.\nDescription.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Official translation=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

What sets it apart is that, though its defense is wholly unspectacular compared to some of the other high-level medium sets, it stands above many of them in terms of defense for each unit of weight. As such, it is especially valuable for players who want good poise and defense, but want to minimize the weight involved with such a choice.\nTwo of its drawbacks are that, to acquire it, the player must reach level +2 in the &lt;a href=\"Darkwraith%20%28covenant%29\"&gt;Darkwraith&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;, which can be both difficult and time-consuming, and the player must acquire &lt;a href=\"Twinkling%20Titanite\"&gt;Twinkling Titanite&lt;/a&gt; to upgrade it. Later in the game, however, the second issue can be nullified by being able to purchase the Twinkling Titanite from the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Blacksmith\"&gt;Giant Blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; for 8,000 &lt;a href=\"Soul%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; per piece and by unlocking good Twinkling Titanite farming locations, such as &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Lake\"&gt;Ash Lake&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Cave\"&gt;Crystal Cave&lt;/a&gt;'s boss area."}

However, it lacks &lt;a href=\"petrification\"&gt;petrification&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;curse&lt;/a&gt; resistance, has unremarkable poise for its weight, and is costly to reinforce, as it requires &lt;a href=\"Twinkling%20Titanite%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Twinkling Titanite&lt;/a&gt;.

As well, its &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; to weight ratio is sub-par compared to similarly weighted sets.\nThe set is very weak to &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage, and susceptible to &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is the namesake of the \"Dark Souls\" series.\nDescription.\nThe Dark Soul, one of the unique &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Soul\"&gt;Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt;s, was claimed by the &lt;a href=\"Furtive%20Pygmy\"&gt;Furtive Pygmy&lt;/a&gt;, the ancestor of the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt; and Humanity. In the introduction to the first \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\", it is depicted as a small, reddish flame like a candle. However, this conflicts with later descriptions.\nCapabilities.\nAny fragment of the Dark Soul that separates from the original can be fueled by emotions and willpower, and increase its usable power, making it the most unique of the four Lord Souls.\nMost notable of its functions is the power to animate life and raise sentient beings from the Abyss, for the Dark Soul is the only Lord Soul which is intrinsically tied to the Abyss, unlike the other forms of life that take energy from &lt;a href=\"Soul\"&gt;Soul&lt;/a&gt;s. The main lifeform connected to it is the Human race, but lesser creatures are said to have also risen from the Dark, such as the &lt;a href=\"White-faced%20Locust\"&gt;White-faced Locust&lt;/a&gt;. The Dark Soul is also linked to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Hand\"&gt;Dark Hand&lt;/a&gt;, and by extension, the art of Lifedrain. This is the legendary power of the fabled Dark Lord, used to gain humanity from others. The &lt;a href=\"Darkwraith%20%28enemy%29\"&gt;Darkwraiths&lt;/a&gt; used this power to steal &lt;a href=\"Humanity%20Mechanic\"&gt;Humanity&lt;/a&gt; from their victims.\nIn terms of passive uses, bearers or close descendants of the true Dark Soul via its &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20the%20Dark%20Soul\"&gt;Blood&lt;/a&gt; - such as the Pygmies - have increased longevity, though it does not seem to truly render mortal bearers immune to age and death. It is discovered that the Dark Soul carries the power necessary to create a painted world, and the painter of the next incarnation uses this \"pigment\" to paint a cold dark world on a canvas to escape the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;current&lt;/a&gt; painted world, once two Unkindled (Elfriede &amp; the Ashen One) arrive and ignite the flame that burns its rot away.\nLore.\nDuring the advent of Fire, the concept of Disparity came into existence, and with it the Dark and the Light. At some points humanoid creatures found powerful souls near the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; and claimed them, becoming known as &lt;a href=\"Lords\"&gt;Lords&lt;/a&gt; While the other three \"&lt;a href=\"Lords\"&gt;Lords&lt;/a&gt;\" found larger souls, a lowly and forgotten being known only as the Furtive Pygmy that found a fourth, peculiar soul later than the others: the Dark Soul.\nUsing the Dark Soul, the Pygmy created black sprites of darkness called &lt;a href=\"Humanity%20Phantom\"&gt;Humanity&lt;/a&gt;, which was given to his descendants. These dark-souled beings risen from the Abyss were called Humans, and each bore a small fragment of the Dark Soul. When the other Lords began fighting against the &lt;a href=\"Everlasting%20Dragons\"&gt;Everlasting Dragons&lt;/a&gt;, they conscripted the Humans into the forces, who aided the Lords by forging quasi-living arms and armor deep within the Abyss. But the Humans were betrayed by the Lords, for they feared the Dark that resides within each and every one of them. Their contributions to the War of the Ancients went completely unrecorded, and upon their Humanity, the &lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;Gods&lt;/a&gt; placed a sealing ring of fire, later to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Darksign\"&gt;Darksign&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost Humans would come to serve the Gods in the years that followed, while their ancestors, the Pygmies and their royal family, were relocated to the &lt;a href=\"Ringed%20City%20%28location%29\"&gt;Ringed City&lt;/a&gt;, \u201cgifted\u201d to them by the \"generous\" &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord Gwyn&lt;/a&gt;. He also gave to them his youngest daughter, &lt;a href=\"Filianore\"&gt;Filianore&lt;/a&gt;, and as she was given away, her father promised the Princess that he would come back for her\u2026one day..\nThose royal pygmies that retreated to the Ringed City brought the Dark Soul with them, with the original soul eventually ending up split among multiple &lt;a href=\"Pygmy%20Lord\"&gt;Pygmy Lord&lt;/a&gt;s. The majority of the royals of the Pygmies continued to serve and revere the gods for millenia, but the &lt;a href=\"Ringed%20Knight\"&gt;Ringed Knight&lt;/a&gt;s that took parts in the ancient war against the dragons subtly defied them in what ways they could..\n Near the final end of the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Age of Fire&lt;/a&gt;, the slave knight called &lt;a href=\"Gael\"&gt;Gael&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the Ringed City, seeking the Pygmy Lords to gain their &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20the%20Dark%20Soul\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;. The blood of the Dark Soul was intended to be used to paint a new Painted World, but to Gael's shock, Filianore's spell was broken and the Pygmy Lords were aged to the point that their blood did not flow, for it was dried in their veins. Even though he knew he had not the strength to survive bearing it, Gael slew the Pygmy Lords and drank from their wounds, absorbing the Dark Soul into himself. It imbued him with a dark miasma and warped his mind, but in the end he was successful, slain by the Ashen One to extract the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20the%20Dark%20Soul\"&gt;soul's blood&lt;/a&gt;. The current state of the Dark Soul is unknown, but given the eternal nature of Lord Souls, it is unlikely that it was truly destroyed."}

It was later re-released on PC in 2012, then remastered in 2018, releasing to PC, latest-generation consoles, and the Nintendo Switch.\nThe game was previously developed under the codename \"Project Dark\" and is the spiritual successor to \"&lt;a href=\"Demon%27s%20Souls\"&gt;Demon's Souls&lt;/a&gt;\". It also uses an updated variant of the aforementioned game's engine.\n\"Dark Souls\" was released in Japan for the PlayStation 3 on September 22, 2011, in North America for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on October 4, 2011 and in Europe on October 7, 2011.\nGameplay.\n\"Dark Souls\" focuses on dungeon exploring and the tension and fear that arise when players encounter &lt;a href=\"enemies\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; in this setting. The game is a spiritual successor to \"Demon's Souls\", which in turn is considered a spiritual successor to the \"King's Field\" games. The game takes place in an open world environment and uses a third-person perspective. The player battles using various &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and strategies to survive in a dark fantasy world. Online features allow players to share the play experience without need for direct communication.\nWith respect to \"Demon's Souls\", there are more weapons, &lt;a href=\"spells\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;, and new &lt;a href=\"Classes%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;classes&lt;/a&gt;. Before release, it was also said to be \"significantly harder\", with more enemies and more difficult encounters. It includes leaving &lt;a href=\"messages\"&gt;messages&lt;/a&gt; to other players, seeing others' &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"player%20versus%20player\"&gt;player versus player&lt;/a&gt; (as well as a new &lt;a href=\"Cooperative%20gameplay\"&gt;co-op&lt;/a&gt; system); similar to the online functions in \"Demon's Souls\". The &lt;a href=\"Equipment\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; the player uses in these games are significantly different.\nPrepare to Die Edition.\n\"Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition\" is the PC release, as well as the PS3 and Xbox 360 re-release, of \"Dark Souls\".\nThe game was released on August 24th, 2012 for PC and in October 2012 for PS3 and Xbox 360 and includes the \"&lt;a href=\"Artorias%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Artorias of the Abyss&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion which introduced new &lt;a href=\"bosses\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;locations&lt;/a&gt;.

The remaster released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on May 24 and 25, 2018. \nThe Nintendo Switch release was originally planned for May 25 as well, but was delayed to summer 2018. On August 14, 2018, it was announced that the Switch version would be releasing on October 19, 2018.\nThe remaster includes the \"Artorias of the Abyss\" expansion and improved graphics, lighting, shading, and sound effects, running at 60 frames per second on both consoles and PC. The multiplayer component received dedicated servers for all four platforms, with up to 6 players. \nThe game has a retail price of $39.99 USD, but launched alongside a 50% discount for owners of the original \"Dark Souls\" on PC.

An abundance of merchandise such as books and figures were also created under the brand. More notably, a \"Dark Souls\" &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20%28comic%20series%29\"&gt;comic series&lt;/a&gt; published by &lt;a href=\"Titan%20Comics\"&gt;Titan Comics&lt;/a&gt; began publication in 2016, with several other comics subsequently being released in later years.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//steamforged.com/products/dark-souls-the-board-game\"&gt;Dark Souls\u2122: The Board Game&lt;/a&gt; (2017) is a combat-centric miniatures game for 1-4 players.

The game has a sequel,\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;\", which was released in 2016.\nPlot.\nThe story of \"Dark Souls II\" is not directly connected to \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\", though they are set in the same world.\nThe game takes place in &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt;, a once prosperous land under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Vendrick\"&gt;King Vendrick&lt;/a&gt;, which has fallen to ruin throughout the ages with the raging war between &lt;a href=\"humans\"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"giants\"&gt;giants&lt;/a&gt;, the sudden disappearance of the King, and the spreading of the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Curse\"&gt;Undead Curse&lt;/a&gt;. Like many others, the &lt;a href=\"Bearer%20of%20the%20Curse\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; has come to the crumbling kingdom in search of a cure for their crippling affliction, the Curse of the Undead.\nGameplay.\nSimilar to the previous title, players customize the gender and physical features of their character, in addition to choosing a &lt;a href=\"Classes%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;starting class&lt;/a&gt;, which determines the stats and equipment that the player begins with, and a &lt;a href=\"Starting%20Gifts%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;starting gift&lt;/a&gt;. From a third-person perspective, players explore a continuous, open world that is roughly the same size as the original game, but with more freedom in how the player can progress. Akin to the notorious difficulty of its predecessor, players are confronted by a persistently hostile environment with unrelenting &lt;a href=\"Enemies%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Boss%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 death is a central theme. As enemies are defeated, &lt;a href=\"Souls%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; are accumulated, acting as both a form of currency and means to increase &lt;a href=\"Stats%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt;.

The character becomes kindled by consuming an Ember which increases the player character's &lt;a href=\"Hit%20Points%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; by 30% and allows them to summon other players to their world.

If the player is carrying a &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;, they will cower in fear and attempt to flee, although they will occasionally swipe if they get too close. If the player is skilled enough, they can dodge its swipe and &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt; them. They will also become aggressive if cornered, attacking the player regardless of light.\nActivating the &lt;a href=\"Pharros%27%20Lockstone\"&gt;Pharros' Lockstone&lt;/a&gt; contraption in the middle of the wharf will bathe most of the area in light, causing the Dark Stalkers to cower inside.

He accepts &lt;a href=\"Souvenirs%20of%20Reprisal\"&gt;Souvenirs of Reprisal&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for increasing the player's rank in the covenant.\nLore.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;.\nGwyndolin is the lastborn child of &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; and one of the deities who resided in &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Age of Fire&lt;/a&gt;, although his legitimacy as such only came from being a child of his father. He was worshiped as the \"&lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;God of the Darkmoon&lt;/a&gt;\" and held the tile of \"God the Dark Sun\".\nDespite being the son of Gwyn, Gwyndolin was born with a strong moon power and a weak and repulsive appearance\", particularly due to the snakes coiled around his lower half. Because of his dark moon power and his strong affinity for moon magic, as well as his lineage, Gwyndolin was raised as a female so that he could not officially become the king's heir. While still young, Gwyn made him to wear &lt;a href=\"Moonlight%20Set\"&gt;women's clothing&lt;/a&gt; and gave him a &lt;a href=\"Reversal%20Ring\"&gt;magic ring&lt;/a&gt; which would allow Gwyndolin to move and act in a feminine way, leading him to behave like a dark and fleeting goddess.\nDespite his severe upbringing, and having integrated into his identity the way other deities saw him as fragile and repulsive, Gwyndolin would grow up with a deep admiration for his father and an aspiration to become like him, wearing a crown with the design of the sun that was imbued with his dark moon magic. He accepted his place and role to the point of supporting his father's will even after his death and he took part in the workings of his kingdom. Although he was a deity of Anor Londo, Gwyndolin still grew into a powerful sorcerer, using a &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Bow\"&gt;golden bow, infused with strong magic&lt;/a&gt; and employing &lt;a href=\"Moonlight%20Arrow\"&gt;arrows of moonlight&lt;/a&gt;, and even a &lt;a href=\"Tin%20Darkmoon%20Catalyst\"&gt;catalyst&lt;/a&gt; for sorcery that employed faith and not intelligence of the user.\nAt some point Gwyndolin also became a figure of particular importance in &lt;a href=\"Oolacile\"&gt;Oolacile&lt;/a&gt;, where the deity was depicted in multiple statues displayed throughout the &lt;a href=\"Oolacile%20Township\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt;. He was represented with his &lt;a href=\"Moonlight%20Set\"&gt;moonlight robes&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Oolacile%20Ivory%20Catalyst\"&gt;catalyst of the country&lt;/a&gt;, implying that he had studied Oolacile sorcery and learned to use their catalysts. At some point, an immense arena was erected in Oolacile in which a ritual combat called the \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Stoicism\"&gt;Battle of Stoicism&lt;/a&gt;\" took place. The victorious warriors were welcomed to Anor Londo. Curiously, the structure where the fighting took place was covered in those same Gwyndolin statues.\nAfter his father Gwyn linked the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, his throne passed to his &lt;a href=\"The%20Nameless%20King\"&gt;firstborn son&lt;/a&gt; who, however, chose to \"ally\" with the dragons, the ancient enemies of the gods, and was therefore dethroned, exiled and his name eradicated from history. Following these events, his sister &lt;a href=\"Gwynevere%2C%20Princess%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; would abandon Anor Londo together with nearly all of the other deities leaving Gwyndolin as the last remaining deity in the city. Despite being the last son of the royal family of the gods, Gwyndolin was aware of his fragile and repulsive appearance and was therefore psychologically unfit to become the next ruler, still playing the feminine role imposed on him by his father Gwyn, even leaving &lt;a href=\"Allfather%20Lloyd\"&gt;Lloyd&lt;/a&gt; to take advantage of the situation and proclaiming himself king of the gods, thanks to the fact that he was Gwyn's uncle, and become the main god of the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20White\"&gt;Way of White&lt;/a&gt; . \nHe would instead create an illusion of his sister Gwynevere, to govern through her cherished figure and covering for her escape, taking upon himself to lead what remained of his father's kingdom and &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Knight\"&gt;Silver Knight&lt;/a&gt;s through this illusion but he didn't attempt to claim the throne for himself. Gwyndolin would also collaborate with &lt;a href=\"Kingseeker%20Frampt\"&gt;Kingseeker Frampt&lt;/a&gt; to maintain the system and religion created by his father to keep the First Flame and the Age of Fire alive, using the illusion of his sister Gwynevere as a key component in the system that sough a worthy champion to link the Flame again to guide and manipule potential Chosen Undead giving those who passed the challenges of &lt;a href=\"Sen%27s%20Fortress\"&gt;Sen's Fortress&lt;/a&gt; and defeated &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Slayer%20Ornstein%20and%20Executioner%20Smough\"&gt;Dragon Slayer Ornstein and Executioner Smough&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Lordvessel\"&gt;Lordvessel&lt;/a&gt; needed to access the &lt;a href=\"Kiln%20of%20the%20First%20Flame\"&gt;Kiln of the First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, while also maintaining some semblance of divinity and control over the ancient city. \nGwyndolin, however, did not remain passive and instead founded the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Darkmoon\"&gt;Blade of the Darkmoon&lt;/a&gt; covenant, welcoming knights into his service. Those adherent to the darkmoon deity were few but their task were of vital importance as these knights had the duty of hunting and punishing those who committed sins against the gods to inspire fear and respect for them between the humans and for this they were granted the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Eye%20Orb\"&gt;Blue Eye Orb&lt;/a&gt;s so that they could invade the time and place of the sinner and mete out the vengeance of the gods. For this eternal mandate, Gwyndolin would collaborate with &lt;a href=\"Velka%2C%20Goddess%20of%20Sin\"&gt;Velka, Goddess of Sin&lt;/a&gt;, who determined the sin and marked the sinners on her &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20the%20Guilty\"&gt;Book of the Guilty&lt;/a&gt; so that one day they would face the wrath of the blades of the darkmoon. Gwyndolin's followers would cut off an &lt;a href=\"Souvenir%20of%20Reprisal\"&gt;ear from the corpse of the sinners&lt;/a&gt; they vanquished, bringing them to their god as proof of their task accomplished, receiving Gwyndolin's &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Blade%20Covenant%20Ring\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Talisman\"&gt;talisman&lt;/a&gt; in return, and even learning of his &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Blade\"&gt;miracle&lt;/a&gt;, creating a sword with the rays of the darkmoon to manifest the vengance of their god.\nGwyndolin thus continued to remain hidden in his father's empty mausoleum, administering Anor Londo and continuing to carry out his father's will to continue the Age of Fire, punishing sinners and leading the Undead without even revealing himself openly.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough one day a &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt; managed to link the First Flame, ensuring that the Age of Fire and the rule of the gods continued, at some point remnants of the late inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; would leave Lordran and move to &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt;, founding the civilization of &lt;a href=\"Heide%27s%20Tower%20of%20Flame\"&gt;Heide&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, Heide's &lt;a href=\"Old%20Knight\"&gt;Knights&lt;/a&gt; still possessed the &lt;a href=\"Cracked%20Blue%20Eye%20Orb\"&gt;Cracked Blue Eye Orb&lt;/a&gt;s, the worn remains of the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Eye%20Orb\"&gt;Blue Eye Orb&lt;/a&gt;s that were granted to the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Blade\"&gt;Blades of the Darkmoom&lt;/a&gt; that served Gwyndolin to mete out the vengeance of the gods at the times of Anor Londo, thus implying that the original founders of Heide were once servants of Gwyndolin and part of his covenant.\nIn Heide would also have originated the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20Blue\"&gt;Way of Blue&lt;/a&gt;, which was not a developed religion but a humble prayer that spread naturally among those seeking help, but which eventually grew to the point that a huge &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Blue\"&gt;Cathedral of Blue&lt;/a&gt; was built in the heart of the city. In a similar way to the role played by the Blades of the Darkmoon, the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Sentinels\"&gt;Blue Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; would be formed, a group of knights tasked with defending the apostles of Blue from evil spirits by traveling between space and time thanks to the &lt;a href=\"Cracked%20Blue%20Eye%20Orb\"&gt;Cracked Blue Eye Orb&lt;/a&gt;s. Although this order continued to follow the ideals of their ancestors and protect the apostles of the Way of Blue even after the fall of Heide, knowledge of Anor Londo's deities and even their names was lost and their faith evolved towards seeking a higher plane through good deeds.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt a certain point Gwyndolin would decide to leave Gwyn's mausoleum, together with even the &lt;a href=\"Reversal%20Ring\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt; that made him take on feminine features, symbolizing a decisive change of mentality and the will to take action. Having regained his identity as Gwyn's son and therefore his legitimate heir, Gwyndolin would thus declare himself \"Main God\" as his right, taking the title away from the impostor that was &lt;a href=\"Allfather%20Lloyd\"&gt;Lloyd&lt;/a&gt;. Now at the command of the gods, Gwyndolin decided to restore prosperity to what remained of his kingdom, tracing the descendants of the gods thanks to their peculiar features and returning them to their ancestral home. In fact, &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt; was built on the ruins of Anor Londo: a new society made up of noble descendants of the gods that worshipped the moon. \nGwyndolin would in fact become the main figure of authority and worship in the new Anor Londo and a large cathedral would thus be built to venerate the new king of the gods in the center of the city, with statues depicting him with his serpentine features and face covered and with the rose window depicting the symbol of his &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20the%20Dark%20Sun\"&gt;crown&lt;/a&gt;.\nYet despite his important role, Gwyndolin would remain humble, preferring to live in a manor among the other similar homes in Irithyll. The building would be protected by the remaining &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Knight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Silver Knights&lt;/a&gt; who had served him for ages and the god would have accumulated in his home several artifacts from the history of Lordran and Drangleic and preserved paintings that told their story. Gwyndolin would also have created a cold climate around the region, ensuring that the moon always shone above Irithyll, thanks to a magic so powerful that it even infused the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Bug%20Pellet\"&gt;blue moon bugs&lt;/a&gt; native to the Boreal valley and leading to the evolution of &lt;a href=\"Rime-blue%20Moss%20Clump\"&gt;local vegetation&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring all this time Gwyndolin continued to manage his &lt;a href=\"Covenants%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Darkmoon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Blades of the Darkmoon&lt;/a&gt; which continued to exist from the age of the ancient royal gods of Anor Londo. The followers of this order would have been raised as elite knights who acted shrouded in shadow and continued to protect the interests of the gods and hunt down their foes. These knights were therefore no longer just Undead who followed the divinity of the moon but a real order with a specific structure, formation and training, in fact adopting a standard &lt;a href=\"Sunless%20Set\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; treated with silver with a feminine silhouette similar to that of Gwyndolin and capable of offering protection from magic and darkness while their &lt;a href=\"Sunless%20Talisman\"&gt;talismans&lt;/a&gt; scaled with intelligence and were compatible with Dark, as they were educated in this arts as an initial warning of the enemies that would have to face and the power they would have to fear. Gwyndolin's followers would continue the tradition of cutting off an &lt;a href=\"Proof%20of%20a%20Concord%20Kept\"&gt;ear from the corps of the sinners&lt;/a&gt; they vanquished, bringing them to their god as proof of their task accomplished, receiving Gwyndolin's &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Ring\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt; and learning of his &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Blade%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;miracle&lt;/a&gt; .\nAt some point Gwyndolin and his Darkmoon Knights would come into contact with the faith of the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20Blue%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Way of Blue&lt;/a&gt; that had originated in &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; and was now rooted in &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt; in particular. Having recognized their common origin, an &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20Blue%20%28item%29\"&gt;accord&lt;/a&gt; would have been formed: the Way of Blue would have recognized Gwyndolin as their ancient divinity, exposing the symbol of the moon as representative of their covenant and in exchange the Darkmoon Knights would have protected the members threatened by dark spirits. However, the Way of Blue was already tied to an agreement with the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Sentinels%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Blue Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, the original Darkmoon Knights, from the time of Drangleic in which they were in charge of their protection. Much later, Gwyndolin and his Darkmoon Knights would thus form a second, separate &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Sentinels%20%28item%29\"&gt;accord&lt;/a&gt; with the Blue Sentinels. They would have remained an independent organization but strongly linked to that of the Blades of the Darkmoon to the point of being almost identical. The Blue Sentinels would continue to perform the same task as the Blades of the Darkmoon and protect the members of the Way of Blue but they would also gain the same symbol as the Darkmoon Knights, i.e. the sword and the moon, and the same tradition of cutting off an &lt;a href=\"Proof%20of%20a%20Concord%20Kept\"&gt;ear from the corps of the sinners&lt;/a&gt; they vanquished and even received the same rewards as the knights serving Gwyndolin, thus implying how their organization was kept separate only to allow the god to have a wider margin of action and more soldiers.\nOne day even his sister &lt;a href=\"Gwynevere%2C%20Princess%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Gwynevere&lt;/a&gt; returned to her ancient home. In fact, in Irithyll the goddess was venerated with multiple statues displayed throughout the city and became the mother of several heavenly children such as &lt;a href=\"Rosaria%2C%20Mother%20of%20Rebirth\"&gt;Rosaria, Mother of Rebirth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dancer%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Dancer of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt;. The goddess would return to her location in the &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;old cathedral of Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;, protected by the remaining &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Knight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Silver Knights&lt;/a&gt; who had once protected her illusion. At some point, Gwyndolin would welcome a &lt;a href=\"Company%20Captain%20Yorshka\"&gt;young crossbreed girl without a name&lt;/a&gt; and knowledge of the world inside Irithyll, recognizing her as his sister from the same mother and forming a relationship of strong affection with her, as the god would give her a &lt;a href=\"Yorshka%27s%20Chime\"&gt;sacred chime&lt;/a&gt; and even the name of \"Yorshka\". Eventually even a &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Yorshka\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt; was built in her name inside Irithyll, exactly where the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariamis\"&gt;Painted World of Ariamis&lt;/a&gt; was once kept, in which she was venerated as a goddess by the &lt;a href=\"Irithyllian%20Slave\"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt; who worked in the city. At some point Gwyndolin would also take an interest in the affairs of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Ringed%20City%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Ringed City&lt;/a&gt;, potentially building the cathedral in which his sister &lt;a href=\"Filianore\"&gt;Filianore&lt;/a&gt; rests asleep, as the structure's gates are decorated with representations of the new king of the gods, and imposing by decree that none disturb her sleep, leaving an order of &lt;a href=\"Judicator%20Giant\"&gt;Judicator Giant&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Judicator%20Argo\"&gt;Judicator Argo&lt;/a&gt; to watch over her sister's slumber.\nOne day &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Sulyvahn\"&gt;Sulyvahn&lt;/a&gt;, a young sorcerer, would also arrive in Irithyll from the Painted World and would be welcomed among the inhabitants despite not being a descendant of the gods, earning Gwyndolin's favor thanks to a &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Ritual%20Spear\"&gt;crude replica of his magical catalyst&lt;/a&gt; presented to his Darkmoon Knights, demonstrating however the young man's talent. Eventually Sulyvahn would find the &lt;a href=\"Profaned%20Capital\"&gt;Profaned Capital&lt;/a&gt; deep within the region and the &lt;a href=\"Profaned%20Flame\"&gt;Profaned Flame&lt;/a&gt; contained therein, an unfading flame that would become the fuel and instrument of his ambitions. Armed with this new power, the young sorcerer would thus climb the ranks of Irithyll's clergy, corrupting the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Witch\"&gt;holy knights&lt;/a&gt; with the everlasting flame and transforming the &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Knight\"&gt;knights&lt;/a&gt; into his spies and assassins, effectively enforcing his way through their highest ranks.\nAt some point Gwyndolin would be \"stricken by illness\" and forced to retreat to the &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;old cathedral of Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;, entrusting his sister Yorshka with command of the covenant of the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Darkmoon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Blades of the Darkmoon&lt;/a&gt; and the leading of its knights against the enemies of the gods and to watch over those who linked the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, accepting the &lt;a href=\"Proof%20of%20a%20Concord%20Kept\"&gt;proofs&lt;/a&gt; of their accomplished duty and rewarding them with the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Blade%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;miracles of Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt;, even without knowledge of their meaning. However, &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Sulyvahn\"&gt;Sulyvahn&lt;/a&gt; would take advantage of the situation, declaring himself Pontiff and becoming the tyrant of Irihtyll, leveraging the influence he already had among the clergy and knights of the city. The man would thus imprison Yorshka on the tower of her own church, isolating her from the whole world and holding her hostage, without hearing a thing from her brother. In fact, immediately afterwards Sulyvahn would hold Gwyndolin himself hostage, locking him up in all respects in the old cathedral and using his position as pontiff, and therefore as \"voice of god\" to reign through his figure while also preventing unwanted foreign interventions.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; began to fade and &lt;a href=\"Lothric%2C%20Younger%20Prince\"&gt;Prince Lothric&lt;/a&gt; refused to link it, the &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lords of Cinder&lt;/a&gt; of the past were exhumed from their graves to once again be used as fuel. Among them was &lt;a href=\"Aldrich%2C%20Devourer%20of%20Gods\"&gt;Aldrich&lt;/a&gt;, once a cleric of Irithyll but transformed into an abysmal monstrosity due to his immeasurable hunger for humans that had made him \"worthy\" of linking the Flame. However, Aldrich had no intention of sacrificing himself again as his reflections on the state of the world had led him to understand that an &lt;a href=\"The%20Deep%23The_Age_of_Deep\"&gt;Age of the Deep&lt;/a&gt; would soon arrive, motivating him to try to devour the gods themselves to erode their hold on the Flame and accelerate the coming of his vision\nGathering an army of &lt;a href=\"Deacon\"&gt;deacons&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Cathedral of the Deep&lt;/a&gt;, Aldrich would thus move towards Irithyll to devour the king of the gods himself. However, he would find his way blocked by Sulyvahn and his &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Knight\"&gt;knights&lt;/a&gt;, as the pontiff had no intention of relinquishing the source of his control over the city and the Way of White so easily. Despite the battle, Aldrich emerged victorious, slaughtering Sulyvahn's troops and forcing him to clear the way for the ruined cathedral of Anor Londo. Having finally reached his prey, Aldrich would have begun to slowly devour Gwyndolin, who was most likely powerless to fight back, consuming his soul and gaining access to his memories of &lt;a href=\"Priscilla\"&gt;Priscilla&lt;/a&gt; through his dreams. \nHowever, once an &lt;a href=\"Unkindled\"&gt;Unkindled&lt;/a&gt; came to Irithyll to see another &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord of Cinder&lt;/a&gt; in their quest they would find Aldritch still through the consumption of Gwyndolin, forcing him had to take control of the body and powers of the dying god in order to defend himself. Once the Unkindled finally slew Aldritch, Gwyndolin would be released from his gruesome fate ending the his torment and finally allowing him to die.\nStrategies.\nGwyndolin's boss battle takes place in a seemingly never-ending corridor.\nHe is not a very difficult boss if the player has decent dodging skills. Of his three attacks, two can be avoided by hiding behind pillars, while the last one is more powerful and fast (he will tend to use the &lt;a href=\"%23Sphere%20Shot\"&gt;Sphere Shot&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"%23Orb%20Spread\"&gt;Orb Spread&lt;/a&gt; if the player is hiding behind pillars). The main issue in this fight is reaching him, as he will teleport away when the player approaches (equipping the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Fog\"&gt;Ring of Fog&lt;/a&gt; may increase the time available to attack before he teleports), meaning that the best time to run up to him is when he is just finishing off his &lt;a href=\"%23Arrow%20Spread\"&gt;Arrow Spread&lt;/a&gt;, as he takes a few moments to recover. Gwyndolin can still be damaged while he is in his teleporting animation and for a split second after actually moving, so it is possible to deal considerable damage at that moment.\nBoth the &lt;a href=\"%23Orb%20Spread\"&gt;Orb&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%23Arrow%20Spread\"&gt;Arrow Spread&lt;/a&gt; attacks are avoidable by hiding behind one of the pillars on either side of the corridor. The &lt;a href=\"%23Sphere%20Shot\"&gt;Sphere Shot&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, will go through walls, inflicting full damage if not blocked or avoided. The Orb Spread and Sphere Shot are &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;-based, though, so a shield that can block 100% &lt;a href=\"physical%20damage\"&gt;physical damage&lt;/a&gt; and has good Magic resistance, like the &lt;a href=\"Crest%20Shield\"&gt;Crest Shield&lt;/a&gt;, is recommended for this fight.\nWhile devastating, both the &lt;a href=\"%23Sphere%20Shot\"&gt;Sphere Shot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%23Arrow%20Spread\"&gt;Arrow Spread&lt;/a&gt; attacks have no tracking whatsoever and are easily avoided simply by running diagonally. If a player does not want to risk it too much, a good strategy to catch up to him is by moving from pillar to pillar until they are about two pillars away from Gwyndolin and then wait until he shoots his Arrow Spread. This attack can consist of two-to-four arrow barrages. Wait until he finishes the second one and go for him, if he shoots any subsequent arrows, dodge them by running diagonally.\nAlternatively, once Gwyndolin teleports the first time upon entering the tomb, it is possible to move closer to him to a point just outside his aggro range; then, by equipping the &lt;a href=\"Hawk%20Ring\"&gt;Hawk Ring&lt;/a&gt; and using the &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Greatbow\"&gt;Dragonslayer Greatbow&lt;/a&gt;, the player can easily defeat him from range without him retaliating.\nBoss information.\nAttacks.\nArrow Spread.\nGwyndolin will slightly raise up and shoot multiple arrows at the Player. Blockable as they do not use much stamina. Alternatively, the Player can stand behind the pillars so that the arrows hit the pillar instead.

He worships the Dark as \"the mother of all things\" and he firmly believes that by facing the Abyss one will discover the \"truest dark\" within himself. \u00a0\nPlot.\nGrandahl is found in three separate shrines throughout &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt;.

Through each of these shrines the player may access a different part of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Chasm\"&gt;Dark Chasm&lt;/a&gt;. The player's first journey into the Dark Chasm will be free, but be warned that if the player should die, future journeys require the sacrifice of a &lt;a href=\"Human%20Effigy\"&gt;Human Effigy&lt;/a&gt;.

Even in such a situation, its Attack Rating still lags behind most other katanas, making it one of the weakest in its class. However, it makes up for this with its ability to deal damage through raised shields, particularly when using strong attacks, allowing its wielder to cut through defensive foes with ease. Its &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; further augments this, eschewing the use of &lt;a href=\"Hold\"&gt;Hold&lt;/a&gt; for a lunging thrust that is capable of completely bypassing shields.\nFurthermore, despite being upgraded with &lt;a href=\"Twinkling%20Titanite%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Twinkling Titanite&lt;/a&gt;, Darkdrift can be buffed. Aside from making the weapon slightly stronger than initially apparent, this can be combined with its ability to pierce through shields to make it lethal against any foes that rely on their shields to protect themselves. Additionally, its low weight of 3.5 puts it more in line with &lt;a href=\"Straight%20Swords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;straight swords&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Curved%20Swords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;curved swords&lt;/a&gt; than katanas.

His eternal battle with the dark has begun to taint him, granting him the ability to channel abyss magic into his already destructive fire breath.\nAlthough he remains loyal to the gods, his time spent fighting the dark has begun to corrupt him and the &lt;a href=\"Spears%20of%20the%20Church\"&gt;Spears of the Church&lt;/a&gt; fear the consequences if he was ever lost completely. &lt;a href=\"Shira%2C%20Knight%20of%20Filianore\"&gt;Shira&lt;/a&gt; requests that the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20One\"&gt;Ashen One&lt;/a&gt; slays Midir before he is fully consumed by the abyss.\nLocation.\nDarkeater Midir can be first glimpsed upon entering the city, although he will not interact with the player until they reach the bridge past the abyssal swamp. He will initially wait on the cliff for the player to approach at which point he will swoop down and breathe fire along the bridge and connecting path.\nImmediately after exiting the &lt;a href=\"The%20Ringed%20City%20%28location%29%23Bonfires\"&gt;Shared Grave&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;, Midir will land on the bridge and block the path to the Church of &lt;a href=\"Filianore\"&gt;Filianore&lt;/a&gt;. After sustaining enough damage he will fall into the chasm under the bridge. A secret passage accessed via the &lt;a href=\"The%20Ringed%20City%20%28location%29%23Bonfires\"&gt;Ringed Inner Wall&lt;/a&gt;'s second shortcut leads to the chasm where Midir can be fought as the DLC's optional boss.\nLore.\nA descendant of the Archdragons and raised by the gods themselves, Midir was tasked with fighting against the abyss and its creations. His immortality enables him to perform his duties without end, even after the gods have long since perished. But his task has rendered him damaged beyond repair, as the dark has seeped into him and infected him (his title implies that he actually consumed potent sources of dark), and forms black crystals. It is not exactly clear whether or not he has been fully consumed, but he clearly feels the effects, able to use the dark in combat.\nWithin the memories of Midir is an old remembrance of a &lt;a href=\"Old%20Moonlight\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;, similar to that of Seath's moonlight power, but the memory was \"from not long after the Beginning\", implying that Midir was born even before the Lords' war against the dragons.\nStrategy.\nBridge ambush.\nWhen you approach the bridge after the &lt;a href=\"The%20Ringed%20City%20%28location%29%23Bonfires\"&gt;Shared Grave&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;, Midir will take a few moments to land allowing the player to position themselves underneath him. This will force him to rely mainly on physical attacks which can be more easily evaded than his fire breath. There is a large rock just before the bridge that the player can hide behind if they need to heal or buff a weapon.\nOne of Midir's most dangerous traits is his adaption to the player's strategies. If they hide behind the rock too much to evade his fire breath, he will direct it directly above them to flush them out. If they remain underneath him for a long period of time, he will fire a dark energy beam across the length of the bridge that will explode into a trail of dark flame, dealing heavy damage and often knocking the player into the abyss. Ranged weapons can be used to weaken him from the safety of the bonfire entrance but he will fly away after a few moments, forcing the player to lure him out again.\nBoss encounter.\nWhen fought as a boss, Midir possesses extremely high health (behind that of Sister Friede, Demon Prince and Yhorm the Giant) and strong defenses on all areas of his body, with the exception of his head. As such, the player should focus their attacks on this area regardless of his relentless lunges and fire breath.\nWhilst technically players could simply attack Midir's legs and tail, it is far too time-consuming, as it will take on average about twice the amount of hits to kill him this way, this turns an already difficult boss battle, into an endurance test that will, more often than not, result in players getting killed from attacks that Midir has to specifically counter the strategy of getting attacked in the legs and tail, such as fire breath attacks with that cover a wide area with lingering damage and a tail swipe of extreme range.\nAs such, players should target Midir's head, while taking certain things into consideration."}

The player will be transported to its arena once all beacons in the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Chasm%20of%20Old\"&gt;Dark Chasm of Old&lt;/a&gt; are lit and all three dungeons have been cleared. In order to access this boss, one must simply clear a chasm as normal once all of the conditions are met. This may be jarring, as the player may end up fighting it unprepared upon lighting the third beacon and clearing the third chasm.\nIt appears as a four-armed angelic humanoid, with its face completely obscured by a hood. Its lower arms are constantly folded across its chest.\nStrategy.\nThe Darklurker is weak to &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; and has moderate &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; resistance. It's extremely resistant to &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; damage. A high elemental defense, especially against &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; and Dark, is very effective, as the Darklurker deals no physical damage. A shield with overall high elemental defenses and &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"Rebel%27s%20Greatshield\"&gt;Rebel's Greatshield&lt;/a&gt;, can greatly reduce damage taken from many of its attacks.\nOnce the Darklurker's health drops below 60%, it will attempt to make a copy of itself, telegraphed by it creating a bright light and folding its wings around itself. During this phase, it can be staggered to postpone the split. An effective spell to use during this phase would be an area-of-effect &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;pyromancy&lt;/a&gt; spell, such as &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Swathe\"&gt;Flame Swathe&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Storm%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Chaos Storm&lt;/a&gt;, as both of the Darklurkers will take massive fire damage if they are caught in the blast.\nThe Darklurker is also susceptible to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Profound%20Still\"&gt;Profound Still&lt;/a&gt;, making this fight exponentially easier. The boss will limit itself to charging the player with its Dark melee attack and will sometimes attempt to use long range attacks to no avail.\nAttacks.\nDark Sword: The Darklurker raises its left hand to its right shoulder, materializing a white energy blade that it will then swing at the player. Has a relatively long delay compared to melee attacks by most other enemies, so be prepared to roll later rather than earlier to avoid. This attack deals Dark damage and can swing up to two times in a row. The swings can also be followed up with a stab.\nLaser Beam: The Darklurker flaps its wings and floats above the arena, firing off a bright, slow-moving beam of Dark after a short delay. Has some tracking and can deal tremendous damage if it hits, but cannot hit targets that are directly below it. While it is best to keep moving to avoid the beam, the Darklurker is vulnerable to ranged attacks and spells while firing the beam.\nDark Spear: Raises its left arm into the air to point straight up, then fires a Dark bolt that resembles a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Soul Spear&lt;/a&gt;. Has relatively poor tracking and can be easily dodged by rolling, but has a very small delay and can catch unprepared players by surprise.\nDark Meteor: The Darklurker will raise its right arm and point upward. A black portal will appear above the Darklurker and another will appear somewhere else in the arena. The Darklurker will send a dark orb into the portal above it, which will then emerge from the other portal and fly toward the player, exploding in a moderate sized area of effect. Has moderate homing, so jumping on top of rolling may be necessary to avoid.\nFire Balls: Raises all four arms into the air, creating a large orange orb above it, then launches three fireballs from it after a delay. Has no tracking and can be avoided by running to the side.\nExplosion: The Darklurker gathers its arms together and leans backward. It then creates an explosion in a wide area around it, dealing heavy damage. The area is somewhat wider in front of it.\nSplit: When the Darklurker reaches around 60% health, it will cross all of its arms around itself, fold its wings in, and a purple cloud will appear around it and focus in. The Darklurker will then split into two; it is vulnerable to attacks during and shortly after this spell. Both share the boss's HP and must be fought at once as the fight goes on. The copy is identical to the original, and both can use any of the Darklurker's attacks and spells at any time. Note that while this move can be stopped through staggering, the time window for doing so is extremely small as the move only takes about two to three seconds.\nDefenses.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 Darklurker by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-2K3Z_mhHY&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

The fight should be handled similarly to the earlier &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Slayer%20Ornstein%20and%20Executioner%20Smough\"&gt;boss fight&lt;/a&gt; and successfully splitting up the two leads to a huge advantage in this fight."}

Using the Darksign does not affect the previous bloodstain left by the player, which will still be available for reclamation.\nLore.\nGwyn had foreseen the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Dark\"&gt;Age of Dark&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Age of Fire&lt;/a&gt; and, fearing the infinite potential of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Soul\"&gt;Dark Soul&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=\"Furtive%20Pygmy\"&gt;Furtive Pygmy&lt;/a&gt; found and the &lt;a href=\"Humanity\"&gt;Humanity&lt;/a&gt; that inherited it, he forced a ring of fire around the Dark Soul to contain its powers and making every new human assume a weakened form and bear the Darksign. In addition, various groups were created to encourage worshipping Gwyn and his kin as Gods, such as the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20White\"&gt;Way of White&lt;/a&gt;, the oldest and most powerful cultural organization centered around the veneration of the &lt;a href=\"Gods%23Gods%2520and%2520Goddesses%2520of%2520Anor%2520Londo\"&gt;gods of Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;, who spread &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Miracles&lt;/a&gt; to humans and cultivated the cult of the Age of Fire and the linking of the Flame.\nCenturies after this abuse, the First Flame started to naturally fade out, and the Darksign, which used the power of the Flame to contain the Dark Soul, weakened too, leading humans to come back to life as &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt;, but also cursing them to eventually become &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;Hollow&lt;/a&gt;s, as the Darksign would consume their Humanity still forced on their bodies.\nThus, Gwyn sacrificed himself to rekindle the First Flame and forcibly postpone the end of the Age of Fire. Now with a martyr figure to use as powerful propaganda, the Undead Prophecy was spread throughout Lordran to encourage all who bear the Darksign to come to Lordran and claim powerful souls, making them worthy of filling the &lt;a href=\"Lordvessel\"&gt;Lordvessel&lt;/a&gt; and succeed Lord Gwyn, rekindling the dying flame and prolonging the Age of Fire. The &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt; would find themselves nearly hollow for several centuries after the rekindling of the First Flame, bearing the cursed mark of the Darksign, the greatest sin against humanity. \nOverview.\nIt is seldom advantageous to use the Darksign. Death is usually preferable, as humanity and souls can at least be recovered. The use of &lt;a href=\"Homeward%20Bone\"&gt;Homeward Bone&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Homeward\"&gt;Homeward&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;miracle&lt;/a&gt; also sends players back to previous bonfires, but without the penalty of losing souls and humanity.\nUsage of the Darksign can, however, be occasionally advantageous. Since it does not cause previous bloodstains to disappear, it may be preferable to use it over dying if players are faced with a dangerous situation and do not wish to permanently replace their old, valuable bloodstain with a new and relatively worthless one. The Darksign can be used if a player is stuck through glitching or some accident that caused them to be trapped, and does not have &lt;a href=\"Homeward\"&gt;Homeward&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Homeward%20Bone\"&gt;Homeward Bone&lt;/a&gt;s at hand. Manual use of the Darksign also does not cause un-hollowed status to be forfeited the way death would, so it's viable to use it instead of homeward bone if the player has less than 500 souls.\nThe Darksign can also be used when being invaded, but also having a bloodstain to recover."}

If they accept, they then kneel on the ground and teleport, surrounded by a red ring. It takes considerable time to warp, and it can be interrupted by enemies. The Darksign and other warping items cannot be used if player or NPC invaders/phantoms are present.\nAs the item suggests, all souls on-hand will be \"permanently lost\" when using the Darksign. However, it does not further hollow the player nor does it update the most recent &lt;a href=\"Bloodstain\"&gt;Bloodstain&lt;/a&gt;. It can be used an unlimited amount of times, unlike Homeward Bones. Its uses are limited, however, and should only be used as a last resort when no Homeward Bones are possessed or the souls lost are few. The &lt;a href=\"Aged%20Feather\"&gt;Aged Feather&lt;/a&gt; has the same effect except no souls are lost, making it a direct upgrade.\nUse of the Darksign and other bonfire-warping items reset the area and all respawnable enemies, but it does not reset the character nor does it count as resting. This is useful in no bonfire runs as it will return the player back to the most recently lit bonfire. However, note that &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Estus Flasks&lt;/a&gt; and spell casts will not recharge as a result.\nThis item, along with the &lt;a href=\"Aged%20Feather\"&gt;Aged Feather&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Homeward%20Bone%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Homeward Bones&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Miracle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Homeward%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Homeward&lt;/a&gt; will warp you back to the spawn gazebo in &lt;a href=\"Things%20Betwixt\"&gt;Things Betwixt&lt;/a&gt; if both the Fire Keeper's Dwelling in Things Betwixt and The Far Fire in &lt;a href=\"Majula\"&gt;Majula&lt;/a&gt; are unlit, potentially as a softlock prevention measure and/or a default warp location."}

To access it, the player first needs to obtain a &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Tongue\"&gt;Pale Tongue&lt;/a&gt;. Once acquired, the player must talk to &lt;a href=\"Ringfinger%20Leonhard\"&gt;Leonhard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt;, who will then give them the &lt;a href=\"Lift%20Chamber%20Key\"&gt;Lift Chamber Key&lt;/a&gt;. The key unlocks the door to a lift downstairs from the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20on%20the%20Wall\"&gt;Tower on the Wall&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;, which takes the player to fight a special Darkwraith that drops the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Eye%20Orb%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Red Eye Orb&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Age of Fire&lt;/a&gt;, the Darkwraiths, once the knights of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Kings\"&gt;Four Kings&lt;/a&gt;, took upon duty guarding &lt;a href=\"New%20Londo\"&gt;New Londo&lt;/a&gt;. However, when &lt;a href=\"Kaathe\"&gt;Kaathe&lt;/a&gt; provoked these knights and taught them to use the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Hand%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark Hand&lt;/a&gt;, they became such a threat that &lt;a href=\"Ingward\"&gt;Ingward&lt;/a&gt;, and other two sealers, flooded the entire city just to keep them at bay. Now, in the time of &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt;, the remaining of these once praised knights can be encountered lurking in the &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Keep\"&gt;Farron Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nDarkwraiths are aggressive opponents and will attempt to &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Break\"&gt;break&lt;/a&gt; the player's guard with a kick before unleashing powerful combos that can easily kill them if they are unable to retaliate. They retain their &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Hand%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;dark shield&lt;/a&gt; to block against attacks and can &lt;a href=\"lifedrain\"&gt;lifedrain&lt;/a&gt; the player for high damage.\nThe Darkwraith found in the swamp is immune to &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; and is not hindered by the thick water, so it is advisable to defeat it on dry land. The two outside the &lt;a href=\"Abyss%20Watchers\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; room can be lured away separately with ranged weapons and can also be distracted by the &lt;a href=\"Ghru\"&gt;Ghru&lt;/a&gt;s, allowing the player to attack them unnoticed. Be warned, though, that they will focus on the player over the other enemies if they detect them.\nDarkwraiths don't have a varied repertoire of attacks and they will use the same combos frequently. Once the player has learned their attack patterns, they may develop proper strategies to know when to attack. They have very high &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt; and practically cannot be &lt;a href=\"stagger\"&gt;stagger&lt;/a&gt;ed, so it's advisable to attack only once and then retreat. Since their attacks come in quick succession and drain a high amount of &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;, blocking is not recommended, lest they break the player's guard and end up dealing a high amount of damage.\nAfter stepping off the lift, take a few steps forward, so you can backstep and activate it again. Hit the Darkwraith with an arrow, which will lure it to you. Once it's close enough to attack (it has a very long range, beware) backstep onto the lift and the Darkwraith will fall under the lift and die.\nEasy way to get the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Eye%20Orb%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Red Eye Orb&lt;/a&gt;. Only drawback is if it drops an item, you cannot retrieve it."}

Being a spellcaster, she will often leave herself open to attack in close combat. In addition, she will usually dwindle near the edge of the cliff, setting herself for an easy kill by pushing her off. Since she doesn't drop anything upon defeat in this location, this is perhaps the best course of action for dealing with her.\nThe player should be aware of a &lt;a href=\"Gravetender%20Hollow\"&gt;Gravetender Hollow&lt;/a&gt; lying on the left wall of the same area, which should be disposed of as soon as possible lest he meddles at an inconvenient moment during the fight.\nWhen encountered in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt;, she will attack along with two other powerful enemies: &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Knight%20Albert\"&gt;Lion Knight Albert&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hand%20Kamui\"&gt;Black Hand Kamui&lt;/a&gt;. She will mainly act as support for her two companions by holding ground at a distance while casting spells. It's not recommended to fight all three of them at once, and instead draw them in one at a time with ranged attacks.\nA strategy that can be applied to all three of them is the use of &lt;a href=\"Dung%20Pie%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dung Pies&lt;/a&gt;. Make a run for the elevator shortcut and reload the area; they will be visible from the elevator exit and will not trigger from this position unless damaged by a weapon. Since Dung Pies inflict &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Toxic&lt;/a&gt; build-up but don't cause physical damage, they can be thrown without triggering them. They can quickly be killed afterward with a &lt;a href=\"Throwing%20Knife%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Throwing Knife&lt;/a&gt; once their health has been depleted.\nShe will very frequently attempt to parry the player.

Their leader, Archdeacon Royce, is a &lt;a href=\"Characters%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;character&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nLocation.\nFound in the innermost chamber of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Cathedral of the Deep&lt;/a&gt;, where the tomb of Aldrich lies. The room is located further from the main praying area, beyond an immense and almost ruined statue concealed in canvas.\nLore.\nRoyce was an archdeacon of the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20White\"&gt;Way of White&lt;/a&gt; and one of the religious eminences of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Cathedral of the Deep&lt;/a&gt;, together with &lt;a href=\"Archdeacon%20Klimt\"&gt;Archdeacon Klimt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archdeacon%20McDonnell\"&gt;Archdeacon McDonnell&lt;/a&gt;, managing the structure and the rituals of purification from the stagnant Darkness that took place therethanks to a peaceful and sacred body of water.\nAt one point, the cathedral welcomed &lt;a href=\"Aldrich%2C%20Devourer%20of%20Gods\"&gt;Aldrich&lt;/a&gt;, a priest from Irithyll that took pleasure in eating humans and continued to do it until his own body collapsed into sludge. The abomination that was Aldrich shared his perverse behaviour to others in the cathedral and sacrifices were brought to him to appease his hunger and grant him the strength to be able to link the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; and become a &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;. \nEven after Aldrich linked the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; a cult formed around his figure, but the deacons of the cathedral found themselves fighting the abominations that emerged from this &lt;a href=\"The%20Deep\"&gt;Deep&lt;/a&gt;: what was once the peaceful and sacred structure in which ritual purifications took place began to become an accumulation of corruption, where the darkness stagnated and accumulated until it became the final rest of many abhorrent creatures. McDonnel found delight in the stagnation of darkness, realizing that it would become the foundation of the world and thus abandoned his faith in the First Flame and in the gods to place it in the rising Deep. McDonnel spread his new belief among the other clerics of the cathedral along with his sorcery as created staffs who channeled faith in the Deep to produce dark sorceries and in time the cathedral's deacons became both clergymen and sorcerers, embracing the cult of the Deep. Royce too allowed himself to be corrupted by the putrid darkness that had invaded the cathedral and, in addition to accepting McDonnel's sorceries of the Deep, he began to venerate the Deep and its Saint, Aldrich.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; began to fade and &lt;a href=\"Lothric%2C%20Younger%20Prince\"&gt;Prince Lothric&lt;/a&gt; refused to link it, Aldrich was awakened from his tomb to become fuel for it again but the previous Lord of Cinder refused. Aldrich was in fact intent on returning to Irithyll to devour &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Dark Sun Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt; and open the &lt;a href=\"Deep\"&gt;Age of the Deep&lt;/a&gt;, bringing to an end the Age of Fire and leaving in its place a realm of putrid and stagnant darkness in which the Saint would be at the top. McDonnel, sharing Aldrich's ideals, cast off his white robes and replaced them with robes of deep blue. The Archdeacon gathered an army of deacons and evangelists and thus abandoned the cathedral to follow the Saint of the Deep on his crusade toward Irithyll.\nWhen Aldrich and McDonnell left the cathedral for their crusade, Royce and the other deacons stayed to guard their lord's empty coffin from intruders, in the hopes that he would one day return.. The &lt;a href=\"Road%20of%20Sacrifices\"&gt;Road of Sacrifices&lt;/a&gt; system that brought Undead from the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Undead Settlement&lt;/a&gt; to the Cathedral and prepared them to be devoured by Aldrich continued to operate, and Royce devoted himself to the study of the Deep, allowing the merging of his soul and those of the other deacons, and the development of dark sorceries close to the grave of their Saint.\nDescription.\nAs their name implies, the Deacons of the Deep is a large gathering of &lt;a href=\"Deacon\"&gt;Deacon&lt;/a&gt;s, who mainly rely on &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;pyromancies&lt;/a&gt; and close ranged melee attacks to attack the player. They will engage the player in combat, with one of the Deacons glowing with a red aura. Defeating this Deacon will deal damage to the boss's health bar, and cause the light to dissipate and search for another Deacon. Throughout the battle, new Deacons will spawn from Aldrich's coffin as they are defeated.\nOnce five glowing Deacons have been killed, Archdeacon Royce will reveal himself; Royce can be readily identified by the red glow, as well as the large blue-tipped staff and miter. He will spawn with two big and blue-robed Deacons and four additional heavyset Deacons, who will cast &lt;a href=\"Force%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Force&lt;/a&gt; when near the player in order to protect Royce. At certain points, they will channel a healing spell to quickly regenerate Royce's health.\nStrategy.\nDamaging or killing individual Deacons does not deal damage to the collective boss health bar, rather this is done by killing the Deacon with the red aura. Each time the target Deacon is defeated, roughly 327 damage is dealt to the health bar and the aura will move to another Deacon. For this reason, it is a viable strategy to try to reduce the health of the individual Deacons without killing them, as the aura may find a weakened one who can then be quickly dispatched. If the player does not kill a glowing Deacon within a certain amount of time, the aura may relocate to a different one.\nBe mindful that while large sweeping attacks can hit and kill multiple Deacons at once, this can place the player in unnecessary danger. If possible, try to path around the crowd to attack the glowing Deacon directly, as this avoids the situation of being within melee attack range of multiple Deacons.\nOnce enough damage has been dealt to the boss health bar, Archdeacon Royce will appear, flanked by two large blue-robed Deacons as well as four red-robed ones. It is highly recommended to kill these two blue Deacons as quickly as possible, as they are considerably stronger than the others, can heal Royce, and will not respawn once killed. From this point onward, only damage dealt to Royce will subtract from the boss health bar.\nOnce Archdeacon Royce is on the field, the collective Deacons gain a number of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; attacks to use along with their previous attacks. However, these attacks can be interrupted either through attacking the channeling Deacons or Royce himself.\nMelee weapons are the best option for defeating the Deacons of the Deep without too much trouble. Any weapon with wide swings will deal great damage to multiple Deacons, allowing players to easily clear a path to the glowing one, however a fast-swinging &lt;a href=\"Straight%20Swords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;straight sword&lt;/a&gt; gives less opportunity to be staggered by the Deacons' attacks.\nSpellcasters can struggle with this fight as there are few &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;area-of-effect&lt;/a&gt; spells available to the player at the time of encountering the boss. Additionally, the Deacons are resistant to &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; damage, making this fight a particular challenge to dedicated &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; builds.

Since the deacons tend to remain close together, &lt;a href=\"Pestilent%20Mist\"&gt;Pestilent Mist&lt;/a&gt; is also helpful in bringing them down, and while the deacons (and Royce himself) are resistant to poison/toxic, they are not immune to it, so the &lt;a href=\"Storyteller%27s%20Staff\"&gt;Storyteller's Staff&lt;/a&gt; weapon art &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Spores\"&gt;Poison Spores&lt;/a&gt; will deal a great bit of damage.\n&lt;a href=\"Alluring%20Skull%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Alluring Skulls&lt;/a&gt; will distract all of the Deacons except for the one with the red aura, making it easy to separate it from the group and kill it."}

The explosion causes a large amount of damage, which stacks with each corpse that detonates. The corpses all explode at the same time, allowing for potentially massive amounts of damage against an opponent; however, it also means that players with good timing can dodge all explosions without incurring damage. The corpses are not consumed after detonation, meaning they can be reused repeatedly. However, the hex can only be cast when dead bodies are in the area.

It is important to note that the bloodstain is usually left in a place a few moments back in time. Meaning, if a player falls off a cliff then clips another ledge before falling into a kill plane, the bloodstain will be near the location of where they originally fell from.\nHowever, if a player does not retrieve their last bloodstain before they die a second time, a new bloodstain will replace the previous one, permanently losing the souls and humanity of the first bloodstain.\nPhantom Death.\nIf a player dies as a friendly &lt;a href=\"Cooperative%20Gameplay\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt;, they will be sent back to the bonfire in whichever status they entered the hosts world in.

It has sparse, matted fur and six wolf-like limbs connected to a bloated body. It's head is round and flat, with two blank eyes and a mouth of sharp teeth with two side mandibles. They attack with a deadly breath that causes &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt; and powerful bites and body slams. Despite its size, the beast is capable of leaping very high into the air before crashing down onto anything underneath.\nOnly two Deep Accursed are encountered in the game and do not respawn once defeated.\nLocations.\n&lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Cathedral of the Deep&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;\nStrategy.\nThe first Deep Accursed ambushes the player in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Cathedral of the Deep&lt;/a&gt;, in a small chamber behind the first &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20Knight\"&gt;Cathedral Knight&lt;/a&gt;. It descends from the ceiling without warning and can be a challenging opponent in that cramped space. However, it is unable to leave the room due to its small archway and can be defeated with ranged attacks from a safe distance.\nThe creature is initially perched to the ceiling of this chamber, although it cannot be seen. As soon as the player sets foot inside, a countdown will start and the monster will drop after a few seconds, facing the far wall. The player can just step inside, exit, and wait for the creature to drop, allowing them to start the fight preemptively with a powerful attack from behind.\nThe Deep Accursed in &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; is visible on the ceiling in the grand hall and will drop down when the player tries to reach the switch to open the main doors. The pillars can be used as cover. However, a safer strategy is to retreat up one of the staircases and slay it from a distance. Whilst the beast cannot reach the player, it will frequently jump into the air to re-position itself, and can cause damage if the player is too close. If the player remains out of its sight long enough, the monster may calm down again, allowing them to resume the fight with a &lt;a href=\"Plunging%20Attack%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;plunging attack&lt;/a&gt;."}

It requires a high amount of &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; to wield properly and requires\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Twinkling%20Titanite%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Twinkling Titanite&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to upgrade.\nAvailability.\nOne of the possible items received by trading with &lt;a href=\"Dyna%20%26amp%3B%20Tillo\"&gt;Dyna &amp; Tillo&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Things%20Betwixt\"&gt;Things Betwixt&lt;/a&gt;, though using &lt;a href=\"Petrified%20Something\"&gt;Petrified Something&lt;/a&gt; has the greatest chance.\nCharacteristics.\nThe Demon's Great Hammer could arguably be considered an inferior version to the &lt;a href=\"Drakekeeper%27s%20Great%20Hammer\"&gt;Drakekeeper's Great Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. While the latter starts out dealing considerably less damage, once they have been fully upgraded they deal the same amount of damage, even when &lt;a href=\"Infusion\"&gt;infused&lt;/a&gt;, and they also share the same &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt; in all their respective areas. It's also heavier and less durable, although it must be noted that it has longer reach.\nHowever, one big advantage this weapon has over the Drakekeeper's Great Hammer is that it's possible to find it very early in the game as a random drop from &lt;a href=\"Dyna%20%26amp%3B%20Tillo\"&gt;Dyna and Tillo&lt;/a&gt;, as it has a chance to be given in trade for most kinds of stones (&lt;a href=\"Small%20Smooth%20%26amp%3B%20Silky%20Stone\"&gt;small&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Smooth%20%26amp%3B%20Silky%20Stone\"&gt;smooth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Petrified%20Something\"&gt;petrified&lt;/a&gt;), whereas the Drakekeeper's Great Hammer is only available towards the end of the game and as a very rare drop from a single great hammer-wielding &lt;a href=\"Drakekeeper\"&gt;Drakekeeper&lt;/a&gt; found in the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shrine\"&gt;Dragon Shrine&lt;/a&gt;. However, it may be somewhat challenging to upgrade the Demon's Great Hammer even if one gets it early, due to the fact that it upgrades with &lt;a href=\"Twinkling%20Titanite%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Twinkling Titanite&lt;/a&gt;."}

If a player were wanting to use this weapon it is only advisable to get to the minimum &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; of 31 in order to two hand as the 46 overall Strength requirement goes over the softcap of 40 Strength.

Since it scales from three different stats, it can surpass most weapons in attack damage at very high soul levels. This is compounded by the fact that many enemies in the game are vulnerable to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, it is ideal for players progressing through higher &lt;a href=\"New%20Game%20Plus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;New Game Plus&lt;/a&gt; playthroughs.\nThe Demon's Greataxe is also a strong contender in PvP. The weapon art, &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Flare\"&gt;Demonic Flare&lt;/a&gt;, provides very high poise and unleashes a massive area-of-affect blast, making it an ideal choice for facing multiple foes at once. It also consumes noticeably less stamina than other greataxes."}

Combining the light curved sword &lt;a href=\"Movesets%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;moveset&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Scimitar%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Scimitar&lt;/a&gt; with the power to cast &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Pyromancies&lt;/a&gt;, it boasts an extremely low &lt;a href=\"weight\"&gt;weight&lt;/a&gt; and is the only weapon in the game to deal purely &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage.\nBy using the strong attack, whether one-handing, two-handing or off-handing, the player will cast the currently equipped Pyromancy. This gives the weapon great flexibility, as the wielder is capable of unleashing an onslaught of quick slash attacks, and mix it with various Pyromancies for fast and deadly combinations, such as blasting a foe with &lt;a href=\"Black%20Flame%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Black Flame&lt;/a&gt; after staggering them with an attack. Because it uses the light curved sword moveset, it is uniquely suited to being wielded in the off-hand, as it will retain the ability to attack and cast Pyromancies, leaving the main hand open to equip a heavier weapon.\nHowever, this comes at the cost of being unable to perform the strong attacks usually associated with light curved swords, limiting the Demon's Scar's moveset to horizontal slashes. As well, the lower scaling means that Pyromancies cast using this weapon will generally be weaker than those cast from a standard Pyromancy Flame, or even a &lt;a href=\"Pyromancer%27s%20Parting%20Flame\"&gt;Pyromancer's Parting Flame&lt;/a&gt;. While it is indeed a very flexible weapon, this comes at the cost of overall strength.\nUnlike other curved swords, the scaling on this weapon dictates that it is useful only for Pyromancer builds, as the majority of its damage output comes from leveling &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt;, with only poor returns from leveling &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;. As well, its &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Buff\"&gt;Spell Buff&lt;/a&gt; will scale only with Intelligence and Faith.\nThe &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; of this weapon is a modified version of the normal &lt;a href=\"Spin%20Slash%20%28Scimitar%29\"&gt;Spin Slash&lt;/a&gt; of other light curved swords. Beyond dealing purely Fire damage, the strong attack ending with the vertical slam will leave a lava pool at the impact point, much like other Chaos Pyromancies.\nMoveset.\n&lt;br&gt;\nUpgrades.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

They continued to experiment with the power of fire and souls; at a certain point, driven by ambition and arrogance, Izalith, using her own Lord Soul as a basis, tried to recreate the \"First Flame\": the primordial force that had brought life into the world. This, however, was not entirely successful because the result was a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Flame of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, an unstable power that the witch was unable to control. She was initially consumed by it and became a beast of chaos fire along with two of her daughters: the \"&lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;\". This creature, fueled by the power of the Flame of Chaos, became a seedbed for a new life form: &lt;a href=\"Demon%20%28lore%29\"&gt;Demons&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first demon who manifested itself was the youngest son of Izalith. He was a younger brother of the other witches who gifted him a magic ring to protect him from the lava that tortured him. However, the still-unstable Flame of Chaos led him to transform into a &lt;a href=\"Ceaseless%20Discharge\"&gt;monstrous demon&lt;/a&gt; and drop his ring, leaving the flames of chaos to burn him constantly as he couldn't control them, while also generating another distorted &lt;a href=\"Centipede%20Demon\"&gt;Centipede Demon&lt;/a&gt;. Despite becoming the first distorted creature created by the Flame of Chaos, at a certain point Izalith and her daughters managed to stabilize the new power they had created and began to generate the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Firesage\"&gt;first real demons&lt;/a&gt;: life forms with stable bodies and capable of controlling the flame of chaos within each of them. These new creatures were not absolutely beastly; rather, they learned to coexist with the already-present society of Izalith, becoming \"demon priests\" of the Flame of Chaos and even going so far as to learn the primordial flame sorceries from their Lord and her daughters. The city of Izalith expanded to accommodate its new citizens, building &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Ruins\"&gt;structures for the demons&lt;/a&gt; on its borders.\nAt one point Izalith, aiming to gain greater sway over the Flame of Chaos, lost all control of the power again and never regained it: Chaos engulfed the Lord and her daughters before scorching their city with them. Izalith and her two daughters directly involved in the experiment were left permanently scarred, reduced to a monstrous lignified creature anchored in the throne room at the center of the city. Of the daughters of Izalith, few managed to escape. &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Witch%20Quelaag\"&gt;Quelaag&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Quelaag%27s%20Sister\"&gt;sister&lt;/a&gt;'s lower bodies were molded into deformed demonic spiders and the flames of chaos engulfed them but they managed to escape the city and survive on its borders, carving out a &lt;a href=\"Quelaag%27s%20Domain\"&gt;domain&lt;/a&gt; for themselves. The only other survivor, who managed to avoid the corruption of chaos and retain a normal body, was &lt;a href=\"Quelana%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Quelana&lt;/a&gt;, who remained in self-imposed exile around the ruins of her country for centuries\nThe societal collapse of Izalith, left without their Lord and devoured by the out-of-control Flame of Chaos, pushed Gwyn to wage war against the chaos demons that were now free, developing weapons and fighting techniques strong enough to face the size of their new enemies and sending his &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Knight\"&gt;Silver Knight&lt;/a&gt;s to Izalith. During the war their armor and weapons were charred black but despite their strength Gwyn's knights failed to defeat the demons or destroy the Bed of Chaos; they eventually retreated, only managing to banish the demons underground although they enslaved some &lt;a href=\"Batwing%20Demon\"&gt;lesser demons&lt;/a&gt; who would become servants of the gods. At some point after Gwyn linked the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Nameless%20King\"&gt;Gwyn's firstborn son&lt;/a&gt; was dethroned and exiled , nearly all of the other deities abandoned Anor Londo. Despite the conflict many demons survived and during all this time the Bed of Chaos continued to generate new demons; with no leadership present in Anor Londo and the Silver Knights remaining relegated to protecting the city of the gods, some lesser &lt;a href=\"Capra%20Demon\"&gt;Capra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taurus%20Demon\"&gt;Taurus&lt;/a&gt; demons began to rise to the surface, making their way through the ruins of the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Burg\"&gt;Undead Burg&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt; was able to ring the &lt;a href=\"Bells%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Bells of Awakening&lt;/a&gt;, overcome the challenges of &lt;a href=\"Sen%27s%20Fortress\"&gt;Sen's Fortress&lt;/a&gt; and reach &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; thus being rewarded with the &lt;a href=\"Lordvessel\"&gt;Lordvessel&lt;/a&gt;, they would be guided by &lt;a href=\"Kingseeker%20Frampt\"&gt;Kingseeker Frampt&lt;/a&gt; to find immense souls to fill the receptacle and link the fading &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; to succeed Gwyn in his sacrifice. The Undead would thus have delved into the dangerous and pestilent &lt;a href=\"Blighttown\"&gt;Blighttown&lt;/a&gt; until they reached the edges of the ancient domain of Izalith. Here their path would be blocked by the half-demon daughter of Izalith &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Witch%20Quelaag\"&gt;Chaos Witch Quelaag&lt;/a&gt; but, after killing her, the Undead was able to gain access to the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Ruins\"&gt;Demon Ruins&lt;/a&gt;. Making their way through the demons that infested the area, they reached the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Izalith\"&gt;lost city of Izalith&lt;/a&gt; and the throne room where Izalith, turned into the distorted &lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; rested, still fused with her two daughters and her original body reduced to that of a &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Bug\"&gt;Chaos Bug&lt;/a&gt; under all her roots. The Chosen Undead thus challenged and killed her to obtain her powerful Lord Soul. The destruction of the original Flame of Chaos ended Izalith's misery, but it also marked the beginning of the end for the demons who, without the Bed of Chaos that had spawned them, began to become a dying race.\nAlthough the lower half of their bodies were transformed into a chaos spider, Quelaag and her sister managed to carve out a &lt;a href=\"Quelaag%27s%20Domain\"&gt;domain&lt;/a&gt; for themselves on the edge of the realm of Izalith, near what was called &lt;a href=\"Blighttown\"&gt;Blighttown&lt;/a&gt;. While the older Quelaag maintained control over their refuge thanks to her strength, the younger one, who was a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Keeper\"&gt;Fire Keeper&lt;/a&gt; and had an immense amount of &lt;a href=\"Humanity%20%28item%29\"&gt;humanity&lt;/a&gt; within her, began producing eggs by the dozen, until they covered their entire lair. \nIn time, the Undead exiled to the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Burg\"&gt;Undead Burg&lt;/a&gt; and who had ended up in the rotten Blighttown chose to serve the Flame of Chaos and the two demonic daughters of Izalith of their own free will. \nAs a symbol of their dedication they became &lt;a href=\"Egg%20Burdened\"&gt;Egg Burdened&lt;/a&gt;, welcoming the parasitic eggs produced by Quelaag's sister into their bodies. In this way the eggs would hatch inside them, first producing &lt;a href=\"Vile%20Maggot\"&gt;Vile Maggot&lt;/a&gt;s which would then develop into &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Mosquito\"&gt;Giant Mosquito&lt;/a&gt;es and ultimately into smaller insectoid demons: the &lt;a href=\"Cragspider\"&gt;Cragspider&lt;/a&gt;s\nQuelaag's plan, with the help of her sister, was therefore to reproduce in miniature a version of the Bed of Chaos that would use humanity as fertilizer for eggs and the undead as hosts to create new, albeit lesser, demons. To receive help in their goal they even created the covenant of the &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Servant\"&gt;Chaos Servant&lt;/a&gt;s, which would welcome servants of the Daughter of Chaos with the aim of accumulating humanity by killing other Undead which they would then give to Quelaag's sister and in exchange get the chance to learn their &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Storm\"&gt;pyromancies&lt;/a&gt; and a shortcut to their hometown of &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Izalith\"&gt;Lost Izalith&lt;/a&gt; \nThe sorcerers of &lt;a href=\"Oolacile\"&gt;Oolacile&lt;/a&gt;, capable of manipulating the forces of nature with knowledge and means that not even the sorcerers of &lt;a href=\"Vinheim\"&gt;Vinheim&lt;/a&gt; were able to replicate, created the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20Guardian\"&gt;Sanctuary Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, an amalgamation of traits from several animals like lions, goats, scorpions and birds, to defend the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20Garden\"&gt;Sanctuary Garden&lt;/a&gt; of their country. Although these creatures were not created by the Bed of Chaos and therefore cannot be defined as \"demons\", the process with which they were obtained, mixing characteristics of different animals thanks to the sorcery of souls and life, makes them very similar to the demons of chaos, produced by a flame created in imitation of the First Flame.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite the fact that the &lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; had been destroyed by a &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt;, a fragment of the Flames of Chaos managed to survive and drifted to settle underground in the far north of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt;. Here it reformed as an expanse of fire, lava and roots, starting to give birth to atrocities and monsters that cursed the region, leading people to flee in fear. Eventually the &lt;a href=\"Burnt%20Ivory%20King\"&gt;Ivory King&lt;/a&gt; and his knights managed to eliminate the demons that arose from the &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Chaos\"&gt;Old Chaos&lt;/a&gt; and drive them back into the depths. The sovereign, thanks to the power of his soul, thus built the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Eleum%20Loyce\"&gt;Eleum Loyce&lt;/a&gt; over that land and erected an immense cathedral, a fortress city and a Garrison Wall above the Chaos, in an attempt to contain it and its horrors with all his efforts, even going so far as to use the power of his own soul to stem his raging flames. \nHowever the flames of Chaos would not be sated and over time the Ivory Knight was drained of his vigour; sensing the degradation of his power he decided to plunge into Chaos' heart in an attempt to reduce its flames alone but was devoured by the chaos, becoming an empty husk controlled by it. After their King was consumed by Chaos, many of Eleum Loyce's faithful knights decided to follow him and put him out of his misery but their souls too were corrupted by the flames, leading them to lose all sense of purpose and being, leaving them driven only by the urge of expunging any who might disturb the flames even if they were former compatriots. With their armor charred and burnt black by fire and still burning in agony, they remained as empty shells controlled by the Chaos alongside their once-proud king.\nAs a last resort to stem the advance of the Chaos that couldn't be contained, the decision was made to \"fling open\" the ivory gates of the fortress of Eleum Loyce. &lt;a href=\"Alsanna%2C%20Silent%20Oracle\"&gt;Alsanna&lt;/a&gt;, as the heiress to her Lord's wishes and in reverence of the apocalypse, devoted herself and the power of her Dark Soul to a ritual in the hopes of appeasing the raging flame. As a result the entire land of Eleum Loyce grew cold and lifeless turning into a &lt;a href=\"Frigid%20Outskirts\"&gt;frigid expanse&lt;/a&gt;, in an attempt to freeze Chaos along together with the entire country, thus sacrificing it. The remaining Knights of Eleum Loyce thus remained to watch over the Garrison Ward faithful to the King's final order of containing the Chaos waiting patiently for a new leader strong enough to guide them into its depths, while Alsanna remained in prayer inside the Cathedral over the depths to continue the ritual to keep the Chaos contained. Thanks to the long efforts of the Ivory King and his knights first and the freezing ritual of Alsanna after, the fragment of the Bed of Chaos was contained and repressed until a &lt;a href=\"Bearer%20of%20the%20Curse\"&gt;Bearer of the Curse&lt;/a&gt; managed to destroy the knights of Eleum Loyce and their King, all corrupted by the flames of Chaos in its depths, bringing them under control to the point that they were eradicated, as Drangleic never saw the presence of demons again.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis section lacks sources and needs expansions before being considered useful and complete\nFollowing the awakening of the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20One\"&gt;Ashen One&lt;/a&gt;, the Flame of Chaos has begun to fail, making the ancient Demons a dying race. The ruins of Izalith are littered with huge piles of corpses of ancient Demons, most of them belonging to lesser &lt;a href=\"Capra%20Demon\"&gt;Capra Demon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Taurus%20Demon\"&gt;Taurus Demon&lt;/a&gt;s, while few surviving specimens aimlessly roam a world that has no place for them. These beings, called &lt;a href=\"Stray%20Demon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Stray Demons&lt;/a&gt;, look like their &lt;a href=\"Stray%20Demon\"&gt;ancestors&lt;/a&gt; only superficially since their body is smaller and made mostly by rock, wood and lava (much like the Bed of Chaos).\u00a0It must be noted that the &lt;a href=\"Batwing%20Demon\"&gt;Batwing Demon&lt;/a&gt;s, a lesser breed of ancient Demons, were unfazed by the Chaos Flame's extinction and kept their duty as \"ferrymen\" for the ones that will follow the legacy of Gwyn (thus proving a deep connection between their kin and the Gods). \nLike humanity and the Gods of Anor Londo of old, the demons seek to rekindle the Flame of Chaos to preserve their race. A Demon Prince, a champion of their race, challenged Prince Lorian of Lothric, only to be defeated and retreat without his memory of the flames. No longer able to pursue the rekindling of the Chaos Flame, this marked the end of the demon race; as time went on, even the few remaining demons all but lacked any trace of the flame within; one such lost demon, reduced to little more than a wood and stone golem, served as a gatekeeper of Lothric. However, as demons are all born from the same source, they share almost everything between them, even the pride of their prince and his near-faded flame, so that the last demon standing may rekindle it.

They are covered in gray fur along their arms and legs, and they have a long, slender, fur covered tail.

At close range, they will either perform a horizontal slash with their machetes or an overhead slam, both of these attacks have a long delay and are easily evaded by moving behind the enemy. The machetes can also be &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parried&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt a distance, Demon Clerics will hurl fireballs or shoot a flame trail at medium range. Their most dangerous attack is summoning fire orbs that assault the player with projectiles whilst the Demon continues to use its other abilities.

Whilst the orbs can be destroyed with ranged weapons, they will automatically vanish once the Demon is slain.\nIt is also recommended to pull everything out of a Demon Cleric's room before engaging; otherwise, the Cleric will throw fire and/or use its machete on the &lt;a href=\"Unkindled%20One\"&gt;Unkindled One&lt;/a&gt; while other adversaries attack.\nLike all other Chaos Demons, Demon Clerics take extra damage from &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Black Knight&lt;/a&gt; weapons, one of which is found in a nearby room with an axe-wielding Black Knight."}

It has an almost draconic appearance, with black scales all over its body and a pair of stubby wings on its back. It sports a tail and horn-like growths portrude from its legs and arms. Dark red eyes are accompanied by a set of large teeth that are revealed by the demon's permanently exposed gums. Additionally, its entire body is engulfed in constant flames.\nLore.\nThe Firesage Demons were the first generation of &lt;a href=\"Demon%20%28lore%29\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; spawned from the &lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, the entity that appeared following the attempt of the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Witch of Izalith&lt;/a&gt; to make a power similar to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; using her &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Soul\"&gt;Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt;. The attempt was successful and she create the &lt;a href=\"Flame%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Flame of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; but Izalith and her powerful soul became a seedbed for a new lifeform: the mother and source of all demons. While the very first demon, &lt;a href=\"Ceaseless%20Discharge\"&gt;Ceaseless Discharge&lt;/a&gt;, was a monstrous and unstable mutation of a son of Izalith while her newly created Flame of Chaos was still unstable, the Firesage Demon is one of the demons that were generated after Izalith and her daughters managed to stabilize their new flame, thus gaining a more defined body and control over the power of chaos inside its body. These new creatures learned to coexist with the already present society of Izalith, becoming \"demon priests\" of the Flame of Chaos and Izalith and even going as far as to learn the primordial flame sorceries developed by the Lord and her daughters. After Izalith lost control over the Flame of Chaos that devoured her city, this Demon Firesage managed to survive the war that the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Knight\"&gt;Silver Knight&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; waged against its kind and it remained to protected its domain inside the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Ruins\"&gt;ruins of its home&lt;/a&gt;, still wielding its &lt;a href=\"Demon%27s%20Catalyst\"&gt;Demon's Catalyst&lt;/a&gt; and retaining the knowledge of the now lost flame sorceries\nThe &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt; encountered the Demon Firesage in the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Ruins\"&gt;Demon Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, after they had placed the &lt;a href=\"Lordvessel\"&gt;Lordvessel&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Altar\"&gt;Firelink Altar&lt;/a&gt;, in their mission to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; and obtain the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Soul\"&gt;Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt; of Izalith contained within it. They proceeded to fight and slay the demon in combat thus gaining access to the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Izalith\"&gt;Lost Izalith&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nThe Demon Firesage is very similar in terms of moveset and attacks to the &lt;a href=\"Stray%20Demon\"&gt;Stray Demon&lt;/a&gt;, so the same rules apply here: staying behind it and keeping a shield up should damage be unavoidable are good ideas. Be wary of its overhead attacks that are blockable, but deal heavy &lt;a href=\"stamina\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; damage.\nGetting too far away from it will cause it to either &lt;a href=\"%23Leaping%20Hammer%20Smash\"&gt;leap at the player with its hammer&lt;/a&gt;, or do a &lt;a href=\"%23Hammer%20Smash\"&gt;straight down smash&lt;/a&gt;, which can take away a large chunk of stamina. Note that both of those attacks do not track, so with proper timing, one can easily roll through their smashes.\nThe Demon Firesage is highly susceptible to &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt; buildup.\nBoss information.\nAttacks.\nLeaping Hammer Smash.\nIf the player gets too far, the demon will cover a great distance very quickly after the starting animation.\nButt Slam.\nIt will fly up into the air to perform this attack.\nExploding Swing.\nIt will only affect the area in front of it and being behind it is a safe zone.\nExploding Hammer Drive.\nIt smashes its hammer into the ground.

Both periodically ignite and extinguish, using different abilities depending on which of the two states they're in. After killing them, the demon who died last sprouts wings and becomes the Demon Prince. The Demon Prince uses different attacks and gains access either to a laser beam or fire orbs, depending on which of the two initial demons he grew out of.\nLocation.\nFound in &lt;a href=\"The%20Dreg%20Heap\"&gt;The Dreg Heap&lt;/a&gt;, at the bottom of the pit located at the end of &lt;a href=\"The%20Dreg%20Heap%23Bonfires\"&gt;Within the Earthen Peak Ruins&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\n&lt;a href=\"Flame%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;The Chaos Flame&lt;/a&gt;, like the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; that it was unable to replace, is capable of being rekindled by a champion &lt;a href=\"Demon%20%28lore%29\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; of vast power. Such a so-called \"prince\" went to face &lt;a href=\"Lorian\"&gt;Lorian&lt;/a&gt;, eldest son of the Lothric royal family, and was defeated in combat. But the race of demons shares memory with each other, and those that remembered the power and determination of the Demon Prince share in this essence, so that even the last demon alive can rekindle the Chaos Flame.\nBy the final end of the world, reality has partially collapsed onto itself, gathering all lands onto one point of convergence. At the bottom of a large tree rest two demons, the last demons by that time, and the last one to survive shall be reborn as the Demon Prince.\nStrategy.\nDemon in Pain and Demon from Below.\nDuring the first phase, the key to surviving is exploiting the difference between the \"Extinguished\" and \"Ignited\" states of the two demons. While Extinguished, they are not very mobile and use limited-range and slow-moving &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Toxic&lt;/a&gt; breath attacks, only resorting to easily dodged melee attacks when there is a nearby threat. Out-ranging an Extinguished demon or staying outside of its attack arcs will make it easy to slay. An Ignited demon, on the other hand, will aggressively pursue the player with melee attacks, but will not use breath attacks at all. The demons can spend several seconds to power up and shift from an Extinguished to an Ignited state, or perform a slow but powerful two-handed fiery slam that snuffs out their flame and reverts from an Ignited to an Extinguished state while simultaneously rendering them helpless for several seconds after.\nThe key to defeating the first phase is to split the demons up while also keeping both in view at all times. While an Extinguished demon is not a major threat, its breath attacks can provide supporting fire for an Ignited demon, creating inconvenient moments where the player may be unable to capitalize on openings in an Ignited demon's defenses. Watching for the breath attacks will allow the player to reposition to easily avoid it while still being able to comfortably fight the other demon. If both demons are Ignited, the safe move is to play passively and keep both of them in view while trying to attack only when both are not able to immediately retaliate; kite them around the arena until one of them performs the fiery slam to revert to an Extinguished demon, then choose a target to attack.\nInflicting enough &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; damage to a demon will stagger it, opening it up for a visceral attack. This can be done regardless of the state of the demon, and is a good way to rack up strong damage.\nDemon Prince.\nThe Demon Prince uses different abilities depending on which of the demons from the first phase was killed last. If the Demon from Below (the orange demon) was killed last and becomes the Demon Prince, he will cast &lt;a href=\"Seething%20Chaos\"&gt;Seething Chaos&lt;/a&gt; on occasion and uses a long-duration laser ray ability which is easily avoided by staying close to him, allowing the player to inflict free damage while the laser is being fired. If the Demon in Pain (the red demon) was killed last, the Demon Prince can cast &lt;a href=\"Floating%20Chaos\"&gt;Floating Chaos&lt;/a&gt; and charge up a powerful aerial maelstrom that releases a large number of highly-damaging meteors into the arena when completed.\nRegardless of which demon was killed last, the Demon Prince is a very aggressive enemy that employs powerful claw combos, aerial bombardments and dive attacks, and a grab attack where they will pick up the player and toss them, dealing heavy damage. Getting within its claw arcs or behind it is the best way to avoid damage, though beware that it is extremely mobile so be ready to chase it down. As with the first phase, inflicting enough Poise damage will allow the player to perform a visceral attack for tremendous damage, and the powerful charged attacks for either form of the Demon Prince can also be interrupted with enough Poise damage (separate from the primary stagger, and a visceral cannot be taken upon interruption unless it is from the primary stagger)."}

It resides in a large and partially flooded arena.\nDescription.\nA giant, grotesque frog demon with a long tail. It has a skull-like face and two arms protruding from its mouth. Upon entering the boss area the player will find the Demon of Song sitting and waiting, as if to lure prey in. The face will use its arms to pull the upper jaw of the frog body down to protect the face from harm.\nLore.\nThe Demon of Song's origins are unknown but it\u00a0was originally sealed inside the Shrine of Amana\u00a0due to it developing a taste for human flesh. However, after the priestesses tasked with maintaining the seal died or became hollow, the demon was able to escape its prison. Its name comes from its ability to mimic the song of the &lt;a href=\"Milfanito\"&gt;Milfanito&lt;/a&gt;, in order to lure prey into its lair.\u00a0\nSummoning.\n&lt;a href=\"Felicia%20the%20Brave\"&gt;Felicia the Brave&lt;/a&gt; can be summoned for the fight. However, her sign is\u00a0a long distance from the fog gate; just before the third bonfire. It's a good idea to clear out the area before summoning her.\u00a0\nIn &lt;a href=\"Scholar%20of%20the%20First%20Sin\"&gt;Scholar of the First Sin&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible to summon &lt;a href=\"Lone%20Hunter%20Schmidt\"&gt;Lone Hunter Schmidt&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"shade\"&gt;shade&lt;/a&gt; to help with this boss fight, provided that the area between the boss room and his summon sign is cleared. His summon sign is in the last building in the water before the Rhoy's Resting Place bonfire.\u00a0\nStrategies.\nThe Demon of Song is near impervious to damage and only its face and arms can be damaged. When it attacks, it emerges from the frog skin momentarily and becomes vulnerable to damage. A good strategy here is to skirt around either its left or right side and wait for it to attack, then go in and hit it as it recovers from its attacks. Simply rinse and repeat, and try to avoid its attacks as best as possible, as they are highly damaging.\u00a0\nA ranged character will have a much easier time with this fight. The player is able to let loose three shots with a standard &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; right after coming through the fog gate. Then running up to the boss and standing right in front of it will bait it to attack with its hands, allowing for further attacks. \nThe status build-up of &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Mist%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poison Mist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20Mist%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Toxic Mist&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Fog%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dark Fog&lt;/a&gt; will continue to apply even when the Demon is in its frog skin. Poison and Toxic Mist can prove particularly useful as they have no stat requirements and only require a single &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;attunement slot&lt;/a&gt; each. Both statuses can also be applied at the same time for massive damage over time.\nBecause the arena is partially flooded with water, the Demon of Song is weak to &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage and resistant to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttacks.\nTorpedo Drive:\u00a0An attack that makes the Demon charge forward in a straight line. It remains in its skin so no damage can be caused to it. Causes high damage if it connects.\u00a0\nArm Slap:\u00a0The Demon's most basic attack, it opens up its skin and does an overhead attack with its left hand, followed by its right hand.\nPanzer Press:\u00a0The Demon stands up on its hind legs and then falls forward. Small AoE damage when it lands.\nVertical Takeoff:\u00a0The Demon jumps up into the air and slams into the ground. This attack has good tracking.\nAquatic Artillery Salvo and Barrage:\u00a0The Demon spits out balls of water at the player. This varies based on the distance between the player and it. At close range it will just spit out one volley, while at long range it will launch a volley to the left, then the middle, and finally to the right.\nAmphibious Assault:\u00a0The Demon has a grab attack with a wind up similar to the Arm Slap, does very high damage and will likely kill.\nDefenses.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 Demon of Song by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Whp5Q7YUbQ&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

Additionally, the explosion can be useful in the hands of enterprising players that take advantage of terrain, using the knockback to toss opponents off of cliff edges."}

Its main disadvantage is its heavy focus on &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;-scaling as that might limit build potential a bit. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Plank%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Plank Shield&lt;/a&gt; however is pretty much useless for blocking and should be replaced as soon was possible, most likely by either the &lt;a href=\"Large%20Leather%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Large Leather Shield&lt;/a&gt; or by the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Eagle%20Kite%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Silver Eagle Kite Shield&lt;/a&gt; (though the latter requires an additional point in Strength to wield). \nIts lonely &lt;a href=\"Loincloth\"&gt;Loincloth&lt;/a&gt; is rather insufficient as armor, serving only to gain the flat armor bonus for having something equipped in an armor slot, and to gain a small amount of elemental defence and &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; resistance. To fill the remaining slots and gain more of an armor bonus, the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Master\"&gt;Sword Master&lt;/a&gt; outside &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt; drops the &lt;a href=\"Master%27s%20Attire\"&gt;Master's Attire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Master%27s%20Gloves\"&gt;Master's Gloves&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Chain Set&lt;/a&gt; can be bought from the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20Handmaid\"&gt;Shrine Handmaid&lt;/a&gt; for 2,300 souls total. Pieces of the &lt;a href=\"Deserter%20Set\"&gt;Deserter Set&lt;/a&gt; can also be gained in &lt;a href=\"High%20Wall%20of%20Lothric\"&gt;High Wall of Lothric&lt;/a&gt; by killing &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Soldier%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Hollow Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s.

{"id": "47209", "revid": "49243392", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=47209", "title": "Desert Sorceress", "text": "Desert Sorceresses are\u00a0\u00a0in\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nLore.\nHailing from the land of &lt;a href=\"Jugo\"&gt;Jugo&lt;/a&gt;, these beguiling fiends are skilled with fire magic and are noted for using their feminine wiles to lower an enemy's guard before attacking. Their reason for being at &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Peak\"&gt;Earthen Peak&lt;/a&gt; is unknown. Their visages hidden alluringly behind veils, they are deceptively dangerous and should not be underestimated. Mytha forbids any face more beautiful than her own from being seen, and the Sorceresses wear their veils to avert the mistress's wrath. Their beauty is poisonous.\nDescription.\nDesert Sorceresses are fragile, with low HP and average physical defense, but they do catastrophically heavy damage with most of their attacks and have relatively high (compared to their physical defenses) elemental defense. Their primary offense centers around the use of &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;pyromancies&lt;/a&gt;, several of which are unique. They carry a catalyst that resembles a hand mirror.\nStrategy.\nPlayers should avoid fighting Desert Sorceresses that are near other enemies, unless one is confident in their crowd control abilities. They are often encountered along with other enemies, who draw the player's attention while the Desert Sorceress bombards them with her spells from range. If possible, try to aggro other enemies out of range of the Sorceress' spells and defeating them before focusing on her.\nAlone, they are not much of a threat, so long as one has a &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; with high &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Fire resistance&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"Gyrm%20Greatshield\"&gt;Gyrm Greatshield&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sorceresses have no &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;, and are thus susceptible to stun-locking, including using &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bows&lt;/a&gt;. Be careful when using slower weapons, as some swing slowly enough to give the Sorceress a chance to cast a &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;pyromancy&lt;/a&gt; before being hit again.\nIf one decides to take a more direct approach, one must be cautious of their &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;pyromancy&lt;/a&gt; attacks, as they can deal tremendous damage, especially in &lt;a href=\"New%20Game%20Plus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;NG+&lt;/a&gt; and beyond. The Desert Sorceresses have a fairly long time delay between casting spells, so try to bait out a spell and then dodge it before charging in.\nThey are vulnerable to &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;, so it is quite an easy task to take them out from afar using &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poison Arrows&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, the ones in &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Peak\"&gt;Earthen Peak&lt;/a&gt; can also be lured into destroying the poison-filled jars that are scattered across the area.\nAttacks.\nScattering FlameThe Sorceress launches a volley of five fireballs into the air, which then arc downward, hitting the ground and exploding. The blasts are quite large and the damage from multiple flames can quickly prove fatal if a player is unfortunate enough to be in the area of multiple blasts. Fortunately, the flames explode on impact, which means they frequently fail to reach their full potential due to hitting the ceiling or walls. Their high arc and wide spread also allows players to step between the fireballs, or simply run under them harmlessly.\n&lt;a href=\"Lingering%20Flame\"&gt;Lingering Flame&lt;/a&gt;The Sorceress launches, via a blown kiss, a mid-sized fireball that lingers in one spot for several seconds after flying out. The fireball will explode on impact if something touches it whilst active or the spell's duration expires. The blast this fireball has is enormous, and is quite capable of knocking characters to the ground or instantly killing those with poor &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; resistance and/or low &lt;a href=\"Vigor\"&gt;Vigor&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Combustion%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Combustion&lt;/a&gt;Waving her catalyst cross-wise (right to left from the player's perspective), the Sorceress unleashes a searing cloud of flames. The damage is low as far as the Sorceress' pyromancies go and only deals damage at melee range, but it has a very short telegraph and lingers for a short period of time.\nGrabDesert Sorceresses are capable of a grab attack, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Darkwraith%20%28enemy%29\"&gt;Darkwraiths&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\". This attack is telegraphed by the Sorceress crossing her arms and giving a mocking chuckle animation, before attempting what looks like a slap. If players opt to retreat out of range, the Sorceress may walk for a short distance before attempting the grab, however it has poor tracking and can be sidestepped. If successful, the Sorceress will kiss the player, performing a grab rather similar to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Hand\"&gt;Dark Hand&lt;/a&gt; attack, which does enormous damage, enough to kill a relatively low-&lt;a href=\"Vigor\"&gt;Vigor&lt;/a&gt; character instantly. This attack cannot be reduced by physical or elemental defenses.\nCatalyst StrikeAt close range, Desert Sorceresses may attempt to use their catalyst to strike the player. Catalyst attacks are telegraphed by the Sorceress bringing it back to her right (the player's left) before swinging it in a fast three-hit combo, with the final attack being delayed slightly. The catalyst attack can be &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;parried&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhat attacks a Sorceress uses depends on range. At longer ranges she will use her Scattering Flame spell. At medium to close range she will cast Lingering Flame. At close range she will cast Combustion, attempt a grab or attack with her catalyst."}

Dexterity softcaps at 20/40/45. You will want to stop at 20 and 40 overall for physical attack and 45 for the spell cast speed of some spells. This spell cast speed increase is generally unimportant for a PvE caster build, but worth noting if you happen to get into PvP. \nUnlike Strength there is no boost to Dexterity when two handing, though players will still gain increased damage in practice when two handing due to the Motion Value modifier. \nWeapon Scaling.\nThe following are &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; that scale with dexterity, and their level of scaling, when not upgraded.

A letter denoting a weapon's specific scaling properties is noted beneath the weapon's required Dexterity stat. The letters range in order of effectiveness from E, D, C, B, A, and S.\nWeapons with an E rating for scaling will receive a poor benefit from investment in Dexterity while weapons with an S rating receive the greatest benefit.\nAs is with every other stat in the game, it also has indirect bonuses such as increasing the player character's flat damage absorption. Notable among these indirect bonuses is a reduction to fall-damage with every level invested into Dexterity.\nSoft Caps.\nAs of the 1.32 Regulations patch, Dexterity has two soft caps: 40 and 80.\nFor most normal builds, the damage return for weapon attack rating stops at 40 Dexterity. This applies to both quality builds and Dexterity-focused builds.\nWhen utilizing the &lt;a href=\"Sharp%20Gem\"&gt;Sharp&lt;/a&gt; infusion, scaling on weapons changes at high levels. Attack rating returns between 40 and 60 Dexterity are relatively poor, with most weapons only seeing an increase in 1 point of damage per level of investment. But past 60 Dexterity, scaling increases again, seeing gains of 3 to 5 damage per level up until roughly 80 Dexterity, where it will gradually fall off."}

After the Chosen Undead defeated the brave knight, they finish what Artorias had started, continuing through Oolacile Township and onward, eventually defeating Manus and rescuing Dusk.\nDespite this, when returning to the current age and speaking to Dusk, she would simply note that the Chosen Undead looks a lot like Artorias (believing it was Artorias who rescued her from Manus), without expanding on whether or not the Chosen Undead's actions had any effect in saving Oolacile.\nWhile speaking to &lt;a href=\"Marvelous%20Chester\"&gt;Marvelous Chester&lt;/a&gt;, he would say that \"Oolacile has brought the Abyss upon itself [...] Fooled by that toothy serpent, they upturned the grave of primeval man, and incited his ornery wrath\", implying that either &lt;a href=\"Kingseeker%20Frampt\"&gt;Kingseeker Frampt&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Darkstalker%20Kaathe\"&gt;Darkstalker Kaathe&lt;/a&gt; had a hand in Oolacile's downfall. Due to the inherent darkness of the Abyss, Darkstalker Kaathe is the more likely culprit.\n\"Dark Souls III\".\nBy the time of \"Dark Souls III\", Oolacile, who's name was once lost to time in \"Dark Souls II\", is remembered as an ancient lost land and renowned for its \"golden sorceries\", whose spells of golden hues allowed a caster to produce and manipulate light, and even be capable of reversing time. These pure natured sorceries, even the most elementary of spells, are such that have not been achieved even by the Dragon School of &lt;a href=\"Vinheim\"&gt;Vinheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nThose who researched the lost sorceries were known as Xanthous Scholars, and wore yellow clothing with a oversized crown supposedly made in imitation of a divine creature of Oolacile, along with a band of brass medallions with the number of which indicates their success in their research; a point of pride lost on others. Some chose to foolishly imitate the scholars by wearing yellow. The Xanthous Scholars' vast research of Oolacile's light sorceries were recorded on &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Scroll\"&gt;golden scrolls&lt;/a&gt;."}

This makes it the best catalyst to use for 10 and 11 intelligence, while tying with the Oolacile Ivory Catalyst for being the best catalyst to use between 12 and 26 intelligence.\nIt has the advantage of having a lower intelligence requirement than the Oolacile Ivory Catalyst as well as being &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;poisonous&lt;/a&gt;, inflicting a &lt;a href=\"buildup\"&gt;buildup&lt;/a&gt; of 30 per strike.

He was fascinated with &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;sorceries&lt;/a&gt;, but lacked the means to pursue his goals and thus joined the Dragon School as an assassin. However, when he became &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt;, he was exiled from Vinheim, and so traveled to &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt; to continue pursuit of his dream.\nQuestline.\nOrbeck is first met in the &lt;a href=\"Crucifixion%20Woods\"&gt;Crucifixion Woods&lt;/a&gt;, on the second floor of the ruins where the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Sage\"&gt;Crystal Sage&lt;/a&gt; is fought.

Equipping the &lt;a href=\"Scholar%20Ring\"&gt;Scholar Ring&lt;/a&gt; will count toward this 10 Intelligence total.\nOrbeck's presence at Firelink Shrine is contingent on the player providing him with Sorcery scrolls, as per the promise made to him at the Crucifixion Woods.

The player may choose to kill Orbeck at any time and present &lt;a href=\"Orbeck%27s%20Ashes\"&gt;his ashes&lt;/a&gt; to Yuria in exchange for the &lt;a href=\"Morion%20Blade\"&gt;Morion Blade&lt;/a&gt;, or spare him in order to complete his questline and obtain his ashes much later.\nUpon giving Orbeck all four Sorcery scrolls and learning every available spell from him, he will bid farewell to the player and leave Firelink Shrine. He will then become available to summon for fighting the &lt;a href=\"Lorian%2C%20Elder%20Prince%20and%20Lothric%2C%20Younger%20Prince\"&gt;Twin Princes&lt;/a&gt;, once Firelink Shrine has been reloaded at least once to confirm his departure.

The LB pincer attacks have very high stamina usage at about 70 per use, and the LT variant about 90.\nSome players reported that the LB pincer attack has a yet undetermined time frame by which enemy strikes from an angle to both sides will get deflected, but attacks from the center front are not affected.\nUnlike the &lt;a href=\"Imperious%20Knight\"&gt;Imperious Knight&lt;/a&gt;s, the \"clenched shields\" state at the end of the pincer attack cannot be prolonged, and does not count as blocking.\nOwing to high inherent damage rating and unique Power Stance attack that delivers damage from both shields at once, the Orma's &amp; Reeve's Greatshield pairing might be the only Shields in \"Dark Souls II\" that can be counted as a legit weapon.\nWhen upgraded and with the right build, this shield pairing can make short work of most bosses and lightly armored players while providing solid defense; its main drawback lies in the initial long windup of its first pincer attack (same windup time as a shield bash), and in PvE its almost non-existent range means players will have a hard time following up on an attack after knocking back a medium-sized enemy due to sheer poise damage."}

He is voiced by .\nAn undead knight from &lt;a href=\"Astora\"&gt;Astora&lt;/a&gt;, Oscar appears in the game's opening cutscene, freeing the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt; from their cell in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Asylum\"&gt;Undead Asylum&lt;/a&gt; and therefore kickstarting their quest. He can be found mortally wounded shortly after, as the first character in the game that can be talked to, wishing to impart the character with his dying words and provide them with the all-important &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nOscar is equipped with the &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Knight%20Set\"&gt;Elite Knight Set&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Crest%20Shield\"&gt;Crest Shield&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"Astora%27s%20Straight%20Sword\"&gt;Astora's Straight Sword&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlot.\nOscar appears in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Asylum\"&gt;Undead Asylum&lt;/a&gt;, where he rescues the player character from imprisonment by dropping a corpse with the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Cell%20Key\"&gt;Dungeon Cell Key&lt;/a&gt; into the cell. He is later found dying, and asks the player to listen to his tale before he expires. If this request is granted, he will tell the Chosen Undead of a prophecy stating that an undead will one day travel to &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Asylum\"&gt;Undead Asylum&lt;/a&gt; and ring the &lt;a href=\"Bells%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Bells of Awakening&lt;/a&gt; (which he refers to as a singular bell, unaware that there are two). At the conclusion of his tale, he will give the player an\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Asylum%20F2%20East%20Key\"&gt;Undead Asylum F2 East Key&lt;/a&gt; (as well as the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Pilgrim%27s%20Key\"&gt;Big Pilgrim's Key&lt;/a&gt; if the player has defeated the &lt;a href=\"Asylum%20Demon\"&gt;Asylum Demon&lt;/a&gt; during their first encounter with the boss), after which he states that he can die with hope in his heart. If the player talks to him again after this, Oscar will request for them to leave him to die alone, afraid that he might hurt the player character after turning &lt;a href=\"hollow\"&gt;hollow&lt;/a&gt; after death.\nIf the player answers \"No\" to his question (refusing to hear his tale and request), the only way to obtain the Estus Flask and the keys is to kill Oscar or rest at a bonfire. Despite being hurt by the player's refusal, Oscar still gracefully requests them to leave so that he does not hurt them after turning hollow.\nRegardless of whether the player killed him in the first meeting or left him to die, Oscar is encountered again in the same area upon revisiting the Asylum, now a hollow enemy.\nStrategy.\nOscar alternates between using his sword two-handed and one-handed and kicks for heavier stamina damage. His attacks deal decent damage, but he also moves slowly for an NPC enemy, allowing for plenty of opportunities to heal. He has the heavy roll, making it easy to strafe him.\nLore.\nOscar was likely a high-ranking knight from &lt;a href=\"Astora\"&gt;Astora&lt;/a&gt;, who was determined to seek out &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt; once he turned &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. Exactly how he ended up in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Asylum\"&gt;Undead Asylum&lt;/a&gt; and why he rescues the player is unknown, though it is implied that he was intentionally releasing undead from the Asylum in hopes that at least one would ring the &lt;a href=\"Bells%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Bells of Awakening&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is a hole in the ceiling at the location he is first encountered, and since the Asylum Demon first appears descending upon the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt; to guard the exit from any undead hoping to escape, it can be assumed that Oscar had fought the Asylum Demon on the roof of the Asylum, but wound up crashing down into the squalid dungeon the player encounters him in.\nIt is implied that the ensuing despair he felt at being unable to even overcome his first obstacle as an undead is what turned him Hollow.\nCharacter information.\nDrops.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nEscape=\nRevisited=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nRemoved content.\n\"The following is content that is present within the code of Dark Souls, but not actually implemented in the game.

He is also known as Oswald the Pardoner. He is voiced by , who also voices &lt;a href=\"Aldia%2C%20Scholar%20of%20the%20First%20Sin\"&gt;Aldia, Scholar of the First Sin&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nLocation.\nOswald of &lt;a href=\"Carim\"&gt;Carim&lt;/a&gt; appears in the bell tower guarded by the &lt;a href=\"Bell%20Gargoyles\"&gt;Bell Gargoyles&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Parish\"&gt;Undead Parish&lt;/a&gt;. He will only appear after the player has rung the Undead Parish &lt;a href=\"Bells%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Bell of Awakening&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlot.\nOswald sells the &lt;a href=\"Karmic%20Justice\"&gt;Karmic Justice&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;miracle&lt;/a&gt;, as well as rings of various resistances, a &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20the%20Guilty\"&gt;Book of the Guilty&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Indictment\"&gt;Indictment&lt;/a&gt;s. Oswald is most useful for his ability to absolve a player of &lt;a href=\"sin\"&gt;sin&lt;/a&gt;: in doing so, all formerly friendly NPCs that the player had made hostile earlier are reverted to their neutral state and sin accumulated from killing other characters or players is eliminated. Oswald also allows players to leave covenants without facing a betrayal penalty. However, players will still lose half of their offerings to that covenant.\nStrategy.\nHe is very easy to kill as long as the player takes care of him quickly. He can heal with his talisman and use the miracle &lt;a href=\"Karmic%20Justice\"&gt;Karmic Justice&lt;/a&gt; which counters multiple hits landing on him with a powerful nova explosion, so if he used this miracle, it is best to use a slow, one hit kill weapon to avoid triggering it. He also equips a parrying dagger in his left hand and can parry attacks fairly easily, which normally follows up with a powerful and possibly fatal riposte.\nLore.\nLittle is known about Oswald; he reveals little of his own past and other characters never mention him. He is aware of the existence of &lt;a href=\"Petrus%20of%20Thorolund\"&gt;Petrus&lt;/a&gt;, as well as his treachery, but it is unknown how he knows this."}

Due to its very limited casts, it's good to pair this pyromancy with &lt;a href=\"Saint%27s%20Hood\"&gt;Saint's Hood&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Hexer%27s%20Hood\"&gt;Hexer's Hood&lt;/a&gt; for the added casts. &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ritual%20Band\"&gt;Northern Ritual Band&lt;/a&gt; can also be used but only the +2 version provides an additional cast. When paired with one of the above head armors, you can get 3 casts - albeit very slow &lt;a href=\"cast%20time\"&gt;cast time&lt;/a&gt;s - with as little as 13 &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;attunement&lt;/a&gt;.\nAside from hitting the hardest, this spell also sprouts pillars that are shorter lived than those conjured by the other Firestorm spells. This means that the player is locked in the animation for less time, allowing them to respond to a situation more quickly.\nThis spell does come with some downsides: the first and most obvious one is that is has a very limited amount of uses and requires two spell slots. Secondly, the spell has its own unique start up animation (the user's hand emitting dark flames before the cast is completed), meaning it can easily be distinguished from such spells as &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Snake\"&gt;Fire Snake&lt;/a&gt;, thereby it cannot be used to keep an opponent player on edge as they know what is coming.\nAttunement milestones.\nLike all other spells, the amount of casts per slot increases upon reaching certain Attunement milestones:"}

It also has relatively good elemental resistances, being quite resistant to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage, though given the nature of its former owner it is also quite weak to corruption from &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt has strong resistance to status effects, including the highest &lt;a href=\"Frost\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt; resistance of any complete armor set; however, it is also very susceptible to &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt; build-up. It also provides very good &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; due to its weight."}

Subsequent attacks with the weapon will reduce the &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;Focus Points&lt;/a&gt; of any enemies hit based on their maximum FP. Buff lasts for 46 seconds.\nThe amount of FP on the target destroyed on the target increases by 1 for every additional 25 maximum FP, with a base amount of 10:\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nAs normal enemies do not use Focus Points, this ability is useless in single player.\nOnline gameplay.\nDepending on the opponent, this skill can be useful for denying an enemy access to their &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;s, or force them to use their &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Estus%20Flask\"&gt;Ashen Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt; more frequently.\nEven though the potency of this skill increases in tandem with the target's investment in &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Attunement&lt;/a&gt;, targets with smaller FP pools will still require less total attacks to completely deplete their FP, which can render them completely unable to use skills such as &lt;a href=\"Perseverance%20%28skill%29\"&gt;Perseverance&lt;/a&gt;. As the majority of melee-focused builds will rarely allot any &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Estus%20Flask\"&gt;Ashen Estus&lt;/a&gt; at all, simply depleting their existing FP (usually requiring only 8-9 successful hits) is sufficient to render them completely unable to perform any skills. Even if they have a &lt;a href=\"Simple%20Gem\"&gt;Simple&lt;/a&gt;-infused weapon equipped in their off-hand, the slow rate of FP regeneration ensures that they will only be able to perform a skill once every minute or so, drastically reducing their effectiveness.\nAlthough caster-specialized builds will require more hits to fully deplete their FP (generally around 10-13 hits), they are less able to recover from this due to their reliance on casting as their main source of damage. As well, since Yorshka's Spear is a polearm that utilizes the &lt;a href=\"Partizan%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Partizan&lt;/a&gt; moveset, it is capable of chasing down and tripping up retreating players with ease. A caster's reliance on Ashen Estus will also mean that they will have reduced allotment of &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;standard Estus&lt;/a&gt;, and as such inflicting damage to both their &lt;a href=\"Hit%20Points%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; and FP at the same time will build more pressure on them than on a melee build that has only standard Estus. Additionally, builds with high investment in Attunement will often sacrifice stats in areas such as &lt;a href=\"Vigor%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Vigor&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt;, making them much softer targets and thus easier to induce panic in."}

Those encountered elsewhere drop a much higher amount of &lt;a href=\"Souls%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; here.\nPlot.\nEntering.\nIn order to access this world, the player must first pick up the &lt;a href=\"Peculiar%20Doll\"&gt;Peculiar Doll&lt;/a&gt; located in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Undead%20Asylum\"&gt;Northern Undead Asylum&lt;/a&gt;, upon the return visit later in the game. When examining the large &lt;a href=\"Painting%20Guardian\"&gt;guarded&lt;/a&gt; painting in Anor Londo, the player will be mysteriously pulled into the cloistered area.\nExiting.\n&lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20the%20Crossbreed\"&gt;Priscilla the Crossbreed&lt;/a&gt;, the boss of the area who resides in a tower, will not begin attacking straight away, instead imploring the player to leave her world. Unless the player jumps off the ledge behind Priscilla, it is impossible to leave the Painted World of Ariamis, even with the &lt;a href=\"Lordvessel\"&gt;Lordvessel&lt;/a&gt;'s warp ability or through the use of a &lt;a href=\"Homeward%20Bone\"&gt;Homeward Bone&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Homeward\"&gt;Homeward&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;miracle&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf Priscilla is attacked, attempting to leave by jumping off the ledge will result in death. At this point, players will only be allowed to leave upon her defeat.\nLore.\nThe Painted World of Ariamis, as the name suggests, was created by &lt;a href=\"Ariamis\"&gt;Ariamis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Painting%20Guardian\"&gt;Painting Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s were ordered to protect it through generations, however, at some point, the Guardians were not able to recall the reason for doing so.\nThe Painted World of Ariamis was as a sanctuary for &lt;a href=\"Crossbreed%20Priscilla\"&gt;Crossbreed Priscilla&lt;/a&gt;, so that she could be left alone. The key to entering this land is the &lt;a href=\"Peculiar%20Doll\"&gt;Peculiar Doll&lt;/a&gt;. Once considered an abomination which has no place in this world, Priscilla clutched this doll tightly and was eventually drawn into the lonely, painted world. This abomination was the birth of the Dragon Crossbreed, which is considered a bastard child. She was considered an abomination because the gods of Anor Londo feared her Lifehunt ability, seen as the antithesis of all life and a threat to their immortality.\nOnce it was a peaceful land with kind inhabitants. It hosts a building similar to an old cathedral, whose annex served as a storage house.\nThe Painted World of Ariamis has much in connection with &lt;a href=\"Velka%2C%20Goddess%20of%20Sin\"&gt;Velka, Goddess of Sin&lt;/a&gt;. Within it, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Cleric%20Robe\"&gt;Black Cleric Robe&lt;/a&gt; can be found, said to be given to pardoners serving Velka. Other items attributed to Velka are scattered throughout the area, unique ones that can either be traded or obtained only in the Painted World: &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Sacrifice\"&gt;Ring of Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt; (sacrificial rite to Velka), &lt;a href=\"Velka%27s%20Rapier\"&gt;Velka's Rapier&lt;/a&gt; (used by her pardoner), &lt;a href=\"Vow%20of%20Silence\"&gt;Vow of Silence&lt;/a&gt; (her secret rite). &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ember\"&gt;Dark Ember&lt;/a&gt; obtained in Painted World is no longer known to any living blacksmith in the outside world, as it was long hidden by the church.\n&lt;a href=\"Crow%20Demon\"&gt;Crow Demon&lt;/a&gt;s were designed as Velka's worshipers, whose bodies warped due to their devotion. They are the only enemies from which &lt;a href=\"Souvenir%20of%20Reprisal\"&gt;Souvenir of Reprisal&lt;/a&gt; can be obtained. It is said to come from guilt-soaked offenders of the Gods, punished by the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Darkmoon\"&gt;Blade of the Darkmoon&lt;/a&gt;. However, it is dubious if this early developer idea made it through into the final game. Velka oversees a list of the guilty that one day will be judged with Blades of the Darkmoon, and it would be unusual for the goddess to punish Crow Demons for worshiping her.\nThe Painted World of Ariamis likely rotted and was set on fire in order to be restored. This is a usual cycle within painted worlds. The history of Painted World is no longer known in &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt;. It is taught only in the mythology of heretics, passed down just among them, and in ancient tales of the \"hunchbacked teller\". Those \"heretics\" are &lt;a href=\"Corvian%20Storyteller\"&gt;Corvian Storyteller&lt;/a&gt;s, spreading tales of Painted World among forlorn ones. They are wretched beings with no place to go, just like their followers, &lt;a href=\"Corvian\"&gt;Corvian&lt;/a&gt;s, the unwanted ones possessed by fear. Some of them wield &lt;a href=\"Great%20Corvian%20Scythe\"&gt;Great Corvian Scythe&lt;/a&gt;, visually resembling the one used by the mistress of the Painted World and causing bleeding. It is a reference to Priscilla's scythe rather than &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Friede\"&gt;Friede&lt;/a&gt;'s, mistress of &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Painted World of Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Company%20Captain%20Yorshka\"&gt;Company Captain Yorshka&lt;/a&gt; is speculated to be the daughter of Crossbreed Priscilla.\nBlack phantom.\n&lt;a href=\"Black%20Phantom\"&gt;Black Phantom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Xanthous%20King%2C%20Jeremiah\"&gt;Xanthous King, Jeremiah&lt;/a&gt; will &lt;a href=\"Invaders\"&gt;invade&lt;/a&gt; unhollowed players that venture into the graveyard near\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Phalanx\"&gt;Phalanx&lt;/a&gt;.

Wielding the legendary treasures &lt;a href=\"Grant\"&gt;Grant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sanctus\"&gt;Sanctus&lt;/a&gt;, relics of the Church which were granted to him for his task, he ventured into &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt; on the first Undead mission of the Way of White.\nStrategy.\nLeeroy's &lt;a href=\"Great%20Hammers\"&gt;Great Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grant\"&gt;Grant&lt;/a&gt;, deals &lt;a href=\"Strike\"&gt;Strike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; damage and can hit overhead, so dodging rather than blocking may prove more useful. This overhead hammer attack has a slow recoil animation, so a sideroll followed by a backstab is an extremely effective strategy. His primary attack is also very easy to telegraph and parry. That said, he spawns on a very narrow ledge, so it may be challenging to not fall off. It helps to lure him back to a less limiting space. Although, the cliff can be used to the player's advantage with a well timed kick, if they do not mind losing his drops.\nLeeroy employs &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Gods\"&gt;Wrath of the Gods&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; spell that deals high damage and inflicts high knockback, particularly dangerous since he spawns next to a cliff. Rolling while he casts it will negate its effects.\nLeeroy can heal with his &lt;a href=\"Talisman\"&gt;Talisman&lt;/a&gt;, if given enough time. He may also posses enough &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; and defense to resist merely attacking him at this point, so be ready to &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt; him if he tries this."}

This will increase all types damage.\nOverview.\nEach weapon has:\nEach character has:\nWith these all in mind, the formulae are laid out below.\nScaling values.\nScaling values, also known as \"ParamBonus,\" are displayed as a letter ranging from \"E\" (lowest) to \"S\" (highest). Each letter represents a percentage of additional attack damage in relation to a particular &lt;a href=\"Stats%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;stat&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt;).\nEach scaling value has a fairly wide percentage range, meaning two weapons with the same rating might provide different percentages of additional attack damage.\nHumanity Scaling.\n&lt;a href=\"Humanity%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;Humanity&lt;/a&gt; scaling is a unique bonus attributed &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt; weapons, &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Blade\"&gt;Chaos Blade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quelaag%27s%20Furysword\"&gt;Quelaag's Furysword&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Abyss%20Greatsword\"&gt;Abyss Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;. It affects both all forms of attack of chaos weapons by providing an additional 21% attack power to each stat (equivalent to ParamBonus \"E\"). At 5 Humanity, a Chaos +5 weapon starts to overtake its Fire +10 counterpart (Chaos has higher Fire damage while Fire has higher physical damage) At 10 Humanity, a Chaos +5 weapon effectively has the same physical damage and about 16% more Fire damage than its Fire +10 counterpart \nHumanity scaling is a hidden &lt;a href=\"Stats%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;stat&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it is not actually displayed in-game. Normally, chaos weapons will not have any magic or lightning attack power, but magic attack can be obtained on a bow ascended down the chaos path by firing &lt;a href=\"Moonlight%20Arrow\"&gt;Moonlight Arrow&lt;/a&gt;s. \nStat Rating.\nThe stats that improve damage aren't directly used in the calculations; instead, they are first converted to a \"rating,\" which increases very quickly at low stat levels but slows down after reaching certain \"soft caps.\" All attributes use the same conversion table to determine the bonus they receive from scaling, and Humanity uses its own.\nBetween each of the data points in the conversion tables, scaling increases linearly. Standard, raw, and crystal weapons, as well as weapons upgraded with twinkling titanite, demon titanite, or dragon scales, use the first table for determining the bonus damage from attributes. Weapons ascended down the Magic, Enchanted, Divine, and Occult paths use the second table for determining bonus damage from attributes.\nUnique to Strength is that, when using a weapon with two hands, your Strength is considered 50% greater (rounded down). For example, two-handing a standard weapon at 21 Strength (42.25%) increases your effective Strength to 31 (64.75%). As a result, if you are dedicated to two-handing weapons, your effective \"soft cap\" is not 40, but 27, because two-handing increases 27 to 40. At 40 Strength (85%), two-handing uses 60 Strength (90%), a weak improvement.\nHumanity scaling is nearly identical for the physical and fire portions of &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt; weapons (only varying by 2% at 7, 8, and 9 Humanity). The growth is not linear, and not strictly equivalent for the physical and fire damage.\nScaling for Catalysts.\nAll catalysts have a base MagAdjust of 100, and the final value is calculated by using the same stat bonus formula (but the base value / bonus split is not shown in game as it is for ATK values). The scaling growth for calculating a catalyst's MagAdjust is different from the regular scaling. It spikes massively in the levels 15\u201330, then slowly grows to level 50, after which it all but stops (it takes 49 levels to get the final 10% increase). The &lt;a href=\"Tin%20Darkmoon%20Catalyst\"&gt;Tin Darkmoon Catalyst&lt;/a&gt; functions in the same way, but scales with Faith instead of Intelligence.\nThere are a few exceptions: &lt;a href=\"Oolacile%20Ivory%20Catalyst\"&gt;Oolacile Ivory Catalyst&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oolacile%20Catalyst\"&gt;Oolacile Catalyst&lt;/a&gt; ignore actual Intelligence and use 99 in their calculations. With a parameter bonus of 80%, that leads a MagAdjust of 180.\n&lt;a href=\"Logan%27s%20Catalyst\"&gt;Logan's Catalyst&lt;/a&gt; uses a different range of values for its parameter bonuses. It doesn't gain any increase to its magic adjust until 26 Intelligence, where it starts to gain large amounts of magic adjust until 30 Intelligence. Its softcap is reached slightly earlier than other catalysts, occurring at 45 Intelligence. Further investment into Intelligence results in negligible amounts of extra magic adjust all the way to 99.\nFaith for Talismans.\nLike catalysts, talismans have a base MagAdjust of 100. The scaling growth for calculating a talisman Magic Adjust is different from the regular scaling. It spikes massively in the levels 15\u201320, then slowly grows to level 50, after which it all but stops (it takes 49 levels to get the final 10% increase). &lt;a href=\"Velka%27s%20Talisman\"&gt;Velka's Talisman&lt;/a&gt; works in the same way, but using Intelligence instead of Faith.\nThere are a few exceptions: &lt;a href=\"Thorolund%20Talisman\"&gt;Thorolund Talisman&lt;/a&gt; ignores actual Faith and uses 99 in its calculations. With a parameter bonus of 65% that leads an eternally constant MagAdjust of 165.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ivory%20Talisman\"&gt;Ivory Talisman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Talisman\"&gt;Sunlight Talisman&lt;/a&gt; use their own range of values for its parameter bonuses. They don't gain any increase to its magic adjust until 16 Faith, where it starts to gain small amounts of magic adjust until 20 Faith, then larger amounts until 50. Further investment into Faith results in negligible amounts of extra magic adjust all the way to 99.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Talisman\"&gt;Darkmoon Talisman&lt;/a&gt; uses a range of values similar to Logan's Catalyst for its parameter bonuses. It doesn't gain any increase to its magic adjust until 26 Faith, where it starts to gain large amounts of magic adjust until 30 Faith, then smaller amounts until 50 Faith. Further investment into Faith results in negligible amounts of extra magic adjust all the way to 99.\nExamples.\n+15 Club, 24 Strength, 2 hands.\n+10 Divine Dagger, 20 Strength, 40 Dexterity, 50 Faith, 1 hand."}

The damage boost depends entirely on the stat and the parameter. This has some ramifications:\nStrength vs Dexterity.\nIt has been observed that at equal rating, Strength scaling will give about twice as much benefit as Dexterity scaling; or, to see it another way, dexterity scaling is equivalent to a \"2-tier\" lower Strength scaling. For example, D scaling with 40 Strength will give as much benefit as a B scaling with 40 Dexterity.\nBecause of this, \"quality\" C/C weapons will gain more benefit from \"40 STR / 20 DEX\" than \"20 STR / 40 DEX\".\nSoft caps.\nIn terms of \"return on investment\" (for strength and scaling), unlike in \"Dark Souls\", players get the \"best\" return on investment in the 30~40 range. The gains go something like this:\nWhere \"100%\" represents an arbitrary scale of what the player would get per point for a given rating.\nIn terms of scaling, it means the best gains are for \"putting all your eggs in the same basket\", with either \"40/20\" for Strength/quality or \"20/40\" for Dexterity, but never \"30/30\"."}

It indicates the level of bonus damage one can do with a &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;, based on the associated &lt;a href=\"Stats%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stats&lt;/a&gt;. In order of most to least effective, this rating can be S, A, B, C, D or E.\nOverview.\nAs a rule of thumb, a weapon's &lt;a href=\"physical%20damage\"&gt;physical damage&lt;/a&gt; is affected by the wielder's &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"elemental%20damage\"&gt;elemental damage&lt;/a&gt; is affected by &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt;. Some weapons, such as &lt;a href=\"Anri%27s%20Straight%20Sword\"&gt;Anri's Straight Sword&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Gem\"&gt;Hollow&lt;/a&gt; weapons, also scale with &lt;a href=\"Luck\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, there are also some exceptions, such as the &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Bident\"&gt;Saint Bident&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20Gem\"&gt;Blessed&lt;/a&gt; weapons, which scale their physical damage with Faith, as well as Strength and Dexterity.\nHow effectively a weapon scales is not only affected by the weapon's parameter bonus, but also its base damage. As such, weapons with high scaling but low base damage are likely to get less bonus damage than a weapon with more base damage and similar scaling. It is even possible that a weapon with a considerably worse parameter bonus gets more scaling due to having much higher base damage.\nElemental damage.\nElemental damage scales off of one's &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt;. The type of element will also affect which of the two stats is relevant, unless both are applied.\nElemental damage scales as follows:\nScaling values.\nParameter bonuses are displayed as letters ranging from E (lowest) to S (highest). Each letter represents an approximation of how well the weapon scales with a specific stat. For example, two weapons can both have equal base damage and a C scaling in &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;, but deal different amounts of damage because one weapon has a \"low\" C while the other has a \"high\" C. Similarly, the same scenario but with one weapon having a B scaling, the damage difference could be negligible because the C is \"high\" and the B is \"low\", as the letters are affected by breakpoints in the exact scaling value.\nLuck.\nSome weapons scale with &lt;a href=\"Luck\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt;. However, the parameter is not displayed anywhere on the weapon's stat screen and it is unknown if Luck scaling is the same across all applicable weapons or not.\nAdditionally, most weapons that scale with Luck will also boost Luck by five points when held, if the player's &lt;a href=\"hollowing\"&gt;hollowing&lt;/a&gt; stat is 15 or higher.\nCaps.\nStat scaling is affected by diminishing returns. This means that the higher one's stats are, the less each invested point is worth.\nThe diminishing returns are applied using breakpoints at 25, where a minor decrease in the damage-per-level ratio is applied, and 40, where the ratio will often become less than one point of damage per level."}

They are very vulnerable to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; damage; however, they should not be underestimated as their basic attacks do a good amount of damage. They also have a grab attack where they will lunge and cling onto the player's chest from where they will proceed to viciously attack them; this grab causes high damage and is likely a guaranteed &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. They also have a rarely used ranged attack in which they will launch a ball of webbing at the player, drastically reducing their movement speed. These enemies are more dangerous in groups and can swarm up to six at a time.\nParasite Spiders will often hide on the ceiling or inside holes. Players are advised to move very cautiously while exploring &lt;a href=\"Brightstone%20Cove%20Tseldora\"&gt;Brightstone Cove&lt;/a&gt; to avoid being ambushed from behind.

{"id": "8276", "revid": "56333033", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=8276", "title": "Parry and Riposte", "text": "\"Note:\" \"This article is about a gameplay technique in &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;. For its counterpart in other games, see &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Parry and Riposte (Dark Souls II)&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Parry and Riposte (Dark Souls III)&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe Parry and Riposte is a form of &lt;a href=\"critical%20attack\"&gt;critical attack&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nParrying.\nPlayers may perform a parry and riposte by first positioning themselves directly in front of a parryable &lt;a href=\"enemy\"&gt;enemy&lt;/a&gt;. As the enemy attacks, players may parry with their left-handed &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; (the left-handed strong attack), deflecting their attack, and thus executing the parry. Enemies are momentarily stunned after this. Immediately after, the player can perform a light attack to execute a riposte.\nParrying does not always succeed, and requires precise timing. A parry that is executed too early or too late will grant the player some super &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, as well as some damage reduction from the attack that the player attempted to parry, but will not cause the opponent to be stunned or vulnerable to riposting. This type of parrying is often known as \"partial parrying\". Unlike full parries, partial parries can be used against almost any attack encountered in the game. Rarely, it is possible to both do a successful parry and still take damage. Parrying most often succeeds when the player is standing very close to his or her opponent, and on relatively even ground.\nThere are &lt;a href=\"https%3A//darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Shields%2BExplained\"&gt;three different speeds&lt;/a&gt; of parrying: fast, normal, and special (long). Certain weapons, such as &lt;a href=\"Thrusting%20Swords\"&gt;Thrusting Swords&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Curved%20Swords\"&gt;Curved Swords&lt;/a&gt;, have a very fast parrying speed (thus, requiring more precision from the player), &lt;a href=\"standard%20shields\"&gt;standard shields&lt;/a&gt; have a normal parrying speed, and certain specialized weapons and shields (such as the &lt;a href=\"Parrying%20Dagger\"&gt;Parrying Dagger&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Target%20Shield\"&gt;Target Shield&lt;/a&gt;) have a longer parrying animation. Weapons and shields that parry quickly have the advantage of allowing the player to recover from a failed parry more quickly, but weapons and shields that have a longer parry animation have a larger window of time in which their parries can be successful.\nMost humanoid enemies can be parried. Most enemies that can be &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;bed can also be parried. Almost every enemy that can be parried can also be riposted. The &lt;a href=\"Berenike%20Knight\"&gt;Berenike Knight&lt;/a&gt;s are the only exception to this rule. Multiple enemies attacking simultaneously close to one another can be parried at once, but only one of them can be riposted. &lt;a href=\"White%20phantom\"&gt;White phantom&lt;/a&gt;s can parry their summoners and vice versa, but they cannot be riposted. This presents a very efficient way of practicing &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; parrying.\nAlmost every &lt;a href=\"Small%20Shields\"&gt;small&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"medium%20shield\"&gt;medium shield&lt;/a&gt; can parry, with some exceptions. Many weapons (when equipped on the left hand) can parry too. Weapons and shields that can parry are listed below.\nAdditionally, it is possible to parry attacks with a shield that the player does not meet the requirements to use, although the timing window is much shorter.\nRiposting.\nThe riposte is a special attack executed directly after a parry, an execution move that deals extremely high damage (even more damage than a backstab). Ripostes deal high damage based on the base damage of the weapon and its &lt;a href=\"Critical%20attack\"&gt;critical rate&lt;/a&gt;. Certain weapon types, such as &lt;a href=\"daggers\"&gt;daggers&lt;/a&gt;, have higher critical rates than other weapons. &lt;a href=\"Thrusting%20Swords\"&gt;Thrusting Swords&lt;/a&gt; have higher &lt;a href=\"https%3A//darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_%28Dark_Souls%29%23Motion_Values\"&gt;Motion Values&lt;/a&gt; on criticals that allow them to deal more damage with ripostes than what their critical rate and damage statistics would suggest. Wearing the &lt;a href=\"Hornet%20Ring\"&gt;Hornet Ring&lt;/a&gt; increases the damage dealt by ripostes, and (in some cases) changes the animation.\nAfter executing a parry successfully, players have about one second to do the Riposte. During this time, they can also move or switch weapons, and still execute the Riposte successfully.\nRipostes cannot be interrupted. While in the motion of riposting, both the perpetrator and the victim are granted invincibility frames and cannot take further damage except for damage-over time effects such as being &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;poisoned&lt;/a&gt;, under the effects of &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;toxic&lt;/a&gt;, or while using &lt;a href=\"Power%20Within\"&gt;Power Within&lt;/a&gt;.\nShields cannot perform ripostes. Although most weapons can riposte, there are some exceptions, as listed below."}

When a left-hand weapon is wielded with both hands, its right-handed &lt;a href=\"Moveset%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;moveset&lt;/a&gt; is reversed and the parry move must be activated using RT/R2 (instead of LT/L2). A parry can not be performed when using a &lt;a href=\"power%20stance\"&gt;power stance&lt;/a&gt;, but it is still possible to parry while using a power stance when the right hand weapon can parry 1 handed.\nA parried enemy will become &lt;a href=\"stagger\"&gt;stagger&lt;/a&gt;ed, causing them to fall to the ground. There are two possible riposte moves that can be triggered after parrying an attack: a standing riposte and a ground riposte (see below).\nIn most cases, all weapon's attacks can be parried, except jumping attacks (excluding &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reapers&lt;/a&gt;). Most humanoid enemies can be parried and are also vulnerable to &lt;a href=\"guard%20break\"&gt;guard break&lt;/a&gt;. There are rare examples of enemies that can only be parried; &lt;a href=\"The%20Pursuer\"&gt;The Pursuer&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0being one such enemy. All hostile &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;phantoms&lt;/a&gt; can be parried and riposted (AI and &lt;a href=\"PvP%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;).\nParries in PvP must have their active frames line up with the attack's active frames on the attacker's screen.\nParry Frame Tables.\nThese tables are written in consideration of being at 60 fps on the last patch of the &lt;a href=\"Scholar%20of%20the%20First%20Sin\"&gt;Scholar of the First Sin&lt;/a&gt; release of the game (v1.03).\nStartup is the time after starting the animation that must happen before you can parry an attack.

Shields that can parry will have a small circular icon depicting a shield in the lower corner. There are generally 3 various parrying types: Fast, Normal, Special (Long).

This is done by approaching them in their staggered animation and pressing the Right Weak Attack button ( / ), either one- or two-handed.\nCertain enemies can be staggered instantly and become open to be riposted by successfully landing on their heads.

{"id": "143293", "revid": "33084951", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=143293", "title": "Parting Flame", "text": "Parting Flame is a &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Ashes%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Ashes of Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Pyromancer%27s%20Parting%20Flame\"&gt;Pyromancer's Parting Flame&lt;/a&gt; collects the death echoes of enemies that die while it is equipped, storing them up. When it collects twelve death echoes, an aura will surround the player, indicating that the skill is ready to use. Doing so will place the player in an extended animation which then restores one charge on their &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath echoes will only be stored so long as the Pyromancer's Parting Flame is equipped in a hand. Switching away from it will reset the echo count back to zero, however two-handing the weapon in the opposite hand will not. The Parting Flame can only store a maximum of twelve death echoes at one time, so any kills obtained while the skill is ready to use will be wasted. Only the orange Estus Flask can be the recipient of the death echoes, and only if it is not already full; it is not possible to restore &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Estus%20Flask\"&gt;Ashen Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt; charges with Parting Flame.\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nThe Pyromancer's Parting Flame can be used strategically to increase survivability when progressing through a level, as Estus Flask charges can be restored through normal play. While the Parting Flame must be equipped in order to store death echoes, it is not required to get kills by casting &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Pyromancies&lt;/a&gt; with it. This means that equipping the Parting Flame, and then two-handing the weapon in the opposite hand, allows the player to collect death echoes without expending FP.\nIt is recommended to allot additional Ashen Estus while using the Parting Flame, as regular Estus can be restored with this skill, and the skill itself costs FP to use. The Parting Flame pairs well with the &lt;a href=\"Executioner%27s%20Greatsword\"&gt;Executioner's Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;, as the latter can be used to essentially recoup the cost of using the former's weapon art.\nOnline gameplay.\nAs a phantom or dark spirit, the Pyromancer's Parting Flame can be invaluable in that it can be used to restore Estus charges, putting the player on closer parity with the host's Estus count due to Flask storage being halved as a phantom.\nIn particular, there is no requirement that the player be the one to get the kill in order to receive death echoes. So an invader can greatly benefit from equipping the Parting Flame, as any mob enemies killed by the host and his phantoms will strengthen the invader."}

Moving close to the Partizan will cause a &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Foliage\"&gt;Demonic Foliage&lt;/a&gt; to ambush the player upon leaving the nook.\nCharacteristics.\nUnlike most other spears, Partizan deals &lt;a href=\"Regular%20%28Damage%20Type%29\"&gt;Regular Damage&lt;/a&gt; on its one and two handed R2 attacks, in addition to its standard thrusts on all other attacks.

This coupled with the excellent scaling can make the Partizan a reliable strike weapon for &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;-focused builds (only the first strong attack of each set of 2 deals Strike damage, the second strong attack deals &lt;a href=\"Thrust%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Thrust&lt;/a&gt;)."}

The corpse must be freed with a projectile weapon before the weapon can be obtained.\nCharacteristics.\nWith powerful sweeps and ranged poking thrusts, the Partizan is a flexible polearm with diverse attacks that makes its return from previous \"Dark Souls\" games.\nDespite its mediocre reach and damage for a spear, it is capable of performing horizontal sweeps with its strong attacks, giving it the ability to catch enemies that attempt to sidestep most other spears' narrow thrusting attacks. This gives it high flexibility, as the different timings of each attack make it a force to be reckoned with in &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;. As well, being a standard weapon it can be &lt;a href=\"Infusion%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;infused&lt;/a&gt;, making it a useful weapon to wield on any number of builds due to its low wielding requirements.\nOne of the Partizan's most powerful features is its &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Spin%20Sweep\"&gt;Spin Sweep&lt;/a&gt;. This attack is not only immune to &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parries&lt;/a&gt;, but also grants &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt; to its wielder, covering a formidable zone with its wide sweeps and allowing it to trade against smaller weapons should they enter the player's radius of influence.\nUpgrades.\nReinforced with ."}

He is an opportunistic trickster with a strong animosity towards clerics.\nPlot.\n&lt;a href=\"Lautrec\"&gt;Knight Lautrec&lt;/a&gt; expresses misgivings about Patches before the player first encounters him, giving players new to the series a hint that Patches is not trustworthy.\nOn first meeting the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt;, Patches will ask, \"Are you a Cleric?\" An affirmative answer will result in him attacking the player, immediately ending his questline.\nIf meeting Patches before Reah has left for &lt;a href=\"the%20Catacombs\"&gt;the Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;, he will appear in the first area next to a bridge lever. Although seemingly neutral, his intentions are less than friendly. Upon the player's attempt to cross the bridge, Patches will attempt to kill the player by flipping it. The player may survive either by running back before the animation starts or by rolling off the bridge onto the conveniently placed ledge to the right of its center. If Patches was not spoken to before the player attempted to cross the bridge, doing so afterwards will result in him giving the player a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20a%20Lost%20Undead\"&gt;Soul of a Lost Undead&lt;/a&gt;. Speaking to him before attempting to cross, then speaking to him again after will prompt him to ask if the flip caused any trouble; an answer in the affirmative will result in Patches giving the player a &lt;a href=\"Humanity%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Humanity&lt;/a&gt;.\nPatches is encountered again early in the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Tomb of the Giants&lt;/a&gt;, not far from the earliest available &lt;a href=\"bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;. He will attempt to trick the player into looking over the edge of a cliff, and will promptly kick them off. Upon making their way back to him without dying, Patches will beg forgiveness, asking if he is still a friend. Dying before talking to Patches will cause him to question how you survived and become hostile. Answering in the negative will prompt Patches to give the player one &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Humanities\"&gt;Twin Humanities&lt;/a&gt;.\nPatches remains in the Tomb of the Giants until &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Nito\"&gt;Gravelord Nito&lt;/a&gt; is defeated, after which he will travel to &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt;. He will take up residence in an alcove near &lt;a href=\"Kingseeker%20Frampt\"&gt;Frampt&lt;/a&gt; and act as a vendor for the rest of the game. Patches sells some useful items, many of which are of limited stock, as well as assorted cleric equipment\u2014likely collected from earlier victims.\nLore.\nLittle is known about Patches or his background, although he has previously been acquainted with &lt;a href=\"Shiva%20of%20the%20East\"&gt;Shiva of the East&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Solaire%20of%20Astora\"&gt;Solaire of Astora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Lautrec%20of%20Carim\"&gt;Lautrec of Carim&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Petrus%20of%20Thorolund\"&gt;Petrus of Thorolund&lt;/a&gt;.\nPatches' very existence implies that he is trans-dimensional or that every reality contains a version of himself: the Hyena in \"Demon Souls\", the Spider in \"Bloodborne\", Trusty/Unbreakable in \"Dark Souls\", and the Untethered in \"Elden Ring\".\nStrategy.\nPatches will use his spear to his advantage and attack the player with his shield up. &lt;a href=\"Backstab\"&gt;Backstab&lt;/a&gt;bing can work well, though Patches may not leave his back open often."}
