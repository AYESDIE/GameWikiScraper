Executing a weak attack will dash forward with the shield up and ending with a strong thrusting attack; performing further weak attacks will execute the two-handed standard attacks of Valorheart starting from the second attack in the combo. Executing a strong attack will perform a strong shield bash after a short delay.\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nThe weak attack dash can be useful for aggressively attacking into enemies that attempt to quickly strike at targets within range, and which are weak to &lt;a href=\"Thrust%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Thrusting&lt;/a&gt; damage. And against enemies that guard with shields, the shield bash can open them up for a devastating riposte.\nOnline gameplay.\nThe Lion Stance greatly expands Valorheart's already varied moveset, giving the wielder even more options with which to surprise opponents. As Valorheart deals entirely physical damage, shields with 100% physical damage block will completely repel any damage it inflicts, so the shield bash gives the wielder a tool with which to get around it. The dashing thrust can be used as a mix-up against players that attempt to dodge the shield bash, only to be roll-caught by the delayed thrust."}

These creatures prowl the shallow waters of the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Amana\"&gt;Shrine of Amana&lt;/a&gt;, perpetually searching for sources of fresh Souls.\nLizardmen appear to be hollowed travelers who wear tattered clothing. Their exposed flesh appears to be raw. Typically, the Lizardmen will lie in wait within the water beside one of the paths in the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Amana\"&gt;Shrine of Amana&lt;/a&gt; for unknowing passers-by, at whom they will leap. They are often seen from afar with fireflies flying above them, which emit a particular sound.\nWhen hearing the song of a &lt;a href=\"Milfanito\"&gt;Milfanito&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brightbug\"&gt;Brightbug&lt;/a&gt;s will surround the Lizardmen, revealing their positions and reducing their aggro range almost to the point of passiveness, only attacking the player when extremely close.\nLizardmen are only encountered in the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Amana\"&gt;Shrine of Amana&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nLizardmen are weak enemies although they can be very dangerous if they manage to sneak up on an unaware player. Clouds of fireflies can be used to locate them under the water which enables the player to dispatch them from a distance.\nAlthough Lizardmen do not inflict much damage, they cause Bleed damage which can be fatal if there are other enemies nearby.\nExtreme caution must be taken when traversing the Shrine of Amana while holding a lit torch, as the torch will drastically increase the Lizardmen's aggro range and an overwhelming amount of them can pursue the player at once. As such, it is best not to wander with a lit torch unless the player is truly confident in their ability to take out the Lizardmen.\nIf surrounded by Brightbugs due to a Milfanito's song, their revealed positions and reduced aggro range will make it very easy to simply walk around the Lizardmen. This will also prevent a torch from increasing their aggro range."}

Kaathe's past attempts to find a candidate for the title of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Lord\"&gt;Dark Lord&lt;/a&gt;, prevent the linking of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, and to finally bring about the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Dark\"&gt;Dark Age&lt;/a&gt; of humans had all failed, leaving the gods in command of men and the world, and allowing the Age of Fire to continue, albeit increasingly faintly. However the Primordial Serpent had continued to try to reach his goals and the acceptance of these three sisters as his maidens represented the first step in finding and empowering a Dark Lord who could usurp the First Flame for themselves and use it to shape a new world for the sake of all Hollows - what was left of humanity after thousands of years of oppression by the &lt;a href=\"Darksign\"&gt;Darksign&lt;/a&gt;. And so Kaathe taught the three sisters, already highly skilled fencers, the art of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Hand%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark Hand&lt;/a&gt;, capable of absorbing the humanity of their enemies.\nWearing their &lt;a href=\"Black%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;dark attire&lt;/a&gt;, the three women would thus become the founders of the &lt;a href=\"Sable%20Church\"&gt;Sable Church&lt;/a&gt;: a faith and an organization that preached the coming of the Dark Lord that would claim the First Flame and aimed to offer salvation to all Hollows. At some point the three sisters, now mentors of the Sable Church, settled in a land that would become known as Londor, the Hollow Realm, and over time an increasing number of undead and hollows would find refuge there. In Londor, the Sable Church would construct black and twisted towers to serve as their physical place of worship, and Elfriede, as the eldest sister, became the leader of the organization. The fact that there were three founding sisters was important as it ensured that their legacy would survive, each being able to carry on their mission and ensure that the Dark Lord emerged even if the others went missing.\nOver time, the number of hollows that find refuge thanks to the Sable Church continued to increase until Londor became a true undead society, a \"Hollow Realm\". Its inhabitants were in fact wretchedly aged humans, fraught with deceit, and dubiously secretive, so it was no wonder that they are deeply detested in the rest of the world. The Hollows of Londor thus began to employ &lt;a href=\"Untrue%20White%20Ring\"&gt;illusory rings&lt;/a&gt; that allowed them to retain a human appearance even while hollow and &lt;a href=\"Purging%20Stone%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Purging Stones&lt;/a&gt; that reduced undead curse build-up and cured hollowing, allowing the inhabitants of Londor to feign normalcy and continue to live as apparently human, even if occasionally a hollow would fool even themselves and turn on their own kind. The inhabitants of Londor also managed to mine their stagnant humanity and use it to infuse titanite, creating &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Gem\"&gt;Hollow Gem&lt;/a&gt;s that they would then use to forge hollow weapons - artifacts that were able to peer into the \"essence\" of their wielders and increase their damage based on their luck, the unique and elusive essential property of humans. \nA culture and even religion completely opposite to the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20White\"&gt;Way of White&lt;/a&gt;, which worshiped the gods through miracles, also began to take shape in Londor. &lt;a href=\"Liliane\"&gt;Liliane&lt;/a&gt;, as one of the founders of the Sable Church, started to recount tales that portrayed the suffering and conflict of Hollows, which the church aimed to bring salvation to. She even created a &lt;a href=\"Londor%20Braille%20Divine%20Tome\"&gt;tome of dark miracles&lt;/a&gt; that were forbidden in the rest of the world as they offered salvation to the hollows and conversely cursed all living beings. The culture of Londor therefore not only rejected the gods and their rules and stories, but shifted the object of veneration towards the Hollow themselves, bringing attention to their tales and placing their faith on their own kind to perform miracles. The Sable Church thus developed several different dark miracles such as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Blade\"&gt;Dark Blade&lt;/a&gt;, which could be used to reinforce weapons with the power of the dark, and and even &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Again%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;sacrilegious miracles&lt;/a&gt; that blessed corpses, transforming them into dark traps, as they believed that if undeath was human there would be no need to hesitate blessing corpses that were, after all, incompatible with living things. The &lt;a href=\"Vow%20of%20Silence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;ancient dark miracles of Velka&lt;/a&gt;, that allowed the blocking of the magic of those around the caster, including themselves, were also recovered. \nNow a full-fledged organization, the Sable Church even began to train agents to enact its will in the wider world. Such agents, all skilled swordsmen, were taught to trust only their blade, and thus, entrusting of anyone they might encounter, they were said to bring the silence of Londor with them wherever they went. They also learned the art of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Hand%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark Hand&lt;/a&gt; passed down by Kaathe, the &lt;a href=\"Vow%20of%20Silence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;ancient miracles of Velka&lt;/a&gt;, now part of the repertoire of the Sable Church, and a forbidden &lt;a href=\"Affinity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;dark sorcery&lt;/a&gt; that infused a manifestation of humanity with strong emotions to make it tenaciously pursue its target. These swordsmen became known as the &lt;a href=\"Londor%20Pale%20Shade\"&gt;Pale Shades&lt;/a&gt; of Londor, a group of assassins who killed in the name and interests of the Sable Church in the rest of the world in order to fulfill their goals. They were all undying hollows that fought neither for honor nor exaltation and yielded nothing but withered moans, giving rise to much fear and contempt. They were equipped with lethal &lt;a href=\"Manikin%20Claws%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;curved claws&lt;/a&gt; that cause heavy bleeding and &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Throwing%20Knife%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;poisoned throwing knives&lt;/a&gt;. Though dark and shriveled hollows, they wore &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Shade%20Set\"&gt;pure white attire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sneering%20Mask\"&gt;golden masks&lt;/a&gt; with faint, kindly smiles which earned them the moniker \"Harlots of Death\".\n&lt;a href=\"Sir%20Vilhelm\"&gt;Sir Vilhelm&lt;/a&gt;, one of the hollow knights of Londor known for being a cold-blooded hangman, would also directly serve the three sisters of the Sable Church, becoming particularly loyal to &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Friede\"&gt;Elfriede&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe goal of Londor, however, always remained to find their awaited Lord of Hollows who was able to break the order of the gods and inherit the First Flame, wrestling it from its kiln and using it to reveal the true face of mankind . Thus, the Hollow Realm and the Sable Church continued to study the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Soul\"&gt;Dark Soul&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Darksign%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Darksign&lt;/a&gt;, so that they could gain the knowledge and power necessary to break the chains of the gods and usurp the First Flame. The result of their research was the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sigil\"&gt;Dark Sigil&lt;/a&gt;, an artifact capable of bypassing the Dark sign of Fire placed around the Dark Soul, allowing the darkness which had accumulated in the body to flow again, unlocking the true power of humans, thus allowing a Hollow to reach the strength required to usurp the Flame.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Friede\"&gt;Elfriede&lt;/a&gt;, as leader of the Sable Church, attempted to usurp the First Flame herself. However, she only managed to take control of a spark, turning into a blackflame, before she ended up failing as the power of the Flame consumed her, burning her face and leaving her an &lt;a href=\"Unkindled\"&gt;Unkindled&lt;/a&gt; ash. After her failure, she renounced everything, leaving behind her role as leader of the Sable Church, Londor and even her name, becoming known simply as \"Friede\". Having lost her purpose, she was eventually drawn into the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Painted World of Ariandel&lt;/a&gt; and came to consider it her new home, leaving &lt;a href=\"Yuria%20of%20Londor\"&gt;Yuria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liliane\"&gt;Liliane&lt;/a&gt; to carry on the mission of Londor.\nLearning from this failure, Londor created a method to further increase the future Lord of Hollows' dark power through a \"marriage ceremony\". By using the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Avowal\"&gt;Sword of Avowal&lt;/a&gt; in a ritual, the Dark Lord could extract and transfer the darkness of another Hollow into themselves, thus increasing their power to a sufficient level to claim the First Flame.\nAt some point before reaching his goal, &lt;a href=\"Darkstalker%20Kaathe\"&gt;Kaathe&lt;/a&gt; died, leaving the remaining sisters of the Sable Church to carry on his vision of an Age of Dark lead by the Dark Lord \nAs the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; continued to fade and &lt;a href=\"Lothric%2C%20Younger%20Prince\"&gt;Prince Lothric&lt;/a&gt; refused to link it, the &lt;a href=\"Unkindled\"&gt;Unkindled&lt;/a&gt; were exhumed from their graves to hunt down the &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lords of Cinder&lt;/a&gt; of the past that had refused to return to their \"thrones\" and serve as fuel for the Flame a second time. It was at this pivotal moment that Londor and the Sable Church decided to make their move.\nHundreds of Hollows were thus cast out from Londor and sent to &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt; on a pilgrimage with the specific goal of \"dying\". They were equipped with shell-shaped protections chained to their backs, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;robes of clerics&lt;/a&gt; created to contain the prevent them from becoming seedbeds for stagnant darkness during long journeys, which could manifest the &lt;a href=\"Pus%20of%20Man\"&gt;Pus of Man&lt;/a&gt;. In addition these pilgrims were given a &lt;a href=\"Atonement\"&gt;dark miracle&lt;/a&gt;, the only tale known to them, that they believed carried words of forgiveness. In reality they were cursed by this magic, which attracted more attention from foes, and consequently accelerated the achievement of their goal of \"dying\". These pilgrims of Londor, whose humanity had accumulated and stagnated inside their body during their journey, upon death, underwent a peculiar transformation which caused their corpse to grow and evolve into a new form of sentient life, similar in appearance to a humanoid insect. These humanoid \"Pilgrim Pupa\" are harmless on their own but are capable of manifesting and controlling physical bodies that resemble &lt;a href=\"Angel\"&gt;Angels&lt;/a&gt; equipped with large shiny wings and capable of striking with overwhelming power. Some Pilgrims, however, seemingly did not turn into Pupa that created angels, and instead became similar but more twisted entities known as a &lt;a href=\"Pilgrim%20Butterfly\"&gt;Pilgrim Butterfly&lt;/a&gt;. These Pilgrim Butterflies had only the vaguest of similarities to the angels, but yet like the Pilgrims still try to make their way to upper Lothric, flying around in the sky. A few of these Butterflies would even take a symbiotic host in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Armour\"&gt;Dragonslayer Armour&lt;/a&gt; similar to Angels and their Pupae, allowing them to control it but binding their life to it; those few Butterflies dying once the Armour was slain.\nThe pilgrims of Londor continued to reach Lothric by passing through the main gate across the bridge to get to the Cathedral. However, the bridge was broken when the High Walls appear with the sudden lifting of hundreds of meters of the rock under the city, preventing the pilgrims who have arrived from continuing. Despite this, one day one of the Angels spawned from their corpses managed to visit &lt;a href=\"Gertrude\"&gt;Gertrude&lt;/a&gt;, the holy maiden of &lt;a href=\"Gwynevere%2C%20Princess%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Gwynevere, Queen of Lothric&lt;/a&gt; and it revealed to her a &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Pillars%20of%20Light\"&gt;truth&lt;/a&gt; capable of manifesting pillars of light. The holy maiden was convinced by this truth and began to spread the worship of those she considered \"divine messengers\". However this faith was viewed as heresy in Lothric, as it opposed the worship of the ancient gods and the duty to continue linking the First Flame, so was consequently unrecognized by any of the Three Pillars that govern the realm, leading to a civil war inside the walls of Lothric between those still loyal to the Pillars and the &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Knight\"&gt;Winged Knight&lt;/a&gt;s that followed Gertrude's angelic faith\nAt a certain point even &lt;a href=\"Yuria%20of%20Londor\"&gt;Yuria&lt;/a&gt;, one of the founders of the Sable Church of Londor, arrived in Lothric.

It is useful in most situations and its low stat requirements and weight allows it to be wielded by most starting classes given some light stat investments. It features broad slashes and quick thrusting attacks, allowing it to stay effective in a multitude of engagements that bigger or less versatile weapons may struggle with.\nAdditionally, the Long Sword also performs well with infusions and can stay competitive with many heavy weapons in spite of its status as a jack-of-all-trades. With its speed allowing for much more frequent hits, it is especially effective against more agile targets. However the weapon is rather poor for trading hits as it struggles to both use poise and break it.\nFurthermore, the &lt;a href=\"Stance%20%28Straight%20Sword%29\"&gt;Stance&lt;/a&gt; grants the weapon some extra mobility and reach, and allows it to go up against shields effectively.

A &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; will be patrolling on the left side, so it is advised to take it out first lest it meddles during the fight.\nThe player may start attacking Kirk at a distance as soon as he finishes spawning, although after being hit once or twice he will start evading most attacks.\nWhile coming equipped with a &lt;a href=\"Spiked%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;, Kirk will rely more on an offensive approach. Since he keeps his defenses down for most of the fight, the player may take the first step and receive him with a two-handed attack. He will frequently use &lt;a href=\"Stance%20%28Straight%20Sword%29\"&gt;Stance&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to break through the player's defenses. Lure him into attacking and make him miss, then counterattack.\nWhen attacked, he will often roll in the player's direction in an attempt to inflict contact damage thanks to the thorns that cover his armor. The damage is minimal, although it does drain some &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt;; evade to the side. If he manages to inflict damage, don't lose composure and gain some distance, as attacking him at this moment usually means taking more damage from his armor due to being in close proximity to the player.\nThrowable weapons like &lt;a href=\"Throwing%20Knife%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;knives&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"kukri\"&gt;kukri&lt;/a&gt;s are useful against him during the fight.\nIt is possible to cheese Kirk by running back up to the ledge where the first &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Slave\"&gt;Giant Slave&lt;/a&gt; can be fought. Kirk can not path to this spot and will stand underneath the ledge instead, where the player can launch spells at him with impunity. Spells that move the player forward will not work as they will knock the player off the ledge, and it is recommended to bring &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Estus%20Flask\"&gt;Ashen Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt;s to maximize the amount of casts available."}

It deals lower damage than the &lt;a href=\"Broadsword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;broadsword&lt;/a&gt;, which is available just as early, leaving its thrust attacks as its only redeeming feature. Those thrusts, however, have a hidden penalty to counter damage, leaving it with no strong use cases compared to its contemporaries. \nEven worse is the common \u201cnew player trap\u201d fire longsword, which can be picked up rather early in the game. Fire is the most resisted element in the game by a wide margin, reducing it\u2019s value as an infusion. At that early point you don\u2019t yet have access to a spell buff, meaning your method of increasing damage would be a resin, which cannot be applied to an elementally infused weapon. Additionally, infused weapons are even less efficient for damage from scaling than uninfused melee weapons. As a result, using even a simple uninfused longsword early on would be more effective, without mentioning more effective weapons in general. \nIn PvP straightswords are generally one of the more effective weapon classes, and the longsword sits near the top of the bunch. Its versatile moveset and low stat requirements make it easy to fit into many builds, while giving the player plenty of options on how to attack or respond. The reduced counter modifier on thrust attacks is significantly less important as a factor, and scaling damage gains slightly more importance in PvP as a whole. It\u2019s not the best all around, but its moveset is second to none, standing as one of the most effective and efficient weapon options.\nTrivia.\nA reskinned Longsword was available as a promotional weapon for the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20the%20Ivory%20King\"&gt;Crown of the Ivory King&lt;/a&gt; DLC for two weeks after the patch on September 30th, 2014.

This boss will use physical attacks against the player as well as using its sword as a sort of \"lightning rod\".

Before the King's fall and the collapse of his kingdom, the knight would serve as a test to warriors who wished to serve under the king. After Vendrick went into hiding in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Crypt\"&gt;Undead Crypt&lt;/a&gt;, the knight from then on served as the first line of defense against those attempting to pursue the now &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;hollowed&lt;/a&gt; king. It continues to challenge individuals who cross its path.\nSummons.\n&lt;a href=\"Benhart%20of%20Jugo\"&gt;Benhart of Jugo&lt;/a&gt; can be summoned for the boss fight. His summon sign is located on the left side when approaching the &lt;a href=\"Fog%20Door%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;fog door&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"\", two additional summons were added:\nAttacks.\nLeap: Leaps into the air in the player's direction. He will always use this as his first attack after the player passes through the fog door. Counter-intuitively, the best way to dodge it is to run straight forward and roll beneath him.\nCharge: Charges forward and proceeds to lunge at the player. Only used when the player has retained some distance. Like most charging attacks, it does not track well and can be dodged easily.\nSummon: Places the shield on the ground and proceeds to summon an NPC, if online and summoning a player the knight will plant his sword in the ground. This move takes several seconds to complete and is possible to stagger him out of it with a high poise-damaging weapon. He takes reduced damage while in this phase.\nLightning Blade: Uses the lightning to electrify his sword and makes a horizontal swing in the player's direction. The sword is only imbued for that one attack. It can strike some distance around his back as well as directly in front of him.\nBalls of Lightning: Uses the lightning to electrify his sword and makes a horizontal swipe that shoots out five electricity\u00a0balls. They spread out as they proceed and can be stepped through. They do not fan out for very long; being a fair distance away will avoid them completely.\nLightning Trail: Uses the lightning to electrify his sword and performs an overhead attack that sends a lightning trail that\u00a0follows the player. Can be dodged by rolling to either side.\nDefenses.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense. -20% strike means taking 120% damage.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 Looking Glass Knight by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vos9uTeMM78&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

He once wore an &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Sun%27s%20Firstborn\"&gt;ancient ring&lt;/a&gt; capable of boosting the strength of miracles. He was said to have had respect only for arms and nothing else, and wielded the &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Blade\"&gt;Sunlight Blade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lightning%20Spear\"&gt;Great Lightning Spear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis foolishness led to the stripping of his deific status and the expunging of his existence from history, with his name being forgotten. Sunlight Blade, which had the power to boost a weapon with rays of the sun in the form of lightning, was left on Gwyn's coffin, perhaps as a final farewell.\nIdentity.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;\", item descriptions and in-game text paint a more definitive picture, strongly implying that the identity of Lord Gwyn's Firstborn is &lt;a href=\"the%20Nameless%20King\"&gt;the Nameless King&lt;/a&gt;:\nGiven how the firstborn only had respect for arms, it's possible that he chose to ally with the dragons, hence why the Gods would expunge him from history. It is known that the firstborn left the &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Blade\"&gt;Sunlight Blade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Miracle&lt;/a&gt; on Gwyn's honorary tomb in &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; as a final farewell, which could only mean that Gwyn had already departed for the &lt;a href=\"Kiln%20of%20the%20First%20Flame\"&gt;Kiln of the First Flame&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarriors of Sunlight.\nGwyn's firstborn shares his symbol with the &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Warrior of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Medal\"&gt;Sunlight Medal&lt;/a&gt;. The covenant itself is closely related to the firstborn, the members being referred to as his warriors, and the god is said to watch over the covenant closely. Assuming the player meets the correct requisites, it is possible to join by praying at the Sunlight Altar, located in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Parish\"&gt;Undead Parish&lt;/a&gt;, or by talking to &lt;a href=\"Solaire%20of%20Astora\"&gt;Solaire of Astora&lt;/a&gt;, a fanatical member.\nThe covenant and symbol both survived into the times of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt;. In Lothric, the symbol on the sunlight medals was considered holy.\nStatues.\nA statue of a mother holding a sword-wielding child, thought to represent the God of War, is located in front the Sunlight Altar bonfire.

These souls were found by four beings:\n&lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Nito\"&gt;Nito, First of the Dead&lt;/a&gt; used his Lord Soul to release a miasma of death during the &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; War.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Witch of Izalith&lt;/a&gt; used her soul to weave great firestorms. When the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; started to fade, the Witch attempted to recreate it using her Lord Soul. The attempt (at first) failed, and she, as well as many of &lt;a href=\"Izalith\"&gt;Izalith&lt;/a&gt;'s inhabitants, were corrupted by this, the inhabitants were transformed into &lt;a href=\"Demon%20%28lore%29\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;, while the Witch herself was turned into the &lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, a bed of life from which all demons came from. Despite this, she did indeed eventually \"succeed\" in regards to the &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Flame\"&gt;Chaos Flame&lt;/a&gt; and gaining control over it.\n&lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; used his soul to weave lightning that he wielded against the dragons. Gwyn would later split his soul, giving fragments of it to worthy servants, the most notable being as &lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;Seath the Scaleless&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Kings\"&gt;Four Kings&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Furtive%20Pygmy\"&gt;Furtive Pygmy&lt;/a&gt; split their soul into countless fragments, becoming the ancestor of the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; race.

Gwyn had an uncle in Allfather Lloyd, and The Witch was accompanied by her adult daughters when she claimed her soul, so it is possible they may have existed before claiming their Lord Souls.\nDragon War.\nWith the strength given to them by the Lord Souls, the three waged a war on the &lt;a href=\"Everlasting%20Dragons\"&gt;Everlasting Dragons&lt;/a&gt;. They were joined by &lt;a href=\"Seath\"&gt;Seath&lt;/a&gt;, a scaleless albino dragon that pillaged the Primordial Crystal from them as well and turned on his own kind.\nTo combat the dragons, Gwyn released grand bolts of light so powerful that they stripped the dragons of their stone scales. With her daughters, the Witch wove firestorms that incinerated the land. Once this was done, Nito arrived for the killing blow by releasing the miasma of death upon the dragons. Soon the dragons were defeated - but not gone - and the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Age of Fire&lt;/a&gt; began.\nEven after the war, Gwyn was known to have sporting hunts of those descended from the dragons.\nAge of Fire.\nThe kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt; was established, and the Lords took to their different homes and agendas. Gwyn had his city of the gods, &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;, built in the center of Lordran, which would eventually be inhabited by his children, his faithful &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Knight\"&gt;Silver Knight&lt;/a&gt;s, and other &lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;members of his clan&lt;/a&gt;. These include other deities, such as the king's &lt;a href=\"Four%20Knights%20of%20Gwyn\"&gt;four knights&lt;/a&gt;. \nSeath was awarded dukedom, even receiving a fragment of Gwyn's soul, and was rewarded with an &lt;a href=\"Duke%27s%20Archives\"&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt;. He retreated into his new home to study immortality, through the Primordial Crystal, and his discoveries would inspire scholars to pursue Seath's art of Sorcery as a result of this. He also bequeathed fragments to &lt;a href=\"Four%20Kings\"&gt;four humans&lt;/a&gt;, and naming them rulers of New Londo, for their foresight.\nThe Witch established the civilization of &lt;a href=\"Izalith\"&gt;Izalith&lt;/a&gt; underground and continued to experiment with fire sorcery.\nThe Fast-Fading Flame and the Birth of Chaos.\nGwyn found one day that the First Flame was fading, and that once it had burnt out the Age of Dark would begin.\nThe Lords feared the Dark, and sought to prolong the Age of Fire. The Witch of Izalith attempted to create a new flame. However, this new &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Flame\"&gt;Chaos Flame&lt;/a&gt; grew out of control and consumed the Witch of Izalith and many of her children, soon forming into a creation known as the &lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, which consumed Izalith and mutated most of the Witch of Izalith's remaining children into abominable creatures, while also turning her only &lt;a href=\"Ceaseless%20Discharge\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt; into a volcanic monstrosity. From the Chaos Flame came the race of &lt;a href=\"Demon%27s%20Souls\"&gt;Demons&lt;/a&gt;, against which Gwyn waged war. The Silver Knights that fought in this war were scorched and became the Black Knights.\nFearing the upcoming Age of Dark and potentially humans as well, Gwyn took some of his knights with him left to the &lt;a href=\"Kiln%20of%20the%20First%20Flame\"&gt;Kiln of the First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, sacrificing himself to rekindle the First Flame. The Black Knights who followed after Gwyn were reduced to ash, and Gwyn himself became hollow.\nThe extension of the Age of Fire was not without consequences. As a result, the &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; curse arose from Gwyn's actions. Humans who were afflicted by the curse bore the Darksign. Those that bore it would be revived after death, though their humanity would be lost, and without restoring it would eventually lose their sanity.\nAftermath.\nSeath was driven to madness as a result of his experiments and accrued knowledge. His &lt;a href=\"Channeler\"&gt;attendants&lt;/a&gt; would kidnap humans from across the land to be experimented on and even the maidens of Gwynevere. Eventually he discovered a kind of immortality, being invincible so long as the crystal remained. Through the knowledge accumulated by Seath, the human sorcerer &lt;a href=\"Big%20Hat%20Logan\"&gt;Logan&lt;/a&gt; would be able to craft new spells and further augment his own spells, though he too would be driven mad much like Seath was.\nAt some point the &lt;a href=\"The%20Nameless%20King\"&gt;Gwyn's firstborn&lt;/a&gt; betrayed the gods and allied with the descendants of the dragons, and his name was stripped from him, being removed from all recorded history such as annals and statues.\n&lt;a href=\"Darkstalker%20Kaathe\"&gt;Darkstalker Kaathe&lt;/a&gt;, who opposed Gwyn's actions, attempted to bring about the Age of Dark and the coming of its ruler, the Dark Lord; most travelling to &lt;a href=\"Oolacile\"&gt;Oolacile&lt;/a&gt; and manipulating the citizens into upturning the grave of \"&lt;a href=\"Manus%2C%20Father%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;primordial man&lt;/a&gt;\". This resulted in Oolacile's fall as it began to be swallowed by the &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt;, consuming the land and corrupting its citizens. Kaathe also went to New Londo, seducing the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Kings\"&gt;Four Kings&lt;/a&gt; with the art of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Hand\"&gt;lifedrain&lt;/a&gt;, which corrupted them and their knights. In an effort to contain his &lt;a href=\"Darkwraith%20%28enemy%29\"&gt;darkwraiths&lt;/a&gt;, New Londo was flooded -an act that ultimately cost the lives of the city's inhabitants.\nOne of Gwyn's four knights, &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Artorias\"&gt;Artorias&lt;/a&gt;, and his wolf companion &lt;a href=\"Sif\"&gt;Sif&lt;/a&gt; made a &lt;a href=\"Covenant%20of%20Artorias\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt; with the beings of the Abyss that allowed him to traverse it, so that he could hunt the Darkwraiths. Artorias later arrived in Oolacile in an attempt to combat the spread of the Abyss, but was overcome and was forced to sacrifice his greatshield to save Sif. This left him unprotected from the Abyss, and he later became corrupted and driven to madness.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20White\"&gt;Way of White&lt;/a&gt; was usurped by Gwyn's uncle, &lt;a href=\"Allfather%20Lloyd\"&gt;Lloyd&lt;/a&gt;, who also would start hunts against the Undead. \nEventually, the undead were corralled into several &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Undead%20Asylum\"&gt;asylums&lt;/a&gt; to await the end of the world, for it is prophesied by Astora - who themselves inherited the prophecy from Frampt - that one day an &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; will escape the prison and succeed Gwyn in linking the fire. At the same time, Kaathe preaches that this chosen has the opportunity to become the new Dark Lord and usher in the Age of Dark.\nThe Four Lords.\n&lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Nito\"&gt;Gravelord Nito&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe First of the Dead, Nito participated in the war against the Everlasting Dragons. Using his Lord Soul, Nito unleashed a miasma of death upon them.\nAfter the war, Nito resided within the Tomb of the Giants, where he governed the death of all living things. He also has a cult devoted to spreading death, called the &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Servant\"&gt;Gravelord Servants&lt;/a&gt;, who kill all over time and space and prove their duty to Nito by presenting him the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Death\"&gt;Eyes of Death&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Witch%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;The Witch of Izalith&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Witch used the power of her Lord Soul to weave great storms of fire against the Everlasting Dragons. She passed fragments of this soul to her children, the Daughters of Chaos, and her only &lt;a href=\"Ceaseless%20Discharge\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt;. Like her children, she had ashen skin and blue lips, though she stood much taller than them and seems to be of identical height to the staves her children used for flame sorcery.\nAs the fires faded, she tried to create a new flame to replicate the First Flame, but it backfired and ended up costing her life, and gave birth to the race of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;. Her children were also corrupted, except for &lt;a href=\"Quelana\"&gt;Quelana&lt;/a&gt;, who taught a &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;flame manipulating art&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"Salaman%20the%20Master%20Pyromancer\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; and became the mother of pyromancy. Many years later, the demons began to die out, as the flame of chaos began to fade much like the First Flame did.\n&lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;.\nGwyn used the power granted from the Lord Soul to create bolts of sunlight that he used to peel the scales from the dragons. His race has wildly varied physical appearances, though most have whitish skin and are usually taller than humans, however there are many exceptions to this standard.\nGwyn became the king of Lordran, and he bestowed fragments of his Lord Soul to Nito, the Witch of Izalith, Seath, and the Four Kings of New Londo. He had four loyal knights and a host of Silver Knights. His executioner, &lt;a href=\"Smough\"&gt;Smough&lt;/a&gt;, also wished to become a knight but was seen as unfit due to his cannibalism.\nIn his fear of the Age of Dark, he sacrificed himself to the First Flame, prolonging the Age of Fire and becoming Lord of Cinder. This act rendered Gwyn Hollow.\nAt some point, his firstborn son tamed a stormdrake, and allied with the dragon descendants. For this treachery, he was stripped of his godhood and banished (albeit, not by Gwyn), expunged from all records of history.\n&lt;a href=\"Furtive%20Pygmy\"&gt;Furtive Pygmy&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike the other Lords, the Dark Soul did not have any instantly apparent effect on the Pygmy. They appear to have looked like a generic hollow before claiming their soul.\nThe Furtive Pygmy's ultimate role, actions, and fate are largely unknown. He is mostly forgotten, save for adherents of Kaathe and some inhabitants of the Ringed City."}

One such case is &lt;a href=\"Aldrich%2C%20Devourer%20of%20Gods\"&gt;Aldrich&lt;/a&gt;, who became a Lord only because he had the strength to become one, despite having obtained it by devouring an untold number of humans for his own pleasure.\nAt some point the Lords of Cinder were taken while still linking the Flame, so that they possessed &lt;a href=\"Cinders%20of%20a%20Lord\"&gt;Embers&lt;/a&gt; of it in their bodies, and were buried. This practice would have allowed for a failsafe in case the First Flame could no longer be linked, resurrecting past Lords who would have to sacrifice themselves again and donate their remaining sparks.\nThe continuous linking of the Flame led to the birth &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Soul of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;, the deific manifestation of the souls of all those who have linked themselves to the Flame through history. This being, although appearing as an empty husk, inherits all the abilities of the Lords of Cinders who have come before.

Consequently, once the Flame eventually goes out, at some point these Lords of Cinder from the past will rise again and wander the lands like tiny flames. These beings will possess fragments of the First Flame stored within their bodies in the form of &lt;a href=\"Cinders%20of%20a%20Lord\"&gt;cinders&lt;/a&gt;, giving them the powers of the Flame in a world that will be enveloped in Darkness.\nNotes.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;"}

They were:\nA fourth unique Lord Soul called the \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Soul\"&gt;Dark Soul&lt;/a&gt;\" was found by the &lt;a href=\"Furtive%20Pygmy\"&gt;Furtive Pygmy&lt;/a&gt;, who is the ancestor of the humans.

A distant descendant of him is the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe War of Fire.\nWith their new found power the Lords challenged the dominion of the Everlasting Dragons over the World. The Lords allied with one of the dragons, &lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;Seath the Scaleless&lt;/a&gt;, who sought the immortal scales of the dragons and thus betrayed his own kind. A very long and destructive war was begun by the Lords and their amassed armies. Gwyn used his powerful bolts to peel their stone scales, while the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Witch of Izalith&lt;/a&gt; and her Daughters of Chaos wove great firestorms against them and finally the &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Nito\"&gt;Gravelord Nito&lt;/a&gt; unleashed a miasma of death upon the dragons.

He also gave another part of his Lord Soul as well as the titles of \"King\" to the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Kings\"&gt;Four Kings&lt;/a&gt;, the leaders of &lt;a href=\"New%20Londo%20Ruins\"&gt;New Londo&lt;/a&gt;, in recognition of their foresight.

In an effort to prolong Age of Fire, the Witch of Izalith tried to recreate the First Flame, but the experiment failed and a flame called \"The Flame of Chaos\" is created instead, which transformed her into the &lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; and many creatures into the demons that roam Lordran. Her children are transformed as well, with her son becoming a flame demon called &lt;a href=\"Ceaseless%20Discharge\"&gt;Ceaseless Discharge&lt;/a&gt; and her daughter &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Witch%20Quelaag\"&gt;Quelaag&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quelaag%27s%20Sister\"&gt;her sister&lt;/a&gt; partially into spiders. Her followers stay loyal to her, however, and become known as the \"Witches of Chaos\". Only her daughter, &lt;a href=\"Quelana%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Quelana&lt;/a&gt;, escaped the fire and becomes the mother of pyromancy. This being said, Mother Izalith did eventually \"succeed\" in stabilizing the Chaos Flame with 2 of her sisters.\n&lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn&lt;/a&gt;, in a final effort to save the Age of Fire, marches with a great deal of his army to the &lt;a href=\"Kiln%20of%20the%20First%20Flame\"&gt;Kiln of the First Flame&lt;/a&gt; and sacrifices himself to link with the First Flame, turning the Kiln to ash and incinerating his entire army (making them the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight\"&gt;Black Knight&lt;/a&gt;s, who later walk Lordran). The attempt is temporarily successful, however, as the Age of Fire was only extended for at least 1000 years. &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn&lt;/a&gt; became a &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;Hollow&lt;/a&gt; and is from then on known as \"&lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Four%20Kings\"&gt;Four Kings&lt;/a&gt; became corrupted and were seduced by evil at some point by &lt;a href=\"Darkstalker%20Kaathe\"&gt;Kaathe&lt;/a&gt; after Gwyn's fall and their servants turned into &lt;a href=\"Darkwraith%20%28enemy%29\"&gt;Darkwraiths&lt;/a&gt;. In an effort to stop them &lt;a href=\"New%20Londo%20Ruins\"&gt;New Londo&lt;/a&gt; was flooded with all of its population, trapping the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Kings\"&gt;Four Kings&lt;/a&gt; with their Darkwraiths in &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;the Abyss&lt;/a&gt;.\nSoon after, the deities began leaving &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt;. Gwyndolin was the only one of Gwyn's children to stay behind...\nSeath, who became obsessed with his research and experiments, amassed countless tomes and was eventually driven mad - at least, how normal people see it - by his research, becoming the founder of sorcery.\nAt least a thousand years pass and the events of \"Dark Souls\" begin to unfold..."}

Its elemental resistances are on the unorthodox side, being resistant to &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; damage much like the &lt;a href=\"Sunless%20Set\"&gt;Sunless Set&lt;/a&gt; but being unusually weak to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage alongside &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt;. Its resistance to &lt;a href=\"Negative%20Status%20Effects%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;status effects&lt;/a&gt; is rather unusual, as it is fairly well-rounded outside of its intolerance to &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; buildup.\nIt possesses a rather poor &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt;-to-weight ratio, making it closer in protection to &lt;a href=\"Medium%20Armor%20Sets%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;medium armor sets&lt;/a&gt; than to heavy sets. This makes it rather weak for trading against other large weapons, even when wielding an &lt;a href=\"Ultra%20Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Ultra Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;."}

He is mute and crippled, with legs so weak that he is unable to stand upright for more than a second, requiring him to walk on his knees or crawl most of the time. He is extremely tall, with the Ashen One only barely passing his knees.\nLothric appears much more frail, and has noticeably dark veins, indicative of his disease, but still speaks as royalty with a formal and cold tone. Though shorter than his brother, he is still twice as tall as the Ashen One. He wears a &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20Set\"&gt;black robe&lt;/a&gt; with golden decorations. During the second phase he will teleport down and hold on to his brother's back, using an unfamiliar holy light energy that functions like crystal sorceries of the highest level.\nLocation.\nThe Twin Princes are found at the top of &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;Lothric Castle&lt;/a&gt;, after clearing the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt;. The player must cross the second of the great bridges, which is guarded by a large number of entrenched &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Soldier%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Hollow Soldiers&lt;/a&gt;, as well as blue-uniformed red-eyed &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Knight\"&gt;Lothric Knight&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThere are two accessible elevator shortcuts to this boss. The first is found at the end of the Grand Archives, immediately after defeating &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Knight%20Albert\"&gt;Lion Knight Albert&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hand%20Kamui\"&gt;Black Hand Kamui&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daughter%20of%20Crystal%20Kriemhild\"&gt;Daughter of Crystal Kriemhild&lt;/a&gt;, and before the great bridge where the path diverges to allow the player to access &lt;a href=\"Gertrude\"&gt;Gertrude&lt;/a&gt;'s prison. The elevator here takes the player down to the Grand Archives bonfire. The second is at the end of the great bridge and before entering Lothric's throne room, an elevator on the right will take the player down to the area beyond the castle keep, to the intersection that leads to the &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Armour\"&gt;Dragonslayer Armour&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20of%20Sunlight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Sunlight Altar&lt;/a&gt;. The second elevator is a double lift that contains a &lt;a href=\"Titanite%20Slab%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Titanite Slab&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom.\nLore.\nLothric and Lorian are the sons of &lt;a href=\"Oceiros%2C%20the%20Consumed%20King\"&gt;Oceiros, King of Lothric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gwynevere%2C%20Princess%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Gwynevere, Queen of Lothric&lt;/a&gt; and consequently the princes of the &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;kingdom of Lothric&lt;/a&gt;. \nLorian, as the eldest prince, was designated heir to the throne and for this reason he received the &lt;a href=\"Lorian%27s%20Set\"&gt;ancient brass armor&lt;/a&gt; handed down by the royal family together with a &lt;a href=\"Lorian%27s%20Helm\"&gt;crown helmet&lt;/a&gt; patterned with flame, symbol of the kingdom's tradition of firelinking. Lorian was raised as a knight and proved his incredible prowess on the battlefield, leading a war against the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20%28lore%29\"&gt;Chaos Demons&lt;/a&gt; and even capturing some of them to serve as &lt;a href=\"Stray%20Demon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;slaves&lt;/a&gt; for Lothric. \nThe prince even faced the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Prince\"&gt;Demon Prince&lt;/a&gt; in a duel and was able to single-handedly defeat him, resulting in his &lt;a href=\"Lorian%27s%20Greatsword\"&gt;greatsword&lt;/a&gt; being eternally scorched with the flame of chaos and his armor to be stained black.\nLothric instead, as the youngest prince, was designated to become a &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;, sacrificing himself in the linking of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; to keep the Age of Fire alive. The prince was in fact the hope not only of the entire kingdom but the result of the obsession of the royal family and the king to produce a worthy Champion from among their ranks as a symbol of their divine mandate and duty. For the young man who was supposed to enter the &lt;a href=\"Kiln%20of%20the%20First%20Flame%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Kiln of the Flame&lt;/a&gt; arena, a &lt;a href=\"Lothric%27s%20Holy%20Sword\"&gt;platinum sword&lt;/a&gt; was created and blessed with strong magic by &lt;a href=\"Emma%2C%20High%20Priestess%20of%20Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;the High Priestess&lt;/a&gt; even before he was ready to fullfill his destiny. Oceiros in fact created immense propaganda around Lothric, not only giving him the name of the kingdom, but building statues that depicted him ready for sacrifice and with his sacred sword even before he linked the Flame, already preparing his throne at the &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt; who called him the hope of the kingdom.\nDespite all the hopes that were placed in him, Lothric soon revealed himself to be a sick and shriveled child, so weak that he never grew out of his &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20Set\"&gt;baby clothes&lt;/a&gt;, which remained his only clothing throughout his life and were blessed to at least try to keep him healthy.\nLothric continued to live and at some point &lt;a href=\"Aldia%2C%20Scholar%20of%20the%20First%20Sin\"&gt;Aldia&lt;/a&gt;, the first of the Grand Archives scholars and doubtful of the linking of the Flame, became his private mentor. The frail prince still demonstrated talent for sorcery, for which he did not need a medium being the son of a deity, and learned several &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;powerful&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Soulmass%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;refined&lt;/a&gt; spells.\nWhen the royal family realized that Lothric would not improve from his condition , they resorted to repulsive acts in an attempt to obtain a worthy Champion for the linking: the rulers would in fact bind the souls of the two brother princes together with a &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;curse&lt;/a&gt;, in the hope that the weaker Lothric would thus share the strength of Lorian, making them able to sacrifice themselves to the Flame together. Despite the monstrous practice, Lorian himself had the desire to submit to the curse, to try to help his younger brother, even at the cost of depriving the kingdom of the heir he represented.\nHowever, fate played a bad joke once again: the souls of the two brothers, linked so closely that they could nearly meld together, made them inseparable and Lorian could not die if Lothric did not too. However, their union also led the older brother to share the younger's condition, making Lorian crippled and mute to the point of being unable to walk on his own legs and the two unable to link the Flame. The now twin princes thus found themselves unable to fulfill the destiny for which they had been brought into the world and would become inseparable in kinship, fueled by their grief for their fate.. As a consequence &lt;a href=\"Oceiros%2C%20the%20Consumed%20King\"&gt;King Oceiros&lt;/a&gt;, consumed by madness and the search for a \"worthy heir\" abandoned the government to try to transform himself into a dragon and the rest of the kingdom sank into chaos, between a &lt;a href=\"Gertrude\"&gt;war of faith&lt;/a&gt; among the ranks of the army and the &lt;a href=\"Pus%20of%20Man\"&gt;consequences&lt;/a&gt; of the fading of the First Flame.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; began to fade and the time came for &lt;a href=\"Lothric%2C%20Younger%20Prince\"&gt;Prince Lothric&lt;/a&gt; to fulfill his duty and and become a &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;, at least helping with the linking ritual, he simply refused. After reflecting on his &lt;a href=\"Aldia%2C%20Scholar%20of%20the%20First%20Sin\"&gt;mentor&lt;/a&gt;'s teachings, the state of the kingdom and the world, his cursed life and the atrocities committed to continue to link the Flame the prince decided to ignore his \"duty\", refusing to continue the legacy of the Lords, and instead chose to wait for the Flame's death from the distance. In fact, the prince retired to the top of his castle together with his brother Lorian with whom he shared his soul, protected by his royal guard and the exponents of the Three Pillars: &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Knight%20Albert\"&gt;Lion Knight Albert&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hand%20Kamui\"&gt;Black Hand Kamui&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daughter%20of%20Crystal%20Kriemhild\"&gt;Daughter of Crystal Kriemhild&lt;/a&gt; . \nThe prince's decision led the system managing the linking of the Flame to resort to an emergency measure: ringing the bells and awakening the Lords of Cinder of the past from their graves, beings who had linked the Flame and had been buried with part of it in their bodies, to unite their fire and restore energy to the fading Flame. However, not even this attempt was successful as most of the awakened Lords of Cinder, for different reasons, decided to abandon their duties, refusing to sit on their thrones and sacrifice themselves again, preferring to return to their lands.\nAs a last desperate plan it was decided to ring the bells again and this time awaken the &lt;a href=\"Unkindled\"&gt;Unkindled&lt;/a&gt;, beings who had tried to link the Flame but, being too weak, had been turned into ashes and buried in the &lt;a href=\"Cemetery%20of%20Ash\"&gt;Cemetery of Ash&lt;/a&gt;, to make so that they would go and kill the Lords of Cinder, bringing their their cinders back to &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt;. Many of these Unkindled thus attempted to storm the castle to kill Lothric but were all killed by the royal guards or by his brother Lorian.\nFight overview.\nWhen the player enters the throne room, they will view a cutscene where Lothric, Younger Prince addresses them, stating his disdain for his duty to become a Lord of Cinder. During this Lorian, Elder Prince, will crawl from the shadows and prepare to fight the Ashen One.\nThe battle will begin with the player facing Lorian alone. While Lorian is crippled below the waist and has trouble moving by himself, he is aided by Lothric, who will use his magic to teleport Lorian around the arena, whether it is to a blind spot to the player's side or away to allow him to use his special attacks. All of Lorian's attacks deal moderate damage and inflict &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage, and he has numerous combos that can add up to quickly kill unwary players.\nLorian's most powerful attack has him teleport away from the player, and then begin charging his sword with holy energy; after a few seconds, he will slam his sword into the ground and unleash a ray of light at the player, dealing extreme amounts of damage. As this attack is capable of killing players in a single hit, it is imperative to roll to avoid it at all costs.\nOnce Lorian has been felled, another cutscene will take place with Lothric coming down from his bedstead to aid his brother, reviving him and then climbing onto his back. The battle will then recommence, with the player facing the Twin Princes.\nDuring the second phase, Lorian will possess the same abilities that he did before, however now he will be aided by Lothric, who adds his own attacks on top of Lorian's. These include a holy version of &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Soulmass%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Homing Soulmass&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Soul Spear&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach brother has his own individual health bar, which can be damaged by attacking either target. As the Lord of Cinder is Lothric, the objective of the second phase is to focus all damage on him. If Lorian is killed again, Lothric will channel a spell to revive him; after a few seconds, he will unleash an &lt;a href=\"area-of-effect\"&gt;area-of-effect&lt;/a&gt; explosion that will damage and knock back the player, and Lorian will be revived with most of his health, resuming the battle.\nOnce Lothric's health bar has been depleted, Lorian will automatically fall as well, ending the battle.\nStrategy.\nDuring the first phase, the player must defeat Lorian by dodging his attacks and attacking him during his recoveries. Good rolling is mandatory, as Lorian's attacks all deal extremely heavy damage and inflict &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage, meaning that even greatshields cannot completely mitigate damage. As Lorian's recovery windows are quite small, fast-swinging weapons such as &lt;a href=\"Straight%20Swords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;straight swords&lt;/a&gt; are highly recommended in order to leave the player less vulnerable when Lorian begins attacking again.\nLorian is extremely weak to &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage, so use of &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Pine%20Resin%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Gold Pine Resin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Blade\"&gt;Lightning Blade&lt;/a&gt; can allow players to quickly pass through the first phase. As well, dealing enough damage to Lorian in a short amount of time will stagger him, allowing the player to riposte him from the front.\nWhenever Lorian teleports, keep an eye on his tells to see which attack he was about to perform. When he emerges after a short delay, he will resume with that attack. Good timing means that no matter where Lorian attacks from, whether it is in front of or behind the player, a roll can be executed to avoid damage. As well, keep in mind that when entering the arena via fog door after the first encounter, Lorian will always start by teleporting near the player and attack. However, if the player remains in place as they enter, when he teleports, he will end up doing so near his initial location, giving the player the option to start the encounter in a less compromising way.\nThe best way to fight Lorian is to always stay near him, giving him no opportunity to teleport to close the distance and attack the player from blind angles. Beware that using &lt;a href=\"Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;greatswords&lt;/a&gt; and larger is not recommended, as their long animations will give Lorian ample time to counter. Try to get in one or two quick swings, and then prepare to roll to dodge Lorian's retaliations.\nDuring the second phase, the player must defeat Lothric by getting behind Lorian during his attacks and striking Lothric directly. Depending on the weapon being used, Lothric may take less damage than Lorian from attacks that hit them both; Lothric is weak to slash and thrust damage, so weapons like &lt;a href=\"Katanas%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;katanas&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Thrusting%20Swords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;thrusting swords&lt;/a&gt; may work well. However, Lothric also has almost twice as much health as Lorian, so it is very difficult to avoid a situation where Lothric can be defeated without felling Lorian at least once.\nAs with the first phase, it is best to try to stay relatively close to the Twin Princes, as this gives Lothric less opportunity to cast his ranged spells. Bait Lorian's attacks, then roll in behind him and strike at Lothric whenever possible.\nWhen Lorian falls, try to deal as much damage to Lothric as possible, but be ready to immediately retreat in order to avoid the area-of-effect knockback that occurs when he revives Lorian. There is a short period of time when Lothric is getting back on Lorian's back where he is vulnerable to attacks, so be ready to rush in once the resurrection spell is complete. Each time he is revived, Lorian will have less health, however the quickest path to victory is to try to defeat Lothric before he can revive Lorian more than once."}

They're wearing the Penal Mask part of the Penal Set, and the wildly overgrown tattered hair and beard obscures any features that may be left of the face, that has been horrifically mutilated by the Penal Mask.\nLore.\nThe Lost Sinner is a forgotten entity, presumably undead, who imprisoned herself for unknown sins committed long ago. Donning the &lt;a href=\"Penal%20Set\"&gt;Penal Set&lt;/a&gt;, she lives in constant agony and shame.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Shalquoir\"&gt;Sweet Shalquoir&lt;/a&gt;, she tried to \"light\" the First Flame, but it's unknown whether this failure is the reason for her self-punishment, or if the attempt was a means of redemption.\nIt is heavily implied that the Lost Sinner holds some relation to the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Witch of Izalith&lt;/a&gt;, not only possessing a &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Bug\"&gt;Chaos Bug&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Izalith\"&gt;Lost Izalith&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\" but also dropping an &lt;a href=\"Old%20Witch%20Soul\"&gt;Old Witch Soul&lt;/a&gt; in NG+ (which can also be traded for a &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Blade%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Chaos Blade&lt;/a&gt;), as well as having &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Pyromancers&lt;/a&gt; assist her in battle. Additionally, equipping the &lt;a href=\"Penal%20Handcuffs\"&gt;Penal Handcuffs&lt;/a&gt; enhances &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;pyromancy&lt;/a&gt;.\nSummoning.\n&lt;a href=\"Lucatiel%20of%20Mirrah\"&gt;Lucatiel of Mirrah&lt;/a&gt; can be summoned for this battle. Her summon sign can be found after getting off the elevator, just before the flooded area.\n&lt;a href=\"Sellsword%20Luet\"&gt;Sellsword Luet&lt;/a&gt; (\"\" only) can also be summoned for this battle. His summon sign can be found inside one of the open jail cells. He is very useful for this fight, as he uses the &lt;a href=\"Redeye%20Ring\"&gt;Redeye Ring&lt;/a&gt;, which causes the boss to almost always attack him. If you need to keep Lucatiel alive during the fight, be sure to summon Luet as well.\nStrategy.\nThe Lost Sinner is a challenging boss and her difficulty is only made worse by the darkness of the boss room. This obscures her movements and prevents the player from locking on to her unless she is at close range. However, defeating the &lt;a href=\"Belfry%20Gargoyles\"&gt;Belfry Gargoyles&lt;/a&gt; and getting the &lt;a href=\"Bastille%20Key\"&gt;Bastille Key&lt;/a&gt; (in \"SotFS\", the key can be found after the &lt;a href=\"Ruin%20Sentinels\"&gt;Ruin Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; instead of the Gargoyles) allows you to unlock the two doors up the stairs on each side of the &lt;a href=\"Fog%20Door%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;fog door&lt;/a&gt; and light the oil inside with a torch which illuminates the boss' room.\nEven with the room lit, being patient and careful is essential. A shield with good &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt; will lessen her chance to easily &lt;a href=\"stunlock\"&gt;stunlock&lt;/a&gt; and likely kill the player, as her attacks do high &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; damage when blocked. Players should only attack when enough stamina remains to &lt;a href=\"roll\"&gt;roll&lt;/a&gt;/block afterwards. \nStaying close and circling her then attacking while she recovers from her attacks is a good tactic. If she jumps away, you can close in on her or let her come to you. She will usually move in with a dashing attack or her jumping attack.\nBe careful when healing or using items as she is highly aggressive and will not stop attacking for very long. The Lost Sinner can be &lt;a href=\"Parry%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;parried&lt;/a&gt;, but she will quickly jump away before any sort of follow-up can be performed. Using magic against her won't be easy, but possible if you are confident in your dodging skills.\nOn NG+ and beyond, two black phantom pyromancers drop from cages on either side of the room when The Lost Sinner falls to around 50-60% health (\"SoFS\" only?). These pyromancers use a variety of attacks to kill the player such as &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Swathe\"&gt;Flame Swathe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Sun\"&gt;Forbidden Sun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Storm%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Chaos Storm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Great%20Chaos%20Fireball%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Great Chaos Fireball&lt;/a&gt;. They will continually run around the room and cast pyromancies at the player, and are hard to hit as they frequently dodge both magic and melee. One strategy is to summon &lt;a href=\"Lucatiel%20of%20Mirrah\"&gt;Lucatiel of Mirrah&lt;/a&gt; and attempt to damage The Lost Sinner enough that the pyromancers appear so that you can quickly take them down before Lucatiel is defeated, as the boss may focus on Lucatiel if she is alive. If a player has high damage dealing potential, it is possible to defeat The Lost Sinner while both pyromancers are active. However, dodging all three enemies will be challenging. \nIf The Lost Sinner is defeated before the pyromancers have been dispatched, it is possible that the pyromancers will turn neutral and stop attacking the player. \nOne of the best strategies to defeat this boss is to use the &lt;a href=\"Redeye%20Ring\"&gt;Redeye Ring&lt;/a&gt; that you can purchase in &lt;a href=\"Majula\"&gt;Majula&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Shalquoir\"&gt;Sweet Shalquoir&lt;/a&gt;. Use a shield with 95 - 100% &lt;a href=\"physical%20damage\"&gt;physical damage&lt;/a&gt; reduction and good stability, such as the &lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Shield\"&gt;Drangleic Shield&lt;/a&gt;. Hold it in two hands, then summon Lucatiel of Mirrah or another player as a phantom and then block the entirety of the fight. Draw the Lost Sinner around in a circle, blocking her attacks and sidestepping her overhead swings/jump attacks. Lucatiel will chase the boss and attack it in the back, and avoid being damaged almost entirely. This is also the recommended strategy if you wish for Lucatiel to survive this fight in order to progress in her sidequest. The same method can be used to defeat a number of bosses, including the &lt;a href=\"Ruin%20Sentinels\"&gt;Ruin Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;. This strategy isn't as good in NG+ and up, but can still be effective with some heavy hitting phantoms to help deal with the pyromancers quickly, or if you have a &lt;a href=\"Gyrm%20Greatshield\"&gt;Gyrm Greatshield&lt;/a&gt; or a similar shield with high fire resistance.\nA very good strategy for solo melee builds is to get slightly far away (about 15-20 ft.) to induce her lunge attack, which the player can then dodge under and attack from the back. The easiness of the dodge means that the player can two-hand a powerful weapon, allowing for a quicker kill.\nAttacks.\nHorizontal Slash Combo: Many versions of her horizontal slash combo. Her most common attack, often done twice in a row. It can be blocked. One where she performs a horizontal slash, then followed up by an overhead attack, large stamina drain. Another combo she does is when she slashes twice in a row then followed by a thrust strike. \nQuick Thrust: A powerful stabbing attack that is easily dodged by rolling under. Staying close and circling around her can give a good chance for the player to counterattack.\nUppercut Strike: An upward slice, sometimes followed by a downward slice. Dodging is the best option.\nJumping Attack: Jumps out of view and attempts to hit the player with a falling attack, plunging her blade into the ground, sometimes if the player is near her though the attack missed, will follow up with a horizontal swipe. If she overshoots the player, she may turn around and perform a stabbing attack.\nShe either has two variations of this, only one of which removes lock on, or she may randomly combo her Jumping Attack with other combos.\nParry: She will go into a stance where she holds her weapons hilt against her face, if attacked during this stance she will block with her greatsword and perform a parry and riposte them. This can cause massive damage and will likely kill the player. \nQuick Swipe: Swipes her blade quickly, sometimes she follows it up with a back step.\nCharge: There are two variations of this. The first is if the player has created distance between her, she will perform a charging thrust attack. The second is that she will charge, then swipe diagonal from her right (the player's left). This is one of, if not the easiest to dodge.\nBackstab: If the player turns their back to Lost Sinner, she'll backstab them dealing not as much damage as Parry but will deal a large amount of damage; footnote: Horizontal Slash Combo deals more damage if all hits land.\nDefenses.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 The Lost Sinner by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZwS3zXGFzw&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

However, the most interesting aspect of the weapon is that it negatively &lt;a href=\"Scaling%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;scales&lt;/a&gt; with the player's Sin value. The menu implies the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Rating\"&gt;Scaling&lt;/a&gt; goes down a 30th of the total AR for each point of &lt;a href=\"Sin\"&gt;Sin&lt;/a&gt; acquired, however, the way it actually works is simply by reducing the Scaling by 30th all the way to zero.\nSpecial Scaling explanations can also be found in the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Rating\"&gt;Attack Rating&lt;/a&gt; page.\nWhat sets this ultra greatsword apart from all the others, however, is that it has the potential to have the \"highest damage-to-weight ratio\" of almost any other weapon in its class. With maximum strength and dexterity, and zero sin, while using the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Blades\"&gt;Ring of Blades&lt;/a&gt; +2 and the miracle &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Oath\"&gt;Sacred Oath&lt;/a&gt;, this weapon is made into a truly-formidable threat due to the total attack rating for its weight; this rivals the raw power of the &lt;a href=\"Greatsword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Fume%20Ultra%20Greatsword\"&gt;Fume Ultra Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;, while weighing no where near as much.\nSurprisingly, the Lost Sinner's Sword has the highest damage Resistance for &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage type, and when &lt;a href=\"Infusion\"&gt;infused&lt;/a&gt; with Fire, it will block 90% of all incoming fire damage, making it an exceedingly good weapon against players with &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Pyromancy&lt;/a&gt; builds in PVP."}

However, upon the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20One\"&gt;Ashen One&lt;/a&gt;'s arrival, the kingdom is in ruin: almost all of the inhabitants have been reduced to &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;Hollow&lt;/a&gt;s and the courtyards and castle pathways are littered with the remains of deceased knights and soldiers, indicating a great battle had taken place recently. The kingdom is also suffering from an infestation of &lt;a href=\"Pus%20of%20Man\"&gt;Pus of Man&lt;/a&gt; and has been cut off from the other lands. \nLore.\nDragonslaying Foundation.\nThe origins of the kingdom of Lothric can be found in several legacies of the region of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that the ancient inhabitants of the land upon which the new kingdom would arise were survivors of &lt;a href=\"Forossa\"&gt;Forossa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vendrick\"&gt;Vendrick&lt;/a&gt;'s Kingdom together with followers of the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20Blue\"&gt;Way of Blue&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Heirs%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;Heirs of the Sun&lt;/a&gt;, as they brought with them artifacts such as the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Tree%20Crest%20Shield\"&gt;Spirit Tree Crest Shield&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Wing%20Crest%20Shield\"&gt;Golden Wing Crest Shield&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Straight%20Sword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Sunlight Straight Sword&lt;/a&gt; and even the same &lt;a href=\"Priest%27s%20Chime%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Priest's Chimes&lt;/a&gt; to their new home.\nHowever, the new inhabitants of the region soon found themselves facing large numbers of &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Wyvern\"&gt;wyverns&lt;/a&gt; and had to become and had to become more than normal knights. Thus their &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Armour\"&gt;first armors&lt;/a&gt; were crafted to fight the dangerous creatures rather than other humans. They were heavy masses of iron capable of withstanding dragon fire and similar in design to the &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Set\"&gt;ancient armor&lt;/a&gt; of the dragonslayers of Anor Londo while their shields were capable of absorbing the high lightning emission of wyverns. The old knights of Lothric turned to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Nameless%20King\"&gt;Firstborn of Lord Gwyn&lt;/a&gt;, once venerated as a god of war and the sun, and built an &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20of%20Sunlight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;altar&lt;/a&gt; for him inside their city, beginning to worship the ancient deity who in return gave them the tools to face the wyverns. From the sun god they would how to infuse their &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Greataxe\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; with the power of lightning, lethal against dragons, and the ancient techniques for hunting archdragons developed in the war between the gods and the Everlasting Dragons. \nArmed and protected to counter the fearsome creatures, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Armour\"&gt;old knights of Lothric&lt;/a&gt; devoted themselves to the &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20of%20Sunlight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;covenant of the sun god&lt;/a&gt; and finally learned to use his &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lightning%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt; which allowed them to manipulate the power of lightning. The people of Lothric thus successfully hunted the wyverns that resided in their region, but by observing how their god commanded such creatures, they even learned how to tame and ride them, thus gaining a terrifying arsenal and advantage over their human enemies. By the time the wyvern problem had been resolved, the nascent people of Lothric had already gone through a social and political transformation and now, alongside the royal family, the &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Knight\"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Priest\"&gt;clergy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives%20Scholar\"&gt;scholars&lt;/a&gt; had consolidated themselves in their respective domains: the three pillars of the government of the new kingdom.\nThree Pillars (\u4e09\u67f1).\nThe kingdom of Lothric is organized around three distinct political entities that administer with a certain degree of autonomy the army, religion and archives of the realm: the Three Pillars that supports the royal rule.\nThe Knight (\u9a0e\u58eb).\nThe Knight's Pillar represents the &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Knight\"&gt;army of the kingdom of Lothric&lt;/a&gt; and the armed wing of the royal family since its foundation, making their task the defense of the kingdom's borders and the security within the city walls. The knights have long abandoned their &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Dragonslayer%20Set\"&gt;old and heavy armor&lt;/a&gt;, built specifically for hunting wild wyverns, to wear &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Knight%20Set\"&gt;lighter armor&lt;/a&gt; more suitable for conventional warfare. Despite this, the knights of Lothric continue to maintain the traditions linked to wyvern hunts: their &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Knight%20Shield\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; have in fact suitably high lightning absorption and their &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Knight%20Greatsword\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; are imbued with the strength of lightning while they still keep &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Urn%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;hunting tools&lt;/a&gt; in their arsenal for this task.\nThanks to their support of the royal family the knights were granted permission to befriend the &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Wyvern\"&gt;wyverns&lt;/a&gt; and even keep them in their barracks inside the city, as the creatures would became part of their army and rode into battle. Due to the presence of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; in their region, the Convergence led other lands to converge on Lothric and, thanks to the power of the terrifying creatures, the knights crushed every people and country that came into contact with the borders of their kingdom, leading the knights and their dragons to become the symbols of Lothric. Following the alliance between Lothric and Irihtyll, knights would begin using &lt;a href=\"Knight%27s%20Crossbow\"&gt;crossbows&lt;/a&gt; that employ &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;lightning bolts&lt;/a&gt; produced by the giant blacksmiths of the city of the gods.\nAfter the founding of the kingdom, when the scholars gained control of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt; and emerged as the third pillar, the Knight and Priestess would strengthen their ties to balance the new strength. The army would provide the high ranks of the clergy with a guard armed with &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Knight%20Greatshield\"&gt;greatshield&lt;/a&gt; with high magic absorpition thanks to the blessing from the priestesses while the clergy would create &lt;a href=\"Braille%20Divine%20Tome%20of%20Lothric\"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt; for the army's use such as &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20Weapon\"&gt;blessings for their weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Barrier%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;magical barriers&lt;/a&gt; effective against magic. It was even said that no knight inside Lothric Castle could fall, because they were blessed by divine protection, telling how much strong the ties between the two pillars were especially inside the city. The knights would have taken their vows in the Lothric Cathedral, in a ceremony in which they would have shed their blood in a ritual basin in front of a beheading knight. In fact, throughout the kingdom there are various statues of knights in the act of cutting off their heads in a ritual way, symbolizing how the order took their duty towards the kingdom very seriously and the culture of sacrifice dictated by the cult of the linking of the First Flame was deeply rooted in them.\nThe cult of the &lt;a href=\"Nameless%20King\"&gt;Nameless King&lt;/a&gt;, god of the sun, is still widespread among the knights of Lothric, and one of his altars can be found right near the military barracks. The knights are part of the &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20of%20Sunlight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Warriors of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; covenant and as such have access to the &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt; that use lightning in battle.\nHowever, the veneration of the god allied with dragons and the importance they held in the culture of the army led the knights to aspire to become the creatures they rode. The knights of Lothric made pilgrimages to &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt; and then meditated to reach the residence of the Nameless King on the &lt;a href=\"Archdragon%20Peak\"&gt;Archdragon Peak&lt;/a&gt;. Knights would obtain special &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Stoneplate%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stoneplate rings&lt;/a&gt; granted to those seeking to become dragons and stones infused with the power of the everlasting dragons, to achieve a transformation of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Torso%20Stone%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;torso&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Head%20Stone%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; into that of a draconic creature, the first steps in secret rituals that sought a complete transformation while meditating toward the remains of an ancient &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite the long and hard process, the attempts to imitate the shape of an ancient dragon and their desire to reach a perfect imitation achieved success and some of these knights managed to transform themselves into wyverns, returning to Lothric or remaining to guard their sacred place .\nThe Priestess (\u796d\u5100\u9577).\nThe Priestess's Pillar represents the &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Priest\"&gt;clergy of the kingdom of Lothric&lt;/a&gt; and the religious wing of the royal family since its foundation, making their task the management of the faith of the kingdom, the ecclesiastical structures in the city and the support of the knights and citizens with &lt;a href=\"Braille%20Divine%20Tome%20of%20Lothric\"&gt;healing and protective miracles&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to their support of the royal family the High Priestess was granted permission to serve as the wet nurse of the prince and consequently care for them during childhood. In addition, Lothric Cathedral is the first building erected directly after the city's main gate and represents the bridge between the outside and the &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;Lothric Castle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Consumed%20King%27s%20Garden\"&gt;Royal Garden&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe religion of Lothric has its roots in the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20Blue\"&gt;Way of Blue&lt;/a&gt; originating from &lt;a href=\"Heide%27s%20Tower%20of%20Flame\"&gt;Heide&lt;/a&gt; in the region of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; and consequently venerates the ancient &lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;gods&lt;/a&gt; of Anor Londo and in particular &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Dark Sun Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt;, king of the gods and god of the darkmoon. In addition, the &lt;a href=\"Emma%2C%20High%20Priestess%20of%20Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;High Priestess&lt;/a&gt; holds the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20Blue%20%28item%29\"&gt;parchment of the moon&lt;/a&gt;, symbol of the ancient accord of the Way of Blue and the protection of its members.\nDue to the presence of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; in the region, the kingdom of Lothric became inevitably linked to it from its founding and its religion and culture accordingly. The tradition of the linking of the Fire plays a central role in Lothric and there are several testimonies of this: the &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt; is located just outside the city walls and easily connected to the &lt;a href=\"Consumed%20King%27s%20Garden\"&gt;Royal Gardens&lt;/a&gt;. An indefinite number of people throughout the long history of the kingdom came here to take part in the ritual initiated by Lord Gwin's sacrifice and even those who failed, becoming an &lt;a href=\"Unkindled\"&gt;Unkindled&lt;/a&gt; burned by the Flame and turned to ash, were still buried near the shrine in the &lt;a href=\"Cemetery%20of%20Ash\"&gt;Cemetery of Ash&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, the ritual of the Linking of the Fire evolved more and more, going from a simple temple inside the Royal Gardens to a real arena complete with stands, in which &lt;a href=\"Iudex%20Gundyr\"&gt;Iudex Gundyr&lt;/a&gt;'s golem judged those who aspired to become Lords , testing their strength. However the ritual of the linking of the Fire was not just a religious fa\u00e7ade for the masses but permeated the kingdom at every level up to the royal family who were obsessed with producing a &lt;a href=\"Lothric%2C%20Younger%20Prince\"&gt;worthy Champion&lt;/a&gt; in their line to continue to justify their divine mandate as kingship and their duty to safeguard the Age of Fire.\nAfter the founding of the kingdom, when the scholars gained control of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt; and emerged as the third pillar, the Knight and Priestess would strengthen their ties to balance the new strength. The clergy would create &lt;a href=\"Braille%20Divine%20Tome%20of%20Lothric\"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt; for the army's use such as &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20Weapon\"&gt;blessings for their weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Barrier%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;magical barriers&lt;/a&gt; effective against magic while the army would provide the high ranks of the clergy with a guard armed with &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Knight%20Greatshield\"&gt;greatshield&lt;/a&gt; with high magic absorpition thanks to the blessing from the priestesses. It was even said that no knight inside Lothric Castle could fall, because they were blessed by divine protection, telling how much strong the ties between the two pillars were especially inside the city\nIn particular, the priests of Lothric specialize in supporting the army's knights, creating &lt;a href=\"Braille%20Divine%20Tome%20of%20Lothric\"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt; designed to &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20Weapon\"&gt;bless their weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bountiful%20Light\"&gt;heal them&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Barrier%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;protect them from magic&lt;/a&gt;. These miracles are written in braille tomes, typical of &lt;a href=\"Carim\"&gt;Carim&lt;/a&gt;'s new &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20White\"&gt;Way of White&lt;/a&gt; culture, implying cultural and faith influence between the two nations.\nThe cult of the &lt;a href=\"Nameless%20King\"&gt;Nameless King&lt;/a&gt;, god of the sun, is still widespread among the army of Lothric, as one of his altars can be found right near the military barracks, and the knights of the kingdom are part of the &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20of%20Sunlight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Warriors of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; covenant. When &lt;a href=\"Gwynevere%2C%20Princess%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Gwynevere&lt;/a&gt; reached Lothric and became the queen of the kingdom, marrying into the bloodline of its monarchs, she resumed her role as a divinity and was worshiped by the population of Lothric as a symbol of \"bounty and fertility\". Her \"heavenly daughter\" &lt;a href=\"Gertrude\"&gt;Gertrude&lt;/a&gt; also became her holy maiden and her healing &lt;a href=\"Bountiful%20Light\"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt; were taught to her personal knights.\nThe current High Priestess is &lt;a href=\"Emma\"&gt;Emma&lt;/a&gt;, who, as tradition dictated, was also &lt;a href=\"Lothric%2C%20Younger%20Prince\"&gt;Prince Lothric&lt;/a&gt;'s wet nurse. She deeply wished for him to fullfill his destiny and become the designated &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord of Cinder&lt;/a&gt; and blessed the &lt;a href=\"Lothric%27s%20Holy%20Sword\"&gt;holy sword&lt;/a&gt; that he was expected to wield with strong magic. \nThe Scholar (\u8ce2\u8005).\nThe Scholar's Pillar represents the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives%20Scholar\"&gt;scholars of the kingdom of Lothric&lt;/a&gt; and the academic wing of the royal family since its foundation, making their task the management of the knowledge of the kingdom, the academic structures in the city and the support of the realm with &lt;a href=\"Sage%27s%20Scroll\"&gt;researches and sorceries&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe history of the scholars began when Lothric was still young and &lt;a href=\"Aldia%2C%20Scholar%20of%20the%20First%20Sin\"&gt;Aldia, Scholar of the First Sin&lt;/a&gt; reached the developing kingdom, becoming the \"first of the scholars\" and teaching his &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Stream\"&gt;sorceries&lt;/a&gt; to them. Thanks to their support of the royal family the scholars were granted permission to manage the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt; which contains all the knowledge of the kingdom and carry out their scientific research. Over time, scholars accumulated an immense amount of knowledge and the grand Archives became an enormous structure containing an equal amount of books.\nHowever, the knowledge contained in the tomes not only represented a danger to their sanity, implying that they had come into contact with particularly &lt;a href=\"Big%20Hat%20Logan\"&gt;profound research into the nature of the soul&lt;/a&gt; that led their anchor to reason to be washed away, but the books were literally &lt;a href=\"Clawed%20Curse\"&gt;cursed&lt;/a&gt;, releasing ghostly and pale limbs towards those who reached them.\nConsequently, although the scholars were sorcers, they were also pious men, who tended to their candles with reverence, signifying how the Flame guided their research and protected them from the cursed knowledge with which they came into contact and they feared deeply. \nTheir &lt;a href=\"Scholar%27s%20Candlestick\"&gt;candlesticks&lt;/a&gt; not only allowed them to reinforce their sorceries but also acted as weapons, representing both a \"guiding light\" in their research but a tool of self-admonishing and restraint, implying how scholars were brutally regulated by group pressure and discipline if they showed signs of giving in to the cursed knowledge of the Grand Archives. The scholars went so far as to cover their heads in &lt;a href=\"Scholar%27s%20Shed%20Skin\"&gt;ivory wax&lt;/a&gt;, forming a mask that covered them and transformed them into walking candles, to protect themselves from the madness that permeated their texts and to prevent their anchor of reason from being too easily washed away.\nAt some point the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Sage\"&gt;Crystal Sage&lt;/a&gt;s reached Lothric and became the spiritual guides of the scholars of the Grand Archives. The two scholars were in fact inspired by the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Hat%20Logan\"&gt;grand sage Logan&lt;/a&gt;, wearing &lt;a href=\"Sage%27s%20Big%20Hat\"&gt;hats similar to that of the legendary sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; as a symbol of their pedigree, and possessed a &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Scroll\"&gt;scroll&lt;/a&gt; containing the sorceries and research of &lt;a href=\"Seath\"&gt;Seath&lt;/a&gt;, a branch of sorcery that the two sages had carried on allowing them to replicate Logan's sorceries that utilize the power of crystals to their fullest as a medium for souls. The Crystal Sages introduced to Lothric not only &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Gem\"&gt;crystal gems&lt;/a&gt; but also the heretical belief in the pale dragon Seath and his mad knowledge.\nThe sages would thus continue to work on their research within the Grand Archives, even taking &lt;a href=\"Daughter%20of%20Crystal%20Kriemhild\"&gt;pupils&lt;/a&gt; and crafting &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Sage%27s%20Rapier\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and [[[[Sage's Crystal Staff|castig tools]] that used the power of crystals to enhance their magical power, representing how the fruits of the lifetime of research had advanced to an impressive level.\nMore recently, Aldia, who had survived throughout the kingdom's entire history, became [[Lothric, Younger Prince|Prince Lothric]]'s mentor in secret., teaching him [[Soul Spear (Dark Souls III)|powerful]] and [[Homing Soulmass (Dark Souls III)|refined]] spells and privately sharing his doubts about the linking of the First Flame.\nThe Hunter.\n[[File:Hunter's Ring.png|thumb|130px|The symbol of the Hunter.]]\nThe Hunters do not represent an \"official\" Pillar as they are an order of assassins who act in the shadows to serve the interests of the royal family. Their task was of vital importance to the royal government as they were employed to secretly punish the Three Pillars when they acted outside the king's interests, thus secretly eliminating internal dissidents.Precisely for this task they wore [[Black Hand Set|leather armors with a black cape cover]] like [[Assassin Set|assassins' ones]] that shrouded them in darkness. Among the hunters were also chosen the \"Black Hands\", a title established to honor hunters who served successive generations of kings and therefore demonstrated the ability to wield two blades, exceptional dexterity, extreme skill in carrying out their task and loyalty to the royal family, . However, this title was so rare that only three hunters achieved it in the entire history of the kingdom.\nThere are currently two known Black Hands: [[Black Hand Gotthard|Gotthard]], a hunter who rose through the ranks of the knights and was thus nominated for his swordmaship, and [[Black Hand Kamui|Kamui]], a foreigner from the Undead Settlement who became part of the prince's private guard.\nFirelinking Duty.\n[[File:Lothric_Serpent_Winged_Statue.jpg|thumb|130px|A statue of the Primordial Serpent inside Lothric.]]\nAt some point during the founding of the kingdom the [[First Flame]] would drift up to position itself on the region of Lothric along with its [[Kiln of the First Flame (Dark Souls III)|Kiln]], forever marking the history and culture of the people. As a consequence of the presence of the Flame, in fact, all the lands of the world would have begun to converge towards the city of Lothric, thanks to the space-time effects of Stagnation. Because of this event some [[Primordial Serpents]] would have many interests in continuing to propagate the cult of the linking of the Flame to continue the Age of Fire and the tradition started with the sacrifice of Lord Gwyn. In fact at some point [[Kingseeker Frampt|Frampt]] or other serpents affiliated with his ideology reached the city. Over time the serpents passed on the culture of linking the Flame to the royal family of Lothric, pushing them to preserve the tradition and actively produce heirs capable of becoming Lords of Cinder. Frampt or other serpents affiliated with his ideology, were represented in numerous statues, on par with the Three Pillars of Lothric, with elegant clothes and angel wings, showing how they had a central role within the kingdom and were considered \"divine messengers\" .\nAt a certain point the kingdom of Lothric came into contact with that of [[Irithyll of the Boreal Valley]], led by the king of the gods [[Gwyndolin]], finding common ground and a favorable diplomatic bridge thanks to the fact that Lothric not only found itself managing the system of the linking of the Flame but its religion was deeply rooted in the [[Way of Blue (Dark Souls III)|Way of Blue]] which venerated the moon god. The two kingdoms would thus open their doors to each other and collaborate: knights of Lothric would begin using [[Knight's Crossbow|crossbows]] that employed [[Lightning Bolt (Dark Souls III)|lightning bolts]] produced by the giant blacksmiths of the city of the gods while scholars and knights of Lothric would reach Irithyll. Irithyll would also allow the knights of Lothric to come and make pilgrimages with the goal of meditating and try to reach the residence of the [[Archdragon Peak]].\n[[File:Blade of the Darkmoon (item).png|thumb|130px|The symbol crest of the Blade of the Darkmoon depicting the moon of Gwyndolin and the sword of Lothric.]]\nThe two realms would enter into such stable relations as to determine an official alliance and leading the [[Blade of the Darkmoon (item)|symbol crest]] of the [[Blade of the Darkmoon (Dark Souls III)|Blade of the Darkmoon]] knights to represent the ancient original moon combined with the typical sword of the knights symbol of Lothric, furthering influencing the religion of the kingdom but also ensuring that messengers bearing the [[Small Lothric Banner|banner of Lothric]] could take advantage of the [[Batwing Demon| transport demons]] in the service of ancient Anor Londo. Now in possession of the knowledge provided by the primordial serpents and the ancient gods of Anor Londo, the kingdom of Lothric would develop its role in the linking of the Flame, building the [[Firelink Shrine (Dark Souls III)|Firelink Shrine]] just outside the city walls and easily connected to the [[Consumed King's Garden|Royal Gardens]], in order to guarantee a safe and regulated way to access the [[Kiln of the First Flame (Dark Souls III)|Kiln of the First Flame]]. In addition, the shrine would once again accept [[Fire Keeper (Dark Souls III)|Fire-kepeers]] capable of assisting Champions who aspired to link the Flame, supporting them on their journey and transferring the power of the souls they found to them.\n[[File:Eyes of a Fire Keeper.png|120px|thumb|The dark secrets of the first Fire Keeper of Lothric.]] \nHowever at certain point the [[First Flame]] began to fade again and the first [[Fire Keeper]] of [[Lothric]] had a vision of the end of the [[Age of Fire]] and the beginning of an [[Age of Dark]], a barren plane of endless darkness. For this reason, [[Ludleth of Courland|Ludleth]], a student of the art of transposition of [[Courland]], the process of extracting and coalescing the essence of a soul and in doing so transfer its true power to the user to grant powers once thought unattainable, was called to become a [[Lords of Cinder|Lord of Cinder]], to link the First Flame again and repel the dark vision of the Fire Keeper. Despite his apparent lack of strength and his small appearance, Ludleth managed to gain the strength necessary to become a Champion, something for which he himself expresses remorse, asking to be forgiven. Despite his role, Ludleth was then literally exiled from his country and collaborated with Lothric, ensuring that the first Fire Keeper was deprived of her [[Eyes of a Fire Keeper|eyes]] and that all future maidens like her were deprived of their sight to prevent them from observing the future without the Flame thanks to the power of their darkness. The original eyes were hidden in a [[Untended Graves|version]] of the [[Firelink Shrine (Dark Souls III)|Firelink Shrine]] on the verge of sinking into darkness and where the First Flame was an instant away from being extinguished.\n[[File:Cemeteryofash.jpg\u200e|thumb|130px|The arena where those aspiring to link the Fire were judged..]]\nIn addition the ritual of the linking of the Fire was not just a religious fa\u00e7ade for the masses but permeated the kingdom at every level up to the royal family. At one point [[Champion Gundyr|Gundyr]] himself, a champion with an armor modelled after a king, was charged with the duty of becoming a Champion and link the First Flame, demonstrating how the power that the rulers of the kingdom obtained from the Flame also led them to have to shoulder the responsibility of extending its life. Champion Gundyr thus received an iron halberd with the power to break poise and to never crumble and was sent to the Firelink Shrine to do his duty. However, someone had different plans for him and the king found himself restrained by a [[Prisoner's Chain|chain]] that blocked him in his path, leading him to fall into an [[Untended Graves|Abyss]] and get lost in the folds of time. Gundyr thus found himself in a moment of time when the Firelink Shrine had no fire and ended up arriving \"late\" for the celebrations that awaited his fate. The Fire Keeper who was supposed to welcome her champion never met him and the ensuing tragic farce became a favorite tale of the masses of Lothric, a stain on the reputation of future kings of the realm. The fate of the aspiring Lord, however, was not the result of chance, in fact the one who had charged him with his duty had also condemned him to eternal service from the beginning. Gundyr would in fact be defeated by an unknown warrior and then become sheath to a [[Coiled Sword|coiled sword]] and transformed into an indestructible golem, becoming the ritual test for those who would attempt to link the First Flame after him, testing their strength and worthiness \n[[File:Lothric_Knight_Sacrifice_Statue.jpg\u200e|thumb|120px|The staue of a beheading knight inside the Cathedral of Lothric.]]\nOver time, the ritual of the Linking of the Fire evolved more and more, going from a simple temple inside the Royal Gardens to a real arena complete with stands, in which [[Iudex Gundyr]]'s golem would judge those who aspired to become Lords , testing them. An indefinite number of people throughout the long history of the kingdom would come here to take part in the ritual started with Lord Gwin's sacrifice and all the Fire Keepers that served their purpose of guiding potential Champions would be disposed of and dropped inside the Bell Tower of Firelinking Shrine, piling in up in the dozens. Even more were those that tried and failed, becoming an [[Unkindled]] burned by the Flame and turned to ash, were still buried near the shrine in the [[Cemetery of Ash]], a mass of numerous graves of all those who have failed in their task.\nAt some point, [[Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight|Gwynevere]] would leave Irithyll and reach Lothric to become the queen of the kingdom, marrying into the bloodline of its monarchs , testifying to the now total alliance between the kingdom of Lothric and Irithyll. The goddess resumed her role as a divinity in the city, producing [[Divine Blessing (Dark Souls III)|holy water]] with healing properties and being worshiped by the citizens as a symbol of \"bounty and fertility\". Her \"heavenly daughter\" [[Gertrude]] also became her holy maiden and her healing [[Bountiful Light|miracles]] were taught to her personal knights. During the long tradition of supporting the linking of the Flame by the kingdom of Lothric, the goddess alone cared for the [[Cemetery of Ash]], the resting place for the [[Unkindled]], beings who had failed to link the flame and whose graves saw no visitors.\nRoyal Madness.\n[[File:Lothric_Statue_Plaza.png|thumb|130px|The tragic illusions of the royal family.]]\nAt a certain point [[Oceiros, the Consumed King|Oceiros]] became king and the representative of the entire culture of linking of the Fire of the kingdom, shouldering the burden of the duty of firelinking and the expectations of fixing the failure of [[Champion Gundyr]]; the symbol of his royal guard in fact represented a large golden bird turned towards the sky, towards a crown, symbol of the royal family's desire to fulfill their task of producing a worthy Champion to maintain the Age of Fire. The king married [[Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight|Gwynevere, Queen of Lothric]] and with her generated the divine princes of the kingdom who were entrusted with different destinies. [[Lorian, Elder Prince and Lothric, Younger Prince|Lorian]], as the eldest prince, was designated heir to the throne and for this reason he received the [[Lorian's Set|ancient brass armor]] handed down by the royal family together with a [[Lorian's Helm|crown helmet]] patterned with flame, symbol of the kingdom's tradition of firelinking. Lorian was raised as a knight and proved his incredible prowess on the battlefield, leading a war against the remnants of the [[Demon (lore)|Chaos Demons]] and even capturing some of them to serve as [[Stray Demon (Dark Souls III)|slaves]] for Lothric. The prince even faced the [[Demon Prince]] in a duel and was able to single-handedly defeat him, resulting in his [[Lorian's Greatsword|greatsword]] being eternally scorched with the flame of chaos and his armor to be stained black.\n[[File:Lothric_Castle_Fronton.jpg|thumb|130px|The fronton celebrating the coming Prince of Cinders.]]\n[[Lothric, Younger Prince|Lothric]] instead, as the youngest prince, was designated to become a [[Lords of Cinder|Lord of Cinder]], sacrificing himself in the linking of the [[First Flame]] to keep the Age of Fire alive. The prince was in fact the hope not only of the entire kingdom but the result of the obsession of the royal family and the king to produce a worthy Champion from among their ranks as a symbol of their divine mandate and duty. For the young man who was supposed to enter the [[Kiln of the First Flame (Dark Souls III)|Kiln of the Flame]] arena, a [[Lothric's Holy Sword|platinum sword]] was created and blessed with strong magic by [[Emma, High Priestess of Lothric Castle|the High Priestess]] even before he was ready to fullfill his destiny. Oceiros in fact created immense propaganda around Lothric, not only giving him the name of the kingdom, but building statues that depicted him ready for sacrifice and with his sacred sword even before he linked the Flame, already preparing his throne at the [[Firelink Shrine (Dark Souls III)|Firelink Shrine]] who called him the hope of the kingdom. Despite all the hopes that were placed in him, Lothric soon revealed himself to be a sick and shriveled child, so weak that he never grew out of his [[Prayer Set|baby clothes]], which remained his only clothing throughout his life and were blessed to at least try to keep him healthy. Lothric continued to live and at some point [[Aldia, Scholar of the First Sin|Aldia]], the first of the Grand Archives scholars and doubtful of the linking of the Flame, became his private mentorThe frail prince still demonstrated talent for sorcery, for which he did not need a medium being the son of a deity, and learned several [[Soul Spear (Dark Souls III)|powerful]] and [[Homing Soulmass (Dark Souls III)|refined]] spells.\nWhen the royal family realized that Lothric would not improve from his condition , they resorted to repulsive acts in an attempt to obtain a worthy Champion for the linking: the rulers would in fact bind the souls of the two brother princes together with a [[Curse (Dark Souls III)|curse]], in the hope that the weaker Lothric would thus share the strength of Lorian, making them able to sacrifice themselves to the Flame together. Despite the monstrous practice, Lorian himself had the desire to submit to the curse, to try to help his younger brother, even at the cost of depriving the kingdom of the heir he represented. However, fate played a bad joke once again: the souls of the two brothers, linked so closely that they could nearly meld together, made them inseparable and Lorian could not die if Lothric did not too. However, their union also led the older brother to share the younger's condition, making Lorian crippled and mute to the point of being unable to walk on his own legs and the two unable to link the Flame. The now twin princes thus found themselves unable to fulfill the destiny for which they had been brought into the world and would become inseparable in kinship, fueled by their grief for their fate.. \n[[File:Oceiros.png|thumb|130px|Oceiros consumed in his madness.]]\nIn his layer years, now consumed by continuous failures in the search for a solution to the problem of finding a worthy Champion, Oceiros became fascinated by dragons and began to slide into madness, eventually turning to the cursed knowledge of the [[Grand Archives]]. Here Oceiros found heretical faith in the [[Seath the Scaleless|white dragon Seath]] and became so absorbed in it that he wore a [[Dragonscale Ring|ring with a dragon scale]] and had his army use [[Wooden Shield (Dark Souls III)|shields]] decorated with a \"white dragon\" while giving his royal guard [[Magic Stoneplate Ring|magic rings]] that enhanced sorcery. Now lost in his madness, the Oceiros became known as the \"consumed king\" and many assassins were sent to try to kill him and remove him from power, but thanks to his magic ring he managed to save himself, attributing his salvation to the divine protection of the dragon scale.\nContinuing to study the [[Crystal Scroll|sorceries and knowledge]] contained in the Archives and brought by the [[Crystal Sage]]s to Lothric, Oceiros found himself walking the same path as [[Big Hat Logan]], reaching the same level of \"enlightenment\" as him and then going completely mad. The king, in his deep delusions, believed he had to become a dragon himself in order to produce an heir strong enough to link the Flame. Ecentually he even managed to transform himself into a scaleless dragon , albeit an imperfect and distorted one, even obtaining the [[White Dragon Breath (Dark Souls III)|sorcery of Seath's crystal breath]]. Once his desire for transcendence was satiated, Oceiros once again fathered a child with Gwynevere, believing that a descendant of dragons would make a worthy Champion. Once he obtained his child [[Ocelotte]], Oceiros retreated with his [[Cathedral Knight|royal guard]] to the [[Consumed King's Garden|royal gardens]] close to the [[Firelink Shrine (Dark Souls III)|Firelink Shrine]], completely ignoring the state of his kingdom to protect the \"child of dragons\" who represented the culmination of his desires and the only thing left in his life. Despite everything, the king was not even able to see Ocelotte, holding him tightly in his palm and relying only on his madness.\nAfter producing the potential champion, Gwynevere would quietly disappear from the kingdom of Lothric. Realizing that the Flame would soon go out and it would be necessary to bring back even the Unkindled to search for a new champion, the queen enshrined her [[Ashen Estus Ring|ring]] in the [[Untended Graves|Cemetery of Untended Graves]], so that one day an Unkindled might profit from its use.\nAngelic Heresy.\n[[File:Angel - 01.jpg|thumb|130px|An Angel shares a revelation to Gertrude.]]\n[[Gertrude]], the Holy Maiden of the Queen, one day was visited by an [[Angel]], a lucent humanoid creature created by the evolution of humanity of the pilgrims of [[Londor]] that were arriving to the kingdom of Lothric. The entity revealed to her a [[Divine Pillars of Light|truth]] capable of manifesting pillars of light together with tales of the end of the Age of Fire. The holy maiden was convinced by this enlightenment and began to spread the worship of those she considered \"divine messengers\". However this faith was viewed as heresy in Lothric, as it opposed the worship of the ancient gods and the duty to continue linking the First Flame and was consequently unrecognized by any of the Three Pillars that govern the realm.\n[[File:Winged Knight Painting Detail.jpg|thumb|130px|A civil war of faith ravages Lothric.]]\nDue to the danger that her new faith posed to the kingdom, despite her position of closeness to the Queen, Gertrude was imprisoned in the ceiling cell inside the [[Grand Archives]]. Here she was subjected to the experiments of the [[Grand Archives Scholar|scholars]], probably intrigued by the feathers she had manifested as a result of her faith. The scholars even experimented on her [[Crystal Chime|sacred chime]], using the power of crystals to make a catalyst that was suitable for casting both miracles and sorceries. Eventually the abuses of the scholars led the woman to lose both her voice and her sight but she remained determined to record what the Angel told her, even if in the form of fragmentary scrawls. Even though Gertrude was still in captivity her incomprehensible tales somehow reached the rest of Lothric and became the foundation of an \"angelic faith\" that venerated angels despite the Three Pillars' condemnation of heresy. Over time, the heretical faith also spread among the knights of Lothric who, despite maintaining the symbols and armor of the kingdom, swore themselves to the Angels. These soldiers even went so far as to create iconography and art of their new faith\nand their strong faith led them to develop angelic wings similar to those of the objects of their worship.\nStill seen as heretics, these [[Winged Knight]]s armed themselves with weapons more befitting of executioners and came into conflict with the Three Pillars and Lothric's loyalist army.\nIn the final days of the reign of Lothric and the First Flame, Gertrude died, still in her cage. However the [[Winged Knight]]s, after having executed dozens of [[Lothric Knight]]s, would continue to patrol various locations within Lothric and even the Castle while [[Gertrude's Knight|Gertrude's most loyal Knights]] were positioned to defend their saint's resting place above the Archives..\nLothric's Refusal.\nWhen the [[First Flame]] began to fade and the time came for [[Lothric, Younger Prince|Prince Lothric]] to fulfill his destiny and become a [[Lord of Cinder]], he simply refused. After reflecting on his [[Aldia, Scholar of the First Sin|mentor]]'s teachings, the state of the kingdom and the world, his cursed life and the atrocities committed to continue to link the Flame the prince decided to ignore his \"duty\", refusing to continue the legacy of the Lords, and instead chose to wait for the Flame's death from the distance. In fact, the prince retired to the top of his castle together with his brother Lorian with whom he shared his soul, protected by his royal guard and the exponents of the Three Pillars: [[Lion Knight Albert]], [[Black Hand Kamui]] and [[Daughter of Crystal Kriemhild]] . \nThe Outrider Knights.\nAfter [[Pontiff Sulyvahn]] rose to power in [[Irithyll of the Boreal Valley|Irithyll]], he began looking for strategies to expand his influence and power. As such, he established a force of [[Boreal Outrider Knight|Outrider Knights]], who would serve as his private militia. These knights were given [[Pontiff's Right Eye|rings]] by the Pontiff that allowed him to keep an eye on them. Unbeknownst to the knights, these rings would eventually drive them insane, and transform them into savage mindless [[Sulyvahn's Beast|beasts]]. Part of his strategy consisted of corrupting and destabilizing Lothric. By sending his Outrider Knights, who acted as fierce and relentless invaders, he created chaos and began to undermine the stability of Lothric, making it easier for him to exert control.\nTwo of the most notable Outrider Knights include [[Vordt of the Boreal Valley|Vordt]], and the [[Dancer of the Boreal Valley]]. Vordt is enountered at the end of the [[High Wall of Lothric]], in a large open area consisting of a gate which was formerly used as an entrance to a bridge that once connected to the [[Undead Settlement]]. Not much is known about Vordt's past, other than he was a distant descendant of the [[Gods|Old Gods]] of [[Anor Londo]], and resided in Irithyll of the Boreal Valley. After Sulyvahn imprisoned [[Dark Sun Gwyndolin|The Dark Sun Gwyndolin]], Vordt was ordered to serve as an Outrider Knight. Like the others, he was given a ring known as [[Pontiff's Left Eye|Pontiff's left eye]], which would eventually devolve him into a frenzied beast, causing his armor to fuse with his own hide.\nVordt was sent to [[Lothric]] as a companion to the Dancer of the Boreal Valley. The Dancer is a direct descendant of [[Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight|Gwynevere,]] and was among the [[Irithyllian Slave|Irithyllians]] ([[Humans|Human]] and God hybrid) to inhabit Irithyll of the Boreal Valley. Once the Pontiff took control of the city, he first ordered the daughter of Gwynevere to serve as his personal \"dancer\". Later, he bestowed her [[Dancer's Enchanted Swords|two enchanted swords]], mirroring the design of [[Greatsword of Judgment|his own]] [[Profaned Greatsword|blades]], along with the same ring given to other Outrider Knights. He then sent her to Lothric, which was his equivalent of exile. She positioned herself in the cathedral to guard [[Emma, High Priestess of Lothric Castle|High Priestess Emma]] and the entrance to [[Lothric Castle]]\n[[File:High_Wall_of_Lothric_-_09.jpg|thumb|130px|The conflict leads to heavy losses among the knights.]]\nDespite the great losses of the regular army, the knights managed to regroup and maintain key positions in the city, rallying to protect the Cathedral and the [[Emma, High Priestess of Lothric Castle|High Priestess Emma]], \u200b\u200bsecuring the military barracks and the Castle Following the civil conflict that would have made the streets of the city unsafe, most of the [[Praying Hollow Soldier|population]] would have tried to find safety on the [[High Wall of Lothric|walls]], along with the rest of the [[Hollow Soldier (Dark Souls III)|army's infantry]] that deserted from the ranks \nHowever, they would soon meet their death here too, transforming en masse into [[Hollow]]s, reducing themselves to becoming murderers and thieves. \nThe lack of regular army forces to patrol the city's borders would have led thieves from the [[Undead Settlement]] to scale the walls as well. However, they would have stopped here in their raids as they were frightened by the rumors coming from the Castle, in which anyone who entered disappeared.\nThe effects of the fading of the Flame and their faith would also have transformed some of the desperate citizens into trees with a humanoid appearance, turned in prayer towards Lothric Castle.\n[[File:Pus_of_man_(2).jpg|thumb|130px|A manifestation of the Pus of Man.]]\nHowever, the increasingly desperate situation of the Flame would have led to further problems: a plague would have begun to spread among the undead of the city which would cause their Dark Soul to explode from their bodies, manifesting itself as an [[Pus of Man|amorphous black blob with bestial features]] which would attacked anything with destructive ferocity. The infestation of these Pus of Man would have led the students of the Grand Archives to close the doors of their facility for good, isolating themselves from the desperate situation of the kingdom to continue their work.\nDue to the Convergence brought by the dying Flame, one day the High Wall appeared, a massive seismic upheaval of the land beneath the castle, raising it high above the bridge that once lead to it and disconnecting it from all nearby regions. As there was no route to leave and enter, messengers had no way to return and pilgrims were unable to seek refuge, leading to the total isolation of the kingdom during its final days. The [[Stray Demon (Dark Souls III)|Stray Demon]] that was once the gatekeeper of Lothric would remain trapped on the broken bridge, even without a trace of its flame\n[[File:Grand_Archives_-_03.jpg|thumb|130px|The eclipse and the Pilgrim Butterflies in the skies of Lothric.]]\nDuring the last days of the reign, when the Flame was at the limit of its strength, the sun itself above Lothric would have weakened, transforming into an dark eclipse barely contained by the remnants of light at its contours.\nAnother result would have been the manifestation of the [[Pilgrim Butterfly|Pilgrim Butterflies]], gigantic humanoid insects born from the final evolution of humans transformed into trees on the walls of Lothric or a failed evolution of the [[Angel]]s born from the pilgrims of Londor. These beings with immense branch-like wings would infest the skies of the city, migrating towards the tip of the Castle and even taking control of the [[Dragonslayer Armour]] remaining in the military barracks.\nComplete Ruin.\n[[File:9C020144-2381-4C15-B91B-DF5880309BAA.jpg|thumb|130px|The ruins of Lothric.]]\nWhen the [[First Flame]] was reduced to a fading spark, the entire world would collapse in on itself, converging toward the [[Kiln of the First Flame (Dark Souls III)|Kiln of the Flame]] and piling up all kingdoms and cities into a [[The Dreg Heap|massive pile of rubble]]. In those times, the citizens of the kingdom even forgot the miracles of their [[Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight|goddess of sunlight queen]], ending up circulating childish but sincere [[Projected Heal|stories]] to try to recall her image and her blessings. Despite everything, the [[Lothric Knight|loyalist knights]] managed to eliminate the problem of the heretical [[Winged Knight]]s and the plague of the [[Pus of Man]], however their victory was empty as they too were now reduced to Hollows, consumed to the point of being covered in ramifications and being reduced to patrolling the piles of ruins left of their city. What remained of Lothric's citizens would sink into the [[The Deep|stagnant Abyss]], becoming possessed by the [[Human Dregs|dregs of the Dark Soul]] and manifesting as corrupted [[Murkman|murkmen]].\nReferences.\n[[Category:Dark Souls III: Mentioned Locations]]\n[[es:Lothric]]\n[[pl:Lothric]]\n[[ru:\u041b\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043a]]"}

However, it also has rather sub-par &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt; in all categories, meaning that it struggles to deal damage when it does reach its target.\nDespite having a Faith requirement and scaling, Lothric's Holy Sword actually scales very poorly with the stat, so in essence it is simply a normal straight sword with a non-negligible Faith requirement to wield, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Astora%20Straight%20Sword\"&gt;Astora Straight Sword&lt;/a&gt;. This means that rather than being a weapon suited for Faith builds, it is in fact a weapon best used by quality builds that invest a small amount of Faith for utility &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Miracles&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20Weapon\"&gt;Blessed Weapon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Denial\"&gt;Tears of Denial&lt;/a&gt;.\nRather than the standard &lt;a href=\"Stance%20%28Straight%20Sword%29\"&gt;Stance&lt;/a&gt;, Lothric's Holy Sword utilizes a modified version of the skill that gives it longer reach with the lunging thrust.

He has long, claw-like fingers, light-colored hair that falls to his shoulders, and dark, sunken eyes. The way he clings to Lorian's back during battle suggests he is unable to walk due to his illness. He wears the same &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20Set\"&gt;baby clothes&lt;/a&gt; that he used throughout his entire life. Lothric relies on &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; alone during battle, and is a considerably powerful magic user, casting homing soul masses, soul spears, and teleporting his brother around the arena. He is one of the few &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;oid magic users in the series to cast spells without any apparent &lt;a href=\"Catalysts%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;catalyst&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nLothric is the son of &lt;a href=\"Oceiros\"&gt;Oceiros, King of Lothric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gwynevere\"&gt;Gwynevere, Queen of Lothric&lt;/a&gt; and thus the younger brother of &lt;a href=\"Lorian%2C%20Elder%20Prince\"&gt;Lorian&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the older brother of &lt;a href=\"Ocelotte\"&gt;Ocelotte&lt;/a&gt;.\nLothric, as the youngest prince, was designated to become a &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;, sacrificing himself in the linking of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; to keep the Age of Fire alive. The prince was in fact the hope not only of the entire kingdom but the result of the obsession of the royal family and the king to produce a worthy Champion from among their ranks as a symbol of their divine mandate and duty. For the young man who was supposed to enter the &lt;a href=\"Kiln%20of%20the%20First%20Flame%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Kiln of the Flame&lt;/a&gt; arena, a &lt;a href=\"Lothric%27s%20Holy%20Sword\"&gt;platinum sword&lt;/a&gt; was created and blessed with strong magic by &lt;a href=\"Emma%2C%20High%20Priestess%20of%20Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;the High Priestess&lt;/a&gt; even before he was ready to fullfill his destiny. Oceiros in fact created immense propaganda around Lothric, not only giving him the name of the kingdom, but building statues that depicted him ready for sacrifice and with his sacred sword even before he linked the Flame, already preparing his throne at the &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt; who called him the hope of the kingdom. Despite all the hopes that were placed in him, Lothric soon revealed himself to be a sick and shriveled child, so weak that he never grew out of his &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20Set\"&gt;baby clothes&lt;/a&gt;, which remained his only clothing throughout his life and were blessed to at least try to keep him healthy.\nLothric continued to live and at some point &lt;a href=\"Aldia%2C%20Scholar%20of%20the%20First%20Sin\"&gt;Aldia&lt;/a&gt;, the first of the Grand Archives scholars and doubtful of the linking of the Flame, became his private mentorThe frail prince still demonstrated talent for sorcery, for which he did not need a medium being the son of a deity, and learned several &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;powerful&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Soulmass%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;refined&lt;/a&gt; spells.\nWhen the royal family realized that Lothric would not improve from his condition , they resorted to repulsive acts in an attempt to obtain a worthy Champion for the linking: the rulers would in fact bind the souls of the two brother princes together with a &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;curse&lt;/a&gt;, in the hope that the weaker Lothric would thus share the strength of Lorian, making them able to sacrifice themselves to the Flame together. Despite the monstrous practice, Lorian himself had the desire to submit to the curse, to try to help his younger brother, even at the cost of depriving the kingdom of the heir he represented. However, fate played a bad joke once again: the souls of the two brothers, linked so closely that they could nearly meld together, made them inseparable and Lorian could not die if Lothric did not too. However, their union also led the older brother to share the younger's condition, making Lorian crippled and mute to the point of being unable to walk on his own legs and the two unable to link the Flame. The now twin princes thus found themselves unable to fulfill the destiny for which they had been brought into the world and would become inseparable in kinship, fueled by their grief for their fate.. \nWhen the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; began to fade and the time came for &lt;a href=\"Lothric%2C%20Younger%20Prince\"&gt;Prince Lothric&lt;/a&gt; to fulfill his destiny and become a &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;, he simply refused. After reflecting on his &lt;a href=\"Aldia%2C%20Scholar%20of%20the%20First%20Sin\"&gt;mentor&lt;/a&gt;'s teachings, the state of the kingdom and the world, his cursed life and the atrocities committed to continue to link the Flame the prince decided to ignore his \"duty\", refusing to continue the legacy of the Lords, and instead chose to wait for the Flame's death from the distance. In fact, the prince had retired to the top of his castle together with his brother Lorian with whom he shared his soul, protected by his royal guard and the exponents of the Three Pillars: &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Knight%20Albert\"&gt;Lion Knight Albert&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hand%20Kamui\"&gt;Black Hand Kamui&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daughter%20of%20Crystal%20Kriemhild\"&gt;Daughter of Crystal Kriemhild&lt;/a&gt; . His decision shattered the realm to an unimaginable extent, and while a plague of violent and corrupted &lt;a href=\"Pus%20of%20Man\"&gt;Pus of Man&lt;/a&gt; ravaged the city , a furious civil war erupted within Lothric's walls. The government of the Three Pillars, represented by &lt;a href=\"Emma%2C%20High%20Priestess%20of%20Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;Emma&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Knight%27s%20Ring\"&gt;Knights&lt;/a&gt;, was trying to keep the kingdom together and was still attempting to convince Lothric to reconsider his position and link the fading flame. On the other side, the &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Knight\"&gt;Winged Knight&lt;/a&gt;s, a portion of the army still heralding the royal's insigna, was now clashing openly against the doctrine enforced by the government, as they had embraced the heretic \"&lt;a href=\"Divine%20Pillars%20of%20Light\"&gt;Angelic Faith&lt;/a&gt;\" spreaded by the written words of &lt;a href=\"Gertrude\"&gt;Gertrude&lt;/a&gt;. In all of this the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives%20Scholar\"&gt;scholars&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Archives&lt;/a&gt; simply decided to ignore the situation and closed the doors of their facilities, isolating themselves to continue their studies.\nThe prince's decision led the system managing the linking of the Flame to resort to an emergency measure: ringing the bells and awakening the Lords of Cinder of the past from their graves, beings who had linked the Flame and had been buried with part of it in their bodies, to unite their fire and restore energy to the fading Flame. However, not even this attempt was successful as most of the awakened Lords of Cinder, for different reasons, decided to abandon their duties, refusing to sit on their thrones and sacrifice themselves again, preferring to return to their lands. As a last desperate plan it was decided to ring the bells again and this time awaken the &lt;a href=\"Unkindled\"&gt;Unkindled&lt;/a&gt;, beings who had tried to link the Flame but, being too weak, had been turned into ashes and buried in the &lt;a href=\"Cemetery%20of%20Ash\"&gt;Cemetery of Ash&lt;/a&gt;, to make so that they would go and kill the Lords of Cinder, bringing their their cinders back to &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt;. When the Unkindled One arrives before the prince, he's welcomed by a bitter comment from Lothric, naming them as nothing but another fool attempting to win his favour or to take his life and the many feathers covering every corner of the room indicate that the &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Knight\"&gt;Winged Knight&lt;/a&gt;s had tried to reach the Prince to either persuade or kill him, but were all eliminated by the royal guards or by his brother Lorian. Lothric then watched as Lorian engaged the Unkindled One in combat and was cut down. Teleporting next to his brother's body, Lothric revived and climbed onto Lorian's back, kindling their bodies together. The brothers fought the Unkindled One almost as one, but were unable to overcome their enemy and were both cut down. As he died, Lothric warned the Unkindled One that obtained their &lt;a href=\"Cinders%20of%20a%20Lord\"&gt;cinders&lt;/a&gt; that they would always remain among the accursed."}

Dropping down from the bridge and going left lets you cross the outer courtyard and avoid their fire breath. In the chambers on the left side there is an &lt;a href=\"Boreal%20Outrider%20Knight\"&gt;Outrider Knight&lt;/a&gt;, and on the right side you can reach the lever that controls the main gate and find an opportunity to kill the wyverns by destroying the &lt;a href=\"Pus%20of%20Man\"&gt;Pus of Man&lt;/a&gt; that infest them.\nInside the gate are powerful &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Knight\"&gt;Lothric Knight&lt;/a&gt;s supported by &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Priest\"&gt;Lothric Priest&lt;/a&gt;s that will buff and heal them.

On the left of the inner courtyard is a ladder leading up to a rooftop, covered by crossbowmen, from where you can double back inside to find the &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20of%20Sunlight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Warrior of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Covenant%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;. To the right of the courtyard is a chapel where &lt;a href=\"Eygon%20of%20Carim\"&gt;Eygon of Carim&lt;/a&gt; can be summoned, if his requirements are met, as well as an elevator that can be reached from the other side in the Grand Archives."}

One that wields a straight sword and shield, one that wields a pike and dons a greatshield, and one that wields only an ultra greatsword.\nEarly on, they are introduced as stronger enemies with their faceplates down as standard knights. However, as one delves deeper into Lothric Castle, elite Lothric Knights with their faceplates raised replace their standard brethren.\nStrategy.\nLothric Knights possess a significant amount of health and are aggressive fighters; however, most of their attacks are easy to dodge through and can easily be &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;backstabbed&lt;/a&gt; by dodging behind them at the end of any of their attack chains. They are susceptible to &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parries&lt;/a&gt;, and by kicking when their shields are raised or one too many attacks are absorbed, one can score a critical hit after breaking their guard.\nThey utilize various weapon arts depending upon what they wield. For instance, the straight sword-wielding knights can perform a broad, horizontal slash that inflicts heavy stamina damage if blocked, and a vicious lunge attack that is surprisingly fast and deals heavy damage whilst potentially knocking the player down.\nLothric Knights with open visors and red eyes are much more dangerous opponents, with both greater vitality and attack power. They are far more aggressive, have more stamina to prevent their guard being broken easily, and utilize their weapon arts more often to keep pressure on the player.\nMany Lothric Knights are also capable of buffing their weapons with the &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20Weapon\"&gt;Blessed Weapon&lt;/a&gt; miracle, to inflict even more damage. However, the knights encountered in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt; will instead buff their weapon with a &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;sorcery&lt;/a&gt; akin to &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Magic%20Weapon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Crystal Magic Weapon&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite their aggression, relatively high hitpoints, and high damage, Lothric Knights have very low poise and can be stunlocked quite easily "}

It is relatively light for a greatshield, and has respectable &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt;, absorbing up to 71% of stamina damage when fully upgraded. However, its high &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; requirement prevents it from being easily used in the early game, though this can be circumvented by two-handing the shield with at least 24 Strength.\nThe Lothric Knight Greatshield has the highest &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; absorption of all shields in the game, tied with &lt;a href=\"Havel%27s%20Greatshield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Havel's Greatshield&lt;/a&gt;, but has moderate elemental defenses otherwise and in particular falls short in terms of &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; absorption. This can make it useful against caster enemies, such as the &lt;a href=\"Sage%27s%20Devout\"&gt;Sage's Devout&lt;/a&gt;s located in the &lt;a href=\"Road%20of%20Sacrifices\"&gt;Road of Sacrifices&lt;/a&gt; and especially against the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Sage\"&gt;Crystal Sage&lt;/a&gt;.

As well, it has innate &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage, allowing it to deal damage through &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt;, and because it can still be buffed this Lightning damage can be further augmented by applying a &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Pine%20Resin%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Gold Pine Resin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Pine%20Bundle\"&gt;Gold Pine Bundle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis innate Lightning damage also makes the Lothric Knight Greatsword very useful for &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt;-oriented builds as well. When infused with a &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Gem\"&gt;Lightning Gem&lt;/a&gt;, the weapon gains extreme amounts of Lightning damage that scales well with the player's Faith, making it a very fearsome weapon indeed. And when infused with a &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20Gem\"&gt;Blessed Gem&lt;/a&gt;, both the physical damage and the Lightning damage will scale with the player's Faith, while simultaneously providing background health replenishment. And finally, on a build with high investment in physical stats as well as Faith, &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Blade\"&gt;Lightning Blade&lt;/a&gt; can be cast on the weapon if it has been given a physical infusion, allowing it to utterly devastate any foes unlucky enough to be hit by it.\nUpgrades.\nReinforced with standard ."}

Its elemental resistances are moderately good, though it is severely weak against &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage and does not resist the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; very well either.

The two-handed strong attacks have impressive range, and, much like &lt;a href=\"Spears%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;spears&lt;/a&gt;, can hit for very high damage as a &lt;a href=\"counterattack\"&gt;counterattack&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis, coupled with the ability to charge strong attacks, can make the Lothric Knight Sword deal astronomical damage if timed correctly in combat.

They wield rapiers but primarily cast spells to both heal nearby enemies and provide an offensive and defensive buff.\nStrategy.\nLothric Priests pose little threat individually but they become much more dangerous when paired with &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Knight\"&gt;Lothric Knight&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Consumed%20King%27s%20Knight\"&gt;Consumed King's Knight&lt;/a&gt;s. They will attempt to heal the enemy at every opportunity and will periodically cast a buff that increases their damage dealt by 20% and reduces their damage received by 30%. With both forms of knights already capable of raising their damage with their own spells, the presence of a priest can turn them into lethal opponents.\nPriests have low vitality and will rarely retaliate if attacked; many times, they may opt to flee behind a nearby knight and then heal/buff them. The difficulty in defeating them comes from reaching them with other enemies present, so the player should either used ranged weapons to eliminate them from a distance or sprint in and eliminate them before they can buff. The latter strategy is not recommended when multiple knights are present.\nLothric Priests can heal themselves and this can become especially frustrating if facing multiple priests as they will constantly try to heal each other. &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;Area of effect&lt;/a&gt; spells and &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;s can prove effective at eliminating them quickly if the player can group them together.\nLothric Priests' buff can be used on the player if they cast &lt;a href=\"Rapport\"&gt;Rapport&lt;/a&gt; while the priest casts it, or if the player is an invader. This buff stacks with &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Oath%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Sacred Oath&lt;/a&gt; and is affected by the &lt;a href=\"Slumbering%20Dragoncrest%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Slumbering Dragoncrest Ring&lt;/a&gt;, using this can make invaders very deadly in this area."}

{"id": "150234", "revid": "33084951", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=150234", "title": "Lothric War Banner (skill)", "text": "Lothric War Banner is a &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\nThe player raises the weapon and plants it in the ground, unfurling an ethereal war banner from the standard. The player and all allies in the vicinity receive a 15% attack boost for a maximum of two minutes, affecting all forms of damage including spells. The buff will only remain active so long as the weapon is actively wielded, and is continually applied so long as allies are near the wielder.\nUnlike other buffs, this value is the same in &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nDue to a general lack of allies to buff in single player, this skill mainly finds use in buffing NPC summons such as &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Knight%20Gael\"&gt;Slave Knight Gael&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shira%2C%20Knight%20of%20Filianore\"&gt;Shira, Knight of Filianore&lt;/a&gt;. As the weapon must be actively wielded in order for the buff to be active, the Lothric War Banner can either be used as the primary weapon (with its damage bonus backed by equipping the &lt;a href=\"Leo%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Leo Ring&lt;/a&gt;), or in the off-hand while wielding another weapon in the main hand. One can also get creative with this skill by combining it with &lt;a href=\"Rapport\"&gt;Rapport&lt;/a&gt;, buffing converted mob enemies to fight under its flag.\nOnline gameplay.\nThis skill can be very useful for buffing the attack power of allies, whether as a host/summon or as an invader in a &lt;a href=\"Dried%20Finger%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dried Finger&lt;/a&gt; world. Wielding the buff will greatly augment a teammate's damage without them needing to wield the banner itself, which allows them to more easily protect the standard-bearer from harm.\nAlso worthy of note is that as an invader, the banner will buff mob enemies, greatly increasing their lethality on top of that of other invaders. This can allow an invader to turn the tide against a host's party as otherwise strong mob enemies like &lt;a href=\"Harald%20Legion%20Knight\"&gt;Harald Legion Knight&lt;/a&gt;s or red-eyed &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Knight\"&gt;Lothric Knight&lt;/a&gt;s will gain the potential to kill a summoned phantom in two hits or less."}
{"id": "133701", "revid": "49243392", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=133701", "title": "Lothric Wyvern", "text": "Lothric Wyverns are in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\nLothric Wyverns are gigantic draconic creatures that have the ability to breathe &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;. The area covered by this attack usually catches fire and remains unsafe to traverse for several seconds. Wyverns react to the player's current location and if they move to a determined distance from them, they will unleash their fiery attack.\nThey have a considerable amount of health, although they are never seen moving from their perching positions. While they can be killed by normal means, they usually can also be dealt with by alternate methods that will consume less of the player's resources.\nThe first time the player encounters one, is while traversing from the first to the second &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"High%20Wall%20of%20Lothric\"&gt;High Wall of Lothric&lt;/a&gt;, in an event reminiscent of the &lt;a href=\"Hellkite%20Dragon\"&gt;Hellkite Dragon&lt;/a&gt;'s appearance in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\". The wyvern will suddenly fly into the scene and perch itself on a tower. If the player approaches to a certain distance from the creature, it will unleash a powerful &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; breath that will pass across the lower path and cover the whole floor above. The upper floor will remain covered in flames for a few seconds, making the lower path a safer choice.\nTwo more can be encountered later in the game, guarding the main entrance to &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;Lothric Castle&lt;/a&gt;. The one on the right will appear to be dead at first, but once the player attempts to cross the main bridge, it will wake up. Another wyvern will show up and perch on the opposite building. Both of them will cover the ground with fire if the player tries to cross the bridge.\nThese two wyverns are infected by a &lt;a href=\"Pus%20of%20Man\"&gt;Pus of Man&lt;/a&gt; each, which can be found growing on one of their feet in both cases. Both wyverns will eventually die as the player manages to enter the building on the right, although their bodies will remain in place blocking a couple of paths. Destroying the still living Pus of Man on each will remove their bodies from the environment.\nLocations.\n&lt;a href=\"High%20Wall%20of%20Lothric\"&gt;High Wall of Lothric&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;Lothric Castle&lt;/a&gt;\nStrategies.\n&lt;a href=\"High%20Wall%20of%20Lothric\"&gt;High Wall of Lothric&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first wyvern is encountered while making way from the first to the second &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"High%20Wall%20of%20Lothric\"&gt;High Wall of Lothric&lt;/a&gt;. The creature will suddenly fly into the scene and perch itself on a tower located on the left side. The player will soon discover that approaching the creature will make it unleash a powerful stream of &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; all across the area, burning everything in its path. The player is then presented with two options:\nWhile at first glance, taking the lower path would seem to be the obvious choice, venturing to risk it all and exploring the upper floor instead will yield the player with much better loot that will become very useful at that moment in their journey, including an &lt;a href=\"Ember\"&gt;Ember&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Club%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Club&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Large%20Soul%20of%20a%20Deserted%20Corpse\"&gt;Large Soul of a Deserted Corpse&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Claymore%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Claymore&lt;/a&gt;, and the opportunity to fight the first &lt;a href=\"Mimic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Mimic&lt;/a&gt; in the game, which yields a &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Gem\"&gt;Deep&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Axe%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Battle Axe&lt;/a&gt; and may even drop a &lt;a href=\"Symbol%20of%20Avarice%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Symbol of Avarice&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the upper floor, the immediate area in front of the wyvern will remain covered in flames for several seconds once it has been sprayed with fire. Stepping onto the flames will deal small but constant damage, staggering the player with each hit and preventing them from drinking from their &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt;. If looting the area, it is still recommended to sustain the damage; the flames will eventually fade and provide a couple of seconds to heal before the wyvern attacks again. At that moment, it is advisable to face it and raise a shield, which will absorb part of the damage and provide a better opportunity to return to safety.\nWhile this wyvern cannot be killed, it can be scared away; doing so will yield the player with a &lt;a href=\"Large%20Titanite%20Shard%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Large Titanite Shard&lt;/a&gt;. However, it may be advisable to refrain from attacking it at the beginning of the game, since it can be used for farming purposes (&lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Wyvern%23Farming\"&gt;read below&lt;/a&gt;).\nIf desired, the wyvern can be safely subdued by damaging it with ranged attacks from the doorway found below the &lt;a href=\"High%20Wall%20of%20Lothric%23Bonfires\"&gt;Tower on the Wall&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;. Once its life bar has been reduced to about 20%, it will fly away and the shard will be automatically added to the player's inventory.\nFarming.\nAs mentioned above, scaring the wyvern away will make the zone safer to traverse. However, this wyvern can be used for farming &lt;a href=\"Souls%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt;, which can be very useful, especially in the early game, so it is advisable to leave it alone until the player can find a better source for farming.\nThe player needs some sort of ranged attack, preferably a &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; due to their low cost in ammunition. It is also advisable to procure and equip the &lt;a href=\"Covetous%20Silver%20Serpent%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Covetous Silver Serpent Ring&lt;/a&gt; before starting.\nFrom the &lt;a href=\"High%20Wall%20of%20Lothric%23Bonfires\"&gt;Tower on the Wall&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;, make way downstairs and wait until the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Knight\"&gt;Lothric Knight&lt;/a&gt; exits the tower. Deal with the nearby &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Assassin\"&gt;Hollow Assassin&lt;/a&gt; and step outside (the small platform below the doorway is safe to stand upon and the player will not take damage from the fire as long as they don't step onto the main area). Take out the bow and shoot an arrow at the wyvern's hind leg. The wyvern will turn its head and unleash fire on the area in front of the player, killing the Lothric Knight and all other enemies in the vicinity.\nOnce the first batch of enemies are dead, run down the first staircase and stand just to the right of the second one, behind the rampart's battlement (just in front of the crossbow-wielder). If done right, no enemies will come after the player. This spot is also safe and will trigger the wyvern to start breathing fire in front of it, killing all enemies on the upper floor and most of those on the corridor below.\nIf done correctly, the player will collect between 800 and 1,000+ &lt;a href=\"Soul%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; per run.\n&lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;Lothric Castle&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo wyverns can be encountered in &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;Lothric Castle&lt;/a&gt;, shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Castle%23Bonfires\"&gt;Dragon Barracks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;. Both will be perched on either side of the castle's facade. As the player approaches them, they will attack in tandem and cover the area with fire.\nIt will soon become clear that trying to run across before they attack is not the best option. What the player needs to do, is drop under the bridge before they get incinerated and make way through the left path (beware of the couple of &lt;a href=\"Pus%20of%20Man\"&gt;Pus of Man&lt;/a&gt; guarding the area).\nAfter traveling around the building where the white wyvern is perched, the player will need to time it right between the fiery barrages unleashed by the green wyvern and run across the area in front of the castle's main gate and into the next building. Taking the nearby ladder up (beware of the many ambushes prepared in this place), will lead them just behind the green wyvern's foot, which is infected by a &lt;a href=\"Pus%20of%20Man\"&gt;Pus of Man&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are some exploding barrels nearby that can be used to damage it, although a good &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;pyromancy&lt;/a&gt; will be more than enough to deal with it from a safe distance. Once the Pus of Man has been defeated, the green wyvern will die (the white one should also be dead at this moment), allowing the player to safely loot the area in front of the castle.\nThe player will eventually end up on top of the building where the white wyvern's corpse dwells. The &lt;a href=\"Pus%20of%20Man\"&gt;Pus of Man&lt;/a&gt; infecting it can be heard below and be killed with ranged attacks safely from that spot. Once dead, the wyvern's body will disappear and the player may drop to explore the area, where they may fight another &lt;a href=\"Mimic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Mimic&lt;/a&gt;. The length of this fall is considerable, though, and equipping the &lt;a href=\"Silvercat%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Silvercat Ring&lt;/a&gt; or casting &lt;a href=\"Spook\"&gt;Spook&lt;/a&gt; is advisable.\nDrops.\n&lt;tabber&gt;High Wall of Lothric =\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Due to their low drop rates, wearing &lt;a href=\"Item%20Discovery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Item Discovery&lt;/a&gt; gear is highly recommended.\nUse.\nLoyce Souls do not yield any souls upon consumption, instead they can be given to &lt;a href=\"Alsanna%2C%20Silent%20Oracle\"&gt;Alsanna&lt;/a&gt;, who will reward the player depending upon the amount of souls they have collected. The souls cannot be traded.\nFarming.\nAt first, players will more than likely notice that they will receive almost always the equipment (&lt;a href=\"Charred%20Loyce%20Set\"&gt;armor set&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Loyce%20Shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Loyce%20Greatsword\"&gt;greatsword&lt;/a&gt;) of these Charred Knights of Loyce, this is because the equipment itself has a higher chance to drop, which often overrides the chance of the Loyce Souls to drop. \nHowever, the loot pool for all equipments are limited per playthrough, which means that after obtaining a certain item from a specific enemy, a certain amount of times, those items will stop dropping from its respective source, therefore, the faster a player can acquire those items, the faster it is to find the Loyce Souls. \nIn shorter terms, the Loyce Souls start dropping much more regularly after the Charred Knights dropping a specific number of items. \nThe best way to farm the knights is during the fight against the &lt;a href=\"Burnt%20Ivory%20King\"&gt;Burnt Ivory King&lt;/a&gt;, as players will be backed up by any rescued &lt;a href=\"Knight%20of%20Eleum%20Loyce\"&gt;Loyce Knights&lt;/a&gt; (as well as summons such as &lt;a href=\"Lucatiel%20of%20Mirrah\"&gt;Lucatiel of Mirrah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twiggy%20Shei\"&gt;Twiggy Shei&lt;/a&gt;), and also due to the fact that the Charred Loyce Knights themselves will spawn more frequently (roughly 10-11 per cycle depending on how long the portals remain open). Once enough Charred Loyce Knights have been slain and the Burnt Ivory King's portal appears, the player may egress from the arena via using the &lt;a href=\"Aged%20Feather\"&gt;Aged Feather&lt;/a&gt;, and repeating the process as many times as necessary; if phantoms were summoned, be sure to use a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Separation%20Crystal%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Black Separation Crystal&lt;/a&gt; first. As these Charred Loyce Knights are treated as boss minions and not as spawned enemies, they will always appear during the boss fight no matter how many times they are killed.\nAfter defeating the Burnt Ivory King, the area of &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Chaos\"&gt;The Old Chaos&lt;/a&gt; becomes opened indefinitely and players may farm the Charred Loyce Knights that spawn from the portals. Keep in mind, however, that unlike the knights fought during the boss battle, these knights can be de-spawned after killing them enough times. This may force players to join the &lt;a href=\"Company%20of%20Champions\"&gt;Company of Champions&lt;/a&gt;, making the knights significantly tougher."}

She appears in four different locations, with her dialogue affected not by the location but by how many times she has encountered the player before; if her dialogue has been exhausted in all four locations, she will relocate to &lt;a href=\"Aldia%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Aldia's Keep&lt;/a&gt; for a fifth and final encounter. She can be summoned as a &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt; for as many as five different boss fight. \nAn undead human from &lt;a href=\"Mirrah\"&gt;Mirrah&lt;/a&gt;, she came to &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; in search of her brother &lt;a href=\"Aslatiel%20of%20Mirrah\"&gt;Aslatiel&lt;/a&gt;, who himself had travelled to Drangleic after turning undead, and is terrified at the prospect of losing her memories and turning &lt;a href=\"hollow\"&gt;hollow&lt;/a&gt;. She is also a in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;\" through the name and description of &lt;a href=\"Lucatiel%27s%20Mask%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;her mask&lt;/a&gt;, which appears as equipment.\nLocations.\nLucatiel can be found for the first time in any of the following locations and she will deliver different dialogue depending on the number of times she has previously been met:\nAfter meeting her in all of the aforementioned locations, she will appear for the last time at the first bonfire in &lt;a href=\"Aldia%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Aldia's Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nLucatiel has a rather androgynous appearance, with long, blonde hair wrapped in a ponytail, but her most distinctive feature is the metal bearded mask she uses to cover her face. Lucatiel will temporarily remove the mask after the player has gone through her entire dialogue when meeting her for the second time. This will reveal that although she is in human form, half her face has &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;Hollow&lt;/a&gt;ed, showing that she's cursed.\nLucatiel is somewhat of a loner and usually prefers to stay away from people. However, she shows great respect and admiration to those who are brave enough to speak to her and she is always willing to offer her assistance to those in need.\nAlthough Lucatiel mostly remains calm and collected, she becomes incredibly distressed with the idea of going hollow and losing all of her memories. At one point, she even claims that she would be willing to kill the player if that means that she will be able to get rid of the curse. However, in the end, Lucatiel comes to terms with herself and accepts that she will eventually go hollow.\nLucatiel wields the &lt;a href=\"Mirrah%20Greatsword\"&gt;Mirrah Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mirrah%20Shield\"&gt;Mirrah Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nLucatiel was born into a family of peasants in &lt;a href=\"Mirrah\"&gt;Mirrah&lt;/a&gt;, an unprivileged part of the society of this kingdom. In order to ensure the well-being of her family, Lucatiel and her brother joined the army. At an early age, she and her brother took up fencing together and, eventually, Lucatiel's skills on the battlefield allowed her to become a knightess of the Order.\nAlthough Lucatiel was a skilled combatant, she was no match for her brother. She claims that her brother was a far better swordsman than she was, as she was never able to defeat him. At some point in her life, her brother disappeared without a trace. Lucatiel thought that her brother might have fallen victim to the &lt;a href=\"undead%20curse\"&gt;undead curse&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter she contracted the curse of undeath, Lucatiel went to &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; as it was rumored that the cure could be found in this land. With time, she became certain that her brother must have come here too. Lucatiel later confides that she feels the curse is taking over her, and that her memories begin to fade away, starting with the oldest.\nPlot.\nWhen Lucatiel is found for the first time, she will introduce herself and explain her motives for being in Drangleic. She will also offer her assistance to the player during their journey.\nDuring her second encounter, Lucatiel will tell the player about her past in Mirrah. She will then take off her mask, revealing her half hollowed appearance, and give the player a &lt;a href=\"Human%20Effigy\"&gt;Human Effigy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe third time she is met, she tells the player about her fears of losing her memories and of her brother. Lucatiel will explain how he is a better swordsman than her and she confesses that her brother, who is another victim of the curse of undeath, might be in Drangleic. She then gifts the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Steel%20Protection%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Ring of Steel Protection +1&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe fourth time that the player finds Lucatiel, she is very confused and distressed over the curse, and says she would do anything to get rid of it, even if it meant killing the player. After exhausting her dialogue, she will be available as &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt; for another boss fight and will move to the next area.\nLastly, Lucatiel can be found in a shack at the first bonfire of &lt;a href=\"Aldia%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Aldia's Keep&lt;/a&gt;. She will be distressed if the player has not summoned and kept her alive for three boss fights, and begs the player to remember her name, as she may not. Lucatiel will disappear from the game after this encounter. If the player has summoned Lucatiel and kept her alive for three of the four summonable boss fights in the base game, she will thank the player for keeping her sane, and bequeath her &lt;a href=\"Lucatiel%27s%20Set\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Mirrah%20Greatsword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; to the player. This is necessary for unlocking her &lt;a href=\"Lucatiel%20of%20Mirrah%23Achievements/Trophies\"&gt;achievement/trophy&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter meeting her in Aldia's Keep, she will disappear from the game, and her final fate remains unknown, leaving it up to the player's own interpretation.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Spirit\"&gt;invader&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Aslatiel%20of%20Mirrah\"&gt;Aslatiel of Mirrah&lt;/a&gt; later appears just before entering Aldia's Keep itself. He wears the same armor and weapon set as Lucatiel, which suggests that her brother indeed went hollow exploring &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nAs of Patch 1.04, Lucatiel received an immense buff to her defense, making her capable of withstanding most of hits thrown at her.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Gulch\"&gt;Black Gulch&lt;/a&gt; she has now complete immunity to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage.\nHer AI remained the same though, which means she could still get stuck in the environment on her way to the boss or fall to her death accidentally.\nLocations.\nLucatiel can be summoned at the following locations:\nHer summon sign is found beyond the gate in the shortcut leading to the boss fight. \nHer summon sign is found past the shortcut on the dock. &lt;a href=\"Bradley%20of%20the%20Old%20Guard\"&gt;Bradley of the Old Guard&lt;/a&gt; can be summoned for this fight as well. \nHer summon sign is located at the bottom of the elevator of &lt;a href=\"Sinners%27%20Rise\"&gt;Sinners' Rise&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sellsword%20Luet\"&gt;Sellsword Luet&lt;/a&gt; can be summoned for this fight as well. \nHer summon sign is found in front of the fog gate of this boss.\nHer summon sign is located by the &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Hidden Chamber&lt;/a&gt; bonfire. &lt;a href=\"Bashful%20Ray\"&gt;Bashful Ray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lone%20Hunter%20Schmidt\"&gt;Lone Hunter Schmidt&lt;/a&gt; can be summoned for this battle as well.\nHer summon sign will appear in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Cathedral\"&gt;Grand Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; near the iron chest only after she is talked to at &lt;a href=\"Aldia%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Aldia's Keep&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Twiggy%20Shei\"&gt;Twiggy Shei&lt;/a&gt; can be summoned for this battle as well."}

For most weapons this would be fine, however, this is a Halberd, and its strong attack moveset is not only extremely telegraphed and slow, but also has a very small hitbox, when one handed. When two handed it does have an advantage, as it will deal an attack that makes the player spin twice, easy to block and could surely cause players be surprised.\nAs such this is a weapon that should be used only when two handed and primarily against enemies or players who are extremely reliant on &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt;. However, if the player wants weapons capable of dealing damage through shields, then the &lt;a href=\"Reapers\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; class of weapons is much more advised as any attack will go through shields.

This art was able to grant powers once thought unattainable but that at one point also left a foul stain upon Courland's honor. Ludleth himself became a student of transposition, mastering the arts of extracting and transferring the true power of souls.\nAt a certain point the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; began to fade again and the first &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Keeper\"&gt;Fire Keeper&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt; had a vision of the end of the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Age of Fire&lt;/a&gt; and the beginning of an &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Dark\"&gt;Age of Dark&lt;/a&gt;, a barren plane of endless darkness. For this reason, Ludleth was called to become a &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;, to link the First Flame again and repel the dark vision of the Fire Keeper. Despite his apparent lack of strength and his small appearance, Ludleth managed to gain the strength necessary to become a Champion, something for which he himself expresses remorse and asking to be forgiven. Despite his role, Ludleth was then literally exiled from his country and collaborated with Lothric, ensuring that the first Fire Keeper was deprived of her &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20a%20Fire%20Keeper\"&gt;eyes&lt;/a&gt; and that all future maidens like her were deprived of their sight to prevent them from observing the future thanks to the power of their darkness. The original eyes were hidden in a &lt;a href=\"Untended%20Graves\"&gt;version&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt; on the verge of sinking into darkness and where the First Flame was an instant away from being extinguished.\nFinally Ludleth linked the First Flame, taking pride of sacrificing himself of his own volution and convinced that, if in life he had been only a pygmy, in death he would have been celebrated as a true Lord. However, like the other Lords of Cinder, Ludleth was pulled from the First Flame while he was still burning in agony and buried so that he could conserve some &lt;a href=\"Cinders%20of%20a%20Lord\"&gt;cinders&lt;/a&gt; and serve as fuel for kindling the Flame when in the future no other champion would be available to ignite it again.\nServices.\nOnce the player reaches the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Undead Settlement&lt;/a&gt;, Ludleth will inform them that he is capable of performing soul transposition, but requires a &lt;a href=\"Transposing%20Kiln\"&gt;Transposing Kiln&lt;/a&gt; to do so. The Transposing Kiln can be obtained by defeating the &lt;a href=\"Curse-rotted%20Greatwood\"&gt;Curse-rotted Greatwood&lt;/a&gt; within the Undead Settlement.

While most are encountered in the marshlands of the &lt;a href=\"Road%20of%20Sacrifices\"&gt;Road of Sacrifices&lt;/a&gt;, a single Lycanthrope can be found locked in a cell in the &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20Dungeon\"&gt;Irithyll Dungeon&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nLycanthropes are initially passive and will ignore the player until they either attack them or step directly into their field of view. They are fast and aggressive creatures that primarily attack with a series of rapid slashes, though they will also use a ground pound at very close range. They also have a grab attack that drains the player's &lt;a href=\"Hit%20Points%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; whilst granting them a small damage buff.\nAlthough aggressive, Lycanthropes are easy to stagger. Despite their size, they have a surprisingly small amount of HP and can be killed quickly if the player uses an aggressive approach. One-handed attacks might prove the solution if the Lycanthrope's speed outstaggers you while two-handing."}

They carry large and sharpened tree branches which they use like spears.\nWhile they don't have a considerable amount of health and can be staggered easily, they can, in return, inflict a surprising amount of damage, either by stabbing at the player, charging at them from long distances, or by impaling their weapons on the ground with great force.\nThey are usually encountered in large groups and it is not rare suddenly finding oneself surrounded by many of these foes, as other hunters in the vicinity will frequently join in to an ongoing battle.\nSome hunters can initially be encountered in a passive state, hidden amongst the woods' dense foliage or even immersed in their own endeavors, and will not attack unless one passes nearby.\nLocation.\nFound in the &lt;a href=\"Road%20of%20Sacrifices\"&gt;Road of Sacrifices&lt;/a&gt;. Lycanthrope Hunters heavily populate the &lt;a href=\"Road%20of%20Sacrifices%23Bonfires\"&gt;Crucifixion Woods&lt;/a&gt; all along the left shore of the marsh that leads from the &lt;a href=\"Road%20of%20Sacrifices%23Bonfires\"&gt;Halfway Fortress&lt;/a&gt; toward the keep's ruins.\nStrategy.\nWhile their decayed appearance may initially imply otherwise, Lycanthrope Hunters should not be taken lightly, as they can deal a surprising amount of damage and will most likely attack in groups. They have a very long aggro range and may commence their charges from very far away and keep rushing toward the player for a considerable distance. Additionally, the weight of the large branches they carry allow them to drain large amounts of &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; with each hit, potentially being able to &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Break\"&gt;break the player's guard&lt;/a&gt; easily if their attacks are blocked.\nHunters are susceptible to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; and will panic for a few seconds when they take any fire damage, preventing them from moving or attacking.\nThe first groups of hunters encountered can be found traversing from the marsh toward the keep's ruins. It is advisable to draw-in those who fall behind with ranged attacks to dwindle their numbers.\nThey are susceptible to &lt;a href=\"Alluring%20Skull%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Alluring Skulls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rapport\"&gt;Rapport&lt;/a&gt;, which can be used if the player suddenly finds themselves in a precarious situation."}

This can prove especially effective for &lt;a href=\"Hexes\"&gt;hexers&lt;/a&gt;, as it becomes a strong &lt;a href=\"Catalysts%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;catalyst&lt;/a&gt; while still being useful in melee combat.\nThis weapon should be viewed similarly to other weapons that double as catalysts, like the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Flame\"&gt;Blue Flame&lt;/a&gt;, and their strategies also apply accordingly, for instance, using two Maces of the Insolent means that the player can buff them with either &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Blade%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Sunlight Blade&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Resonant%20Weapon\"&gt;Resonant Weapon&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=\"powerstance\"&gt;powerstance&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0them to get additional attack moves while still being able to cast spells."}

For weapons, this bonus value is expressed as blue text alongside the base attack value on the &lt;a href=\"Equipment%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Equipment&lt;/a&gt; Status screen in-game.\nThe Magic Attack Bonus value is determined by the &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stats%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;stat&lt;/a&gt;. This value is then multiplied by the Magic scaling weapon or casting tool's Magic scaling stat, then added to the attack rating along with any other scaling. In order to continually increase Magic Attack Bonus, Intelligence needs to be leveled up. Diminishing returns begin at 40 Intelligence, and becomes worse after 50. Magic Attack Bonus caps at 200 points, when Intelligence is at 99.\nMagic weapons.\nThe following is a list of weapons and &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; that bear an innate Magic Damage effect. All &lt;a href=\"staves\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt; deal in Magic Damage, thus are not listed below. For information as to how these weapons are effected by Magic infusions, see &lt;a href=\"%23Infusion\"&gt;this section&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoosting Magic Damage.\nThere are two methods to increase Magic Attack.\nThe bonus granted from the &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20Clutch%20Ring\"&gt;Sorcery Clutch Ring&lt;/a&gt; can boost the Magic Attack value for both &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Sorceries&lt;/a&gt; (via the &lt;a href=\"Staves\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt;) and Magic weapons, but reduced &lt;a href=\"physical%20defense\"&gt;physical defense&lt;/a&gt;s. The Magic bonus amount can vary depending on what type of staff or Magic weapon or is equipped, be it &lt;a href=\"%23Magic%20Weapons\"&gt;innate Magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%23Infusion\"&gt;infused Magic&lt;/a&gt; or both.\n&lt;a href=\"Unleash%20Magic\"&gt;Unleash Magic&lt;/a&gt; is a unique sorcery that temporarily increases the Magic Attack of all Sorceries and Hexes by 20%, but at a cost of reducing Heath by 30%. Magic Attack on weapons is not affected.\nMagic augmentation and consumables.\nMost weapons can be given the ability to deal Magic Damage temporarily through the use of &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Sorceries&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Aromatic%20Ooze\"&gt;Aromatic Ooze&lt;/a&gt;. The damage of these buffs does not scale with the Magic Attack Bonus, rather applies a flat bonus based on the weapon's original Magic Damage (WoMD), if any. If the weapon bears an innate Magic effect, the Magic damage value is boosted. The duration of Sorcery buffs are however dependent on the Intelligence stat. Applying Magic buffs result in the weapon taking on a blue glow.\nUnlike weapon buffs, the damage &lt;a href=\"Witching%20Urn\"&gt;Witching Urn&lt;/a&gt; deal scale based on the Magic Attack Bonus value. They can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Merchant%20Hag%20Melentia\"&gt;Merchant Hag Melentia&lt;/a&gt; for 400 &lt;a href=\"Souls%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; each. &lt;a href=\"Ammunition%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Arrows and bolts&lt;/a&gt; laced with Magic deal a flat Magic Damage value, plus their &lt;a href=\"physical%20damage\"&gt;physical damage&lt;/a&gt;. Arrows and bolts can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Chancellor%20Wellager\"&gt;Chancellor Wellager&lt;/a&gt;.\nMagic Defense.\nMagic Defense (abbreviated as Magic DEF in-game) governs how robust the player is against Magic-based attacks.\nInnate Defense.\nInnate Magic Defense describes the value of the players Magic Defense when not influenced by any outside factors, such as &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;, or consumables. A hidden Magic Defense stat of 100 points is always granted, regardless of character &lt;a href=\"Class%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;. Magic Defense can be increased incrementally through leveling &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. For example, if Intelligence is at 50, Magic Defense will be set to 170 points. Innate Magic Defense caps at 200 points, when Intelligence is at 99.\nMagic Defense cap.\nTotal Magic Defense is capped at 890 points. Combined with the hidden stat of 100 points, Magic Defense can reach a maximum of 990 points. Since 1000 points of any magical or elemental defense equals immunity, Magic Damage cannot be completely nullified, with the exception of blocking with a &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;. For information on how to achieve this cap, see &lt;a href=\"%23Achieving%20the%20cap\"&gt;this section&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor and shields.\nVarious armor pieces grant varying levels of Magic Defense. The following armor table shows the armor pieces which grant the highest possible Magic Defense, for each body part. Curiously, &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Tooth%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dragon Tooth&lt;/a&gt; is unique in that it provides an additional 50 points of resistance to Magic when wielded. One can be wielded in each hand to provided twice the resistance.\nShields will only block Magic attacks if the player is actively blocking. Merely equipping the shield does not count towards defense. The Magic defense value on shields is expressed as a percentage in-game, as opposed to points on armor. Any shield had the ability to block 100% of Magic temporarily via the &lt;a href=\"Strong%20Magic%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Strong Magic Shield&lt;/a&gt; sorcery.\nThe following shields table shows all shields that grant at least 75% reduction:\nItems and spells.\nCertain defensive spells can increase Magic Defense, with varying results, but they cannot be stacked with each other. Only one spell can be active at a time. &lt;a href=\"Small%20Blue%20Burr\"&gt;Small Blue Burr&lt;/a&gt;s are consumable &lt;a href=\"Items%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; that can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Rosabeth%20of%20Melfia\"&gt;Rosabeth of Melfia&lt;/a&gt; for 1200 souls each. Small Blue Burrs cannot be stacked with any of the defensive spells either. Consuming a Small Blue Burr will remove the Magic Defense provided by the spell, and apply the Small Blue Burr defense value.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Strong%20Magic%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Strong Magic Shield&lt;/a&gt; sorcery can be cast on any shield to imbue it with Magic, similar to &lt;a href=\"infusion\"&gt;infusion&lt;/a&gt;s. This grants the shield a 100% defense against all types of attacks (including Magic, physical, and some &lt;a href=\"Negative%20Status%20Effects%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;status effects&lt;/a&gt;) when blocking, however the effect is temporarily and the duration of the spell is dependent on the &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; stat.\nRings.\nOnly two rings provide Magic Defense. Both can be worn together, granting a maximum of 270 Magic Defense, at the highest item level. Like all other rings, duplicate rings cannot be worn simultaneously.\nOther.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Tooth%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dragon Tooth&lt;/a&gt; is unique in that it provides an additional 50 points of resistance to Magic when wielded. One can be wielded in each hand to provided twice the resistance.\nLowering Defense.\nAn overall Magic Defense penalty can be incurred by equipping certain weapons:\nAchieving the cap.\nIn practice, raising Magic Defense to ~990 (or 99%) is achievable by combining several pieces of gear - albeit temporarily as a spell is required. This can be useful in situations when facing enemies who deal very high levels of Magic Damage, such as the &lt;a href=\"Smelter%20Demon%20%28Iron%20Passage%29\"&gt;Smelter Demon&lt;/a&gt; in Iron Passage.\nThe table below illustrates how the cap can be reached using a combination of gear with high resistance, however other methods using a combination different armor, spells or items is certainly possible. Since the &lt;a href=\"Warlock%20Mask\"&gt;Warlock Mask&lt;/a&gt; is a rare drop, it can be substituted with a &lt;a href=\"Throne%20Watcher%20Helm\"&gt;Throne Watcher Helm&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Penal%20Mask\"&gt;Penal Mask&lt;/a&gt;, both of which offer moderate defense.\nNote that the table below does not take into account the player's displayed innate Magic DEF, which is a variable (between 0 - 200) based on the &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; stat.\nInfusion.\n &lt;a href=\"Steady%20Hand%20McDuff\"&gt;Steady Hand McDuff&lt;/a&gt; can &lt;a href=\"infuse\"&gt;infuse&lt;/a&gt; most weapons with Magic through the use of a &lt;a href=\"Faintstone\"&gt;Faintstone&lt;/a&gt;. Once a weapon is infused, the Magic icon () will be displayed next to its image in the HUD.\nEnemies.\nThe following is a breakdown of Enemies and Bosses information relating to Magic damage and resistance."}

Though do not be fooled by critical modifiers as most other weapons will out perform Mail Breaker on crits even with on weapons with lower crit mods due to them possessing higher innate damage for the lower modifier to work off of. \nAlthough the in-game stat menus show Mail Breaker having a 120 critical rate, this weapon also benefits from a higher &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;motion value&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Backstab\"&gt;Backstabs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte\"&gt;Ripostes&lt;/a&gt; making it deal higher damage that usual on these critical attacks like all of the other Thrusting Swords. \nUpgrades.\nScaling Percentage Values.\nThe following chart lists the scaling percentages when this weapon is fully upgraded.

However, the Mail Breaker always had a moderate critical modifier like the unpatched daggers, which means that is now superior to any other dagger, potentially being able to deal more damage than even the top tier daggers. This, added to the fact that its moveset is that of a rapier, with the exception that its one handed strong attack is exactly the same has its one handed weak attack, makes it so that the Mail Breaker, though a Rapier, is in essence quite possibly the best dagger in the game."}

Caution should be exercised, as there are three &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Warrior\"&gt;Ashen Warriors&lt;/a&gt; in the ash on the ground that will attempt to ambush any unwary player as they go for the chest.\nCharacteristics.\nAs noted in the description, the sword has historically been wielded by &lt;a href=\"Gordin%2C%20Wandering%20Knight%20of%20Forossa\"&gt;left-handed swordsmen&lt;/a&gt;. As such, when the weapon is equipped in the player's left hand, it provides different strong attacks and gains noticeably increased damage scaling (including scaling on infused damage types). These unique strong attacks are quite slow, but force enemies off their feet.\nOne should take care to not use the strong attacks of this weapon too often, as it wears down its &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; quickly, putting emphasis on needing to be watched carefully to ensure it doesn't break while in combat or using the &lt;a href=\"Bracing%20Knuckle%20Ring\"&gt;Bracing Knuckle Ring&lt;/a&gt; to slow down the durability loss. This is easily noted as one uses the one-handed strong attack often, especially against mobs of enemies.\nThis weapon has a unique &lt;a href=\"Power%20Stance\"&gt;power stance&lt;/a&gt; strong attack when dual-wielded with any greatsword (other weapon types will use the power stance attack of that weapon), where the player spins and slashes with both weapons before jumping and flipping into a downward smash, forcing enemies to the ground.\nIn PvE, many enemies can be knocked down with any of the unique strong attacks (one-handed, two-handed, power stance). As non-player entities are still vulnerable to the two-handed and power stance strong attacks when knocked down, one is able to land further strong attacks, repeatedly forcing the enemy down until dead, as stamina can regenerate faster than the time it takes for the enemy to get back up and retaliate (even without the &lt;a href=\"Chloranthy%20Ring\"&gt;Chloranthy Ring&lt;/a&gt;).\nIt has a B scaling with &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; when upgraded to +5.\nInterestingly, when the sword is wielded in the right hand, the moveset mirrors that of the &lt;a href=\"Claymore%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Claymore&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpgrades.\n&lt;tabber&gt; Left =\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

There are some landmarks in Majula, such as a small tower on the edge of town, a mansion where a map of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; can be found, and a deep pit in the center with tunnels - accessible by ladder - leading to the &lt;a href=\"Grave%20of%20Saints\"&gt;Grave of Saints&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Gutter\"&gt;The Gutter&lt;/a&gt;.\nMajula acts as the main hub, or base, for the player character during the events of the game, much like the Nexus in \"&lt;a href=\"Demon%27s%20Souls\"&gt;Demon's Souls&lt;/a&gt;\" and the &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\".

In his second appearance, he is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"White%20Ring\"&gt;White Ring&lt;/a&gt; as well.\nDescription.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Brume%20Tower\"&gt;Brume Tower&lt;/a&gt;, after taking damage he will retreat down the stairs and wait for the player at the bottom. The tower contains several &lt;a href=\"Possessed%20Armor\"&gt;Possessed Armor&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Warrior\"&gt;Ashen Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and an &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Idol\"&gt;Ashen Idol&lt;/a&gt; that inflicts &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt;, making it incredibly risky to chase after him. Wearing the &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Skin\"&gt;Hollow Skin&lt;/a&gt; will make the player immune to the curse. If the player hasn't acquired it yet, wearing the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Binding\"&gt;Ring of Binding&lt;/a&gt; while hollow may help alleviate HP reduction; caution should still be taken with the large amount of enemies at the bottom of the tower, though. If he is left alone long enough at the bottom of the tower, he may even use an &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt; to heal himself.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Eleum%20Loyce\"&gt;Frozen Eleum Loyce&lt;/a&gt;, he will disguise himself as a White Phantom using a White Ring in order to trick the player, even performing a gesture in greeting. However, he will attempt to backstab the player as soon as they let their guard down, so it is advisable to attack him immediately. Once his ruse is discovered, he will flee from the player and try to ambush them as they explore the area. If the large gate near his location has been unlocked, he will retreat down to the pit with the &lt;a href=\"Covetous%20Demon\"&gt;Covetous Demon&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nBrume Tower.\nBefore even attempting to fight Maldron, it's advisable to find and wear the &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Skin\"&gt;Hollow Skin&lt;/a&gt; first. He has a considerable amount of HP, each successful backstab on him will only deplete about \u2153 of his health bar (depending on the player's weaponry and stats). He usually tries to chain his attacks in numbers of three or four, having excellent tracking on the player's current position. His attacks drain big amounts of stamina, so blocking them is not advisable lest the player risk suffering a &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Break\"&gt;guard break&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs mentioned above, once he has sustained enough damage, he'll try to escape to the bottom of the tower and stand right in front of the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Idol\"&gt;Ashen Idol&lt;/a&gt; to protect it, waiting for the player to come down. His escape routine may also trigger automatically once enough time has passed, however. If the player can keep him occupied while he's trying to escape, he'll stay to fight for a moment until he tries to escape again. The whole spiral staircase will be full of hindrances, though: four &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Warrior\"&gt;Ashen Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s perched on cogs (two on each one) constantly throwing firebombs, two more double-wielding battle axes waiting throughout the stairs, and two immortal &lt;a href=\"Possessed%20Armor\"&gt;Possessed Armor&lt;/a&gt;s which will come back to life every time shortly after being defeated until the Idol has been destroyed, not to mention the fast &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt; buildup that affects almost the entire tower.\nIf the player immediately hugs the right wall after stepping off the iron chain bridge that connects to the tower, Maldron won't attack immediately, leaving the player enough time to clear out the tower before fighting him. Alternatively, and perhaps the best method to deal with him, is to simply use a &lt;a href=\"Seed%20of%20a%20Tree%20of%20Giants\"&gt;Seed of a Tree of Giants&lt;/a&gt; when he makes his way down, and just wait for the rest of the enemies to kill him.\nMaldron is susceptible to being poisoned, so &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Throwing%20Knife%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poison Throwing Knives&lt;/a&gt; are recommended for ranged attacks. Also, as most of his attacks require him to lunge, he often leaves himself open for backstabbing.\nHe is very easy to parry, so doing so is a good strategy as it will allow the player to do a lot of damage.\u00a0\nFrozen Eleum Loyce.\nMaldron's combat tactics will have greatly improved from when you met him at Brume Tower:\nHe awaits upstairs of the first building located on the second floor. The second building hosts a bonfire, so it's recommended to rest first to prepare for the battle, and also scout the area and kill every enemy around, as he'll try to lure you into them when his escape routine triggers. This time he's not considered to be an invader, so using a Seed of a Tree of Giants won't have any benefit at all and he also won't drop a Human Effigy upon defeat. He can be &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;poisoned&lt;/a&gt;, though, so it's advisable to bring and equip &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Throwing%20Knife%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poison Throwing Knives&lt;/a&gt;. As soon as you meet him, he'll perform the \"Righty-ho!\" &lt;a href=\"Gestures%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;gesture&lt;/a&gt;, this leaves him open for you to score a free hit. If you turn your back on him while he's apparently non-hostile, he'll try to backstab you. If you turn again while he's attempting to do this, he may respond by performing another gesture.\nA very easy way to defeat him is to bring a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Hammers%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;great hammer&lt;/a&gt; with you and hold it with both hands. As soon as you meet him, and while he's waving at you, &lt;a href=\"Backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt; him. When he's trying to stand up, perform a strong attack to make him drop again; timing is crucial, as the attack won't connect if done too early, and he'll roll away if done too late. Just keep smashing him into the ground until he dies."}

As such, it requires a similarly unique build in order to utilize, as players must skill Intelligence in order to meet the casting requirements of various &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Sorceries&lt;/a&gt;, as well as Luck in order to boost the effectiveness of the catalyst itself.\nThe most effective way to use this staff is not to level Intelligence and Luck equally, but rather to level Intelligence and &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Attunement&lt;/a&gt; as supplements to a primarily Luck-based build. This gives the player access to powerful utility spells that complement Luck-based weapons, particularly in invasions, without the need to invest massive amounts of Intelligence to boost the hitting power of their spells.\nAt 40 Luck, the Man-grub's Staff has a higher effective &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Buff\"&gt;Spell Buff&lt;/a&gt; than any other staff at 45 Intelligence, and only loses out to pure Intelligence-focused staves at 50 Intelligence and higher.\nAt the base wielding requirement of 18 Intelligence, players will have access to utility spells such as &lt;a href=\"Chameleon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Chameleon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Snap%20Freeze\"&gt;Snap Freeze&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Great%20Heavy%20Soul%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Great Heavy Soul Arrow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spook\"&gt;Spook&lt;/a&gt;. However, increasing Intelligence to 23 (which can also be achieved by simply equipping a &lt;a href=\"Scholar%20Ring\"&gt;Scholar Ring&lt;/a&gt;) will give the player access to relatively powerful spells such as &lt;a href=\"Great%20Farron%20Dart\"&gt;Great Farron Dart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Flashsword\"&gt;Farron Flashsword&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Soulmass%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Homing Soulmass&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Greatsword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Soul Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpgrades.\nReinforced with &lt;a href=\"Upgrade%20Materials%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Titanite&lt;/a&gt;."}

They live high on the mountains, in &lt;a href=\"Archdragon%20Peak\"&gt;Archdragon Peak&lt;/a&gt;, where they are mostly isolated from the rest of the world and have erected large temples to worship their ancestors.\nThey wear badly worn and dirty clothes, with their long snake-like heads wrapped in rags, and come armed either with paired &lt;a href=\"Bandit%27s%20Knife%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;knives&lt;/a&gt;, or with a &lt;a href=\"Man%20Serpent%20Hatchet\"&gt;shotel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Small%20Leather%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Dragon%20Greatshield\"&gt;greatshield&lt;/a&gt;. Certain variants also have the ability to spew fireballs.\nTheir offensive capabilities are not restricted just to the weapons they wield, and they can even lash out or bite with their long reptilian heads, draining large amounts of &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nMan Serpents usually attack in groups, given their bandit-like nature, and are experts in preparing ambushes, sometimes found hiding behind pillars or corners, or even clinging from the ceilings.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bandit%27s%20Knife%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;knives&lt;/a&gt;-wielding variant is the quickest and most aggressive. Special care must be taken when they raise their secondary knife as a shield. Attacking them while in this stance will result in them &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parrying&lt;/a&gt; and then \"&lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;riposting&lt;/a&gt;\" by biting the head of their adversaries, lifting them from the ground and then lashing them back down for high damage.\nThe fireball spewing variants are also dangerous, as they have an extremely long aggro range and their projectiles have homing capabilities, serving mainly as distractions when the player is fending off other enemies, not to mention they do a considerable amount of &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage. It is advisable to kill them with ranged attacks from very far away, before they become hostile, or, if the player is skilled enough, rush forward and slay them while evading the rest of the enemies."}

Their main method of attack consists in infinitely summoning enemies to deal with their foes, though they are also capable of using a whip at close range, as well as casting sorceries similar to &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Soul\"&gt;Deep Soul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Affinity\"&gt;Affinity&lt;/a&gt; with their &lt;a href=\"Mendicant%27s%20Staff\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt;. They are usually positioned away from the player's immediate reach, allowing them to summon at least one enemy to contend with. They are very weak at close range, falling from a few hits of a melee weapon. While capable of moving, they are very slow and seem to avoid it.\nThe first one is encountered on the second floor of the &lt;a href=\"Archdragon%20Peak%23Bonfires\"&gt;Dragon-Kin Mausoleum&lt;/a&gt; and summons &lt;a href=\"Drakeblood%20Knight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Drakeblood Knights&lt;/a&gt; to fight for him. The first encounter with this foe will drop the &lt;a href=\"Drakeblood%20Greatsword\"&gt;Drakeblood Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, there is a rare chance it will summon &lt;a href=\"Havel%20the%20Rock%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Havel the Rock&lt;/a&gt; at this location. Defeating him here will yield the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Tooth%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dragon Tooth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Havel%27s%20Greatshield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Havel's Greatshield&lt;/a&gt;. If Havel has been killed in his location adjacent to the Great Belfry, the summoner can no longer call him for aid, making the Drakeblood Knight the only summon available.\nThe second summoner can be found before reaching the &lt;a href=\"Archdragon%20Peak%23Bonfires\"&gt;Great Belfry&lt;/a&gt; bonfire. This one calls in the &lt;a href=\"Rapier%20Champion\"&gt;Rapier Champion&lt;/a&gt;, a very powerful enemy similar to the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Master\"&gt;Sword Master&lt;/a&gt;, although he wields a rapier instead, and is garbed in &lt;a href=\"Wolnir%27s%20Crown\"&gt;Wolnir's Crown&lt;/a&gt;, though he does not drop it. Defeating this enemy the first time yields &lt;a href=\"Ricard%27s%20Rapier%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Ricard's Rapier&lt;/a&gt;. This summoner can also call in Havel, though the same conditions apply to the first summoner should Havel be slain.\nLocation.\nFound in &lt;a href=\"Archdragon%20Peak\"&gt;Archdragon Peak&lt;/a&gt;. Only two are encountered in the game, the first one on the second floor of the &lt;a href=\"Archdragon%20Peak%23Bonfires\"&gt;Dragon-Kin Mausoleum&lt;/a&gt; and the second one before reaching the Great Belfry.\nStrategy.\nThe summoners rely mostly on summoning enemies as their main form of attack, though they are capable of casting sorceries from a distance while you engage the enemies. Up close they are slow to attack with the whip, though they cast sorceries at a faster rate. However, they cannot summon when in melee combat, or casting ranged sorceries. Both summoners have only a modicum of health and are also vulnerable to headshots."}

He can be summoned for the boss battle against &lt;a href=\"Scorpioness%20Najka\"&gt;Scorpioness Najka&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0once his dialogue is exhausted, though the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Whispers\"&gt;Ring of Whispers&lt;/a&gt; is required to do so. His sign can be found on the ground directly outside Najka's &lt;a href=\"Fog%20Door%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;fog gate&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlot.\nManscorpion Tark and Scorpioness Najka were once a peaceful couple living a quiet existence in the &lt;a href=\"Shaded%20Ruins\"&gt;Shaded Ruins&lt;/a&gt;. But as time passed, Najka slowly began losing her mind and became more and more violent and unreasonable as a result. A war began between Tark and Najka, and has been waged for many years before the player's arrival. If spoken to while wearing the Ring of Whispers, Tark requests that the player defeat Najka, leading to the placing of his summon sign outside her fog door.\nLore.\nTark explains that he and Najka were created by a \"master\" who has long since disappeared. It can be strongly assumed that Tark and Najka are experiments, similar to &lt;a href=\"The%20Duke%27s%20Dear%20Freja\"&gt;The Duke's Dear Freja&lt;/a&gt;, possibly sharing the same \"master\" or creator.\u00a0He also claims that he and Najka are the only two of his kind that can speak \"the human tongue\", implying there may be more scorpion hybrids, or experiments located across &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; and beyond. \nIt is implied that Tark and Najka's creator was &lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;Seath the Scaleless&lt;/a&gt; as Tark mentions that his \"master\" was born with a fatal flaw, which provoked hatred against his peers. In time the \"master\" also lost his mind because of his research. This may be a reference to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;first game&lt;/a&gt;, as this description is very similar to that of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;Seath the Scaleless&lt;/a&gt;."}

Start from the bonfire, and go through the door at the top of the nearby staircase (must be hollow for the door to open). After getting to the other tower, simply go down the stairs and out the door. From here the Manslayer is found inside a chest behind the columns in the water, to the left.\nCharacteristics.\nThis katana is interesting, due to the fact that it is exactly the same as the &lt;a href=\"Uchigatana%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Uchigatana&lt;/a&gt; when both are fully upgraded, with the added bonus of dealing &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; damage. Aside from that, its damage, its scaling and moveset are identical in every way.\nThe only real downsides to the Manslayer are that it must be upgraded through &lt;a href=\"Twinkling%20Titanite%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Twinkling Titanite&lt;/a&gt;, its extra unit of weight when compared to the Uchigatana, and that it is the inferior choice if the player wants to go for an elemental infusion. It has also a very minute increase to its stats requirement, thus being the second easiest katana to wield, the first being the Uchigatana. It can also be noted that the Uchigatana is slightly longer than the Manslayer.\nTrivia.\nThe Manslayer's description is possibly a reference to the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Hitokiri_of_the_Bakumatsu\"&gt;Four Hitokiri of the Bakumatsu&lt;/a&gt;, four samurai who were considered unbeatable by normal men. Additionally, 'hitokiri' literally translates to 'manslayer.'"}

He is encountered in the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Chasm%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Chasm of the Abyss&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is possible to summon the past version of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Great%20Gray%20Wolf%20Sif\"&gt;Great Gray Wolf Sif&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to aid in the battle. Sif's summon sign is found in the arena where the player fights Manus, inside the fog door.\nAppearance.\nManus appears to be a massive beast-like humanoid with a long spiked tail and multiple chaotic horns sprouting from his head and neck, covered with red-glowing eyes. His right arm holds a staff he uses to attacks and cast dark sorceries and his left arm is bigger and covered in fur with his hand being covered with teeth underneath his palm, capable of extending when attacking.\nPlot.\nOnce the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt; has the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Pendant\"&gt;Broken Pendant&lt;/a&gt; in their possession, Manus pulls them through a magical rift from &lt;a href=\"Darkroot%20Basin\"&gt;Darkroot Basin&lt;/a&gt; into the past land of &lt;a href=\"Oolacile\"&gt;Oolacile&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe has kidnapped &lt;a href=\"Dusk%20of%20Oolacile\"&gt;Princess Dusk&lt;/a&gt; and is eventually confronted in the &lt;a href=\"Chasm%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Chasm of the Abyss&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;.\nManus was a primordial human who possessed an extraordinary soul consisting of a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20Manus\"&gt;viscous, lukewarm lump of gentle humanity&lt;/a&gt;, an immense &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Soul\"&gt;Dark Soul&lt;/a&gt;. He was also a sorcerer who used a &lt;a href=\"Manus%20Catalyst\"&gt;rough and old wooden catalyst&lt;/a&gt;, very crude but large enough to be used as a weapon. His &lt;a href=\"Pursuers\"&gt;sorceries&lt;/a&gt; in particular were dark and in fact manipulated the Dark Soul, even managing to give it a will and throw it at enemies to chase them. Manus also possessed &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Pendant\"&gt;one half of an ancient stone pendant&lt;/a&gt; infused with powerful dark magic that was infinitely precious to him and represented a source of wrenching nostalgia and lost joy of a passed loved one. At some point in the distant past, Manus died and his body was buried in the caves of the region upon which the civilization of &lt;a href=\"Oolacile\"&gt;Oolacile&lt;/a&gt; would later arise.\nAt some point after &lt;a href=\"Gwyn\"&gt;Gwyn&lt;/a&gt; sacrificed himself to link the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Primordial%20Serpent\"&gt;Primordial Serpent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kaathe\"&gt;Kaathe&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Oolacile and manipulated the country to upturn the grave of the primordial man buried beneath the &lt;a href=\"Oolacile%20Township%20Dungeon\"&gt;dungeons&lt;/a&gt; of their city and resurrect him. In fact, Kaathe was looking for a potential &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Lord\"&gt;Dark Lord&lt;/a&gt; and after the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Kings\"&gt;Four Kings&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Darkwraith%20%28enemy%29\"&gt;Darkwraiths&lt;/a&gt;, to whom he had taught the powers of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Hand\"&gt;Lifedrain&lt;/a&gt;, had been sealed together with &lt;a href=\"New%20Londo%20Ruins\"&gt;New Londo&lt;/a&gt;he decided to find another path to achieve his goal.\nHowever, the royal family of Oolacile took the precious broken pendant of Manus for themselves, giving it to &lt;a href=\"Dusk%20of%20Oolacile\"&gt;Princess Dusk&lt;/a&gt;. The wrenching nostalgia connected to his object of obsession and the sincere hope to reclaim it drove Manus mad and his Dark Soul went wild, transforming him into a dark beast eternally seeking his pendant. His immense mass of humanity out of control led to the manifestation of an &lt;a href=\"Chasm%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt; that spread, threatening to devour the entire land. The Dark emanating from Manus did not limit itself to generating countless &lt;a href=\"Humanity%20Phantom\"&gt;Humanity Phantom&lt;/a&gt;s with a will of their own but also influenced the &lt;a href=\"Bloathead\"&gt;residents of Oolacile&lt;/a&gt;, making their humanity go wild and horribly mutating their bodies, bloating their head and opening them with cracks lined with innumerable tiny red eyeballs and protuding brain parts. On the brink of madness, Oolacile sorcerers would also discover &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Orb\"&gt;abyssal sorceries&lt;/a&gt; that are more weighty and deal physical damage instead of magical as their Dark Soul, used instead of normal souls, were closer to their natural state and produced sorceries with a more tangible presence and closer to matter.\nAs the Abyss continued to spread across the land of Oolacile, &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Artorias\"&gt;Knight Artorias&lt;/a&gt; came to stop it and confront Manus, as the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Knights%20of%20Gwyn\"&gt;Knight of Gwyn&lt;/a&gt; already had experience with fighting the Abyss and its creatures after the events of New Londo and his hunt for the Darkwraiths, and possessed a &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Pendant\"&gt;Silver Pendant&lt;/a&gt; that protected him from the Dark. Artorias, together with his trusted companion &lt;a href=\"Great%20Grey%20Wolf%20Sif\"&gt;Sif&lt;/a&gt;, thus faced Manus but his strength proved insufficient to defeat the Father of the Abyss and he succumbed to the Abyss. Wounded by the battle, Artorias used his &lt;a href=\"Cleansing%20Greatshield\"&gt;Cleansing Greatshield&lt;/a&gt; to form a barrier to protect Sif leaving a magic barrier to repel the Dark. Artorias, now corrupted to the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20Artorias\"&gt;Soul&lt;/a&gt; by the Abyss and with his &lt;a href=\"Set%20of%20Artorias\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; corroded, was left to fight alone and wounded the distorted creatures of Oolacile.\nAt one point Manus managed to take possession of his lost pendant, kidnapping Princess Dusk and taking her to his Abyss. However, due to a time distortion, Manus found himself chasing a further copy of his pendant, but this one was located in the future. Using his Dark power, Manus snatched the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt; that found it from the future bringing him to the Oolacile of the past. This Undead would be able to put the corrupted Artorias to rest and succeed his mission, facing Manus and defeating him, thus saving Oolacile from further corruption. After the Undead rescued Princess Dusk, however, she found herself in the future together with her pendant, thus creating the paradox that led to her salvation at the hands of that same Undead centuries later. Thanks to &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth\"&gt;Elizabeth&lt;/a&gt;'s confidentiality, the legend spread that Artorias had defeated Manus and his Abyss, omitting the role of the unsung hero to preserve the honor of the knight.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough he was killed, the Dark Soul of Manus was so large and powerful that he was reborn in death, and his soul split into miniscule fragments that retained some will. These pieces began to coalesce once again absorbing the other humanities, becoming the incarnations of different emotions of Manus and then human in shape, with their own self-awareness: &lt;a href=\"Elana%2C%20the%20Squalid%20Queen\"&gt;Elana&lt;/a&gt; the embodiment of Manus' wrath, &lt;a href=\"Alsanna%2C%20Silent%20Oracle\"&gt;Alsanna&lt;/a&gt;, the embodiment of Manus' fear, &lt;a href=\"Nadalia%2C%20Bride%20of%20Ash\"&gt;Nadalia&lt;/a&gt; the embodiment of Manus' solitude and &lt;a href=\"Nashandra\"&gt;Nashandra&lt;/a&gt;, the tiniest fragment of Manus and the embodiment of his want. These new entities had some recollection of their father and his dark powers and when the Abyss that they called home was dissipated they scattered across the land. To sustain themselves and seek more and more power, they reached &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; where in one way or another they came into contact with the holders of magnificent souls, drawn to their awesome strength.\nStrategies.\nIt is possible for the player to kill Manus outside his fog gate:\nIf the player wishes to face Manus conventionally, it is advisable to equip &lt;a href=\"Stamina\"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt;-boosting items that such as the &lt;a href=\"Cloranthy%20Ring\"&gt;Cloranthy Ring&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a high-&lt;a href=\"Stability\"&gt;Stability&lt;/a&gt; shield that blocks &lt;a href=\"Physical%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;physical damage&lt;/a&gt;. Only attack Manus after he finishes his &lt;a href=\"%23High%20Jump%20Slam\"&gt;jumping smash&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"%23Berserk%20Combo\"&gt;frenzy combo&lt;/a&gt;, lest you be caught in the middle of his strikes.\nManus will start using his magic attacks at around 50% health. Use the Silver Pendant to deflect them, as they are difficult to dodge.\nNotes.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Pendant\"&gt;Silver Pendant&lt;/a&gt;, although not required, can be of great help as it blocks his magic attacks if used with correct timing.\n&lt;a href=\"Great%20Grey%20Wolf%20Sif\"&gt;Great Grey Wolf Sif&lt;/a&gt; can help in this battle. Whilst Sif's attacks are not very damaging, the extra summon can keep Manus distracted and give the player time to heal. It is wise to only summon Sif after Manus is below half health, to distract him in his harder phase, making it less likely the player will be targeted by the Dark Orb barrage attack.\nSif's summon sign is\u00a0\"inside\" the Manus's arena, directly to the left of where the player spawns. As a result, Sif can only be summoned\u00a0\"during\" the fight. Thankfully, Sif is summoned instantly after touching the sign, without the usual white phantom-summoning animation. Since it is summoned during the fight it does not increase Manus' Hp.\nBoss information.\nAttacks.\nLong Arm Slam.\nManus briefly holds up his shadowy limb then brings it down at the player. This attack can reach more than halfway across the boss arena and breaks the guard of most medium-stability shields, dealing moderate damage to the player. It can be dodged by rolling in any direction during its downswing. This attack is telegraphed by rapid movement along his shadowy limb.\nBack Swipe.\nIf the player is behind Manus, he can twist his arm all the way around to defend his back.\nCatalyst Smash.\nManus quickly strikes the ground with his catalyst, dealing moderate damage. Often followed by a Short Arm Slam.\nHigh Jump Slam.\nManus jumps high above the player, then slams down with his catalyst and hand. This causes the player to lose their target lock afterwards.\nBerserk Combo.\nManus lets out a quick scream which makes him mad, then performs four swipes and two downward smashes, potentially hitting the player six times. This deals high damage, and drains a lot of stamina if blocked.\nDark Orb Barrage.\nManus uses his &lt;a href=\"Manus%20Catalyst\"&gt;Catalyst&lt;/a&gt; to cast a barrage of Dark Orbs, similar to the sorcery Dark Bead. The Dark Orbs spread out in a fan shape, making it easier to evade by strafing/rolling at close range. The Dark Orbs also drop to the ground after a moment, limiting the range of this spell.\nManus telegraphs this attack by holding his Catalyst out to his left, charging it for a moment, then swinging it towards the player to release the Dark Orbs. This attack can break the guards of most shields, so try blocking it with the Silver Pendant.\nAbyss Rain.\nManus casts a dark sorcery where multiple Dark Orbs appear in the air above and rain down around him in a sizable area of effect. Each Dark Orb can home in on the player within a certain range. The player can use their invulnerability frames from &lt;a href=\"Rolling\"&gt;fast rolling&lt;/a&gt; (12 invulnerability frames, 14 with the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wood%20Grain%20Ring\"&gt;Dark Wood Grain Ring&lt;/a&gt;). Alternatively, use the Silver Pendant \u2014 it does not stop the Dark Orbs, but holds them in place above the player if you remain still, letting you roll away before the Silver Pendant wears off.\nAbyss Cage.\nDark Orbs propagate from above Manus, surrounding the entire arena before homing back in on Manus. This attack covers the entire arena, except for the area right next to Manus, like an inverted AoE. Dodge it by getting as close as possible to Manus once he starts casting. The Silver Pendant can also block this attack.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls \u2014 Manus, Father of the Abyss by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2BEeW5W-1A&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

This makes him a very convenient stop for stocking up on items for the nearby &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Stoicism\"&gt;Battle of Stoicism&lt;/a&gt; arena.\nUnfortunately, he is also a dangerous and unscrupulous individual, invading the player in an attempt to kill them. Even after being defeated, Marvelous Chester will still sell items to the player, although with a more disgruntled tone as if the player interacting with him is mocking him after being defeated.\nLore.\nMarvelous Chester was dragged into the past by &lt;a href=\"Manus%2C%20Father%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Manus, Father of the Abyss&lt;/a&gt;. Little else is known about him. Given that his preferred weapon of choice is the &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Crossbow\"&gt;Sniper Crossbow&lt;/a&gt;, it is likely that Marvelous Chester is from &lt;a href=\"Carim\"&gt;Carim&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nMarvelous Chester is dangerous at mid-range, as his bolts and his throwing knives can quickly rack up damage. In particular, his special throwing knives, which he throws in threes, greatly build up &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt;. At long range, he is capable of firing multiple bolts at the player in quick succession, possibly dealing heavy consecutive damage. At close range, he performs sweeping low kicks that do a fair amount of damage and &lt;a href=\"stamina\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; drain. Marvelous Chester also has an unusually high amount of HP for an NPC."}

For example, normally reaching &lt;a href=\"Blighttown\"&gt;Blighttown&lt;/a&gt; would require trekking through the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Burg\"&gt;Undead Burg&lt;/a&gt;, killing the &lt;a href=\"Bell%20Gargoyles\"&gt;Bell Gargoyles&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Parish\"&gt;Undead Parish&lt;/a&gt;, then fighting through the Lower Undead Burg, then the &lt;a href=\"Depths\"&gt;Depths&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Gaping%20Dragon\"&gt;Gaping Dragon&lt;/a&gt;; with the Master key, the player can simply take the shortcut through the elevator to the &lt;a href=\"New%20Londo%20Ruins\"&gt;New Londo Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Drakes\"&gt;Valley of Drakes&lt;/a&gt;, and then Blighttown.\nThe implications of such activities are important. For example, accessing Blighttown early also means reaching advanced &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;pyromancies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, granting players disproportionately high firepower for their level. This can be a problem for starting players because they may run into high-level areas when they are not ready.\nPlayers that did not take the Master Key as a starting gift can acquire it later from Domhnall of Zena after ringing both &lt;a href=\"Bells%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Bells of Awakening&lt;/a&gt;. However, at this point, the Master Key has mostly lost its usefulness, as the player will likely have already opened the majority of the doors the Master Key can open.

Maybe you want some heavy chest armor for the superior defensive properties, and then you may want to have a medium helm, just to be defensive but not increase your load in weight, and then maybe have some light hand and foot armor, to counteract the weight, and keeping your load to a minimum, while still getting a small defensive property."}

{"id": "34402", "revid": "51254358", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=34402", "title": "Melfia", "text": "Melfia (\u30e1\u30eb\u30f4\u30a3\u30a2) is a \u00a0in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nLore.\nThe country of Melfia is located to the south of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt;.\nMelfia was founded by several sorcerers from the region of Drangleic, in particular from the lost kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Olaphis\"&gt;Olaphis&lt;/a&gt;. With his kingdom plagued by the curse of undeath that was rapidly spreading across his land, the king of Olaphis became wracked with fear and suspicion and began to see the progenitor of curse in anything and everything, each of his subjects as a carrier of the blight. In a foolish attemp to keep the undead out of sight, the king swept them up and locked them in droves inside the &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Bastille\"&gt;Bastille&lt;/a&gt;, that was then turned into a prison. Now paranoid and aware of his own frailty, the king seized anybody that he perceived as a threat and he found undesirable, cursed or no, and impounded them in the prison fortress. Sorcerers in particular suffered dreadful persecution and among them even the incredibly skilled and famous &lt;a href=\"Straid%20of%20Olaphis\"&gt;Straid of Olaphis&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned. As the prison of the Bastille reached the point of being saturated with undead, the king of Olaphis used the &lt;a href=\"Flexile%20Sentry\"&gt;Flexile Sentry&lt;/a&gt; golems to cram them into crude ships and sent them to the sea to certain death. Many sank with the ships, however a small number of survivors drifted to the south and settled down. Among them there were several sorcerers and therefore they imparted their knowledge to the new land where they ended up. &lt;a href=\"Olenford\"&gt;Olenford&lt;/a&gt; in particular became revered as the father of sorcery in the country that would became known by the name of Melfia.\nThe great Magic Academy for which the country became famous was thus founded in Melfia. The school became an institution that would collect, preserve, teach and develop knowledge about magic in different fields, mainly &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;sorcery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;pyromancy&lt;/a&gt;, through several academies. Magical schools devoted to the pursuit of knowledge grew and attracted important scholars and researchers, consequently leading Melfia to become a lush land with sorceries and pyromancies in which these arts thrived. Thanks to their researches, sorcerers and pyromancers of Melfia were even able to create new spells like &lt;a href=\"Shockwave\"&gt;Shockwave&lt;/a&gt; and rework ancient advanced sorceries like with &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Spear%20Barrage\"&gt;Soul Spear Barrage&lt;/a&gt;. Even pyromancies that were considered heretical in ancient times were taught but &lt;a href=\"Hexes\"&gt;dark sorcery&lt;/a&gt; remained a firm taboo and those that choose to study this type of magic were admonished and distanced by every other sorcerer. While a great knowledge of the past of magic has been achieved by Melfia, its history remain largely unknown and many arts were lost over the ages. An unspecified \"&lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;great white being&lt;/a&gt;\" is correctly remembered as the founder of sorcery but they have no way of knowing if such claims are true. The Academy also knows that before pyromancy there were the more primordial fire sorceries but they were long forgotten alongside their &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, not even them, like in the rest of the entire Drangleic region remember the name of &lt;a href=\"Big%20Hat%20Logan\"&gt;Big Hat Logan&lt;/a&gt;, the great sorcerer master, that was lost in time. The very history of the Magic Academy of Melfia has become confused as, during the centuries that it has existed, the details of its establishment have become unclear due to the fact that it has suffered from repeated scattering and gatherings of its faculties.\nSorcerers at the Academy attempted to alter the state of &lt;a href=\"titanite\"&gt;titanite&lt;/a&gt; to imbue it with &lt;a href=\"elements\"&gt;elements&lt;/a&gt;, but were said to fail. Despite this claim, at some point someone must have succeeded, because of the appearance of various types of valuable elemental titanite stones imbued with powers such as &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20Stone\"&gt;bleed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Stone\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darknight%20Stone\"&gt;dark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Firedrake%20Stone\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boltstone\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Faintstone\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, or even &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Stone\"&gt;enchanted titanites&lt;/a&gt; that were able to convert the intelligence of the user directly into physical damage. The Academy of Melfia was also dedicated to the study of the celestial bodies and &lt;a href=\"Astrologist\"&gt;Astrologist&lt;/a&gt;s thought that there were rules for the movements of the sun, moon and stars and that magic power could be obtained from their alignments. Even with multiple researchers and years of study, however, they were unable to acquire sorcery from the sky but from their ideas and study processes led to the creation of new and useful magic devices. The Academy of Melfia also learned how to infuse different magic and soul powers into crystals, creating quartz rings that were bestowed upon students that reached a certain level in their studies to increase their defense from magic, fire, dark or lightning. At one point the Pyromancer Glocken began to craft replicas of these rings causing much dismay from the conservative, old guard faculty of the school and his fellow magicians scolded him for underming the lessons gained from harsh training. Despite this, Glocken continued to craft many rings, so much that they became widespread and known for having saved the lives of many travelers, while also making him very rich.\nThe country of Melfia is not only dedicated to the search for magic for the pure interest of knowledge and in fact the sorceries developed by the Academy are used by the magic warriors who defend their land with &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28element%29\"&gt;sorceries&lt;/a&gt;. One of these spells is capable of creating a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Greatsword\"&gt;greatsword with souls&lt;/a&gt; making the use of the sorcery not dissimilar to swordplay and thus making it popular with the magic warriors of Melfia, while other spells instead &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Weapon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;imbue the weapon with magic&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the advantage represented by the advanced spells at Melfia's disposal, wielding a sword and casting a sorcery are still considered two different things and the old purists of the Magic Academy view these fighting spells as impure and swordplay as a barbaric form of engagement. The prejudices of some, however, did not stop some warriors of Melfia from using twinblades that were also able to double as catalysts for sorceries thanks to their honed skills in both staves and swords.\nAlthough the Magic Academy is supposed to be an institution devoted to the pursuit of truth, &lt;a href=\"Carhillion%20of%20the%20Fold\"&gt;Carhillion&lt;/a&gt;, a renowned sorcerer, came to perceive the scholars as uninterested in truth, paltry of ambitions and more engaged in petty squabbles, making it the academies a terrible place to learn magic. The stubborness of the Magic Academy in certain subjects can in fact be highlighted by how the institution persists in denying the very existence of &lt;a href=\"Gwynevere%2C%20Princess%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Gwynevere&lt;/a&gt;, despite the presence of several of her &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Blessing%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;relics containing the water blessed by the goddess&lt;/a&gt;, thus distorting the search for the truth. Their research based on logic and the secular mentality of the Melfia school's scholars thus led them to deny the existence of holy magic, thus explaining how forms of magic based on faith like &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt; are not studied at the Magical Academy."}

This can be tricky, due to the small size of her tail and her insubstantial health.\u00a0Players will need to deal 395 damage to her tail in order to cut it. If aggroed, players can break her invisibility using an unupgraded weapon that deals high &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; damage, then switch back to something upgraded to chop the tail. It is also possible to obtain the dagger before the battle properly starts, by attacking her tail with a strong downward attack using a high damage per hit weapon. Utilizing &lt;a href=\"Power%20Within\"&gt;Power Within&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Augmentation\"&gt;Weapon Buffs&lt;/a&gt; will help take her tail off in a single strike. \nCharacteristics.\nPriscilla's Dagger's damage is unremarkable, and has a lower &lt;a href=\"critical%20attack\"&gt;critical attack&lt;/a&gt; modifier than other daggers. This Dagger builds up bleed at the lowest possible rate of 20 per strike, though when procced it will take 50% of a target's max health; tied only with the &lt;a href=\"Lifehunt%20Scythe\"&gt;Lifehunt Scythe&lt;/a&gt;. However, Lifehunt Scythe deals the highest build up per strike but also builds up bleed on it's wielder while Priscilla's Dagger will not. This weapon is best used in conjunction with another weapon that deals better bleed build up per strike, using this dagger on the final strike to proc bleed will do the entire 50% damage to the target. \nPriscilla's Dagger is an &lt;a href=\"Occult%20%28auxiliary%20effect%29\"&gt;Occult&lt;/a&gt; weapon but no Faith scaling, though the Occult auxiliary effect does not make it incredibly useful toward God type enemies and their followers. \nPriscilla's Dagger has a unique &lt;a href=\"moveset\"&gt;moveset&lt;/a&gt;. While its\u00a0weak attacks are the same as other daggers, its\u00a0strong attacks\u00a0are a graceful, flowing combo that is difficult to master.\nPriscilla's Dagger is uncharacteristically fragile for a &lt;a href=\"dragon%20weapon\"&gt;Dragon Weapon&lt;/a&gt;, having only 100 durability, the lowest of all dragon weapons. This may be due to lacking the shockwave attack typically associated to dragon weapons.\nDescription.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Official translation=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The colors are purple, red, yellow, green, white, light blue, blue, and pink.\nOverview.\nPrism Stones are a useful utility item in many ways. In addition to their usefulness in gauging falling safety, they can serve as path markers or reminders, and can help prevent new players from getting lost. They are also useful in making sure that the path ahead is safe. This is particularly useful in the darkness of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Tomb of the Giants&lt;/a&gt;, and on the invisible walkways of the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Cave\"&gt;Crystal Cave&lt;/a&gt;."}

Known colors include: blue, green, purple, yellow, white and orange. What color a dropped stone will become is random and cannot be chosen.\nThey can also be dropped from ledges or cliffs in order to judge whether the player will survive a fall or not.

However, it is the only chest piece in the game that raises item discovery. Due to this effect, it can be considered a high risk, high reward item that can be used to optimize item discovery for farming purposes at the cost of taking significantly more damage.\nDue to the significant loss of defence, farming difficult enemies may be faster in the long term to use a conventional chest piece instead of the Prisoner's Tatters, due to reduced risk of deaths wasting time and the ability to fight more recklessly for faster farming runs."}

It is a subsection of the &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20Dungeon\"&gt;Irithyll Dungeon&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe Profaned Capital is a highly decimated ruin that has somehow sunken into a great chasm, the only natural light pouring from a crack in the cavernous walls. Very little of what was once a proud civilization remains, making this area quite small. The state of the Capital is in such disarray that the only things remaining are a few bridges and tunnels, a vestige of a great tower, a church sunken in a swamp, and the throne room of &lt;a href=\"Yhorm%20the%20Giant\"&gt;Yhorm the Giant&lt;/a&gt;. The rest of what was once a prosperous realm has long since corroded away. An overlook of the Capital is viewable from Irithyll Dungeon.\nOne of two bonfires is within the central tower, its interior hollowed out, but its heights traversable thanks to numerous ladders up and down its interior and exterior. The source of the ladders is no mystery, as the corpse of &lt;a href=\"Laddersmith%20Gilligan\"&gt;Laddersmith Gilligan&lt;/a&gt; can be seen splayed out right by the bonfire, where the player can learn a gesture.\nOff to the side is a network of tunnels with multiple holes in the floor, opening up to a caverous, filthy swamp that inflicts Toxic instead of Poison and is occupied by &lt;a href=\"Sewer%20Centipede\"&gt;Sewer Centipedes&lt;/a&gt;. An old church in visible disarray is half-sunken in the swamp, populated by &lt;a href=\"Monstrosity%20of%20Sin\"&gt;grotesque hand-headed creatures&lt;/a&gt;. A path by the church leads back to Irithyll Dungeon, where one can access otherwise-blocked cells.\nOn the other side of the chasm and across a half-decimated bridge is a great and ornate fa\u00e7ade, flanked by inactive gargoyles. Handmaids surround a golden brazier that perpetually burns, perhaps being the Profaned Flame itself. The entrance is flanked by two antechambers filled with more handmaids, the left one also accessible by the previously-mentioned bridge. Scattered across the whole floor are artifacts of gold and silver, as well as piles of charred, half-melted bodies. Straight ahead is the chamber of Yhorm himself.\nLore.\nThe Profaned Capital was ruled over by Yhorm the Giant, descendant of an ancient conqueror, who was nevertheless asked by the previously subjugated people to lead them. A sorcery school was established there, one of two leading schools claiming to be heir to the legacy of &lt;a href=\"Big%20Hat%20Logan\"&gt;Big Hat Logan&lt;/a&gt;. The court sorcerers from the Profaned Capital also served as oracles, as golden stitching of their robes suggest. Although they were undeniably intelligent and adept in their craft, it is possible that they did not follow Big Hat Logan as much as they claimed to.\nAs a result of a curse shared between &lt;a href=\"Monstrosity%20of%20Sin\"&gt;a group of women&lt;/a&gt;, the everlasting Profaned Flame was triggered. Despite their culpability, the women went on living carelessly, although they then turned into &lt;a href=\"Monstrosity%20of%20Sin\"&gt;malformed creatures&lt;/a&gt;.. After Yhorm became a Lord of Cinder in order to stop the Profaned Flame, the city was burned down by fire said to be coming from the sky. It consumed only humans.\nPart of the flame is preserved in icy skull, found in &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20Dungeon\"&gt;Irithyll Dungeon&lt;/a&gt;. It serves as a prison, in which guards are &lt;a href=\"Jailer\"&gt;Jailer&lt;/a&gt;s, survivors from the Profaned Capital. &lt;a href=\"Jailer%20Handmaid\"&gt;Handmaids&lt;/a&gt; serving in the Capital reportedly took pleasure in hurting others. Both Jailers and Handmaids are survivors of the Profaned Capitol, wield fiery attacks, and enjoy inflicting pain on others, signifying that the Profaned Flame not only has physical effect, but psychological ones. &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle\"&gt;Gargoyle&lt;/a&gt;s wielding either &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20Flame%20Spear\"&gt;spears&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20Flame%20Hammer\"&gt;hammers&lt;/a&gt; (into which the Profaned Flame is imbued) are encountered throughout the Profaned Capital. It is not known if they appeared before or after the city was ruined.\nSometime after the Profaned Flame destroyed the Capital, &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Sulyvahn\"&gt;Pontiff Sulyvahn&lt;/a&gt; discovered the Profaned Flame and the Capital, \"a burning ambition took root within him\". He would later infuse the Profaned Flame within his own &lt;a href=\"Profaned%20Greatsword\"&gt;greatsword&lt;/a&gt;, and would perhaps introduce the Profaned Flame to the Fire Witches, leading to their hearts being consumed by it. They would learn to use its power and summon firestorms with their halberds., and would eventually take Irithyll for themselves. \nBonfires.\nThe Profaned Capital is a subsection of the &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20Dungeon\"&gt;Irithyll Dungeon&lt;/a&gt; and comprises the following &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfires&lt;/a&gt;:"}

This Fire damage can be quite useful against enemies that are weak to the element, such as &lt;a href=\"Pus%20of%20Man\"&gt;Pus of Man&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Grub\"&gt;Corpse Grub&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOnline gameplay.\nThis skill works exactly the same as the &lt;a href=\"Stomp%20%28upward%29\"&gt;upward Stomp&lt;/a&gt;, only with the addition of buffing the weapon prior to performing the upward slash. As such, it can be used in the same way as Stomp, to trade with opponents and deal immense damage to them while disabling them. The increased Fire damage from the buff can then be used to further gain an advantage over opponents in combat."}

Initially, one Prowler will invade the player, but once they proceed to the staircase, four more will spawn in and engage in combat. All five Prowlers must be defeated in order to banish the invader.\nStrategy.\nUpon stepping out of the lift, the first Prowler will spawn next to a nearby &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Idol\"&gt;Ashen Idol&lt;/a&gt; positioned in plain sight. This idol heals enemies in a similar fashion to &lt;a href=\"Warmth\"&gt;Warmth&lt;/a&gt;. The player may fight the Prowler in front of the idol, concentrating in dealing consecutive attacks to compensate for the constant healing it provides. Another method is to simply lure the Prowler back to where the lift is, out of the reach of the idol's healing powers, and confront him there. When the Prowler has sustained enough damage, however, he will retreat back to where the idol is to replenish his health. Once defeated, the player is advised to deactivate the idol with the use of a &lt;a href=\"Smelter%20Wedge\"&gt;Smelter Wedge&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs soon as the player steps on the nearby staircase, four more Prowlers will spawn. All of them will already be hostile and come rushing after the player, even they haven't seen them yet. It's not advisable to take on all of them at once, or they will pummel the player with arrows and melee attacks which cause &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt; build-up. A good strategy consists in simply running back to the lift (wearing the &lt;a href=\"Silvercat%20Ring\"&gt;Silvercat Ring&lt;/a&gt; is recommended to avoid falling damage if the lift is too far away) and simply stay on it until all of them lose interest. Then approach the staircase slowly and draw them in one by one by using a ranged attack. These four Prowlers have significantly less health and stamina than the first one, and their attacks frequently leave them open for &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;s or normal combos.\nEach of them uses an\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt;, so\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Lloyd%27s%20Talisman%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Lloyd's Talismans&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0are very useful for fighting them.\u00a0"}

The Congregation is made up of diverse types of hollows. Upon traversing the fog wall, the hollows are initially seen prostrating before the Magus. The Magus has his own health bar, but the health bar of the Congregation counts for all of the\u00a0hollows.\nPlot.\nThe Magus was an evil warlock hailing from &lt;a href=\"Aldia%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Aldia's Keep&lt;/a&gt; who partook in forbidden rituals, infecting its body and mind with &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;dark magic&lt;/a&gt;. The Magus leads a small congregation of &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;Hollow&lt;/a&gt;s within a chapel, the remnants of Brightstone Cove Tseldora's ravaged population since the infestation of &lt;a href=\"Parasite%20Spider\"&gt;spiders&lt;/a&gt;. The hollows act as puppets to the Magus' will, and may be under the influence of the warlock's dark powers.\nSummoning.\n&lt;a href=\"Benhart%20of%20Jugo\"&gt;Benhart of Jugo&lt;/a&gt; can be summoned for this fight. His summon sign is at the &lt;a href=\"Brightstone%20Cove%20Tseldora%23Bonfires\"&gt;Royal Army Campsite&lt;/a&gt; bonfire in Brightstone Cove, in the tent closest to the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Peasant\"&gt;Undead Peasant&lt;/a&gt; that is amongst four bodies with loot.\nStrategies.\nThe difficulty of this boss does not come from the boss itself, but rather the number of enemies. Killing the &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Priest\"&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt; first is advised, as they can\u00a0heal surrounding enemies and\u00a0cast very strong &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Miracles%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0By using &lt;a href=\"Profound%20Still\"&gt;Profound Still&lt;/a&gt;, one can make both the priests and the Magus unable to cast magic, which makes them considerably weaker for the duration of the battle.\nThere are two variants of hollows: &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Laborer\"&gt;Undead Laborer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Supplicant\"&gt;Undead Supplicant&lt;/a&gt;s. The laborers are faster and can surround the player with ease, while the supplicants will often be hindered by the benches placed around the area and won't pose any serious threat other than the occasional attack or hindering the player's movement. Any large sweeping attacks or spells with an area-of-effect are effective; for example, the &lt;a href=\"Halberd%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Halberd&lt;/a&gt;'s running attack (be wary of its &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;, as hitting multiple enemies at once will degrade weapons quickly) or the &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Storm%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Chaos Storm&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0pyromancy.\u00a0A well-placed shot of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Soul%20Appease\"&gt;Soul Appease&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0can also deal with most of the Congregation in one attack.\nThe Prowling Magus himself uses hexes which can deal a lot of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; damage if they connect. However, he doesn't have much health and most of his attacks are fairly easy to dodge.\nHiding behind the benches is a good way to block the priests' lightning spear attacks and provides time to heal. However, any attacks connecting with the benches will destroy them.\nDefenses.\n&lt;a href=\"Prowling%20Magus\"&gt;Prowling Magus&lt;/a&gt;.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Priest\"&gt;Hollow Priest&lt;/a&gt;s x 2.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense. -35% slash means taking 135% damage.\n&lt;a href=\"Undead%20Laborer\"&gt;Undead Laborer&lt;/a&gt;s x 5.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense. -35% slash means taking 135% damage.\n&lt;a href=\"Undead%20Supplicant\"&gt;Undead Supplicant&lt;/a&gt;s x 3.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)"}

Transitioning into the strong attack will result in a strong downward strike.\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nThis skill is generally quite useful against shield-carrying enemies, as the initial chain has good forward momentum and can be initiated quite quickly. It also inflicts high &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt; damage, and is capable of inflicting an impressive amount of stagger even on foes with standing poise such as &lt;a href=\"Darkwraith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Darkwraiths&lt;/a&gt;, so it can be useful even against foes without shields.\nDue to the high stamina damage, the first two slashes are very useful for breaking down shields, and can either inflict bonus &lt;a href=\"Instability\"&gt;Instability&lt;/a&gt; damage with the second attack of the chain, or result in a guard break and leave the foe open for a riposte.\nOnline gameplay.\nThis skill is particularly useful against players who rely on shields for defense, moreso due to the the attack's strong forward momentum, which allows the wielder to quickly close the distance to their target. While the effect is comparable to the guard break of &lt;a href=\"Stance%20%28Straight%20Sword%29\"&gt;Stance&lt;/a&gt;, it is considerably more powerful due to the double attack of the chain and the forward charge. In this regard, it is also much more useful than a kick, which is much shorter ranged and slower.\nHowever, what makes this skill truly shine is that the strong attack strike can be delayed for a considerable amount of time after the initial chain is complete, and possesses &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt; frames which allows it to be used for trades against smaller weapons. As it comes down with a relatively short delay, the strong attack can be used to roll-catch players who attempt to dodge immediately after being hit by the chain. As well, the strong attack can be used as the final guard-breaking hit on particularly strong shields, if the shield manages to survive the first two strikes.\nThe strong guard-breaking ability of this skill means that it may behoove the player to equip the &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Slayer%27s%20Ring\"&gt;Knight Slayer's Ring&lt;/a&gt; in order to further augment its stamina damage to lethal levels."}

Pressing the strong or weak attack button takes out an &lt;a href=\"Ammunition%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; of the selected variety, nocks it, draws it back and then releases it after a short delay. This skill cannot be cancelled once begun.\nAn arrow fired using this skill will inflict 25% more damage upon striking a target. If hitting a target with a raised shield, a percentage of the damage will pierce the shield, depending on the size of the arrow fired.\nConsumes 9 &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt; per arrow fired, or 7 FP with the &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Ring\"&gt;Farron Ring&lt;/a&gt; equipped.\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nGiven the luxury of time and place of choosing, this skill allows players to maximize the damage inflicted with each individual arrow. Further augmenting the strength of each attack with equipment such as the &lt;a href=\"Hawk%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Hawk Ring&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"Lloyd%27s%20Sword%20Ring\"&gt;Lloyd's Sword Ring&lt;/a&gt; can amplify the damage of each attack to the point of making the bow a damage-dealer in its own right. The FP cost of this skill can be recouped via various methods, ranging from a &lt;a href=\"Simple%20Gem\"&gt;Simple&lt;/a&gt;-infused off-hand tool to an &lt;a href=\"Executioner%27s%20Greatsword\"&gt;Executioner's Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnline gameplay.\nWhile ideal for combining with the &lt;a href=\"Obscuring%20Ring\"&gt;Obscuring Ring&lt;/a&gt; to deliver high-damage harassment to an opponent from range, this skill can also find use in chipping down opponents who hide behind 100% physical block shields. The fraction of damage that chips through shields is greater than that of a &lt;a href=\"Greatbows%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;greatbow&lt;/a&gt; firing greatarrows using the &lt;a href=\"Puncturing%20Arrow\"&gt;Puncturing Arrow&lt;/a&gt; skill, making it useful for inflicting actual meaningful damage against defensive foes, even those who wield titans like &lt;a href=\"Havel%27s%20Greatshield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Havel's Greatshield&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is exclusive to &lt;a href=\"Greatbows%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;greatbows&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe wielder readies the greatbow, entering a prepared firing stance and holding steady; moving will cancel this stance. The player can then nock the greatarrow of their choice and release it when ready. The arrow will gain increased travel distance (and with it damage fall-off) and inflict 12% more damage, and will penetrate any enemies it hits, allowing it to damage multiple foes with a single shot.\nIf used without the required &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt;, the arrows will deal less damage than regular shots and inflict reduced knockback but will still penetrate.\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nAs the skill requires the player to stand still prior to even readying an arrow, it can be difficult to use against mobile targets. However, the increased damage and penetrating nature of the shot makes it extremely useful for dealing with crowds of enemies, particularly if they can be funneled through a single approach, such as down a narrow hallway.\nOnline.\nOther players will generally not stand around waiting to be shot with a greatbow, and can easily dodge the shots that they can see coming, so the primary use of this skill is through ambushes with the &lt;a href=\"Obscuring%20Ring\"&gt;Obscuring Ring&lt;/a&gt;. This skill allows invaders to get a powerful first strike in on unwary hosts and summoned phantoms, helping to narrow their Estus advantage before properly engaging them. Keep in mind that it is incapable of dealing significant damage through raised shields, so against wary parties it may be useful to try to strike them from the sides or behind."}

The riddle itself is located near the &lt;a href=\"The_Ringed_City_%28location%29%23Bonfires\"&gt;Ringed City Streets bonfire&lt;/a&gt;, in the section unlocked as a shortcut. The solution consists in transforming oneself into a &lt;a href=\"Humanity%20Phantom\"&gt;Humanity Phantom&lt;/a&gt; (through the use of the &lt;a href=\"Chameleon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Chameleon&lt;/a&gt; sorcery or a &lt;a href=\"Young%20White%20Branch\"&gt;Young White Branch&lt;/a&gt;) (can only be done while standing in the water) and approach the entrance to this area. Doing so will trigger a ladder to descend, granting access.\nInside, two &lt;a href=\"Ringed%20Knight\"&gt;Ringed Knight&lt;/a&gt;s and one &lt;a href=\"Judicator%20Giant\"&gt;Judicator Giant&lt;/a&gt; can be encountered. Near the giant are stairs going down. Once at the bottom of the stairs, fall on the right and cross the bridge to get to the monument.\nServices.\nThe Purging Monument provides a number of services to the player depending on their current status in a similar way as &lt;a href=\"Velka%2C%20the%20Goddess%20of%20Sin\"&gt;Velka&lt;/a&gt;'s statue does in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Undead Settlement&lt;/a&gt;:\nQuestline.\n&lt;a href=\"Amnesiac%20Lapp\"&gt;Amnesiac Lapp&lt;/a&gt; makes the first mention of this monument's existence and tells the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20One\"&gt;Ashen One&lt;/a&gt; how he has been running in circles searching for it throughout the swamp without success, his intentions being to cure himself from his &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;Hollow&lt;/a&gt;ing in the hopes of regaining his memory, who he was, and what was his real name in his past life.\nThe player can then embark on a mission of finding the monument and return to Lapp to inform him of its location, progressing with this through his questline."}

In this sense, Pursuers resemble &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Soulmass\"&gt;Homing Soulmass&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with projectiles that move more slowly but home in more aggressively, as well as fewer casts. Pursuers has a longer than average casting time.\nPursuers activate at a closer range than usual against opponents who wear the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Fog\"&gt;Ring of Fog&lt;/a&gt;. It will not activate at all against opponents that use &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Body\"&gt;Hidden Body&lt;/a&gt;. Using the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Pendant\"&gt;Silver Pendant&lt;/a&gt; while pursuers are cast but not launched cause the pursuers to be blown away from the player and become active, automatically homing in on nearby enemies without needing to automatically activate. Using the Silver Pendant against an opponent's Pursuers will temporarily block them but not destroy them, caution is advised as the Pursuers may return and hit the player.\nThe amount of possible orbs generated is always five. If orbs make contact with a physical object before meeting an enemy, they fizzle out without dealing damage. Orbs that make contact with the enemy without activating will deal very minor damage to the opponent. The orbs will also disappear if they have not been activated for more than a minute after casting.\nEach pursuer, when activated, has a magic attack power of 1.3 times the catalyst's magic adjust and 120 base physical attack, which is affected by your catalyst's &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; scaling.\nDescription.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Official translation=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Upon detecting the player, they are consumed by a mass of black tentacles and transform into horrific abominations. They gain a massive claw like appendage and a new red-eyed serpentine head (something that resembles both &lt;a href=\"Manus%2C%20Father%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Manus&lt;/a&gt; and the Primordial Serpents) grows from their back, the infected hollow\u2019s body is visible among the corruption. The Pus of Man in the &lt;a href=\"Consumed%20King%27s%20Garden\"&gt;Consumed King's Garden&lt;/a&gt; are already transformed when the player encounters them.\nWhilst the majority of Pus of Man are infected Hollows, there are exceptions. &lt;a href=\"Iudex%20Gundyr\"&gt;Iudex Gundyr&lt;/a&gt; will transform halfway through the boss fight and the twin &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Wyvern\"&gt;wyverns&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;Lothric Castle&lt;/a&gt; will transform once they have been slain. The version inside the wyverns is unable to move and can spit poison from a distance that causes &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;curse&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\n&lt;a href=\"High%20Wall%20of%20Lothric\"&gt;High Wall of Lothric&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Consumed%20King%27s%20Garden\"&gt;Consumed King's Garden&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;Lothric Castle&lt;/a&gt;\nLore.\nThe Pus of Man vaguely resemble serpents with twisting ivory horns protruding from their body at random intervals. Serpents are considered imperfect dragons and were at some point a symbol of the Undead. The dragon correlation would explain the presence of the horns, and the connection to the Undead might give a clue to the corruption's origins. The &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20Manus\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Manus%2C%20Father%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Manus&lt;/a&gt; was a \"viscous, lukewarm lump of gentle humanity\". When Manus' humanity went wild, he became a raving beast and began to emanate the Dark, giving birth to the &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt;. It's possible that the Pus of Man are humanities similarly gone wild.\nStrategy.\nPus of Man are very vulnerable to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage, which will cause them to writhe in agony for a few moments, giving the player time to attack or escape. Close ranged combat is risky but they have difficulty turning, so attacking them from behind is a good way to inflict damage, although they will attempt to re-position themselves if given the chance. Their destructive rampages often damage and outright kill surrounding enemies which can be effective if the player is surrounded and they are unable to climb ledges.\nUnless the player wishes to farm these enemies for their items (they often drop &lt;a href=\"Ember\"&gt;Ember&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Titanite%20Chunk%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Titanite Chunks&lt;/a&gt;), it is recommended to kill the infected Hollow before it can transform. The enemy will convulse and start emitting dark spores before it mutates, giving the player time to defeat or at least damage the creature before it can complete the transformation.\nDrops.\n&lt;tabber&gt;High Wall of Lothric =\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

It is decorated with several, almost golden spiral patterns, and appears to wear a sort of medallion. His flesh, colored black like the ancient &lt;a href=\"Humans\"&gt;Humans&lt;/a&gt;, has grown withered and frail. On top of his long white hair he dons a crown, similar in design to a mix between the &lt;a href=\"Firekeeper\"&gt;Firekeeper&lt;/a&gt; blindfold and the crown of &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn&lt;/a&gt;, though much smaller. His throat has been cut by &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Knight%20Gael\"&gt;Gael&lt;/a&gt;, leaving his inner neck exposed, and his head attached only at the back right of the neck. He is found crawling toward &lt;a href=\"Filianore\"&gt;Filianore&lt;/a&gt;'s chamber, and his legs have either been damaged by Gael or were useless to begin with or from age.\nLore.\nThis Pygmy King is one of the royalty within the &lt;a href=\"Ringed%20City%20%28location%29\"&gt;Ringed City&lt;/a&gt;, who directly inherited the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Soul\"&gt;Dark Soul&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and protected it within themselves, being descendants of the &lt;a href=\"Furtive%20Pygmy\"&gt;Furtive Pygmy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn&lt;/a&gt; gifted them the city as a sort of peace offering, as well as his daughter Filianore, who was put to sleep and used to preserve the city. While the rule has apparently been adequate, there was once a madman born into the royalty and &lt;a href=\"Shira%2C%20Knight%20of%20Filianore\"&gt;Shira, Knight of Filianore&lt;/a&gt; was required to put him down, testimony of how the gods continued to exercise their influence and control even in the city thanks to the &lt;a href=\"Spears%20of%20the%20Church\"&gt;Spears of the Church&lt;/a&gt;. Shira failed to kill him for good, of course, and thus remained inside a place where she and the spear would be held close until the end of time.\nBeing a more primordial race of humans, they were able to better resist the effects of aging thanks to the Dark Soul that kept them alive to the point that their very blood dried out. Gael devoured their blood and hence the Dark Soul with the goal of taking it to his &lt;a href=\"The%20Painter\"&gt;Lady&lt;/a&gt;, even though he was quite aware of the negative effects it would inflict, for he was not a champion. \nOne last survivor of Gael's massacre would make it to Filianore's remains even with his throat slashed by Gael; yet despite never seeing the princess' final state, he succumbs to his wounds and passes away, calling out her name in vain, demonstrating again how the culture and ideology of the gods of Anor Londo permeated and persisted among the pygmy nobility itself even in the very end."}

Pyromancers are also unique in that they start at Level 1, so they possess the advantage of being able to invade any person at the start, as well as keeping at the lowest level possible. These factors make the Pyromancer a good choice for PvP builds.\nThe Pyromancer has quite a few advantages early in the game, including the ability to combine reasonably strong melee attacks from the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20Axe\"&gt;Hand Axe&lt;/a&gt; with very potent &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; pyromancy. Their starting armor, while decrepit looking, actually has strong resistance to both Poison and Fire, which are common hazards in the early areas of the game.\nPyromancers do, however, start with the worst shield in the game, although it is still reasonably effective up until the point where a player can obtain a better one.\nThe basic pyromancy trainer, &lt;a href=\"Laurentius%20of%20the%20Great%20Swamp\"&gt;Laurentius of the Great Swamp&lt;/a&gt;, is one of the last trainers available to the player. Therefore, pyromancers have access to no pyromancies other than Fireball until this point, that is; without the &lt;a href=\"Master%20Key\"&gt;Master Key&lt;/a&gt; which allows anyone access to &lt;a href=\"Quelana%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Quelana of Izalith&lt;/a&gt; who teaches expert level pyromancies, and &lt;a href=\"Eingyi\"&gt;Eingyi&lt;/a&gt; who has a secret &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20Flame\"&gt;Pyromancy Flame&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20Mist%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;toxic spells&lt;/a&gt;.

The path to the tower is hidden behind an &lt;a href=\"Illusory%20Wall%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;illusory wall&lt;/a&gt; in the lower level of Ariandel Chapel basement.\nCharacteristics.\nThe Pyromancer's Parting Flame has slightly inferior &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt; compared to the standard &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20Flame%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Pyromancy Flame&lt;/a&gt;; however, it has a unique feature in that most offensive spells will be preluded by a variant of &lt;a href=\"Combustion%20%28skill%29\"&gt;Combustion&lt;/a&gt;, inflicting 0.8 times the catalyst's Attack Rating as &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage to targets that are at very close range. This means that should an offensive spell be cast at melee range, the target will be hit by the flame prior to taking damage from the spell itself, increasing the total damage dealt. As such, the Pyromancer's Parting Flame is optimal for close-range &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;pyromancies&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Black%20Flame%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Black Flame&lt;/a&gt;. However, due to the inferior &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Buff\"&gt;Spell Buff&lt;/a&gt; compared to the standard flame, it cannot deal as much damage with medium or long range pyromancies.\nSpells cast with the Parting Flame also have 15% increased stamina cost, regardless of whether or not they utilize the aforementioned feature. Naturally, this does not affect &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Surge%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire Surge&lt;/a&gt; due to the spell not having any stamina cost to begin with.\nIts primary defining feature is its &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Parting%20Flame\"&gt;Parting Flame&lt;/a&gt;, which allows for the replenishment of the player's &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt; by killing enemies, greatly increasing long-term survival, though its long cast time makes it far less effective when in the midst of combat.\nUpgrades.\n&lt;a href=\"Cornyx%20of%20the%20Great%20Swamp\"&gt;Cornyx of the Great Swamp&lt;/a&gt; can upgrade the Pyromancer's Parting Flame up to +10. This requires a total of 12 of each standard titanite (&lt;a href=\"Titanite%20Shard%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Shards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Large%20Titanite%20Shard%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Large Shards&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Titanite%20Chunk%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Chunks&lt;/a&gt;) as well as a single &lt;a href=\"Titanite%20Slab%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Slab&lt;/a&gt;. Fully upgrading the flame will also cost a total of 10,944 &lt;a href=\"Soul%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt;.\nGallery.\n&lt;br&gt;"}
{"id": "173161", "revid": "49243392", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=173161", "title": "Pyromancer (Dark Souls III)", "text": "The Pyromancer is one of the &lt;a href=\"Classes%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;classes&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%203\"&gt;Dark Souls 3&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIt is a class with high &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt;, making it suitable for builds based on &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Pyromancy&lt;/a&gt; or Dark Spells. It has the lowest &lt;a href=\"Luck\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt; of all classes, a trait shared with the &lt;a href=\"Knight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Knight&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Fireball%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; is a strong spell and benefits from the fact that many early enemies are vulnerable to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;, if a bit expensive and hard to aim due to it being thrown in an arc. The Pyromancer effectively still has two Pyromancies due to its casting tool, the &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20Flame%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Pyromancy Flame&lt;/a&gt;, having the classic pyromancy &lt;a href=\"Combustion%20%28skill%29\"&gt;Combustion&lt;/a&gt; as its &lt;a href=\"Skill\"&gt;Weapon Art&lt;/a&gt; for a melee range alternative. The &lt;a href=\"Great%20Swamp%20Ring\"&gt;Great Swamp Ring&lt;/a&gt; will boost the damage of Fireball by 12% but since Combustion is a Weapon Art it won't be boosted. \nSpeaking of, the &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20Flame%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Pyromancy Flame&lt;/a&gt; will be the only casting tool for Pyromancy for a while and while it scales with both Intelligence and Faith it still works relatively well with more investment in one stat over the other. There is however one complicating factor for the scaling: unless Intelligence is at least 22 (goes down to a minimum of 18 as the Pyromancy Flame is upgraded), certain spells (Fireball, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Orb%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire Orb&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Great%20Chaos%20Fire%20Orb\"&gt;Great Chaos Fire Orb&lt;/a&gt;) won't scale with the Faith part of the Flame and therefore end up doing greatly decreased damage on a Faith build with insufficient investment in Intelligence. When wielded in the right hand it has the peculiar function of working as a free, short range punch that deals fire damage, helping against enemies weak to fire like the ooze-like &lt;a href=\"Writhing%20Rotten%20Flesh\"&gt;Writhing Rotten Flesh&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Cathedral of the Deep&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Hand%20Axe%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Hand Axe&lt;/a&gt; is a surprisingly useful weapon. While it is pretty short, really only outranging &lt;a href=\"Daggers%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Daggers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Thrall%20Axe\"&gt;Thrall Axe&lt;/a&gt;, it is quick and deals decent damage for its size. Its &lt;a href=\"Skill\"&gt;Weapon Art&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Warcry\"&gt;Warcry&lt;/a&gt;, boosting weapon damage by 10% for 30 seconds and changing the heavy attack into a charge. While the charge is rather difficult to use for a Pyromancer in its default armor due to low &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; and the small size of the weapon itself, the damage boost is easy to use for foes resistant to Fire. \nA mediocre &lt;a href=\"Caduceus%20Round%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Caduceus Round Shield&lt;/a&gt; rounds out the equipment setup. While it is unsuitable for blocking anything but the occasional Magic attack, it is still a light &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Parry&lt;/a&gt; tool. Actually blocking attacks should be left to the physically sturdy shields such as the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Eagle%20Kite%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Silver Eagle Kite Shield&lt;/a&gt;. \nIts &lt;a href=\"Pyromancer%20Set\"&gt;Pyromancer Set&lt;/a&gt; has good elemental defences and &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt; resistances but bad physical defences. \nThe primary Pyromancy trainer is found early on, in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Undead Settlement&lt;/a&gt;."}

Upgrading a Pyromancy Flame can only be done through one of the formerly mentioned pyromancers, as well as\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Quelana%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Quelana of Izalith&lt;/a&gt;, who can ascend the flame further than Laurentius or Eingyi.\nUnlike &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Sorcery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Miracles&lt;/a&gt;, Pyromancies are unique in that they do not require a specific &lt;a href=\"Stats%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;stat&lt;/a&gt; level, or scale with any stat. Rather, players may upgrade their Pyromancy Flame 15 times at any pyromancy teacher, then ascend once and upgrade their Ascended Pyromancy flame another 5 times to increase their damage output. This means that players can use a high level Pyromancy Flame to deal high damage at low soul levels \u2013 making it useful for PvP. (Note, the Ascended Pyromancy Flame does not scale with intelligence, despite the item indicating such)\nUnfortunately, many pyromancies share the deficiency of having limited range and having a slow casting time. This means that in order to use pyromancies properly, players must plan ahead and predict enemy movements. It also makes pyromancies dangerous to use in close combat, especially against other players. However, the speed of casting pyromancies can be increased through investing in the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0attribute, the limit being 45 points in Dexterity before no further casting speed increases are given to the player, making pyromancies a far more viable choice for close range combat.\nLore.\nBefore the creation of Pyromancy, flame sorceries were used by the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Witch of Izalith&lt;/a&gt;, her Daughters of Chaos, and later by the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Demon%20Firesage\"&gt;Demon Firesage&lt;/a&gt;. The Witch and her daughters used flame sorcery to challenge the &lt;a href=\"Everlasting%20Dragons\"&gt;ancient dragons&lt;/a&gt;, casting it from &lt;a href=\"catalysts\"&gt;catalysts&lt;/a&gt; just as &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;soul sorceries&lt;/a&gt; were. In the wake of her failed attempt to recreate the First Flame, the Witch of Izalith and some of her daughters were engulfed in the newly formed\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;. This also resulted in the birth of Pyromancy and all knowledge of flame sorcery has since vanished.\n&lt;a href=\"Quelana%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Quelana of Izalith&lt;/a&gt;, a Daughter of Chaos, managed to flee the catastrophe created by her mother. Quelana is credited as the \"mother of pyromancy\" and is likely the originator of the primal pyromancies. Quelana teaches her art to a select few students and now resides in &lt;a href=\"Blighttown\"&gt;Blighttown&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Salaman%20the%20Master%20Pyromancer\"&gt;Salaman the Master Pyromancer&lt;/a&gt;, a student of Quelana over two-hundred years before the events surrounding the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt;, was the inventor of &lt;a href=\"Great%20Fireball\"&gt;Great Fireball&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 his namesake. &lt;a href=\"Carmina\"&gt;Carmina&lt;/a&gt;, the most accomplished pupil of Salaman, is credited with having taken the art in new directions. Carmina's pyromancies focus on actualizing the inner-self, and &lt;a href=\"Power%20Within\"&gt;Power Within&lt;/a&gt; was kept secret for eons due to its dangerous nature.\n&lt;a href=\"Eingyi\"&gt;Eingyi&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Egg%20Burdened\"&gt;egg-burdened&lt;/a&gt; servant of &lt;a href=\"Quelaag%27s%20Sister\"&gt;The Fair Lady&lt;/a&gt;, was banished from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Swamp\"&gt;Great Swamp&lt;/a&gt; as a heretic for his perversions of pyromancy. Eingyi's pyromancies are a diversion from the art, illustrating that Pyromancy can be made into something beyond the mere manipulation of fire.\nMost &lt;a href=\"pyromancer\"&gt;pyromancer&lt;/a&gt;s, and many of the rudimentary spells that they wield, seem to originate from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Swamp\"&gt;Great Swamp&lt;/a&gt;, a remote region where they were driven. Due to its primitive nature, Pyromancy is often shunned by advanced cultures and many sorcerers mock its simplicity."}

Due to this, it tends to be used by most players who favor physical damage builds, but who still want to possess some magical spells to either surprise opponents or to merely fill the gap between short and long range combat without having the need to pull out a bow mid combat, thus allowing for a shield to be used in the other hand to block strikes or spells. It is important to note that most of these spells have severe range penalties to compensate for its ease of use, as well as a very small number of uses.\u00a0\nRegardless of it being used primarily by those who don't cast regular spells, leveling up Faith and Intelligence is still a good idea as both will raise the damage of all fire based forms of damage caused by the player, Pyromancies included. As such, a player who focuses on magical attributes will still deal more damage than those who do not. \u00a0\nPlayers may also upgrade their Pyromancy Flame up to a total of ten times by using a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Fire%20Seed\"&gt;Fire Seed&lt;/a&gt; at each stage along with souls to increase their damage output.\nThis school suffers from the same problems that other sources of fire damage suffer from; most armors tend to have higher fire resistances and enemies can also become &lt;a href=\"Waterlogged\"&gt;Waterlogged&lt;/a&gt; due to water present in the terrain or rain. As such this gives them +300 Fire Defense, which greatly reduces the efficacy of pyromancies. Enemies entirely submerged in water, such as the &lt;a href=\"Lizardman\"&gt;Lizardman&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Amana\"&gt;Shrine of Amana&lt;/a&gt;, can be entirely unaffected by most pyromancies for as long as they stay underwater. Finally, most DLC enemies boast greater elemental resistances than enemies in the core game, and enemies within the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20the%20Old%20Iron%20King\"&gt;Crown of the Old Iron King&lt;/a&gt; have an even greater resistance to fire damage, with the &lt;a href=\"Fume%20Knight\"&gt;Fume Knight&lt;/a&gt; in particular being especially resistant and also immune to poison/toxic.

The most guaranteed way to encounter her is to level up a &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20Flame\"&gt;Pyromancy Flame&lt;/a&gt; to +10. Being invaded by or summoning someone with a +10 or above flame reportedly spawns her as well.\nPlot.\nUpon meeting Quelana, she offers to teach the player &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;pyromancy&lt;/a&gt;. After a while, she asks the player to defeat what is left\u00a0of her corrupted sisters, &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Witch%20Quelaag\"&gt;Quelaag&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Daughter%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Daughter of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; to free the consumed souls of her mother and sisters. Upon completing her requests, she gifts the player her final pyromancy: &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Tempest\"&gt;Fire Tempest&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nQuelana was originally a \"flame witch\" who used fire sorcery. When Izalith was consumed and the demons infested the city, she fled and became the creator of pyromancy.\u00a0It is unknown whether the knowledge of fire sorcery was forgotten by her or whether she created pyromancy as a safer version of it. Quelana passed on her knowledge to &lt;a href=\"Salaman%20the%20Master%20Pyromancer\"&gt;Salaman&lt;/a&gt;, who in turn passed on his knowledge of pyromancy to the people of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Swamp\"&gt;Great Swamp&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to a developer interview, Quelana and the other &lt;a href=\"Daughters%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Daughters of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; are a different species, despite appearing similar to humans. Her in-game model may not reflect her \"canon\" appearance, with pale, ash-colored skin, as seen in the opening cutscene and achievement art.\nStrategy.\nQuelana has an unlimited amount of pyromancies at her disposal. She seems to prefer &lt;a href=\"Great%20Fireball\"&gt;Great Fireball&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Tempest\"&gt;Fire Tempest&lt;/a&gt; the most. Both are very powerful if they connect, but have slow start-ups, allowing players to go for the backstab if they are close enough. Quelana may deal high damage but is physically very weak. Quelana is also just as susceptible to poison as the player is; one can choose to attack her and have her wade into the swamp surrounding her, leading to a slow death. Finally, the &lt;a href=\"Infested%20Barbarian\"&gt;Infested Barbarian&lt;/a&gt;s can also damage her heavily should they chase the player to that point."}

Quicksteps have less recovery than rolls, however players will suffer from &lt;a href=\"Instability\"&gt;Instability&lt;/a&gt; immediately after dodge frames.\nOnly consumes 5 &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt; (4 &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Manikin%20Claws%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Manikin Claws&lt;/a&gt;' case), which allows its frequent use throughout an encounter to keep adversaries off-balance.\nCertain enemies can be seen to make frequent use of this skill, like &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Assassin\"&gt;Hollow Assassin&lt;/a&gt;s, in an attempt to surround the player and allow other foes to enter the battle to attack them from all sides.\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nGenerally Quickstep is not overly useful against non-human enemies, as normal rolls will suffice much of the time; as well, rolls do not cost FP, which is a much more limited resource outside of invasions and duels.

However, be wary that faster weapons like &lt;a href=\"Curved%20Swords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Curved Swords&lt;/a&gt; have wide horizontal swings that can catch players to the side and inflict bonus damage due to &lt;a href=\"Instability\"&gt;Instability&lt;/a&gt;."}

Each dart will inflict damage equal to 30% of the weapon's physical attack rating, and 35% of any elemental damage in the case of an elemental &lt;a href=\"Infusion%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;infusion&lt;/a&gt;. The direction of the leap can be controlled by the wielder.\nUpon landing, performing a strong attack will cause the wielder to charge forth with the sword, inflicting 120% of the weapon's attack rating to any target it hits.\nThe dart attack costs 7 &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt;, or 6 FP with the &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Ring\"&gt;Farron Ring&lt;/a&gt; equipped. The follow-up strong thrust costs 8 FP, or 6 FP with the Farron Ring equipped.\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nThe individual darts do not inflict a meaningful amount of damage, so this skill is not a very efficient use of FP for damage purposes. However, the darts can be used to draw aggro from faraway enemies without expending throwables like &lt;a href=\"Throwing%20Knife%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Throwing Knives&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnline gameplay.\nBecause of the wide spread of the dart attack, one should not expect to hit a target with more than one dart while performing this skill. However, due to its low cost, this skill can be handy for harassing an opponent if a &lt;a href=\"Simple%20Gem\"&gt;Simple&lt;/a&gt; infusion is utilized for FP recovery.\nThe strong follow-up is very handy for punishing foes that attempt to dodge the darts and then close the distance on what they presume is a vulnerable target, particularly as the weapon's thrust damage can inflict &lt;a href=\"Counter%20Attack\"&gt;counter damage&lt;/a&gt;. It has strong forward momentum, and can be used to turn the tables on an overconfident opponent. However, beware that it possesses no &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt; and thus can be punished in return if not used wisely.\nIt is worthwhile to note that &lt;a href=\"Negative%20Status%20Effects%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt; buildup can be inflicted with the darts should the weapon be buffed. This means that by using a &lt;a href=\"Rotten%20Pine%20Resin%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Rotten Pine Resin&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible to safely inflict &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; safely from long range."}

Care should be taken, though, as most likely the summoner will start unleashing barrages of homing spells; the first of these may be completely negated if caught during the backstabbing animation, however.\nIf it's not possible to finish the champion after the initial attack, then the player should hurry in killing the summoner while he's still recovering.\nWhile in combat, the champion will constantly perform his rapier's &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ricard%27s%20Lunge%20and%20Press\"&gt;Ricard's Lunge and Press&lt;/a&gt;, where he unleashes quick three-stabbing barrages, culminating with a powerful lunge. The player may attempt to &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt; this attack, but if unsuccessful, they will sustain heavy damage. Alternatively, they may opt to roll behind him while he is performing this move, and while he finishes, backstab him."}

Furthermore, if the player would have been &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Cursed&lt;/a&gt; upon death, they are instead not cursed. However, if the player was already cursed before they died, the curse will not be lifted.

Should a player with an uncollected bloodstain die while having a Rare Ring of Sacrifice equipped, their bloodstain will not be lost. \nOverview.\nWhile the regular Ring of Sacrifice can allow players to keep their souls and humanities upon death, it cannot save players from death upon being cursed. Therefore, the Rare Ring of Sacrifice works best in areas where the player may die from Curse before recovering a very valuable bloodstain. However, as the ring is a lot rarer, it is best to use it sparingly by either equipping a Ring of Sacrifice where the risk of being cursed is not present, or otherwise increasing Curse resistance if such risk is present."}

He will appear in the room directly behind the boss arenas and if the player joins the covenant, he will grant them the &lt;a href=\"Crest%20of%20the%20Rat\"&gt;Crest of the Rat&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to defend the &lt;a href=\"Grave%20of%20Saints\"&gt;Grave of Saints&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe looks nearly identical to the standard &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Rat\"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt;; however, he possesses the ability to communicate with the player. Personality wise, he seems to be opportunistic, as when spoken to after conquering a burrow, he offers the player a chance to join him in spite of his subjects being killed. The more &lt;a href=\"Rat%20Tail\"&gt;Rat Tail&lt;/a&gt;s that are offered, the kinder and less loathing toward &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s he becomes. He also even mentions peace between the rats and humans, showing more care toward the future of his kind and kingdom than spitefulness.\nLore.\nThe Rat King is the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Rat\"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt;. In ages past, the Rat King struck an accord with a human chieftain which stated that the humans would rule the lands lapped by the sun's rays and the rats all that was below. However, humans broke their promise and hunted the rats down in their burrows. This left the Rat King bitter and hateful toward humans, declaring them to be nothing more than fools, liars and cheaters.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Bearer%20of%20the%20Curse\"&gt;Bearer of the Curse&lt;/a&gt; can conquer one of the Rat King's burrows, he will permit them to serve him, despite the fact they are human. If they serve him well, it may prove to the Rat King that not all humans are worthless and give him hope that perhaps rats and humans may one day coexist in peace together once more."}

After defeating either boss, you will be rewarded with the boss soul, along with a &lt;a href=\"Rat%20Tail\"&gt;Rat Tail&lt;/a&gt;. Directly after each of the boss rooms, is a room where the &lt;a href=\"Rat%20King%20%28character%29\"&gt;Rat King&lt;/a&gt; can be located. Talking to him with a &lt;a href=\"Rat%20Tail\"&gt;Rat Tail&lt;/a&gt; in your inventory is required for the Rat King to initiate the player into the covenant.\nPurpose.\nThe purpose of the Rat King covenant is to defend the &lt;a href=\"Grave%20of%20Saints\"&gt;Grave of Saints&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and the &lt;a href=\"Doors%20of%20Pharros\"&gt;Doors of Pharros&lt;/a&gt;.

While wearing the &lt;a href=\"Crest%20of%20the%20Rat\"&gt;Crest of the Rat&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0ring, other players who are in the Grave will be pulled into the player's world as a gray &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt;.

Gray phantoms can escape the Rat King player's world by either killing the host or getting to the end of the area, through the fog door. Rat King players can make use of the Pharros' Lockstones given by activating various traps in the Grave of Saints and Doors of Pharros.\nBenefits.\nUpon joining, the Rat King will grant the player the Crest of the Rat ring. In order to gain ranks in the covenant, &lt;a href=\"Rat%20Tail\"&gt;Rat Tails&lt;/a&gt; must be offered to the Rat King:\nJoining the covenant also negates any hostility from &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Rat\"&gt;Corpse Rat&lt;/a&gt;s in the Grave of Saints, as well as making all enemies beyond the first &lt;a href=\"Doors%20of%20Pharros%23Bonfires\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt; in Doors of Pharros friendly."}

It is recommended to close in on the creature as soon as the fight begins as it uses a powerful rolling charge at a distance that covers a lot of ground. Evading this charge will cause the lizard to crash into a wall, temporarily stunning it.\nAt close range, the lizard will alternate between swiping with its tail and a lunging bite, although it will occasionally use a shunt to break the player's guard. As it can attack from any angle, the player should not let their guard down as they circle it. From mid-range, the lizard will use crystal breath to create a line of spikes directly in front of it but this can be evaded by moving to its sides.\nRavenous Crystal Lizards are vulnerable to staggers and repeatedly striking their heads will cause them to rear up stunned for a few seconds. The player can perform a special attack where they impale the lizard in the skull before kicking it away that deals high damage.\nThe crystal lizards in the cathedral and the keep can be lured to smaller doorways, where they can't reach you but you can get them with ranged attacks (magic and/or archery) or well-timed melee attacks. The doorways in the keep are: just beyond the bonfire closest to the Abyss Watchers arena, and the barred iron door just beyond the lizard. The doorway in the cathedral is just up the stairs from the waterway filled with the maggot enemies, leading to a small room with coffins.\nDrops.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Cemetery of Ash =\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

They later appear locked in cells in the &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20Dungeon\"&gt;Irithyll Dungeon&lt;/a&gt;.\nDue to their decrepit appearance, they may seem to be dismissable at first; however, the player will soon notice they have an impressive amount of health at the moment they can first be encountered, requiring from two to three slashes of heavy weaponry to subdue each. While most of their attacks are slow and predictable, they may surprise by suddenly lunging and performing a quick swipe with their arms.\nSome of them only have the ability of vomiting onto the player to inflict damage. The most dangerous variant, however, are those which pose as normal corpses and, once they are approached, explode into a myriad of maggots, becoming &lt;a href=\"Infested%20Corpse\"&gt;Infested Corpse&lt;/a&gt;s instead.\nStrategy.\nAs they will \"endlessly\" respawn in the graveyard, these enemies can be easily rushed-by and should be ignored unless they directly block the way through. Due to their weak attacks and poor vitality, they should not pose much of a threat to the player unless they get cornered.\nIf the player befriended the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Archer%20of%20the%20Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;giant archer&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Undead Settlement&lt;/a&gt;, his arrows will start raining down in the small cemetery located right in front of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, aiding to lessen the mobs congregating in that area.\nThe Reanimated Corpses in the &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20Dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; are considerably more dangerous due to their greater damage output. Although they appear passive at first, they will attempt to attack the player if they let their guard down; this can be especially hazardous if the player is also being affected by a &lt;a href=\"Jailer\"&gt;Jailer&lt;/a&gt;'s health drain.\nSome of them can be encountered lying on the cells' floors and the player may dismiss them, leaving them for simple corpses like all those which abound in the area. However, they will wake up silently and attack once the player has performed a specific action, like passing by their cells or attacking other enemies.\nReanimated Corpses are extremely vulnerable to fire and will stagger heavily while they get engulfed in flames if attacked with a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;-infused weapon. This becomes especially useful in the graveyard, where massive mobs may gather if the player dwindles in the same area for too long. Since most enemies in all throughout the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;cathedral&lt;/a&gt; are susceptible to fire, it would be a good idea for the player to consider infusing their primary weapon with this element, even if it means sacrificing its &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt; bonuses temporarily, as the staggering effect will prove to be very useful while traversing through these areas."}

This means that the wielder becomes significantly more vulnerable inside of the arc of the weapon due to lack of &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;, and as such should take care to avoid letting foes get too close.\nReapers.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

On top of this, when &lt;a href=\"Infusion\"&gt;infused&lt;/a&gt; with any element, it will have 100% reduction against it, negating the attack entirely (since the hardest &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; to dodge are &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;sorceries&lt;/a&gt;, because of their speed, tracking and &lt;a href=\"Casting%20Speed\"&gt;speed to cast&lt;/a&gt;, it would be wise to infuse it with &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;).

However, this is not a shield to protect against physical attacks which deal very large amounts of &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; damage, but rather a shield for blocking spells."}

This move shares the same animation as the &lt;a href=\"Imperious%20Knight\"&gt;Imperious Knight&lt;/a&gt;'s shield pincer attacks. Pressing LT will result in the same pincer attack, with higher stamina usage and damage rating. The LB pincer attacks have very high stamina usage at about 70 per use, and the LT variant about 90.\nSome players reported that the LB pincer attack has a yet undetermined time frame by which enemy strikes from an angle to both sides will be deflected, but attacks from the center front are not affected.\nUnlike the &lt;a href=\"Imperious%20Knight\"&gt;Imperious Knight&lt;/a&gt;s, the \"clenched shields\" state at the end of the pincer attack cannot be prolonged, and does not count as blocking.\nOwing to high inherent damage rating and unique Power Stance attack that delivers damage from both shields at once, the Orma's &amp; Reeve's Greatshield pairing might be the only shields in \"Dark Souls II\" that can be counted as a legit weapon.\nWhen upgraded and with the right build, this shield pairing can make short work of most bosses and lightly armored players while providing solid defense; its main drawback lies in the initial long windup of its first pincer attack (same windup time as a shield bash), and its almost non-existent range means players will have a hard time following up on an attack after knocking back an enemy due to sheer poise damage."}

It is possible to find multiple Resonance Rings at once. Resonance rings appear as small white rings fixed slightly above the ground. When the player is close to one, the power of certain &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Miracles&lt;/a&gt; are boosted. When the player is close enough so that their miracles can receive a boost, a white circle will appear over the selected miracle.\nThe effect of resonance rings does stack and is divided in four levels; standing next to three up to five resonance rings results in Double Synergy, to six up to nine rings results in Triple Synergy and to ten or more results in Quadruple Synergy. Each level generally multiplies the effect of ordinary Synergy; a Double Synergy doubles the effect, a Triple Synergy triples it and a Quadruple Synergy quadruples it. Wearing the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Sun%20Princess\"&gt;Ring of the Sun Princess&lt;/a&gt; grants a boost to miracles equivalent to that of being close to a resonance ring. The effects of the Ring of the Sun Princess stack with resonance rings, so standing next to one Resonance Ring with the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Sun%20Princess\"&gt;Ring of the Sun Princess&lt;/a&gt; equipped results in a Double Synergy, to three up to five resonance rings results in a Triple Synergy and to six or more results in a Quadruple Synergy.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20Synergy\"&gt;Miracle Synergy&lt;/a&gt; for more information."}

This spell will last 54 seconds when spiced down to 10 Faith all the way up to 180 seconds at 30 Faith where the duration scaling is capped.\nThe high HP increase, long duration and relatively low requirements of Resonant Flesh makes it a very useful spell for all players, regardless of their &lt;a href=\"vigor\"&gt;vigor&lt;/a&gt;. Players with low HP can counteract this weakness with Resonant Flesh while players with high HP can use it to become considerably more durable than they were before. Resonant Flesh only increases the HP cap, and does not add to the player's current HP.

They can be turned against Rhoy if a &lt;a href=\"Seed%20of%20a%20Giant%20Tree\"&gt;Seed of a Giant Tree&lt;/a&gt; is used.\nFarming.\nRhoy is notable for being very easily farmed. He will spawn up to 15 times per game/&lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20Ascetic\"&gt;Bonfire Ascetic&lt;/a&gt;. This can be useful for players trying to max out their &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20Blue\"&gt;Way of Blue&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Company%20of%20Champions\"&gt;Company of Champions&lt;/a&gt; covenants. Rhoy also has a 100% chance of dropping an &lt;a href=\"Awestone\"&gt;Awestone&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0if the player is a member of the Company of Champions. Players should start to the &lt;a href=\"Grave%20Entrance\"&gt;Grave Entrance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;. From there, it is \"recommended\" to stay at the top level until all 5 rats have dropped and been killed, especially after &lt;a href=\"NG%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;NG&lt;/a&gt;. Once done, players should jump down the ladder, and immediately climb it. This will trigger Rhoy's invasion.\nAfter about 15 cycles, Rhoy will stop spawning, and will require a Bonfire Ascetic. The bonfire this should be used is \"not\" the current Grave Entrance bonfire, but rather the first bonfire of the area: &lt;a href=\"Harval%27s%20Resting%20Place\"&gt;Harval's Resting Place&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn , Rhoy will invade only once in NG, but he will invade infinitely if the Bonfire Intensity is 2 or higher and the player is in the Company of Champions covenant. He also has a chance to drop Awestones as normal drops, effectively rewarding 2 Awestones for a lucky kill.\nA safe way to kill him is to activate the drawbridge on the second floor and lure him there to then push him down to the bottomless pit below: this will make his drop unavailable drop (the &lt;a href=\"Awestone\"&gt;Awestone&lt;/a&gt; that is always dropped will be added to the player's inventory regardless).\nA comfortable and quick farm method rather than to run around the top floor until all the rats are dead and then kill him by the bon fire to reset (average lap 2:30) is starting from the grave entrance bonfire to drop down the ladder with out climbing it, stand hugging the base of the ladder for about one second, use this time to enchant if needed, you will get the message he has invaded, turn the corner and kill the three rats, two in the lower hole and the one above quickly. you should still have about 2 seconds to spare and you will see him climbing down the ladder. you can now fight him in that area with out the worry of rats."}

Rickert is also a blacksmith who can repair damaged weapons and armor, and ascend weapons down the Magic path (up to +5) by default. He can give players early access to spells and spell tools, but both &lt;a href=\"Big%20Hat%20Logan\"&gt;Big Hat Logan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Griggs%20of%20Vinheim\"&gt;Griggs&lt;/a&gt; offer better prices and better spells.

Not much is known about him except that he considers Big Hat Logan to be a legend dating back to \"a hundred years ago\". \nStrategy.\nThe only way to hurt Rickert is through the use of a long weapon, such as the &lt;a href=\"Titanite%20Catch%20Pole\"&gt;Titanite Catch Pole&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Demon%27s%20Spear\"&gt;Demon's Spear&lt;/a&gt;. While Rickert does not fight back, it is easy to fall off the ledge accidentally. As Rickert can also be hurt by &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Gods\"&gt;Wrath of the Gods&lt;/a&gt; using it is safer since it does not require movement."}

The effect of the standard ring is as strong as the \"Dark Souls\" version, but the +1 and +2 rings having substantially stronger effect (66% and 166% stronger respectively). This is to contrast with most other rings carried over from \"Dark Souls\", whose effects have been tuned down. The Ring of the Evil Eye is a somewhat viable means of maintaining health depending on the foes being faced and the amount of damage one takes before dispatching them as well as the version of the ring itself needless to say the +1 and 2 rings are better than the standard at this.\nOverview.\nThis ring serves as a great way to mitigate self-damaging effects, such as those caused by the &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Blade%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Chaos Blade&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Immolation\"&gt;Immolation&lt;/a&gt;, or damage-over-time effects like &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;, provided there are enemies around to kill. However, it is best to replace it with a different ring for boss fights that don't consist of multiple enemies (like &lt;a href=\"Prowling%20Magus%20and%20Congregation\"&gt;Prowling Magus and Congregation&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Lord\"&gt;Skeleton Lord&lt;/a&gt;s), as it is effectively useless when fighting only one or two tough enemies."}

Additionally, the heal doesn't account for multiple enemies being killed within a short period of time or by a single attack.\nThe effect can be stacked with &lt;a href=\"Arstor%27s%20Spear\"&gt;Arstor's Spear&lt;/a&gt; to heal an additional 30 HP per kill.\nUse.\nSingle player.\nThe Ring of the Evil Eye is an excellent way of conserving healing items or spells, and excels when used against groups of weak enemies due to healing the same amount regardless of how powerful the enemy is. Because of the way it procs against multiple kills, it is best to kill enemies one at a time if the goal is to recover health.\nOnline gameplay.\nThis ring can be very potent depending on the area. Because the effect procs no matter who gets the kill, a phantom can gain the benefit from the host or an allied phantom killing an enemy, and an invader can profit from the host's party killing enemies to get to the invader. In either case, it can be a very helpful way to maintain health due to possessing less health and half the Estus of a &lt;a href=\"Host%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Host of Embers&lt;/a&gt;."}

Despite their proximity to the dark and resemblance to the servants of &lt;a href=\"Darkstalker%20Kaathe\"&gt;Darkstalker Kaathe&lt;/a&gt;, they have not been corrupted and continue to serve the gods.\nThey are capable of igniting their weapons, greatly increasing their offensive capabilities. \nLocation.\nOnly encountered in &lt;a href=\"The%20Ringed%20City%20%28location%29\"&gt;The Ringed City&lt;/a&gt;:\nLore.\nThe Ringed Knights date back to the war against the dragons where they fought alongside &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;. However their efforts were not recognized or commemorated.\nDue to their close proximity to the dark and their equipment, the gods branded them with a seal of fire; regardless, the knights continued to serve loyally.\nStrategy.\nAll Ringed Knights have the same traits, high &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; resistance, weak to &lt;a href=\"Frost\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt;, large health, can be &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bled&lt;/a&gt;, and they are extremely powerful and aggressive with &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;s that deal extra &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage and grant them &lt;a href=\"poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt;. Under no circumstances should they be fought two at a time.\nThere are three variants:\nStraight Sword.\nAmong the other Ringed Knights, they are the second hardest of them all. Their regular attacks usually are combos of two or three attacks often ending with a thrust, but sometimes followed by an upward attack. Spam-roll for best effect. When using their weapon's &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;, staying close to them is nearly suicidal, as they deal tremendous damage and four-combo attacks that are hard to dodge, and a final delayed attack that deals even more damage. Instead, try to stay as far from them as possible and then start getting closer. This triggers their thrust attack, which is very easy to dodge by rolling into it and then &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;backstabbing&lt;/a&gt; them for free easy damage.\nTheir shield is mostly for attacking and tricking the player. If they block and the player has enough &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;, keep attacking as two strikes often break their guards for a free riposte.\nHowever, there is really only one attack that players need to be careful with, which is when they run toward them while using the fire breath. This serves only to mask their intent of a thrust attack as it is hard to see behind the fire. However, if the player times it well, they may roll into the attack and be rewarded with an easy backstab on the knight.\nSpear.\nBy far the most dangerous Ringed Knight, he has great range, damage potential, and extreme defense capacities. His spear has many combos with delayed horizontal attacks that make it hard to dodge anywhere since his range is so wide, therefore roll into the direction of where the attack is coming from in order to more effectively dodge it.\nHis weapon's skill is extremely dangerous and just makes everything about this knight even worse. Upon using it, the spear ignites (this grants it extra damage and range) and the knight lunges into the air toward the player with a thrust attack. Immediately after, he will use a very delayed and high damaging slice, occasionally followed by another thrust that also shoots &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; into the ground in a narrow, yet long range toward the direction he faces. When he uses his skill, players should try to backstab after his second or third combo, as it leaves him wide open with his guard down; if successful, players can then deliver some more free damage as he gets up.\nWhile the straight sword-wielding Ringed Knight can be easily &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Break\"&gt;guard broken&lt;/a&gt; and players with larger weapons can trade with them, that all becomes much harder and even dangerous to attempt due to the spear-wielding Ringed Knight's greatshield. Not only can it take many hits before guard broken, his greatshield's skill unleashes a violent shockwave that damages and throws players off their feet while granting &lt;a href=\"Perseverance\"&gt;Perseverance&lt;/a&gt; to the knight. This makes it impossible to trade with his attacks and gives him a boost to his defense. Either use a heavy weapon or a &lt;a href=\"Stance\"&gt;Stance&lt;/a&gt; heavy attack to break his guard. If players do not have this sort of weaponry, then playing passively and the aforementioned backstab strategy is their best bet.\nPaired Greatswords.\nWhile he is the Ringed Knight with the highest damage potential, his slow, easy to dodge and poorly delayed attacks make him the easiest of the knights to actually kill. He does have poise, so it becomes harder to stagger mid attacks and the player should be careful with the startup of his weapon's skill since it throws a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; shockwave similar to &lt;a href=\"Moonlight%20Greatsword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Moonlight Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; on a fully charged attack; therefore, rolling toward the attack and off to the side, rather the away from the attack itself, is the recommended course of action. However, they may follow up with either a powerful thrust or with a flip attack that causes a large, high damaging explosion, beware the latter.\nIn rare occasions, he may perform the skill, then the thrust attack, followed up by the flip; this will likely kill any player if all hits land. Besides that, he is the easiest of the Ringed Knight to backstab. Beware as more than two attacks will cause him to attack immediately with boosted poise; do not spam your attacks more than twice, as by then, not even &lt;a href=\"Great%20Hammers%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;great hammers&lt;/a&gt; can stagger him. Playing passively is encouraged."}

It also possesses the &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; health of a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Hammers%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;great hammer&lt;/a&gt;, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Fume%20Ultra%20Greatsword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fume Ultra Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;, making it very strong at trading against other &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt; weapons of equal size.\nThe defining characteristic of this weapon is that it is &lt;a href=\"Paired%20Weapons\"&gt;paired&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the wielder to perform devastating combos that bring both greatswords to bear on one or multiple targets. Each individual attack has extremely strong stun potential, locking down foes and rendering them helpless to be eviscerated by the blades' high damage output. While the one-handed attacks can be &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parried&lt;/a&gt;, the paired attacks cannot. This can be useful for mixing up attacks against opponents who attempt to parry this weapon due to the one-handed moveset. Additionally, its &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; can bring even more damage output to the table, as well as greatly extend the wielder's reach via launched projectiles and strong forward-momentum rush attacks.\nHowever, all of the paired greatswords' attacks are very slow to bring to bear, making it easy to reaction-dodge by experienced players. Like other ultra weapons, care must be exercised to prevent the foe from exploiting openings and punishing extended attack combos, particularly with &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;backstabs&lt;/a&gt;."}

As such, the weapon boasts powerful long-ranged thrusts that can keep individual foes at bay as well as wide sweep attacks that are adept at dealing with crowds.\nLike other Ringed Knight weapons, the Ringed Knight Spear's &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; ignites the blade of the weapon, dealing extra &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage and boosting the range of the weapon itself. Upon activation, the player leaps forward at great speed for a strong thrust, buffing the weapon with increased damage for a short amount of time and greatly augmenting the power of its strong attacks, though this comes at the cost of increased stamina usage.\nWhen the buff is active, the Ringed Knight Spear's jumping and rolling attacks transform into those normally performed by &lt;a href=\"Halberds%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;halberds&lt;/a&gt;.\nMoveset.\n&lt;br&gt;\nUpgrades.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

Unlike most straight swords it is largely &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;-oriented in terms of &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt;, and is tied with the &lt;a href=\"Gotthard%20Twinswords\"&gt;Gotthard Twinswords&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lothric%27s%20Holy%20Sword\"&gt;Lothric's Holy Sword&lt;/a&gt; for the longest straight sword in the game. However, it is also tied with the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sword\"&gt;Dark Sword&lt;/a&gt; for the heaviest straight sword in the game (excluding paired weapons like the Gotthard Twinswords and &lt;a href=\"Valorheart\"&gt;Valorheart&lt;/a&gt;), and cannot benefit from &lt;a href=\"Infusion%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;infusions&lt;/a&gt;, making it less flexible as a weapon and ideal largely for quality builds.\nWhat sets the Ringed Knight Straight Sword apart from its peers is its &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ember%20%28Ringed%20Knight%20Straight%20Sword%29\"&gt;Ember&lt;/a&gt;. This ability greatly extends its already potent reach, and allows the wielder to perform devastating combos and chase down foes with abandon. The attacks from the Ember stance also possess &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt;, a rarity on weapons of this class size, and make it a force to be reckoned with.\nDescription.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Official translation=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

When spoken to afterward, Leonhard will congratulate the player and teach them the &lt;a href=\"Gestures%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;\"Applause\" gesture&lt;/a&gt;, before he encourages them to join &lt;a href=\"Rosaria%27s%20Fingers\"&gt;Rosaria's Fingers&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the player deepens devotion to Rosaria's Fingers by offering a Pale Tongue to &lt;a href=\"Rosaria%2C%20Mother%20of%20Rebirth\"&gt;Rosaria, Mother of Rebirth&lt;/a&gt; (as opposed to using the attribute reallocation or appearance change services), Leonhard will appear near the entrance to her chamber, where he briefly greets the player.\nWhen the player reaches the &lt;a href=\"Profaned%20Capital\"&gt;Profaned Capital&lt;/a&gt; past &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20Dungeon\"&gt;Irithyll Dungeon&lt;/a&gt;, Leonhard becomes paranoid that they will try and steal &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20Rosaria\"&gt;Rosaria's soul&lt;/a&gt;, and murders her before fleeing to &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;. The player can find a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Eye%20Orb%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Black Eye Orb&lt;/a&gt; on Rosaria's corpse, which can be used to invade Leonhard's world in the chamber once containing the illusion of &lt;a href=\"Gwynevere%2C%20Princess%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce defeated, Leonhard will drop the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20Rosaria\"&gt;Soul of Rosaria&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Mask\"&gt;Silver Mask&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Crescent%20Moon%20Sword\"&gt;Crescent Moon Sword&lt;/a&gt;; as well, the remainder of &lt;a href=\"Leonhard%27s%20Set\"&gt;his set&lt;/a&gt; can be purchased from the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20Handmaid\"&gt;Shrine Handmaid&lt;/a&gt;. The questline ends at this point, as the player can choose to either return Rosaria's Soul to her corpse, consume it for &lt;a href=\"Soul%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Boss%20Soul%20Items%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;transpose&lt;/a&gt; it with &lt;a href=\"Ludleth%20of%20Courland\"&gt;Ludleth of Courland&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nLike the other members of Rosaria's Fingers, Leonhard has the &lt;a href=\"Obscuring%20Ring\"&gt;Obscuring Ring&lt;/a&gt; equipped by default, so retreating outside of lock-on range can allow him to approach the player stealthily. He will alternate between attacking with his curved sword and casting &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;sorceries&lt;/a&gt; with his staff, using either &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Soulmass%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Homing Soulmass&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Greatsword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Soul Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;. If given the chance he will even cast &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic Shield&lt;/a&gt;. He is a very aggressive foe and his shotel can deal damage past shields, so good dodging skills are required to prevail against him. At range, he tends to cast Homing Soulmass and then combine it with &lt;a href=\"Crescent%20Blade\"&gt;Crescent Blade&lt;/a&gt; for an extremely powerful projectile attack. \nLike most other NPC invaders, Leonhard can drink from his &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt; up to twice before running out.\nEven with his melee prowess in mind, it is advised to keep close to him to avoid his repeated casting of ranged attacks and bait him into being parried. Conserving stamina to rush him down when he attempts to consume his Estus Flask. The second swing on his combo is the best chance to parry him, as it possesses a longer wind up animation."}

The torch-wielders attack short ranged, while the unarmed cast Fire Surge, as well as large, fireball projectiles.\nThey release a cloud of\u00a0blood upon death which can inflict a great deal of Toxic buildup to the player if not avoided, causing 8 damage per second over 10 minutes once contracted.\u00a0They can also cast\u00a0a small cloud similar to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Toxic%20Mist%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Toxic Mist&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategies.\nThere will be no visible cloud of blood if the engorged hollow is killed with &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Damage%20Type%29%23Utilization\"&gt;Fire damage&lt;/a&gt; and toxic discharge range will be extremely short in this case. However, if the player is pressed in very close for the killing blow, they can still be hit with toxic.\nSince the Toxic discharge has a very short range, the use of a ranged or long handled weapon, like a &lt;a href=\"Spear\"&gt;Spear&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Halberd\"&gt;Halberd&lt;/a&gt;, is very effective.\n&lt;a href=\"Backstab\"&gt;Backstab&lt;/a&gt;bing will delay the Toxin's release; however, the blood must still be avoided for a few seconds.

{"id": "68637", "revid": "49243392", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=68637", "title": "Enhanced Undead", "text": "The Enhanced Undead is an in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\nEnhanced Undead are seemingly genetic experiments created by &lt;a href=\"Aldia%2C%20Scholar%20of%20the%20First%20Sin\"&gt;Lord Aldia&lt;/a&gt;, in his attempts to achieve immortality and recreate &lt;a href=\"dragons\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;. The former undead has undergone a hideous mutation which made it almost half-dragon, granting them increased strength but grotesquely altering their appearance into inhuman beasts that now prowl the darkest places of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt;. They resemble horrid amalgamations of twisted humans, being bulky in nature, having a large hunch-backed form, thick arms, and having to crawl around. Their hairless bodies are adorned in horned growths, protruding along their body; accompanied by a scaly tail.\nStrategy.\nThe Undead's attacks drain a lot of stamina so it is advisable to evade their attacks, rather than trying to block them. They move very slowly but caution is advised, they can perform a powerful lunge attack from a distance. Ranged attacks and spells are the safest way to eliminate them but it is possible to backstab them as long as the player steers clear of their tail swipes. Using &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poison Arrows&lt;/a&gt; is also a very good idea as they have no ranged protection: this may trigger a jump attack from them though.\nLightning damage.\nIn the Sinner's Rise, since these creatures are immersed in &lt;a href=\"Water%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, they have lower &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; defense than usual and players who can deal high Lightning damage can take advantage of this. On the other hand, players who rely mainly on &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage will have a hard time against them, as the water increases their Fire defense to 95%.\nBackstab and run.\nThe Enhanced Undead can be &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;bed. In particular, when approaching the player, it will almost always close the gap with a lunge attack. The player can very easily evade this attack with a sideways roll (preferably to the left) even in deep water. This will leave the Enhanced Undead's back wide open. While the backstab itself might not be enough to kill the Undead, it can easily be finished off while it is recovering (and vulnerable).\nIn Sinner's Rise, the Enhanced Undead to the right will be \"partially\" unaware to the player's presence. It will face back and forth between the two opening. Wait until it looks the other way to close in and land a backstab.\nBaiting.\nThe Enhanced Undead can also be killed by repeatedly baiting its left handed swipe attack and landing a single blow while it recovers. While in close quarters the Enhanced Undead will use this move frequently so the player should be able to kill it fairly quickly. It is strongly advised to completely avoid its tail swipe attack however, it deals a lot of damage and has a deceptively short recovery time.\nElevator trickery.\nIt's possible to use the elevator to reach the underground section to the player's advantage in two way: one can either lure the enemy on the elevator itself and activate the pressure plate to send the mob away (even if they fall, they'll be stuck on the wooden platform above the area) or send the elevator back up first and bait the beast to attack close enough to the chasm to fall to their death."}

Similar to weapons, most armor can be upgraded with &lt;a href=\"titanite\"&gt;titanite&lt;/a&gt; to increase their effectiveness.\n&lt;a href=\"Miscellaneous%20Items\"&gt;Items&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn item is generally a consumable used to heal &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;, cure &lt;a href=\"Negative%20Status%20Effects\"&gt;status effects&lt;/a&gt;, gain &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s, etc. It can also include &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt; items, like &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Medal\"&gt;Sunlight Medal&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"offensive%20items\"&gt;offensive items&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;a href=\"Firebomb\"&gt;Firebomb&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Key%20Items\"&gt;Key Items&lt;/a&gt;.\nKey items are items like keys or Smithboxes which can be used to perform useful tasks such as opening doors or maintaining equipment without the need of a smith. The key items known as can be given to specific &lt;a href=\"blacksmiths\"&gt;blacksmiths&lt;/a&gt; to allow them to &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Modification\"&gt;ascend&lt;/a&gt; weapons. All key items, except the &lt;a href=\"Master%20Key\"&gt;Master Key&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bottomless%20Box\"&gt;Bottomless Box&lt;/a&gt;, are lost upon completion of the game and any embers given to blacksmiths must be reacquired upon entering &lt;a href=\"New%20Game%20Plus\"&gt;NG+&lt;/a&gt;.\n\nMagic includes &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;sorceries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;pyromancies&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt;, and they are cast with &lt;a href=\"catalysts\"&gt;catalysts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20Flame\"&gt;pyromancy flames&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"talismans\"&gt;talismans&lt;/a&gt; respectively. In order to use magic, they first need to be &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;attuned&lt;/a&gt; at a &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;. Casts are replenished by resting at a bonfire and multiple copies of the same spell can be attuned to get extra casts.\n&lt;a href=\"Rings%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Rings&lt;/a&gt;.\nRings are ornamental jewelry that are worn on fingers. They generally grant players a passive bonus, usually relating to damage reduction/amplification or movement. A maximum of two can be equipped at any time.\n&lt;a href=\"Shields\"&gt;Shields&lt;/a&gt;.\nShields are categorized as weapons in-game and are defensive equipment, usually held in the left hand. Although shields can be used offensively, they are best suited to their primary purpose: blocking and &lt;a href=\"parry\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt;ing attacks. Shields reduce damage by percentage, the maximum being 100% of damage, and with each attack absorbed, &lt;a href=\"Stamina\"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt; is depleted. Upgrading a shield will increase its attack rating and in most cases will also increase &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt;, reducing the amount of Stamina depleted when blocking. Upgrading will usually not improve its damage reduction; the exception being when a shield is &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Modification\"&gt;ascended&lt;/a&gt; down the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; oriented &lt;a href=\"upgrade%20paths\"&gt;upgrade paths&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Upgrade%20Materials\"&gt;Upgrade Materials&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpgrade Materials include\u00a0titanite and &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Scale\"&gt;Dragon Scale&lt;/a&gt;s. They can be used at &lt;a href=\"blacksmiths\"&gt;blacksmiths&lt;/a&gt;, or with the &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Smithbox\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Smithbox\"&gt;Weapon Smithbox&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;bonfires&lt;/a&gt;, to increase the defense value of armor, the attack rating and &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt; of most shields, and the damage of weapons.\n&lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Weapons&lt;/a&gt;.\nWeapons are equipment that are used primarily to deal damage to enemies. They can attack in either hand, but with a very limited &lt;a href=\"moveset\"&gt;moveset&lt;/a&gt; while wielded in the off-hand, and, depending on the &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Types%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;weapon type&lt;/a&gt;, can also &lt;a href=\"parry\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt; or block when in the off-hand. Although with considerably lower damage reduction when compared to shields, blocking can also be achieved when wielding a weapon with two-hands. Most weapons can be upgraded with &lt;a href=\"Upgrade%20Materials\"&gt;materials&lt;/a&gt; to increase their damage output. &lt;a href=\"Standard%20weapons\"&gt;Standard weapons&lt;/a&gt; can be &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Modification\"&gt;ascended&lt;/a&gt; down various &lt;a href=\"upgrade%20paths\"&gt;upgrade paths&lt;/a&gt; which can alter their base damage, &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus\"&gt;parameter bonus&lt;/a&gt;, and in some cases add an &lt;a href=\"elemental%20damage%20type\"&gt;elemental damage type&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"auxiliary%20effect\"&gt;auxiliary effect&lt;/a&gt;."}

These items come in all different shapes and sizes, ranging from &lt;a href=\"Daggers%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Daggers&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Great%20Hammers%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Great Hammers&lt;/a&gt;.

Weapons can also be infused with different &lt;a href=\"elements\"&gt;elements&lt;/a&gt; and status effects, typically lowering the damage &lt;a href=\"Scaling%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt; but increasing the effectiveness of that element or status effect.\nShields.\n&lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Shields&lt;/a&gt; are technically weapon items, but more similar to armor, in that they protect the player from damage. They are able to block a certain percentage of damage. All shields possess a certain amount of &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt;, which determines how much stamina is lost when a source of damage comes into contact with the shield.\nArmor.\n&lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; is a form of equipment that provides defense. It can be equipped on the &lt;a href=\"Head%20Armor%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chest%20Armor%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hands%20Armor%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;hands&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Legs%20Armor%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;legs&lt;/a&gt;, in order to reduce incoming damage. Most armor can be upgraded to improve effectiveness.\nRings.\n&lt;a href=\"Rings%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Rings&lt;/a&gt; are items that grant special abilities, or increase certain stats. The player can wear four different rings at once, and different upgrade levels of rings are available.\nBelt slot items.\n&lt;a href=\"Items%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Items&lt;/a&gt; can be placed in up to ten (10) belt slots. They are consumed, in order to restore stats or to counteract &lt;a href=\"Negative%20Status%20Effects%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;negative status effect&lt;/a&gt;. They can heal the player, cure &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;curse&lt;/a&gt;, allow the player to gain &lt;a href=\"Souls%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt;, and more. They can also be covenant items, which will allow the player to rank up in different covenants when offered to the leader or shrine.\nAmmunition.\n&lt;a href=\"Ammunition%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Ammunition&lt;/a&gt; includes and , which are used as projectiles to fire from &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crossbows%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;crossbows&lt;/a&gt;. They are consumed with every shot, and two of each kind of ammunition can be equipped.\nTorch.\nA &lt;a href=\"Torch\"&gt;Torch&lt;/a&gt; is not an item found in the player's inventory. Instead, when each Torch is picked up, five minutes are added to a timer visible in the character equipment screen. While lit, it can be used as a light source, in the offhand slot, to light sconces and increase lock-on distance.\nNotes.\nWhile not technically equipment, Upgrade Materials, Key Items, and Magic play an important role in regards to the above items.\nUpgrade Materials.\n&lt;a href=\"Upgrade%20Materials%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Upgrade Materials&lt;/a&gt; are items used to upgrade different types of equipment. All standard weapons and armor are upgraded with &lt;a href=\"Titanite%20Shard%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Titanite Shards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Large%20Titanite%20Shard%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Large Titanite Shards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Titanite%20Chunk%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Titanite Chunks&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Titanite%20Slab%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Titante Slabs&lt;/a&gt;. Unique weapons and armor are upgraded solely with &lt;a href=\"Twinkling%20Titanite%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Twinkling Titanite&lt;/a&gt;. Boss weapons are upgraded with &lt;a href=\"Petrified%20Dragon%20Bone\"&gt;Petrified Dragon Bone&lt;/a&gt;s.\nKey Items.\n&lt;a href=\"Key%20Items%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Key Items&lt;/a&gt; are special items of importance. They are typically used to unlock doors, interact with NPCs, or complete certain quests. The &lt;a href=\"Dull%20Ember\"&gt;Dull Ember&lt;/a&gt;, for example, will allow the player to access &lt;a href=\"Steady%20Hand%20McDuff\"&gt;Steady Hand McDuff&lt;/a&gt; as a blacksmith when given to him.\nMagic.\n includes &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Sorcery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Pyromancy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Miracles%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Miracles&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hexes\"&gt;Hexes&lt;/a&gt;.

If playing as a DEX build and the Rapier is a go to weapon of choice, then perhaps the Espada Ropera should be swapped since it has higher potential for that build in particular and it has almost double the durability of the Rapier, making it a more attractive choice for regular PVE.\nIt also has 5 more points of damage than the Rapier when fully upgraded.\nAdditionally, the Espada Ropera (along with the Rapier) is also very good for use in &lt;a href=\"Power%20Stance\"&gt;power stance&lt;/a&gt; when it is wielded in the right hand as one will be able to use the strong attack to parry, which can't normally be done while in a power stance."}

The Estoc has the longest reach of all the thrusting swords; in addition, it has a slashing-like attack that deals &lt;a href=\"Regular%20%28Damage%20Type%29\"&gt;Regular Damage&lt;/a&gt;. The Estoc's good reach makes it a flexible weapon. While the Estoc's\u00a0weak attack is slightly slower than those of the other rapiers, it still has a relatively good attack speed.\nAlthough the in-game stat menus show the Estoc having a 100 critical rate, the Estoc benefits from a higher &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;motion value&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Backstab\"&gt;Backstabs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte\"&gt;Ripostes&lt;/a&gt; making it deal higher damage on these critical attacks like all of the other Thrusting Swords. \nThe Estoc's greatest weakness lies in its relatively sluggish\u00a0weak attack\u00a0combos, making it harder to really rack up damage against nimble opponents.

As this weapon hits very quickly, Estoc users can easily &lt;a href=\"stunlock\"&gt;stunlock&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"poise%20break\"&gt;poise break&lt;/a&gt; their opponents. This makes it one of the best thrusting swords for &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is notable for being the only &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;-oriented rapier in the game, attaining a B-scaling in Strength when fully &lt;a href=\"Upgrade%20Materials%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;reinforced&lt;/a&gt;."}

It cannot be used as a &lt;a href=\"Parry%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt; tool, removing an extra layer of utility that a normal Rapier could normally have, and doesn't have an increased &lt;a href=\"critical%20attack\"&gt;critical attack&lt;/a&gt; modifier, making it a poor choice for &lt;a href=\"riposte\"&gt;riposte&lt;/a&gt;s.\nUpgrades.\nReinforced with &lt;a href=\"Upgrade%20Materials%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Titanite&lt;/a&gt;."}

Four of these can be found scattered throughout the world, but the other three must be obtained by killing the firekeepers to claim their souls (or in the case of &lt;a href=\"Anastacia%20of%20Astora\"&gt;Anastacia of Astora&lt;/a&gt;, obtaining her soul from &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Lautrec%20of%20Carim\"&gt;Lautrec&lt;/a&gt; after he kills her).\nNotes.\nFirekeeper souls are very rare (only 7 can be found per playthrough, and three are held by NPCs that the player may not want to kill or let die) and, though they can be consumed for &lt;a href=\"Humanity%20Mechanic\"&gt;humanity&lt;/a&gt;, they are usually better spent upgrading estus flasks. Upgrading estus flasks dramatically improves the player's ability to heal him or herself. For example, a player with twenty +7 Estus Flasks can heal up to 10,000 more &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; in total than a player with twenty non-upgraded Flasks.\n&lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;s of all types cannot rely on estus flasks for healing. However, they can still rely on all other healing items and spells, such as the Heal miracle, consuming solid humanity, etc. Friendly phantoms (not including NPC) are healed by estus whenever their host player uses one.\nPlayers hit by a &lt;a href=\"Lloyd%27s%20Talisman\"&gt;Lloyd's Talisman&lt;/a&gt; will not be able to drink estus for a limited duration.\nSome enemies, such as &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Soldier\"&gt;Hollow Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Balder%20Knight\"&gt;Balder Knight&lt;/a&gt;s, can also use Estus flasks for healing.\nBackstory.\nEstus are fondly treasured by the undead. Oscar names it \"an undead favorite\". On the other hand, the living are not cordial about Estus. The undead hunter &lt;a href=\"Lloyd\"&gt;Lloyd&lt;/a&gt; created &lt;a href=\"Lloyd%27s%20Talisman\"&gt;Lloyd's Talisman&lt;/a&gt;s to aid in his extermination of the undead, which block the healing ability of estus."}

In addition, the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Estus%20Flask\"&gt;Ashen Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt; can be picked up a short distance into the tutorial area, granting an overall total of four charges. Drinking from the flask restores &lt;a href=\"Hit%20Points%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; (the Ashen Estus Flask restores &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt;). Resting at a &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt; will refill all Estus Flasks to maximum charges.\nTo increase the number of Estus Flask charges, the player must first find an &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Shard\"&gt;Estus Shard&lt;/a&gt; and bring it to &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20Andre\"&gt;Blacksmith Andre&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt;, where they will also be able to allot the total number of uses between the standard and the ashen Estus Flasks. The combined total between both Estus Flasks can reach a maximum of 15 charges. Any additional Estus Shards obtained &lt;a href=\"New%20Game%20Plus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;afterward&lt;/a&gt; will have no practical use, since they cannot be sold.\nThe potency of each charge can be increased by burning an &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Bone%20Shard\"&gt;Undead Bone Shard&lt;/a&gt; at the Firelink Shrine bonfire, for up to a maximum level of +10. As with Estus Shards, any additional Undead Bone Shards obtained will have no practical use.\nEquipping the &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Ring\"&gt;Estus Ring&lt;/a&gt; will increase the amount of HP recovered by consuming Estus by 20%.\nUpgrades.\nThe Estus Flask can be reinforced by burning an &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Bone%20Shard\"&gt;Undead Bone Shard&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29%23Bonfires\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;, for up to a maximum level of +10.\nEstus Soup.\nThroughout the game, the player may come across a few pots and cauldrons cooking estus soup. Consuming the soup will restore 535 &lt;a href=\"Hit%20Points%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;, and is subject to modification by equipping the &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Ring\"&gt;Estus Ring&lt;/a&gt; or being debuffed by the &lt;a href=\"Soldering%20Iron\"&gt;Soldering Iron&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese containers will refill each time an area is loaded, so if the player has already depleted one and does not want to rest at a &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt; in order to avoid repopulating the area, all they have to do is exit and continue the game, and the pot will be replenished with a new dose. Sitting at a bonfire will not refill the pot.\nEstus soup containers can be found in the following areas:"}

Upon killing the charioteer, the chariot's horse acts much like a &lt;a href=\"Fang%20Boar\"&gt;Fang Boar&lt;/a&gt; from the original \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn \"Scholar of the First Sin\", a chariot horse can be found in &lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Castle\"&gt;Drangleic Castle&lt;/a&gt;, in the hall previously filled with &lt;a href=\"Alonne%20Knight%20Captain\"&gt;Alonne Knight Captain&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSummoning.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Scholar%20of%20the%20First%20Sin\"&gt;Scholar of the First Sin&lt;/a&gt; only, &lt;a href=\"Creighton%20the%20Wanderer\"&gt;Creighton the Wanderer&lt;/a&gt; can be recruited as a &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt; for this fight, once freed, and, if the player moves fast enough, the shade &lt;a href=\"Bashful%20Ray\"&gt;Bashful Ray&lt;/a&gt; may also join, which can help in keeping the skeletons at bay for a while.\nLore.\nThe Executioner's Chariot was created with the sole purpose of tormenting and punishing the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; during the hunts organized by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Iron%20King\"&gt;Old Iron King&lt;/a&gt;. Although the Executioner appears to be the master of the chariot, it's actually the horse that controls the machine and carries out its creator's will to torture the undead.\nFight overview.\nThere are two phases to this fight: the \"chariot\" phase and the \"horse\" phase.\nAs you enter the fog door, phase one begins. The chariot will circle around the arena and attempt to ram into you. This can be avoided by hiding in the openings along the walls, or with a well-timed roll. The corridor is littered with &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Skeletons&lt;/a&gt; that will continue to revive until the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Necromancers&lt;/a&gt;, which are hiding in the gaps along the walls, are killed. The chariot progressively loses speed the more damage it is dealt, giving you more time between its laps to deal with the skeletons and necromancers.\nThere are two methods of approaching the first phase. The first is to make your way around the corridor to the other side of the pit and pull the lever, which will lower a gate the chariot will crash into. The second method is to continually hit it with ranged attacks until it reaches 25% of its health. At this point, the chariot will be unable to clear the gap and fall. It will dangle off the ledge helplessly until it is hit one final time, which will cause it to lose its grip and tumble into the pit. This method skips phase two entirely.\nPhase two begins when the chariot bashes into the gate. The horse will be free as the chariot is completely destroyed and the charioteer is killed. The horse is very easy to fight and behaves similarly as the &lt;a href=\"Fang%20Boar\"&gt;Fang Boar&lt;/a&gt; from the first \"Dark Souls\". The horse has a charge attack where it bashes you with its head, this move is unblockable and does damage through your shield. If you linger behind the horse for too long, it will kick at you with its hind legs. If you are in front of it for too long, it will stand up on its hind legs and bash downwards on you. If you are at a medium distance away, the horse will spew a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; fog that is unblockable and does heavy damage through your shield.\nStrategy.\nPhase 1: The key here is to rush towards each of the two Necromancers and take them out before the Skeletons can catch up, avoiding the Chariot by hiding in alcoves as you go along. Bring a high stability shield if you can't run directly from one Necromancer to the other. Once the second Necromancer is killed, take out the Skeletons. Let the Chariot kill them if you wish. After the Necromancers and the Skeletons have been taken out, run to the lever and pull it.\nPhase 2: At the start of phase two, the horse will fall over. This is the perfect time to use magic or pyromancy that has a long cast time for big damage. You don't want the horse to hit you as it does heavy damage and can deal damage through shields.\nCircle around the horse and don't get too far away from it or it might use its breath attack which deals a lot of damage (but is easily dodged). Do not stay in front of the horse. Instead, stay behind it and try to bait it into kicking with its hind legs. Once it kicks and you successfully avoid it, move in quickly and hit the horse one or two times. The horse will then turn towards you and you should circle around it once again. You may also try to bait it into doing its front stomp attack or dodging its breath attack and then getting a few blows in. You don't want it to charge you as it is more difficult to dodge and can deal serious damage.\nAlternate strategy (ranged or magic users).\nAfter entering the arena, the player can choose to rush the first Necromancer and clean up the Skeletons, allowing the player to take cover in an alcove. Each time the chariot comes around, a well cast spell or a well timed arrow can deal damage to the chariot (a good spell to use is &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Crystal%20Soulmass%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Homing Crystal Soulmass&lt;/a&gt; or just a simple &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Soulmass%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Homing Soulmass&lt;/a&gt;. After casting, stand in one of the alcoves and wait). When the boss gets down to about 1/3 to 1/5 of its health, the chariot will stop circling the arena, most likely surprising the player.\nContinuing around the arena, clearing out the remaining Necromancer and Skeletons, the player will notice that the chariot is being held above the pit by the two horses, while the charioteer dangles helplessly underneath. The player can now freely kill the boss without any resistance. A single attack will send the chariot tumbling into the abyss, finishing the boss fight.\nIf you are having trouble catching the Chariot as it goes by, try using a spell that shoots straight (like &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Lightning Spear&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Soul Spear&lt;/a&gt;). Stand by one of the alcoves near the entrance to the boss fight and shoot it down the hall when you see the Chariot come around the corner. After you shoot it, you have plenty of time to dodge into the alcove. You can also use the binoculars if you like.\nAlternate strategy (melee).\nA version of the above strategy is also available for melee builds. Proceed as normal, working your way up the arena, and killing the two Necromancers, letting the chariot take care of the Skeletons (&lt;a href=\"Alluring%20Skull%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Alluring Skulls&lt;/a&gt; work well here). Once you kill the last Necromancer, instead of pulling the lever, wait for the chariot to pass and run to the edge of the pit. Stand with your back against the right hand wall, facing the opposite wall, and as close to the edge of the pit as you can safely be. Since the chariot is jumping, it cannot hit you here. Each time it lands you can take a swing at it, and whittle down its health bar. This works with most weapons, but a weapon with a wide swing is better as locking on is a very bad idea. The timings will vary, so some experimentation will be necessary. As an example, a &lt;a href=\"Greatsword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; R1, triggered the instant the boss jumps will always connect and do decent damage.\nThis strategy will end the same way as the caster version. Once the bosses health is low enough, it will miss the jump and end up hanging off the pit. Walk up and hit it once to finish the fight.\nAttacks.\nDefenses(Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 Executioner's Chariot by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFujXVMAahU&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

A small enclosed area with several corpses and some loot can be found, one of which is the sword. Upon picking it up, however, the &lt;a href=\"Reanimated%20Corpse\"&gt;corpses&lt;/a&gt;, some of which are &lt;a href=\"Infested%20Corpse\"&gt;infested&lt;/a&gt;, will come to life and ambush the player.\nCharacteristics.\nDespite its relatively mundane appearance, the Executioner's Greatsword possesses several quirks that can make it a strong asset in one's arsenal.\nPossessing the same moveset as the &lt;a href=\"Bastard%20Sword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bastard Sword&lt;/a&gt;, the Executioner's Greatsword also has the advantage of inflicting purely strike damage with its attacks, which is typically resisted very poorly by the vast majority of all armor sets in the game. As well, it &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;scales&lt;/a&gt; very well with &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, further augmenting its ability to deal tremendous amounts of damage against opponents. It is also only one of two greatsword-class weapons that possess the &lt;a href=\"Stomp%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;Stomp (disambiguation)&lt;/a&gt; weapon art, the other being the Bastard Sword, which gives it some very useful &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt; options.\nPerhaps its most unique characteristic is that for every enemy that dies, the wielder gains 6 &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt;. This can be useful for fueling the use of the weapon's &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;, or even for casting spells on specialized builds. It is particularly useful in &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, as there is no requirement that the wielder use the weapon to kill enemies in order to replenish FP, or that the wielder even has to be the one to obtain the kill. This is very useful since non-&lt;a href=\"Host%20of%20Embers\"&gt;host&lt;/a&gt; players can recover FP without having to allot &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Estus%20Flask\"&gt;Ashen Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt;s, allowing them to utilize more standard Estus, and invaders can recover FP by profiting off of the work of a host's party.\nMoveset.\n&lt;br&gt;\nUpgrades.\n&lt;br&gt;\nVideos.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

This was not only because he took pleasure in his brutal work, making him eerily gleeful, but because he also ground the bones of his victims into his own feed to absorb them, while his hammer became capable of restoring health with attacks thanks to its continued use in his work.\nAt some point after Gwyn linked the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Nameless%20King\"&gt;Gwyn's firstborn son&lt;/a&gt; was dethroned and exiled, nearly all of the deities abandoned Anor Londo together and moved to an unknown location but Smough remained in the forsaken city alongside &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Slayer%20Ornstein\"&gt;Dragon Slayer Ornstein&lt;/a&gt; to guard the cathedral where &lt;a href=\"Gwynevere%2C%20Princess%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Gwynevere&lt;/a&gt; resided.\nTogether, these two powerful warriors would become the last ritual challenge for the potential &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, the Undead who tried to follow in Gwyn's footsteps to sacrifice themselves to the Flame would have to be tested even before obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Lordvessel\"&gt;Lordvessel&lt;/a&gt; and seeking powerful souls. Ringing the &lt;a href=\"Bells%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Bells of Awakening&lt;/a&gt; represents only the first of these challenges, and success means gaining access to &lt;a href=\"Sen%27s%20Fortress\"&gt;Sen's Fortress&lt;/a&gt; to be tested further. The Undead who manage to overcome the tests and dangers of the fortress and defeat the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt; would manage to access the city of the gods. Once they managed to enter the cathedral of Anor Londo to try to obtain the Lordvessel they would still be challenged by Smough and Ornstein, to ensure that only the strongest of the strongest Undead could have an audience with Gwynevere.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter centuries of waiting for the Chosen Undead without success, Ornstein grew tired of his duty and left the cathedral in search of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Nameless%20King\"&gt;Nameless King&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, the last remaining guard was Smough, who continued to hold his post and protect \"Gwynevere\". As a reward for his loyalty, Gwyndolin finally granted him the title of \"knight,\" even if he was the last one left in Anor Londo after all others had abandoned it. As the cathedral's sole guardian, Smough met his end when a worthy Undead reached Anor Londo and defeated him, gaining an audience with \"Gwynevere\" and the Lordvessel with which to begin their search for powerful souls.\nSmough's &lt;a href=\"Smough%27s%20Great%20Hammer\"&gt;ritual hammer&lt;/a&gt; was preserved as a relic by Gwyndolin and protected in his manor when &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt; rose from the ruins of Anor Londo."}

One wields an &lt;a href=\"Exile%20Greatsword\"&gt;Exile Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; whilst the other uses a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Club%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Great Club&lt;/a&gt; and can cast healing &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation.\nFound in the &lt;a href=\"Road%20of%20Sacrifices\"&gt;Road of Sacrifices&lt;/a&gt;, near the ladder that leads to the &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Keep%23Bonfires\"&gt;Farron Keep&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;. Only two appear in the game, one wielding a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Club%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;great hammer&lt;/a&gt; and the other a &lt;a href=\"Exile%20Greatsword\"&gt;greatsword&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoth Watchdogs guard the entrance to the old ruins that give access to the &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Keep\"&gt;Farron Keep&lt;/a&gt;. This structure dwells on the farthest shore of the marsh, on a stretch of dry land found to the right of the second &lt;a href=\"Great%20Crab\"&gt;Great Crab&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Great%20Club%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;club&lt;/a&gt;-wielder usually stands post near a small staircase at the entrance, and the &lt;a href=\"Exile%20Greatsword\"&gt;greatsword&lt;/a&gt;-wielder awaits inside, although in rare occasions he can be seen patrolling outside the ruins.\nStrategy.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Great%20Club%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;club&lt;/a&gt;-wielding Watchdog will usually approach the player first and it is recommended to lure him away from the ruins to avoid alerting the other. He is significantly slower with his attacks, although he can perform a leaping smash from long range. He will attempt to heal when low on HP but this can be interrupted as it takes a few seconds for the process to complete. Be wary of his &lt;a href=\"Target%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Target Shield&lt;/a&gt;, as it can be used for parrying. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Exile%20Greatsword\"&gt;curved greatsword&lt;/a&gt; warrior will primarily attack by performing his weapon's &lt;a href=\"Spin%20Slash%20%28Curved%20Greatsword%29\"&gt;Spin Slash&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;, leaving himself open to attack once he has finished. He will also occasionally buff himself for increased defense, although this can be interrupted with a &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, he may also take out a &lt;a href=\"Daggers%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;dagger&lt;/a&gt; and hold it in his left hand for quick-opening attacks. He may also try to kick the player frequently if they keep their shield up.\nIf the player uses an &lt;a href=\"Ember\"&gt;Ember&lt;/a&gt; in this area, they should be cautious when fighting the Watchdogs. Not only will members of the &lt;a href=\"Watchdogs%20of%20Farron\"&gt;Watchdogs of Farron&lt;/a&gt; invade if playing online, but &lt;a href=\"Yellowfinger%20Heysel\"&gt;Yellowfinger Heysel&lt;/a&gt; will also invade if the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Sage\"&gt;Crystal Sage&lt;/a&gt; has not yet been defeated. A careless or unlucky player could end up having to fight up to four powerful enemies at once.\nAlternatively, if you summon &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Knight%20Hodrick\"&gt;Holy Knight Hodrick&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"Mound-makers\"&gt;mad phantom&lt;/a&gt;, he can easily solo the two Watchdog NPCs, although be careful, as he can also attack you if you get close to him. Safely lure him to the NPCs and he can defeat them quickly.\nIf you do not wish to fight them via conventional means, then run up the stairs where they are first encountered and begin climbing down the ladder. Hang near the top and they will both likely fall to their deaths. Do not hang too close to the top or you can still be hit and knocked down the ladder, ensuring an instant death."}

A letter denoting a weapons specific scaling properties is noted beneath the weapon's required faith stat. The letters range in order of effectiveness from E, D, C, B, A, and S.\nWeapons and catalysts with an E rating for scaling will receive a poor benefit from investment in faith while weapons with an S rating receive the greatest benefit.\nNote: the term Catalyst refers to any medium used to cast spells.\nAs is with every other stat in the game, it also has indirect bonuses such as increasing the player character's flat damage absorption. In this case, Faith governs the players flat defenses against &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; damage.\nSoft caps.\nDepending on the catalyst, weapon and &lt;a href=\"Infusion%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;infusion&lt;/a&gt;, leveling Faith to certain thresholds will maximize its potency with those tools.\nMost weapons that inflict innate &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage, or which inflicts &lt;a href=\"Physical%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; damage based off Faith, such as the &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Greataxe\"&gt;Dragonslayer Greataxe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wolnir%27s%20Holy%20Sword\"&gt;Wolnir's Holy Sword&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Straight%20Sword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Sunlight Straight Sword&lt;/a&gt; will reach peak efficiency at 40 Faith; in a special case, this also applies to the &lt;a href=\"Crucifix%20of%20the%20Mad%20King\"&gt;Crucifix of the Mad King&lt;/a&gt;, which inflicts Dark damage scaling primarily from Faith. Weapons that have been infused with a &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Gem\"&gt;Lightning Gem&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20Gem\"&gt;Blessed Gem&lt;/a&gt; also soft-cap their respective damage types at 40 Faith.\nIf a weapon inflicts innate &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; or Dark damage, like the &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20Flame%20Spear\"&gt;Gargoyle Flame Spear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Hand%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark Hand&lt;/a&gt;, Faith will improve the respective elemental damage, alongside &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, to a soft-cap of 40 for each stat. For infusions with a &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Gem\"&gt;Chaos Gem&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Gem\"&gt;Dark Gem&lt;/a&gt;, the soft-cap becomes 30 Faith alongside 30 Intelligence.\n&lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Chimes%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Sacred Chimes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Talismans%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Talismans&lt;/a&gt; used for casting Miracles will see very strong returns from Faith investment. Almost all such catalysts require leveling Faith to a minimum of 18 before &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Buff\"&gt;Spell Buff&lt;/a&gt; begins to increase, and this continues to improve the strength of the catalyst up until 60 Faith is reached. For most Faith catalysts, the rate of Spell Buff improvement falls off after 45 Faith.\nFor catalysts that specialize in casting Pyromancies, Dark &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Sorceries&lt;/a&gt; and Dark Miracles, the scaling and soft-caps behave differently. As like their melee counterparts, &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20Flames%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Pyromancy Flames&lt;/a&gt; will improve up until 40 Faith is reached, alongside 40 Intelligence. For specialized Dark catalysts like the &lt;a href=\"Izalith%20Staff\"&gt;Izalith Staff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Caitha%27s%20Chime%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Caitha's Chime&lt;/a&gt;, this cap is instead 45 Faith and 45 Intelligence. &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Chime\"&gt;Crystal Chime&lt;/a&gt; also soft-caps at these values, however its scaling falls off noticeably past 30 Faith and 30 Intelligence."}

In particular, the scimitar has a much faster recovery with the one hand light attack versus the falchion's; for strong attacks, the falchion will hit twice while the scimitar thrice. In that sense, the falchion favors heavier damage per strike, while scimitar relies more on combo to deal damage.\nThe falchion also has innate bleed, making it somewhat a decent candidate for bleed infusion; though its moveset limits the weapon's combo ability.\nLike all curved swords, the falchion's attacks can somewhat be redirected, especially noting the one-hand and two-hand's second heavy attack. Light attacks for both stances are still direct-able, but limited mostly to the direction of the slashes."}

This is the basis of the \"heavy curved sword\" moveset shared by the more weighty of the curved swords, as the strong attacks and kick are more formidable against human opponents.\nIt is worthwhile to note that when infused with a &lt;a href=\"Sharp%20Gem\"&gt;Sharp Gem&lt;/a&gt;, the Falchion will greatly outperform most any other infusable curved sword under the same conditions, at very high levels of Dexterity.\nUpgrades.\nReinforced with ."}

Falconers have a shield stance where they will attempt to &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt; attacks.\nLore.\nFalconers are mercenaries that hail from the city of &lt;a href=\"Volgen\"&gt;Volgen&lt;/a&gt;. They are usually hired as bodyguards and do their job so effectively that nobody dares ask them about their past.\nStrategy.\nThese foes all come at the player at once, so dealing with them can prove troublesome. They don't have much &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt;, so it's best to strike them down before they can strike the player. They will use their falcons to attack and will completely bypass shields; however, their swords can be blocked.\nTheir moveset is very similar to that from &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Guard\"&gt;Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt;s, albeit much faster. They take time to recover once they finish a combo, which leaves them vulnerable afterward. Their individual attacks do not drain much &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; if blocked with a shield that has 100% &lt;a href=\"physical%20damage\"&gt;physical damage&lt;/a&gt; absorption and good &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe archer variant will switch to his sword if approached, although his speed will be notoriously slower than that of their natural swordsmen counterparts."}

Will attack from behind if the player continues onward, most likely while fighting the &lt;a href=\"Brigand\"&gt;Brigand&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nThe Fallen Knight can be very dangerous against unprepared players. His fighting methods are somewhat similar to &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Knight%20Hodrick\"&gt;Hodrick&lt;/a&gt;'s. He dwells hidden at the end of a slope located to the left of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep%23Bonfires\"&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt; upon arriving to the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Cathedral of the Deep&lt;/a&gt;, and is intended to surprise the player from the rearguard while they are engaging the &lt;a href=\"Brigand\"&gt;Brigand&lt;/a&gt;. Even alone, this enemy can be a major threat due to his advanced combat mechanics and high resilience.\nWhen he switches to his &lt;a href=\"Bandit%27s%20Knife%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;dagger&lt;/a&gt;, raise a &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; with good &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt;; upon hitting it, he will stagger and become open for a counterattack.\nHe frequently performs his sword's &lt;a href=\"Stance%20%28Straight%20Sword%29\"&gt;Stance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Break\"&gt;break the player's guard&lt;/a&gt;. If successful, he will mercilessly follow with a &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;riposte&lt;/a&gt;, which in many cases will mean the end of the battle. On the other hand, this attack is the key to defeat him easily. When he approaches with his sword wielded with both hands and pointing forward, lure him into attacking and retreat, making him miss and leaving him open for attack.\nHe often throws &lt;a href=\"Kukri\"&gt;Kukri&lt;/a&gt;s at the player, although he's prone to fall for these kinds of attacks too, so hurl back some throwable knives at him whenever the occasion opens."}

Like most other plate armor sets, it is somewhat weak to &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; damage.\nHowever, the compromised cloth parts of the armor render it vulnerable to &lt;a href=\"Slash%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Slash&lt;/a&gt; damage, something that the vast majority of plate armor sets are quite strong against, and has a particular vulnerability to &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; damage as well. It also has rather poor resistance to status effects, as it is comparatively easy to inflict &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; than with other plate armor sets.

After a short delay, they slam it to the ground, inflicting heavy damage to any enemy in front and knocking them down. The attack inflicts the weapon's full Attack Rating as damage upon impact, as well as a large area thundershock for 1.7 times the weapon's Lightning component.\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nThis skill is one of the most destructive single attacks in the game, allowing the wielder to bring immense power crashing down on any target in front of them. It has a relatively long windup, but is difficult to interrupt and deals damage in an area, which can fell groups of enemies should they congregate in front of the player. The windup means that it is best used against unaware or stationary targets, such as when sneaking up on an enemy or punishing a &lt;a href=\"Boss%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;boss's&lt;/a&gt; recovery frames after dodging their attack. While it drains immense stamina and &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt;, the knockdown allows it to be used on the same target repeatedly, which will almost assuredly guarantee killing anything the wielder sets their sights on. \nOnline gameplay.\nThe long windup of this skill makes it easy to roll through and punish with a backstab, so attempting to use it on a wary opponent is not recommended. Catching another player from around a blind corner, or when they're distracted by an ally, can quickly turn the tables in an invasion due to the immense damage wrought by the axe."}

The spear will then be buffed with 80 Lightning damage for 35 seconds.\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nDue to the long windup of this skill, it is best used to begin a fight with the skill rather than trying to cast it in the midst of battle. Against an unaware enemy, they will take tremendous damage from the bolt, weakening them to be more easily cleaned up by the spear's attacks, moreso with the inclusion of the buff. After striking a foe with the bolt, the buff can be used to more easily defeat subsequent enemies when fighting a group.\nOnline gameplay.\nUnless the enemy player is distracted or otherwise unaware, hitting them with the bolt can be extremely unreliable. However, it is still a good way to begin an engagement as the buff will augment the spear's attack power and make it more effective in combat.\nThe upward thrust can be &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parried&lt;/a&gt;, oddly enough, though should an enemy be close enough to do so they will usually simply attack instead, as the skill does not provide a great amount of &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt;."}

The sword can be swung in quick succession repeatedly, as the &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt; cost is very minimal, and the slashes are relatively-quick to cast and can chain together effectively.\nWith a high pool of &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, the damage of each slash can be on par with what a &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Gem\"&gt;Crystal&lt;/a&gt;-infused straight sword is capable of.

This should be taken into consideration before engaging an enemy that can parry the caster or dons a &lt;a href=\"Parry%20%28skill%29\"&gt;parrying&lt;/a&gt; shield.\nNotes.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

Just as the Abyss Watchers do, they will fight with each other whenever one of them is corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt;.\nTypes.\nThere are four different types of Farron Followers:\nFollower Lancer.\nThe most common Follower. This enemy wields the &lt;a href=\"Follower%20Javelin\"&gt;Follower Javelin&lt;/a&gt; and will spend most of their time throwing javelins at the player from range. Their high aggro range means that unless the player is aware of their presence, the first warning that a Lancer nearby is a spear striking them.\nFollower Knight.\nThis Follower wields a &lt;a href=\"Follower%20Javelin\"&gt;Follower Javelin&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Follower%20Shield\"&gt;Follower Shield&lt;/a&gt;. They will generally run into melee range to attack the player with their spear, using their shield to block incoming attacks.\nFollower Torchman.\nThis enemy wields a &lt;a href=\"Follower%20Torch\"&gt;Follower Torch&lt;/a&gt;, using the weapon art to breath fire at the player in arcs. He can also scream to alert other Followers once he is alerted to the player's presence.\nFollower Swordsman.\nThis Follower wields a &lt;a href=\"Follower%20Torch\"&gt;Follower Torch&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Follower%20Sabre\"&gt;Follower Sabre&lt;/a&gt;. He will not use his torch's skill but will attack with fast and fluid combos using the sabre.\nLocations.\nFarron Followers can be found in multiple locations throughout the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Painted World of Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;. They are initially encountered in the Snowfield area shortly after arriving in Ariandel, and later in larger numbers in the Snowy Mountain Pass.\nLore.\nThe Farron Follower were a group affiliated with Farron's Undead Legion, whose core were the &lt;a href=\"Abyss%20Watchers\"&gt;Abyss Watchers&lt;/a&gt;, and performed an essential function for them. In fact, the warriors of Farron could have been corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt; they fought and to which they were exposed and consequently the Followers had the task of hunting them down, even before they lost their human aspect and just showed traces of being infected. For this reason the group developed equipment and techniques suited to the role. The Followers would hunt the corrupted warriors in groups, surrounding them and then engaging their target while they shielded themselves with &lt;a href=\"Follower%20Shield\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; imbued with resistance to the Dark.. They would then fight their enemies thrusting their &lt;a href=\"Follower%20Javelin\"&gt;spears&lt;/a&gt; to keep the distance or in close combat with &lt;a href=\"Follower%20Sabre\"&gt;sabres&lt;/a&gt;. On a final command, they would have hurled their spears at their fallen foe, to give the retired warrior an honorable send-off, implying that their role was nevertheless charged with importance to the continued functioning of the Undead Legion and respect for their members even when they fell to the Dark. The Followers also used &lt;a href=\"Follower%20Torch\"&gt;offensive torches&lt;/a&gt; to purge the Abyss that manifested inside the bodies in the form of &lt;a href=\"Pus%20of%20Man\"&gt;Pus&lt;/a&gt;, treating it with fire as was ancient tradition.\nHowever at some point the Abyss Watchers were called to become &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lords of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;, sacrificing their shared power in the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20the%20Blood%20of%20the%20Wolf\"&gt;wolf blood&lt;/a&gt; to link the fading &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; and then be buried with a fragment of its &lt;a href=\"Cinders%20of%20a%20Lord\"&gt;cinders&lt;/a&gt; still burning. Over time, the land of &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Keep\"&gt;Farron&lt;/a&gt;, where the bodies of countless warriors of the past were buried, fell into ruin and became a rotten and poisonous forest, and the remaining acolytes of the Undead Legion were corrupted along with it becoming &lt;a href=\"Ghru\"&gt;Ghru&lt;/a&gt;s. The Farron Followers consequently had lost their role and reason to exist along with their home and became forlorns, unwanted souls that died and survived as a wandering pack of &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;Hollow&lt;/a&gt;s. They kept drifting aimlessly until they were eventually drawn into the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Painted World of Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;, where they were welcomed by the other lost souls and found refuge.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; continued to fade and &lt;a href=\"Lothric%2C%20Younger%20Prince\"&gt;Prince Lothric&lt;/a&gt; refused to link it, the Lords of Cinder of the past were exhumed from their graves to once again be used as fuel. Among them the Abyss Watchers rose from their graves too but refused to sacrifice themselves to link the Fire again, choosing to return to their Keep in Farron. However, the Followers were no longer present to cull the warriors that would become corrupted by the Abyss, consequently forcing the Watchers to do so themselves, wasting their strenght to kill each other to limit the spreading of corruption.\nStrategy.\nCare must be taken when engaging the Farron Followers, as while they are not very strong individually, they tend to swarm and overwhelm the player with their numbers. It is important to try to single out weak or vulnerable Followers and kill them quickly, in order to avoid being overpowered by the others. All Followers have very little &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; and little health, and as such they will typically fall in a few hits and can be stun-locked.\nThe Lancers can be defeated before aggro-ing the others with good ranged attacks, such as with a bow. Their projectiles are not hard to dodge, but their greatest danger lies in hitting the player with their spears in the midst of combat with other Followers, staggering them at inopportune times. They also pose very little threat at close range, and it can be relatively easy to roll through a projectile and then bear down on the Lancer before he can ready another one.\nKnights pose a danger more with their shields than with their attacks. Their shields can deflect a player's attacks if using smaller weapons like &lt;a href=\"Straight%20Swords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Straight Swords&lt;/a&gt;, leaving them wide open for retaliation. This can prove problematic when embroiled in melee combat with different Follower types, as swinging wildly can cause the player's strikes to deflect at inconvenient moments. It is best to either avoid directly engaging them until other serious threats have been dealt with, or eliminate them immediately with a guard break followed by a riposte.\nTorchmen can deal a tremendous amount of damage if they can get within range to use their torches. They will generally breathe flames in streamed arcs, weaving back and forth in an attempt to hit the player multiple times in a single attack. If threatened at melee range, they will often breathe fire while backing away, in an attempt to avoid being caught by the player's attacks. The best way to deal with Torchmen is to roll through their initial fire stream and hit them with a rolling attack to stagger them and interrupt them, and then continue attacking until they are dead.\nSwordsmen will move aggressively on the player and chain together multiple slashes with their sabres. The best way to eliminate them is to block their attacks with a shield, and then strike when they are recovering."}

It is one of the lightest weapons in the ultra greatsword category, and its attacks consume very little stamina for its class. Its attacks can deal solid damage, making it a powerful weapon in the right hands.\nFunctioning similarly to &lt;a href=\"Paired%20Weapons\"&gt;Paired Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, two-handing will equip the dagger in the off-hand, yielding unique attack combos and allowing the wielder to &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt; with the dagger. The dagger combos can yield strong stun-locking potential, while also providing the wielder with strong offensive momentum and wide sweeping attacks. However, the inability to hold the weapon in both hands is also a crucial flaw, as all attacks performed by this weapon short of the jumping attack can be parried, a disadvantage that is not shared by any other ultra greatsword.\nAs with the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Knight%27s%20Greatsword\"&gt;Wolf Knight's Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;, the Farron Greatsword deals bonus damage to enemies rooted in the &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt;. This makes it particularly strong against enemies such as &lt;a href=\"Darkwraith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Darkwraiths&lt;/a&gt; and numerous foes in &lt;a href=\"The%20Ringed%20City\"&gt;The Ringed City&lt;/a&gt;, including the first phase of &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Knight%20Gael\"&gt;Slave Knight Gael&lt;/a&gt;."}

His head is disproportionately small by comparison to his body, and his limbs are long and thin. He has a deep Scottish accent. Before unlocking the path to him, the sound of him striking himself with his flail can be heard at intervals.\nHe is bound and tied to a chair where he sinks his head inside a large &lt;a href=\"Lordvessel\"&gt;Lordvessel&lt;/a&gt;-like bowl, which he uses as a weapon.\nLore.\nFather Ariandel is the keeper of the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Painted World of Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;, thought to have been the most recent one to restore it after the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariamis\"&gt;Painted World of Ariamis&lt;/a&gt; rotted away. When he met the &lt;a href=\"Unkindled\"&gt;Unkindled&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Friede\"&gt;Sister Elfriede&lt;/a&gt;, she convinced him to forgo the destruction of his rotting world, and to stifle the flame that would burn it to be replaced by a new world by the next restorer, choosing to rot together \nHe constantly flails himself, bleeding onto the flame, to prevent the fire from burning his world, for he used blood in the restoration, and only that blood could prevent the fire from blazing again. When Friede's blood flows to the bowl containing the flame, the sight of her corpse enrages Father Ariandel, causing him to break free and strike the bowl against her unkindled blood to spark the flame and revive her by restoring her ember as an unkindled.\nOnce he dies, he declares the prophecy of the two ash and the flame fulfilled, and even after they both die, it stays burning strong.\nLocation.\nFather Ariandel is located in the Painted World of Ariandel, inside the &lt;a href=\"Ariandel%20Chapel\"&gt;Ariandel Chapel&lt;/a&gt;.

If the player does not have the required stats, he will dismiss them and request to be left alone. If the player speaks to him with Intelligence and Faith levels at 20, he will give you the &lt;a href=\"Hexer%27s%20Set\"&gt;Hexer's Set&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Sunset%20Staff\"&gt;Sunset Staff&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0He will still speak to the player if the player re-specs with a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Vessel\"&gt;Soul Vessel&lt;/a&gt;.\nFelkin has a prominent stammer.

He was on the verge of giving up his life of sorcery, when the Dark called to him, and he took up Hex magic. Ever since then, he has been deeply enthralled in the Dark and its teachings, and travels the land sharing his knowledge with anyone who could practice it."}

Trying to land another hit while she is recovering can be risky, as she may roll away, allowing her to retaliate with a quick barrage of attacks. To ensure a hit, the player may wait for her around a corner and attack her as she closes in, then find another corner where to hide in and repeat the process until she is defeated."}

They prevent trespassers from disturbing her slumber. Once the player defeats the Spears of the Church, they can enter the Filianore's chamber and touch the broken shell she is embracing. Doing so will awaken Filianore and transport the Ashen One to an endless, empty desert resembling that particular scene in the opening cinematic of the game, containing ruins of the Ringed City. While the exact nature of this location is unknown, Filianore's decayed corpse is found on the bed within her tower in the desert.\nDescription.\nFilianore is a large woman with long, dark hair. She wears long, white robes and a silver circlet. She rests eternally on a bed, embracing a cracked shell which resembles an egg.\nAfter the \"egg\" shatters, Filianore's body suddenly becomes worn and dry, with hollowed eyes and consumed appearance. \nLore.\nFilianore is the last daughter of &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt;. Her sacred symbol is a crest of young grass.\nUnlike the other deities who resided in &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Age of Fire&lt;/a&gt;, she did not live there. After having won the war against the dragons, her father Gwyn \"gave\" her as a gift to the &lt;a href=\"Pygmy%20King\"&gt;Pygmy Lords&lt;/a&gt; together with a &lt;a href=\"The%20Ringed%20City%20%28Location%29\"&gt;magnificent ringed city&lt;/a&gt; at the edge of the world. Before leaving her in the Ringed City, Gwyn promised her that he would come back for her some day.\nThroughout the millennia that followed in the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Age of Fire&lt;/a&gt;, the Pygmies continued to worship Filianore as a goddess, building a &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Filianore\"&gt;church in her name&lt;/a&gt; with her as the matriarch. Even the &lt;a href=\"Pygmy%20King\"&gt;Pygmy Lords&lt;/a&gt; who possessed the Dark Soul and ruled the city relied on her for salvation.\nAt a certain point Filianore would have fallen into a deep sleep hugging a &lt;a href=\"Vagrant\"&gt;Vagrant&lt;/a&gt; egg, causing the appearance of a space-time barrier that isolated the Ringed City from the effects of the fading of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; on the rest of the world. The order of the &lt;a href=\"Spears%20of%20the%20Church\"&gt;Spears of the Church&lt;/a&gt; would thus be founded, which would employ knights with the aim of protecting the princess's slumber when her church was compromised by a trespasser and maintaining the city's state of isolation and containing the Dark Soul within it, receiving &lt;a href=\"Filianore%27s%20Spear%20Ornament\"&gt;Filianore's Spear Ornament&lt;/a&gt;s as proof of the fulfillment of their duties."}

For weapons, this bonus value is expressed as blue text alongside the base attack value on the &lt;a href=\"Equipment%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Equipment&lt;/a&gt; Status screen in-game.\nThe Fire Attack Bonus value is determined by adding the &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt; stats together. This value is then multiplied by the Fire-scaling weapon, then added to the attack rating along with any other scaling. In order to continually increase innate Fire Attack Bonus, either Intelligence, Faith, or both need to be leveled up.\nThe cap for Fire Bonus is affected by the total number of points in Intelligence and Faith.

For information as to how these weapons are effected by Fire infusions, see\u00a0&lt;a href=\"%23Infusion\"&gt;this section&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoosting Fire Damage.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Clutch%20Ring\"&gt;Fire Clutch Ring&lt;/a&gt; can grant a bonus to Fire Attack when worn. The bonus granted from the ring can boost the Fire Attack value for both &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Pyromancies&lt;/a&gt; (via the &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20Flame%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Pyromancy Flame&lt;/a&gt;) and Fire weapons, but reduced &lt;a href=\"physical%20defense\"&gt;physical defense&lt;/a&gt;s.

If the weapon bears an innate Fire effect, the Fire damage value is boosted. The duration of both buffs is 90 seconds, and not dependent on any stat. Applying Fire buffs result in the weapon taking on an orange glow.\nUnlike weapon buffs, the damage &lt;a href=\"Firebomb%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Firebombs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Firebomb%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Black Firebombs&lt;/a&gt; deal scale based on the Fire Attack Bonus value.

A hidden Fire Defense stat of 100 points is always granted, regardless of character &lt;a href=\"Classes%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;. Fire Defense can be increased incrementally through leveling either &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt;. The Fire Defense value is determined by a total of the two stats. For example, if both skills total up to 50, Fire Defense will be set to 145 points. Innate Fire Defense caps at 200 points, when both stats are at 99.\nFire Defense cap.\nTotal Fire Defense is capped at 890 points. Combined with the hidden stat of 100 points, Fire Defense can reach a maximum of 990 points. Since 1000 points of any magical or elemental defense equals immunity, Fire Damage cannot be completely nullified, with the exception of blocking with a shield. For information on how to achieve this cap, see &lt;a href=\"%23Achieving%20the%20cap\"&gt;this section&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor and shields.\nVarious armor pieces grant varying levels of Fire Defense. The following armor table shows the armor pieces which grant the highest possible Fire Defense, for each body part. Curiously, &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Tooth%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dragon Tooth&lt;/a&gt; is unique in that it provides an additional 50 points of resistance to Fire when wielded. One can be wielded in each hand to provided twice the resistance.\nShields will only block Fire attacks if the player is actively blocking. Merely equipping the shield does not count towards defense. The Fire defense value on shields is expressed as a percentage in-game, as opposed to points on armor. The following shields table shows all shields that grant at least 75% reduction.\nWater.\nFire Defense can be increased by 300 points if the player is soaked wet or standing in &lt;a href=\"Water%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. Being wet is a &lt;a href=\"Negative%20Status%20Effects%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt; that lasts for a few moments, depending on how much water the player is covered in. It can occur by simply stepping in water, &lt;a href=\"rolling\"&gt;rolling&lt;/a&gt; through pots with water, or by wearing the &lt;a href=\"Pharros%20Mask\"&gt;Pharros Mask&lt;/a&gt;, which has a special effect that constantly soaks the player.\nItems and spells.\nCertain defensive spells can increase Fire Defense, with varying results, but they cannot be stacked with each other. Only one spell can be active at a time. &lt;a href=\"Small%20Orange%20Burr\"&gt;Small Orange Burr&lt;/a&gt;s are consumable items that can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Rosabeth%20of%20Melfia\"&gt;Rosabeth of Melfia&lt;/a&gt; for 1200 souls each. Small Orange Burrs cannot be stacked with any of the defensive spells either. Consuming a Small Orange Burr will remove the Fire Defense provided by the spell, and apply the Small Orange Burr defense value.\nRings.\nOnly two rings provide Fire Defense. Both can be worn together, granting a maximum of 270 Fire Defense, at the highest item level. Like all other rings, duplicate rings cannot be worn simultaneously.\nOther.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Tooth%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dragon Tooth&lt;/a&gt; is unique in that it provides an additional 50 points of resistance to Fire when wielded. One can be wielded in each hand to provided twice the resistance.\nLowering Defense.\nAn overall Fire Defense penalty can be incurred by equipping certain weapons:\nAchieving the cap.\nIn practice, raising Fire Defense to ~990 (or 99%) is achievable by combining several pieces of gear - albeit temporarily as a spell is required. This can be useful in situations when facing &lt;a href=\"Enemies%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; who deal very high levels of Fire Damage, such as the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Dragon\"&gt;Ancient Dragon&lt;/a&gt;. It is also useful for safely traversing across the lava covered rocks in &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Keep\"&gt;Iron Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe table illustrates how the cap can be reached using a combination of gear with high resistance, however other methods using a combination different armor, spells, or items is certainly possible.\nNote that the table does not take into account the player's displayed innate Fire DEF, which is a variable (between 0 - 200) based on the &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt; stats.\nInfusion.\n &lt;a href=\"Steady%20Hand%20McDuff\"&gt;Steady Hand McDuff&lt;/a&gt; can &lt;a href=\"infuse\"&gt;infuse&lt;/a&gt; most weapons with Fire through the use of a &lt;a href=\"Firedrake%20Stone\"&gt;Firedrake Stone&lt;/a&gt;. Once a weapon is infused, the Fire icon () will be displayed next to its image in the HUD.\nEnemies.\nThe following is a breakdown of enemies and &lt;a href=\"Boss%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; information relating to Fire damage and resistance. While the Fire resistances stated for enemies are the default values, they may appear higher in-game if the enemy comes into contact with &lt;a href=\"Water%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; or rain."}

She is a blind maiden of unknown origin; she was, at the time, the current &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Keeper\"&gt;Fire Keeper&lt;/a&gt; that tended to the flame when the Ashen One arrived at the Firelink Shrine to fulfill their duty. She dons a white crown that covers her eyes, and a black robe, as well as black gloves. Like all fire keepers, she can transform souls into raw power.\nShe allows the player to upgrade their &lt;a href=\"Stats%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stats&lt;/a&gt; individually in exchange for a determined amount of &lt;a href=\"Souls%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; per level.\nShe can also cure &lt;a href=\"dark%20sigil\"&gt;dark sigil&lt;/a&gt;s the player has accumulated either by leveling up with &lt;a href=\"Yoel%20of%20Londor\"&gt;Yoel&lt;/a&gt; or by taking part on the ritual in &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, she will also heal their &lt;a href=\"Hollowing%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;hollowing&lt;/a&gt; level, thus restoring their physical appearance, when provided with a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Keeper%20Soul%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire Keeper Soul&lt;/a&gt;. The cost for healing each dark sigil is directly related to the player's soul level.\nIf given the &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20a%20Fire%20Keeper\"&gt;eyes of the first Fire Keeper&lt;/a&gt;, she sees a world without fire, and is frightened by the mere thought of it. Even so, she is willing to end the cycle permanently if the Ashen One requests it. If the Ashen One chooses to realize her dream, she will be summoned to the &lt;a href=\"Kiln%20of%20the%20First%20Flame%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Kiln of the First Flame&lt;/a&gt;. At that time, she will hold the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; in her hands and let it die out, thus unlocking the &lt;a href=\"Endings%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29%23End%20of%20Fire\"&gt;End of Fire&lt;/a&gt; ending. If the Ashen One chooses to succumb to their desire, and kill her during the ritual; the power of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; would fall to their hands.\nThe Fire Keeper can also be talked to, and her dialogue changes throughout the course of the game.\nShe will psychically respond to most &lt;a href=\"Gestures%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;gestures&lt;/a&gt; performed by the player.\nIf killed, she will always respawn at Firelink Shrine, stating that as a Fire Keeper, she cannot die."}

Fire Surge has next to no starting or ending lag. Players can walk while casting this pyromancy. Each hit has a fire attack power of 0.55 times the Pyromancy Flame's magic adjust.\nOverview.\nIt is easy to run out of casts with this pyromancy without moderation; however, 80 casts is usually enough to last at least one or two engagements. It is not very popular in PvE as it does not stagger and its fairly low damage allows monsters to retaliate. In PvP, Fire Surge is occasionally popular for punishing slower opponents or finishing off players with low HP."}

As the FP drains much faster than the pyromancy actually hits, it is advisable to use this pyromancy in short bursts, or to catch an opponent off-guard, then follow up with a more robust pyromancy, such as &lt;a href=\"Great%20Combustion%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Great Combustion&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Bed%20Vestiges\"&gt;Chaos Bed Vestiges&lt;/a&gt;. It can also be used at close range to finish off opponents at low health.\nIt is able to stagger enemies, but is not recommended for use against heavily armed, or larger enemies. Additionally, it will always stun enemies that have unique fire damage stagger animations, such as &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Grub\"&gt;Corpse Grub&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Starved%20Hound\"&gt;Starved Hound&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Pus%20of%20Man\"&gt;Pus of Man&lt;/a&gt;, for the full duration. This makes it an effective tool for taking down these enemies when paired with more powerful means of attack.\nOnline gameplay.\nBecause of its quick casting time and the ability to immediately cancel out of it with a roll, this spell can be useful for inflicting small but quick chip damage. In particular, it is ideal for destroying &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Denial\"&gt;Tears of Denial&lt;/a&gt; users immediately upon proccing it, especially after a successful critical attack, as it is virtually impossible to avoid taking damage from this spell even by immediately rolling.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

A full cast of Fire Tempest will expend 17 of these \"uses\"; attempting to cast Fire Tempest again will result in a much weaker spell. Using Fire Tempest causes many (17 in a full cast) pillars of fire to erupt from the ground in a large area around the player. The spell has a fire attack power of 3.9 times the Pyromancy Flame's magic adjust and most enemies that get hit by it will be knocked back, possibly into another flame pillar.\nFire Tempest has a very long windup time that can be shortened through improving the Dexterity stat. Fire Tempest and its cousins also have a distinctive sound accompanying its casting, which makes it difficult to surprise human enemies with. It may be canceled or interrupted if the caster is hit, in which case not all 17 casts will be used. "}

Fire Whip may be cancelled or interrupted, which will result in only a portion of these 21 units being used. Casting Fire Whip at less than 21 units left will result in a reduced version of the spell.\nCasting Fire Whip causes a fairly short-range spray of fire to emit from the player, which has a fire attack power of 2.6 times the Pyromancy Flame's magic adjust. Fire Whip may hit multiple times. It has minor starting lag.\nFire Whip is surpassed by Chaos Fire Whip; however, it requires half the amount of &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Attunement&lt;/a&gt; slots and so may remain viable even in the late-game.\nOverview.\nDue to its high damage, Fire Whip is popular against &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;es. It is less popular against more numerous, weaker &lt;a href=\"enemies\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; due to the overkill damage and the increased likelihood of being interrupted.\nFire Whip is semi-popular in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; due to its high damage. No other pyromancy barring &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Fire%20Whip\"&gt;Chaos Fire Whip&lt;/a&gt; and the variants of &lt;a href=\"Firestorm\"&gt;Firestorm&lt;/a&gt; deal quite as much damage per second as Fire Whip, making it an excellent pyromancy to use against &lt;a href=\"stagger\"&gt;stagger&lt;/a&gt;ed or distracted opponents. It may be tricky to use against a mobile opponent, though."}
