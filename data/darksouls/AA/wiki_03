He is also the only one who must die by the player's hand in order for the story to progress. It is rumored his spear is powerful enough to cut a giant boulder in two.\nIt is implied that the Ornstein the Chosen Undead encounters is but a golem, and the real one left Anor Londo to search for the Nameless King. In Dark Souls 3 after encountering the Nameless King boss fight his armor can be found in the boss fight arena on Archdragon Peak implying that he did reach the Nameless King, however, it is not on a corpse, meaning he may have simply left it behind.\n&lt;a href=\"Artorias%20the%20Abysswalker\"&gt;Artorias the Abysswalker&lt;/a&gt;.\nArtorias had an unbreakable will of steel and his skill with greatswords was unmatched, making him a fierce opponent. Additionally, he was known as the first mortal to traverse the &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough\u00a0Artorias is only scarcely mentioned during the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt;'s journey to the &lt;a href=\"Kiln%20of%20the%20First%20Flame\"&gt;Kiln of the First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, he is one of the many obstacles the Chosen Undead encounters in &lt;a href=\"Oolacile\"&gt;Oolacile&lt;/a&gt;. Gravely injured and corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt; by the time he is encountered, Artorias still proves a formidable foe although the Chosen Undead eventually prevails. &lt;a href=\"Hawkeye%20Gough\"&gt;Hawkeye Gough&lt;/a&gt; will thank\u00a0the player\u00a0for setting\u00a0Artorias free with honor.\nArtorias' left arm is near useless due to being harshly damaged, presumably while protecting his companion, &lt;a href=\"Sif%2C%20the%20Great%20Grey%20Wolf\"&gt;Sif, the Great Grey Wolf&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0who fought alongside Artorias in the Abyss. Artorias saved Sif from corruption by using his &lt;a href=\"Cleansing%20Greatshield\"&gt;Greatshield&lt;/a&gt; to create a magic barrier around the wolf, shortly before\u00a0succumbing to the Abyss himself.\n&lt;a href=\"Lord%27s%20Blade%20Ciaran\"&gt;Lord's Blade Ciaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nLord's Blade Ciaran\u00a0was part of the Lord's Blades, a group of assassins in the employ of &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn&lt;/a&gt;. Known for her unique porcelain mask and annihilating Gwyn's enemies.\u00a0The &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt; encounters her grieving in the arena where they fought Artorias.\nSensing the presence of her &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20Artorias\"&gt;compatriot's soul&lt;/a&gt;, she requests the Chosen Undead to give it to her, so she may pay proper respect to Artorias.\n&lt;a href=\"Hawkeye%20Gough\"&gt;Hawkeye Gough&lt;/a&gt;.\nHawkeye Gough\u00a0was the only &lt;a href=\"Giant\"&gt;Giant&lt;/a&gt; of the Four Knights, and the leader of the Dragonslayers, the archers that fought the &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Ancients\"&gt;Age of Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the time the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt; meets him, Gough is blind. Upon their first encounter, he thanks the Chosen Undead for slaying Artorias, allowing the corrupted knight to die with his honor intact.\nDespite being blind, Gough was still a great sharpshooter. He proves this by shooting &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragon%20Kalameet\"&gt;Kalameet&lt;/a&gt; out of the sky, on the Chosen Undead's request. This allowed the Chosen Undead to fight the dragon on more equal footing, eventually leading to the latter's demise.\nDespite his skill, there were archers that rivaled even Gough. One such individual was &lt;a href=\"Pharis\"&gt;Pharis&lt;/a&gt; , which was especially impressive as Pharis\u00a0was only human.\nRings.\nEach of the Four Knights was gifted a unique &lt;a href=\"Rings%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt; imbued with special powers. The &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt; can find them scattered throughout &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt;, and their item descriptions give minor insight into who the knights were and what they did.\n&lt;a href=\"Leo%20Ring\"&gt;Leo Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nEngraved with a lion, the Leo Ring belonged to &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Ornstein\"&gt;Dragonslayer Ornstein&lt;/a&gt;. Boosting the power of &lt;a href=\"counter%20attack\"&gt;counter attack&lt;/a&gt;s, it befits Ornstein's skill with his &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Spear\"&gt;weapon of choice&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Ring\"&gt;Wolf Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nEngraved with a howling wolf, the Wolf Ring belonged to &lt;a href=\"Artorias%20the%20Abysswalker\"&gt;Artorias the Abysswalker&lt;/a&gt;. Improving the &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; of its wearer, it complemented Artorias' unbendable will.\n&lt;a href=\"Hornet%20Ring\"&gt;Hornet Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nEngraved with a hornet, the Hornet Ring belonged to &lt;a href=\"Lord%27s%20Blade%20Ciaran\"&gt;Lord's Blade Ciaran&lt;/a&gt;. Increasing the power of &lt;a href=\"critical%20attack\"&gt;critical attack&lt;/a&gt;s, it allows its wearer to lay waste to their foes much like how Ciaran did to &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Gwyn\"&gt;Lord Gwyn&lt;/a&gt;'s enemies.\n&lt;a href=\"Hawk%20Ring\"&gt;Hawk Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nEngraved with a hawk, the Hawk Ring belonged to &lt;a href=\"Hawkeye%20Gough\"&gt;Hawkeye Gough&lt;/a&gt;. Boosting the range of bows, it allows its wearer to loose arrows as if they were fired from Gough's own &lt;a href=\"Gough%27s%20Greatbow\"&gt;greatbow&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, it has many characteristics that solidify its position as one of the best in its class.\nWith its innate &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; damage, the Frayed Blade is capable of chipping down opponents through shields, something that most katanas have trouble with. Furthermore, its &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; provides it with unique offensive potential, as the shockwave can be used to hit opponents at range or catch them as they try to roll away, while the slash combo can inflict tremendous amounts of &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt; build-up on an unprotected target or powerful stamina damage if blocked. In the hands of an aggressive player, the Frayed Blade is truly a force to be reckoned with.\nHowever, it is also one of the heaviest katanas in the game, and has very low durability much like the &lt;a href=\"Washing%20Pole%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Washing Pole&lt;/a&gt;. Care should be taken when using this weapon, and carrying &lt;a href=\"Repair%20Powder%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Repair Powder&lt;/a&gt; may be useful on extended forays.\nMoveset.\nMoveset is identical to that of the &lt;a href=\"Uchigatana%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Uchigatana&lt;/a&gt;, however its weapon arts are unique."}

Additionally, the blade is imbued with &lt;a href=\"Frost\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt;, making it the only reaper in the game that builds up Frostbite without having to buff it, as well as one of only four weapons in the game with innate Frost build-up on all of its attacks.\nThese advantages do not come without drawbacks, however. In order to wield the weapon, players must first invest a non-negligible amount of levels in &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt;, which makes the weapon more difficult to build for. Additionally, despite what is listed in the weapon's information, with its normal moveset it cannot inflict &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; damage at all. As such, in regular situations this reaper is little different from the &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Knight%20Great%20Scythe\"&gt;Pontiff Knight Great Scythe&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, all of this changes when utilizing the weapon's &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;, which is what truly sets this weapon apart from its peers. Entering the skill stance brings the support scythe to bear in the off-hand, allowing the completed weapon system to function like &lt;a href=\"Paired%20Weapons\"&gt;paired weapons&lt;/a&gt;. The primary scythe will inflict purely physical damage, &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt; primarily with the wielder's &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;, while the conjured support scythe will inflict purely Magic damage, scaling purely with the wielder's &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. While in this stance, the wielder gains &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt; on all attacks, allowing them to take to the offensive against foes.\nIn the right hands, Friede's Great Scythe is a powerful and well-balanced weapon that combines range, damage, Frostbite buildup and strong aggressive options into a single package. Care must be taken to utilize it properly, however, as any mistakes made using the weapon can have disastrous consequences.\nUpgrades.\n&lt;br&gt;\nDescription.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Official translation=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Care should be taken when attempting to use the skill in this way though, as it leaves the wielder completely open to attack.

{"id": "99005", "revid": "49243392", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=99005", "title": "Frozen Eleum Loyce", "text": "Frozen Eleum Loyce is a &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;location&lt;/a&gt; in .\nDescription.\nEleum Loyce lies in a large, snow covered valley. Tall pine trees grow among the scattered architecture. A citadel stands at the heart, atop a large outcropping of rock with numerous sharp turrets.\nLore.\nEleum Loyce is a land far to the north of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; with vast natural deposits of ivory ore. At some point in the distant past, a &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Chaos\"&gt;fragment&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, the source of the &lt;a href=\"Flame%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Flame of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; and seedbed of the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20%28lore%29\"&gt;Demons&lt;/a&gt;, survived from &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt; and drifted to settle underground in the region. It started to give birth to atrocities and monsters that cursed the region, leading people to flee in fear.\nNot long after, following the collapse of &lt;a href=\"Forossa\"&gt;Forossa&lt;/a&gt;, the highest ranking knight of its army abandoned his home and reached Eleum Loyce. The proud knight saw the suffering of the population and decided to devote himself to the protection of that great land. And so he took his crown as the new leader of the country and started to fight the raging Chaos thanks to his &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20the%20Ivory%20King\"&gt;powerful soul&lt;/a&gt; as their &lt;a href=\"Burnt%20Ivory%20King\"&gt;Ivory King&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ivory King thus trained his faithful &lt;a href=\"Knight%20of%20Eleum%20Loyce\"&gt;Eleum Loyce Knights&lt;/a&gt; and commanded them to strike down each malformed terror that arose from the Chaos and eventually managed to contain it underground. The Ivory King erected a &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Cathedral\"&gt;Grand Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; to appease and stem the Flame of Chaos directly above the opening leading to its &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Chaos\"&gt;infernal depths&lt;/a&gt; and around it he then built the fortress city of Eleum Loyce. The Garrison Ward was also built around the cathedral city as a protective wall to fend off the creatures of Chaos, and it was defended by the &lt;a href=\"Spellsword\"&gt;sorcerers&lt;/a&gt; and knights of Eleum Loyce\nWith the threat of Chaos temporarily contained the Ivory King was able to build his kingdom and he governed it as a true and ever-merciful monarch , dedicating himself to protecting his land and being the first to swing his sword in times of need. He curiously kept his countenance from his people and his Knights dutifully followed suit, never unhinging their helmets in public view. The kingdom of Eleum Loyce continued to exist with the aim of containing the Chaos and the terrors it generated and its knights became the devoted guardians of the land, delving valiantly into the depths even if that meant never to return. The Ivory King, who came into contact with the magical arts of the nearby Drangleic, also built &lt;a href=\"Rampart%20Golem\"&gt;Rampart Golem&lt;/a&gt;s and granted them life, charging them with the containment of the creatures of Chaos within the boundaries of the wall.\nAt some point &lt;a href=\"Alsanna%2C%20Silent%20Oracle\"&gt;Alsanna&lt;/a&gt; reached Eleum Loyce and became close to the Ivory King. She was in truth a fragment of the Dark Soul of &lt;a href=\"Manus%2C%20Father%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Manus, Father of the Abyss&lt;/a&gt;, that, despite the fact that he had been killed centuries in the past, had retained some of his will and power. Alsanna was born as the incarnation of Manus' fears and despite being a frightened and frail thing she managed to to coalesce once again absorbing the other humanities, and then obtain the shape of a human, with her own self-awareness. To sustain herself and seek more power, she sought the holders of magnificent souls, drawn to their awesome strenght. Alsanna thus sought the Ivory King to sustain herself and smother her innate fear and was accepted by him, quietly finding a place at the side of the leader of Eleum Loyce where he provided her comfort and she accepted Eleum Loyce as her home.\nIn addition the Ivory King was served by seven beasts infused with wondrous souls and each of them were conferred a specific duty. &lt;a href=\"Aava%2C%20the%20King%27s%20Pet\"&gt;Aava&lt;/a&gt; became the guardian of Alsanna as the King's beloved child while &lt;a href=\"Lud%2C%20the%20King%27s%20Pet%20%26amp%3B%20Zallen%2C%20the%20King%27s%20Pet\"&gt;Lud and Zallen&lt;/a&gt; were tasked with the mercy killing of exiles\nHowever the flames of Chaos would not be sated and the Ivory King was forced to use the power of his own soul to keep it at bay. Over time he was drained of his vigour and when he sensed the degradation of his power he decided to plunge into Chaos' heart in an attempt to reduce its flames alone . He decided to leave without a word to his subjects and left everything to Alsanna who had now found her place at his side, conferring a &lt;a href=\"Eleum%20Loyce\"&gt;sword inscribed with the name of the land to her&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, despite the remnants of his strong soul, even the Ivory King lost the battle against Chaos and was devoured by its flames, becoming an empty husk controlled by them.\nAfter their King was consumed by Chaos, many of Eleum Loyce's faithful knights decided to follow him and put him out of his misery, as his orders were to eliminate each malformed terror that arose from the flame, and they would thus not hesitate even it were their own leader. &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Fabian\"&gt;Sir Fabian&lt;/a&gt; led the loyal knights straight into the depths of the Old Chaos to exterminate its terrors one last time, however the mission proved to be a failure and not one of the selfless knights returned. The souls of the knights were taken by Chaos and corrupted, leading them to lose all sense of purpose and being, left in them driven only by the urge of expuning any who might disturb the flames, even if they were former compatriots. With their armor charred and burnt black by fire and still burning in agony they remained as empty shells controlled by the Chaos alongside their once-proud king. However a few woeful suls were able to sneak back home guided by the last faint vestige of self.\nAs a last resort to stem the advance of Chaos, the decision was made to \"flung open\" the ivory gates of the fortress of Eleum Loyce. Alsanna, as the heiress to her Lord's wishes and in reverence of the apocalypse, devoted herself and the power of her Dark Soul to a ritual in the hopes of appeasing the raging flame. As a result the entire land of Eleum Loyce grew cold and lifeless turning into a &lt;a href=\"Frigid%20Outskirts\"&gt;frigid expanse&lt;/a&gt;, in an attempt to freeze Chaos along together with the entire country, thus sacrificing it. The Knights of Eleum Loyce thus remained to watch over the Garrison Ward faithful to the King's final order of containing the Chaos and so did the Rampart Golems. The King's dutiful subjects waited patiently for his homecoming and the knights of Eleum Loyce for a new leader strong enough to guide them into Chaos, even as they were frozen over, while Alsanna remained in prayer inside the Cathedral over the depths to continue the ritual to keep the Chaos contained. To help the city oracle preserve the ritual, an order of priestesses was established that watched over their city. They replaced one of their birth eye with the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Priestess\"&gt;eye of the first of them&lt;/a&gt; to allow them to see even the most hidden things but returning it after their term was complete. The priestesses had an order of &lt;a href=\"Retainer\"&gt;Retainer&lt;/a&gt;s that attended to them with &lt;a href=\"Retainer%20Staff\"&gt;magical staff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Retainer%27s%20Short%20Sword\"&gt;swords&lt;/a&gt; but after many centuries of dutiful watch the priestesses were gone, leaving the retainer with no purpose to wander the land.\nThus passed the centuries and, in the days of Drangleic, not one even remembered the very name of the Ivory King. Although Eleum Loyce remained isolated from the rest of Drangleic due to its forbidding climate and the desolation that surrounded it, a &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Winter\"&gt;magical shrine&lt;/a&gt; remained in the &lt;a href=\"Shaded%20Woods\"&gt;Shaded Woods&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Castle\"&gt;Drangleic Castle&lt;/a&gt; who was able to connect the two kingdoms via a portal, access to the city permitted through a &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Flower\"&gt;magical stone ornament&lt;/a&gt; kept by &lt;a href=\"Vendrick\"&gt;King Vendrick&lt;/a&gt; in his castle."}

They look very similar to the &lt;a href=\"Golem\"&gt;Golem&lt;/a&gt;s found in the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Want\"&gt;Throne of Want&lt;/a&gt;, having no heads and displaying a large hole in the center of their chests.\nLocation.\nMultiple Frozen Golems are found throughout the various structures that conform &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Eleum%20Loyce\"&gt;Eleum Loyce&lt;/a&gt; and start appearing after passing the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Wall\"&gt;Inner Wall&lt;/a&gt; bonfire. Initially, they are frozen in ice but once the player agrees to help &lt;a href=\"Alsanna%2C%20Silent%20Oracle\"&gt;Alsanna&lt;/a&gt;, they will come to life if they absorb the &lt;a href=\"Souls%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; of other enemies.\nSeveral can be found already active in a wooded area, prior to meeting one of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20Eleum%20Loyce\"&gt;Knights of Eleum Loyce&lt;/a&gt;.\nCombat.\nFrozen Golems have a rather large health pool and above average defenses and resistances. Their melee attacks are slow and easily telegraphed; however, they can deal a significant amount of damage to less armored players. They also possess a grab which, if successful, will deal extreme damage to the player as well as steal a considerable amount of &lt;a href=\"Souls%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; from them. In most instances, being caught by this grab will end up in the player dying.\nLike most construct enemies, the Frozen Golem appears to take less damage from &lt;a href=\"Slash%20%28Damage%20Type%29\"&gt;slashing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrust%20%28Damage%20Type%29\"&gt;thrusting&lt;/a&gt; and piercing attacks.\nFrozen Golems can also be damaged before being activated and will not retaliate if attacked. However, if a golem is killed while close enough to another, the souls it releases upon death will be absorbed by the second one, activating it. It is recommended to draw all other enemies away from an inactive golem before killing it, in order to prevent its activation.\nAttacks.\nKickThe golem gets close to the player and performs a kick which drains a great amount of &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;, leaving them open for further attacks.\nArm swingThe golem performs a powerful upward-diagonal swing with one of its arms which may follow with another swing from its other arm. It may delay the second swing, taunting the player into counterattacking prematurely.\nHand slamThe golem slams one of its hands on the ground and usually follows up by slamming the other hand too.\nGrabThe golem runs up to the player and grabs them with both hands. It then proceeds to lift them and starts projecting a bright light coming out from the hole on its chest, dealing extreme damage and stealing a considerable amount of &lt;a href=\"Souls%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nInactive golems are usually found in places where enemies abound, especially &lt;a href=\"Retainer\"&gt;Retainer&lt;/a&gt;s. Since they can be difficult to deal with, preventing their activation should be a priority. The player may attract the surrounding enemies' attention by using ranged attacks or by putting themselves as bait, making them give chase and driving them away from the golem.\nSince Retainers usually won't leave their designated locations, a good strategy is to get rid from the rest of the opposition first and then attack the golem itself while evading the Retainers' constant magic attacks. Another method is to unequip the player's current weapon (to deal as little damage as possible) and start punching the Retainer away from the golem.\nWhen facing an already activated golem, playing defensively is advised for melee builds. A strong weapon that can deal &lt;a href=\"Strike%20%28Damage%20Type%29\"&gt;strike&lt;/a&gt; damage and that is infused with &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; (dealing 15% more damage) is recommended. Spellcasters should have an easier time against these creatures since they can deal high amounts of damage to the golem from a safe distance while it slowly approaches.\nIn areas where there are many inactive golems gathered together (like the trio guarding the chest with the &lt;a href=\"Curved%20Nil%20Greatsword\"&gt;Curved Nil Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;), the player may attack each golem individually until they all have very little health left and then use a weapon with a wide attack range, like an &lt;a href=\"Ultra%20Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;ultra greatsword&lt;/a&gt;, to finish them all at once, preventing them from activating.\nEven if they are slow, Frozen Golems should not be underestimated; their attacks are surprisingly fast and deal high amounts of damage. It is recommended to use a shield that provides 100% &lt;a href=\"Physical%20Damage\"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; resistance and that has good &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt;, and not trying to block with a weapon. The monster should always be allowed to attack first, then the player may counterattack. Golems generally connect no more than two hits per attack and usually take a few seconds to recover, which the player should take advantage of to deal some damage.\nMemorizing their attack patterns is also very useful, since the player can then predict their range, speed and recovering time to plan a strategy accordingly. Golems like to delay their subsequent attacks, trying to catch the player by surprise by making them think they have finished attacking, especially when performing their arm swings."}

{"id": "67857", "revid": "46302766", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=67857", "title": "Fume Knight", "text": "The Fume Knight (\u7159\u306e\u9a0e\u58eb, \"Kemuri no kishi\", \"Knight of Smoke\"), also known as Raime the Traitor and Rebel Raime, is a &lt;a href=\"Boss%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; in ' and '.\nLore.\nRaime was one of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt;'s most distinguished knights. He used his favorite bird, the black raven, as his sigil. He was considered by &lt;a href=\"Vendrick\"&gt;Vendrick&lt;/a&gt; as his left arm and was one of his most trusted advisors along with &lt;a href=\"Velstadt%2C%20the%20Royal%20Aegis\"&gt;Velstadt&lt;/a&gt;. However, he eventually clashed with Velstadt and was deemed a traitor by Vendrick.\nHaving decided to leave Drangleic behind, Raime roamed the lands as a knight without purpose until his travels led him to the haunted Brume Tower where he found a child of dark &lt;a href=\"Nadalia%2C%20Bride%20of%20Ash\"&gt;Nadalia&lt;/a&gt;. In her however, he found a new purpose as well as the figure his previous lord was unable to provide. Instead of expunging the black fog, he embraced it and became her loyal guardian and champion. In return for his service as well as company in solitude, Raime was entrusted with a fragment of her soul which haunted his blade. As the Fume Knight, Raime would remain at his post to guard his new master from intruders, for so long that even he was buried under the ash.\nAttacks.\nBackward Slash: Used when the player is standing to Raime's right or left. He will quickly slash down and back with either his greatsword or the longsword, always using the weapon on the side where the player is standing. Very little tell, can be difficult to dodge. He will do the same move when in his second phase as well, only this time it is more powerful with a higher starting lag.\nFour-hit combo: Raime will use the longsword in a three-hit combo, likely draining a lot of stamina if blocking and possibly guard-breaking the player. This can be dangerous as he can follow up the longsword attacks with a long, slow horizontal greatsword slash that deals high damage.\nOverhead Smash: The Fume Knight brings his greatsword over his head then slams it down in a vertical smash. This attack does not track well and is easily avoided, allowing the player to counterattack. This also makes his greatsword crack stopping him from transitioning into the second phase. The effect lasts for 20 seconds and can be baited by using an item behind him such as an Estus Flask\nLunge: If the player has put some distance between his/herself and the Fume Knight, the knight will quickly charge the player and execute a lunge attack. This attack has a very obvious tell and is easily dodged by &lt;a href=\"rolling\"&gt;rolling&lt;/a&gt; to the right or left. Presents an excellent opportunity to counter. He will also perform this attack in his second phase, though it remains easy to avoid.\nFire sword: Second phase only. Raime will slowly swing his sword from the player's left to right, trailing fire in a small arc roughly 270 degrees around himself. Highly damaging, as this attack does both &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; damage, even the Gyrm Greatshield will not be able to fully block the flame's damage. Can be rolled under with precise timing, or avoided by standing back some distance (roughly the length of the greatsword) from the knight. Difficult to dodge due to its deceptively slow swing time. Can easily be dodged by rolling left into the attack as soon as the attack animation starts.\nFire orbs: Second phase only. Raime points his greatsword downward and slams it into the ground, emitting an area of effect fire attack. This attack also releases several fire orbs that expand outward from the knight, slowly spreading out as they go. As with the fire sword, this attack is highly damaging and difficult to avoid, especially if the player is close to Raime. The best way to avoid it is to roll back immediately when the player sees Raime turn his greatsword upside down, then wait for the fire orbs to spread out. If the player is far enough back, they can simply step through a gap between two orbs. Can also be rolled under, though one has to be very careful when doing so. Can also be &lt;a href=\"parried\"&gt;parried&lt;/a&gt; using a spell-parry shield.\nDefenses.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense.\nStrategy.\nOutside the arena where the Fume Knight waits, there are four &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Idol\"&gt;Ashen Idol&lt;/a&gt;s scattered around. It's highly advisable for the player to strive in keeping at least four &lt;a href=\"Smelter%20Wedge\"&gt;Smelter Wedge&lt;/a&gt;s at all times, even if it means leaving one (or maybe more) Ashen Idols intact while traversing &lt;a href=\"Brume%20Tower\"&gt;Brume Tower&lt;/a&gt;. These four Ashen Idols should be destroyed prior to the fight or they will prove to be a large problem by healing Raime throughout the fight.\nThe NPCs available for this fight will more likely than not give Raime a higher fighting advantage by providing him with a defense boost for each phantom summoned rather than helping in doing damage to him, so they probably will not be helpful for this encounter.\nIt is possible to buff once inside the arena, meaning the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Warrior\"&gt;Iron Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s will not be an issue while buffing.\nRaime takes low damage from &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; attacks, but lightning-imbued weapons will still do decent damage to him provided they can deal considerable base &lt;a href=\"Physical%20damage\"&gt;Physical damage&lt;/a&gt;.\nRaime is dangerous, even against a player wielding a shield. He will hit hard and fast, meaning &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; will be difficult to keep up, even with high &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt;. Since he mostly deals &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; and Physical damage, a &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%20Parma\"&gt;Phoenix Parma&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Gyrm%20Greatshield\"&gt;Gyrm Greatshield&lt;/a&gt; will work well, as they can block most of the damage he will output, though the stamina drain will remain an issue.\nHis most often used combo at the first phase of the fight is performing two quick slashes with his &lt;a href=\"Fume%20Sword\"&gt;straight sword&lt;/a&gt; followed by a wide slash from his &lt;a href=\"Fume%20Ultra%20Greatsword\"&gt;ultra greatsword&lt;/a&gt;, either left-to-right or right-to-left, depending on the player's position. However, he can often chain this combo with a fourth attack as well. The player must be prepared to either block or roll after striking a hit at Raime after he has finished a combo, and never get greedy in attacking him more than once (or twice, depending on the weapon used), as he's prone to unleash his 270\u00b0 evading attack at that moment.\nEvery now and then he'll perform a downward smash with his ultra greatsword and won't chain any more attacks, providing an excellent opportunity to attack him.\nThe fireballs from one of his special attacks at the second phase of the fight can be avoided by either blocking them with a shield, rolling through them, getting far away from Raime until they disappear, or, if the player is skilled enough, walk between them through their circling animation.\nAt this phase, the player would be wise in luring Raime into performing his slow Fire/Dark energy-projecting swipe constantly and roll through it, allowing them to score a free hit each time.\nThe player must be wary when Raime buffs his greatsword with both Fire and Dark. Dark damage will still inflict heavy damage and pass through shields even if the player is well equipped against fire. Having some sort of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29%23Dark%20Defense\"&gt;Dark Defense&lt;/a&gt;, like the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Quartz%20Ring\"&gt;Dark Quartz Ring&lt;/a&gt;, will help alleviate the extra dark damage Raime deals when he switches &lt;a href=\"moveset\"&gt;moveset&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Dispelling%20Ring\"&gt;Dispelling Ring+1&lt;/a&gt; (also found in &lt;a href=\"Brume%20Tower\"&gt;Brume Tower&lt;/a&gt;) works exceptionally well, as it provides defense against both Fire and Dark. Another option is to infuse a fully upgraded &lt;a href=\"Gyrm%20Greatshield\"&gt;Gyrm Greatshield&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Darknight%20Stone\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt;, even if it means sacrificing a bit of &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; defenses.\nDue to Raime's resistances to almost all forms of elemental attacks, infused weapons such as &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, etc. will deal less damage than a fully upgraded non-infused weapon, so the player may opt in removing their preferred weapons' infusions if the fight proves to be too difficult. A good alternative is to temporarily change the weapon's infusion to &lt;a href=\"Raw%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;Raw&lt;/a&gt;, which draws out a weapon's best possible Physical damage.\nOnce Raime has buffed his ultra greatsword (left hand), his right hand weapon disappears. For melee characters, it is highly-advisable to focus all attacks and evasive rolls on his unarmed hand. This spot is beyond the reach of most of his attacks. Likewise, the 270 degree swing can be reasonably avoided by rolling left, towards the unarmed hand then rolling back towards it once behind Raime.\nIf fighting Raime during the second phase, it is advisable to lure him onto the edges of the boss area. Rolling towards the unarmed hand will dodge most of his attacks. Likewise, Raime's Fire Orb attacks can be avoided altogether by running straight towards the other end of the boss area. It should be noted that this is only effective if the Fire Orb attacks are telegraphed immediately.\nSummoning.\n&lt;a href=\"Steelheart%20Ellie\"&gt;Steelheart Ellie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carhillion%20of%20the%20Fold\"&gt;Carhillion of the Fold&lt;/a&gt; can be summoned for this battle. Ellie's sign is right next to the nearby bonfire, while Carhillion's sign is in front of the fog gate.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 Fume Knight by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuLOSDIOaxQ&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

Because it deals primarily &lt;a href=\"Strike%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Strike&lt;/a&gt; damage, it is very powerful against foes wearing plate metal armor, in particular other players who wear heavy armor to increase their &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;. Because of its monstrous size and &lt;a href=\"weight\"&gt;weight&lt;/a&gt;, it is also one of only two ultra greatswords that possesses the Poise health of a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Hammers%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;great hammer&lt;/a&gt;, the other being the &lt;a href=\"Ringed%20Knight%20Paired%20Greatswords\"&gt;Ringed Knight Paired Greatswords&lt;/a&gt;; this means that it is extremely strong when used to trade against opponents who are also wielding ultra weapons.\nHowever, it is the heaviest ultra greatsword in the game, and it also requires the greatest amount of Strength to wield of any ultra greatsword. As well, swinging the weapon consumes copious amounts of &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;, more than other ultra greatswords, and none of its thrusting attacks actually deal &lt;a href=\"Thrust%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Thrust&lt;/a&gt; damage, preventing it from benefiting from &lt;a href=\"counter-attack\"&gt;counter-attack&lt;/a&gt;s. Due to its immense weight, it is crucial that the player invest not only in Strength, but also invest heavily into &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vitality%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite requiring &lt;a href=\"Twinkling%20Titanite%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Twinkling Titanite&lt;/a&gt; to upgrade, the Fume Ultra Greatsword can still be buffed. This means that its monstrous damage output can be further augmented with the use of buffs and resins, giving it the ability to add elemental damage that a foe is weak to, or to chip through enemies who are relying heavily on shields.\nMuch like in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\", the Fume Ultra Greatsword has the highest total damage absorption of all the ultra greatswords, and other weapons, present in the game. It also boasts an impressive amount of &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt; for its class, and coupled with its high absorption values, allows it to be used as not only a sword, but also as a strong makeshift &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Fume Ultra Greatsword's &lt;a href=\"Stomp\"&gt;Stomp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; has unique properties, even when compared to that of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight%20Greatsword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Black Knight Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike other Stomp skills in the game, using it with the Fume Ultra Greatsword will grant the player block frames during the first phase, greatly reducing any damage taken before crushing any foes foolish enough to engage with the second phase. However, the trade-off is that blocking the attacks will drain tremendous amounts of stamina, and should the wielder exhaust their stamina in this way they will be unable to perform the crushing attack.\nUpgrades.\nReinforced with &lt;a href=\"Twinkling%20Titanite%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Twinkling Titanite&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nCannot be &lt;a href=\"Infusion%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;infused&lt;/a&gt;."}

This task is then passed on by Kaathe to the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt;, a distant descendant of the Pygmy. If complied with, Kaathe and several other Primordial Serpents\u2014including &lt;a href=\"Frampt\"&gt;Frampt&lt;/a&gt;\u2014will bow in respect to the new Dark Lord.\nLore.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Furtive Pygmy is one of the primordial humanoid creatures that appeared underground after the advent of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, which brought life, death and \"disparity\". He was the one who found the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Soul\"&gt;Dark Soul&lt;/a&gt;, one of the four &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Soul\"&gt;Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt;s of immense power, but he did so only after the other Lord Souls were discovered by &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Nito\"&gt;Gravelord Nito&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Witch of Izalith&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Gwyn had already developed his civilization and army of &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Knights\"&gt;Silver Knights&lt;/a&gt; and the Witch of Izalith her civilization based on fire sorcery, the Pygmy fragmented his &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Soul\"&gt;Dark Soul&lt;/a&gt; among his descendants, creating the first &lt;a href=\"Humans\"&gt;Humans&lt;/a&gt; in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Cleric\"&gt;Pygmies&lt;/a&gt;. Even though they were late compared to the other gods, the pygmies began to harness their peculiar Lord Soul, opening an &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt; capable of generating life and even forged &lt;a href=\"Ringed%20Knight%20Paired%20Greatswords\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ringed%20Knight%20Set\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; with the darkness and its properties.\nAs Gwyn's war against the &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;s turned out to be very bloody for his forces at one point the Lord of Sunlight was even forced to integrate into his ranks the &lt;a href=\"Ringed%20Knight\"&gt;Ringed Knight&lt;/a&gt;s, descendants of the Furtive Pygmy and who had developed their own &lt;a href=\"Ringed%20Knight%20Paired%20Greatswords\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ringed%20Knight%20Set\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; infused with the life-giving power of the &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt; and so the pygmies took part in the battles against the dragons together with the other Lords.\nDespite having won the war against the dragons, Gwyn would turn against the Pygmy and his descedants, as he feared the power of their Dark Soul that could have potentially undermined his future dominion over the world. The Lord of Sunlight, however, resolved the issue very skillfully without having to clash with the primordial humans: despite their contribution in the war Gwyn managed to make them perceive themselves as inferior to his clan and make them agree to submit and be made vassals.\nGwyn \"gave\" them a &lt;a href=\"The%20Ringed%20City%20%28Location%29\"&gt;magnificent ringed city&lt;/a&gt; at the edge of the world, the title of \"rulers\" and even his youngest daughter &lt;a href=\"Filianore\"&gt;Filianore&lt;/a&gt;, although he promised her that he would have come back for her.\nWith this clever move Gwyn ensured that the &lt;a href=\"Pygmy%20King\"&gt;Pygmies Lords&lt;/a&gt; and their Dark Soul would remain trapped inside of the Ringed City and out of history, keeping a role of subjection to his dominion, eliminating from history even the contributions of the Ringed Knights during the war against the dragons and the very existence of the Pygmy. Despite this, Gwyn continued to fear humans and the potential of their soul, going so far as to make an even more extreme move towards them: using the Flame to \"mark\" their Dark Soul and bodies with a &lt;a href=\"Darksign\"&gt;Darksign&lt;/a&gt;, a violation of their bodies and identities that they apparently accepted. The fire would thus have castrated the powers of humans, making them mortal and incapable of making use of their natural abilities thus assuming a \"fleeting form\". Despite this the pygmies continued to make use of the Abyss in subtle defiance of the gods' wishes, using it to taint &lt;a href=\"Ringed%20Knight%20Hood\"&gt;multiple layers of cloth&lt;/a&gt; to cover their eyes, thus revealing visions of the future that the seal of fire had occluded.\nAfter several centuries of the Age of Fire and the rule of the gods over men the history of the Pygmy has been almost completely lost and apparently only the &lt;a href=\"Primordial%20Serpent\"&gt;Primordial Serpent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kaathe\"&gt;Kaathe&lt;/a&gt; has knowledge about it. According to him, the progenitor of humans had found a unique Lord Soul compared to the other three the \"Dark Soul\" and had waited for the Age of Fire to subside and the Flame to fade so that only Dark would remain. However Gwyn trembled at the Dark and feared the humans and the Dark Lord that would one day be born among them. And so the Lord of Sunlight resisted the course of nature and linked the First Flame for the first time, sacrificing his power to artificially prolong its life. Furthermore he commanded his children and the gods to shepherd the humans so that they could maintain the history of men blurred and prevent the rise of the Dark Lord, creating a system that would lead the Undead to sacrifice themselves to the Flame and repeat Gwyn's sacrifice to maintain his order of the world.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral centuries after Lord Gwyn linked the First Flame for the first time, the Furtive Pygmy is all but forgotten even in &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt;, even outside of the direct influence of the gods. In fact, only the group known as the &lt;a href=\"Pilgrims%20of%20Dark\"&gt;Pilgrims of Dark&lt;/a&gt; is still aware of the origins of the humans and appear to worship a Dark Lord of some sort, though they never directly refer to the Pygmy. &lt;a href=\"Darkdiver%20Grandahl\"&gt;Grandhal&lt;/a&gt; would encourage the undead who come to Drangleic to dive into the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Chasm%20of%20Old\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt; that has opened up in the region and to challenge the depths deeper and deeper to understand their own darkness and reward them with his hexes and dark sorceries.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, the primordial Pygmy died and his Dark Soul was inherited by his descendants, the royal family that ruled the Ringed City. Throughout the millennia that followed in the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Age of Fire&lt;/a&gt;, the Pygmies continued to worship the gods and follow their rules and even the &lt;a href=\"Pygmy%20King\"&gt;Pygmy Lords&lt;/a&gt; who possessed the Dark Soul and ruled the city relied on &lt;a href=\"Filianore\"&gt;Filianore&lt;/a&gt; for salvation.\nHowever, one day a &lt;a href=\"Crucifix%20of%20the%20Mad%20King\"&gt;\"mad\" king&lt;/a&gt; was born among them and his actions led &lt;a href=\"Shira%2C%20Knight%20of%20Filianore\"&gt;Shira, Knight of Filianore&lt;/a&gt; to put him to rest. As the power of the Dark Soul made him undying she was only able to pin her cross spear to his body, leading her to imprison him and stay close to watch over his remains forever. Following this event the Dark Soul was apparently divided among multiple members of the pygmy nobility as their government became led by several &lt;a href=\"Pygmy%20King\"&gt;Pygmy Lords&lt;/a&gt; and not a single king. \nThe new kings thus continued to obey the gods and rely on them despite the potential of their souls, remaining passive until the end of time to the point that their own &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20the%20Dark%20Soul\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; dried up. At a certain point one of the &lt;a href=\"Ringed%20City%20Pygmy\"&gt;Pygmy Lords&lt;/a&gt; came to hate the gods for the condition in which they had imprisoned them and consider the Ringed City as a dung heap and an overgrown privy, leading him to throw away his crown and position himself at the entrance of the city to welcome the new arrivals, directing them to the Dark Soul they would surely seek.\nKnowledge of the situation of the Ringed City and the Dark Soul also appears to be in possession of the pilgrims of &lt;a href=\"Londor\"&gt;Londor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Avowal\"&gt;Sword of Avowal&lt;/a&gt; design seems inspired by the architecture of the Ringed City."}

Not only does it deal strictly &lt;a href=\"Strike%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Strike&lt;/a&gt; damage, much like its &lt;a href=\"Executioner%27s%20Greatsword\"&gt;unbroken version&lt;/a&gt;, it also deals &lt;a href=\"Thrust%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Thrust&lt;/a&gt; on its first strong attacks. In essence, it has the exact moveset of the &lt;a href=\"Onyx%20Blade\"&gt;Onyx Blade&lt;/a&gt;, with only one difference, which is in fact unique to its class. When two-handing it, after a strong attack (which is a thrust), if used a follow-up strong attack, it will use the regular horizontal slash attack that the &lt;a href=\"Bastard%20Sword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bastard Sword&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Flamberge%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Flamberge&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Greatsword%20of%20Judgment\"&gt;Greatsword of Judgment&lt;/a&gt; all have, instead of the regular vertical upward slash that all other greatswords with thrust attacks have when two-handed (Onyx Blade/&lt;a href=\"Hollowslayer%20Greatsword\"&gt;Hollowslayer Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Claymore%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Claymore&lt;/a&gt;).\nIts &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; is unique and mimics the movement of &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Knight%20Gael\"&gt;Gael&lt;/a&gt; himself, with fluid and bestial motions.\nUpon activating &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20Peril\"&gt;Blade of Peril&lt;/a&gt;, the player can select a direction and flip horizontally into a ground smash, this can be used to dodge and attack at the same time. Afterward, players can either use a weak attack or strong attack to complete the combo of the skill.\nThe weak attack will make players perform a sweeping spin attack (reminiscent of the special attack of the &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Greatsword\"&gt;Farron Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; when two-handed). Well suited against multiple opponents.\nThe strong attack attack results in a quick dodge backwards, and then with an overhead lunging thrust into the ground (similar to &lt;a href=\"Crow%20Quills\"&gt;Crow Quills&lt;/a&gt;' jumping attack, albeit extremely fast and with large hitbox). Better suited to avoid &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;hyper armor&lt;/a&gt; attacks against single opponents.\nAn interesting thing is that using just the first attack of the Skill wastes very little FP, this means it can be spammed to throw off opponents.\nIt &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;scales&lt;/a&gt; moderately with &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and poorly with &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;. Thus it benefits better from Strength builds."}

Its ravenous gluttony has transformed its rib cage into a gigantic vertical maw that can inflict crushing bites and oozes acid, while its head regressed to a stubby proboscis to detect potential prey.\u00a0\nLore.\nThe Gaping Dragon is a distant descendant of the primordial &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;archdragons&lt;/a&gt;. It existed long before the emergence of mankind, and is the last of its breed, which was partly mineral.\nAs one of the few dragons to survive the war against the bearers of the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Soul\"&gt;Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt;s it found itself alone and was forced to survive in any way it could\n. It eventually found itself in the furthest depths of the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Burg\"&gt;Undead Burg&lt;/a&gt;, a place called &lt;a href=\"Blighttown\"&gt;Blighttown&lt;/a&gt;, feared even by the outcasts of the &lt;a href=\"Depths\"&gt;Depths&lt;/a&gt; for its great pestilence. The dragon over time was corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Humanity%20%28item%29\"&gt;darkness&lt;/a&gt; and transformed into a deformed abomination, its rib cage turned into a gigantic maw oozing with acid. The dragon devoured the key to the mighty door that the inhabitants of the Depths had built to remain safely separated from the plague of Blighttown and which it tried to break down to reemerge.\nSummoning.\nIt is possible to &lt;a href=\"summon\"&gt;summon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Solaire%20of%20Astora\"&gt;Solaire of Astora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Lautrec%20of%20Carim\"&gt;Knight Lautrec of Carim&lt;/a&gt; (if the player had previously freed him and talked to him at Firelink Shrine). Solaire's summon sign can be found next to the stairs leading to the &lt;a href=\"Fog%20Door\"&gt;Fog Door&lt;/a&gt;, while Lautrec's can be found just behind\u00a0the pillar, opposite to Solaire's.\u00a0\nDragon King Greataxe.\nTo cut off the dragon's tail, a certain amount of damage must be dealt to it (by striking the tail directly). The HP of the tail increases with higher NG cycles and is based on the HP of the dragon itself. The Gaping Dragon's tail has 539 health on NG and 1,036 on NG+.\nBoss information.\nAttacks.\nRight Punch.\nThe Gaping Dragon performs a punch with its right arm. The attack has a short range and can be dodged by running to the left side of it.\nTriple Stomp.\nThe Gaping Dragon brings its leg up and quickly stomps three times in succession. The Gaping Dragon focuses this attack on the area in front of it.\nLeft Leg Swipe.\nThe Gaping Dragon slowly brings its left leg up and then swing across its front. This attack covers a great range so it's best to run away or stick close the Dragon's right hand side.\nStomach Slam.\nThe Gaping Dragon points its stomach in the air and then slams it into the ground with great force. The best option to avoid this attack is running directly away. The Gaping Dragon's teeth get stuck in the ground briefly after this attack, making it vulnerable to counter-attack.\nCharge.\nThe Gaping Dragon begins to charge in a straight line. Running to the side is the best way to avoid this attack. This attack is always executed after a Stomach Slam.\nTail Whip.\nThe Gaping Dragon swings its tail to one side of its body. This attack can be difficult to avoid but is best evaded by running to the enemy's front. Cutting off the tail will cause the reach of the attack to lower significantly, but\u00a0it can still hit.\nJump.\nThe Gaping Dragon will fly upwards for a brief moment and attempt to land on the player. When it is stuck or is being flanked it will trigger this move, which will result in the dragon turning itself around. Another form of this attack triggers when the player attacks from afar, after which the monster will try to land onto the player in a single bound. Both can be avoided by running away, however, the latter requires the player to focus more on timing.\nCorroding Acid.\nThe Gaping Dragon points its stomach to the ground and after a brief delay, expels acid that covers a big portion of the area. This will degrade equipment. Staying in it too long may cause all of the player's equipment to break.\nGorge.\nThe Gaping Dragon grabs the player when close and then crunch with its vertical maw, inflicting tremendous physical damage.\u00a0\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls \u2014 Gaping Dragon by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWveo0m_Or0&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

There are two variants: one with a spear resembling a lantern and another with a spear resembling a torch, both of which are able to deal &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage.\nA stronger variant with a skull-like head appears later on the rooftops of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt;. These come armed either with a &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20Flame%20Hammer\"&gt;great hammer&lt;/a&gt; or with a &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20Flame%20Spear\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt;. Some of their attacks are accompanied by explosions and lava splatter, dealing additional &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage.\nLocations.\n&lt;a href=\"Profaned%20Capital\"&gt;Profaned Capital&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt;\nStrategy.\nProfaned Capital.\nGargoyles encountered in the &lt;a href=\"Profaned%20Capital\"&gt;Profaned Capital&lt;/a&gt; are often positioned on bridges or rooftops, so the player should be mindful of their surroundings when engaging them in combat. They will disguise themselves as regular statues and will spring to life when in close proximity, although striking them with a ranged weapon will trigger them early. Their attacks inflict &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage and they can block attacks with their wings. If struck during this, they will retaliate with a shunt that can send the player flying.\nGargoyles will often take flight and attempt to strike the player from above before crashing down on top of them. By running underneath when they jump, it is possible to sprint past them.\nGrand Archives.\nGargoyles encountered in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt; use basically the same techniques as their &lt;a href=\"Profaned%20Capital\"&gt;Profaned Capital&lt;/a&gt; counterparts, albeit being more aggressive and counting with slightly enhanced attacks. They also seem to have a more extensive aggro range and will charge into battle from farther distances.\nThey are encountered along the rooftops section of the level, which can make fighting them more difficult as a single misstep could mean an instant death. Likewise, they may die in the same manner, and since they jump and fly all around the battlefield, they have a bigger chance of falling off. On certain occasions, they may land on a floor below or get stuck in the scenery and not be able to return unless the area is reloaded.\nMany of their attacks create explosions which splatter blobs of lava, dealing additional &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage to their already powerful blows; evading is advised, although bringing a &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; that provides good &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; absorption and &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt; is recommended when blocking is inevitable.\nSame as with the headless version, they can use their wings as a manner of shield to cover themselves, albeit they do this more frequently and may even do it while exchanging hits with the player. If hit while in this state, they will instantly retaliate by opening the wing with great force, hitting the player and following with a powerful attack. They are vulnerable from behind at all times, however.\nDrops.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The final gargoyle in Anor Londo always drops its halberd as a fail-safe if the player wasn\u2019t lucky enough to have a previous gargoyle drop it, since none of the gargoyles respawn.\nThis weapon can be farmed by killing one of the Gargoyle bosses at the Undead Parish. If it doesn't drop it, quit and reload to reset the boss fight; repeat until you have obtained the number of halberds desired.\nCharacteristics.\nThe Gargoyle's Halberd has slightly higher base damage than a regular &lt;a href=\"Halberd\"&gt;Halberd&lt;/a&gt; but slightly lower \"Quality\" &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt;, making both weapons about equally damaging. Picking between these two weapons should be up to the user's moveset preference as Gargoyle's Halberd has a different &lt;a href=\"moveset\"&gt;moveset&lt;/a&gt; than the regular Halberd: the\u00a0weak attack is a vertical chop followed by a swing. This can make certain foes easier to hit, but is harder to use in confined spaces. Gargoyle's Halberd is a good replacement for &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight%20Halberd\"&gt;Black Knight Halberd&lt;/a&gt; as it is nearly identical except the fact that Garg Hally has decent Physical Damage scaling and can be buffed.\nThis Halberd's attack type is listed as Regular in the menu but it actually deals &lt;a href=\"Thrust%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Thrust&lt;/a&gt; damage for a majority of its attacks making it deal &lt;a href=\"https%3A//darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_%28Dark_Souls%29%23Counter_Damage\"&gt;counter damage&lt;/a&gt; that can be further boosted by &lt;a href=\"Leo%20Ring\"&gt;Leo Ring&lt;/a&gt;. Similar to most Halberds, this weapon has a stagger on whiff animation making it capable of receiving a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_%28Dark_Souls%29%23Sweet_Spot_Damage_Bonus\"&gt;Sweet Spot&lt;/a&gt; damage bonus.\nDespite its claim to be perfectly standard with no special power, the Gargoyle\u2019s Halberd increases base resistance to &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Toxic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt; by 25%.

Under the orders of Gwyn, Arkon leads a battalion of Silver Knights into the city of &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Izalith\"&gt;Lost Izalith&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the God's suspicion of &lt;a href=\"dark\"&gt;dark&lt;/a&gt; magic and &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt;s. Knight Garl is amongst Arkon and is seen alongside the knights fighting a group of &lt;a href=\"Taurus%20Demon\"&gt;Taurus Demon&lt;/a&gt;.

However, this requires the player to keep the chime out to keep the heal going, meaning that only one hand will be free.\nOnline gameplay.\nThis skill finds use as a summoned phantom, as non-host entities have halved Estus while in a &lt;a href=\"Host%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Host of Embers&lt;/a&gt;' world. It can be handy for keeping health topped up without having to expend a precious Estus Flask. It can be similarly helpful for invaders, as they can choose to hide away in the world and gradually replenish health while biding their time and looking for a moment to strike."}

She taught her &lt;a href=\"Bountiful%20Light\"&gt;healing miracle&lt;/a&gt; to the knights of the kingdom and they became part of the &lt;a href=\"Braille%20Divine%20Tome%20of%20Lothric\"&gt;miracles in use in Lothric&lt;/a&gt;, implying that she had a great influence on both the army and clergy of the realm.\nOne day Gertrude saw an &lt;a href=\"Angel\"&gt;Angel&lt;/a&gt;, a lucent humanoid creature created by the evolution of the fermented humanity of the pilgrims of &lt;a href=\"Londor\"&gt;Londor&lt;/a&gt; that were arriving to the kingdom of Lothric. Gertrude learned the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Pillars%20of%20Light\"&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; of this creature, capable of manifesting pillars of light together with a belief completely opposed to those of the culture of Lothric. The holy maiden was convinced by this enlightenment and began to spread the worship of the angels, earning herself the title of \"Angel's Daughter\". However this faith was viewed as heresy in Lothric, as it opposed the worship of the ancient gods and the duty to continue linking the First Flame and was consequently unrecognized by any of the Three Pillars that govern the realm.\nDue to the danger that her new faith posed to the kingdom, despite her position of closeness to the Queen, Gertrude was imprisoned in the ceiling cell inside the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt;. Here she was subjected to the experiments of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives%20Scholar\"&gt;scholars&lt;/a&gt;, that even toyed with her &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Chime\"&gt;sacred chime&lt;/a&gt;, using the power of crystals to make a catalyst that was suitable for casting both miracles and sorceries. Eventually the abuses of the scholars led the woman to lose both her voice and her sight but she remained determined to write down the story of the Angel, even if in the form of incoherent scrawls.\nEven though Gertrude was still in captivity her confused writings somehow reached the rest of Lothric and became the foundation of the \"Angelic Faith\" that venerated angels despite the Three Pillars' condemnation of heresy. Over time, this heretical faith also spread among the knights of Lothric who, despite maintaining the symbols and armor of the kingdom, swore themselves to the Angels. These soldiers even went so far as to create iconography and art of their new faith, depticting themselves as angelic executioners under a solar eclipse\nand their strong faith led them to develop angelic wings similar to those of the objects of their worship.\nSeen as heretics despite the fact that they still wore the insignia of Lothric, these knights, now called &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Knight\"&gt;Winged Knight&lt;/a&gt;s, armed themselves with weapons more befitting of executioners and came into conflict with the Three Pillars and Lothric's loyalist army.\nIn the final days of the reign of Lothric and the First Flame, Gertrude died, still in her cage, surrounded by feathers and clutching onto her writings. However the Winged Knights continue to patrol various locations within Lothric and even the Castle, and &lt;a href=\"Gertrude%27s%20Knight\"&gt;Gertrude's most loyal Knights&lt;/a&gt;, that managed to develop large feathered wings, remained positioned to defend their saint's resting place."}

Despite their massive size, these knights are very quick and agile, and have incredible attack range.\nOnly three are encountered in the game, all of them awaiting at their lookout post on the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt;' highest tower, atop the main dome. As the player approaches, all three will jump down at the same time for an ambush, one wielding &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Knight%20Twinaxes\"&gt;twinaxes&lt;/a&gt; and the other two wielding &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Knight%20Halberd\"&gt;halberds&lt;/a&gt;. They have advanced attack versions from their &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Knight\"&gt;Winged Knight&lt;/a&gt;s counterparts and also feature some devastating new moves and &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce they land, the two halberd-wielding knights will stay on post, while the one twinaxes-wielding knight will start patrolling around the dome.\nLocation.\nOnly three appear in the game and they are all found at the top of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt;' highest tower, located at the center of the main dome and opposite to &lt;a href=\"Lorian%2C%20Elder%20Prince%20and%20Lothric%2C%20Younger%20Prince\"&gt;Lothric's and Lorian&lt;/a&gt;'s boss arena. As the player approaches the tower, all three will jump down at the same time from their lookout post for an ambush.\nLore.\nBeneath the rooftops where Gertrude's Knights are fought, a drop into the upper rafters of the Grand Archives reveals a large bird cage, messy with white feathers and containing the corpse of Gertrude, the Heavenly Daughter, holding the spell scroll for &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Pillars%20of%20Light\"&gt;Divine Pillars of Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile Gertrude has already perished in captivity, her knights still stand guard above, ever watchful and waiting for the enemy.\nStrategy.\nThe three Gertrude's Knights can be seen from a distance, holding position at the top of a tower located at the center of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;archives&lt;/a&gt;' main dome. As the player approaches the tower, all three will fly down to the player using their wings. The knights have a very powerful set of attacks compared to the regular Winged Knights. Upon first detecting the player, they will likely fly into the air and perform a overhead slam, or a spin attack.\nThe player is advised to approach the tower by their blind side in order to stay out of sight when they land, and hide as soon as they jump down. It is advised to take on the &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Knight%20Twinaxes\"&gt;Twinaxes&lt;/a&gt;-wielding Knight first, as he will fly down and begin patrolling the dome. The overall general tactics used for dealing with the &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Knight\"&gt;Winged Knight&lt;/a&gt;s should be followed. All Winged Knights are very tough to &lt;a href=\"stagger\"&gt;stagger&lt;/a&gt;, so the player should take caution when attempting long combos against them, as they will often interrupt with a shunt.\nTrying to take on more than one knight at a time can overwhelm the player, and lead to death. So it is advised to lead them away from each other before engaging.\nBoth variants of knights can perform a spin attack lasting several seconds that will completely drain the player's &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; if blocked, and inflict heavy damage. Evading through the spin is the best way to avoid it, as it can clip the player if they try &lt;a href=\"rolling\"&gt;rolling&lt;/a&gt; to the side.\nAfter the first one falls, the player can then cautiously approach another from behind, trying to score a &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt; before he reacts, or at least driving him away from his companion.\nThe fight can be greatly trivialized with the use of &lt;a href=\"Rapport\"&gt;Rapport&lt;/a&gt;. This can either be used to make them fight each other, or for attacking them without fear of retaliation.\nBoth variants are able to cast &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Pillars%20of%20Light\"&gt;Divine Pillars of Light&lt;/a&gt; which track the player almost indefinitely and inflict heavy damage."}

In particular, they may stretch their arms out and attack from behind. The player must stay alert as they explore the ruins, as ghosts can pass through any solid object, enabling them to attack through the floors, walls and even the ceilings. It is even possible for them to go through the fogwall leading to the boss in the area, so it is advised to either deal with them or dropping into the Abyss as quickly as possible as they will not follow the player there.\nGhosts stagger easily. Using a high-powered weapon can prove effective.\nCurse.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Banshee\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;, Ghosts can only be killed if the player is &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Cursed&lt;/a&gt; or if they're carrying a cursed weapon. &lt;a href=\"Transient%20Curse\"&gt;Transient Curse&lt;/a&gt; allows temporary contact with Ghosts and Banshees without actually being cursed. It acts as a &lt;a href=\"Self%20Augmentation\"&gt;self augmentation&lt;/a&gt; effect and will prevent the use of other self augmentations, such as regeneration effects for health and stamina.\nIf the player is not cursed, they will not be able to interact with the Ghost in any way. This includes damaging it, of course, but also blocking it or just reducing the damage taken with armor. Furthermore, the Ghost's attacks will always stagger the player when not cursed, as they'll bypass armor, leaving the player &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;poiseless&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers can also use cursed weapons (such as the &lt;a href=\"Jagged%20Ghost%20Blade\"&gt;Jagged Ghost Blade&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Greatsword%20of%20Artorias%20%28Cursed%29\"&gt;Cursed Greatsword of Artorias&lt;/a&gt;). While this allows contact with the Ghost, it will still leave the player unable to block with a shield or reduce damage taken with armor. Cursed weapons can also be used to block.\nIf possible, the most complete strategy is to use a Transient Curse but still use a cursed weapon. This makes it so that the player is not left completely defenseless, should the Transient Curse lose its effect at a bad time, or without the player noticing.\nLore.\nThey are the ghosts of the people who once inhabited New Londo, but were sacrificed when New Londo was flooded to contain the &lt;a href=\"Darkwraith%20%28enemy%29\"&gt;Darkwraiths&lt;/a&gt;. Their physical remains can be found at the big gate entrance leading to the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Drakes\"&gt;Valley of Drakes&lt;/a&gt;."}

Despite their bestial appearance, they possess limited intelligence, utilizing weapons and &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;poisons&lt;/a&gt; in combat.\nThe Ghru are one of the most varied enemy types in the game with five different variations encountered. Stronger versions, known as &lt;a href=\"Smouldering%20Ghru\"&gt;Smouldering Ghru&lt;/a&gt;, are found in the &lt;a href=\"Smouldering%20Lake\"&gt;Smouldering Lake&lt;/a&gt;. They fight in the same way as their regular variants, although they can also inflict &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Toxic&lt;/a&gt; on the player.\nStrategy.\nStandard Ghru and their variants are some of the most difficult non-&lt;a href=\"Boss%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; enemies in the game. They have a decent range of aggro and can close on a player quickly, with several different attacks. Those that are armed can do so with a larger reach, save for the variants wielding a spear and shield, which possess the standard thrust and swipe attack.\nUnarmed Ghru are to be considered the most dangerous as they have a very well telegraphed, yet highly tracking grab attack. That can nearly kill most players, especially on their first play though and will most likely kill them on &lt;a href=\"NG%2B%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;NG+&lt;/a&gt;. The grab attack will also buff the Ghru in return and empower their attacks and even apply a slight attack speed increase as well. Though &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt; remains unaffected in the exchange. &lt;a href=\"Stun-lock\"&gt;Stun-lock&lt;/a&gt;ing the Ghru is preferable to a straight up melee fight. As they can easily do the same with either one of their combos. This is doubly so for the unarmed variants, as the attacks track at a moderate pace and the Ghru travels forward with each attack. Allowing it to pursue the player as they are knocked backwards from each strike."}

Their bodies are covered in a rough, rock-like skin. The upper half of their bodies is generally bulky, with huge protruding shoulders and massive arms, however some are more slender in appearance. They largely wear rudimentary clothing, such as loincloths and ragged robes.\nTheir brutish appearance and primitive weaponry has led some citizens of Drangleic to view them as being no more than uncivilized barbarians, but contrary evidence shows that they utilize magic and employ concepts such as monarchy and military hierarchy.\nWar with Drangleic.\nGiants are primarily known through their conflict with &lt;a href=\"Vendrick\"&gt;King Vendrick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;his kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. According to legend, a mysterious woman named &lt;a href=\"Nashandra\"&gt;Nashandra&lt;/a&gt;, said to be of unparalleled beauty, came to Vendrick long ago and warned him of a looming threat across the seas, in the land of the Giants. King Vendrick named Nashandra his queen and crossed the ocean with her to combat the Giants. During this conflict, he pillaged the Giant's lands, and stole an unspecified \"prize\", which he brought back to Drangleic. Using this acquired power, Vendrick created various types of &lt;a href=\"Golem\"&gt;Golem&lt;/a&gt;s, who in turn built &lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Castle\"&gt;Drangleic Castle&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeeking vengeance for the subjugation of his kingdom, the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Lord\"&gt;king of the Giants&lt;/a&gt; amassed an army in a vengeful counter-invasion of Drangleic. He also sought to reclaim the invaluable \"prize\" stolen from him. Unwilling to forgive the actions of Vendrick, the Giants crossed the sea and landed on the northern shores of Drangleic. They set siege to Drangleic Castle and relentlessly attacked various settlements, forts and keeps across the land for several generations.\nBattles waged endlessly between Vendrick's forces and the Giants, and much of Drangleic's citizens fled the kingdom to escape the conflict. Ultimately, the Giants were defeated by an unnamed hero. In the aftermath, much of Drangleic had been reduced to rubble, and visitors to the kingdom were rare. Many Giants were killed in the conflict, and their corpses eventually grew into large trees that sprawled across the once prosperous kingdom. The &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Giant\"&gt;last known Giant&lt;/a&gt; to have survived the conflict was terribly wounded and kept prisoner in a cavern beneath the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20of%20Fallen%20Giants\"&gt;Forest of Fallen Giants&lt;/a&gt;. It was later discovered &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Giant\"&gt;another two Giants&lt;/a&gt; survived the war, but remained hidden in a cavern in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Gulch\"&gt;Black Gulch&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the Giants invasion was largely stopped, their souls remained powerful. King Vendrick's elder brother, &lt;a href=\"Aldia%2C%20Scholar%20of%20the%20First%20Sin\"&gt;Lord Aldia&lt;/a&gt;, kept Giants in &lt;a href=\"Aldia%27s%20Keep\"&gt;his manor&lt;/a&gt; and performed experiments on them in an attempt to recreate a &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;. The outcome of Lord Aldia's experiments is unknown, but oddly when the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Dragon\"&gt;Ancient Dragon&lt;/a&gt; roosting at &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shrine\"&gt;the summit&lt;/a&gt; of Aldia's realm was slain, the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20a%20Giant\"&gt;soul of a Giant&lt;/a&gt; was found in its remains. Legend holds that the Giants' resentment of King Vendrick was possibly emboldened in death. This was proven true when the &lt;a href=\"Bearer%20of%20the%20Curse\"&gt;Bearer of the Curse&lt;/a&gt; fought the hollowed remains of Vendrick. With the souls of several Giants in the Bearer's possession, Vendrick was significantly weakened and subsequently defeated.\nGiant Memories.\nOnce the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Mist%20Heart\"&gt;Ashen Mist Heart&lt;/a&gt; has been obtained, it can be used to interact with the corpses of three fallen Giants who fought in the war against Vendrick. The heart grants access to the memories of &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Jeigh\"&gt;Jeigh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Orro\"&gt;Orro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Vammar\"&gt;Vammar&lt;/a&gt;. In these memories, the player can witness various battles that took place between the Giants and Vendrick's army. According to &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Shalquoir\"&gt;Sweet Shalquoir&lt;/a&gt;, the Giants savour their memories of glory on the battlefield.\nVariants.\nGiants specialize in several different types of combat and can be differentiated by their appearance.\u00a0Giants use their brute strength to great effect. Many of the soldiers who invaded Drangleic used &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Warrior%20Club\"&gt;large clubs&lt;/a&gt;, or even just their fists in battle. Some giants utilized a form of &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;pyromancy&lt;/a&gt;, while others were known to have the ability to produce toxic projectiles from their bodies.\n&lt;a href=\"Giant%20Lord\"&gt;Giant Lord&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe king of the Giants who invaded Drangleic. This towering leader fought wearing his crown and wielding an enormous greatsword. He is encountered during the &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Jeigh\"&gt;Memory of Jeigh&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Elite%20Giant\"&gt;Elite Giant&lt;/a&gt;.\nSenior soldiers of the army of Giants. They're typically brown in color and wear a loincloth. They often wield two enormous, obelisk sized stone clubs in combat. Far larger and more formidable than their subordinates, the only Elite Giants to have survived the war reside in a hidden cavern in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Gulch\"&gt;Black Gulch&lt;/a&gt;. They can also be encountered in the &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Vammar\"&gt;Memory of Vammar&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Orro\"&gt;Memory of Orro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Jeigh\"&gt;Memory of Jeigh&lt;/a&gt;.\nMelee Giant.\nA more common, gray, shorter type of Giant that fights mainly with a &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Warrior%20Club\"&gt;large club&lt;/a&gt; or fists in battle. They can be encountered in the Memory of Vammar and Orro.\nPoison Giant.\nRelatively rare, this type of Giant looks similar to the Melee Giant, but can also throws balls of poison in combat. They wear a hooded robe and their left arm is coated in a green substance, which can poison anything it hits. This type of Giant can be encountered in the Memory of Vammar.\nPyromancer Giant.\nA Giant who exclusively throws balls of fire produced from the hole in their face. They wear a hooded robe and large engraved bracelets. Several can be encountered in the Memory of Vammar and Orro."}

He is similar to those other &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Slave\"&gt;Giant Slave&lt;/a&gt;s found within the &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20Dungeon\"&gt;Irithyll Dungeon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Cathedral of the Deep&lt;/a&gt;. The shackles he bears and grinds piercing through various parts of his body are evidence of an untold but surely sorrowful past.\nA skillful warrior who took refuge on the highest tower of the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;settlement&lt;/a&gt;, now uses his mighty greatbow to defend the land from the monstrosities brought by the &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;curse&lt;/a&gt; and which now lurk in this ruined and desolated realm. With astounding accuracy and arrows that &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;explode&lt;/a&gt; upon contact, the road leading to meet him will not be an easy one, should one dare to cross his line of fire.\nWhile his monstrous appearance may make one to think it twice before approaching him, once spoken to will reveal he is actually friendly and resolved to provide a helping hand to those who ask for it.\nHis presence is usually associated with places where young white birches grow. The &lt;a href=\"Young%20White%20Branch\"&gt;branches&lt;/a&gt; of these trees are thought to be a \"token of friendship\", which the giant usually presents to those who have gained his trust. Once befriended, he will lend his extraordinary archery skills in some of the\u00a0most dangerous areas found in &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nUpon meeting and possibly befriending the giant, the player will have two choices: either let their new friend live to aid them while traversing a few dangerous areas in the game, or kill him to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Hawk%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Hawk Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the latter option has been chosen, then he may be challenged at the top of his tower in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Undead Settlement&lt;/a&gt;; an easy task due to the small space where he is encountered at and which will severely compromise his mobility. In addition, the nearby staircase will provide complete cover from all of his attacks. The giant drops the &lt;a href=\"Hawk%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Hawk Ring&lt;/a&gt; upon defeat, an accessory that allows arrows to travel a longer distance."}

The door on the left leads towards the Giant Blacksmith, but initially it is locked and can only be opened from the other side, which can be accessed only after clearing most of Anor Londo.\nRemember to open the locked door leading back to the Sentinels, so it is easier to access the blacksmith from the other &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlot.\nThe Giant Blacksmith sells a variety of useful &lt;a href=\"upgrade%20materials\"&gt;upgrade materials&lt;/a&gt; as well as weapons and &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, and is the only blacksmith that can upgrade down the &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;lightning path&lt;/a&gt; (by default), the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;crystal path&lt;/a&gt; (after he receives the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Ember\"&gt;Crystal Ember&lt;/a&gt;), and make &lt;a href=\"Boss%20Soul%20Weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Boss%20Souls\"&gt;souls of bosses&lt;/a&gt;.

It does not mention much other than that, though.\nThe Giant Blacksmith had a friendly relationship with &lt;a href=\"Hawkeye%20Gough\"&gt;Hawkeye Gough&lt;/a&gt;. This is hinted at the &lt;a href=\"Hawk%20Ring\"&gt;Hawk Ring&lt;/a&gt; found in a chest next to him, as well as Hawkeye Gough's friendly remarks about the Giant Blacksmith.\nHis corpse is found in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;, on the same spot he used to reside.

He also assumes the Giant Blacksmith already died a long time ago.\nStrategy.\nIt is not recommended to attack him for he is very strong and the services he offers cannot be replaced. However, he is the only character to drop the &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20Giant%20Hammer\"&gt;Blacksmith Giant Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, and so must be defeated for completionists. He has the standard &lt;a href=\"Giant\"&gt;Giant&lt;/a&gt; moveset.\nNotes.\nLocated in the corner next to him is a chest containing the &lt;a href=\"Hawk%20Ring\"&gt;Hawk Ring&lt;/a&gt;.

The Giant Door Shields can be found at the end of a path leading to the bottom of a cliff, where another Thrall guards it.\nCharacteristics.\nPerhaps the most unconventional weapon in \"Dark Souls III\", the Giant Door Shields are towering titans that grant strong defensive power with its attacks.\nWhile classified as paired greatshields, these shields function more akin to &lt;a href=\"Fists%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;fist&lt;/a&gt; weapons, albeit significantly slower. The greatshields perform bashing attacks using the shields as weapons. Unlike normal shields that have limited attacks to back their strictly defensive purpose, the Giant Door Shields possess a robust if short-ranged moveset that allows the wielder to fight offensively with a truly unique playstyle.\nWhat makes the Giant Door Shields so powerful is their ability to utilize block frames (similar to &lt;a href=\"Valorheart\"&gt;Valorheart&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt; during attacks, which also cannot be &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parried&lt;/a&gt; under any circumstances due to their nature as ultra weapons. This means that by taking advantage of &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;, the Giant Door Shields are extremely difficult to interrupt once in motion, and most physical attacks will be easily shrugged off by the weapon's block frames.\nOf course, all these strengths come at a steep price. The Door Shields have an extremely high &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; requirement, demand heavy &lt;a href=\"Vitality%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt; investment to support their weight, and consume extreme amounts of &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; to attack and to block, forcing the wielder to invest in &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt;. As well, their wooden nature makes them quite vulnerable to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage, which can only be protected against by utilizing its &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpgrades.\nReinforced with &lt;a href=\"Upgrade%20Materials%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Titanite&lt;/a&gt;."}

Evading is the best way to avoid these attacks, as the player can become overwhelmed by sheer numbers if they try to attack the flies. One should be careful not to let themselves be cornered by them, as they can completely decimate one's HP if they attack all at once."}

He appears to be the leader of the giants and unlike his subjects, who wield crude clubs, he wields a giant sword. Upon death, he drops the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Lord%20Soul\"&gt;Giant Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Giant%27s%20Kinship\"&gt;Giant's Kinship&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"New%20Game%20Plus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;NG+&lt;/a&gt; and beyond, he will also drop the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Giants\"&gt;Ring of Giants&lt;/a&gt;+2.\nLocations.\nThe Giant Lord is found within the &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Jeigh\"&gt;Memory of Jeigh&lt;/a&gt;, past the door that requires the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Ring\"&gt;King's Ring&lt;/a&gt; to open in the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20of%20Fallen%20Giants\"&gt;Forest of Fallen Giants&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0The area in which you fight him is the same location you fight &lt;a href=\"The%20Pursuer\"&gt;The Pursuer&lt;/a&gt;, but without the balistae, and ledge walls.\nLore.\nThe Giant Lord is the king of all &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Giants&lt;/a&gt;. After his kingdom was invaded by &lt;a href=\"Vendrick\"&gt;King Vendrick&lt;/a&gt;, who was under the influence of &lt;a href=\"Nashandra\"&gt;Nashandra&lt;/a&gt;, the Giant Lord invaded &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; to avenge his losses, and to retrieve the prize that Vendrick stole from him. Possessing a will of iron, the giants laid siege to Drangleic in a war that lasted for generations, and laid waste to the once proud kingdom. Eventually the Giant Lord was defeated by an &lt;a href=\"Bearer%20of%20the%20Curse\"&gt;unknown hero&lt;/a&gt;, and the giants retreated, crossing the sea to return home. The Giant Lord himself, broken and beaten, was dragged beneath the fort where he fell, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Giant\"&gt;imprisoned&lt;/a&gt; there.\nStrategy.\nCaution must be taken because the way to the Giant Lord is just as dangerous as the boss itself and at times more lethal. The platform is bombarded by fireballs at the entrance (near the fog gate) and at the end (near the Giant Lord).\nAlong the way the head of a statue will come down and roll across the platform killing everything in its path. There are several safe spots to the left and right so it's advisable to either wait for the head to stop rolling or quickly run to the safe spot in the middle.\u00a0\nThe strategy for the Giant Lord is very similar to the Last Giant, staying between his legs will usually be enough to avoid most of his attacks.\u00a0\nHe does, however, have some nasty tricks: he has a sword slash that covers the right side of his body and his back. This is by far his deadliest attack, not to mention the back is usually the safest spot for a large boss, so it can catch someone by surprise. Standing behind him is usually what triggers this attack, so attack and quickly roll between his legs.\u00a0\nAs you're approaching, he will often do an overhead swing followed with a shockwave which travels in a straight line, however it's easily dodged or hidden away from.\u00a0\nPyromancers can have an easier time if they have access to Fire Tempest or Chaos storm as the boss rarely moves and will be hit with all the pillars of fire. For the same reason, &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Mist%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poison Mist and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20Mist%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Toxic Mist&lt;/a&gt; work as well, as the boss rarely moves, it's extraordinarily easy to inflict both Poison and Toxic, dealing at least 45 damage a second until it wears off.\u00a0\nIf the player has any magic at their disposal they can remain safe on the platform to the left of the Giant Lord as the boss seems incapable of climbing stairs and so will be easy to hit. The only two attacks player needs to worry about are an overhead slam and sweeping swing. Both can kill the player instantly if the player is on low health. Otherwise, any form of magic makes this a fairly easy fight, and a good farming location for Giant Lord souls.\nMelee fighters may find it easier to do this fight unlocked, as the camera tends to spin in strange directions owing to the small area in which the Giant Lord is fought. This can also make it easier to see his tells before his attacks.\nIf one stands on the ledge to the left, the Giant Lord will limit his attacks to just swinging his sword, making them easier to avoid overall, regardless of the character's class.\nSummoning.\nOnly one of these summons can be used for the fight:\nAttacks.\nOverhead Slam:\u00a0A one-handed overhead attack with his sword. If at a distance, the slam will be followed with a shockwave that travels in a straight line. Easily dodged or even side-stepped.\nHorizontal Slash: A simple slash with his sword.\u00a0\nBackwards Sweep:\u00a0A powerful slash that covers his right side and back. Can be followed up with an overhead slam.\nStomp:\u00a0He will stomp the player once he is under him.\u00a0\nDefenses.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense.\nDrops.\nThe Giant Lord drops 75,000\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Souls%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0upon defeat."}

They can be encountered either with groups of normal &lt;a href=\"Man%20Serpent\"&gt;Man Serpent&lt;/a&gt;s or even with others of their own, large-sized kind. They are surprisingly fast, almost equaling a sprinting player's speed, and will chase relentlessly for long distances once they engage in combat.\nTheir offensive capabilities are not restricted just to the weapons they wield; they have the ability to breathe devastating streams of &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, which they will spray in a clockwise arc in front of them.\nIf the player is attacking from behind, it may swing its neck around and grab them with its jaws, lifting them from the ground and lashing them back down for high damage.\nThere are two variants:\nChain-axe:A slightly thinner version that wields a retractable chain-axe. The long chain fastened to their weapons allow them to attack from a considerable distance, giving them long-range combat capabilities. The blade can deal damage both on its way outward and on return. Their weapons can frequently clip through walls and ceilings, allowing them to inflict damage even if the player is in an adjacent room.\nGreataxe:The largest of all Man Serpents. These enemies wield an oversized battleaxe and specialize in performing powerful wide swings one after another, draining huge amounts of &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; and easily &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Break\"&gt;breaking the player's guard&lt;/a&gt; in just a few attacks. Their moveset has some similarities with that of the &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Knight\"&gt;Winged Knight&lt;/a&gt;s, notably their spin attack.\nLocations.\nFound in &lt;a href=\"Archdragon%20Peak\"&gt;Archdragon Peak&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nGiant Man Serpents are very dangerous enemies and should never be rushed; instead, they should be approached more strategically.\nIt is not recommended to confront them if there are other enemies around, so it's better to dispatch of all hostiles in the vicinity before even attempting to deal with them.\nOnce a Giant Man Serpent engages in battle, it will chase after the player relentlessly with surprising speed. Their long-reach weapons and excellent tracking may even allow them to successfully hit a player at medium distance whilst they are attempting to escape.\nFortunately, in all the locations where they are encountered, they can be lured near structures where it is possible to perform &lt;a href=\"Plunging%20Attack%23Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;plunging attacks&lt;/a&gt; on them. Apart from receiving heavy damage, they will be left heavily staggered afterward and ready for a quick finish.\nWhen they are dealt a large amount of damage in quick succession, they will stagger and be extra vulnerable for a short period of time. However, this does not allow for critical hits, nor can they be backstabbed.\nGiant Serpent Men are notorious for their bad footing and frequently fall off ledges. This can be exploited by luring them near narrow spaces where they may accidentally fall to their demise."}

They spawn one at a time from a few pre-defined spawn-spots. These spots are often found in pairs, and sometimes alone. As soon as one giant mosquito is killed, a new one will spawn in its place. Although it may seem like they respawn indefinitely, they'll stop respawning after 6 spawns (7 giant mosquitoes).\nDescription.\nGiant Mosquitoes can sight their prey from far away. Once close, they spread blood into the air, which is a short ranged &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;poisonous&lt;/a&gt; projectile; their sting is also poisonous.\nStrategy.\nGiant mosquitoes are not particularly difficult enemies. Their strongest skill is being very small, and weapons have a tendency to swing below them and miss. Weapons that swing vertically tend to hit more often, but will still miss frequently when the giant mosquito is too close. Ranged weaponry (&lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;s, magics) tend to very rarely miss, and is one of the most reliable way to kill them.\nTrivia.\nPrior to patch 1.04/1.05, killing Giant Mosquitoes yielded no &lt;a href=\"Soul%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt;."}

Most of them are several stories tall but the ones guarding the path to &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; are significantly shorter, although still tower over the player.

Their attacks are very slow but deal tremendous damage and even the aftershock can cause injury. The easiest way to slay them is to wear them down with ranged weapons from under cover, although they will need to be aggroed to prevent them losing interest and falling asleep. This method can be used to defeat the first Giant Slave in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Cathedral of the Deep&lt;/a&gt; and the one in the basement of &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20Dungeon\"&gt;Irithyll Dungeon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe two giants in the Cathedral reside in a pool of sludge that heavily restricts movement. If the player wishes to fight them conventionally, then they should stay behind the giant and attack its feet, this will avoid their arm swipes but they should still be mindful of their stomps. If engaging them at a distance, they can throw sludge at the player, so they should stay mobile.\nThe smaller giants in &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll&lt;/a&gt; are much weaker than the other versions and have a moveset very similar to the &lt;a href=\"Giant\"&gt;Giant&lt;/a&gt;s of \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\". They are most vulnerable after performing their frenzy combo, although it is recommended to eliminate the &lt;a href=\"Deacon\"&gt;Deacon&lt;/a&gt;s patrolling the area before engaging them, as they will periodically cast fireball spells which do a surprising amount of damage.\nDrops.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Cathedral of the Deep =\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

In turn, it is the heaviest Greataxe, as well as one of the shortest.\nThe sweetspot for maximum damage covers nearly the entire length of the weapon. This means that the Giant Stone Axe's damage output will be more consistent than longer Greataxes without having to worry about proper spacing, although the weapon's short reach will make actually hitting enemies harder.\nThe unupgraded Giant Stone Axe is an extremely underwhelming weapon, with low base damage and scaling, but it quickly improves as it is upgraded. This, combined with its various drawbacks, makes the Giant Stone Axe far less accessible in the early game than it might initially seem. While this can be circumvented through careful stat allocation and knowing how to obtain the required materials, it may be prudent to save the weapon for later into a playthrough when its requirements are less cumbersome. For more accessible early game Greataxes, players may want to consider the standard &lt;a href=\"Greataxes%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Greataxe&lt;/a&gt;, or the unorthodox &lt;a href=\"Bandit%20Greataxe\"&gt;Bandit Greataxe&lt;/a&gt;, as a bridging weapon until later."}

They are physically distinguished by a tall, powerful body, long arms, short, stubby legs and a small head. Although the workers/slaves express themselves in simple sentences, the giants have proven to be able to easily understand human language, converse and produce refined objects, demonstrating a normal level of intelligence comparable to that of other advanced races. Depending on their roles they wear different clothes. The Judicators wear a long black robe that covers them from neck to toe, the Sentinels wear heavy golden iron armor with decorated plates or white drapes, the giants who appear to be workers or slaves wear chain mail reinforced by metal plates.\nLore.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough the history of the giant race is completely shrouded in mystery, they have been strongly connected to the &lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;Gods&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; since the times of their War against the &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;Archdragons&lt;/a&gt;. The giant &lt;a href=\"Hawkeye%20Gough\"&gt;Hawkeye Gough&lt;/a&gt; led a group of giants known as the Greatarchers Dragonslayers alongside Lord Gwyn's &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Knight\"&gt;Silver Knight&lt;/a&gt;s. These giants represented the archers who had to fight the high-flying dragons from afar and employed &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Greatbow\"&gt;immense bows&lt;/a&gt; that had to be anchored to the ground when fired and employed &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Arrow\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; that resembled iron spears.\nCough himself possessed a &lt;a href=\"Gough%27s%20Greatbow\"&gt;greatbow&lt;/a&gt; even larger than the archers he led and was the only one with the strength necessary to handle it. He distinguished himself on the battlefield as a dragonslayer and received from Lord Gwyn himself a golden medallion and dragon bone pauldrons as ornaments for his armor, crafted with a similar material of those worn by the Silver Knights symbolizing the highest honors for a warrior. Gwyn further rewarded the giant for his invaluable contribution to the war against the dragons, giving him a fragment of his &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Soul\"&gt;Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Hawk%20Ring\"&gt;magical ring&lt;/a&gt; with the hawk symbol capable of increasing the range of his bows and made him one of his &lt;a href=\"Four%20Knights%20of%20Gwyn\"&gt;Four Knights&lt;/a&gt;, the highest rank in his army and the most trusted knights of the king.\nAfter the end of the great war, Lord Gwyn and his clan gained dominion over the world and began their Age of Fire and the giants continued to coexist with their civilization in a subordinate but close position. A large numbers of giants became &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s guarding the walls and streets of Anor Londo, the city of the gods, employing &lt;a href=\"Giant%27s%20Halberd\"&gt;giant halberd&lt;/a&gt;s made of brass and retaining the power of lightning, &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Shield\"&gt;giant shield&lt;/a&gt;s of white iron and &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Set\"&gt;heavy armor&lt;/a&gt; of finely decorated golden brass. An even more powerful group of giants defended the royal cathedral in the center of the city and were capable of performing healing and offensive miracles.\nAfter the death of the &lt;a href=\"Nameless%20Blacksmith%20Deity\"&gt;Blacksmith Deity&lt;/a&gt; who was responsible for forging the weapons and armor of the gods, his task was assigned to a &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Blacksmith\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt; who thus became the new blacksmith of the gods and came to work and reside inside the cathedral of Anor Londo. Among many things, he was responsible for creating the &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Greatarrow\"&gt;Dragonslayer Greatarrow&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Lightning%20Arrow\"&gt;Dragonslayer Lightning Arrow&lt;/a&gt;s used by dragonsalyers during the sporting hunts of the age of the gods. However he also created &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt;s infused with the power of lightning made for humans, as during those times humans were still servants of the gods\nAfter Lord Gwyn's sacrifice to revive the fading First Flame, &lt;a href=\"Giant\"&gt;Giant&lt;/a&gt;s were used as slaves in &lt;a href=\"Sen%27s%20Fortress\"&gt;Sen's Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, a fortress built on the only route leading to the city of the gods to serve as a testing ground for the Undead that managed to overcome the first challenge of the &lt;a href=\"Bells%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Bells of Awakening&lt;/a&gt; and seeked to enter Anor Londo to receive the &lt;a href=\"Lordvessel\"&gt;Lordvessel&lt;/a&gt;. After ringing the &lt;a href=\"Bells%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Bell of Awakening&lt;/a&gt;, an enslaved giant would recognize that an Undead has completed the first trial of their quest and open the gate to allow them to enter the fortress. Additionally other chained giantss were used as gatekeepers, living launchers of firebombs and loaders a machine which will send boulders rolling throughout the fortress, creating environmental hazards capable of destroying those who wandered around the location.\nSometime around the fall of &lt;a href=\"Oolacile\"&gt;Oolacile&lt;/a&gt; due to the Abyss generated by the out-of-control &lt;a href=\"Manus%2C%20Father%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Manus&lt;/a&gt;, Gough arrived there but was imprisoned in a tower sealed by powerful magic by the citizens of the country. The eye holes of his helm were packed with tree resin by those who dismissed the force of the giant as brutish, indicating a feeling of racism towards the giants by humans.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;.\nWIP\nTheories.\nIt is possible to theorize that Giants and Gods belong to two very close races in evolutionary terms. This is because of their history of constant and close collaboration and coexistence, the fact that the giants of Anor Londo are vulnerable to the power of heretical weapons like the clan of gods and that in the \"&lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Tomb of the Giants&lt;/a&gt;\", where &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Skeleton\"&gt;Giant Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s are found, even the gods were buried."}

To preserve their influence over the world, Gwyn sacrificed himself by entering the Kiln of the First Flame, where his strength would keep the Flame alive.\nPlot.\nDark Souls.\nAfter Lord Gwyn entered the Kiln of the First Flame, most of the gods abandoned &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;, leaving behind a small army of Silver Knights and two elite knights: &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Slayer%20Ornstein\"&gt;Dragon Slayer Ornstein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Executioner%20Smough\"&gt;Executioner Smough&lt;/a&gt;, to protect the city. Much more shady was the role of &lt;a href=\"Gwyndolin\"&gt;Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt;, the only true God that remained in Anor Londo. He created an illusion of &lt;a href=\"Gwynevere%2C%20Princess%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Gwynevere&lt;/a&gt;, Lord Gwyn's daughter, to hide the fact that she had left Anor Londo and married the &lt;a href=\"Flame%20God%20Flann\"&gt;Flame God, Flann&lt;/a&gt;. Gwyndolin has the same goal as &lt;a href=\"Kingseeker%20Frampt\"&gt;Kingseeker Frampt&lt;/a&gt;, using the illusion of Gwynevere to convince the Chosen Undead to rekindle the First Flame. Gwyndolin seems to survive the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\" as he is being consumed by &lt;a href=\"Aldrich%2C%20Devourer%20of%20Gods\"&gt;Aldrich, Devourer of Gods&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;\", implying that the Chosen Undead either did not fight him or only defeated an illusion of him in the timeline canon to the latter game.\nThe members of the race of the gods and their priests were buried inside the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Tomb of the Giants&lt;/a&gt; overseen by &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Nito\"&gt;Gravelord Nito&lt;/a&gt;.\nDark Souls II.\nThe gods are mostly forgotten by this point in time, with their names unknown, though there remains the ruins of old cities who once worshiped the old gods. The souls of the three Lords are said to have been reborn and try to influence the world despite being mere fragments.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;.\nEven after the awakening of the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20One\"&gt;Ashen One&lt;/a&gt;, the influence of several gods or their descendants is still present in the world.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Dark Sun Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt;, once the king of the gods and of Irithyll, had been imprisoned in the city's old cathedral by &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Sulyvahn\"&gt;Pontiff Sulyvahn&lt;/a&gt;, that stripped him of his power to rule in his place. However &lt;a href=\"Aldrich%2C%20Devourer%20of%20Gods\"&gt;Aldrich, Devourer of Gods&lt;/a&gt; had arrived in Irithyll and, after defeating Sulyvahn, he began to devour Gwyndolin. &lt;a href=\"Company%20Captain%20Yorshka\"&gt;Yorshka&lt;/a&gt;, Gwyndolin'sister, is still alive and leads the knights's of the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Darkmoon\"&gt;Blade of the Darkmoon&lt;/a&gt; covenant, but she has been imprisoned by Sulyvahn in an isolated tower.\n&lt;a href=\"Gwynevere%2C%20Princess%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; was the Queen of Lothric and conceiving &lt;a href=\"Lorian%2C%20Elder%20Prince%20and%20Lothric%2C%20Younger%20Prince\"&gt;Lorian, Elder Prince and Lothric, Younger Prince&lt;/a&gt;, the younger son destined to link the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;. However, after Lothric refused to fulfill his duty, &lt;a href=\"Oceiros%2C%20the%20Consumed%20King\"&gt;King Oceiros&lt;/a&gt; became obsessed with the power of dragons .

However, the clerics of Carim also began using talismans that employed intelligence and cast dark miracles and freely devoted themselves to the creation of forbidden rings, implying that the goddess leaves a lot of freedom for her clerics to investigate the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt;.

Buff lasts for 11 seconds.\nUsage.\nUnlike resins, which require the user to remain stationary while applying the buff, bundles take less than a second to activate and can be used while moving. While they grant more damage than their respective resins and many more bundles can be carried at once, the trade-off is that the duration of the buff is reduced to less than 20% of that of a resin.\nThe quick application time, high stock and low duration of these items makes them very flexible tools, useful for applying in the midst of combat based on the situation. Whereas a resin may find a large fraction of its duration wasted from inactivity between attacks, a bundle may be quickly activated when an opportunity to deal damage presents itself, and the advantage pressed until the buff expires. This includes, in particular, the short duration of vulnerability between &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parrying a foe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;taking the riposte&lt;/a&gt;."}

The duration is long enough for most encounters at 1 minute. At the highest levels of upgrading, a regular weapon buffed with Gold Pine Resin is stronger than a Lightning weapon equivalent, especially when considering &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"scaling\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt;. For example, an &lt;a href=\"Iaito\"&gt;Iaito&lt;/a&gt; +15 enchanted with Gold Pine Resin deals more damage than a Lightning Iaito +5 given a decent Dexterity level.\nGold Pine Resin pales in comparison to &lt;a href=\"weapon%20augmentation\"&gt;weapon augmentation&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Blade\"&gt;Sunlight Blade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Magic%20Weapon\"&gt;Crystal Magic Weapon&lt;/a&gt;; however, it is the best choice available as a weapon buff for those that do not boast a high &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; level."}

This weapon is the only weapon in the game that performs two special attacks while it is in the left hand, eschewing the ability to &lt;a href=\"parry\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt; for a heavy attack in the off hand. When the sword is swung it will create an orange-gold visual effect.\nUsing this sword in conjunction with the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Silver%20Tracer\"&gt;Dark Silver Tracer&lt;/a&gt; is a good match up as it allows the player to deal &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt; damage from the Gold Tracer at a rate of 40 per strike, as well as &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Toxic&lt;/a&gt; damage with Dark Silver Tracer's strong attack (which can only be done with the right hand). The &lt;a href=\"moveset\"&gt;moveset&lt;/a&gt; for the Gold Tracer is similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Painting%20Guardian%20Sword\"&gt;Painting Guardian Sword&lt;/a&gt;. Though unlike PGS, this weapon cannot be &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Augmentation\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt;. \nMoveset.\nWhen equipped in the left hand, instead of a parry (L2) and single attack (L1), the right handed strong attacks are used instead (L1 is the first attack, and L2 is the follow up attack). Uniquely for left-handed attacks, it still retains the event state of a parry although it has no parry frames, allowing for it to be cancelled for a Parry Backstab."}

However, what makes this weapon so unusual is that while it casts &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Sorceries&lt;/a&gt;, its &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Buff\"&gt;Spell Buff&lt;/a&gt; scales entirely off of &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt;.

This means that the wielder must invest heavily into multiple stats simply to use this weapon. Ideally, in order to be efficient as possible Intelligence is only leveled up enough to cast moderately small spells like &lt;a href=\"Great%20Soul%20Arrow\"&gt;Great Soul Arrow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Snap%20Freeze\"&gt;Snap Freeze&lt;/a&gt;, while the remaining levels are put into Faith to increase their potency.\nMoveset.\n&lt;br&gt;\nUpgrades.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

Due to this fact, it is recommended to infuse it with Magic to reach its maximum potential.

However, using this attack consumes 30 &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; points.\nThe Golem Axe is on the heavier end of Axes, and has a slow swing. It has high damage, but cannot be &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Augmentation\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt;. Its strongest trait, though, is its versatility. It is both a melee weapon and a ranged weapon. Furthermore, its ranged attack will inflict \"melee\" type damage, inflicting both &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; and serious &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; damage: enough to stagger most opponents. The ranged attack is also relatively fast, and will often take opponents by surprise. However, while the blast travels fast, the wind up to the special attack is quite long in comparison. Despite this, the special attack can be used faster than a lot of &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;sorceries&lt;/a&gt;, also interrupting the caster. The Golem Axe comes with a dozen \"charges\" before requiring repairs.\nLike all &lt;a href=\"Axes\"&gt;Axes&lt;/a&gt;, if an attack doesn't connect with an enemy, the user will stumble and seem to not be able to handle the weight. If the hit connects, the stumble animation does not come into play and the user moves as normal. This makes this weapon capable of gaining &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28Dark%20Souls%29%23Sweet%2520Spot%2520Damage%2520Bonus\"&gt;Sweet Spot Damage&lt;/a&gt; bonus. "}

Due to its nature as a lance, it deals an exceptional amount of &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt; damage for its attack speed, making it extremely effective at holding choke points against large groups of enemies.\nAt 40 &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;dexterity&lt;/a&gt;, this weapon deals the highest physical damage out of the &lt;a href=\"Lances\"&gt;Lances&lt;/a&gt;. It is also one of only two Lances that can be buffed with a resin, the other being the &lt;a href=\"Rampart%20Golem%20Lance\"&gt;Rampart Golem Lance&lt;/a&gt;. It is also relatively light for its damage output.\nAll of this combines to make the Grand Lance an ideal choice for a purely physical build. But even so, &lt;a href=\"Infusion\"&gt;infusing&lt;/a&gt; it with elemental damage can also be effective.\nNotes.\nAt +10, the Grand Lance has 340 damage and C/C scaling"}

The torso leans forwards as well, giving him a hunchback appearance, and his true skull is tucked into the dead matter and bones. His left leg is built like those on a dog or other four legged creature, while his right leg is humanlike, giving him a sort of handicap and reducing his movement to a slow limp. The other skeletons merely adorn him as armor, with his entire torso covered in ribcages and skulls, and arms and legs dangling all around him.\nWhat was once an all concealing cloak looking like black fur or feather, apparently conjured at will, is reduced to a tattered hairlike cloak. When dormant, Nito did not seem to wear it until after generating a glowing fume of lavender white power, likely the \"miasma of death\" he is known for. His left hand is natural, his right is equipped with a triple bone forearm, which terminates in a sharpened bone blade covered with his miasma.\nLore.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;.\nNito is one of the primordial humanoid creatures that appeared underground after the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; appeared, bringing life, death and \"disparity\". He was one of those who found the four &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Soul\"&gt;Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt;s, souls of immense power, together with &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Witch of Izalith&lt;/a&gt; and much later the &lt;a href=\"Furtive%20Pygmy\"&gt;Furtive Pygmy&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point Nito would die but, thanks to the power of his soul, he was able to come back to life with necromancy, becoming a living mass of conjoined skeletons and the \"first of the dead\". Nito thus learned to harness the power of his Lord Soul to produce a dark power capable of bringing death to every living being and he infused it in his &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Sword\"&gt;Gravelord Sword&lt;/a&gt;, crafted with the bones of the fallen and exuding his miasma of death as a toxin letal for any living being\nHe would then ally himself with the other Lords, Gwyn and Izalith, and take part in their war against the &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;s apparently alone. While Gwyn peeled the scales of the dragons with his lightning bolts and fought them together with his Silver Knights and Izalith and her witches weaved great firestorms, destroying the archtrees and burning the dragons, Nito unleashed his miasma of death, rotting the archtrees and infecting the dragons. And so, after a long struggle, Nito and the Lords emerged victorious, exterminating most of the archdragons and thus conquering the world.\nAfter the war, while Gwyn developed his civilization of &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; and Izalith that of &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Izalith\"&gt;Izalith&lt;/a&gt;, Nito returned to the depths of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Catacombs\"&gt;Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;, an immense necropolis, to slumber within the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Tomb of the Giants&lt;/a&gt;, an even deeper place that housed the skeletons of &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Skeleton\"&gt;enormous&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Beast\"&gt;bestial creatures&lt;/a&gt; and turning the caves into his domain of light-devouring death. In addition, the deceased members of the race of the &lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;Gods&lt;/a&gt; of Anor Londo and their priests also rested in the Tombs of the Giants, implying how Nito continued to collaborate with Gwyn by offering the Lord his domain to bury his people and servants. Nito would thus take on the role of administering the death of all manner of beings, directly offering much of his Lord Soul to continue propagating death, becoming known with the title of \"Tomb King\".\nHowever, Nito did not carry out the task in complete solitude but would have accepted the brave humans who had visited his tomb and wished to serve him, becoming part of the covenant of the &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Servant\"&gt;Gravelord Servant&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAfter having received a &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Sword\"&gt;Gravelord Sword&lt;/a&gt; infused with a toxin lethal for every being, their task would have been to employ the &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20Death\"&gt;Eyes of Death&lt;/a&gt; to spread disaster across time and space, causing hostile spirits to invade them and thus bringing more ruin and allowing the Eyes of Death to multiply and continue to spread death. As Nito continued to oversee death in the world he would accept proof of his servants' success in the form of new Eyes of Death, rewarding them with his &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Sword%20Dance\"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt; capable of summoning magical copies of his &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Sword\"&gt;Gravelord Sword&lt;/a&gt; and for his closest servant the ability to use a stronger &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Greatsword%20Dance\"&gt;ritual&lt;/a&gt; produced with the offering of much death and many Eyes\nAt one point Nito created a &lt;a href=\"Rite%20of%20Kindling\"&gt;ritual&lt;/a&gt; capable of further bolstering &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;bonfires&lt;/a&gt; using Kindlings so that &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; can collect even more &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask\"&gt;Estus&lt;/a&gt; from them. The ritual was employed by clerics of the Way of White, and the Undead can imitate the process in the same manner by consuming their Humanity at bonfires. The connection therefore implies Nito's involvement in the religious system of the gods who was looking for a \"chosen one\" among the Undead capable of linking the First Flame and following Gwyn's sacrifice\nAt some point, a necromancer known as \"&lt;a href=\"Pinwheel\"&gt;Pinwheel&lt;/a&gt;\" and composed of the fusion of a father, a mother and a son, arrived in the Catacombs and managed to steal Nito's &lt;a href=\"Rite%20of%20Kindling\"&gt;Rite of Kindling&lt;/a&gt; and part of his power, using it to continue studying necromancy and reign over the Catacombs with his &lt;a href=\"Pinwheel%20Servant\"&gt;servants&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s who employed the area's skeletons as an army.\nAt a certain point the followers of &lt;a href=\"Occult%20%28auxiliary%20effect%29\"&gt;occult powers&lt;/a&gt;, armed with &lt;a href=\"Effigy%20Shield\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; to defend themselves from divine weapons and lightning, descended into the Catacombs and attempted to steal Nito's mortal power to use it in a plot to kill the gods, but ended up failing and dying inside his dark domain.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt; was able to ring the &lt;a href=\"Bells%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Bells of Awakening&lt;/a&gt;, overcome the challenges of &lt;a href=\"Sen%27s%20Fortress\"&gt;Sen's Fortress&lt;/a&gt; and reach &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; thus being rewarded with the &lt;a href=\"Lordvessel\"&gt;Lordvessel&lt;/a&gt;, they would be guided by &lt;a href=\"Kingseeker%20Frampt\"&gt;Kingseeker Frampt&lt;/a&gt; to find immense souls to fill the receptacle and link the fading &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; to succeed Gwyn in his sacrifice. The Undead would thus have delved into the Catacombs until they reached the sarcophagus in which Nito rested, challenging and killed him to obtain what remained of his Lord Soul.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point after the emergence of the &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; connected to the fading of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; Nito took measures to deal with the beings that defied the death he oversaw. He thus created the &lt;a href=\"Grave%20Warden%20Agdayne\"&gt;Fenito&lt;/a&gt;, beings capable of weave death and with the task of watching over the dead, giving them his &lt;a href=\"Darkdrift\"&gt;Darkdrift&lt;/a&gt;. Their philosophy is that death is equitable and accepting and everyone will, one day be welcomed by her embrace. As life is suffering or karma the embrace of death awaits everyone but for the Undead this was not possible and they would have to take care of it. He also created the &lt;a href=\"Milfanito\"&gt;Milfanito&lt;/a&gt;, women who had little concept of self, and taught them to sing, making them enchanting singers with the task of comforting the undead, as those bound by death and darkness. They live only to sing and will continue to do so until they can do so no longer.\nAfter an immense amount of time since Nito's death due to a Chosen Undead, the Fenito and Milfanito continued to serve their purpose and and carrying out the will of the \"Great Dead One\", arriving in &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; where they positioned themselves to manage the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Crypt\"&gt;Undead Crypt&lt;/a&gt;, a place of rest for the \"living\" where those afflicted by the curse of Undeath could only pray to one day gain entrance. With the centuries countless dead came there to rest in peace cradled by the comfort of darkness, some where rich, other poor, some wise, some dull but the Fenito made sure they all remained just dead, employing &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Appease\"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt; that dealt heavy damage to mindless Hollows so that they could return to being dead, and &lt;a href=\"Warmth\"&gt;pyromancies&lt;/a&gt; to create a gentle flame to heal and comfort the Hollows. The Fenitos thus became the &lt;a href=\"Grave%20Warden\"&gt;Grave Warden&lt;/a&gt;s who were charged with watching over the Crypt and its slumbering dead, making sure that they were not awoken, readily burying whoever tried to disturb their rest along with the others, making no allowance for statures or riches. Their silverblack equipment was soaked and imbued with the power of the darkness that enveloped the crypt.The Milfanito also helped with their task, continuing to sing to comfort the deceased who rested in Undead Crypt. The marshlands before the Crypt also became the home of the &lt;a href=\"Brightbug\"&gt;Brightbug&lt;/a&gt;s, a tiny bug that produces light and is said to comfort the dead. These creatures were born from the corpse of Nito and they dance to the song of the Milfanito\nThe Grave Wardens thus continued to defend the crypt and making sure that the dead remained undisturbed by the influences of the outside world. A &lt;a href=\"Insolent%20Set\"&gt;party of cleric knights&lt;/a&gt; would try to conquer the crypt but they failed and for their sin the wardens postponed their deaths, forcing them to serve as crypt sentries and leaving their leaders to wander aimlessly in the depths of darkness. Another &lt;a href=\"Imperious%20Knight\"&gt;party of imperious knights&lt;/a&gt; attempted to conquer the crypt, wielding only a shield split in halves and depicting two messengers from their hereafter who welcome the recently dead by reviewing the merits of their deeds in life. However they were defeated and turned into crypt guardians, never allowing them to rest in peace.\nAt one point the &lt;a href=\"Leydia%20Witch\"&gt;Leydia Witch&lt;/a&gt;es reached the Undead Crypt. They were a group adept at magic and were able to use miracles, pyromancy, sorcery and even hexes at high levels with their &lt;a href=\"Black%20Witch%27s%20Staff\"&gt;special staves&lt;/a&gt; and worshiped &lt;a href=\"Galib%2C%20God%20of%20Disease\"&gt;Galib, God of Disease&lt;/a&gt;. The witches were welcomed into the crypt in which they ended up residing beside the Fenito, collaborating with them in their tasks and sharing their power of death. However at a certain point the Leydia Witches grew conceived and began to manipulate both the onset and curing of disease, making themselves the effective gatekeepers of the crypt. Their misuse of death and their failure to treat it with the proper respect invoked the ire of the Fenito, that branded them as transegressors, blasphemous and traitors and hunted them down, denying them a peaceful death and slaughtering them most of them.\nAn immense amount of time after his &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Soul\"&gt;Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt; was used to link the First Flame, Nito's very name was lost and in the region of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; the few who still remember his existence refer to him as \"Great Dead One\". However, some &lt;a href=\"Old%20Dead%20One%20Soul\"&gt;remnants of his soul&lt;/a&gt; manifested again in Drangleic, continuing to exert their influence on the region. \nAt some point a butcher came into contact with the soul of Nito deep inside the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Gulch\"&gt;Black Gulch&lt;/a&gt;. The mass of dark power transformed his body and he became a creature formed by a huge mass of hollows fused together known as the &lt;a href=\"The%20Rotten\"&gt;Rotten&lt;/a&gt;. It kept writhing deep within the Gutter, embracing all the abominations that fell deep inside the Gulch and creating a sanctuary for all things rotten or tossed away. He would keep producing the &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Statue%20Cluster\"&gt;Poison Statue Cluster&lt;/a&gt;s, artifacts that release the deadly toxin that covers the tunnels of the Black Gulch.\nStrategies.\nWhen falling into Nito's domain, some damage will be incurred. This can be negated through use of the &lt;a href=\"Fall%20Control\"&gt;Fall Control&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;sorcery&lt;/a&gt;. If Fall Control is unavailable, make sure to &lt;a href=\"Healing\"&gt;heal&lt;/a&gt; once landed, preferably with &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Estus&lt;/a&gt; as the other forms might not be fast enough to avoid Nito's ranged attack.\nNito is a very large, very slow boss with average &lt;a href=\"HP\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;. This makes large weapons and slow spells excellent candidates for dealing damage to him quickly. Nito's attacks often cause toxin and can be quite damaging, but almost all of them have a very long startup time and are easily avoidable. All of the attacks except the sword dance can be blocked.\nNito is aided by some minor Skeletons initially, and &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Skeleton\"&gt;Giant Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s if the player ventures too far from the place they fell down from. Both types of Skeletons resurrect after being killed, unless they are killed with a &lt;a href=\"Divine%20%28auxiliary%20effect%29\"&gt;Divine&lt;/a&gt; weapon (even with a Divine weapon a Phantom can't kill the skeletons, only the Host can). They are no tougher than the Skeletons found throughout &lt;a href=\"The%20Catacombs\"&gt;The Catacombs&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Tomb of the Giants&lt;/a&gt;, but may prove to be a fatal distraction to fighting Nito himself. Because Nito is so slow, it is a good idea to kill all of his minions with a Divine weapon before engaging with him, so the skeletons will not get in the way. As long as you are not close to him, the only attack you have to watch out for is his Gravelord Greatsword (listen for the scream and start running). Wearing the &lt;a href=\"Slumbering%20Dragoncrest%20Ring\"&gt;Slumbering Dragoncrest Ring&lt;/a&gt; will help in avoiding confrontation with the Giant Skeletons at the back of the cavern.\nHe can easily be strafed behind for free hits, resulting in large amounts of damage \u2013 especially if attacking him with &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;fire weapons&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;pyromancies&lt;/a&gt; (as he is weak to fire).\nBoss information.\nAttacks.\nSlam.\nNito slowly raises his weapon, then slams it into the ground. Difficult to block, but can be easily dodged. Also, Nito pauses for a few moments afterwards, leaving him open to attacks.\nThrust.\nNito thrusts forward with his sword. Can be blocked or dodged.\nSwing.\nNito swings his sword horizontally. Can be blocked or rolled under.\nGravelord Greatsword.\nOnly used by Nito when the player is either far away from him, or when they are out of sight range. After a scream, Nito plunges his sword into the ground, where it emerges from underneath the player, causing &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;toxic&lt;/a&gt; buildup along with decent damage. It has a similar effect to the &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Sword%20Dance\"&gt;Gravelord Sword Dance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;miracle&lt;/a&gt;.\nMiasma.\nAfter pausing to charge the attack, Nito will expel a wave of darkness in all directions, causing &lt;a href=\"Magic%20damage\"&gt;Magic damage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Toxic&lt;/a&gt; buildup.\nDeath Grip.\nNito's hand glows red, whilst also attempting to &lt;a href=\"grab\"&gt;grab&lt;/a&gt; the player.

Gravelord servants spread misery by using &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20Death\"&gt;Eyes of Death&lt;/a&gt; to spawn black phantoms in other worlds.\nRequirements.\nThere are some Eyes of Death close to where players can access the Gravelord Servant covenant.\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Basilisk\"&gt;Basilisk&lt;/a&gt;s found in the &lt;a href=\"Depths\"&gt;Depths&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Hollow\"&gt;The Great Hollow&lt;/a&gt; also drop them, rarely.\nBenefits.\nUpon joining, players receive:\n&lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Death\"&gt;Eyes of Death&lt;/a&gt; are offered to &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Nito\"&gt;Gravelord Nito&lt;/a&gt; to gain ranks in the Gravelord Servant Covenant.\nAbilities.\nBeing a Gravelord Servant allows players to curse other people's worlds. To do this, an Eye of Death is used. Doing so will cause numerous black phantom NPCs to spawn in up to three other people's worlds, provided the cursed player is in NG+ or higher. This is indicated by a black, fiery aura that is centered around the Gravelord Servant. The curse lasts until the Gravelord Servant either signs off or dies.\nTo invade a Gravelord Servant, infected players must find the Gravelord Servant's\u00a0invasion sign (which will move with the Gravelord Servant on a 10 second delay). Then they can invade as spirits of vengeance. The victor of the battle is awarded an Eye of Death. All three players may invade the Gravelord Servant at once. Using the Eye of Death will increase the odds of being invaded by other phantoms, including Dark Spirits belonging to either the Dark Wraith Covenant or the Forest Hunter Covenant, and Vengeful Spirits belonging to the Darkmoon Covenant. This is caused by the player's world to be in a state of constant high priority. The effect is similar to using a Dried Finger repeatedly for the duration. The maximum number of players invading the Gravelord Servant through their sign at a time is capped at three (four in Remastered when using a dried finger). A Gravelord Servant cannot see summon signs while under the effects of an Eye of Death nor can they use an Eye of Death if there are any phantoms or invaders present in their world.\nOverview.\nGravelord Servant is one of the tougher covenants to master. It is often difficult to get the right people to invade (sometimes agents of the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Darkmoon\"&gt;Blade of the Darkmoon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darkwraith%20%28covenant%29\"&gt;Darkwraith&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;s will invade anyway, and killing them does NOT yield &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Death\"&gt;Eyes of Death&lt;/a&gt;), and skilled players should have no problem defeating the Black Phantoms Gravelords sent to other worlds.\nGravelord servants also run the risk of being invaded by numerous people at once. It may be faster to simply farm Eyes of Death from &lt;a href=\"Basilisk\"&gt;Basilisk&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Depths\"&gt;Depths&lt;/a&gt; than to attempt to farm them by invading as was intended."}

There are four variants of this type of enemy, wielding different weaponry: a broken sword, a straight sword, a spear and shield, and a crossbow.\nStrategy.\nAs the first enemies encountered in the game, Gravetender Hollows are designed to introduce the player to the combat mechanics and are not a significant threat. However, they can perform a frenzy combo that deals high damage and they usually appear in small groups.

However, as it requires two slots, Great Chaos Fireball does less damage than most other pyromancies in terms of damage per slot, making it unsuitable for long journeys between distant bonfires.\nIn &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, Great Chaos Fireball is one of the more popular pyromancies (along with &lt;a href=\"Great%20Combustion\"&gt;Great Combustion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Tempest\"&gt;Fire Tempest&lt;/a&gt;), due its high damage, good area of effect, and lingering lava; however, manual aiming will likely be required to hit experienced players, as they will easily dodge it otherwise. This can be tricky at best; however, the high damage can be well worth it.

Some Great Crabs have a very extensive aggro range and may start chasing the player from very long distances. It's not uncommon to find their &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Crab\"&gt;offspring&lt;/a&gt; in areas where they are encountered.\nGreat Crabs fight by slamming either of their pincers continuously onto the ground or by shooting a stream of a viscous liquid from their mouths, reducing the player's mobility.\nAs expected from a creature of these characteristics, they have a dangerous grab where they will grasp the player with their bigger pincer and attack them furiously, dealing heavy damage. This attack is telegraphed by the sudden appearance of foamy bubbles drooling out from their mouths.\nThe first two crabs, encountered in the &lt;a href=\"Road%20of%20Sacrifices\"&gt;Road of Sacrifices&lt;/a&gt;' marshlands, have a particular ability not seen in their more advanced brethren: they can suddenly disengage from battle and burrow themselves into the ground, appearing moments later in a distant location with all their health restored back.\nLocations.\n&lt;a href=\"Road%20of%20Sacrifices\"&gt;Road of Sacrifices&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Farron%20Keep\"&gt;Farron Keep&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Smouldering%20Lake\"&gt;Smouldering Lake&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Painted World of Ariandel&lt;/a&gt; (\"&lt;a href=\"Ashes%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Ashes of Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;\")\nStrategy.\nMenacing looking and not without a reason, Great Crabs can prove to be formidable foes even in the late game. They have an insane aggro range and will most likely rush at the player from very far distances, however, the crabs in the Road of Sacrifices swamp do not usually follow the player if they retreat onto dry land.\nDefeating the one near the keep in the &lt;a href=\"Road%20of%20Sacrifices\"&gt;Road of Sacrifices&lt;/a&gt; will grant the player the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Swamp%20Ring\"&gt;Great Swamp Ring&lt;/a&gt;, which greatly enhances &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;pyromancies&lt;/a&gt;. This may not be an easy task in the early game, though, as there will be major difference between the damage the player can output, compared to the damage they deal when they are first encountered, which usually ends up with the crab burrowing into the ground in the middle of the fight, only to appear moments later in a distant area with its health completely restored. For this reason, it's recommended to come back to fight them once the player is stronger and has procured better weaponry. Ranged-attacking characters, like sorcerers and pyromancers, may have a better chance of defeating them the first time around, as Great Crabs can usually be lured into getting stuck among the trees, where the player may attack them at will.\nTheir attacks mainly consist in walking toward the player in a sideways manner whilst slamming one of their pincers repeatedly until they catch on. Moving in front of them will make them switch to the rest of their attacks.\nThey will frequently shoot a stream of viscous liquid. If hit, the player will have their mobility reduced for a short period of time. This attack is very easy to evade, however, and the creature will be open to attack afterward.\nIf they have sustained enough punishment and their poise is broken, they will stagger and be open for a &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;critical attack&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, their attacks can be &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parried&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey may also suddenly rise both of their pincers and erect their bodies altogether, followed by slamming themselves onto the ground with great force. This attack is amply telegraphed and is easily avoidable by &lt;a href=\"rolling\"&gt;rolling&lt;/a&gt; away, though the crab will be open for a critical attack while it is building up this move. Approach the monster at this moment and attack it, triggering the critical and dealing extreme damage to it.\nTheir grab may result in an instant death if not careful. This attack is telegraphed with the creature suddenly drooling foamy bubbles from its mouth while slowly building up with its larger pincer. The player should prioritize in rolling away as soon as they detect this move.\nIf the player befriended the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Archer%20of%20the%20Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;giant archer&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Undead Settlement&lt;/a&gt;, he will aid in killing the Great Crab in the &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Keep\"&gt;Farron Keep&lt;/a&gt;, which guards the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Dusk%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Crown of Dusk&lt;/a&gt; among other items.\nIf the player wants to fight those encountered in the &lt;a href=\"Smouldering%20Lake\"&gt;Smouldering Lake&lt;/a&gt;, it's recommended to make a detour through the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Ruins%20%28bonfire%29\"&gt;Demon Ruins&lt;/a&gt; first and turn off the ballista. A series of ledges can be found near it, which the player can drop onto to head back to the lake and near from where the Great Crabs are.\nDrops.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Road of Sacrifices =\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The fast cast animation also allows it to be useful without having to boost casting speed by equipping a &lt;a href=\"Sage%20Ring\"&gt;Sage Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs with Deep Soul, the slow homing nature of the spell makes it powerful for applying pressure against human opponents, who must pay attention to and focus on dodging the projectile for a longer period of time than they would have to against a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Soul Arrow&lt;/a&gt;-type spell.

As a result, it inflicts damage that increases roughly in tandem with its FP cost, meaning that it can still deal respectable damage without being as inefficient as the multiplier difference would suggest.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

Their size does little to hinder their speed as they can rapidly pin-point their target and perform quick strikes, such as a deadly spinning attack, which allows them to travel great distances very quickly. The slower attacks are more predictable.\nStrategy.\nStaying on the outskirts can allow the player to quickly retreat behind the trees, where the Felines will not venture.\nMoving along the cliff beyond Alvina's structure (when approaching from the sealed door requiring the &lt;a href=\"Crest%20of%20Artorias\"&gt;Crest of Artorias&lt;/a&gt;), will eventually take the player to a ledge overlooking the area containing the Great Felines. From here, it is possible to engage them with ranged attacks or magic. The felines will be unable to pursue the player when attacking from this location.\nAlternatively, if coming from the bridge, the player will be able to see the three felines at a distance before they turn hostile. The player can freely snipe the two that are further back and they won't react. The one on the front, however, will undoubtedly climb down to attack if harmed. Using &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Arrow\"&gt;poison arrows&lt;/a&gt; is recommended. It only takes about three to five arrows to poison them and then the player may add to the damage by using cheaper arrows.\nIt is safer to engage Great Felines one at a time. Venturing too close to where they are can trigger a three-versus-one encounter."}

Great Fireball is an upgrade of &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Orb\"&gt;Fire Orb&lt;/a&gt; and an advanced ranged pyromancy. It deals more damage and noticeably larger area of effect. Great Fireball has a fire attack power of 3.0 times the Pyromancy Flame's magic adjust.\nOverview.\nSince it is the strongest ranged pyromancy bar &lt;a href=\"Great%20Chaos%20Fireball\"&gt;Great Chaos Fireball&lt;/a&gt; and requires less attunement, Great Fireball is a very popular pyromancy for use in &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;. It is somewhat less common in PvE, where the limited amount of casts per slot limits its utility for long journeys. Great Fireball also boasts impressive poise damage unlike the lesser Fireballs, being able to stun opponents with up to and including 80 poise, allowing it to easily stagger most players in a single hit.\nAs with its lesser cousins, Great Fireball is hindered by its long windup time, arced trajectory, and slow projectile speed, so it is important to plan ahead when using this pyromancy."}

In the cutscene, Sif will recognize the player as they approach and let out a whimper. The protagonist reaches out to pet the wolf, but Sif pulls away and howls mournfully before sadly picking up Artorias' greatsword. The fight will continue as normal after this point. \nBoss information.\nAttacks.\nDashing Slice.\nLike all of Sif's attacks, this can be blocked. If Sif switches the sword to the right side the attack will be followed by a Sword Slam.\nSpinning Slice.\nSif repositions the sword to a straight position, and spins around twice. Causes massive stamina damage if blocked and can kill players if the slices connect. However, if Sif is at low enough health to where it is limping, Sif will only spin the sword once. Can be dodged by backing or rolling away before the attack is unleashed. Sif will pause afterwards, creating an opportunity for attack.\nSword Slam.\nSif slams the sword into the ground. Powerful, but has no tracking and poor hitbox. This attack is only used as a follow-up to Dashing Slice and Finishing Combo.\nEvasive Slice.\nSif will attempt to slice the player while jumping backwards and away from the player in one motion. Has little to no starting lag. Blocking it won't give the player an opportunity to attack, but will help the player survive.\nSingle Slice.\nSif will do a quick chop from side to side. Good tracking and high hitbox. Possible to roll underneath it with good timing. Also does not do much damage to the stamina bar, thus it can be blocked quite easily.\nDouble Slice.\nTwo slashes from side to side. Great tracking, thus very difficult to sidestep. However, the slices can be rolled under and blocked fairly comfortably without the stamina bar being fully drained. If Sif is at the point of limping, the wolf will fall on its side and struggle to get up on attempting the second slice, so use this to your advantage to do some damage.\nFinishing Combo.\nSif will slice twice and then finish with a Sword Slam. The last attack has poor tracking and a small hitbox, so use this as an opportunity to get some hits in.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls \u2014 Great Grey Wolf Sif by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiTZspxsOZk&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

Their extreme &lt;a href=\"weight\"&gt;weight&lt;/a&gt; and immense &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; consumption also means that heavy &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vitality%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt; investment is mandatory, and like other ultra weapons they &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;scale&lt;/a&gt; primarily with &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;.\nWithin the great hammers weapon class, there also exists a sub-class of three Ultra Great Hammers, which possess increased Poise health, making them extremely difficult to interrupt once they are in motion. These weapons, &lt;a href=\"Smough%27s%20Great%20Hammer\"&gt;Smough's Great Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morne%27s%20Great%20Hammer\"&gt;Morne's Great Hammer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ledo%27s%20Great%20Hammer\"&gt;Ledo's Great Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, are immensely heavy and require copious amounts of Strength to wield, but when used properly can dominate an area around them, becoming monsters on the battlefield.\nLike their &lt;a href=\"Hammers%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;smaller cousins&lt;/a&gt;, the primary &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; used by great hammers is &lt;a href=\"Perseverance%20%28skill%29\"&gt;Perseverance&lt;/a&gt;, providing instant Hyper Armor to give the wielder increased survivability.\nGreat Hammers.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

{"id": "3630", "revid": "51254358", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3630", "title": "Chaos Storm", "text": "Chaos Storm (\u6df7\u6c8c\u306e\u5d50) is a &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Pyromancy&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\".\nGeneral Information.\nChaos Storm requires two attunement slots to use. It is very similar to &lt;a href=\"Firestorm\"&gt;Firestorm&lt;/a&gt;, having twenty \"casts\" (using 17 per full cast, but can vary from 3 to 17 on occasion), dealing slightly stronger initial damage and then leaving pools of lava. The pillars have a fire attack power of 3.6 times the Pyromancy Flame's magic adjust and the lava pools have a fire attack power of 2.0 times the Pyromancy Flame's magic adjust. In terms of initial damage, &lt;a href=\"Firestorm\"&gt;Firestorm&lt;/a&gt; deals the lowest initial damage, then Chaos Storm, followed by &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Tempest\"&gt;Fire Tempest&lt;/a&gt;. However, if the enemy lingers to take the lava damage, the total damage can outdo Fire Tempest, thus giving this pyromancy the highest damage potential Storm spell. This makes it an extremely viable spell for large, slow moving enemies. \nOverview.\nChaos Storm is useful as firestorm when it comes to knockback, dealing damage, and granting players breathing space. In addition, it is also useful for temporary area denial by creating lava around the caster. Like Firestorm it can prove useful against large enemies and bosses such as &lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;Seath the Scaleless&lt;/a&gt; as more than one pillar can hit the enemy.\nDescription.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Official translation=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The pots near a nearby &lt;a href=\"Mimic\"&gt;Mimic&lt;/a&gt; can be broken to release water and temporarily give the player increased fire resistance; &lt;a href=\"Flash%20Sweat%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Flash Sweat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Small%20Orange%20Burr\"&gt;Small Orange Burr&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Great%20Magic%20Barrier%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Great Magic Barrier&lt;/a&gt;, and appropriate armor can help too.\nAnother reliable way of accessing the same resistance buff provided by water is to use a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Pharros%27%20Lockstone\"&gt;Pharros' Lockstone&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0on one of the contraptions in the area to get a huge fire resistance boost.\nAlso consider chugging an &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt; before opening the chest, as the animation is lengthy.\nVideo.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D8dqfv5c6k6M%26amp%3Blist%3DUU0O7NmsbB_FiasJGO8Quktw\"&gt;Video: location and how to get&lt;/a&gt;\nGeneral information.\nSimilarly to its cousin from \"Dark Souls\", Chaos Storm is essentially a more powerful version of &lt;a href=\"Firestorm%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Firestorm&lt;/a&gt;, creating numerous pillars of fire around the caster. Casting Chaos Storm also leaves behind many short-lived pools of lava, which damage any enemy that steps in them.\nConsidering the higher amount of casts and it requires only one slot to attune, this spell is often more efficient than its more powerful sibling, &lt;a href=\"Outcry\"&gt;Outcry&lt;/a&gt;, as you are ultimately getting more damage for your slot as well as having room for another spell. Furthermore, as this shares the same start up animation as &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Snake\"&gt;Fire Snake&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"PvP%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; one could constantly switch between these two spells to catch a player off guard.\nAttunement milestones.\nLike all other spells, the amount of casts per slot increases upon reaching certain &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Attunement&lt;/a&gt; milestones:"}

Due to exposure to the flame, Quelaag and &lt;a href=\"Quelaag%27s%20Sister\"&gt;her sister&lt;/a&gt; mutated into spider-like creatures with their upper body being fused to the monsters' backs.\nLore.\nShe is the &lt;a href=\"Quelaag%27s%20Sister\"&gt;Fair Lady&lt;/a&gt;'s older sister. When their mother, the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Witch of Izalith&lt;/a&gt; along with their other two sisters became the &lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, she and her sister became half demon spiders.\nQuelaag and her sister stationed just outside the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Ruins\"&gt;Demon Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, in a fraction of &lt;a href=\"Blighttown\"&gt;Blighttown&lt;/a&gt; that became known as Queelag's Domain. The two started to breed demon insects to enlarge the demon army, by offering Humanities to the Fair Lady. People in Blighttown venerated the two witches, and gladly accepted to become hosts of the Fair Lady's eggs.\nBut the pregnancies weakened and blinded Queelag's sister, and Quelaag became her guardian and primary hunter.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt; entered Queelag's Domain, the Chaos Witch looked at them with a gleeful smile, thinking of how many Humanities she could steal from them.\nStrategy.\nA relatively easy way to beat this boss is to be human and summon &lt;a href=\"Maneater%20Mildred\"&gt;Maneater Mildred&lt;/a&gt;, whose summon sign is right outside the &lt;a href=\"Fog%20Door\"&gt;Fog Door&lt;/a&gt;. Let Mildred distract Quelaag and stay away from her lava attack, as this is certain &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. When away from her, pick off her health with ranged attacks, while Mildred tanks. This way Quelaag should be dead within a short period of time.\nAnother easy way to kill her is to get any &lt;a href=\"Halberds\"&gt;halberd&lt;/a&gt; with a vertical light attack, such as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Scythe\"&gt;Great Scythe&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%27s%20Halberd\"&gt;Gargoyle's Halberd&lt;/a&gt;, and then repeatedly hitting Quelaag's human part. When aimed properly, she will stagger every time the attack connects, interupting whatever she's doing. This can be repeated to prevent her from attacking at all.\nThere is a spot between the stairs on the far side of the arena and the wall where Quelaag is unable to reach the player, at which point she can safely be killed from a distance using ranged attacks. \nLocation.\nFound in &lt;a href=\"Quelaag%27s%20Domain\"&gt;Quelaag's Domain&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in between &lt;a href=\"Blighttown\"&gt;Blighttown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Ruins\"&gt;Demon Ruins&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoss information.\nAttacks.\nTriple Fury Slash.\nQuelaag will charge up briefly and swing her &lt;a href=\"Quelaag%27s%20Furysword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; from bottom-left to top-right (from her perspective). Roll to the left (player's perspective) to dodge this attack easily.\nChaos Stab.\nQuelaag will charge up for a longer time and stab with the sword, holding it out for a short duration. This attack homes in much more reliably than the slash and deals multiple hits.\nLava Surge.\nQuelaag can create lava pools in three ways:\nLeg Stomp.\nQuelaag will lift four of her legs and slam them back down. This attack can be performed from the left or right side, or directly in front of her. It has a very long startup and is easily dodged.\nFire Burst.\nQuelaag hugs her spider body and, after a roar, performs a deadly explosion. Quelaag will use this attack if the player gets very close to her body, such as beneath her legs.\nLava Spew.\nQuelaag will emit fire jets from her spider body.\nRemoved content.\nQuelaag had &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D1VUzHRBc2bQ\"&gt;dialogue&lt;/a&gt; removed from the final game:\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls \u2014 Chaos Witch Quelaag by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeLdilzCmho&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

While they grant more damage than their respective resins and many more bundles can be carried at once, the trade-off is that the duration of the buff is reduced to less than 20% of that of a resin.\nThe quick application time, high stock and low duration of these items makes them very flexible tools, useful for applying in the midst of combat based on the situation. Whereas a resin may find a large fraction of its duration wasted from inactivity between attacks, a bundle may be quickly activated when an opportunity to deal damage presents itself, and the advantage pressed until the buff expires.

After the &lt;a href=\"Burnt%20Ivory%20King\"&gt;Ivory King&lt;/a&gt; discovered the &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Chaos\"&gt;raging flames of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; beneath his lands, he ordered the construction of the Garrison Ward to confine it. The Eleum Knights were posted throughout the garrison to lead the advance on the swollen flame on the king's orders.\nA group of knights, led by &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Fabian\"&gt;Sir Fabian&lt;/a&gt;, delved valiantly into the depths of Chaos to exterminate the terrible creatures that dwelled there, but they failed. The knights were corrupted by the Chaos and lost their sense of self. Charred black by flames, they burned in eternal agony, alongside their once-proud king. \nStrategy.\nCharred Loyce Knights can carry one of four weapons: sword, halberd, hammer and pyromancy flame. The weapon-wielding Charred Loyce Knights will usually try to close the distance to attack with their weapons, while the pyromancy wielders will keep their distance and cast spells, sometimes using close-range spells if the player gets too close to them.\nThe weapon-wielders will usually chain their attacks in combos of 2 or 3 hits when possible, and if the player is too far they will close the distance and attempt running attacks. Individually these Charred Loyce Knights are not very strong; however, the danger lies in having to dispatch three (or more) of them at once, as they may corner and mob the player with chained combos.\nPyromancy-wielding Charred Loyce Knights have four spells at their disposal: &lt;a href=\"Fireball%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Snake\"&gt;Fire Snake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Combustion%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Combustion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Whip%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Fire Whip&lt;/a&gt;. They will usually use the first two spells at range, which can be dodged via rolling or continuous movement (for Fire Snake, make sure to watch which direction it is going and roll the other way), and the last two when the player is close to them; occasionally they may even attempt a melee punch at the player with their fist, dealing small damage. All of the pyromancer knight's spells have a fairly long wind-up, allowing them to be easily predicted and dodged.\nA two-handed basic attack using a weapon with a 35 &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;-breaking rating is guaranteed to stagger a Charred Loyce Knight, so long as they have not been buffed due to the presence of a summon (if fighting the &lt;a href=\"Burnt%20Ivory%20King\"&gt;Burnt Ivory King&lt;/a&gt;); long weapons such as spears and halberds can help in keeping them from getting too close. If a knight is interrupted during their running attack, they may backstep if they are hit less than three times in succession, though they may chain this into a running counter-attack or even a jumping attack.\nThe Charred Loyce Knights will occasionally use their shields to block attacks, especially the pyromancer knight. However, they have relatively little stability and a few attacks will usually result in a &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Break\"&gt;guard break&lt;/a&gt;. While the knights cannot be backstabbed, they can be frontal-&lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;riposted&lt;/a&gt; during the guard break, which allows them to be quickly and easily dispatched.\nThe greatest danger that Charred Loyce Knights pose is that failure to dispatch one wave may give the next one enough time to spawn, forcing the player to deal with up to six knights simultaneously. Therefore, speed is key, as waves will spawn roughly once every two minutes. When dealing with the knights, try to focus on one at a time and kill them as quickly as possible; killing one early on makes the remaining two much easier to deal with.\nUse of elemental damage, particularly &lt;a href=\"Infusion\"&gt;infused&lt;/a&gt; or buffed weapons, can help to inflict more damage on Charred Loyce Knights. They are weak to all damage types except &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;, and are particularly susceptible to &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage."}

Combined with the low cast speed is lackluster damage in both Dark and Lightning, resulting in average damage in both Hexes and Miracles. However, what makes the Chime of Screams a valuable chime is its ability to raise faith, inverse to the amount of faith the player has; Meaning players with more faith will receive less faith than someone with lower faith, at a maximum increase of +6. The best practical use is for players with low FTH to keep this in the hand opposite of their main casting tool, to raise their FTH to use spells with higher requirements, ignoring its casting abilities."}

This would eventually come to be the Chosen Undead's canon appearance.\nHowever, in the game, the Chosen Undead's appearance and attributes are determined by the player, including their face, sex, origin, starting &lt;a href=\"Classes%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;, and equipment.\nThey are portrayed as an archetypal \"silent character\" who doesn't have any sort of spoken dialogue during the game (aside from making some grunts or cries whenever they are hurt or killed). This trait was made on purpose by the &lt;a href=\"From%20Software\"&gt;developers&lt;/a&gt; so that the player could feel more identified with the character.\nLore.\nThe title of \"Chosen Undead\" is a reference to a prophecy concerning the end of the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Age of Fire&lt;/a&gt;. It states that at the very end of the Age of Fire, an undead champion will appear and undertake the pilgrimage to ring the &lt;a href=\"Bells%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Bells of Awakening&lt;/a&gt; in \"the\u00a0Land of\u00a0Ancient Lords,\" &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Chosen Undead is a human, and thus, a descendant of the &lt;a href=\"Furtive%20Pygmy\"&gt;Furtive Pygmy&lt;/a&gt;, one of the original Lords who claimed the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Soul\"&gt;Dark Soul&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlot.\nPrologue.\nAfter becoming an undead the player character was imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Undead%20Asylum\"&gt;Northern Undead Asylum&lt;/a&gt;. They are rescued by &lt;a href=\"Oscar%2C%20Knight%20of%20Astora\"&gt;Oscar of Astora&lt;/a&gt;, who drops a key into the player's cell so that they may be freed. After escaping from the &lt;a href=\"Asylum%20Demon\"&gt;Asylum Demon&lt;/a&gt;, they encounter a fatally wounded Oscar, who tells the player about a prophecy, stating\u00a0that an undead shall partake in pilgrimage to ring the Bells of Awakening.\nOscar gives the player an\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt; and dies in peace, trusting the Chosen Undead to take his place.\u00a0After defeating the Asylum Demon,\u00a0the Chosen Undead\u00a0escapes the asylum and is\u00a0flown to Lordran\u00a0by a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Giant%20Crow\"&gt;Giant Crow&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Bells of Awakening.\nUpon arriving in Lordran, the Giant Crow drops the Chosen Undead in &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt;, which acts as a hub for the player for the rest of the story. After hearing the location of the Bells of Awakening from the &lt;a href=\"Crestfallen%20Warrior\"&gt;Crestfallen Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, the Chosen Undead sets out on their journey. Various characters can be encountered throughout Lordran, such as &lt;a href=\"Solaire%20of%20Astora\"&gt;Solaire of Astora&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0a charismatic warrior seeking \"his own sun\"; the treacherous knight &lt;a href=\"Lautrec%20of%20Carim\"&gt;Lautrec of Carim&lt;/a&gt;;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Siegmeyer%20of%20Catarina\"&gt;Siegmeyer of Catarina&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0an absent-minded knight who frequently finds himself in danger.\nOn a rooftop in the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Undead%20Parish\"&gt;Undead Parish&lt;/a&gt;, the player slays the &lt;a href=\"Bell%20Gargoyles\"&gt;Bell Gargoyles&lt;/a&gt; and manages to ring one of the bells. Later on, the player makes their way deep into the infested swamps of &lt;a href=\"Blighttown\"&gt;Blighttown&lt;/a&gt;. There, the player defeats the &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Witch%20Quelaag\"&gt;Chaos Witch Quelaag&lt;/a&gt; and rings the other bell. After ringing both bells, the gate to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Sen%27s%20Fortress\"&gt;Sen's Fortress&lt;/a&gt; is opened.\nThe Lordvessel.\nAfter passing the trials to ring the two bells, &lt;a href=\"Kingseeker%20Frampt\"&gt;Kingseeker Frampt&lt;/a&gt;, a primordial serpent, appears to task the character with another quest before they are deemed worthy as Chosen. The player must go into the city of &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; and retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Lordvessel\"&gt;Lordvessel&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Gwynevere\"&gt;Gwynevere&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord Gwyn's&lt;/a&gt; daughter. In order to complete the quest the player needs to traverse Sen's Fortress, an old proving ground built by the gods. After passing through the fortress and its many dangerous traps, the player battles the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt;, and with its defeat gains the entrance into the forsaken city.\nOnce in Anor Londo, the player makes their way into the Anor Londo cathedral, where they face &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Ornstein\"&gt;Dragonslayer Ornstein&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Knights%20of%20Gwyn\"&gt;Four Knights of Gwyn&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Executioner%20Smough\"&gt;Executioner Smough&lt;/a&gt;. The Chosen Undead triumphs over them and gains access into the chamber of Gwynevere, where they are greeted by the Princess and awarded the Lordvessel. When Frampt sees that the player had completed their quest, he declares the prophecy set in motion and that the character is indeed the incarnation of the Chosen Undead.\nAlternate paths.\nThe player is given the choice to put the Lordvessel on the Firelink Altar and proceed along Frampt's designs. In this instance, Frampt prompts that the Chosen Undead is the hero destined to succeed Lord Gwyn and extend the Age of Fire, continuing the curse of the undead. The player is also given the choice to place the Lordvessel for another ancient serpent named &lt;a href=\"Darkstalker%20Kaathe\"&gt;Darkstalker Kaathe&lt;/a&gt;, an agent of the &lt;a href=\"Darkwraith%20%28covenant%29\"&gt;Darkwraiths&lt;/a&gt;. Following this path will bring about the eradication of the old gods, and usher in the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Dark\"&gt;Age of Dark&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Lord Souls.\nTo gain access to Gwyn, Lord of Cinder, the Chosen Undead must satiate the Lordvessel. There are several beings who possess souls powerful enough to do so: Gravelord Nito, the Witch of Izalith, Seath the Scaleless and the Four Kings of New Londo.\nIn order to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Kings\"&gt;Four Kings&lt;/a&gt;, the Chosen Undead needs to acquire the &lt;a href=\"Covenant%20of%20Artorias\"&gt;Covenant of Artorias&lt;/a&gt;, a ring that is kept by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Grey%20Wolf%20Sif\"&gt;Great Grey Wolf Sif&lt;/a&gt;. The ring allows one to traverse the dark void called &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;the Abyss&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arriving in\u00a0the ruins of &lt;a href=\"New%20Londo%20Ruins\"&gt;New Londo&lt;/a&gt;, the Chosen Undead, with the help of &lt;a href=\"Ingward\"&gt;Ingward&lt;/a&gt;, drains the flooded city, earning passage to the Darkwraiths and their masters. If the player has not yet placed the Lordvessel before defeating the Four Kings, Darkstalker Kaathe will appear in the abyss.\nIn &lt;a href=\"The%20Duke%27s%20Archives\"&gt;The Duke's Archives&lt;/a&gt; the Chosen Undead confronts &lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;Seath the Scaleless&lt;/a&gt;, an albino dragon who betrayed the Ancient Dragons and won Lord Gwyn\u00b4s trust. During their first encounter, the Chosen Undead is unable to cause any harm\u00a0to Seath and is captured. Seath imprisons the\u00a0Chosen Undead\u00a0inside his prison tower where the player cannot warp out from. Despite the inconveniences, the Chosen Undead eventually escapes.\nLater on, the Chosen Undead learns from &lt;a href=\"Big%20Hat%20Logan\"&gt;Big Hat Logan&lt;/a&gt; that Seath is immortal due to an ancient artifact known as the Primordial Crystal, an old relic that Seath stole from the Ancient Dragons. The Chosen Undead then departs to the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Cave\"&gt;Crystal Cave&lt;/a&gt;, where the artifact lies, and shatters it. This annuls Seath's immortality, allowing the Chosen Undead to slay him.\nThe Chosen Undead also travels to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Catacombs\"&gt;Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;, where they defeat &lt;a href=\"Pinwheel\"&gt;Pinwheel&lt;/a&gt; and acquire the &lt;a href=\"Rite%20of%20Kindling\"&gt;Rite of Kindling&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0The Chosen Undead then descends into the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Tomb of the Giants&lt;/a&gt;, where the scavenger, &lt;a href=\"Patches\"&gt;Trusty Patches&lt;/a&gt; tricks the player and kicks them off a cliff. The Chosen Undead survives and rescues &lt;a href=\"Reah%20of%20Thorolund\"&gt;Reah of Thorolund&lt;/a&gt;, a maiden who ventured into Nito's domain in search of the Rite of Kindling. Finally, the Chosen Undead advances toward the deepest part of the area: &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Nito\"&gt;Gravelord Nito&lt;/a&gt;'s tomb. There, they finish off the conductor of death.\nLastly, the Chosen Undead advances into the deepest part of Lordran: &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Izalith\"&gt;Lost Izalith&lt;/a&gt;. If the player speaks to &lt;a href=\"Quelana%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Quelana&lt;/a&gt; in Blighttown it will be discovered that her &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; tried to use her power to replicate the First Flame, but failed and was engulfed within it; eventually succeeding but at the cost of their former forms. This killed some of her daughters in the process and turned others into deformed creatures, and only Quelana and a &lt;a href=\"Daughter%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Daughter of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; maintained the entirety of their human forms. Within the city, the Chosen Undead comes upon the &lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, the source of all the demons that wander Lordran, and overcomes it.\nEpilogue.\nAfter offering the necessary Lord Souls, the doors to the &lt;a href=\"Kiln%20of%20the%20First%20Flame\"&gt;Kiln of the First Flame&lt;/a&gt; are opened to the Chosen Undead. Gwyn, now reduced to a Lord of Cinder, breathes his last breath in the final confrontation with the Chosen Undead. It is here that the Chosen Undead may make their decision of either linking the flame or walking away from it. Depending on which course of action is taken, one of the two possible &lt;a href=\"Endings%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;endings&lt;/a&gt; will be unlocked. Whether the player has aligned themselves with Kaathe or Frampt will not affect the ending of the game.\nArtorias of the Abyss.\nIn the\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Artorias%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Artorias of the Abyss&lt;/a&gt;\" DLC the Chosen Undead travels back in time to the ancient realm of &lt;a href=\"Oolacile\"&gt;Oolacile&lt;/a&gt;, where they discover the truth about the death of the &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Artorias\"&gt;Knight Artorias&lt;/a&gt; and the fall of Oolacile. The quest presented in this DLC is completely optional and therefore, it is not required to complete the game.\nAfter being dragged back in time, the Chosen Undead wakes up inside a &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20Garden\"&gt;cave beneath some trees&lt;/a&gt;. Outside, they are confronted by the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20Guardian\"&gt;Sanctuary Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. After slaying the beast, the Chosen Undead finds some sort of garden temple where they encounter a giant, talking mushroom named &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth\"&gt;Elizabeth&lt;/a&gt;, who informs the player that the realm of Oolacile is being consumed by the darkness of the Abyss, She also tells the player that &lt;a href=\"Dusk%20of%20Oolacile\"&gt;Princess Dusk&lt;/a&gt; has been kidnapped by &lt;a href=\"Manus%2C%20Father%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;a creature from the abyss&lt;/a&gt; and that Knight Artorias has ventured unto Oolacile to put an end to the spread. However, she assures the player that Artorias will be overwhelmed by the darkness.\nThe Chosen Undead then heads towards &lt;a href=\"Oolacile%20Township\"&gt;Oolacile Township&lt;/a&gt; in search of Artorias and Dusk. On their way to Oolacile, the player encounters &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragon%20Kalameet\"&gt;Black Dragon Kalameet&lt;/a&gt;, an optional boss that can be fought later in the DLC. Elizabeth's words are proven to be true when, upon entering the Coliseum, the player is attacked by a corrupted Artorias. The Chosen Undead has no other option than finishing him off as he is unable to come back to his senses. After killing Artorias, the Chosen Undead can either give his soul to &lt;a href=\"Lord%27s%20Blade%20Ciaran\"&gt;Lord's Blade Ciaran&lt;/a&gt; so that she can complete a proper burial or keep it for their own uses.\nDuring their quest in Oolacile the Chosen Undead also meets &lt;a href=\"Marvelous%20Chester\"&gt;Marvelous Chester&lt;/a&gt;, a somewhat sinister merchant who, like the player, was dragged into the past. He reveals to the Chosen Undead that the spread of the dark was caused when the inhabitants of Oolacile opened the grave of the primeval man due to the influence of a \"toothy serpent\". The Chosen Undead then treads through Oolacile Township in search of the dark source.\nFinally, the Chosen Undead arrives at the &lt;a href=\"Chasm%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Chasm of the Abyss&lt;/a&gt; where an illusion of &lt;a href=\"Alvina\"&gt;Alvina&lt;/a&gt; guides the player to an illusory wall. Inside, the Chosen Undead discovers an injured Sif, protected by a magic barrier created by Artorias, in order to prevent Sif from being engulfed. Shortly after rescuing Sif the player faces Manus, Father of the Abyss, who is responsible for the spread of the dark. Manus is defeated, and Princess Dusk is saved. Upon returning to Oolacile Sanctuary, they are greeted by Elizabeth, who tells the Chosen Undead that she will let everyone know that Artorias was the one who defeated Manus, so that his honor may prevail. However, she assures them that their great deed will not be forgotten."}

Clawed Curses will emerge suddenly from some of the many tomes stored within the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt;, their presence hinted by the sound of unintelligible murmurs.\nMuch like the &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"New%20Londo\"&gt;New Londo&lt;/a&gt;, they are cursed entities that cannot be interacted with.

The deeper one proceeds, the larger and more common the groups will become.\nStrategy.\nThe player should be cautious when walking near bookcases and always pay attention to the murmuring sounds they produce, as that will warn of an upcoming encounter.\nThe player should also make sure to have their head covered in wax at all times while exploring the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;archives&lt;/a&gt;, especially when traveling near bookcases. The wax will go away after a certain period of time has elapsed, though, and one must be careful so that it does not wear off while near the curses.\nThe layer of wax covering oneself will not be restored by dipping the head again in a wax filled vat before this period expires, though. One must wait for the previous effect to wear off before being able to apply a new layer.\nIt is also advisable to be acquainted with the level's layout and to open all shortcuts, thus giving easier access to all vats."}

It has relatively low &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;dexterity&lt;/a&gt; requirements, making it a viable option for infusions, while the C/C scaling makes it a powerful weapon for dedicated quality builds. These traits lets it fill a similar role to the &lt;a href=\"Bastard%20Sword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Bastard Sword&lt;/a&gt; which performs similarly, but sacrifices the thrusting attack and some damage for lower weight and slightly lower requirements.\nThe main drawback of the Claymore is that many greatswords found later in the game outclass it in terms of damage. With that said, the Claymore remains a dependable weapon throughout the game, and its relatively low requirements makes it an attractive choice if one does not want to invest stats into using the more powerful elemental greatswords."}

It's balanced scaling between Strength and Dexterity makes it a great candidate for Refined infusion, and it can be buffed with spells and items. This, coupled with its adaptable moveset and early accessibility, makes the Claymore a promising weapon for any melee build.\nThe Claymore is also one of the longest &lt;a href=\"Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Greatswords&lt;/a&gt; in the game, giving it a better reach than most swords of its class. This allows certain character builds to perform multiple attacks and roll away with near-impunity, particularly during boss fights. Its Weapon Arts is particularly effective against enemies with weapons no longer than a Spear as it makes full use of the sword's length. As with its previous incarnations, the Claymore remains exceptional at stun-locking enemies with low poise.\nUpgrades.\nReinforced with ."}

Upon doing so, Sif will leave behind the Cleansing Greatshield.\nCharacteristics.\nThe Cleansing Greatshield has the weakest &lt;a href=\"physical%20defense\"&gt;physical defense&lt;/a&gt; of any of the greatshields available. However, its defenses against &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Defense\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and the other elements are all very good, even for a greatshield. This means that its effectiveness will vary considerably depending on the type of damage a particular &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; will deal. It has a heavy deflection and a standard bash attack. A major downside to this shield's use is that upgrading will not raise its &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt; value, only the damage will be increased.\nAll things considered however, this is a vastly inferior version to its pristine self, the &lt;a href=\"Greatshield%20of%20Artorias\"&gt;Greatshield of Artorias&lt;/a&gt;, as the latter, though not possessing the same high values as the Cleansing Greatshield, boasts extremely high stability, better Resistance Defenses (as it will block 100% &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt;), and negates physical damage entirely, though it does require slightly more &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and has slightly higher &lt;a href=\"weight\"&gt;weight&lt;/a&gt;.\nResistance Defense.\nAlong with Physical and &lt;a href=\"Elemental\"&gt;Elemental&lt;/a&gt; damage reduction, weapons also have hidden stats that reduce the amount of status &lt;a href=\"build-up\"&gt;build-up&lt;/a&gt; while blocking."}

However, unlike most weapons that inflict Magic damage scaling with Intelligence, the Cleric's Candlestick continues to benefit from Intelligence past 40, and can get meaningful returns on damage up to 60 Intelligence.\nThe weapon's greatest weakness is that it requires a non-negligible amount of &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt; investment in order to meet its wielding requirement; not meeting this requirement will drastically reduce its Spell Buff and render any spells cast by the weapon impotent.\nDescription.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Official translation=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

It is also a decent base for a more paladin-style build that wants to use heavy weapons but that also wants some extra healing in the beginning. \nTheir &lt;a href=\"Mace%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Mace&lt;/a&gt; is actually a pretty strong weapon as its Strike damage is highly valuable and as a &lt;a href=\"Hammers%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Hammer&lt;/a&gt; it has an above average Counter Strength of 120, meaning it deals extra damage on &lt;a href=\"Counter%20Attack\"&gt;Counter Attack&lt;/a&gt;s. However, it does have one slight disadvantage in that it has a Strength requirement of 12 while the Cleric only starts with 11 Strength and thus needs 1 more point in the stat to deal the weapon one-handed instead of only two-handed. The &lt;a href=\"Cleric%27s%20Sacred%20Chime\"&gt;Cleric's Sacred Chime&lt;/a&gt; is decent for the offensive, &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt;-based Miracles but is mediocre for chime-based Hexes due to its lower &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt;-scaling. However, it does have good casting speed so it is a good alternative for support Miracles since it can be left unupgraded so that all the character's titanite can be used on their other equipment. \nWhile this class may seem to have below average defences with only decent &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;, since all of those stats come from one piece of equipment, the &lt;a href=\"Archdrake%20Robes\"&gt;Archdrake Robes&lt;/a&gt;, those defences can be improved greatly by adding more armor, even if that is just putting back on some pieces from the &lt;a href=\"Imported%20Set\"&gt;Imported Set&lt;/a&gt; from before the character creation. If up to buying armor pieces, the &lt;a href=\"Falconer%20Set\"&gt;Falconer Set&lt;/a&gt; head, hands, and legs pieces provide a good mix of defences and Poise at a relatively low price of roughly 1,000 souls per piece. Be wary that that this will shorten the character's roll distance unless &lt;a href=\"Vitality%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt; is increased, with all the extra Imported Set pieces (head, hands, and legs) increasing defence by about 45% but giving no extra poise and shortening rolls by 10%, wearing the Falconer Helm and Boots increases defence by 85% and poise by 100% at the cost of 2,100 souls and shortening rolls by 10%, and wearing the Falconer Helm, Gloves, and Boots increases defence by 110% and poise by 130% at the cost of 3,150 souls and shortening rolls by 25%. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Heal%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt; Miracle equipped by default is quite strong early on. While it isn't as strong as the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Soul Arrow&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; it can heavily supplement the very few starting charges of the &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt;, even more so if a second copy is bought of off &lt;a href=\"Merchant%20Hag%20Melentia\"&gt;Merchant Hag Melentia&lt;/a&gt;. \nDespite its decent Attunement, its low &lt;a href=\"Adaptability\"&gt;Adaptability&lt;/a&gt; means it has the worst roll i-frame category at 5, though this can be improved to 8 i-frames with only 2 points in the former stat or 1 point in the latter stat. \nStarting Equipment.\nAs with all starting classes in Dark Souls 2, the &lt;a href=\"Imported%20Set\"&gt;Imported Set&lt;/a&gt; worn before the character creation can be found unequipped in the character's inventory.

This means the class will have to focus primarily on weapons initially, and will do well to keep them upgraded as offensive Miracles consume a lot of &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;Focus Points&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Cleric%27s%20Sacred%20Chime%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Cleric's Sacred Chime&lt;/a&gt; is a fairly good casting tool and is actually the strongest casting tool for Miracles from 45 to 49 Faith. Its Spell Buff (the stat that affects how strong scaling spells are) doesn't actually increase until at least 19 Faith has been reached. Its &lt;a href=\"Skill\"&gt;Weapon Art&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Gentle%20Prayer\"&gt;Gentle Prayer&lt;/a&gt;, a regenerative effect that always restores 360 hp over the course of a minute as long as the Chime is held in an active hand (so replacing it with another item stops it, as does two-handing the item in the other hand). This effect will actually outheal the Heal Miracle by up to 20% until the Chime's Spell Buff reaches 120, and even afterwards it is a strong if slow alternative due to only having about a third the cost in Focus Points. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Mace%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Mace&lt;/a&gt; is an unexpectedly strong weapon for what may at first seem like a spellcasting class, but in reality it is often a Cleric's main armament. This is because Strike damage is often the strongest physical damage type as armored and skeletal enemies are weak to it (most other types have fewer enemies weak to them), strong Strength-scaling for easy damage increases, a fairly good moveset, and has a good Weapon Art for trading hits with opponents. How the Weapon Art works is that &lt;a href=\"Perseverance%20%28skill%29\"&gt;Perseverance&lt;/a&gt; adds a flat 45% extra absorption and causes the attacks of light weapons to bounce off the user, while also granting great &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt; to prevent being staggered. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Wooden%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Blue Wooden Shield&lt;/a&gt; is not very good, having only decent physical and magic defence with serviceable &lt;a href=\"Stability\"&gt;Stability&lt;/a&gt;. While it does have &lt;a href=\"Parry%20%28skill%29\"&gt;Parry&lt;/a&gt; (albeit the inferior Medium Shield version), a strong &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Skill\"&gt;Weapon Skill&lt;/a&gt; shield like the early &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Eagle%20Kite%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Silver Eagle Kite Shield&lt;/a&gt; would probably serve as a better replacement. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Cleric Set&lt;/a&gt; is a light, caster-type armor set and as such has low physical defences and high elemental defences, while also having high &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt; resistances. \nThe first trainer for more Miracles is found in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Undead Settlement&lt;/a&gt; for further development.

Club has the highest Strength scaling out of the hammers but it suffers from low base damage and &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; damage making other Hammers out perform it rather quickly when upgraded. Unfortunately, the club doesn't grow so well compared to the &lt;a href=\"Mace\"&gt;Mace&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Reinforced%20Club\"&gt;Reinforced Club&lt;/a&gt;. From \"Club\" to \"Club +15\", the damage will be increased from 87 to 182 (110% damage increase). The Mace and Reinforced Club, on the other hand, get a 150% damage increase. Even at lower Strength, the Club will be out damaged starting upgrade level +7. At 40 Strength: +9. This is because Club has its own unique scaling values that diverge from other Hammers when looking into the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KukblWL61We64-gNIyaAShga9h8RTXYmyFs98eQhY4E/edit%3Fgid%3D853753739%23gid%3D853753739\"&gt;game parameter files&lt;/a&gt;. \nLike all &lt;a href=\"Hammers%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, if an attack doesn't connect with an enemy, the user will stumble and seem to not be able to handle the weight.

It is lightweight, has low stamina cost and excellent strength scaling from base level, allowing for very respectable damage. The club is reliable throughout the game and will often serve as a go-to weapon for strength builds in situations where speed is essential and heavier weapons become impractical."}

This, combined with its relatively low &lt;a href=\"weight\"&gt;weight&lt;/a&gt; and requirements, makes it a formidable weapon that is easily overlooked.\nThe main weakness of the Club is its heavy attacks, which are slow and heavily telegraphed, especially in comparison to the light attacks. However, these attacks will also hit much harder than the average heavy attack.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Warcry\"&gt;Warcry&lt;/a&gt; skill will further increase the Club's damage output, as well as change the normal heavy attack to a four-hit combo. This attack is harder to hit and is far more punishing, should it miss, but it also deals exceptional damage should all four hits connect.\nLike some other weapons, the Club can be used to trivialize major parts of the game, due to its ability to &lt;a href=\"stunlock\"&gt;stunlock&lt;/a&gt; most regular &lt;a href=\"Enemies%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; with its one-handed weak attack. For this reason, a &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; build (or any build, with enough patience), can comfortably use the club throughout the entire game (including on &lt;a href=\"NG%2B%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;NG+&lt;/a&gt; and onward).\nIts high damage relative to its weight makes the Club a good candidate for use with &lt;a href=\"Flynn%27s%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Flynn's Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nAlthough &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Gem\"&gt;Raw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Infusion%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;infusions&lt;/a&gt; are optimal at low Strength, it is always worth infusing the Club with a &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Gem\"&gt;Heavy Gem&lt;/a&gt; over leaving it uninfused, even at the base requirement of 10 Strength.\nUpgrades.\nReinforced with standard &lt;a href=\"Titanite%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Titanite&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "3757", "revid": "357104", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3757", "title": "Combustion", "text": "Combustion is a &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Pyromancy&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\".\nGeneral information.\nCombustion is a short-range pyromancy. When cast, players emit a burst of flame from their hand, which has a fire attack power of 1.6 times the Pyromancy Flame's magic adjust. The casting time is fast with little ending lag. Combustion deals relatively high fire damage especially when considering the earliness with which it can be obtained. It is surpassed by its more potent cousin, &lt;a href=\"Great%20Combustion\"&gt;Great Combustion&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nWith 16 casts per slot, combustion grants players a generous portion of fire damage to their arsenal. In many ways, combustion can be seen as another form of melee attack, except that it cannot be parried and has a larger hitbox than most weapons. In PvE, combustion is an excellent supplement to melee attacks, especially against creatures that block with shields as it will usually still deal a high amount of damage to them through shield. Combustion is also popular because it deals damage without burning stamina, while retaining many of the positive aspects of a melee attack. Keeping this in mind, players can quickly deal a high amount of damage to high-HP targets, especially slow-moving bosses, without having to wait for stamina to recharge.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, combustion is not very popular due to the prevalence of &lt;a href=\"Great%20Combustion\"&gt;Great Combustion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Flame\"&gt;Black Flame&lt;/a&gt;."}

At point blank range, an additional explosion is pre-cast, inflicting 0.45 times the Attack Rating of the catalyst for additional Fire damage.\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nThis skill acts as the Combustion pyromancies from previous games. It consumes a small amount of &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt;, but does not require an &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Attunement&lt;/a&gt; slot. This makes it useful for dealing with creatures weak to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;. This is the weakest form of pyromancy, but also one of the fastest.\nOnline gameplay.\nDue to the fast cast time, this skill can be useful for quickly getting in some point-blank damage on an enemy. In particular, its high stamina damage allows it and &lt;a href=\"Great%20Combustion%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;its stronger cousin&lt;/a&gt; to break open weaker &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; with relative ease, opening other players up for an easy &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;riposte&lt;/a&gt;."}

Gwyndolin later passed leadership of the Darkmoon Knights to her after he fell ill, an opportunity &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Sulyvahn\"&gt;Sulyvahn&lt;/a&gt; used to seize leadership of Irithyll, imprisoning Yorshka atop the tower where she remained, alone and oblivious to outside events; as such, she was kept unaware of &lt;a href=\"Aldrich%2C%20Devourer%20of%20Gods\"&gt;her brother's demise&lt;/a&gt;, and came to believe herself the leader of a covenant without followers, unaware that &lt;a href=\"Sirris%20of%20the%20Sunless%20Realms\"&gt;some remained&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe is voiced by .\nLocation.\nShe can be met in &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;, dwelling alone at the top of the &lt;a href=\"Prison%20Tower\"&gt;Prison Tower&lt;/a&gt; that rises high above the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Yorshka\"&gt;Church of Yorshka&lt;/a&gt;. It can be accessed from the rotating elevator located after the Darkmoon Tomb in Anor Londo. The tower can be reached regardless of the position of the elevator. The tower is visible in the distance and requires a step of faith onto open air to reveal an invisible bridge that leads to it.\nDescription.\nCaptain Yorshka is the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Darkmoon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Darkmoon Blades&lt;/a&gt; and accepts the player into their ranks if they have learned the &lt;a href=\"Gestures%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Darkmoon Loyalty gesture&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe is a tall and slim woman, with pale skin, blue eyes with scale-like markings around them, and dark green hair. She also has two pairs of pointy ears, with the larger pair having long and rigid lobes, as well as two long lobe-like tentacles hanging from her upper neck. She wears a white dress and a veil over her hair. She is barefoot and appears to have a tail not unlike that of a dragon. Yorshka talks in an older form of English, and lives in a tower secluded from the rest of &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nYorshka is the younger sister of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Dark Sun Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt;, with whom she shares only her mother, as her brother is &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn&lt;/a&gt;'s last born, but she demonstrates the draconic traits of a crossbreed in a more definite way than her brother, implying that the only mother that could have been shared was &lt;a href=\"Crossbreed%20Priscilla\"&gt;Priscilla&lt;/a&gt;. She claims to have little knowledge of the world, to the point of only knowing crows and dragons as beings capable of flight, implying that she comes from a very isolated place. Furthermore, the girl didn't even had a name.\nAt some point, after Gwyndolin had become the \"king of the gods\", Yorshka reached &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt;, the city her brother had built on the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; to house the &lt;a href=\"Gods%23Irithyllians%20and%20Descendants%20of%20Gods\"&gt;Irithyllians&lt;/a&gt;, hybrids between the race of the gods of Anor Londo and humans. Here she was welcomed by Gwyndolin who formed a relationship of strong affection with his newfound sister, giving her a &lt;a href=\"Yorshka%27s%20Chime\"&gt;sacred chime&lt;/a&gt; and even her own name that she lacked. Eventually even a &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Yorshka\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt; was built in her name inside Irithyll, exactly where the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariamis\"&gt;Painted World of Ariamis&lt;/a&gt; was once kept, in which she was venerated as a goddess by the &lt;a href=\"Irithyllian%20Slave\"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt; who worked in the city.\nAfter Gwyndolin was \"stricken by illness\" and forced to retreat to the old cathedral of Anor Londo, her brother entrusted her with command of the covenant of the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Darkmoon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Blades of the Darkmoon&lt;/a&gt;. The girl thus continued to lead the company by repeating her brother's ritual phrases by heart, leading the knights against the enemies of the gods and to watch over those who linked the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, accepting the &lt;a href=\"Proof%20of%20a%20Concord%20Kept\"&gt;proofs&lt;/a&gt; of their accomplished duty and rewarding them with the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Darkmoon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;miracles of Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt;, even without knowledge of their meaning\nHowever, &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Sulyvahn\"&gt;Sulyvahn&lt;/a&gt; would take advantage of the situation, declaring himself Pontiff and becoming the tyrant of Irihtyll. He managed to imprison Yorshka on the tower of her own church, isolating her from the whole world and holding her hostage. Over time, because they were integrated into the ranks of Sulyvahn's knights, killed or exiled, the Blades of the Darkmoon would lose all their followers, leaving the girl at the head of the covenant with no knights to guide and only its legacy to preserve. Yorshka would have remained alone on the tower, without hearing a thing from her brother and with only the chime that he had given her to console her from the loneliness. Despite her imprisonment, the humans of Irithyll, now enslaved by Pontiff Sulyvahn and subjected to his experiments, would continue to pray to the goddess in secret, worshipping the &lt;a href=\"Yorshka%27s%20Spear\"&gt;sacred spears&lt;/a&gt; that were enchanted with a soporific spell, trying to find comfort and rest from their condition even at the cost of hitting themselves with these weapons."}

It is first accessed by an elevator guarded by a &lt;a href=\"Consumed%20King%27s%20Knight\"&gt;Consumed King's Knight&lt;/a&gt;.

You can drop down to an intermediate floor while going down to avoid having to traverse the toxic sludge and loot an &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Shard\"&gt;Estus Shard&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Titanite%20Chunk%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Titanite Chunk&lt;/a&gt;.\nA large stone platform is raised above the swamp where another mace-wielding knight stands guard, and below this are corpses carrying the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Shadow Set&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Claws%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Claws&lt;/a&gt;, three &lt;a href=\"Black%20Firebomb%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Black Firebombs&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href=\"Human%20Pine%20Resin\"&gt;Human Pine Resin&lt;/a&gt;s. Some non-threatening &lt;a href=\"Rotten%20Slug\"&gt;Rotten Slug&lt;/a&gt;s also lurk here.\nAt the halfway point of the garden, &lt;a href=\"Hawkwood%20the%20Deserter\"&gt;Hawkwood&lt;/a&gt;'s summon sign can be found, and to the right is an elevator leading to a shortcut. This elevator also has an intermediate floor that can be dropped down on, leading to the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Ring\"&gt;Dragonscale Ring&lt;/a&gt; and allowing you to kill the &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Priest\"&gt;Lothric Priest&lt;/a&gt; that overlooks the knights in front of the door to &lt;a href=\"Oceiros%2C%20the%20Consumed%20King\"&gt;Oceiros, the Consumed King&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeyond Oceiros, there are chambers with dead &lt;a href=\"Man%20Serpent\"&gt;Man Serpent&lt;/a&gt;s, with one still alive.

They have significantly more attack power and defense than their cathedral counterparts and can easily kill a player if they are cornered.

If a heavy weapon is used, the player should make sure that the corvian will die in one or two hits.\nIt is not advisable to engage more than one of these creatures at a time due to the constant damage output they can deal and their quick recovery times. If they are found congregated in front of a &lt;a href=\"Corvian%20Storyteller\"&gt;storyteller&lt;/a&gt;, either the latter should be dealt first or each corvian should be drawn in individually with ranged attacks.

Whenever a Painting begins to rot, those who settled within it resolve to burn it away in order to give way for the creation of a new one. When the Corvians were faced with this event, they were prepared to burn it. However, after &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Friede\"&gt;Sister Friede&lt;/a&gt; arrived in the Painting, the Corvian Knights became infatuated with her, choosing to loyally serve her and assist in her mission to let the world rot instead. To that end, the Corvian Knights betrayed their brethren, and their loyalty to Friede was so devout that they willingly slaughtered their own kin if they were perceived to be a threat.\nStrategy.\nCorvian Knights are incredibly agile opponents and will regularly backflip away or leap over the player to disorient them, often following up with a lunging stab. This can be punished by dodging and backstabbing. Their flurry of blade attacks can rapidly inflict bleed, even when guarding through a shield, so it's not recommended to attempt to block their strikes. From a distance, they will throw several knives and will often perform this attack if the player attempts to heal or use an item.\nThe robed Corvian Knights will pursue and eliminate the lesser Corvians around the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariandel%23Bonfires\"&gt;settlement&lt;/a&gt;, although they will focus on the player if alerted. The variant wielding &lt;a href=\"Crow%20Talons\"&gt;talons&lt;/a&gt; is often encountered hiding upside down under bridges and ceilings, so it is advisable for the player to be mindful of their surroundings."}

They are always accompanied by several Corvians.\nStrategy.\nAlthough physically imposing, Storytellers have little vitality and offer little in the way of physical offense. From a distance, they will use their staff's weapon art to prevent the player from reaching them, but there is a long delay before they can cast the spell and they are easily staggered out of it. They may also cast a wave of fire from the tip of their staff, in a semi-circular motion.\nStorytellers will alert any nearby Corvians once they spot the player, which will cause them to begin transforming into their berserk state.

Successfully countering an enemy will increase damage inflicted by approximately 20%.\nA counter attack can be distinguished from a normal attack by a small flash of white light upon contact, not to be confused with a flash of green light which indicates &lt;a href=\"Stagger%20Damage\"&gt;Stagger Damage&lt;/a&gt;.\nA counterattack must be performed during a relatively small window for the bonus damage to be applied. This is usually when the enemy is at the peak of their attack animation, when the attack would have otherwise connected, or immediately afterwards, but can vary widely depending on the enemy.\nDark Souls II.\nIn\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\", counter damage can be inflicted with any damage type, including elemental damage, instead of just physical thrusting weapons. Exact rules for when Counter applies aren't documented but is generally accepted as being when an action is being used, such as an attack or item usage.\nCounter-damage now scales with each weapon's Counter Strength multiplying the standard damage it deals. Note that this modifier does not affect &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;ripostes&lt;/a&gt;.\nCounter Strength is denoted in the menus for each weapon but is not always the displayed number. Many weapons use numbers different than those listed and many attacks have their own modifiers that are applied to Counter Strength.\nIn the weapon info boxes, the section called Effective Counter Mod represents the most common Counter Strength value among all the attacks a weapon has (in statistical terms, the Mode).\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q2XU5P027wuP00L9prYfL-amTw7KOeRWrLMdJfSOZ1o/edit%3Fusp%3Dsharing\"&gt;Datasheet with all counter values in Dark Souls II Scholar of the First Sin different from menu values.&lt;/a&gt;\nDark Souls III.\nCounter damage returns yet again in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;\". When an entity is in attack frames, their absorption against Thrust damage decreases, causing them to take 30% more damage from that sub-type of physical damage.\nIt should not be confused with &lt;a href=\"Instability\"&gt;Instability&lt;/a&gt;, which is a different damage mechanic.\nStrategy.\nPerforming a counterattack can be useful against enemies with a very strong weapon, but very poor &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;. An example of such are torch-wielding &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20%28enemy%29\"&gt;Hollows&lt;/a&gt;, which deal high damage (at the start of the game), but have no poise. As a result, using a fast weapon, such as a &lt;a href=\"Katana\"&gt;Katana&lt;/a&gt;, would be an effective way of performing a counterattack. The only drawback is that when encountering stronger enemies with high poise, and\u00a0in &lt;a href=\"New%20Game%20Plus\"&gt;NG+&lt;/a&gt; and beyond, the usefulness of counterattacks begins to dwindle.\u00a0\nIn\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\", counter attacks are much easier to perform, specially if enemies are slow. (e.g.\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ironclad%20Soldier\"&gt;Ironclad Soldier&lt;/a&gt;) Most enemies will leave themselves open after a swing, allowing the player to inflict counter damage with ease."}

This art was able to grant powers once thought unattainable but that at one point also left a foul stain upon Courland's honor.\nCourland's craftsmen also managed to create artifacts that exploited this art, stitching together the &lt;a href=\"Titanite%20Scale\"&gt;Titanite Scale&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Ravenous%20Crystal%20Lizard\"&gt;Ravenous Crystal Lizard&lt;/a&gt;s. These creatures were in fact Crystal Lizards who, devouring souls, in rare cases grew to monstrous proportion and consequently their scales were connected to their natural ability to manipulate souls. The result were &lt;a href=\"Transposing%20Kiln\"&gt;Transposing Kiln&lt;/a&gt;s capable of transposing souls to craft powerful items with their concentrated essence. However the inappropriate use of them was deemed forbidden.\nAt some point a \"&lt;a href=\"Primordial%20Serpents\"&gt;Soulfeeder&lt;/a&gt;\". arrived in Courland, a beast that insatiably absorbed souls to feed its own power. The creature was finally defeated but, even if its accursed corpse was burned, the pungent stench of souls left the air permanently stained. However, using their transposition arts, the craftsmen of Courland managed to create a &lt;a href=\"Skull%20Ring\"&gt;Skull Ring&lt;/a&gt; from the soul of the creature, an artifact that makes the wearer easier to be detected by enemies.\nAt a certain point the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; began to fade again and the first &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Keeper\"&gt;Fire Keeper&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt; had a vision of the end of the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Age of Fire&lt;/a&gt; and the beginning of an &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Dark\"&gt;Age of Dark&lt;/a&gt;, a barren plane of endless darkness. For this reason, &lt;a href=\"Ludleth%20of%20Courland\"&gt;Ludleth of Courland&lt;/a&gt;, a student of the art of transposition, was called to become a &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;, to link the First Flame again and repel the vision of the Fire Keeper. Despite his apparent lack of strength and his small appearance, Ludleth managed to gain the strength necessary to become a Champion, something for which he himself expresses remorse, asking to be forgiven. Despite his role, Ludleth was then literally exiled from his country and collaborated with Lothric, ensuring that the first Fire Keeper was deprived of her &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20a%20Fire%20Keeper\"&gt;eyes&lt;/a&gt; and that all future maidens like her were deprived of their sight to prevent them from observing the future thanks to the power of their darkness.

Awaits on the roof of the ruined chapel in the &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;toxic&lt;/a&gt; swamp.\nStrategy.\nThe Court Sorcerer is a very aggressive opponent. He awaits on the roof of the ruined chapel in the &lt;a href=\"Profaned%20Capital\"&gt;Profaned Capital&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the area's layout, he will most likely approach from the rear while the player is making their way upstairs; this usually gives him the opportunity to start the battle by casting one of his &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;sorceries&lt;/a&gt;. His repertoire includes variations of &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Soul Spear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Greatsword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Soul Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Soulmass%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Homing Soulmass&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe also comes armed with a &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20Flame%20Hammer\"&gt;Gargoyle Flame Hammer&lt;/a&gt; and will quickly switch between casting spells and this weapon, frequently holding it with both hands for increased damage. His melee attacks are very similar to that of &lt;a href=\"Havel%20the%20Rock%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Havel&lt;/a&gt;'s, and thus he is often vulnerable after finishing a combo. Care must be taken, though, as he can quickly inflict a considerable amount of damage in return; more so if the player is taken off-balance due to the different tactics used for dealing with a sorcerer and a warrior.\nFortunately, he is not very resilient and is &lt;a href=\"stagger\"&gt;stagger&lt;/a&gt;ed easily, which allows the player to deal many consecutive hits."}

It has slimy skin, large forelegs (but seemingly no hind legs), and a tail. It also has a large mouth with many sharp teeth.\nThe albino miniboss version found in &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Eleum%20Loyce\"&gt;Frozen Eleum Loyce&lt;/a&gt; is almost identical to the boss version, albeit much more resilient.\nLore.\nThe Covetous Demon was once a man who fell in love with &lt;a href=\"Mytha%2C%20the%20Baneful%20Queen\"&gt;Queen Mytha&lt;/a&gt;, but she did not return his affections. He expressed his desire through excessive eating and eventually this gluttony transformed him into a ravenous abomination.\nStrategy.\nThe Covetous Demon's attacks are relatively easy to avoid, predictable or both. Most are short ranged, although the jumping attacks can cover a lot of ground. It also gives the player ample time to counterattack after some of its attacks are performed, making for a rather easy boss.\u00a0\nIn the room prior to the arena, two pots hang from the ceiling containing &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Laborer\"&gt;Undead Laborer&lt;/a&gt;s; they can be released via any projectile that is capable of breaking jars (spell projectiles aimed via &lt;a href=\"Binoculars%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Binoculars&lt;/a&gt;, as well as any arrow type that is capable of breaking such objects i.e. &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Arrow\"&gt;Iron Arrow&lt;/a&gt;s). This teaches the player that these enemies can be used as distractions inside the boss arena, where four such pots are present. Shooting one of these pots and releasing the Laborer within will cause it to cower and distract the Covetous Demon, which will ignore the player in favor of devouring its new prey. The Covetous Demon will devour the Undead Laborer over a period of several seconds, giving players plenty of time to deal damage. However, beware that the Covetous Demon will take 80% less damage while eating, though it will also remain still for a while after it is finished eating the Laborer, during which it will take full damage from attacks.\nMelee builds could face more of a challenge than range as getting close to him from any side can be perilous, especially when one is at his sides as he can roll, dealing heavy damage.\nBeing in front of the Demon may cause him to perform a grab attack where he picks up the player in his mouth, unequipping all the player's items in the process. This can be disastrous as finding time to re-equip the items mid-fight can be difficult. Always try to stay away from the Covetous Demon's mouth at all times, resorting to ranged combat instead if necessary and using the Undead Laborers as distractions where possible.\nThe demon found in &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Eleum%20Loyce\"&gt;Frozen Eleum Loyce&lt;/a&gt; is similar to the one in the &lt;a href=\"Harvest%20Valley\"&gt;Harvest Valley&lt;/a&gt;, albeit the battle takes place in a much wider room and there are no pots containing hollows with which to distract the creature. The demon itself is much more resilient to damage and it will take considerably more hits before it succumbs.\nIf &lt;a href=\"Maldron%20the%20Assassin\"&gt;Maldron&lt;/a&gt; was allowed to escape through the big gate in the upper area, he will come to this place and attack in conjunction with the demon, making the fight considerably harder. The player should also take care of not getting near the exit tunnel on the far right, as it contains two &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Rat\"&gt;Ice Rat&lt;/a&gt;s that may join the battle.\nAttacks.\nClaw Swipe: The Demon pulls its forearm back and swipes. Has moderate tracking, so if dodging, do so when it actually swipes.\nCrush:\u00a0Readies its body briefly, then rolls sideways towards the player. It can do this twice in a row.\nRoll Over:\u00a0Readies its body for a longer period than the normal rolling attack, and rolls on to its side, giving the player a good chance to attack, and rolls upright again.\nTail Slam: Lifts its tail into the air, then slams it down two or three times. Done when the player is behind the demon, it is a good chance to attack the front or sides of the boss.\u00a0\nLeap:\u00a0The Demon pauses for a moment, then jumps into the air in an attempt to land on the player. Roll out of the way as it is jumping.\nVomit:\u00a0The Demon spits out multiple balls of an unidentified liquid. They have a rather short range, so simply run away from the Demon to avoid.\nEat: Grabs the player with his mouth and chews on them a few times, dealing heavy damage. All the player's items are unequipped (armor, weapons, rings, etc.). If this happens, find an opening after one of its attacks and re-equip one item at a time. Due to the ease of dodging its attacks, a weapon and possibly shield are all that really need to be re-equipped.\nDefenses.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense.\n-35% thrust means taking 135% damage.\nDrops.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Harvest Valley =\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 Covetous Demon by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RDk30c4Rvw&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

Along with the Symbol of Avarice, the Covetous Gold Serpent Ring is one of the only items to increase item drop chance.\nThe ring is invaluable for hunting down upgrade materials for weapon and armor reinforcement, as well as rare items such as the &lt;a href=\"Channeler%27s%20Trident\"&gt;Channeler's Trident&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, his words are far from true. Creighton is allegedly an infamous serial killer from &lt;a href=\"Mirrah\"&gt;Mirrah&lt;/a&gt; who is willing to kill just for the pleasure of it. He's known for his animosity towards his former partner, the equally treacherous\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Mild-Mannered%20Pate\"&gt;Mild-Mannered Pate&lt;/a&gt;, and during the course of the game he pursues him in order to satiate his lust for revenge.\nAlthough he accuses Pate of being a manipulative and deceiving individual, Creighton is no different from his nemesis. Creighton appears to be able to hide his homicidal nature to the player and he constantly tries to convince the player that Pate is the one who should not be trusted.\nCreighton also seems to have a penchant for imitation equipment. The description of his armor set indicates that his armor is an imitation of the one worn by Mirrahian soldiers. His weapon also appears to be an imitation of the legendary &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%27s%20Crescent%20Axe\"&gt;Dragonslayer's Crescent Axe&lt;/a&gt; which was wielded by the legendary Forossan general &lt;a href=\"Shieldless%20Lothian\"&gt;Shieldless Lothian&lt;/a&gt;. It can be noted that the axe that Creighton uses doesn't have the lightning damage effect of Lothian's axe, which implies that Creighton's axe is indeed an imitation.\nPlot.\nCreighton is first encountered in the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Huntsman%27s%20Copse\"&gt;Huntsman's Copse&lt;/a&gt;. He is locked away in a cell containing the Undead Lockaway bonfire and needs the player to free him using the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Lockaway%20Key\"&gt;Undead Lockaway Key&lt;/a&gt;. When spoken to, he claims he had accidentally locked himself in a cell which was supposed to be a trap for Mild-Mannered Pate, his treasure hunting partner. Before leaving, he stresses that Pate is not to be trusted, calling him a \"backstabbing knave,\" and announces his intention to find and kill Pate as retribution for his many alleged misdeeds.\nIn \"\", he can be summoned as a white phantom to assist with the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Lords\"&gt;Skeleton Lords&lt;/a&gt; boss fight after exhausting his dialogue in Huntsman's Copse. His sign can be found in the cave full of Skeletons near the Undead Lockaway bonfire.\nCreighton can later be found in the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Shaded%20Woods\"&gt;Shaded Woods&lt;/a&gt;. He will tell the player that Pate lives near &lt;a href=\"Brightstone%20Cove%20Tseldora\"&gt;Brightstone Cove Tseldora&lt;/a&gt;, and gleefully anticipates finally tracking him down.\nHe can be found for the last time at Brightstone Cove Tseldora, engaged in a fight with Pate. The player may choose to help either one. The\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Tseldora%20Den%20Key\"&gt;Tseldora Den Key&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0will be obtained from the survivor of the fight given that the player has dealt enough damage to the other; in that case the survivor will also attempt to kill the player with a booby-trapped chest.\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Creighton%27s%20Set\"&gt;Creighton's armor set&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0will be obtained from Creighton only in the case that you help him defeat Pate. If the player assists neither and lets them fight to the death, the survivor will not give the player the Tseldora Den Key and it will become unobtainable.\nLore.\nIf the player talks to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Cale%20the%20Cartographer\"&gt;Cale the Cartographer&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in &lt;a href=\"Majula\"&gt;Majula&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0after meeting Creighton, he will tell a story about a serial murderer from &lt;a href=\"Mirrah\"&gt;Mirrah&lt;/a&gt;. Before the man's execution, he escaped, and was never seen again. Cale claims he recently saw a man strikingly similar. Cale cannot recall the man's name but says it was something along the lines of \"Cray\".\nAside from having no reason to use \"well-crafted imitation armor\", as Creighton's armor set describes, he would have been more likely to have gone Hollow while in Drangleic, than to have gone Hollow while in Mirrah and gone on a murder spree. Although it is still possible he could have lost his mind in other ways."}

Eventually, he invades her as a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Spirit%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;dark spirit&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt; and is defeated by her and the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20One\"&gt;Ashen One&lt;/a&gt;.\nCreighton later invades the player's world in revenge if he was defeated in the first encounter. Defeating him here awards the player with the &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%27s%20Axe\"&gt;Dragonslayer's Axe&lt;/a&gt; and causes a corpse to appear on the bridge into &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Mirrah%20Chain%20Set\"&gt;Mirrah Chain Set&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\nFound twice as a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Spirit%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;dark spirit&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt;:\nStrategy.\nCreighton will attack in combos when given the opportunity and will often use his weapon's &lt;a href=\"Warcry\"&gt;Warcry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; in order to increase the damage dealt. His &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%27s%20Axe\"&gt;Dragonslayer's Axe&lt;/a&gt; can deal &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage with each strike, so blocking the attacks is not recommended as they will still deal damage through shields. He is also equipped with an &lt;a href=\"Obscuring%20Ring\"&gt;Obscuring Ring&lt;/a&gt;, so be sure to stay near him at all times to avoid losing track of him.\nHe will occasionally use a charged strong attack to deal heavy damage, and if the player is far away, he can also perform a running attack that can quickly close the distance. However, the charged attack can be easily interrupted with a fast enough weapon, leaving him wide open for follow-up combos. He also leaves himself vulnerable at the end of his weapon combos, allowing players to get good damage in.\nCreighton will use his &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt; to heal when he is at low health up to two times. When he is out of Estus or is under the effects of an &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Hunter%20Charm\"&gt;Undead Hunter Charm&lt;/a&gt;, he will resort to using a &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Blessing%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Divine Blessing&lt;/a&gt;, but will not use any more methods of healing once exhausted. Similarly, if the player attempts to use an Estus Flask near him, he may attempt to throw an Undead Hunter Charm. He will also occasionally use a &lt;a href=\"Duel%20Charm\"&gt;Duel Charm&lt;/a&gt; if the player attempts to use buffs.\nDuring the fight on the bridge in &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll&lt;/a&gt;, the player has the advantage of having &lt;a href=\"Sirris%20of%20the%20Sunless%20Realms\"&gt;Sirris&lt;/a&gt; as an ally. Try to exploit this by attacking Creighton from multiple angles and combining attacks to deal large amounts of instantaneous damage. It is best to try to draw Creighton's attention as much as possible, as Sirris dying will immediately cause the battle to end. Occasionally, Sirris may cast &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Blade%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Darkmoon Blade&lt;/a&gt; in order to deal additional damage to Creighton with her attacks.\nIn the graveyard behind the &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley%23Bonfires\"&gt;Church of Yorshka&lt;/a&gt;, players may have to deal with the two &lt;a href=\"Irithyllian%20Slave\"&gt;Irithyllian Slave&lt;/a&gt;s as well as the red-eyed &lt;a href=\"Corvian\"&gt;Corvian&lt;/a&gt; at the same time as Creighton; the two Irithyllian Slaves can be eliminated before Creighton invades, while the Corvian will not aggro unless the player strays too close. Alternatively, if the player is not a &lt;a href=\"Host%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Host of Embers&lt;/a&gt;, they can choose to clear the graveyard before consuming an &lt;a href=\"Ember\"&gt;Ember&lt;/a&gt;. Beware of the hilly terrain and possible obstacles in the scattered gravestones, and be sure not to stray too close to the cliffside. Resourceful players can also use the cliff to their advantage by baiting Creighton near it and then staggering him over the edge for an easy victory."}

He is largely indifferent toward the player's presence and considers their efforts to be a lost cause, citing giving up and going hollow as better alternatives. Despite his lifeless demeanor and discouraging words, he does have interesting dialogue that fleshes out the backstory for \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\", as well as hints on equipment, where to go next, and other characters.\nSpeaking to the Crestfallen Warrior after &lt;a href=\"Kingseeker%20Frampt\"&gt;Kingseeker Frampt&lt;/a&gt; arrives will prompt him to leave Firelink Shrine, complaining of the \"stench\" (presumably given off by Frampt).

The Crestfallen Warrior is nimble with his &lt;a href=\"Longsword\"&gt;Longsword&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heater%20Shield\"&gt;Heater Shield&lt;/a&gt;, but with some dodging and blocking he usually poses little threat by the time the player encounters him as a &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;Hollow&lt;/a&gt;. The one trick up his sleeve is his ability to &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt; unexpectedly. The Crestfallen Warrior is one of the only NPCs that does not have a unique parry \"stance\", so players can do little to nothing to predict when he is going to do so."}

Critical attacks are performed in what is considered the most vulnerable areas of enemies. There are four types of critical attacks: &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%23Riposting\"&gt;riposte&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"headshot\"&gt;headshot&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"plunging%20attack\"&gt;plunging attack&lt;/a&gt;s.\n\"Dark Souls\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\", critical attacks do bonus damage based on a weapon's \"critical\" stat. Most weapons possess a critical multiplier of 100, but &lt;a href=\"Thrusting%20Swords\"&gt;Thrusting Swords&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daggers\"&gt;Daggers&lt;/a&gt; have a higher critical multiplier, and thus do more damage when executing a critical attack. \nRipostes will do more bonus damage than backstabs, but can also be considerably harder to execute, as they need a parry or a guard-break to happen.\nThe &lt;a href=\"plunging%20attack\"&gt;plunging attack&lt;/a&gt; is the rarest and most damaging critical attack. For this strike a higher ground is required, in which the player must jump and while falling hit the normal attack button, thus making the plunge attack dependent on the terrain.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hornet%20Ring\"&gt;Hornet Ring&lt;/a&gt; increases the damage of critical attacks by an additional 30%. Wearing the ring also changes the animation of backstabs and ripostes when using certain weapons against human enemies. &lt;a href=\"Headshot\"&gt;Headshot&lt;/a&gt;s are not affected by the Hornet Ring. \n\"Dark Souls III\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;\", a critical attack can generally be performed on a target once it is put in a vulnerable state.\nA riposte can be performed on a target that has had an attack parried, or has been guard broken due to stamina being completely depleted while guarding with a &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;. In the case of certain large enemies and &lt;a href=\"Boss%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt;, a critical can be taken once enough damage has been inflicted to a vital part of their body, or if enough damage has been inflicted in general.\nA backstab can be performed on the target if they are attacked from behind. When the player is behind the target and performs a weak attack, they will begin an animation where they pull their weapon back in preparation to perform the critical. If the target is still within range of the player once the backstab animation completes, the critical attack will then take place.\nUpon successfully initiating a critical, the player and target are both placed in an uninterruptible animation where both parties cannot take damage from outside sources, and the target takes the critical damage. Both parties will only be able to perform additional actions once the critical animation is complete.\nDamage inflicted by the critical can be increased if the player has equipped the &lt;a href=\"Hornet%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Hornet Ring&lt;/a&gt;. If the target is wearing the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Ring\"&gt;Dragonscale Ring&lt;/a&gt;, damage from a backstab critical is decreased.\nDamage multipliers.\nThe amount of damage dealt by a critical is dependent on its weapon class, as well as whether or not the initiator is wearing the Hornet Ring, which modifies the critical animation. For each weapon class, the critical damage can be further increased by its critical modifier.\nEach portion of a critical attack multiplies the initiating weapon's Attack Rating as follows:"}

This means the wielders have to rely on the lock-on to guide the bolts to their targets, and that they cannot choose to aim for &lt;a href=\"critical\"&gt;critical&lt;/a&gt; head shots. Headshots still do bonus critical damage, but are almost impossible to do in most situations. To make up for lack of a manual aim, Crossbows generally have slightly better attack power than Bows, and have a lower starting lag for their attacks. Because of the nature of how they operate, Crossbows are much better suited to doing some quick damage while advancing on a target before engaging them in melee combat. None of the Crossbows feature any kind of &lt;a href=\"Stats%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;stat&lt;/a&gt; scaling, therefore upgrading them to &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; variants is often highly effective.\nThe lack of an aiming mode can be partially solved with the use of &lt;a href=\"Binoculars\"&gt;Binoculars&lt;/a&gt; before shooting.\nThe and value of a crossbow attack is additionally dependent on the type of &lt;a href=\"bolts\"&gt;bolts&lt;/a&gt; the player has equipped. If the player dual-wields two crossbows, ammunition is selected individually for each crossbow. This allows each respective crossbow to potentially fire a different kind of bolt.\nWhile crossbows can be two-handed, there is no benefit to doing so. In fact, two-handing crossbows is actually detrimental, as doing so increases the starting lag and thus lowers the player's DPS.\nCrossbows.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nDetailed=\nCondensed=\nUpgraded=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

This makes them ideal ranged weapons for engaging foes within lock-on range.\nCrossbows can be equipped in either the main hand or off hand. When two-handed, all crossbows have a \"zoom\" feature, activated by pressing the off-hand weak attack button (or block), that allows the player to manually aim their shots from a first-person point of view. It should be noted that different types of &lt;a href=\"Ammunition%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bolts&lt;/a&gt; have varying ranges that add to a specific crossbow's range.

She is initially non-hostile and will ask the player to leave the world without fighting. \n&lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20Priscilla\"&gt;Her soul&lt;/a&gt; can be used to &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Modification\"&gt;ascend&lt;/a&gt; a +10 &lt;a href=\"Halberds\"&gt;Halberd&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Whips\"&gt;Whip&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Lifehunt%20Scythe\"&gt;Lifehunt Scythe&lt;/a&gt;. As with other &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; bosses, the player can also obtain a special weapon by cutting her tail off during combat, &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%27s%20Dagger\"&gt;Priscilla's Dagger&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nPriscilla is a humanoid half-dragon roughly five meters tall. Her skin is extremely pale, her hair is stark white and she has a patch of fur beneath her hairline resembling an exaggerated widow's peak. This fur is framed by a row of small white spikes just above her brows. \nShe has a fluffy white articulate tail with draconic proportions that emerges between two layers of her gown, which is of the same furry texture. She is capable of turning invisible and walks barefoot despite the snowy terrain.\nShe speaks very softly, and attempts diplomacy with those who invade her world but prominently carries a large scythe capable of absorbing the life of her opponents for self-defense.\nLore.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;.\nPriscilla is a crossbreed of the dragon &lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;Seath&lt;/a&gt; and a human woman, likely a result of Seath's many experiments in his search for immortality.\nShe was feared by the &lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;gods&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; and treated as an abomination due to the fact that her own body was naturally infused with the &lt;a href=\"Occult%20%28auxiliary%20effect%29\"&gt;occult power&lt;/a&gt; capable of killing them.. She possessed also &lt;a href=\"Lifehunt%20Scythe\"&gt;life-hunting&lt;/a&gt; powers and her lineage identified her as completely antithetical to the order and life of the gods. \nEventually Priscilla was sealed away from the world because she was considered \"taboo\" into the cold and lonely &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariamis\"&gt;Painted World of Ariamis&lt;/a&gt;, created by &lt;a href=\"Ariamis\"&gt;Ariamis&lt;/a&gt; with the purpose of leaving her alone. The Painted World came to be protected by a specific order of &lt;a href=\"Painting%20Guardian\"&gt;Painting Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, such was the perceived threat she posed to the reigning Gods. The Gods continued to use the Painted World as a prison, a place to seal away &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ember\"&gt;dangerous artifacts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Engorged%20Hollow\"&gt;abominations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crow%20Demon\"&gt;sinners&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;Hollow&lt;/a&gt;s. Eventually, &lt;a href=\"Velka%2C%20Goddess%20of%20Sin\"&gt;Velka&lt;/a&gt; spread her influence inside the painted world, as she was the Goddess of Sin. Dozens of &lt;a href=\"Crow%20Demon\"&gt;her cultist followers&lt;/a&gt; found refuge there, and potentially endeavored to protect Priscilla from the other Gods.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt; encounters Priscilla, she has come to see herself as a guardian of the Painted World, which she characterizes as \"peaceful,\" and its \"kind\" inhabitants. She pities those trapped within the painting, as the outside world has treated them with hate and locked them away, like herself. She is not hostile to visitors from the outside world, unless provoked, and will only ask them to leave in peace because they don't belong in there, and she will also deny anyone interested in her.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point Priscilla would become the \"Lady\" of the Painted World and its inhabitants by extension, continuing to welcome the forlorns led into the cold world by the tales of the heretical, corvian storytellers and gifting them &lt;a href=\"Great%20Corvian%20Scythe\"&gt;great scythes&lt;/a&gt;. At some point her &lt;a href=\"Lifehunt%20Scythe\"&gt;Lifehunt Scythe&lt;/a&gt; becoming the symbol of a distant nostalgia. The &lt;a href=\"Corvian\"&gt;humanoid corvians&lt;/a&gt; who continued to find refuge in the painting would then form a &lt;a href=\"Corvian%20Settlement\"&gt;small village&lt;/a&gt;, complete with a library and &lt;a href=\"Corvian%20Knight\"&gt;knights&lt;/a&gt;, developing a high understanding of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Soul\"&gt;Dark Soul&lt;/a&gt;, using the Flame to \"restore\" the Painted World when it was corrupted from time, to avoid the fate of the stagnating outside world. For this purpose, a \"&lt;a href=\"Father%20Ariandel\"&gt;Father&lt;/a&gt;\" was chosen among the corvians who would have to tend to the Flame present in the Painted World to burn it when the time was right and prepare the next one by restoring the painting.\nPriscilla would also have a &lt;a href=\"The%20Painter\"&gt;daughter&lt;/a&gt; who would inherit her draconic traits, along with her high levels of knowledge about the First Flame and the Dark Soul, becoming a \"painter\" with the abilities to harness the two forces and paint Painted Worlds.\nBoss information.\nAttacks.\nSingle Slash.\nThis is a single attack that has good forward range and tracks quite well to both sides. While it is fairly damaging, it can be blocked but not [[parried]]. This attack also causes [[Bleed (Dark Souls)|Bleed]] upon hitting or being blocked.\nDouble Slash.\nVirtually the same as the Single Slash, but with two slashes instead, once from right to left and then left to right. There is a large gap between attacks, and can also track the player.\nFairy Dust.\nAfter a short delay, Priscilla blows a concentrated cloud of blue particles directly in front of her or in a sweeping motion. The resulting cloud lingers for a few seconds afterward. This attack deals a large amount of damage and is difficult to block.\nInvisibility.\nPriscilla turns invisible, whilst still being able to attack the player. Leaves large footprints in the snow.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls \u2014 Crossbreed Priscilla by [[imdb:nm1245713|Motoi Sakuraba]]\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XSbn5EOLdE&lt;/embedvideo&gt;\nFootnotes.\n[[Category:Dark Souls: Characters]]\n[[Category:Dark Souls: Optional Bosses]]\n[[Category:Dragons]]\n[[es:Priscilla la Mestiza]]\n[[pl:P\u00f3\u0142smoczyca Priscilla]]\n[[ru:\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0446\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0430 \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430]]"}

They are a combination of a &lt;a href=\"hollow\"&gt;hollow&lt;/a&gt;'s torso and legs, and a crow's dishevelled wings and head.\nStrategy.\nCrow Demons perform fairly simple attacks for the most part. However, they can fly across short distances, and are able to close gaps very quickly with a potentially fatal grab-attack. This can be easily avoided by staggering them, rolling, or by constantly moving. As soon as they have reached the height at which they dive from, they will cease to track the target's location much like throwing a &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Firebomb\"&gt;Firebomb&lt;/a&gt;. Try not to roll too late, as invincibility frames will not prevent being grabbed. Moving closer to them as they ready their attack will also work, as their flight angle is too high.\nCrow Demons are easier engaged one by one, although certain areas make it difficult to lure a single Crow Demon. Players can manipulate the spiral staircase inside the tower where several Crow Demons spawn to force them over the edge, netting easy kills."}

Jump it and go into the house on your right. Barrels will be blocking a platform that you need to run and leap off of and land on the elevated platform with the Crow Quills.\nCharacteristics.\nA special thrusting sword, the Crow Quills are specially suited for aggressive playstyles and can be a force to be reckoned with in the right hands.\n&lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Scaling&lt;/a&gt; primarily with &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;, this weapon's one-handed attacks are the same as that of normal thrusting swords. However, when two-handed, rather than holding the weapon in both hands, the wielder will brandish a set of blades in the off-hand and use them to perform combination attacks. Whereas most thrusting swords have narrow poking attacks that are aimed forward, the Crow Quills allows the wielder to use the blades for slashing attacks, providing wider horizontal coverage than a thrusting sword is normally capable of. This gives the Crow Quills a rather versatile &lt;a href=\"moveset\"&gt;moveset&lt;/a&gt; in which the left-handed blades can cover for the right-handed sword's weaknesses. Of special note, the two-handed running attack provides &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt; to the wielder, something that no other thrusting sword is capable of doing.\nThe Crow Quills also possesses a unique &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; in that the off-hand blades can be thrown in a fan-shaped pattern while leaping in the air. This grants the wielder a form of ranged damage while performing an evasive maneuver, which can be a useful tool in the hands of crafty players."}

It is a split-damage weapon, inflicting both physical and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; damage with its attacks. This damage &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;scales&lt;/a&gt; primarily with &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt;, with Faith being the more important component as it governs both damage types. Along with its non-negligible &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; wielding requirement, this means that any build that wishes to use this weapon must be specifically tailored to use it.\nUnlike other halberds, the Crucifix possesses the &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; health and Poise damage of a &lt;a href=\"Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;greatsword&lt;/a&gt;, giving it extremely powerful &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt; attacks and allowing it to more easily break the Poise of opponents. As well, rather than the standard spinning sweep attacks of most halberds, the Crucifix borrows its strong attacks from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Club%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Great Club&lt;/a&gt;, and as a result its strong attacks cannot be &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parried&lt;/a&gt; under any circumstance, even when one-handed.\nDespite upgrading with &lt;a href=\"Twinkling%20Titanite%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Twinkling Titanite&lt;/a&gt;, the Crucifix can still be buffed, and this attribute is what makes it one of the most powerful weapons in the game. As its innate Dark damage scales with Faith, this component of its damage output can be further increased by buffing it with additional Dark damage, particularly by casting &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Blade\"&gt;Dark Blade&lt;/a&gt; on it, which also increases in strength with Faith investment. When wielded in this manner, a Crucifix of the Mad King can inflict damage that rivals that dealt by &lt;a href=\"Ultra%20Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;ultra greatswords&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerhaps the most unique aspect of the Crucifix is its skill, &lt;a href=\"Mad%20King%27s%20Folly\"&gt;Mad King's Folly&lt;/a&gt;. The starting attack possesses extremely powerful &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt; and inflicts high Poise damage, but following up with the pygmy king's various enchantments can allow the wielder to bring additional power to the weapon, albeit in an unpredictable manner.\nAll of these strengths do not come without drawbacks, however. Despite being a halberd, it is one of the shortest in its class, with many &lt;a href=\"Spears%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;spears&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"Reapers%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;reapers&lt;/a&gt; being able to easily out-range it. Additionally, it is a ravenous consumer of stamina, with many of its attacks costing more than the same attacks by its cousins, thus requiring its wielder to invest more in &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverall, despite these shortcomings, the Crucifix of the Mad King is still a very formidable weapon, one that is capable of inflicting tremendous amounts of damage against its foes.\nMoveset.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"https%3A//youtu.be/gIGh1SzTsPw%3Ft%3D183\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nUpgrades.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

It is also amongst the weapons that deal the most &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; damage, at a value of 60.\nUpgrades on this weapon will only raise its damage value, and it will raise its D in Strength up to a C, which will only provide a very minute damage increase. However, should a player have good values of &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, it is suggested that they infuse this weapon with Dark, as it will instead turn the A value of Dark into S. This is an outstanding upgrade as it will vastly increase the Dark damage by a considerable amount, turning this weapon into almost a Dark damage version of the &lt;a href=\"Moonlight%20Greatsword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Moonlight Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;. This is useful because should an enemy block a player's attack with a shield that has little to no Dark resistance, then most of the damage dealt will go through it and damage the enemy. Using either the &lt;a href=\"Resonant%20Weapon\"&gt;Resonant Weapon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Weapon\"&gt;Dark Weapon&lt;/a&gt; Hex is also a very good idea in order to further boost the Dark damage. \nThis weapon counts as a &lt;a href=\"Greataxes%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Greataxe&lt;/a&gt; for the purposes of &lt;a href=\"Power%20Stance\"&gt;Powerstancing&lt;/a&gt;."}

Creation of a Crystal weapon requires a &lt;a href=\"standard%20weapon\"&gt;standard weapon&lt;/a&gt; +10, &lt;a href=\"Titanite%20Chunk\"&gt;Titanite Chunk&lt;/a&gt;s for upgrading to +4, and a &lt;a href=\"Titanite%20Slab\"&gt;Titanite Slab&lt;/a&gt; for upgrading to +5, as well as the requisite &lt;a href=\"souls\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt;.\nAditionally, a Crystal &lt;a href=\"Halberd\"&gt;Halberd&lt;/a&gt; and a Crystal &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Shield\"&gt;Knight Shield&lt;/a&gt; can be found inside &lt;a href=\"Mimic\"&gt;Mimics&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"The%20Duke%27s%20Archives\"&gt;The Duke's Archives&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. The former is found in the room to the left coming from the first bonfire, to the right guarded by two &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;. The latter is found in the room of the elevator that takes you to &lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;Seath&lt;/a&gt; for the first time, towards the right half of the front of the room when you go up the stairs.\nGeneral information.\nCrystal weapons are functionally very similar to weapons upgraded down the &lt;a href=\"Standard%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;Standard&lt;/a&gt; path: they deal only &lt;a href=\"physical%20damage\"&gt;physical damage&lt;/a&gt;, can be &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Augmentation\"&gt;augmented&lt;/a&gt;, and gain increased scaling with &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; at +0 and +4.\u00a0\nHowever, Crystal weapons have some important characteristics that set them apart from Standard weapons. Crystal weapons deal higher damage than Standard weapons, making them the most powerful choice for Dexterity and Strength builds. On the other hand, Crystal weapons cannot be repaired, and their durability is reduced to a tenth of its original value. For example, a weapon which has an original durability of 200 will have a durability of 20 as a Crystal item.\nAs a consequence of upgrading weapons and\u00a0shields down the Crystal path, once the item's durability runs out, it can only be restored by upgrading. Once a +5 Crystal weapon breaks, it is permanently broken. Thus, the Crystal upgrade path is most suitable for weapons which can be re-obtained in the same play-through. Unlike other upgrade paths, Crystal weapons cannot be &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Modification%23Downgrading\"&gt;reverted&lt;/a&gt; to their standard state.\nNotes.\nFurther reinforcing Crystal weapons restores their durability.\u00a0\nUsing the &lt;a href=\"East%20Wood%20Grain%20Ring\"&gt;East Wood Grain Ring&lt;/a&gt; can extend the life of Crystal weapons by slowing the degradation of the weapon."}

This transformation costs no &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Point\"&gt;Focus Point&lt;/a&gt;s, and reduces the wielder to walking speed while it is active.\nThe skill is also context-sensitive, and activating it while running, rolling or immediately after any regular attack will perform a unique transforming attack, each of them costing 8 FP (6 FP with the &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Ring\"&gt;Farron Ring&lt;/a&gt; equipped):\nOnce in its transformed mode, the weapon can perform a chain of two weak attacks or two strong attacks:\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nBecause this skill augments the weapon's Magic damage while also slightly weakening its Physical damage, this skill is most optimally used should the wielder have high &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. However, as Focus Points are a precious resource, it is ideal to try to limit the use of this skill unless a &lt;a href=\"Simple%20Gem\"&gt;Simple&lt;/a&gt;-infused tool is being carried in the off-hand.\nOnline gameplay.\nThe different timings, animations and reach on all of the trick attacks make the Aquamarine Dagger an extremely hard weapon to predict. In the hands of an aggressive player, it becomes a monster of a weapon, able to dance around foes and catch them no matter how they attempt to evade it. The lunging trick attacks can be used to chase down foes that try to roll away, and the combination weak attacks can catch people trying to outspace it.\nFor best results, it is ideal to combine the trick and transformation attacks with standard attacks using the dagger itself. As well, one should be very mindful of &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; consumption while using this skill, as it consumes copious amounts of stamina."}

However, Sorceries and Miracles that do not directly deal damage, such as &lt;a href=\"Heal%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt;, the healing effect of &lt;a href=\"Lifehunt%20Scythe%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lifehunt Scythe&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Weapon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic Weapon&lt;/a&gt;, will only use the Spell Buff gained from their respective stats. If Intelligence and Faith are equal, this will be half of the MagAdjust above 100, such that having 180 MagAdjust would cast Heal as if MagAdjust were only 140.\nDue to its high natural MagAdjust at low levels of Intelligence and Faith, it is still stronger than other spell tools for these non-damaging applications before 35 Faith or Intelligence.\nThe Crystal Chime is not attuned with the Dark, and will not gain the 1.4x bonus damage with Dark spells like an &lt;a href=\"Izalith%20Staff\"&gt;Izalith Staff&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Caitha%27s%20Chime%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Caitha's Chime&lt;/a&gt; would.

The first soft-cap is encountered at 30 Intelligence and 30 Faith, up to which its scaling increases the fastest. Beyond this point, Spell Buff will still increase appreciably but slower than before, until reaching the second soft-cap of 45 Intelligence and 45 Faith. At levels of Intelligence and Faith higher than this, it is ideal to instead equip the &lt;a href=\"Court%20Sorcerer%27s%20Staff\"&gt;Court Sorcerer's Staff&lt;/a&gt; to cast Sorceries, and &lt;a href=\"Yorshka%27s%20Chime\"&gt;Yorshka's Chime&lt;/a&gt; to cast Miracles. \nUpgrades.\nReinforced with &lt;a href=\"Twinkling%20Titanite%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Twinkling Titanite&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Official translation=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;"}

If the player approaches a lizard, it will attempt to escape by any means, even by jumping off ledges and vanishing. They drop different forms of &lt;a href=\"Upgrade%20Materials%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;upgrade materials&lt;/a&gt; upon death and do not respawn.\nGeneral information.\nUnlike their &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;previous game&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Lizard\"&gt;counterparts&lt;/a&gt;, whose loot was randomly selected from a set of drops, each Crystal Lizard in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\" has a single fixed drop. These drops most of the time include two or three types of and may have different quantities of each one. Furthermore, if a lizard manages to escape, they can be reset by resting at a &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;, making it easier for the player to get all possible loot from them in areas where enemies abound (like in &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aerie\"&gt;Dragon Aerie&lt;/a&gt;). Once slain, they won't respawn until the next &lt;a href=\"New%20Game%20Plus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;New Game cycle&lt;/a&gt;, or when an &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20Ascetic\"&gt;ascetic&lt;/a&gt; is burned in the bonfire that governs them. However, if using a Bonfire Ascetic, they will not drop their loot again; only a New Game cycle will reset the loot.\nStrategy.\nCrystal Lizards usually have high amounts of HP and sometimes may require more than one hit to kill. They usually dwell at plain sight, however, allowing players to plan a strategy before attempting to hunt them. Approaching them from the rear is not recommended, as the lizard will just start moving in the direction it's already facing, most likely outrunning the player and succeeding in their escape. If there's no other option than to approach them from behind, though, the player should try to make them either run into a wall or a dead end if possible.\nOn the other hand, if approached from the front, the lizard will first have to slowly turn around before attempting to escape, giving the player ample time to slay it.\nIf a lizard is far away but already facing at the player's direction, thus giving it enough time to turn around and escape before the player can even make it to their location, a good strategy is to shoot them with a ranged attack (e.g.: an arrow); this will make the lizard to start running forward and toward the player's location, making it easier to finish it.\nRed Crystal Lizards.\nUnlike their blue counterparts, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Crystal%20Lizard\"&gt;Red Crystal Lizard&lt;/a&gt;s may explode when approached or attacked. They don't drop any items upon death and only appear as minor hindrances to the player. They won't respawn once slain and the player may opt to kill them as soon as possible to remove the threat they impose from the map.\nGuide.\nThis guide refers to the version of \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\". It lists all Crystal Lizards appearing in the game and the loot dropped by each one. Some locations may differ from the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;original game&lt;/a&gt;."}

These enemies are non-hostile, in fact quite the opposite as they will attempt to run away if the player approaches them.\nStrategy.\nCrystal Lizards can be ran up on quick enough to deliver a heavy blow with either a heavy or medium weapon, toppling them and allowing for another successful hit. This is also possible with other lighter weapons, although subsequent attacks become much less likely to connect.\nThe player can steer a lizard's direction of movement by running around them opposite to the direction they want them to face. Using this strategy to push them into walls and away from danger can make them much easier to deal with in situations where killing them can be difficult or risky.\nAdditionally, if the player missed a lizard on their first try, they can make them respawn by quitting and reloading the game.

Finally, while Crystal Magic Weapon benefits from the &lt;a href=\"Lingering%20Dragoncrest%20Ring\"&gt;Lingering Dragoncrest Ring&lt;/a&gt;, Darkmoon Blade and Sunlight Blade do not.\nWhile Darkmoon Blade and Sunlight Blade scale better with a &lt;a href=\"Talismans\"&gt;Talisman&lt;/a&gt;'s magic adjust, the &lt;a href=\"Tin%20Crystallization%20Catalyst\"&gt;Tin Crystallization Catalyst&lt;/a&gt; is able to provide higher magic adjust than any other talisman, making the Crystal Magic Weapon comparatively more powerful for the same amount of casts. However, if at +1 or higher in the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Darkmoon\"&gt;Blade of the Darkmoon&lt;/a&gt; covenant, the Darkmoon Blade augment gains even higher Faith scaling. Which allows it to outperform Crystal Magic Weapon, even when using the Tin Crystallization Catalyst at max Intelligence (assuming an equivalent level of Faith and use of the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Talisman\"&gt;Darkmoon Talisman&lt;/a&gt;, the strongest available at high Faith).\nDescription.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Official translation=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The sages would thus continue to work on their research within the Grand Archives, even taking &lt;a href=\"Daughter%20of%20Crystal%20Kriemhild\"&gt;Daughter of Crystal Kriemhild&lt;/a&gt; as their pupil and crafting &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Sage%27s%20Rapier\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sage%27s%20Crystal%20Staff\"&gt;casting tools&lt;/a&gt; that used the power of crystals to enhance their magical power, representing how the fruits of the lifetime of research had advanced to an impressive level.\nEventually, in a pact of uncertain terms, one of the Sages joined the &lt;a href=\"Abyss%20Watchers\"&gt;Undead Legion of Farron&lt;/a&gt; to teach them sorceries. As the Legion believed in speed over power, the Crystal Sage created spells that were practical and could be used relatively faster than other sorceries, but required and encouraged the development of specific talent. The daughter of the Legion's lead acolyte, a xanthous scholar named &lt;a href=\"Yellowfinger%20Heysel\"&gt;Heysel&lt;/a&gt;, appeared to have had some of her own sorceries tailored in such a way.\nStrategy.\nThe Crystal Sage spends the first half of the fight teleporting and casting spells. Its spells include Homing Soul Arrow, Heavy Soul Arrow, a homing crystal ball, a rapid fire soul dart, and a mortar-style bombardment. Once down to half health, the Sage will spawn clones each time it teleports. These clones seem to cast the same spells. The clones disappear upon taking any damage and damaging them does not affect the boss' health bar. To tell the clones apart from the boss look at the color of their spells, spells cast by the clones are blue in color whereas those cast by the boss are purple. It is not advisable to block any of the spells, as the stamina drain is large.\nFor melee players, running up to the sage and hitting rapidly is a good strategy. This should interrupt any spells and cause the Sage to teleport. Once the Sage gets to half health and clones, you must either take out the clones very quickly or identify the real Sage to deal damage. The clones only take a single hit to dispatch.\nIt is advisable for melee players to pack &lt;a href=\"Throwing%20Knife%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;throwing knives&lt;/a&gt;, as the clones can be quickly dispatched with single knives. The Crystal Sage is also highly susceptible to &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bleed&lt;/a&gt; damage.\nIt is possible to stagger the sage by using a large weapon (e.g.: ultra greatswords) to stun-lock and take them out before they enters the second phase.\nIt is also possible to use poison or toxic against him. Usually the &lt;a href=\"Storyteller%27s%20Staff\"&gt;Storyteller's Staff&lt;/a&gt; can do the job easily. Simply Use the weapon art, toxic the boss and go sit at the top of the little hill at the right of the arena. Slow way to kill the boss but surely a safe approach on higher NG or when melee is a tricky approach.\nAs the Crystal Sage is vulnerable to &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Flame\"&gt;Sacred Flame&lt;/a&gt; can be used to immediately interrupt its movements. This can be particularly useful for interrupting the Sage's teleporting attempts.\nSummons.\n&lt;a href=\"Eygon%20of%20Carim\"&gt;Eygon of Carim&lt;/a&gt;: If the player speaks to Eygon in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Undead Settlement&lt;/a&gt; after rescuing &lt;a href=\"Irina%20of%20Carim\"&gt;Irina of Carim&lt;/a&gt;, he can be summoned for this fight. In the pillar chamber leading to the arena, his summon sign can be found behind the third pillar on the left."}

It is the longest thrusting sword in the game, providing its wielder with good reach. However, because it deals little &lt;a href=\"physical\"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; damage, it is largely incapable of taking advantage of the &lt;a href=\"Thrust%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Thrust&lt;/a&gt; damage that is the signature of thrusting swords, and thus cannot greatly benefit from counter-hits or from equipping a &lt;a href=\"Leo%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Leo Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne quirk of the Crystal Sage's Rapier is that equipping it will increase the wielder's &lt;a href=\"Item%20Discovery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Item Discovery&lt;/a&gt; by 50 points. Thus it sees common use as a farming aid, improving the odds of getting desired loot through enemy drops."}

It is being worshiped by the citizens of the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Undead Settlement&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nThe Greatwood was once a spirit tree which the residents of the Undead Settlement would use in desperation to seal away the worst of their curses. However, these curses eventually took their toll on the tree, creating this abomination.\nLocation.\nFound in the Undead Settlement, at the end of a big courtyard and surrounded by a multitude of &lt;a href=\"Peasant%20Hollow\"&gt;peasants&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom the Dilapidated Bridge, head into the graveyard where the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Archer%20of%20the%20Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Giant Archer&lt;/a&gt; shoots arrows; enter the house on the opposite end and climb up the stairs to the second floor. Keep following this path until reaching a crumbling church and turn left at the corner to find the courtyard.\nStrategy.\nUpon entering the courtyard, the Greatwood is initially dormant at the far end of the area. Upon awakening, it will attempt to crush the player with its arms and legs whilst also leaking a &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;poisonous&lt;/a&gt; liquid from its underside. It will also bombard the player with the putrid sacs that hang from its branches, filled with decomposing corpses. All of its attacks are well-telegraphed but the most efficient method is dodging. Unlike other bosses, the Greatwood can only be damaged by attacking the growths on its body.\nTo trigger the second phase of the battle, at least one of the growths covering the boss must be destroyed, the easiest one being the growth on its belly. The &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;hollows&lt;/a&gt; will attempt to distract the player but will often be killed by the trees attacks, meaning the hollows can often be ignored in favor of attacking the growths. The boss will smash the floor, dropping the player into the Pit of Hollows. The player will not take any damage but any surviving hollows will perish.\nDuring the second phase, the Greatwood becomes more aggressive and a long, white hand emerges from its front. This hand can perform a powerful grab attack so it is safer to remain at the side of the Greatwood. Some of the growths may be hard to reach with melee weapons, so ranged attacks and spells can be effective. The boss will be stunned once with each growth destroyed, enabling the player to attack its front unmolested or target another growth.\nWhilst risky and a fairly longer process, the player can continue to deal damage to the Greatwood by attacking the hand and the wound in its chest, rather than destroying the growths."}

Once filled, instant &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; occurs, leaving behind a statue, and the player returns to the last &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt; rested at.\nThe player character may become cursed during their death animation if they die of a different cause just before the Curse buildup meter fills. This is most likely to happen while fighting &lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;Seath the Scaleless&lt;/a&gt;, but the timing required is very specific. Wearing a regular &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Sacrifice\"&gt;Ring of Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt; in this situation has absolutely no effect as the death is retroactively considered to be death by Curse by the game.\nEffect.\nThe player's &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; will be reduced to half of its maximum capacity (before bonuses such as from the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Favor%20and%20Protection\"&gt;Ring of Favor and Protection&lt;/a&gt; are figured in) and it becomes impossible to kindle Bonfires or to use &lt;a href=\"Humanity%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;humanity&lt;/a&gt; for reverse &lt;a href=\"hollow\"&gt;hollow&lt;/a&gt;ing. However, cursed players may attack the &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Banshee\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"New%20Londo%20Ruins\"&gt;New Londo Ruins&lt;/a&gt; without having to use a &lt;a href=\"Transient%20Curse\"&gt;Transient Curse&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefense.\nCuring.\nUnlike curing most other &lt;a href=\"negative%20status%20effects\"&gt;negative status effects&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Blessing\"&gt;Divine Blessing&lt;/a&gt; does not cure Curse or its buildup. Equipping a &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Ring%20of%20Sacrifice\"&gt;Rare Ring of Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0while already cursed, then dying will not cure the cursed status either.\u00a0Using a &lt;a href=\"Purging%20Stone\"&gt;Purging Stone&lt;/a&gt; both cures Curse and reduces its buildup to zero. It is also possible to seek out &lt;a href=\"Ingward\"&gt;Ingward&lt;/a&gt;, in the New Londo Ruins, who is able to cure Curse for the cost of one liquid humanity. Ingward will travel to &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt; after speaking to him when the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Kings\"&gt;Four Kings&lt;/a&gt; are defeated, making the curing of Curse that much easier. It is also possible to purchase the &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Curse\"&gt;Resist Curse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;sorcery&lt;/a&gt; from Ingward. This only cures buildup, however. One can additionally raise one's humanity counter, as this moderately increases curse resistance. \nEquipment.\nArmor.\nMost &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; sets offer very little or no Curse Resist at all, especially the &lt;a href=\"Starting%20Armor%20Sets\"&gt;Starting Armor Sets&lt;/a&gt;. However, as the game progresses more become available.\n&lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20Sets%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Light Armor Sets&lt;/a&gt; offer some of the best defense against Curse, most notably the &lt;a href=\"Antiquated%20Set\"&gt;Antiquated Set&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dingy%20Set\"&gt;Dingy Set&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Medium%20Armor%20Sets%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Medium Armor Sets&lt;/a&gt; are typically not a good choice for Curse Resist, however, the &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20Set\"&gt;Paladin Set&lt;/a&gt; offers exceptional resistance to Curse.\n&lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20Sets%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Heavy Armor Sets&lt;/a&gt; offer some of the worst choices, but of them &lt;a href=\"Havel%27s%20Set\"&gt;Havel's Set&lt;/a&gt; offers the highest Curse Resist.\nIndividual armor pieces that have the highest Curse Resist when fully upgraded are the &lt;a href=\"Xanthous%20Crown\"&gt;Xanthous Crown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20Armor\"&gt;Paladin Armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20Gauntlets\"&gt;Gauntlets&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Antiquated%20Skirt\"&gt;Antiquated Skirt&lt;/a&gt;, totaling 226 Curse Resist.\u00a0\nRings.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cursebite%20Ring\"&gt;Cursebite Ring&lt;/a&gt; significantly raises resistance against Curse.\nShields.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bloodshield\"&gt;Bloodshield&lt;/a&gt; is the only shield that offers resistances to negative status effects, and is a good choice when facing enemies that inflict Curse.\nEnemies.\n&lt;a href=\"Enemies\"&gt;Enemies&lt;/a&gt; that inflict Curse are encountered seldom throughout the game, but when they are, care should be taken."}
{"id": "72410", "revid": "49243392", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=72410", "title": "Curse (Dark Souls II)", "text": " \nCurse is a &lt;a href=\"Negative%20Status%20Effects%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;negative status effect&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\". When the player is affected by a source of curse, they will slowly develop curse &lt;a href=\"buildup\"&gt;buildup&lt;/a&gt;, displayed on the screen as a filling bar. When the bar becomes completely filled, the player becomes cursed. &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Phantoms&lt;/a&gt; cannot be cursed. Curse buildup is inflicted by some enemies and hazards.\nEffect.\nOnce the player has been cursed, they will become further &lt;a href=\"hollowed\"&gt;hollowed&lt;/a&gt; by one level, reducing their maximum &lt;a href=\"HP%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; similar to if they had &lt;a href=\"died\"&gt;died&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible to be cursed multiple times, making it a priority to remove or escape the source of curse before it can cause the player to become completely hollowed. After being cursed 10 times, health will be reduced to a maximum of 50%. A curse buildup and cooldown will continue to occur if the player is still exposed to a curse source after being cursed 10 times, but no further penalties will be incurred. The exception to this is if the player has &lt;a href=\"Sin%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Sinned&lt;/a&gt; to the point of becoming a Wretch, in which case they may lose up to 95% of their max health.\nHollowed players may still be &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Invaded&lt;/a&gt; and may still participate in &lt;a href=\"Cooperative%20Gameplay%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Co-op&lt;/a&gt; as a summon. Summoning or invading will be disabled until the player restores their humanity.\nCurse Resist and Immunity.\nA player's innate Curse Resistance is boosted by leveling up both the &lt;a href=\"Attunement\"&gt;Attunement&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adaptability\"&gt;Adaptability&lt;/a&gt; stats, and by certain &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;armors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rings%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;rings&lt;/a&gt; should the player equip them. The &lt;a href=\"Perseverance\"&gt;Perseverance&lt;/a&gt; miracle also gives a temporary boost to Curse resistance. Players always have 100 more curse resistance than what the menu says.\nCurse resistance reduces buildup by 1% per every 10 points.\nWhen a player reaches 900 Curse Resistance (menu value), they become completely immune to Curse.\nBoosting Curse Resist.\nBelow is a list containing some of the best Curse Resistances in the game:\nEnemies.\nThe following enemies have the ability to inflict Curse:"}

As Curse is inflicted repeatedly, the status bar will continue to increase until it fills up, at which point immediate &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; occurs. This is the only instance where the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Sacrifice%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Ring of Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt; cannot prevent the loss of souls upon death.\nSources.\nThe most well known source of this status effect is the &lt;a href=\"Basilisk%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Basilisk&lt;/a&gt;'s cloud breath attack. Additionally, the two &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Accursed\"&gt;Deep Accursed&lt;/a&gt; found in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Cathedral of the Deep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; inflict Curse buildup with every attack. The stationary &lt;a href=\"Pus%20of%20Man\"&gt;Pus of Man&lt;/a&gt; that inhabit the &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Wyvern\"&gt;Wyverns&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;Lothric Castle&lt;/a&gt; can expel Curse-inflicting projectiles from their mouths.\nDuring the battle with the &lt;a href=\"Deacons%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Deacons of the Deep&lt;/a&gt;, one of the attacks in the second phase consists of the deacons conjuring an orb of &lt;a href=\"The%20Deep\"&gt;Deep&lt;/a&gt; energy above Archdeacon Royce's staff, which travels through obstacles and inflicts Curse buildup as well as dealing damage. They can also channel a room-filling fog that gradually builds Curse, which can be interrupted by killing the four deacons that are performing the ritual.\nSome of the books in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt; contain &lt;a href=\"Clawed%20Curse\"&gt;Clawed Curse&lt;/a&gt;s that inflict damage and Curse. By dipping one's head in wax, the player can negate both effects.\nThe third &lt;a href=\"Angel\"&gt;Angel&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"The%20Dreg%20Heap\"&gt;The Dreg Heap&lt;/a&gt; in will cast a beam of light at the player's location if they leave its line of sight while being attacked. The light will rapidly build up Curse but does not track the player after the initial cast, and leaves the Angel motionless for several seconds.\nSeveral petrified &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Cleric\"&gt;Undead Cleric&lt;/a&gt;s within &lt;a href=\"The%20Ringed%20City%20%28location%29\"&gt;the Ringed City&lt;/a&gt; emit an aura which slowly builds up the player's Curse meter if they remain within its vicinity.\nCurse prevention.\nThe following methods can increase resistance to Curse:\nThere is no way to clear Curse buildup, outside of avoiding accumulating more and waiting for the status bar to gradually diminish.

These jars have a large spherical area of effect, allowing them to curse a player even if they are standing either on a floor above or below, coinciding with the respective location of the jar. If the curse meter suddenly starts building up and laughter can be heard, the player should quickly move away from that spot and scout the surroundings to determine the location of the jar."}

It is also the first available greatshield with 100% physical damage block that does not drop randomly from enemies, meaning that it can be obtained without farming.\nTrue to its name, the Curse Ward Greatshield is adept at deflecting &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; damage, and is equally resistant against &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; damage as well. However, its weight to stability ratio is inferior to other greatshields that also provide complete defense against physical damage, and in particular its stability does not improve appreciably when upgraded. This makes the Curse Ward Greatshield a good all-around shield for defending against physical and elemental damage, though inferior when put against more specialized greatshields that have higher individual resistances or increased stability-to-weight ratios.\nThe best property of this shield is that it is one of the few greatshields to allow use of the main hand weapon's &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;. It is also one of only two greatshields to have such a trait and also block 100% of physical damage, the other being the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Knight%27s%20Greatshield\"&gt;Wolf Knight's Greatshield&lt;/a&gt;."}

The room has a wooden bridge that spans across an open area below (there is also a stone bridge above the wooden bridge). The open area below has two exits; one that leads to &lt;a href=\"Sublime%20Bone%20Dust\"&gt;Sublime Bone Dust&lt;/a&gt; and the other that leads to &lt;a href=\"The%20Gutter\"&gt;The Gutter&lt;/a&gt;. At one end of the wooden bridge is a chest (requires a jump to get to) containing the &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Knuckle%20Ring\"&gt;Ash Knuckle Ring&lt;/a&gt;. The Disc Chime is on a ledge near this chest and will require a well-timed jump in order to reach it from this part of the room.\nJumping from the stone bridge (which runs perpendicular to the wooden bridge below) is likely the easiest method of reaching the Disc Chime. The stone bridge can be accessed after defeating the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Rat%20Vanguard\"&gt;Royal Rat Vanguard&lt;/a&gt;, in the Grave of Saints. There is a hole in the floor (past the &lt;a href=\"Rat%20King%20%28character%29\"&gt;Rat King&lt;/a&gt;), with coffins sticking out from the sides of the walls, forming a makeshift staircase, leading down to the stone bridge.\nCharacteristics.\nThe main particularity of this chime is ability to block attacks as it has moderate &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Negative%20Status%20Effects%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt; resistances, while also having a small &lt;a href=\"weight\"&gt;weight&lt;/a&gt;-to-&lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt; ratio that rivals the best stability-oriented &lt;a href=\"Small%20Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;small shields&lt;/a&gt;. Because of its E rating for &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scaling%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt;, it is a poor choice for casting &lt;a href=\"Hexes\"&gt;Hexes&lt;/a&gt;, and thus\u00a0has more potential when used with &lt;a href=\"Miracles%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Miracles&lt;/a&gt;; therefore, &lt;a href=\"infusing\"&gt;infusing&lt;/a&gt; it with &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; is a wise decision, as it bumps the scaling from a B to an A, and it will also boost its ability to block Lightning damage to 90%. \nThis Chime does have its disadvantages however, chief among them the fact that in-game it is considered a chime, and not a &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;. This means that upgrading it will only augment its offensive and casting capabilities, and not its defensive stats. Upgrading the chime, therefore, will not boost its damage resistance stats, nor its stability.\nThis chime has a passive effect to increase damage dealt by miracles by 3%."}

It also adds &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt; to weapons, while reducing &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; scaling. \nThe Divine Auxiliary Effect allows one to prevent &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"The%20Catacombs\"&gt;The Catacombs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Tomb of the Giants&lt;/a&gt; from being resurrected. Without a Divine weapon, they will continually reanimate unless the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; of the area is killed. Weapons with the Divine effect can also cause extra damage to &lt;a href=\"%23Enemies\"&gt;specific enemies&lt;/a&gt;. \nNote that the Divine auxiliary effect, much like &lt;a href=\"Occult%20%28auxiliary%20effect%29\"&gt;Occult&lt;/a&gt;, is NOT a separate damage type like &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;, but rather a multiplier which increases any damage done by a weapon against the aforementioned enemies. For example: A weapon with 200 damage, and a Divine multiplier of 120 will do 1.2x the amount of damage the weapon would've done against regular enemies, and will thus end up dealing 240. [130 -&gt; 1.3x, 140 -&gt; 1.4x, and so on] \nLore.\nDivine weapons are used primarily by &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20White\"&gt;The Way of White&lt;/a&gt; for hunting the &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt;; specifically, the walking &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeletons&lt;/a&gt; animated by &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Nito\"&gt;Gravelord Nito&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancers&lt;/a&gt; which can be found in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Catacombs\"&gt;Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;. When fully upgraded, they are said to be as powerful as the weapons of the &lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;Gods&lt;/a&gt;. Despite most items descriptions claiming that Divine or Blessed weapons are effective against the &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt;, this is exclusively true for the various Skeleton enemies as regular Hollow undead enemies remain unaffected by them, implying a difference between both forms of Undead. \nA possible interpretation of this could be that Divine weapons are used to simply expel necromantic holds from animated bodies, making them useless against the enigmatic &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Curse\"&gt;Undead Curse&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther weapons' item descriptions, such as &lt;a href=\"Grant\"&gt;Grant&lt;/a&gt;, claim to strike harder against the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Soul\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; and its servants, which vaguely implies a connection between the power of necromancy to the power of the Abyss. However only the True &lt;a href=\"Greatsword%20of%20Artorias\"&gt;Greatsword of Artorias&lt;/a&gt; is confirmed to deal extra damage to only the &lt;a href=\"Darkwraith%20%28enemy%29\"&gt;Darkwraith Knights&lt;/a&gt;.\nWeapons.\nThe following is a list of weapons that are innately imbued with the Divine Auxiliary Effect.\nEnemies.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Occult%20%28auxiliary%20effect%29\"&gt;Occult&lt;/a&gt; Auxiliary Effect, the Divine Auxiliary Effect causes weapons to do more damage to specific &lt;a href=\"enemies\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; that are vulnerable to it.\nThere are no bosses in Dark Souls that are weak to the Divine auxiliary effect.

This makes Divine weapons suitable for players that have high Faith, but low Strength and Dexterity.\nDivine weapons cannot be buffed. At high levels of Strength/Dexterity and Faith, a standard weapon enchanted with a &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;miracle&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Blade\"&gt;Sunlight Blade&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Blade\"&gt;Darkmoon Blade&lt;/a&gt; will out-damage Divine weapons in the short run. However, divine weapons hold the advantage of not having to be enchanted to reach their maximum potential.\nThe Divine Auxiliary Effect allows weapons to permanently kill &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"The%20Catacombs\"&gt;The Catacombs&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Tomb of the Giants&lt;/a&gt; without having to kill their &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; masters first.\nThis upgrade path is useless for &lt;a href=\"shields\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt;. A Divine shield + 10 has exactly the same defense as a Normal shield +0. This could be a sign that the upgrade path wasn't completely finished, because one would expect &lt;a href=\"magic%20defense\"&gt;magic defense&lt;/a&gt; to be added. However, the shield will get magic damage that scales with Faith and a divine effect."}

Gray phantoms have to kill the Rat Servant that summoned them or get to the Ordeal's End bonfire room.\nThe 7 Pharros' Contraptions on the bottom floor will open an alternate pathway up, and release a rat, two Gyrm, and a &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Knight\"&gt;Primal Knight&lt;/a&gt;.

On the second floor, the 17 Pharros' Contraptions activate various traps, release enemies, open treasure rooms, and reveal an alternate path. The traps will make traversing the bridges more difficult. Among the enemies released here are a Primal Knight and several Gyrm. A Pharros' Contraption right outside the second floor bonfire room will block the quick route to the bonfire, forcing gray phantoms to take the long way through enemies and traps."}

In the end, the Dragons were nearly\u2014but not fully\u2014driven to extinction, beginning a new era known as the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Age of Fire&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nAge of Ancients.\nIn the Age of Ancients, the world was shrouded by fog, filled with grey crags and arch-trees, and ruled by the immortal Everlasting Dragons. The dragons were unmatched, but eventually, subterranean humanoids would discover &lt;a href=\"Souls%20of%20Lords\"&gt;a great power&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, giving them the means to challenge the dragons. \nLords War.\nWith the birth of the First Flame\u2014the Advent of Fire\u2014the Lords challenged the Dragons for dominion of the world. The war was hard fought, and despite the Lords' new-found power, the Dragons were no easy foe. For every dragon slain, the knights of the lords would lose three score of their own. \nThe tide was turned when &lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;Seath the Scaleless&lt;/a&gt; betrayed his own kind, and sided with the Lords. Seath had been born deformed, and lacked the stone scales that gave his brethren their immortality. He revealed the dragons' greatest weakness; lightning, which could peel apart their stone scales.\n&lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, the Lord of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; used his powerful bolts of lightning to destroy the dragons' scales; the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Witch of Izalith&lt;/a&gt; and her Daughters of Chaos wove great firestorms, burning the Archtrees,\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Nito\"&gt;Nito, the First of the Dead&lt;/a&gt; unleashed a miasma of death and disease.\nThe Lords were successful, and claimed dominion of the world.\nAge of Fire.\nIn the aftermath of the war, The Age of Fire came about, bringing an age of sunlight and prosperity. The Everlasting Dragons were all but extinct, but the race has many descendants throughout the world, some greater and some lesser, with varying degrees of similarity to their progenitors.\nDescription.\nThe Dragons have a few different names throughout the series; Everlasting Dragons, Ancient Dragons, Archdragons, or simply Dragons. From what can be glimpsed in the &lt;a href=\"Opening%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;opening&lt;/a&gt;, the Everlasting Dragons were towering beings with a skin covered both by stone scales and bristly dark fur. Their head sported two straight horns and a mouth bearing two rows of sharp teeth on both jaws. Their back ended in a long and heavy tail but they were still able to fly thanks to their wings (which often came in two pairs), leathery and clawed like the ones of a bat. Appropriately for creatures that lived in a world of fog and penumbra, their two eyes had vertical slotted pupils (this kind of eye is the symbol of both the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Path of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Remnants\"&gt;Dragon Remnants&lt;/a&gt;). Aside from these reptilian features, the Everlasting Dragons' body was a lot less beastial than that of their descendants and kin: their arms didn't end in claws but in four-digited prehensile hands while their torso, broader at the shoulders and thinner at the hips, was almost humanoid in appearance.\nAccording to interviews by Miyazaki, the Ancient Dragons are half-living, half-element, and do not feel pain due to them being \"beyond human understanding\". They are mineral-based lifeforms existing since before humanity's emergence, yet the very emergence of life was capable of corrupting them and causing them to be warped by emotions and desires, to the point where their very bodies adapt and retrogress in pursuit of their survival, such as the &lt;a href=\"Gaping%20Dragon\"&gt;Gaping Dragon&lt;/a&gt; being warped by greed and the desire to eat.\n&lt;a href=\"Seath\"&gt;Seath&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Dragon\"&gt;Stone Dragon&lt;/a&gt; prove that these beings were capable of higher reasoning and could understand other species' language to at least some degree, via their known contributions to the world (the former, Seath, being the founder of &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28element%29\"&gt;soul sorcery&lt;/a&gt;, along with creating the techniques of forging weapons from powerful souls according to &lt;a href=\"Weaponsmith%20Ornifex\"&gt;Weaponsmith Ornifex&lt;/a&gt;).\nIt is common for the tails of Dragons to be cut off and used in the forging of powerful weapons.\nAlthough the Dragons predate souls and originally did not bear them, over time some would come to possess souls of their own such as &lt;a href=\"Sinh%2C%20the%20Slumbering%20Dragon\"&gt;Sinh, the Slumbering Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, even ones that existed and died just after the Age of Ancients such as the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Memories\"&gt;Ancient Dragon&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, dragon bones, when imbued with the power of the soul, can be used as an appropriate &lt;a href=\"Core%20of%20an%20Iron%20Golem\"&gt;core&lt;/a&gt; to powerful constructs like the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt;, who guards Sen's Fortress and slays countless heroes seeking Anor Londo. &lt;a href=\"Petrified%20Dragon%20Bone\"&gt;Petrified Dragon Bone&lt;/a&gt; is said to house great power.\nA &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Tooth\"&gt;Dragon Tooth&lt;/a&gt; from an Everlasting Dragon is considered harder than stone and as solid as a boulder, and stated to never break; &lt;a href=\"Havel%20the%20Rock\"&gt;Havel the Rock&lt;/a&gt; would use one as a great club. Merely holding one will grant the user resistance to both fire and magic, suggesting that the Everlasting Dragons had a similar if greater resistances, in contrast to their weakness to lightning.\nThe Dragons' iconic characteristic, their stone scales that gave them immortality, was implied to have a strong connection with their own form to the point where Dragons and their scales were considered \"inseperable\", though the exact truth of this is undetermined. However, their transcendent apostles, who seek the perpetuity of the ancient dragons, have crossed the very ends of the earth to find them and offer them up to rise above their petty corporeal existence and become Dragons. Touching a Ancient Dragon Scale is said to give a person a glimpse into the Abyss.\nTheir scales are said to be razor-sharp and cannot burn, but are weak to the power of sunlight, which manifests as the rare lightning, which is very effective against magic, fire, as well as those who are resistant to magic and fire, metal armor, and most of all, Dragons. A variant of the lightning spear, the &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning Arrow&lt;/a&gt; miracle, was said to be used by the few female knights who served Gwyn, with which they would pierce the eyes of Dragons from afar. The &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Blacksmith\"&gt;Giant Blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; of the Gods would also forge &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Greatarrow\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt\"&gt;bolts&lt;/a&gt; tipped with &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Pine%20Resin\"&gt;Gold Pine Resin&lt;/a&gt;, a rare type of fungal resin that emits sparks, in order to imbued regular arrows with the power of lightning to help slay Dragons. These were presumably made for those ancient warriors of Gwyn who could not wield &lt;a href=\"Miracles\"&gt;Miracles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Hawkeye%20Gough\"&gt;Hawkeye Gough&lt;/a&gt; and his dragonslayers had their own selection of arrows he used for Dragon hunting that were not imbued with lightning, and &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Arrow\"&gt;giant arrows&lt;/a&gt; could only be fired from a &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Greatbow\"&gt;specialised greatbow&lt;/a&gt;, and with enough power to easily puncture human flesh. Gough himself had a personal bow that not even his Dragonslayers could use, and for which he had his own &lt;a href=\"Gough%27s%20Great%20Arrow\"&gt;great arrows&lt;/a&gt; he crafts himself out of trees and with head tips of stone.\nDespite their scales being what grants them immortality, it is stated that even a descendant of an Archdragon does not perish; &lt;a href=\"Dragonhead%20Shield\"&gt;Dragonhead Shield&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Dragonhead%20Greatshield\"&gt;Dragonhead Greatshield&lt;/a&gt;s, heads as hard as a great boulder and made from descendants of an Archdragon, can even briefly have their former strength restored and be returned to life in order to manifest their abilities.\nThroughout the series as a whole, draconian qualities and covenants are seen by several characters or are mentioned in item descriptions as being believed to be a way for individuals to transcend their current form, who consider human flesh as their greatest weakness and believe that to be alive is to be vulnerable, even if one is a God; thus they seek to rise above \"petty, corporeal existence\" and seek the perpetuity of Dragons. While some sought to amass &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Scale\"&gt;Dragon Scale&lt;/a&gt;s as a path for transcendence, others such as the Drakeblood Knights worshipped the power of the blood of Dragons, and that fresh Dragon's blood was sacrosanct and was what would allow them to gain true understanding of life and transcend their own existence. Their &lt;a href=\"Drakeblood%20Greatsword\"&gt;Drakeblood Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;s would have an insignia chiselled on the hilts and script engraved on the blades that would symbolise dragon's blood and which seemed connected to the swords' ability to inflict both lightning and magic damage, though the specifics are unknown.\nAmong Dragon worshippers, some zealots would take to conducting rituals in order to imbue stones with the power of dragons, but such claims are considered questionable. These stones, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Head%20Stone\"&gt;Dragon Head Stone&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Torso%20Stone\"&gt;Dragon Torso Stone&lt;/a&gt;, would allow the bearer to transform their head and body into an ancient dragon, though such a transformation was incomplete; the bearer would have draconic features but remained humanoid and small in stature without wings. Although they would gain the power of dragons, able to roar like a Dragon and breath fire, they were without the Dragons' immortality and the power they obtained would reverse upon death. A variant of the stones would be created which gifts the bearer the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragon%20Set\"&gt;Black Dragon Set&lt;/a&gt;, armor crafted from the scales of the &lt;a href=\"Kalameet\"&gt;Black Dragon&lt;/a&gt; that is also linked to the power of the stones. Eventually, for those on the path of perfect imitation, &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Head%20Stone%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Torso%20Stone%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stones&lt;/a&gt; would be imbued with the powers of the Everlasting Dragons themselves. This would only be the first step of the rite: offering the stones to a towering dragon would imbue them with even greater power and turn them into &lt;a href=\"Twinkling_Dragon_Torso_Stone\"&gt;Twinkling&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Twinkling%20Dragon%20Head%20Stone\"&gt;Stones&lt;/a&gt; and allow them to summoned a mirage of an Archdragon, the illusion the first case achieved of a human imitating the form of an Ancient Dragon but yet reveals the smallness of human existence. Whether the light and power emitted from the Twinkling Stones has any connection with the cosmic event that granted special power to &lt;a href=\"Twinkling%20Titanite\"&gt;Twinkling Titanite&lt;/a&gt; is unknown.\nIt is still a mystery if the Everlasting Dragons' destructive breath is true fire (as suggested by the Dragon Head Stone) or a flame with arcane properties (like &lt;a href=\"Kalameet\"&gt;Kalameet&lt;/a&gt;'s); however Kalameet's flames are at least partially Dark in regards to game mechanics.\nPlot.\n\"Dark Souls\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt; may encounter many distant descendants and remnants of the Dragons throughout &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oolacile\"&gt;Oolacile&lt;/a&gt;:\nThe fire-breathing &lt;a href=\"Hellkite%20Dragon\"&gt;Hellkite Dragon&lt;/a&gt; encountered in &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Burg\"&gt;Undead Burg&lt;/a&gt; is actually a Drake. Drakes are seen as undeveloped imitators of the dragons, but are likely their distant kin. Drakes are likely descendants of the ancient dragons, and although their strength pales in comparison to the what is described in legend, to mere humans they are still mighty beasts. &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Drake\"&gt;Blue Drake&lt;/a&gt;s,\u00a0who breath lightning instead, may also be of similar origin to the Hellkite Dragon and are found in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Drakes\"&gt;Valley of Drakes&lt;/a&gt;, though what their exact relation to the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Wyvern\"&gt;Ancient Wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s is unknown.\n&lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;s, due to their reptilian appearance, breath attacks, and from dropping Dragon Scales, are implied to also be descendants of the ancient dragons.\nThe area boss of the &lt;a href=\"Depths\"&gt;Depths&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"Gaping%20Dragon\"&gt;Gaping Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, a distant, warped descendant of the Everlasting Dragons.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Lake\"&gt;Ash Lake&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Dragon\"&gt;Stone Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, a descendant of the ancient dragons, initiates the player into the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Path of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Covenant\"&gt;Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Domhnall%20of%20Zena\"&gt;Domhnall of Zena&lt;/a&gt; shares a rumor that the Stone Dragon is not a descendant and is instead, a surviving Ancient Dragon.\n&lt;a href=\"Undead%20Dragon\"&gt;Undead Dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, scattered throughout the land, are corpses of the Ancient Dragons that maintain some spark of life within their rotten form somehow, and can be occasionally stumbled upon as minibosses. They are heavily decomposed, possess no eyes, rotten wings unable to fly, can disgorge a &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Toxic&lt;/a&gt; substance from their mouths, and their hindquarters can easily detach and remain animated by themselves, even capable of standing up by themselves. &lt;a href=\"Bounding%20Demon%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Bounding Demons of Izalith&lt;/a&gt;, due to their resemblance, are inferred to be the bottom halves of Undead Dragons that were bought to life and turned into Demons by the &lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Crossbreed%20Priscilla\"&gt;Crossbreed Priscilla&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariamis\"&gt;Painted World of Ariamis&lt;/a&gt; is the result of the interbreeding of &lt;a href=\"Seath\"&gt;Seath&lt;/a&gt; and a human. \n&lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;Seath the Scaleless&lt;/a&gt;, the albino dragon, allied with Lord Gwyn and turned upon the Ancient Dragons: for this he was awarded Dukedom and given a fragment of a great soul. It is implied he has some connection to the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%20Soldier\"&gt;Serpent Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Serpent%20Mage\"&gt;Serpent Mage&lt;/a&gt;s in his experiments for immortality, though if they have any connection to Dragons is unknown.\nOne-eyed &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragon%20Kalameet\"&gt;Black Dragon Kalameet&lt;/a&gt; may be encountered as an optional boss in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Wood\"&gt;Royal Wood&lt;/a&gt; area of &lt;a href=\"Oolacile\"&gt;Oolacile&lt;/a&gt; and is supposedly the last of the Ancient Dragons. After its defeat, the Black Dragon and its final battle would become mere legend, very rarely mentioned and considered by some to be embellishments of the tale of the &lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;Pale Dragon&lt;/a&gt;. However, proof of it existence would be left in the form of many items made from its body and passed down by Dragon Worshippers: the &lt;a href=\"Calamity%20Ring\"&gt;Calamity&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Calamity%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Ring&lt;/a&gt;, made from and enchanted by Kalameet's orange eye; the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragon%20Armor\"&gt;Black Dragon Armor&lt;/a&gt;, made from its scales; the strangely-shaped &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragon%20Shield\"&gt;Black Dragon Shield&lt;/a&gt;, made from its talons, and several oddly-shaped weapons made from its tail, including a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragon%20Greataxe\"&gt;Greataxe&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragon%20Warpick\"&gt;Warpick&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Greatsword\"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragon%20Sword\"&gt;different&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragon%20Greatsword\"&gt;swords&lt;/a&gt;, one blade of which is still capable of releasing its mystical power when wielded with both hands and unleashing and explosion of the gold and black flames of Kalameet.\n\"Dark Souls II\".\nWyrms(known as Earth Dragons in Japanese) are a type of wingless, two-legged dragon that were once used as mounts by the &lt;a href=\"Dragonrider\"&gt;Dragonrider&lt;/a&gt;s, who helped King &lt;a href=\"Vendrick\"&gt;Vendrick&lt;/a&gt; found &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragonriders served as his royal guard and were feared for their unparalleled strength. Aspiring Dragonriders who could not handle their training were killed by their Wyrms, but those who survived gained deific strength.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Dragon\"&gt;Guardian Dragon&lt;/a&gt; residing in a cage in &lt;a href=\"Aldia%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Aldia's Keep&lt;/a&gt;, is one of Aldia's creations and guards the way to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aerie\"&gt;Dragon Aerie&lt;/a&gt; which is filled with the Dragon's kin. Despite its name, this creature is a wyvern (it has two legs and two wings) and its features are both avian and draconic. Being a creation of Aldia, it is possible that the latter interbred the last surviving drakes with some giant avian creatures in order to create a self-sustaining new race of Dragons.\u00a0\n&lt;a href=\"Giant%20Basilisk\"&gt;Giant Basilisk&lt;/a&gt;s can drop both &lt;a href=\"Petrified%20Dragon%20Bone\"&gt;Petrified Dragon Bone&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Sage%20Hood\"&gt;Dragon Sage Hood&lt;/a&gt;, which implies that they were experiments of Aldia and his followers to imbue &lt;a href=\"Basilisk%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Basilisks&lt;/a&gt; with the great power of the petrified bones.\n&lt;a href=\"Magerold%20of%20Lanafir\"&gt;Magerold of Lanafir&lt;/a&gt; will speculate in dialogue that the &lt;a href=\"Petrified%20Egg\"&gt;Petrified Egg&lt;/a&gt; is a Dragon Egg, and giving him the egg allows a person to join the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Remnants\"&gt;Dragon Remnants&lt;/a&gt; Covenant. Magerold also states that merely holding the egg makes him feel invigorated, but whether that statement is literal or figurative is unclear.\n&lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Undead\"&gt;Enhanced Undead&lt;/a&gt; are some of many of Aldia's experimental creations, and were believed to be an attempt at recreating the Dragons. They are either failed examples or merely the first stage of the mutation into a Dragon, as their bones are formed into the shape of a Dragon. Whether they succeeded or failed, though their bodies seem almost half-dragon, their minds are undoubtedly of a Hollow's. They wield &lt;a href=\"Malformed%20Skull\"&gt;Malformed Skull&lt;/a&gt;s, which are possibly the skulls of Dragons; a specimen far too rare to be swung about like a giant hammer.\nThe corpse of a Dragon can be found in the area in which &lt;a href=\"The%20Duke%27s%20Dear%20Freja\"&gt;The Duke's Dear Freja&lt;/a&gt; is fought, as well as within the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Memories\"&gt;Dragon Memories&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, Freja is suggested to be possessed by a reincarnation of Seath due to dropping the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Paledrake%20Soul\"&gt;Old Paledrake Soul&lt;/a&gt; in NG+, and it can be inferred that its rock-hard shell it developed as it grew from consuming souls is somewhat similar to the scales of the Ancient Dragons.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Dragon\"&gt;Ancient Dragon&lt;/a&gt; residing in the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shrine\"&gt;Dragon Shrine&lt;/a&gt; is said by the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Herald\"&gt;Emerald Herald&lt;/a&gt; to have watched over the world for \"aeons\". However, the veracity of this is doubtful, and he may have been resurrected by &lt;a href=\"Aldia%2C%20Scholar%20of%20the%20First%20Sin\"&gt;Lord Aldia&lt;/a&gt; than a survivor from the War of Fire, since Aldia attempted to recreate the dragons using &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20a%20Giant\"&gt;giant souls&lt;/a&gt;. The former is far more likely as when the Ancient Dragon is slain, the Bearer of the Curse receives a Giant Soul. He gifts the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Mist%20Heart\"&gt;Ashen Mist Heart&lt;/a&gt;, a manifestation of ashen mist whose magic can allow one to delve into the memories of the long-deceased, such as dead Giants and even a Dragon, as well as to pull items and souls from those memories into the real world. Whether this is an actual magic of the Dragons that the Ancient Dragon's body manage to inherit or not is unknown, but it something to be in doubt on since the Ancient Dragon may be a false Dragon.\n&lt;a href=\"Sinh%2C%20the%20Slumbering%20Dragon\"&gt;Sinh, the Slumbering Dragon&lt;/a&gt; is the only true Dragon encountered in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\". He was worshiped in the city of &lt;a href=\"Shulva%2C%20Sanctum%20City\"&gt;Shulva&lt;/a&gt; and was awoken by &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Yorgh\"&gt;Sir Yorgh&lt;/a&gt;, thus leading to his and the city\u2019s demise.\n&lt;a href=\"Imperfect\"&gt;Imperfect&lt;/a&gt;s are eyeless horrors with a giant humanoid mouth and the ability to breath dark spheres. While their appearance is far-removed from a dragon, they drop dragon-related items. The meaning of this is unknown.\n\"Dark Souls III\".\nVery few true Dragons appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;\", if any at all; as even more time separates the events of \"Dark Souls III\" and the Age of Dragons. &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Wyvern\"&gt;Wyverns&lt;/a&gt; appear in &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;Lothric Castle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"High%20Wall%20of%20Lothric\"&gt;High Wall of Lothric&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Wyvern\"&gt;Ancient Wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s reside in &lt;a href=\"Archdragon%20Peak\"&gt;Archdragon Peak&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Wyverns in Lothric Castle are also afflicted with &lt;a href=\"Pus%20of%20Man\"&gt;Pus of Man&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Knights of Lothric, with their Drakes, once crushed anything that threatened their shores, though such a time was long ago. Although the Knights has since tamed Dragons, in the past they contended and were hunters of Dragons themselves, explaining their special gear such as their swords blessed with the strength of lightning and their shields with suitably high lightning absorption. They also utilised &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Urn\"&gt;Lightning Urn&lt;/a&gt;s. Originally crafted in Melfia, a land that flourishes with magic and pyromancy, these explosive lightning urns lack potency, although the Knights still wielded them in their Dragon hunts.\n&lt;a href=\"Oceiros%2C%20the%20Consumed%20King\"&gt;Oceiros, the Consumed King&lt;/a&gt; was formerly the King of Lothric but became obsessed with Seath the Scaleless' work and sought to become more powerful using his royal blood. With the aid of the scholars of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt;, he discovered the research made by &lt;a href=\"Big%20Hat%20Logan\"&gt;Logan&lt;/a&gt;, who in turn was inspired by Seath. Much like Logan, Oceiros was driven insane by the work of the paledrake and somehow transformed into a malformed abomination reminiscent to that of Seath. He has survived many assassination attempts, which he claims is due to the divine protection of the dragon scale.\n&lt;a href=\"Archdragon%20Peak\"&gt;Archdragon Peak&lt;/a&gt; is a location accessed through the 'path of the dragon' &lt;a href=\"Gestures%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;gesture&lt;/a&gt; found behind the location where Oceiros is fought. The enemies there are adherents to the Path of the Dragon, most likely based on the covenant from \"Dark Souls\". Various sizes of these &lt;a href=\"Man%20Serpent\"&gt;man-serpent&lt;/a&gt; hybrids appear, wielding various weapons such as axes on chains, daggers and spears. Man-serpents are said to be descendants of the Ancient Dragons and have lingering, undying traces of them, though they have fallen far from grace. The &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Wyvern\"&gt;Ancient Wyvern&lt;/a&gt; is also fought here.\n&lt;a href=\"Company%20Captain%20Yorshka\"&gt;Company Captain Yorshka&lt;/a&gt; seems to be a dragon crossbreed similar to Priscilla. She has scale-like markings around her eyes, and a tail not unlike that of a dragon's.\nStoneplates are symbols of true knights, and &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Stoneplate%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;yellow stoneplate rings&lt;/a&gt; which boosts defence against lightning and absorbing lightning damage are given those who would become Dragons.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wretch\"&gt;Wretch&lt;/a&gt;es found in Irithyll dungeon are a twisted hybrid of a human and dragon who were left in the dungeon to rot, possibly due to being failed experiments. Wielding &lt;a href=\"Tailbone%20Short%20Sword\"&gt;Tailbone Short Sword&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Tailbone%20Spear\"&gt;Tailbone Spear&lt;/a&gt;s crafted from feeble tailbone, these weapons are seen as a sign of the dragons. These weapons can unleash the strength of dragons, similar to an ancient dragon weapon, only with its power tragically faded. Using magic, they can call upon damaging blasts of stormy wind either as a cyclone from the spear or a line of explosive wind that trails across the ground.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Painter\"&gt;The young painter&lt;/a&gt; found in the library in the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Painted World of Ariandel&lt;/a&gt; may be a crossbreed as well, as she appears to have scales on her feet and face, although she is lacking a tail.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Millwood%20Knight\"&gt;Millwood Knight&lt;/a&gt;s, guardians of the Ethereal Oak and the fabled Millwood forest, are said to be enemies of \"the &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt; Dragon\". Wearing &lt;a href=\"Millwood%20Knight%20Helm\"&gt;antlers&lt;/a&gt; believed to grow from the blessed beast of the Ethereal Oak, fighting hand-in-hand with the earth itself using &lt;a href=\"Quakestone%20Hammer\"&gt;hammers with heads of naturally-formed stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Millwood%20Battle%20Axe\"&gt;blessed axes&lt;/a&gt; wielded by their mightiest warriors, and with &lt;a href=\"Millwood%20Greatbow\"&gt;greatbows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Millwood%20Greatarrow\"&gt;heavy arrows&lt;/a&gt; made from black oak, they did battle with the Dragon. However, when the forest was discovered, it had become a vacant ruin and the Ethereal Oak left rotten, while the Millwood Knights had disappeared, their corpses missing and their belongings laying neatly on the ground.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Nameless%20King\"&gt;The Nameless King&lt;/a&gt; is referenced to have sided with the Dragons and is speculated to be the first-born son of &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn&lt;/a&gt;, indicated by several descriptions on weapons and his boss soul. He is referenced as a dragon-slaying god of war who sacrificed everything to side with the Dragons, and Gwyn's first-born son is said to have been stripped of his stature as punishment for his foolishness and effectively removed from history as a result of that. When encountered, he is riding a Stormdrake, named King of the Storm.\n&lt;a href=\"Darkeater%20Midir\"&gt;Darkeater Midir&lt;/a&gt; is the only remaining archdragon encountered in \"Dark Souls III\" who is still alive. Raised by the Gods of Lordran themselves to combat the growing &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt;, Midir's everlasting battle against the darkness has taken its toll on him, and he is slowly being consumed by the dark's influence. Fearing that the darkness within him may drive him mad, the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20One\"&gt;Ashen One&lt;/a&gt; is tasked by &lt;a href=\"Shira\"&gt;Shira&lt;/a&gt; to put him down before he loses himself.\nDragons.\nKnown Dragons, descendants of Dragons and results of experiments, interbreeding with humans, or evolution."}

They don the golden version of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragon%20Set\"&gt;Black Dragon Set&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nThe Dragon Knights were a seclusive syndicate of warriors that donned armor inspired by the &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, who they held a great esteem towards. Some knights used the scales and tail of the \"Black Dragon,\" which might be the deceased &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragon%20Kalameet\"&gt;Black Dragon Kalameet&lt;/a&gt;, to forge their armor and weapons.\nStrategy.\nThese foes can dual wield, though their attack speed isn't that impressive.

However, they will become hostile if the player attempts to run past them without defeating the challenger, or by attacking the Dragon Knights themselves (this also applies to beneficial spells like &lt;a href=\"Warmth\"&gt;Warmth&lt;/a&gt;).

He wore a &lt;a href=\"Ornstein%27s%20Set\"&gt;golden armor&lt;/a&gt; made to resemble a lion and wielded a &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Spear\"&gt;great cross spear&lt;/a&gt; so strong that it was able to bury itself deep within a dragon's hide, piercing their stone scales, and sending mere human flying. Both his armor and his weapon were imbued with the power of &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; to be effective against dragons.\nDuring the war against the dragons Ornstein fought valiantly together with &lt;a href=\"The%20Nameless%20King\"&gt;Gwyn's firstborn son&lt;/a&gt;, obtaining the title of \"Dragon Slayer Knight\" and becoming one of Gwyn's most trusted knights. Once his Lord won the war, exterminating the ancient dragons and conquering the world, Ornstein, along with &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Artorias\"&gt;Artorias&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lord%27s%20Blade%20Ciaran\"&gt;Ciaran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hawkeye%20Gough\"&gt;Gough&lt;/a&gt;, became part of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Knights%20of%20Gwyn\"&gt;Four Knights of Gwyn&lt;/a&gt; as their captain. As a symbol of his association with the order he gained a &lt;a href=\"Leo%20Ring\"&gt;magical ring with the lion symbol&lt;/a&gt;, which strengthened counter attacks with thrust weapons, making his fighting style with his cross spear more effective.\nOrnstein, as his companion during the war, would also become the first knight of Gwyn's firstborn son and the &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Oath%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;story of the battles&lt;/a&gt; of Gwyn's firstborn son, Ornstein, and the brave dragonslayers in their service would become the fighting miracle taught to the &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Warrior of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt;, a group of knights that had joined in covenant with the god of war and heir of Gwyn.\nAt some point after Gwyn linked the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Nameless%20King\"&gt;Gwyn's firstborn son&lt;/a&gt; was dethroned and exiled nearly all of the deities abandoned Anor Londo together and moved to an unknown location but Ornstein remained in the forsaken city alongisde &lt;a href=\"Executioner%20Smough\"&gt;Executioner Smough&lt;/a&gt; to guard the cathedral where &lt;a href=\"Gwynevere%2C%20Princess%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Gwynevere&lt;/a&gt; resided.\nTogether, these two powerful warriors would become the last ritual challenge for the potential &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, the Undead who tried to follow in Gwyn's footsteps to sacrifice themselves to the Flame would have to be tested even before obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Lordvessel\"&gt;Lordvessel&lt;/a&gt; and seeking powerful souls. Ringing the &lt;a href=\"Bells%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Bells of Awakening&lt;/a&gt; represents only the first of these challenges, and success means gaining access to &lt;a href=\"Sen%27s%20Fortress\"&gt;Sen's Fortress&lt;/a&gt; to be tested further. The Undead who manage to overcome the tests and dangers of the fortress and defeat the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt; would manage to access the city of the gods. Once they managed to enter the cathedral of Anor Londo to try to obtain the Lordvessel they would still be challenged by Ornstein and Smough, to ensure that only the strongest of the strongest Undead could have an audience with Gwynevere.\nHowever, after centuries of waiting for the Chosen Undead without success, Ornstein grew tired of his duty and left the cathedral and his companion in search of the Nameless King, while leaving also behind the &lt;a href=\"Leo%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt; that symbolized his membership in the four knights of Gwyn. Ornstein's ring was thus preserved as an relic by &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Dark Sun Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt; and protected in his manor when &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt; rose from the ruins of Anor Londo."}

His summon sign can be found on top of a small platform connected to the stairs to the left, when facing the &lt;a href=\"Fog%20Door\"&gt;fog door&lt;/a&gt; (the platform below the archer knight).\nIf he starts the encounter at full health, Solaire can generally solo one of the bosses, as long as he's not attacked by the other (i.e., if the player keeps the other boss busy). This can make it harder to ensure a specific kill order (necessary to determine the final loot, as described &lt;a href=\"%23Drops\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;), as there is no way for the player to tell Solaire to stop attacking a specific boss.\nFirst Phase: Ornstein and Smough.\nThe player must fight both at the same time. When one is killed, the other absorbs some of his power, receiving an &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;, damage, and resistance boost, and healing back to 100%. He will also take on a physical characteristic of his fallen comrade: Ornstein grows in size while Smough is imbued with lightning.\nHaving a summoned &lt;a href=\"phantom\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt; can make the fight significantly easier, as it allows the bosses to be fought separately. Note, however, that there's no advantage in damaging both bosses during the first phase (as mentioned above, the surviving boss' HP goes back to 100% when the second phase begins). The role of the second player is simply to keep one of the bosses busy while the other is killed.\nWhen fighting alone, one of the safest strategies is to kite the bosses around the outside of the room, keeping both in view and using the pillars to block their charging attacks while whittling them down with hit-and-run tactics. As Ornstein is the faster of the pair, he will usually be able to catch up to the player quickly. The player can then choose to focus down Ornstein while Smough attempts to navigate around the pillars, or double back to Smough after getting Ornstein away from him and using the short window of separation to attack him before Ornstein returns.\nOrnstein's moveset consists largely of dashing and thrusting attacks, meaning that dodging to his sides is more effective than attempting to roll away. He is faster and more nimble though, so he can also be harder to hit. As well, he can issue &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; blasts from his spear at range, making him a serious threat at any distance.\nSmough is the tougher of the two, his hammer is capable of dealing tremendous damage should it connect. Because the hitbox is centered on the head of the hammer, it is best to dodge towards or away from him, as getting within the arc of his hammer's horizontal swings can cause them to miss entirely. Beware, as he also has a dangerous charge attack that he can use if the player is not within striking distance of his hammer.\nKilling Ornstein first is generally regarded as making the encounter easier to win, since Smough has more weaknesses and is slower than his partner in the second phase. However, killing Smough first will yield the &lt;a href=\"Leo%20Ring\"&gt;Leo Ring&lt;/a&gt;, which is a useful ring for certain builds.\nFor melee builds, using a weapon with good reach (such as a spear, halberd or a sword with a fast thrusting attack) will make it significantly easier to hit the bosses when they are near a pillar. Note that both bosses can hit through the pillars with some of their attacks.\nRanged builds using the pillars to control the movement of the bosses should note that not all pillars are the same height; some will block projectiles while others will not.\nSecond Phase 1: Lightning Smough.\nIf Ornstein is defeated first, Smough will gain &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; attacks with his hammer, though his moveset does not change appreciably. He is still quite slow and his attacks are still horizontally focused, so dodging in and out is still a sound strategy. Be wary of his Banzai Drop in this phase, as it creates a Lightning explosion upon impact, dealing damage in a large area around him.\nSecond Phase 2: Super Ornstein.\nIf Smough is defeated first, Ornstein will increase greatly in size, drastically changing his moveset in the process. The key to defeating Super Ornstein is to keep in mind that while he has absorbed Smough's strengths, he has also inherited his weaknesses: Super Ornstein is much slower, and has trouble navigating around pillars. Like other large bosses, he also has trouble hitting enemies that are directly under him, though his Lightning Banzai Drop helps to counteract this. Try to stay extremely close to Super Ornstein and attack his legs, dodging out when he performs the Lightning Banzai Drop.\nBoss information.\nOrnstein.\nSwinging Combo.\nOrnstein swings his spear up to four times in a row. This attack can be blocked, and generally offers a good chance to counter-attack.\nJumping Attack.\nOrnstein jumps up, and then either stabs at the player, or smashes his spear into the ground where the player is standing. Both deal the same amount of damage, and can be blocked.\nCharging Spear.\nOrnstein glides towards the player, and then stabs with his spear. The attack can be blocked or dodged, and a counterattack is possible to achieve. Note that this attack can (rarely) cause Ornstein to move through a pillar.\nLightning Spear Charge.\nRare attack that is identical to Charging Spear, except Ornstein imbues his spear with lightning before charging.\nLightning Banzai Drop.\nOnly used if Smough was killed first. Ornstein jumps up, pauses mid-air, then falls onto the ground, causing a wide lightning field created from the point of impact. This cannot be fully blocked, and can only be dodged by keeping one's distance. Smough's distinct laughter can be heard during this attack.\nQuick Lightning Spear.\nOrnstein uses his weapon's power to shoot a small burst of lightning at the player. This attack is rarely used.\nHeavy Lightning Spear.\nOrnstein charges up a lightning bolt that he fires at the player. This Lightning Bolt is unusually slow once fired and has strong homing capabilities.\nLightning Impale.\nIn Ornstein's large form, he will charge his spear with lightning, and then lunge at the player in a quick stabbing motion. If this attack connects, Ornstein will raise the player and release the charged lightning, dealing huge amounts of damage.\nSmough.\nJoust.\nSmough charges at the player with his hammer, then swings it upwards diagonally when he reaches the player. This deals heavy damage, especially when in lightning form. It can be avoided by running directly away or with the right dodging speed. Blocking will break the player's guard if they are using a shield of inadequate stability. While pillars will block Smough's movement, the hammer itself will go through the pillar.\nSwing.\nSmough swings his weapon. It is possible to &lt;a href=\"Rolling\"&gt;roll&lt;/a&gt; under this attack and start attacking before Smough has time to recover. Blocking this attack may use a large amount of &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%29%23Stamina\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;. May follow up with a second swing.\nSmash.\nSmough slowly raises his weapon and then hammers the ground in front of him. This attack can go through pillars. May follow up with a swing.\nJumping Hammer.\nSmough jumps into the air and then hammers the ground as close to the player as he can get. This can be avoided by rolling in any direction while Smough is airborne.\nBanzai Drop.\nSmough jumps into the air and then crashes into the ground below. Smough takes a while to recover after using this attack. When in his more powerful form, there is a lightning area of effect upon landing.

{"id": "44568", "revid": "49243392", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=44568", "title": "Dragonrider", "text": "The Dragonrider is a &lt;a href=\"Boss%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\nThe Dragonrider is clad in heavy red or black armor. He is large and physically imposing.\nLore.\nThe Dragonriders used to serve in &lt;a href=\"Vendrick\"&gt;King Vendrick's&lt;/a&gt; royal guard long ago. These riders mounted wyverns and caused chaos on the battlefield due to their unparalleled strength.\u00a0The rank of Dragonrider was reserved for honorable warriors who helped found &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt;. Together with the King, they crushed the land's former inhabitants and erected a magnificent kingdom upon their graves.\nThose wishing to\u00a0join the ranks of the Dragonriders were forced to undergo intense and dangerous training. Only those who passed\u00a0the training were allowed in the order, those who failed would be ripped apart by the very mounts they tried to command.\nStrategy.\n&lt;a href=\"Heide%27s%20Tower%20of%20Flame\"&gt;Heide's Tower of Flame&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonrider possesses a highly predictable attack pattern, consisting of mostly mid-ranged attacks, with the biggest threat being falling off the edge of the circular arena, a threat essentially eliminated if the guarded levers found earlier in the level are pulled. Dodging the attacks give players ample time to counter-attack. Blocking may prove useful, although good timing allows &lt;a href=\"rolling\"&gt;rolling&lt;/a&gt; through its slow attacks. Circling around it is also highly effective.\n&lt;a href=\"Masterless%20Glencour\"&gt;Masterless Glencour&lt;/a&gt; can also be summoned from a sign just to the right of the fog gate. He is a powerful tank wielding a &lt;a href=\"Zweihander%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Zweihander&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Parma\"&gt;Iron Parma&lt;/a&gt;, and is capable of &lt;a href=\"Parry%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;parrying&lt;/a&gt; the Dragonrider. In , &lt;a href=\"Devotee%20Scarlett\"&gt;Devotee Scarlett&lt;/a&gt; can be found past the three\u00a0Old Knights\u00a0near the second lever, in the direction of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Old%20Dragonslayer\"&gt;Old Dragonslayer&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the stone bridge after the third Old Knight, there is a spot where it is possible to shoot the Dragonrider from outside the arena. After taking a certain amount of damage, it will raise its shield, preventing any further damage. The player can then enter the arena to fight the Dragonrider, who should now be at very low &lt;a href=\"HP%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is also possible to exploit the AI by standing close to the Dragonrider's back. This causes it to attack as if the player was standing in front of it, thus allowing easy damage to be dealt.\nThe Dragonrider will be instantly killed if it falls off the arena. This can be used to the player's advantage, if they can time their dodge correctly. Without raising the arena rings from the water, one can simply wait by the fog door. By rolling at the right time, the Dragonrider will swing, and fall into the water, allowing for a quick victory, although it can be risky if not practiced.\n&lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Castle\"&gt;Drangleic Castle&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo Dragonriders are fought at once in this encounter. The first Dragonrider will be engaging the player in melee combat while the second fires at the player from above with a &lt;a href=\"Dragonrider%20Bow\"&gt;greatbow&lt;/a&gt;. Once the first Dragonrider is down to roughly half health, the second one will come down. It is a good idea to quickly eliminate one of them to minimize the amount of time spent fighting two-on-one. The second Dragonrider has much less Health than the first, and may prove easier to dispatch. Once one is defeated, the fight becomes very similar to the original fight in Heide's Tower of Flame, without the risk of falling off the stage.\nIf the archer proves to be too much of a nuisance, players can take it down with ranged attacks of their own. Care should be taken if this is done as being hit by the first Dragonrider can be fatal.\nAlternatively, one can wait by the pillar where the second Dragonrider is perched. The Dragonrider on the floor will attack the pillar, breaking it and causing the second Dragonrider to fall down earlier. If this happens; the second Dragonrider won't change weapons, preferring to fire the bow until it is defeated.\nIn , the summon sign for &lt;a href=\"Pilgrim%20Bellclaire\"&gt;Pilgrim Bellclaire&lt;/a&gt; is available just outside the entrance to the boss arena.\nAttacks.\nThroughout the boss fight, the attack combos get longer as the Dragonrider's health decreases. There are three different phases (start, middle, and near-end of fight) to the attack patterns based on its health, and the new attacks simply combo after the previous ones. Most of the new attacks are simply extra horizontal swings with a few exceptions. Like most enemies, the combos are only performed if the player is still in range of the attacks.\nThe Dragonrider has two main defensive moves: One is to sprint a short distance to get some space between itself and the player; the other is to simply raise its shield for a short period of time. Blocking is often done after a dash.\nDefenses.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense. -20% strike means taking 120% damage.&lt;br&gt;Physical defense is 338 in &lt;a href=\"Heide%27s%20Tower%20of%20Flame\"&gt;Heide's Tower of Flame&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Amana\"&gt;Shrine of Amana&lt;/a&gt;. Physical Defense is 502 in Twin Dragonriders Boss fight.

It has the second-highest strength &lt;a href=\"Scaling%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt; of any ranged weapon available, losing only to the &lt;a href=\"Twin-headed%20Greatbow\"&gt;Twin-headed Greatbow&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn top of its &lt;a href=\"physical%20damage\"&gt;physical damage&lt;/a&gt;, it also has an appreciable amount of &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; damage and can deal exceptional damage if a &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"infusion\"&gt;infusion&lt;/a&gt; is applied to it. On top of the high magic damage, the physical damage penalty is much lower than most weapons.\nHowever, it consumes much more &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; than other bows, making it less effective if multiple arrows have to be shot in quick succession. At three units, it is also the heaviest bow available.\nThe Dragonrider Bow's high damage potential can even make it deal more damage-per-shot than some &lt;a href=\"greatbows\"&gt;greatbows&lt;/a&gt;, for less than a quarter of the &lt;a href=\"weight\"&gt;weight&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nDue to its high stamina consumption per shot, usually no more than two or three arrows can be shot in succession. The time taken from the moment the string is being tensed to when the arrow is launched is considerably longer compared to most other bows in the game; however, because of the high amount of damage dealt, most enemies will fall in just two or three shots.\nThe player must think it well before deciding to infuse this bow with &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to maximize the weapon's innate magical damage output, since many of the enemies in the game which use ranged attacks are magic-wielders who have a natural resistance against this element (&lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Mage\"&gt;Hollow Mage&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Amana%20Shrine%20Maiden\"&gt;Shrine Maidens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20Priestess\"&gt;Sanctum Priestess&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"Fume%20Sorcerer\"&gt;Fume Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s, etc.), making the infusion actually unfavorable to fight against them, as it will deal less damage to them. Other enemies will receive more damage but just slightly, which may not make it worth infusing this weapon after all."}

Climb up the two sets of ladders nearby, turn around and drop to a small niche on the right wall with a corpse holding the bow.\nCharacteristics.\nThe heaviest bow in the game, the Dragonrider Bow is a powerhouse that is capable of landing highly damaging arrows on its targets. It possesses the highest base damage of all bows, meaning that it benefits especially well from &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt;. However, it also ties with the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Bow%20of%20Pharis%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Black Bow of Pharis&lt;/a&gt; for costing the most stamina per arrow fired, so the wielder must make every shot count.\nCompared to the &lt;a href=\"Longbow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Longbow&lt;/a&gt;, it has the same range but scales better with &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the day though, it is still restricted to being best used by quality builds, as like other bows it cannot take advantage of &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt; past 40 in either stat. Whereas the Longbow is better suited to harassing or aggro-ing targets from range, the Dragonrider Bow, with its heavier weight and beefier stat requirements, is better suited to dealing powerful ranged damage to actually kill targets.\nUpgrades.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

Its pseudo-low requirements (can be two-handed with 22 &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; and as little as 10 &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;), as well as respectable &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;magical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scaling%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt; bonus coupled with an appreciable amount of &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt; damage, make it quite powerful in the right hands.\nMuch like the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Iron%20Twinblade\"&gt;Red Iron Twinblade&lt;/a&gt; and the Stone Twinblade, the Dragonrider Twinblade is one of the stronger twinblades obtainable in the game; the attribute scaling is unremarkable at first, but it later performs much better once it is fully-reinforced, especially with high investments in Dexterity and &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;.

It is controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Pilgrim%20Butterfly\"&gt;Pilgrim Butterflies&lt;/a&gt; that soar high above &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;Lothric Castle&lt;/a&gt; and guard the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt;. It wields a &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Greatshield\"&gt;gigantic shield&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Greataxe\"&gt;greataxe infused with lightning&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nThe Dragonslayer Armor is what remains of an ancient warrior belonging to the most remote times in the history of the &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;kingdom of Lothric&lt;/a&gt;. During this time the soldiers of the Lothric army found themselves facing large numbers of &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Wyvern\"&gt;wyverns&lt;/a&gt; and had to become more than normal knights. Thus their &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Armour\"&gt;first armors&lt;/a&gt; were crafted to fight the dangerous creatures rather than other humans. They were heavy masses of iron capable of withstanding dragon fire and similar in design to the &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Set\"&gt;ancient armor&lt;/a&gt; of the dragonslayers of Anor Londo while their shields were capable of absorbing the high lightning emission of wyverns. The old knights of Lothric turned to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Nameless%20King\"&gt;Firstborn of Lord Gwyn&lt;/a&gt;, once venerated as a god of war and the sun, and built an &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20of%20Sunlight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;altar&lt;/a&gt; for him inside their city, beginning to worship the ancient deity who in return gave them the tools to face the wyverns. From the sun god they would how to infuse their &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Greataxe\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; with the power of lightning, lethal against dragons, and the ancient techniques for hunting archdragons developed in the war between the gods and the Everlasting Dragons. \nArmed and protected to counter the wyverns, the dragonslayers of Lothric devoted themselves to the &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20of%20Sunlight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;covenant of the sun god&lt;/a&gt; and finally learned to use his &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lightning%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt; which allowed them to manipulate the power of lightning as if it was their own. The army of Lothric thus successfully hunted the wyverns that resided in their region and they even learned how to tame and ride them, thus gaining a terrifying arsenal and advantage over other human armies. Thanks to their support of the royal family the knights were granted permission to befriend the &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Wyvern\"&gt;wyverns&lt;/a&gt; and even keep them in their barracks inside the city, as the creatures would became part of their army and rode into battle, leading the knights and their dragons to become the symbols of Lothric. \nAs the dragonslayer's reason for existence was lost when the wyverns became domesticated by Lothric's knights and the kingdom's main enemies became other human knights, the army's weapons and armor changed accordingly. The armor of an ancient Dragonslayer, however, remained in the barracks of the Lothric army, after the temple of Lord Gwyn's Firstborn and before the Grand Archives and the Royal Castle, becoming a monument to the legendary past of the kingdom's knights.\nDuring the last days of Lothric kingdom, when the First Flame was at the limit of its strength, the sun itself above Lothric would have weakened, transforming into an dark eclipse barely contained by the remnants of light at its contours.\nInside the city flocks of &lt;a href=\"Pilgrim%20Butterfly\"&gt;Pilgrim Butterflies&lt;/a&gt; would manifest, gigantic humanoid insects. These beings with immense branch-like wings would infest the skies of the dying kingdom, migrating towards the tip of the Castle and they would take control of the Dragonslayer Armour through their dark magicusing it as a puppet to eliminate anyone who attempted to proceed to the top of the castle.\nLocation.\nFound on the highest level of &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;Lothric Castle&lt;/a&gt;, along the path that leads to the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt;.\nFight overview.\nStrategy.\nThe Dragonslayer Armour uses attacks that are characterized by gulf swings and occasional overhead attacks. It deals large amounts of damage to any character regardless of their resistances. The best tactic for dealing with this boss is to constantly roll away from its attacks and land one of your own. It also deals a huge amount of &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; damage if you try blocking.\nIt is essential when fighting this boss to remain under 70% &lt;a href=\"Equip%20Load\"&gt;Equip Load&lt;/a&gt; so that you can roll at a fast pace. Since the fight will be characterized by dodging, it would be advisable to not be overencumbered and have a slow pace roll.\nThe boss uses its &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Greataxe\"&gt;greataxe&lt;/a&gt; for overhead chops and wide gulf swings, but it will use its &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Greatshield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; with startling speed to break your defense. In the second stage of the fight, it will use shield combos or use its shield before its greataxe.\nWhen fighting this boss, it is necessary to remember not to get greedy with attacks and to have a faster roll speed."}

However, the &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt; scaling is relatively sub-par, so the weapon is still best utilized on pure Strength builds.\nThe Dragonslayer's Greataxe has very impressive damage output, making it a powerful weapon for felling normal enemies and &lt;a href=\"Boss%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt; alike. As a weapon in the greataxe class, it can deal significant &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; damage to foes, ensuring that any hit that does not kill will still have a high chance of &lt;a href=\"stagger\"&gt;stagger&lt;/a&gt;ing.\nIf this wasn't enough, the Dragonslayer Greataxe's unique &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falling%20Bolt%20%28Dragonslayer%20Greataxe%29\"&gt;Falling Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, is also one of the most destructive ones in the game.

This greatbow also consumes a very large amount of &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; per shot, meaning most players may only get one effective shot fired before low stamina penalties begin to occur on the successive attacks.\nUnique only to this greatbow and its &lt;a href=\"Twin-headed%20Greatbow\"&gt;Lanafir cousin&lt;/a&gt; is that it has a stabilizing anchor on the bottom, meaning that one must anchor the bow in the ground before pulling back the string, thus making it fire at an incredibly slow rate. This can be mitigated if the player takes their time and avoids enemy engagement at close range, allowing them to effectively snipe enemies for high damage at longer ranges.\nIt requires &lt;a href=\"Petrified%20Dragon%20Bone\"&gt;Petrified Dragon Bone&lt;/a&gt;s in order to be upgraded, and the scaling does not change at maximum reinforcement."}

However, once an arrow is loosed, it will inflict extreme damage on any enemy it hits, as well as knocking them down (provided that &lt;a href=\"Onislayer%20Greatarrow\"&gt;Onislayer Greatarrow&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Millwood%20Greatarrow\"&gt;Millwood Greatarrow&lt;/a&gt;s are not used). As such, this weapon is designed to be used strategically, attacking foes from a distance where they cannot easily run down the wielder while they are vulnerable.\nCare should be taken when lining up repeated shots from the same position, as the recoil from each greatarrow will push the wielder backwards slightly. This means that it will be necessary to occasionally re-position to prevent terrain from obscuring subsequent shots.\nUpgrades.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

As protection worn by one who harnessed the power of lightning to slay fire-breathing dragons, its elemental defenses are also very sound, being equally resistant against &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage, though as armor worn by a servant to the divinity it is also particularly weak to &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; damage. Its resistance to &lt;a href=\"Negative%20Status%20Effects%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;status effects&lt;/a&gt; is very sound across the board, being particularly resistant to &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt; buildup.\nAs with all other heavy armor sets, the Dragonslayer Set provides a strong &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt;-to-weight ratio, though it should be noted that as &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Ornstein's spear&lt;/a&gt; does not possess any &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt; frames in \"Dark Souls III\", it is of little help except when wielding heavier weapons."}

It's also the only weapon in the game with scaling Lightning damage.\nThe special lightning bolt projectile is calculated like any attack using the weapon's Physical and Lightning AR and the attack specific Motion Values (100 Physical, 110 Lightning). It has a range of approximately 28 in-game units, suffers from damage drop off at long ranges and does not benefit from the Hawk Ring. This special attack degrades 20 Durability.\nAn easy way to obtain the Dragonslayer Spear is to downgrade the Lightning Spear dropped by the Mimic in Sen's Fortress to a +10 Spear, and then upgrading it to the Dragonslayer Spear. However, a +5 Dragonslayer Spear will not significantly outperform a +5 Lightning Spear at lower Faith levels (~16 or below) until the user well exceeds the required levels in Strength or Dexterity. A fully-upgraded &lt;a href=\"Demon%27s%20Spear\"&gt;Demon's Spear&lt;/a&gt; also has a higher overall damage rating at low Faith levels, and deals more Lightning damage at Faith levels of 42 and below. This weapon cannot be &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Augmentation\"&gt;Enchanted&lt;/a&gt; and almost any buffable weapon of any class will out-perform this Spear in terms of damage potential. "}

Choosing between the weak and strong attacks allows the wielder to perform both types of attacks, regardless of one-handing or two-handing the weapon.\nThe Dragonslayer Swordspear also requires a particular set of stats to wield effectively. Despite having respectable &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt;, the base &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage is rather lackluster, negating any Faith invested. However, this Lightning damage can be augmented by performing its &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;, launching a bolt at a distant target while buffing the weapon. This, combined with its moderate physical scaling, makes the Swordspear best suited for quality builds that invest points into Faith for utility &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Miracles&lt;/a&gt;, and less so for high Faith builds that invest little into &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, the Dragonslayer Swordspear's most interesting quirk is that it is the only spear in the game with &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that unlike its brethren it can take advantage of &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;. Caution should be exercised though, as it still has the weakest Poise health out of all weapons in the game, placing it below halberds."}
{"id": "2415", "revid": "56333033", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2415", "title": "Drake Sword", "text": "The Drake Sword is a &lt;a href=\"Straight%20Swords%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;straight sword&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAvailability.\nThe Drake Sword is obtainable in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Parish\"&gt;Undead Parish&lt;/a&gt;. To obtain the sword, the player must deal 240 damage when in the base game cycle to the &lt;a href=\"Hellkite%20Dragon\"&gt;Hellkite Dragon&lt;/a&gt;'s tail to sever it, placing the sword in their inventory. One method of doing this is to stand on the right side of the bridge under the drake and shoot its tail with a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;. Another method is to simply wait for the dragon to land, run to the right side and attack the tail a few times. This is best done with a weapon that is at least +5. The drake's tail will respawn, but the sword can only be obtained once per playthrough.\nCharacteristics.\nThe Drake Sword entirely lacks Stat Scaling and is hard to upgrade making it a weak pick even in the early game. Once the player has upgraded their weapon to &lt;a href=\"Standard%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;Standard&lt;/a&gt; +5 quite a few weapons picked up before or just after Drake Sword will be comparable or entirely out damage its 200 AR at +0. Take for instance &lt;a href=\"Zweihander\"&gt;Zweihander&lt;/a&gt;, at minimum stats to wield two-handed at +5 it will have 257 AR which immediately out performs Drake Sword. &lt;a href=\"Claymore\"&gt;Claymore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halberd\"&gt;Halberd&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reinforced%20Club\"&gt;Reinforced Club&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Club\"&gt;Club&lt;/a&gt; will all deal comparable damage to Drake Sword at +5 with the minimum stats to two-hand each weapon. Drake Sword is not worth the arrows used to cut the Hellkite Drake's tail and should not be acquired outside of it being needed for the &lt;a href=\"Knight%27s%20Honor\"&gt;Knight's Honor&lt;/a&gt; Achievement since all Standard path weapons are able to be upgraded to +5 almost immediately upon entry into &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Parish\"&gt;Undead Parish&lt;/a&gt; and meeting &lt;a href=\"Andre%20of%20Astora\"&gt;Andre of Astora&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Drake Sword upgrades quite poorly, gaining 20 base damage per upgrade, costing 10,000 souls and requiring rare &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Scale\"&gt;Dragon Scale&lt;/a&gt;s. This is less of an increase in base damage than even the low base damage &lt;a href=\"Dagger\"&gt;Dagger&lt;/a&gt; gains when going from +0 to +5, a process which costs 7,700 souls, if all &lt;a href=\"Titanite%20Shard\"&gt;materials&lt;/a&gt; are purchased. Furthermore, base damage is used in the calculation for scaling, and upgrades to scaling weapons may also increase the parameter bonus directly, making the gap in damage even larger in practice.\nWhen wielded with both hands, the strong attack unleashes a ranged vertical cleave (similar to the Stormruler from \"&lt;a href=\"Demon%27s%20Souls\"&gt;Demon's Souls&lt;/a&gt;\") at the cost of 30 weapon &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;, degrading and then breaking the weapon quickly. Unlike most dragon weapons, the Drake Sword cannot be &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Augmentation\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt;. It grants 15 points of &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Flame&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; Defense when wielded. This effect remains active when in the off-hand and two handing a weapon in the right. "}

However, it also has very poor physical scaling, so the split-damage nature of the weapon combined with its low physical damage means that each individual strike of the weapon does not deal as much damage as its high attack rating would otherwise indicate. Conversely, however, this split damage is greatly amplified when performing a critical attack, easily overwhelming a target's flat defenses from multiple fronts. Combined with its &lt;a href=\"Stance%20%28Greatsword%29\"&gt;Stance&lt;/a&gt; skill, the Drakeblood Greatsword is a very dangerous threat against shield-carrying opponents, as it can either damage enemies through their raised shields or knock it aside with a guard break for heavily damaging &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;ripostes&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Drakeblood Greatsword also has the unfortunate distinction of being one of the shortest greatswords in the game, having less reach than even &lt;a href=\"Straight%20Swords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;straight swords&lt;/a&gt; like the &lt;a href=\"Gotthard%20Twinswords\"&gt;Gotthard Twinswords&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ringed%20Knight%20Straight%20Sword\"&gt;Ringed Knight Straight Sword&lt;/a&gt;. This makes it difficult to use against opponents who are good at outspacing the weapon. To counter this, however, it also possesses a moveset that blends the attacks of the &lt;a href=\"Bastard%20Sword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bastard Sword&lt;/a&gt; with those of the &lt;a href=\"Hollowslayer%20Greatsword\"&gt;Hollowslayer Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, it shares the two-handed weak attacks of the Hollowslayer Greatsword, meaning that after the first swing, it gains almost immediate &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt; which allows it to out-trade any smaller weapons that attempt to punish its short reach.\nOverall, the Drakeblood Greatsword possesses many intrinsic advantages that makes it very strong in the hands of a build that does not prioritize physical damage. Its innate elemental damage, combined with its ability to be buffed or infused, make it a force to be reckoned with when buffed with &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Blade\"&gt;Lightning Blade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Blade%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Darkmoon Blade&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Magic%20Weapon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Crystal Magic Weapon&lt;/a&gt;, or when infused with any number of elemental gems to amplify its damage output."}

The summoner can call in Drakeblood Knights infinitely, although only one at a time. Once the summoner is dead, the last knight summoned will remain and he can then be killed permanently.\nLore.\nAn order of knights who venerate dragon blood. The blade of their swords is engraved with script symbolizing dragon blood. Drakeblood Knights were worshippers of the blood of dragons and the red cloth that decorates their garments is said to symbolize their yearning for blood. In ages past they laid siege to a &lt;a href=\"Shulva%2C%20Sanctum%20City\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; in order to kill the &lt;a href=\"Sinh%2C%20the%20Slumbering%20Dragon\"&gt;slumbering dragon&lt;/a&gt; that slept there believing its blood would grant them true understanding of life. Led by &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Yorgh\"&gt;Sir Yorgh&lt;/a&gt; they managed to kill the &lt;a href=\"Sunken%20King\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; of the city. However, when Yorgh attempted to kill the dragon with his spear, it awakened and spewed a cloud of toxic gas that enveloped the city, killing Sir Yorgh as well as most of the inhabitants and Drakeblood Knights.\nIt is said that dragon worship has captured the hearts and minds of warriors across the lands for many ages.\nStrategy.\nEven when Drakeblood Knights don't have the same rolling penalty they had in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\", they are much easier to defeat this time around. They boast a very high amount of health and can inflict both &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage through shields, however, so they should not be underestimated.\nThey come armed with the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Tree%20Crest%20Shield\"&gt;Spirit Tree Crest Shield&lt;/a&gt;, which grants them high defense against &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt;-based attacks, although they rarely use it and instead prefer to hold their greatswords with both hands. Their attacks are slow and amply telegraphed, and they usually don't chain more than three swings, which allow the player to counterattack without taking too much risk once they finish a combo.\nThey frequently attempt to use the &lt;a href=\"Stance%20%28Greatsword%29\"&gt;Stance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; with their weapons, which the player can use to their advantage by luring them into swinging and missing in order to score some hits.\nFarming.\nSince Drakeblood Knights spawn infinitely and yield a base amount of 4,000 &lt;a href=\"Souls%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt;, they can be used for farming. By equipping the &lt;a href=\"Symbol%20of%20Avarice%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Symbol of Avarice&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Want\"&gt;Shield of Want&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hornet%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Hornet Ring&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Slumbering%20Dragoncrest%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Slumbering Dragoncrest Ring&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Covetous%20Silver%20Serpent%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Covetous Silver Serpent Ring&lt;/a&gt; (and perhaps also &lt;a href=\"Aldrich%27s%20Ruby\"&gt;Aldrich's Ruby&lt;/a&gt; to alleviate some of the &lt;a href=\"HP%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; drain produced by the Symbol of Avarice), the player can maximize the amount of souls acquired for each knight killed.\nThe player just needs to stand behind their spawning spot and begin combat with a &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Slumbering%20Dragoncrest%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Slumbering Dragoncrest Ring&lt;/a&gt; will ensure they don't turn hostile prematurely and the &lt;a href=\"Hornet%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Hornet Ring&lt;/a&gt; will increase the damage dealt, allowing the player to kill them with only a few more hits. Each knight defeated will yield 7,000+ souls and the process can be repeated as many times as necessary.\nCaution must be taken if the &lt;a href=\"Man%20Serpent%20Summoner\"&gt;Man Serpent Summoner&lt;/a&gt; summons &lt;a href=\"Havel%20the%20Rock%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Havel&lt;/a&gt;, though, in which case it's best to make haste to the nearby &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt; and try again. If the true Havel has already been defeated, then the Summoner will only be able to summon Drakeblood Knights, allowing the farming process to continue without interruptions."}

Unusually for a plate armor set, it is not weak to &lt;a href=\"Strike%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Strike&lt;/a&gt; damage, which gives it a very useful advantage over other sets. Although it does have a weakness against &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; damage, it is not far out of line with its other resistances.\nThe most unique aspect of this armor set is its high resistance to &lt;a href=\"Slash%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Slash&lt;/a&gt; damage and &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt; buildup. In this way it is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Eastern Set&lt;/a&gt;, making it very strong against weapons like &lt;a href=\"Katanas%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Katanas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Curved%20Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Curved Greatswords&lt;/a&gt;, although it is much heavier in return for providing strong defenses against other sources of damage.\nThe cost for all these strong across-the-board defenses is that the Drakeblood Set has a sub-optimal &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt;-to-weight ratio. While it can comfortably wield heavier weapons and trade using &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt;, it is less adept in this field than many other heavy armor sets."}

They do have some new attacks, though. However, the warpick knights have their own unique movesets.\nAll of the movesets are described below:\nGreatsword:These drakekeepers have the same three-four part attack that Old Knights have, except faster. When the player is near them, they can also stab the player behind their shields. When the player is far from them, they can do a downward slash which releases soul arrow-type effect. This attack has a slow attack animation, so it is easy to spot coming.\nUltra Greatsword:These enemies mainly do a very quick vertical slash, and then a slower horizontal slash. Their downward slashes ignore shields, but don't deal much damage.\nGreat Hammer:The ones with great hammers are easily the most dangerous. They have the same attack pattern as their Old Knights counterparts, except faster but also with less vulnerability time after attacking. They have three attacks: a running attack, three horizontal strikes, one powerful overhead swing, or two vertical strikes. However, they do surprisingly little stamina damage. The singular overhead attack has a long windup compared to their other attacks and offers the best chance to circle around and attack. They can spam the three horizontal attacks into three to four strings or until the player is knocked out of range. If you must heal, flee and do it from around a corner or beyond their retreat point.\nDrakekeeper's Warpick:These drakekeepers have several attacks which include an blockable shield bash that instantly stun-lock if unblocked as well as a three-part strike attack with their weapon. Strangely enough, for such a large shield, their shield has very little physical damage reduction."}

These qualities makes it usable in a range of different situations.\nAdditionally, it is by far the most durable weapon of its class, further reinforcing its usefulness as it can be used with little fear of it breaking, even when the player must spend a long time away from a &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Bonfire&lt;/a&gt;.

It shares most of its moveset with the Zweihander, and so players that are comfortable with it will feel right at home when wielding the Drakewing Ultra Greatsword.\nUnlike most Ultra Greatswords, this weapon's scaling is mainly focused on &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; builds, making it an interesting option among the generally light-weight Dexterity weapons. \nThe Drakewing Ultra Greatsword features a special attack which consumes durability every time it is used. When the two-handed heavy attack is used, a green, glowing orb will be shot from the tip of the blade, dealing physical damage that scales with Physical AR on impact.\nSimilar to other weapons with a projectile attack, the special attack will do considerably more damage if the weapon itself hits the target when it is executed, allowing players to deal massive damage with just one hit. Wearing a &lt;a href=\"Bracing%20Knuckle%20Ring\"&gt;Bracing Knuckle Ring&lt;/a&gt; will increase the number of times the special attack can be used before breaking the weapon.\nPerhaps the biggest downside of this weapon is that it is the shortest Ultra Greatsword in the game (tied in with the &lt;a href=\"Ivory%20King%20Ultra%20Greatsword\"&gt;Ivory King Ultra Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;), and so it has quite a limited reach. However, being an Ultra Greatsword, it still has high poise damage and will still easily stagger groups of enemies with just one swing. \nTrivia.\nThe weapon's inventory icon shows the wings folded out. However, the wings are only folded out during the two-handed strong attack."}

In addition, both Drang Knights will attack at the same time, even if only one was alerted.\nRather than confronting them head on, a safer strategy consists in entering a path located on the left side of the courtyard, where several &lt;a href=\"Irithyllian%20Slave\"&gt;Irithyllian Slave&lt;/a&gt;s are congregated; dispose of them first and then damage one of the knights with a ranged attack, thus luring them to fight in that enclosed area, away from the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Slave\"&gt;giants&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Deacon\"&gt;Deacon&lt;/a&gt;s' fire.\nYet another strategy consists in climbing up the nearby staircase and making way through the upper floor, dealing with all the &lt;a href=\"Deacon\"&gt;Deacon&lt;/a&gt;s first. Run around the knights from above and surprise them by the rearguard before they have a chance to react, perhaps even starting the battle with a &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;. Use the nearby staircases strategically to attack and escape, and also consider using the ladder behind the nearby &lt;a href=\"Illusory%20Wall%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;illusory wall&lt;/a&gt; to hide and lure them to fall to their deaths."}
