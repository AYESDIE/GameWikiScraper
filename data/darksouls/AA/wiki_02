For the first 1.5 seconds absorption is increased by 45%, then for an additional 0.5 seconds the absorption bonus is reduced to 15%. Any weak attacks inflicted on the wielder during the casting animation will also rebound, causing the enemy to take &lt;a href=\"Instability\"&gt;Instability&lt;/a&gt; damage if they are attacked while recoiling.\nThe skill lasts for six seconds for &lt;a href=\"Great%20Hammers%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Great Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, and four seconds for the rest. As well, the Great Hammer version of this skill creates a shockwave around the wielder that will temporarily stagger nearby foes.\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nThis skill is useful in that it essentially grants the player a state of &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; similar to its \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\" counterpart. It provides immense survivability, allowing the wielder to perform actions without fear of being interrupted; this is not limited to simply attacking, but also to running and to access one's &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt;. However, while the absorption increase is quite formidable, it does not make the wielder invulnerable, so care must be taken not to over-rely on the defensive buff for survivability.\nThe skill can also be used to quickly traverse certain environmental hazards, such as fire. \nOnline gameplay.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, this skill can be used to reliably win trades against virtually any weapon, as the Hyper Armor and absorption increase is guaranteed to withstand at least one attack regardless of damage. Its casting speed also allows it to be used a reactive defense. However, be wary of using this skill against smart opponents, as they can simply attack once and then avoid engaging for the duration of the buff, making it little more use than taking less damage from one attack at the cost of &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt;. As well, the duration of the buff must be taken into consideration, as over-committing can leave one open to easy retaliation once the buff expires."}

The duration cannot be extended by equipping the &lt;a href=\"Lingering%20Dragoncrest%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lingering Dragoncrest Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe damage inflicted by Pestilent Mist, per instance, is calculated as follows:\n\"10 + \"\nWhere \"X\" is the maximum HP of the target, rounded down to the nearest 1,000.\nUses.\nSingle player.\nThe cloud released by Pestilent Mist deals a static amount of typeless damage that is not affected by the target's resistance to any form of damage; it scales up based on the maximum HP of the target(s) affected. This makes it effective against &lt;a href=\"Enemies%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; that have high &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; defenses, or who are outright resistant to damage overall. As such, this is a very useful tool for sorcerers to have in their arsenal as it is also unaffected by &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Buff\"&gt;Spell Buff&lt;/a&gt; or the effect of Sorcery-boosting equipment, thereby making it useful for sorcerers that have not yet reached a soft cap for &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, the mist will also damage its caster, so one should not create clouds without good reason.\nThis spell is also excellent at taking down foes while invisible through &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Body%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Hidden Body&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spook\"&gt;Spook&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Slumbering%20Dragoncrest%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Slumbering Dragoncrest Ring&lt;/a&gt; as enemies do not react to the mist itself as a damage source. This differs from using other spells such as &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Soul Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, where enemies will register the caster as the source of the damage and close in to attack.\nOnline gameplay.\nPestilent Mist can be useful as an area denial tool, covering areas to dissuade enemy players from approaching. It also partially obstructs vision, allowing the caster to more easily cast various projectile spells.\nDepending on whether one is a part of a &lt;a href=\"Host%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Host of Embers&lt;/a&gt;' party or is an &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Spirit%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;invader&lt;/a&gt;, Pestilent Mist can have different uses. As a host party member or an invader that is part of a territory defender &lt;a href=\"Covenant%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;, the clouds will not damage teammates, meaning that it can be used to create safe areas for them to traverse that enemies cannot. As an invader, the mist will not damage world enemies so long as a &lt;a href=\"Seed%20of%20a%20Giant%20Tree\"&gt;Seed of a Giant Tree&lt;/a&gt; is not active, allowing it to be used to generate an area of harm around powerful but low-mobility entities like &lt;a href=\"Judicator%20Giant\"&gt;Judicator Giant&lt;/a&gt;s or the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Sage\"&gt;Crystal Sage&lt;/a&gt;, which can force host party members to take damage if they approach to within melee range to attack.\nNotes.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

There are also temporary ways to increase Petrify Resistance.\nWhen a player reaches about 900 Petrify Resistance, they become completely immune to Petrification.\nBoosting Petrify Resist.\nThe following armor and rings will increase Petrify Resist when equipped:\nBelow is a list of ways to temporarily increase a player's Petrify Resistance:\nBelow is a list of shields that will significantly reduce Petrification build-up from physical attacks:\nTesting has revealed that as long as players have about 100 Pet.

If the player opts in shooting arrows, they should use manual aim to target the creature directly, as locking-on to it will target the statues instead.\nIt is advisable to take on these enemies at a distance and out of their attack range, as they can shoot rapidly if approached and each direct hit will stagger the player, leaving them open to subsequent shots and quickly filling up the &lt;a href=\"Petrification%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Petrification&lt;/a&gt; build-up meter."}

Eventually he will ask the player to join the Covenant of the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20White\"&gt;Way of White&lt;/a&gt;. If the player says no to the Covenant question, the player may still join later. After more dialogue, Petrus will agree to sell miracles.\nWhen prompted enough times, Petrus will mention an undead mission, and ask for a show of devotion in the form of 100 &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s per player level. Paying him causes him to reveal information regarding &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;bonfires&lt;/a&gt;.

Once the game has been reloaded or the player leaves Firelink Shrine, the visitors will be gone and Petrus will not talk much about what happened.\nIf the player talks to &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Lautrec%20of%20Carim\"&gt;Lautrec of Carim&lt;/a&gt; he will offer information to the player for souls based upon level. He tells the player about how the lady and two companions went down to The Catacombs and got attacked, while Petrus escaped and left the others behind.

If Reah is rescued, Petrus will eventually kill her and claim her items for himself. Killing Petrus after rescuing Reah prevents him assassinating her.\nLore.\nNot much is known about Petrus except that he knows of Reah, Vince and Nico's childhoods.\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Patches\"&gt;Patches&lt;/a&gt; knows of Petrus, and his dark nature. &lt;a href=\"Oswald%20of%20Carim\"&gt;Oswald of Carim&lt;/a&gt; is also aware of the sinister side of Petrus.\nStrategy.\nPetrus alternates between attacking with his &lt;a href=\"Morning%20Star%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Morning Star&lt;/a&gt; and defending with his shield, as well as healing once when brought down to about half health, and occasionally using force.

{"id": "11661", "revid": "49243392", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=11661", "title": "Phalanx", "text": "Phalanx is collectively an in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\".\nLocation.\nEncountered beyond the first gate in the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariamis\"&gt;Painted World of Ariamis&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe name Phalanx generally means a tight formation of individuals. Similar to the military distinction, Phalanx faces their shields and spears outward, away from the less protected areas. They will always appear in the starting formation from the first encounter each time enemies are re-spawned. Phalanx is comprised of 14 naked, slug-like &lt;a href=\"hollow\"&gt;hollow&lt;/a&gt;s with deformed heads and limbs sticking out.\nStrategy.\nFighting all of them at once can be tricky as their large numbers mean that they can hit the player with many attacks in a short span of time. They block and deflect the majority of the player's attacks, so the better way to deal damage to them is by attacking anywhere behind the shield.\nThey are extremely slow moving aside from their attacks so arrows may prove effective if the player is unaffected by throwing spears. Alternately, if the player has access to the &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Mist%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Poison Mist&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20Mist%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Toxic Mist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Pyromancies&lt;/a&gt;, it can easily poison a large portion of them, slowly killing them with no major risks to the player. Even if not all of them are killed, their numbers will get cut significantly, greatly reducing their threat.\nAlternatively, scattering Phalanx will make for easy pickings. Attacking from the direction of the bonfire puts the player behind Phalanx with several concrete blocks in the way. These will effectively divide the group as they make their way towards the player and prevent others from attacking at range.\n&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Gods\"&gt;Wrath of the Gods&lt;/a&gt; is a very useful way of dispatching this enemy as each wave of force stuns the enemy while simultaneously doing a substantial amount of damage to a large portion of them.\nAn excellent way to deal with the Phalanx is to have an Ascended Pyromancy Flame and equip one of the 'Storm' spells, Chaos Storm in particular is excellent due to the lava patches left behind. From the bonfire, run in, kill the Hollows guarding the door, and then on into the courtyard. Ensure you are at full health, and if you have any, equip high-poise armor or the Wolf Ring. Run into the courtyard, and slightly to the side as the Phalanx breaks apart. Two-handing your weapon, swing in to kill one or two at the front, then switch to your Pyromancy Flame, and start channeling your Storm, while stepping into the center, near the statue. You are likely to get hit a couple of times, thus why poise is useful. The storm should take out the vast majority of the Phalanx, leaving only a few left to be picked off with ease.\nAnother method is to cast &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Tempest\"&gt;Fire Tempest&lt;/a&gt; with an &lt;a href=\"Ascended%20Pyromancy%20Flame\"&gt;Ascended Pyromancy Flame&lt;/a&gt;, then followup with the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Tooth\"&gt;Dragon Tooth&lt;/a&gt;, upgraded to at least +3. During the initial casting phase of Fire Tempest, you can still move, so start casting as you approach the Phalanx. Stop close to it, just within range of the spears; too close, and most of the Fire Tempest will overshoot them. A fully ascended Pyromancy Flame will do overkill damage to any members of the Phalanx within range. If Fire Tempest is cast at the right position, only three members of the Phalanx will remain, which can be dealt with quickly using the Dragon Tooth. The two handed weak or strong attacks of the Dragon Tooth typically hit three enemies at once, commonly hit four, and sometimes hit as many as six. With a high enough &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, a hit from even the two handed weak attack is a guaranteed overkill, which stacks with the &lt;a href=\"Symbol%20of%20Avarice\"&gt;Symbol of Avarice&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Covetous%20Silver%20Serpent%20Ring\"&gt;Covetous Silver Serpent Ring&lt;/a&gt; for a reliable total of 12,096 souls in 40 seconds (including the run to and from the &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;), when the entire Phalanx is destroyed. Killing two or three &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20%28enemy%29\"&gt;Hollows&lt;/a&gt; on the way to or from the Phalanx will net another 514 souls each, for a regular total of just over 13,000 souls in no more than 45 seconds, arguably the fastest method of farming in the game.\nNotes.\nAlthough tricky sometimes, killing all Phalanx in the map is a nice way to farm &lt;a href=\"Soul%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough there are 14 of them, one of them will sometimes spawn glitched in the ground, disappearing if approached."}

As a result, they can help the summoner defeat enemies and bosses, until either the area's boss is defeated, the summoned or summoning player dies, or if the summoning player uses the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Separation%20Crystal\"&gt;Black Separation Crystal&lt;/a&gt;. No rewards, apart from souls and one humanity, are granted to white phantoms. \nGold Phantoms.\nGold Phantoms are distinguishable from other summons by their golden color, which is a result of them being in the &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Warrior of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;. The purpose of a golden phantom is the same as a white phantom's, however, upon successfully helping the summoning player to defeat the area's boss, they will be rewarded with a &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Medal\"&gt;Sunlight Medal&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to souls.\nBoth White and Gold phantoms receive half the souls an enemy or boss would drop upon death in the summoner's world. This means that, if the summoned player is in NG and the summoner is in NG+, the former will often end up getting more souls for a kill as a white phantom than he would in his own world (ex., if a boss is worth 40k souls in NG and 120k in NG+, then an NG player summoned to help with the fight in NG+ will get 60k).\nThere is no change to the rewards received by the summoner.\nInvaders.\nRed Phantoms.\nRed Phantoms, otherwise known as Black Phantoms or Dark Spirits are the basic type of &lt;a href=\"Invaders\"&gt;invading&lt;/a&gt; character or player. Their red coloring is caused by the invader either being in the &lt;a href=\"Darkwraith%20%28covenant%29\"&gt;Darkwraith covenant&lt;/a&gt;, using a &lt;a href=\"Cracked%20Red%20Eye%20Orb\"&gt;Cracked Red Eye Orb&lt;/a&gt;, or being summoned to another player's world through placing a summon sign with a &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sign%20Soapstone\"&gt;Red Sign Soapstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe aim of a Red Phantom is to kill the host whose world they have invaded. Upon the host's death, they are rewarded with liquid &lt;a href=\"Humanity%20Mechanic\"&gt;humanity&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlue Phantoms.\nBlue Phantoms\u00a0are unique in that they only invade specific people. Blue Phantoms are members of the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Hunter\"&gt;Forest Hunter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Darkmoon\"&gt;Blade of the Darkmoon&lt;/a&gt; covenant, or victims of a member of the &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Servant\"&gt;Gravelord Servant&lt;/a&gt; covenant, and thus only invade those who are deemed \"guilty\". Their purpose is to punish the appropriate player by destroying them. If they are successful, they will be rewarded with a covenant item upon the host's defeat.\nThe player is never invaded by an NPC Blue Phantom in the game, however, they can invade &lt;a href=\"Lautrec%20the%20Embraced\"&gt;Lautrec the Embraced&lt;/a&gt; as part of a side-quest.\nDragon Spirits.\nDragon Spirits are members of the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Path of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt; covenant, and invade other players in order to obtain &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Scale\"&gt;Dragon Scale&lt;/a&gt;s. Their most unique feature is that the player's character will not change color like other phantoms do. In this regard, Dragon Spirits can be considered to be 'true' Black Phantoms, as their armor and weapons simply take on darker shades of their natural colors."}

If a phantom &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;dies&lt;/a&gt;, or the world host dies, the phantom is sent back to their own world in the same condition they were before they were summoned.

The longer a phantom is present, it will start to lose its radiance indicating that they are going to \"time out\".\nRewards.\nWhen a phantom fulfills its duty they will receive a &lt;a href=\"Token%20of%20Fidelity\"&gt;Token of Fidelity&lt;/a&gt;. If they are a member of the Heirs of the Sun, they will instead receive a &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Medal%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;sunlight medal&lt;/a&gt;.\nNPC phantoms.\nThe following is a list of all the NPC phantoms:"}

Selecting the arrow of choice will nock three of them to the bow, and then fire them after a short delay, releasing them in a 70-degree spread. Each arrow deals 20% less damage than if fired normally, and do not stagger the target upon impact.\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nDepending on the terrain and relative height of the player versus the target(s), this skill can be useful for dealing with multiple foes inside of the optimal range at which the bow excels. The spread makes it less than ideal when shooting at targets above or below the player, however at equal height the side arrows have a decent chance of hitting foes adjacent to the primary target. Or in an extremely desperate situation, at very close range all three arrows may potentially hit the target before they spread too far apart.\nOnline gameplay.\nIdeally, the bow would be used to harass other players at range, however within lock-on range it can be useful for harrying ganks as an invader if the host and his phantoms can all be corralled into following from a single direction. As well, equipping &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark Arrows&lt;/a&gt; will allow the side arrows to curve back towards any valid targets, giving the wielder a means for laying suppressive fire on a single target or potentially hitting them with all three arrows for significant damage. It should be noted that Dark Arrows will deal 25% less &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; damage instead of 20%, though in the majority of cases the small Dark component of the arrow will be more than negated by the target's flat defenses regardless."}

Overall it is good for two-handers who attack vertically, but this also means it is very hard to get a good hit on nimble opponents, particularly enemy players.\nThe combination of the durability mechanics of \"Dark Souls II\" (where a weapon takes durability damage for every frame inside an entity) and the weapon's moveset (mostly overhead swings that stall after each hit), mean that the Pickaxe will break \"exceptionally\" fast. This is particularly relevant for the PC version, where the weapon is virtually unusable.\nAvailability.\nFound in &lt;a href=\"Brightstone%20Cove%20Tseldora\"&gt;Brightstone Cove Tseldora&lt;/a&gt;. To obtain this weapon, an &lt;a href=\"Enslaved%20Pig\"&gt;Enslaved Pig&lt;/a&gt; must be guided from the first bonfire to the chapel full of spiders in Lower Tseldora, and consume a small group of mushrooms. \nMore precisely, it must be led form the camp through the &lt;a href=\"Prowling%20Magus%20and%20Congregation\"&gt;Prowling Magus and Congregation&lt;/a&gt; boss arena, then off the edge directly to the left and through the room where &lt;a href=\"Creighton%20the%20Wanderer\"&gt;Creighton the Wanderer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mild-Mannered%20Pate\"&gt;Mild-Mannered Pate&lt;/a&gt; can appear. Then head through the building the room is in to get down to the second sandy area and across the rickety bridge to get into the spider chapel where the pig will dig near a spot of grass. "}

Selecting a &lt;a href=\"greatarrow\"&gt;greatarrow&lt;/a&gt; to fire will immediately nock it, and loose it after a brief delay.

The Pike and the Spear share similar &lt;a href=\"moveset\"&gt;moveset&lt;/a&gt;s too. The exception is the Pike's running attack: unlike the Spear (which simply does a running lunge) the Pike's running attack utilizes the player's momentum to drive the Pike a considerable distance, hitting &lt;a href=\"enemies\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; multiple times. This gives the Pike interesting tactical and strategic options, but the maneuver has its drawbacks as it takes quite some time to perform, potentially leaving the player open to enemy attacks, and it also requires enemies to not strafe. This attack can also cause the user to fall off edges if performed in an inappropriate location. On rare occasions the pike may \"Launch\" an enemy with its two-handed rolling attack. So far this has only happened on a killing blow.\nDespite what the item description says, the Pike does not have the longest range of non-projectile weapons. The Silver Knight Spear, Dragonslayer Spear, Moonlight Butterfly Horn, and Demon's Spear are all longer.\nThe Pike has the highest damage potential out of all spears with a quality build. It outperforms the other physical damage spears due to higher base damage or &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; scaling, and lacks the split damage of the spears that have higher AR. (Split damage is penalized against enemy armor, which lowers the performance of weapons that deal more than one damage type, despite their high AR.)\nUpgrades.\nScaling Percentage Values.\nThe following chart lists the scaling percentages when this weapon is fully upgraded.

Compared to spears, it has longer reach and superior damage at the cost of increased weight and a slower attack speed. As such, it is more ideal for calculated and deliberate attacks against foes, requiring patience from its wielder.\nCompared to its immediate competitor, the &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Knight%20Long%20Spear\"&gt;Lothric Knight Long Spear&lt;/a&gt;, the Pike is lacking in various aspects. It requires more &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; to wield, though this is counterbalanced by its relatively low &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; wielding requirement and its lighter weight. It also generally does less damage at equal stat distribution, both for physical and elemental &lt;a href=\"Infusion%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;infusions&lt;/a&gt;, only truly outperforming the Long Spear when infused with a &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Gem\"&gt;Heavy Gem&lt;/a&gt;, although in this respect it is generally outclassed by its cousin the &lt;a href=\"Greatlance\"&gt;Greatlance&lt;/a&gt; as a Strength weapon. Additionally, it does not provide a &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; bonus when wielded, making it less effective for builds that want to utilize &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, this weapon's niche is that its overall wielding requirements are very lenient. The Lothric Knight Long Spear, while better overall, has an unconventionally high Dexterity wielding requirement, making it difficult to put on builds that do not prioritize that stat. In fact, the Long Spear has among the highest Dexterity wielding requirement of all infusable weapons, and most elemental infusion builds will often stop at 18 Dexterity in order to wield weapons like the &lt;a href=\"Astora%20Greatsword\"&gt;Astora Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gotthard%20Twinswords\"&gt;Gotthard Twinswords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Great%20Corvian%20Scythe\"&gt;Great Corvian Scythe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Knight%20Sword\"&gt;Lothric Knight Sword&lt;/a&gt;.

Players must defeat this boss in order to reach the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Tomb of the Giants&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nPinwheel is a necromancer wearing three masks of those that compose them: the &lt;a href=\"Mask%20of%20the%20Father\"&gt;Father's&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mask%20of%20the%20Mother\"&gt;Mother's&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mask%20of%20the%20Child\"&gt;Child's&lt;/a&gt; mask. Their body looks swollen and has three pairs of \"arms\", hinting that they are composed of three bodies or skeletons fused together.\nLore.\nPinwheel is a necromancer and pyromancer composed of the fusion of a &lt;a href=\"Mask%20of%20the%20Father\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Mask%20of%20the%20Mother\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Mask%20of%20the%20Child\"&gt;child&lt;/a&gt;. At some point they arrived in the &lt;a href=\"Catacombs\"&gt;Catacombs&lt;/a&gt; with their &lt;a href=\"Pinwheel%20Servant\"&gt;servants&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s and managed to steal &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Nito\"&gt;Gravelord Nito&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Rite%20of%20Kindling\"&gt;Rite of Kindling&lt;/a&gt;, a ritual created by the Lord capable of further bolstering &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;bonfires&lt;/a&gt; using Kindlings so that &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; can collect even more &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask\"&gt;Estus&lt;/a&gt; from them, and part of his power. Pinwheel would use them to continue studying necromancy and reign over the Catacombs with his &lt;a href=\"Pinwheel%20Servant\"&gt;servants&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s who employed the area's skeletons as their army.\nSummoning.\nIt is possible to &lt;a href=\"Phantom%23Summons\"&gt;summon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20Leeroy\"&gt;Paladin Leeroy&lt;/a&gt; to help out in the fight. His summon sign is on a ledge the player has to drop down on, above the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Wheel\"&gt;Skeleton Wheel&lt;/a&gt; area before Pinwheel's room.\nStrategies.\nPinwheel is a very frail boss, with the fifth lowest &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;hit points&lt;/a&gt; of any boss in the game. However, he can quickly become dangerous as he can summon an unlimited number of clones, all of whom deal the same amount of damage as he does. Therefore, a good strategy for fighting Pinwheel is to rush at him right when the fight starts and do as much damage as possible. When he teleports after summoning his clones, it is still possible to land some hits on him before he disappears. A simple tactic to identify the clones from the real Pinwheel is to lock on to him when possible.\nPinwheel's high &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; damage can be greatly reduced through the use of &lt;a href=\"Flash%20Sweat\"&gt;Flash Sweat&lt;/a&gt; and shields with high fire resistance like the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight%20Shield\"&gt;Black Knight Shield&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crest%20Shield\"&gt;Dragon Crest Shield&lt;/a&gt;. However, caution is advised as taking multiple hits at once will still deal a large amount of damage to the player, especially if they are trying to block while surrounded.\nBoss information.\nAttacks.\nQuick Fireball.\nHis six arms will glow and spin before firing it. This is easy to dodge with the right timing.\nCleansing Fireball.\nSlower, larger fireball that does more damage and has a bigger hitbox, though it takes Pinwheel longer to charge. Note that Pinwheel can also use this while jumping at a downward angle.\nCombustion.\nA close range melee attack that does big damage. Pinwheel will telegraph this by moving in close and begin spinning and igniting his arms.\nFlamethrower.\nExtremely powerful mid-range attack. There is a long delay before this attack is executed. Blocking it is unwise, as it hits multiple times, breaking the player's guard, and potentially dealing a fair bit of damage.\nClone.\nPinwheel will spin in the air and give off a purple light before conjuring an identical clone of himself. The clones are exactly the same as Pinwheel and there's no easy way to distinguish one from the other without keeping track of the original. The clone can also use all of Pinwheel's attacks but will disappear instantly when hit. There is no known limit to how many clones Pinwheel can spawn.\nVanish.\nWhen the real Pinwheel is approached, he may attempt to flee by disappearing, leaving the player at the mercy of his clones. A short time later he will reappear in a fashion similar to the spawning of the clones.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls \u2014 Pinwheel by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClpmaGDdNC8&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

Cracked Red Eye Orbs are single-use invasion tools, while Red Eye Orbs can be used indefinitely as long as one is in the &lt;a href=\"Darkwraith%20%28covenant%29\"&gt;Darkwraith&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;. Red Sign Soapstones can be used indefinitely, and allow players to be summoned into other worlds as black phantoms via summoning similar to white phantoms. Black Phantoms may only invade if they have reversed their &lt;a href=\"hollow\"&gt;hollow&lt;/a&gt;ing. If the target dies while they are in his or her world, then Black Phantoms are rewarded with one humanity. If they are instead vanquished, they leave a blood stain for the host to collect which will reward the host with one humanity. In turn, the black phantom will leave another blood stain at the place where they initiated the invasion with souls and humanity as if they died in their own world; however, they will remain unhollowed. Thus, as long as a black phantom can reliably get to bloodstains in case he/she dies, invading as a black phantom brings no risk whatsoever.\nBlack Phantoms may only invade players who have not yet cleared an area's boss. Thus, it is impossible to invade in some places that do not have bosses, such as the &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Lake\"&gt;Ash Lake&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlue Phantoms.\nBlue Phantoms are part of the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Hunter\"&gt;Forest Hunter&lt;/a&gt; Covenant, the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Darkmoon\"&gt;Blade of the Darkmoon&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0Covenant, or if they are victims infected by a &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Servant\"&gt;Gravelord Servant&lt;/a&gt; and are seeking revenge. They invade using Blue Eye Orbs, the Darkmoon Blade Covenant Ring, the Cat Covenant Ring, or finding the gravelord's summon sign. Forest Hunters can only invade in Darkroot Forest (although they can be summoned by &lt;a href=\"Alvina\"&gt;Alvina&lt;/a&gt; anywhere as long as they wear their covenant ring) while Darkmoon Blade invaders can invade anyone that is in an area that they have not cleared yet, but only if they were &lt;a href=\"indictment\"&gt;indicted&lt;/a&gt; by other players, they can also invade players in &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Dark Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0regardless of where they are as long as they're wearing their covenant ring, similarly to forest hunters. Success as a Blue Phantom grants upgrade materials to Forest Hunters and a &lt;a href=\"Souvenir%20of%20Reprisal\"&gt;Souvenir of Reprisal&lt;/a&gt; to Darkmoon Blades, while killing a Blue Phantom yields some souls, but no humanity. Regardless of the covenant they are from, blue phantoms cannot attack each other\u2014although they are free to attack black phantoms.\nDragon Spirits.\nDragon spirits are summoned through a dragon summon sign, placed in their home worlds by a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Eye\"&gt;Dragon Eye&lt;/a&gt;. Once summoned to the player's world by the host, dragon spirits duel to the death to win &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Scale\"&gt;Dragon Scale&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLocations.\n&lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Stoicism\"&gt;Battle of Stoicism&lt;/a&gt; is a location which allow players to fight in matches."}

These are &lt;a href=\"Bell%20Keepers\"&gt;Bell Keepers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Sentinels\"&gt;Blue Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20Blue\"&gt;Way of Blue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Brotherhood of Blood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rat%20King%20%28covenant%29\"&gt;Rat King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Remnants\"&gt;Dragon Remnants&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pilgrims%20of%20Dark\"&gt;Pilgrims of Dark&lt;/a&gt;. The player in who's world combat is done is called the Host.\nTypes of PvP.\nInvasions.\nInvasions are a form of PvP matchmaking where only the invader explicitly consents to initiating the match. These can be achieved by using &lt;a href=\"Cracked%20Red%20Eye%20Orb%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Cracked Red Eye Orbs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cracked%20Blue%20Eye%20Orb\"&gt;Cracked Blue Eye Orb&lt;/a&gt;s, or the &lt;a href=\"Bell%20Keeper%27s%20Seal\"&gt;Bell Keeper's Seal&lt;/a&gt;. Invaders have a set time limit on how long they may remain in a host's world. Hosts may be Hollowed or Human. Cracked Eye Orb Invasions can be blocked for a time in an area by Burning a &lt;a href=\"Human%20Effigy\"&gt;Human Effigy&lt;/a&gt; at a Bonfire. 3 Methods enter this category \nSummonings.\nSummoning combat is explicitly Consentual for both Summon and Host. These involve one player actively searching out a PvP opponent, and summoning someone to fight from a sign that the other person has placed on the ground. This type of combat can happen through use of a &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sign%20Soapstone%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Red Sign Soapstone&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Eye%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dragon Eye&lt;/a&gt;. Neither of these items will cause the invader to receive sin if the host is killed.\nForced Summoning.\nThere is one covenant that forces other players to be summoned into the host's world. This covenant is the Rat King covenant, and the point of this summoning is to make the summoned player have to fight through the Rat King player's world, having every enemy attack them, as well as fighting the host.\nArenas.\nThere are two arenas in which the player can engage in PvP combat against players from the same covenant. These are the Brotherhood of Blood arena and the Blue Sentinels arena.\nAlternate Invasion Methods.\nMirror Squire.\nWhen a Host Fights the &lt;a href=\"Looking%20Glass%20Knight\"&gt;Looking Glass Knight&lt;/a&gt;, the Boss may summon a player using a Cracked Red Eye Orb or Red Sign Soapstone within Drangleic Castle into the boss fight.\nAbyss Spirit.\nPlayers inside the Chasms of old may invade using a Cracked Red Eye Orb or Red Sign Soapstone withing the Chasms. The reward for winning this match is a Bonfire Ascetic.\nMatchmaking.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Matchmaking%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;matchmaking&lt;/a&gt; algorithm assigns player characters to certain tiers based on their &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Memory\"&gt;Soul Memory&lt;/a&gt;. A player character can only invade other player characters at the same tier or adjacent tiers. The range of adjacent tiers depends on the item used to invade and can be extended via the &lt;a href=\"Name-engraved%20Ring\"&gt;Name-engraved Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nTime limit.\nInvading phantoms and phantoms summoned via summon sign can stay in the host's world only for a limited time. Once the time limit expires for a phantom, their PvP session ends and they are send back to their own world.\nThe time limit can be extended for summoned phantoms via the &lt;a href=\"Name-engraved%20Ring\"&gt;Name-engraved Ring&lt;/a&gt;. When both the host and a summoned phantom wear the Name-engraved Ring and have selected the same god, the time limit is extended by 50 % for the summoned phantom.\nThe following table displays the time limit for each method of invading and summoning:"}

It involves engaging in combat with other users through use of multiple different items.\nPvP-oriented Covenants.\nIn \"Dark Souls III\" all of the &lt;a href=\"Covenant%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;covenants&lt;/a&gt; are geared towards online play; also, all of the covenants can have an aspect related to PvP.\nTypes of combat.\nInvasions.\nIn any PvP encounter, the host must be in the &lt;a href=\"Host%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Host of Embers&lt;/a&gt; form. For forced invasions, an area &lt;a href=\"Bosses%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; must be alive. The most common form of combat will be in the form of Invasions. An invasion is performed by using a &lt;a href=\"Cracked%20Red%20Eye%20Orb%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Cracked Red Eye Orb&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Red%20Eye%20Orb%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Red Eye Orb&lt;/a&gt;. Based on covenant affiliation, a player may appear differently during these invasions, but the most common color will be red. For example, a &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20of%20Sunlight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Warrior of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; will have a distinct orange-red glow if they invade while in the Warrior of Sunlight covenant. The &lt;a href=\"Mound-makers\"&gt;Mound-makers&lt;/a&gt; will invade a player as a purple phantom, and have the option of helping or hurting that player. The only way to remove hostile phantom players from the world is to defeat them, be defeated by them, or to enter the area's boss fog.\nCounter Invasions.\nMembers of the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20Blue%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Way of Blue&lt;/a&gt; can have a &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Darkmoon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Blade of the Darkmoon&lt;/a&gt; or a member of the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Sentinels%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Blue Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; counter-invade their world when invaded by a player using a Cracked or whole Red Eye Orb. These players appear as a blue phantom. The Sentinels and Blades will counter-invade any invasion into a player's world by a red or purple (Mound-maker) phantom. However, if a purple phantom is summoned in by a &lt;a href=\"White%20Sign%20Soapstone%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;White Sign Soapstone&lt;/a&gt;, neither the Sentinels nor Blades will counter-invade. The goal of these players is to slay the phantom. They will stay in the host's world so long as there is a hostile phantom present, excluding territory-defense covenants such as the &lt;a href=\"Watchdogs%20of%20Farron\"&gt;Watchdogs of Farron&lt;/a&gt;. If the host reaches a fog gate with a Blade or Sentinel in their world, the blue phantom will be sent home along with the hostile invaders. The host cannot remove a blue phantom with the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Separation%20Crystal%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Black Separation Crystal&lt;/a&gt;.\nSummonings.\nFor hosts who wish to pursue PvP combat willingly, they have the option of summoning in red phantoms via the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sign%20Soapstone%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Red Sign Soapstone&lt;/a&gt;. Summoning a hostile phantom in this manner will not initiate a counter-invasion from the Sentinels or Blades. A boss does not need to be alive for a host to be able to summon a phantom via a Red Sign.\nArena.\nFor players who have the season pass or either DLCs, there is an arena which can be accessed called Hollow Arena upon defeating &lt;a href=\"Champion%27s%20Gravetender%20and%20Gravetender%20Greatwolf\"&gt;Champion's Gravetender and Gravetender Greatwolf&lt;/a&gt; or after completing &lt;a href=\"Amnesiac%20Lapp\"&gt;Lapp's&lt;/a&gt; questline and receiving the &lt;a href=\"Champion%27s%20Bones\"&gt;Champion's Bones&lt;/a&gt;.

It consists in the player's ability to inflict heavy damage on an &lt;a href=\"enemy\"&gt;enemy&lt;/a&gt; by dropping from a higher level and landing on them whilst hitting them with their &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nIn all three games, the mechanic is basically the same:\nIf the hit is successful, the player will land on the enemy and deal a devastating blow that, in most cases, will kill it, or at least inflict a high amount of damage to bulkier foes.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\".\nMost likely, the first opportunity the player will have to have a taste of the plunging attack's power is when fighting the &lt;a href=\"Asylum%20Demon\"&gt;Asylum Demon&lt;/a&gt; near the beginning of the game. The player enters the boss arena from a high spot and is expected to initiate the battle with a plunging attack while the demon awaits below. If successful, the boss will sustain a considerable amount of damage and the odds will be balanced a little on the player's favor. Hesitating in starting the battle this way for too long will have the demon making the first move by jumping and bringing the player down to ground level and depriving them the opportunity of gaining the upper hand.\nA known - and intended - strategy for dealing with the &lt;a href=\"Taurus%20Demon\"&gt;Taurus Demon&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Burg\"&gt;Undead Burg&lt;/a&gt; consists in defeating it via plunging attacks. This is evident by the ladder conveniently put there, which gives access to the top of the tower from where the player just came out. Once at the top, they should not dwindle for too long or the creature will eventually jump up there too. If the player was lucky enough to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight%20Sword\"&gt;Black Knight Sword&lt;/a&gt; and invested their &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s to properly wield it, the demon will die in a single plunging attack.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPlunging attacks in \"Dark Souls II\" require a certain level of precision. The player is required to aim their character correctly toward the enemy and make sure they land right next to it, pressing the attack button as they come close to their target on the way down.\nIn this game, there are not many instances where plunging attacks can be performed, and due to the level of precision they take, only skilled players are advised to use them in the heat of battle. Certain duel arenas, however, provide structures where this type of attacks can be used against human-controlled opponents in online matches.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPlunging attacks have been greatly improved in this game, basically only requiring the player to lock-on to an enemy below, drop down, and press the attack button at any time during the fall, no longer requiring to press it with precision as one gets close to the target. The lock-on system will ensure the player is correctly aligned and positioned toward the enemy while in midair, and the attack will perform as soon as they come in contact with it.\nThere are plenty of opportunities for using plunging attacks throughout the course of the game, especially if there are large enemies around, like &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Ghru\"&gt;Elder Ghru&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Man%20Serpent\"&gt;Giant Man Serpent&lt;/a&gt;s. In these cases, there will usually be structures nearby where the player may lure and perform a plunging attack on them. Message signs can often be found in these areas, where the developers hint the player on performing one of these attacks.\nOne of the game's bosses, the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Wyvern\"&gt;Ancient Wyvern&lt;/a&gt;, is intended to be defeated precisely by these means, where the player is expected to run through a long gauntlet of enemies and perform a plunging attack at the end to defeat the boss in a single hit.\nIn addition, some larger enemies, like &lt;a href=\"Great%20Crab\"&gt;Great Crab&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Ghru\"&gt;Elder Ghru&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Sulyvahn%27s%20Beast\"&gt;Sulyvahn's Beast&lt;/a&gt;s, can be disabled momentarily if the player manages to land on their heads without attacking. If successful, the enemy will get staggered and automatically become open for a &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;riposte&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "4092", "revid": "56333033", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4092", "title": "Poise (Dark Souls)", "text": " Poise is a &lt;a href=\"game%20mechanic\"&gt;game mechanic&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\".\nGeneral Information.\nPoise is a value that determines your character's resistance to being staggered. Being hit will drain the player's poise value, and if drained to 0, the character will become staggered. Each time a hit is taken, poise will reduce and remain briefly frozen at the latest value; it does not regenerate over time. A timer is triggered with each hit that is taken, and if it completes before another hit is taken, poise will instantly refill back to 100%. This means that if a player with 53 poise gets hit by an attack that drains 20 poise, the player will then have exactly 33 poise for the next few seconds. This timer is set to 5 seconds by default, which occurs when only the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Ring\"&gt;Wolf Ring&lt;/a&gt; is equipped. For every piece of poise-granting-armor equipped, the timer's length is reduced by 10%. This means that if only one piece of poise-granting-armor is equipped, the timer will be 4.5 seconds, with two it's 4.05 seconds, with three it's 3.645 and with four it's 3.28 seconds. \nPoise breakpoints you will want to reach for PvE are: 46/61 with lesser breakpoints being 21/31. Looking over the later poise charts note the pattern of a lot of attacks dealing 20, 30, 45, and 60 Poise Damage. The reason these breakpoints are all one above these numbers is because you will want one more point of poise than the attack deals to Poise through a hit. Please note that PvP breakpoints are slightly different, visit that section for PvP related information. \nA few notes:\nMelee Weapon Poise Drain Values.\nDifferent weapons drain varying amounts of Poise, and it is completely independent of damage. The following tables show the amount of Poise drained for each weapon and attack type.\n\"Note: When certain columns like \"Rolling\" or \"L1/L2\" are omitted below, they are identical to those weapons' R1 attacks. When \"Kick\" is omitted, it drains 0 poise from standard enemies but inflicts a guaranteed stagger on player characters.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Axes\"&gt;Axes&lt;/a&gt;.\nChained Attacks:\n&lt;a href=\"Curved%20Swords\"&gt;Curved Swords&lt;/a&gt;.\nChained Attacks:\n&lt;a href=\"Great%20Hammers\"&gt;Great Hammers&lt;/a&gt;.\nChained Attacks: The Large Club has a chained 1H R2 attack, where the second R2 drains 75 poise.\n\"Note: The 2-handed rolling attacks actually trigger a guaranteed stun as well as draining Poise.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hammers%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Hammers&lt;/a&gt;.\nChained Attacks:\n&lt;a href=\"Thrusting%20Swords\"&gt;Thrusting Swords&lt;/a&gt;.\nChained Attacks:\nSpell Poise Drain Values.\nNote that weapons buffed by spells do not gain increased Poise damage. \nEnemy Poise Values - PvE.\n&lt;a href=\"Boss\"&gt;Bosses&lt;/a&gt;.\nVarious bosses do not have any poise. But rather than stagger with every hit, they are set to be completely Unstaggerable.\nPvP Poise Information.\nPvP Poise Breakpoints.\nWhen building a character for PvP, it is a good idea to equip armor that will put you above one of the following Poise breakpoints:\nToggle Escape.\nIf you toggle your left/right hand weapon during a stun animation, you can replace the stun animation with a weapon toggling animation (which you can move during), effectively cancelling your stun. While clearly intentionally left as part of the animation, the reason is uncertain. Toggling is an important part of PvP, depending on the attack, it can get you in a safe position or even let you hit them back or backstab their attack.\nToggles are \"Queued\", that is they start after the current animation ends. This can be a positive, as it allows for perfect toggles after being stuck in an animation. However, if backstabbed with a toggle queued, the toggle will come out as early on in your wakeup animation as possible, which both breaks your immunity, and leaves you unable to roll or block, often allowing the opponent to land a free hit on you."}
{"id": "66918", "revid": "49243392", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=66918", "title": "Poise (Dark Souls II)", "text": "Poise is a &lt;a href=\"Gameplay%20Mechanics%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;game mechanic&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\nPoise is the player's resistance to being &lt;a href=\"stagger\"&gt;stagger&lt;/a&gt;ed. Poise works similar to stamina in that it is reduced and refills on its own. Poise is reduced each time the player takes a direct hit. &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Shields&lt;/a&gt; prevent damage to poise when used to block an attack, instead reducing the player's &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;. If poise is reduced to zero the player will become staggered, following which, poise will refill. Poise will otherwise refill at a rate of 0.56 poise per second.\nDefense.\nThe player innately has very little poise, which can be increased by leveling the &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adaptability\"&gt;Adaptability&lt;/a&gt; stats. Players gain Poise via these stats according to the value of the lower one. Poise via leveling increases by 0.3 up until level 30, then by 0.2 up to level 50, then by 0.1 up to level 98, gaining 0.2 at level 99 for a total of 18.\nPoise is primarily added by the &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; currently equipped, &lt;a href=\"Weight\"&gt;heavier&lt;/a&gt; armor typically providing more poise. Poise can also be increased further by using the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Giants\"&gt;Ring of Giants&lt;/a&gt;, granting 10/20/30 poise at +0/+1/+2.\nPoise damage.\nPvE Poise Damage.\nEvery &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; has its own value of Poise Damage specified in the menu. This is the damage a 1 handed Light Attack will inflict vs NPCs (in PvE). Every other attack does multiplies this number by an amount specific to the attack.\nPvP Poise Damage.\nEvery weapon has a second Poise Damage number that cannot be found in-game. Same as in PvE, this value helps determine the PvP poise damage numbers by being multiplied by the same numbers.\nStone Ring.\nUsing the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Ring\"&gt;Stone Ring&lt;/a&gt; makes it so that every single hitbox created by a player deals 30 additional poise damage if it interacts with an entity in any way. This means that even sources of damage that do not cause poise damage, such as &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Fog%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dark Fog&lt;/a&gt; can reduce poise. However, hitboxes that cannot stagger still cannot stagger, meaning that this mostly just works to reduce poise so the next attack has an easier time reducing it to zero. Some self-buffs such as &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Buff%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;weapon buffs&lt;/a&gt; will also start dealing poise damage to the player that uses them when stone ring is equipped.\nTip Hits.\nTip Hits or Glancing Blows are community terms for a mechanic in Dark Souls II. Most attacks in the game have a distance at which they start doing reduced damage, as if the attack was barely able to touch the enemy. This also applies to poise damage. Tip hits cause hyper stagger to be ignored and real a reduced amount of poise damage. This is not the case for the &lt;a href=\"Axes%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Axe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hammers%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greataxes%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Greataxe&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Great%20Hammers%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Great Hammer&lt;/a&gt; Classes or &lt;a href=\"Silverblack%20Sickle\"&gt;Silverblack Sickle&lt;/a&gt; as they have no tip hit poise penalties.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jcDWgqJimZ0LjoIX5qdGde1UQeo7P3hN1SFaRA4Y4Sc/edit%3Fusp%3Dsharing\"&gt;Table with all poise damage values and tip hit reductions&lt;/a&gt;\nHyper Stagger.\nHyper Stagger is a quality shared by most Rolling, Jumping and 2-Handed Strong attacks. When an attack that has hyperstagger connects with an enemy, that enemy is staggered even when Poise is not depleted. This means most weapons have a way to stagger most entities even if they have low Poise Damage.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jcDWgqJimZ0LjoIX5qdGde1UQeo7P3hN1SFaRA4Y4Sc/edit%3Fusp%3Dsharing\"&gt;Table with Attacks that can Hyperstagger.&lt;/a&gt;\nHyper Armor.\nHyper Armor is a state a player or NPC can access, usually via specific weapon attacks, which changes how Poise Damage interacts with them.\nWhen Hyper Armor is active, attacks a character receives are altered in two ways:\nThis way, attacks that can hyper stagger get countered by attacks from heavy weapons and characters that use them can make more use of Poise than characters with lighter weapons can.\nEach weapon has a specific Hyper Armor multiplier that corresponds to its weapon class. Weapon class doesn't entirely correlate with the menu 's specified class but rather with the moveset of the weapon.\nNot all attacks apply hyper armor, as a general rule it's limited to the slower attacks on weapons.\nDodge rolls have a similar mechanic where they simply ignore poise damage for a section of their animation after their iframes end."}

This is especially important when using powerful but slow &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Ultra%20Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;ultra greatswords&lt;/a&gt;. The actual Poise number is expressed as a \"percentage\" of Poise Damage that is reduced when attacked during Hyper Armor frames.\nWhen wielding a weapon capable of utilizing Hyper Armor frames, the player's Poise Health is generally determined by the class of the weapon (&lt;a href=\"Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;greatswords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hammers%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;hammers&lt;/a&gt;, etc.), though some weapons such as the &lt;a href=\"Greatlance\"&gt;Greatlance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crucifix%20of%20the%20Mad%20King\"&gt;Crucifix of the Mad King&lt;/a&gt; are exceptions that have increased Poise Health. Poise Health is also temporarily increased for the duration of certain weapons' &lt;a href=\"skills\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the player is hit by attacks while in Hyper Armor frames, they will incur Poise Damage, depending on the type of weapon and specific attack. Whether or not they will be knocked out of the attack is determined by whether the &lt;a href=\"Stagger\"&gt;Stagger&lt;/a&gt; Point is reached, by reducing Poise Health to 0:\n\"Stagger Point = Poise Health - (Poise Damage \u00d7 )\"\nIf Poise Health is reduced to 0, whether from a single strong attack or multiple weak attacks, the attack will be interrupted and the player will be staggered.\nPoise health will be reset to full under the following conditions:\nIf an attack is performed while the player has depleted but not empty Poise health (e.g., it has been reduced during a successfully completed attack), their Poise health will be set to 80% of its maximum at the start of Hyper Armor frames of the new attack.\nIncreasing Poise.\nThe player's Poise is primarily increased by wearing &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, though it can also be reinforced via the use of three unique pieces of equipment: the &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Knight%20Long%20Spear\"&gt;Lothric Knight Long Spear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yhorm%27s%20Greatshield\"&gt;Yhorm's Greatshield&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Wolf Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nIncreasing Poise is subject to diminishing returns, as each individual piece stacks multiplicatively and reduces incoming Poise damage by its listed amount as a percentage (e.g., an armor piece with a Poise value of 8.5 will block 8.5% of incoming Poise damage, causing the attack to inflict 91.5% of its Poise damage). As such, stacking Poise is based on the following formula:\n\"A + B - \"\nWhere \"A\" is the player's current Poise and \"B\" is the amount of Poise being added through equipment.\nThe Poise from equipping four pieces of armor, \"A\" through \"D\", is thus determined as follows:\n\"A + B + C + D - \u00a0+\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\"\nWhich again can be further increased via equipping the associated weapons and ring.\nPoise Health modifiers.\nPoise health during an attack can vary depending on the type of attack.\nA weapon uses its base Poise health when performing standard attacks or strong attacks, with certain smaller weapons such as &lt;a href=\"Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;greatswords&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hammers%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;hammers&lt;/a&gt; being incapable of utilizing Hyper Armor unless two-handed. Performing a running or rolling attack will reduce Poise health to 50% of its base value (and in the case of ultra weapons, allows them to be &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parried&lt;/a&gt;). Performing a fully-charged strong attack, whether one-handed or two-handed, will increase Poise health by 50%.\nPoise Damage modifiers.\nAs with Poise health, Poise damage can also be modified depending on the situation.\nA weapon's base Poise damage is considered when performing one-handed standard attacks. When a standard attack is performed while two-handing the weapon, Poise damage is increased by 30%; the same also applies when performing a strong attack while one-handing the weapon. When the weapon is two-handed and a strong attack is performed, Poise damage is increased by 55% of its base value.\nWhen a strong attack is fully charged, Poise damage inflicted will be 155% of its base value if the weapon is one-handed, and 165% if the weapon is two-handed. Running and jumping attacks will increase the Poise damage inflicted by 10%, whether one-handed or two-handed. If a weapon possesses a sweet-spot mechanic, such as a &lt;a href=\"Halberds%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;halberd&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Reapers%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;reaper&lt;/a&gt;, failing to hit the target at the optimal range with standard attacks (both one- and two-handed) will reduce Poise damage inflicted by 10%."}

The &lt;a href=\"Tattered%20Cloth%20Set\"&gt;Tattered Cloth Set&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gold-Hemmed%20Black%20Set\"&gt;Gold-Hemmed Black Set&lt;/a&gt; also offer excellent Poison resistance.\n&lt;a href=\"Medium%20Armor%20Sets%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Medium armor sets&lt;/a&gt; are not the best choice when it comes to Poison resist, however, those worth mentioning are the &lt;a href=\"Channeler%27s%20Set\"&gt;Channeler's Set&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Catarina%20Set\"&gt;Catarina Set&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20Set\"&gt;Paladin Set&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20Sets%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;heavy armor sets&lt;/a&gt; generally offer much lower resistance to status effects than their lighter counterparts, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Iron%20Set\"&gt;Black Iron Set&lt;/a&gt; offers relatively high Poison resist for its weight.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Armor%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;unique&lt;/a&gt; headgear &lt;a href=\"Bloated%20Sorcerer%20Head\"&gt;Bloated Sorcerer Head&lt;/a&gt;, and to a lesser extent, the &lt;a href=\"Bloated%20Head\"&gt;Bloated Head&lt;/a&gt; have the highest Poison Defense out of any headpiece and do not need to be upgraded.\nIndividual &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; pieces that have the highest Poison Resist when fully upgraded are the &lt;a href=\"Painting%20Guardian%20Set\"&gt;Painting Guardian Set's&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Painting%20Guardian%20Hood\"&gt;Hood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Painting%20Guardian%20Robe\"&gt;Robe&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Painting%20Guardian%20Gloves\"&gt;Gloves&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0along with the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Gold-Hemmed%20Black%20Skirt\"&gt;Gold-Hemmed Black Skirt&lt;/a&gt;, totaling 273.6 Poison Resist.\nRings.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Poisonbite%20Ring\"&gt;Poisonbite Ring&lt;/a&gt; can significantly raise Poison resistance without the need to switch armor pieces.\nShields.\nMost &lt;a href=\"shields\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; let some &lt;a href=\"negative%20status%20effects\"&gt;negative status effects&lt;/a&gt; seep through while blocking, the exceptions being the &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Shield\"&gt;Spider Shield&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Greatshield%20of%20Artorias\"&gt;Greatshield of Artorias&lt;/a&gt;, which both blocks 100% of Poison attacks that aren't &lt;a href=\"area%20of%20effect\"&gt;area of effect&lt;/a&gt;.

It can be inflicted by the &lt;a href=\"Environmental%20Hazards%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;environment&lt;/a&gt;, various &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Items%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;. It can also be used as an &lt;a href=\"infusion\"&gt;infusion&lt;/a&gt; for weapons. Poison can affect both the player and most &lt;a href=\"Enemies%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt;.\nPoison build-up.\nWhen exposed to Poison, the target's Poison meter gradually fills. The rate at which this fills is dependent on the Poison &lt;a href=\"buildup\"&gt;buildup&lt;/a&gt; value of the attacker's weapon, item, or spell, and the target's Poison Resist stat. The Poison meter will gradually reset back to zero naturally, provided additional Poison attacks are not endured.\nOnce the meter is full, the Poison effect takes hold and drains the target's &lt;a href=\"HP%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; over a period of 20 seconds. This lasts until the Poison is either &lt;a href=\"%23Prevention%20and%20cure\"&gt;cured&lt;/a&gt;, expired, or &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; occurs. The total damage dealt to HP if left uncured is approximately 1,080 points.\nToxic is a more potent status effect that functions similarly to Poison, but inflicts greater damage. It is restricted to only a select few sources. Toxic buildup, resistance and curing functions just like Poison, however the total damage dealt to HP is approximately 1,485 points. As the buildup meters are separate, it is possible to be inflicted with both statuses at the same time, resulting in an immense health drain.\nIts not possible to increase the total amount of damage Poison inflicts - only the rate at which Poison builds up can be increased. Depending on the source of the Poison, the buildup value can vary greatly.\nOffense.\nPoison attack.\nThe Poison Attack (abbreviated as Poison ATK in-game) governs the rate at which the player's Poison attacks buildup upon a target.\nPoison attack bonus.\n The Poison Attack Bonus (abbreviated as Poison BNS in-game) increases the amount of Poison buildup inflicted per hit. It does not affect the total amount of damage the poison will do. Unlike weapons that have a &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;magical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt; stat, Poison has no equivalent scaling.\nThe Poison BNS value is determined by the &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adaptability\"&gt;Adaptability&lt;/a&gt; stats. In order to continually increase innate Poison BNS, both Dexterity and Adaptability need to be leveled up, with Dexterity giving a larger bonus.\nApplication of Poison Attack Rating.\nPoison and toxic apply once the status bar fills up to 100%. Each hit of a weapon applies the same amount of buildup per hit, meaning that multihit attacks are very effective at building status.\nThe AR you gain for Scaling/Bonus is applied as 40% as the number in the menu.\nThe handedness preference of a weapon applies to poison and toxic, typically reducing the amount by 10% in the left hand vs the right.\nThe amount of status built up for both Poison and Toxic is equal to [(Base AR + (Scaling *0.4))/5]% and then reduced by (Poison Defense/10)%. Players have 100 additional invisible defenses on all non physical types.\nPoison weapons.\nThe following is a list of weapons and &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; that bear an innate Poison buildup effect. For information as to how these weapons are effected by Poison infusions, see &lt;a href=\"%23Infusion\"&gt;this section&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoosting Poison build-up.\nThere are two pieces of equipment that can grant a flat bonus to the Poison buildup stat on Poison weapons when worn. The bonus granted from these items can vary depending on what type of Poison weapon is equipped, be it &lt;a href=\"%23Poison%20weapons\"&gt;innate Poison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%23Infusion\"&gt;infused Poison&lt;/a&gt; or both. Both of these items can be worn together, which would provide double the bonus.\nThe following numbers are the menu numbers but they are applied as a fifth of that on hit.\nInflicting Poison and Toxic build-up.\nPoison and Toxic buildup can be inflicted in a number of ways. &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Mist%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poison Mist&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Fog%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dark Fog&lt;/a&gt; are spells that produce a cloud of gas which inflicts constant Poison buildup while &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20Mist%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Toxic Mist&lt;/a&gt; inflicts Toxic, provided the target is in the vicinity.\nMost weapons can be given the ability to deal Poison buildup temporarily through the use of &lt;a href=\"Rotten%20Pine%20Resin\"&gt;Rotten Pine Resin&lt;/a&gt;. The amount added follows the &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Buff%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Weapon Buff&lt;/a&gt; formula. If the weapon has an innate Poison effect, the buildup is stacked and thus more powerful. Applying this buffs result in the weapon taking on a green glow.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Butterfly%20Set\"&gt;Moon Butterfly Set&lt;/a&gt; is unique in that its the only set of &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; that inflicts Poison buildup when enemies are close by. The Poison buildup is not constant, rather it emits Poison in waves every few seconds. Each armor piece simply enables the Aura, making multiple pieces deal no difference.\nUnlike weapon buffs, the Poison buildup of &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Throwing%20Knife%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poison Throwing Knives&lt;/a&gt; does not scale based on the Poison BNS value, instead dealing a flat 40% before resistances. They can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Lonesome%20Gavlan\"&gt;Lonesome Gavlan&lt;/a&gt; for 350 souls each. &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poison Arrows&lt;/a&gt; deal a flat Poison buildup value of 43% before resistances. They can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Lonesome%20Gavlan\"&gt;Lonesome Gavlan&lt;/a&gt; for 60 souls each.\nPoison Resist.\nPoison Resist governs how robust the player is against Poison and Toxic buildup, though the latter is not stated in its tooltip.\nInnate Resist.\nInnate Poison Resist describes the value of the player's Poison resistance when not influenced by any outside factors, such as armor, spells or consumables. Poison Resist can be increased incrementally through leveling both &lt;a href=\"Vitality%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adaptability\"&gt;Adaptability&lt;/a&gt;. Poison Resist will increase steadily until a soft cap of 140 Poison resistance is reached, after which any further increases will be much slower. Innate Poison Resist caps at 200 points, when both stats are at 99.\nPoison resist cap.\nPoison Resist is capped at 890 points. Combined with a hidden stat of 100 points, Poison Resist can reach a maximum of 990 points. Since 1000 points of any magical or &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; defense equals immunity, Poison buildup cannot be completely nullified, with the exception of blocking with a shield.\nArmor and shields.\nVarious armor pieces grant varying levels of Poison Resist. The following armor table shows the armor pieces which grant the highest possible Poison Resist, for each body part.\nShields will only block Poison buildup if the player is actively blocking. Merely equipping the shield does not count towards defense. The value on shields is expressed as a percentage, as opposed to points on armor.\nSpells and items.\nCertain defensive spells can temporarily increase Poison Resist, but they cannot be stacked with each other. Only one will be active at a time. &lt;a href=\"Common%20Fruit\"&gt;Common Fruit&lt;/a&gt; is a consumable item that can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Rat%20King%20%28character%29\"&gt;Rat King&lt;/a&gt; for 1600 souls each. They cannot be stacked with any of the defensive spells either. Consuming a Common Fruit will remove the Poison Resist provided by the spell, and apply the Common Fruit resist value.\nRings.\nOnly two rings provide Poison Resist. Both can be worn together, granting a maximum of 320 Poison Resist, at the highest item level. Like all other rings, duplicate rings cannot be worn simultaneously.\nOther.\n&lt;a href=\"Yorgh%27s%20Spear\"&gt;Yorgh's Spear&lt;/a&gt; is unique in that it provides an additional 200 points of resistance to Poison buildup when wielded. One can be wielded in each hand to provide twice the resistance.\nPrevention and cure.\nIf the Poison meter is filled, its effects will begin to take hold and HP starts to drain at a steady rate. To prevent the Poison status effect from triggering, the Poison meter can be set back to zero using a number of methods, such as using certain consumable items or resting at a &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;. This can be useful in \"life-or-death\" situations, when the onset of the Poison status is imminent.\nAlternatively, if the Poison status does trigger, it is possible to completely cure its effects with the same methods listed below. Some consumable items have other additional benefits, such as restoring HP.\nInfusion.\n &lt;a href=\"Steady%20Hand%20McDuff\"&gt;Steady Hand McDuff&lt;/a&gt; can &lt;a href=\"infuse\"&gt;infuse&lt;/a&gt; most weapons with Poison through the use of a &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Stone\"&gt;Poison Stone&lt;/a&gt;. Once a weapon is infused, the Poison icon () will be displayed next to its image in the HUD.\nEnemies.\nThe following is a breakdown of enemy and boss information relating to Poison buildup and immunity.\nCalculator.\nDatasheet that can calculate bleed buildup on each attack https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13Ba-cbzZG_EMnkuO_8MO53sidBna1hsztrCa_7LQ63E/edit?usp=sharing"}

Once the bar fills up, the effect procs, inflicting the player with slow damage over time. There are three strains of poison, and the one that a target is afflicted by will depend on the source that procs the effect by inflicting the last instance that fills the resistance bar.\nWeak Poison.\nWeak Poison occurs when the source is a world entity or an &lt;a href=\"Environmental%20Hazards%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;environmental hazard&lt;/a&gt; (that is, a source that is not an enemy player), or from a player-fired &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poison Arrow&lt;/a&gt;. Examples include the swamp in &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Keep\"&gt;Farron Keep&lt;/a&gt;, the attacks of &lt;a href=\"Ghru\"&gt;Ghru&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Smouldering%20Ghru\"&gt;Smouldering Ghru&lt;/a&gt;s, the spitting statues in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Cathedral of the Deep&lt;/a&gt; and the swamp area of &lt;a href=\"The%20Dreg%20Heap%23Bonfires\"&gt;Earthen Peak&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile under the effects of Environmental Poison, the player takes 3 points of damage plus 0.07% of their maximum &lt;a href=\"HP%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;, rounded down, per second for roughly 180 seconds, or 3 minutes:\nStandard Poison.\nStandard Poison occurs when the source of the Poison proc is a player that is not using Poison Arrows or the source of Strong Poison below. It is about twice as strong than Weak Poison, as it deals roughly the same amount of damage in half the duration.\nWhile under the effects of Standard Poison, the player takes 7 damage, plus 0.07% of their maximum HP, rounded down, per second over the course of 90 seconds, or 1 minute and 30 seconds. Thus, depending on the maximum HP of the afflicted target, Standard Poison will deal damage as follows:\nWhile the total amount of damage dealt is roughly the same as Weak Poison, it deals its damage in half the time, meaning that if it is continually applied it is twice as strong.\nStandard Poison may be inflicted by any of the following sources:\nStrong Poison.\nA special source of Poison, Strong Poison can only be inflicted by the &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Spores\"&gt;Poison Spores&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Storyteller%27s%20Staff\"&gt;Storyteller's Staff&lt;/a&gt;, and is is significantly more potent than the other two strains. It persists for up to 90 seconds upon proc, the same as Standard Poison.\nLike Standard Poison, Strong Poison will inflict 7 base damage per second. However, whereas Standard Poison will also inflict 0.07% of the target's maximum HP as damage per second, Strong Poison will instead deal 0.5% per second, more than seven times the strength of Standard Poison. This means that it will scale more strongly, becoming extremely deadly if left untreated:"}

Their swords are now &lt;a href=\"Gnaw\"&gt;gnawed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dorhys%27%20Gnawing\"&gt;by the insects&lt;/a&gt; of the deep spawned by the &lt;a href=\"Evangelist\"&gt;Evangelists&lt;/a&gt;, and the knights continuously spit dark souls as they bodies were hit and filled by the &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Soul\"&gt;sorceries&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Great%20Deep%20Soul\"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Deacon\"&gt;deacons&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nPontiff Knights are very aggressive opponents with a plethora of rapid combos that can kill the player very quickly if they are stun-locked. Whilst their attacks can be blocked, they will either retaliate with a &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Break\"&gt;guard break&lt;/a&gt; or perform continuous slashes until the player runs out of &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;. Most of their attacks do &lt;a href=\"Physical%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; damage; however, they will occasionally use a charged slash that inflicts &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; damage, even if blocked.\nPontiff Knights often appear in pairs, so it's highly recommended to lure them over with ranged weapons, as taking on a group is extremely risky. Although agile, they have very little &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt; and are relatively easy to stagger with continuous attacks, provided the player does not run out of &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;. They are also vulnerable to backstabs, although their speed can make this tricky to perform.\nWhen provoked, shieldless knights will chase the player relentlessly throughout extended parts of the city. However, those who carry shields will barely move from their current positions and will just raise them to protect their companions. For this reason, it is advisable to lure the former away from their group and deal with them first; if possible, by hiding out of their sight and attacking them as they are trying to return to their formation. For this effect, equipping the &lt;a href=\"Slumbering%20Dragoncrest%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Slumbering Dragoncrest Ring&lt;/a&gt; or casting &lt;a href=\"Spook\"&gt;Spook&lt;/a&gt; is notably useful, as it allows to perform frequent backstabs on them."}

Despite its heavy weight and long reach, it actually utilizes the \"light curved sword\" moveset of the &lt;a href=\"Scimitar%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Scimitar&lt;/a&gt;. This means that it is the longest reaching curved sword that can execute somersaulting slashes and flips, and thus possesses the speed and range to be a particularly deadly threat in &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;. The cost, however, is that its attacks use up more stamina than normal, requiring its wielder to refrain from executing too many consecutive attacks.\nBecause it does not upgrade with regular Titanite, it cannot be buffed or infused, and thus caters more towards a quality build than a pure &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;-focused one. Furthermore, the non-scaling &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; requirement for wielding the weapon further complicates its ease of use, though this is made up for by its &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite the description saying that it is brittle, its durability of 90 actually makes it the most durable Curved Sword. \nMoveset.\n&lt;br&gt;\nUpgrades.\n&lt;br&gt;\nVideos.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

As well, it has a moderate &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt; wielding requirement that makes it difficult to build for. And to top it all off, it only matches range with &lt;a href=\"Friede%27s%20Great%20Scythe\"&gt;Friede's Great Scythe&lt;/a&gt;, tying for the shortest-ranged reaper in the game while also only barely matching the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Scythe%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Great Scythe&lt;/a&gt; in terms of damage output. As well, it also possesses the unfortunate characteristic of being unable to inflict chip damage through shields when the target is inside of the arc of its blade, and the damage that it does inflict on a successful sweet-spot is less than what its peers can accomplish.\nHowever, the Pontiff Knight Great Scythe makes up for these weaknesses through the use of its &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;. While the weapon already innately inflicts &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt; on its targets, it can further inflict &lt;a href=\"Frost\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt; by buffing itself with its skill while also inflicting heavy Frost buildup in an area around it, without the need for a catalyst to cast &lt;a href=\"Snap%20Freeze\"&gt;Snap Freeze&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Weapon\"&gt;Frozen Weapon&lt;/a&gt;. This allows the weapon's wielder to utilize a more aggressive playstyle, using the combined status effects inflicted by the weapon to pressure foes in a way that its peers cannot.\nDespite it being noted as being brittle it actually has average durability for a Reaper. \nMoveset.\n&lt;br&gt;\nUpgrades.\n&lt;br&gt;\nNotes.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt; requirement does not affect its attack rating. However, casting the weapon art without the required Faith results in failure and does not consume &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt;, and attacks will consume more stamina.\n&lt;br&gt;\nVideos.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

He wears a crown and is adorned with a necklace of his &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%27s%20Left%20Eye\"&gt;eye rings&lt;/a&gt;. His skin is pale and seems to be decayed and covered in large cracks. His face is covered in dark roots and when he is brought to half of his life masses of similar roots and branches emerge from his back.\nSulyvahn wields two greatswords: the &lt;a href=\"Profaned%20Greatsword\"&gt;Profaned Ultra Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; in his right hand and the &lt;a href=\"Greatsword%20of%20Judgment\"&gt;Greatsword of Judgment&lt;/a&gt; in his left. When the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20One\"&gt;Ashen One&lt;/a&gt; enters the church, Sulyvahn is standing still with his two swords and when approaches his swords start to glow and he advances towards the player before quickly charging with an overhead slash.\nDuring the fight, Sulyvahn can be heard grunting and growling in a deep, distorted voice.\nLocation.\nSulyvahn is located in the large cathedral at the end of &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nSulyvahn was a humanoid creature born from an inhabitant of the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Painted World of Ariandel&lt;/a&gt; and raised inside of it. Despite the isolation from the outside world, he demonstrated incredible intelligence and talent for sorcery even as a young man as he managed to create new frost-based sorceries, using the cold climate of his home to &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Weapon\"&gt;strengthen weapons&lt;/a&gt; or create &lt;a href=\"Snap%20Freeze\"&gt;clouds of freezing mist&lt;/a&gt;. At some point Sulyvahn became dissatisfied with living inside the Painted World, as he had not experienced the loss or despair of those who ended up there to seek refuge after having lost everything else, and decided to abandon it, leaving behind the sorceries he developed to seek for knowledge and experiences of the outside world.\nThe young sorcerer would end up in the city of &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt;, inhabited by descendants of the &lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;old gods&lt;/a&gt;, and would be welcomed among them despite not having divine blood. He was able to earn the favor of \"Main God\" &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Dark Sun Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt; and thanks to a &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Ritual%20Spear\"&gt;crude replica of his magical catalyst&lt;/a&gt;, presenting it to his &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Darkmoon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Darkmoon Knights&lt;/a&gt; as a ritual spear, demonstrating his talent, creativity and ambition even if he lacked resources.\nOne day, when Sulyvahn was still young, he discovered the &lt;a href=\"Profaned%20Capital\"&gt;Profaned Capital&lt;/a&gt; underground the outskirts of Irithyll and in the ruins of the city he also found the &lt;a href=\"Profaned%20Flame\"&gt;Profaned Flame&lt;/a&gt;, an unfading, everlasting flame that never goes out, one that holds within it the Dark of humanity and, despite the fact that it burns like a regular flame, it can be preserved in icy remains, thus making it a \"cold\" flame.. Having obtained the sinful flame, an unquenchable ambition took root in Sulyvahn's heart, as the young man understood how this artifact could represent an element of immense political and religious power in a world where everything revolved around a fading &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;Flame&lt;/a&gt; while his was everlasting.\nWith great foresight and manipulation, Sulyvahn thus began his rise to power within Irithyll: the sorcerer used the Profaned Flame to enthrall the city's &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Witch\"&gt;holy knights&lt;/a&gt;, corrupting their hearts with the unquenchable version of the Fire they venerated. His influence thus expanded even to the troops they commanded who became Sulyvahn's &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Knight\"&gt;personal knights&lt;/a&gt;, reporting directly to him, acting first as his watchful eyes and spies and then as killers at his command, effectively becoming his private militia and secret police. Those who were once holy knights became \"fire witches\" who carried the Profaned Flame of Sulyvahn on &lt;a href=\"Immolation%20Tinder\"&gt;Immolation Tinder&lt;/a&gt;s, also catalysts for the sorcery once so abhorred by the clergy, while the &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Knight%20Curved%20Sword\"&gt;swords&lt;/a&gt; of the soldiers they led were imbued with the frost magic of their leader.\nSulyvahn thus continued to climb the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20White\"&gt;Way of White&lt;/a&gt;'s clergy and increase his influence until, at one point, Gwyndolin was \"stricken by illness\" and was forced to retreat from the government of the city, leaving command of the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Darkmoon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Blades of the Darkmoon&lt;/a&gt; to his younger sister &lt;a href=\"Company%20Captain%20Yorshka\"&gt;Yorshka&lt;/a&gt;. The sorcerer took advantage of the situation and proclaimed himself \"Pontiff\", the legitimate representative of the god, thus acting as the ad interim ruler over the realm of Irithyll and head of the Church. Obviously this was a lie and the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Knight\"&gt;Silver Knight&lt;/a&gt;s still faithful to Gwyndolin and the Blades of the Darkmoon serving Yorshka could have acted against him: however, Sulyvahn had imprisoned the god in the old cathedral of Anor Londo and his sister on the tower of her church, thus creating a stalemate in which neither group could act for fear of seeing their leader, held hostage, killed.\nHaving gained power in Irithyll, Sulyvahn set about cleansing the city of potential enemies, exiling or killing the Blades of the Darkmoon until there were no knights left in the order, eliminating the Painting Guardians and even turning the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Slave\"&gt;Giants&lt;/a&gt; who worked in the city into slaves. The Pontiff would also build an &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20Dungeon\"&gt;immense dungeon underground&lt;/a&gt; near the Profaned Capital, employing its survivors as &lt;a href=\"Jailer\"&gt;cruel jailers&lt;/a&gt; in his service and building the prisons for humans around the oldest cell of a giant. In addition, Sulyvahn erected a magical barrier around Irithyll, to prevent anyone from entering or leaving without his permission, giving &lt;a href=\"Small%20Doll\"&gt;special dolls&lt;/a&gt; to his most valued subjects to move through it, an artifact which nevertheless reminded them that their \"home\" was always going to be the Boreal Valley. Despite his coup and the partial schism that saw the Church of &lt;a href=\"Carim\"&gt;Carim&lt;/a&gt; establish itself as the alternative political and religious center of the Way of White, Sulyvahn continued to remain an ally of &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt;, donating the &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle\"&gt;Gargoyle&lt;/a&gt;s he found in the Profaned Capital to the country and leaving their knights and scholars access to Irithyll.. This powerful alliance thus allowed the Pontiff to retain international legitimacy and political leverage to strengthen his position and keep other human realms and high members of the clergy faithful to his faction.\nNow in absolute control, Sulyvahn continued to rule his church and city, holding in his right hand the ceremonial &lt;a href=\"Profaned%20Greatsword\"&gt;Profaned Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; infused with the power of the dark Profaned Flame that had fulfilled his ambitions and in his left hand the ceremonial &lt;a href=\"Greatsword%20of%20Judgment\"&gt;Greatsword of Judgment&lt;/a&gt;, a symbol of his authority as Gwyndolin's judge, but actually infused with moon magic very close to dark sorcery: both swords thus representing not only the violent way in which Sulyvahn ruled, but his true dark nature as well. In fact, the Pontiff spread the practice of sorcery even among the highest ranks of his clergy and his knights and began to carry out various experiments on darkness. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Irithyllian%20Slave\"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt; who worked on the city were turned into slaves and reduced to conditions of extreme misery and their Dark Soul appears outside their ghostly bodies, &lt;a href=\"Irithyllian%20Beast-Hound\"&gt;monstrous beasts&lt;/a&gt; with human faces appeared in the streets. Meanwhile, in the prisons, he tried to transform people into pale dragons, but only managed to produce unrealized &lt;a href=\"Wretch\"&gt;Wretches&lt;/a&gt;, victims of stunted development that manifested a faded strength of the ancient creatures and feeble tailbones.. He would also imprison several sorcerers, probably to force them to share their knowledge, like a &lt;a href=\"Karla\"&gt;dark sorceress&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Xanthous%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;yellow scholar&lt;/a&gt; seeking sorceries from fallen Oolacile, an old &lt;a href=\"Old%20Sorcerer%20Set\"&gt;Vinheim sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;, and a sorcerer-swordsman.\nSulyvahn would also create dark &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%27s%20Left%20Eye\"&gt;eye rings&lt;/a&gt; giving them to his &lt;a href=\"Boreal%20Outrider%20Knight\"&gt;Boreal Outrider Knight&lt;/a&gt;s, an order that was sent in foreign campaigns, that was the equivalent to being exiled. The pontiff experimented on them, giving them with his rings that would boost their attacks and recover their health as long as their fighting persists and that turned them into raving warriors who only knew how to serve as mindless guards, thus ensuring Sulyvahn total control over them and preventing them from betraying. The knights who peered inside the black orbs would be in fact lured into visions of endless deadly battles and go insane, transformed into frenzied beasts. However the effect of the rings, whose black eyes constantly hound the knights, continues over time, first fusing their armor with their own hide and then devolving them into a literal &lt;a href=\"Sulyvahn%27s%20Beast\"&gt;beast&lt;/a&gt; under the complete control of the Pontiff. At a certain point, Sulyvahn even forced a direct &lt;a href=\"Dancer%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;daughter&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gwynevere%2C%20Princess%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; to serve as a \"dancer\", bestowing upon her a set of &lt;a href=\"Dancer%27s%20Enchanted%20Swords\"&gt;paired enchanted swords&lt;/a&gt;, as a symbol of her new subjection to the tyrant, as they were enchanted with dark magic in the right-hand, and fire in the left, &lt;a href=\"Greatsword%20of%20Judgment\"&gt;mirroring&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Profaned%20Greatsword\"&gt;those&lt;/a&gt; of the Pontiff.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Lothric%2C%20Younger%20Prince\"&gt;Prince Lothric&lt;/a&gt; refused to link the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt; fell into ruin due to various internal problems, &lt;a href=\"Emma%2C%20High%20Priestess%20of%20Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;Emma&lt;/a&gt;, the High Priestess of Lothric, would send out messengers bearing the &lt;a href=\"Small%20Lothric%20Banner\"&gt;banner of Lothric&lt;/a&gt; to ask from help from allied countries to resolve their internal situation. Sulyvahn would thus respond to the call, ordering his &lt;a href=\"Dancer%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Dancer&lt;/a&gt; to serve as a Boreal Outrider Knight before sending her sent to Lothric together with a division of &lt;a href=\"Boreal%20Outrider%20Knight\"&gt;Boreal Outrider Knight&lt;/a&gt;s and under the watchful eye of &lt;a href=\"Vordt%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Vordt of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt;. Here she positioned herself to guard the Cathedral and High Priestess Emma while Vordt guarded the main gate of the city and the Outrider Knights infiltrated inside and around the city of Lothric.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; continued to fade and &lt;a href=\"Lothric%2C%20Younger%20Prince\"&gt;Prince Lothric&lt;/a&gt; refused to link it, the &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lords of Cinder&lt;/a&gt; of the past were exhumed from their graves to once again be used as fuel. Among them was &lt;a href=\"Aldrich%2C%20Devourer%20of%20Gods\"&gt;Aldrich&lt;/a&gt; who, however, had no intention of sacrificing himself again as his reflections on the state of the world had led him to understand that an &lt;a href=\"Deep\"&gt;Age of the Deep&lt;/a&gt; would soon arrive, motivating him to try to devour the gods themselves to erode their hold on the Flame and accelerate the coming of his vision. Gathering an army of &lt;a href=\"Deacon\"&gt;deacons&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Cathedral of the Deep&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Archdeacon%20McDonnell\"&gt;Archdeacon McDonnell&lt;/a&gt;, Aldrich would thus move toward Irithyll to devour the king of the gods himself. However, he would find his way blocked by Sulyvahn and his &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Knight\"&gt;knights&lt;/a&gt;, as the pontiff had no intention of relinquishing the source of his control over the city and the Way of White so easily. Despite the battle, Aldrich emerged victorious, slaughtering Sulyvahn's troops and defeating the pontiff, forcing him to clear the way for the ruined cathedral of Anor Londo leaving the old god to be devoured by Aldrich. \nDespite having lost the source of his religious and political power, Sulyvahn, still wearing his torn robes from the battle, remained in the city's cathedral. The pontiff slowly began to bring his knights back to life through necromancy and use them to patrol lower Irithyll as frigid spirits.. In addition, his &lt;a href=\"Sulyvahn%27s%20Beast\"&gt;beasts&lt;/a&gt; would have resumed controll over the access of the city and have isolated &lt;a href=\"Archdeacon%20McDonnell\"&gt;Archdeacon McDonnell&lt;/a&gt;, who was leading Aldrich's legion, into the &lt;a href=\"Water%20Reserve\"&gt;Water Reserve&lt;/a&gt;, implying his attempt to bring back the city under his control while Aldrich was still busy digesting Gwyndolin..\nStrategy.\nOnce you enter through the fog gate, be cautious as you approach Pontiff as he will likely leap at you with his sword from a distance. With good timing, this attack can be parried, immediately giving you the upper hand.\nAs most of his combos are mid or mid-long range, two-handed shield-less builds should roll behind him because the only attacks that hit behind his back are turning pirouette attacks (or jump and plunge attacks in the second phase) that are easier to dodge than his multi-hit combos. Pontiff also overcommits to some attacks and can be combo-locked giving a player from behind the chance to deal free damage. He will turn around but his turn is slow enough that a player can reposition behind his back. If Pontiff moves to mid-range, close the distance from the side and reposition behind his back.\nDuring the fight, it is advised to not extend one's attacks for more than two swings as you would need your stamina to dodge or absorb Pontiff's aggressive retaliation. Sulyvahn's attacks can be difficult to avoid due to varying delays, rapidly chaining combos and large distance that they can cover. Watch out for the downward strike and impaling slide attacks that he performs - they are telegraphed and have long recovery time, giving you time to strike back or heal up.\nOnce Pontiff loses half of his health, he enters the second phase. The transition animation deals area of effect damage over its duration. At this point Pontiff starts using new attacks, including area of effect ground slams, long-range lunges and magic projectiles. At some point, he will summon a phantom copy of himself that performs each of the Pontiff's moves moments before he executes them himself. While it is possible to slay the phantom, the damage it takes is not drained from the Pontiff's own health, and as the Pontiff is also capable of re-summoning the copy should it die, one should avoid exclusively attacking it unless it's at low health already.\nPontiff Sulyvahn is extremely susceptible to parrying, each riposte dealing upwards of 1000 damage. A couple of his moves can be easily exploited as the swings of his flaming sword are usually telegraphed and can be predicted. Utilizing parry and riposte throughout the battle can end the fight quickly, leaving him close to death just as he begins to summon the phantom.\nAn easier method that forgoes parries (and even rolling) is to simply circle around him clockwise while raising a shield that offers 100% physical absorption. Circling left (Sulyvahn's right) will avoid almost every attack and allow you time to land one or two hits after most of his attack patterns. When he begins to summon a phantom start attacking immediately to kill the phantom as quick as possible and resume circling clockwise. Since this strategy allows you to steadily attack throughout the fight, it will typically end before he tries to summon another one.\nGood fire and/or magic block, such as the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crest%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dragon Crest Shield&lt;/a&gt;, is recommended."}

Their melee range attacks deal heavy damage to health and stamina, and can be difficult to interrupt due to their high poise and long range. Their attacking moveset is very peculiar and difficult to predict, the most characteristic (and dangerous) one being when they perform a slow overhead swing with their sword, which apparently renders them immobile on the floor, just to unexpectedly perform a twisting slash which covers all the immediate area around it.\nTheir ranged attacks are far more threatening, however, as they are deadly accurate with their powerful greatbows, tracking the player's movement perfectly before firing. It's recommended to engage them with caution, either by destroying them from afar or by using heavy-hitting melee weapons to break their poise. Should it be behind cover or a low wall, the Possessed Armor will send its bow arm floating above it, giving a clear shot on the player. Keeping an eye on the greatbow should prevent nasty surprises."}

Although the weapon sports a respectable amount of &lt;a href=\"physical\"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; base damage, it has very poor &lt;a href=\"Scaling%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt;, which means that most other weapons in its class will deal more damage. However, it's the only straight sword with an innate &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage, and it has relatively high scaling with it as well. Additionally, when held in two-hands, pressing the &lt;a href=\"Parry%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt; button will apply a buff that further increases the weapon's Fire damage, at the cost of &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Possessed Armor Sword makes for an excellent weapon for players with a high &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29%23Fire%20Attack%20Bonus\"&gt;Fire attack&lt;/a&gt;, if they meet the requirements to wield it. It is recommended to &lt;a href=\"infuse\"&gt;infuse&lt;/a&gt; the sword with &lt;a href=\"Firedrake%20Stone\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; to maximize damage output.\nIts strengths comes at the cost of being relatively heavy. &lt;a href=\"Weigh\"&gt;Weigh&lt;/a&gt;ing in at five units, it's the third-heaviest Straight Sword, tied with the &lt;a href=\"Varangian%20Sword\"&gt;Varangian Sword&lt;/a&gt;. It also has a fairly high &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; requirement for how poor its physical damage is, which can make it somewhat off-putting for low-Strength characters. It also has slightly below-average durability, and can't be buffed by outside sources, such as &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Weapon\"&gt;Flame Weapon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Charcoal%20Pine%20Resin%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Charcoal Pine Resin&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "58586", "revid": "49243392", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=58586", "title": "Power Stance", "text": "The Power Stance is a player ability in\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;.\"\u00a0When dual wielding two weapons of similar classes, attempting to two-hand the left-hand weapon (hold Y/Triangle by default), the player instead activates Power Stance, which makes left-hand attacks swing with both weapons instead. Most light weapons swing in sequence with one another, while most heavy weapons strike simultaneously with both weapons.\nBasic Mechanics.\nIn order to activate Power Stance, the player must have 1.5 times the Strength and Dexterity requirements of the equipped weapons, rounded down. For instance, power stancing two &lt;a href=\"Caestus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Caestuses&lt;/a&gt;, normally requiring 10 STR and 7 DEX, requires 15 STR and 10 DEX. When power stancing two weapons with different requirements, the higher stat of either weapon is used. For weapons that require Intelligence or Faith, only the normal requirement must be met.\nThis mechanic is only found in \"Dark Souls II\" and \"\", but is spiritually succeeded in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Paired%20Weapons\"&gt;Paired Weapons&lt;/a&gt;. The mechanic would make a return later in \"Elden Ring\".\nNot all weapons are compatible with each other. However, except for bows, crossbows, shields, and casting tools, all weapons can be power stanced freely with any weapon of the same type. &lt;a href=\"Crossbows%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Crossbows&lt;/a&gt; can be power stanced, but will suffer a damage reduction for both single and double shots, and the &lt;a href=\"Avelyn%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Avelyn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20Repeating%20Crossbow\"&gt;Sanctum Repeating Crossbow&lt;/a&gt; cannot be power stanced with normal crossbows. In addition, the &lt;a href=\"Vanquisher%27s%20Seal\"&gt;Vanquisher's Seal&lt;/a&gt; allows the player to power stance with their bare fists. &lt;a href=\"Reeve%27s%20Greatshield\"&gt;Reeve's&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orma%27s%20Greatshield\"&gt;Orma's Greatshields&lt;/a&gt;, when wielded in the right and left hands respectively, also allow power stancing, uniquely for any shields.\nCompatibility Chart.\nThe following chart represents all powerstancing categories the game accepts as usable. These are placed in order of Preference given to them for the mechanic. The closer the weapon class is to the top left corner, the less Preference they are given. The 3 categories are represented thus:\nThese Categories are generally determined by moveset, not the weapon class displayed in the menu. For example, &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20Blacksword\"&gt;Crypt Blacksword&lt;/a&gt; is considered a Greataxe despite saying Ultra Greatsword in the menu. Lists of each category are found on this page.\nAdvanced Mechanics.\nStamina costs are determined by the moveset. This means that a low stamina cost weapon can combine with a high stamina cost weapon for a low cost power stance. This is quality gives more use to &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Straight%20Sword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Broken Straight Sword&lt;/a&gt; as it can power stance with most swords to make a low cost combination.\nEach weapon uses their own attack's damage values. This means that if a weapon's own powerstance attack would deal &lt;a href=\"Thrust%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;thrust&lt;/a&gt; damage, even if the power stance attack used would be another damage type like slash, the each weapon uses the damage type it would otherwise use.\nEach weapon uses their own attack's hitboxes. The hitboxes do appear where they look to be on the weapon, however some special powerstance attacks have more hitboxes than standard ones. This means that attacks that apply multiple hits, like &lt;a href=\"Warped%20Sword\"&gt;Warped Sword&lt;/a&gt;'s power stanced L2 does not have a second hit to apply on most weapons it can pair with."}
{"id": "3854", "revid": "49243392", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3854", "title": "Power Within", "text": "Power Within is a &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Pyromancy&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAvailability.\nPower Within can be found in &lt;a href=\"Blighttown\"&gt;Blighttown&lt;/a&gt;, under the &lt;a href=\"Parasitic%20Wall%20Hugger\"&gt;Parasitic Wall Hugger&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeneral information.\nPower Within increases all damage dealt by the player by 40% and increases stamina recovery by 30 per second for its duration. Though the in-game description implies this is a &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; increase, the spell does not actually increase stats, and attacks that do not scale with Strength (including all offensive ) are also buffed. The effect is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Tearstone%20Ring\"&gt;Red Tearstone Ring&lt;/a&gt;, but the former can be triggered on demand rather than conditionally, and the two effects can also stack. Power Within also increases &lt;a href=\"stamina\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; regeneration and constantly drains &lt;a href=\"HP\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; while in effect. Wearing the &lt;a href=\"Lingering%20Dragoncrest%20Ring\"&gt;Lingering Dragoncrest Ring&lt;/a&gt; will increase the duration of Power Within, while leaving the total HP loss unchanged (instead it reduces the HP loss \"rate\"). Power Within cannot be used in conjunction with other &lt;a href=\"self%20augmentation\"&gt;self augmentation&lt;/a&gt; spells, such as &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Flesh\"&gt;Iron Flesh&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Great%20Magic%20Barrier\"&gt;Great Magic Barrier&lt;/a&gt;.\nPower Within is capable of killing the player; as with other personal buffs in \"Dark Souls\", there is also no way of cancelling the spell while in effect short of &lt;a href=\"dying\"&gt;dying&lt;/a&gt; or using the &lt;a href=\"Homeward\"&gt;Homeward&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Miracle&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Homeward%20Bone\"&gt;Homeward Bone&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Darksign\"&gt;Darksign&lt;/a&gt;.\nMechanics.\nPower Within has a duration of 100 seconds, time during which it \"pulsates\" 100 times. For every pulsation, the player loses 1% of their health (rounded down). At the end of the cast, the spell will have consumed the player's entire health, rounded down to the hundreds. For example, a player with 1,385 health will have lost 1,300 health and be left with 85 health. For players that plan to use Power Within, it is recommended trying to stay under a hundred mark rather than just over, e.g.:\nWhen combined with the &lt;a href=\"Lingering%20Dragoncrest%20Ring\"&gt;Lingering Dragoncrest Ring&lt;/a&gt;, the spell will last longer but it will still only \"pulsate\" 100 times, with each pulsation being spaced further apart. The total health loss will be the same and the \"damage per pulsation\" will appear unchanged when looking at the stats. However, from a pure \"health lost per second\", the damage will have been reduced by 33%.\nStrategy.\nPower Within is a risk-vs-reward spell. It is often useful in &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; fights where players are likely to die in a couple of hits anyway and need to kill the boss quickly. In &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, it is popular for glass cannon builds, as well as a desperation move should players find the odds stacked against them.\nNotes.\nPre-patch 1.06, the health drained a rate of the player's max HP*magic adjust of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"pyromancy%20flame\"&gt;pyromancy flame&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0used to cast Power Within for the duration of the spell. Therefore, since the benefits of Power Within were constant no matter how upgraded the pyromancy flame is, it was best to cast Power Within with an unupgraded pyromancy flame.\u00a0"}

It is also possible to stack the two effects by casting Pray for Favor, and then switching to another &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Chimes%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;sacred chime&lt;/a&gt; and casting Gentle Prayer.\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nThe primary use of this skill is for gradually replenishing HP in a situation where the caster requires both hands for combat. As the buff is not lost by putting away the chime, it allows the wielder to simply activate the skill, switch weapons and then resume combat. However, as it costs more &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt; and heals for less HP than Gentle Prayer (roughly 13.3 HP healed per point of FP expended, versus a maximum of 27.7 HP per FP), it is far less efficient.\nOnline gameplay.\nThis skill is very useful in cooperative play, as the caster can apply the buff to all allies, increasing its strength proportionate to the number of allies. As an invader, it allows the caster to benefit from the heal while also freeing both hands for combat, which can be handy in situations where the caster cannot take advantage of any long periods of inactivity in the host's world."}

They have very long necks, serpentine pupils, large flat noses, long floppy ears and a large mouth constantly open to reveal a toothy smile.\nThey are ancient creatures that can trace their origins from the &lt;a href=\"Dragons\"&gt;primordial dragons&lt;/a&gt;. Born as imperfect after the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; appeared and, bringing Disparity and Souls, allowed them to evolve as living beings. Similarly to dragons mutating or getting imbued with elements from birth (as in the case of &lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;Seath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sinh%2C%20the%20Slumbering%20Dragon\"&gt;Sinh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragon%20Kalameet\"&gt;Kalameet&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Gaping%20Dragon\"&gt;Gaping Dragon&lt;/a&gt;), serpents and snake-like creatures are imperfect dragons.\nIt is unknown how many Primordial Serpents exist in the world, but all hints seem to suggest that they're few and that most of them do not reveal themselves often to anyone. They seem to possess a vast knowledge of the world, its events and secrets, and their affiliation to any political entity, faith or purpose is often uncertain and doubtful. In game, it is impossible to kill or hurt any serpent significantly, making the nature of their souls and any clear scope of their true identity shrouded in mystery. \n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis section of the lore lacks sources and is in need of further expansions and explanations!\nThere are two named Primordial Serpents\u00a0in the game: &lt;a href=\"Kingseeker%20Frampt\"&gt;Kingseeker Frampt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darkstalker%20Kaathe\"&gt;Darkstalker Kaathe&lt;/a&gt;.

Kaathe gave the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Kings\"&gt;Four Kings&lt;/a&gt; the art of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Hand\"&gt;lifedrain&lt;/a&gt; and consequently founded the &lt;a href=\"Darkwraith%20%28covenant%29\"&gt;Darkwraith&lt;/a&gt; covenant.

This sparked the spread of the Abyss, transforming the townsfolk into monstrous beings whose humanity has run wild, akin to Manus.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"ending\"&gt;ending&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Lord\"&gt;Dark Lord&lt;/a&gt;, ten additional primordial serpents are seen, whose names are unknown. They appear to want to serve the newly-appointed Dark Lord, and possibly usher in the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Dark\"&gt;Age of Dark&lt;/a&gt;. An interesting note in this ending is that Kaathe states that both himself and Frampt will serve the Chosen Undead, despite any actions the player has taken before reaching this point, like placing the &lt;a href=\"Lordvessel\"&gt;Lordvessel&lt;/a&gt; with Frampt, instead of Kaathe, which would make the latter refuse to cooperate with the player, and vice-versa.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the region and times of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt;, their influence appears to have faded, at least from &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; and the surrounding regions, as their existence and history are not preserved and known to its inhabitants. However, a &lt;a href=\"Watchdragon%20Parma\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; representing two intertwined \"serpentine dragons\" can be found in &lt;a href=\"Heide%27s%20Tower%20of%20Flame\"&gt;Heide&lt;/a&gt;. The two creatures are regarded as \"watchers of the flow of time\" and depicted as in contrast, one painted white and one black, implying that at least in Heide the Primordial Serpents and the conflicting ideologies of Kaathe and Frampt were partly known.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the region and times of &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt;, their influence can still be found in some regions such as Lothric and Londor. \nEven after possibly hundreds of thousands years after the first linking of the Flame, Frampt or other serpents affiliated with his ideology, continued to propagate the cult of the linking of the Flame; influencing kingdoms, rulers and simple Undead to continue the tradition started by Gwyn. When the First Flame drifted up to position itself on the nascent kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt;, Frampt or other serpents affiliated with his ideology reached the city too. \nOver time the serpents passed on the culture of linking the Flame to the royal family of Lothric, pushing them to preserve the tradition and actively produce heirs capable of becoming Lords of Cinder.\nFrampt or other serpents affiliated with his ideology, were represented in numerous statues, on par with the Three Pillars of Lothric, with elegant clothes and angel wings, showing how they had a central role within the kingdom and were considered \"divine messengers\". \nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Lothric%2C%20Younger%20Prince\"&gt;Prince Lothric&lt;/a&gt;'s refusal to link the Flame and the madness of &lt;a href=\"Oceiros%2C%20the%20Consumed%20King\"&gt;King Oceiros&lt;/a&gt;, the fate of the primordial serpents present in Lothric is unknown.\nEven after possibly hundreds of thousands years after the first linking of the Flame, Kaathe didn't stop trying to bring the Age of Dark. The serpent in fact took into his service what would become the three sisters at the helm of the Sable Church, &lt;a href=\"Liliane\"&gt;Liliane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yuria%20of%20Londor\"&gt;Yuria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Friede\"&gt;Elfriede&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe then directed their efforts to create a realm entirely inhabited by Hollows that could offer salvation to them.\nKaathe taught them his dark powers, and Londor carried out experiments aimed at understanding the Dark Sign and the Dark Soul under his watch. Their goal had in fact become to usurp the First Flame, tearing it from its Kiln and ensuring that it could be wielded to finally create a new Age of Man.\nTo this end, the Sable Church awaited the arrival of a chosen Unkindled, preparing to assist and guide him to ensure that he succeeded in their goal.\nHowever, before he could see his dream of a Age of Dark, Kaathe died of unknown causes, leaving the three sisters to continue to lead Londor and await the future Dark Lord. \nDuring the events of \"Dark Souls III\", when the First Flame was almost fading out, their fate or the number of their survivors is unknown.

Additionally, its &lt;a href=\"critical\"&gt;critical&lt;/a&gt; attacks can be lethal, dealing much more damage than a standard weapon of its class is capable of.\nHowever, it requires a sizable amount of &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; to be wielded effectively and is one of the heavier &lt;a href=\"Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;greatswords&lt;/a&gt; found in the game, at a weight of 15.0 units, making high &lt;a href=\"Vitality%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt; a necessity for builds that plan to utilize this weapon alongside heavier armor or weapons. Furthermore, the weapon has a very low amount of durability, so care should be taken not to overwork the weapon between bonfires. Should it break, however, it is very cheap to repair, costing only a minimal amount of &lt;a href=\"Souls%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; to do so.\nSince the weapon has no forms of scaling, it is an excellent candidate for a &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Stone\"&gt;Raw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"infusion\"&gt;infusion&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the weapon's maximum damage potential to be drawn out. &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Stone\"&gt;Enchanted&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Old%20Mundane%20Stone\"&gt;Mundane&lt;/a&gt; infusions will be worse in almost any situation, and are not recommended."}

Having high &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; or rolling can make fighting them easier. However, their rapid attacks can break poise surprisingly fast, or they may turn around and surprise the player after an attack is dodged. Engaging in direct combat isn't required at any point in the game. &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20Leeroy\"&gt;Paladin Leeroy&lt;/a&gt; can be summoned to fight them in &lt;a href=\"The%20Catacombs\"&gt;The Catacombs&lt;/a&gt; and the sewers of &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariamis\"&gt;The Painted World&lt;/a&gt; can be skipped by going to the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Dragon\"&gt;Undead Dragon&lt;/a&gt; and jumping down after defeating it.\nAttacking with a &lt;a href=\"Spears\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Thrusting%20Swords\"&gt;thrusting sword&lt;/a&gt; with a shield raised up is a very safe way of dealing with Bonewheel Skeletons.\nAs a group they are very dangerous, but individually they are easy to dispatch. It is best to attempt to draw them out one at a time, rather than try to engage them all at once. However, by standing on an elevated ledge, several skeletons can be lured into a group, setting up for an easy &lt;a href=\"Plunging%20Attack%23Dark%20Souls\"&gt;plunge attack&lt;/a&gt;."}

To do this, they must first get the &lt;a href=\"Repairbox\"&gt;Repairbox&lt;/a&gt; and the required number of Souls.\nAttune magic.\nAllows the player to select several &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;sorceries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;pyromancies&lt;/a&gt; to carry with them. The player must first find the appropriate sorcery/miracle/pyromancy to attune it.

These are mainly &lt;a href=\"Boss\"&gt;Boss&lt;/a&gt; bonfires, bonfires protected by &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Keeper\"&gt;Fire Keeper&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Covenant\"&gt;Covenant&lt;/a&gt; bonfires and the Lordvessel itself (after it's been placed).\nKindle.\nAllows the player to kindle the bonfire by sacrificing one Humanity to gain more estus flasks when resting at that bonfire.\nReverse Hollowing.\nRevives the player back to Human at the cost of one Humanity.\nMechanics.\nUpon resting at a bonfire, all enemies (unless otherwise specified) respawn and all traps reset. Players also refill five Estus Flasks. Players may kindle bonfires using Humanity in order to receive additional amounts of Estus Flasks (one humanity per kindling, can be kindled up to three times, up to 20 Estus Flasks collected). Bonfires may only be kindled past 10 after players obtain the &lt;a href=\"Rite%20of%20Kindling\"&gt;Rite of Kindling&lt;/a&gt;. Kindling a bonfire is a permanent action and carries through to &lt;a href=\"NG%2B\"&gt;NG+&lt;/a&gt; and beyond. Kindling a bonfire while online may give other players in other worlds who have last rested at the same bonfire one extra Estus charge. This allows players to exceed the usual limit of 20 Estus.\nSome bonfires have a fire keeper. Killing a fire keeper will put out the bonfire permanently until the next playthrough; players will be unable to relight it, the only exception being the &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt; bonfire, as its Fire Keeper can be revived.\nWhen killed, the player will respawn at the bonfire \"previously rested at\", not the closest bonfire. If no bonfire has been rested at the player is returned to their cell in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Undead%20Asylum\"&gt;Northern Undead Asylum&lt;/a&gt;. If Firelink Shrine has been reached, the player respawns at the bonfire in Firelink Shrine instead of their cell in the Northern Undead Asylum.\nUsing the miracle &lt;a href=\"Homeward\"&gt;Homeward&lt;/a&gt;, or the item &lt;a href=\"Homeward%20Bone\"&gt;Homeward Bone&lt;/a&gt;, will teleport the player back to the last bonfire he/she rested at. This counts as resting at the bonfire, so all spell casts will be recharged, Estus refilled, enemies respawned etc.\nBonfire locations.\nThere are a total of 43 bonfires in \"Dark Souls\" if the Lordvessel is considered to be a bonfire, and 44 bonfires in \"Dark Souls Remastered\". Of these, 20 (21 in \"Remastered\") can be warped to after acquiring the Lordvessel.\n&lt;a href=\"Oolacile\"&gt;Oolacile&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Prepare%20to%20Die%20Edition\"&gt;Prepare to Die Edition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Artorias%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Artorias of the Abyss&lt;/a&gt; DLC content only."}

They differ from regular bonfires in both appearance and function. The \"sword\" sticking from the pile of undead bones is broken, and they can only be used to teleport the player back to Majula, and will not repair weapons and restore health.

After &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Sulyvahn\"&gt;Sulyvahn&lt;/a&gt; imprisoned &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Dark Sun Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt;, proclaimed himself pontiff and assumed control of the city, they were ordered to serve under the tyrant as Outrider Knights in foreign campaigns, that was the equivalent to being exiled.\nThe pontiff would experiment on them, giving them his &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%27s%20Left%20Eye\"&gt;eye rings&lt;/a&gt;. While these rings would boost their attacks and recover their health as long as their fighting persists, those who peered inside the black orbs would be lured into visions of endless deadly battles and go insane, transformed into frenzied beasts. However the effect of the rings, whose black eyes constantly hound the knights, continues over time, first fusing their armor with their own hide and then devolving them into a literal &lt;a href=\"Sulyvahn%27s%20Beast\"&gt;beast&lt;/a&gt; under the complete control of the Pontiff. These knights, before being dispatched to foreign lands, were given these rings, with the power to transform them into savage, raving warriors who only knew how to serve as mindless guards, thus ensuring Sulyvahn total control over them and preventing them from betraying.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Lothric%2C%20Younger%20Prince\"&gt;Prince Lothric&lt;/a&gt; refused to link the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt; fell into ruin due to various internal problems, Sulyvahn would order a division of the Outirder Knights to reach Lothric under the command of the &lt;a href=\"Dancer%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Dancer of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vordt%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Vordt of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt;. Here they would positioned themselves in various strategic points of the city, infiltrating the &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; of the Lothric army, the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Undead Settlement&lt;/a&gt; located outside the walls, effectively controlling the places of command and movement of the kingdom.\nStrategy.\nOutrider Knights are usually initially unaware of the player, so use this opportunity to start the fight with a powerful attack. Once provoked, it is possible to wear them down with ranged weapons from a distance; however, they can close the gap very quickly so caution is advised. Unless the player has plenty of &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt;, it is recommended to evade their attacks rather than block them, as they rapidly drain &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll of their attacks inflict &lt;a href=\"Frost\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt; damage and can cause frostbite, which can be lethal if the player is unable to escape. They are very agile opponents and will often sidestep attacks, so a quick-use weapon is recommended.\nWhen they are far away from the player, they are very susceptible to ranged attacks and will just continue approaching very slowly without attacking. Headshots are especially effective and will stagger them heavily.\nThe one encountered in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Undead Settlement&lt;/a&gt; can be killed quite easily. Once reaching the bottommost area via an elevator, the player needs to send it back up to leave open a hole in the ground. They may then lure the Outrider Knight near it and run around it until he falls to his doom. The player will automatically receive the &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20Straight%20Sword\"&gt;Irithyll Straight Sword&lt;/a&gt; upon his demise. An alternative strategy is to pass through the door leading to the &lt;a href=\"Road%20of%20Sacrifices\"&gt;Road of Sacrifices&lt;/a&gt; and killing it with ranged attacks from a safe spot.\nThey are able to be parried and riposted, however, this can be tricky because they attack with such great speed.\nDrops.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Undead Settlement =\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The boulder travels a short distance before arcing towards the ground. If a foe is hit by the boulder during its travel arc, they will take heavy stagger, being knocked down if they are smaller &lt;a href=\"Enemies%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt;, and take 1.8 times the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Buff\"&gt;Spell Buff&lt;/a&gt; of the catalyst as &lt;a href=\"Physical%20damage\"&gt;Physical damage&lt;/a&gt;. When the boulder impacts with the ground, it will shatter in a moderate radius and inflict 1.1 times the Spell Buff of the catalyst as Physical damage to any nearby foes, as well as moderate stagger.\nWhen used against blocking opponents, the boulder's impact causes large &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; damage, potentially breaking their guard.\nStrategy.\nSingle player.\nDue to its low requirements and &lt;a href=\"FP\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt; cost, Boulder Heave is a very effective Pyromancy if used correctly. It can &lt;a href=\"stunlock\"&gt;stunlock&lt;/a&gt; certain foes if timed properly, and the shatter's &lt;a href=\"area-of-effect\"&gt;area-of-effect&lt;/a&gt; makes it a handy tool for dealing damage to crowds of enemies. As well, large enemies with spacious hitboxes and standing &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;, such as most &lt;a href=\"Boss%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt;, will not be knocked down by the arcing boulder, meaning that it is possible to hit them with both the boulder and the shatter, dealing the spell's full damage.\nOnline gameplay.\nThe main draw of this spell is that it has the same animation as various mist Pyromancies like &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Mist%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poison Mist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20Mist%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Toxic Mist&lt;/a&gt;, which allows it to be used to catch opponents who expect to run around a mist cloud but instead take a boulder to the face. However, as the spell is very short-ranged it can be relatively easy to interrupt by attacking the caster before its animation completes. The knockdown is a very powerful feature of the spell, as it pushes targets back as well as dealing damage, so with the proper positioning it is possible to knock enemy players off of ledges."}

This bow is \"very useful\" for &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt;-based builds/characters who wish to have a reliable ranged weapon when their own offensive &lt;a href=\"Miracles%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Miracles&lt;/a&gt; are exhausted.\nPlayers can get the most out of this bow by using &lt;a href=\"lightning%20arrow\"&gt;lightning arrow&lt;/a&gt;s, as it complements the bow's innate lightning damage.\nInteresting to note, pressing either the &lt;a href=\"Parry%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt; or the heavy attack button (if the Bow of Want is in your right or left hand, respectively) will use a special attack. This attack fires a bolt of lightning visually similar to a &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Sunlight Spear&lt;/a&gt;, at the cost of 10 &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; per use. The attack does significantly more damage than normal &lt;a href=\"Ammunition%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt;, and doesn't consume any arrows. In order to properly free aim this attack, you'll need to zoom in on where you're shooting first, before using the special attack.\nDespite it not having the full power of the miracle it appears to fire off, it still inflicts sizable damage, especially when reinforced to +5, and the spear-like projectiles are also capable of appreciable &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt; damage, and because of the lightning damage it will spread lightning around in water and does significant damage and also can cause players to lose their poise.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bracing%20Knuckle%20Ring\"&gt;Bracing Knuckle Ring&lt;/a&gt; +2 is also a great complement to the bow, as it will allow the player to use the Bow of Want's special attack a total of 13 times, before it breaks on the 14th use. Without the ring, the player will only have 6 total shots, before it breaks on the 7th."}

This can allow for much higher precision than relying on the lock-on system. With a bow equipped, press either the appropriate hand's &lt;a href=\"Controls\"&gt;weak attack button&lt;/a&gt;, or the stance change button to hold the bow in two hands. There is the option to fire the arrow normally by locking onto an enemy, or by entering a first-person aiming mode by pressing L1/LB/Left-shift. While in aiming mode, players can still move around freely to avoid incoming attacks, although they may only roll and walk slowly, unable to fire while doing so. They may also use \"up\" and \"down\" on the directional pad to zoom in and out, or the arrow keys on PC. Aiming manually allows the player to have full control over where the arrows are fired, which helps to strike specific parts of an enemy's body. This enables the arrow to get around any defenses they may have. &lt;a href=\"Headshot\"&gt;Headshot&lt;/a&gt;s score automatic &lt;a href=\"critical%20attack\"&gt;critical attack&lt;/a&gt;s, even against certain bosses. It is when executing headshots at maximum &lt;a href=\"range\"&gt;range&lt;/a&gt; that the power of bows truly shines.\nBows require &lt;a href=\"ammunition\"&gt;ammunition&lt;/a&gt; to be used. The ammunition equipped will directly affect the amount of damage inflicted, &lt;a href=\"damage%20type\"&gt;damage type&lt;/a&gt;, and range of the bow.\nAll bows have a &lt;a href=\"range\"&gt;range&lt;/a&gt; mechanic. The greater a bow's range, the further and straighter arrows will fly, and the more damage they will inflict. Certain bows, like the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Bow%20of%20Pharis\"&gt;Black Bow of Pharis&lt;/a&gt;, possess very high range, making them appropriate for sniping distant targets. Other bows, such as the &lt;a href=\"Composite%20Bow\"&gt;Composite Bow&lt;/a&gt;, have relatively short range, relegating them to closer quarters.\nThere are no \"general attacks\" for bows, short of aiming, pulling the bow string back, and shooting, as described above. Most actions unrelated to attacking will cancel or de-nock an arrow, including any form of movement while releasing the attack trigger/button.\nCategories.\nBows come in one of three categories: Short, Long and Great. The category the bow is in will define the bow's firing animation and mechanics. While the Great Bows clearly stand apart from the others, the difference between a short and long bow is more subtle.\nShort Bows.\nIncludes: the &lt;a href=\"Short%20Bow\"&gt;Short Bow&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Composite%20Bow\"&gt;Composite Bow&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Bow\"&gt;Darkmoon Bow&lt;/a&gt;. The short bows are the smallest of all the bow types. They are more geared toward \"combat\". Their fire rate is slightly higher than that of the long bows, allowing them to deal higher DPS. More importantly, the short bows draw their arrows much quicker, and fire \"much\" earlier in their \"fire cycle animation\". This makes it better suited for combat (and &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;), where a single arrow can be loosed, followed by an immediate roll.\nLong Bows.\nIncludes: the &lt;a href=\"Longbow\"&gt;Longbow&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Bow%20of%20Pharis\"&gt;Black Bow of Pharis&lt;/a&gt;. These are geared toward long range combat. They tend to have higher maximum range, but have lower fire rate, and (generally) lower damage. They work well in PvE where they can take out an opponent from a long range, or at least, before it comes too close. Unfortunately, they do take a fair amount of time to draw their arrow before firing. This makes them not as well suited for short range, mobile combat.\nGreat Bows.\nIncludes: the &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Greatbow\"&gt;Dragonslayer Greatbow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gough%27s%20Greatbow\"&gt;Gough's Greatbow&lt;/a&gt;. Huge bows with massive single-shot damage. They have a very low rate-of-fire. They are more often useful for their knock down ability, rather than the damage they deal.\nBows.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nDetailed=\nCondensed=\nUpgraded=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The brightstone stoke flame of the desires of the people of Tseldora, they became consumed by greed and lost in a eternal search for \u201cthat which they lacked\u201d, leading the town into ruin.\nEventually, the duke\u2019s pet, &lt;a href=\"The%20Duke%27s%20Dear%20Freja\"&gt;Freja&lt;/a&gt;, became possessed by the Writhing Ruin, an ancient being, likely the same one which the brigthstones came from, and began to feast on the twisted souls of the land to increase it\u2019s power. As the town was overrun by spiders, the Duke only silently stood by and watched with content before disappearing. "}

It has true \"Quality &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus\"&gt;Scaling\"&lt;/a&gt;, excellent speed, and a very versatile moveset. \nDo not be misled by the Broadsword's short range and lack of stabbing attacks. It is an exceptionally effective weapon, which, like most Straight Swords, is viable for a character's entire career. Its higher damage is especially noticeable with a few &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Modification\"&gt;upgrades&lt;/a&gt; pumped into it, as it will out-class the &lt;a href=\"Shortsword\"&gt;Shortsword&lt;/a&gt; fairly easily. This is especially important early on when it's far more important to bring &lt;a href=\"enemies\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; down quickly than it is to be able to wear them down. Its exact damage and scaling values are matched by its rare brothers, the &lt;a href=\"Darksword\"&gt;Dark Sword&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Straight%20Sword\"&gt;Sunlight Straight Sword&lt;/a&gt;. They boast better range, weigh 3 units and 1 unit more respectively, are substantially harder to get, and consume more &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%29%23Stamina\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; when swung. In trained hands, one can be surprised by just how effective this early-game weapon can be. Its main drawback is its short reach and its need for 27 Strength and 40 Dexterity to be at its full potential like all Quality Scaling weapons. Like the Dark Sword, the Broadsword can easily chain together its weak and strong attacks.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, players using Broadswords can be deceptively dangerous. The small size of the Broadsword can lead less-observant players into misreading it as a &lt;a href=\"Daggers\"&gt;Dagger&lt;/a&gt;, and a high-level character wielding an appropriately high-level Broadsword can easily trick would-be invaders into overextending themselves against what they thought was a weaker opponent.\nUpgrades.\nScaling Percentage Values.\nThe following chart lists the scaling percentages when this weapon is fully upgraded.

It possesses a fast swing speed and a low stamina consumption, as well as being lightweight, and having a versatile moveset.\nHowever, in close quarters, one should exercise caution with their environment, as the lack of a thrust attack will make using this weapon a hassle at times, as one may accidentally find themselves striking a wall or object due to the wide swings."}

In turn, the Broadsword features high base damage and good strength scaling, allowing the sword to deal formidable damage at any point in the game. Additionally, the broad slash attacks allow the sword to dispatch groups of enemies with ease. However, care should be taken when in tight corridors or near walls, as the sword is likely to bounce off of solid objects, rendering the wielder vulnerable for a brief moment.\nThe Broadsword also features a unique moveset, with the heavy attack (/) being a horizontal slash in front of the player. The one-handed variant also features a charge which is capable of moving the player great distances quickly to make up for the short reach of the weapon. Due to the attack's tracking, there is little to no risk that the wielder will charge past an opponent during this portion of the attack, and it will likely hit as long as the opponent does not dodge the attack. Furthermore, the charge can catch unwary opponents off-guard, allowing for free hits or even catching enemies in their dodge.\nUpgrades.\nReinforced with ."}

According to &lt;a href=\"Titchy%20Gren\"&gt;Titchy Gren&lt;/a&gt;, the members of the Brotherhood of Blood have a feud with the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Sentinels\"&gt;Blue Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, mainly due to the opposite objectives of both covenants.\nRequirements.\nThe player must speak to Titchy Gren with a &lt;a href=\"Token%20of%20Spite\"&gt;Token of Spite&lt;/a&gt;.\nHow to join.\nIn order to join this covenant, one must talk to &lt;a href=\"Titchy%20Gren\"&gt;Titchy Gren&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Purgatory\"&gt;Undead Purgatory&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Token%20of%20Spite\"&gt;Token of Spite&lt;/a&gt; in their inventory.

It refers to the bar that appears on screen when a player character receives a specific effect. When the bar is \"full\", the character is subject to the effect.\nEffects.\nThere are four effects that deal buildup:\nMechanics.\nIn terms of mechanics, buildup should not be seen as a bar that fills up. Rather, it should be seen as a translucent bar that starts full. The solid bar that appears from the left represents damage \"given\" to the bar, reducing it. Every time the player takes a specific buildup damage, a chunk of the bar is removed. The bar naturally regenerates at a fixed speed. If the bar reaches 0 and disappears (leaving only a solid block on screen), then the effect triggers.\nIncreasing resistances \"merely\" increases the length of the bar. It does not increase the bar's regeneration rate, nor reduce the status' effect. This means it will take more time for a specific attack to inflict a status effect, but it also means it will take that much more time for the resistance to fully regenerate.\nWhen equipping weapons or armor that increase resistances, the player's resistance bar will not instantaneously re-fill. This is most notable when equipping Gargoyle weapons and/or &lt;a href=\"Bloodbite%20Ring\"&gt;Blood&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Cursebite%20Ring\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Poisonbite%20Ring\"&gt;Poisonbite&lt;/a&gt; rings. Equipping these items will cause the resistance bar to appear because its max length has increased, and it can regenerate more. It does not actually inflict buildup: Repeatedly equipping/unequipping the item \"cannot\" cause the effect to trigger. This is a mechanic to prevent the player from equipping resistance items right before the effect triggers.\nThis also happens with armor, but it is more difficult to observe: As the player is in a menu, the player doesn't notice the bar appearing for a short period of time."}

He is guarded by many of his former knights who will do everything they can to protect their King.\nLore.\nThe Ivory King was once the ruler of &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Eleum%20Loyce\"&gt;Eleum Loyce&lt;/a&gt;. His origins are said to trace back to the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Forossa\"&gt;Forossa&lt;/a&gt;, where he served as a high ranking knight. The Ivory King was described as a compassionate and strong ruler, always the first to swing his sword in times of need for the good of his people or for his homeland. When a lost child of Dark named &lt;a href=\"Alsanna%2C%20Silent%20Oracle\"&gt;Alsanna&lt;/a&gt; sought to sustain herself using the powerful king, he granted her protection and comfort despite possibly knowing her true intentions.\nAt an unknown point, an &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Chaos\"&gt;ancient Chaos&lt;/a&gt; was discovered deep below the land. Legend holds that the Ivory King used his magnificent soul to build Eleum Loyce and contain the spread of Chaos. A grand cathedral was built in an attempt to appease the raging flame, but the Chaos would not be sated. As a precaution, various &lt;a href=\"Knight%20of%20Eleum%20Loyce\"&gt;knights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rampart%20Golem\"&gt;golems&lt;/a&gt; were posted throughout the Garrison Ward to lead the advance on the swollen flame on his orders. Other knights were ordered to delve into the depths of Chaos to exterminate the terrible things that dwelt there, but not one of the knights returned.\nEventually, the Ivory King sensed the degradation of his soul and left Eleum Loyce without a word, leaving everything to Alsanna. He traveled deep into the Chaos until he and his knights were corrupted by the flames. At some point after the King's departure, the ivory gates of the city were flung open, and the land grew cold and lifeless.\nSummons.\nThese summon signs will only appear once the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Priestess\"&gt;Eye of the Priestess&lt;/a&gt; has been obtained and when at least two Loyce Knights are available (It is only necessary to rescue one knight, as one is already available).\nFight overview.\nThe player will not immediately face the Ivory King after passing through the fog door and dropping into the Old Chaos. Instead, the player will face three waves of &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Loyce%20Knight\"&gt;Charred Loyce Knight&lt;/a&gt;s who will emerge from the three portals around the arena. The knights will be a random mix of halberd, sword, or pyromancy users. During the first wave, three Knights will spawn. After a short period of time, several more will spawn, then several more shortly thereafter.\nFinding the three uncorrupted &lt;a href=\"Knight%20of%20Eleum%20Loyce\"&gt;Knights&lt;/a&gt; from around Eleum Loyce will be an immense help in the fight. Throughout the entire battle, the Knights will periodically freeze the portals, preventing Charred Knights from spawning.\nOnce all of the Knights are dead, the Burnt Ivory King will appear from a massive portal that rises at the end of the arena. Note that the player will have a good amount of time between when the Knights are killed and when the King appears. If the player did not rescue at least two other Knights of Eleum Loyce, two of the portals will remain open and spawning Knights during the fight with the king, possibly proving to be a fatal distraction.\nKnight phase strategies.\nAs with all other \"mob\" style boss battles, it is vital that the player avoids getting surrounded by enemies. The player may also find it helpful to bring down the pyromancy Knight first so they won't have to worry about ranged attacks. Being careful and strategic with attacks can help the player conserve healing items for the fight with the actual boss.\nKing phase strategies.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Fume%20Knight\"&gt;Fume Knight&lt;/a&gt;, the Burnt Ivory King is fast, aggressive, and possesses a sword buff move that he will execute after a period of time. The buff will add magic damage to the King's sword and will provide him with both an impale attack and a small area of effect attack. When faced with multiple attackers, he has a tendency to switch targets without warning.\nAttacks.\nSword Buff: Periodically throughout the fight, the King will take a few seconds to buff his sword with magic. Unlike the &lt;a href=\"Smelter%20Demon\"&gt;Smelter Demon&lt;/a&gt;, he does not have enhanced defenses during this period, which offers the chance to attack him with impunity.\nIce Explosion: Only used when the King has buffed his sword. He will slam the point into the ground, emitting a series of highly-damaging ice spikes in a circle around himself. Easily avoided by moving back from the King when he turns his sword upside down.\nImpale: Only used with the buffed sword. Similar to &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Alonne\"&gt;Sir Alonne&lt;/a&gt;'s impale attack, the King will charge up for a moment before lunging at the player. If he connects, he will lift the player on his sword, draining a large amount of health, after which he'll throw the player away.\nLunging Slash: This attack will pass straight through shields when his sword is buffed, and is a danger because it will not knock the player down, opening the player up to his follow-up spin attack.\nJumping Spin: The King will jump into the air, spinning 360 degrees before slashing with his sword. He often uses this after his lunging slash.\nDefenses.\nBurnt Ivory King.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense.\nCharred Loyce Knights.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 Burnt Ivory King by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-ZqZWlzVUY&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

Instead, a second Caestus is equipped onto the player's other hand. Like all fist-based weapons, Caesti have a small range and can be easily punished by an enemy, should the player miss with their attacks. In addition, they possess a relatively low level of base damage, meaning that other weapons will likely outclass them in terms of damage output, especially as the player progresses through the game.\nHowever, Caesti possess very quick attack speeds, potentially allowing the player to more easily interrupt the actions of other players with them in close combat. The use of the &lt;a href=\"Perseverance%20%28skill%29\"&gt;Perseverance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skill\"&gt;Skill&lt;/a&gt; can also be assist with this, as it enables the user to boost their &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; and trade hits with other enemies for a short time."}

She accepted the knight &lt;a href=\"Morne\"&gt;Morne&lt;/a&gt; as her follower and later he became the apostle of the Archbishop of Carim and his influence spread together with that of his goddess, developing miracles dedicated to Caitha and leading the knights of Carim to adopt his armor and weapons. \nHowever, the clerics of Carim also began to freely devote themselves to the creation of &lt;a href=\"Cursebite%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;forbidden rings&lt;/a&gt; and to use &lt;a href=\"Caitha%27s%20Chime%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;chimes&lt;/a&gt; that drawn upon the intelligence of the user together with their faith to cast miracles that lean towards the Dark, whose existence is concelead in the name of the Archbishop of Carim for they are anathema, implying that the goddess leaves a lot of freedom for her clerics to investigate the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, Caitha continues to be dedicated to bringing comfort to suffering humans, and the forlorns revere her as their protector. Additionally, the &lt;a href=\"Caressing%20Tears\"&gt;Caressing Tears&lt;/a&gt; miracle became associated with her as a story recounting the many deaths surrounding the goddess, but that actually echoed a &lt;a href=\"Caressing%20Prayer\"&gt;miracle of dubious authenticity&lt;/a&gt; developed only during Drangleic times and that reinterpreted the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Remedy\"&gt;healing sorceries&lt;/a&gt; of the fallen civilization of New Londo.\nThe Way of White built a &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;cathedral&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to the goddess Caitha and with the aim of cleansing humans from the stagnant darkness within them that was becoming an ever-increasing problem, using the \"sacred and peaceful\" body of water on which the structure was built to contain all the remnants from its cleansing rituals and even sent three archdeacons to manage it. However, over time the abominations that arose from the &lt;a href=\"The%20Deep\"&gt;Deep&lt;/a&gt; accumulated in the cathedral led to the corruption of the faith of the clerics, who abandoned the cult of the goddess and covered her statues, to dedicate themselves to the veneration of the Deep and its Saint &lt;a href=\"Aldrich%2C%20Devourer%20of%20Gods\"&gt;Aldrich, Devourer of Gods&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheories.\nIt can be theorized that Caitha is actually a \"reformed\" and \"cleansed\" version of &lt;a href=\"Velka%2C%20Goddess%20of%20Sin\"&gt;Velka, Goddess of Sin&lt;/a&gt;"}

Following up with the strong attack will bring the hammer around for a powerful downward slamming attack, inflicting 180% of the weapon's attack rating as damage and scattering the stones in a radius around the impact point, with each stone dealing 65% of the weapon's attack rating as physical damage and ending the buff.\nShould the second phase follow-up not be used to scatter the stones, they will remain embedded in the head of the hammer, granting the 7.5% attack rating buff for up to 40 seconds. Performing a fully-charged strong attack will scatter the stones upon impact and end the buff.\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nPerforming the first phase of this skill can augment the weapon's already impressive damage to absurd levels, giving the wielder extreme destructive power for up to 40 seconds. As with other skills, regular use of this attack will require the wielder to invest in &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Attunement&lt;/a&gt;, constantly wear the &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Ring\"&gt;Farron Ring&lt;/a&gt; or have a &lt;a href=\"Simple%20Gem\"&gt;Simple&lt;/a&gt;-infused off-hand equipped at all times.\nAs the buff will dissipate after 40 seconds, the stones can be used for one final attack by performing a fully-charged strong attack to unleash the stones for additional damage.\nOnline gameplay.\nWhile its nature as an ultra great hammer grants Ledo's Great Hammer with excessive amounts of &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; health, there may be situations where resetting Poise health to full and temporarily augmenting it may be necessary during trades.

Later, however, additional weaker Capra Demons can be found in the Demon Ruins as regular .\nDescription.\nCapra Demons wield two &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Great%20Machete\"&gt;Demon Great Machete&lt;/a&gt;s, hooked &lt;a href=\"Ultra%20Greatswords\"&gt;Ultra Greatswords&lt;/a&gt; that are made from cast iron. The demons themselves are large humanoids with four red-glowing eyes and a horned skull for a head. They each possess a\u00a0bone tail, and have exposed shoulder blades and spines. They also wear a ragged skirt made of straw.\nLore.\nThe Capra Demons are lesser &lt;a href=\"Demon%20%28lore%29\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; spawned from the &lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, the entity that appeared following the attempt of the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Witch of Izalith&lt;/a&gt; to make a power similar to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; using her &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Soul\"&gt;Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt;. The attempt was successful and she create the &lt;a href=\"Flame%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Flame of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; but Izalith and her powerful soul became a seedbed for a new lifeform: the mother and source of all demons. After their birth, many Capra Demons managed to survive the war that the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Knight\"&gt;Silver Knight&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; waged against their kind and at some point one of them was able to escape from the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Izalith\"&gt;Lost Izalith&lt;/a&gt;, bringing its two &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Great%20Machete\"&gt;Demon Great Machetes&lt;/a&gt;, made of cast iron, with it. This demon managed to reach the lower section of the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Burg\"&gt;Undead Burg&lt;/a&gt;, a fortified town created for &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; that fell into ruin and made the area into its domain, even taking control of two &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Dog\"&gt;Attack Dog&lt;/a&gt;s. Many other Capra Demons continued to inhabit their &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Ruins\"&gt;ancient home&lt;/a&gt; even if reduced to ruins.\nStrategy.\nUndead Burg.\nThe boss version of the Capra Demon battles the player in a small, confined room which makes it harder to recuperate &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;. It is best for the player to\u00a0eliminate the two Attack Dogs as quickly as possible as they may stun-lock low &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; players and can also trap players in a corner. Climbing the staircase will enable the player to attack the boss with ranged weapons and give them an opportunity to recover; however, the boss can still reach the player. Players can climb the set of stairs and walk onto the protruding archway over the door at the far end of the room to recover safely. The Capra Demon will climb the stairs after you, but will be blocked by the low railing and miss its swings as long as the player is standing on the far end of the arch. Should the player have sorceries or pyromancy available to them, they can remain on the archway and batter the Capra Demon from out of its range, moving to the very corner of the archway to avoid being hit by its leap attack after it climbs the stairs. The Capra Demon has a long recovery time every time it lands after jumping, so if one lures it up the stairs and baits it into jumping off, the player can use that opportunity to deal decent amounts of damage. The Capra Demon is weak to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, so &lt;a href=\"Charcoal%20Pine%20Resin\"&gt;Charcoal Pine Resin&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Firebomb\"&gt;Firebomb&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0can be effective, though &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Pine%20Resin\"&gt;Gold Pine Resin&lt;/a&gt; is a better choice as it add higher AR and deals more damage as a result. \nWearing armor with high &lt;a href=\"Physical%20Damage\"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; protection and poise will prove very useful against Capra Demon as all of its damage is physical. Weapons with high damage that aren't slow are also useful, as the fight revolves around mobility. If the weapon also has high &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; damage, this will help in stunning the Capra Demon out of attacks. High &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt; shields will be helpful in blocking a majority of its attacks.\nAn easy way to defeat the Capra Demon consists of equipping the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Fog\"&gt;Ring of Fog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Slumbering%20Dragoncrest%20Ring\"&gt;Slumbering Dragoncrest Ring&lt;/a&gt; before traversing the fog gate, this way the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Dog\"&gt;Attack Dog&lt;/a&gt;s will ignore the player completely and the boss can be fought without the dogs attacking as long as the player stays within the first half of the boss arena. \nDemon Ruins.\nThe Lesser Capra Demons fought in the Demon Ruins are much more simple to handle as the player has more room to maneuver. Players may lure them over with ranged weapons as fighting two at once may be challenging.\nBoss Information.\nAttacks.\nSingle Slash.\nThe Capra Demon swings with either of its swords. It can be avoided by rolling.\nDouble Swing.\nVery similar to the Single Swing, however, the Capra Demon swings with one sword after the other in a two-hit combo. Deals heavy damage, or heavy stamina drain if the player is hit while blocking.\nLeaping Smash.\nUsed when the player is far away from the Demon. It jumps towards the target, then smashes its two swords into the ground upon landing. This attack can be blocked with a strong shield or it can be dodged by rolling away.\nLeft Sword Smash.\nA quick strike from its left side causes heavy stamina drain when blocked, but can be dodged by rolling towards the Demon.\nDual Slash.\nIt holds its two blades together and pulls them back to slash into the ground. This attacks does heavy stamina damage when blocked, and is easily dodged.\nPower Smash.\nThe Capra Demon's strongest attack. It raises its swords above its head, then brings them down in a vertical smash. It cannot be blocked, and deals heavy damage to the player. However, it has an obvious animation and a long wind-up time, so it is easy to dodge.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls \u2014 Centipede Demon by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7wweUWFZKc&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

He is voiced by .\nDescription.\nCaptain Drummond is a high-ranking official in &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt;'s Royal Army. He has long, laid-back, blonde hair and a goatee. Drummond wears the Drangleic set (without the helm) and wields the &lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Sword\"&gt;Drangleic Sword&lt;/a&gt; and the Drangleic Shield. His face is covered in blood and scars as a result of the battle against the &lt;a href=\"Giants\"&gt;Giants&lt;/a&gt;.\nRegarding his personality, Drummond was known for being an honorable knight and faithfully loyal servant to King &lt;a href=\"Vendrick\"&gt;Vendrick&lt;/a&gt;. When he was ordered to protect the fort from the upcoming assault by the Giants, Drummond obeyed without hesitation. However, after the vast majority of soldiers under his command perished in the ensuing battle against the Giants, Drummond started to question Vendrick's actions and he asked himself if this war was really necessary.\nLore.\nFor many generations, Drummond's ancestors have been in charge of protecting the &lt;a href=\"Cardinal%20Tower\"&gt;Cardinal Tower&lt;/a&gt; and Drummond himself followed their steps. After Vendrick stole a prized possession from the Giants, the latter crossed the sea and started a war against Drangleic's forces in order to retrieve what was stolen from them.\nDrummond was assigned with the protection of the Cardinal Tower, a military fort located on the edge of the kingdom. Although Drummond and his forces fought valiantly against their foes, they were no match for the Giants and Drangleic's soldiers were slaughtered.\nAfter the massacre, Drummond became one of the very few survivors. Drummond failed his mission and the fort was taken over by the Giants. However, when all hope was lost, he was visited by a mysterious hero.\nPlot.\nDrummond can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Vammar\"&gt;Memory of Vammar&lt;/a&gt;. In order to gain entrance to the memory, one must talk to the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Dragon\"&gt;Ancient Dragon&lt;/a&gt; back in the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shrine\"&gt;Dragon Shrine&lt;/a&gt;, who will give the player the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Mist%20Heart\"&gt;Ashen Mist Heart&lt;/a&gt;. With the Heart in their possession, the player must go to the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20of%20Fallen%20Giants\"&gt;Forest of Fallen Giants&lt;/a&gt; and interact with the &lt;a href=\"Tree%20of%20Giants\"&gt;Tree of Giants&lt;/a&gt; located close to where &lt;a href=\"Pate\"&gt;Pate&lt;/a&gt; was found for the first time.\nThe player will meet an exhausted Drummond early in the Memory; he is in the first large room, lying down to the right of the door. If the player talks to him, he will explain the events which led to the war against the Giants. He will also command the player to slay the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Lord\"&gt;Giant Lord&lt;/a&gt;. After exhausting his dialogue, he will be available for summoning for the fight against the Giant Lord in the &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Jeigh\"&gt;Memory of Jeigh&lt;/a&gt;. His summon sign is located next to the fog gate.\nIf the player speaks with Drummond, he will order his men to stand down and allow them to pass. The soldiers encountered in the memories from this point forward will not be hostile to the player and will assist them in fighting the Giants. However, if the player attacks a soldier, even accidentally, they will all turn hostile again and will remain hostile for the rest of the playthrough, even if the player speaks to Drummond again.\nAfter defeating the Giant Lord, he will give the player the &lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Helm\"&gt;Drangleic Helm&lt;/a&gt;, which allows the player to obtain the \"Holder of the Fort\" achievement/trophy. The rest of his equipment is found in the Forest of Fallen Giants after &lt;a href=\"the%20Pursuer\"&gt;the Pursuer&lt;/a&gt;'s arena, in a corpse. This implies that Drummond finally met his demise at the hands of the Giants."}

The knights of Carim are famous for fighting without a shield, in preference to using &lt;a href=\"Parrying%20Dagger\"&gt;Parrying Dagger&lt;/a&gt;s equipped in their left hands. \nOne of the most influential figures, creator of multiple artifacts, is &lt;a href=\"Arstor%2C%20Earl%20of%20Carim\"&gt;Sir Arstor&lt;/a&gt;. He was the \"Earl of Carim\", thus implying an important role in the country's governance and was known by the title \"Impaler\" and that created the weapons known as &lt;a href=\"Shotel\"&gt;Shotel&lt;/a&gt;s. Arstor also experimented on humans and managed to create &lt;a href=\"Purging%20Stone\"&gt;Purging Stone&lt;/a&gt;s capable of absorbing curses and breaking their influence, as human beings are helpless against curses and can only deflect their effects, and which became one of Arstor's treasures. With a similar system he created &lt;a href=\"Cursebite%20Ring\"&gt;Cursebite Ring&lt;/a&gt;s capable of preventing curses, &lt;a href=\"Bloodbite%20Ring\"&gt;Bloodbite Ring&lt;/a&gt;s capable of preventing bleeding and &lt;a href=\"Poisonbite%20Ring\"&gt;Poisonbite Ring&lt;/a&gt;s capable of preventing poison, all rings about which dreadful rumors circulate surrounding their creations.\nAt least &lt;a href=\"Oswald%20of%20Carim\"&gt;one of the priests&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Velka%2C%20Goddess%20of%20Sin\"&gt;Velka, Goddess of Sin&lt;/a&gt; comes from Carim. He wears a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Set\"&gt;uniformly black attire&lt;/a&gt; and wields an &lt;a href=\"Velka%27s%20Rapier\"&gt;enchanted blade&lt;/a&gt; both infused with the mystical power of Velka and his purpose is to listen to the confessions of humans that sinned against the gods, urging reflection but also offering salvation and pardoning them of their sins. The pardoner seems to have no problem selling rings created from experiments on humans or through the sacrifical rites in the name of his goddess.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver time the region of Carim became a land of clerics and miracles and took on greater and greater importance in the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20White\"&gt;Way of White&lt;/a&gt;, to the point that the local religious leader obtained the title of \"Archbishop\". In Carim the Way of White had great cultural growth, resuming not only training maidens and missions in distant lands but even Firekeepers who could support the tradition of Linking of the First Flame. Thus the study and reading of the ancient legends from the sacred books by the widely recognized saints continued. Furthermore, the faith placed in the words of the blind became important, to the point of producing Braille tomes filled with advanced miracles.\nAt some point the knight &lt;a href=\"Morne\"&gt;Morne&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Carim and became the Apostle of the Archbishop and together they labored to bring comfort to the suffering Morne introduced Carim to &lt;a href=\"Caitha%2C%20Goddess%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Caitha, Goddess of Tears&lt;/a&gt;, his goddess whom he had served with dedication, spreading her healing &lt;a href=\"Caressing%20Tears\"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt; and her cult. Over time Morne's influence grew to such an extent that Carim's cathedral was decorated with lined stone heads modeled on his helm and knights who demonstrated the most strength and faith were bestowed with replicas of his armor and hammer. The story of how he had served Caitha also became of inspiration for the knights of Carim that would dedicate their entire career to attend a single maiden. \nHowever, the clerics of Carim also began to freely devote themselves to the creation of &lt;a href=\"Cursebite%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;ancient forbidden rings&lt;/a&gt; and to use &lt;a href=\"Caitha%27s%20Chime%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;chimes&lt;/a&gt; that drawn upon the intelligence of the user together with their faith to cast miracles that lean towards the Dark, whose existence is concelead in the name of the Archbishop of Carim for they are anathema, implying that the goddess leaves a lot of freedom for her clerics to investigate the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt;."}

What the player passes through are only the &lt;a href=\"Catacombs%20of%20Carthus\"&gt;catacombs&lt;/a&gt; of the ancient kingdom. \nLore.\nCarthus is a desert kingdom where pyromancers developed their knowledge in isolation from other forms, evolving differently and &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Swordsman%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;warriors&lt;/a&gt; utilized curved swords forged from &lt;a href=\"Sharp%20Gem\"&gt;special titanite&lt;/a&gt; developed incredible sword techniques and were able to move as weightlessly as a grain of sand. The warriors of Carthus value victory so much that they don't shun the use of pyromancy to enhance their weapons and create even twisted pyromancies like &lt;a href=\"Acid%20Surge%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;acid surges&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point the giant humanoid &lt;a href=\"High%20Lord%20Wolnir\"&gt;Wolnir&lt;/a&gt; rose to power in Carthus and its knights would swore blind loyalty to him, dedicating their lives to their King, becoming ruthless and bloody. Under this new tyrant, Carthus' kingdom became so aggressive and expansive that it was likened to uncontrollable fire and its beacons were used as war signals and the warriors of Carthus, with their superior combat skills and their &lt;a href=\"Carthus%20Flame%20Arc\"&gt;fighting pyromancy&lt;/a&gt;, conquered most of the known kingdoms. Wolnir thus conquered and destroyed every other kingdom around Carthus, making the various \"crowns\" that ruled different lands into a single one, and thus ascending to \"High Lord\". At some point High Lord Wolnir stripped three armlets and a holy sword from the corpses of some clerics, demonstrating how religion and gods counted for nothing in his kingdom.\nConsumed by power, Wolnir wished to outlive every other being and become the last of the dead and sentenced his entire empire to death, slaughtering both civilians and soldiers . Following this massacre the Catacombs of Carthus, an immense underground necropolis, were built to keep and bury the bones of countless people and soldiers. High Lord Wolnir would then use necromancy to reanimate himself and control a skeleton army and empire, wishing to remain the last being. Following this an &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt; would open in the Catacombs of Carthus and Wolnir fell into it, experiencing the terror of true darkness and making him plead to the gods for the first time , leading the sword and three sacred armlets he once stole to give him a semblace of comfort and preventing him from being corrupted by the Abyss, which was barely contained in a magical artifact. After falling into the Abyss, Wolnir discovered a form of pyromancy that uses the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Soul\"&gt;Dark Soul&lt;/a&gt; and since it was connected with humanity it gained a will of its own. The pyromancers that had become the guardians of the catacombs would discover Wolnir's &lt;a href=\"Black%20Serpent\"&gt;dark flame&lt;/a&gt;, born from the Abyss and shadowless, and started using it. \nDue to the land movements caused by the fading of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, the ruins of Carthus would be submerged underground and only its catacombs complex survives, drifting all the way beneath the &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Keep\"&gt;Farron Keep&lt;/a&gt; and the only cultural legacy of Carthus surviving in the outer world would remain its &lt;a href=\"Kukri\"&gt;kukris&lt;/a&gt;. Recently a huge &lt;a href=\"Carthus%20Sand%20Worm\"&gt;sand worm&lt;/a&gt; entered the territory of the Carthus catacombs and the grave wardens of Carthus used pellets made from crushed bugs to repel the worm, driving it deeper until the creature descended to the &lt;a href=\"Smouldering%20Lake\"&gt;Smouldering Lake&lt;/a&gt; and made it its domain."}

It affects the entire startup animation. In the adjoined video you can count frames and see the animations only differentiate before bringing the chime up to the character's left side.\nCasting speed affects all types of magic, and appears to get diminishing returns on quick casting magic. This means that spells like &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Soul Arrow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Resonant%20Soul\"&gt;Resonant Soul&lt;/a&gt; will get only a marginal boost after a certain level of casting speed, while slower magic like &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Lightning Spear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Storm%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Chaos Storm&lt;/a&gt; will cast considerably faster with higher casting speed.\nAll catalysts also have their own casting speeds. This speed affects the speed of the cast equally to the player's stat. Examples of catalysts with high casting speed are &lt;a href=\"Caitha%27s%20Chime\"&gt;Caitha's Chime&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Chime\"&gt;Dragon Chime&lt;/a&gt;. It is also possible to increase casting speed by wearing a &lt;a href=\"Clear%20Bluestone%20Ring\"&gt;Clear Bluestone Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nMechanics.\nDespite what the menu says, Casting Speed is simply a percentage that multiplies how long the startup of a spell will last. The menu numbers are only usable in so far as telling you what stats can affect natural casting speed.\nThe menu implies a softcap for casting speed from leveling while it actuality it doesn't exist.\nYour natural Casting Speed level is determined by your Attunement, Intelligence and Faith levels, with the formula:\nformula_1\nEach Spell has a defined startup duration, which is the part that can be affected by casting speed. Every Spell Casting Tool has a value that multiplies your natural casting speed. Every piece of Casting Gear has a value that multiplies your natural casting.\nYour total casting speed is the product of multiplying your natural Casting Speed with each piece of casting gear being used and the Spell Casting Tool that is being used.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CpXQ5QXNQ7AFr9ujRIVtkvUszoI7Kr-DyEucLJd_oTo/edit%3Fusp%3Dsharing\"&gt;Link to a datasheet that can calculate casting speed.&lt;/a&gt;"}

Those players will be sent to invade the worlds of non-Forest Hunter players who enter &lt;a href=\"Darkroot%20Garden%23Darkroot%20Forest\"&gt;Darkroot Forest&lt;/a&gt; to kill them.\nUnlike normal invasions, the Forest Hunter invasions can be performed even by &lt;a href=\"hollow\"&gt;hollow&lt;/a&gt; players and from anywhere in the game world (except for those areas without an associated boss, such as &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Gwynevere%2C%20Princess%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Gwynevere&lt;/a&gt;'s chamber in &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;). There is no level restriction, meaning someone of low level such as 40 can invade anyone, so they could be paired with a level 200. The &lt;a href=\"invaders\"&gt;invaders&lt;/a&gt; lose nothing should they fail, including their non-hollowed state. Invaders who die will be returned to the last &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt; they visited with all &lt;a href=\"Equipment\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Humanity%20Mechanic\"&gt;humanity&lt;/a&gt; intact.\nRemoving the ring when in the target's world will not cause the player to return to their homeworld.\nSuccessfully killing a player as a Forest Hunter invader will raise the Forest Hunter's rank and reward them with an item.\nThe Cat Covenant Ring stays with the player if they leave or betray the covenant, but will not function while not formally affiliated.\nIf the ring is lost by any means, it will reappear in the chest behind &lt;a href=\"Kingseeker%20Frampt\"&gt;Kingseeker Frampt&lt;/a&gt; after reloading an area."}

As such, it is filled with &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Skeletons&lt;/a&gt; of various types and other underground-dwelling unpleasantries.\nThe entrance hall overlooks a deep chasm that is spanned by a bridge and a stairway. Most of the chambers are accessed by crossing the bridge and navigating to the stairway on the other side, but a shortcut can be taken by dropping down on the right of the entrance.\nThe Catacombs are sprawling and maze-like, and hide many &lt;a href=\"Environmental%20Hazards%23Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;hazards&lt;/a&gt; such as arrow traps activated by pressure plates, animated &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Boulder\"&gt;rolling boulders&lt;/a&gt;, and jars filled with harmful pursuing spirits. Successfully navigating these challenges will let you reach the lower caverns, natural formations that are distinct from the constructed chambers.\nIn these caverns, a strained, rickety rope bridge spans the gap between the catacombs and &lt;a href=\"High%20Lord%20Wolnir\"&gt;High Lord Wolnir&lt;/a&gt;'s tomb. While safe to walk on, this bridge will snap and fall apart if any part of it is struck, and anyone on it will risk falling into the deep pit below if they do not manage to cross promptly. This makes combat on the bridge highly risky.\nIn the tomb, &lt;a href=\"High%20Lord%20Wolnir\"&gt;Wolnir&lt;/a&gt; is initially nowhere to be found. Only a skull goblet on a stone table can be found. Touching the goblet will cause the &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt; to start pouring out of it to the point of engulfing the entire room. &lt;a href=\"High%20Lord%20Wolnir\"&gt;Wolnir&lt;/a&gt;, who fell into the Abyss, will then appear. Once he is defeated, the Abyss recedes and the door to &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt; will open.\nReturning to the bridge on the side of &lt;a href=\"High%20Lord%20Wolnir\"&gt;Wolnir&lt;/a&gt;'s tomb allows access to the lowest chambers of the catacombs, by breaking the bridge and using it to climb down. A &lt;a href=\"Demon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt; awaits here, and beyond it lies the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Smouldering%20Lake\"&gt;Smouldering Lake&lt;/a&gt;."}

Pressing &lt;a href=\"Controls\"&gt;R1/RB or L1/LB&lt;/a&gt; (depending on which side the catalyst is equipped) will cast the selected spell. Depending on the catalyst, pressing R2/RT or L2/LT may result in either a &lt;a href=\"strike\"&gt;strike&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"thrust\"&gt;thrust&lt;/a&gt; attack.\nEach catalyst has a &lt;a href=\"magic%20adjustment\"&gt;magic adjustment&lt;/a&gt; stat that determines the power of the sorceries cast with the catalyst.

People from Catarina usually are of a dark complexion and in Northern Catarina people commonly have gray eyes and hair.\nThe Knights of Catarina wear distinctive &lt;a href=\"Catarina%20Set\"&gt;onion-shaped armor&lt;/a&gt; with a design that made it very effective for deflecting blows thanks to its masterfully forged curves . Outside their country they are often ridiculed for their appearance, causing the fury of the proud knights that continue to keep their very effective protections. Their &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Shield\"&gt;round shields&lt;/a&gt; have a large protrusion in the center that can be used as a thrust weapon since their armors are already designed to parry their opponents. Catarina also produced &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Tearstone%20Ring\"&gt;Blue Tearstone Ring&lt;/a&gt;s using rare blue gems with the uncanny ability to sense the imminent death of its wearer and increase their defenses when they were in danger.\nWhile Catarina obviously worshiped the gods and &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn&lt;/a&gt;, its culture and miracles existed outside of the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20White\"&gt;Way of White&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Allfather%20Lloyd\"&gt;Allfather Lloyd&lt;/a&gt;'s control. Its &lt;a href=\"Emit%20Force\"&gt;traditional fighting miracles&lt;/a&gt; were in fact an alternate branching of their &lt;a href=\"Force\"&gt;Force&lt;/a&gt; and were able to emit an expanding shockwave orb.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the region and times of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; the knowledge of Catarina survived in the form of old tales that spoke about its brave knights, that wore their peculiar &lt;a href=\"Catarina%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;onion-shaped armor&lt;/a&gt;, and how they rushed courageously into battle.\nThe ancient &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Tearstone%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Blue Tearstone Rings&lt;/a&gt; originating from Catarina, in Drangleic were instead associated with the goddess &lt;a href=\"Caitha%2C%20Goddess%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Caitha&lt;/a&gt;, who mourned those who had lost loved ones by shedding pure tears of blue and it was said that the stone set in those rings was one such tear.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the times of &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt; Catarina remained an active political and cultural entity capable of maintaining the identity of its knights. In fact they still wear their &lt;a href=\"Catarina%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;onion-shaped armor&lt;/a&gt; which, even if often ridiculed for its peculiar shape, had a design that made it very effective for deflecting blows thanks to its masterfully forged curves. The &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;ancient round shields&lt;/a&gt; also remained in use among their knights, still employing a large, shaped spike to skewer opponents. \nDespite the many centuries that have passed, Catarina remains known for being a land of festivity and drinks and whose people are typically oustpoken, and that they will not bottle their emotions, instead venting anger and the like with confidence. The knights of Catarina continue to worship the &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt; and employ their &lt;a href=\"Emit%20Force%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;traditional fighting miracles&lt;/a&gt; capable of releasing a shockwave in front. At least one of its knights tried to link the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, even if he failed and turned into an &lt;a href=\"Unkindled\"&gt;Unkindled&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt a certain point Catarina came into contact, on a conflict or diplomatic level, with the &lt;a href=\"Profaned%20Capital\"&gt;Profaned Capital&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Yhorm%20the%20Giant\"&gt;Yhorm the Giant&lt;/a&gt;, the ruler of the city became a great friend of the knight &lt;a href=\"Siegward%20of%20Catarina\"&gt;Siegward&lt;/a&gt; to whom, before facing his fate as a &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord of Cinder&lt;/a&gt; and linking the First Flame, made him promise to kill him if he were ever exhumed from his grave, gifting him a &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Ruler\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; capable of killing him easily."}

They were, in fact, the personal guard of &lt;a href=\"Oceiros%2C%20the%20Consumed%20King\"&gt;King Oceiros&lt;/a&gt; of Lothric, and most likely the personal guard of Lothric's kings. As a proof of this, not only other identical knights can be found in in the &lt;a href=\"Consumed%20King%27s%20Garden\"&gt;Consumed King's Garden&lt;/a&gt;, with the only difference of the former ones wearing blue robes and tunics, as the distinct colour of the Royal Family's Guard in Lothric, but their own shields are decorated with \"an emblem of an old king of Lothric\". This testifies the strong connection and alliance that linked Lothric with the Way of White and the government of Anor Londo (Irithyll) before Prince Lothric renouced his role as Lord of Cinder and despised the link of fire, but it also tells about how great and spreaded was the concern of the Cathedral getting increasingly swallowed and corrupted by the Depths: so much that Lothric's king decided to send a regiment of his personal guard to keep the order within the Cathedral and to eliminate every threat to its stability and integrity.\nStrategy.\nThe knights wielding &lt;a href=\"Great%20Mace\"&gt;maces&lt;/a&gt; are capable of buffing their weapon with a variant of &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20Weapon\"&gt;Blessed Weapon&lt;/a&gt;, which creates small orbs of light that will explode after a short delay. They can also cast &lt;a href=\"Perseverance\"&gt;Perseverance&lt;/a&gt; to greatly improve their defensive power, becoming considerably more aggressive in the process. When they get low on health and are not being immediately attacked, they can pause to cast a healing spell to recover health and buff themselves with a slow heal over time. The Blessed Weapon buff and heal leave them exposed for a few seconds, and it is possible to stagger them out of it, as well as remove the buffs with a &lt;a href=\"Duel%20Charm\"&gt;Duel Charm&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey will also occasionally attempt to &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Bash\"&gt;shield bash&lt;/a&gt; the player with their &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20Knight%20Greatshield\"&gt;greatshields&lt;/a&gt;, which they usually perform if they approach the player with their shield up. However, they can also be caught with &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Break\"&gt;guard breaks&lt;/a&gt; when pacing side-to-side with their shield up, leading to easy &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;ripostes&lt;/a&gt;.\nA variant of the mace-wielding knight that carries a &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Crossbow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt; can be encountered on the rafters. It will continually snipe at the player with the crossbow until they reach melee range, at which point it will switch to the mace.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20Knight%20Greatsword\"&gt;ultra greatsword&lt;/a&gt;-wielding variant is considerably more deadly, as on top of being far more aggressive their weapon has a longer reach and deals much more damage. They have a wide variety of horizontal swings, so good dodging is necessary to avoid them. They also possess a kick attack, which is capable of dealing significant damage while knocking the player down a considerable distance. Getting behind them in between their swings can allow the player to land &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;backstabs&lt;/a&gt; relatively easily."}

This, combined with its relatively low &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; requirement and early availability (players can obtain it at the Cathedral of the Deep, before defeating their first &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;), makes it an economical choice for players who want a greatshield that is effective against physical damage sources.\nThe other main characteristic of the Cathedral Knight Greatshield is its high &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; defense, making it effective against attacks and spells of that nature. It is tied with &lt;a href=\"Havel%27s%20Greatshield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Havel's Greatshield&lt;/a&gt; for the highest Dark defense among greatshields (only being beat by the &lt;a href=\"Crest%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Crest Shield&lt;/a&gt;, which is a medium shield), while having a significantly lower weight and Strength requirement. This makes it a very useful shield to face enemies in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ringed%20City\"&gt;Dark Souls III: The Ringed City&lt;/a&gt;\", particularly against &lt;a href=\"Darkeater%20Midir\"&gt;Darkeater Midir&lt;/a&gt;, whose physical attacks deal partial Dark damage.\nHowever, its non-Dark elemental absorption can be found wanting, as it is barely capable of blocking 60% of other damage types. When facing threats that are capable of dealing other types of elemental damage, it may be wise to rely on a different shield.\nDescription.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Official translation=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;"}

It possesses an almost identical moveset, save for a &lt;a href=\"Thrust%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;thrusting&lt;/a&gt; two-handed strong attack that has good reach and is useful for counter-hits and fighting in corridors where swings may take the wielder off-balance. Its main strength is that it deals &lt;a href=\"Strike%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Strike&lt;/a&gt; damage with its regular attacks, which is poorly resisted by plate metal armor and thus making it strong against players that equip heavy armor to increase their &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;. It also weighs significantly less than the Greatsword, at 15 units, making it easier to fit onto builds that do not heavily invest into &lt;a href=\"Vitality%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt;. However, it has a shorter reach than the Greatsword and falls short in Attack Rating, struggling to reach the 600-range without heavy stat investments and infusion with a &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Gem\"&gt;Heavy Gem&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf one manages to catch another player with the two-handed weak attack, it is possible to chain into the thrust while they are stunned, rather than another weak attack.

However, its defining characteristic here is its high resistance to &lt;a href=\"Strike%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Strike&lt;/a&gt; damage and comparatively weak resistance to &lt;a href=\"Slash%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Slash&lt;/a&gt; damage, which is normally the reverse for plate metal sets. Similarly, it is very resistant to &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage, being its second-highest elemental resistance next to &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;. Its resistance to &lt;a href=\"Negative%20Status%20Effects%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;status effects&lt;/a&gt; is respectable for its weight.\nIt has a strong &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt;-to-weight ratio that allows it to even weather attacks from &lt;a href=\"Great%20Hammers%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Great Hammers&lt;/a&gt;."}

The Cleansing Chapel is a hub, reachable from many points within the Cathedral.

One is surrounded by numerous pieces of &lt;a href=\"Writhing%20Rotten%20Flesh\"&gt;Writhing Rotten Flesh&lt;/a&gt;, which can greatly impede you while trying to fight the giant. It guards a stairway to a raised plateau with an altar to &lt;a href=\"Aldrich%2C%20Devourer%20of%20Gods\"&gt;Aldrich&lt;/a&gt;, with several enemies apparently worshiping here. Beyond the altar is the room containing Aldrich's coffin, guarded by the &lt;a href=\"Deacons%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Deacons of the Deep&lt;/a&gt;. For this battle, you may have the choice to summon a variety of friendly phantoms.\nFrom the plateau, there is an elevator leading to the main gate and a stairway to the second level. This can provide access to &lt;a href=\"%23Bonfires\"&gt;Rosaria's Bed Chamber&lt;/a&gt; via a moveable bridge. However, another path, leading over the Cathedral's higher balconies and over the rafters, can be accessed by taking a lift close to the &lt;a href=\"%23Bonfires\"&gt;Cleansing Chapel&lt;/a&gt;. This lift can be reached through a path on the left side of the main hall.\nIn front of &lt;a href=\"%23Bonfires\"&gt;Rosaria's Bed Chamber&lt;/a&gt; are numerous &lt;a href=\"Man-grub\"&gt;Man-grub&lt;/a&gt;s which will attack you, but one of them will remain passive. Killing it yields the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sign%20Soapstone%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Red Sign Soapstone&lt;/a&gt;. Inside the chamber you will find &lt;a href=\"Rosaria%2C%20Mother%20of%20Rebirth\"&gt;Rosaria, Mother of Rebirth&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly &lt;a href=\"Ringfinger%20Leonhard\"&gt;Ringfinger Leonhard&lt;/a&gt; depending on your actions.\nLore.\nThe Cathedral of the Deep, as a structure and organization, was founded back in the period in which the Main God of the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20White\"&gt;Way of White&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Allfather%20Lloyd\"&gt;Lloyd&lt;/a&gt;. The Cathedral was created with the function of purifying Humans who had their the blood infected by stagnant Dark, a ritual that took place in the Cleansing Chapel in which clerics used notched whips to tear people's flesh and make infected blood flow, to allow the drips to be cleansed. The blood purification process was so effective because the Cathedral was built near the \"&lt;a href=\"Deep%20Protection\"&gt;Deep&lt;/a&gt;\", a peaceful and sacred place, and therefore infused with the power capable of cleansing the Dark. Due to the rarity of such natural power, the Cathedral was entrusted to at least one Archbishop, the highest rankof the Way of White and direct representative of the Gods."}

{"id": "2612", "revid": "49243392", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2612", "title": "Ceaseless Discharge", "text": "Ceaseless Discharge (\u721b\u308c\u7d9a\u3051\u308b\u3082\u306e), also known as the Molten Giant, is a &lt;a href=\"Boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\".\nLocation.\nCeaseless Discharge is found in the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Ruins\"&gt;Demon Ruins&lt;/a&gt;. He stands on a field of lava below a rocky cliff, keeping vigil in front of the corpse of one of his sisters. She is laid to rest on an altar, alongside the &lt;a href=\"Gold-Hemmed%20Black%20Set\"&gt;Gold-Hemmed Black Set&lt;/a&gt;. The path leading into the boss arena crosses over a large pit before leading to the cliff overlooking the lava field.\nDescription.\nCeaseless Discharge is an imposing creature of monstrous size. He wields no weapons, and instead uses his fiery tendrils to fight. His deformed face retains a look of pain, as the sores attained at birth swell with lava. From his head sprout two horns and seven glowing, red eyes that are partially covered by his wrinkled skin. Meanwhile, the right side of his body is framed by a \"rib cage\" made of insect-like appendages. Ten more tendrils appear on his back and his left arm coils around his chest, fused to his body. His body is the source of the lava that floods the lower levels of the Demon Ruins, making the area impassable.\nCeaseless Discharge can be found on the far end of his arena, watching over the corpse of his sister, and must be engaged in battle. Once he is defeated, the lower parts of the area will drain of lava, allowing the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt; to explore the remainder of the Demon Ruins.\nLore.\nCeaseless Discharge is the youngest child and only known son of the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Witch of Izalith&lt;/a&gt;. However he was born with sores inflamed by the lava flowing in &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Izalith\"&gt;Izalith&lt;/a&gt; and so his older sisters, the witches of Izalith, gave him a &lt;a href=\"Orange%20Charred%20Ring\"&gt;magical ring&lt;/a&gt; to ease his pain. \nAround the same time, &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Izalith&lt;/a&gt; was experimenting with her &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Soul\"&gt;Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt; and the power of fire and souls and at a certain point, driven by ambition and arrogance, she tried to create a \"&lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;\" of her own, using her own Lord Soul as a basis to make a power similar to the primordial force that had brought life into the world. The experiment, however, was not entirely successful because the result was a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Flame of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, an unstable power that the witch was unable to control. Izalith herself was initially consumed by it and became a beast of chaos fire along with two of her daughters in the process transforming themselves into a \"&lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;\". This creature, fueled by the power of the Flame of Chaos, became a seebed for a new life form: &lt;a href=\"Demon%20%28lore%29\"&gt;Demons&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnfortunately, this affected the son of Izalith too and he became the first &lt;a href=\"Demon%20%28lore%29\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; to manifest itself. However, the still unstabilized &lt;a href=\"Flame%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Flame of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; led him to transform into a &lt;a href=\"Ceaseless%20Discharge\"&gt;monstrous demon&lt;/a&gt; and drop his magical ring causing another distorted &lt;a href=\"Centipede%20Demon\"&gt;Centipede Demon&lt;/a&gt; to spawn from where his ring dropped. Even if he was the first demon the Flame of Chaos inside his body was still unstable and he didn't have the knowledge to control it leaving it to burn him constantly Despite him becoming the first failed creature created by the Bed of Chaos, Izalith and her daughters managed at a certain point to stabilize the new power they had created and began to generate the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Firesage\"&gt;first real demons&lt;/a&gt;, life forms with stable bodies and capable of control the flame of chaos within each of them.\nAfter Izalith lost control over the Flame of Chaos that devoured her city and some of her daughters managed to escape it, Ceaseless Discharge managed to survive the war that the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Knight\"&gt;Silver Knight&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; waged against its kind and he remained to protect the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Ruins\"&gt;ruins of its home&lt;/a&gt;, gazing up at where his &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Witch%20Quelaag\"&gt;remaining&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Quelaag%27s%20Sister\"&gt;sisters&lt;/a&gt; live, as the only source of comfort in his pitiful, painful existence is the belief that they are watching over him.\nStrategies.\nUpon entering the boss arena, Ceaseless Discharge does not immediately attack the player, instead standing vigil over his sister's corpse. The player must initiate the fight by attacking Ceaseless Discharge, or by looting the &lt;a href=\"Gold-Hemmed%20Black%20Set\"&gt;Gold-Hemmed Black Set&lt;/a&gt; from his sister. If the fight is initiated through the former method, Ceaseless Discharge will begin fighting the player as normal, and will return to his passive state upon player death, requiring the player to attack him to begin the fight again. However, if his sister's corpse is pillaged, Ceaseless Discharge will become enraged, ripping his arm out of his torso cavity and revealing a large lava sore that was previously kept staunched by the arm, and becomes permanently hostile for all remaining attempts at fighting the boss.\nCeaseless Discharge will attack the player using a combination of his tendrils and flame projectiles, as well as his left arm should he have access to it. His attacks are primarily physical-focused, though if the player is out of range he can cast a highly-damaging plume of flame instead. Because he stands in the lava field below the cliff, it is impossible to directly attack Ceaseless Discharge with melee weapons unless he swings at the player first. As he is immune to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage, &lt;a href=\"Firebomb\"&gt;Firebomb&lt;/a&gt;s cannot hurt him, and the player must instead rely on &lt;a href=\"Bows\"&gt;Bows&lt;/a&gt; or non-&lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Pyromancy&lt;/a&gt; spells in order to damage him. Dodging his physical attacks and then counter-attacking by hitting his arm or tendrils also allows players without access to ranged combat to damage Ceaseless Discharge.\nShould the player have enraged Ceaseless Discharge and caused him to rip his arm out of his torso, it is possible to defeat him with only a few attacks. By retreating back to the fog door and crossing over the large pit at the start of the arena, the player puts themselves out of reach of Ceaseless Discharge's physical attacks. In a move of desperation, Ceaseless Discharge will attempt to jump over the pit, but fall short and grab onto the bridge that the player is on. In this state, he is incapable of attacking and is fully at the player's mercy. Attacking his arm at this point will cause him to lose his grip and fall into the pit, ending the battle. However, if Ceaseless Discharge's left arm is still fused to his torso, he will instead perform ranged fire attacks to damage the player, which are very difficult to dodge on the narrow bridge path.\nBoss Information.\nAttacks.\nSlam.\nThe slam's area of damage is actually much larger than the tendril itself: It creates a very wide shock wave that will damage the player even if there is no contact with said tendril. Players should stay clear away from the point of impact, and attempt a dodge even if it seems unnecessary.\nDouble Slam.\nThis attack requires the player to have uninterrupted focus in order to dodge.\nTendril Rampage.\nUses the appendages on his back to hit the ground in front of him.\nFiery Slam.\nThis attack is triggered when the player cannot be reached by his other attacks. A wide gust of fire is blasted from a short limb slammed on the ground. The attack can not be blocked and has tremendous range. Can only be avoided if the player stays close to the point of impact where the damage cone is narrow.\nThis attack is discernible from other slam attacks by Ceaseless Discharge lighting the tip of his tendrils on fire.\nSwipe.\nThis move actually consists of two attacks, the second one will follow up shortly after the first. Dodging this requires correct timing.\nCliff Hanger.\nIf the player retreats back to the fog door Ceaseless Discharge will make a desperate leap over the cliff to try and crush them. Once he lands he will dangle helplessly above the cliff and will no longer be able to move or attack, becoming completely defenseless.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls \u2014 Ceaseless Discharge by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxpuxcwBK9g&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

Prior to awakening, the demon rests motionless on a rock face. When awakened, flames ignite out of the four spikes on its back and the multiple sets of eyes open aglow, then it drops down on two reptilian feet. The creature has a total of six demonic centipede heads: two on its back, two as arms, and the last two as the head and tail. The heads can extend, spit fireballs, and be cut off. The right \"arm\" is the biggest head and has the longest range. The left one is used to grab opponents and put them in its toothed chest.

It can be used to avoid enemies that patrol large areas, as the player cannot be detected if they stay still. However, they must make sure to only move while out of sight of any and all enemies. However, Chameleon is practically useless against enemies that stay in one spot, as any way to sneak by them would likely still work without the help of Chameleon.\nOnline gameplay.\nChameleon is equally situational in &lt;a href=\"PvP%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;. Some players will be completely ignorant of Chameleon, which can be used to ambush, or simply hide from, other players. However, more experienced players may notice that something is off if they, for example, notice excess boxes in a pile, or an object that isn't moving like it should.\nAdditionally, \u00a0even a player that has detected a Chameleon will not be able to tell what the hidden player has equipped, or if they swap to new gear mid-transformation. Swapping to a weapon with a higher damage-per-hit may thus be done to give the hidden player an edge at the start of a fight.\nSee also.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

The Gravetender is a male warrior wielding his master's &lt;a href=\"Valorheart\"&gt;sword and shield&lt;/a&gt;, wearing a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Mask%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark Mask&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Armor%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Chain Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leather%20Gloves%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Leather Gloves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Loincloth\"&gt;Loincloth&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation.\nFrom the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariandel%23Bonfires\"&gt;Depths of the Painting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;, the boss can be reached by turning right and dropping down into the flower field opposite from the side of the frozen lake with &lt;a href=\"Frost\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Great%20Crab\"&gt;Crabs&lt;/a&gt;, beneath &lt;a href=\"Crossbreed%20Priscilla\"&gt;Crossbreed Priscilla&lt;/a&gt;'s old battle arena.\nLore.\nLong ago, an Undead declared a tournament in which their fellow cursed souls would battle to the repeated death, with their worth being measured in deaths. This was seen as a gift to the Undead, who go hollow without a purpose, and a fight with no end was considered by some to be a glorious use of their immortality.\nThe Champion of the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Match\"&gt;Undead Match&lt;/a&gt; eventually went mad, and at some point died. As they had stayed with him in life, the young fighter training under the champion and a large wolf stayed to protect the sanctity of his grave and were eventually drawn into the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Painted World of Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;, where they utilized frost sorceries to continue their task.\nStrategy.\nIt is advised to kill the three &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; that accompany the Gravetender at the beginning of the fight as to ensure they do not become problematic when facing the Gravetender himself. The Gravetender will fight very aggressively, using his &lt;a href=\"Valorheart\"&gt;sword and shield's&lt;/a&gt; unique combination attacks to strike while blocking, turning each attempt to attack him into a trade that minimizes damage to himself. For this reason, it is not suggested to use small arms such as &lt;a href=\"Straight%20Swords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;straight swords&lt;/a&gt; to fight him, but rather to use ultra weapons such as an &lt;a href=\"Ultra%20Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;ultra greatsword&lt;/a&gt; to inflict heavy stagger on him and to break his guard to open him up to &lt;a href=\"Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;ripostes&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt about 50% health, the Gravetender will stop attacking the player and will perform &lt;a href=\"Gestures%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;By my sword&lt;/a&gt;, summoning the Gravetender's Greatwolf; if the player is still within melee range of the Gravetender, he may cancel out of it but still summon the Greatwolf. The Gravetender will then bring out a staff and use &lt;a href=\"Great%20Soul%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Great Soul Arrow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Snap%20Freeze\"&gt;Snap Freeze&lt;/a&gt; to support the Greatwolf from a distance, switching back to his sword and shield should the player get too close.\nThe Greatwolf fights very aggressively and will perform a charging attack very similar to that of &lt;a href=\"Vordt%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Vordt of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt;, albeit much faster. It's not advised to block these attacks with anything less than a &lt;a href=\"Greatshields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;greatshield&lt;/a&gt;, as they can devastate the player's &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;, leading to a &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Break\"&gt;guard break&lt;/a&gt; and an almost guaranteed hit from the Greatwolf. Once the Greatwolf is at 50% health, it will perform a howl and its eyes will glow red. At this point the Greatwolf gains a &lt;a href=\"Frost\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt; breath attack and becomes even faster and more aggressive.\nThe ideal strategy during the second phase is to try to finish off the Gravetender as quickly as possible, to remove the Greatwolf's support and ensure that there is only one enemy to focus on. A good tactic to minimize exposure to the Greatwolf's attacks is to lure it around the pillars of Priscilla's arena; this works particularly well against its charging attacks as the pillars provide cover against them as well as deflects the Greatwolf away from the player. This can allow the player to avoid the Greatwolf's attacks, and buy time to maneuver around to engage the Gravetender alone.\nEquipment.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nChampion's Gravetender=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

However, someone had different plans for him and the king found himself restrained by a &lt;a href=\"Prisoner%27s%20Chain\"&gt;chain&lt;/a&gt; that blocked him in his path, leading him to fall into an &lt;a href=\"Untended%20Graves\"&gt;abyss&lt;/a&gt; and get lost in the folds of time. Gundyr thus found himself in a moment of time when the Firelink Shrine had no fire and ended up arriving \"late\" for the celebrations that awaited his fate. The &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Keeper\"&gt;Fire Keeper&lt;/a&gt; who was supposed to welcome her champion never met him and the ensuing tragic farce became a favorite tale of the masses of Lothric, a stain on the reputation of the realm. \nThe fate of the aspiring Lord, however, was not the result of chance, in fact the one who had charged him with his duty had also condemned him to eternal service from the beginning. Gundyr would in fact be defeated by an unknown warrior and then become sheath to a &lt;a href=\"Coiled%20Sword\"&gt;coiled sword&lt;/a&gt; and transformed into an indestructible golem, becoming the ritual test for those who would attempt to link the First Flame after him, testing their strength and worthiness Over time a literal arena complete with stands was built around his remains, in which the now &lt;a href=\"Iudex%20Gundyr\"&gt;Iudex Gundyr&lt;/a&gt; would judge those who aspired to become Lords , testing them. \nWhen the First Flame starts to fade out again and the previous &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lords of Cinder&lt;/a&gt; refuse to serve as kindlings again, the &lt;a href=\"Unkindled\"&gt;Unkindled&lt;/a&gt; buried in the &lt;a href=\"Cemetery%20of%20Ash\"&gt;Cemetery of Ash&lt;/a&gt; were resurrected. Thus the remains of Gundyr's golem became the judge of these potential champions trying to reach &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt;. Although, after an immense amount of time and the fire within the &lt;a href=\"Coiled%20Sword\"&gt;Coiled Sword&lt;/a&gt; removed from his body, the raging humanity within Gundyr exploded during his last battle, bursting out in a manifestation of &lt;a href=\"Pus%20of%20Man\"&gt;dark pus&lt;/a&gt; driven by an untamable fury. \nFight overview.\nThe battle will commence once the player approaches him. Champion Gundyr fights in a similar manner to his &lt;a href=\"Iudex%20Gundyr\"&gt;present self&lt;/a&gt;, although he is far more aggressive, hits harder, and has a larger moveset that covers a wider area, leaving very little openings for the player to attack.\nAll moves he shares with Iudex have been enhanced in some way. For example, when he slams his &lt;a href=\"Gundyr%27s%20Halberd\"&gt;halberd&lt;/a&gt; into the ground, he does this in an attack that consists of two stages, the first when he slams the weapon and the second when he raises it again, in another attack that has slightly more reach.\nTwo of the most noticeable attacks added to his repertoire are a round-back kick he performs if he detects the player is next to him after finishing a combo, and a shoulder bash that practically teleports him from any place within the arena to the player's position, knocking them back while dealing medium damage.\nIn his second phase, he will become even more aggressive and will start using some devastating combos and juggles. All of his attacks are then enhanced in one way or another and he can chain combos almost immediately, harassing the player without taking breaks while performing wide swings and punches. He also resorts to his back-round kicks and shoulder bashes more often and is able to reach the player's current position from all across the arena in just an instant.\nHowever, perhaps his most dangerous enhancement is being able to perform counter-combos. He has a few powerful combos designed to trigger if he finishes one and detects the player is attempting to attack at that moment.\nGundyr can be &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parried and riposted&lt;/a&gt;, greatly trivializing an otherwise difficult fight.\nStrategy.\nThe fight will start as soon as Gundyr is approached in his arena. He is vulnerable from the first moment and the player should take this opportunity to score as many hits as possible. It's not recommended to rush at him for this purpose, though, and instead conserve as much &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; as possible for when the battle properly starts.\nGundyr's most distinctive characteristic is his ability to dominate the immediate area around him. He has a vast repertoire of wide attacks and backward counter moves, and can also close the distance to the player in an instant. The main problem in this fight is Gundyr's excellent tracking, which allows him to unleash all of his attacks almost with perfect accuracy at the player, even if they roll away or are standing right behind him.\nIn his first phase, Gundyr will attack much like his &lt;a href=\"Iudex%20Gundyr\"&gt;previous incarnation&lt;/a&gt;, although his moves will now be faster, his combos longer, and he will try to perform his grab attack more frequently. Additionally, he will sometimes delay the finishing attack of some of his combos to trick the player into rolling early and ensure they get hit.\nIn his second phase, however, things will become much more complicated, with Gundyr unleashing very damaging - almost infinite - combos and chasing the player non-stop. Trying to stay in his vicinity is very risky. What the player is advised to wait until he starts performing a combo and run away as far from him as possible. When Gundyr tries to reach the player again, he may perform one of his two jumping attacks (the shorter consists of two hits), where the player may score a hit or two while he recovers.\nPlayers should also be very cautious of not letting themselves be caught by Gundyr's juggle attack, which may outright kill them instantly if they are not careful.\nGundyr will react immediately if he detects the player is trying to heal and will cancel any combo or attack to quickly lunge at the player and stab them with his halberd. To heal, try to do so while standing behind him after evading his attacks and just after he is finishing a combo. Another method is to gain as much distance from him as possible and heal while he is performing a combo; however, since he will cancel it and rush to attack, the player should consider this and make sure they will have enough time to finish the healing process before he arrives to their position."}

Thus, during the earliest known ages of the world, Chaos developed its reputation as a powerful force.\nEventually, the Witch of Izalith attempted to duplicate the First Flame.

While both Great Chaos Fire Orb and &lt;a href=\"Seething%20Chaos\"&gt;Seething Chaos&lt;/a&gt; can deal more damage under optimal circumstances, enemies can move away from the lava pool left by Great Chaos Fire Orb, and Seething Chaos requires manipulation and timing in order to deal the most damage.\nUnlike &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Sun\"&gt;its predecessor&lt;/a&gt;, Chaos Bed Vestiges does not leave a lava pool, has less range and will begin to arc after a shorter distance (approximately slightly longer than &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Orb%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire Orb&lt;/a&gt;). However, it is easier to reach enemies at higher elevations with this spell than it is with the various \"fireball\" spells.

However, as it &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus\"&gt;scales&lt;/a&gt; well with &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; as well as with &lt;a href=\"Humanity%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;Humanity&lt;/a&gt; due to the &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;Chaos mechanic&lt;/a&gt;, it is capable of inflicting extreme amounts of damage to make up for this weakness.\nThe Chaos Blade has the potential for the highest physical damage of the Katanas, with easily the highest &lt;a href=\"Physical%20damage\"&gt;Physical damage&lt;/a&gt; per second with 10 Humanity and 40 Dexterity at around 450 damage per hit. Do not confuse this with this sword being capable of dealing the most damage of any Katana overall. It causes more &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt; build up than other katanas\u00a0(36 compared to the default 33 of other katanas). It also has the highest durability of any Katanas, having 50% more than both the Uchigatana and Iaito and twice the amount of the Washing Pole. Like most boss weapons, the Chaos Blade cannot be &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Augmentation\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; by spells or consumables, which lowers its overall damage potential. \nIn practice, the Chaos Blade is arguably the best Katana for players who don't mind the feedback damage and do not have access to &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Augmentation\"&gt;weapon buffs&lt;/a&gt; as long as the player can keep up with the requirement of 10 held Humanity to keep full damage, if not Uchi or Iaito would be a better choice. \nThe self-damage of Chaos Blade can be partially mitigated by equipping the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Evil%20Eye\"&gt;Ring of the Evil Eye&lt;/a&gt; or by casting a heal-over-time &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Miracle&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"Replenishment\"&gt;Replenishment&lt;/a&gt;. Chaos Blade does not damage its wielder if it does not hit anything. It also does not deal self damage damage with nimations, su and the [[Tauru. However, it still deals damage to its wielder if the player swings at an change a during their dying animation. This is especially noticeable on large enemies with slow dying animations. \nVideos.\n[[File:Dark Souls - Weapon Chaos Blade ( HD - 720p )-0|thumb|center|335px]]\n[[Category:Dark Souls: Boss Soul Weapons]]\n[[es:Espada caos]]\n[[pl:Klinga Chaosu]]\n[[ru:\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043a \u0425\u0430\u043e\u0441\u0430]]"}

It provides this with modest stat requirements and a standard katana moveset. At high levels of dexterity its physical damage is only outperformed by the &lt;a href=\"Frayed%20Blade\"&gt;Frayed Blade&lt;/a&gt; and the buffed &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, the Chaos Blade damages the wielder for slightly more than 1% of their maximum &lt;a href=\"Hit%20Points%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; every time they hit an opponent. This damage can kill the wielder and is not affected by the wielder's defenses or the damage dealt to the target, and will occur even if the target did not take damage from the strike, such as if they blocked or rolled through it. In longer fights, the extra damage taken on top of the opponent's own damage can result in otherwise avoidable deaths if the wielder doesn't manage their health carefully.

It seems intended to provide the basis for a build more focused on either one of Strength or Dexterity or a mix of both, that still has the stats to carry some supportive &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Miracle&lt;/a&gt;s from its Faith. \nIts &lt;a href=\"Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Spear&lt;/a&gt; deals somewhat mediocre damage and is quite short for a polearm, but is actually fairly quick and can attack while still keeping a block up, at the cost of lowering that block's effectiveness (meaning even a 100% block shield will let some damage slip through if hit). Its skill is &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Splitter\"&gt;Shield Splitter&lt;/a&gt;, a heavy thrust that partially bypasses blocking. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Kite%20Shield\"&gt;Kite Shield&lt;/a&gt; it comes with is, along with the &lt;a href=\"Knight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Knight's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Knight Shield&lt;/a&gt;, one of the two starting shields that has 100% physical block, making this class quite sturdy from the start (bear in mind that this defence will lower slightly for a bit if attacking with the Spear from behind a block). It has the ability to &lt;a href=\"Parry%20%28skill%29\"&gt;Parry&lt;/a&gt; with some timing, allowing a follow-up riposte if it lands. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Talisman%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Talisman&lt;/a&gt; is a decent starting tool for Miracles but its scaling is more intended for significantly higher Faith and its skill, &lt;a href=\"Unfaltering%20Prayer\"&gt;Unfaltering Prayer&lt;/a&gt;, is intended to let slower Miracles be used in the middle of combat by preventing interruption, something the Herald's starting spell already helps with since it is quite quick-casting, and is probably better of replaced with a &lt;a href=\"Cleric%27s%20Sacred%20Chime%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Cleric's Sacred Chime&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20Handmaid\"&gt;Shrine Handmaid&lt;/a&gt; once at least 1 point has been put into Faith to get its &lt;a href=\"Gentle%20Prayer\"&gt;Gentle Prayer&lt;/a&gt; Weapon Art for some early, cheap regeneration. It should also be noted that any Miracle-casting tool will only start scaling once at least 19 Faith has been reached. \nThe only Miracle attuned from the beginning, &lt;a href=\"Heal%20Aid\"&gt;Heal Aid&lt;/a&gt;, is a weak but quick-casting heal that allows for some movement during casting and heals for 150 hp at the start, or about a third of the Herald's starting health. Unlike &lt;a href=\"Heal%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt; it only heals the caster, and not any nearby allies. \nThe armor it wears, the &lt;a href=\"Herald%20Set\"&gt;Herald Set&lt;/a&gt;, has overall fairly good physical defences and decent elemental defences, but is notably weaker against Strike damage and Lightning damage.

Against the &lt;a href=\"elements\"&gt;elements&lt;/a&gt;, it provides a mediocre, but well-balanced, defense, save for a severe vulnerability against &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage. In terms of weight, it provides a fair amount of &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; with it. Resistances to the various &lt;a href=\"Negative%20Status%20Effects%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;negative status effects&lt;/a&gt; are also relatively mediocre, though it is quite weak to &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt; build-up, but respectably tolerant of &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"frost\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt; build-up.\nWhat is most peculiar of this set is that the cloth garments are not as reliable as the game states them to be, with the &lt;a href=\"Herald%20Gloves\"&gt;gloves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Herald%20Leggings\"&gt;leggings&lt;/a&gt; both having terrible absorption in what they should protect more effectively against &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strike%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;strike&lt;/a&gt; damage.\nIt is best to replace both of the gloves and leggings with a more suitable, protective choice in those slots, to help balance out the set's drawbacks more efficiently."}

This scaling is rather weak at values under 30 Intelligence, allowing other staves to temporarily surpass it; however, between 30 and 40 Intelligence its scaling greatly improves, before falling off again after 40 Intelligence. This means that the Heretic's Staff is a strong catalyst below 25 Intelligence, is surpassed by others in the 30 Intelligence range, and then reclaims the lead between 35 and 45 Intelligence, before other staves catch up and exceed it for the final time.\nFor this reason, the Heretic's Staff is considered the ideal staff for Intelligence casters who are still in the process of creating their builds and wish to deal meaningful damage in the meantime, or for hybrid/utility casters who wish to stop at 45 Intelligence or lower.\nUpgrades.\nReinforced with regular ."}

Hexes are unique in that they require both &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; in order to be used.\nAs a general rule, hexes that require more intelligence than Faith require a &lt;a href=\"Staves\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; to cast, while those that require more Faith than Intelligence require a &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Chimes\"&gt;sacred chime&lt;/a&gt;. Hexes cast from staves tend to be more destructive, while hexes cast from chimes tend to be more passive. In some cases the damage dealt is dependent on the amount of souls the caster has, consuming souls in the process.\nSome weapons that are neither staves nor chimes exist which can be used to cast hexes, such as the &lt;a href=\"Mace%20of%20the%20Insolent\"&gt;Mace of the Insolent&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe damage dealt by hexes is heavily influenced by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29%23Dark%20Attack%20Bonus\"&gt;Dark Attack Bonus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stats%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;stat&lt;/a&gt;.

However, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt;damage has the least resistances in the core game with most enemies being quite vulnerable to it. This advantage does diminish when going through the DLCs as most enemies in the DLCs have very high elemental defenses, Dark included. Also, some bosses boast high Dark damage resistance, such as &lt;a href=\"Nashandra\"&gt;Nashandra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elana%2C%20the%20Squalid%20Queen\"&gt;Elana, the Squalid Queen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fume%20Knight\"&gt;Fume Knight&lt;/a&gt;.

Its physical component &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;scales&lt;/a&gt; primarily with &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, while its magical component scales purely with &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. Like other hybrid weapons, its elemental damage component has the scaling cap of a catalyst, meaning that it can continue to gain meaningful returns on damage by leveling Intelligence all the way to 60.\nAs a weapon, the Heysel Pick is unique among the hybrids. As it is a hammer class weapon it is only one of two hybrids that possesses &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt;, the other being the &lt;a href=\"Immolation%20Tinder\"&gt;Immolation Tinder&lt;/a&gt;, but it is also the only Sorcery catalyst whose physical component scales primarily with Strength. As well, unlike the other Sorcery catalysts the Heysel Pick has no &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt; wielding requirement, meaning that it is far less cumbersome to fit onto a build.\nBecause it is such a compact and easy-to-wield weapon, the Heysel Pick is capable of performing Sorcery combos along with its high-stagger attacks, particularly when wielded in the off-hand. Used properly, it can grant its wielder extreme flexibility as well as high mix-up potential, becoming a threat at all ranges. This means that casting speed is a high priority to obtain, and as such a &lt;a href=\"Sage%20Ring\"&gt;Sage Ring&lt;/a&gt; is virtually mandatory in order to use this weapon effectively. Properly used, it can become an unpredictable and nigh-unstoppable force.\nMoveset.\n&lt;br&gt;\nUpgrades.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

{"id": "130788", "revid": "51254358", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=130788", "title": "Hidetaka Miyazaki", "text": "Hidetaka Miyazaki (\u5bae\u5d0e \u82f1\u9ad8 Miyazaki Hidetaka, born in Shizuoka, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan) is a Japanese video game director and current president of the video game development company, &lt;a href=\"From%20Software\"&gt;FromSoftware&lt;/a&gt;. Miyazaki originally joined FromSoftware as a programmer in 2004 and after directing \"Armored Core 4\" and \"Armored Core: For Answer\", he became widely known for creating the \"Souls\" series.\nAlthough Miyazaki had directed the first two games in the series, Miyazaki took a supervising role for \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\" due to the parallel development of \"\", which made him unable to direct both titles simultaneously. After the release of \"Bloodborne\", Miyazaki returned to the \"Souls\" series as the lead director on \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nCareer.\nAfter graduating, Miyazaki went to work for the US based Oracle Corporation. Upon a friend's recommendation, Miyazaki began playing the 2001 video game \"Ico\", causing him to consider a career change to a game designer. At age 29 however, Miyazaki found that few game companies would employ him, one of the few that would was &lt;a href=\"From%20Software\"&gt;FromSoftware&lt;/a&gt;, where Miyazaki began working on the \"Armored Core\" series. Upon learning about what later became \"&lt;a href=\"Demon%27s%20Souls\"&gt;Demon's Souls&lt;/a&gt;\", Miyazaki became excited at the prospect of the title and offered to help. Although the game sold poorly at first, it began to pick up after a few months and soon found publishers willing to release the title outside Japan. After the release of the game's spiritual successors, \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\", Miyazaki was promoted to the position of president in 2014.\nAfter the release of the \"Prepare to Die Edition\" of \"Dark Souls\" in August 2012, Sony Computer Entertainment approached FromSoftware concerning cooperative development on a new title. Miyazaki asked about the possibility of developing a game for eighth-generation consoles and the concept of \"\" developed from there. There were no story or setting connections to FromSoftware's previous titles, even though Miyazaki conceded that it \"carries the DNA of \"Demon's Souls\" and its very specific level design\". Development ran parallel to that of \"Dark Souls II\", which Miyazaki simply supervised as he was unable to direct both titles simultaneously. After the release of \"Bloodborne\" in March 2015, Miyazaki returned to the \"Souls\" series as the director on \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;\", with assistance from \"Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor\" and \"Dark Souls II\" directors Isamu Okano and Yui Tanimura, respectively. \"Dark Souls III\" was released in Japan in March 2016 and worldwide in April 12th of the same year.\nSubsequent works by Miyazaki include \"Dark Souls III\"'s DLCs \"&lt;a href=\"Ashes%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Ashes of Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;\" (2016) and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ringed%20City\"&gt;The Ringed&lt;/a&gt;\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ringed%20City\"&gt;City&lt;/a&gt; (2017), which concluded the \"Dark Souls\" saga.\nIn 2018 he directed FromSoftware's virtual reality adventure videogame \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%25C3%25A9racin%25C3%25A9\"&gt;D\u00e9racin\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;\". In 2019 he directed \"Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice\", developed by FromSoftware and published by Activision; the game was acclaimed by critics and nominated for several awards, including \"Game of the Year\" at the 2019 The Game Awards. He is currently (2020) working on \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elden_Ring\"&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/a&gt;\" (2022), which he is directing and is written in collaboration with \"A Song of Fire and Ice\"'s author George R. R. Martin.\nA \"Demon's Souls\" remake by Bluepoint Games was released as a launch title for PlayStation 5 on November 12th, 2020. Miyazaki was not involved in the development of the remake."}

Only his torso up remains of his body.\nLocation.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"Catacombs%20of%20Carthus\"&gt;Catacombs of Carthus&lt;/a&gt;, the player will come upon a grim chalice. Interacting with it will send the player to the &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt; to face Wolnir.\nLore.\nWolnir is a giant humanoid that, at some point in time, rose to power in the realm of &lt;a href=\"Carthus%20of%20the%20Sands\"&gt;Carthus of the Sands&lt;/a&gt;. Carthus was a desert kingdom where pyromancers developed their knowledge in isolation from other forms, evolving differently and &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Swordsman%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;warriors&lt;/a&gt; developed incredible sword techniques and were able to move as weightlessly as a grain of sand and they valued victory so much that they didn't shun the use of pyromancy to enhance their weapons and create even twisted pyromancies like &lt;a href=\"Acid%20Surge%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;acid surges&lt;/a&gt; to degrade their enemies' armor and weapons.\nThe warriors of Carthus would swear blind loyalty to Wolnir, dedicating him and becoming ruthless and bloody. As the king of Carthus, Wolnir led his country to become so aggressive and expansive that it was likened to uncontrollable fire and its beacons were used as war signals and his warriors, with their superior combat skills and their &lt;a href=\"Carthus%20Flame%20Arc\"&gt;fighting pyromancy&lt;/a&gt;, conquered most of the known kingdoms. Wolnir thus conquered and destroyed every other kingdom around Carthus, making the various \"crowns\" that ruled different lands into a single one, and thus ascending to \"High Lord\". At some point Wolnir stripped three armlets and a holy sword from the corpses of some clerics, demonstrating how religion and gods counted for nothing in his kingdom.\nConsumed by power, Wolnir wished to outlive every other being in the world and sentenced his entire empire to death, slaughtering both civilians and soldiers . Following this massacre the Catacombs of Carthus, an immense underground necropolis, were built to keep and bury the bones of countless people and soldiers. High Lord Wolnir would then use necromancy to reanimate himself and control a skeleton army and empire, wishing to remain the last being. Following this an &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt; would open in the Catacombs of Carthus and Wolnir fell into it, experiencing the terror of true darkness and making him plead to the gods for the first time , leading the sword and three sacred armlets he once stole to give him a semblace of comfort and preventing him from being swallowed by the Abyss, which was barely contained in a magical artifact. After falling into the Abyss, Wolnir discovered a form of pyromancy that uses the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Soul\"&gt;Dark Soul&lt;/a&gt; and since it was connected with humanity it gained a will of its own. The pyromancers that had become the guardians of the catacombs would discover Wolnir's &lt;a href=\"Black%20Serpent\"&gt;dark flame&lt;/a&gt;, born from the Abyss and shadowless, and started using it.\nStrategy.\nThe key to beating Wolnir is to destroy his bracelets, one on his right hand and two on his left. By breaking all three bracelets, Wolnir will descend into the &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt; and die. The boss is surrounded by a black fog which rapidly drains the player's health, making it hazardous to move past Wolnir's arms or body. Occasionally, Wolnir exhales a blast of this fog which covers a large area in front of him, which will likely kill any player who does not quickly get out of range. The fog deals high amounts of dark damage and no real amount of resistance will be particularly effective. Extremely high amounts of resistance against this effect can only buy about 3 seconds (confirmed) of life in the fog. But most attempts left the character with around 10% of their health remaining.\nDestroying the bracelet on his right arm may prove more difficult for melee attacks, as it is more often in the fog. Using &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bows&lt;/a&gt; is a good alternative to destroy Wolnir's bracelets, especially the one on his right hand, as the player can remain at a considerably safe distance. The damage done to his health bar will be minimal. However, destroying the bracelets will only take a handful of successful hits.\nWolnir attacks mainly with fist swipes. These attacks are well-telegraphed and can even be blocked with a strong enough &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;. After destroying one of the bracelets, he may summon his &lt;a href=\"Wolnir%27s%20Holy%20Sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; which greatly increases his attack range. It's possible to prevent this by destroying a bracelet whilst he is mid-summon. Occasionally, he will call forth &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Skeletons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Wheel\"&gt;Skeleton Wheel&lt;/a&gt;s, and even &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Swordsman%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Skeleton Swordsmen&lt;/a&gt; to aid him; although, they will often be destroyed by his attacks. The variety of this summoning appears to correspond to how many bracelets he has left.\nUpon entering the Abyss, the &lt;a href=\"Grave%20Warden%20Pyromancy%20Tome\"&gt;Grave Warden Pyromancy Tome&lt;/a&gt; will be lying ahead to be picked up. If it is picked up, the boss fight will begin immediately. Instead of picking it up, the player can take this opportunity to attack and possibly destroy one of Wolnir's bracelets on his left arm. The tome can be retrieved at any time during or after the fight, or once the player has returned to the chalice room and has reloaded the area.\nAlthough it is not immediately apparent, there is essentially a time limit to this battle. Wolnir constantly climbs up the incline and, even though he will be blocked by a wall, the area left to the player will be minimal, making dodging attacks much more difficult. Destroying a bracelet will cause him to slip back down the incline, giving the player more room."}

They are capable of casting a miracle that generates a ring of light that rapidly drains the player's health, regardless of blocking or evading. There are at least two that can cast &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20White%20Corona\"&gt;Way of White Corona&lt;/a&gt; which turns them into a sort of spinning top that does a massive amount of damage. When low on vitality, they will hide under the stone and cast the same miracle in order to regenerate all their health, this generates a larger damaging ring of light.\nLocation.\nFound in &lt;a href=\"The%20Ringed%20City%20%28location%29\"&gt;The Ringed City&lt;/a&gt;, in the swamp before reaching the &lt;a href=\"The%20Ringed%20City%23Bonfires\"&gt;Ringed City Streets&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nThe ring of light cast by the hobbled cleric can reach the player regardless of distance or elevation to the enemy, even when on a ladder. If caught in the ring, it will drain the player's health at an alarming rate and also slightly stagger them, making it difficult to escape. A distinct chime will alert the player that the cleric is preparing the miracle and a deeper chime will warn them that the ring is about to materialize. Cleric can also retreat under the stone and ram into the player, inflicting heavy damage.\nWhen the hobbled cleric is low on health, it will retreat under the stone and use the miracle to replenish its vitality. Attempting to attack it at this point is both ineffective and dangerous as another ring will appear beneath it that inflicts even more damage if stepped into. Caution should be advised when engaging multiple clerics as the increased size of the rings can make it harder to escape their radius. Staggering the Cleric or using a strong weapon is recommended to kill it quickly before it can cast the healing miracle."}

Using a normal attack while in Hold will cause the player to bring the katana out in a forward stride, powerfully slashing horizontally for 130% of the weapon's Attack Rating and inflicting 150% of the weapon's base &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; damage. Using a strong attack will cause the player to quickly perform a parry with the blade, increasing absorption across the board by 50% during and shortly after the parry frames.\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nUse of this skill can be quite powerful in the hands of a good offensive-minded player, depending on the specific enemy. The normal attack allows the player to get in a powerful attack inside a short window while moving forward, useful against enemies whose attacks have small recovery times and long reach. The strong attack allows the player to parry without the need to equip a shield in the off-hand, which can be handy depending on the equipment loadout, though in order to conserve &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt; simply carrying a parrying tool in the off-hand can be more economical.\nOnline gameplay.\nIt should be noted that remaining in the Hold stance for any duration of time will telegraph intentions to any opponents; much like equipping a parrying tool in the off-hand, smart players will immediately know that an attempt to parry may be coming. As such, it is ideal to try to perform either of the attacks immediately without remaining in the stance for any period of time, to give opponents no chance to react.\nThe normal attack has a short delay and strong forward momentum, which makes it ideal for roll-catching defensive opponents who attempt to roll away the moment they see an attack movement. The lunging motion gives the weapon increased reach, making it ideal for offensive movements and striking targets that think that they are out of range of the weapon.\nThe parry has the same startup and a similar number of active frames as a dedicated parrying shield, meaning that under the right circumstances it is possible to parry another player on reaction. However, caution should still be exercised as entering the Hold stance will require a slight delay, and remaining in the stance will invite an easy backstab."}
{"id": "157699", "revid": "33084951", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=157699", "title": "Hold (Frayed Blade)", "text": "Hold is a &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"The%20Ringed%20City\"&gt;The Ringed City&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\nWhen held, the player sheathes the weapon and prepares to use one of two special attacks. Using a normal attack while in Hold will cause the player to bring the katana down in a vertical slash, sending forward a thin shockwave of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; energy for a short distance; the blade itself deals 100% of the weapon's Attack Rating, while the shockwave inflicts 5 times the weapon's Dark damage. Using a strong attack will cause the player to execute four very fast slashes, with each attack dealing 51% of the weapon's Attack Rating as damage.\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nHold gives the player increased offensive options when dealing with certain enemies. The shockwave can be useful for damaging an enemy that is dangerous to engage at close range, while the slash combo can be particularly powerful against &lt;a href=\"Boss%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt; when they are locked into certain attack animations. In particular, each slash of the strong attack can still inflict &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt; on any targets hit, allowing this weapon to not only inflict impressive damage from Attack Rating alone but to proc immediate burst damage via the status effect.\nOnline gameplay.\nBoth abilities are very useful against players, as they allow the wielder to excel in areas where katanas are usually weak.\nThe normal attack can be used either to out-space an opponent or roll-catch them if they attempt to dodge. As katanas are comparatively short compared to &lt;a href=\"Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Greatswords&lt;/a&gt; and ultra weapons, the shockwave gives players the option to safely damage opponents from range once they are locked into an attack animation. Additionally, landing the attack at close range will hit foes with both the blade and the shockwave, inflicting tremendous damage in a single stroke.\nThe strong attack is particularly strong as it can be used on players that are stunned from hits from any number of the Frayed Blade's other attacks, giving it an unusually large number of true combos rivaling the &lt;a href=\"Splitleaf%20Greatsword\"&gt;Splitleaf Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;. The slashes can also be useful for quickly breaking down shields, something that katanas traditionally have trouble with, while dealing chip damage through the shield itself. As above, the slashes are capable of building up Bleed if they connect, even through raised shields, and when used aggressively can threaten an enemy player with Blood Loss."}
{"id": "3179", "revid": "24740013", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3179", "title": "Hollow", "text": " is a degenerative state in the \"Dark Souls\" franchise which the &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; are doomed to eventually become unless they can find a steady supply of &lt;a href=\"Humanity\"&gt;Humanity&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn terms of , Hollow refers to an in-game which limits the abilities and possible scenarios of the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt;. Namely, not being able to summon NPCs and other players in the form of &lt;a href=\"white%20phantom\"&gt;white phantom&lt;/a&gt;s. Alternatively, being Hollow might also be desirable at times as it prevents the player from being invaded by other and &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player\"&gt;players&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is possible to \"Reverse Hollowing\" by offering &lt;a href=\"Humanity%20Mechanic\"&gt;Humanity&lt;/a&gt; at a &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;; however, death results in reverting to a semi-Hollowed state. Also, the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"darksign\"&gt;darksign&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0can recreate the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt;'s body in order to be reborn.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHollowing in \"Dark Souls II\" is similar to the previous game, with a few key differences:\nReverse Hollowing can be made instantly using a &lt;a href=\"Human%20Effigy\"&gt;Human Effigy&lt;/a&gt; from the inventory. Alternatively, seeking &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20the%20King\"&gt;Vendrick's blessing&lt;/a&gt; and wearing one of the four crowns will completely negate the effect of Hollowing, even upon death.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHollowing is a bit different in \"Dark Souls III\" compared to the previous games.\nPlot.\nAt the beginning of the Age of Fire, &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn&lt;/a&gt; marked the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Soul\"&gt;Dark Soul&lt;/a&gt; within every human being with a &lt;a href=\"Darksign\"&gt;seal of fire&lt;/a&gt;, blocking its natural powers and causing humans to become mortal. \nAs the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; began to fade, the Darksign's power consequently weakened and, as it was no longer able to adequately contain the Dark Soul, humans returned to being immortal, coming back to life with each death, and becoming known as &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt;. \nHowever, humans are still marked by the Darksign, which consumes their Dark Soul as fuel to continue to exist. This leads the Undead to slowly lose their minds and become &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;Hollow&lt;/a&gt;s, as the strength that allows them to have a will and emotions and remain a human is consumed from within them. \nMany &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; encountered in &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt; will eventually turn Hollow if certain prerequisites are met. Most characters are fearful of going Hollow and try to ward it off as much as possible, though the &lt;a href=\"Crestfallen%20Warrior\"&gt;Crestfallen Warrior&lt;/a&gt; seems to find the prospect of going Hollow to be desirable.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt; is already in a somewhat Hollowed state when escaping from the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Undead%20Asylum\"&gt;Undead Asylum&lt;/a&gt; and seems to be subject to a different progression pattern compared to other &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the Chosen Undead's appearance as a Hollow, they are able to maintain their free will and this is immediately recognized by other characters.\nIn general, it seems that Undead go Hollow more quickly when they have no further goals or purpose. Even characters like &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20Lenigrast\"&gt;Blacksmith Lenigrast&lt;/a&gt;, who are visibly almost fully Hollow, can maintain their lucidity if they are focused on their craft. This is likely why the Chosen Undead never fully hollows during the course of the game, since they will continue on their journey for as long as the player is motivated.\nAt some point in time, Hollows developed their own civilization, most notably &lt;a href=\"Londor\"&gt;Londor&lt;/a&gt;, governed by the Sable Church.\nCauses.\nThe causes of Hollowing are not fully understood. Hollowing involves the loss of Humanity, the loss of purpose, or both. \nHumanity seems to slow Hollowing. The characters closest to Hollowing do not drop any Humanity when killed. Using the Dark Hand, Humanity can be stolen from most characters, with the exception of several characters close to Hollowing (Crestfallen Warrior, Crestfallen Merchant, Undead Male Merchant, Undead Female Merchant). However, some fully Hollowed characters will drop large amounts of Humanity when killed, indicating that even Humanity cannot prevent Hollowing entirely. \nSymptoms.\nThe defining symptom of Hollowing is a gradual loss of free will. All Hollows seek souls, but some Hollows may also have attractions to things they valued before becoming Hollows. This might explain why so many have maintained stations at various posts as well as their aggression towards non-Hollows. Hollows are non-aggressive towards other Hollows, and also seem to ignore Undead who are sufficiently close to Hollowing.\nHollows are also referenced as mad or lost, also characterized by abhorrent stench. Hollows' minds are filled with fears.\nWhile Undead are ordinarily reborn at a Bonfire after each death, it is possible for a Hollow to be permanently killed, after which they will not revive. This is the fate of many NPCs encountered in \"Dark Souls\": they eventually become Hollow, are killed by the player, and never reappear.\nBeyond this, drastic changes in physical appearance can be observed. Skin appears slightly decomposed and the body thoroughly dehydrated, prominent veins can be seen surrounding the heart although physical signs may only be indicative of progression into a Hollowed state and not of being entirely Hollowed.

These enemies attack by casting diverse types of &lt;a href=\"Miracles%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt;, mainly unleashing powerful &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;lightning spears&lt;/a&gt; or healing other enemies in their vicinity.\nTwo of them can be encountered as part of the &lt;a href=\"Prowling%20Magus%20and%20Congregation\"&gt;Congregation&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Brightstone%20Cove\"&gt;Brightstone Cove&lt;/a&gt;.

It is advisable to deal with him first, lest he starts shooting lightning spears at the player while engaging the dragon.\nStrategy.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Prowling%20Magus%20and%20Congregation\"&gt;Prowling Magus and Congregation&lt;/a&gt; boss battle, the priests should be the player's main targets, due to the fact that they heal all the enemies around them and their attacks are fast and deal high damage. They are relatively slow and can be &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;bed, which usually leads to a fast kill. Hiding behind the benches helps avoiding the priests &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Lightning Spears&lt;/a&gt;.\nOccasionally, the priest buffs himself up, making him much more resilient to damage. This buff can also affect other enemies around, but only rarely."}

Thus a player should approach with fire resistant equipment.\nHeadshots with a few poison arrows from long range will whittle down their health to below half. If you pepper them with arrows from afar, they will throw pyromancies from whatever range they're standing at, slowing down their pursuit and giving you time to build damage.\nBe careful not to pull the 2nd and 3rd ones (at the bottom of the stairs) at the same time, and if you lead them up the stairs, sprint past the Milfanito out to the ledge if you don't want her to get roasted.\nThey tend to uselessly spam Lingering Flame from medium range - watch for their windup being a small flame (Lingering Flame) rather than a huge one (Great Chaos Fireball). If you keep your distance and dodge (or even walk) sideways after each Great Chaos Fireball, their Lingering Flame casts will provide ample opportunity to hit them with a spell or (poison) arrow.

There are three varieties wielding either a sword, spear or crossbow.\nStrategy.\nIn general, Undead Soldiers have low &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, but can still be a considerable threat to new characters. They usually attack in small groups, augmenting their effectiveness.\nUndead Soldiers that wield crossbows are often positioned in out-of-the-way locations (usually on high ground) and act as a support class to the melee-focused Soldiers. When approached, they will either retreat and continue shooting, or draw a sword and act as a shieldless sword-wielder.\nSpear-wielding Undead Soldiers are more cautious fighters than their sword and crossbow counterparts, and will move slowly with their shield up until an opportunity to attack arises. It is also possible to take advantage of their slow movement speed and run away from them when dealing with other Undead, as other enemies can be dealt with before the spear-wielder makes its way to the player. Hitting them while they are in their defensive state usually provokes them to hit, making them vulnerable to Parrying. Strafing their attacks also opens them up for backstabs.\nMagic, such as &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Soul Arrow&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt;, is effective against them; some damage goes even through their shields. This is best used out of their reach, or before they are aware of the player.\nCritical attacks, the &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte\"&gt;Parry and Riposte&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Backstab\"&gt;Backstab&lt;/a&gt;, are exceedingly efficient methods to dispatch these enemies.\nAnother simple tactic is to kick their shields or attack when two-handing weapons, staggering them for a few moments, and thus leaving them vulnerable to attack. This is particularly useful on those that use spears, as they spend most of their time in a defensive stance.\nEnemy information.\nDefenses.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nSword=\nSpear=\nCrossbow=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nNotes.\nThe Hollow Soldier Swordsman to the left of the &lt;a href=\"Fang%20Boar\"&gt;Fang Boar&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Parish\"&gt;Undead Parish&lt;/a&gt; does not respawn after being killed."}

The Halberd soldiers can deal large amounts of damage in a single swing, though can be easily interrupted during their attacks like the other variants. After executing their combos they will be left vulnerable to a counterattack.\n&lt;a href=\"Bastard%20Sword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Bastard sword&lt;/a&gt; wielding soldiers attack in quick succession while being able to deal a high amount of damage, there is only a brief chance to strike after they execute their combos. These soldiers only a have a small gap to backstab them as they constantly turn in the player's direction. Those who throw &lt;a href=\"Firebomb%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Firebombs&lt;/a&gt; at the player will switch to a bastard sword when engaged at close range.\nSpear wielding soldiers use mostly lunging attacks with little tracking so they can be easily dodged by strafing to the side, however they can perform a sweeping attack.\nEstoc wielding soldiers strike at a medium speed and occasionally in a combo. Sometimes they will use their shield to guard. They are also capable of parrying the player.\nAttacks.\nHalberd wielding soldiers will combo their attacks by starting with a sweep then a follow up upward swing ended with a downward swing.\nSpear wielders perform triple lunges all behind their shield, sometimes tries to strike with their shields as well and has a sweeping attack that they sometimes perform.\nBastard sword wielders combo their strikes aggressively with a quick series of overhead swings and have a charging lunge attack that deals many hits with the first hits dealing little damage and the final hit dealing the full damage. This move is very similar to the lance's charging attack."}

It is possible to damage them prior to them opening the doors by attacking the doors.\nHollow Thieves can be tricky to engage in a melee, thanks to the speed and damage of their knife attacks. Timing blocks and attacks are consequently difficult, but very useful. Outside of its attacks, assassins can also shift into a parrying posture, raising shield up to one side while holding their daggers in front of them; most melee attacks used at this time have a high chance of being parried and riposted for high damage. Use of jumping attacks, kicks, and ranged attacks can help combat this."}

Accepting this offer allows the player to &lt;a href=\"Level%20Up%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;level up&lt;/a&gt; at total of five times at no &lt;a href=\"Soul%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; cost. Accepting a level from Yoel will grant the player with a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sigil\"&gt;Dark Sigil&lt;/a&gt; each time, which in turn affects the rate of Hollowing. Each subsequent level-up with Yoel will require a higher level of Hollowing before it can be accessed, meaning that the player must die a few times between each session.\nEffects.\nWhen the player has at least one Dark Sigil in their inventory, their Hollowing will increase with each death, by a multiple of the number of Dark Sigils carried. Once Hollowing reaches 15, the player will take on the appearance of a &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, just as in previous games, though the effect is purely cosmetic.\nAdditionally, at 15 Hollowing and beyond, the player unlocks the secondary effects of weapons &lt;a href=\"Infusion%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;infused&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Gem\"&gt;Hollow Gem&lt;/a&gt;, gaining bonus &lt;a href=\"Luck\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt; based on the upgrade level of the weapon.\nHollowing cures.\nThere are two different \"cures\" for Hollowing, one temporary and one permanent:\nReversing Hollowing.\nThe process of reversing Hollowing will remove all levels of Hollowing from the player. However, because they still possess Dark Sigils, they will resume Hollowing with each subsequent death, making the effect temporary. Thus, this \"cure\" is only cosmetic in nature, as well as losing access to the bonus Luck of Hollow-infused weapons.\nHealing the Dark Sigil.\nThe more permanent option for curing Hollowing is to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Keeper%20Soul%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire Keeper Soul&lt;/a&gt; and give it to the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Keeper%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire Keeper&lt;/a&gt;. The player must then pay a soul cost equal to the amount of souls they would pay to level up from their current level, by a number of levels equal to the amount of Dark Sigils held. Thus, if the player is high level and has accepted the additional Dark Sigils from &lt;a href=\"Anri%20of%20Astora\"&gt;Anri of Astora&lt;/a&gt;'s wedding, the price for healing the Dark Sigil can be extremely high.\nHealing the Dark Sigil is permanent, as it will remove all held Dark Sigils and reset Hollowing to zero. Because of this, it will break the alliance with Yuria of Londor, as the Dark Sigils are required for obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Usurpation%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Usurpation of Fire&lt;/a&gt; ending."}

If the orbs make contact with an enemy, object, or physical obstruction before activating, they will fizzle out and only do a very small amount of damage. When activated, each orb has a magic attack power of 0.95 times the catalyst's magic adjust\nHoming Soulmass activates at a closer range than usual against opponents who wear the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Fog\"&gt;Ring of Fog&lt;/a&gt;. It will not activate at all against opponents that use &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Body\"&gt;Hidden Body&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0\nThe number of orbs generated depends on &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; level, with up to five possible. If they haven't activated or collided with anything within 100 seconds of casting, the orbs will time out and disappear.\nThe following is a table outlining how many orbs are able to be generated for certain amounts of Intelligence.\nOverview.\nWhile Homing Soulmass deals high damage for a sorcery, the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Homing%20Crystal%20Soulmass\"&gt;Homing Crystal Soulmass&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0is superior in terms of damage in exchange for a higher &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; requirement. Therefore, Homing Soulmass is only competitive in PvP until Homing Crystal Soulmass is obtained. The regular version has the advantage of being obtainable twice per playthrough, compared to once for the Crystal variant, and is still useful against somewhat weaker &lt;a href=\"enemies\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; against whom the Crystal variant would be overkill.\nHoming Soulmass' greatest advantage is that it provides standing firepower. It can be cast before an engagement or in cover, and be fired while the player is blocking, fighting or firing another spell in parallel. Soulmasses prefer to fire at the nearest enemy in the direction the player is facing, and have a tendency to all target the same enemy.\nThe main weakness of Soulmasses is that the timing at which they fire cannot be controlled. This makes it somewhat ineffective against melee enemies using &lt;a href=\"shields\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt;, as it tends to fire while they are guarding, doing significantly reduced damage, whereas other projectile sorceries can be timed to hit when the enemy goes into an animation in which their guard is down. Another weakness of Soulmassess is that when fighting larger opponents, such as the &lt;a href=\"Bounding%20Demon%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Bounding Demon of Izalith&lt;/a&gt;, the spell will activate prematurely and expire before reaching the target's actual hitbox unless the player or the target run towards each other.\nAgainst ranged attack enemies, and many &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;es, who don't use shields, the spell is extremely effective, as the player can focus on blocking or dodging while it fires, and prepare new Soulmasses while in cover or between attacks. This is particularly useful in the fight against\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Ornstein%20and%20Executioner%20Smough\"&gt;Dragonslayer Ornstein and Executioner Smough&lt;/a&gt;, for example.\nDescription.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Official translation=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nNotes.\nHoming Soulmass was nerfed in &lt;a href=\"patch\"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt; 1.04/1.05, dealing less damage."}

The &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20One\"&gt;Ashen One&lt;/a&gt; first meets both characters camping near a &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Road%20of%20Sacrifices\"&gt;Road of Sacrifices&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike his polite and very talkative comrade, Horace limits himself to answer only with grunts and grumbles and never actually speaks. He gives the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Sentinels%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Blue Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Covenant%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt; token to the player upon 'talking' to him. At the end of &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Cathedral of the Deep&lt;/a&gt;, both Horace and Anri may be summoned to battle the &lt;a href=\"Deacons%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Deacons of the Deep&lt;/a&gt;. Both characters can be found a second time after the battle (regardless of whether or not they were summoned), resting at &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the Ashen One travels through the &lt;a href=\"Catacombs%20of%20Carthus\"&gt;Catacombs of Carthus&lt;/a&gt;, however, Anri can be found separated from their friend. Visibly concerned for the sake of their friend, Anri asks the Ashen One to come back to them if they learn something about Horace's whereabouts.\nHorace can be seen standing at the bottom of the large chasm below the hanging bridge that leads to &lt;a href=\"High%20Lord%20Wolnir\"&gt;High Lord Wolnir&lt;/a&gt;. The access to this location can be found via climbing down the bridge after destroying it to access &lt;a href=\"Smouldering%20Lake\"&gt;Smouldering Lake&lt;/a&gt;, and then navigating a long tunnel on the right side upon entering the lake proper. Upon approach, however, Horace will attack the player (presumably due to &lt;a href=\"hollow\"&gt;hollow&lt;/a&gt;ing), leaving no other option than to fight back. He wields a regular &lt;a href=\"Halberd%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Halberd&lt;/a&gt;, and will use its &lt;a href=\"Charge\"&gt;Charge&lt;/a&gt; skill quite often to close the distance. \nLocations.\n&lt;a href=\"Road%20of%20Sacrifices\"&gt;Road of Sacrifices&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Smouldering%20Lake\"&gt;Smouldering Lake&lt;/a&gt;"}

Upon &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, players lose all Humanity and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Soul%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; and revert to near-Hollow status. Recovering &lt;a href=\"bloodstains\"&gt;bloodstains&lt;/a&gt; allow players to regain all lost Souls and Humanity (although they do not become unhollowed).\nHumanity increases the &lt;a href=\"item%20discovery\"&gt;item discovery&lt;/a&gt; value; the more Humanity players have (up until 10 humanity), the higher the value is.\nHumanity also increases the power of &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt; weapons (up to 10 humanity) and &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt; resistance (up to 30 humanity).\nGaining Humanity.\nPlayers may use the item &lt;a href=\"Humanity%20%28item%29\"&gt;Humanity&lt;/a&gt; and the similar &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Humanities\"&gt;Twin Humanities&lt;/a&gt; to gain one or two points of humanity, respectively. Humanity is randomly acquired in an area up to a predetermined amount as long as players haven't killed the area &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; or helped the host defeat the area boss as a &lt;a href=\"White%20Phantom\"&gt;White Phantom&lt;/a&gt;. Red Phantoms leave a bloodstain worth one humanity upon defeat, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Marvelous%20Chester\"&gt;Marvelous Chester&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(\"&lt;a href=\"Artorias%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;AotA&lt;/a&gt;\"). The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Hand\"&gt;Dark Hand&lt;/a&gt;'s\u00a0strong attack steals humanity from other players and some NPCs.\nFarming Liquid Humanity.\nIn some areas, before the boss is defeated, certain enemies will increase your humanity count after many of them are killed. These enemies usually have one thing in common; they were once human, but are now undead and hollow. After a set number of an enemy type is killed, one humanity will be absorbed. Some enemies require fewer kills than others, as they have different values of 'humanity worth'.\nThe humanity worth meter is tied to each area, and the same enemy type can also have a different 'humanity worth' depending on the area.\nUsing Humanity.\nHumanity can be spent at bonfires to reverse Hollowing or to kindle bonfires. Reversal of hollowing allows players to summon other players and invade worlds; kindling increases the maximum amount of &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0charges a bonfire provides. Humanity is also needed to level up in the &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Servant\"&gt;Chaos Servant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darkwraith%20%28covenant%29\"&gt;Darkwraith&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Covenant\"&gt;Covenant&lt;/a&gt;s. Having a higher Humanity count increases resistance to Curses and increases attack power with Chaos weapons. However, only 1-10 humanity will affect the attack power of Chaos weapons."}

This means that as long as players have Humanity in their inventory, they will not need to worry about running low.\nHumanity is a popular item in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"Lloyd%27s%20Talisman\"&gt;Lloyd's Talisman&lt;/a&gt;s cannot block players from using humanity to heal; additionally, while phantoms cannot use Estus to heal in their hosts' world, they can use Humanity instead.\nHumanity is not such a popular item for healing in PvE, as it takes longer to heal than &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Estus&lt;/a&gt; and is harder to replenish, but it may be used as an emergency full heal if all Estus has been used already. \nDescription.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Official translation=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nLore (WIP).\nHumanities are flames of dark, reminiscent of a human, or rather drop, shape with a small head on top. They are usually found as small souls within human dead bodies or ingested by corpse-eating creatures: in certain cases, although, they can be much bigger in size to the point of surpassing a full grown man's stature and present two white eyes, together with the ability of moving freely.\nA humanity is a fragment of the original &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Soul\"&gt;Dark Soul&lt;/a&gt;, found by the &lt;a href=\"Furtive%20Pygmy\"&gt;Furtive Pigmy&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;: they are present in every human from birth, and the presence of such soul within a person is the very distinctive element that differentiates a human from any other anthropomorphic creature present in the \"Dark Souls\" world. This fact implies that humans are the only existing beings that possess two souls: one, the &lt;a href=\"Soul\"&gt;white Soul&lt;/a&gt;, is the essence of life as it is the energy of the First Flame, and the other, the dark one, a fragment of that very first, different Dark Soul. This soul is made of dark, and therefore is immortal, does not lose its intensity whenever it gets splitted (most likely when part of it is transferred into a newly conceived baby), allows the carrier to be immune of any harming effects of the dark and, most importantly, is able to have feelings."}

All playable characters are humans afflicted with the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Curse\"&gt;Undead Curse&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;Gods&lt;/a&gt;, the race of Men varies in size and physical appearance, but are almost consistently amongst the shortest of the races. It seems that size is naturally varied and has been for all time, as the &lt;a href=\"Ringed%20Knight\"&gt;Ringed Knight&lt;/a&gt;s are towering figures, while the Pygmy Lords are slightly shorter than modern man. \nAll human beings are made Human by a fragment of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Soul\"&gt;Dark Soul&lt;/a&gt;, known as their &lt;a href=\"Humanity%20%28item%29\"&gt;Humanity&lt;/a&gt;, which looks like a black sprite with blank white eyes. Humans are also capable of withstanding the Abyss, provided that they have not become untuned to it, and even find a sort of comfort in it.\nBy the time of that human's death, their Humanity could be in any number of states. Emotion seems to make Humanity stronger, but also unstable, and the human body can be mutated by its own essence if control is lost.\nHumans, thanks to their Dark Soul, possess \"&lt;a href=\"Luck\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt;\", an essential property that distinguishes them from other races and guarantees them a slight influence on reality and probability. Weapons infused with the power of a &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Gem\"&gt;Hollow Gem&lt;/a&gt; are able to peer into the darkness of its wielder and boost their attack based on their luck.\nLore.\nAge of Ancients.\nThe Humans were created by the &lt;a href=\"Furtive%20Pygmy\"&gt;Furtive Pygmy&lt;/a&gt;, a forgotten &lt;a href=\"Lords\"&gt;Lord&lt;/a&gt; from the dawn of Fire, who claimed a small spark known as the Dark Soul. With this soul, the Pygmy raised up the Human race, binding their nature with the Dark. When the other Lords prepared to battle the &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, they came to the Humans, and conscripted them into their ranks. To this, Humans began to forge arms and armor in the Abyss, which drew upon the power of a dark flame. &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of Light, and his children, the Gods, cast a seal of fire upon them due to their nature. So it was that the Human army, who were dubbed the Ringed Knights, set out with the Lords and their armies to eradicate the Everlasting Dragons, but due to their status, their roles were not recorded.\nAfter the war, Gwyn \"gifted\" the Human Lords a place called the &lt;a href=\"Ringed%20City%20%28location%29\"&gt;Ringed City&lt;/a&gt;, which sits far away at the end of the very world. He also gifted them his youngest daughter, the goddess &lt;a href=\"Filianore\"&gt;Filianore&lt;/a&gt;, promising her that he would come back for her. Though the humans spread throughout the world, many remained in the Ringed City as well.\nAge of Gods.\nIn the Ringed City, the true Dark Soul was spread out amidst several individuals, who became the Pygmy Lords. With the Dark Soul, they were ageless, and they and their descendants isolated themselves from the rest of the city. \nA spell fell on Filianore, and as long as she remained asleep, time had no influence on the city or its inhabitants. By the decree of an ill-described \"King,\" a &lt;a href=\"Spears%20of%20the%20Church\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt; was formed to protect Filianore from disturbance, most of its members being survivors of failed attempts to steal the Dark Soul. The last person, for much of history, to willingly become a member of this covenant was a missionary named &lt;a href=\"Halflight%2C%20Spear%20of%20the%20Church\"&gt;Halflight&lt;/a&gt;. Victims of the Abyss' corruption were resurrected from the Abyss, to help protect the city streets.\nDespite the fact that all of this was for the sake of the Human race, some were opposed to the loyalty to Gwyn, who even went so far as to raise a young Dragon named &lt;a href=\"Darkeater%20Midir\"&gt;Midir&lt;/a&gt; to combat the abyssal entities of the Ringed City. A few secretly wished for the sleeping princess Filianore to be awoken, and ruin cast upon the city, but such individuals are apparently few and far between in terms of open admittance. A race of beings called the &lt;a href=\"White-faced%20Locust\"&gt;White-faced Locust&lt;/a&gt; was risen from the Abyss to give sermons on the Dark, as they were kindred to Humans, but most were gluttonous and sought to eat people instead.\nMeanwhile, in a place called &lt;a href=\"Oolacile\"&gt;Oolacile&lt;/a&gt;, the land of golden sorceries, God-loyal humans were convinced by the &lt;a href=\"Darkwraith%20%28covenant%29\"&gt;Darkwraith&lt;/a&gt; leader named &lt;a href=\"Darkstalker%20Kaathe\"&gt;Kaathe&lt;/a&gt;, a primordial serpent loyal to the Pygmy, to raise up a &lt;a href=\"Manus%2C%20Father%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;primeval man&lt;/a&gt; who had been buried there. He went mad, and his Humanity bubbled over from his uncontrollable rage, mutating him into a dark monster. His Humanity overflowed and consumed the very world around him, generating &lt;a href=\"Chasm%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;another Abyss&lt;/a&gt;, and corrupting the citizens of Oolacile. &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Artorias\"&gt;Knight Artorias&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Knights%20of%20Gwyn\"&gt;four knights of Gwyn&lt;/a&gt;, would be corrupted by the Abyss.\nKaathe also manipulated the inhabitants of New Londo, where he enticed the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Kings\"&gt;Four Kings&lt;/a&gt; with the art of Lifedrain, which ancient Humans used to steal Humanity from others. Even they were corrupted, and New Londo was flooded, to contain the Abyss that generated there. But despite these failures, Kaathe kept searching for a human who could become the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Lord\"&gt;Dark Lord&lt;/a&gt;, and usher in the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Dark\"&gt;Age of Man&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the close of the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Age of Gods&lt;/a&gt;, Gwyn realized that the power of the Dark Soul would wax to its utmost maximum, while the power of the other &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Soul\"&gt;Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt;s would fade. Fearing that the world would be ruled by the Humans, Gwyn cast himself into the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, artificially extending the Age of Fire for another thousand years. At Gwyn's command, The Gods shepherded the Human race afterwards.\nOver time, others would repeat Gwyn's sacrifice-either for their own reasons or to follow in his footsteps-to rekindle the First Flame. As the First Flame was not intended to burn as long as it had, the fabric of reality began to suffer.\nLast Days of Fire.\nDozens of thousands of years have gone by, or even more than that, and the linking of the Fire has become a staple in the world. Finally, when the new \"&lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Lothric\"&gt;Prince Lothric&lt;/a&gt; was destined to sacrifice himself to the Flame, he refused and opted to watch the Age of Dark settle. To save the Age of Gods, four previous Lords of Cinder are resurrected as Undead, but three of them either sought the Age of Dark, or no longer cared either way. One last contingency plan existed, to awaken the &lt;a href=\"Unkindled\"&gt;Unkindled&lt;/a&gt;, who failed to prolong the Age of Fire with their sacrifices. Kaathe's will has been reinterpreted by the Sable Church of &lt;a href=\"Londor\"&gt;Londor&lt;/a&gt;, who aim for a different Age of Dark than what Kaathe sought; an age ruled by a Lord of Hollows.\nOn their quest, the Ashen One encounters the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Painted World of Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"The%20Painter\"&gt;little girl&lt;/a&gt; whose duty it is to become the new Painter, and replace it with a fresh, unrotted version. To do this, she reveals that she needs the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20the%20Dark%20Soul\"&gt;blood of the bearer of the Dark Soul&lt;/a&gt;, and that her guardian &lt;a href=\"Gael\"&gt;Gael&lt;/a&gt; has gone to find it. Just as the flames are reduced to embers and sparks, the entire world has begun to &lt;a href=\"Dreg%20Heap\"&gt;collapse&lt;/a&gt; in on itself, surrounding the ageless Ringed City. Gael travels to this heap of reality to find the Dark Soul, with the Ashen One following suit, eventually slaying &lt;a href=\"Judicator%20Argo\"&gt;Argo&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Spears of the Church.\nUpon doing so, they come across Filianore and awaken her. This transports the Ashen One to a desert of unknown nature containing the ruins of the Ringed City, Lothric, and Anor Londo. By the time Gael comes across the Pygmy Lords, their blood has dried up, though the Dark Soul keeps their decrepit remains alive. Gael kills and drinks the blood of the Pygmy Lords, becoming the new bearer of the Dark Soul. In his maddened state he fights the Ashen One, eventually discovering that he now bleeds the very blood that he once sought, and draws strength from the Dark Soul. Once he is vanquished, the Ashen One gives his blood to the Painter, who names the new painting in their honor."}

Simply strafing behind after it uses its bite attack is an effective way to defeat them as they provide a brief time for the player to strike. You could consider using ranged weapons to counter them.\nThey can be parried, although it can be tricky to do so as most of their attacks have very little starting lag. One may attempt to knock them off the edges in the Gutter, however doing so may prove difficult as they have a lot of poise and do not stagger easily.

After Licia's dialogue is exhausted, she will move to &lt;a href=\"Majula\"&gt;Majula&lt;/a&gt;, next to the disabled contraption. She will request 2,000 &lt;a href=\"Souls%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; to make the contraption turn, opening a clear path to Huntsman's Copse. Alternatively, the player can kill her for the &lt;a href=\"Rotunda%20Lockstone\"&gt;Rotunda Lockstone&lt;/a&gt; needed to operate the contraption.\nLore.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Curse\"&gt;Undead Curse&lt;/a&gt; started spreading all over &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt;, the Huntsman's Copse was used as an undead hunting ground. The &lt;a href=\"Iron%20King\"&gt;Iron King&lt;/a&gt; presided over these events and the many cells found here were originally built to imprison the undead prior to hunts. This practice came to an end once the curse had claimed most of Drangleic's populace, and hollow Captive Undead, Rogues, Skeletons, and other menaces now freely wander the copse."}

Provided that &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt; is properly managed, it can be a helpful asset for initiating aggro on enemies and even finishing them off.\nOnline gameplay.\nBecause of the delay in using this skill, it is easily dodged or interrupted if used by itself, as the wielder must close to within lock-on range of other players in order to stand a chance at hitting them, obviating the use of &lt;a href=\"Obscuring%20Ring\"&gt;Obscuring Ring&lt;/a&gt; for the element of surprise. This delay also makes it a poor skill to attempt to use in duels.\nWhere this ability really shines is in invasions, for finishing off an inattentive or fleeing player who is at low health. Because it deals more damage per throw than an arrow from a bow and takes less time to ready than a greatbow, it can serve as a rude surprise when an enemy tries to retreat to safe range to use their &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt;. It's also useful when an enemy player turns tail to flee at low health, as the spear has enough range to hit them in the back and finish them off."}

{"id": "2721", "revid": "49243392", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2721", "title": "Hydra", "text": "Hydras are in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\".\nLocation.\nA Hydra can be found at the bottom of &lt;a href=\"Darkroot%20Basin\"&gt;Darkroot Basin&lt;/a&gt; and another is found close to the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Lake\"&gt;Ash Lake&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe Hydra is a large sea monster with a body similar to a , but with tentacles underneath a shell-like structure and several long necks and heads. Each head can fire blasts of water from a distance or lunge into the ground for a close range attack.\nStrategy.\nThe Hydra can be defeated by severing its heads or by targeting the main body and using ranged attacks.\nAs the player moves closer to the shore, the Hydra will almost exclusively use its head strikes. After it lunges toward the player, each head will bury itself in the ground for a short time, presenting an opportunity to sever its vulnerable necks. As each head is defeated, the spread of the Hydra's attacks will diminish, making it easier for the player to finish the job.\nThe lunge attacks can be blocked or dodged. Certain spots can be found where the heads will completely miss the player. If the Hydra's position does not change, these spots can be exploited throughout the battle.\nDarkroot Basin.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Darkroot%20Basin\"&gt;Darkroot Basin&lt;/a&gt; Hydra rests in a deep pit beyond an otherwise shallow pond and hardly moves at all. By wearing the &lt;a href=\"Rusted%20Iron%20Ring\"&gt;Rusted Iron Ring&lt;/a&gt;, mobility will not be an issue throughout the fight, although care should be taken not to walk too far into the lake, risking a sudden death by sinking into deep water, whether by human mistake, by being pulled in by one of the Hydra's heads while it is retracting, or by being launched in by the &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;area of effect&lt;/a&gt; blast unleashed by the water projectiles.\n&lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Golem\"&gt;Crystal Golem&lt;/a&gt;s in the area can be damaged by the Hydra's water projectiles.\nAs the player approaches the Hydra at a distance from its front, the slightly elevated area on the left, from the player's perspective, is almost completely safe from the water projectiles; however, they are relatively easy to block. Although the player is relatively safe from health and stamina damage when blocking, the water projectiles can still deal substantial &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; damage through the shield. Alternatively, equipping the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Fog\"&gt;Ring of Fog&lt;/a&gt; will allow the player to approach the Hydra much closer. The monster will still start shooting projectiles, although at no specific direction until the player gets too near.\nWhile using a hit and run method, players can utilize the rock and tree near the edge of the water as cover from the water projectiles and head strikes. After the Hydra thrusts its heads into the ground, hack at one of the necks until the head is severed. Each head will land in the same relative position after every attack. The heads that land closest to the player will normally be chopped off first, while the last head will be very hard to hit with melee attacks. Because the remaining head will always miss the player even when standing still, this head can be safely dispatched with ranged attacks. A few shots will quickly sever the head and defeat the Hydra. Alternatively, the last head can be reached with close range weapons if the Hydra's position is shifted by running along the water's edge, or if the player starts running towards its landing spot the moment the attack is initiated.\nThe Darkroot Basin Hydra can also be approached from the opposite direction, taking the reverse shortcut from Darkroot Garden via the &lt;a href=\"Covenant%20of%20Artorias\"&gt;Covenant of Artorias&lt;/a&gt; door. From this direction, the heads can be eliminated by shooting it with arrows, with the exception of one, drastically reducing the threat of its water projectiles.\nAsh Lake.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Lake\"&gt;Ash Lake&lt;/a&gt; Hydra rests near the edge of a sandbar entering the lake. Some distance from the Hydra, a large log lies on top of a ridge of the sandbar. Sheltering behind this log will attract long range attacks from the Hydra, which will be blocked completely by the log. It is possible to shelter behind the log and attack the Hydra safely with a bow; the &lt;a href=\"Hawk%20Ring\"&gt;Hawk Ring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Greatbow\"&gt;Dragonslayer Greatbow&lt;/a&gt; are recommended. When the Hydra is already at very low health, the &lt;a href=\"Symbol%20of%20Avarice\"&gt;Symbol of Avarice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Covetous%20Silver%20Serpent%20Ring\"&gt;Covetous Silver Serpent Ring&lt;/a&gt; can be equipped to increase the number of souls gained when the Hydra dies. Equipping the Symbol of Avarice will mean shooting blind, but the Hydra is so large that it is easy to continue hitting its body (it is not necessary or advisable to aim for the heads), for the last few shots required to kill it.\nFor melee based characters, one of the major dangers while confronting the Hydra is actually reaching a distance where it starts lunging, as that means having to evade or block the constant barrage of homing water shots. Wearing the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Fog\"&gt;Ring of Fog&lt;/a&gt; allows the player to approach the Hydra without issues, to the point that it will only become hostile once the player is right in front of it, having a melee based fight for the most part from the beginning. Unlike the Hydra fight in &lt;a href=\"Darkroot%20Basin\"&gt;Darkroot Basin&lt;/a&gt;, the waters of the shore where this battle takes place is shallow, so the &lt;a href=\"Rusted%20Iron%20Ring\"&gt;Rusted Iron Ring&lt;/a&gt; is not necessary for this fight."}

Most players expected \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;\" to feature a standard Poise stat, such as that seen in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\" and \" &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\", but Hyper Armor works in a slightly different manner, which lead the community to think that &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; was not even working.\nEven if the game creator, &lt;a href=\"Hidetaka%20Miyazaki\"&gt;Hidetaka Miyazaki&lt;/a&gt;, during an interview confirmed that &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; was \"working as intended\", players who were wearing &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20Sets%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt; sets (such as &lt;a href=\"Havel%27s%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Havel's Set&lt;/a&gt;) noticed they were getting &lt;a href=\"stagger\"&gt;stagger&lt;/a&gt;ed by any kind of attacks, even those from the simplest &lt;a href=\"Enemies%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt;.\nThat was until the release of &lt;a href=\"Patch%201.08%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Patch 1.08&lt;/a&gt;, which fixed &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; and Hyper Armor functionality.\nOverview.\nHyper Armor is a new gameplay mechanic introduced in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;\" that applies to the effects of &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;. It activates during the attack animations of the player, allowing them to avoid getting staggered if receiving a hit during this time.\nThe Hyper Armor's activation depends on three factors:\nThis means that \"passive poise\", as seen in previous installments, does not apply anymore. The player must actually attack or they will get staggered nonetheless. There's an important thing to remember, though: small weapons (such as &lt;a href=\"Daggers%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Daggers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Straight%20Swords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Straight Swords&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) don't feature Hyper Armor at all.\nHyper Armor is also activated by some &lt;a href=\"Skill\"&gt;Skill&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"Stomp\"&gt;Stomp&lt;/a&gt; being an example), granting more efficiency during the effect. However, opponents may easily avoid the next attack, potentially making the skill useless (especially in PvP).\nTables.\nHere you can find tables for each category of weapons that can use Hyper Armor effectively:\nKey:"}

They deal damage just by touching them, which makes it not advisable to confront them in melee combat, as even if they are dispatched quickly, the player will run the risk of sustaining damage even if they did not get hit once.\nIt is recommended to always try to deal with them with ranged attacks first (bows or spells).

Each infusion costs 2,000 &lt;a href=\"Soul%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; and requires a stone corresponding to the infusion type, such as a &lt;a href=\"Firedrake%20Stone\"&gt;Firedrake Stone&lt;/a&gt; for a fire infusion. It is also possible to remove an infusion from a weapon at the cost of 1,000 souls and a &lt;a href=\"Palestone\"&gt;Palestone&lt;/a&gt;.\nApplying an infusion to a weapon, or removing one from a weapon, does not change the weapon's upgrade level. For example, applying a fire infusion to a &lt;a href=\"Longsword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Longsword&lt;/a&gt; +3 makes it a Fire Longsword +3. This is different from \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\"' &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Modification%23Ascension\"&gt;weapon ascension&lt;/a&gt; mechanic, which required upgrading weapons along certain paths to change the scaling or gain elemental damage.\nThere are weapons that take infusions very favorably and weapons that don't.

INT softcaps for spells are at 40/45/50. The INT softcaps for &lt;a href=\"unique%20weapons\"&gt;unique weapons&lt;/a&gt; that are upgraded with &lt;a href=\"Twinkling%20Titanite\"&gt;Twinkling Titanite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Titanite\"&gt;Demon Titanite&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Scale\"&gt;Dragon Scales&lt;/a&gt; is 40, with 50 INT being the softcap for all other types of INT scaling weapons.\nThe amount of damage you receive from spells does not scale linearly with the amount of INT you have. Spell damage directly correlates with the Magic Adjustment (MagAdjust) of the catalyst you use to cast spells, which is adjusted a slight, but not insignificant, amount by your INT stat. You should be expecting your damage to correlate more with the catalyst you are using rather than how high your intelligence is, with standard stat scaling being not as much of a factor. You should aim to level your INT only as high as the highest requirement spell or catalyst you intend on using. If you are trying to maximize your damage output, 41 and 44 are good thresholds to keep in mind because of &lt;a href=\"Logan%27s%20Catalyst\"&gt;Logan\u2019s Catalyst&lt;/a&gt; being the best to use starting at 41 Int and the sorcery &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Soul%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Crystal Soul Spear&lt;/a&gt; requiring 44 INT to cast.\nWeapon Scaling.\nThe following are &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; that scale with Intelligence, and their level of scaling, when not upgraded.

These character can still be spoken to if the requisite stats are lowered to an amount below the requirements with a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Vessel\"&gt;Soul Vessel&lt;/a&gt; as long as they were spoken to at least once previously.

A letter denoting a weapons specific scaling properties is noted beneath the weapon's required intelligence stat. The letters range in order of effectiveness from E, D, C, B, A, and S.\nWeapons and catalysts with an E rating for scaling will receive a poor benefit from investment in intelligence while weapons with an S rating receive the greatest benefit.\nNote: the term Catalyst refers to any medium used to cast spells.\nAs is with every other stat in the game, it also has indirect bonuses such as increasing the player character's flat damage absorption. In particular, leveling Intelligence will increase the player's flat defenses against &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; damage.\nSoft caps.\nDepending on the catalyst, weapon and &lt;a href=\"Infusion%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;infusion&lt;/a&gt;, leveling Intelligence to certain thresholds will maximize its potency with those tools.\nMost weapons that inflict innate Magic damage such as the &lt;a href=\"Moonlight%20Greatsword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Moonlight Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Longbow\"&gt;Darkmoon Longbow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aquamarine%20Dagger\"&gt;Aquamarine Dagger&lt;/a&gt; will reach peak efficiency at 40 Intelligence. As well, weapons that have been infused with a &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Gem\"&gt;Crystal Gem&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Simple%20Gem\"&gt;Simple Gem&lt;/a&gt; will also soft-cap at the same value.\nFor weapons that inflict innate &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; damage like the &lt;a href=\"Demon%27s%20Greataxe%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Demon's Greataxe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Onyx%20Blade\"&gt;Onyx Blade&lt;/a&gt;, Intelligence will generate noticeable returns, along with &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt;, up to values of 40. In the case of infusions using a &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Gem\"&gt;Chaos Gem&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Gem\"&gt;Dark Gem&lt;/a&gt;, Intelligence soft-caps at 30, along with the same amount in Faith.\n&lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Staves&lt;/a&gt; benefit most from Intelligence investment. The majority of staves will not begin to gain &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Buff\"&gt;Spell Buff&lt;/a&gt; until Intelligence has been leveled past 18. Once past this point though, staves will continue to increase in strength up until the 60 Intelligence mark is reached. In many cases, the rate of improvement will reduce past 45 Intelligence, so this is considered a minor soft-cap for pure Intelligence catalysts.\nDual-scaling catalysts will also benefit from leveling Intelligence, though in a different way, much like their melee analogues. &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20Flames%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Pyromancy Flames&lt;/a&gt; will scale with Intelligence up to 40, alongside Faith. Catalysts that specialize in casting Dark spells like &lt;a href=\"Izalith%20Staff\"&gt;Izalith Staff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sunless%20Talisman\"&gt;Sunless Talisman&lt;/a&gt; increase in effectiveness up to 45 Intelligence and 45 Faith. The &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Chime\"&gt;Crystal Chime&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most unique catalysts in the game, also soft-caps at 45 Intelligence and 45 Faith, though it also has a minor soft-cap at 30 Intelligence and 30 Faith."}

While invaded by or other &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player\"&gt;players&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fog%20Door\"&gt;Fog Door&lt;/a&gt;s appear in the general area and it becomes impossible to exit the game through the in-game menu.\nInvaders are still mortal to &lt;a href=\"Environmental%20Hazards\"&gt;environmental hazards&lt;/a&gt; and it is possible to bait a Player Invader towards the Hellkite Bridge and have the Drake incinerate the Invader with its initial fly-by attack. Also, Invaders are not immune to the lava in Lost Izalith or the poison swamps in Blighttown and players can lure Invaders into these hazards to kill them slowly.\nIf using an Eye Orb to invade, the player may use the eye orb again to cancel their invasion. Once the process of invading another world is initiated, as signalled by the message \"Invading another world,\" it cannot be cancelled with the exception of dying or exiting the game.\nCharacter invaders.\nWhile exploring in human\u00a0form, there are certain areas of the game that will trigger an invasion by a Black Phantom, otherwise known as &lt;a href=\"Phantom%23Red%20Phantoms\"&gt;Red Phantoms&lt;/a&gt;. These Black Phantoms will drop some combination of &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Humanity%20Mechanic\"&gt;humanity&lt;/a&gt;, and items, if applicable. These encounters will not occur while in Hollowed form, and will no longer trigger once the area &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; is killed. Some NPC Invaders have a non-phantom version of themselves somewhere in the game world.\nPlayer invaders.\nIf playing Online while exploring in non-hollow form, the world may be invaded by another &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;.\nDistinguishing invaders.\nPlayers may only invade one's world while playing online. NPC, or character Invaders always trigger when exploring in a certain area, and their name will exactly match their non-phantom version from the game world. Character Invaders can also invade even when playing offline. Character Invaders will attack on sight, and not stop attacking at any point until either the Player or the Invader is dead. That is to say, character Invaders will not make any gestures or stand still during their invasion. Any invader not listed below is a player invader.\nLocations of character invaders.\n&lt;a href=\"Depths\"&gt;Depths&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Kirk%2C%20Knight%20of%20Thorns\"&gt;Kirk, Knight of Thorns&lt;/a&gt;: Invades near the exit from the &lt;a href=\"Basilisk\"&gt;Basilisk&lt;/a&gt;s and may drop &lt;a href=\"Barbed%20Straight%20Sword\"&gt;Barbed Straight Sword&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Spiked%20Shield\"&gt;Spiked Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Blighttown\"&gt;Blighttown&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Maneater%20Mildred\"&gt;Maneater Mildred&lt;/a&gt;: In the Swamp, triggered by walking in the area near the &lt;a href=\"bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;.

Within the Dungeon a few shortcuts are available, as it has only one &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nIrithyll Dungeon serves as a prison, which the &lt;a href=\"Jailer\"&gt;Jailer&lt;/a&gt;s guard for Pontiff Sulyvahn, after having survived the destruction of the Profaned Capital. They loiter throughout the prison, wielding &lt;a href=\"Soldering%20Iron\"&gt;branding iron&lt;/a&gt; as a weapon against foes. The dungeon's first prisoner was the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Slave\"&gt;Giant Slave&lt;/a&gt;, residing to this day in his cell; then cells for humans were built. Irithyll Dungeon appears as a harsh place. It is described as a catacombs, of which escape is possible only by a small, barred window leading to an empty black pit, as it was the Jailers' cruel joke on escapees. &lt;a href=\"Jailer%20Handmaid\"&gt;Jailer Handmaid&lt;/a&gt;s, encountered later at the Profaned Capital, are said to take pleasure in wounding others. Karla, imprisoned in Irithyll Dungeon, at first mistakes the Ashen One asone of \"them\" surrounding her cell, described as \"skinny little heretics\". She warns thr player that this is the \"land of monstrosities\". Screams can be heard from cells. Prisoners were kept captive for no reason, and most have become Hollows. The prisoner chief has never left the prison, unable to use all the items he was storing in his cell.\nOne of the prisoners are &lt;a href=\"Wretch\"&gt;Wretch&lt;/a&gt;es. These dragon-like creatures are mutilating themselves, so their screams of agony are being heard in the whole dungeon. They are said to be wretched and failed attempts at becoming Dragons. They are the only enemies that drop &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Pine%20Resin\"&gt;Pale Pine Resin&lt;/a&gt;, said to contain bloody red substance apparently showing there's more to it than just resin. One of the Wretches is protecting a &lt;a href=\"Simple%20Gem\"&gt;Simple Gem&lt;/a&gt;, an object of fascination to stunted ones, which further suggests some kind of failure or deformation afflicting Wretches.\nSome items found inside the cells suggest the imprisonment of sorcerers. In the first part a &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Grub\"&gt;Corpse Grub&lt;/a&gt; that drops a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Magic%20Shield\"&gt;Great Magic Shield&lt;/a&gt; resides. Such sorcery could be used by sorcerer-swordsmen on special duty. Within the next cell an &lt;a href=\"Old%20Sorcerer%20Set\"&gt;Old Sorcerer Set&lt;/a&gt; lays, clothing used by &lt;a href=\"Vinheim\"&gt;Vinheim&lt;/a&gt; Dragon School sorcerers. &lt;a href=\"Xanthous%20Ashes\"&gt;Xanthous Ashes&lt;/a&gt;, found in one of the last cells patrolled by seven jailers, belonged to a sorcerer exploring golden sorceries of a \"long-lost land\". In the same cell the &lt;a href=\"Dusk%20Crown%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dusk Crown Ring&lt;/a&gt; is found, an artifact from Oolacile. As Oolacile was the home of golden sorceries, sought after by Xanthous scholars, it can be assumed that this well-guarded prisoner was searching for Oolacile sorceries."}

The swamp gives the player more room to battle it, allowing for increased maneuverability. It is recommended to clear out any nearby enemies before approaching the Dragonslayer as they may prove to be a fatal distraction.\nOne trait about this enemy is that once it detects the player, it will pursue them relentlessly around the swamp, even inside the submerged shrine and into the chamber containing the &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible to lure the Dragonslayer onto the bridge where &lt;a href=\"Darkeater%20Midir\"&gt;Darkeater Midir&lt;/a&gt; ambushes the player and use the dragon's fire breath to defeat it without having to engage it directly."}

The armor is finally rediscovered in the Ringed City, revived by the cursed abyssal swamp it resides in.\nCharacteristics.\nAs protection worn by a dragonslayer who served the divinity, the Iron Dragonslayer Set has very strong defenses.\nThe set provides very strong resistances to physical damage types across the board, though like other plate metal sets it has a severe weakness to &lt;a href=\"Strike%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Strike&lt;/a&gt; damage. In order to ground its wielder against the very lightning it wields, the set also has strong defense against &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage, and is also quite resistant to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt;. However, it has weaknesses against &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage. It has relatively strong resistance against &lt;a href=\"Negative%20Status%20Effects%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;status effects&lt;/a&gt;, being particularly resistant to &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt; buildup, though it does not tolerate &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt; buildup well.\nWith a moderately high weight compared to other heavy armor sets, the Iron Dragonslayer Set provides very good &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;, allowing its wearer to easily wield and trade with ultra weapons."}

During this time, the player becomes metallic and receives greatly reduced physical damage (incoming attack power reduced by 40%), an increase of lightning damage taken (incoming attack power increased by 45%), as well as an immunity to staggering. Exceptions are attacks with large stun animations, such as those that flatten the target, knocked them into the air, or sent them flying backwards, which are reduced to roughly the same stun as being kicked. Users are also granted a high deflection bonus to their person, causing many attacks to bounce off them, which deals less damage and staggers opponents, leaving them open to extra damage during the stagger animation. However, their movement speed is greatly decreased (reducing their mobility to the point where it's as if they're past 100% their equipment load), preventing rolls, backsteps, and sprinting.\nOverview.\nPre-patch 1.04/1.05, Iron Flesh was immensely powerful and popular for taking down bosses such as the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Kings\"&gt;Four Kings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;. However, it has since been nerfed drastically and is no longer very effective, greatly decreasing the practicality of using it.\nIron Flesh is almost never used in PvP, as the increased defense rarely, if ever, justifies the massive movement penalty."}

In its left hand it carries a large &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; that can release a deadly wind projectile. The right is used to either smash, or grab and hurl the enemy into the ground. Due to its size and weight, the golem has difficulty regaining balance, and falling would mean it has somehow been overpowered. Before the battle it is dormant, waiting with its weapon held by both hands against its chest, where a circular depression symbolizes its initial emptiness.\nLore.\nThe Iron Golem is a construct created by the &lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;Gods&lt;/a&gt; with the purpose of acting as a guardian for their city of &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;. The golem is essentially a hunk of iron that makes up its &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Set\"&gt;iron armor&lt;/a&gt; of immense weight and is equipped with a heavy &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Axe\"&gt;iron axe&lt;/a&gt; capable of releasing a powerful blade of wind. The construct is animated by a &lt;a href=\"Core%20of%20an%20Iron%20Golem\"&gt;core&lt;/a&gt; that the gods created by infusing the bone of one of the archdragons they had defeated with the power of souls.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord Gwyn&lt;/a&gt; sacrificed himself to link the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; and prolong the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Age of Fire&lt;/a&gt;, the Iron Golem was placed to act as the last ritual challenge of &lt;a href=\"Sen%27s%20Fortress\"&gt;Sen's Fortress&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, the Undead who tried to follow in Gwyn's footsteps to sacrifice themselves to the Flame would have to be tested even before obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Lordvessel\"&gt;Lordvessel&lt;/a&gt; and seeking powerful souls. Ringing the &lt;a href=\"Bells%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Bells of Awakening&lt;/a&gt; represents only the first of these challenges, and success means gaining access to &lt;a href=\"Sen%27s%20Fortress\"&gt;Sen's Fortress&lt;/a&gt; to be tested further. For the Undead who manage to overcome the tests and dangers of the fortress, the Iron Golem represents the last challenge to access the city of the gods. The construct has served its purpose well and, over the centuries, slayed countless heroes seeking to reach Anor Londo.\nSummoning.\nIt is possible to summon the &lt;a href=\"White%20Phantom\"&gt;White Phantom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Iron%20Tarkus\"&gt;Black Iron Tarkus&lt;/a&gt; to help in the fight. His summon sign can be found across the bridge to the right of the &lt;a href=\"fog%20door\"&gt;fog door&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoss information.\nAttacks.\nBlade of Wind.\nFrom a distance, the Iron Golem will charge up a swing, and slash the air sending a sharp wind projectile toward the player.\u00a0\nAxe Combo.\nAt close range, the Golem will swing its axe in a horizontal motion up to three times.\nIron Foot Stomp.\nIf you stay close at its feet for too long, the Iron Golem will stomp either three times in a row with its left foot, or two times in a row with its right foot.\nGround Punch.\nThe Golem will slowly bring its hand up and then punch the ground in front with full force. This can be avoided by quickly rolling through its legs, and then attack it as it hits the ground.\nAxe Slam.\nThe Iron Golem will slam its axe downward with full force. Attempting to block the attack will knock the player back a fair bit. This can be avoided by running or rolling away.\nGrab and Hurl.\nThe enemy will attempt to &lt;a href=\"grab\"&gt;grab&lt;/a&gt; the player with its hand; the hitbox is located in front and between its legs. If it connects, the Golem will throw the player into the ground or off the ledge, causing huge damage and possibly death.\nSweep.\nIf the player is positioned behind the Iron Golem for too long, it will sweep its foot backward.\nSide Slash.\nThe Golem will swing its axe toward the ground vertically by its legs. This attack has a large hitbox and it can be very difficult to try and roll through it.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls \u2014 Iron Golem by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4tl0qd65lc&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

As well, its wielding requirements are easily met, making weight the only real concern.

As with other Small Shields, it is ideally used to &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt; enemies due to its faster startup frames.\nUpgrades.\nReinforced with standard ."}

Despite his grand claims, the description makes the Iron Set to be a rather plain (but also dependable) suit of armor.\nCharacteristics.\nWith unspectacular &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;physical defenses&lt;/a&gt; when fully upgraded the Iron Set seems remarkably unimpressive for when it becomes available. However, this is offset by its unusually high &lt;a href=\"Elemental\"&gt;elemental defenses&lt;/a&gt;; of the medium armor sets, and when fully upgraded, Solaire's set has the third highest &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Magic Defense&lt;/a&gt;, relatively high &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Flame Defense&lt;/a&gt; and the second highest &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Lightning Defense&lt;/a&gt; within its weight class.\nOne of the biggest advantages of Solaire's personal equipment, however, is its &lt;a href=\"weight\"&gt;weight&lt;/a&gt;; it is the third lightest medium armor set in the game. This makes it one of the most efficient armor sets when considering the ratio of defense to weight, and it's an excellent choice for players who wish to have good protection but still remain mobile.\nThe Iron Set offers overall mediocre &lt;a href=\"Auxiliary%20Effects\"&gt;resistances&lt;/a&gt; but moderate &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Curse Resist&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the main drawbacks it has is that &lt;a href=\"Solaire%20of%20Astora\"&gt;Solaire of Astora&lt;/a&gt; must be killed to get it \u2013 either as part of his quest line, or at one of his encounters."}

Lava pours out of one of their shoulders, and although it doesn't deal heavy damage, it will most likely stagger the player if they get caught in it. The lava also may blow up nearby &lt;a href=\"Cask%20Runner\"&gt;Cask Runner&lt;/a&gt;s if they come into contact with it. Similarly to &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Warrior\"&gt;Ashen Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, Iron Warriors can hide under the ashen ground, and will pop up if the player gets too close.\nStrategy.\nThe best way to go about fighting Iron Warriors is to either attack them from afar (since they have no ranged attacks) or to circle around them and attack after they attack. Their attacks have a long enough recovery for the player to be able to get in a few hits before they start swinging again.\nAlternatively, should it fall victim to a Cask Runner, two explosions is enough to kill one."}

This implies that &lt;a href=\"Vendrick\"&gt;Vendrick&lt;/a&gt; was able to obtain the means to control or create these mighty warriors. They never spoke a word nor showed their faces, likely due to their souls being embedded into the armor itself, rather than a creature within.\nDescription.\nThey are almost exactly like the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Old%20Ironclad%20Soldier\"&gt;Old Ironclad Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s, their differences being their shinier armor, larger health pool, and higher stats.\nStrategy.\nIronclad Soldiers are slow moving, but hit quite hard. One strategy is to circle around it and dodge its slam attack, which it does when you are behind it, and then attack as it stands up. It is also easy to use hit-and-run tactics by baiting it into doing its overhead swing, moving just out of range and then attacking as it recovers.\nEvading is more effective than blocking due to its attacks eating up a lot of &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey appear to be susceptible to ranged attacks. Retain a safe distance while casting/shooting and watch for its charge attack, which can quickly close that distance.\nAs with the Old Ironclad Soldier, they're weak to &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttacks.\nSmash: Performs an overhead smash. Slows player movement if near point of impact. Unblockable.\nSwing: Performs a broad swing with the mace.\nMace Combo: Performs a 4 swing combo. The fourth swing is done with a delay after the 3 swings have been performed.\nBody Slam: When the player is ever behind this foe, it will perform a body slam with their backs. Unblockable.\nBackstab: Very rarely, performs a sidekick to the player's shin then transitions to an overhead slam to the player's back."}

Her swings are somewhat slow but do high damage and will easily break the player's guard if the attacks are blocked, so it is advisable to evade them unless using a high &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt; shield.\nShe can use &lt;a href=\"sharpen\"&gt;sharpen&lt;/a&gt; which will further increase her damage and heal a small amount of HP with each hit; however, this leaves her completely exposed for the duration of the buffing animation.\nShe will also start throwing &lt;a href=\"Dung%20Pie%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dung Pies&lt;/a&gt; if the player remains at range for too long, which inflict &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Toxic&lt;/a&gt; status.\nAlthough risky, a quick way to defeat Isabella is to knock her off the path where she resides. She will occasionally fall off by herself if the player fights her close to the edge.\nShe can be ignored entirely, as she hides in the tunnel underneath the Corvian Storyteller, only coming out when the tunnel is entered far enough (usually the first item's placement). Thus you can fight her when more leveled and/or stronger than beginning equipment. You can also bait her by entering the tunnel and then running away; she will return to it after she loses sight of the player. As she does not go back to her starting position but rather just inside the tunnel's mouth, you can stand on the other side and cast &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Mist%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poison Mist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20Mist%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Toxic Mist&lt;/a&gt; or the weapon art of the &lt;a href=\"Storyteller%27s%20Staff\"&gt;Storyteller's Staff&lt;/a&gt; to kill her with stealth."}

As an example, if a player has an Item Discovery of 100, and a &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Tongue\"&gt;Pale Tongue&lt;/a&gt; has a 1% drop rate, the player's drop rate will be equal to 1%. If the Item Discovery is increased to 400 then the drop rate will increase to 4%. Therefore, maximizing Item Discovery is suggested during farming; otherwise, drops will be few and far between, making a farming session exhausting.\nA recommended farming strategy takes place at the end of a playthrough (before heading into a &lt;a href=\"New%20Game%20Plus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;NG+&lt;/a&gt;). The player can respec their character to reflect 100 &lt;a href=\"Luck\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt;, followed by equipping the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Sage%27s%20Rapier\"&gt;Crystal Sage's Rapier&lt;/a&gt; (even if the &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; requirement is not met, the Item Discovery bonus is given, so it may be equipped in the off-hand), while wearing the &lt;a href=\"Symbol%20of%20Avarice%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Symbol of Avarice&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Covetous%20Gold%20Serpent%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Covetous Gold Serpent Ring&lt;/a&gt;. Following this guideline should bring a player to 350+ Item Discovery. Additionally, a player can consume a &lt;a href=\"Rusted%20Coin%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Rusted Coin&lt;/a&gt; to increase Item Discovery by 50, or a &lt;a href=\"Rusted%20Gold%20Coin\"&gt;Rusted Gold Coin&lt;/a&gt; to increase Item Discovery by 100.\n&lt;a href=\"Unbreakable%20Patches\"&gt;Unbreakable Patches&lt;/a&gt; will sell Rusted Coins for 200 &lt;a href=\"Souls%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt;. If Patches is dead, then the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20Handmaid\"&gt;Shrine Handmaid&lt;/a&gt; will sell the Rusted Coins for 50 souls if she is given &lt;a href=\"Patches%27%20Ashes\"&gt;Patches' Ashes&lt;/a&gt;."}

He wears intricate &lt;a href=\"Gundyr%27s%20Set\"&gt;cast-iron armor&lt;/a&gt; and wields a &lt;a href=\"Gundyr%27s%20Halberd\"&gt;halberd&lt;/a&gt;. On his back, oily black tendrils indicate that he is infested with the Pus of Man.\nLocation.\nFound in the &lt;a href=\"Cemetery%20of%20Ash\"&gt;Cemetery of Ash&lt;/a&gt;, near the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt;. He is first found kneeling down and is immune to damage. Once the &lt;a href=\"Coiled%20Sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; in his chest has been removed, he will rise and the battle will begin.\nFight overview.\nStrategy.\nGundyr cannot be damaged until the &lt;a href=\"Coiled%20Sword\"&gt;Coiled Sword&lt;/a&gt; has been removed from his chest. Once done, he will begin to rise and is vulnerable to damage, even though his health bar won't appear until he has taken up his weapon. This allows the player to deal substantial damage at the beginning of the fight without Gundyr retaliating.\nWhile his attacks seem menacing and aggressive, most of them have poor tracking, are very slow, and are also amply telegraphed. Retaining a medium distance from him will help to avoid his attacks accordingly. Rolling either behind him, through his attacks or both will allow the player to punish Gundyr with several hits at a time.\nWhen about half of his health has been depleted, a gigantic &lt;a href=\"Pus%20of%20Man\"&gt;Pus of Man&lt;/a&gt; will emerge from within his body and change the mechanics of the battle considerably. While impressive at first, this incarnation also suffers severely from poor tracking, although it does have a higher damage output.\nRemaining behind Gundyr and rolling according to the attack he uses is an effective method for avoiding damage in this second half of the fight. Most of his attacks make him pause to recover, which allows the player to land successive attacks.\nIn keeping a long distance from Gundyr, he will become more aggressive. As such, backing too far away can result in Gundyr dealing great amounts of damage to an unprepared player."}

It also has the lowest stability of any weapon in the game, making it inefficient for blocking, and it is considered the second lightest weapon in the game, just behind the &lt;a href=\"Handmaid%27s%20Ladle\"&gt;Handmaid's Ladle&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the other major drawbacks of the Ivory Straight Sword is without a doubt its requirements, as it is necessary to possess points in &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;, and the weapon possesses no scaling and cannot be buffed or &lt;a href=\"Infusion\"&gt;infused&lt;/a&gt;, thus severely limiting its potential in combat. It can, however, be used in conjunction with &lt;a href=\"Flynn%27s%20Ring\"&gt;Flynn's Ring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Blades\"&gt;Ring of Blades&lt;/a&gt;, with their full effect, thus augmenting its damage a by a maximum of 100 damage.\nIf the requirements of this weapon are not met, then the Ivory Straight Sword will behave differently, in that its white beam will not be manifested when swung, and the weapon itself will deal about 10~15 points of damage. In essence, if the players do not have the necessary requirements, then the Ivory Straight Sword becomes \"worse\", than the previously mentioned Handmaid's Ladle, which is already by itself considered a \"joke weapon\".\nContrary to popular belief, however, the Ivory Straight sword is indeed very powerful, albeit very situational. Though it is mediocre at best when riposting or backstabbing, it has an amazingly powerful two-handed strong attack, so powerful in fact that it has the potential to inflict almost 1500 damage in a single strike. However, it must be stressed that this strong attack comes at the price of having a \"sweet spot\" that can only be executed perfectly by staying at a certain distance of an enemy, or if the enemy is large enough, then the attack will deal its full damage. It also must be noted that this attack takes quite some time to deliver, and as such must be timed correctly."}

Behind that chest is a second illusory wall which leads to a drop-down alcove, above several Basilisks, where the staff can be found.\nCharacteristics.\nThe Izalith Staff is a very unique staff which is suited to casting &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Sorceries&lt;/a&gt;.\nNormal Sorceries cast using this staff do not benefit from &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt;, contrary to the description. Rather, standard Sorceries will only use the catalyst's &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Buff\"&gt;Spell Buff&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; to calculate damage output. This means that, when casting Sorceries such as &lt;a href=\"Great%20Heavy%20Soul%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Great Heavy Soul Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, the Izalith Staff performs very poorly when compared to most other staves.\nHowever, the flip side is that when casting Dark Sorceries such as &lt;a href=\"Great%20Deep%20Soul\"&gt;Great Deep Soul&lt;/a&gt;, Spell Buff from Faith is accounted for, meaning that the staff's displayed Spell Buff is utilized to its fullest. Furthermore, Dark Sorceries cast from this staff benefit from an approximately 57% damage boost, greatly magnifying their damage output. Unlike the &lt;a href=\"Murky%20Longstaff\"&gt;Murky Longstaff&lt;/a&gt;, the Izalith Staff &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;scales&lt;/a&gt; strongly with both Intelligence and Faith, meaning that should the wielder be able to invest great amounts of points into both stats, the Izalith Staff becomes the most powerful catalyst in the game for casting Dark Sorceries.\nUpgrades.\nReinforced with &lt;a href=\"Twinkling%20Titanite%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Twinkling Titanite&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

They are tall humanoid enemies that carry lanterns and wield branding irons in combat. Their lanterns emit a gas that is most likely only to signify an aggro toward the player. It does no damage, nor inflicts any sort of effect buildup.\nBy far their most dangerous ability is to rapidly reduce the player's maximum &lt;a href=\"HP%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; just by looking in their direction. Their weapons also slow your movement and negate the use of Estus. Both attacks combined make for a devastating combination that can kill a player with full health in just a few seconds.\nLocation.\nFound in the two cell blocks of the &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20Dungeon\"&gt;Irithyll Dungeon&lt;/a&gt;, with seven of them patrolling the second one and one more guarding &lt;a href=\"Karla\"&gt;Karla&lt;/a&gt;'s cell. Additionally, Hollow versions of the Jailers who do not have Soldering Irons can be found in between the two cell blocks.\nStrategy.\nJailers often patrol in groups and it is vital that the player picks them off one by one or their health will drop rapidly. Although this effect only lasts for a short time, it can be potentially lethal if other enemies are nearby, so eliminating Jailers should be prioritized over lesser foes.\nIf they detect the player, they will emit a red aura and begin laughing before rushing toward their location. Using ranged weapons to kill them before the debuff takes effect is recommended. If forced into close ranged combat, staying behind them will prevent the health drain.\nFortunately, they are very slow and tend to leave their backs open for &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;backstabs&lt;/a&gt; frequently. They are also not very aggressive and hiding from them for just a few seconds is usually enough for them to stop chasing. They are notably slow while turning around, giving the player ample time to backstab them before they turn hostile.\nIf they are attacked with enough force, they will get knocked down. This is both an advantage and a hindrance, since they will be left open for a finishing blow, but at the same time they may land away from the player's reach, allowing them to stand up and commence their health draining attack."}

The spell benefits from moderately high damage, as well as very fast &lt;a href=\"casting%20time\"&gt;casting time&lt;/a&gt;; this is offset by its low number of casts and its very high slot requirement.\nWhile the damage of this spell is outdone by &lt;a href=\"Great%20Chaos%20Fireball%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Great Chaos Fireball&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Swathe\"&gt;Flame Swathe&lt;/a&gt;, its true strength lies in its surprisingly low casting time and alarming travel speed. This serves as one of the more useful spells overall in &lt;a href=\"PvP%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; as it can be used to take near instant advantage of openings in the enemy's defenses. \nAttunement milestones.\nLike all other spells, the amount of casts per slot increases upon reaching certain &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Attunement&lt;/a&gt; milestones:"}

The blast does no damage, but serves to slow enemies and give the player some breathing space. Force has a very short cast time, the fastest in the game in fact, so players can with practice integrate force into their core melee tactics with relative ease. It also renders all ranged attacks (be they magical or otherwise) harmless if timed right.\nForce has a very short range, much shorter than its visual effect, so it may take some getting used to. Timing is thus essential when using Force. Force's range can be extended slightly through &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20Synergy\"&gt;miracle synergy&lt;/a&gt;. Force also does not stagger large enemies such as Giants.\nOverview.\nForce has a number of interesting applications. In PvE, it can help to temporarily incapacitate enemies, allowing players to either escape or prepare their next attack. In &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, Force can be used in all sorts of ways. For example, successfully staggering hostile players with force at very close range can give players enough time to run behind them for the backstab. It is possible to reverse the knockback direction - if the player is locked onto an enemy but is facing the opposite direction when Force is cast, the enemy will instead stumble or fall towards the player as opposed to away from; meaning they are more vulnerable to a backstab due to how they are considerably closer. Force is visually very similar to a much more dangerous spell, &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Gods\"&gt;Wrath of the Gods&lt;/a&gt;, and it can be used to intimidate and mislead enemy players into backing away from players. Yet another application of Force is purely environmental; it can easily blast enemy players off cliff faces for an easy kill, and it can demolish inanimate objects, getting rid of potentially hazardous obstacles.\nCounters.\n&lt;a href=\"Rolling\"&gt;Rolling&lt;/a&gt; at the right time against a Force user negates all staggering effect Force has. Staying away from cliff faces will minimize the chances of being blasted off. Force is much more dangerous in confined areas, so try to fight in open spaces against a Force user.\nIn terms of equipment, wearing very light equipment allows players to be knocked off their feet, granting invincibility frames; on the other end of the spectrum, using a shield with high stability will minimize the potential danger Force users pose.\nDescription.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Official translation=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

They are exclusive to the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and DirectX 11 versions of the game.\nDescription.\nForlorn are invaders clad in black armor who wield either a &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20the%20Forlorn\"&gt;reaper&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Greatsword%20of%20the%20Forlorn\"&gt;greatsword&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike other &lt;a href=\"dark%20spirit\"&gt;dark spirit&lt;/a&gt;s, their invasions can occur at random and their armaments are randomized as well, and as such they can be hard to predict and prepare for. Furthermore, they can choose to invade immediately upon players entering their domain, or long after the boss of the area has been defeated, meaning they can catch players off-guard with inadequate or unsuitable equipment.\nStrategy.\nThe Forlorn are not susceptible to &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;-type &lt;a href=\"Negative%20Status%20Effects%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;status ailments&lt;/a&gt; (this includes Toxic as well); however, they are susceptible to &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt;. This means that the only way to reliably defeat them is to engage them in direct combat. Depending on the type of weapon they are wielding, different strategies should be adopted.\nForlorn are smart fighters, capable of using &lt;a href=\"guard%20break\"&gt;guard break&lt;/a&gt;s against players who constantly keep their shields up, as well as rolling to avoid attacks. However, the unwieldiness of their weapons means that players may easily find gaps in their attacks to either get hits in or to retreat and heal safely. As well, their lack of shields means they are quite vulnerable to ranged spell damage and even regular attacks against their guards can deal chip damage. Their block can even be taken advantage of via use of guard breaks to stun them and deal some damage.\nThey are also quite tanky as they have good &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt;, and often outright ignore multiple attacks from weapons with lower poise damage before staggering, as such, using the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Ring\"&gt;Stone Ring&lt;/a&gt; will vastly improve the odds of surviving against these enemies.\nThere are two variants:\nGreatsword: Will often try to get in one- or two-hit attacks, and perform rolling and jumping attacks when possible. These can be reliably blocked using a shield or evaded with good rolling, and then punished with attacks during their recovery.\nScythe: They represent a far greater threat, as the dead-angling nature of their &lt;a href=\"reapers\"&gt;reapers&lt;/a&gt; allow them to bypass shields if they attack at the right range, and quickly eviscerate unprepared players. The best approach for defeating these type of Forlorn is to equip a short weapon, such as a &lt;a href=\"Straight%20Swords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;straight sword&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Thrusting%20Swords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;thrusting sword&lt;/a&gt;, and baiting their attacks up-close. By getting right in their face, players can get inside of the reaper's ineffective range and completely block the attack with their shield, possibly causing a deflection and getting good hits in while the Forlorn is recoiling.\nBe warned, however, as Forlorn can sometimes chain a special double slice after their initial swing that can take players by surprise and hit for massive damage.\nIt's important to note that all Forlorn will always use jumping attacks whenever a player drinks from their &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt; in close proximity. This is a guaranteed strategy and is locked in their AI.\nLocations.\n&lt;a href=\"Aldia%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Aldia's Keep&lt;/a&gt;\nRandom encounters.\n&lt;a href=\"Black%20Gulch\"&gt;Black Gulch&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Brightstone%20Cove%20Tseldora\"&gt;Brightstone Cove Tseldora&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Brume%20Tower\"&gt;Brume Tower&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Dragon's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Castle\"&gt;Drangleic Castle&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Peak\"&gt;Earthen Peak&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Forest%20of%20Fallen%20Giants\"&gt;Forest of Fallen Giants&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Eleum%20Loyce\"&gt;Frozen Eleum Loyce&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Harvest%20Valley\"&gt;Harvest Valley&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Huntsman%27s%20Copse\"&gt;Huntsman's Copse&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Iron%20Keep\"&gt;Iron Keep&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Shaded%20Woods\"&gt;Shaded Woods&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Amana\"&gt;Shrine of Amana&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Bastille\"&gt;The Lost Bastille&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Undead%20Crypt\"&gt;Undead Crypt&lt;/a&gt;"}

The culture and organization of the Forossa army rightly recognized and rewarded their soldiers for their strength, determination and diligence on the battlefield and those who distinguished themselves with these qualities could, in the course of their lives, ascend from mere peasants to generals. \nThe main deity of the kingdom was &lt;a href=\"Faraam%2C%20God%20of%20War\"&gt;Faraam, God of War&lt;/a&gt;, demonstrating together how their country's situation of endless war and their culture that valued fighting influenced their religion which in turn reinforced their warrior mentality. The priests of the war god and Forossan sages were those who led the knights of the kingdom into battle. They were wise men who obtained their title and role only after completing a rigorous journey of hardship to the north, in the region in which Eleum Loyce would one day arise, and were thus called \"Northwarders\" and worshiped as the agents of Faraam. These sages of Forossa were skilled sorcerers and when they were already experienced they could craft strong, even if rough, staves that greatly intensified their spells and magic damage despite drastically reducing their spell usage, evidence of their prowess to get the most out of reduced resources available.\nThe most important order among the Forossan knights was that of the Lion Knights, composed of mighty warriors who wore &lt;a href=\"Faraam%20Set\"&gt;heavy armor&lt;/a&gt; and were feared for their nimble two-handed swordplay, identifying them as a group trained in both enormous physical strength to wield two-handed weapons while wearing heavy armor and staying quick on their feet . However this order was also known as a group of the most disparate people united by the fact of being rabid fighters and their warriors were more similar to raging mad beasts on the battlefields. The powerful soldiers, conditioned by the situation of their land, could not even imagine other ways of living and could not see what could happen when fighting stopped. Their armor, which made them recognizable and famous, depicting a knight fighting an ancient archdragon on the helmet, had the name of their god of war and was blessed directly by Faraam, making them quite resistant against fire.\nSpecial and powerful &lt;a href=\"Black%20Firebomb%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;black firebombs&lt;/a&gt;, capable of causing large flames and explosions, were also developed in Forossa. These bombs, due to their risk of causing harm to their owners, were subject to strict standards for their safe storage defined by the government's law.\nDespite the strength of its army, Forossa eventually fell apart due to prolonged conflicts with its neighbors, the kingdom exhausted to the point that the entire military and government structure collapsed and its territory became lawless. The end of the country left its citizens landless and entirely to their own devices, leading them to become &lt;a href=\"bandit\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt;s and thieves that infested the outskirts of their fallen home in order to survive or scattered to various lands. Without an element of cohesion anymore and a culture based only on fighting, the remaining Forossan knights become mercenaries, selling their fighting strength to foreign countries and armies and throwinng themselves into the wars of others. Among these Lion Knight mercenaries such as &lt;a href=\"Vengarl%20of%20Forossa\"&gt;Vengarl of Forossa&lt;/a&gt;, once a ferocious warrior on the battlefield, came to &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; and served under the command of &lt;a href=\"Vendrick\"&gt;King Vendrick&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Burnt%20Ivory%20King\"&gt;highest ranking knight&lt;/a&gt; of Forossa, together with Forossan sages and knights, abandoned his home too and moved to the northeast of Drangleic before reaching a land, that was plagued by a &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Chaos\"&gt;fragment&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, the source of the &lt;a href=\"Flame%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Flame of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; and seedbed of the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20%28lore%29\"&gt;Demons&lt;/a&gt;, that had survived and had started to give birth to atrocities and monsters , cursing the region and leading people to flee in fear. The proud knight saw the suffering of the population and decided to devote himself to the protection of that land. And so he took his crown as their new leader and started to fight the raging Chaos thanks to his &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20the%20Ivory%20King\"&gt;powerful soul&lt;/a&gt; as their &lt;a href=\"Burnt%20Ivory%20King\"&gt;Ivory King&lt;/a&gt;. The Ivory King was able to build his kindgom of &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Eleum%20Loyce\"&gt;Eleum Loyce&lt;/a&gt; and he governed it as a true and ever-merciful monarch , dedicating himself to protecting his land and being the first to swing his sword in times of need and its country continued to exist with the aim of containing the Chaos and the terrors it generated and its knights became the devoted guardians of the land, delving valiantly into the depths even if that meant never to return.\nAt some point, a group of surviving Lion Knights of Forossa mutated into humanoid lion creatures, becoming a new offshoot race that appeared in historical records quite abruptly. These bestial knights, known as the &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Clan%20Warrior\"&gt;Lion Clan Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, severed their ties with humans and aggressively kept on themselves, murdering anyone with the curious notion of approaching them, despising their own look and hating to be seen. Still firmly preserving the legacy of their warrior origins, these lion clansmen are capable craftsmen, wearing complex decorations on their armor and using &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Greataxe\"&gt;finely-crafted blades&lt;/a&gt; that cut smoothly, evidence that they were much more than vulgar beasts. In addition their &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Clan%20Shield\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; were decorated with a bizarre pattern that symbolized the mark of &lt;a href=\"Faraam%2C%20God%20of%20War\"&gt;Faraam&lt;/a&gt;, venerated as the god of war in Forossa. In fact among the lion clansmen there were mages, just as among the Forossan Knights the sages led the warriors into battle and venerated the god of war. After the collapse of &lt;a href=\"Vendrick\"&gt;Vendrick&lt;/a&gt;'s kingdom, a group of these lion warriors entered &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; and settled in the &lt;a href=\"Shaded%20Woods\"&gt;Shaded Woods&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the region and times of &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt;, Forossa was recognized as a kingdom that had been destroyed but legends about its Lion Knights and those among them that became part of history remained alive. \nDespite the collapse of the country, the survivors of Forossa, along with other groups originating from the region of Drangleic, contributed to founding the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt;. One of the &lt;a href=\"Faraam%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;armor sets&lt;/a&gt; that took their name from the ancient god of war worshiped by the Forossians was preserved and among the guard of the royal family of Lothric is present &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Knight%20Albert\"&gt;Lion Knight Albert&lt;/a&gt;, descendant of the order of knights of Forossa.\nAlthough their homeland has been lost to the point that it no longer identifies them, brigands of Forossa still continue to roam the world wielding their &lt;a href=\"Brigand%20Axe\"&gt;ancient war axes&lt;/a&gt;."}

Bark-like wooden membranes spread out chaotically from their heart, where their &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sign\"&gt;Dark Sign&lt;/a&gt; once stood, almost entirely covering their chest and left arm and spreading like branches. Several root-like horns extend from their heads and their spindly legs appear to be covered in bark. They all wield an &lt;a href=\"Four%20Kings%20Sword\"&gt;enormous but terribly distorted and segmented sword&lt;/a&gt;, similar to the roots of their body.\nLocation.\nThe Four Kings are found in the &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt;, accessed through &lt;a href=\"New%20Londo%20Ruins\"&gt;New Londo Ruins&lt;/a&gt;. The player must first acquire the &lt;a href=\"Key%20to%20the%20Seal\"&gt;Key to the Seal&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Ingward\"&gt;Ingward&lt;/a&gt; to drain the water from the ruins, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Covenant%20of%20Artorias\"&gt;Covenant of Artorias&lt;/a&gt;, a ring obtained from &lt;a href=\"Great%20Grey%20Wolf%20Sif\"&gt;Great Grey Wolf Sif&lt;/a&gt;, to safely enter their battle arena.\nLore.\nThe Four Kings were once the great leaders of a country of humans. During the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Age of Fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; recognized their abilities and foresight and rewarded them with a &lt;a href=\"Bequeathed%20Lord%20Soul%20Shard\"&gt;fragment of his powerful Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt; and the title of kings, using his power to bind and hold close to him the powerful humans. The god also allowed them to build their civilization of &lt;a href=\"New%20Londo%20Ruins\"&gt;New Londo&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; as a lower vassal of the city of the gods. Over time their city of humans grew to host countless lives, becoming a robust and flourishing culture. Although at some point the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; began to fade out, leading to the emergence of the Curse of Undeath, the city continued to exist and function as an Undead city, implying the good governance of the four kings who managed to adapt to the change.\nAfter Gwyn sacrificed himself to link the fading First Flame, the &lt;a href=\"Primordial%20Serpent\"&gt;Primordial Serpent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Darkstalker%20Kaathe\"&gt;Kaathe&lt;/a&gt; began searching for a human strong enough to become the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Lord\"&gt;Dark Lord&lt;/a&gt; capable of leading humans and usher in an &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Dark\"&gt;Age of Dark&lt;/a&gt;. At some point Kaathe arrived in New Londo and managed to seduce the Four Kings to follow his ideals, teaching them the art of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Hand\"&gt;Lifedrain&lt;/a&gt; so that they could preserve their humanity even while Undead and so cast off the &lt;a href=\"Darksign\"&gt;shackles&lt;/a&gt; placed upon them by the gods. But his dark influence did not stop with the kings and, in fact, their entire army followed them. The knights of New Londo became &lt;a href=\"Darkwraith%20%28enemy%29\"&gt;Darkwraith&lt;/a&gt;s, servants of the Dark who learned the art of Lifedrain and used it to absorb humanity. As the Four Kings' were able to open an &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt; in the center of their city, their very bodies were mutated by their freed Dark Soul, and the Darkwraiths' &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Set\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; transformed, too, as they began to employ the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Eye%20Orb\"&gt;Red Eye Orb&lt;/a&gt;s granted by Kaathe to seek humanity and plunge further into the powers of the Dark, \nA nation of humans freed from the shackles of the Darksign, and who not only began to understand the powers of their Dark Soul but had an entire army at their disposal that shared this power, represented an unparalleled threat to the gods of Anor Londo, who branded the Darkwraiths as diabolical enemies of man and of every living thing. For this reason, &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Artorias\"&gt;Artorias&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Knights%20of%20Gwyn\"&gt;Four Knights of Gwyn&lt;/a&gt;, was sent to fight the soldiers of New Londo and was given a &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Pendant\"&gt;Silver Pendant&lt;/a&gt; to deflect the Dark of the Abyss in its magical forms. However this did not prove sufficient to cross the Abyss of the Four Kings, and Artorias was forced to forge a covenant with the \"beasts of the Abyss\", obtaining a &lt;a href=\"Covenant%20of%20Artorias\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt; that would allow him to cross the Abyss, while also cursing his Greatsword. Artorias thus became known as the \"Abysswalker\", and hunted the Darkwraiths, but failed to eliminate the Four Kings and thus eliminate the Abyss of New Londo.\nHaving failed to eliminate the dark threat, an agonizing and terrible decision was made: flooding the entire land of New Londo despite the realization that countless lives and the rich culture of the country would be lost. For this task, sorcerers were called, and the feat was accomplished without even evacuating the city's civilians, sealing away the Four Kings, their Darkwraiths and the entire population with them. The victims were thus cursed, and became &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;s roaming the ruins of their country, seeking to make mincemeat of every living being. \nAlthough decades have passed since New Londo was reduced to rubble and submerged, the Four Kings remained alive in their Abyss, while the Darkwraiths continued to wait and patrol the area. When a &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt; was able to ring the &lt;a href=\"Bells%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Bells of Awakening&lt;/a&gt;, overcome the challenges of &lt;a href=\"Sen%27s%20Fortress\"&gt;Sen's Fortress&lt;/a&gt; and reach &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;, thus being rewarded with the &lt;a href=\"Lordvessel\"&gt;Lordvessel&lt;/a&gt;, they would be guided by &lt;a href=\"Kingseeker%20Frampt\"&gt;Kingseeker Frampt&lt;/a&gt; to find immense souls to fill the receptacle and link the fading &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; to succeed Gwyn in his sacrifice. The Undead would thus have proved their strength to &lt;a href=\"Ingward\"&gt;Ingward&lt;/a&gt; to open the floodgates of the city and find a way to traverse the Abyss until they reached the Four Kings, challenging and killing them to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Bequeathed%20Lord%20Soul%20Shard\"&gt;fragment of a Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt; which they still possessed.\nSummoning.\nSummon signs are most commonly found at the beginning of the New Londo Ruins, before crossing the bridges. Some can also be found right before the boss door.\n&lt;a href=\"Witch%20Beatrice\"&gt;Witch Beatrice's&lt;/a&gt; summon sign can be found hidden around a corner just before crossing the short bridge to the &lt;a href=\"Fog%20Door\"&gt;Fog Door&lt;/a&gt;, but only if you have already summoned her for the Moonlight Butterfly fight. It may prove more than useful if you are a light build.\nBoss information.\nAttacks.\nDouble Horizontal Slash.\nTwo wide sweeping slashes with the King's sword. May occasionally stop after one attack. These have excellent tracking and are quite damaging to health should a critical hit land. Stamina is largely drained when blocking both consecutively. They can be rolled under, and can be sidestepped away from without taking damage.\nVertical Slash.\nPowerful vertical slash. Does not track, however, blocking is not recommended, as massive damage to the stamina bar is guaranteed.\nForward Thrust.\nSingle powerful straight thrust with the Four King's Sword. It has the longest reach of all melee attacks and deals massive damage when absorbed head on. This attack is only triggered when the player is at a distance and cannot be strafed; although it has poor tracking and can be dodged.\nDouble Slash.\nTwo diagonal slashes with the Sword; may take a fair amount of stamina to block. May stop after one attack.\nWrath of the Kings.\nExtremely powerful, large\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;area-of-effect&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0attack in which the King will spin around, covering himself with his left \"wing\" and emanate a purple aura. Blocking is most successful when using a high stability shield with good magic reduction. Otherwise, players should release their lock and run away when the King begins his attack.\u00a0\nHoming Arrow Mass.\nThe King will fire off six energy shots that home in on the player. These are much quicker than Homing Abyss Arrow, but they also have much weaker homing capabilities, allowing the player to easily roll or move away when they approach. Getting hit by multiple shots will deal immense damage.\nHoming Abyss Arrow.\nThe King will fire off a slow moving, large, purple projectile that has high tracking capability and powerful magic damage. It cannot be evaded and may only be blocked by a high stability shield with high magic resistance; which will likely drain the entire stamina bar, but may also reduce the damage. The only way to avoid this attack is to outrun it until the projectile disappears. A new king might spawn within that time period.\nLife Drain.\nThis is a &lt;a href=\"Humanity%20Mechanic\"&gt;Humanity&lt;/a&gt; stealing &lt;a href=\"grab\"&gt;grab&lt;/a&gt; attack, and, like all grab attacks, it is unblockable. Its animation is similar to Wrath of the Kings: the King will spin around and pause, holding its wing/arm in preparation while emanating a colorless aura. If the player is slow to react, his forward grabbing dash will be inescapable. Counter-intuitively, it can be avoided by moving \"closer\" to the attacking king before they begin their lunge. In extreme proximity the attack will simply go over the player's head. Unlike other grab attacks, the King can still be damaged by aiding &lt;a href=\"phantom\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt;s as a player is drained; however, this will only deal damage to the Four Kings' collective health bar rather than the individual King.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls \u2014 Four Kings by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpQVhkOq1gU&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}
