However, the set can be purchased before entering NG+ through use of two &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20Ascetic\"&gt;Bonfire Ascetic&lt;/a&gt;s. The set costs 45,000 souls in total.\nCharacteristics.\nThe Moon Butterfly Set is unique in that its the only set of armor that emit a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; aura, which causes poison &lt;a href=\"buildup\"&gt;buildup&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Enemies%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; and NPCs when they are close by. The Poison buildup is not constant, rather it emits Poison in waves every few seconds. Each armor piece has its own Poison buildup value, thus wearing multiple pieces will increase the strength of the Poison buildup.\nIn addition to the poison aura, the wings and skirt will both increase jumping distance and reduce &lt;a href=\"falling%20damage\"&gt;falling damage&lt;/a&gt;, and can be paired with the &lt;a href=\"Silvercat%20Ring\"&gt;Silvercat Ring&lt;/a&gt;. It also allows the player to jump without sprinting. \nIt should be noted that virtually any mob that is susceptible to poison, including friendly NPCs, will gain poison build-up while any piece of this set is worn. This can cause them to become hostile after a period of time, and removing the armor as a precaution is advised when approaching &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt; and the like.\nUpgrades.\nUpgrades with &lt;a href=\"Twinkling%20Titanite%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Twinkling Titanite&lt;/a&gt;."}

It can be more easily acquired by burning &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20Ascetic\"&gt;Bonfire Ascetic&lt;/a&gt;s on the bonfire of &lt;a href=\"Majula\"&gt;Majula&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacteristics.\nContrary to its accompanying &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Butterfly%20Set\"&gt;set&lt;/a&gt;, this shield will not cause any poison buildup to enemies, as such, it is completely safe use around NPC's. Another difference that sets it apart from that set is the fact that it is upgradeable by regular &lt;a href=\"Titanite%20Shard%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Titanite&lt;/a&gt;, as opposed to the &lt;a href=\"Twinkling%20Titanite%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Twinkling Titanite&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis shield is indeed a very odd, yet, interestingly useful addition to any player. As its text says, this is not a shield made for defense, but rather for attacking enemies using its &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; buildup damage, it is so powerful in fact that it can poison foes with little armor, within 3 hits as such, this is more than likely the most poison damaging source in the game (excluding spells), ironically. Its effectiveness, however, is cut short by an extreme margin as the hitbox of the shield is very little, and if the enemy slightly moves to the side, it will most likely not register a hit. It requires an extreme amount of skill to use effectively.\nApart from extremely high poison resistance, its stats are more than likely the worst stats of any shield in-game, therefore, the only thing that this shield should be used to defend is the thrown bile of the poisonous statues in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Gulch\"&gt;Black Gulch&lt;/a&gt;. As such it is strongly recommended to infuse it with poison as it will greatly increase the poison damage, and it will reach 100% poison resistance while blocking. "}

However, this does not change the fact that the physical scaling should be ignored, outside of meeting the minimum wielding requirements, in favor of leveling &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, as the Moonlight Greatsword has been traditionally built (though as is the case with most melee weapons, it only scales effectively up to 40 in the offensive stats). The physical damage component is useful when performing &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;criticals&lt;/a&gt;, as both damage types are magnified during the attack, allowing it to more easily punch through foes' flat Defenses.\nThe Moonlight Greatsword uses the same &lt;a href=\"Moveset%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;moveset&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Greatsword%20of%20Judgment\"&gt;Greatsword of Judgment&lt;/a&gt;, utilizing horizontal and vertical slashes. However, it also has one of the longest reaches among greatswords, being beat only by the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Knight%27s%20Greatsword\"&gt;Wolf Knight's Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Onyx%20Blade\"&gt;Onyx Blade&lt;/a&gt;. Its skill, &lt;a href=\"Moonlight%20Vortex\"&gt;Moonlight Vortex&lt;/a&gt;, charges the weapon for a powerful thrust attack that channels moonlight energy into a spear-like close-range attack to further augment its lethality. As such, this weapon is best utilized if the wielder equips heavy armor in order to utilize &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;, as is the case with all greatswords in the game.\nFully charging either the one- or two-handed strong attacks will unleash a wave of moonlight energy, at the cost of 4 &lt;a href=\"Durability\"&gt;Durability&lt;/a&gt; per use. The moonlight waves inflict only Magic damage; however, hitting an enemy with both the blade and the moonlight wave at close range will result in not only physical damage but also heavy Magic damage being dealt.\nDescription.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Official translation=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

After a brief period, the blade is thrust forward, unleashing a vortex of moonlight energy and inflicting heavy &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; damage to anything in front of the player, as well as &lt;a href=\"Physical%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;physical damage&lt;/a&gt; with the sword. The attack consists of two hitboxes, the vortex and the sword, and being hit by one but not the other will result in less damage being inflicted.\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nThis attack is a very good way to inflict powerful burst Magic damage at the cost of &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt; rather than durability. While it has moderate startup, it can inflict strong stagger upon any enemies hit.\nOnline gameplay.\nWhile the startup does allow it to be interrupted by quick opponents, this skill boasts an impressive 35 &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; health, meaning that it is very difficult or outright impossible to interrupt by anything smaller than an &lt;a href=\"Ultra%20Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;ultra greatsword&lt;/a&gt; once &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt; is active. This makes it a very powerful skill for trading against opponents with weapons of equal or smaller size, as well as for winning or breaking even against larger weapons with moderate amounts of Poise.\nAs well, the skill can be free-aimed at any point during the charge, allowing the wielder to catch opponents who attempt to roll out of the way or get behind the wielder for a backstab."}

However, it also has innate &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt; buildup, which means that it can also benefit from leveling &lt;a href=\"Luck\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, the weapon's primary trait is that when the wielder's &lt;a href=\"Hit%20Points%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; is at 20% or lower, all damage dealt by the wielder increases by 20%. As this is not limited to damage inflicted by the weapon itself, the Morion Blade can be used as a utility tool of sorts, wielding the weapon while inflicting damage with a weapon in the other hand, such as a &lt;a href=\"Crossbows%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt; or a spell catalyst. This can be particularly effective when combined with the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Tearstone%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Red Tearstone Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpgrades.\n&lt;br&gt;\nTrivia.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

Though this Strength requirement is matched by that of &lt;a href=\"Moaning%20Shield\"&gt;its matching greatshield&lt;/a&gt;, it can be somewhat circumvented by reaching only 34 Strength and two-handing the weapon. As well, it is one of the heaviest weapons in the game, matching weight with &lt;a href=\"Smough%27s%20Gauntlets%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Smough's Great Hammer&lt;/a&gt; and only being beaten by the &lt;a href=\"Fume%20Ultra%20Greatsword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fume Ultra Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ledo%27s%20Great%20Hammer\"&gt;Ledo's Great Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, which forces the wielder to both level &lt;a href=\"Vitality%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt; and equip one of the variants of &lt;a href=\"Havel%27s%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Havel's Ring&lt;/a&gt;. As such, this weapon essentially demands that the player allocate levels around the weapon, rather than the inverse.\nHowever, should these wielding requirements be met, Morne's Great Hammer becomes a force of destruction unlike almost anything else. With an intolerably high Attack Rating, it will lay waste to almost any target that it hits, moreso since it deals Strike damage, which is one of the least-resisted damage types in the game. As well, like Smough's Great Hammer and Ledo's Great Hammer, it has the &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; health of an Ultra Great Hammer, higher than that of a standard Great Hammer, which grants it extremely powerful &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt;. Added to all of this is its &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;, an enhanced variant of &lt;a href=\"Perseverance%20%28skill%29\"&gt;Perseverance&lt;/a&gt; which further augments its ability to put out damage."}

The Shrine Handmaid will also sell it should the player kill Eygon.\nCharacteristics.\nOn the higher end of heavy armor sets, Morne's Set is surprisingly well-balanced across the board save for some unusual weaknesses.\nThe set boasts strong physical defenses, save for the traditional weakness to &lt;a href=\"Strike%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Strike&lt;/a&gt; damage; however, even in this case the weakness is less significant than in most plate armor sets. Its elemental defenses are also very strong, and due to its mineral composition it is actually insulated quite well against &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage. However, this comes at the cost of a severe vulnerability to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt;. It is also unusually weak to &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; buildup, though its resistances against other &lt;a href=\"Negative%20Status%20Effects%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;status effects&lt;/a&gt; is about average.\nTo back up its heavy weight, Morne's Set provides very strong &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;, allowing it to win most any trade provided that its wearer is wielding an &lt;a href=\"Ultra%20Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Ultra Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; or larger."}

The Greatwood may be defeated at no penalty once the covenant is joined.\nIf the Greatwood has already been defeated, the covenant will become available again by following an NPC questline that can only be fully completed after defeating two of the four &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lords of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;.\nHow to join.\nThe Mound-makers can be joined in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Undead Settlement&lt;/a&gt;. By navigating to a hidden area patrolled by numerous &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;s, the player can discover a non-hostile &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Manservant\"&gt;Hollow Manservant&lt;/a&gt; carrying an empty cage on its back. By examining the hollow, the player will enter the cage and be transported to the &lt;a href=\"Pit%20of%20Hollows\"&gt;Pit of Hollows&lt;/a&gt;, below the &lt;a href=\"Curse-rotted%20Greatwood\"&gt;Curse-rotted Greatwood&lt;/a&gt;'s boss arena. This Manservant will be hostile if the Greatwood has been confronted or defeated, and thus cannot be interacted with.\nOnce there, the player must talk to &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Knight%20Hodrick\"&gt;Holy Knight Hodrick&lt;/a&gt;, who stands next to the covenant's Sacrificial Altar and who will give them the &lt;a href=\"Mound-makers%20%28item%29\"&gt;Mound-makers covenant item&lt;/a&gt;. If talked to again, he will give the player a &lt;a href=\"Homeward%20Bone%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Homeward Bone&lt;/a&gt;, which is required to leave the area without using the &lt;a href=\"Darksign%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Darksign&lt;/a&gt; or committing suicide.\nIf the player has reached the second phase of the Curse-rotted Greatwood, killing Hodrick in the process, the only other way to join the covenant is to follow &lt;a href=\"Sirris%20of%20the%20Sunless%20Realms\"&gt;Sirris of the Sunless Realms&lt;/a&gt;' questline. Once Hodrick is defeated in Sirris's world, the covenant item will be rewarded.\nLore.\nThe covenant was formed by the original Mound-maker, when they discovered a &lt;a href=\"Vertebra%20Shackle\"&gt;Vertebra Shackle&lt;/a&gt; in one of their victims, which they believed was a vertebra put in humans by the Gods that grants them sentience and sanity. They then started collecting Vertebra Shackles with their sword &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; to offer to their sacrificial altar in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Pit of Hollows&lt;/a&gt; with the objective of preventing their sanity from slipping. All the while, they would create mounds out of the bodies of their Hollowed victims, which would become their \"family\" once they turned Hollow themselves. Eventually, the original Mound-maker sacrificed themselves as an offering and left their sword for the covenant.\nAt some point, the Mound-makers created the pyromancy Warmth to relieve their fear of being separated from the Gods and losing their sanity.\nBenefits.\nWhen the covenant item is equipped, the player will take on the appearance of a Mad Phantom, and their summon sign and aura will take on a purple color. As a Mad Phantom, the player may invade or be summoned into a world, where they will be considered hostile by all other factions; if summoned via a &lt;a href=\"White%20Sign%20Soapstone%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;White Sign Soapstone&lt;/a&gt;, basic enemies in the host's world will react to the player's presence.\nIn order to successfully complete an online session, the player must defeat either the &lt;a href=\"Host%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Host of Embers&lt;/a&gt;, or a certain number of phantoms of any affiliation. Depending on the number of players already present in the host's world upon entering it, the requirement may increase to up to 3 phantoms. Therefore, unlike red invaders or blue territory defenders who must defeat the Host of Embers in order to achieve victory, a purple phantom may choose to slay phantoms allied with the host, or invaders who are attempting to defeat the host, and achieve their objective regardless. Conversely, however, the player must land the killing blow on a target to qualify, killing a target via secondary methods such as knocking them off of a cliff does not count.\nSuccessfully completing an online session will reward the player with a &lt;a href=\"Vertebra%20Shackle\"&gt;Vertebra Shackle&lt;/a&gt;, which can be offered to the altar in the Pit of Hollows to rank up within the covenant. The method of entering the host's world has no effect on what the Mound-maker must do to complete the session.\nFurther rewards are granted upon leveling up:"}

The riders are unable to attack themselves so they rely on their mounts to defend against threats.\nMounted Overseers are only encountered in &lt;a href=\"Harvest%20Valley\"&gt;Harvest Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nMounted Overseers\u00a0look intimidating but they are relatively simple enemies\u00a0to handle. Their most dangerous\u00a0attack is to hurl an orb\u00a0of dark energy at the player that\u00a0deals a large amount of damage, even if blocked. However the projectile travels slowly and it can be easily avoided by moving behind the beast. Another good idea is to maintain higher ground and use ranged attacks as they cannot aim their dark orb projectiles vertically, keeping the player safe while putting them at a major advantage. \nAt close range, the overseer's mount will attempt to crush the player with powerful melee blows. It can often chain several attacks together in one strike which will quickly deplete the player's stamina. It is advisable to move away from the creature and counterattack whilst it is recovering.\nMounted Overseers are often encountered in poison-filled areas so close combat is not advised unless the player has a strong poison resistance. It is safer to dispatch them from a safe distance with ranged weapons.\nShooting the Overseer itself does the same amount of damage as it does to its Mount.\nAttacks.\nTheir most commonly used attack is to hurl a giant orb of darkness, akin to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Orb%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dark Orb&lt;/a&gt; the player can cast, which deals a large amount of damage. However, as intimidating this attack may look, it has a large windup to it and travels slowly with no tracking so dodging is advised instead of blocking. \nThe other attack is used when the player is in front and in close proximity of the beast it will swipe with its arm which may be chained for several hits. This attack just like the orb of darkness can easily be avoided by dodging to the side of the creature and move behind it for some easy hits while it recovers."}

In the back room of the building, a corpse will be holding the staff.\nCharacteristics.\nA &lt;a href=\"Catalysts%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;catalyst&lt;/a&gt; that specializes in casting &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Sorceries&lt;/a&gt;, the Murky Longstaff differentiates itself from its &lt;a href=\"Izalith%20Staff\"&gt;Izalith cousin&lt;/a&gt; by specializing solely in &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike the Izalith Staff, which benefits from leveling both Intelligence and &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt;, the Murky Longstaff has poor &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt; in the latter stat, meaning that it can reach its full potential without having to invest a large number of levels into Faith. As well, the staff's &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Buff\"&gt;Spell Buff&lt;/a&gt; soft-caps at 45 Intelligence, which allows its wielder to achieve peak effectiveness without having to go all the way up to 60 Intelligence.\nLike the Izalith Staff, the Murky Longstaff gains a power boost when casting Dark Sorceries like &lt;a href=\"Great%20Deep%20Soul\"&gt;Great Deep Soul&lt;/a&gt;, which increase in strength by approximately 20%. However, as the bulk of the staff's Spell Buff comes from Intelligence, this means that it can also cast standard Sorceries like &lt;a href=\"Great%20Heavy%20Soul%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Great Heavy Soul Arrow&lt;/a&gt; to great effect.\nThe Murky Longstaff's various shortcomings are also its greatest strengths. For casting purely Sorceries, it is outclassed by the &lt;a href=\"Court%20Sorcerer%27s%20Staff\"&gt;Court Sorcerer's Staff&lt;/a&gt; at 60 Intelligence, even with the 20% boost to Dark Sorceries, and all Sorceries cast from other staves can benefit from the boost from &lt;a href=\"Steady%20Chant\"&gt;Steady Chant&lt;/a&gt;, whereas &lt;a href=\"Chant%20from%20the%20Depths\"&gt;Chant from the Depths&lt;/a&gt; only strengthens Dark Sorceries. As well, when compared to the Izalith Staff, Dark Sorceries cast by the Murky Longstaff are weaker if comparing both staves at their soft caps. However, because the Murky Longstaff only needs 45 Intelligence and no Faith to be effective, it does not require nearly as much level investment as the Izalith Staff, and the same can be said when compared to the Court Sorcerer's Staff; in both cases, a great number of levels can instead be invested into areas such as &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Vigor%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Vigor&lt;/a&gt;, or the staff can be used effectively on medium-level builds rather than only being strong at very high levels. And finally, unlike the Izalith Staff, which performs very poorly when casting standard Sorceries, the Murky Longstaff can still be very potent when casting standard Sorceries, giving it a degree of flexibility that the former does not possess.\nUpgrades.\nReinforced with &lt;a href=\"Upgrade%20Materials%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Titanite&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

Although the Bent Blade has an innate &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; effect, it is superseded by many other non-upgraded weapons &lt;a href=\"infuse\"&gt;infuse&lt;/a&gt;d down the Poison path, even when fully upgraded. It also only has 40 &lt;a href=\"Durability\"&gt;Durability&lt;/a&gt;, so it may be prudent to keep some &lt;a href=\"Repair%20Powder%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Repair Powder&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Bracing%20Knuckle%20Ring\"&gt;Bracing Knuckle Ring&lt;/a&gt; or a spare weapon in case it breaks. \nMytha's Bent Blade has the distinction of being one of the only two weapons in the game able to inflict the &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Toxic&lt;/a&gt; status, which does significantly higher damage than poison with the trade off of having fewer means to build up the status.

Unfortunately, he had no affection for her in spite of her beauty and fell in love with another. The knowledge of this drove her mad, causing her to start consuming poisonous substances that would supposedly increase her beauty. Instead, the substances only corrupted her and transformed her into a monster. Subsequently, she was exiled to &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Peak\"&gt;Earthen Peak&lt;/a&gt;. Using the Manikins as servants, Mytha converted her prison castle into a giant machine which pumps more poison into her personal chambers, since, in her monstrous form, it keeps her young and immortal.\nA man that is believed to have loved her followed alongside. However, as she was oblivious to the affections of any other man that was not the king, his feelings were ignored. That man is said to have transformed into the monster known as the &lt;a href=\"Covetous%20Demon\"&gt;Covetous Demon&lt;/a&gt;.\nSummoning.\n&lt;a href=\"Jester%20Thomas\"&gt;Jester Thomas&lt;/a&gt; can be summoned from a sign just to the right of two &lt;a href=\"Grave%20Warden\"&gt;Grave Warden&lt;/a&gt;s outside the corridor to Mytha's fog gate. He is a ranged ally, dual-wielding two &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20Flame%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;pyromancy flames&lt;/a&gt;. His powerful fireballs can often cause Mytha to focus completely on him, leaving her defenseless against attacks from behind. He can defeat her all by himself.\nIn , two additional summons are available: &lt;a href=\"Devotee%20Scarlett\"&gt;Devotee Scarlett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bashful%20Ray\"&gt;Bashful Ray&lt;/a&gt;, below and above &lt;a href=\"Central%20Earthen%20Peak\"&gt;Central Earthen Peak&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.\nStrategy.\nThe main threat in this battle is not the Queen herself, but the &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;poisonous&lt;/a&gt; pool in the room in which she is fought. This poison will drain the player's health at a dangerous rate and slowly heal Mytha throughout the fight. However, this can be averted; burning the windmill opposite the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Earthen%20Peak\"&gt;Central Earthen Peak&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt; will reduce the pool to being only around the sides of the arena.\nWith the poison no longer a threat, this boss can still be difficult. Her moveset mostly comprises spear attacks or using her head to shoot bolts of &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. Her attacks are quick and cover a lot of room, so light armor is best for this battle. The player can cut off her tail to reduce the range of her \"Tail Swipe\", and prevent her from using her \"Tail Grip\" attack, but the player gains no items from doing this.\nOn the offensive, this fight is not as hard as it may seem. The player just needs to take their time and watch her attack patterns, which can all be dodged easily if under 60% carry weight. Depending on her attack, she may be left wide open to one or two strikes. She also appears to be weak against &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, so &lt;a href=\"Charcoal%20Pine%20Resin%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Charcoal Pine Resins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Firebomb%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Firebombs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;pyromancies&lt;/a&gt; can all help, although they are not really necessary if the player is careful.\nTime between attacks can also be used to quickly use a &lt;a href=\"Lifegem\"&gt;Lifegem&lt;/a&gt; or two after your health starts getting toward the halfway mark. As long as the player takes their time, watches her attacks, and can move quickly enough, this boss fight will be reasonably easy to moderate even on &lt;a href=\"New%20Game%20Plus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;NG+&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttacks.\nSpear Slam: The Queen stabs twice with her spear and sometimes ends with a downward strike. Has good tracking, so be sure to dodge at the right moment.\nLunging Thrust:\u00a0The Queen rushes quickly forward with her spear and stabs. This attack has long range and is carried out quickly.\nTail Grip:\u00a0The Queen reaches out with her tail to grab the player and crushes them dealing high damage.\nTail Swipe:\u00a0Done when the player is behind her, she swipes her tail to the left. Quite difficult to dodge.\nSerpent Spin:\u00a0The Queen lifts up her spear and quickly spins around three times.\nArrow Spread Shot:\u00a0The Queen raises her severed head and shoots out multiple bolts of magic with a scream, that fan out horizontally.\nRetreating Swipe:\u00a0Mytha slashes horizontally with her spear while leaping backward.\nHead Bomb:\u00a0Mytha throws her severed head in front of her and it explodes after a short delay. Be sure to dodge the attack as it can do very high damage.\nDefenses.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense. -20% thrust means taking 120% damage.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 Mytha, the Baneful Queen by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFe5adakvVE&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

She came to Brume Tower in search of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Iron%20King\"&gt;Old Iron King&lt;/a&gt;, either out of genuine affection or to simply force his kingdom to crumble. But when she arrived, she found that the king had been slain, and his kingdom left in shambles.\nFalling into despair, Nadalia split her soul apart and stored those fragments within various &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Idol\"&gt;ashen idols&lt;/a&gt; throughout the hollowed and empty Brume Tower. Upon doing this, she erected a black fog that consumed the tower and brought back the deceased soldiers and warriors, bewitching them into defending her. Many knights of outside lands came to the tower to steal the stores of iron within Brume Tower, but Nadalia's idols both bewitched the ones who were willing to serve her, and destroyed the ones who would attempt to defy her.\nSometime after his defeat at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Velstadt%2C%20The%20Royal%20Aegis\"&gt;Velstadt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fume%20Knight\"&gt;Sir Raime&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; came to Brume Tower in search of greater power, and eventually came to view Nadalia as a mother figure. Rather than purge the black fog, Raime instead chose to live alongside the fog, and became Nadalia's loyal guardian.\nHer original body can presumably be found at the bottom of the tower past Raime, clutching the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20the%20Old%20Iron%20King%20%28helm%29\"&gt;Crown of the Old Iron King&lt;/a&gt; and sitting upon his throne.\nStrategy.\nNadalia is not a boss as the previous two Queens were; rather, she is more akin to an obstacle that is found throughout the \"&lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20the%20Old%20Iron%20King\"&gt;Crown of the Old Iron King&lt;/a&gt;\". The only way to destroy these idols is to impale them with the &lt;a href=\"Smelter%20Wedge\"&gt;Smelter Wedge&lt;/a&gt;s that the player finds throughout the tower."}

This allows players to more easily connect with specific players, a mechanic that wasn't implemented in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\".\nUpon equipping the ring, the player will be given a choice between ten different gods. Once a god is chosen, the player will be able to easily connect with other players who have chosen the same god. This makes summoning friends much easier as it's a sort of \"private summoning\". It can also be used to summon black phantoms via &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sign%20Soapstone%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Red Sign Soapstone&lt;/a&gt;. Once summoned, the player can remove this ring without any harmful side effects.\nAs in normal co-operative play, &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Memory\"&gt;Soul Memory&lt;/a&gt; is the determining factor for whom players can and cannot summon. In addition to narrowing the pool of players who the player may summon for co-op, the Name-engraved Ring increases the effective Soul Memory range used to do so. For more information on summoning players and the effects of the Name-engraved Ring on Soul Memory, see &lt;a href=\"Cooperative%20Gameplay%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Cooperative Gameplay (Dark Souls II)&lt;/a&gt;.\nBe aware that summoning signs of NPCs will vanish until the ring is taken off (experienced in SotfS).\nThe ring also extends the multiplayer time limit by 50%.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Small%20White%20Sign%20Soapstone\"&gt;Small White Sign Soapstone&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s coop session will last 750 seconds (12 minutes, 30 seconds), instead of 500, and the &lt;a href=\"White%20Sign%20Soapstone\"&gt;White Sign Soapstone&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s coop session will last 6000 seconds (1 hour, 40 minutes), instead of 4000.

In the deep swamp zone, the set can be found inside a crevice where the wall ends and an impassable cliff begins.\nCharacteristics.\nReturning from the previous \"Dark Souls\" games, the Nameless Knight Set can be seen as a lighter alternative to \"Dark Souls III\" &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Knight Set&lt;/a&gt;, and as such, will not be nearly as robust as the set itself.\nAlthough it is not as protective as the higher-end medium armor sets, it has a rather manageable &lt;a href=\"weight\"&gt;weight&lt;/a&gt; for its class, while providing a solid defense overall. Like other plate armor sets it is weak to &lt;a href=\"Strike%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Strike&lt;/a&gt; damage, but it is quite resilient to &lt;a href=\"Slash%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Slash&lt;/a&gt; damage.\nWhile it provides moderate resistance to elemental damage, the Nameless Knight Set is unusual in that it is more resilient to &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; than average, and provides good resistance to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage to boot. It boasts a very impressive resistance to &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt;, as well. However, its &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; is somewhat lacking, as the price for its light weight."}

The &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Ring\"&gt;King's Ring&lt;/a&gt; is also required to open the King's Gate that leads to Nashandra.\nDescription.\nA tall humanoid creature wielding a long scythe in her right hand. Her left hand emanates a purple light that can become an energy beam or cause an explosion when she puts it near her chest. Her legs are covered by a skirt made of a black goo filled with bones. She can also summon four black fountains that &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;curse&lt;/a&gt; those who stand near them. She can speak and can change into a more &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;, yet still gigantic, form.\nLore.\nNashandra began her life as a small fragment of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Manus%2C%20Father%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Manus, Father of the Abyss&lt;/a&gt;. When Manus was defeated, he was reborn as many fragments varying in sizes. Nashandra was the incarnation of her \"father's\" want, and thus began desiring what she did not have: power. \nNashandra traveled to the land of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt;, and set her sights on its powerful ruler, King &lt;a href=\"Vendrick\"&gt;Vendrick&lt;/a&gt;. Deciding to seduce Vendrick, Nashandra assumed a human form of unparalleled beauty and warned him of a supposed looming threat beyond the sea: the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Giants&lt;/a&gt;. She convinced him to invade the land of the giants to claim their power, which Vendrick did successfully. Vendrick then made Nashandra his queen, and under their leadership,\u00a0Drangleic entered into a &lt;a href=\"The%20Dark\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt;-like peace. The rulership of Drangleic however, was not enough to quell Nashandra\u2019s want, and she desired an even greater power: the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, which she intended to claim for herself by using Vendrick and the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Want\"&gt;Throne of Want&lt;/a&gt;. \nWhen Drangleic was ravaged by the second war with the giants and the spread of the &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead Curse&lt;/a&gt;, Vendrick came to realize the true nature and identity of Nashandra, and what she had coveted all along. Knowing that his time was short and that his queen had to be stopped, Vendrick created several impasses that would prevent Nashandra from seizing the throne, and sealed himself away in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Crypt\"&gt;Undead Crypt&lt;/a&gt;. This left Nashandra the sole ruler of Drangleic, albeit without much left to rule at all, as the kingdom had been all but destroyed.\nLeft without a king and with no means to claim the Throne of Want, Nashandra\u2019s plans were stalled until the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Bearer%20of%20the%20Curse\"&gt;Bearer of the Curse&lt;/a&gt;, an undead powerful enough to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ones\"&gt;Four Old Ones&lt;/a&gt; and gain access to &lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Castle\"&gt;Drangleic Castle&lt;/a&gt;. Nashandra manipulated the Bearer of the Curse into opening the way to the Throne of Want by aiding them in seizing the Throne of Want. She directs the Bearer of the Curse toward the Undead Crypt, suggesting that they put an end to the now-&lt;a href=\"hollow\"&gt;hollowed&lt;/a&gt; King Vendrick and claim his ring. She then directs the Bearer of the Curse to journey to &lt;a href=\"Aldia%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Aldia's Keep&lt;/a&gt; to acquire the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Mist%20Heart\"&gt;Ashen Mist Heart&lt;/a&gt;, and warns them that the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Dragon\"&gt;Ancient Dragon&lt;/a&gt; there is no more than a prop and a false &lt;a href=\"deity\"&gt;deity&lt;/a&gt;. At last, she directs the Bearer of the Curse toward the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20of%20Fallen%20Giants\"&gt;Forest of Fallen Giants&lt;/a&gt; to visit the memories of the Giants and obtain the last key to the Throne: the &lt;a href=\"Giant%27s%20Kinship\"&gt;Giant's Kinship&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the Bearer of the Curse has finally cleared the way to the Throne and acquired the means to access it, Nashandra will intercept them and reveal her true form. She then declares the Bearer of the Curse worthy to assume her intended role for Vendrick, to have their power usurped by her so she can claim the throne for herself.\nThe Bearer of the Curse has grown too strong however, and Nashandra falls at their hand. \nStrategy.\nNashandra specializes in dark magic and will immediately summon four &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt;-inducing \"fountains\" once the battle starts. She has two methods of attack in addition to inflicting Curse on your character and eating away at their health:\nScythe: She will swing her scythe sideways one, two, or three times (the third having a slightly longer windup and dealing heavy &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; damage on block), or do an overhead swing with a long recovery time.\u00a0Her scythe swings can easily &lt;a href=\"stagger\"&gt;stagger&lt;/a&gt; characters with low &lt;a href=\"adaptability\"&gt;adaptability&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Rolling\"&gt;Rolling&lt;/a&gt; diagonally backwards is the most effective way at dodging both of these attacks when close to her.\nDark Magic: She will either fire a beam that starts on the floor close to her and emits outward from the floor vertically, which can easily be avoided by strafing, or execute a small area of effect attack similar to &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Gods%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Wrath of the Gods&lt;/a&gt;. If she begins casting and her body is \"not\" being covered in dark energy, then she will use the beam; otherwise, it is the &lt;a href=\"area-of-effect\"&gt;area-of-effect&lt;/a&gt; attack and you must back away. If you look closely, you will also notice that her hand movement is different for each attack (she draws her hand close to her chest when using Wrath of the Gods). She also has another type of beam which sweeps horizontally, so be aware of the direction of the beams as these beams are usually fatal when combined with the health drain.\nAll of her attacks inflict Curse Build-up.\nFor melee characters it is also possible to equip light armor and dodge her attacks, ignoring the Curse &lt;a href=\"buildup\"&gt;buildup&lt;/a&gt; and only healing when your health starts draining. Also a good method for melee users is to wait at a distance for her to come towards the player, baiting her away from the four curse fountains. The curse fountains can be broken, stopping the curse buildup and health drain.\n&lt;a href=\"Phantom%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Summoning help&lt;/a&gt; will make the fight easier, even if it's only the two characters &lt;a href=\"Vengarl%20of%20Forossa\"&gt;Vengarl of Forossa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Benhart%20of%20Jugo\"&gt;Benhart of Jugo&lt;/a&gt;, as they will draw attention, leaving you with a good amount of room to deal damage and heal as needed.\nAn effective strategy if one has pyromancies is to stay far away until she fires her vertical \"laser\", then simply lobbing flame attacks at her.\nDefenses.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense. -10% strike means taking 110% damage.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 Nashandra by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdGYOnfO2OY&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

The wielder possesses 35 &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; health during the swipe, and it inflicts 1.2 times the weapon's Attack Rating as damage. If the arc connects with the head of the enemy, it will inflict a headshot, dealing increased damage.\nThis skill requires 13 &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt; to perform (10 &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Ring\"&gt;Farron Ring&lt;/a&gt; is equipped).\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nIn order to increase the chances of inflicting a headshot, the scythe must be manually aimed, and as such not locking on to the target is ideal. The target does not need to be within the sweet spot of the weapon's arc, and as such it is possible to headshot foes that are within point-blank range.\nOnline gameplay.\nNeck Swipe is the only attack of the weapon that possesses &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt;, so it can be situationally useful. Landing a headshot is much more difficult against a thinking opponent who can predict the timing of the swipe and roll through it, so it can be an unreliable skill. However, it is worth noting that scoring a headshot will result in increased stagger on the target on top of the higher damage, and can even knock foes out of &lt;a href=\"Perseverance%20%28skill%29\"&gt;Perseverance&lt;/a&gt;."}

When threatened, they will attack with a flame projectile.\nWorth noting is that the Necromancer's resurrection range is not necessarily dependant on proximity; rather, the group of skeletons that each Necromancer administers to appears to be manually assigned. If an affected skeleton pursues the player far into a zone with no Necromancer present, the affected skeleton will still resurrect continuously, whereas any other skeletons from this new zone will not.\nStrategy.\nNecromancers are relatively fragile in melee combat, so if they are rushed, they can be killed in a few hits.\nAlternatively, some of them can be sniped with a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"headshot\"&gt;headshot&lt;/a&gt;s dealing &lt;a href=\"critical\"&gt;critical&lt;/a&gt; damage), rendering his minions easier to deal with.

Similarly to their \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\" variant, Necromancers are able to resurrect nearby &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Skeletons&lt;/a&gt; to attack the player. They can also cast two different sorceries at the player.\nStrategy.\nNecromancers are fairly fragile in melee combat, meaning that rushing them before they can resurrect their skeleton allies is a useful strategy. However, the Necromancers in the Huntsman's Copse are often placed in dark caverns with fissures preventing a direct sprint towards them, or near &lt;a href=\"Curse%20Jar\"&gt;Curse Jar&lt;/a&gt;s, making the task of killing them slightly harder. Once killed, though, the Necromancers do not respawn.\nAttacks.\nOne of their attacks are shooting dark orbs that travel at a slow velocity at the player."}

When the bar fills, the effect triggers, and the bar empties at a rate dependent on the individual effect, usually ignoring any further buildup until it has emptied.\nResistances to status effects generally work by lengthening the bar, thus requiring more buildup to trigger the effect.\nPreventing negative status effects.\nMost negative status effects can be prevented by wearing equipment that boosts resistance to these effects. For example, the &lt;a href=\"Tattered%20Cloth%20Set\"&gt;Tattered Cloth Set&lt;/a&gt; has a high resistance to poison, while the &lt;a href=\"Bloodshield\"&gt;Bloodshield&lt;/a&gt; significantly boosts all the resistances. &lt;a href=\"Oswald%20of%20Carim\"&gt;Oswald of Carim&lt;/a&gt; sells the &lt;a href=\"Bloodbite%20Ring\"&gt;Bloodbite Ring&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Poisonbite%20Ring\"&gt;Poisonbite Ring&lt;/a&gt;;\u00a0rings that greatly increase bleed and poison resistance, respectively. Items with poison resist are also toxin resistant, with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Poisonbite%20Ring\"&gt;Poisonbite Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nEffects.\n&lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt;.\nBleed is a status effect that builds up after successive attacks from specific enemies' weapons. Once the bleed meter is full, it will deal damage based on a percentage of the victim's &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;. Taking too many bleed effects can become fatal very quickly. Bleed build-up can be stopped through use of a &lt;a href=\"Bloodred%20Moss%20Clump\"&gt;Bloodred Moss Clump&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Blessing\"&gt;Divine Blessing&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0or with the sorcery\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Remedy\"&gt;Remedy&lt;/a&gt;.\nBleed damage can be avoided by &lt;a href=\"rolling\"&gt;rolling&lt;/a&gt; the moment when the bleed meter fills.\n&lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;.\nPoison deals low damage over time at a rate usually more annoying than dangerous. Poison is extremely common in the lower reaches of &lt;a href=\"Blighttown\"&gt;Blighttown&lt;/a&gt;, which is covered largely by a poisonous swamp.\nPoison can be cured with &lt;a href=\"Purple%20Moss%20Clump\"&gt;Purple Moss Clump&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Blooming%20Purple%20Moss%20Clump\"&gt;Blooming Purple Moss Clump&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Blessing\"&gt;Divine Blessing&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Remedy\"&gt;Remedy&lt;/a&gt; sorcery.\nWith the sole exception of the &lt;a href=\"Poisonbite%20Ring\"&gt;Poisonbite Ring&lt;/a&gt;, resistance to Poison is also resistance to Toxic.\n&lt;a href=\"Toxic%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Toxic&lt;/a&gt;.\nToxic is a much more powerful variation of Poison, damaging the player over time at a rapid pace and reducing stamina recovery by 15 per second. The most notable enemies with Toxic attacks are the\u00a0non-respawning &lt;a href=\"Blowdart%20Sniper\"&gt;Blowdart Sniper&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0found in upper\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Blighttown\"&gt;Blighttown&lt;/a&gt;.\nToxic must be cured with &lt;a href=\"Blooming%20Purple%20Moss%20Clump\"&gt;Blooming Purple Moss Clump&lt;/a&gt; (not normal Purple Moss Clump), &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Blessing\"&gt;Divine Blessing&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0or with the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Remedy\"&gt;Remedy&lt;/a&gt; sorcery.\nWith the sole exception of the &lt;a href=\"Poisonbite%20Ring\"&gt;Poisonbite Ring&lt;/a&gt;, resistance to Poison is also resistance to Toxic.\n&lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce inflicted, Curse immediately kills the player character and adds a Curse stack to their next life, halving their maximum HP until removed. Curse build-up can be removed by using a &lt;a href=\"Purging%20Stone\"&gt;Purging Stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Blessing\"&gt;Divine Blessing&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Curse\"&gt;Resist Curse&lt;/a&gt; sorcery. Curse can be removed with &lt;a href=\"Purging%20Stone\"&gt;Purging Stone&lt;/a&gt;s or by talking to &lt;a href=\"Ingward\"&gt;Ingward&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"New%20Londo%20Ruins\"&gt;New Londo Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt; after talking to him when the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Kings\"&gt;Four Kings&lt;/a&gt; are defeated).\nCommon sources of Curse include &lt;a href=\"Basilisk\"&gt;Basilisk&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;Seath&lt;/a&gt;'s breath.\nCursed player characters can damage the &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Banshee\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"New%20Londo%20Ruins\"&gt;New Londo Ruins&lt;/a&gt; without using &lt;a href=\"Transient%20Curse\"&gt;Transient Curse&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCharacters who die to Curse will spawn statues in other players' worlds as a warning.\nPreviously, Curse could stack. This would continuously halve a character's maximum HP with each successive Curse, with two stacks reducing it to 1/4, three to 1/8, etc. This has since been patched.\nEgghead.\nThe Egghead status effect is inflicted by the &lt;a href=\"Egg%20Burdened\"&gt;Egg Burdened&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf they are able to successfully perform a grab attack on the player, a &lt;a href=\"Vile%20Maggot\"&gt;Vile Maggot&lt;/a&gt; will emerge from the egg on its back and latch onto the character's head. Roughly 150 seconds (or 2 minutes and 30 seconds) after the attack, the player will begin scratching their head when standing still, and after another 170 seconds (or 2 minutes and 50 seconds), for a combined total of 320 seconds (or 5 minutes and 20 seconds), an infested egg will form over the player's head, which will prevent the player from wearing a head armor piece.\nWhile suffering from the Egghead status effect, the amount of &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s gained by the player through killing enemies is halved, with the remainder going to the Egg. When consuming a soul item, the soul amount of the consumable is awarded in full to the player, and an equal amount is fed to the Egg. Additionally, &lt;a href=\"Eingyi\"&gt;Eingyi&lt;/a&gt; will change his behavior towards the player, unlocking &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Mist\"&gt;Poison Mist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20Mist\"&gt;Toxic Mist&lt;/a&gt; for purchase while also selling &lt;a href=\"Egg%20Vermifuge\"&gt;Egg Vermifuge&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the player feeds 100,000 souls to the Egg, it will mature, allowing the parasite within to emerge. This parasite replaces all kicks, regardless of weapon, with a maggot attack, which deals minimal damage but inflicts tremendous &lt;a href=\"Poise\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; damage, allowing the player to deal heavy stagger to any enemies that the kick hits. Note that the player retains the Egghead status in this state, and still cannot wear a helm.\nThe only means of a cure is to consume an Egg Vermifuge.\nSlime.\nThe \"Slime\" status effect is inflicted by the &lt;a href=\"Mass%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Mass of Souls&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"minibosses\"&gt;minibosses&lt;/a&gt; found in &lt;a href=\"New%20Londo%20Ruins\"&gt;New Londo Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, when they attack by regurgitating a grey sludge onto the character. If it hits, the victim will appear coated in gunk from head to toe, greatly reducing maneuverability, while draining health over time. The\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt;'s power is also weakened. Nevertheless, its duration lasts for a relatively short time."}

Resistances to status effects generally work by lengthening the bar, thus requiring more buildup to trigger the effect.\nEffects.\nCompared to the original games, \"Dark Souls II\" adjusted many of the game mechanics, particularly death and hollowing, and therefore changed some status effects in relation to the original.\n&lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the bleed meter fills completely the target takes 200 damage and has their maximum stamina and stamina recovery drastically reduced for a short period of time. It also slows roll recovery, lowers agility, and movement speed.\nCharacters that have been bled will produce a heartbeat sound and a faint red visual effect until the effect wears off.\nBleed Resistance reduces buildup by 1% for every 10 points.\n&lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Poison effect drains the target's HP over a period of 20 seconds. This lasts until it is &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29%23Prevention%20and%20cure\"&gt;cured&lt;/a&gt;, the effect expires, or death occurs. The total damage dealt to HP if left uncured is about 1,080 points, with some variation.\nWhen covered in poisonous liquids, such as when the player is submerged in the poison pools in &lt;a href=\"Harvest%20Valley\"&gt;Harvest Valley&lt;/a&gt;, poison will continuously build up until the player, or enemy, is no longer covered in it. The covering fades with time but can also be removed with effects that cure poison, or by entering water.\nPoison Resistance reduces buildup by 1% for every 10 points.\n&lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Toxic&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Toxic effect drains the target's HP over a period of 20 seconds. This lasts until it is &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29%23Prevention%20and%20cure\"&gt;cured&lt;/a&gt;, the effect expires, or death occurs. The total damage dealt to HP if left uncured is about 1,440 points, with some variation.\nToxic is affected by all effects that increases resistance to or cures poison, including poison resistance from &lt;a href=\"Stats%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;stats&lt;/a&gt; and armor.\n&lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt;.\nCurse immediately reduces HP equal to one level of hollowing when it takes effect. If a player is cursed while human, they will now be unable to summon other players. Curse will also apply the visual changes of hollowing, such as loss of hair and bodily decay. Upon reaching full hollowing, curse will no longer affect players until they become human again. Curse also has no effect on phantoms, whether they are friendly or hostile to the host.\nCurse Resistance reduces buildup by 1% for every 10 points. The &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Skin\"&gt;Hollow Skin&lt;/a&gt; makes the player completely immune to the Curse status effect. In \"&lt;a href=\"Scholar%20of%20the%20First%20Sin\"&gt;Scholar of the First Sin&lt;/a&gt;\", the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Witch%20Veil\"&gt;Black Witch Veil&lt;/a&gt; also grants complete curse immunity.\n&lt;a href=\"Petrification\"&gt;Petrification&lt;/a&gt;.\nSimilar to &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt; in \"Dark Souls\", petrification causes instant death. It also reduces HP by two stages.\nPetrification Resistance reduces buildup by 1% for every 10 points.\n&lt;a href=\"Oil%20%28status%20effect%29\"&gt;Oil&lt;/a&gt;.\nOil causes the player to turn jet black. If the player takes &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;fire damage&lt;/a&gt; or equips a &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20Flame%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;pyromancy flame&lt;/a&gt; while covered in oil, they will explode dealing high fire damage to themselves and anything nearby, including friendly players.\n&lt;a href=\"Waterlogged\"&gt;Waterlogged&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe waterlogged status increases &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29%23Fire%20Defense\"&gt;fire defense&lt;/a&gt; by 300 but reduces &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29%23Lightning%20Defense\"&gt;lightning defense&lt;/a&gt; by 150. The duration of the status depends on how much the water covered the player, with rolling applying the maximum duration. Additionally, it can affect both players and enemies, with bosses like &lt;a href=\"Looking%20Glass%20Knight\"&gt;Looking Glass Knight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Demon%20of%20Song\"&gt;Demon of Song&lt;/a&gt; being permanently waterlogged due to their arenas.\nAdditionally, being covered in water will wash off poison and oil."}

Once the bar is filled, the effect will proc. Status effects will hinder a character's performance in combat in various ways. Status effects may also affect enemies and bosses, but certain enemies will be more resistant than others, while some will be outright immune to certain effects.\nStatus Effects.\n&lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Poison status effect inflicts damage over time on the afflicted target, slowly draining their &lt;a href=\"Hit%20Points%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; while the status effect is active. While the damage is generally low, if left untreated it can inflict a non-negligible amount of overall damage. It can be prevented or cured by consuming a &lt;a href=\"Purple%20Moss%20Clump%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Purple Moss Clump&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Toxic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Toxic&lt;/a&gt;.\nA stronger form of Poison, Toxic inflicts also damage over time, but is deadlier in that it is three times as strong. It also inflicts a stamina regeneration penalty on the target, reducing their ability to recover stamina. It can be prevented or cured by consuming a &lt;a href=\"Blooming%20Purple%20Moss%20Clump%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Blooming Purple Moss Clump&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Bleed status effect causes instant burst damage upon proc, and then immediately reset, allowing it to be inflicted again. Unlike Poison and Toxic, which deal a static amount of damage, Blood Loss will inflict damage based on the target's maximum HP, meaning that it is effective at all stages of the game. Bleed procs can be prevented by consuming a &lt;a href=\"Bloodred%20Moss%20Clump%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bloodred Moss Clump&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Frost\"&gt;Frostbite&lt;/a&gt;.\nNew to \"Dark Souls III\", Frost will inflict immediate burst damage upon proc, and then inflict a debuff upon the target. While under the effects of Frostbite, targets will suffer from decreased absorption, causing them to take additional damage, as well as significantly reduced stamina recovery speed. Frostbite proc can be prevented or cured by consuming a &lt;a href=\"Rime-blue%20Moss%20Clump\"&gt;Rime-blue Moss Clump&lt;/a&gt;, and once procced can also be cured by taking any sort of &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage.\n&lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe most dangerous status effect in the game, Curse will cause instant and immediate &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; if the status effect bar completely fills up. The only way to prevent this is by letting the status effect dissipate over time, or by consuming a &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Blessing%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Divine Blessing&lt;/a&gt;.\nPreventing and Curing Status Effects.\nStatus effect defense can be inherently increased by leveling certain stats:"}

The primary differences are an increase in game difficulty, in the form of more powerful &lt;a href=\"Enemies%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt;, and greater &lt;a href=\"Souls%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; gains from defeating these stronger enemies.

Additionally, some corpses and chests contain different items, certain &lt;a href=\"Boss%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt; gain additional drops, and some fights are changed through the addition of new mechanics, attacks, or additional enemies.\nBurning a &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20Ascetic\"&gt;Bonfire Ascetic&lt;/a&gt; increases the New Game cycle by one stage in the location the bonfire is linked to, with all the effects that entering NG+ normally would have, along with restoring the items in the area found in wooden chests or corpses in the world. The local New Game cycle is represented by \"&lt;a href=\"bonfire%20intensity\"&gt;bonfire intensity&lt;/a&gt;,\" which can be viewed while resting at a bonfire, and is increased by both entering NG+ and burning ascetics.

Upon entering New Game+, enemies gain two, three, or four times the damage and the souls they grant on death are increased by a similar amount, while health is usually doubled. On later New Game cycles, the increase is minute, and new enemies are only added in specific spots, such as the basement of the &lt;a href=\"Majula%20Mansion\"&gt;mansion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Majula\"&gt;Majula&lt;/a&gt;.

Populated by passive &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;Hollow&lt;/a&gt;s and dangerous &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;s. Once the water has been drained, the lower levels will be populated by numerous &lt;a href=\"Darkwraith%20%28enemy%29\"&gt;Darkwraiths&lt;/a&gt;. Piles of corpses fill the ground near the floodgates, a grim reminder of New Londo's tragic past.\nThe area is highly dangerous. Ghosts will constantly ambush the player from walls, floors, and ceilings. Falling into deep water is a major &lt;a href=\"Environmental%20Hazards%23Dark%20Souls\"&gt;hazard&lt;/a&gt; and will result in &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. The numerous Darkwraiths can also prove to be challenging enemies to new players.\nThere are no &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;bonfires&lt;/a&gt; in the New Londo Ruins.\nLore.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;.\nNew Londo was a small country of humans close to the &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;, the city of the gods. When the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Kings\"&gt;Four Kings&lt;/a&gt;, the great leaders of the land were recognized for their abilities and foresight, &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; rewarded them with a &lt;a href=\"Bequeathed%20Lord%20Soul%20Shard\"&gt;fragment of his powerful Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt; and the title of kings, using his power to bind and hold close to him the powerful humans, as the god also allowed them to build their civiliazion near his city. Over time their city of humans grew to host countless lives and becoming a robust and flourishing culture. The advanced civilization even managed to develop healing sorceries that reduced bleeding and poisoning, like &lt;a href=\"Remedy\"&gt;Remedy&lt;/a&gt;, an art unique to New Londo that was practiced by sorcerers called Healer. Although at some point the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; began to fade out, leading to the emergence of the Curse of Undeath, the city continued to exist and function as an Undead city, implying a good governance of the four kings who managed to adapt to the change.\nAfter Gwyn sacrificed himself to link the fading First Flame, the &lt;a href=\"Primordial%20Serpent\"&gt;Primordial Serpent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Darkstalker%20Kaathe\"&gt;Kaathe&lt;/a&gt; began searching for a human strong enough to become the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Lord\"&gt;Dark Lord&lt;/a&gt; capable of leading humans and usher in an &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Dark\"&gt;Age of Dark&lt;/a&gt;. At some point Kaathe arrived in New Londo and managed to seduce the Four Kings to follow his ideals, teaching them the art of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Hand\"&gt;Lifedrain&lt;/a&gt; so that they could preserve their humanity even while Undead and so cast off the &lt;a href=\"Darksign\"&gt;shackles&lt;/a&gt; placed upon them by the gods. But his dark influence did not stop with the kings and in fact their entire army followed them. The knights of New Londo became &lt;a href=\"Darkwraith%20%28enemy%29\"&gt;Darkwraith&lt;/a&gt;s, servants of the Dark who learned the art of Lifedrain and used it to absorb humanity. As the Four Kings' were able to open an &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt; in the center of their city, their very bodies were mutated by their freed Dark Soul and the Darkwraiths' &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Set\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; transformed too as they began to employ the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Eye%20Orb\"&gt;Red Eye Orb&lt;/a&gt;s granted by Kaathe to seek humanity and plunge further into the powers of the Dark, \nA nation of humans freed from the shackles of the Darksign and who not only began to understand the powers of their Dark Soul but had an entire army at their disposal that shared this power represented an unparalleled threat to the gods of Anor Londo who branded the Darkwraiths as diabolical enemies of man and of every living thing. For this reason &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Artorias\"&gt;Artorias&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Knights%20of%20Gwyn\"&gt;Four Knights of Gwyn&lt;/a&gt;, was sent to fight the soldiers of New Londo and was given a &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Pendant\"&gt;Silver Pendant&lt;/a&gt; to deflect the Dark of the Abyss in its magical forms. However this did not prove sufficient to cross the Abyss of the Four Kings and Artorias was forced to forge a covenant with the \"beasts of the Abyss\", obtaining a &lt;a href=\"Covenant%20of%20Artorias\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt; that would allow him to cross the Abyss but also cursing his Greatsword. Artorias thus became known as the \"Abysswalker\" and hunted the Darkwraiths but failed to eliminate the Four Kings and thus eliminate the Abyss of New Londo.\nHaving failed to eliminate the dark threat, an agonizing and terrible decision was made: flooding the entire land of New Londo despite the realization that countless lives and the entire culture of the country would be lost. For this task, sorcerers were called and the feat was accomplished without even evacuating the city's civilians, sealing away the Four Kings, their Darkwraiths and the entire population with them, the victims were thus cursed and became &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;s roaming the ruins of their country, making mincemeat of any being within blade\u2019s reach. The sorcerers who carried out the deed remained on site with the task of becoming guardians of the magic seal and the floodgates built around the city, wearing &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Set\"&gt;crimson robes&lt;/a&gt; that symbolize their resolve to keep the seal shut forever and their atonement for all who were sacrificed. Over time, however, two of the three sorcerers abandoned New Londo upon tiring of their duties and leaving &lt;a href=\"Ingward\"&gt;Ingward&lt;/a&gt; alone, to wait for a &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt; strong enough to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Lordvessel\"&gt;Lordvessel&lt;/a&gt; and challenge the Four Kings.\nAlthough decades have passed since New Londo was reduced to rubble and submerged, the Four Kings remained alive in their Abyss, while the Darkwraight continued to wait and patrol the area. When a &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt; was able to ring the &lt;a href=\"Bells%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Bells of Awakening&lt;/a&gt;, overcome the challenges of &lt;a href=\"Sen%27s%20Fortress\"&gt;Sen's Fortress&lt;/a&gt; and reach &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; thus being rewarded with the &lt;a href=\"Lordvessel\"&gt;Lordvessel&lt;/a&gt;, they would be guided by &lt;a href=\"Kingseeker%20Frampt\"&gt;Kingseeker Frampt&lt;/a&gt; to find immense souls to fill the receptacle and link the fading &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; to succeed Gwyn in his sacrifice. The Undead would thus have proved their strenght to Ingward to open the floodgates of the city and find a way to traverse the Abyss until they reached the Four Kings, challenging and killed them to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Bequeathed%20Lord%20Soul%20Shard\"&gt;fragment of a Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt; they still possessed.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough the Four Kings had been defeated, the seal that contained the ruins of New Londo and the water that had submerged it had been removed and as a result the remaining Darkwraiths were free to spread across the rest of the world, continuing to wreak havoc. Although these knights subsumed by dark never reached &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; in strength, knowledge of their existence has come to the region through foreign legends as poor souls who chased the art of Lifedrain and were able to freely manipulate the Dark, implying that they attacked the countries around Drangleic.\nDespite this, the residuals sins of the knights who had succumbed to the temptations of dark, reached Drangleic in the form of &lt;a href=\"Cracked%20Red%20Eye%20Orb%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Cracked Red Eye Orbs&lt;/a&gt;. These artifacts were actively employed by the covenant of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Brotherhood of Blood&lt;/a&gt; to invade other locations and times and collect the blood of other Undead. Although this cult followed the same combat and invasion philosophy as the original covenant of the Darkwraiths, it was also centered around the mysterious figure of the god &lt;a href=\"Nahr%20Alma%2C%20God%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Nahr Alma, God of Blood&lt;/a&gt; and encouraged its followers to reject the world and follow a path of constant struggle and bloodshed, indulging in their hedonistic desires for violence to collect blood and offer it as a sacrifice for their god instead of seeking to understand the Dark powers of the humans.\nThe knowledge of the ancient healing sorceries of New Londo somehow survived and reached Drangleic where they were employed this time through miracles like &lt;a href=\"Caressing%20Prayer\"&gt;Caressing Prayer&lt;/a&gt;, a text developed only around the kingdom of Vendrick and whose authenticity as a sacred text was even questioned, that was able to purify the body and remove all poison of the caster and those close to them.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough countless centuries had passed since the fall of New Londo to the dark, remnants of the Darkwraiths continued to exist as dark inavders, wearing &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; now worn to the point of looking like they may crumble to dust at any moment, and they reached the region of &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Keep\"&gt;Farron&lt;/a&gt; which was converging toward that of &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy this point the name of New Londo itself had been lost but the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Eye%20Orb%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Red Eye Orbs&lt;/a&gt; rooted in the small country continued to be used. In fact, the followers of &lt;a href=\"Rosaria%2C%20Mother%20of%20Rebirth\"&gt;Rosaria, Mother of Rebirth&lt;/a&gt;, as members of the covenant of &lt;a href=\"Rosaria%27s%20Fingers\"&gt;Rosaria's Fingers&lt;/a&gt;, would employ themto invade other locations and times and collect the &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Tongue\"&gt;Pale Tongue&lt;/a&gt;s from other Undead and offer them to their speechless goddess.\nThe ancient miracle of Drangleic times which conveyed the knowledge of the healing sorceries of New Londo, in the times of Lothric is associated with &lt;a href=\"Caitha%2C%20Goddess%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Caitha, Goddess of Tears&lt;/a&gt; in the form of the miracle &lt;a href=\"Caressing%20Tears\"&gt;Caressing Tears&lt;/a&gt;, the tale of the many deaths surrounding the goddess that was able to cure from bleeding, frostbite and poisoning."}

There is, however, a shortcut that can be unlocked which makes it easier to access the area's boss (only in )."}

The maximum duration of this spell is 90 seconds at 61 Intelligence which caps the duration scaling. Faith does not factor into the duration scaling of this spell. The uniqueness of this spell comes from the fact that casting it also reduces the player's view by a significant amount, save for a small oval around the player's upper body, thus causing the player to essentially have \"tunnel vision\" for the spell's duration.\nAttunement Milestones.\nLike all other spells, the amount of casts per slot increases upon reaching certain Attunement milestones:\nDuration Scaling Information.\nDuration values are listed in seconds.

It is very useful against &lt;a href=\"Boss%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt; as the buff can place the player on more even footing against their large health pools and heavy damage.\nOnline gameplay.\nAs with many other buffs, this miracle has reduced effect against other players, and thus is not as powerful when used to combat invaders or a host and his phantoms. However, it does find use in co-operative play as it can be used to buff all nearby allies to increase their strength across the board, especially when fighting a boss."}

For example: A weapon with 200 damage, and a Divine multiplier of 120 will do 1.2x the amount of damage the weapon would've done against regular enemies, and will thus end up dealing 240. [130 -&gt; 1.3x, 140 -&gt; 1.4x, and so on]\nIt also has slightly higher returns on AR than &lt;a href=\"Divine%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;Divine&lt;/a&gt; infusions on most weapons on characters exceeding Faith level 30-40.\nWeapons.\nThe following is a list of weapons that are either innately imbued or are found already ascended with the Occult auxiliary effect.\nInnate:\nInfused:\nLore.\nAccording to the item description of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ember\"&gt;Dark Ember&lt;/a&gt;, Occult weapons were once used to hunt the &lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;Gods&lt;/a&gt;, as well as their kin and followers.\nIt was likely for this reason that the church - otherwise known as the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20White\"&gt;Way of White&lt;/a&gt; - hid this forbidden ember in the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariamis\"&gt;Painted World of Ariamis&lt;/a&gt;.\nPossible connection to Velka:.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ember\"&gt;Dark Ember&lt;/a&gt;, which is used for Occult infusions, is not actually found in &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariamis\"&gt;Painted World of Ariamis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe high density of objects in the Painted World relating to &lt;a href=\"Velka%2C%20Goddess%20of%20Sin\"&gt;Velka, Goddess of Sin&lt;/a&gt; strongly suggests a connection between the two, which in turn hints at a connection between the power of the Occult and her. She is known as a \"rogue deity\" and is highly implied to be at odds with the &lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;Gods&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Velka%27s%20Rapier\"&gt;Velka's Rapier&lt;/a&gt; is one of only three weapons that innately deal Occult damage.

Although it increases a weapon's &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt;, it also decreases the &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; base damage, resulting in dealing less Magic damage overall. Additionally, it increases the base &lt;a href=\"Physical%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; damage without affecting &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; scaling. Ultimately, compared to the Divine upgrade path an Occult weapon will deal slightly more equalized damage between Physical and Magic.\nLike Divine weapons, Occult weapons cannot be &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Augmentation\"&gt;augmented&lt;/a&gt;.

However, Occult weapons hold the advantage of not having to be enchanted to reach their maximum potential, making them more useful in the long term.\nBecause they lack the Divine auxiliary effect, Occult weapons cannot be used to permanently kill skeletons found in &lt;a href=\"The%20Catacombs\"&gt;The Catacombs&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Tomb of the Giants&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Occult auxiliary effect is said to be effective against &lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;Gods&lt;/a&gt; and their following and kin."}

His emblem, boldly depicted in gold on the shields of his royal guard, in fact represented a large bird looking up to the sky, toward a crown, symbolizing the royal's most cherished desire of producing a worthy Champion to maintain the Age of Fire.\nAt some point the king would marry &lt;a href=\"Gwynevere%2C%20Princess%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Gwynevere, Queen of Lothric&lt;/a&gt; and with her generated the divine princes of the kingdom who were entrusted with different destinies. &lt;a href=\"Lorian%2C%20Elder%20Prince%20and%20Lothric%2C%20Younger%20Prince\"&gt;Lorian&lt;/a&gt;, as the eldest prince, was designated heir to the throne and for this reason he received the &lt;a href=\"Lorian%27s%20Set\"&gt;ancient brass armor&lt;/a&gt; handed down by the royal family together with a &lt;a href=\"Lorian%27s%20Helm\"&gt;crown helmet&lt;/a&gt; patterned with flame, symbol of the kingdom's tradition of firelinking.\n&lt;a href=\"Lothric%2C%20Younger%20Prince\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt; instead, as the youngest prince, was designated to become a &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;, sacrificing himself in the linking of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; to keep the Age of Fire alive. The prince was in fact the hope not only of the entire kingdom but the result of the long obsession of Oceiros and the royal family to produce a worthy Champion, for the young man who was supposed to enter the &lt;a href=\"Kiln%20of%20the%20First%20Flame%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Kiln of the Flame&lt;/a&gt; arena, a &lt;a href=\"Lothric%27s%20Holy%20Sword\"&gt;platinum sword&lt;/a&gt; was created and blessed with strong magic by &lt;a href=\"Emma%2C%20High%20Priestess%20of%20Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;the High Priestess&lt;/a&gt; even before he was ready to fullfill his destiny. Oceiros in fact created immense propaganda around his son Lothric, not only giving him the name of the kingdom, but building statues that depicted him ready for sacrifice and with his sacred sword even before he linked the Flame, already preparing his throne at the &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt; who called him the \"Holy King of Lothric\" and the hope of the kingdom and its lineage. Despite all the hopes that were placed in him, Lothric soon revealed himself to be a sick and shriveled child, so weak that he never grew out of his &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20Set\"&gt;baby clothes&lt;/a&gt;, which remained his only clothing throughout his life and were blessed to at least try to keep him healthy.\nWhen the royal family and Oceiros realized that Lothric would not improve from his condition, they resorted to repulsive acts in an attempt to obtain a worthy Champion for the linking, even if it ment to create something inhuman: they would in fact bind the souls of the two brother princes together with a &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;curse&lt;/a&gt;, in the hope that the weaker Lothric would thus share the strength of Lorian, making them able to sacrifice themselves to the Flame together. However, their union also led the older brother to share the younger's condition, making Lorian crippled and mute to the point of being unable to walk on his own legs and the two unable to link the Flame In his later years, now consumed by continuous failures in the search for a solution to the problem of finding a worthy Champion and driven to insanity by his work with Lothric's blood, Oceiros became fascinated by dragons and began to slide into madness, eventually turning to the cursed knowledge of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt;. Here Oceiros found the twisted worship of the &lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;White Dragon Seath&lt;/a&gt; and became so absorbed in it that he wore a &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Ring\"&gt;ring with a dragon scale&lt;/a&gt; and had his army use &lt;a href=\"Wooden%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; decorated with a \"white dragon\" while giving his royal palace guards &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Stoneplate%20Ring\"&gt;magic stoneplate rings&lt;/a&gt; that absorbed magic damage. \nAfter losing his sanity to his delusions, Oceiros became known as the \"Consumed King\" and many assassins were sent to try to kill him and remove him from power, but he always managed to survive attributing his resilience to the divine \"protection\" of the dragon scale of his ring.\" Continuing to study the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Scroll\"&gt;sorceries and knowledge&lt;/a&gt; contained in the Archives and brought to Lothric by the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Sage\"&gt;Crystal Sage&lt;/a&gt;s, the successors of &lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;White Dragon Seath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Big%20Hat%20Logan\"&gt;Big Hat Logan&lt;/a&gt;'s researches, , Oceiros found himself walking the same path Logan, reaching the same level of \"enlightenment\" of the sorcerer and then going completely mad. The king, in his deep delusions, believed he had to become a dragon himself in order to produce an heir strong enough to link the Flame. Eventually, Oceiros managed to transform himself into a scaleless dragon form, albeit an imperfect and distorted one, even obtaining the &lt;a href=\"White%20Dragon%20Breath%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;sorcery of Seath's crystal breath&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce his desire for transcendence was satiated, Oceiros once again fathered a child with Gwynevere, believing that a descendant of dragons would make a worthy Champion. Once he obtained his child &lt;a href=\"Ocelotte\"&gt;Ocelotte&lt;/a&gt;, Oceiros retreated with his &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20Knight\"&gt;royal guard&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Consumed%20King%27s%20Garden\"&gt;royal gardens&lt;/a&gt; close to the &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt;, completely ignoring the state of his kingdom to protect the \"child of dragons\" who represented the culmination of his desires and the only thing left in his life. Despite everything, the king was not even able to see Ocelotte, holding him tightly in his palm and relying only on his madness.\nFight overview.\nThe battle starts with a cutscene of King Oceiros in a delusional state while holding his youngest child, &lt;a href=\"Ocelotte\"&gt;Ocelotte&lt;/a&gt; in his palm. Once he notices the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20One\"&gt;Ashen One&lt;/a&gt;'s presence, he will pick up his staff from the floor and prepare for battle, willing to defend the welfare of his child with his own life.\nOn his first phase, he attacks almost solely by swinging his staff. His attacks are very slow and easy to avoid, taking a considerable amount of time between swings. Additionally, most of his attacks are performed in front of him, leaving his lower body open to attack most of the time. He will occasionally perform a jump to smash onto the player and also summon fountains around him that inflict &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt; build-up upon touch.\nOn his second phase, however, Oceiros becomes much more aggressive. He will brutally dispose of the baby in his palm and tearing his staff to pieces by smashing them into the ground. He then proceeds to stand on all four limbs and the battle then becomes much more similar to that of &lt;a href=\"Vordt%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Vordt&lt;/a&gt;'s, by rushing at the player from one end of the arena to the other.\nSome of his attacks now include performing a series of ferocious bites at the player in a very similar fashion as the &lt;a href=\"Sulyvahn%27s%20Beast\"&gt;Sulyvahn's Beast&lt;/a&gt;, an extensive barrage of claw-swipes, and a spinning move when both he and the player end up occupying the same space.\nHe also can now unleash a &lt;a href=\"White%20Dragon%20Breath%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;white breath&lt;/a&gt; that summons crystals that inflict &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt; build-up. Most importantly, he now has an aerial attack where he jumps up and glides toward the player, unleashing a trail of the same crystals and which can kill the player almost instantly.\nStrategy.\nThe first phase of the battle is not very difficult. Just rush toward the king's hind legs and attack. Since most of his attacks will end up in front of him, staying below him will prevent the player from being damaged for the most part. Most likely, he will then proceed to jump up and try to smash onto the player, be ready to move or roll away when this happens.\nThe fountains he summons are also very easy to avoid, as they are amply telegraphed and take a moment before they start dealing damage.\nIf the player ends up occupying the same space as the king, he will unleash a spinning attack. This is telegraphed with enough time and has poor collision detection, making it easy to avoid.\nWhen about 40% of Oceiros's health has been depleted, he will switch to his secondary phase. Tactics for this phase change drastically from the first one. The player should keep distance from the king and let him attack first, retaliating only while he is recovering.\nMost of the time, he will lunge at the player with great force, usually ending at the other side of the arena. When he finishes this move, he will turn around and roar, leaving him completely vulnerable at that moment. The player must evade this attack and then rush after him to hit him in the face. If the player is able to hit him enough times directly to the face, he will stagger and become open to a &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;critical attack&lt;/a&gt; (in a similar way as the &lt;a href=\"Sulyvahn%27s%20Beast\"&gt;Sulyvahn's Beast&lt;/a&gt;s).\nHis barrage of claw-swipes have very poor tracking and if the player can evade it in the first place, the king will be vulnerable from behind for a considerable amount of time while he keeps on walking forward, finishing the move.\nHis &lt;a href=\"White%20Dragon%20Breath%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;white breath&lt;/a&gt; is also easy to avoid and amply telegraphed. He makes a pause and then unleashes it from the right to the left side of the screen. Circle him by the left and attack him while he is performing the attack.\nHis flying attack, on the other hand, is extremely dangerous and can kill the player almost instantly if they let themselves be caught inside the trail of crystals, which fill up the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt; meter at an alarming rate. When the player sees him jumping from a distance, they must make it a priority to run or roll in a perpendicular direction from the trail.\nOceiros will say a few dialogues throughout the course of the battle. While these are onscreen, the player will be restricted from performing most actions.

However, Lothric soon revealed himself to be a sick and shriveled child, so weak that he never grew out of his &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20Set\"&gt;baby clothes&lt;/a&gt;, and Oceiros went as far as &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;cursing&lt;/a&gt; Lothric and his older brother Lorian to bind their &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20the%20Twin%20Princes\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; together in a failed attempt to create a stronger sacrifice. \nIn his later years, now consumed by his continuous failures, Oceiros became fascinated by dragons and began to slide into madness, eventually turning to the cursed knowledge of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt; where he founded the heretical faith in the &lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;white dragon Seath&lt;/a&gt;. Continuing to study the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Scroll\"&gt;sorceries and knowledge&lt;/a&gt; contained in the Archives and brought by the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Sage\"&gt;Crystal Sage&lt;/a&gt;s to Lothric, Oceiros found himself walking the same path as &lt;a href=\"Big%20Hat%20Logan\"&gt;Big Hat Logan&lt;/a&gt;, reaching the same level of \"enlightenment\" as him and then going completely mad. The king, in his deep delusions, believed he had to become a dragon himself in order to produce an heir strong enough to link the Flame.\nOceiros eventually managed to transform himself into a scaleless dragon form, albeit an imperfect and distorted one, even obtaining the &lt;a href=\"White%20Dragon%20Breath%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;sorcery of Seath's crystal breath&lt;/a&gt;\nOnce his desire for transcendence was satiated, Oceiros once again fathered a child with Gwynevere, believing that a descendant of dragons would make a worthy Champion. Either because of the child was born deformed and monstrous, or because she suffered violence from Oceiros or was horrified by the King's decaying sanity, but the birth of Ocelotte was too much for the Queen Gwynevere to bare: she decided to abandon the kingdom never to return again, leaving the newborn with the twisted father. Once he obtained Ocelotte, Oceiros retreated with his &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20Knight\"&gt;royal guard&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Consumed%20King%27s%20Garden\"&gt;royal gardens&lt;/a&gt; close to the &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt;, completely ignoring the state of his kingdom to protect the \"child of dragons\" who represented the culmination of his desires and the only thing left in his life. Despite everything, the king was not even able to see Ocelotte, holding him tightly in his palm and relying only on his madness.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20One\"&gt;Ashen One&lt;/a&gt; encountered the consumed king secluded in a chapel within his &lt;a href=\"Consumed%20King%27s%20Garden\"&gt;gardens&lt;/a&gt;, he can be seen holding the baby in his palm, and murmuring to himself of the great power his son Ocelotte had, embracing the child and preparing for battle, never to let any harm fall upon him. During the battle a baby's cries are heard, implying Ocelotte is present but simply invisibile causing Oceiros to accuse them of hiding from him. When he has suffered enough damage, the king becomes completely feral and slams his invisible child against the ground in frustration, causing an explosion of magic energy."}

They are the implied creations of &lt;a href=\"Aldia%2C%20Scholar%20of%20the%20First%20Sin\"&gt;Aldia&lt;/a&gt;. They are heavyset in stature and larger than the player, with a large, round belly and thick, pudgy limbs. Despite their girth, their speed is impressive and makes them a painfully difficult foe, particularly in &lt;a href=\"Aldia%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Aldia's Keep&lt;/a&gt; where there is less room to avoid their devastating attacks. Best to avoid if possible, or to use ranged combat from within doorways where they cannot fit.\nLocations.\nOne Ogre is located in the beginning area of &lt;a href=\"Things%20Betwixt\"&gt;Things Betwixt&lt;/a&gt;, past a hidden opening in the rock wall by the bridge. Defeating this Ogre rewards the player with the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Ring\"&gt;Stone Ring&lt;/a&gt;, although it is not recommended to challenge the beast this early on unless one is confident in their skills. \nTwo more are located further on, on a sandy beach just past the third fog gate in the cave leading to &lt;a href=\"Majula\"&gt;Majula&lt;/a&gt;. Defeating these two will see the player rewarded with the &lt;a href=\"Handmaid%27s%20Ladle\"&gt;Handmaid's Ladle&lt;/a&gt; upon returning to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Lady\"&gt;Old Ladies'&lt;/a&gt; house in Things Betwixt and speaking to the handmaiden.\nAnother Ogre can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Amana\"&gt;Shrine of Amana&lt;/a&gt;. This one has increased health and does more damage, and is a difficult enemy in the deep water.\nAnother Ogre is located in a hallway at &lt;a href=\"Aldia%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Aldia's Keep&lt;/a&gt;. It is located behind a locked wooden cell door.\nSeveral Ogres can be encountered whilst exploring &lt;a href=\"Aldia%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Aldia's Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The player is advised to be extra careful when fighting them as they can destroy the cages housing other monsters, which will immediately attack the player. They can also break through the stone walls in the area.\nOne Ogre spawns at the start of the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20of%20Fallen%20Giants\"&gt;Forest of Fallen Giants&lt;/a&gt;. Since its position is out of the way, just avoiding it is easy. It drops &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20a%20Proud%20Knight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Souls of a Proud Knight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Titanite%20Shard%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Titanite Shards&lt;/a&gt;, so if one has the skill (or is a Sorcerer), farming the Ogre is well worth the risk, especially if the player has just started.\nOne Ogre spawns in the &lt;a href=\"Shaded%20Woods\"&gt;Shaded Woods&lt;/a&gt;, on the path leading to &lt;a href=\"Aldia%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Aldia's Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nDespite their hulking frame, Ogres can move at a surprising speed and their attacks have a long reach. They will try to smash the player with their fists or crush them by sitting on them. They can also topple over, flattening the player and grab them and eat them, which can deal heavy damage, possibly killing the player. When a player has low health it is possible that the Ogre will pick them up and swallow them whole.\nThe player is advised to not engage an Ogre unless they have leveled up or if they are confident in their skills. Ranged weapons or magic will enable the player to dispatch these beasts from a safe distance, but if they wish to engage them in close quarters, the best time to strike is after the Ogre performs its falling attack. The player can also attack the Ogre easily from behind but must beware of its sit attack. They seem to also be weak against thrust attacks.\nAn easy strategy to take an Ogre down consists into luring him to perform the attack where he falls flat on his back, then quickly run to the other side of the creature (near his feet) and wait for him to stand up. This will leave the player positioned right at his back, causing him to execute his sitting attack, which is very easy to avoid and leaves him open for a few melee attacks. When he stands up, just stand behind him again and he'll perform another sitting attack. Repeat this process until he is defeated.\nDue to their large size, Ogres won't be able to fit through narrow spaces. There are a few instances in the game where this can be exploited (&lt;a href=\"Things%20Betwixt\"&gt;Things Betwixt&lt;/a&gt; being a prime example, where two Ogres attack at the same time). The player needs to aggro an Ogre and then run to the other side of any doorway. Then, the player needs to carefully approach the doorway, luring the Ogre(s) to attack (rolling out of the way if necessary) and attack him a few times while he recovers, repeating this process until he dies.\nDrops.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Things Betwixt =\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The country is one of many kingdoms of the region that rose and fell from the collapse of &lt;a href=\"Heide%27s%20Tower%20of%20Flame\"&gt;Heide&lt;/a&gt; to that of the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Belfry%20Sol\"&gt;Alken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belfry%20Luna\"&gt;Venn&lt;/a&gt;.\nOlaphis was a country of extraordinarily advanced technology and magic, developed in both &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;sorceries&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;pyromancies&lt;/a&gt;, and its craftsmen were able to create excessively complex halberds like the &lt;a href=\"Helix%20Halberd\"&gt;Helix Halberd&lt;/a&gt;s and powerful staves like the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Staff of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;. The core of the kingdom was located around the immense fortress of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Bastille\"&gt;Bastille&lt;/a&gt;, but the land under its control extended as far as the region that would be called &lt;a href=\"Brightstone%20Cove%20Tseldora\"&gt;Brightstone Cove Tseldora&lt;/a&gt; during the times of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; and artifacts of this civilization can also be found in the location of the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Amana\"&gt;Shrine of Amana&lt;/a&gt;. In fact the kingdom mined the brightsone, gems infused with magic as they were fragments of an &lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;ancient powerful being&lt;/a&gt;, and turned them into crystal which were used in their catalyst for sorceries, thus greatly amplifying the might of the magic casted and increasing its efficacy over time as the crystal would be further polished by the great magic power of the user.\nAt one point, the kingdom of Olaphis invited the great sorcerer &lt;a href=\"Straid%20of%20Olaphis\"&gt;Straid&lt;/a&gt; into the country for his immense and varied knowledge. Straid was indeed an extraordinarily talented mage well-versed in every aspect of sorcery and pyromancy but but his continuous search for knowledge led him to never stay in one place for too long. Straid, however, remained in Olaphis for a long time and began to hone his magic to very high levels, even creating new sorceries and pyromancies and thus earning himself the reputation of \"great mage of Olaphis\". He was able to devise a sorcery like &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Bolt\"&gt;Soul Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, capable of firing a blinding and piercing bolt of souls, perfecting a previous spell that would back-fire on its caster. He also created &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Soul%20Arrow\"&gt;Homing Soul Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, a sorcery capable of fire souls arrows that followed their targets and even the more powerful variant of &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Homing%20Soul%20Arrow\"&gt;Heavy Homing Soul Arrow&lt;/a&gt;. He also created pyromancies such as &lt;a href=\"Lingering%20Flame\"&gt;Lingering Flame&lt;/a&gt;, capable of releasing a static fireball that would explode when foes approached, and &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Swathe\"&gt;Flame Swathe&lt;/a&gt;, that could envelop far away foes in flames and make them burn. Straid also used the brightstones already in use in Olaphis to create magnificent magical rings such like the &lt;a href=\"Dispelling%20Ring\"&gt;Dispelling Ring&lt;/a&gt; capable of increasing defenses from fire, magic, lightning and darkness and the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Resistance\"&gt;Ring of Resistance&lt;/a&gt; capable of increasing resistance to poison, bleeding, petrification and curse. These masterpieces were created with preeminent arts that harmonized the power of four brightstones possessing different effects into a single one, highlighting the immense skill and talent of their creator. However, the sorcerer was constantly and absolutely ignorant in his research and crafts and, also due to his arrogance and sense of superiority, he never took on any apprentices.\nAt a certain point, as has already happened in the past, the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; began to fade and consequently the undead began to appear. Initially, the curse was seen as a disease and therefore to contain it the undead were captured and locked up in the Bastille fortress in order to protect the land from the spreading curse . However, given the true nature of Undeath this wasn't enough and the king of Olaphis became wracked with fear and suspicion and started to see the progenitor of curse in anything and everything as the curse continued to spread across his kingdom. In a foolish attemp to keep the undead out of sight and erase the threat he would imprison everyone suspected to be the vessel for the \"disease\" in his castle that became a prison. Now paranoid and aware of his own frailty, the king seized anybody that he perceived as a threat and he found undesirable, cursed or no, and impounded them in the prison fortress, everything and everyone deemed detestable and inconvenient or that shouldn't be seen was locked up there.\nThe king's insecurities finally turned to the great mage Straid who had once been welcomed into Olpahis. The sorcerer had understood how the cyclical nature of the Curse of Undeath was linked to the strength of the flame and how what was happening in the region had already happened many times in the past, leading various kingdoms to flourish only collapse after a short time, only for the almost extinguished flame to be eventually revived and leading to the formation of new countries. Straid's power and knowledge became the subject of fear and he was tricked into a trap, petrified and imprisoned in the Bastille. Since he had never taken apprentices most of his wisdom and results were thus lost with him as he remained locked and, after him even the other sorcerers of Olaphis suffered dreadful persecution and were imprisoned too. As the fortress of the Bastille reached the point of being saturated with undead, the king of Olaphis buikt the an &lt;a href=\"No-man%27s%20Wharf\"&gt;immense underground port&lt;/a&gt; and used the &lt;a href=\"Flexile%20Sentry\"&gt;Flexile Sentries&lt;/a&gt;, monstrous creatures born from the fusion of a pair of serpentine beings, to cram the prisoners into crude ships and sent them to the sea to certain death. Many sank with the ships, but a small number of survivors drifted to the south and settled down. In addition to the problem of the curse the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Sea\"&gt;Northern Sea&lt;/a&gt; became terrorized by the &lt;a href=\"Varangian%20Sailor\"&gt;Varangians&lt;/a&gt;, a group of sea-faring marine warriors.. These sailors used &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Bow\"&gt;Sea Bow&lt;/a&gt;s with extended range to hunt down from afar the sea beasts were they travelled. The king launched a campaign to capture the Varangian pirates, but rather than imprison them, forced them into hard labor at &lt;a href=\"No-man%27s%20Wharf\"&gt;No-man's Wharf&lt;/a&gt; where they worked to fill crude ships with the undead prisoners of the Bastille's prisons.\nEventually the kingdom of Olaphis collapsed due to the curse turning the majority of its population into undead and hollows and the mad purges of the king. However traces of its culture remained in the region through history. The Bastille became the stronghold of the &lt;a href=\"Belfry%20Luna\"&gt;kingdom of Venn&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Belfry%20Luna\"&gt;Belfry Luna&lt;/a&gt; of the princess was built, defended by &lt;a href=\"Belfry%20Gargoyles\"&gt;Belfry Gargoyles&lt;/a&gt; which imply how this new kingdom had recovered the ancient knowledge to recreate these golems together with even more ancient sorceries, while the &lt;a href=\"Belfry%20Sol\"&gt;Kingdom of Alken&lt;/a&gt; was able to recover the &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Swathe\"&gt;Flame Swathe&lt;/a&gt; pyromancy of Straid. Some of the wise men who survived the purges of the king of Olaphis and the desperate sea voyage and reached the south imparted their knowledge about sorcery and pyromancy to the land where they ended up. &lt;a href=\"Olenford\"&gt;Olenford&lt;/a&gt; in particular became revered as the father of sorcery in the country that they would help found and that would became known by the name of &lt;a href=\"Melfia\"&gt;Melfia&lt;/a&gt;, thus inheriting the magic knowledge from Olaphis. Much later &lt;a href=\"Vendrick\"&gt;King Vendrick&lt;/a&gt; and his brother &lt;a href=\"Aldia%2C%20Scholar%20of%20the%20First%20Sin\"&gt;Aldia&lt;/a&gt; conducted research on Olaphis, managing to rediscover Straid's sorceries like &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Bolt\"&gt;Soul Bolt&lt;/a&gt;."}

It resides in a large chamber surrounded by the corpses of &lt;a href=\"Capra%20Demon\"&gt;Capra Demon&lt;/a&gt;s , &lt;a href=\"Stray%20Demon\"&gt;Stray Demon&lt;/a&gt;s and a &lt;a href=\"Centipede%20Demon\"&gt;Centipede Demon&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation.\nFound in the &lt;a href=\"Smouldering%20Lake\"&gt;Smouldering Lake&lt;/a&gt;, in a chamber past the &lt;a href=\"Carthus%20Sand%20Worm\"&gt;Carthus Sand Worm&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nThe Old Demon King was one of the many &lt;a href=\"Demon%20%28lore%29\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; born from the &lt;a href=\"Flame%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Chaos Flame&lt;/a&gt;, and according to its soul's description, was the last remaining demon to have been alive before the Chaos of Izalith was extinguished, making it one of the oldest living beings in existence by the time of Dark Souls 3. After the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, the line of demons began to decline with no means of maintaining it. In spite of this mass extinction, the Demon King persisted until the events of Dark Souls 3, along with the Demon in Pain and Demon from Below (one of which will be reborn as the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Prince\"&gt;Demon Prince&lt;/a&gt; before ultimately dying). With the Chaos Flame extinguished, it has slowly withered away. When the King's health falls low enough, its inner fire will extinguish and it will kneel over helplessly, gasping and exhausted, perhaps hinting at its truly ancient age.\nStrategy.\nThe Old Demon King is a relatively straightforward opponent with a slow and well-telegraphed moveset. It will alternate between melee swings of its &lt;a href=\"Old%20King%27s%20Great%20Hammer\"&gt;great hammer&lt;/a&gt; or breathing a cone of fire directly in front of it, both attacks can be evaded by moving behind the boss. The player should beware of its flame wave attack which will create a ring of fire that travels inward towards the demon, sprinting away from the boss is recommended rather than trying to evade through the ring as it will often stagger the player out of invincibility frames.\nThe Old Demon King will often ignite itself in flames, adding fire damage to its melee attacks. Luring the boss into the small water pools around the area will extinguish its flames although it will attempt to reignite itself shortly afterwards. The mounds of demon corpses littering the area can be used to hide from the boss in order to use items although they will not block the flame wave. \nIf the boss begins to wave its hammer, it will summon a meteor shower. Again the corpse piles will block against the meteors although it is advisable to focus the camera above the player in order to track them. It can be staggered out of this attack although it is safer to take cover. \nWhen the Old Demon's King's vitality is below 20%, it will collapse and start charging one final AOE blast. This feint is designed to lure the player close to it at which point it will release a large explosion, dealing a large amount of damage. This attack will permanently extinguish the king's flames and cripple it for the remainder of the fight, forcing it to slowly drag itself towards the player and a single hammer swing. As long as the player can survive the AOE blast, finishing off the boss should not be a challenge.\nSummons.\n&lt;a href=\"Great%20Swamp%20Cuculus\"&gt;Great Swamp Cuculus&lt;/a&gt;: Her summon sign can be found near the staircase leading to the boss arena.\n&lt;a href=\"Knight%20Slayer%20Tsorig\"&gt;Knight Slayer Tsorig&lt;/a&gt;: If the player defeated Tsorig as a Dark Spirit in the &lt;a href=\"Catacombs%20of%20Carthus\"&gt;Catacombs of Carthus&lt;/a&gt;, he can be summoned to help with this boss fight. His summon sign can be found near the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Ruins%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Demon Ruins&lt;/a&gt; Bonfire (Defeating him again in the &lt;a href=\"Smouldering%20Lake\"&gt;Smouldering Lake&lt;/a&gt; does not negate this).\nDrops"}

He is opposite to the &lt;a href=\"Dragonrider\"&gt;Dragonrider&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0is accessible after raising the lever to lower the drawbridge.\nIn \"\", a &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Dragon\"&gt;Guardian Dragon&lt;/a&gt; is present on the platform which has to be killed in order to lower the bridge.\nDescription.\nThe Old Dragonslayer's appearance and moveset is nearly identical to &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Slayer%20Ornstein\"&gt;Dragon Slayer Ornstein's&lt;/a&gt; with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;dark&lt;/a&gt; magic attacks, as well as his armor being black instead of golden.\nLore.\nThe Old Dragonslayer is a mysterious figure with little to no available information on him. It is unknown if this is the same Dragonslayer encountered in &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\", or perhaps an imposter using Ornstein's influence and equipment, or something else entirely. \nSummoning.\n&lt;a href=\"Masterless%20Glencour\"&gt;Masterless Glencour&lt;/a&gt; can be summoned from a ledge just to the right of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonrider\"&gt;Dragonrider's&lt;/a&gt; arena. A fearless tank knight wielding a greatsword and a shield, Glencour will immediately rush the Old Dragonslayer after stepping through the fog gate, and continue to distract and inflict moderate damage throughout the battle, making him an invaluable ally to those having trouble conquering the Old Dragonslayer in a one-on-one situation.\u00a0\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Scholar%20of%20the%20First%20Sin\"&gt;Scholar of the First Sin&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Devotee%20Scarlett\"&gt;Devotee Scarlett&lt;/a&gt; can be found at the bottom of the stairs leading up to the spear-wielding Heide Knight and the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Dragon\"&gt;Guardian Dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0\nStrategy.\nThe fight is very similar to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Slayer%20Ornstein%20and%20Executioner%20Smough\"&gt;Dragonslayer Ornstein and Executioner Smough&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0battle\u00a0without &lt;a href=\"Executioner%20Smough\"&gt;Smough&lt;/a&gt;. There are slight differences in how the Old Dragonslayer fights compared to &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Slayer%20Ornstein\"&gt;Ornstein&lt;/a&gt;. An example would be that the\u00a0Old Dragonslayer uses a dark magic attack, while &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Slayer%20Ornstein\"&gt;Ornstein&lt;/a&gt; uses &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, Old Dragonslayer has the same sort of movement and similar attack patterns as Ornstein in the original \"Dark Souls\" should the player slay Executioner Smough first. If one takes his time fighting him, he will shoot three dark magic orbs at the player from the tip of his spear.\nBlocking until the Dragonslayer misses an attack may prove to be beneficial to the player, as well as backing away when he begins to cast his magic attack. Using a bow or crossbow may result in being able to stun-lock him by shooting him in the head. The Old Dragonslayer is weak to magic and is also vulnerable to lightning-based attacks. Sorceries can work out to be a viable tactic, if the player is able to anticipate his movements. Magical augmentations work very well against him.\nJust as &lt;a href=\"The%20Pursuer\"&gt;The Pursuer&lt;/a&gt;'s cursing lunge is unblockable, so is the Old Dragonslayer's dark impaling lunge. It is predictable, and has some starting lag, so evasion is paramount to not suffering the massive damage of this move.\nOne highly effective strategy is strafing counterclockwise (player's right), as most of his attacks come from his right, making it especially hard to hit the player. It is possible to not have to block using this.\nDefenses.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 Old Dragonslayer by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGmdjm3jKRQ&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

He takes the form of a giant horned and winged monster, with rivulets of iron pouring from its body. The closest bonfire is near turtles and called\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Eygil%27s%20Idol\"&gt;Eygil's Idol&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0\nLore.\nThe King of an ancient kingdom once ruled from the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Keep\"&gt;Iron Keep&lt;/a&gt;, an impenetrable fortress made out of solid iron. He was obsessed with creating an indomitable empire that would last for centuries, but his wishes of longevity and impregnability would eventually lead to his downfall as his beloved castle began to sink into the earth and molten iron began to melt the walls, eventually consuming his kingdom. He was believed to have been killed by the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Smelter%20Demon\"&gt;Smelter Demon&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and his soul possessed by the great evil that lurked in the flames.\nThe Old Iron King began his days as a little-known and unestablished lord, with a lust for power and glory. He was approached by\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Sir%20Alonne\"&gt;Sir Alonne&lt;/a&gt;, a great warrior from the east, who trained the King's soldiers and helped him forge a kingdom for himself from the old Kingdom of Venn. Doing so cost the Iron King what little resources he had, but in the process, he discovered an iron-producing miracle, which allowed him to freely shape and harness the powers of iron. With this new power, the Old Iron King became extremely wealthy and powerful, forging from iron both his entire castle, the &lt;a href=\"Ironclad%20Soldier\"&gt;Ironclads&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Smelter%20Demon\"&gt;Smelter Demon&lt;/a&gt;. The King also entertained various craftsmen and savants from many lands, most of whom were charlatans, but many still brought innovations for his kingdom, such as the artisan who crafted the weapon of his Alonne Knigths and Magus &lt;a href=\"Eygil\"&gt;Eygil&lt;/a&gt;, a pyromancer who wanted to breath life into fire. At the height of his power, the Iron King was known for his arrogance and indulgency in hedonism, mining so intensely parts of his kingdom that poison leaked from the earth, It was at this moment that Sir Alonne left the king's service and set of to unknown lands. At some point, the Old Iron Kingdom was afflicted by the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20the%20Undead\"&gt;Curse of the Undead&lt;/a&gt;. The Old Iron King imprisoned the undead in the &lt;a href=\"Huntsman%27s%20Copse\"&gt;Huntsman's Copse&lt;/a&gt;, torturing them and personally presiding over so-called \"undead hunts\" with his best men, as well as creating the &lt;a href=\"Executioner%27s%20Chariot\"&gt;Executioner's Chariot&lt;/a&gt; to torture the undead eternally.\nThe Old Iron King's rule would eventually end when the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Keep\"&gt;Iron Keep&lt;/a&gt; sunk to the ground due to its immense weight as lava and fire flowed from the ground. The King was struck down by the &lt;a href=\"Smelter%20Demon\"&gt;Smelter Demon&lt;/a&gt; and consumed by the flames as his soul was possessed by the evil that lurked below them and his body then became molten earth.\nFight overview.\nThe fight is very simple and is similar to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ceaseless%20Discharge\"&gt;Ceaseless Discharge&lt;/a&gt; from the original \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\". The main difference being the absence of any easy trick to defeat the King.\nThe player has little room to maneuver around the area, and may walk off or be thrown off the edge, causing an instant death. Due to his well-telegraphed attacks and long recovery times, there will be many openings for both healing and dealing damage. This means that the small area often becomes the main obstacle in this fight.\nStrategy.\nAll of the Old Iron King's attacks should be dodged, since being hit by them can be devastating and there's a possibility of being knocked off the edge, into an instant death.\nThere is a small area in the rightmost portion of the stage where one can go to avoid his sweeping flame breath if the player is not confident with &lt;a href=\"rolling\"&gt;rolling&lt;/a&gt;. Ranged characters can also set up there, if another player can draw aggro from them. Be careful, though, as the structure does not block the beam the Old Iron King fires from his right hand. Standing there for too long will also prompt the King to dive below the surface, emerging close to the player's position. The King will attempt to surface as close to the player as possible, preferably from behind the back. This can be manipulated to force surfacing in a particular location by running there immediately after the dive and facing away from the direction you would like him to surface.\nOne must be cautious of the hole right next to the entrance, as it's possible to get knocked into it and die.\nThe best time to land high damage is when the &lt;a href=\"Boss%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0slams his fist(s) into the ground and when he is using a flame attack. It is more difficult for pure melee players to hit the Old Iron King during a fire attack, but it is possible nonetheless. Damaging his horns seem to do extra damage as well and if the player can they should attack his hand while he is breathing fire.\nPlayers would do well to take their time with this boss. One should not attempt to rush the battle and waste &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; before it is needed. Most of the Old Iron King's projected attacks drain high amounts of stamina, usually not allowing a player to stand more than one instance of an attack while blocking.\nAttacks.\nSwipe: Swipes one of his arms across the arena, sometimes followed up by an overhead slam or another swipe with the opposite arm. Can be avoided by rolling towards it.\nSlam: Performs an overhead slam, sometimes done with both hands, sometimes followed by another slam or a swipe. Can be avoided with a well-timed roll, or by sprinting left or right.\nDive: The Old Iron King dives into the molten iron, splashing some of it onto the arena in the process. After a short time, he will re-emerge in a different location, splashing additional iron onto the arena.\nLaser: Charges his right hand with a fiery glow and shoots out a laser-like beam of &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;. Goes through walls. Can be avoided by sprinting left or right, or by rolling with good timing.\nFiery overhead slam: Similar to the slam, the King performs an overhead slam, but will charge his hands with fire before smashing down onto the arena, causing pillars of fire to erupt from his hands. Should be avoided by sprinting away, as simply rolling may lead to players being hit with the fire.\nFlame Breath: Shoots a line of fire out of his mouth. Can be rolled through, or side-stepped.\nSwiping Flames: Shoots flames out of mouth in a wide arc. Can be avoided by rolling, or by keeping a safe distance away from the King. Alternatively, it is possible to walk in between the flames, although it can be very difficult to do.\nRoar: Lets out a roar that releases a medium range &lt;a href=\"area%20of%20effect\"&gt;area of effect&lt;/a&gt; explosion, similar to &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Gods%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Wrath of the Gods&lt;/a&gt;. Usually only done if a player gets\u00a0extremely close.\nDefenses.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense.\n-20% strike means taking 120% damage.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 Old Iron King by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O49pVfTZHlM&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

They are similar in appearance to the &lt;a href=\"Ironclad%20Soldier\"&gt;Ironclad Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s found in the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Keep\"&gt;Iron Keep&lt;/a&gt;, but the armor is far more worn and almost completely covered in moss. A series of layered metal plates on their backs resembles a tortoise's shell.\nStrategy.\nOld Ironclad Soldiers are slow moving, but heavy hitting. They behave almost identically to the &lt;a href=\"Ironclad%20Soldier\"&gt;Ironclad Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s, although they are weaker. As such, any strategy that works against Old Ironclad Soldiers can likely be used against Ironclad Soldiers, and vice versa.\nA simple, but somewhat risky, strategy would be to circle around the Ironclad Soldier and face its back to bait it into doing a body slam, then immediately dodge it. This will give the player ample time to attack the Ironclad while it struggles to stand back up.\nEvading is often more effective than blocking, as it's impossible to block the overhead smash and the immense stamina-drain from blocking the other attacks, especially since they're often encountered at a low level.\nStrike damage\u00a0is also very effective. The player can wait for the Ironclad Soldier to attack, deal a heavy strike, roll back to avoid the potential follow-up attack and repeat.\nThey are susceptible to ranged attacks. Especially &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;sorceries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Miracles%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, retaining a safe distance while attacking it is a viable strategy. Players using this strategy should be careful, however, as the overhead smash can close the gap surprisingly quickly.\nAnother strategy is to bait it into attacking, then backing up to avoid its attack, get one hit (because it recovers quite quickly) and then roll backward to dodge the follow-up attack. This is especially effective while using a sword, axe, or other weapon with medium speed and good damage with two hands. Not recommended for small weapons like the dagger due to low damage output, although still possible. Large weapons like ultra greatswords or halberds are a not recommended because even if you get a hit, you will not be able to dodge the next strike. Plenty of room is a necessity and make sure it is a one on one fight.\nAttacks.\nSmash!: Performs an overhead smash. The mace is often held over their head while they run at the player, if they are far enough away. Slows the player's movement momentarily if they are near the point of impact. Unblockable.\nSwing: Performs a broad swing with the mace.\nMace Combo: Performs a four swing combo. The fourth swing is slightly delayed compared to the initial three.\nBody Slam: If the player attempts to attack an Ironclad Soldier from behind, it will always perform a body slam by falling on its back. Deals extremely high &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; damage and is unblockable, but leaves the enemy open if the attack is avoided.\nBackstab: Very rarely, performs a sidekick to the player's shin then transitions to an overhead slam to the player's back.

They wear the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Knight%20Set\"&gt;Old Knight Set&lt;/a&gt; and wield either an &lt;a href=\"Old%20Knight%20Greatsword\"&gt;Old Knight Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Old%20Knight%27s%20Shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;, or two-hand an &lt;a href=\"Old%20Knight%20Ultra%20Greatsword\"&gt;Old Knight Ultra Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, a unique non-respawning knight wielding an &lt;a href=\"Old%20Knight%20Hammer\"&gt;Old Knight Hammer&lt;/a&gt; can be encountered, dropping one\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Sublime%20Bone%20Dust\"&gt;Sublime Bone Dust&lt;/a&gt; when defeated.\nIn \"\", two great hammer-wielding knights appear instead, one in the same location and the other guarding the fog door to the &lt;a href=\"Dragonrider\"&gt;Dragonrider&lt;/a&gt; boss arena. Unlike the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;original game&lt;/a&gt;, this time they respawn and have random drops.\nStrategy.\nOld Knights can inflict heavy &lt;a href=\"Physical%20Damage\"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; damage with their wide reaching combo attacks. They are often encountered in groups near sections without barriers, leading to a swift demise if one should be sent flying by one of their strong attacks. Old Knights will pursue players looking to flee all the way up to the start of the level or the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Blue\"&gt;Cathedral of Blue&lt;/a&gt; entrance.\u00a0\nSince their attacks are very slow, they can be defeated by strafing around or rolling behind them. They are especially vulnerable after their three-hit combo, but be careful as some will use their quick stab attack immediately after.\nDue to their heavy armor, Old Knights are vulnerable to &lt;a href=\"Strike%20%28Damage%20Type%29\"&gt;strike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; attacks.\nOne can avoid taking damage from the greatsword and shield variant by standing extremely close to them.\nPlayers should be careful when engaging the great hammer-wielding variant, as they usually attack with wide horizontal swings in quick succession and can chain combos quickly. They also have very good tracking, allowing them to hit enemies standing behind them at the end of a combo. Their movements are also a bit deceptive, oftentimes tricking the player into thinking they are about to attack while they are actually just recovering from a combo. Staying very close to them and strafing to the left will allow melee players to evade most attacks. They are vulnerable after they finish smashing their great hammers on the ground.\nAttacks.\nGreatsword and Shield (740 HP / 400 souls)\nUltra Greatsword (550 HP / 400 souls)\nGreat Hammer (860 HP / 400 souls)"}

While its counterpart has a total of 60 durability and a base damage of 125, the Old Mirrah Greatsword has a durability of 20 and a base damage of 110. The lower durability significantly reduces its effectiveness in PvE if &lt;a href=\"Repair%20Powder%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;proper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bracing%20Knuckle%20Ring\"&gt;actions&lt;/a&gt; are not taken during the journey, thus making the Mirrah Greatsword a better choice for this situation.\nLike the Mirrah Greatsword, it upgrades with regular &lt;a href=\"Titanite%20Shard%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;titanite&lt;/a&gt;.

In terms of damage, the Mirrah Greatsword will still outclass the older variant, unless one has a large pool of Dexterity, but the former catches up quickly due to its higher base damage."}

It can be released at any time, performing a crosswise horizontal slash like &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Greatsword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Soul Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; while also unleashing a moonlight wave like the &lt;a href=\"Moonlight%20Greatsword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Moonlight Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"FP\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt; is only consumed upon releasing the attack, and the caster can move slowly with the sword at the ready or &lt;a href=\"roll\"&gt;roll&lt;/a&gt; to cancel it. The spell is made up of two components, the Moonlight Sword and the moonlight wave; the Moonlight Sword inflicts 1.25 times the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Buff\"&gt;Spell Buff&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Catalysts%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;catalyst&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; damage, while the moonlight wave deals 1.5 times the Spell Buff of the catalyst as Magic damage.\nIf the spell is held for 2 seconds, the sword is charged with moonlight, increasing the damage dealt by the wave by 57%, causing it to inflict 2.35 times the Spell Buff of the wielded catalyst as Magic damage. The damage dealt by the sword itself is not affected by charging it. A charged beam deals damage comparable to &lt;a href=\"Great%20Heavy%20Soul%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Great Heavy Soul Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, and will out-damage even &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Soul%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Crystal Soul Spear&lt;/a&gt; if both the sword and the charged beam connect on the same target.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Official translation=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

If two or more stats are tied for lowest stat, only one of those stats will contribute to the scaling.\nIn short, if a player has very good and balanced levels across all skills, then it is preferable to use this infusion over Raw, as &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Stone\"&gt;Raw&lt;/a&gt; simply increases the base stat by a small amount, while &lt;a href=\"Mundane\"&gt;Mundane&lt;/a&gt; may increase the values of a weapon exponentially.

According to &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Shalquoir\"&gt;Sweet Shalquoir&lt;/a&gt;, the Old Ones are said to be so ancient that even their names have been forgotten, while &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Herald\"&gt;Shanalotte&lt;/a&gt; refers to their names as unutterable. \nWhile the Old Ones are scarcely remembered, their Great Souls are always reborn into new forms at the beginning of each cycle. Despite not being as powerful as they once were, the Great Souls are still able to influence the land around them and the ones that possess them, thought to what extent and if done so consciously remains unknown.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Chancellor%20Wellager\"&gt;Wellager&lt;/a&gt;, King &lt;a href=\"Vendrick\"&gt;Vendrick&lt;/a&gt; once defeated the four wielders of the Great Souls of his time, and used their power to build the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt;, and to peer into the very essence of the soul.\nThe four current owners of the Great Souls as of the &lt;a href=\"Bearer%20of%20the%20Curse\"&gt;Bearer of the Curse&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s arrival in Drangleic are the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Iron%20King\"&gt;Old Iron King&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Sinner\"&gt;Lost Sinner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Rotten\"&gt;The Rotten&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Duke%27s%20Dear%20Freja\"&gt;The Duke's Dear Freja&lt;/a&gt;. The Emerald Herald instructs the Bearer of the Curse to acquire the Great Souls to gain their power and use them as a beacon to reach Vendrick. \nLord Souls.\nThe Great Souls are believed to be &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Soul\"&gt;Lord Souls&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\", which is heavily implied by their names. Henceforth, that makes the Old Ones and the main bosses from Dark Souls one and the same.\nIt is also noticiable that each of the current possessors of a Great Soul has a story that draws a parallel to the original owner of their Lord Soul.\nOld Iron King - Gwyn.\nThe Old Iron King, wielder of the Old King Soul, after being killed by the &lt;a href=\"Smelter%20Demon\"&gt;Smelter Demon&lt;/a&gt;, was said to have succumbed to the flames and had his flesh charred, which became molten earth. This is a reference to how &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Cinder&lt;/a&gt; hurled himself into the First Flame to link the fire and prolong the Age of Fire, additionally, &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Shalquoir\"&gt;Sweet Shalquoir&lt;/a&gt; refers to the Old Iron King as \"A vainglorious liar who ended up hurling himself into the flames\" which makes a perfect pararel to Gwyn's linking of the fire. \nAccording to his &lt;a href=\"Old%20Iron%20King%20Soul\"&gt;Soul&lt;/a&gt;, when the Old Iron King succumbed to the flames, he was possessed \u201cby a evil that lurked below\u201d. This is likely how he acquired his Great Soul and the reason for his transformation into his current state. \nSecond playthroughs and onward cause the Old Iron King to drop the &lt;a href=\"Old%20King%20Soul\"&gt;Old King Soul&lt;/a&gt; upon defeat. \nThe Lost Sinner - Witch of Izalith.\nThe Lost Sinner, wielder of the Old Witch Soul, is said to have attempted to light the First Flame, and is burdened by her past misdeeds. In the same manner, the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Witch of Izalith&lt;/a&gt; attempted to recreate the First Flame using her Lord Soul, but instead created the &lt;a href=\"Flame%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Flame of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;. Other correlations that can be pointed are the creature similar to a &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Bug\"&gt;Chaos Bug&lt;/a&gt; seen crawling into the eyehole of the Lost Sinner\u2019s mask, her &lt;a href=\"Penal%20Handcuffs\"&gt;Handcuffs&lt;/a&gt; having the power to augment pyromancy and the phantoms of Pyromancers that aid her in battle in NG+.\nIt is believed that the Lost Sinner comes from &lt;a href=\"Eleum%20Loyce\"&gt;Eleum Loyce&lt;/a&gt;, a land threatened by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Chaos\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt;. Which could explain how she came into possession of her Great Soul and the Chaos Bug-like insect crawling on her.\nSecond Playthroughs and onward will cause the Lost Sinner to drop the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Witch%20Soul\"&gt;Old Witch Soul&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Rotten - Nito.\nThe Rotten, wielder of the Old Dead One Soul, is composed of the bodies of numerous Undead. This is similar to the manner in which &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Nito\"&gt;Gravelord Nito&lt;/a&gt; is composed of numerous skeletons. Both of them also reside in the deep underground surrounded by decay and darkness. \nDue to the unnatural origins of the Rotten and his unclear identity, it\u2019s unknown how he, or the undead on his shoulder that appears to command him, acquired his Great Soul, but it is fair to assume that his Great Soul may be the only reason why such a creature came to be in the first place.\nUpon defeat from NG+ onward, he drops the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Dead%20One%20Soul\"&gt;Old Dead One Soul&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Duke's Dear Freja - Seath.\nFreja is an exception among the bosses, for she does not own a Great Soul, being merely the keeper of one. The Great Soul is found behind her close to the web resembling the Primordial Crystal. The true owner of the Old Paledrake Soul is the entity possesing Freja, know as the \u201cWrithing Ruin\u201d.\nThe Writhing Ruin is described as an ancient entity whose influence in &lt;a href=\"Brightstone%20Cove%20Tseldora\"&gt;Brightstone Cove Tseldora&lt;/a&gt; made the inhabitants be consumed in the search for \u201cthat which they lacked\u201d. Furthermore, &lt;a href=\"Manscorpion%20Tark\"&gt;Manscorpion Tark&lt;/a&gt;, who congratulates the player for \u201cdefeating his master\u201d after Freja is killed (referring to the Writhing Ruin possesing her) describes his master as a being \u201cborn with a fatal flaw, hateful of those that had what he lacked, creator of strange creatures and eroded by solitude and madness\". This is a perfect definition of &lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;Seath the Scaleless&lt;/a&gt; search for immortality. Other correlations are &lt;a href=\"Scorpioness%20Najka\"&gt;Scorpioness Najka&lt;/a&gt;, who has the same creator of Tark, being able to use sorceries, the same crystal theme aesthetic both the Writhing Ruin and Seath have and that the word \u201cWrithing\u201d means a squirming cortorcion similar to the movements of tentacles.\nHowever, Tark elaborates that his master never dies, only changes form over time and Sweet Shalquoir recalls \u201cthat awful traitor long ago who coveted what he did not have \u2026The Writhing Ruin keeps searching as we speak\u201d, this all heavily implies that the Writhing Ruin actually is Seath himself.\nThe Duke's Dear Freja, from NG+ onward, drops the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Paledrake%20Soul\"&gt;Old Paledrake Soul&lt;/a&gt;."}

It also boasts the highest base damage of all Whip-class weapons. However, its attacks are linear in tracking, meaning that all attacks can be evaded by nimble opponents. It also has the lowest durability of all whips, and is the second &lt;a href=\"Weight\"&gt;heaviest&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is the only weapon in the game to boost damage inflicted upon &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;Hollow&lt;/a&gt; opponents.\nOn top of its remarkably low &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;, the Old Whip will degrade at an alarming rate compared to most other weapons. This can lead to the point that one may only be able to use it against a handful of foes before the whip is at risk of breaking. As such, it is recommended to use &lt;a href=\"Repair%20Powder%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Repair Powder&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bracing%20Knuckle%20Ring\"&gt;Bracing Knuckle Ring&lt;/a&gt; to minimize this issue."}

As the off-hand blade is only slightly longer than most &lt;a href=\"Daggers%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;daggers&lt;/a&gt;, utilizing the paired attacks requires the player to get extremely close to the target, otherwise the short blade will miss entirely, greatly reducing the weapon's damage output.\nHowever, what truly makes Onikiri and Ubadachi shine is its &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Onislayer\"&gt;Onislayer&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "140227", "revid": "33084951", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=140227", "title": "Onislayer", "text": "Onislayer is a &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\nThe user jumps into the air, lingers for a brief moment and then slashes forward, attacking with both swords dealing moderate damage and staggering any targets hit.\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nThis skill is generally useful for staggering strong foes that have little standing &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;, and then following up with further attack combos. \nOnline gameplay.\nA small amount of stagger is inflicted upon jumping, if the other player is at point-blank range, locking them in place to be hit by the slash. As well, this attack has a small amount of &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt;, allowing it to resist individual attacks by smaller weapons and thus prevail in a trade. This makes Onislayer a strong skill at combatting foes wielding weapons such as &lt;a href=\"Straight%20Swords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;straight swords&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Curved%20Swords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;curved swords&lt;/a&gt;, as it can poise through their attacks and then stagger them for further follow-up attacks.\nHowever, because of the lingering delay, this skill is very easy to punish if proper spacing is not observed, as it has a long recovery that allows the wielder to be easily backstabbed if it misses. As well, its low Poise health does not protect it against the immense Poise damage that larger weapons are capable of, meaning that the wielder can literally be swatted out of the sky by an &lt;a href=\"Ultra%20Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;ultra greatsword&lt;/a&gt;, or set up to lose a trade with a &lt;a href=\"Stomp\"&gt;Stomp&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, the increased effective range of Onislayer Greatarrows allows them to retain their damage when firing at targets that are farther away. In situations where damage falloff and travel arc can result in decreased damage (as well as reduced accuracy) when using normal greatarrows, the Onislayer Greatarrow can still deal respectable damage to its target while still offering a fair chance at a headshot for critical damage. As well, the arrow's higher speed allows it to be used to good effect against moving targets, as the lessened travel time makes target tracking easier.\nThe other drawback to Onislayer Greatarrows, besides their reduced base damage and smaller quiver size (players may only carry 30 Onislayer Greatarrows, as opposed to 50 Dragonslayer Greatarrows), is that they are incapable of knocking down targets, save for certain enemies on headshots. In situations where targets are positioned near cliff edges, an Onislayer Greatarrow may deal respectable damage, but is less capable of knocking the enemy off of ledges in order to deal potentially fatal fall damage."}

It is also 2.5 units lighter than the &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Greatbow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dragonslayer Greatbow&lt;/a&gt;, and only 1 unit heavier than the &lt;a href=\"Dragonrider%20Bow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dragonrider Bow&lt;/a&gt;, allowing characters with low &lt;a href=\"Vitality%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt; to carry it without much issue.

This can be very useful in situations where an enemy's distance would reduce the accuracy and striking power of other bows, moreso when lining up headshots for increased damage.\nAlthough it does not require a securing spike, the Onislayer Greatbow is still incapable of moving after nocking a greatarrow. However, unlike the Dragonslayer Greatbow it also does not generate recoil that pushes the wielder backward with each greatarrow loosed, allowing players to remain stationary for unleashing steady barrages.\nUpgrades.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

She was worshiped by the humans as the \"&lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;goddess of sin&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAs the deity of sin, Velka's focus is on humans and her job is to define sins and mete out the associated punishments, overseeing the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20the%20Guilty\"&gt;list of the guilty&lt;/a&gt; who have disrespected the gods or their covenants. However, for her there is not only punishment for men and in fact the deity sends her \"&lt;a href=\"Oswald%20of%20Carim\"&gt;pardoners&lt;/a&gt;\" among them. These clerics are tasked with hearing the confessions of sinners, urging reflection, and offering salvation from the vengeance of the gods. These pardoners wear a &lt;a href=\"Mask%20of%20Velka\"&gt;mask&lt;/a&gt; that symbolizes their detachment from worldly desires and a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Set\"&gt;uniformly black attire&lt;/a&gt; that is imbued with the mystical power of Velka and protects them from any kind of magic. These clerics are also inhuman swordsmen and possess &lt;a href=\"Velka%27s%20Rapier\"&gt;enchanted blades&lt;/a&gt; that deal dark damage.\nHowever, Velka is such a peculiar deity that she is addressed as a \"witch\" and \"heretic deity\", indicating how, although she continues to be part of the faith of the gods of Anor Londo, her ideas and practices deviate from dominant tenets. In fact, she performs &lt;a href=\"Vow%20of%20Silence\"&gt;secret rituals&lt;/a&gt; capable of denying magic in the area, there are sacrificial rituals in her name to create &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Sacrifice\"&gt;mystical rings&lt;/a&gt; and in addition the &lt;a href=\"Velka%27s%20Talisman\"&gt;talismans&lt;/a&gt; created with her hair are used to cast miracles drawing not upon faith but intelligence, implying that the goddess favor this among her followers. Velka despite this possesses a great range of influence in the world of men and even that of gods and is versed in arts both new and old, implying her interest in the most recent sorceries.\nAt some point after Gwyn linked the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Nameless%20King\"&gt;Gwyn's firstborn son&lt;/a&gt; was dethroned and exiled , she abandoned Anor Londo together with nearly all of the other deities and moved to an unknown location, however she would continue to collaborate with &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Dark Sun Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Darkmoon\"&gt;Blade of the Darkmoon&lt;/a&gt; covenant, knights tasked with the hunting and punishing of those who committed sins against the gods to inspire fear and respect for them between the humans. The Goddess of Sin would thus determine the sin and mark the sinners on her &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20the%20Guilty\"&gt;Book of the Guilty&lt;/a&gt; so that one day they would face the wrath of the blades of the darkmoon as Gwyndolin's followers would cut off an &lt;a href=\"Souvenir%20of%20Reprisal\"&gt;ear from the corps of the sinners&lt;/a&gt; they vanquished, bringing them to their god as proof of their task accomplished\nAs she was the Goddess of Sin, Velka would eventually spread her influence inside the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariamis\"&gt;Painted World of Ariamis&lt;/a&gt;, an artifact that the gods used as a safe to seal away &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ember\"&gt;dangerous artifacts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Engorged%20Hollow\"&gt;abominations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crow%20Demon\"&gt;sinners&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;Hollow&lt;/a&gt;s, as several of her &lt;a href=\"Velka%27s%20Rapier\"&gt;artifacts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vow%20of%20Silence\"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt; can be found inside of it. In addition, dozens of &lt;a href=\"Crow%20Demon\"&gt;her cultist followers&lt;/a&gt;, humans whose appearance was twisted to that of corvids, found refuge there and potentially endeavored to protect &lt;a href=\"Crossbreed%20Priscilla\"&gt;Crossbreed Priscilla&lt;/a&gt; from the other gods.\nVelka is able to infuse the &lt;a href=\"Velka%27s%20Rapier\"&gt;weapons of her clerics&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Occult%20%28auxiliary%20effect%29\"&gt;occult power&lt;/a&gt; and in addition in the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariamis\"&gt;Painted World of Ariamis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vow%20of%20Silence\"&gt;secret miracles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velka%27s%20Rapier\"&gt;artifacts&lt;/a&gt; associated with Velka can be found along with a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ember\"&gt;Dark Ember&lt;/a&gt; capable of creating occult weapons, implying a connection between the goddess and the dark power capable of harming the gods. At one point occult power was used to hunt the gods and their followers and some heretical cultists even went so far as to plot to destroy the gods even though they failed, the connection between the source of their dark powers and their involvement with Velka remains however uncertain.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point Velka and her followers reached &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; and began creating magical &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Clutch%20Ring\"&gt;rings&lt;/a&gt; with the shape of crow claws around a gem attuned with different elements, artifacts that remain in the region even centuries after the collapse of Vendrick's kingdom.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Brightstone%20Cove%20Tseldora\"&gt;Tseldora&lt;/a&gt; a church was even built venerating the dark goddess, represented with her &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20the%20Guilty\"&gt;Book of the Guilty&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velka%27s%20Talisman\"&gt;talisman&lt;/a&gt;. Above the building &lt;a href=\"Cromwell%20the%20Pardoner\"&gt;Cromwell&lt;/a&gt; can also be found, a man who wears the &lt;a href=\"Judgment%20Set\"&gt;robes&lt;/a&gt; of her ancient pardoners and performs the ritual function of absolving humans of their sins, offering forgiveness to anyone as long as they are sincere.\nDespite this, the purpose the robes of the pardoner served is little known and the name of the goddess has been forgotten as only the fact that sin was her domain is understood by the people of Drangleic\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point Velka and her followers reached &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt; and continued creating their magical &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Clutch%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;rings&lt;/a&gt; with the shape of crow claws around a gem attuned with different elements and and her mystical &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Sacrifice%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;rings&lt;/a&gt; created with sacrificial rites, artifacts that were spread through the entire region.\nVelka also appears to have come into contact with &lt;a href=\"Londor\"&gt;Londor&lt;/a&gt;, the realm of hollows, as the &lt;a href=\"Sable%20Church\"&gt;Sable Church&lt;/a&gt; and the three sisters who lead it have learned the goddess' &lt;a href=\"Vow%20of%20Silence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;ancient dark miracles&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore an old fable in Londor claims that the lure of her clutch rings reaches out to the crestfallen, who might otherwise be overcome by despair, implying how through these rings the goddess continues to care for the forlorns.\nA statue of Velka can also be found in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Undead Settlement&lt;/a&gt; over a grave, holding her &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20the%20Guilty\"&gt;Book of the Guilty&lt;/a&gt; and with her arm outstretched to welcome sinners.\nThe goddess was known in the village and the inhabitants addressed their prayers to her, coming to the grave to have their wrongdoings forgiven and to be cured of curses.\nThe statue is in fact capable of absolving and purifying sin, but without the need for a pardoner to act as an intermediary as in the past, simply working through prayer and the offering of souls. The statue is also capable of resetting an undead's hollowing level, without closing their eventual &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sigil\"&gt;Dark Sigil&lt;/a&gt;. However the statue and the grave are now confined to the sewer system beneath the village and no longer receive visitors."}

In order to get to him the player must pass through a long corridor with indestructible tombstones that spawn spirits. However, if you drop down from the first staircase and go under the stairway, there is a hollow there that you can kill to keep the bell from being rung and the shades will not spawn.\nHe is a large knight wielding a massive hammer, guarding the door to &lt;a href=\"Vendrick\"&gt;Vendrick&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nVelstadt was King Vendrick's right-hand man, along with &lt;a href=\"Fume%20Knight\"&gt;Raime&lt;/a&gt;, and one of his most loyal knights as well as the Commander of his forces. At some point, Velstadt and Raime quarreled, ending with Raime being declared a traitor and leaving the King's service. Velstadt would always be by his king's side and followed him to the Undead Crypt when he fled &lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Castle\"&gt;Drangleic Castle&lt;/a&gt;. Despite Vendrick's hollowed state, Velstadt remains, protecting his liege and serving as the king's last line of defense.\nSummoning.\nAfter exhausting his dialogue, &lt;a href=\"Grave%20Warden%20Agdayne\"&gt;Grave Warden Agdayne&lt;/a&gt; can be summoned. His sign is behind the second-to-last statue on the left.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Scholar%20of%20the%20First%20Sin\"&gt;Scholar of the First Sin&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Devotee%20Scarlett\"&gt;Devotee Scarlett&lt;/a&gt; can be summoned in the room with the &lt;a href=\"Leydia%20Witch\"&gt;Leydia Witch&lt;/a&gt;es, before the room with &lt;a href=\"Grave%20Warden%20Agdayne\"&gt;Grave Warden Agdayne&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nHis attacks are mostly made up of hammer strikes and occasionally some spells that are either offensive or improve his attack power. Dodging well can prove effective in this battle, as his hammer causes pretty high stamina damage and almost all of his attacks are in combos of 2-3 strikes. Be careful when behind him since he does a 180 degree turn and swings his hammer.\nWhen he has lost about a third of his health he will enter in a kneel position and will cast a self-buff for around 7 seconds. This is a good opportunity to wail on him, buff a weapon, or heal because he will not be able to interrupt the player. The buff will cause him to receive less damage and cause more damage. Once buffed, he also gains a Dark magic attack which fires several orbs in a wide angle, any of the orbs that come near the player will home in on them, however, they can be rolled through. If one of the orbs hits the player, it will likely be fatal. Ranged builds can take advantage of this, firing before and after his spells, then dodging once he casts them. Velstadt is also very vulnerable when casting this spell, as it takes several seconds to charge and the orbs do not home in on the player, meaning that a melee build could both heal and run behind Velstadt while also landing a couple of strikes on him while he is preparing. Be warned: if the player stays behind him too long after he casts the spell, he will likely use a swerving hammer swing behind him that can do a fair amount of damage.\nUsing fire damage and lightning damage is very effective for this boss, while a hex build and dark magic is not as effective, since his armor has high dark defense so magic might prove more beneficial than hexes and dark. Also while he is on knees preparing to fire his dark orb attack it is safe to hurry and get behind him for the orbs will only shoot out in a frontal cone. If you find yourself not enough time to get behind him then try your best to roll forward through the orbs he fires or stand behind a pillar that has not been broken from the mayhem yet.\nVelstadt can be parried.\nAttacks.\nOverhead Slam: Holds his weapon above his head and slams it to the ground, sometimes if the player has made some distance between him, he will charge at the player holding his weapon over his head and performing an overhead slam. He tracks fairly well, so dodging early will result in getting hit. Like many of his attacks, dodge at the last second to avoid them completely.\nLunge: Thrusts his weapon at the player. Has a deceptively long range, and can hit players who have not retreated far back enough, though it can be dodged by rolling to the side. Has a long recovery time and can provide an opportunity to heal or attack.\nDouble hit: Swings his hammer horizontally twice in a row. The back-swing can still hit the player if he/she has dodged towards his back.\nDark Buff: If the player has done high damage to him in a short amount of time, he will kneel down with his hammer and will buff himself. During the casting he will be vulnerable to attacks, though he will take decreased damage. After performing the buff, he will have increased damage and a new ranged attack. This move is also similar to &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Artorias\"&gt;Knight Artorias&lt;/a&gt;' \"Wrath of the Abyss\" buff, although it is not possible to stagger Velstadt out of this one.\nDark Orbs: While the player is at range from him, he will ring his chime twice, kneel down and perform a dark orb attack, which fires several at a time. This attack can be easily evaded by moving behind him and getting some free hits, however he will continue tracking players until a short period before firing the orbs so be sure to keep moving to stay behind him. If he backs up against a wall, the orbs can be rolled through with enough &lt;a href=\"Adaptability\"&gt;Adaptability&lt;/a&gt; or blocked by pillars.\nBack slash: While the player is behind him but at his weapon side, he will swing his hammer backwards towards the player. He gives very little tell beforehand, so this move can catch many off guard.\nTwo-Hand Swipe: Grips his hammer with two hands and performs one horizontal swipe. Can be dodged by rolling towards the swing. Will sometimes follow up with another attack if the player is within range.\nKick: Kicks the player if he/she is blocking consistently. High stamina drain if blocked.\nDefenses.\nVelstadt (prior to self buff)\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense.\n-10% strike means taking 110% damage.\nVelstadt (after self buff)\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 Velstadt, the Royal Aegis by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jVBZR74Bzk&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

He is voiced by , who also voiced &lt;a href=\"Marvelous%20Chester\"&gt;Marvelous Chester&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"Oceiros%2C%20the%20Consumed%20King\"&gt;Oceiros&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPlot.\nUpon entering the Undead Crypt and defeating Velstadt, the &lt;a href=\"Bearer%20of%20the%20Curse\"&gt;Bearer of the Curse&lt;/a&gt; encounters the king, merely a shell of his former self. They may choose to spare the king, leaving him to wander endlessly, or slay him and end his misery.\nUsing the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Mist%20Heart\"&gt;Ashen Mist Heart&lt;/a&gt;, the Bearer of the Curse may enter the &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20the%20King\"&gt;Memory of the King&lt;/a&gt;, where they may interact with King Vendrick as he was before he became hollowed. Bitter and grieving his failures, Vendrick tells the Bearer to seek the crowns of old kings of yore. Once they have brought him all the crowns, Vendrick will unlock their power, making the Bearer of the Curse immune to the hollowing effects of the curse. He advises the Bearer of the Curse to seek a third path, beyond the light and dark.\nStrategy.\nVendrick has very high defense which likely will make this a very lengthy fight. His defense can be considerably lowered, however, by collecting up to five\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Souls%20of%20a%20Giant\"&gt;Souls of a Giant&lt;/a&gt; found throughout Drangleic. Each Soul of a Giant halves his defense. Without any souls, he has 32 times his base defense and takes almost negligible damage per hit. Even with the Souls of a Giant, Vendrick is not to be taken lightly. His attacks deal heavy damage, have good reach, and can stagger players who roll too early because of the windup for each one.\nVendrick holds his sword with the blade dragging behind him even as he winds up for the horizontal slash attacks. Staying close to him and strafing to his left will make it very hard for him to hit the player. He will sometimes jump back to put distance between him and the player. If he backs up into a wall, the player may back up in an attempt to get behind him again. Keeping a good shield in your inventory can help, but not always, as most of Vendrick's attacks have extremely high stamina damage.\nA good way to approach the fight is to stay directly behind or next to his left foot.\u00a0If he gets too close to a wall where any part of the player or him is bumping into it, try to lure him back out toward the center of the arena.\nAttacks.\nSwiping: Swipes his sword across the ground two or three times in a row. This is his deadliest attack, as if it hits the player's shield it will drain all stamina and the player will then by severely damaged or killed by the following swing. Hugging his left foot while causes the attack to completely swing over the player's head, but rolling through the attacks works well too if the player learns Vendrick's moveset and timing.\nOverhead Sword Slam: Raises his sword up and slams it onto the ground, sometimes done twice or even three times in a row. Easy to dodge by staying as close to him as possible.\nJump Attack:\u00a0Will jump towards the player and slam his sword into the ground where they were standing the moment he jumped. There's a clear wind-up and it is fairly easy to dodge by moving out of the way when he gets airborne.\nSingle Sword Swing:\u00a0Will swing the sword horizontally towards the player once, it has a long reach, and a slow wind-up that is exactly the same as the swiping. Fairly easy to dodge by sprinting towards his left side.\u00a0He will also do this is the player is far away and will most likely kill them if their back is turned.\nCharge:\u00a0If the player starts really distancing themselves from Vendrick where he can not hit them with his swing, he will pick up speed. He will move much faster than his normal slow meander and will most likely catch the player off guard if they were healing or buffing their weapon. The best way to handle this is, if one has a shield, to raise it and sprint towards his left side. If one doesn't have a shield, sprint towards his left side and be prepared to roll for your life.\nCurse Orb:\u00a0Upon crossing the fog wall, Vendrick will scream and throw a dark red orb at the player, inflicting instant curse if it connects.\nDefenses.\n Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense.\nNote that the defenses are based on when the player has five &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Soul\"&gt;Giant Soul&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDrops.\nVendrick will not drop anything except the given amount of souls when he dies. However, his &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20the%20King\"&gt;Soul of the King&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Set\"&gt;armor set&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Amana\"&gt;Shrine of Amana&lt;/a&gt;, behind a door that can only be opened after defeating him. The door is in the area between the first and second hut where the player can find a pathway leading to the door, however, they must be in human form to open it.\nUsing a &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20Ascetic\"&gt;Bonfire Ascetic&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0instead of going to NG+ will not spawn these items anew in the Shrine of Amana.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 King Vendrick by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwru_WPd0Tw&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

At one point, he was a brutal and bloodthirsty warrior, but his time alone has made him pensive and kind. As he was decapitated in battle, he still wears his ornate helmet, styled in the fashion of a wolf.\nAfter defeating his body, he can be summoned as a whole against the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Dragon\"&gt;Ancient Dragon&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=\"Throne%20Watcher%20and%20Defender\"&gt;Throne Watcher and Defender&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nashandra\"&gt;Nashandra&lt;/a&gt;. In battle, his headless body wields the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Rust%20Scimitar\"&gt;Red Rust Scimitar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Rust%20Sword\"&gt;Red Rust Sword&lt;/a&gt; but his Summoning wields the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Rust%20Scimitar\"&gt;Red Rust Scimitar&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Red%20Rust%20Shield\"&gt;Red Rust Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nLong ago, Vengarl was a great warrior. Born in &lt;a href=\"Forossa\"&gt;Forossa&lt;/a&gt;, he eventually became a soldier in the army fighting for the prince of Forossa. He cites the fall of Forossa as happening during his lifetime, being born before its collapse and a kingdom which he was tasked to defend.\nWhen Forossa fell, Vengarl fled and became a mercenary. As time went on, his reputation as a vicious warrior grew. Even amongst his warrior troupe, which was noted as being especially brutal, he was avoided. During one battle, he was decapitated; instead of dying, however, he awoke after the battle was over. Ever since then, the silence of the woods has given him much time to think, and he spends all of his time doing such.\nPlot.\nUpon entering the &lt;a href=\"Shaded%20Woods\"&gt;Shaded Woods&lt;/a&gt;, the player will happen upon a shrouded portion of the forest. In one of the corners of these woods, Vengarl's head can be found resting on a pile of rubble. At first, he will reject the player, stating that he doesn't want any business with the tribulations of war, battle or adventure. After further prompting, Vengarl will eventually offer &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;mercantile services&lt;/a&gt; to the player.\nIf the player extends his dialogue, they learn that he was born in &lt;a href=\"Forossa\"&gt;Forossa&lt;/a&gt; but he had to leave when the kingdom fell. He became a sellsword, but is ashamed of thinking only of war. Vengarl says that he sometimes dreams of his body and warns the player to avoid it at all costs. He will then thank the player for listening to his ramblings and award them with his &lt;a href=\"Vengarl%27s%20Helm\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter defeating his headless body and returning to Vengarl, he will thank the player and make his weapons and shield available for purchase. He will also become an available summon for the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Dragon\"&gt;Ancient Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Throne%20Watcher%20and%20Defender\"&gt;Throne Watcher and Defender&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nashandra\"&gt;Nashandra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lud%20and%20Zallen\"&gt;Lud and Zallen&lt;/a&gt; boss battles.\nBody of Vengarl.\nVengarl's body can be found in one of two different locations depending on the version of the game. In the original game, it will be waiting by the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Bonfire\"&gt;Primal Bonfire&lt;/a&gt; after defeating &lt;a href=\"The%20Duke%27s%20Dear%20Freja\"&gt;The Duke's Dear Freja&lt;/a&gt;. But in \"\", it has been moved into the &lt;a href=\"Shaded%20Ruins\"&gt;Shaded Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, in a room just past &lt;a href=\"Manscorpion%20Tark\"&gt;Manscorpion Tark&lt;/a&gt;'s sand pit. At least one &lt;a href=\"Fragrant%20Branch%20of%20Yore\"&gt;Fragrant Branch of Yore&lt;/a&gt; is needed to access it, regardless of direction of approach.\nThe body will wield Vengarl's &lt;a href=\"Red%20Rust%20Scimitar\"&gt;scimitar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Red%20Rust%20Sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;, and can deal tremendous damage with its combos. However, it is also slow to turn, allowing players to easily get around to backstab it. Upon defeat, the body will drop &lt;a href=\"Vengarl%27s%20Set\"&gt;Vengarl's Set&lt;/a&gt; excluding the head piece, which is given to the player by Vengarl's head."}

It is equally protective against &lt;a href=\"Regular%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Standard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Slash%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Slash&lt;/a&gt; damage, is very resistant to &lt;a href=\"Thrust%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Thrust&lt;/a&gt; damage and is weakest to but still respectably absorbent of &lt;a href=\"Strike%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Strike&lt;/a&gt; damage. Overall, it can weather physical attacks very well.\nAlthough it has rather average resistances against &lt;a href=\"Negative%20Status%20Effects%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;status effects&lt;/a&gt;, its elemental defenses are hit and miss. For a plate armor set it is respectably resistant to most forms of elemental damage, and most especially against &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage, however it has a crucial chink in its &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; defenses, despite its weight. To round everything out, it has very respectable &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; to go with its weight."}

He is voiced by , who also voiced &lt;a href=\"Rickert%20of%20Vinheim\"&gt;Rickert of Vinheim&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the male &lt;a href=\"Anri%20of%20Astora\"&gt;Anri of Astora&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPlot.\nVince and &lt;a href=\"Nico%20of%20Thorolund\"&gt;Nico&lt;/a&gt; are the bodyguards of &lt;a href=\"Reah%20of%20Thorolund\"&gt;Reah of Thorolund&lt;/a&gt;. He will appear with his companions in the &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt; after the player beats the &lt;a href=\"Capra%20Demon\"&gt;Capra Demon&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Undead%20Burg\"&gt;Lower Undead Burg&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike his mumbling companion, Vince will have a brief conversation with the player. In it, he tells the player that his party are going on a quest, but reveals little more.\nIf the player does not exhaust all of his and Reah's dialogue, they will leave Firelink Shrine when the player defeats &lt;a href=\"Pinwheel\"&gt;Pinwheel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Catacombs\"&gt;The Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player next encounters Vince and Nico as &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;Hollow&lt;/a&gt;ed enemies in the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Tomb of the Giants&lt;/a&gt;, in the pit that &lt;a href=\"Patches\"&gt;Patches&lt;/a&gt; kicks them into. The player must defeat them in order to rescue Reah.\nStrategy.\nVince and Nico are pretty much straight melee fighters. They have above average &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, hit fairly hard, and the fact that they fight together may cause problems for the player. The player must also fight them in near-pitch darkness; the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20Lantern\"&gt;Skull Lantern&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Maggot\"&gt;Sunlight Maggot&lt;/a&gt; helmet, or the &lt;a href=\"Cast%20Light\"&gt;Cast Light&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;sorcery&lt;/a&gt; will greatly aid players in this aspect. Vince casts &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href=\"Force\"&gt;Force&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heal\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt;. Force can disrupt your block and drain your stamina quickly, while letting heal get out of hand can make the fight go on for ages.\nAn alternative (and far easier) way of defeating the two is to lure them to the edge of the area where bone towers spawn. From here, using the 'force' miracle multiple times will force one, if not both of them, off the map, leaving the remaining one to be dealt with relative ease."}

The school's name is possibly derived from the great albino dragon, &lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;Seath the Scaleless&lt;/a&gt;, said to be the grandfather of sorcery.\nThe school contained various faculties, each specializing in its own field. Some sorcerers studied in magical blacksmithing.\u00a0These smiths only worked with high quality embers relating to magic, and rarely dealt in other types. Other sorcerers secretly worked with sound-based spells, and were known to never reveal themselves. Shadowy agents from the school were also available for hire, but were generally very expensive due to the nature of the spells they used. The magic swordsmen of Vinheim were another group, who specialized in spells that magically augmented their sword and shield. Magic swordsmen on special orders were granted access to powerful variants of spells to augment their greatshields.\nApprentices of the Vinheim Dragon School were considered full sorcerers once they acquired the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Soul%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Great Soul Arrow&lt;/a&gt; spell. The most accomplished sorcerers were granted powerful rings that bolstered their magical abilities. Some of these rings have been uncovered centuries later, and passed onto new owners. &lt;a href=\"Big%20Hat%20Logan\"&gt;Big Hat Logan&lt;/a&gt; was a hugely renowned and accomplished sorcerer of Vinheim, and a royal member of Dragon School.\nMost sorcerers at the school used a standard catalyst to cast their magic, however some sorcerers, such as Big Hat Logan, were able to strengthen their catalysts over time, due to extensive usage.\nWhile Vinheim Dragon School was a renowned institution and instrumental in developing various magical spells, the more mystical and ancient sorceries prominent in the lost land of &lt;a href=\"Oolacile\"&gt;Oolacile&lt;/a&gt; were beyond them. It is believed the Vinheim Dragon School was eventually dissolved and reestablished at least a dozen times in the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord Gwyn's&lt;/a&gt; defeat by the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt;. The last known iteration of the school is thought to be the Melfian Magic Academy, in &lt;a href=\"Melfia\"&gt;Melfia&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;.\nWIP"}

It also increases one's maximum &lt;a href=\"HP%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; slightly.

Under 30%, 30% to 70%, 70% to 100%, and Over 100%.\nUnder 30% Allows the player character to fast roll a slightly longer distance than the below categories, but possesses no &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; health to prevent staggering if caught during recovery. Regular movement speed is slightly increased, though this does not affect sprinting speed.\n30% to 70% Allows the player to fast roll but slightly less distance than Under 30%, but makes up for this by granting the player 15 Poise health so that they have a chance to continue their roll if hit by small weapons during recovery. Normal movement speed is not affected in this category.\n70% to 100% Forces the player to slow or \"fat\" roll with less invincibility frames and a shorter roll distance than the previous two weight classes, as well as significantly more recovery frames. Under these conditions, the player is granted 30 Poise health which further improves the odds of completing the roll. Normal movement speed is not affected in this category. The player also incurs a -9 penalty to stamina regeneration.\nOver 100% Does not allow the player to roll at all, and forces the player to \"slow walk\" (they are unable to run or sprint). An additional -5 penalty to stamina regeneration is incurred, resulting in a total penalty of -14 points/sec.\nAs is with every other stat in the game, it also has indirect bonuses such as increasing the player character's flat damage absorption. In particular, Vitality increases the player's flat defenses in the physical categories, making them more resistant against weapon damage."}

The craftsman of the city are also highly skilled and capable of building rare and advanced devices like the &lt;a href=\"Binoculars_%28Dark_Souls_II%29\"&gt;binoculars&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, the growth of trade has also led to a high level of competitiveness among merchants, for whom it is no longer enough to be just capable businessmen but also to have a good network of connections and friends in the right places. The consequence is that new merchants who want to open their business in the city need a huge amount of money to invest before they can even open, leading new activities to find themselves in difficulty right from the start compared to those already established and connected to the authorities and creating a heavy economic and social barrier inside the city.\nThe elite of Volgen is represented by the priesthood of the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20Blue\"&gt;Way of Blue&lt;/a&gt; that hold a massive influence and is able to exercise authority over the commercial activities of the city, to the point of deciding who can and can't do business inside of it, justifying this power as charity while proably using it to extort money and accept bribes. The priests are also locked in constant and scandalous power struggles between themselves, even if, among them, there are those who don't forget their noble wills. Despite being men of faith, in addition to creating &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Prayer\"&gt;blessed rings capable of increasing faith&lt;/a&gt;, they also created &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;rings capable of increasing intellect&lt;/a&gt;, demonstrating how their interests were also outside of religious and divine matters\nVolgen's elite do not employ a regular army to defend the city as the locals are considered weak soldiers. Instead they hire mercenary groups like the &lt;a href=\"Falconer\"&gt;Falconer&lt;/a&gt;s, a group of sellswords affiliated with the cult of the ancient god of war and the sun. They are used as a private army of the wealthy class for their undeniable ability, highlighting, however, how in Volgen there is an absence of a central power capable of organizing a regular army and how the defense of the city depends on its continued economic success to afford to pay the mercenaries. \nThe wealthiest merchant in Volgen was &lt;a href=\"Fiorenza\"&gt;Fiorenza&lt;/a&gt;, a man who used his riches to buy artifacts of luxury and rare collector's items. Although it was an object whose existence was only confirmed by ancient books, the rich merchant managed to replicate the &lt;a href=\"Avelyn%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Avelyn&lt;/a&gt;, a crossbow and a priceless work of art at the same time, a weapon resembing a musical instrument. Despite contributing to the development of his city's technical capabilities to satisfy his hobby, Fiorenza ended up consumed by it. He was ruined by his expense accounts and exhausted his wealth after years of excessive debauchery."}

He wields a large mace.\nLocation.\nFound at the bottom of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Wall%20of%20Lothric\"&gt;High Wall of Lothric&lt;/a&gt;, opposite to the &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;castle&lt;/a&gt; and near the gate leading outside the city, toward the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Undead Settlement&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nVordt is a distant descendant of the &lt;a href=\"Gods%23Gods%20and%20Goddesses%20of%20Anor%20Londo\"&gt;ancient gods&lt;/a&gt; and as such he was among the &lt;a href=\"Gods%23Irithyllians%20and%20Descendants%20of%20Gods\"&gt;Irithyllians&lt;/a&gt;, hybrids between the race of the gods of Anor Londo and humans, who inhabit &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt;, the city built for them on the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Sulyvahn\"&gt;Sulyvahn&lt;/a&gt; imprisoned &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Dark Sun Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt;, proclaimed himself pontiff and assumed control of the city, he was ordered to serve under the tyrant as a &lt;a href=\"Boreal%20Outrider%20Knight\"&gt;Boreal Outrider Knight&lt;/a&gt;, that was the equivalent to being exiled. These knights, before being dispatched to foreign lands, were given the &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%27s%20Left%20Eye\"&gt;eye rings&lt;/a&gt; of the Pontiff, with the power to transform them into savage, raving warriors who only knew how to serve as mindless guards, thus ensuring Sulyvahn total control over them and preventing them from betraying. \nAfter &lt;a href=\"Lothric%2C%20Younger%20Prince\"&gt;Prince Lothric&lt;/a&gt; refused to link the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt; fell into ruin due to various internal problems, Vordt was thus sent to Lothric together with a division of &lt;a href=\"Boreal%20Outrider%20Knight\"&gt;Boreal Outrider Knight&lt;/a&gt;s and with the orders to keep a watchful eye over the &lt;a href=\"Dancer%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Dancer of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt;.. Here he positioned himself to guard the main gate leading inside the city. Like other Outrider Knights, he would end up transformed into a frenzied beast by the rings of the Pontiff, causing his armor to be fused with his hide.\nStrategy.\nVordt spends the first half of the fight making sweeping attacks and overhead strikes. These are well telegraphed, so the window for dodging is quite large. Blocking these attacks may lead to large &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; loss, meaning dodging is often more viable.\nAttacking in short bursts may prove more effective, as it allows the player to deal sufficient damage and keep enough stamina to dodge away.\nVordt's AI does not know what to do if you get directly behind him. If you take advantage of this after each charge in phase one then you can get him into a loop of trying to turn and face you. His turns have gaps in between them that give you the chance to put in some punishment. If you follow his butt you can end the first phase, no hits taken.\nThough Vordt can't close gaps instantly, he is still capable of charging over open terrain. If he lowers himself closer to the ground, he will likely charge the player, at which point the attack can be typically be dodged as easily as running to either side.\nWhen down to about half health, Vordt will be surrounded by a glittering mist. He will then use a charge attack which he repeats three times in a row, dashing from one side of the arena to the other, and then back and forth. Attempting to block may lead to death, as the back-to-back charges deal substantial damage. Dodging is the most efficient way to avoid these attacks.\nNow is your cue to change tactics. Be aggressive after each charge burst, three hits then roll away. Rinse and repeat this strategy until he begins to load up his freeze breath, now you must run round behind him and punish as much as you can. Using this strategy the fight will be over in no time.\nHe also uses a new ability after each set of charges. At the end of the third charge, he will stomp and take a deep breath of icy air and breath it out as a stream of ice that damages the player and inflicts &lt;a href=\"Frost\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt;. This ability is cast horizontally left-to-right across his body. Standing behind Vordt will allow the player to attack him while avoiding the Frost effect.\nVordt starts using new attacks during the second half of the fight, including several small, faster strikes. The faster strikes are easier to block but they can still easily &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Break\"&gt;break the player's guard&lt;/a&gt; without sufficient care for stamina management.\nOften, rolling directly underneath Vordt works well for avoiding his big attacks. However, staying there may cause him to perform a body slam.\nAlthough Vordt is found too early in the game for the player to get any substantial Frost resistance; in future &lt;a href=\"New%20Game%20Plus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;NG+&lt;/a&gt; playthroughs, achieving higher frost resistance helps avoid &lt;a href=\"Frostbite\"&gt;Frostbite&lt;/a&gt; status."}

The area is inhabited by several &lt;a href=\"Stray%20Hound\"&gt;Stray Hound&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAppearance.\nVorgel wears the &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Soldier%20Helm%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Hollow Soldier Helm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Soldier%20Armor%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Soldier%20Gauntlets\"&gt;Royal Soldier Gauntlets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Soldier%20Leggings\"&gt;Leggings&lt;/a&gt;, and wields the &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Winged Spear&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Soldier%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Hollow Soldier Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nVorgel the Sinner can be found past the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Belfry%20Gargoyles\"&gt;Belfry Gargoyles&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0underneath the &lt;a href=\"Belfry%20Luna%23Bonfires\"&gt;Upper Ramparts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;. He is surrounded by\u00a0several &lt;a href=\"Stray%20Hound\"&gt;Stray Hound&lt;/a&gt;s and invades the player when they reach the bottom of the ladder.\nLore.\nVorgel is located in a secluded area, and only invades the player when he reaches this small area. It seems as if he's guarding the &lt;a href=\"Bastille%20Key\"&gt;Bastille Key&lt;/a&gt;, which may lead to the assumption that he has sinned against the prison and released the prisoners.\nStrategy.\nVorgel himself is not a major threat; the &lt;a href=\"Stray%20Hound\"&gt;hounds&lt;/a&gt; that are present with him are the real threat. The small area means that the player does not have much room to move around and risks being swarmed by the hounds and Vorgel. Death is almost certain if the player is trapped in a corner. To make matters worse, Vorgel's attacks have pretty long range due to his &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt; and can easily finish off players that are trying to heal.\nHe will not follow the player up the ladder, meaning the player cannot bait him up the ladder to fight him one-on-one. However, this does mean that the player can finish him off or the hounds from above the ladder with ranged attacks, but this can be hard to achieve due to the ladder blocking the player's view.\nAnother alternative is to use the Strong Attack of a &lt;a href=\"Halberd%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Halberd&lt;/a&gt;; the spin attack will take out most, if not all, the hounds if they are grouped together and inflict damage on Vorgel himself if he is caught in the attack. Once all the hounds are dead, Vorgel can be easily disposed off.\nBy far the easiest way is to use a &lt;a href=\"Seed%20of%20a%20Tree%20of%20Giants\"&gt;Seed of a Tree of Giants&lt;/a&gt; to turn the hounds against him."}

Care should be taken, though, as the shout may attract nearby enemies.\nWarcry counts as an applied buff, and will overwrite and be overwritten by other weapon buffs and resins, such as &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20Weapon\"&gt;Blessed Weapon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Charcoal%20Pine%20Resin%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Charcoal Pine Resin&lt;/a&gt;. Due to being a weapon skill and not a spell, it is not affected by the &lt;a href=\"Lingering%20Dragoncrest%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lingering Dragoncrest Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfused weapons that cannot be normally buffed can still use Warcry. However, only the physical portion of the weapon's damage will be affected.\nAttack Modifiers.\nFor the duration of Warcry, weapons will gain unique attacks.\nFor axes, both charged strong attacks will feature the player charging a good distance before attacking, shoving opponents as they do so. The second strong attack will become an upward slash.\nFor the &lt;a href=\"Crescent%20Axe%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Crescent Axe&lt;/a&gt;, its strong attacks will become the same one used by axes with the buff active (having the same aforementioned features), rather than using attacks of a halberd.\nFor the &lt;a href=\"Club%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Club&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reinforced%20Club%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Reinforced Club&lt;/a&gt;, the first strong attack will become a four-hit combo consisting of two horizontal attacks and two downward attacks. The second strong attack will remain unchanged.\nFor greataxes, an extra attack will be added with each strong attack. &lt;a href=\"Yhorm%27s%20Great%20Machete\"&gt;Yhorm's Great Machete&lt;/a&gt; will gain a unique scissor-like attack akin to Yhorm's. \nCosts 20 &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt; per casting, regardless of weapon. However, the skill can still be casted without FP, forgoing its damage buff but retaining the initial stagger and the special strong attacks.\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nUseful skill overall, granting that extra damage boost needed to finish enemies with one less slash or to break the guard of those hiding behind shields. The effect lasts a very short time, though, which usually only lets the player barely get the upper hand at the beginning of a fight when dealing with a stronger foe.\nOnline gameplay.\nHeavily depends on the player's own fighting style. They should know exactly when to pull it off, either it is at the beginning of a duel or while in the middle of an arduous fight.\nAn additional benefit is the psychological impact this skill has on opponents, who tend to start fighting more defensively once they see their adversary has become stronger."}

The duration of the flame cannot be increased via equipping the &lt;a href=\"Lingering%20Dragoncrest%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lingering Dragoncrest Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nUse.\nSingle Player.\nThis spell is extremely useful for healing, as it is capable of restoring more HP than &lt;a href=\"Soothing%20Sunlight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Soothing Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; cast from a &lt;a href=\"Yorshka%27s%20Chime\"&gt;Yorshka's Chime&lt;/a&gt; with 60 &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt;, for barely more than half its &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt; cost and nowhere near as much Faith. Provided that enemies can be kept away from it (or controlled so that they do not overly benefit from its healing), this spell grants extreme amounts of self-sustain.\nOnline gameplay.\nCo-operative parties can benefit from this spell greatly, as their focused attack power can dissuade foes from contesting the flame, giving them a safe place to slowly recuperate. It is also extremely useful as an invader, as it can be used to provide aid to co-invaders in a &lt;a href=\"Dried%20Finger%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dried Finger&lt;/a&gt; world, and sustain strong enemies in a host's world, such as the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Sage\"&gt;Crystal Sage&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Judicator%20Giant\"&gt;Judicator Giant&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Ringed%20City%20%28location%29\"&gt;Ringed City&lt;/a&gt;. It is best combined with various area denial spells such as &lt;a href=\"Seething%20Chaos\"&gt;Seething Chaos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Snap%20Freeze\"&gt;Snap Freeze&lt;/a&gt;, to dissuade other players from contesting it, and as a last resort it can be relocated by casting it again at a new location, which will remove the existing one.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

This is also the only class in Dark Souls 2 to start out with a shield, the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Parma\"&gt;Iron Parma&lt;/a&gt;. While this shield can also be bought by other classes from &lt;a href=\"Maughlin%20the%20Armorer\"&gt;Maughlin the Armorer&lt;/a&gt;, available from the start of the game, and is largely outclassed by the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Eagle%20Kite%20Shield\"&gt;Silver Eagle Kite Shield&lt;/a&gt; that can also be bought from him, it's still a nice tool to have early on with its decent Physical blocking and &lt;a href=\"Stability\"&gt;Stability&lt;/a&gt;, and to save on souls early on before replacing it. \nHowever, their starting weapon, the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Straight%20Sword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Broken Straight Sword&lt;/a&gt;, is awful and should be replaced as quickly as possible. This can easiest be done by picking up the &lt;a href=\"Morning%20Star%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Morning Star&lt;/a&gt; found by dropping through the hole in the rocks to the left of the wooden fence seen just after exiting &lt;a href=\"Things%20Betwixt\"&gt;Things Betwixt&lt;/a&gt;, or by taking the dagger found inside the first sidepath fog gate of Things Betwixt. \nAlso, their below average &lt;a href=\"Adaptability\"&gt;Adaptability&lt;/a&gt; and mediocre &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Attunement&lt;/a&gt; means they have an awful roll starting out, with only 5 i-frames compared to most other classes having 8 or 9 i-frames for their rolls.

It does, however, have fairly low &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; and casting stats, with its very low &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Attunement&lt;/a&gt; of 6 making it notable for being the only starting class that doesn't immediately have an attunement slot for spells. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Axe%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Battle Axe&lt;/a&gt; is a strong weapon, if a bit slow, and thanks to its good Strength-scaling it will gain extra damage when two-handed. Its Weapon Art, &lt;a href=\"Warcry\"&gt;Warcry&lt;/a&gt;, boosts the Axe's damage by roughly 10% for 30 seconds and turns the heavy attack and charged heavy attack into running charge attacks. This is a weapon buff and as such doesn't stack with spells such as &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Weapon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic Weapon&lt;/a&gt; or items such as &lt;a href=\"Charcoal%20Pine%20Resin%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Charcoal Pine Resin&lt;/a&gt;, but since it boosts the weapon's base damage it can ignore the problems the other, elemental damage-focused options can get with having to bypass several different defences by instead focusing purely on physical damage. Be aware that due to the Warrior's low starting attunement it is only initially possible to get 3 uses of Warcry without either leveling Attunement by at least 2 points more or by carrying an &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Estus%20Flask\"&gt;Ashen Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe starting &lt;a href=\"Round%20Shield\"&gt;Round Shield&lt;/a&gt; has good &lt;a href=\"Stability\"&gt;Stability&lt;/a&gt; and surprisingly good physical blocking for a wooden shield, but unless the user wishes to &lt;a href=\"Parry%20%28skill%29\"&gt;Parry&lt;/a&gt; it is best exchanged for the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Eagle%20Kite%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Silver Eagle Kite Shield&lt;/a&gt; found in &lt;a href=\"High%20Wall%20of%20Lothric\"&gt;High Wall of Lothric&lt;/a&gt; to get a 100% physical blocking shield instead and will let them use skills more frequently thanks to the &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Skill\"&gt;Weapon Skill&lt;/a&gt; Weapon Art. \nIts &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Set\"&gt;Northern Set&lt;/a&gt; has good physical defence but is severely lacking in all elemental defences except for fire and has above average resistances, especially against &lt;a href=\"Frost\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt;. \nAn already infused version of the Battle Axe can be found in the High Wall of Lothric. While this weapon is guarded by a strong monster, the split Physical and Dark damage of its Deep infusion can be enough to overwhelm early-game enemies defences and the second boss, &lt;a href=\"Vordt%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Vordt&lt;/a&gt;, is weak to Dark damage, as is the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt; found in the area after him. While this won't last through the game, it is a good replacement for a bit until the original weapon can be upgraded more. "}

It has a high &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; requirement of 18, along with slightly slower attacks that cost more stamina than the average katana. Its extreme length can also become a drawback, as the weapon is prone to bouncing off of walls and even low ceilings, making it far less practical in tight corridors or when the user is forced into a corner.

However, the use of the &lt;a href=\"Bracing%20Knuckle%20Ring\"&gt;Bracing Knuckle Ring&lt;/a&gt; variants reduces the cost of the buff (depending on the level of the ring used), allowing the buff to be used more before breaking the weapon.\nIn addition to the buff adding magic damage, its fairly low &lt;a href=\"physical\"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stats%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;stat&lt;/a&gt; requirements make it a practical choice for characters with high &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;.

(Though this does not unlock the trophy/achievement for discovering the Way of White covenant. Unlocking the trophy/achievement as a knight or cleric will require abandoning the covenant and then re-joining via talking to Petrus or Reah).\nBenefits.\nMembers of the Way of White are more likely to join up with other members of the covenant in online play. Also, players in the Way of White have earlier access to Petrus' &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt; (including &lt;a href=\"Force\"&gt;Force&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heal\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Homeward\"&gt;Homeward&lt;/a&gt;, and more), although later Reah also offers stronger miracles at a better price without requiring the player to join the covenant.\nThere are also rumors that it decreases the chances of being &lt;a href=\"invade\"&gt;invade&lt;/a&gt;d, but without official confirmation it's impossible to confirm this due to various factors influencing invasions.\nBetrayal.\nNo penalty for betraying the covenant.\nOverview.\nThe Way of White is really only good for the early game for players who wish for early access to miracles. Later, all miracles become accessible to all players anyway, and the covenant loses any meaningful contributions it once had. If the player wants to stay in a co-op oriented covenant in the mid- or late-game, they should try becoming a &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Warrior of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Princess%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Princess's Guard&lt;/a&gt;, as those both offer miracles that will help while co-oping, as well as the matchmaking bonus.\nLore.\nThe Way of White is the oldest and most powerful cultural organization centered around the veneration of the &lt;a href=\"Gods%23Gods%20and%20Goddesses%20of%20Anor%20Londo\"&gt;gods of Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; and its goal is to maintain their influence on the world of men and keep extending the Age of Fire.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord Gwyn&lt;/a&gt; sacrificed himself to link the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, his throne passed to his &lt;a href=\"The%20Nameless%20King\"&gt;firstborn son&lt;/a&gt; who, however, chose to \"ally\" with the dragons, the ancient enemies of the gods, and was therefore exiled and his name eradicated from history. Taking advantage of the situation and thanks to the fact of being Gwyn's uncle, &lt;a href=\"Allfather%20Lloyd\"&gt;Lloyd&lt;/a&gt; rose to power, proclaiming himself king of the gods. He then became the main deity of the religion, known as the god of Law and Caste and his face was even minted on the golden coins used by men. \nAfter nearly all of the deities had abandoned Anor Londo, Lloyd moved his seat of power to the region of &lt;a href=\"Thorolund\"&gt;Thorolund&lt;/a&gt;, which then became the cultural and political center of the Way of White. \nThe god had absolute power over the country and thus chose among the nobles of the region the ones who would become his apostles and high priests of the Way of White, gifting them &lt;a href=\"White%20Seance%20Ring\"&gt;holy rings&lt;/a&gt; to increase their magic and making their duty the protection of law and social classes. In addition, Thorolund's clerics showed off their rank with their robes and those of high rank obtained talismans that worked even without faith but thanks to Lloyd's divine protection.\nUnder Lloyd the Way of White became also a militant religion, and Lloyd's cleric knights became famous for being unyielding in battle, using &lt;a href=\"Crescent%20Axe\"&gt;blessed axes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Force\"&gt;fighting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Replenishment\"&gt;healing&lt;/a&gt; miracles. The god also began a tradition of hunting the Undead, seen as cursed creatures, for which his warrior clerics were widely praised and for which they developed special amulets to combat their prey. However, Lloyd's own knights lived in terror of his duels of judgments in which the verdicts were curried out by his \"sword of law\", demonstrating how in reality Lloyd's government was paranoid and totalitarian. In addition, clerics dissatisfied with the teachings of the church were effectively exiled into \"spiritual journeys to test their faith\" which were considered self-purification rituals to return them to the doctrine. During the rule of Lloyd, depicted with a halo, some miracles of his Way of White were associated with similar aureoles of light.\nThe Way of White also developed &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Ember\"&gt;Divine Ember&lt;/a&gt;s, artifacts capable of infusing weapons with the &lt;a href=\"Divine_%28upgrade_path%29\"&gt;holy magic of the gods&lt;/a&gt;, to enhance their cleric knights and help them hunt Undead and necromancers. These embers were exclusive property of the church and selected blacksmiths were trained to the arts of &lt;a href=\"Divine%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;divine smithing&lt;/a&gt;. As an additional resource even &lt;a href=\"Large%20Divine%20Ember\"&gt;Large Divine Ember&lt;/a&gt; were created to further ascend weapons through a secret rite of the church, making them as powerful as the weapons of the gods.\nAt some point the Way of White created its first &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; paladin among one of Havel's soldiers. &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20Leeroy\"&gt;Paladin Leeroy&lt;/a&gt; was given a &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20Set\"&gt;golden armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grant\"&gt;Grant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sanctus\"&gt;Sanctus&lt;/a&gt;, two legendary weapons, and blessed with a white flame to be effective against the Dark. The paladin was sent to &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt; in the first Undead mission of the Way of White. Later there were further Undead missions, with the aim of seeking out &lt;a href=\"Rite%20of%20Kindling\"&gt;Kindling&lt;/a&gt;s, the secret rite of feeding bonfires with Humanity. One included &lt;a href=\"Reah%20of%20Thorolund\"&gt;Reah of Thorolund&lt;/a&gt;, last daughter of the royal house of Thorolund, accompanied by the two soldiers &lt;a href=\"Vince%20of%20Thorolund\"&gt;Vince of Thorolund&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nico%20of%20Thorolund\"&gt;Nico of Thorolund&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Dark Sun Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt; emerged from hiding and resumed his place as \"king of the gods\" thanks to his direct descent from the previous king Gwyn he also assumed command of the Way of White and became its main deity. The religion went through a major reform and Lloyd was cast out and his personal cult forgotten by the followers of the Way of White, so much so that now the clerics openly declare that he was a derivative fraud and that his title of king was self-proclaimed , yet the Undead hunts he instituted continue to persist.\nSome of the dethroned god's followers, now cast out as heretics, would find refuge in the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Painted World of Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;, bringing with them the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20White%20Corona\"&gt;lost miracles&lt;/a&gt; of the old religion and fully believing that one day the aureoles of light associated with Lloyd would return with him.\nOver time the region of &lt;a href=\"Carim\"&gt;Carim&lt;/a&gt; took on greater and greater importance in the religion, to the point that the local religious leader obtained the title of \"Archbishop\". In Carim the Way of White had great cultural growth, resuming not only training maidens and missions in distant lands but even Firekeepers who could support the tradition of Linking of the First Flame. Thus the study and reading of the ancient legends from the sacred books by the widely recognized saints continued. Furthermore, the faith placed in the words of the blind became important, to the point of producing Braille tomes filled with advanced miracles.\nArchdeacons, among the highest ranks of the Way of White, also wore finely decorated holy garbs as a sign of their position.\nAt some point the knight &lt;a href=\"Morne\"&gt;Morne&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Carim and became the Apostle of the Archbishop and together they labored to bring comfort to the suffering Morne introduced Carim to &lt;a href=\"Caitha%2C%20Goddess%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Caitha, Goddess of Tears&lt;/a&gt;, his goddess whom he had served with dedication, spreading her healing &lt;a href=\"Caressing%20Tears\"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt; and her cult. Over time Morne's influence grew to such an extent that Carim's cathedral was decorated with lined stone heads modeled on his helm and knights who demonstrated the most strength and faith were bestowed with replicas of his armor and hammer. However, the clerics of Carim also began to freely devote themselves to the creation of &lt;a href=\"Cursebite%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;forbidden rings&lt;/a&gt; and to use &lt;a href=\"Caitha%27s%20Chime%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;chimes&lt;/a&gt; that drawn upon the intelligence of the user together with their faith to cast miracles that lean towards the Dark, whose existence is concelead in the name of the Archbishop of Carim for they are anathema, implying that the goddess leaves a lot of freedom for her clerics to investigate the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Way of White built a &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;cathedral&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to the goddess Caitha and with the aim of cleansing humans from the stagnant darkness within them that was becoming an ever-increasing problem, using the \"sacred and peaceful\" body of water on which the structure was built to contain all the remnants from its cleansing rituals and even sent three archdeacons to manage it.\nAt a certain point, the king of the gods Gwyndolin was struck by an \"illness\" and &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Sulyvahn\"&gt;Sulyvahn&lt;/a&gt; took advantage of it, locking the god in the old abandoned cathedral of Anor Londo and self-proclaiming himself \"Pontiff\", thus assuming command of the Way of White. This caused a schism within the Way of White, as the Church of &lt;a href=\"Carim\"&gt;Carim&lt;/a&gt; and its Archbishop did not recognize Sulyvahn's authority, separating themselves from the denomination of the other Archbishops who kept following the Church of Irithyll."}

Whichever weapon is in the right hand is used to attack, while the weapon in the left hand is usually utilized to block or &lt;a href=\"parry\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt;, although in some cases it can also be used to attack.\nDespite this conglomeration, traditional weapons such as swords invariably have high attack power and low defensive power, while shields are invariably the other way around. If a sword is placed in the left hand, for example, and used to block, only its damage resistance and &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt; will affect its blocking effectiveness. In addition to attacking, a weapon can either block or parry when equipped in the left hand but not both at the same time; for example, scimitars can only parry or attack, but not block. Different weapons have different &lt;a href=\"moveset\"&gt;moveset&lt;/a&gt;s depending on which hand they are equipped in.\nAttack Types and Parameters.\nAll weapons have an Attack Type, otherwise known as a &lt;a href=\"damage%20type\"&gt;damage type&lt;/a&gt;, and can have values in &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Damage%20Type%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Damage%20Type%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Damage%20Type%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage. Some weapons have varying movesets, or attacks, and each move may inflict a different type of physical damage. For example, some daggers inflict &lt;a href=\"Slash\"&gt;Slash&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Thrust\"&gt;Thrust&lt;/a&gt; damage depending on which attack is used.\nWeapons have parameters, also called stat requirements that need to be met in order to be wielded properly. These are usually &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; but can also include &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt;. If the Strength stat isn't met, two-handing the weapon will decrease the requirement, effectively increasing the player's Strength by a factor of 1.5. Many weapons also have &lt;a href=\"parameter%20bonus\"&gt;parameter bonus&lt;/a&gt;es that scale with corresponding &lt;a href=\"Stats%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt;, providing a higher attack rating.\nWeapon Types.\nAll weapons have a weapon type that aid the player in determining the basic functionality of that weapon. Weapons of the same weapon type usually have similar movesets and often inflict the same type of &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Types\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;. Weapons of the same type may also have different attack speeds and &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; damage. "}

The heavier an item is, the more it encumbers the player. Weapons with a higher weight value tend to have a slower swing speed, and heavier armor pieces tend to have more defense and &lt;a href=\"Poise\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; while reducing &lt;a href=\"stamina\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; regeneration.\nEquipment Load.\nMaximum equipment load is determined by the &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt; stat and determines how greatly the weight of the currently equipped weapon and armor affects movement and &lt;a href=\"roll\"&gt;roll&lt;/a&gt; speed. This change occurs when the total sum of the weight of equipment exceeds 25%, 50% and 100% of total equip load.\nIncreasing equipment load above 100%, 115% and 120% further slows the player's actions, including turning around, with the maximum effect at 120% and above. When 120% is exceeded, the player may only walk and rolling is no longer possible. &lt;a href=\"Backstep\"&gt;Backstep&lt;/a&gt;ping and rolling become a stagger-like motion.\n&lt;a href=\"Havel%27s%20Ring\"&gt;Havel's Ring&lt;/a&gt; boosts the player's maximum equipment load by 50%, the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Favor%20and%20Protection\"&gt;Ring of Favor and Protection&lt;/a&gt; boosts the player's maximum equipment load by 20%, and the &lt;a href=\"Mask%20of%20the%20Father\"&gt;Mask of the Father&lt;/a&gt; boosts the player's maximum equipment load by 5%.\nStrength equation.\nThere is an equation used to determine the amount of strength a weapon/shield requires to be wielded. The equation is:\nformula_1\nThis equation is shown in almost every weapon's strength/weight values. For example, the equation for the &lt;a href=\"Zweihander\"&gt;Zweihander&lt;/a&gt; is 24 = 2(10) + 4."}

Against foes without armor or scales, however, they can be relatively effective. The large radius of the whip's attack makes them very good at dealing with multiple opponents, and while it is impossible to combo well with it, each separate swing does come quite quickly.\nWhips are also unique in that they\u00a0cannot be\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte\"&gt;parried or riposted&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0This, along with the &lt;a href=\"Notched%20Whip\"&gt;Notched Whip's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt; buildup, or the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Tail\"&gt;Guardian Tail's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; buildup, means that multiple attacks on foes is both safe and effective. Conversely, though, whips cannot &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt; or riposte, making them less useful for players who often go for these. They are also incapable of plunging attacks.\nWhips do not display the &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Augmentation\"&gt;augmentation&lt;/a&gt; applied to the weapon when the whip is coiled in the players hand,\u00a0however upon the whip's extension for an attack, the augmentation effect will appear. In terms of &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, this allows for the user of the whip to hide the augmentation (such as &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Magic%20Weapon\"&gt;Crystal Magic Weapon&lt;/a&gt;) until attacking their opponent. Although, in the case of the magic augmentations, the augmented whip will glow blue (innate effect of magic augmentations) while coiled in the players hand, but the blue magic 'aura' will only appear upon the whips extension. Also, when casting the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Weapon\"&gt;Hidden Weapon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sorcery\"&gt;sorcery&lt;/a&gt;, the whip will be invisible in the player's hand, but when the player attacks with it, a light aura can be seen while the animation performs.

Their intention was to use sermons and preaching to draw men into the dark; however, their voracious gluttony led to many abandoning their charge. They now infest the lower streets of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Ringed%20City%20%28location%29\"&gt;Ringed City&lt;/a&gt;, feeding off whatever flesh they can find.\nThey are capable of summoning branches infused with magic as primitive melee weapons.\nLocations.\nFound in &lt;a href=\"The%20Ringed%20City%20%28location%29\"&gt;The Ringed City&lt;/a&gt;, throughout the swamp of the &lt;a href=\"Ringed%20City%20Streets\"&gt;Ringed City Streets&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nThe White Faced Locust can be found in two forms throughout the swamp that dominates the Ringed City Streets, one being the large initially hostile versions that dot the swamp, and the other being the infantile lesser locust that scatter when the player draws near.\nLarger Locusts will attempt to attack the player in several ways, all of which in some form of melee, although there is a ranged exception to this list of attacks. The most basic being a three strike combo with their claws that starts with two horizontal swipes, ending with a double handed overhead slam possessing some limited area effect. The Locust can sometimes opt out to just attack with one of the three swings along, foregoing the entire combo.\nEach of the large locusts is capable of manifesting a branch of pure magic to attack the player.\nThese other attacks involve some form of magic damage increasing their power, with the first being a single downward strike that has a long start as the Locust hovers in the air for several moments before manifesting his branch and attacking. The second is a rapid set of downward stabbing strikes that the Locust will fire off rather quickly after the attack's initial startup, possessing a slight ability to &lt;a href=\"stun-lock\"&gt;stun-lock&lt;/a&gt; the player if they are caught squarely in font of the Locust's hitbox. The last strike is the most damaging, although it is the most telegraphed, as the Locust will form two branches before leaping toward the player, giving an audio cue (\"I shall partake\"), and on contact will grab the player to deal damage with several bites.\nThe last of the large Locust attacks is a short ranged action by firing mucus at the player from its abdomen. The Locust will turn around and fire off several burst of the attack, fanning its effecting on a small cone behind. The attack can do some severe damage, especially if multiple projectiles make contact with the player per volley. The attack also causes the player to become encumbered as the mucus builds up on their body, slowing them and giving them a heavy roll. This can be the most deadly attack as it makes the player prone to follow up attacks, especially from other Locust."}

The bow can be found on a corpse in the area.\nCharacteristics.\nA rather unusual bow, the White Birch Bow possesses some characteristics that can make it a boon in the right hands.\nRequiring 20 &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;, it has the highest Dexterity requirement of all bows, limiting the number of builds that can wield it. However, as it is classified as a short bow, it is capable of performing rolling and running attacks like the &lt;a href=\"Short%20Bow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Short Bow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Composite%20Bow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Composite Bow&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with a shot range that rivals that of the &lt;a href=\"Longbow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Longbow&lt;/a&gt;. The drawback, however, is that it barely scales with &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, and as a result will ultimately deal the least damage per shot among all bows in the game.\nThe main characteristic of the White Birch Bow is its &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;, which hides the arrow that it fires. Combined with the &lt;a href=\"Obscuring%20Ring\"&gt;Obscuring Ring&lt;/a&gt; and its higher than usual shot range, this allows crafty invaders to attack the host's party from outside of detection range, without revealing the direction that they attacked from.\nTrivia.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

It has a magic attack power of 2.8 times the catalyst's magic adjust.\nIt has both a longer casting time and travels at a slower velocity than most other sorceries, so hitting a nimble target with it can prove tricky.

This means that when the spell is cast, it can travel up walls, should one be in its path.\nWhite Dragon Breath comes with 20 uses for a single slot.

However, like &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Soul Spear&lt;/a&gt;-type spells, it is capable of hitting multiple targets in a line, meaning that it can be useful against crowds of enemies at close range. As well, it costs less &lt;a href=\"FP\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt; than a Soul Spear, a trade-off for its short range.\nOnline gameplay.\nThe caster holds the staff high when casting White Dragon Breath, giving it the same animation as casting a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Soul Arrow&lt;/a&gt;- or Soul Spear-type spell. This makes it useful as a mix-up against foes that are expecting a projectile as opposed to a close-ranged beam. As well, unlike the projectile spells, the ground effect nature of the spell allows it to be free-aimed, meaning that the caster can predict a foe's movements and alter aim to compensate.\nDescription.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Official translation=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;"}

It cannot use any Spell Buff gained from Intelligence when casting standard Miracles like &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Arrow\"&gt;Lightning Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, but only when casting Pyromancies and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; Miracles such as &lt;a href=\"Great%20Chaos%20Fire%20Orb\"&gt;Great Chaos Fire Orb&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dorhys%27%20Gnawing\"&gt;Dorhys' Gnawing&lt;/a&gt;, and it does not gain any Dark bonuses while casting Dark spells. Being a talisman, it is capable of benefiting from values of Faith up to 60, however as a dual-scaling catalyst it can also efficiently utilize Intelligence up to values of 45.\nHowever, despite all these characteristics, its Spell Buff is rather poor at all values of Intelligence and Faith, making a \"master of none\" rather than a \"jack of all trades.\" As a Miracle catalyst it is outstripped by even weak tools like the &lt;a href=\"Saint-tree%20Bellvine\"&gt;Saint-tree Bellvine&lt;/a&gt;, and furthermore it suffers from the distinction of being the only talisman that does not possess &lt;a href=\"Unfaltering%20Prayer\"&gt;Unfaltering Prayer&lt;/a&gt;, making it incapable of &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;poise casting&lt;/a&gt;. As a Pyromancy catalyst, it is easily outclassed by both &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20Flames%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Pyromancy Flames&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Demon%27s%20Scar\"&gt;Demon's Scar&lt;/a&gt; at much lower investments of Intelligence and Faith.\nHow to obtain.\nIn order to survive the trip inside the lava, there are many strategies that can be followed and even combined before venturing inside. The main idea is to slow down the loss of &lt;a href=\"HP%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; enough time, allowing the player to heal up and advance a bit further, repeating the process as many times as necessary until they have successfully gotten the item and returned to solid ground. Each time the player's health reaches half of the HP bar, they should heal.\nHere is a small list with just a few strategies to survive:\nUpgrades.\nReinforced with &lt;a href=\"Twinkling%20Titanite%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Twinkling Titanite&lt;/a&gt;."}

During the twirling, using a light attack will perform a spinning slice, while using a strong attack will do a lunging spin.\nUsage.\nCampaign.\nThe weapon art is decently effect during PvE. The twirling can stun-lock weaker enemies, while doing an R1 mid twirl effectively finishes them. This tactic is much less effective against stronger enemies like &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Knight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Silver Knights&lt;/a&gt;, however. Using an R2 during a twirl can close a gap between the player and enemy fairly well.\nOnline gameplay.\nPvP is were this weapon art truly shines. The twirling can stun-lock an invader for at least three hits, and if the player has enough &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;, they can maintain the twirling long after the invader stops rolling. Using an R1 can potentially roll-catch someone rolling out of the way. An R2, on the other hand, can deal massive damage if both hits connect and roll-catch them if they dodged the first hit. Be wary, however, as the twirling can be &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parried&lt;/a&gt;."}

Their headpiece, a visage of a grinning face, resemble Savoyard-style Cuirassier helmets.\nStrategy.\nWinged Knights are difficult to stagger, so it is recommended not to attempt long combos against them, as they will often interrupt with a shunt. Both variants can perform a spin attack lasting several seconds that will completely drain the player's &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; if blocked and inflict heavy damage. Evading through the spin is the best way to avoid this, as it can clip the player if they try evading to the side.\nBoth variants can also summon &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Pillars%20of%20Light\"&gt;pillars of light&lt;/a&gt; that briefly obscure vision and inflict heavy damage. They can still summon the light during &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt; or death animations, so the player should be cautious about sticking close to the knight until the pillars have faded.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Knight%20Twinaxes\"&gt;twinaxes&lt;/a&gt;-wielding knight can toss its weapons from a distance; this attack leaves it exposed for a few seconds.\nAll variants are very susceptible to backstabs, therefore it is advisable to dodge behind them for easy opportunity.\nDrops.\n&lt;tabber&gt;High Wall of Lothric =\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

She is a spellcaster providing some ranged &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; support for the player.\nLocation.\nBeatrice appears as a summon sign under the staircase leading up to the &lt;a href=\"Moonlight%20Butterfly\"&gt;Moonlight Butterfly&lt;/a&gt; (only if the player has had &lt;a href=\"hollow\"&gt;hollow&lt;/a&gt;ing reversed).\nHer summon sign is later found behind a pillar before the &lt;a href=\"fog%20door\"&gt;fog door&lt;/a&gt; leading to the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Kings\"&gt;Four Kings&lt;/a&gt; fight in the &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt;. The Moonlight Butterfly must be defeated with Beatrice's help for her sign to appear here.\nPlot.\nAside from being a summon-able NPC for the &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; fights labeled above, Witch Beatrice has no obvious contribution to the game through either story or gameplay, although her attire can be obtained.\nAfter defeating the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Kings\"&gt;Four Kings&lt;/a&gt;, her &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Set\"&gt;robes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beatrice%27s%20Catalyst\"&gt;catalyst&lt;/a&gt; may be found on a corpse near the &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt; shortcut at the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Drakes\"&gt;Valley of the Drakes&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Four Kings boss fight, Beatrice is close to becoming a hindrance to the player as her damage-per-second does not always provide enough output to quickly kill each King. On most occasions, since having an NPC increases a boss's &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, having Beatrice summoned occasionally only benefits the player with a harder fight as her accuracy issues and time gaps in-between attacks gives players a much harder time killing the Four Kings.\nShe has a habit of occasionally not showing up for the Four Kings boss fight, this is not a bug or glitch. As soon as she is summoned, staying too long outside of the fog door will allow a ghost, to the player's right if they face the fog door, to aggro the player and Beatrice and because she has no transient curses, she will be stuck firing &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;sorceries&lt;/a&gt; at the ghost and remain unable to assist in the boss fight until the ghost is killed.\nLore.\nWitch Beatrice is mentioned to be one of the few catalyst-users that did not hail from one of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; Schools in &lt;a href=\"Vinheim\"&gt;Vinheim&lt;/a&gt;, setting her apart from other casters.

It is unknown what part Child Beatrice would have played in the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt;'s quest. However, like most removed content, it is possible to add Child Beatrice to the game through third-party programs. As \"Dark Souls\" is heavily influenced by \"&lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Aberserk\"&gt;Berserk&lt;/a&gt;\", it is possible that Child Beatrice is related to the character &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Aberserk%3ASchierke\"&gt;Schierke&lt;/a&gt;, as both are children, both are witches, wear similar attire and both are normally seen holding a &lt;a href=\"Staves\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt;."}

She is also in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\", although by that time her name is lost to history and only her nickname of \"mother of pyromancy\" remains.\nA legendary fire sorcerer who found one of the four &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Soul\"&gt;Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt;s, she helped bring an end to the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Ancients\"&gt;Age of Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and the rule of the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s to establish the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Age of Fire&lt;/a&gt;, and established an underground civilization named after her. She had many daughters, nicknamed the \"Daughters of Chaos\", which included &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Witch%20Quelaag\"&gt;Queelag&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quelana%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Quelana&lt;/a&gt; and \"&lt;a href=\"Quelaag%27s%20Sister\"&gt;The Fair Lady&lt;/a&gt;\", as well as &lt;a href=\"Ceaseless%20Discharge\"&gt;a son&lt;/a&gt;. By the time of the game's events, her magical experiments backfired, fusing her soul and two of her daughters' into a new horrible being, the &lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;. Although the Bed was eventually slayn by the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt; and its soul fed to the &lt;a href=\"Lordvessel\"&gt;Lordvessel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Witch%20Soul\"&gt;fragments of the Witch's soul survived&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nIzalith appears as a towering humanoid, visibly taller than both her children and their catalysts. She has blue lips, ashen skin and hands burnt from extracting her soul from the First Flame. She wears a much more refined version of the gold-hemmed black robes her children wear.\nLore.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;.\nIzalith is one of the primordial humanoid creatures that appeared underground after the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; appeared, bringing life, death and \"disparity\". She was one of those who found the four &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Soul\"&gt;Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt;s, souls of immense power, together with &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Nito\"&gt;Gravelord Nito&lt;/a&gt; and much later the &lt;a href=\"Furtive%20Pygmy\"&gt;Furtive Pygmy&lt;/a&gt;. \nThanks to the power of her soul, Izalith established an underground civilization and, at some point, she also had at least seven children , who wore &lt;a href=\"Gold-Hemmed%20Black%20Set\"&gt;gold-hemmed black robes&lt;/a&gt; to protect themselves from the dangerous fires, poisons and perils of the environment were they lived. Studying the power of souls and the First Flame, Izalith and her daughters became \"fire sorcerers\" capable of manipulating fire. The power of their staffs was adjusted to their faith and in fact they were also shamans, thus implying that the primordial society of Izalith was in a deep relationship with nature and fire.\nAt some point Izalith and her daughters took part in the war against the &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;s with the intention of exterminating them and conquer the world together with the other bearers of the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Soul\"&gt;Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt;s: &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Nito\"&gt;Nito, First of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;. Izalith contributed to the conflict by manipulating the flames directly with the power of her Lord Soul, while her daughters employed sorcery staff as mediums. Together they weaved &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Tempest\"&gt;great firestorms&lt;/a&gt; that scorched the very earth, destroying the &lt;a href=\"Archtree\"&gt;archtrees&lt;/a&gt; and burning the dragons while Nito unleashed a miasma of death, rotting the archtrees and infecting the dragons and Gwyn and his knights battled the dragons with their their mighty lightning bolts. After a long struggle Izalith and the Lords emerged victorious, exterminating most of the archdragons and thus conquering the surface world for themselves. After the war was over, Izalith and her children left the surface to Gwyn, his clan and the humans they had subjugated, preferring to create their own civilization underground, where they built their &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Izalith\"&gt;capital city&lt;/a&gt; named after their goddess Izalith inside an immense cave made of molten rock and where lava flowed below. The city developed around the massive Archtree located at its core and the throne room of Izalith was directly connected to it.\nIzalith and her daughters thus continued to experiment with the power of fire and souls and at a certain point, driven by ambition and arrogance, the Lord tried to create a \"First Flame\" of her own, using her own Lord Soul as a basis to make a power similar to the primordial force that had brought life into the world. The experiment, however, was not successful because the result was a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Flame of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, an unstable power that the witch was unable to control. Izalith herself was initially consumed by it and became a beast of chaos fire along with two of her daughters in the process transforming themselves into a \"&lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;\". This creature, fueled by the power of the Flame of Chaos, became a seedbed for a new life form: &lt;a href=\"Demon%20%28lore%29\"&gt;Demons&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first demon who manifested himself was the youngest son of Izalith. He was a younger brother of the other witches who gifted him a magic ring to protect him from the lava that tortured him. However, the still unstabilized Flame of Chaos led him to transform into a &lt;a href=\"Ceaseless%20Discharge\"&gt;monstrous demon&lt;/a&gt; and drop his ring, leaving the flames of chaos to burn him constantly as he couldn't control them. Despite the first distorted creature created by the Flame of Chaos, Izalith and her daughters managed at a certain point to stabilize the new power they had created and began to generate the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Firesage\"&gt;first real demons&lt;/a&gt;, life forms with stable bodies and capable of control the flame of chaos within each of them. These new creatures were not absolutely beastly but rather, they learned to coexist with the already present society of Izalith, becoming \"demon priests\" of the Flame of Chaos and even going so far as to learn the primordial flame sorceries from the Lord and her daughters and the city of Izalith expanded to accommodate its new citizens, building &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Ruins\"&gt;structures for the demons&lt;/a&gt; on its borders.\nOver time, Izalith and her daughters, captivated by the new power and longing to hold it in their hands, began to experiment with their Flame of Chaos, creating &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;pyromancies&lt;/a&gt;. This art of fire, of the primal life born from the Flame of Chaos similar to the First Flame, is the power of igniting and controlling it but also being aware that control is impossible. For this reason it is a primitive culture that requires to be in touch with nature, thus implying that the rituals and society of the new Izalith still remained connected to nature in a form of shamanism and the first forms of pyromancies manipulated the abundant lava that flowed in Izalith. The Flame of Chaos itself began to be refined and employed in the form of &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Flame%20Ember\"&gt;Chaos Flame Ember&lt;/a&gt;s employed by blacksmiths to imbue weapons with the power of chaos fire.\nAs the First Flame began to fade, Gwyn planned to sacrifice himself to re-energize it and prolong the Age of Fire, creating the myth of the Chosen Undead that would succeed it. Izalith apparently cooperated in his plan, building one of the two &lt;a href=\"Bells%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Bells of Awakening&lt;/a&gt; in her city, as the first part of the challenges the undead would have to overcome to be accepted as worthy contenders to succeed Gwyn as Lords of Cinder.\nAt one point Izalith, aiming to gain greater control over the Flame of Chaos, lost control of the power again. This time however she failed to bring it under control: Chaos engulfed the Lord and her daughters before scorching their city with them. Izalith and her two daughters directly involved in the experiment were left permanently scarred, reduced to a monstrous lignified creature anchored in the throne room at the center of the city. Of the daughters of Izalith, few managed to escape. &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Witch%20Quelaag\"&gt;Quelaag&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Quelaag%27s%20Sister\"&gt;sister&lt;/a&gt;'s lower bodies were molded into deformed demonic spiders and the flames of chaos engulfed them but they managed to escape the city and survive on its borders, carving out a &lt;a href=\"Quelaag%27s%20Domain\"&gt;domain&lt;/a&gt; for themselves. The only other survivor, who managed to avoid the corruption of chaos and retain a normal body, was &lt;a href=\"Quelana%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Quelana&lt;/a&gt;, who remained in self-imposed exile around the ruins of her country for centuries\nThe collapse of the society of Izalith, left without their Lord and devoured by the out-of-control Flame of Chaos, pushed Gwyn to wage war against the chaos demons, developing weapons and fighting techniques strong enough to face the size of their new enemies and sending his &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Knight\"&gt;Silver Knight&lt;/a&gt;s to Izalith. During the war their armor and weapons were charred black but despite their strength Gwyn's knights failed to defeat the demons or destroy the Bed of Chaos, ending up retreating and only managing to banish the demons underground while also enslaving some &lt;a href=\"Batwing%20Demon\"&gt;lesser demons&lt;/a&gt; who would become servants of the gods. At some point after Gwyn linked the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Nameless%20King\"&gt;Gwyn's firstborn son&lt;/a&gt; was dethroned and exiled , nearly all of the other deities abandoned Anor Londo. During all this time the Bed of Chaos had continued to generate new demons and, with no leadership present in Anor Londo and the Silver Knights remaining relegated to protecting the city of the gods, some lesser &lt;a href=\"Capra%20Demon\"&gt;Capra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taurus%20Demon\"&gt;Taurus&lt;/a&gt; demons began to rise to the surface, making their way through the ruins of the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Burg\"&gt;Undead Burg&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt; was able to ring the &lt;a href=\"Bells%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Bells of Awakening&lt;/a&gt;, overcome the challenges of &lt;a href=\"Sen%27s%20Fortress\"&gt;Sen's Fortress&lt;/a&gt; and reach &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; thus being rewarded with the &lt;a href=\"Lordvessel\"&gt;Lordvessel&lt;/a&gt;, they would be guided by &lt;a href=\"Kingseeker%20Frampt\"&gt;Kingseeker Frampt&lt;/a&gt; to find immense souls to fill the receptacle and link the fading &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; to succeed Gwyn in his sacrifice. The Undead would thus have delved into the dangerous and pestilent &lt;a href=\"Blighttown\"&gt;Blighttown&lt;/a&gt; until they reached the edges of the ancient domain of Izalith. Here their path would be blocked by the half-demon daughter of Izalith &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Witch%20Quelaag\"&gt;Chaos Witch Quelaag&lt;/a&gt; but, after killing her, the Undead was able to gain access to the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Ruins\"&gt;Demon Ruins&lt;/a&gt;. Making their way through the demons that infested the area, they reached the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Izalith\"&gt;lost city of Izalith&lt;/a&gt; and the throne room where Izalith, turned into the distorted &lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; rested, still fused with her two daughters and her original body reduced to that of a &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Bug\"&gt;Chaos Bug&lt;/a&gt; under all her roots. The Chosen Undead thus challenged and killed her to obtain her powerful Lord Soul. The destruction of the original Flame of Chaos ended Izalith's misery, but it also marked the beginning of the end for the demons who, without the Bed of Chaos that had spawned them, began to become a dying race.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite the fact that the &lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; had been destroyed by a &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt;, a fragment of the Flames of Chaos managed to survive and drifted to settle underground in the far north of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt;. Here it reformed as an expanse of fire, lava and roots and started to give birth to atrocities and monsters that cursed the region, leading people to flee in fear. Eventually the &lt;a href=\"Burnt%20Ivory%20King\"&gt;Ivory King&lt;/a&gt; and his knights managed to eliminate the demons that arose from the &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Chaos\"&gt;Old Chaos&lt;/a&gt; and drive them back into the depths. The sovereign, thanks to the power of his soul, thus built the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Eleum%20Loyce\"&gt;Eleum Loyce&lt;/a&gt; over that land and erected an immense cathedral, a fortress city and a Garrison Wall above the Chaos, in an attempt to contain it and its horrors with all his efforts, even going so far as to use the power of his own soul to stem his raging flames. \nHowever the flames of Chaos would not be sated and over time the Ivory Knight was drained of his vigour and, sensing the degradation of his power he decided to plunge into Chaos' heart in an attempt to reduce its flames alone but was devoured by the chaos, becoming an empty husk controlled by it. After their King was consumed by Chaos, many of Eleum Loyce's faithful knights decided to follow him and put him out of his misery but their souls too were corrupted by the flames, leading them to lose all sense of purpose and being and leaving them driven only by the urge of expuning any who might disturb the flames, even if they were former compatriots. With their armor charred and burnt black by fire and still burning in agony they remained as empty shells controlled by the Chaos alongside their once-proud king.\nAs a last resort to stem the advance of the Chaos that couldn't be contained, the decision was made to \"flung open\" the ivory gates of the fortress of Eleum Loyce. &lt;a href=\"Alsanna%2C%20Silent%20Oracle\"&gt;Alsanna&lt;/a&gt;, as the heiress to her Lord's wishes and in reverence of the apocalypse, devoted herself and the power of her Dark Soul to a ritual in the hopes of appeasing the raging flame. As a result the entire land of Eleum Loyce grew cold and lifeless turning into a &lt;a href=\"Frigid%20Outskirts\"&gt;frigid expanse&lt;/a&gt;, in an attempt to freeze Chaos along together with the entire country, thus sacrificing it. The Knights of Eleum Loyce thus remained to watch over the Garrison Ward faithful to the King's final order of containing the Chaos waiting patiently for a new leader strong enough to guide them into its depths, while Alsanna remained in prayer inside the Cathedral over the depths to continue the ritual to keep the Chaos contained.\nAn immense amount of time after her &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Soul\"&gt;Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt; was used to link the First Flame, Izalith's very name was lost and in the region of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; the few who still remember her existence only remember that she was the mother of pyromancy and that she was devoured by her chaos flame. However, some &lt;a href=\"Old%20Witch%20Soul\"&gt;remnants of her soul&lt;/a&gt; manifested again in Drangleic, continuing to exert their influence on the region. \nAt some point a pyromancer. was imprisoned inside the furthest cell of the &lt;a href=\"Sinners%27%20Rise\"&gt;Sinners' Rise&lt;/a&gt;, an isolated tower apart from the &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Bastille\"&gt;The Lost Bastille&lt;/a&gt;. While the Bastille was used to contain the Undead that plagued the region, this pyromancer was imprisoned and contained in an extreme manner, with &lt;a href=\"Penal%20Handcuffs\"&gt;Penal Handcuffs&lt;/a&gt; to restrain their powers and a &lt;a href=\"Penal%20Mask\"&gt;Penal Mask&lt;/a&gt; with spikes pointing inward to bind and torture them, to be punished for their sins. One day the prisoner came into contact with the soul of Izalith deep inside the &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Bastille\"&gt;Lost Bastille&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Bug\"&gt;Chaos Bug&lt;/a&gt; like to the one Izalith had been reduced came to inhabit their body . The remants of Izalith's will influenced the prisoner, leaving them eternally to punish themselves for the sins of her past, for trying to light a First Flame in her arrogance. Their &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Sinner%27s%20Sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; became cursed with a power similar to that of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Blade%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Chaos Blade&lt;/a&gt;, symbolizing the burden of Izalith's misdeeds\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the times and region of &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt;, both the bed and the flame have gone out, and the demons are now a dying species as no new members of their race are being generated. Some remain in a secret city of demons, found amidst Izalith's decrepit structures, most of its citizens being demons and corrupted Izalith citizens. The &lt;a href=\"Old%20Demon%20King\"&gt;Old Demon King&lt;/a&gt; sits alone amidst fallen combatants, with his flames dying out, the last of the original citizens of Izalith to have remembered the birth of Chaos, and the Witch of Izalith."}

They will only attack when the player gets too close. Before attacking, Wolves growl angrily, warning the player to maintain their distance. If provoked, they will attack with an interesting strategy: they run all together toward the player surrounding them. This allows them to attack from every direction. Their most dangerous threat is their howl: if a wolf howls, all other wolves in the area will follow the call and attack the player.\nLocation.\nThey are commonly found in the road between the first and the second &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Painted World of Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nThe first thing to remember about these feral beasts is the fact they hunt in packs, so it's better to approach them with caution. It is important to keep all wolves in front of you to manage them well. Even though they are many, they are weak individually and will typically fall in only a few hits. If you hear a howling, be prepared to face around five or six of them simultaneously."}

High poise is useful for fighting enemies that hit hard, but are tough to evade. In PvP, poise tends to be essential for players that do not wish to get stun-locked; the Wolf Ring may come in very handy there. Overall, the Wolf Ring best suits wearers of medium armor; the 40 poise is probably not enough to help with most lightly-armored characters, and wearers of heavy armor already do not need to worry about being staggered."}

The strong attack is good for using your spacing and range to your advantage.\nOnline gameplay.\nBe cautious with using your jump attack, as players can dodge it and punish you hard. However, the stagger while in midair may catch players off guard, following with heavy damage. If you happen to catch someone in a combo, ending it with the light attack may surprise few."}

If a player comes across a heavily crowded area, they may just shoot an arrow to one of the &lt;a href=\"Enemies%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; and draw them in one by one, effectively clearing out the place and using as few resources as possible.\nAdditionally, many traps can be triggered by shooting wood arrows at them, which may translate in a safer journey and/or the deaths of many enemies without having to waste more valuable types of ammunition, like &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Arrow\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;poison arrows&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player may also fully stock on wood arrows quite early in the game: 999 wood arrows for 9,990 &lt;a href=\"Souls%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt;, which can be considered to be a very economical price in advanced stages of the game and which will provide enough ammunition for use in various situations without having to worry of running out for a very long time."}

It has a larger radius than Force; on top of this, it has a magic attack power equal to 2.8 times the talisman's magic adjust.\nWrath of the Gods benefits from &lt;a href=\"miracle%20synergy\"&gt;miracle synergy&lt;/a&gt;. The attack multiplier increases by 0.1 for each level of synergy, up to a maximum of 3.2.\nGetting hit by this miracle while facing the back of the caster will send you towards the caster instead of away from them. This will also hit through blocks, regardless of stability. This does not occur in the Remaster, and will instead be blocked.\nOverview.\nThanks to its fast cast time and its very high damage that often ignores &lt;a href=\"shields\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; and almost always &lt;a href=\"stagger\"&gt;stagger&lt;/a&gt;s or knocks over enemies, Wrath of Gods is considered to be one of the best Miracles in the game. In PvE, it is a very useful \"panic\" spell\u2014very few enemies can withstand repeated castings of this miracle in &lt;a href=\"New%20Game%20Plus\"&gt;NG&lt;/a&gt;. Wrath of the Gods is also useful against &lt;a href=\"Boss\"&gt;Boss&lt;/a&gt;es due to their slow movement speed.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, Wrath of the Gods is frowned upon by many to be \"cheap\". Indeed, it can often nearly instantly kill players, cause stagger with too high of &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; and will almost always deal heavy damage if it connects.\nCounters.\nKeeping a good distance from the user will limit the usefulness of this spell. Should distance be closed, rolling at the right time will prevent all effects of Wrath of the Gods; having a fast roll greatly increases the chance of surviving an encounter with this miracle. &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Barrier\"&gt;Magic Barrier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Great%20Magic%20Barrier\"&gt;Great Magic Barrier&lt;/a&gt; drastically reduce the damage output of this spell.\nIf the spell actually connects with the player, it is actually better to have lower poise. The lower the poise is, the more quickly a player will fall over instead of being staggered. Players that are knocked over gain invincibility frames (and thus a chance to get away), while players that simply get staggered can be hit again with another cast.\nDescription.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Official translation=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Once the sword is in the ground, the user gains &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt; as well as 50 &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; health. Roughly two seconds later, an &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;area-of-effect&lt;/a&gt; shockwave is unleashed, dealing 1.8 times the weapon's Attack rating as &lt;a href=\"Physical%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; damage to any enemies close to the user.\nThis skill requires 30 &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt; to be performed (23 FP when the &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Ring\"&gt;Farron Ring&lt;/a&gt; is equipped).\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nThis skill is effective for clearing mobs, assuming the\u00a0user has enough time to thrust the weapon into the ground, thus preventing staggers.\nOnline gameplay.\nThis skill can be very risky and difficult to use, as the Hyper Armor does not begin until the sword has been thrust into the ground, and there is a long delay between the thrust and the shockwave. This means that the skill is easy to interrupt, and opponents will have ample time to react and dodge the explosion. In order to properly use this skill, one should ideally attempt to ambush unaware foes in order to buy time for the thrust to complete, and use it in an enclosed area where the foe cannot easily escape the blast radius."}

As he bears the title of \"King\", and the fact that he utilizes Chaos &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Pyromancies&lt;/a&gt; suggest he was King of &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Izalith\"&gt;Izalith&lt;/a&gt;, and therefore husband of the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Witch&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe presents a great bump over his head, covered with bandages and soaked in blood, which is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Parasitic%20Wall%20Hugger\"&gt;Parasitic Wall Hugger&lt;/a&gt; encountered in &lt;a href=\"Blighttown\"&gt;Blighttown&lt;/a&gt;. The similarities, and the fact that the Wall Hugger internal name is \"Prince Izalith\", indicate that Jeremiah probably carries an insect demon egg.\nAs his corpse and phantom are both located in the Painted World, it's safe to assume that he was somehow trapped in the painting and unable to get out. The reason for his exile in the Painted World is unknown, but giving the &lt;a href=\"Xanthous%20Crown\"&gt;Xanthous Crown&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Snuggly%20the%20Crow\"&gt;Snuggly the Crow&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Favor%20and%20Protection\"&gt;Ring of Favor and Protection&lt;/a&gt; is given in exchange, implying a connection between Jeremiah and the goddess &lt;a href=\"Fina\"&gt;Fina&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps Jeremiah cheated The Witch of Izalith with Fina, leading to his banishment.\nHe was probably killed by &lt;a href=\"Priscilla\"&gt;Priscilla&lt;/a&gt; as his corpse is found right next to her. This implies that he tried to kill Priscilla, as the half dragon is shown to always act on self defense."}

She comes clad in the &lt;a href=\"Xanthous%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Xanthous Set&lt;/a&gt; and wears the &lt;a href=\"Obscuring%20Ring\"&gt;Obscuring Ring&lt;/a&gt;, rendering her invisible at a distance.\nShe comes armed with the &lt;a href=\"Heysel%20Pick\"&gt;Heysel Pick&lt;/a&gt;, a weapon named after her, which allows her to quickly combine casting &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;sorceries&lt;/a&gt; while in the middle of an encounter. Throughout the battle, she will occasionally switch to a &lt;a href=\"Light%20Crossbow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Light Crossbow&lt;/a&gt; instead.\nHer main method of attack consists in constantly casting &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Hail\"&gt;Farron Hail&lt;/a&gt;, unleashing a quick barrage of small &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;-based projectiles at great speed. She sometimes combines this attack with a casting of &lt;a href=\"Great%20Farron%20Dart\"&gt;Great Farron Dart&lt;/a&gt;, attempting to make her enemies fall off-balance and inflict heavy damage. She may rarely attempt to sneak up on the player using &lt;a href=\"Chameleon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Chameleon&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\n&lt;a href=\"Road%20of%20Sacrifices\"&gt;Road of Sacrifices&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Farron%20Keep\"&gt;Farron Keep&lt;/a&gt;\nStrategy.\nThe main concern in this battle is that Heysel invades unexpectedly in heavily populated areas, and the &lt;a href=\"Obscuring%20Ring\"&gt;Obscuring Ring&lt;/a&gt; she wears gives her the advantage of surprise at the beginning of the fight. This may prove to be dangerous the first time she invades in the &lt;a href=\"Road%20of%20Sacrifices\"&gt;Road of Sacrifices&lt;/a&gt;, as the player may be already with their hands full, perhaps fending off a group of &lt;a href=\"Lycanthrope%20Hunter\"&gt;Lycanthrope Hunters&lt;/a&gt;, or worse yet, a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Crab\"&gt;Great Crab&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, perhaps her most dangerous appearance takes place in the &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Keep\"&gt;Farron Keep&lt;/a&gt;, where enemies are stronger and the player may be already &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;poisoned&lt;/a&gt; and with their mobility compromised due to being wandering through deep water. If this happens, it is of utmost importance trying to get away from the rest of the enemies and look for solid ground as soon as possible.\nFurthermore, one of the biggest problems when Heysel invades in this location is actually finding her, as she will be invisible at the beginning and it can become difficult to locate her throughout all the great swamp. A simple method to find her is to head to the third brazier (or the first one, if exploring counter-clockwise) and, most surely, she will appear near the cave guarded by several &lt;a href=\"Basilisk%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Basilisks&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Scroll\"&gt;Golden Scroll&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Antiquated%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Antiquated Set&lt;/a&gt; are found. Additionally, she will reveal her presence every now and then by casting spells at a distance.\nHeysel usually attacks by constantly casting &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Hail\"&gt;Farron Hail&lt;/a&gt;, where she unleashes a quick barrage of &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;-based projectiles. She will be unable to move or even turn while the duration of the spell, though, leaving her stuck and facing in one direction for a couple of seconds. The player may take this opportunity to flank her and score some hits.\nOccasionally, she will hold her weapon with both hands and rush forward; when this happens, the player may receive her with an attack of their own. She staggers easily and many subsequent hits may be dealt to her until &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; runs out. If she takes out her &lt;a href=\"Light%20Crossbow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;, just move to the sides and try to approach her to score more hits.\nShe will try to lure the player into fighting on her territory (e.g.: the &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;poisonous&lt;/a&gt; swamp), but the player may do the same and force her to chase them to higher ground.\nTrivia.\nHeysel is the daughter of the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Abyss%20Watchers\"&gt;legion&lt;/a&gt; acolytes, and the creator of the &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Hail\"&gt;Farron Hail&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;sorcery&lt;/a&gt;."}

As well, much like the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Machete%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Great Machete&lt;/a&gt; it has very long reach, being the longest greataxe in the game and allowing its wielder to more easily out-space foes. And finally, its unique version of &lt;a href=\"Warcry\"&gt;Warcry&lt;/a&gt; enables it to perform special crushing attacks in place rather than the forward-rushing chain attacks of its cousins.\nHowever, because it is a soul-transposed weapon and highly specialized towards Strength builds, this means that it is incapable of being easily wielded by anything short of Strength-heavy or quality builds. As well, being a machete-type weapon, its two-handed weak attacks are incapable of staggering foes long enough for two-hit combos, short of situations involving elevation disparities between the wielder and target. This means that in order to be wielded optimally, Yhorm's Great Machete is best held in only one hand, further requiring a specialized build to make use of it."}

What makes it unique among greatshields, however, is that it increases the player's &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; by 15% while wielded, a trait shared only by the &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Knight%20Long%20Spear\"&gt;Lothric Knight Long Spear&lt;/a&gt;. As such, it pairs well with large &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt; weapons, allowing the wielder to more easily win trades against foes foolish enough to engage."}

Similar to other &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lords of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;, his body and armor is covered in several burning scars and cuts.\nLocation.\nFound at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Profaned%20Capital\"&gt;Profaned Capital&lt;/a&gt;, in a large throne room located between two treasury rooms guarded by &lt;a href=\"Jailer%20Handmaid\"&gt;Jailer Handmaid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Mimic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Mimics&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle\"&gt;Gargoyle&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLore.\nLong ago the grand giant Yhorm, the descendant of an ancient conqueror, was asked to lead the people once subjugated, serving as both their blade and shield. When there were those who doubted him, he gave them a giant-slaying sword, to show his trustworthiness. He risked everything for his people in the frontlines, fighting valiantly as a one-man vanguard. It is stated that he lost someone dear to him and, as a result, he forsook his greatshield. Afterwards, he notched his machete to allow for two hand use, giving him an even more ferocious fighting style. At some point, \"lonely\" Yhorm befriended &lt;a href=\"Siegward%20of%20Catarina\"&gt;Siegward of Catarina&lt;/a&gt;, who became a dear friend of his.\nDue to a curse triggered by the four female relatives of an unknown oracle, which also turned them into &lt;a href=\"Monstrosity%20of%20Sin\"&gt;careless greedy creatures&lt;/a&gt;, the Profaned Flame, a flame that never goes out, formed. Yhorm became a &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord of Cinder&lt;/a&gt; to put the Profaned Flame to rest, even as they spoke insincerely of his role However, after he became a Lord of Cinder, this hellish flame fell out of the sky and destroyed the city, yet consuming naught but human flesh, incinerating the human inhabitants. The flame, despite deriving from Dark and the Abyss, actively sought to harm humanity.\nBefore burning in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, he gave his other &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Ruler\"&gt;Storm Ruler&lt;/a&gt; to Siegward, who promised to end Yhorm's suffering if he ever returned to life..\nStrategy.\nYhorm's attacks are, for the most part, not difficult to evade; however, most weapons, even if heavily reinforced, will not deal a significant amount of damage to him. The key to defeat him lies beside his throne, a &lt;a href=\"Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;greatsword&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Ruler\"&gt;Storm Ruler&lt;/a&gt;. The sword &lt;a href=\"Weight\"&gt;weighs&lt;/a&gt; eight units, so that should be taken into consideration by the player before entering the boss arena.\nBy activating the Storm Ruler's skill, \"&lt;a href=\"Storm%20King\"&gt;Storm King&lt;/a&gt;\", the player will slam the sword into the ground, unleashing a furious storm which will deal a huge amount of ranged damage to Yhorm. In order to use the skill, the player must first hold the stance for a few seconds, at which point the wind around the blade intensifies.\nIf the player has ended &lt;a href=\"Siegward%20of%20Catarina\"&gt;Siegward&lt;/a&gt;'s questline, he will enter the battle with his very own Storm Ruler, which was given to him by Yhorm himself, making the fight much easier.\nThe player may opt to enter the battle arena and go directly for the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Ruler\"&gt;Storm Ruler&lt;/a&gt;. Once acquired, they may exit the game and continue. The player will appear outside the fog door once more. There, they may charge the sword and make proper preparations before the fight.\nAn alternative strategy is to use a long reach weapon, such as the &lt;a href=\"Greatsword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;, and target Yhorm's arms and head as they take about double and triple the damage of his legs, respectively. Eventually Yhorm will be staggered and can be riposted for massive damage that is on par with the Storm Ruler's skill."}

Climb the ladder on the far-right and walk along the rafters until reaching the other end of the room. Drop down to an elevated platform with a chest that contains the weapon.\nCharacteristics.\nAn unassuming weapon, Yorshka's Spear can be a powerful tool in the right hands.\nIt is one of three spears that possesses sweeping attacks, the other two being the &lt;a href=\"Partizan%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Partizan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ringed%20Knight%20Spear\"&gt;Ringed Knight Spear&lt;/a&gt;. This gives it wide horizontal coverage that also has the bonus of inflicting Strike damage, which the vast majority of armor sets resist very poorly. The different timings on its strong attacks gives it versatility, making it hard to predict and dodge in &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;. It also has very high elemental absorption when used to block, though low stability restricts this tactic to being used to reduce the damage dealt by incoming spells.\nAs it scales with three &lt;a href=\"Stats%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stats&lt;/a&gt;, it can be difficult to build this weapon to inflict optimal damage at lower levels, and as such it generally performs best when &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; are prioritized over &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt;. As well, unlike the other sweeping spears, its &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; does not grant &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt;, which further hampers its ability to threaten opponents.\nWhat makes Yorshka's Spear so exceptional is that its skill, &lt;a href=\"Pacify\"&gt;Pacify&lt;/a&gt;, grants it the ability to deplete the &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;Focus Points&lt;/a&gt; of any target struck by the weapon. Combined with its ability to mix up attacks, strike from a distance and harass with running attacks, this allows it to threaten an opponent's ability to cast spells or perform weapon arts, something that no other weapon can do.\nMoveset.\n&lt;br&gt;\nUpgrades.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

She then does the same, pledging allegiance to the player and accepting them as her Lord and of all the hollows in &lt;a href=\"Londor\"&gt;Londor&lt;/a&gt;, in the hope that one day the Ashen One brings back its glory to the world.\nUpon talking to her, the player will learn the \"Dignified Bow\" &lt;a href=\"Gestures%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;gesture&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce &lt;a href=\"Orbeck%20of%20Vinheim\"&gt;Orbeck of Vinheim&lt;/a&gt; has moved to Firelink Shrine, Yuria will alert the player that he is he has proclaimed himself to be \"Lord of Hollows,\" asking the player to settle the matter lest he imperil the player's rule. If the player brings &lt;a href=\"Orbeck%27s%20Ashes\"&gt;Orbeck's Ashes&lt;/a&gt; to Yuria, she will reward them with the &lt;a href=\"Morion%20Blade\"&gt;Morion Blade&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the player reaches the &lt;a href=\"Catacombs%20of%20Carthus\"&gt;Catacombs of Carthus&lt;/a&gt;, Yuria reveals that she is also guiding &lt;a href=\"Anri%20of%20Astora\"&gt;Anri of Astora&lt;/a&gt; along the path to &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt;, and plans to engage him/her (gender is always the opposite of the player's) in matrimony.

Defeating the Pale Shade once will reward the &lt;a href=\"Manikin%20Claws%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Manikin Claws&lt;/a&gt;, while defeating them at both locations will cause the &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Shade%20Set\"&gt;Pale Shade Set&lt;/a&gt; to appear at Firelink Shrine in the same area where Yuria and Yoel used to reside.\nConversely, if the player has not turned Yuria hostile, the &lt;a href=\"Londor%20Pale%20Shade\"&gt;Londor Pale Shade&lt;/a&gt; will become available for summoning in the aforementioned areas.\nYuria will disappear if Anri dies at any point before Pontiff Sulyvahn.\nCompleting Yuria's questline by Linking the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; while possessing 8 Dark Sigils unlocks the &lt;a href=\"Endings%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29%23The%20Usurpation%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Usurpation of Fire&lt;/a&gt; ending.\n&lt;a href=\"Ashes%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Ashes of Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;.\nYuria possesses additional dialogue should the player progress through the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Painted World of Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;.

It doesn't deal quite as much damage as the strong attacks of other Ultra &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, but deals immense &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt; damage like all weapons in the UGS class, but is slightly faster to swing (the other weapons require a \"charge up\"). Normal &lt;a href=\"enemies\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; will be immediately smashed into the ground, and almost all bigger enemies will be interrupted. It is one of the only moves in the game that can swing faster than a &lt;a href=\"Mushroom%20Parent\"&gt;Mushroom Parent&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Golem\"&gt;Crystal Golem&lt;/a&gt; can attack, yet is guaranteed to break their poise, interrupting their attack. This makes it an ideal weapon/attack versus those enemies. Like most weapons with large poise-breaking capacities, barely missing an enemy with the strong attack can still cause a &lt;a href=\"stagger\"&gt;stagger&lt;/a&gt;.\nContrary to popular belief, Zweihander is NOT a \"Strength Weapon\" but is a \"Quality\" Scaling weapon meaning it scales near equally off Strength and Dexterity and will be at its full potential at the relevant stat softcaps.\nThe overhead swing also has the advantage of a high vertical reach. This makes it a very good weapon to use to cut Dragon tails: most other Ultra Greatswords will require a running attack to swing upwards, and &lt;a href=\"great%20hammers\"&gt;Great Hammers&lt;/a&gt; don't reach quite as high. The overhead swing also makes the player dodge certain attacks that reach horizontally.\nThe Zweihander can be a very strong weapon early in the game due to its close proximity to the starting area and relatively low stat requirement of 16 &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; to two-hand the weapon. Even un-upgraded, its base damage and staggering abilities are formidable for the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Burg\"&gt;Undead Burg&lt;/a&gt; area.\nResistance Defense.\nAlong with &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elemental\"&gt;Elemental&lt;/a&gt; damage reduction, weapons also have hidden stats that reduce the amount of &lt;a href=\"status\"&gt;status&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"build-up\"&gt;build-up&lt;/a&gt; while blocking.\nUpgrades.\nScaling Percentage Values.\nThe following chart lists the scaling percentages when this weapon is fully upgraded.

It is advised to use ranged weapons to lure them away from the crowd if the player wishes to engage them. They will constantly cast fireballs at a distance, so moving in close is recommended.\nThe Handmaids will occasionally perform a lunging stab with their dagger, but their main close range attack is to shoot a cone of flame out of their lanterns. This attack has a large radius, but can be completely avoided by moving behind the maiden. All attacks performed by them are very slow in speed, giving ample time to step aside or behind them. Handmaidens also have very low poise, and can be knocked over very easily."}

His sign is located to the right of two &lt;a href=\"Grave%20Warden\"&gt;Grave Warden&lt;/a&gt;s outside the corridor to &lt;a href=\"Mytha%2C%20the%20Baneful%20Queen\"&gt;Mytha, the Baneful Queen&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Fog%20Door%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;fog gate&lt;/a&gt;.

However, it is advised the poison pit in her arena is drained by burning the windmill blades in Central Earthen Peak or by using &lt;a href=\"Pharros%27%20Lockstone\"&gt;Pharros' Lockstone&lt;/a&gt;s before the battle, as it will impede his movement and slowly drain his health, reducing his effectiveness.\nHis armor, the &lt;a href=\"Jester%27s%20Set\"&gt;Jester's Set&lt;/a&gt;, can be bought from &lt;a href=\"Magerold%20of%20Lanafir\"&gt;Magerold of Lanafir&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Keep\"&gt;Iron Keep&lt;/a&gt;, close to that area's first bonfire. All four pieces grant a specific bonus to the player (wearing the &lt;a href=\"Jester%27s%20Gloves\"&gt;Jester's Gloves&lt;/a&gt;, for example, increases the amount of souls acquired from fallen enemies).\nJester Thomas returns in the\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Crowns\"&gt;Crown of the Sunken King&lt;/a&gt;\"\u00a0DLC. He invades the player near the bottom of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Dragon's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, right inside from the Lair of the Imperfect. As soon as Jester Thomas invades the player, he will do the \"This one's me\" &lt;a href=\"Gestures%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;gesture&lt;/a&gt; once he sees the player, and if the player dies, he may do the \"Mock\" gesture. His arsenal contains\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Flame%20Swathe\"&gt;Flame Swathe&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Sun\"&gt;Forbidden Sun&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Warmth\"&gt;Warmth&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Flash%20Sweat%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Flash Sweat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Firestorm%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Firestorm&lt;/a&gt; and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Great%20Fireball%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Great Fireball&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nJester Thomas can be a powerful opponent when confronted as a dark spirit, as he will always dodge the player's attacks and quickly cast his pyromancies. However, as with most spell-casting NPCs, he'll often leave himself open to attack while casting, and dealing enough Poise damage to him as he is readying a spell will interrupt it. A follow-up attack while he is recovering from stagger is not recommended, as he'll most probably roll away and retaliate.\nAs virtually all of Jester Thomas's damage output is through his pyromancies, equipping fire-resistant gear such as &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Quartz%20Ring\"&gt;Flame Quartz Ring&lt;/a&gt; and utilizing spells such as &lt;a href=\"Flash%20Sweat%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Flash Sweat&lt;/a&gt; will greatly reduce the amount of damage he does. As well, a small basin of water at the fog gate where he invades can be rolled into to gain the &lt;a href=\"Waterlogged\"&gt;Waterlogged&lt;/a&gt; status effect, further reducing the damage that his spells deal.\nWhen half of his health has been depleted, he'll cast &lt;a href=\"Warmth\"&gt;Warmth&lt;/a&gt; to heal himself. Run toward this spell's area of effect, attack Thomas to make him run away and claim the spell as yours, effectively stealing its healing properties for yourself for the rest of the battle.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Jester%27s%20Set\"&gt;Jester's Set&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0he's wearing makes him immune to &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;s and also reduces fall damage he takes.\n&lt;a href=\"Profound%20Still\"&gt;Profound Still&lt;/a&gt; will stop him from using any pyromancies, and he'll switch to a sword in response."}

Those foolish enough to attack the city were struck down and their wills enslaved by the giants, who used them as defenses against further intruders.\nThe giants are led by &lt;a href=\"Judicator%20Argo\"&gt;Judicator Argo&lt;/a&gt;, who acts as the master of the &lt;a href=\"Spears%20of%20the%20Church\"&gt;Spears of the Church&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey have the ability of summoning the following enemies to fight for them:\nStrategy.\nJudicator Giants will use melee slams at close range, but their primary means of attacks is summoning the spirits of fallen warriors to assault the player. These spirits cannot be attacked and will continue to appear periodically until either the giant is slain or they retreat far enough out of their aggro range. The spirits can be summoned from anywhere as long as the giant can detect the player, even if they are out of sight. The giant raising its arms and a loud droning sound will alert the player that it has detected them.\nThere are three varieties of spirit summoned by the giant. The most common are archers wearing the &lt;a href=\"Ruin%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Ruin Set&lt;/a&gt; that will fire several volleys of arrows at the player. The second variant is a Silver Knight that wields &lt;a href=\"Ledo%27s%20Great%20Hammer\"&gt;Ledo's Great Hammer&lt;/a&gt; and the final variant is a sorceress. The giant can also conjure a giant dragon head that breathes fire when the player is in close proximity."}

The desert is inhabited by the local specie of giant anthills known as corrosion bugs capable of producing a powerful acid.The larvae are known as a delicacy, but they will melt a person to the bone if they dare enter and destroy their mound. Despite this, their body fluids are extracted and used to fill clay pots which become &lt;a href=\"Corrosive%20Urn\"&gt;lethal corrosive weapons&lt;/a&gt;. The related specie of the &lt;a href=\"Acid%20Horn%20Beetle\"&gt;Acid Horn Beetle&lt;/a&gt;s, capable of secreting the same type of corrosive substance, has established itself in east of Drangleic near the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Amana\"&gt;Shrine of Amana&lt;/a&gt;, developing the ability to release a cloud of corrosive fungal spores from their bodies. A single &lt;a href=\"Corrosive%20Ant%20Queen\"&gt;Corrosive Ant Queen&lt;/a&gt; at some point migrated to Drangleic and made her nest deep in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Gutter\"&gt;Gutter&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe country was founded by the mythical hero &lt;a href=\"Aurous\"&gt;Aurous&lt;/a&gt;, who, according to legend, owned a &lt;a href=\"Aurous%27%20Set\"&gt;special armor&lt;/a&gt; made of a mysterious substance that doesn\u2019t appear to a coward\u2019s eyes. The royal family of Jugo, which still controls the country since the time of its founder, continue to hand over the armor of Aurous to the new ruler. The kingdom is known as a land of honorable fighting men focused on war and honing their skills.\nIn Jugo there is a particular group made up mostly of women known as the &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Sorceress\"&gt;Desert Sorceresses&lt;/a&gt;. These are skilled &lt;a href=\"pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;pyromancy&lt;/a&gt; who are capable of casting away fans rather than with their hands, implying their ability to exploit their country's arid climate to generate fire spells through unconventional sorcery staves. These women dress in &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Sorceress%20Set\"&gt;thin and revealing clothes infused with great magic&lt;/a&gt; and, thanks to the fact that they all possess an attractive appearance, they use their look to seduce their opponents as a trick to deceive them. At some point after the fall of &lt;a href=\"Vendrick\"&gt;King Vendrick&lt;/a&gt;'s kingdom, a group of these sorceresses from Jugo moved into Drangleic and came to reside in the domain of &lt;a href=\"Mytha%2C%20the%20Baneful%20Queen\"&gt;Queen Mytha&lt;/a&gt; neart the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Peak\"&gt;Earthen Peak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Harvest%20Valley\"&gt;Harvest Valley&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=\"Desert%20Pyromancer%20Zoey\"&gt;Zoey&lt;/a&gt;, a distant descendant of the Desert Sorceresses, possessed a true beaty like them but did not use it to poison and poison others, becoming the modest queen of the weak."}

The damage dealt by the miracle is dependent on the magic adjust of the weapon in the player's right hand, as well as if they are wearing items like the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Dusk\"&gt;Crown of Dusk&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Red%20Tearstone%20Ring\"&gt;Red Tearstone Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0The explosion has a base magic attack power of 280, and is affected by the intelligence and faith scaling of the weapon equipped in your right hand when the explosion occurs.\nAll weapons have a MagAdjust stat, but it is only visible on weapons that can cast spells. Any weapon that does not have any &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Faith\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt; scaling will have a MagAdjust of 100. Weapons that have Intelligence and/or Faith scaling, such as any &lt;a href=\"Divine\"&gt;Divine&lt;/a&gt; weapon, will affect the damage of Karmic Justice.\nTriggering is caused by five consecutive hits that deal damage to within a span of around 5 seconds of each other. Karmic Justice disappears from the player after it is triggered once; players who desire its benefits must cast it again. Karmic Justice can be activated even when the hits are being blocked by a shield, but only if damage was taken through the shield.\nOverview.\nKarmic Justice is a unique miracle. In PvE, it can be useful to cast this just prior to fighting a large group of enemies as insurance should the player become surrounded. However, Karmic Justice won't help the player if they are killed when or before it triggers, making it less useful at higher levels of difficulty due to the high damage opponents do in &lt;a href=\"New%20Game%20Plus\"&gt;NG+&lt;/a&gt; and beyond. In &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, Karmic Justice can be useful for more defensive players as a way to prevent opponents from being overly aggressive.\nNotes.\nThe hit counter required for activation of Karmic Justice remains active even during a player's dying animations, potentially setting off Karmic Justice post-defeat if opponents continue to swing at the player.\u00a0\nKarmic Justice remains active for one minute or until the explosion is triggered before wearing off.\nDescription.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Official translation=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The first couple of slashes are performed impressively fast for this kind of weapon and will, in most cases, &lt;a href=\"stagger\"&gt;stagger&lt;/a&gt; an enemy after the first hit, usually allowing the second one to land as well.\nThis weapon has 100 &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;, making it very reliable for long trips. This feature is emphasized in , where the weapon has been given an impressive 220 durability, allowing players to practically stop worrying about it breaking apart.\nIn addition to this, the weapon also has a high physical damage reduction, at an 80.0% reduction, as well as a relatively-high reduction against &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; damage, making it suitable for use as a shield should the player find it necessary to block incoming attacks. While it does also have an impressive amount of &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt;, it should be noted that, like most ultra greatswords, its &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; damage reduction and resistances to the various &lt;a href=\"Negative%20Status%20Effects%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;negative status effects&lt;/a&gt; are extremely low.\nWith at least 80 &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, this weapon deals the highest damage on a normal hit of any weapon, unless the attack is a &lt;a href=\"counter\"&gt;counter&lt;/a&gt;."}

As well, in watery environments it can innately create Lightning shockwaves without the need to equip Lightning Bolts, making it handy for tripping up human opponents in areas such as &lt;a href=\"Road%20of%20Sacrifices%23Bonfires\"&gt;Crucifixion Woods&lt;/a&gt; if aimed at their feet.\nUpgrades.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

All weapons must be collected on a single character.\nMost weapons can be collected in a single playthrough, but weapons crafted from can only be crafted once per playthrough. Most boss souls offer the option to create two different weapons, but the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20Sif\"&gt;Soul of Sif&lt;/a&gt; can be used to create three different weapons, thus &lt;a href=\"New%20Game%20Plus\"&gt;New Game+2&lt;/a&gt; (a third playthrough) would be required to craft all possible variants. Weapons from the DLC \"&lt;a href=\"Artorias%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Artorias of the Abyss&lt;/a&gt;\" are not required for this achievement/trophy.\nThe following is a list of weapons and their respective locations:\nBoss Soul Weapons.\nThis list is roughly based on the order that the boss is encountered. Some important notes:\nSevered Tail Weapons.\nThese weapons are obtained by cutting the tail of certain enemies. You may only get one chance at most of these weapons until the next playthrough, as the enemies do not appear again, with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Bell%20Gargoyles\"&gt;Gargoyles&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Dragon\"&gt;Stone Dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf a boss is about to die, and it seems unlikely the tail will be severed, quit the game and reload the save. This will spawn you outside the fog gate, giving you a chance to try again.\nCovenant Weapons.\nThis weapon is granted upon joining its respective &lt;a href=\"Covenants\"&gt;Covenant&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnemy Weapons.\nThese weapons can only be obtained by defeating certain enemies throughout the game. Most weapons have a low drop rate, which means it may take several attempts for the enemy to drop the desired weapon.\nGuaranteed Drops.\nThe following weapons are guaranteed to drop, if the enemy is killed.\nBlack Knights.\nBlack Knight weapons are only dropped by &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight\"&gt;Black Knight&lt;/a&gt;s who wield that weapon. Most knights in the game do not respawn, however the five Black Knights guarding the &lt;a href=\"Kiln%20of%20the%20First%20Flame\"&gt;Kiln of the First Flame&lt;/a&gt; do. All four variants can be found here, making it a perfect location to obtain these weapons.\nSilver Knights.\nSilver Knight weapons are significantly rarer than Black Knight weapons, with drop rates at between 1 and 2 percent. &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Knight\"&gt;Silver Knight&lt;/a&gt;s can only be found in &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;. Like the Black Knights, they only drop the weapons they wield in battle. Sword and spear wielding knights can be found in the various rooms within the main building.\nLooted Weapons.\nThese weapons are obtained by looting corpses or chests throughout the game."}

It is also suitable to a wide variety of builds thanks to its good &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;, and decent &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;. It also has good &lt;a href=\"Vitality%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt;, letting it carry heavier equipment easier. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Long%20Sword\"&gt;Long Sword&lt;/a&gt; is a strong and versatile weapon, with fast swings on its light attacks and a strong thrusting attack as its one-handed heavy attack, capable of dealing heavy damage if a &lt;a href=\"Counter%20Attack\"&gt;Counter Attack&lt;/a&gt; is landed. Its Weapon Art, &lt;a href=\"Stance%20%28Straight%20Sword%29\"&gt;Stance&lt;/a&gt;, is similarly versatile, as following as using a light attack while holding the stance leads to a block-breaking uppercut while the heavy attack version is a lunging thrust to catch enemies off guard. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Knight Shield&lt;/a&gt; is, along with the &lt;a href=\"Herald%20%28class%29\"&gt;Herald's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kite%20Shield\"&gt;Kite Shield&lt;/a&gt;, one of only two starting shields with 100% physical blocking, giving the Knight considerable extra survivability early on. However, its elemental defences are bad and it has somewhat mediocre &lt;a href=\"Stability\"&gt;Stability&lt;/a&gt;, making it easier to break that block. It has the &lt;a href=\"Parry%20%28skill%29\"&gt;Parry&lt;/a&gt;, allowing for critical hits if the user knows how to time it properly against enemies. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Knight Set&lt;/a&gt; it is carrying is the strongest starting armor set, with quite good physical defenses and respectable elemental defences, and has a good amount of &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; for if using a weapon or attack capable of activating &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt;. It does however have mediocre status resistances and is fairly heavy, and the Knight largely lacks the ability to exploit its Poise unless a larger weapon is acquired. \nThe adequate mental stats mean that just one point in either Intelligence or Faith could let it pick up some helpful spells, &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Soul Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spook\"&gt;Spook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Weapon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic Weapon&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer%27s%20Staff%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Sorcerer's Staff&lt;/a&gt; for the former and &lt;a href=\"Heal%20Aid\"&gt;Heal Aid&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Talisman%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Talisman&lt;/a&gt; for the latter. \nIts extremely low &lt;a href=\"Luck\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt; of 7, shared with the &lt;a href=\"Pyromancer%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Pyromancer&lt;/a&gt; class, means it is often optimal for a large amount of non-pyromancer, non-luck based builds, due to not wasting any of its starting point in that often sub-optimal stat, though it does lack other classes' starting equipment which might help make them initially more optimal/have earlier access to items for that role.

Along with &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Slayer%20Ornstein\"&gt;Ornstein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lord%27s%20Blade%20Ciaran\"&gt;Ciaran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hawkeye%20Gough\"&gt;Gough&lt;/a&gt;, he became part of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Knights%20of%20Gwyn\"&gt;Four Knights of Gwyn&lt;/a&gt; and as a symbol of his association with the order he gained a &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Ring\"&gt;magical ring with the wolf symbol&lt;/a&gt;, which strengthened his poise, making his fighting style with his greatsword more effective.\nArtorias wore his distinctive &lt;a href=\"Set%20of%20Artorias\"&gt;azure-blue tassel armor&lt;/a&gt; as a symbol of pride and glory and brandished his &lt;a href=\"Greatsword%20of%20Artorias\"&gt;Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Greatshield%20of%20Artorias\"&gt;Greatshield&lt;/a&gt;. Artorias was also a dear friend of &lt;a href=\"Lord%27s%20Blade%20Ciaran\"&gt;Ciaran&lt;/a&gt;, his companion as another Knight of Gwyn. At a certain point Artorias met &lt;a href=\"Great%20Grey%20Wolf%20Sif\"&gt;Sif&lt;/a&gt;, a great grey wolf, and formed a deep bond with it, fighting alongside the fearsome animal like he was his companion to the point that the wolf learned to fight with his greatsword and acquired the power of Artorias' soul.\nAt some point after &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord Gwyn&lt;/a&gt; sacrificed himself to link the fading &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Primordial%20Serpent\"&gt;Primordial Serpent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Darkstalker%20Kaathe\"&gt;Kaathe&lt;/a&gt; began searching for a human strong enough to become the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Lord\"&gt;Dark Lord&lt;/a&gt; capable of leading humans and usher in an &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Dark\"&gt;Age of Dark&lt;/a&gt;. At some point Kaathe arrived in &lt;a href=\"New%20Londo%20Ruins\"&gt;new Londo&lt;/a&gt; and managed to seduce the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Kings\"&gt;Four Kings&lt;/a&gt;, powerful humans who had received a &lt;a href=\"Bequeathed%20Lord%20Soul%20Shard\"&gt;fragment of Gwyn's Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt;, to follow his ideals, teaching them the art of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Hand\"&gt;Lifedrain&lt;/a&gt; so that they could preserve their humanity even while Undead and so cast off the &lt;a href=\"Darksign\"&gt;shackles&lt;/a&gt; placed upon them by the gods. But his dark influence did not stop with the kings and in fact their entire army followed them. The knights of New Londo became &lt;a href=\"Darkwraith%20%28enemy%29\"&gt;Darkwraith&lt;/a&gt;s, servants of the Dark who learned the art of Lifedrain and used it to absorb humanity. As the Four Kings' were able to open an &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt; in the center of their city, their very bodies were mutated by their freed Dark Soul and the Darkwraiths' &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Set\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; transformed too as they began to employ the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Eye%20Orb\"&gt;Red Eye Orb&lt;/a&gt;s granted by Kaathe to seek humanity and plunge further into the powers of the Dark, \nA nation of humans freed from the shackles of the Darksign and who not only began to understand the powers of their Dark Soul but had an entire army at their disposal that shared this power represented an unparalleled threat to the gods of Anor Londo who branded the Darkwraiths as diabolical enemies of man and of every living thing. For this reason Artorias, as one of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Knights%20of%20Gwyn\"&gt;Four Knights of Gwyn&lt;/a&gt;, was sent to fight the dark soldiers of New Londo and was given a &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Pendant\"&gt;Silver Pendant&lt;/a&gt; to deflect the Dark of the Abyss in its magical forms. However this did not prove sufficient to cross the Abyss of the Four Kings and Artorias was forced to forge a covenant with the \"beasts of the Abyss\", obtaining a &lt;a href=\"Covenant%20of%20Artorias\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt; that would allow him to cross the Abyss but also cursing his &lt;a href=\"Greatsword%20of%20Artorias%20%28Cursed%29\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; in the process. Artorias thus became known as the \"Abysswalker\" and hunted the Darkwraiths but failed to eliminate the Four Kings and thus close the Abyss of New Londo. Having failed to eliminate the dark threat, an agonizing and terrible decision was made: flooding the entire land of New Londo despite the realization that countless lives and the entire culture of the country would be lost. For this task, sorcerers were called and the feat was accomplished without even evacuating the city's civilians, sealing away the Four Kings, their Darkwraiths and the entire population with them, the victims were thus cursed and became &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;s roaming the ruins of their country.\nAfter his failure with the Four Kings., the &lt;a href=\"Primordial%20Serpent\"&gt;Primordial Serpent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kaathe\"&gt;Kaathe&lt;/a&gt; arrived in &lt;a href=\"Oolacile\"&gt;Oolacile&lt;/a&gt; and manipulated the country to upturn the grave of &lt;a href=\"Manus%2C%20Father%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Manus&lt;/a&gt;, a primordial man with an extraordinary Dark Soul and dark sorcery skills, that had been buried beneath the &lt;a href=\"Oolacile%20Township%20Dungeon\"&gt;dungeons&lt;/a&gt; of their city and resurrect him. However, the royal family of Oolacile took the precious broken pendant of Manus for themselves, giving it to &lt;a href=\"Dusk%20of%20Oolacile\"&gt;Princess Dusk&lt;/a&gt;. The wrenching nostalgia connected to his object of obsession and the sincere hope to reclaim it drove Manus mad and his Dark Soul went wild, transforming him into a dark beast eternally seeking his pendant. His immense mass of humanity out of control led to the manifestation of an &lt;a href=\"Chasm%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt; that spread, threatening to devour the entire land. The Dark emanating from Manus did not limit itself to generating countless &lt;a href=\"Humanity%20Phantom\"&gt;Humanity Phantom&lt;/a&gt;s with a will of their own but also influenced the &lt;a href=\"Bloathead\"&gt;residents of Oolacile&lt;/a&gt;, making their humanity go wild and horribly mutating their bodies, bloating their head and opening them with cracks lined with innumerable tiny red eyeballs and protuding brain parts.\nAs the Abyss continued to spread across the land of Oolacile, &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Artorias\"&gt;Knight Artorias&lt;/a&gt; came to stop it and confront Manus, as the Knight of Gwyn already had experience with fighting the Abyss and its creatures after the events of New Londo and his hunt for the Darkwraiths, and possessed a &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Pendant\"&gt;Silver Pendant&lt;/a&gt; that protected him from the Dark. Artorias, together with his trusted companion &lt;a href=\"Great%20Grey%20Wolf%20Sif\"&gt;Sif&lt;/a&gt;, thus faced Manus but his strength proved insufficient to defeat the Father of the Abyss and he succumbed to the Abyss. Wounded by the battle, Artorias used his &lt;a href=\"Cleansing%20Greatshield\"&gt;Cleansing Greatshield&lt;/a&gt; to form a barrier to protect Sif leaving a magic barrier to repel the Dark. Artorias, now corrupted to the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20Artorias\"&gt;Soul&lt;/a&gt; by the Abyss and with his &lt;a href=\"Set%20of%20Artorias\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; corroded, was left to fight alone and wounded the distorted creatures of Oolacile.\nAt one point Manus managed to take possession of his lost pendant, kidnapping Princess Dusk and taking her to his Abyss. However, due to a time distortion, Manus found himself chasing a further copy of his pendant, but this one was located in the future. Using his Dark power, Manus snatched the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt; that found it from the future bringing him to the Oolacile of the past. This Undead would be able to put the corrupted Artorias to rest and succeed his mission, facing Manus and defeating him, thus saving Oolacile from further corruption. Thanks to &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth\"&gt;Elizabeth&lt;/a&gt;'s confidentiality, the legend spread that Artorias had defeated Manus and his Abyss, omitting the role of the unsung hero to preserve the honor of the knight. &lt;a href=\"Ciaran\"&gt;Ciaran&lt;/a&gt;, who had arrived at the location, also requested the Soul of Artorias from the Chosen Undead who had finally put an end to the knight's suffering, with the intention of paying proper respects to her passed dear friend.\nAs centuries passed, the ruins of Oolacile became overgrown and the region became known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Darkroot%20Garden\"&gt;Darkroot Garden&lt;/a&gt;\", where the remnants of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Guardian\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s of the city still patrol the area as &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Knight\"&gt;Stone Knight&lt;/a&gt;s. Sif survived the battle with Manus thanks to the intervention of the Chosen Undead, thus managing to save himself. The wolf inherited Artorias' &lt;a href=\"Greatsword%20of%20Artorias\"&gt;divine greatsword&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Covenant%20of%20Artorias\"&gt;magical ring&lt;/a&gt; that had allowed the knight to cross the Abyss. The wolf settled in the forest where Artorias' tomb had been erected and, holding his companion's sword in his jaws, continued to fight to guard Artorias' rest, slaughtering the numerous Undead who arrived with the intention of plunder the tomb of the legendary knight.\nIn addition, Artorias and Sif had become trusted friends of &lt;a href=\"Alvina%20of%20the%20Darkroot%20Wood\"&gt;Alvina&lt;/a&gt;, a white &lt;a href=\"Great%20Feline\"&gt;Great Feline&lt;/a&gt; that had lived for centuries since the early Age of Fire. After Artorias' death, Alvina founded the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Hunter\"&gt;Forest Hunter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;, a clan of hunters bound with the aim of protecting the Darkroot Forest where her friend rested and Sif resided from the many adventurers who invaded it to look for the tomb of the legendary knight. Alvina would try to dissuade those who ventured into the region recently, advising them not to seek Artorias' tomb and that his legends were only fabrications and fairy tales.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis section of the lore lacks sources and is in need of further expansions and explanations\nHis legacy as a hero lasted for centuries. By the time of &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt;, there was the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Legion%20of%20Farron\"&gt;Undead Legion of Farron&lt;/a&gt;, who were commonly called the Abyss Watchers. They partook of wolf blood, and it is said that their souls are bound together and are one with the soul of the \"wolf blood master\", who is Artorias. Wielding greatswords modeled after his, and fighting in wild ferocious styles, the Legion fought a veritable war with the dark of the &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt; that their master had fought ages past.\nMelee Strategy.\nWhile this boss is rather difficult to predict, he does have a few signs for his attacks, and well-timed rolls prove useful here. Being able to fast-roll is highly advised but not necessary. The player can place themself away from him by about twice his reach at all times, even for melee.\nAerial Attacks.\nWhen he uses his Somersault Slam attack, the player will want to roll to the right as the camera tilts upward while locked onto him. The player can do this three times and then get in one or two attacks (based on one's weapon) after the third attack lands. Avoid attacking after his Steadfast Leap. Instead use that opportunity to heal or get some distance from him.\nStanding Attacks.\nWhen he uses his Overhand Smash, roll to the right. While he leaves himself open for a few frames, he will usually follow up with his Spinning Slash attack. Therefore, it is best to get some distance from him instead as the Spinning Slash attack is difficult to get away from when it begins.\nCharging Attacks.\nWith his Charging Slash move the player will always want to roll backwards from where he intends to land the attack. After successfully dodging this attack, the player will be able to get one or two hits on him.\nHis Heavy Thrust attack will need to be side dodged. Depending on which way he turns during the charge, the player will need to dodge the opposite way. After the dodge, he has a long recovery time and the player should be able to get two or three hits in.\nAbyss Sludge.\nWhen the player is behind Artorias, he may use his Abyss Sludge attack. This move does little damage but can stun and even knock down players with little to no poise. If timed right, the player can roll forward through the attack and get a hit on him, then immediately retreat.\nWrath of the Abyss - Buff.\nAfter Artorias has lost 1/3 of his health, he will start to use his Wrath of the Abyss power up. If left alone, he will do much more damage after he completes the power up for 90 seconds, potentially one-shotting the player. If the player can get close fast enough, they can &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; break him out of his charge up by dealing 90 Poise damage as his usual 130 Poise value is reduced during his buff animation. If the player doesn't do enough Poise damage fast enough, he will hit them with an &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;area of effect&lt;/a&gt; blast attack that will knock the player on their back. The best bet is to use a decent Poise damage weapon and stop him from gaining his attack buff. If using a low Poise damage weapon, check the &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Poise Damage Values&lt;/a&gt; of your weapon to calculate the beast way to deal 90 poise damage to him via a combination of light and heavy attacks. \nIf you are a lower level and unable to find a means of staggering during Artorias' charge-up, you can place a headshot and force him out of his animation using a &lt;a href=\"Bows\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;. Headshots with bows, crossbows, and other types of throwables deal additional poise damage in general, but will stun Artorias. If you succeed in hitting him in the head, he will stand up and continue the fight. To help time this tricky attack, watch for Artorias to roll backwards twice, as this is the only time that he will do it before attempting to charge up; use this time to arm and aim your shot. The power of the bow and arrow do not need to be high. &lt;a href=\"Avelyn\"&gt;Avelyn&lt;/a&gt; is very good for interrupting his charge-up, you'll be able to shoot twice before he completes it, be sure to aim for his head and you will be able to stun him in a single hit. Avelyn deals the full poise damage for each bolt that impacts, for a total of 60 poise damage.\nBoss Information.\nAttacks.\nSteadfast Leap.\nArtorias crouches, then leaps high into the air towards the player, causing damage in a small\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;area of effect&lt;/a&gt; around him. &lt;a href=\"Rolling\"&gt;Rolling&lt;/a&gt; or moving towards him instead of away can increase one's chance of successfully dodging before he lands.\nSomersault Slam.\nArtorias somersaults into the air after which he slams his sword down vertically. He can repeat this up to three times. Roll to the side to avoid it. The player can be stun-locked in this combo.\nOverhead Smash.\nSlams his sword overhead and towards the ground; high staggering power that leaves his guard open for a short time after it lands.\nCharging Slash.\nArtorias moves toward the player while swinging his sword 360 degrees. He presents an opportunity to be attacked after the player dodges his swing.\nHeavy Thrust.\nPauses before performing a heavy, medium range thrust towards the player. If it connects, it can hit twice, dealing heavy damage and knocking the player to the ground.\nSpinning Slash.\nArtorias quickly spins, completing a full revolution. It has the potential to connect twice.\nAbyss Sludge.\nArtorias throws a staggering sludge in a wide arc, a few feet in front of him. Usually performed if positioned behind him.\nWrath of the Abyss.\nActivates in intervals after approximately 20% of his total health is reduced. After rolling away, he will slowly build up dark magic energy, presenting ample time for retaliation, potentially staggering him, or to apply &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Augmentation\"&gt;augmentations&lt;/a&gt; to one's weapon or &lt;a href=\"Self%20Augmentation\"&gt;self&lt;/a&gt;. A single &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Spear\"&gt;Sunlight Spear&lt;/a&gt; can stagger him and prevent this build up from finalizing. If the player does not stagger him, he will release an explosion that does &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;magic damage&lt;/a&gt; in a mid-ranged &lt;a href=\"area%20of%20effect\"&gt;area of effect&lt;/a&gt; all around him. Artorias' attack speed, area of effect and damage are enhanced for a limited time afterwards. These effects can stack.\u00a0\nIn addition to the health thresholds, this attack has a time interval between uses, in that if Artorias is left undamaged for a period of time, he will re-activate Wrath of the Abyss.\n3D Model.\nThis integration requires JavaScript.

Rendal was so important that &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Coin\"&gt;Silver Coin&lt;/a&gt; were minted with his portrait on its face, similar to the faces of the gods &lt;a href=\"Allfather%20Lloyd\"&gt;Lloyd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"McLoyf\"&gt;McLoyf&lt;/a&gt;, although these coins of great value in the world of men had little value in Lordran.\nHowever, with the fading of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, more and more &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; started to appear among humans, to the point that in Balder it reached a widespread outbreak and the kingdom was reduced to ruins in the ensuing chaos. Knight King Rendal thus gathered the remaining &lt;a href=\"Balder%20Knight\"&gt;Balder Knight&lt;/a&gt; of his country and left for &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient kingdom of the gods where according to legend the Undead would have to pilgrimage and overcome various tests to learn about their fate. In an attempt to reach &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; to link the fading Flame and thus save what remained of their kingdom, nullifying the Curse of Undeath, Rendal and his knights arrived at the &lt;a href=\"Sen%27s%20Fortress\"&gt;Sen's Fortress&lt;/a&gt; which tested the potential Chosen Undead with deadly challenges. However, even if they were able to navigate the fortress, Sendal and his knights never managed to overcome the final test of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt; placed to defend the entrance to the city of the gods from countless heroes trying to reach it, and continued to try and fail for decades until even the Knight King himself died, losing his ring in the fortress, leaving the now hollowed knights to wander around aimlessly.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the times and region of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt;, despite Rendal's failure, his &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Steel%20Protection%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt; that offered great physical protection was passed around but his tales became long forgotten and even the greatly wizened had no recollection of his exploits, thus remaining the last trace of his existence.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the times and region of &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt;, despite the many centuries that passed, Rendal's &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Steel%20Protection%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt; that offered great physical protection was passed around and it was said that he was lined with steel on the inside, such that even the talons of mighty dragons did him little harm, thus keeping the last trace of his existence until the last days of the Fire, even if his name was forgotten and only is title of \"Knight King\" remained."}

He is voiced by either Daniel Roberts or .\nLocation.\nLautrec is found imprisoned on the top floor of the church in &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Parish\"&gt;Undead Parish&lt;/a&gt;, before climbing the ladders to the roof where the &lt;a href=\"Bell%20Gargoyles\"&gt;Bell Gargoyles&lt;/a&gt; are fought. The &lt;a href=\"Mystery%20Key\"&gt;Mystery Key&lt;/a&gt; that opens his cell (which can also be opened with the &lt;a href=\"Master%20Key\"&gt;Master Key&lt;/a&gt;) is found in the cellar-like area next to the &lt;a href=\"Fang%20Boar\"&gt;Fang Boar&lt;/a&gt; guarding the gates to the inner parish.\nAfter being freed, or escaping after the &lt;a href=\"Bell%20Gargoyles\"&gt;Gargoyles&lt;/a&gt; are defeated if he wasn't freed by the player, Lautrec is found sitting in &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt; across from the imprisoned &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Keeper\"&gt;Fire Keeper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anastacia%20of%20Astora\"&gt;Anastacia of Astora&lt;/a&gt;. If Lautrec was freed, then it is here that he will reward the player with a &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Medal\"&gt;Sunlight Medal&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the player frees Lautrec and receives his reward at Firelink Shrine, he can be &lt;a href=\"summon\"&gt;summon&lt;/a&gt;ed to assist against the &lt;a href=\"Bell%20Gargoyles\"&gt;Bell Gargoyles&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gaping%20Dragon\"&gt;Gaping Dragon&lt;/a&gt;. His first &lt;a href=\"summon\"&gt;summon&lt;/a&gt; sign is near the ladder before the &lt;a href=\"Fog%20Door\"&gt;Fog Door&lt;/a&gt;; the second &lt;a href=\"summon\"&gt;summon&lt;/a&gt; is opposite from &lt;a href=\"Solaire\"&gt;Solaire&lt;/a&gt;'s, hidden behind a pillar near the &lt;a href=\"Gaping%20Dragon\"&gt;Gaping Dragon&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"fog%20door\"&gt;fog door&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhether or not Lautrec was freed, after the player rings the second &lt;a href=\"Bells%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Bell of Awakening&lt;/a&gt; or picks up the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Keeper%20Soul\"&gt;Fire Keeper Soul&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blighttown\"&gt;Blighttown&lt;/a&gt;, Lautrec will kill &lt;a href=\"Anastacia%20of%20Astora\"&gt;Anastacia&lt;/a&gt; and begin a quest line in which the player can collect a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Eye%20Orb\"&gt;Black Eye Orb&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Dingy%20Set\"&gt;Anastacia's robes&lt;/a&gt;, and hunt Lautrec down to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Keeper\"&gt;Fire Keeper&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Firekeeper%20Soul\"&gt;Soul&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nLautrec dual-wields &lt;a href=\"Shotel\"&gt;Shotel&lt;/a&gt;s, allowing him to partially hit through block. Therefore, dodging his attacks or killing him as quickly as possible will work best. He also wears a &lt;a href=\"Red%20Tearstone%20Ring\"&gt;Red Tearstone Ring&lt;/a&gt;, so be extra careful when he is near-death. Additionally, he may use a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Parrying%2Bdagger\"&gt;parrying dagger&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte\"&gt;parry and riposte&lt;/a&gt; players.\nIf fought at &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt;, Lautrec can safely be kicked off the ledge. Quit and load the game, and his items should be right in front of the player.\nIf fought in &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;, Lautrec will have a &lt;a href=\"Lautrec%27s%20Comrade%2C%20Sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Pike\"&gt;Pike&lt;/a&gt;-wielding &lt;a href=\"Lautrec%27s%20Comrade%2C%20Warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; guarding him. The player is only required to kill Lautrec, so they may choose to concentrate on him and hope to kill him before his companions cause any trouble. An easy way to do this is to go up the staircases to the left or right, then aggro Lautrec with a &lt;a href=\"Bows\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;. Lautrec is faster than the rest of his party and will run up the stairs first, which then allows the player to engage him alone atop the chokepoint.\n&lt;a href=\"Poison%20Arrow\"&gt;Poison Arrow&lt;/a&gt;s can prove effective on both Lautrec and his companions. In addition, firing them from where the player spawns in his world will not make them aggro. This lets the player kill without retaliation.\nA very easy way to defeat him consists of wearing both the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Fog\"&gt;Ring of Fog&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Slumbering%20Dragoncrest%20Ring\"&gt;Slumbering Dragoncrest Ring&lt;/a&gt;. The player must then approach him and his companions by walking along either of the hall's walls until they reach the area behind him, then they may approach him from behind and &lt;a href=\"Backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt; him. If the player's weapon is strong enough, a single backstab will suffice. Even if he survives, his two comrades will not react as they are slightly in front of him, allowing the player to finish the job. Once behind Lautrec, the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Fog\"&gt;Ring of Fog&lt;/a&gt; can be switched for the &lt;a href=\"Hornet%20Ring\"&gt;Hornet Ring&lt;/a&gt; to increase the damage. One can also use &lt;a href=\"Hush\"&gt;Hush&lt;/a&gt; to remove the need of the Slumbering Dragoncrest Ring, although they must be careful not to move after the effect expires.\nLore.\nLautrec's armor reveals that he was an adherent of the goddess &lt;a href=\"Fina\"&gt;Fina&lt;/a&gt;. The armor description states that Lautrec, during a period of solitude, \"forsook everything\" because he believed in &lt;a href=\"Fina\"&gt;Fina&lt;/a&gt;'s love for him. This could either mean that Lautrec was delusional, or that the goddess emotionally manipulated him, as it is mentioned in &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Favor%20and%20Protection\"&gt;Ring of Favor and Protection&lt;/a&gt; that Fina has a \u201cfateful beauty\u201d.\nLautrec's goals were never explained in the game. He mentions that he is on a \"mission\", yet it is never elaborated upon. He interacted with, and was possibly tricked by &lt;a href=\"Patches\"&gt;Patches&lt;/a&gt; at least once prior to meeting the player, and he knows of &lt;a href=\"Petrus%20of%20Thorolund\"&gt;Petrus&lt;/a&gt; and his background. It could be that &lt;a href=\"Anastacia%20of%20Astora\"&gt;Anastacia&lt;/a&gt; was killed for her &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Keeper%20Soul\"&gt;Fire Keeper Soul&lt;/a&gt;, but it is found on his person after defeating him, meaning he either had neglected to use it or kept it as a trophy. \nCharacter information.\nEquipment.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nUndead Parish/Firelink Shrine=\nAnor Londo=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Its &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; resistances are moderate but respectable, and its defenses against &lt;a href=\"Negative%20Status%20Effects%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt; buildup are decent. As well, it provides a good amount of &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; at the cost of its &lt;a href=\"weight\"&gt;weight&lt;/a&gt;, allowing it to reliably &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt; through most attacks short of those from ultra weapons.\nHowever, the Knight Set is on the heavier end of the medium armor sets, requiring higher &lt;a href=\"Vitality%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt; in order to prevent mobility from being compromised if one wishes to wield heavier weapons. Furthermore, like the other metal armor sets, it is susceptible to both &lt;a href=\"Strike%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Strike&lt;/a&gt; attacks and &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage, but conversely is highly resistant to &lt;a href=\"Slash%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Slash&lt;/a&gt; attacks and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;.\nRegardless, it remains as one of the best basic armor sets in the game due to its strong physical defenses and early availability."}

He wields the &lt;a href=\"Fume%20Ultra%20Greatsword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fume Ultra Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Iron%20Greatshield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Black Iron Greatshield&lt;/a&gt; and attacks with very advanced tactics, which can become even more dangerous as he is usually fought in tight corridors.\nHe uses the &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;s of both his ultra greatsword and greatshield frequently. During the fight, he tends to wield his ultra greatsword with both hands, performing powerful attacks with it.\nLocations.\n&lt;a href=\"Catacombs%20of%20Carthus\"&gt;Catacombs of Carthus&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Smouldering%20Lake\"&gt;Smouldering Lake&lt;/a&gt;\nStrategy.\nTsorig is a very dangerous enemy who can quickly dispose of any foe with just a few swings of his &lt;a href=\"Fume%20Ultra%20Greatsword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;ultra greatsword&lt;/a&gt;. The player is advised to let him perform the first move and then counterattack, although only if they are sure he is not going to follow with another attack. In addition, the player should not get greedy and never attack him more than once or twice. His most powerful attacks have very slow buildup and will always leave him open afterward.\nSpecial caution must be taken when he holds his ultra greatsword with both hands, as he can easily &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Break\"&gt;break guards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"stagger\"&gt;stagger&lt;/a&gt; the player, should any of his attacks connect.\nHis most dangerous attack is his ultra greatsword's &lt;a href=\"Stomp\"&gt;Stomp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;. He will usually use this attack against aggressive attackers that try to combo him. Tsorig will suddenly lunge forward, becoming completely impervious to attack for a brief moment, and unleash a powerful downward slam that will smash players into the ground and deal heavy damage, if it hits.\nAn easy way to defeat Tsorig in the &lt;a href=\"Catacombs%20of%20Carthus\"&gt;Catacombs of Carthus&lt;/a&gt; consists of running to the area with the hanging bridge and hitting it while he is crossing it, sending him down to his death. If he falls on the small path below, he can be killed from a distance with ranged attacks. He can also be lured to where the second skeleton ball rolls back and forth and with good timing, be knocked down and damaged by it.\nDrops.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Catacombs of Carthus =\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

After the Ivory King discovered the &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Chaos\"&gt;raging flames of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; beneath his lands, he ordered the construction of the Garrison Ward to confine it. The Eleum Knights were posted throughout the garrison to lead the advance on the swollen flame on the king's orders.\nA group of knights, led by Sir Fabian, delved valiantly into the depths of Chaos to exterminate the terrible creatures that dwelled there, but they failed. The knights were &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Loyce%20Knight\"&gt;corrupted by the Chaos&lt;/a&gt; and lost their sense of self. Charred black by flames, they burned in eternal agony, alongside their once-proud king. The few remaining knights in Eleum Loyce survived. While the city eventually froze over, they stoically awaited a master to lead them into battle.\nLocation.\nA total of four knights are found in the DLC. They are used to aid the player in their quest to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Ivory%20King\"&gt;Ivory King&lt;/a&gt;.\nKnight #1.\nAfter meeting &lt;a href=\"Alsanna%2C%20Silent%20Oracle\"&gt;Alsanna, Silent Oracle&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Cathedral\"&gt;Grand Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; she will give some background to the Ivory King and Eleum Loyce. After accepting her offer, she will melt various frozen sections of the city, including a passage to the first knight, found just before the pit leading to &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Chaos\"&gt;The Old Chaos&lt;/a&gt;. This knight is ready to help from the moment he is met, but the remaining three knights must be found throughout &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Eleum%20Loyce\"&gt;Frozen Eleum Loyce&lt;/a&gt; before they will aid in the boss battle.\nKnight #2.\nStarting from the &lt;a href=\"Outer%20Wall\"&gt;Outer Wall&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;, proceed as normal heading right after the main gate, all the way until you pass the frozen fountain with four &lt;a href=\"Spellsword\"&gt;Spellsword&lt;/a&gt;s around it. The next area has a large broken bridge with a small tower beside it. This area was previously frozen, but is now accessible. Head down the elevator and enter the new area, including a new bonfire.\nLocate a switch on the upper platforms and flip it to open two large metal doors nearby, and proceed inside. Once through it, kill the frozen &lt;a href=\"Covetous%20Demon\"&gt;Covetous Demon&lt;/a&gt; mini boss and go through the tunnels. When they split, head straight to open the shortcut, then proceed back and down the other path. Next is an area filled with &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Rat\"&gt;Ice Rat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Golem\"&gt;Frozen Golem&lt;/a&gt;s. Deal with them to reach another elevator. Ride it up to reach the other side of the broken bridge from before. Exit the elevator room and head right, up the snow path to the peak where a small tower is located. Open the door to find the second knight sitting on a throne. Approaching the knight will cause him to awaken and teleport to the Grand Cathedral.\nKnight #3.\nStarting from the &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Dwelling\"&gt;Abandoned Dwelling&lt;/a&gt; bonfire, proceed through the area normal until the rampart with the large ballista crossbows are found. Go straight ahead to find a flight of stairs that lead down to an area with broken wooden floors. This is the top level of a tiered area. Proceed to the bottom, dealing with the various enemies along the way, and exit back outside. Follow the path towards a lone standing tower to find the third knight. Just before the tower is a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Spirit\"&gt;Dark Spirit&lt;/a&gt; invasion by &lt;a href=\"Castaway%20Witch%20Donna\"&gt;Castaway Witch Donna&lt;/a&gt;.\nKnight #4.\nStarting from the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Wall\"&gt;Inner Wall&lt;/a&gt; bonfire, head right down the hall and through the room with the now thawed out golems. Proceed up the stairs, then up again past another room with more thawed out golems. A new path on the right is now accessible, behind the &lt;a href=\"Retainer\"&gt;Retainer&lt;/a&gt;. Follow this hall down a short way to find the fourth knight.\nCombat.\nIn combat, they alternate between using physical attacks, shielding and using sorceries like Soul Vortex and Soul Spear.\nAfter every minute or less, one of the Knights will seal one of the gates where enemies appear (killing enemies too quick will make the boss fight a bit harder because 1 or 2 doors will still be opened).\nBugs.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Calibration%201.12\"&gt;Calibration 1.12&lt;/a&gt;, any Loyce Knights that died during the &lt;a href=\"Burnt%20Ivory%20King\"&gt;Burnt Ivory King&lt;/a&gt; boss fight would raise the player's &lt;a href=\"Sin%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;sin&lt;/a&gt;."}

Kobolds are only hostile if attacked.\nThey make a second appearance in the &lt;a href=\"Foregarden\"&gt;Foregarden&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Aldia%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Aldia's Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Similar to the ones aforementioned, the only differences are that they attack when approached too closely and that their bite can cause &lt;a href=\"Petrification\"&gt;Petrification&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeneral information.\nWhen first encountered, kobolds will be completely non-hostile, and will simply spend their time digging in the dirt, presumably looking for food.\u00a0If the player approaches, they will tense up, and run off if the player comes closer. If the player holds still, they will rush up, as if curious, before running away again.\nIf the player attacks a single kobold, the whole pack will turn on them and attack. They are small and fast, and hard to hit because of this, and can easily kill unwary or unprepared players.\nStrategy.\nWith little in the way of spoils when killed, kobolds are best ignored. For those who insist, attacks that use vertical hit-boxes are best as horizontal attacks will frequently fly right over the small creatures, accomplishing nothing. Players must also be aware of where the other kobolds are, as there are several in the meadow where they're first encountered, and they will all fight at the same time and the player will take many attacks from the back and sides if not careful.\nIt's generally a bad idea to challenge them straight out of the gate. Players should wait until they have better armor and weapons\u2014at the very least, wait until \"after\" character creation\u2014before challenging these things.\nIt should be noted that the kobolds encountered at Aldia's Keep have a different list of drop items. They drop various high level powerful items including the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight%20Halberd%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Black Knight Halberd&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight%20Greataxe%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Black Knight Greataxe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight%20Ultra%20Greatsword\"&gt;Black Knight Ultra Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Affinity\"&gt;Affinity&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hexes\"&gt;hex&lt;/a&gt;."}

While it does have a lower base damage, it does boast an A scaling in strength, which can be upgraded to an S scaling, making this a viable choice for a strength build.\nAnother good thing about this weapon is that it is very light for a Great Hammer (weighing in at only 12.0 units, bested only by the Archdrake Mace). This makes it a good backup weapon for players who have not invested much in Vitality, and that they have suddenly encountered heavily armored enemies.The Strike Damage ensures the Large Club's effectiveness against them even if the weapon is not upgraded, and the very high poise damage would either knock them down or stunlock them.\nUnfortunately, excessive usage of the Large Club's strong attacks have a way to quickly degrade the weapon's durability, especially on PC.

Upon activation, the head becomes shrouded in stone as the player performs a moderately fast spin-attack. Following it up with a strong attack completes the combo for an extremely hard-hitting ground smash that disperses the stone, producing an explosion of debris. If a player is hit by every single attack of this skill combo, survival is unlikely. This entire combo gives players &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, when players do not activate the smash attack, the weapon will remain buffed by the stone that wraps it, giving it significantly more damage for some time before disappearing. The player can break the stones around the weapon and deal the &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;area-of-effect&lt;/a&gt; blast anytime within the duration by performing a charged strong attack, making it a very versatile skill that can be used strategically.\nThe weapon gains a superb A scaling in &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; with enough upgrades and has no other stat requirements, making it most effective on pure strength builds.\nLedo's Great Hammer also has very obvious drawbacks. It is the heaviest weapon in the game at 28 units. Although its attacks grant large amounts of poise, they are slow and predictable. In addition, its massive size can obstruct the players view of their surroundings, much like (but not to the extent of) &lt;a href=\"Smough%27s%20Great%20Hammer\"&gt;Smough's Great Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. It also consumes more stamina per attack than a regular great hammer, such as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Mace\"&gt;Great Mace&lt;/a&gt;. Players without high investment in &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt; may find it necessary to equip stamina-boosting items, such as the &lt;a href=\"Chloranthy%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Chloranthy Ring&lt;/a&gt;, or use &lt;a href=\"Green%20Blossom%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Green Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; to use this weapon effectively.\nFortunately, the DLC this weapon is found in also includes useful rings to counter some of these drawbacks (&lt;a href=\"Havel%27s%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Havel's Ring +3&lt;/a&gt; for its weight, &lt;a href=\"Chloranthy%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Chloranthy Ring +3&lt;/a&gt; for its stamina usage, and &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Favor\"&gt;Ring of Favor +3&lt;/a&gt; for both its weight and stamina usage).\nUpgrades.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

They also worshiped &lt;a href=\"Galib%2C%20God%20of%20Disease\"&gt;Galib, God of Disease&lt;/a&gt;. At one point they reached the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Crypt\"&gt;Undead Crypt&lt;/a&gt; and were welcomed into the it by the &lt;a href=\"Grave%20Warden%20Agdayne\"&gt;Fenito&lt;/a&gt;, ending up residing in the crypt beside them, collaborating with them in their tasks and sharing their power of death. However at a certain point the Leydia Witches grew conceived and began to manipulate both the onset and curing of disease, making themselves the effective gatekeepers of the crypt. Their misuse of death and their failure to treat it with the proper respect invoked the ire of the Fenito, that branded them as transegressors, blasphemous and traitors and hunted them down, denying them a peaceful death and slaughtering them most of them.\nDescription.\nLeydia Pyromancers are ghostly figures wearing navy-blue cloaks, and wielding a sword and shield. They are about the size of the &lt;a href=\"Bearer%20of%20the%20Curse\"&gt;Bearer of the Curse&lt;/a&gt;, if not a bit bigger. They levitate slightly above the ground and move quite fluidly.\nTheir attacks are comprised of fast and nimble swings with their swords, as well as advanced highly damaging magic &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; that are better to dodge than to block. They also, as their name implies, cast Pyromancies.\nThese enemies drop some very useful gear, such as &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Flame\"&gt;Blue Flame&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Straight%20Swords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;straight sword&lt;/a&gt; capable of casting &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Sorceries&lt;/a&gt; (but not &lt;a href=\"Hexes\"&gt;Hexes&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Shield%20%28shield%29\"&gt;Magic Shield&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Small%20Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;small shield&lt;/a&gt; with exquisite stats for its weight, that when &lt;a href=\"infuse\"&gt;infuse&lt;/a&gt;d with magic blocks 100% magic damage. They also drop\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Faintstone\"&gt;Faintstone&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Darknight%20Stone\"&gt;Darknight Stone&lt;/a&gt;s, very useful infusion materials for casters.\nAttacks.\nThe Leydia Pyromancer also has various sword attacks that it can execute, from lunging thrusts to three-swing combos. Their sword attacks can deal surprising damage, however they will bounce off of even &lt;a href=\"Medium%20Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;medium shields&lt;/a&gt;, leaving them open to counterattack.\nStrategy.\nLeydia Pyromancers are by far one of the deadliest foes any player can encounter. They are capable of very damaging combos with their sword and often cast extremely powerful sorceries and pyromancies, often &lt;a href=\"stun\"&gt;stun&lt;/a&gt;ning the player from the damage and possibly killing them outright. The way they fight is especially peculiar as they seem to wander, circling the player, and they will do one of two things: cast a spell, if the player tries to keep their distance; or they simply lunge themselves with little warning or any sort of telegraph for the player to react.\nWhat makes Leydia Pyromancers even deadlier, however, is that they can swarm the player and overwhelm them with massed spells and attacks. Any time one of the bells in their area is rung, a Pyromancer spawns from each of the large tombstones, and can all immediately aggro on the player. In particular, &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Laborer\"&gt;Undead Laborer&lt;/a&gt;s can rise from the ground and move immediately towards a nearby bell and ring it.\nTo defeat Leydia Pyromancers, players must be patient and focus on one at a time. Consider approaching them to bait their melee attacks and blocking them (their attacks have very good tracking so dodging is ill-advised), and then responding with quick strikes to stun-lock and quickly kill them. Dodge only their magic spells, never their &lt;a href=\"physical\"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; attacks. Due to the nature of the area players will fight them in (which is filled with rocks and tight spots), it is not a good idea to kill them with ranged attacks, unless the player is either using a fast firing &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;, or has a reasonable spell &lt;a href=\"casting%20speed\"&gt;casting speed&lt;/a&gt; as well as a good line of sight.\nIn order to permanently defeat Leydia Pyromancers, it is necessary to destroy their tombstones, as this will cause them to stop spawning. Getting too close to a tombstone will cause a Pyromancer to spawn, so a long-reaching weapon like a &lt;a href=\"Halberds%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;halberd&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spears%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt; can allow a player to safely destroy a tombstone without spawning a Pyromancer. Before doing so, try to defeat all nearby enemies that may interfere with this, especially Undead Laborers who may attempt to ring a bell to summon the Leydia Pyromancers. Once a tombstone is destroyed, it will remain so for the rest of the game; every room will have multiple tombstones, so it can be a good idea to destroy one or two and then reset at a &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt; before resuming.\nKeep in mind that Leydia Pyromancers have relatively short aggro ranges, and will rarely leave the rooms where their tombstones are located. If they threaten to overwhelm you, it may be wise to retreat out of the room, and then use a bonfire to reset and try again.\nLocation.\nLeydia Pyromancers appear only in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Crypt\"&gt;Undead Crypt&lt;/a&gt;. They spawn from the large tombstones in several chambers. They will continue to respawn until the tombstone has been destroyed. They will only appear if a player gets too close to the coffins, or if one of the bells scattered around the Crypt is rung.\nThere are also six pillars in the final corridor before facing &lt;a href=\"Velstadt%2C%20the%20Royal%20Aegis\"&gt;Velstadt&lt;/a&gt; (four in ).

They also worshiped &lt;a href=\"Galib%2C%20God%20of%20Disease\"&gt;Galib, God of Disease&lt;/a&gt;. At one point they reached the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Crypt\"&gt;Undead Crypt&lt;/a&gt; and were welcomed into the it by the &lt;a href=\"Grave%20Warden%20Agdayne\"&gt;Fenito&lt;/a&gt;, ending up residing in the crypt beside them, collaborating with them in their tasks and sharing their power of death. However at a certain point the Leydia Witches grew conceived and began to manipulate both the onset and curing of disease, making themselves the effective gatekeepers of the crypt. Their misuse of death and their failure to treat it with the proper respect invoked the ire of the Fenito, that branded them as transegressors, blasphemous and traitors and hunted them down, denying them a peaceful death and slaughtering them most of them.\nAttacks.\n&lt;a href=\"Affinity\"&gt;Affinity&lt;/a&gt; - At long range, they will conjure a group of five &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; orbs, which will hover for a short period of time before locking onto the player and approaching at high speed. These orbs have poor tracking after they begin flight and do not do much damage, however they also have extremely long range and can &lt;a href=\"stagger\"&gt;stagger&lt;/a&gt; the player, leaving them vulnerable to other attacks.\n&lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Spear\"&gt;Lightning Spear&lt;/a&gt; - At medium ranges, Leydia Witches will conjure a lighting spear and hurl it at the player. They can be relatively easy to dodge through &lt;a href=\"rolling\"&gt;rolling&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shower\"&gt;Soul Shower&lt;/a&gt; - At medium to close range, Leydia Witches will cast forth a soul orb, which will begin releasing a shower of soul arrows after traveling a short distance. The arrows do not do much damage, but can stagger if they hit. Running to the other side of the Leydia Witch is the best counter to this spell.\n&lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Storm%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Chaos Storm&lt;/a&gt; - At close range, Leydia Witches will cast this spell in order to force players to retreat and dodge. They will leave lava pools after erupting, presenting an area hazard after ending.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Fog%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dark Fog&lt;/a&gt; - When the player is within melee range, Leydia Witches may cast this spell, which builds up the &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; meter very quickly. Due to the dim nature of the Undead Crypt, it can be hard to see the fog itself, so try to retreat away and wait for the spell effects to end, using ranged attacks in the meantime.\nAt melee range, a Leydia Witch may also attempt to swing her staff at the player in a two-hit combo.\nStrategy.\nLeydia Witches can be extremely deadly foes, as they have many ranged spells at their disposal that can deal tremendous damage to players. Furthermore, they are found in areas where the terrain and even enemies can prevent the player from directly approaching them; while the player is busy dealing with the lesser threats or attempting to find a way to approach the Witch, they will have free rein to cast their spells. Even once the player reaches their location, Leydia Witches have a surprising amount of health that makes them harder to kill than most other casters.\nWhen approaching a Leydia Witch, try to use the terrain to block their spells, and then dealing with the melee foes that approach. Once other threats have been dispatched, the Leydia Witch can be engaged at leisure. As they have no &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;, any melee attacks are capable of staggering them, preventing them from casting most spells.\nAn easier way to kill Leydia Witches is to use arrows from long range, where their Affinity can be easily dodged and their other spells are unable to reach the player. Because they have high &lt;a href=\"elemental%20resistance\"&gt;elemental resistance&lt;/a&gt;, it is best to use &lt;a href=\"physical%20damage\"&gt;physical damage&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poison Arrows&lt;/a&gt; also work well, as four arrows is enough to inflict them with poison."}

She is voiced by , who also voiced &lt;a href=\"Milibeth%20the%20Housekeeper\"&gt;Milibeth&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation.\nLicia is first encountered in &lt;a href=\"Heide%27s%20Tower%20of%20Flame\"&gt;Heide's Tower of Flame&lt;/a&gt; after defeating the &lt;a href=\"Dragonrider\"&gt;Dragonrider&lt;/a&gt;, and is next to the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Flame\"&gt;Tower of Flame&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe will relocate to &lt;a href=\"Majula\"&gt;Majula&lt;/a&gt; after exhausting her dialogue, down the steps behind &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Shalquoir\"&gt;Sweet Shalquoir&lt;/a&gt;'s house, where she can be found next to the Rotunda device that cannot be activated by the player. She can then open a route to &lt;a href=\"Huntsman%27s%20Copse\"&gt;Huntsman's Copse&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in return for\u00a02,000 &lt;a href=\"Souls%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf Licia is killed without invasion, &lt;a href=\"Merchant%20Hag%20Melentia\"&gt;Merchant Hag Melentia&lt;/a&gt; will sell Licia's armor, the &lt;a href=\"Saint%27s%20Set\"&gt;Saint's Set&lt;/a&gt;, after the area has been reset (that is, resting at a &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;).\nPlot.\nLicia appears to be a staunch and devoted saint who wishes to spread the good word of miracles. However, it is heavily implied that this is all a facade, and that she is in-fact a con-artist who gulls travelers for their souls. It is most likely that she was responsible for the theft of the &lt;a href=\"Soothing%20Sunlight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Soothing Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; miracle from the Lindelt Monastery, given its theft described on the miracle's description.\nWhen first encountered at Heide's Tower of Flame, she greets the player and states that she came to Drangleic to spread the art of miracles, though a slip of the tongue on her part may suggest otherwise. She sells a variety of &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt; to the player and the useful &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Prayer\"&gt;Ring of Prayer&lt;/a&gt;, which boosts a player's &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter relocating to Majula, she is seen next to a strange contraption that can toggle the path leading from Heide's Tower of Flame to &lt;a href=\"Huntsman%27s%20Copse\"&gt;Huntsman's Copse&lt;/a&gt;. Although she claims that the contraption runs on miracles, and that she will activate it for a price, the &lt;a href=\"Rotunda%20Lockstone\"&gt;Rotunda Lockstone&lt;/a&gt; she drops states that there is \"nothing magical about it\" and is purely mechanical. How she gained possession of this item is unknown.\nIf the player talks to her with 30 &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt;, she will gift them with the &lt;a href=\"Idol%27s%20Chime\"&gt;Idol's Chime&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Saint%27s%20Set\"&gt;Saint's Set&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is implied that Licia is the &lt;a href=\"Nameless%20Usurper\"&gt;Nameless Usurper&lt;/a&gt; that invades the player in &lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Castle\"&gt;Drangleic Castle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Crypt\"&gt;Undead Crypt&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the player obtains the &lt;a href=\"Crushed%20Eye%20Orb\"&gt;Crushed Eye Orb&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Crypt\"&gt;Undead Crypt&lt;/a&gt; and goes to Licia, then it will begin to \"stir\", allowing the player to use it to invade her world. Upon which, she will comment on how she has been \"found out\" and can kill the player \"guilt free\". This likely refers to her theft of the Soothing Sunlight miracle, or perhaps her tricking the player with the rotunda. When she is defeated using the Crushed Eye Orb, her &lt;a href=\"Saint%27s%20Set\"&gt;armor set&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Idol%27s%20Chime\"&gt;Idol's Chime&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Soothing%20Sunlight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Soothing Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;miracle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rotunda%20Lockstone\"&gt;Rotunda Lockstone&lt;/a&gt; are all dropped.\nStrategy.\nIf the player decides they have no further business with Licia and opts to kill her, they can take two courses of action:\nHeide's Tower of Flame.\nTo gain the &lt;a href=\"Rotunda%20Lockstone\"&gt;Rotunda Lockstone&lt;/a&gt; very early in the game for free, the best way to do it is when she is met at her first location in &lt;a href=\"Heide%27s%20Tower%20of%20Flame\"&gt;Heide's Tower of Flame&lt;/a&gt;. Equip any &lt;a href=\"Thrusting%20Swords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;thrusting sword&lt;/a&gt; available in your inventory (most likely the &lt;a href=\"Mail%20Breaker%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Mail Breaker&lt;/a&gt; found in the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20of%20Fallen%20Giants\"&gt;Forest of Fallen Giants&lt;/a&gt;) and start attacking her. When she has been struck for the third time, she will stand up and try to retaliate. With each subsequent hit, she will get staggered and be pushed back a little. Just keep pushing her to the opening on her left until she falls into the ocean (the opening in front of her has a segment of staircase below which will save her from the fall). Now rest at the nearby &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Idol%27s%20Chime\"&gt;Idol's Chime&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rotunda%20Lockstone\"&gt;Rotunda Lockstone&lt;/a&gt; will appear for you to collect. Be aware that by killing her, you will commit a sin, lose the \"Gathering of Exiles\" Achievement/Trophy, and will not have access to her wares anymore unless revived.\nMajula.\nIf the player decides to kill her later in the game, it is required to fight her using the &lt;a href=\"Crushed%20Eye%20Orb\"&gt;Crushed Eye Orb&lt;/a&gt;.\nLicia is by far one of the most dangerous characters in the game when provoked, as she is capable of casting some of the best &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt; available. She is especially deadly when fought in &lt;a href=\"New%20Game%20Plus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;NG+&lt;/a&gt; and is known to kill players outright with a single attack. Good &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; resistance and a strong &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; are recommended, as her lightning miracles can deal tremendous damage and her &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Gods%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Wrath of the Gods&lt;/a&gt; spell can deal &lt;a href=\"physical%20damage\"&gt;physical damage&lt;/a&gt; if it connects.\nShe will cast four miracles in particular: a unique orb of &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blinding%20Bolt\"&gt;Blinding Bolt&lt;/a&gt; (which can kill players extremely fast if one does not have ample &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29%23Defense\"&gt;Lightning defense&lt;/a&gt;), a variation of &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Gods%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Wrath of the Gods&lt;/a&gt; which deals physical damage, and &lt;a href=\"Soothing%20Sunlight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Soothing Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; to heal herself when she is below 50% health.\nHer offensive spells can be blocked, or at least greatly negated, by using the pillar in the middle of the arena; if Licia casts her &lt;a href=\"Blinding%20Bolt\"&gt;Blinding Bolt&lt;/a&gt; at the pillar, it will fizzle and accomplish nothing. The area of effect of Blinding Bolt and Wrath of the Gods are relatively small, so rolling away can often allow the player to completely evade damage.\nLicia's greatest weakness is that she has virtually no &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;, allowing players to easily interrupt her casting with almost any type of weapon. Given good &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; management, it is possible to prevent her from using her spells at all. As well, she leaves herself completely open when casting, allowing for easy &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;s unless she casts &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Gods%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Wrath of the Gods&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother easy way to render Licia impotent is through the use of &lt;a href=\"Profound%20Still\"&gt;Profound Still&lt;/a&gt; if available. By doing so, she will start attacking players with her fists (beware, as she still deals formidable damage), but can be easily stun-locked with any fast hitting weapon and is easily &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;bed by simply rolling away from her punches. When the player feels like Profound Still is about to wear off, or has already worn off, then simply wait for her to cast a spell, hide behind the pillar and cast yours. Repeat until she dies.\nPerhaps the greatest threat that Licia poses is in casting &lt;a href=\"Soothing%20Sunlight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Soothing Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; on herself when she reaches 50% health, sometimes repeatedly, which can quickly bring her back up to full health and negate any damage that the player has dealt to her up to that point. This can be especially troublesome if using a weapon with low base &lt;a href=\"Durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;, as it is possible that the weapon will break in the midst of battle due to being unable to finish the job. If possible, try to gradually whittle her down to just above 50% health, and then build up a full &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; gauge in order to quickly finish her once she tries to start healing herself."}

The attack possesses 30 &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; health. Upon connecting with a valid target, the wielder will embrace them and drain their &lt;a href=\"Hit%20Points%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;. If the grab fails due to hitting an invalid target, elevation differences with a valid target or a valid target being out of range of the grab but not the attack, the attack will instead inflict the base Attack Rating of the weapon as damage (i.e., the same damage as a weak attack).\nA valid target will take damage six times, each instance equal to 1.1 times the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; component of the weapon's Attack Rating as Dark damage, plus a flat amount of damage that cannot be mitigated by defenses. This flat component is applied alongside each Dark component, also for a total of six times, and is based on the maximum HP of the target, equivalent to a base of 2 plus 1 for every 50 HP on the target (effectively 2% of the target's maximum health, rounded down). Thus, over the course of the entire attack the target takes flat damage equivalent to 12 plus roughly 12% of their maximum HP, alongside the Dark component. Sample flat damage as follows:\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe wielder will be healed over time for the duration of the attack, for an amount based on their maximum HP. The wielder is healed six times over the course of the attack, each time for a base value of 4 plus 1 HP per 20 HP of the wielder. In total, the wielder is healed for 24 plus roughly 30% of their maximum HP. Sample heal amounts as follows:\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nAs this skill can only be wielded against human characters, there are very few opportunities to use it. While AI-controlled enemies are far easier to predict than human players, the skill can still be easily interrupted due to the &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt; frames starting relatively late in the attack. As such, this skill is most ideally used to inflict a high-damage first strike against non-aggressive NPCs if the goal is to kill them for their equipment, such as &lt;a href=\"Sirris%20of%20the%20Sunless%20Realms\"&gt;Sirris of the Sunless Realms&lt;/a&gt; if devotion to &lt;a href=\"Rosaria%27s%20Fingers\"&gt;Rosaria's Fingers&lt;/a&gt; has been increased.\nOnline gameplay.\nDue to being slow and well-telegraphed, Lifedrain is difficult to hit in &lt;a href=\"PvP%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;. As it only inflicts the Dark component of the weapon as damage, it is best utilized on builds that have leveled &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt;. In order to reduce the chances of being interrupted while performing the grab, it can be combined with &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Flesh%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Iron Flesh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Perseverance%20%28skill%29\"&gt;Perseverance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Flesh\"&gt;Stone Flesh&lt;/a&gt;. Most players will immediately retreat out of range when they see the startup for the grab, therefore it is most ideally done in a surprise situation, such as from around a blind corner that they are approaching."}

The bleed buildup on the user can be largely lowered if used in conjunction with the &lt;a href=\"Bloodbite%20Ring\"&gt;Bloodbite Ring&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Bloodshield\"&gt;Bloodshield&lt;/a&gt;.

If the hit connects, the stumble animation does not come into play and the user moves as normal. This means that Lifehunt Scythe is capable of getting &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28Dark%20Souls%29%23Sweet%2520Spot%2520Damage%2520Bonus\"&gt;Sweet Spot&lt;/a&gt; Bonus Damage.

Both of these items can be worn together, which stacks the bonus.\nLightning augmentation and consumables.\nMost weapons can be given the ability to deal Lightning Damage temporarily through the use of &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Blade%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Sunlight Blade&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Pine%20Resin%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Gold Pine Resin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe damage of both of these buffs does not scale with the Lightning Attack Bonus, rather applies a flat bonus based on the weapon's original Lightning Damage (WoLD), if any. If the weapon bears an innate Lightning effect, the Lightning damage value is boosted. The duration of Sunlight Blade is however dependent on the Faith stat. Applying Lightning buffs result in the weapon taking on a yellow glow.\nUnlike weapon buffs, the damage &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Urn\"&gt;Lightning Urn&lt;/a&gt;s deal scale based on the Lightning Attack Bonus value. They can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Head%20of%20Vengarl\"&gt;Head of Vengarl&lt;/a&gt; for 400 &lt;a href=\"Souls%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; each.\n&lt;a href=\"Ammunition%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Arrows and bolts&lt;/a&gt; laced with Lightning deal a flat Lightning Damage value, plus their &lt;a href=\"physical%20damage\"&gt;physical damage&lt;/a&gt;. Arrows and bolts can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Chancellor%20Wellager\"&gt;Chancellor Wellager&lt;/a&gt;, while Great Arrows can be purchased &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Sorcerer%20Navlaan\"&gt;Royal Sorcerer Navlaan&lt;/a&gt;.\nLightning Defense.\nLightning Defense (abbreviated as Lightning DEF in-game) governs how robust the player is against Lightning-based attacks.\nInnate Defense.\nInnate Lightning Defense describes the value of the players Lightning Defense when not influenced by any outside factors, such as &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;, or consumables. A hidden Lightning Defense stat of 100 points is always granted, regardless of character &lt;a href=\"Class%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;. Lightning Defense can be increased incrementally through leveling &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt;. For example, if Faith is at 50, Lightning Defense will be set to 170 points. Innate Lightning Defense caps at 200 points, when Faith is at 99.\nLightning Defense cap.\nTotal Lightning Defense is capped at 890 points. Combined with the hidden stat of 100 points, Lightning Defense can reach a maximum of 990 points. Since 1000 points of any magical or elemental defense equals immunity, Lightning Damage cannot be completely nullified, with the exception of blocking with a shield. For information on how to achieve this cap, see &lt;a href=\"%23Achieving%20the%20cap\"&gt;this section&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor and shields.\nVarious armor pieces grant varying levels of Lightning Defense. The following armor table shows the armor pieces which grant the highest possible Lightning Defense, for each body part.\nShields will only block Lightning attacks if the player is actively blocking. Merely equipping the shield does not count towards defense. The Lightning Defense value on shields is expressed as a percentage in-game, as opposed to points on armor. The following shields table shows all shields that grant at least 75% reduction.\nItems and spells.\nCertain defensive spells can increase Lightning Defense, with varying results, but they cannot be stacked with each other. Only one spell can be active at a time. &lt;a href=\"Small%20Yellow%20Burr\"&gt;Small Yellow Burr&lt;/a&gt;s are consumable &lt;a href=\"Items%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; that can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Rosabeth%20of%20Melfia\"&gt;Rosabeth of Melfia&lt;/a&gt; for 1200 souls each. Small Yellow Burrs cannot be stacked with any of the defensive spells either. Consuming a Small Yellow Burr will remove the Lightning Defense provided by the spell, and apply the Small Yellow Burr defense value.\nRings.\nOnly two rings provide Lightning Defense. Both can be worn together, granting a maximum of 270 Lightning Defense, at the highest item level. Like all other rings, duplicate rings cannot be worn simultaneously.\nLowering Defense.\nOverall Lightning Defense can be reduced on the player or &lt;a href=\"Enemies%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; if they are soaked wet or standing in &lt;a href=\"Water%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. Being wet is a &lt;a href=\"Negative%20Status%20Effects%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt; that lasts for a few moments, depending on how much water the player is covered in. It can occur by simply stepping in water, rolling through pots of water pots or by wearing the &lt;a href=\"Pharros%20Mask\"&gt;Pharros Mask&lt;/a&gt;. Other methods of reducing defense include equipping certain weapons that have this negative effect.\nAchieving the cap.\nIn practice, raising Lightning Defense to ~990 (or 99%) is achievable by combining several pieces of gear - albeit temporarily as a spell is required. This can be useful in situations when facing enemies who deal very high levels of Lightning Damage.\nThis table illustrates how the cap can be reached using a combination of gear with high resistance, however other methods using a combination different armor, spells or items is certainly possible.\nNote that the table does not take into account the player's displayed innate Lightning DEF, which is a variable (between 0 - 200) based on the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt; stat.\nInfusion.\n &lt;a href=\"Steady%20Hand%20McDuff\"&gt;Steady Hand McDuff&lt;/a&gt; can &lt;a href=\"infuse\"&gt;infuse&lt;/a&gt; most weapons with Lightning through the use of a &lt;a href=\"Boltstone\"&gt;Boltstone&lt;/a&gt;. Once a weapon is infused, the Lightning icon () will be displayed next to its image in the HUD.\nEnemies.\nThe following is a breakdown of enemies and &lt;a href=\"Boss%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt; information relating to Lightning damage and resistance. While the Lightning resistances stated for enemies are the default values, they may appear lower in-game if the enemy comes into contact with &lt;a href=\"Water%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; or rain."}

If the strong attack is used to continue the charge, it surges forward for additional distance and damage, hitting up to three more times for 40% of the weapon's Attack Rating.\nAt the end of the extended charge, the spear discharges a bolt of &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt;. The projectile inflicts 40% of the weapon's Attack Rating as Lightning damage, however if the target is within point-blank range upon being hit by the bolt, it will deal additional impact damage equal to 100% of the weapon's Attack Rating as Lightning damage.\nThis skill possesses 30 &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; Health. It costs 17 &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;Focus Points&lt;/a&gt; for the initial charge, and an additional 12 to extend it. With the &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Ring\"&gt;Farron Ring&lt;/a&gt; equipped, it costs 13 FP and 9 FP, respectively.\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nA modified version of &lt;a href=\"Charge\"&gt;Charge&lt;/a&gt;, this skill is best utilized when extremely close to an enemy, in order to hit them multiple times with the charge and carry them forward to be finished by the bolt. Ideally, this skill should be used against high-HP enemies that are not overly immune to stagger, as most weak enemies can simply be dispatched by the spear's regular attacks.\nOnline gameplay.\nLike other variants of Charge, this skill can be risky to use against other players, as the entire charge can be &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parried&lt;/a&gt;. Before committing to this skill, care should be taken to ensure that the enemy does not have a weapon or shield in their off-hand with which to counter it.\nWhile this skill can be useful for chasing down a fleeing foe, its lightning bolt makes it particularly ideal for Poise trading at point-blank range, in order to inflict the impact damage for maximum shock and awe. Doing so will require having significant amounts of Poise though, so be sure to equip accordingly."}

Lightning Spear deals lightning damage, which helps diversify the types of damage a player can deal.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, Lightning Spear is risky to use due to its long casting time and its lack of &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; damage without hitting a body of water which aren't very abundant.

The spell has a very short range, but inflicts damage in an area around the impact point.\nThe stake can inflict up to four instances of damage, depending on how long any valid targets are standing within the impact radius.

And so Kaathe taught the three sisters, already highly skilled fencers, the art of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Hand%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark Hand&lt;/a&gt;, capable of absorbing the humanity of their enemies. Wearing their &lt;a href=\"Black%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;dark attire&lt;/a&gt;, Liliane and her sisters would thus become the founders of the &lt;a href=\"Sable%20Church\"&gt;Sable Church&lt;/a&gt; between just the three of them: a faith and an organization that preached the coming of the Dark Lord that would claim the Flame and aimed to offer salvation to all Hollows. At some point the three sisters, now mentors of the Sable Church, settled in a land that would become known as &lt;a href=\"Londor\"&gt;Londor&lt;/a&gt;, the Hollow Realm, and over time and increasing number of undead and hollows would find refuge with them. In Londor, the Sable Church would be built as a real building with black and twisted towers, and Elfriede, as the eldest sister, became the leader of the organization, but the fact that they were three founding sisters ensured that their legacy would survive and two other women could carry the torch of their goals and make sure that the Dark Lord emerged even if one of them went missing.\nA culture and even religion completely opposite to the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20White\"&gt;Way of White&lt;/a&gt; which worshiped the gods through miracles also began to take shape in Londor. Liliane, as one of the founders of the Sable Church, started to recount tales that portrayed the suffering and conflict of Hollows to which they aimed to give salvation. The woman even created a &lt;a href=\"Londor%20Braille%20Divine%20Tome\"&gt;tome of dark miracles&lt;/a&gt; that were forbidden in the rest of the world as they offered salvation to the hollows and converely cursed all the other living beings. The culture of Londor therefore not only rejected the gods and their rules and stories but shifted the object of veneration towards themselves, bringing attention to their tales and placing their faith on their own kind to perform miracles. The Sable Church thus developed several different dark miracles such as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Blade\"&gt;Dark Blade&lt;/a&gt; which allowed to reinforce weapons with the power of the dark and and even &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Again%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;sacrilegious miracles&lt;/a&gt; that blessed corpses transforming them into dark traps, as they believed that if undeath was human there would be no need to hesitate blessing corpses that were after all incopatible with living things. The &lt;a href=\"Vow%20of%20Silence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;ancient dark miracles of Velka&lt;/a&gt;, that allowed to block the magic of those around, including themselves were also recovered. \nWhen an &lt;a href=\"Unkindled\"&gt;Unkindled&lt;/a&gt; finally obtained the power necessary to usurp the First Flame and absorb its power, Liliane arrived on site together with her sister Yuria, taking her place at the side of the Dark Lord who would unify the Hollows and finally bring them the expected salvation."}

Led by &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Yorgh\"&gt;Sir Yorgh&lt;/a&gt; and their desire to find the fresh and holy blood of a dragon, this group laid siege to the Eternal Sanctum where the Sunken City protected &lt;a href=\"Sinh%2C%20the%20Slumbering%20Dragon\"&gt;Sinh, the Slumbering Dragon&lt;/a&gt;. However, after Yorgh defeated the &lt;a href=\"Sunken%20King\"&gt;king of Shulva&lt;/a&gt; and plunged his spear into the dragon, along with its blood came out a quantity of poison so large that it blanketed the city in a miasmic cloud, killing almost everyone. The few surviving Drakeblood knights realized that, by earning the ire of the dragon, they had destroyed an entire country and their order. As they escaped, taking with them whatever they had pillaged from Shulva, they attempted to make amends by carrying on the knowledge of the wasted land in a show of terrible conceit.\nEscaped from their failure, the Drakeblood Knights settled and began building what would become the country of Lindelt and, thanks to the Shulva civilization's advanced knowledge of miracles, became clerics and spread their new religion, burdened with sin they deluded themselves into trying to be upstanding people of integrity simply in the hopes of being saved themselves. The order renamed itself into the \"Archdrake Church\" and became the foundation of Lindelt's theocracy. The order conveniently left their past behind, keeping it a secret along with the history of the nation's founding, and invented the legend that their knights once \"attacked and destroyed a poisonous dragon that threatened mankind\", covering their past mistakes with lies. The higher-ups of the new church feared that their past would come to light, keeping the records only among themselves while those who tried to approach these secrets all disappear without a trace. The population knows little about the priesthood and its ancient ritual and only high-ranking members of the church continued to preserve the truths of their history through secret rituals in which they used &lt;a href=\"Slumbering%20Dragon%20Shield\"&gt;shields representing Sihn&lt;/a&gt;, the slumbering dragon of their past.\nAs the largest religious institution in Drangleic and its surroundings, the Church of Lindelt possesses greater knowledge of the world's past, miracles and the gods than other lands, but the meaning of what they hold is fragmentary and poorly understood, simply passed on as best it can. The &lt;a href=\"Monastery%20Charm\"&gt;blessed talismans&lt;/a&gt; produced by clerics in great numbers to heal from poison and restore health are simply an imitation of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Charm\"&gt;those that they recovered from Shulva&lt;/a&gt; and were infused with the power of Sihn. The &lt;a href=\"Monastery%20Set\"&gt;pure white holy robes&lt;/a&gt; made in the temple are again merely a copy of those handed down since the times of the &lt;a href=\"Painting%20Guardian\"&gt;Painting Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s of ancient Anor Londo, their purity symbolizing the deceit on which the church is based. Clerics of Lindelt are instructed that miracles are powers that find their origin in the beginnings of the world that belonged to the followers of the gods, yet they are not even aware of what the First Flame is. The original tomes that contained the ancient miracles have remained in their entirety in only small numbers and most are restorations and the very names of the gods from which they drew power have long ago been forgotten. Despite this, the old miracles of the maidens of &lt;a href=\"Gwynevere%2C%20Princess%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bountiful%20Sunlight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Bountiful Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Soothing%20Sunlight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Soothing Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; have survived and have been handed down and stored in the holy temple of Lindelt\nNewly initiated Lindelt clerics receive &lt;a href=\"Cleric%27s%20Sacred%20Chime\"&gt;Cleric's Sacred Chime&lt;/a&gt;s as catalists for miracles while common priests gain &lt;a href=\"Protective%20Chime\"&gt;Protective Chime&lt;/a&gt;s and higher members of the church and part of the Archdrake cult use &lt;a href=\"Archdrake%20Chime\"&gt;Archdrake Chime&lt;/a&gt;s. In all three cases the sacred chimes employed by the priesthood also have the potential to be used to cast hexes, a purpose for which they were employed in the past in a manner completely opposite to the power of the gods, a fact which the church appears to ignore or avoid to consider. In Lindelt, as a country of mens of faith and their miracles, sorcery is believed to be a profane practice. . However the Archdrake Temple's own elites employ &lt;a href=\"Archdrake%20Staff\"&gt;Archdrake Staves&lt;/a&gt; that use intelligence-based magic, thus demonstrating the hypocrisy of the high ranks who believe their culture's beliefs are only something that belongs only to the \"faithful\" and good as a front to cover their own interests.\nLindelt's society is governed by its priesthood through stringent laws and those who dare defy them are punished without mercy, a real brutal and repressive theocracy that regulates every behavior, to the point that the land is known as the \"country of commandments\". The level of paranoia of the religious elite is such that it has led it to develop the &lt;a href=\"Unveil\"&gt;Unveil&lt;/a&gt; miracle, capable of detecting \"traitors\" and revealing the location of enemies. Despite those serving the Lindelt Church willfully adhere to its strict laws the miracle was created to chastise those who ignore the \"righteous teachings\". In other words, the Archdrake high-rank priest oppresses everyone through a system of moral control that overcomes the barriers of a person's mind, allowing them to detect oppositors and sinners before they can even carry out the act. The result is a climate of constant oppression and those with \"unusual urges\" are either forced to endeavor to resist them or act upon them out of the view of other. Either as a way to remove members of the clergy found to be sinning or threatening the elite, Lindelt ascetics, dressed with &lt;a href=\"Saint%27s%20Set\"&gt;saint robes&lt;/a&gt; and equipped with a &lt;a href=\"Perseverance\"&gt;miracle&lt;/a&gt; to protect them from natural dangers, are often sent to travel to distant lands for proselytizing and self-training but obviously more than a few of these trainees liberate themselves from Lindelt's teachings in the process and many decide to not return to their homeland.\nThanks to their well-honed miracles and unwavering faith in the face of death, the &lt;a href=\"Lindelt%20Cleric\"&gt;cleric knights of the Archdrake Church&lt;/a&gt; of Lindelt they represented a formidable force on the battlefield, even managing to stand up to the army of &lt;a href=\"Vendrick\"&gt;King Vendrick&lt;/a&gt; as worthy rivals. Thanks to miracles like &lt;a href=\"Replenishment%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Replenishment&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Resplendent%20Life\"&gt;Resplendent Life&lt;/a&gt; they could recover their health through time, making them tireless and unfalling during battles. Among them the high-ranked cleric warrior &lt;a href=\"Forsalle%20of%20Lindelt\"&gt;Forsalle&lt;/a&gt; stood out thanks to his mastery of miracles and led many battles across his country's borders, earning the title of \"holy knight\" from his allies and becoming feared for his \"demonic power\" by his enemies. However, more recently, even some &lt;a href=\"Lindelt%20Cleric\"&gt;cleric knights of Lindelt&lt;/a&gt; defected from their country's ruling sect because of its strict laws and to escape its authoritarian rule, managing to find their way into the destroyed kingdom of Drangleic, trying to start a new life as Undead in the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Amana\"&gt;Shrine of Amana&lt;/a&gt;, showing signs of how even among those who represent the country's elite there are those who are not satisfied with its government.\nOne of the most distinguished noble families of Lindelt is House Osteira and its members were the owners of the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Restoration\"&gt;Ring of Restoration&lt;/a&gt;, a holy magical ring with the power to restore the health of the wearer, that passed down for generations. The ring was the symbol of wealth and prosperity for the family but it was also fragile and easy to break as to remind to the noble that they could lose their power and wealth easily if they weren't careful.\nThe sage &lt;a href=\"Ivory%20Rhones\"&gt;Ivory Rhones&lt;/a&gt; of Lindelt also made divine magic rings like the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Soul%20Protection\"&gt;Ring of Soul Protection&lt;/a&gt; that prevented cursed death and the loss of the belongings of the wearer, the same effects of the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Sacrifice\"&gt;ancient rings produced with sacrificial rites in the name of Velka&lt;/a&gt; which similarly broke after their use. His students continued his work and developed the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Life%20Protection\"&gt;Ring of Life Protection&lt;/a&gt; that prevented the loss of health and souls upon death"}

Should the orb come into contact with anything before becoming static, it will disperse, causing little damage. However, once an enemy approaches a static orb, it will explode, inflicting a great deal of damage. The orb remains static for ten seconds before disappearing.\nThis spell can be cast several times in succession, allowing for multiple mines to be set up, usually between 4-5. The more mines are set up, the more damage inflicted and with the max amount of mines you can set up before they start fading, one can deal some of the highest damage possible in game if all mines are detonated at once. A good time to use this strategy is during the &lt;a href=\"Executioner%27s%20Chariot\"&gt;Executioner's Chariot&lt;/a&gt; boss fight, where you can set up the mines in the corridor before the chariot passes by, safely reducing the boss's health to the point where it is too weak to fully leap across the chasm present in the area, leaving it entirely defenseless. \nAttunement milestones.\nLike all other spells, the amount of casts per slot increases upon reaching certain &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Attunement&lt;/a&gt; milestones:"}

There are two variants: the average dark maned warrior and a more powerful gold maned version found near &lt;a href=\"Manscorpion%20Tark\"&gt;Manscorpion Tark&lt;/a&gt; (or instead in the ruins with the giant barrels in ).\nLore.\nLion Warriors originate from a group of surviving Lion Knights of &lt;a href=\"Forossa\"&gt;Forossa&lt;/a&gt; that at some point mutated into a humanoid lion creature, becoming a new offshoot race that appeared in historical records quite abruptly. These bestial knights, known as the \"Lion Clan Warrior\"s, severed their ties with humans and aggressively kept on themselves, murdering anyone with the curious notion of approaching them, despising their own look and hating to be seen. Still firmly preserving the legacy of their warrior origins, these lion clansmen are capable craftsmen, wearing complex decorations on their armor and using &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Greataxe\"&gt;finely-crafted blades&lt;/a&gt; that cut smoothly, evidence that they were much more than vulgar beasts. In addition their &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Clan%20Shield\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; were decorated with a bizarre pattern that symbolized the mark of &lt;a href=\"Faraam%2C%20God%20of%20War\"&gt;Faraam&lt;/a&gt;, venerated as the god of war in Forossa. In fact among the lion clansmen there were mages, just as among the Forossan Knights the sages led the warriors into battle and venerated the god of war. After the collapse of &lt;a href=\"Vendrick\"&gt;Vendrick&lt;/a&gt;'s kingdom, a group of these lion warriors entered &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; and settled in the &lt;a href=\"Shaded%20Woods\"&gt;Shaded Woods&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nLion Warriors are incredibly hard to stagger, and thus are best fought by provoking an attack, dodging, and countering. After they swing their axe, roll or sprint to their shielded side and backstab them. Rinse and repeat. They are resistant to most forms of magic, but seem slightly vulnerable to fire. Regardless, it is encouraged to keep a weapon without any source of elemental damage and that can quickly perform a backstab, as such, daggers can prove to be very powerful against them.\nAlso their attacks cause &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;curse&lt;/a&gt; build-up."}

He will frequently attempt to break through the player's defenses with jumping attacks and will often make use of his weapon's &lt;a href=\"Warcry\"&gt;Warcry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; to stagger them and ensure lethal follow-up attacks.\nLocations.\n&lt;a href=\"High%20Wall%20of%20Lothric\"&gt;High Wall of Lothric&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt;\nStrategy.\nAlbert's two companions, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hand%20Kamui\"&gt;Black Hand Kamui&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daughter%20of%20Crystal%20Kriemhild\"&gt;Daughter of Crystal Kriemhild&lt;/a&gt;, will usually provide ranged support while he engages the player in close combat. It is not advisable to fight all three enemies at once, and instead try to draw them in one by one with ranged attacks. However, even if only one of them has been attacked, the other two will eventually join the fight, so one should try to deal as much damage as possible before they arrive.\nAlbert will very frequently cast \"Warcry \"to buff his damage as well as giving him access to more lethal combos. For the most part, his attacks are quite slow and well telegraphed. So long as one stays a far distance from him while he is attacking, he should not be much of a problem. He deals heavy damage with almost every attack and also drains heavy stamina if his attacks are blocked. If the player is guard broken at any point, Albert will immediately riposte the player. Most likely signifying an instant death. Therefore, blocking should not even be attempted in favor of rolling.\nIf his companions are giving trouble with their ranged attacks, the player can retreat inside the library, where walls can provide cover, and then try to finish them there one by one.\nA strategy that can be applied to all three of them is the use of &lt;a href=\"Dung%20Pie%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dung Pies&lt;/a&gt;. Make a run for the elevator shortcut and reload the area; they will be visible from the elevator exit and will not trigger from this position unless damaged by a weapon. Since Dung Pies inflict &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Toxic&lt;/a&gt; build-up but don't cause &lt;a href=\"physical%20damage\"&gt;physical damage&lt;/a&gt;, they can be thrown without triggering them. They can be killed quickly afterward with a &lt;a href=\"Throwing%20Knife%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Throwing Knife&lt;/a&gt; once their health has been depleted."}
