The whipping animation is performed over roughly 8.5 seconds, and has a small window of interruption before and after the first whip. For the next 120 seconds, all offensive &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Miracles&lt;/a&gt; cast by the player will inflict 25% more damage. The buff is not tied to the weapon, and persists after switching away from the Rose of Ariandel. The buff duration cannot be extended by equipping the &lt;a href=\"Lingering%20Dragoncrest%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lingering Dragoncrest Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nThis skill greatly improves the hitting power of all offensive Miracles, but does not improve the strength of buffs or heals. As such, it is only beneficial when casting spells like &lt;a href=\"Lifehunt%20Scythe%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lifehunt Scythe&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, and will not benefit spells like &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Oath%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Sacred Oath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Replenishment%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Replenishment&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Soothing%20Sunlight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Soothing Sunlight&lt;/a&gt;. As the HP cost of the skill can be easily recovered through the use of healing Miracles, it is a boon for any build that relies heavily on offensive Miracles rather than on weapons.\nOnline gameplay.\nThis skill's greatest strength is that it can be combined with other spell-boosting equipment such as &lt;a href=\"Morne%27s%20Ring\"&gt;Morne's Ring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Sun%27s%20First%20Born\"&gt;Ring of the Sun's First Born&lt;/a&gt;, increasing the maximum possible damage dealt on a build. With the proper setup, it can greatly increase the lethality of &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;-traded Miracles such as a point-blank &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Sunlight Spear&lt;/a&gt;, potentially killing other players in a single cast.\nCare must be taken when performing this skill though, as it takes several seconds, and the self-inflicted damage can be seen by all players in the world. It should only be activated when one can be guaranteed safety for several seconds."}

Enemies must be on roughly the same level surface as the player. Backstabs can be performed with nearly every type of weapon, although exceptions exist (see &lt;a href=\"%23Weapons\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;).\nBackstabs deal high damage based on the damage of the weapon and its critical rate.\nBackstabs cannot be interrupted. While in the motion of backstabbing, both the perpetrator and the victim are granted invincibility frames and cannot take further damage except for damage-over-time effects such as being &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;ed, under the effects of &lt;a href=\"toxic\"&gt;toxic&lt;/a&gt;, or while using &lt;a href=\"Power%20Within\"&gt;Power Within&lt;/a&gt;. An exception to invincibility frames is \"Dark Souls II\", where you can still take damage during a backstab although the damage is reduced. \nMost humanoid enemies can be backstabbed. Most enemies that can be &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte\"&gt;parried and riposted&lt;/a&gt; can also be backstabbed. Some non-humanoid enemies, such as the &lt;a href=\"Fang%20Boar\"&gt;Fang Boar&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Parish\"&gt;Undead Parish&lt;/a&gt; (but not the ones in &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;), can also be backstabbed, but generally non-humanoid enemies are impossible to backstab.\nIt is possible for two players or monsters to backstab a single target at once (each dealing their standard backstab damage). This requires precise timing and positioning, however.\nDifference between games.\nThe difference is very slight although most players report that backstabbing seems harder in \"Dark Souls II\". It feels that the 'backstab window' is a bit narrow in the second game. Also for safer backstabbing in \"Dark Souls\" it's usually better to move a little bit towards the enemy's right shoulder, and in \"Dark Souls II\" towards their left shoulder. \"Dark Souls III\" seems to nearly mirror \"Dark Souls\". \nIt is far easier to backstab in the first game as you can be backstabbed even while rolling and in the second game you may roll away to avoid it.\nEnemies.\nWhen an page displays information on backstabbing (\"Backstab\", under \"Characteristics\"), this refers to whether or not the enemy can be backstabbed.\nInformation on whether the enemy can perform backstabs will be listed under \"Abilities\" and are also displayed here:\nWeapons.\nThe following is a list of &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; that \"cannot\" backstab."}

It was the homeland of &lt;a href=\"Knight%20King%20Rendal\"&gt;Rendal&lt;/a&gt;, the legendary Knight King who wore a &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Steel%20Protection\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt; capable of granting its wearer with the protection of iron, increasing the defense against physical attacks, thus leading many legends to circulate about him, as it was said that not even the claws of a gigantic wyvern would be able to damage it. Rendal was so important that &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Coin\"&gt;Silver Coin&lt;/a&gt; were minted with his portrait on its face, similar to the faces of the gods &lt;a href=\"Allfather%20Lloyd\"&gt;Lloyd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"McLoyf\"&gt;McLoyf&lt;/a&gt;, although these coins of great value in the world of men had little value in Lordran. &lt;a href=\"Balder%20Knight\"&gt;Balder Knight&lt;/a&gt;s wore &lt;a href=\"Balder%20Set\"&gt;armor made from thick iron plates&lt;/a&gt; and used &lt;a href=\"Balder%20Shield\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; tweaked for improved stability and &lt;a href=\"Balder%20Side%20Sword\"&gt;rock-solid, long sword&lt;/a&gt; that were excellent for thrusting attacks.\nHowever, with the fading of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, more and more &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; started to appear among humans, to the point that in Balder it reached a widespread outbreak and the kingdom was reduced to ruins in the ensuing chaos. Knight King Rendal thus gathered the remaining knights of his country and left for &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient kingdom of the gods where according to legend the Undead would have to pilgrimage and overcome various tests to learn about their fate. In an attempt to reach &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; to link the fading Flame and thus save what remained of their kingdom, nullifying the Curse of Undeath, Rendal and his knights arrived at the &lt;a href=\"Sen%27s%20Fortress\"&gt;Sen's Fortress&lt;/a&gt; which tested the potential Chosen Undead with deadly challenges. However, even if they were able to navigate the fortress, Sendal and his knights never managed to overcome the final test of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt; placed to defend the entrance to the city of the gods from countless heroes trying to reach it, and continued to try and fail for decades until even the Knight King himself died, losing his ring in the fortress, leaving the now hollowed knights to wander around aimlessly.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the times and region of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt;, despite Rendal's failure, his &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Steel%20Protection%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt; that offered great physical protection was passed around but his tales became long forgotten and even the greatly wizened had no recollection of his exploits, thus remaining the last trace of Balder's existence.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the times and region of &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt;, despite the many centuries that passed, Rendal's &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Steel%20Protection%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt; that offered great physical protection was passed around and it was said that he was lined with steel on the inside, such that even the talons of mighty dragons did him little harm, thus keeping the last trace of Balder's existence until the last days of the Fire."}

Their high endurance and strength will mean that of all classes they deal the most damage at the beginning of the game. The Bandit\u2019s magic stats are very poor, so using any kind of magic isn\u2019t an option without spending a lot of levels on one of those stats. Their starting armor also isn\u2019t great, but you will have no trouble equipping better armor and shields as you find them.\nBandits begin as a mid-rolling class with their starting equipment and armor, but removing gauntlets or leg armor can allow them to fast-roll at the start of the game."}

It is rather unsuitable to spells, even the &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Miracle&lt;/a&gt; ones, due to its extremely low &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Attunement&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. \nBandits are actually unable to speak to &lt;a href=\"Straid%20of%20Olaphis\"&gt;Straid of Olaphis&lt;/a&gt; by default, the only class that can't do that, due to its extremely low Intelligence not meeting his minimum required amount of 3. \nThe starting weapons are somewhat mixed, with the &lt;a href=\"Short%20Bow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Short Bow&lt;/a&gt; following the higher starting value in Dexterity while the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20Axe%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Hand Axe&lt;/a&gt; instead focuses on &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;.

This includes damaging it, of course, but also blocking it, or just reducing the damage taken with armor. Furthermore, the Banshee's attacks will always stagger the player when not cursed, as it bypasses armor, leaving the player &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;poiseless&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers can also use cursed weapons (such as the &lt;a href=\"Jagged%20Ghost%20Blade\"&gt;Jagged Ghost Blade&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Greatsword%20of%20Artorias%20%28Cursed%29\"&gt;Cursed Greatsword of Artorias&lt;/a&gt;). While this allows striking the Banshee, it will still leave the player unable to block with a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;, or reduce damage taken with armor. Cursed weapons can also be held with two hands to block.\nIf possible, the most complete strategy is to use a Transient Curse, but still wield a cursed weapon. This makes it so that the player is not left completely defenseless should the Transient Curse end at a bad time, or without the player noticing."}

Upon seeing the player, it will frantically scramble or leap into position and exhale a grey mist that will quickly overwhelm the player with the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt; status, causing immediate death.\nThe bulbous appendages that appear on the basilisk are not its actual eyes. The basilisk's true eyes are the small yellow beads that appear right over its mouth.\nGeneral Information.\nThe basilisk can only cause curse status; they cause no other effects or any direct damage in any form unless they jump directly on the player.\nThe basilisks in the &lt;a href=\"Depths\"&gt;Depths&lt;/a&gt; guard the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Evil%20Eye\"&gt;Ring of the Evil Eye&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nBasilisks have low health and no &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt;, making them easy to kill with almost any attack. Their most dangerous move is the leaping curse breath attack, due to its low wind-up, while their standing curse breath is far more telegraphed and easily interrupted. With sufficient curse resistance and rapid offense even groups of basilisks won't prove too challenging as long as the player is mindful of the clouds.\nBasilisks are deaf, meaning they struggle to detect the player unless they see or touch them. Even if they do detect the player, they are slow to turn around, often favoring simply running away before turning around, meaning that they struggle to react to the player getting behind them.\nCritical.\nHitting any part of a basilisk's face will deal increased damage. Because the face is the point that gets targeted when locking onto the basilisk, using &lt;a href=\"thrust\"&gt;thrust&lt;/a&gt; attacks will work exceedingly well against basilisks, as each strike will almost guarantee this bonus damage.\nMelee.\nBasilisks\u00a0have no melee attacks whatsoever. \u00a0Combined with relatively low health, they can be quickly dealt with. However getting\u00a0too close risks exposure to Curse and is ill-advised if they are in any significant numbers, or the player has low Curse resistance.\nConsidering their only means of offense are their Curse attacks, the player could equip a shield\u00a0with high Curse block in order to take basilisks down more easily. &lt;a href=\"Spears\"&gt;Spears&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thrusting%20Swords\"&gt;Thrusting Swords&lt;/a&gt; are excellent for this strategy, as they can strike from behind shields.\nRanged.\nBasilisks stagger from just about any hit, and can easily be pelted with arrows without them being able to execute a single attack. This gives the added bonus of allowing players to pull one or two basilisks at a time, rather than have the entire swarm of seven or so rushing after them."}

Several more can be found near the final bonfire if the player falls through either of two pit traps into their lair. A large, more powerful variant can be found approximately halfway between the Shaded Woods bonfire and the fog gate to &lt;a href=\"Scorpioness%20Najka\"&gt;Scorpioness Najka&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Brightstone%20Cove%20Tseldora\"&gt;Brightstone Cove Tseldora&lt;/a&gt;: There are several hiding in the sand near the final bonfire.\n&lt;a href=\"Aldia%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Aldia's Keep&lt;/a&gt;: They can be found inside the carriages.

Several are also encountered in &lt;a href=\"Things%20Betwixt\"&gt;Things-Betwixt&lt;/a&gt;, on the path leading to the two Ogres on the beach. Several more can be found at &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Amana\"&gt;Shrine of Amana&lt;/a&gt;, one at the end of a side path shortly after the first bonfire, and a few more between the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20of%20Song\"&gt;Demon of Song&lt;/a&gt; and the final bonfire.\nAttacks.\nA Basilisk's most dangerous ability is to &lt;a href=\"Petrification\"&gt;Petrify&lt;/a&gt; the player, causing instant death. Basilisks can also perform a series of melee attacks such as claw swipes, tail slashes and leaping headbutts, all of which are surprisingly potent due to their agility. The addition of melee attacks makes them significantly more dangerous than their &lt;a href=\"Basilisk\"&gt;counterparts&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\".\nStrategy.\nRanged attacks are generally the safest way to dispatch Basilisks, as they are unable to attack anything outside of melee range. Care should be taken, however, as they may end up cornering the player and making them unable to escape the &lt;a href=\"Petrification\"&gt;Petrification&lt;/a&gt; mist. Planning an escape route before engaging a group of Basilisks is advisable.\nBasilisks have little to no &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;. This means that they can be stun-locked by almost any attack. Using wide-swinging weapons, like a &lt;a href=\"Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;greatsword&lt;/a&gt;, will allow the player to deal with larger groups of Basilisks with relative ease.\nThey have very little health, even at higher levels of &lt;a href=\"New%20Game%20Plus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;NG+&lt;/a&gt;, which means that if they are isolated, players can simply wait for them to discharge their petrifying mist and then flank it.\nBeing a beast, Basilisks have a weakness to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage.

Upon sensing the player, the basilisk will charge them before leaping in the air to either spew a gray mist that inflicts &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;curse&lt;/a&gt; or leaping behind the player in an attempt to block off an escape route. They move quickly in a forward direction but turn slowly.\nThe bulbous appendages that appear on the basilisk are not its actual eyes. The basilisks eyes are the small yellow beads that appear right over its mouth.\nBasilisks are often found guarding something; the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Scroll\"&gt;Golden Scroll&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Clutch%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark Clutch Ring&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Cell%20Key\"&gt;Old Cell Key&lt;/a&gt;, and just before &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Slayer%20Tsorig\"&gt;Tsorig&lt;/a&gt;'s encounter.\nLocations.\nBasilisks are found in the &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Keep\"&gt;Farron Keep&lt;/a&gt;, near the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Scroll\"&gt;Golden Scroll&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Antiquated%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Antiquated Set&lt;/a&gt;.\nFurther into the game, the player will find a sewer in the &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20Dungeon\"&gt;Irithyll Dungeon&lt;/a&gt; with two chests, one being a &lt;a href=\"Mimic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Mimic&lt;/a&gt;; the normal chest contains the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Cell%20Key\"&gt;Old Cell Key&lt;/a&gt;. After obtaining the item, the player will be ambushed by several basilisks.\nThe final place that basilisks reside in is down in the lower levels of &lt;a href=\"Smouldering%20Lake\"&gt;Smouldering Lake&lt;/a&gt;, just before being attacked by &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Slayer%20Tsorig\"&gt;Knight Slayer Tsorig&lt;/a&gt; near a large pool of lava.\nStrategy.\nBasilisks are very slippery foes that can be hard to kill due to their evasiveness. Because they only possess breath attacks, they are incapable of damaging the player in any way short of inflicting the status effect.\nIdeally, Basilisks should be engaged in a situation where the player has mobility options. Simply attack and kill a Basilisk while attempting to stay outside of the mist, and retreat as needed if Curse buildup becomes too high. Large weapons with high impact and stagger can lock down Basilisks long enough to finish them off. While weapons with horizontal sweep can allow the player to hit multiple targets at once, vertically attacking weapons can sometimes knock them out of the air as they perform pouncing attacks or jumping retreats.\nAs they are rarely encountered in situations where they are mixed alongside other enemy types, it is best to be patient and slowly but methodically clear out Basilisk nests before moving on. So long as attention is paid to Curse buildup and no additional enemies join the fray, Basilisks can be safely dispatched."}

Despite this, it can still hold its own in the late-game due to its relatively high base damage. This is especially true of characters that use spell buffs as the damage buffs provide is determined mainly by the base AR of the weapon and affinity with infusions.\nIt has the same moveset as the Claymore, save for the strong attacks, which are overhead swings instead of thrusts. The fast attacks combine with the high &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; break to allow the weapon to stagger most enemies, including &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; opponents, with ease.\nAlthough the &lt;a href=\"Claymore%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Claymore&lt;/a&gt; may be considered better, the Bastard Sword's only true weakness is the absence of any easy-to-use thrust, being limited to the rolling attack."}

As well, it has virtually no &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; requirements to wield, allowing almost any build to equip and use it. And finally, its &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; consumption is among the lowest among all greatswords in the game, granting its wielder improved stamina economy.\nThe Bastard Sword specializes in horizontal and vertical slashing attacks. It has a similar moveset to the &lt;a href=\"Claymore%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Claymore&lt;/a&gt;, though it lacks the latter's thrusting attacks, which limits its reach and makes it difficult to use in corridors.\nOn physical builds, the Bastard Sword possesses high &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; scaling, allowing it to deal high potential damage when two-handed. It is also one of only two greatswords with the &lt;a href=\"Stomp\"&gt;Stomp&lt;/a&gt; weapon art, and the only one with the &lt;a href=\"Stomp%20%28upward%29\"&gt;upward slash&lt;/a&gt; variant (the other, the &lt;a href=\"Executioner%27s%20Greatsword\"&gt;Executioner's Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;, has the &lt;a href=\"Stomp%20%28spin%29\"&gt;horizontal spinning slash&lt;/a&gt;), allowing it to be used to win trades against other players who are using similar-sized or even larger weapons. For these two reasons, the Bastard Sword can be quite powerful in the right hands with a &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Gem\"&gt;Heavy&lt;/a&gt; infusion and high amounts of &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpgrades.\nReinforced with standard ."}

In the intro video of \"Dark Souls II\", the Bearer of the Curse is seen wearing the &lt;a href=\"Imported%20Set\"&gt;Imported Set&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn-game, like the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\", the Bearer of the Curse's appearance and attributes are determined by the player, including their face/body, sex, origin, starting class and equipment.\nAlso, like the Chosen Undead, the character's personality is portrayed as an archetypal who doesn't have any sort of spoken dialogue during the game (aside from making some grunts or cries whenever they are hurt or killed).\nPlot.\nPrologue.\nThe Bearer of the Curse became undead at some point, hollowing until they had no recollection of their former life. Desperate to find a cure, they were drawn to the walled off kingdom of Drangleic, where a cure to the undead curse was rumored to exist. Journeying through a portal and guided by a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Keeper\"&gt;Fire Keeper&lt;/a&gt;, the Bearer of the Curse found themselves in the &lt;a href=\"Things%20Betwixt\"&gt;Things Betwixt&lt;/a&gt;. Finding there a hut with the remaining Fire Keepers, the Bearer of the Curse is made to remember more of their past and is cured of their hollowing through a &lt;a href=\"Human%20Effigy\"&gt;Human Effigy&lt;/a&gt;. The Bearer is then guided towards &lt;a href=\"Majula\"&gt;Majula&lt;/a&gt; to seek the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Herald\"&gt;Emerald Herald&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Herald, in turn, tells the Bearer of the Curse to seek the king, &lt;a href=\"Vendrick\"&gt;Vendrick&lt;/a&gt;, to find their answers and claim the throne, but warns that the Bearer will never find the king with a soul so pallid, instructing them to seek out the four Great Ones and to claim their power.\nFour Great Ones.\nThe Bearer of the Curse sets out to find the Four Great Ones.\nThrough the rotunda in &lt;a href=\"Majula\"&gt;Majula&lt;/a&gt;, the Bearer of the Curse makes their way to the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Keep\"&gt;ancient domain&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Iron%20King\"&gt;Old Iron King&lt;/a&gt;, whose hubris led to his death beneath the molten iron, where he was possessed by the soul of &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;one whose name must not be repeated&lt;/a&gt;. Making their way through the king's &lt;a href=\"Huntsman%27s%20Copse\"&gt;old hunting grounds&lt;/a&gt; and the now &lt;a href=\"Harvest%20Valley\"&gt;poison-filled valley&lt;/a&gt; surrounding the castle, the Bearer of the Curse finds and slays the Old Iron King, claiming his soul for their own.\nBy way of &lt;a href=\"No-man%27s%20Wharf\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt; or on the wings of an eagle, the Bearer of the Curse makes their way to &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Bastille\"&gt;The Lost Bastille&lt;/a&gt;, a forgotten prison where the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Sinner\"&gt;Lost Sinner&lt;/a&gt; is held. The Lost Sinner was imprisoned for the sin of attempting to relight the First Flame. The Bearer of the Curse fights their way down into the very bottom of the prison, where they face the Sinner and take her soul for their own.\nAt the bottom of the gaping hole in &lt;a href=\"Majula\"&gt;Majula&lt;/a&gt; lurks things long forgotten. Here, &lt;a href=\"The%20Rotten\"&gt;The Rotten&lt;/a&gt;, a hideous amalgamation of corpses awaits. After making their way through &lt;a href=\"The%20Gutter\"&gt;The Gutter&lt;/a&gt;, a place where unwanted things have been discarded, the Bearer of the Curse faces down the Rotten itself in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Gulch\"&gt;its lair&lt;/a&gt;, slaying it and claiming its soul for their own.\nAfter freeing &lt;a href=\"Rosabeth%20of%20Melfia\"&gt;Rosabeth of Melfia&lt;/a&gt; from her petrification, the path is now open from &lt;a href=\"Majula\"&gt;Majula&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Brightstone%20Cove%20Tseldora\"&gt;Brightstone Cove Tseldora&lt;/a&gt;. The Brightstone Cove Tseldora once housed a prosperous town, grown rich after its founder, the &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Tseldora\"&gt;Duke Tseldora&lt;/a&gt;, discovered its massive crystal deposits. The Duke was always a peculiar figure however, obsessed with spiders, and one day, a massive spider known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Duke%27s%20Dear%20Freja\"&gt;The Duke's Dear Freja&lt;/a&gt; and her countless children overran the town, and the Duke was never seen again. Fighting their way to the spider's lair, the Bearer of the Curse slays the beast and finds the final Great Soul hidden in her lair.\nWhen about to light the last primal bonfire, the Bearer of the Curse is surprised by the &lt;a href=\"Aldia%2C%20Scholar%20of%20the%20First%20Sin\"&gt;Scholar of the First Sin&lt;/a&gt;, who emerges from the bonfire. The Scholar asks if they want to \"shed the curse\", unless they have already joined the crestfallen, he tells them that there are two paths: to inherit the order of the world, or destroy it. He admits that very few have come this far, and yet the Bearer's journey is far from over. The Scholar asks of the Bearer to seek Vendrick, \"he who almost became a true monarch\", for he will guide their way. After this, the Scholar will disappear, letting the Bearer of the Curse light the primal bonfire.\nDrangleic Castle.\nNow with the strength of the four Great Ones, the Bearer of the Curse may pass through the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Winter\"&gt;Shrine of Winter&lt;/a&gt; to reach &lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Castle\"&gt;Drangleic Castle&lt;/a&gt;, the stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Vendrick\"&gt;Vendrick&lt;/a&gt; himself. The &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Herald\"&gt;Emerald Herald&lt;/a&gt; awaits outside, directing the Bearer of the Curse to enter the castle. There is no trace of the King inside the castle however, instead the Bearer of the Curse finds his Queen, &lt;a href=\"Nashandra\"&gt;Nashandra&lt;/a&gt;. Nashandra tells the Bearer of the Curse that Vendrick was less of a king than one might imagine, and that he never took the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Want\"&gt;true throne&lt;/a&gt;. She will direct the Bearer of the Curse to the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Crypt\"&gt;Undead Crypt&lt;/a&gt;, to put an end to Vendrick.\nUndead Crypt.\nAfter traveling through the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Amana\"&gt;Shrine of Amana&lt;/a&gt;, the Bearer of the Curse will come upon the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Crypt\"&gt;Undead Crypt&lt;/a&gt;, a place that has stood since the dawn of time, and where men and gods alike have been interred. Here, Vendrick came along with his loyal knights and his right hand, &lt;a href=\"Velstadt%2C%20the%20Royal%20Aegis\"&gt;Velstadt, the Royal Aegis&lt;/a&gt;. Many servants of Vendrick have come to find the King, only to meet their end at the hands of the Royal Aegis and the King's knights.\nUpon descending from the elevator, the Bearer of the Curse will stumble upon the Scholar once more if met at the last primal bonfire. The Scholar will ask the Bearer if they still desire peace, if answered yes, he will tell them that Vendrick is here and not far off. He will state that the Bearer was neither born with greatness nor granted it by the fates, before once again disappearing into the flames.\nThe Bearer of the Curse fights their way through the knights and defeats Velstadt, finding Vendrick at last. The King, however, has been reduced to a hollow, wandering the grounds aimlessly. The Bearer may choose to put the king out of his misery, or leave him to wander endlessly. Here, the Bearer of the Curse finds the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Ring\"&gt;King's Ring&lt;/a&gt;, and the Emerald Herald, who tells them that the ring will open the way to the far east, where the Bearer of the Curse must journey next. She proceeds to warn the Bearer that if they continue on this path, they too will one day walk these grounds without really remembering why.\nShould the Bearer of the Curse seek her council, Nashandra too will direct the Bearer of the Curse to follow the symbol of the King.\nDragon Aerie.\nFollowing the symbol of the King will lead the Bearer of the Curse to &lt;a href=\"Aldia%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Aldia's Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Aldia was the King's brother, who sought to create dragons, and has long since disappeared. Journeying through the Keep, home to the results of Aldia's mad experiments, will eventually bring the Bearer to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aerie\"&gt;Dragon Aerie&lt;/a&gt;, where they will find the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Herald\"&gt;Emerald Herald&lt;/a&gt; awaiting them. She directs the Bearer to the very top of the Aerie, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shrine\"&gt;Dragon Shrine&lt;/a&gt;, to seek the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Dragon\"&gt;Ancient Dragon&lt;/a&gt;. She claims that the dragon has been watching over the world for aeons, and awaits the Bearer of the Curse.\nOnce arriving at the Dragon Shrine bonfire, the Scholar appears once more. He will reveal that he is in fact Aldia, the elder brother of Vendrick. Aldia says that he \"sought to shed the yoke of fate, but failed\" and that he now only awaits an answer. He asks of the Bearer of the Curse to \"seek the Throne, seek light, dark and what lies beyond\", for the last time, he'll vanish into the flames, allowing the Bearer of the Curse to light the bonfire.\nThe Ancient Dragon will give the Bearer the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Mist%20Heart\"&gt;Ashen Mist Heart&lt;/a&gt;, which allows one to peer into the memories of things long withered. Should the Bearer of the Curse again seek out Nashandra's council, she will warn that the dragon is a false deity and is in fact no more than a prop. Still, she will direct the Bearer of the Curse to go to the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20of%20Fallen%20Giants\"&gt;Forest of Fallen Giants&lt;/a&gt;, to use the Ashen Mist Heart to peer into the Giants' memories.\nThe Three Crowns.\nShould the Bearer of the Curse choose to do so, they may use the Ashen Mist Heart on Vendrick's belongings in the Undead Crypt. Doing so will allow the Bearer to speak directly to the king as he was before he hollowed. Bitter and resigned to defeat, the king will council the Bearer of the Curse, warning them of the futility in seeking fire, of the dark that lies within them, and of the children of &lt;a href=\"Manus%2C%20Father%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Manus, Father of the Abyss&lt;/a&gt;. He will tell the Bearer to seek three crowns of power, belonging to fallen kings. He will also warn the Bearer of his wife, Nashandra, revealing that she too is a child of the Abyss. \nThe Bearer of the Curse will journey through the Black Gulch to find the fallen kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Shulva%2C%20Sanctum%20City\"&gt;Shulva, Sanctum City&lt;/a&gt;, once ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Sunken%20King\"&gt;Sunken King&lt;/a&gt;. The king ruled the city, centred around the worship of a slumbering dragon known as &lt;a href=\"Sinh%2C%20the%20Slumbering%20Dragon\"&gt;Sinh&lt;/a&gt;, until his kingdom was invaded by the Drakeblood Knights lead by &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Yorgh\"&gt;Sir Yorgh&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to claim the dragon's blood. Sir Yorgh slew the king, and awoke the dragon, which proceeded to kill him and lay waste to the city with its poison. The Bearer of the Curse slays &lt;a href=\"Elana%2C%20the%20Squalid%20Queen\"&gt;Elana, the Squalid Queen&lt;/a&gt;, a child of &lt;a href=\"Manus%2C%20Father%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;the Abyss&lt;/a&gt;, and the dragon Sinh to claim the Sunken King's crown.\nNext, the Bearer of the Curse returns to the Old Iron Kingdom, to seek the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Iron%20King\"&gt;Old Iron King&lt;/a&gt;'s crown. Finding the kingdom under the sway of another child of the Abyss, &lt;a href=\"Nadalia%2C%20Bride%20of%20Ash\"&gt;Nadalia, Bride of Ash&lt;/a&gt;, the Bearer braves their way through the ruined towers to find the &lt;a href=\"Fume%20Knight\"&gt;Fume Knight&lt;/a&gt;, who guards the crown of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Iron%20King\"&gt;Old Iron King&lt;/a&gt;.\nFinally, the Bearer of the Curse travels to &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Eleum%20Loyce\"&gt;Frozen Eleum Loyce&lt;/a&gt;, once ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Burnt%20Ivory%20King\"&gt;Ivory King&lt;/a&gt;. Built to contain the &lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Old Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, the city was abandoned and froze over when its king vanished into the chaos. Guided by the last child of the Abyss, &lt;a href=\"Alsanna%2C%20Silent%20Oracle\"&gt;Alsanna, Silent Oracle&lt;/a&gt;, the Bearer of the Curse seeks out the remaining knights of Eleum Loyce to gain their help in braving the Old Chaos. Finding the &lt;a href=\"Burnt%20Ivory%20King\"&gt;Burnt Ivory King&lt;/a&gt; there, the Bearer of the Curse defeats him and claims his crown.\nOnce the Bearer of the Curse has found all three crowns of old, along with Vendrick's own crown, the fallen king will unleash the hidden power of the crowns, making the Bearer of the Curse immune to the hollowing effects of the curse. Bidding the Bearer to seek strength, and asking them whether allowing the flames to fade is truly their only choice, the king sends the Bearer of the Curse on their way.\nGiant Memories.\nUsing the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Mist%20Heart\"&gt;Ashen Mist Heart&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Jeigh\"&gt;corpse of the giant Jeigh&lt;/a&gt; will allow the Bearer of the Curse to enter the giant's memories and fight the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Lord\"&gt;Giant Lord&lt;/a&gt; during the final days of the war between Drangleic and the Giants. Upon defeating the Giant Lord, they will acquire the &lt;a href=\"Giant%27s%20Kinship\"&gt;Giant's Kinship&lt;/a&gt; which will allow them to claim the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Want\"&gt;Throne of Want&lt;/a&gt;.\nThrone of Want.\nBelow Drangleic Castle, the Throne of Want awaits. Here the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Herald\"&gt;Emerald Herald&lt;/a&gt; will meet the Bearer of the Curse one final time, declaring her journey completed. She warns that if the Bearer of the Curse proceeds, &lt;a href=\"Nashandra\"&gt;Nashandra&lt;/a&gt;, knowing the Bearer of the Curse will link the fire, and coveting the power of the First Flame and the Great Soul, will come for them. She urges the Bearer of the Curse to put an end to Nashandra.\nAfter defeating the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20Watcher%20and%20Defender\"&gt;Throne Watcher and Defender&lt;/a&gt;, the Bearer of the Curse will be greeted by Nashandra, now in her true form, as a child of &lt;a href=\"Manus%2C%20Father%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Manus, Father of the Abyss&lt;/a&gt;. The Bearer of the Curse defeats Nashandra.\nIf Vendrick is defeated before Nashandra, and the Bearer of the Curse has spoken to Aldia in the three mentioned locations, answering yes to both questions asked by Aldia, after Nashandra's defeat, Aldia will appear saying that \"many monarchs have come and gone\" and requires the Bearer of the Curse's answer as \"conqueror of adversities\". Aldia will then test the Bearer of the Curse to see if they are truly worthy of receiving the throne by confronting them himself. The Bearer of the Curse defeats Aldia. After Aldia, The Scholar of the First Sin is defeated, the Bearer of the Curse is given two endings.\nOrigin.\nThe homeland of the Bearer of the Curse can be selected, depending of which &lt;a href=\"Classes%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; they choose."}

Its left hand will swipe across the floor and subsequently do the same with its right hand. This attack can be blocked, but consumes a large amount of stamina, making the second attack harder to block.\nSlam.\nIt will raise its hand up into the air and then slam it onto the ground. Players can avoid this attack by running away from the arm before it hits the floor.\nFire Pick.\nAfter destroying one root, the enemy will gain an arm made of fire. The enemy attacks by hitting the floor and then digging in a straight line towards itself. You can avoid this attack by running or &lt;a href=\"rolling\"&gt;rolling&lt;/a&gt; to the side as it only travels in a straight line.

This attack will use both arms to attack, but can still be avoided in the same way.\nVolcanic Chaos.\nThe enemy can only use this attack after both roots are destroyed. It will begin to make flames appear in the area from which it then erupts, causing heavy fire damage. When the surroundings begin to flame up, one must remain in the areas where flames do not appear in order to safely avoid this attack.\nFlaming Mass Spread.\nThe enemy uses this attack very rarely when one or both roots are destroyed. It will charge inward and then expand, sending multiple flaming projectiles both at the direction of player and around them.\nFlame Aura.\nUsed if the player lingers at the mouth of the Tree Beast without going inside.

One must use extra caution in the short area before the boss, as this is where Bell Keeper covenant players will be randomly summoned to harass and impede the player from pulling the lever atop the tower to gain access to the boss room.\nIn \"\" edition, there is also one Belfry Gargoyle on the rooftop of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Castle\"&gt;Drangleic Castle&lt;/a&gt;, where an &lt;a href=\"Alonne%20Knight%20Captain\"&gt;Alonne Knight Captain&lt;/a&gt; is encountered. Another is found in one of the side rooms in &lt;a href=\"Aldia%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Aldia's Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThese gargoyles are similar in appearance to the &lt;a href=\"Bell%20Gargoyles\"&gt;Bell Gargoyles&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\" and even share the same battle music. They wield large &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20Bident\"&gt;bidents&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nTwo gargoyles are present at the start of the battle. One is on a pedestal to the immediate left upon entering the boss area, while the other is on the right, further away from the player. Distance should be put between the Gargoyles and the player, as this will allow the player to use magic and ranged weapons. The Gargoyles can slash, stab, lunge, and breathe fire at the player. If the player chooses to use ranged weaponry, then all Gargoyles should be within view at all times and the player should exploit the Gargoyles openings whenever they present themselves. Since they can only face one direction and are completely still while breathing fire, it is one of the best times to attack them. The gargoyles are vulnerable to &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage.\nThe Gargoyles have individual health bars, but share the boss health bar. Additional Gargoyles will join the combat as the individual gargoyles' health bars are depleted. Therefore, it's in the player's best interest to focus on one Gargoyle at the time and not attack others even if an opportunity presents itself, as it is very likely to cause additional Gargoyles to join the fight, up to a maximum of five. For the same reason extreme care should be taken if using any area of effect damage weapons, spells or items. If attacking one Gargoyle at a time, the player will only face a maximum of three Gargoyles at once during the entire battle, and the third one will join the fight while one of the current pair is already damaged.\nA useful strategy is to poison a Gargoyle and once it takes effect, finish it off normally. This is easiest to do with pyromancies such as &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20Mist%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Toxic Mist&lt;/a&gt; as they can affect multiple gargoyles if they are close together.\nAttacking an inactive gargoyle before it is supposed to spawn will instantly activate it. It is possible to fight all five gargoyles at once which can make the battle almost impossible unless the player is skilled enough.\nAttacks.\nCombo Strikes: Swings their halberds 3 times in a row 2 doing horizontal slashes and the 3rd performs an overhead strike.\nFlank: Flies into the air and lands behind the player and follows it up with a lunge.\nSweep: Performs a singular sweep, no follow ups.\nFlame breath: Shoots out a fire breath from their mouth, comes in two forms.

They are also found in &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; as mini-bosses- exit the first bonfire, go straight on and down the lift, and a gargoyle will be straight ahead. The second is beyond the rotating staircase-bridge.\nLore.\nGargoyles are stone creatures created by the &lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;Gods&lt;/a&gt; through magic to help patrol &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; or sites deemed important. In addition to their tough and hard skin, they are able to breathe fire or lightning and are armed with a &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%27s%20Shield\"&gt;bronze shield&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20Helm\"&gt;bronze helmet&lt;/a&gt; for purely decorative purposes while they use a &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%27s%20Halberd\"&gt;bronze halberd&lt;/a&gt; as a weapon.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord Gwyn&lt;/a&gt; sacrificed himself to link the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; and prolong the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Age of Fire&lt;/a&gt;, several Gargoyles were placed to guard the &lt;a href=\"Bells%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Bell of Awakening&lt;/a&gt; placed on the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Parish\"&gt;Undead Church&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Burg\"&gt;Undead Burg&lt;/a&gt; and act as ritual challenge. In fact, the Undead who tried to follow in Gwyn's footsteps to sacrifice themselves to the Flame would have to be tested even before obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Lordvessel\"&gt;Lordvessel&lt;/a&gt; and seeking powerful souls. Ringing the Bells of Awakening represents only the first of these challenges, and success means gaining access to &lt;a href=\"Sen%27s%20Fortress\"&gt;Sen's Fortress&lt;/a&gt; to be tested further.\nStrategy.\nAs a human, it is possible to have &lt;a href=\"Solaire%20of%20Astora\"&gt;Solaire of Astora&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Lautrec%20of%20Carim\"&gt;Knight Lautrec of Carim&lt;/a&gt; assist during this battle, although Lautrec must be freed and spoken to in &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt; first. Their summon signs are found just before the white light leading to the Gargoyles. Summoning both knights and simply mobbing each Gargoyle can lead to a quick and relatively painless victory.\nThe fight begins with the constant danger of falling off (target-locking, coupled with the camera angle and narrow field of view, can make it hard to see where the main character's feet are) and facing off against a single gargoyle on top of the church roof. Trying to circle the gargoyle while holding up a shield is a good way to avoid its long-reaching frontal attacks. If the gargoyle takes off, move away or get ready to dodge its plunging attack.\nOnce the first gargoyle is cut down to half its health, the second gargoyle will join the fight. Fortunately, this gargoyle is already severely injured (it arrives at half-health). It has the same attacks as the first gargoyle minus the ones that involve flying or using the tail.\nPlayers having difficulty managing their positioning against the two gargoyles should save any consumables (ex., &lt;a href=\"Black%20Firebomb\"&gt;Fire Bombs&lt;/a&gt;) until the first gargoyle's health is approaching 50%, and then use them to finish it off quickly, before the second one starts attacking. The use of &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Pine%20Resin\"&gt;Gold Pine Resin&lt;/a&gt; and other weapon enhancements can also make this fight easier.\nBoth Gargoyles wield halberds and can breathe fire, although the first gargoyle usually will only breathe fire after the second one jumps down. A fire-resistant shield such as the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight%20Shield\"&gt;Black Knight Shield&lt;/a&gt; (and, optionally, fire-resistant armor) can be very useful, as the fire breath covers a wide area. While breathing fire, the gargoyles won't move, making it the perfect opportunity to run over and hit them from behind (this makes avoiding or blocking the fire doubly important, as its stagger effect will consume precious seconds, limiting the time available to attack the gargoyles). In addition, the first gargoyle's tail can be severed to gain a weapon (&lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20Tail%20Axe\"&gt;Gargoyle Tail Axe&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe two Gargoyles fought in Anor Londo breathe lightning rather than fire, so a lightning-resistant shield will prove beneficial. A strategy for the second gargoyle is for the player to run to the bottom of the rotating staircase before activating the lever, where the gargoyle (on a ledge above) will be unable to reach them. However, this means it must then be defeated with ranged attacks.\nBoss information.\nAttacks.\nFlame Breath.\nMore commonly used after the appearance of the second gargoyle.\nAerial Flame.\nOnly used after the appearance of the second gargoyle, but can only be performed by the original gargoyle.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls \u2014 Bell Gargoyle by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCfjtCc5ZTU&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

It also scales worse than the Longbow, and has significantly lower base damage (55/110 as opposed to 75/150). \nOverall, this bow is interesting in multiple aspects, but far from ideal for practical use, as there are far better bows out there that handle better and boast greater damage to boot. It is best to avoid using this bow unless you are at the peak of your equipment load (70.0%), and require a ranged weapon that is very lightweight."}

He has short, blonde hair and a very thick Scottish accent. The most notable thing about Benhart is the teal greatsword that he always has on his person. His sword, the &lt;a href=\"Bluemoon%20Greatsword\"&gt;Bluemoon Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;, is his most prized possession, as it is a family heirloom, and he believes it has some hidden potential.\nIn regards to his personality, Benhart is honorable, and stalwart. He believes that strength is proved through combat, and came to &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; in order to test his mettle.\nLore.\nBenhart comes from a long line of great warriors. He was born in the desert land of &lt;a href=\"Jugo\"&gt;Jugo&lt;/a&gt; and his signature weapon, the Bluemoon Greatsword, is a family heirloom that has been passed for generations amongst the members of his family. Determined to prove that his sword has some hidden potential within it, he travels from land to land to hone his swordsmanship in battle.\nDuring his journey, he found the set of armor he wears during the events of the game. It can be noted that his armor depicts the sigil of a stag similar to the one found in &lt;a href=\"Creighton%20of%20Mirrah\"&gt;Creighton&lt;/a&gt;'s armor. This implies that, at some point during his travels, Benhart might have traveled to &lt;a href=\"Mirrah\"&gt;Mirrah&lt;/a&gt; and acquired his equipment there.\nEventually, Benhart ended up in Drangleic. In this land, he met the merchants &lt;a href=\"Maughlin%20the%20Armorer\"&gt;Maughlin&lt;/a&gt;; of the western land of Volgen, and &lt;a href=\"Magerold%20of%20Lanafir\"&gt;Magerold of Lanafir&lt;/a&gt;. Although both merchants were curious about Benhart's sword, both of them think that his weapon might be a replica of a &lt;a href=\"Moonlight%20Greatsword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;certain legendary sword&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlot.\nWhen certain conditions are met, Benhart of Jugo can be summoned as an ally for the &lt;a href=\"Prowling%20Magus%20and%20Congregation\"&gt;Prowling Magus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Looking%20Glass%20Knight\"&gt;Looking Glass Knight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Lord\"&gt;Giant Lord&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Throne%20Watcher%20and%20Defender\"&gt;Throne Watcher and Defender&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nashandra\"&gt;Nashandra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elana%2C%20the%20Squalid%20Queen\"&gt;Elana&lt;/a&gt; boss fights.\nBenhart is first found near Majula, outside of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Shaded%20Woods\"&gt;Shaded Woods&lt;/a&gt;. When approached by the player, he is sitting and contemplating what to do, as the way forward is blocked by the petrified &lt;a href=\"Rosabeth%20of%20Melfia\"&gt;Rosabeth&lt;/a&gt;. When Rosabeth is unpetrified by using a &lt;a href=\"Fragrant%20Branch%20of%20Yore\"&gt;Fragrant Branch of Yore&lt;/a&gt;, he thanks the player for clearing the way and hopes to the see them again. At this point, one can learn the \"Joy\" &lt;a href=\"Gestures%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;gesture&lt;/a&gt; from him, and it will be possible to summon him as an ally before the &lt;a href=\"Prowling%20Magus%20and%20Congregation\"&gt;Prowling Magus and Congregation&lt;/a&gt; boss fight, in &lt;a href=\"Brightstone%20Cove%20Tseldora\"&gt;Brightstone Cove Tseldora&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe can\u00a0then be found next to\u00a0the bonfire, past the Dragonriders, in &lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Castle\"&gt;Drangleic Castle&lt;/a&gt;. He remarks on the discord of the land, before changing locations. He can then be summoned to assist with the &lt;a href=\"Looking%20Glass%20Knight\"&gt;Looking Glass Knight&lt;/a&gt; encounter.\nNext, he will move to the ramparts, past &lt;a href=\"The%20Pursuer\"&gt;The Pursuer&lt;/a&gt; boss fight area, in the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20of%20Fallen%20Giants\"&gt;Forest of Fallen Giants&lt;/a&gt;. He will state that he will assist the player in any challenge.\u00a0He will then remark on the lineage of his weapon and its apparent hidden potential.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Mist%20Heart\"&gt;Ashen Mist Heart&lt;/a&gt; is possessed, he can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Orro\"&gt;Memory of Orro&lt;/a&gt; near his position on the ramparts. He can be summoned to fight the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Lord\"&gt;Giant Lord&lt;/a&gt;. This is also the spot were he will give the player his equipment if his questline has been completed. \nBenhart drops the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Bluemoon%20Greatsword\"&gt;Bluemoon Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0upon death. If his sword is taken to &lt;a href=\"Maughlin%20the%20Armorer\"&gt;Maughlin the Armorer&lt;/a&gt;, he will note that the sword is a fake; the true sword being the &lt;a href=\"Moonlight%20Greatsword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Moonlight Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;.\nAchievements/Trophies.\nTo get this Achievement/Trophy, the player must summon Benhart and have him survive a minimum of three boss fights. He can be summoned for the following boss fights:\nPlayers can also use a &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20Ascetic\"&gt;Bonfire Ascetic&lt;/a&gt; to respawn a boss and then summon Benhart again. After defeating at least three bosses alongside him, Benhart will thank the player and give them his equipment in the &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Orro\"&gt;Memory of Orro&lt;/a&gt;. \nTo be the most efficient in regards to souls (since summoning anyone, NPC or player, lowers the souls gained for the host by 25%) it is best to re-fight the Prowling Magus and Congregation using the aforementioned Bonfire Ascetics since it has by far the lowest amount of souls dropped, only exceeding the drop from the Looking Glass Knight at higher New Game+/Bonfire Intensity levels (Prowling Magus drops 28k souls on NG+7, Looking Glass Knight drops 25,5k souls on NG). \nNote that since Benhart doesn't move or disappear from his final spot in the &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Orro\"&gt;Memory of Orro&lt;/a&gt; it is possible to delay finishing 3 fights with his help until the end of the game.

Among them, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Iron%20Tarkus\"&gt;Black Iron Tarkus&lt;/a&gt; was renowned even among his fellow knights for his great strength and he wore an &lt;a href=\"Black%20Iron%20Set\"&gt;ultra heavy armor&lt;/a&gt; made of special black iron so heavy that only he was able to wear it but that provided him with a strong defense against fire and his &lt;a href=\"Black%20Iron%20Greatshield\"&gt;greatshield&lt;/a&gt;, made of the same material, was even heavier than that of his fellow knights.\nHowever as the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; started to fade countless among the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Berenike%20Knight\"&gt;Berenike Knight&lt;/a&gt;s became Undead and ventured to &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt;.

It is dropped by the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Mad%20Warrior\"&gt;Mad Warrior&lt;/a&gt; that uncommonly spawns (resting at a bonfire a few times should cause it to respawn). However, acquiring the Berserker Blade also requires that the player be a member of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Bell%20Keepers\"&gt;Bell Keepers&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0covenant, as the phantom will not spawn unless the player is in the covenant.

Its main drawbacks compared to other katanas are its short length, and the time-consuming way it is obtained.\nBeing a rare drop from the Mad Warrior and Prowlers; the process of even getting this weapon can be arduous, but its excellent scaling in &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;dexterity&lt;/a&gt; allows it to compete with the &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Blade%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Chaos Blade&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to the Chaos Blade, it also comes with the advantages of not draining the wielder's health points and being more easily accessible, though likely slower to obtain, due to the nature of random drops."}

After freeing him with either the &lt;a href=\"Cage%20Key\"&gt;Cage Key&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Master%20Key\"&gt;Master Key&lt;/a&gt;, Big Hat Logan thanks the player and later retreats to &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt;. There, he accompanies &lt;a href=\"Griggs%20of%20Vinheim\"&gt;Griggs of Vinheim&lt;/a&gt; and offers to sell the player advanced &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Sorceries&lt;/a&gt;.\nBig Hat Logan soon leaves Firelink Shrine after the &lt;a href=\"Lordvessel\"&gt;Lordvessel&lt;/a&gt; has been obtained. He is then jailed in &lt;a href=\"The%20Duke%27s%20Archives\"&gt;The Duke's Archives&lt;/a&gt;.

After freeing him with the &lt;a href=\"Archive%20Tower%20Giant%20Cell%20Key\"&gt;Archive Tower Giant Cell Key&lt;/a&gt;, players can find Logan in an ancillary library close to the third bonfire in The Duke's Archives, where he sells Crystal Sorceries as well as his prior spells. Alternatively, if not freed by you by Seath's defeat, he will free himself and move to the library.\nUnfortunately, Logan's infatuation with Seath's magic eventually drives him insane after Seath has been defeated and his entire stock of spells has been purchased. Speaking with him again, after the above conditions are met, will cause him to move to the large chamber where Seath the Scaleless was first encountered and become hostile.\nLore.\nMaster Logan was a famous &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; and a royal member of the &lt;a href=\"Vinheim\"&gt;Vinheim&lt;/a&gt; Dragon School before he turned Undead about one hundred years ago. His nickname stems from the gigantic hat he wore which completely hid his face; he used it to block the noise and stares from those around him in order to focus his thoughts. His &lt;a href=\"Logan%27s%20Catalyst\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; was once an ordinary &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer%27s%20Catalyst\"&gt;catalyst&lt;/a&gt; employed by the Sorcerers of Vinheim, but it has since been strengthened due to lengthy use over time. Similarly, his &lt;a href=\"Sage%20Robe\"&gt;robe&lt;/a&gt; is one typically worn by apprentices at Dragon School.\nLogan is credited with having developed the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Soul Spear&lt;/a&gt; Sorcery, among others, which is referenced repeatedly in the legends and is said to be on par with &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord Gwyn's&lt;/a&gt; lightning.\nIn his attempt to reach &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;, presumably to gain access to &lt;a href=\"The%20Duke%27s%20Archives\"&gt;The Duke's Archives&lt;/a&gt; and its vast store of endless knowledge, he became imprisoned in &lt;a href=\"Sen%27s%20Fortress\"&gt;Sen's Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, where he first encounters the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nBig Hat Logan has a repertoire of dangerous Sorceries, including &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Soul Spear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Soulmass\"&gt;Homing Soulmass&lt;/a&gt;.

They are, in fact, trees, but are capable of slowly moving and attack in different ways. If the player is not in their aggro range, they will stand still and, even if triggered, they will attack silently, better from behind the player's shoulders, trying not to be located. Indeed, sometimes it can be hard to locate one of them because they are almost perfectly camouflaged in the wilderness.\nNear the first &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt; there are some non-hostile specimens.\nTypes.\nAll Birch Women can do a grab attack that instantly &lt;a href=\"Frost\"&gt;Frostbites&lt;/a&gt; the player and inflicts high damage.\nThere are two main types of these enemies:\nBirch Woman \"Pyromancer\".\nThis White Tree can be identified by the little fireballs lying on its branches. It will unleash these fireballs if triggered and they will follow the player until they strike them or a solid surface. If all fireballs reach the player, they will inflict a noticeable amount of damage or a heavy stamina drain.\nBirch Woman \"Cryomancer\".\nThis type of Birch Woman is especially dangerous because, as they have no fireballs attached to their branches, they blend perfectly in the environment. It attacks silently with a flood of ice that inflicts &lt;a href=\"Frost\"&gt;Frostbite&lt;/a&gt; build-up and a fairly high damage. It can also stretch its branches to strike the player from a distance.\nVersions of this enemy that use both forms of combat are located in the Depths of The Painting.\nLocation.\nBirch Women are only found in the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Painted World of Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nThe real threat provided by these enemies is their camouflage. It is possible to determine whether a Birch Woman is dangerous by looking directly at the hair on their heads. If the hair stands still, it is not an enemy, but if it move slightly because of the wind, then it is an enemy.\nEven though they are slow enemies, they must not be underestimated because they are often found near other faster enemies, such as &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt;. They provide ranged support for these enemies, and can be problematic if not dealt with. \nAs soon as a Birch Woman is recognized, the player can simply run and kill it. The player shouldn't be greedy; attack them from behind, as to prevent their grab attack. In about three to four hits they should be down. If they are hit with &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage, they will catch fire and scream, becoming incapacitated.\nAnother suggested strategy is throwing an &lt;a href=\"Alluring%20Skull%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Alluring Skull&lt;/a&gt; down on the earth. The fireballs cast by the Birch Woman Pyromancer will follow the skull instead of the player, allowing the player to attack safely.\nFor those who prefer archery, they are easily dealt with from a long distance (farther than their attack range, especially with the &lt;a href=\"Hawk%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Hawk Ring&lt;/a&gt;) with either a crossbow or bow."}

Its primary draw is its high damage, a &lt;a href=\"Sharp%20Gem\"&gt;Sharp&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Infusion\"&gt;infused&lt;/a&gt; Black Blade being one of the highest damage katanas available for a &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;-focused build, but it is somewhat short and heavy, and has a hefty strength requirement of 18 that may make it inaccessible for some builds.\nFurthermore, the weapon features different strong attacks to the standard katana moveset. Its one-handed strong attack combo is of particular note as it uses the standard attacks with their order reversed, starting with a horizontal slash that goes into a thrust. This gives it ready access to a faster alternative to the advancing slash of the &lt;a href=\"Hold\"&gt;Hold&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;, at the cost of a less accessible thrust for distant opponents. This further reduces the effective reach of the weapon compared to other katanas, which may make it more difficult to fight opponents that are agile or who wield longer weapons such as &lt;a href=\"Spears%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;spears&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ultra%20Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;ultra greatswords&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpgrades.\nReinforced with .\nTrivia.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

Killing her counts as a betrayal against the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Hunter\"&gt;Forest Hunter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt; if the player is a member at that time.\nIf she dies by falling (or being kicked) off a cliff, reloading the game will cause the items that would have been dropped to appear on the spot where she first spawned.\nCharacteristics.\nThe Black Bow of Pharis has very high &lt;a href=\"range\"&gt;range&lt;/a&gt;. It has the highest &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"scaling\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt; of any bow in the game, but low base damage and Strength scaling, making it better suited for Dex builds. The S scaling transfers to either &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Divine%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;divine&lt;/a&gt; paths, respectively.\nIts high scaling makes it ideal for upgrading along the Magic, Divine or &lt;a href=\"Occult%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;Occult&lt;/a&gt; paths while using &lt;a href=\"Moonlight%20Arrow\"&gt;Moonlight Arrow&lt;/a&gt;s. Enchanted is not an optimal choice, as its damage falls behind Magic considerably, especially on builds with both high Intelligence and Dexterity. Divine and Occult have a negligible damage difference regardless of the wielder's Faith, meaning that the player should pick &lt;a href=\"upgrade%20path\"&gt;upgrade path&lt;/a&gt; based on if they want the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20%28auxiliary%20effect%29\"&gt;Divine auxiliary effect&lt;/a&gt; or its &lt;a href=\"Occult%20%28auxiliary%20effect%29\"&gt;Occult counterpart&lt;/a&gt;. Notably, the Divine auxiliary effect will counteract the lowered damage dealt to &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s due to arrows dealing thrusting damage, on top of preventing them from resurrecting, while the occult effect will increase damage dealt to multiple durable opponents, such as &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Slayer%20Ornstein%20and%20Executioner%20Smough\"&gt;Dragon Slayer Ornstein&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpgrades.\nScaling Percentage Values.\nThe following chart lists the scaling percentages when this weapon is fully upgraded.

Beyond some &lt;a href=\"Abyss%20Attack%20Dog\"&gt;Abyss Attack Dog&lt;/a&gt;s lies a ladder running parallel to a waterfall. Shortly after moving into the clearing, Kalameet will fly through the canyon and breathe black fire at the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt;. After this attack, speaking to &lt;a href=\"Hawkeye%20Gough\"&gt;Hawkeye Gough&lt;/a&gt; will convince him to shoot down Kalameet, so players can properly engage in battle on the ground. It is not necessary to be struck by the attack in order to receive Gough's help, only that Kalameet performs it.\nIt is possible to kill Kalameet without Gough's help. However, doing so will take an inordinately long time and a very large amount of arrows and the player will not receive any souls as a reward.\u00a0\nSummoning.\nAfter Gough shoots Kalameet down, the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Wood\"&gt;Royal Wood&lt;/a&gt; (including the arena where players fought &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Artorias\"&gt;Knight Artorias&lt;/a&gt;) becomes Kalameet's summoning area. While &lt;a href=\"white%20phantom\"&gt;white phantom&lt;/a&gt;s become available for summoning (usually at the beginning of the Royal Wood, near &lt;a href=\"Oolacile%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Oolacile Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;), it means that red phantoms may &lt;a href=\"invade\"&gt;invade&lt;/a&gt; again also.\nLore.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;.\nKalameet is a descendant of the primordial &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;archdragons&lt;/a&gt;.\nDue to the appearance of \"Disparity\" and &lt;a href=\"Soul\"&gt;Soul&lt;/a&gt;s following the ignition of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; that allowed the evolution of life, Kalameet was born with unique characteristics compared to the original archdragons as he possessed a single orange eye, the ability to produce a high frequency noise which doubles the damage received by targets hit by this attack and an obsidian hide that makes him not only able to resist magic and fire like other dragons but even lightning which was their weak point.\nThanks to his extraordinary strength, Kalameet managed to survive the extermination of the Dragons caused by the &lt;a href=\"Lords\"&gt;Lords&lt;/a&gt; during the war and survived throughout the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Age of Fire&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, after &lt;a href=\"Oolacile\"&gt;Oolacile&lt;/a&gt; was corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Manus%2C%20Father%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Manus&lt;/a&gt;, the dragon took up residence in the area, and not even the mighty warriors left in &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; dared to provoke his ire.\nHowever, at a certain point, a &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt; who ended up in Oolacile decided to challenge the black dragon and after a legendary battle managed to defeat him. From his tail they formed an &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Greatsword\"&gt;Obsidian Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; infused with the mystical power of the dragon and with his orange eye they created an &lt;a href=\"Calamity%20Ring\"&gt;enchanted ring&lt;/a&gt; that doubled the damaged received by its wearer.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough Kalameet was defeated and killed, a group of knights found his corpse and used his scales to create &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragon%20Helm\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; close to the appearance of the dragon, while they used his talons to craft &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragon%20Shield\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; and his tail to forge &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragon%20Greataxe\"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragon%20Warpick\"&gt;legendary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragon%20Sword\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;. As the centuries passed, the Black Dragon became considered a mere legend in which he was defeated by a brave warrior in a magnificent battle and that his tail was used to forge legendary weapons. In the region of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; the name of Kalameet has been long lost and, while the legend of the &lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;pale dragon&lt;/a&gt; is told in various locales even if each account is fragmentary, the Black Dragon is rarely mentioned and some even say that it is only an an embellishment adopted in later retellings of the story.\nDespite this, the group of knights known as the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt; who wore armor forged from the scales of Kalameet and used weapons created from his tail continued to exist and at some point arrived in Drangleic and settled in the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shrine\"&gt;Dragon Shrine&lt;/a&gt;. The group of knights would also join the &lt;a href=\"Covenants%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Remnants\"&gt;Dragon Remnants&lt;/a&gt;, apostles who venerated the primordial creatures and desired the perpetuity of their existence, seeking their scales to rise above their limited human existence. This group used the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Eye%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dragon Eyes&lt;/a&gt; to invade the space and time of other knights and challenge them to claim their dragon scales, rewarding the best among them with the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Torso%20Stone%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;stones infused with the powers of the dragons&lt;/a&gt; to try to achieve transformation and the ancient &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragon%20Greatsword\"&gt;Black Dragon Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; forged with Kalameet's tail.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough the \n&lt;a href=\"Calamity%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;calamitous ring&lt;/a&gt; created with the eye of Kalameet had no useful power and was actually only dangerous, the artifact continued to be passed down for thousands of years as a symbol of dragon worship. Its most fervent adherents even becoming convinced that the task of preserving it had been bestowed upon them as a sacred duty. \nLike many other artifacts and beings connected to the ancient dragons, the ring of Kalameet also ended up at &lt;a href=\"Archdragon%20Peak\"&gt;Archdragon Peak&lt;/a&gt;, a place where the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Man%20Serpent\"&gt;men-serpents&lt;/a&gt; and the dragon worshippers had gathered to venerate the primordial beings and attempted to achieve their perfect shape using &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Head%20Stone%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stones&lt;/a&gt; imbued with the power of everlasting dragons. The ring was thus kept in front of the statue of one of those who, in meditation, had managed to partially achieve the draconic transformation.\nObsidian Greatsword.\nSevering Kalameet's tail and obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Greatsword\"&gt;Obsidian Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; can often prove more challenging than the battle itself, as the dragon's tail is mostly out of reach throughout the fight. His tail has 540 health on Ng and 847 health on NG+.\nBoss information.\nAttacks.\nHellfire Sweep.\nUsed only if the player attempts to enter the gorge before having Hawkeye Gough shoot down Kalameet. Kalameet flies overhead and bathes the entire area in flame then flies away. He will continue to use this attack as long as the player stays in the gorge.\nStraight Flame.\nTriggered when at long range, Black Dragon Kalameet will direct his flames toward the player. This does not track, so it can be easily avoided. Being caught in the flame will often result in a stun-lock, fatal outcome. Blocking will result in a guard break unless the player has a strong shield and high stamina. Kalameet may stunlock the player and use this attack between 1-3 times in a row which will result in a quick death.\nSweeping Flame.\nWhen the player is in medium range of Black Dragon Kalameet, he will breath a surge of his flame, sweeping it from his left to his right. This is a good opportunity to rush and strike him where he is open, but blocking is also possible.\nClose Range Flame.\nWhen the player is under Kalameet's head, he will stand on his back legs and breath fire in a large area right in front of him. A safe spot is to rush under his head or between his legs.\nRising Inferno.\nTriggered when the player is very close and is one of Black Dragon Kalameet's most devastating attacks. He will fly upwards into the air and hover, before breathing fire directly below him. The flame spreads in a circular pattern from the impact point and deals an extreme amount of damage. Running away is recommended, although blocking is also possible with &lt;a href=\"greatshields\"&gt;greatshields&lt;/a&gt;. Shields will take two hits in close proximity and a single hit further away.\nThis can be particularly frustrating, due to the lock-on breaking right at the edge of the danger zone. This causes players trying to run away to turn back into the line-of-fire, or blocking players to turn their backs to the flames. The best way to prevent the lock-on from breaking is to back away from Kalameet as soon as possible. Blocking players may choose to simply stand their ground to avoid breaking the lock. This can also be avoided by simply unlocking and running, or continually rolling away when Kalameet shows signs of the attack.\nFlame Feint.\nKalameet will lunge past the player and once behind them turn around to sweep the area in front of him with fire. When Kalameet lunges however he will usually go far past the player, making the latter part of the attack harmless. Players can take this opportunity to heal or cast spells. If the player stands in the way when Kalameet lunges they can still take considerable damage from the collision.\nIf a wall is behind the player, it will stop Black Dragon Kalameet's progress, leaving him in the player's near vicinity. This is extremely unsafe, as it will put the player in a position where escaping the flame is not possible.\nHead Strike.\nWhen the player is near, Kalameet will swing with his head from his right side to his left, using his snout as a spear. He may afterwards follow up with a swing in the reverse direction. This can be blocked, however. Due to Kalameet's long neck, the second swing has a tendency to strike the player in the back if they are too close.\nHis right flank is safe during this and leaves him open for attack.\nFoot Stomp.\nWhen the player is too close to Kalameet's anterior underside, he will stomp his feet. These stomps don't reach out to the player, so just not being directly under Black Dragon Kalameet is enough to avoid this attack.\nTail Smash.\nBlack Dragon Kalameet will attempt to crush players with his tail if they remain underneath or behind him long enough. Kalameet's tail will remain on the ground for several seconds, providing one of the best opportunities to cut his tail off.\nRush Strike.\nSimilar to the &lt;a href=\"%23Head%20Strike\"&gt;Head Strike&lt;/a&gt;, but without the follow up and covers a greater distance; Black Dragon Kalameet will lunge forward, swiping the player with his head and claw. This attack can be surprising, as he throws it very fast and from a rather long distance. Blocking is possible, but will greatly push the player back.\nEvasive Tail Whip.\nBlack Dragon Kalameet will speedily rotate in a full circle, swinging his tail at the player while jumping away. The actual tail sweep comes late, making difficult to time dodges correctly.\nThis is similar to &lt;a href=\"Great%20Grey%20Wolf%20Sif\"&gt;Great Grey Wolf Sif's&lt;/a&gt; attack.\nSwooping Charge.\nBlack Dragon Kalameet will rise off the ground before charging at the player. Players can take damage from the swoop itself, by being under Black Dragon Kalameet when he lands, or by both in succession.\nKalameet is most likely to use Tail Smash or Tail Sweep after this attack.\nMark of Calamity.\nBlack Dragon Kalameet's signature move. He will rise on his hind legs while the crest on his head glows intensely and produces a high frequency noise. If captured the player will then levitate in front of Kalameet and receive some damage. Afterwards, the player will have the Mark of Calamity for about 60 seconds, during which they will receive twice as much damage. Players can avoid this by running away as soon as he begins to stand.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls \u2014 Kalameet by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fzftmoOpTY&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

Like all other Combustion-type spells, it benefits from being cast from a &lt;a href=\"Pyromancer%27s%20Parting%20Flame\"&gt;Pyromancer's Parting Flame&lt;/a&gt; for the extra melee-range damage.\nOnline gameplay.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, this spell is a favorite, as it inflicts extremely high &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; damage if blocked, enough to threaten even &lt;a href=\"Greatshields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;greatshields&lt;/a&gt; with a guard break. This is extremely useful for dispatching opposing players with &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;ripostes&lt;/a&gt;, particularly as an invader who has to fight multiple opponents and needs to even the odds in an efficient manner.\nDescription.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Official translation=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Its respectable stability, low weight and 100% physical damage absorption also make it an ideal greatshield for defending against physical attacks. Because many enemies in the game are capable of dealing fire damage with various attacks, the Black Iron Greatshield is very effective at protecting players against threats in &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;Lothric Castle&lt;/a&gt;, such as the hollows wielding &lt;a href=\"Firebomb%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Firebombs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Exploding%20Bolt\"&gt;Exploding Bolt&lt;/a&gt;s, and the &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;s wielding fire-infused weapons. It can be particularly useful against bosses that deal physical and fire damage, such as the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Demon%20King\"&gt;Old Demon King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Princes\"&gt;Lorian, Elder Prince&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Prince\"&gt;Demon Prince&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, this greatshield's primary weakness is its low &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; defense, barely absorbing half of any lightning damage that it blocks. This can make it a poor choice against certain foes, particularly &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Armour\"&gt;Dragonslayer Armour&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nameless%20King\"&gt;Nameless King&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpgrades.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

He can be summoned by the player in the fight against the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sen%27s%20Fortress\"&gt;Sen's Fortress&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation.\nIn a tower structure at the end of the walkway to the right from where the fog door to the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt; is located. Like other summon signs, Tarkus's summon sign is only visible if the player has not put down a summon sign and is in human form. He aids the player in taking on the Iron Golem as a &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;white phantom&lt;/a&gt;. He is notoriously tough and can serve as a distraction during the battle. In fact, Tarkus can defeat the boss all by himself in the first playthrough and stands a break-even chance of doing so on &lt;a href=\"New%20Game%20Plus\"&gt;future play throughs&lt;/a&gt; with minimal support from the player. A &lt;a href=\"Black%20Iron%20Set\"&gt;Black Iron Set&lt;/a&gt; is found on his corpse in &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;, next to the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariamis\"&gt;Painted World of Ariamis&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Painting%20Guardian\"&gt;Painting Guardian&lt;/a&gt; stands next to his corpse, possibly removing it from the room since the body is so far away from the entrance.\nLore.\nBlack Iron Tarkus is the strongest &lt;a href=\"Berenike%20Knight\"&gt;Berenike Knight&lt;/a&gt;. Berenike Knights were known for their &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Set\"&gt;heavy armor of steel&lt;/a&gt; and used ultra heavy &lt;a href=\"Tower%20Shield\"&gt;Tower Shield&lt;/a&gt;s forged with thick plates of iron, favoring hard defense and stability, and gigantic swords capable of causing monstrous damage. and for their immense strength they were extolled as the mightiest of mighty. Tarkus was renowned even among his fellow knights for his great strength and he wore an &lt;a href=\"Black%20Iron%20Set\"&gt;ultra heavy armor&lt;/a&gt; made of special black iron so heavy that only he was able to wear it but that provided him with a strong defense against fire and his &lt;a href=\"Black%20Iron%20Greatshield\"&gt;greatshield&lt;/a&gt;, made of the same material, was even heavier than that of his fellow knights.\nHowever as the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; started to fade countless among the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Berenike%20Knight\"&gt;Berenike Knight&lt;/a&gt;s became Undead and ventured to &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt;. Here they tried to make their way toward Anor Londo, through the only possible access: &lt;a href=\"Sen%27s%20Fortress\"&gt;Sen's Fortress&lt;/a&gt;. The knights of Berenike and Tarkus thus entered the dangerous proving ground but for naught as through decades of failure they were not able to advance and ended up as &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;Hollow&lt;/a&gt;s, becoming a threat to all the other Undead in the location. After a grueling and long battle, Tarkus eventually managed to reach the end of the path of Sen's Fortress and challenge the last trial in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt;. The mighty knight in black iron armor managed to defeat even the guardian of Anor Londo, thus gaining access to the city of the gods. Despite his immense strength, once he reached Anor Londo, Tarkus perished at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Painting%20Guardian\"&gt;Painting Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s before he could reach \"&lt;a href=\"Gwynevere%2C%20Princess%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt;\" and obtain the &lt;a href=\"Lordvessel\"&gt;Lordvessel&lt;/a&gt; and the few Berenite Knights that followed him ended up trapped inside the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariamis\"&gt;Painted World of Ariamis&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter an unknown and immense amount of time, &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Slayer%20Tsorig\"&gt;Knight Slayer Tsorig&lt;/a&gt; found the black iron &lt;a href=\"Black%20Iron%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Iron%20Greatshield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; of the deceased Tarkus and made them his own, becoming infamously known for their appearance, as the super heavy armor and shield were a signal of his mighty strenght."}

They can be found in the following locations throughout &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt;:\nDescription.\nBlack Knights are encountered, individually, in many areas of the game as non-respawning challenges for players. At the &lt;a href=\"Kiln%20of%20the%20First%20Flame\"&gt;Kiln of the First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, however, they do respawn.\nThey wield various slow hitting but powerful weapons, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight%20Shield\"&gt;Black Knight Shield&lt;/a&gt; and wear the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight%20Set\"&gt;Black Knight Set&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nThe Black Knights were once the proud\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Silver%20Knight\"&gt;Silver Knight&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt;. Long ago they fought chaos demons and were charred black, also giving them high &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Damage%20Type%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; resistance. Many traveled with Lord Gwyn to the &lt;a href=\"Kiln%20of%20the%20First%20Flame\"&gt;Kiln of the First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, and were burned to ashes when he linked the First Flame, wandering the world as disembodied spirits ever after. Their disembodied spirits can be seen roaming the stairs descending into the Kiln of the First Flame.\nStrategy.\nIt is usually not a good idea to take on Black Knights directly, as they have high &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; and can deal huge amounts of damage. Their attacks are slow, however, meaning that they are susceptible to &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Parry\"&gt;parries&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt's also advisable for lower level players to try and force them off ledges if possible (such as Undead Burg small bridge near bonfire or Darkroot Basin cliff) if killing them becomes problematic. This can either kill them or open them for a &lt;a href=\"Plunging%20Attack%23Dark%20Souls\"&gt;plunging attack&lt;/a&gt; to rack up some serious damage. One could also position themselves in front of a ledge, roll behind the knight as it attacks, and backstab it to knock it over the edge. If the knight dies from the fall, item drops will still be added to the players inventory like they would if the knight was killed normally.\nAttacking them from where they cannot reach or where they will not attack the player will make it easy to kill the knights with ranged attacks, such as &lt;a href=\"bows\"&gt;bows&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"firebomb\"&gt;firebomb&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEnemy information.\nAttacks.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nAxe=\nGreatsword=\nHalberd=\nSword=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nDefenses.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nAxe-Knight=\nGreatsword-Knight=\nHalberd-Knight=\nSword-Knight=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nDrops.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nAxe-Knight=\nGreatsword-Knight=\nHalberd-Knight=\nSword-Knight=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

However, unlike other Black Knight weaponry, the Glaive scales better with Dexterity than with Strength, meaning that it is more beneficial to keep both stats equalized. Also like its cousins, it possesses unique strong attacks that inflict increased &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; damage on targets, and in this case grants it a much stronger moveset due to not being burdened by an easily punishable two-handed strong attack.\nLike other Black Knight weapons, the Black Knight Glaive inflicts 20% more damage against &lt;a href=\"Demon%20%28lore%29\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;.

It also does 20% more damage when used against &lt;a href=\"Demon%20%28auxiliary%20effect%29\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt; type enemies. The Black Knight Great Axe often seems weaker in practice than its damage stats would indicate. This is because its Standard Attacks (R1/RB) have reduced damage to account for their swing speed, which is fast compared to similar weapons. The damage of its slower Power Attacks (R2/RT) are in line with its listed statistics. This Greataxe has lower &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Motion Values&lt;/a&gt; on its two handed attacks compared with other weapons in the Greataxe class. "}
{"id": "52447", "revid": "49243392", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=52447", "title": "Black Knight Greataxe (Dark Souls II)", "text": "The Black Knight Greataxe is a &lt;a href=\"Greataxes%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;greataxe&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nCharacteristics.\nThe Black Knight Greataxe is an interesting weapon, as it has the potential to be very powerful, yet can be quite difficult to use.\nLike all Black Knight weapons, this &lt;a href=\"Greataxes%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Greataxe&lt;/a&gt; inflicts both physical and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; damage, and scales decently with both. However, what sets this apart from the other Black Knight equipment is its raw damage potential; it can inflict an incredible amount of damage due to its high base damage, even with its mediocre scaling at base level. Upon upgrading the weapon, the strength scaling improves heavily, going from a C all the way to an A at +5, allowing it to be a formidable weapon.\nHowever, this weapon has two fatal drawbacks. The first drawback is that the weapon must, similarly to most &lt;a href=\"Halberds%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Halberds&lt;/a&gt;, hit with the head of the axe to deal full damage. Hitting an opponent with the handle, results in underwhelming damage being dealt to them. This, coupled with its cumbersome moveset and high weight, can make the weapon very unreliable to use. Proper spacing is paramount if players wish to make the most out of this weapon, which can be a challenge in itself, especially in &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt upgrades with &lt;a href=\"Twinkling%20Titanite%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Twinkling Titanite&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the huge gap between physical and fire damage, &lt;a href=\"Infusion\"&gt;infusing&lt;/a&gt; this weapon with &lt;a href=\"Firedrake%20Stone\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; is a wise choice."}

Even without this particular trait, it can inflict large amounts of damage against anything it hits, as it possesses the enhanced damage multipliers of the greataxe class on top of high base damage and strong &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt; in both &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;. This damage can be further augmented by its skill, &lt;a href=\"Warcry\"&gt;Warcry&lt;/a&gt;, which becomes more potent if the wielder has large amounts of Strength. It is also the only greataxe that possesses a truly unique moveset, being capable of horizontal swings when one-handed and powerful vertical sweeps when two-handed, as opposed to the downward smashes that all other greataxes are restricted to. Being a Black Knight weapon, it also possesses unique strong attacks that inflict increased &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; damage to targets, making it a useful asset.\nHowever, like all other Black Knight weapons, it is extraordinarily heavy and costs large amounts of &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; to swing. As such, wielding this weapon requires great investments in not only Strength and Endurance but also &lt;a href=\"Vitality%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt;.\nMoveset.\n&lt;br&gt;\nUpgrades.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

This makes it a very powerful asset when fighting other &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt; weapons.\nUnique to this weapon, the Black Knight Greatsword possesses two power attacks that are capable of utterly decimating enemies.

Its resistance to &lt;a href=\"Negative%20Status%20Effects%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;status effects&lt;/a&gt; is quite moderate, having no particular weaknesses and being quite resistant to &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt; build-up.\nWhile it has a respectable &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt;-to-weight ratio, the total amount of Poise provided largely limits its effectiveness to trading when supported by the innate poise health of an &lt;a href=\"Ultra%20Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;ultra greatsword&lt;/a&gt; or larger."}

It boasts high base &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt; and impressive &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; absorption, allowing players to shrug off fire attacks with minimal &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; cost. Fully upgraded, its stability rivals that of &lt;a href=\"Greatshields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;greatshields&lt;/a&gt;, making it the best medium shield for blocking &lt;a href=\"physical\"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; attacks. Finally, its skill allows for the use of the &lt;a href=\"weapon%20art\"&gt;weapon art&lt;/a&gt; of the right-hand weapon, giving players a higher degree of flexibility in their moveset.\nHowever, it is also the heaviest medium shield in the game, requiring at least some investment in &lt;a href=\"Vitality%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a respectable amount of &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; in order to wield effectively. Its &lt;a href=\"elemental%20resistance\"&gt;elemental resistance&lt;/a&gt;s are relatively average for a medium shield, absorbing comparatively little damage from attacks that do not deal physical or fire damage. Therefore, while the Black Knight Shield is very strong against physical threats and enemies that deal Fire damage, it is not highly effective against other elements."}

Its fairly good reach is offset by its cumbersome &lt;a href=\"moveset\"&gt;moveset&lt;/a&gt;. Like all Black Knight &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, it deals 20% bonus damage to &lt;a href=\"Demon%20%28auxiliary%20effect%29\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the Black Knight Sword can be obtained so early in the game (if players are lucky and get the drop), it can be useful in early stages where its damage output is very high compared to other weapons found at that stage. While it can easily carry the player to the very end of the game, as well as &lt;a href=\"AotA\"&gt;the DLC&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Man-serpent%20Greatsword\"&gt;Man-serpent Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; is a better alternative that can be &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Augmentation\"&gt;augmented&lt;/a&gt; and, more importantly, requires no Dexterity, allowing a character to put significant extra levels into a different stat."}

The sword can be found inside.\nCharacteristics.\nThe Black Knight Sword is a very effective greatsword for quality builds, despite being un-&lt;a href=\"Infusion%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;infusable&lt;/a&gt; and un-buffable. Its &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt; tends more towards &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, however due to its un-infusable nature it cannot take advantage of scaling bonuses past 40 in either category.\nIts &lt;a href=\"Moveset%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;moveset&lt;/a&gt; is composed mainly of slashes, as well as being capable of performing a &lt;a href=\"Thrust%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;thrust&lt;/a&gt; with the second one-handed strong attack. While it does not have an advantage in reach compared to other greatswords, its moveset still grants it good coverage against crowds as well as against single targets. As well, the strong attacks of the weapon, whether one-handed or two-handed, deal increased &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; damage, making it useful for staggering foes should the need arise.\nWhat sets the Black Knight Sword apart from its peers is its &lt;a href=\"weapon%20art\"&gt;weapon art&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Perseverance%20%28skill%29\"&gt;Perseverance&lt;/a&gt;, which is normally only seen on &lt;a href=\"Hammers%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;hammers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Great%20Hammers%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;great hammers&lt;/a&gt;. Combined with its impressive damage output and respectable swing speed, this allows players to stand their ground and out-trade opponents who try to contest their ground, even those wielding ultra weapons.\nThis weapon, as well all the other Black Knight weapons, inflict 20% bonus damage to &lt;a href=\"Demon%20%28lore%29\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;-type foes. This means that it is particularly effective against enemies such as the &lt;a href=\"Stray%20Demon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Stray Demon&lt;/a&gt; and even bosses like the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Prince\"&gt;Demon Prince&lt;/a&gt;."}

This pyromancy can be useful, even if the target is not locked on, since the random movement of the flame makes the enemy break their attack while trying to avoid the spell. \nEnemies that use shields, such as &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20Knight\"&gt;Cathedral Knight&lt;/a&gt;s, have their &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Break\"&gt;blocks broken&lt;/a&gt; from this attack. This can be used to almost always perform &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;critical&lt;/a&gt; attacks on them, if the shield is hit as they block, making it easier to combat defense-based enemies.\nOnline gameplay.\nEven if this Pyromancy doesn't seem useful in &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, it could be used effectively with enough &lt;a href=\"casting%20speed\"&gt;casting speed&lt;/a&gt;, a true combo (which the enemy will not be able to escape from once they are caught in) is possible by transitioning from Black Serpent to either &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Bed%20Vestiges\"&gt;Chaos Bed Vestiges&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Great%20Chaos%20Fire%20Orb\"&gt;Great Chaos Fire Orb&lt;/a&gt;.

Andre appears to have various scars and burn marks on his upper body and arms, whilst wearing pants, a belt, and gloves. He can always be found sitting at an anvil, forging an &lt;a href=\"Estoc%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Estoc&lt;/a&gt; with a hammer. He has a multitude of tools and weapons lying around him. While similar in appearance to &lt;a href=\"Andre%20of%20Astora\"&gt;Andre of Astora&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt;, it is unknown for certain whether or not the Andre found in \"Dark Souls 3\" is the same person. Some theorize that they are different people, but Andre's knowledge of the Giant Blacksmith, and references to knowing him for ages, has led some to believe that they are in fact one and the same. \nAfter exhausting his dialogue, he teaches the \"Hurrah!\" &lt;a href=\"Gestures%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;gesture&lt;/a&gt;.\nAndre will reinforce the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20One\"&gt;player's&lt;/a&gt; weapons in exchanged for certain types of &lt;a href=\"Upgrade%20Materials%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;titanite&lt;/a&gt;, depending on the player's reinforcement level and &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Types%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;, as well as souls.\nAndre can &lt;a href=\"Infusion%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;infuse&lt;/a&gt; weapons if the player brings him various coals found throughout the world. Certain coals yield different infusion upgrade paths. Once a weapon is infused, it may still be upgraded by using the type of titanite specific for it. However, the player should take into consideration if infusing a weapon affects it negatively, according to their stats, or if doing so will remove its &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt; bonuses.\nIn addition to upgrading and infusing weapons, Andre can repair those that are broken. He cannot repair the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Sacrifice%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Ring of Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt;, though.\nAndre allows the player character to allocate between a standard &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Estus%20Flask\"&gt;Ashen Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt;. For example, if the player has five Estus Flask uses in total, they can choose to have three standard Estus Flasks uses, which recover &lt;a href=\"Hit%20Points%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;, and two Ashen Estus Flask uses, which recover &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt;.\nFinally, Andre can reinforce the player's &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt; to increase its number of uses. In order for Andre to upgrade the Estus Flask, the player must bring him an &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Shard\"&gt;Estus Shard&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the player kills Andre, he will no longer offer any services, unless the player's sins are forgiven at the shrine of &lt;a href=\"Velka%2C%20Goddess%20of%20Sin\"&gt;Velka&lt;/a&gt;."}

He is first encountered in &lt;a href=\"Majula\"&gt;Majula&lt;/a&gt; and offers smithing services to the player after retrieving his &lt;a href=\"Lenigrast%27s%20Key\"&gt;key&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Merchant%20Hag%20Melentia\"&gt;Merchant Hag Melentia&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough his body has already decayed, memories of his daughter and blacksmithing are all that remain. Lenigrast is first encountered locked out of his shop in Majula. He asks the player to find &lt;a href=\"Lenigrast%27s%20Key\"&gt;his key&lt;/a&gt;, which can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Merchant%20Hag%20Melentia\"&gt;Merchant Hag Melentia&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20of%20Fallen%20Giants\"&gt;Forest of Fallen Giants&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis daughter is &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Trader%20Chloanne\"&gt;Stone Trader Chloanne&lt;/a&gt;, whom he refers to as \"reckless\" like the player for always being in transit. When she arrives at Majula, Lenigrast expresses his relief that she has \"come home\". Chloanne does not recognize him in his &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;Hollow&lt;/a&gt;ing form and questions whether her father had followed her to &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt;. He also warns the player of &lt;a href=\"Laddersmith%20Gilligan\"&gt;Laddersmith Gilligan&lt;/a&gt;, citing him as an infamous scoundrel who \"always manages to stir up trouble\".\nHe will drop\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Blacksmith's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0if killed or give it to the player after spending 8000 &lt;a href=\"Souls%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; reinforcing equipment.\nBugs.\nThere is a bug that occurs when the player attempts to attack Lenigrast while he is still sitting down outside of his house. Instead of defending himself, he will continue to sit still. This can be fixed by resting at a &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt; and returning to him."}

Darkmoon Blades hunt those who have sinned.\nRequirements.\nThe player must not have killed &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Dark Sun Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt;. If the player has killed &lt;a href=\"Gwynevere\"&gt;Gwynevere&lt;/a&gt;, they must request absolution\u00a0from &lt;a href=\"Oswald%20of%20Carim\"&gt;Oswald&lt;/a&gt; before joining.\nHow to Join.\nFirst, acquire the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Seance%20Ring\"&gt;Darkmoon Seance Ring&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Catacombs\"&gt;The Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;. Go to the bottom level of the rotating elevator in &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; to find the Darkmoon Tomb &lt;a href=\"bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;. Past the bonfire, Gwyn's statue will disappear to reveal a fog gate if the player is wearing the Darkmoon Seance Ring. If the player has killed Gwynevere, the statue will just disappear when approached. Go toward the fog gate and Dark Sun Gwyndolin will ask the player to swear fealty to the Blades of the Darkmoon. Kneel at the fog door to join the covenant.\u00a0\nBenefits.\nUpon joining, players receive:\n&lt;a href=\"Souvenir%20of%20Reprisal\"&gt;Souvenirs of Reprisal&lt;/a&gt; are offered to &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Dark Sun Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt; to gain ranks in the Blade of the Darkmoon Covenant.\nPlayers may only use the Darkmoon Blade miracle when they are in the Blade of the Darkmoon covenant; the buff is initially 1.8x of the magic adjust of the talisman, but will gain 0.1 with every level gained in the covenant (1.9x at +1, 2.0x at +2, and 2.1x at +3).\nBeing part of the Blade of the Darkmoon covenant does not prevent invasions from other members.\nActivities.\nBlades of the Darkmoon hunt players that have attacked the illusion of Gwynevere or have committed any amount of &lt;a href=\"sin\"&gt;sin&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0by either getting kicked out of a covenant or being indicted by other players. Players risk nothing invading other people's worlds (cannot be indicted and all souls and humanity are kept upon death) and gain a Souvenir of Reprisal for each guilty player they defeat.\nOutside of Gwyndolin, the only character part of the covenant is the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Knightess\"&gt;Anor Londo Fire Keeper&lt;/a&gt;, although she does not provide a fellow Darkmoon Blade with anything besides unique dialogue. Attacking Gwynevere or passing through Gwyndolin's fog gate will result in her turning hostile, but killing the Fire Keeper will not count as betraying the covenant.\nBetrayal.\nEntering Gwyn's Tomb to confront &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt; counts as a betrayal and results in expulsion from the covenant. Destroying the illusion of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Gwynevere%2C%20Princess%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Gwynevere&lt;/a&gt; while being part of the Blades of the Darkmoon will NOT cause Gwyndolin to expel the player from the covenant, but it will prevent the player from offering any more\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Souvenir%20of%20Reprisal\"&gt;souvenirs of reprisal&lt;/a&gt; to Gwyndolin.\nOverview.\nBlade of the Darkmoon is considered one of the more difficult covenants to master. Every person the player invades as a spirit of vengeance has likely had experience in PvP (since &lt;a href=\"Indictment\"&gt;Indictment&lt;/a&gt;s during an invasion are one of the few repeatable ways of gaining sin), and so will usually put up a tougher fight than people invaded by Darkwraiths. To make matters worse, people in Dark Anor Londo are likely to be duel-mongerers who kill Blades of the Darkmoon for sport or for souls. They very often have friendly summons with them.\nHowever, the Blade of the Darkmoon covenant is very worthwhile. The Darkmoon Talisman has the best miracle adjust in the game, so any player who relies on miracles would benefit from joining this covenant; in turn, Darkmoon Blade is an excellent weapon buff. With patience and perseverance, players may yet reap the benefits of the Blade of the Darkmoon."}

{"id": "107756", "revid": "49243392", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=107756", "title": "Bleed (Dark Souls II)", "text": "Bleed is a &lt;a href=\"Negative%20Status%20Effects%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;negative status effect&lt;/a&gt;, and auxiliary effect in . It can be inflicted by the environment, various &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; or items. It can also be used as an &lt;a href=\"infusion\"&gt;infusion&lt;/a&gt; for weapons. Bleed can affect both the player and most enemies.\nBleed buildup.\nWhen attacked with weapons that inflict Bleed, the target's Bleed meter gradually fills. The rate at which this fills is dependent on the Bleed buildup value of the attacker's weapon or item; and the target's Bleed Resist stat. The Bleed meter will gradually reset back to zero naturally, provided additional Bleed attacks are not endured.\nOnce the meter is full, the target's Health will damaged by 200 points. It will also reduce the maximum stamina of the target to 75% for 5 to 10 seconds. Also any movements that are not a run, dash or roll are reduced to a walk.\nIts not possible to increase the total amount of damage Bleed inflicts - only the rate at which Bleed builds up can be increased. Depending on the source, the Bleed buildup value can vary greatly.\nBleed offense.\nBleed Attack.\nThe Bleed Attack (abbreviated as Bleed ATK in-game) governs the rate at which the player's Bleed attacks buildup upon a target.\nBleed Attack Bonus.\n The Bleed Attack Bonus (abbreviated as Bleed BNS in-game) increases the amount of Bleed buildup inflicted per hit. It does not affect the total amount of damage the Bleed effect will do. Unlike weapons that have a magical &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt; stat, Bleed has no equivalent scaling.\nThe Bleed BNS value is determined by the &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt; stats. In order to continually increase innate Bleed BNS, both Dexterity and Faith need to be leveled up, with Dexterity giving a larger bonus.\nApplication of Bleed AR.\nBleed applies once the status bar fills up to 100%. Each hit of a weapon applies the same amount of buildup per hit, meaning that multihit attacks are very effective at building status.\nThe AR you gain for Scaling is applied as 40% as the number in the menu.\nThe handedness preference of a weapon applies to bleed, typically reducing the amount by 10% in the left hand vs the right.\nThe amount of status built up is equal to [(Base AR + (Scaling *0.4))/5]% and then reduced by (Bleed Defense/10)%. Players have 100 additional invisible defenses on all non physical types.\nBleed weapons.\nThe following is a list of weapons and shields that bear an innate Bleed buildup effect. For information as to how these weapons are effected by Bleed infusions, see &lt;a href=\"%23Infusion\"&gt;this section&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoosting Bleed buildup.\nThere are two pieces of equipment that can grant a flat bonus to the Bleed buildup stat on Bleed weapons when worn. The bonus granted from these items can vary depending on what type of Bleed weapon is equipped, be it &lt;a href=\"%23Bleed%20weapons\"&gt;innate Bleed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%23Infusion\"&gt;infused Bleed&lt;/a&gt; or both. Both of these items can be worn together, which would provide double the bonus.\nThe following numbers are the menu numbers but they are applied as a fifth of that on hit. Additionally, Shadow Gauntlets have an invisible unique effect that enables bleed scaling on all equipped weapons by a custom amount, making it the only way to increase bleed on lacerating arrows and making it the best status increasing item.\nInflicting Bleed buildup.\nMost weapons can be given the ability to deal Bleed buildup temporarily through the use of &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Serum\"&gt;Bleeding Serum&lt;/a&gt;. This buff does scales accordingly to the &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Buff%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Weapon Buff&lt;/a&gt; formula. If the weapon has an innate Bleed effect, the buildup is stacked and thus more powerful. Applying this buffs result in the weapon taking on a red glow.\nUnlike weapon buffs, the Bleed buildup of &lt;a href=\"Lacerating%20Knives\"&gt;Lacerating Knives&lt;/a&gt; does not scale based on the Bleed BNS value, instead dealing a flat 40% before resistances. They can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Laddersmith%20Gilligan\"&gt;Laddersmith Gilligan&lt;/a&gt; for 350 souls each. &lt;a href=\"Lacerating%20Arrow\"&gt;Lacerating Arrow&lt;/a&gt;s deal a flat Bleed buildup value of 54% before resistances. They cannot be purchased from anyone, making them very rare.\nBleed Resist.\nBleed Resist governs how robust the player is against Bleed buildup.\nInnate Resist.\nInnate Bleed Resist describes the value of the player's Bleed resistance when not influenced by any outside factors, such as armor, spells or consumables. Bleed Resist can be increased incremetally through leveling both &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adaptability\"&gt;Adaptability&lt;/a&gt;. Bleed Resist will increase steadily until a soft cap of 140 Bleed resistance is reached, after which any further increases will be much slower. Innate Bleed Resist caps at 200 points, when both stats are at 99.\nBleed Resist cap.\nBleed Resist is capped at 890 points. Combined with a hidden stat of 100 points, Bleed Resist can reach a maximum of 990 points. Since 1000 points of any magical or elemental defense equals immunity, Bleed buildup cannot be completely nulified, with the exception of blocking with a shield.\nArmor and shields.\nVarious armor pieces grant varying levels of Bleed Resist. The following armor table shows the armor pieces which grant the highest possible Bleed Resist, for each body part. Curiously, &lt;a href=\"Yorgh%27s%20Spear\"&gt;Yorgh's Spear&lt;/a&gt; is unique in that it provides an additional 70 points of resistance to Bleed when wielded. One can be wielded in each hand to provided twice the resistance.\nShields will only block Bleed attacks if the player is actively blocking. Merely equipping the shield does not count towards defense. The Bleed Resist value on shields is expressed as a percentage in-game, as opposed to points on armor. Any shield had the ability to block 100% of Bleed temporarily via the &lt;a href=\"Strong%20Magic%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Strong Magic Shield&lt;/a&gt; sorcery.\nThe following shields table shows all shields that grant at least 70% reduction:\nSpells and items.\nCertain defensive spells can temporarily increase Bleed Resist, but they cannot be stacked with each other. Only one will be active at a time. &lt;a href=\"Red%20Leech%20Troches\"&gt;Red Leech Troches&lt;/a&gt; is a consumable item that can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Rat%20King%20%28character%29\"&gt;Rat King&lt;/a&gt; for 1600 souls each. They cannot be stacked with any of the defensive spells either. Consuming a Red Leech Troche will remove the Bleed Resist provided by the spell, and apply the Red Leech Troche resist value.\nRings.\nOnly two rings provide Bleed Resist. Both can be worn together, granting a maximum of 320 Bleed Resist, at the highest item level. Like all other rings, duplicate rings cannot be worn simultaneously.\nOther.\n&lt;a href=\"Yorgh%27s%20Spear\"&gt;Yorgh's Spear&lt;/a&gt; is unique in that it provides an additional 70 points of resistance to Bleed buildup when wielded. One can be wielded in each hand to provided twice the resistance.\nPreventing Bleed.\nIf the Bleed meter is filled, Health will damaged by 200 points and the maximum stamina of the target is reduced to 75% for a few seconds. To prevent the Bleed status effect from triggering, the Bleed meter can be set back to zero. Unlike Poison, which has several methods of resetting the Poison meter, the Bleed meter can only be reset by consuming a &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Blessing%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Divine Blessing&lt;/a&gt;. This can be useful in \"life-or-death\" situations, when the onset of the Bleed status is imminent.\nInfusion.\n &lt;a href=\"Steady%20Hand%20McDuff\"&gt;Steady Hand McDuff&lt;/a&gt; can &lt;a href=\"infuse\"&gt;infuse&lt;/a&gt; most weapons with Bleed through the use of a &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20Stone\"&gt;Bleed Stone&lt;/a&gt;. Once a weapon is infused, the Bleed icon () will be displayed next to its image in the HUD.\nEnemies.\nThe following is a breakdown of enemy and boss information relating to Bleed buildup and immunity:\nCalculator.\nDatasheet that can calculate bleed buildup on each attack https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13Ba-cbzZG_EMnkuO_8MO53sidBna1hsztrCa_7LQ63E/edit?usp=sharing"}

Once the bar is filled up, the Blood Loss effect will proc, instantly inflicting 15% of the player's &lt;a href=\"Hit%20Points%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;health bar&lt;/a&gt; as damage plus a flat amount, then shortly resetting to allow Bleed to build up again.\nThe flat damage inflicted upon a successful Blood Loss proc alongside the percentage value varies depending on the source:\nThe amount of Bleed inflicted by weapons wielded by the player is also influenced by &lt;a href=\"Luck\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nBecause damage is expressed as a percentage of the target's maximum HP, Bleed is very powerful against opponents with large health pools but weak resistance to the status effect. In particular, it is very strong against &lt;a href=\"Boss%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt; that are not immune to the effect, such as &lt;a href=\"Dancer%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Dancer of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Prince\"&gt;Demon Prince&lt;/a&gt;.\nAgainst players, it is useful in invasions to apply pressure to foes, threatening them with sudden tremendous amounts of damage if they continue to fight. However, building specifically for Bleed is not recommended, as such builds often sacrifice the raw attack power of a weapon, which in turn can cause damage output to decrease or break even when compared to simply using a standard build."}

It is most often accessed when entering Blighttown through the &lt;a href=\"Depths\"&gt;Depths&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe other bonfire is located just inside a tunnel accessed through the swamp at the bottom of Blighttown; near the area between the two paths leading to the Depths and &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Drakes\"&gt;Valley of Drakes&lt;/a&gt;. This bonfire is usually accessed first by players using the Blighttown shortcut connecting the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Drakes\"&gt;Valley of Drakes&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuelaag's Domain.\nEven though &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Witch%20Quelaag\"&gt;Chaos Witch Quelaag&lt;/a&gt; is located in &lt;a href=\"Quelaag%27s%20Domain\"&gt;Quelaag's Domain&lt;/a&gt;, she is considered to be the boss of Blighttown as well, and slaying her will prevent any future summoning and invading in Blighttown. The entrance to Quelaag's Domain can be found on the face of the large mound covered in spider webs."}

As the buff animation takes a bit over 4 seconds, the effective duration will be about 45 seconds.\nThe skill requires 10 &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt; to perform (8 &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Ring\"&gt;Farron Ring&lt;/a&gt; is equipped) and causes 200 &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt; build-up on the user as well as &lt;a href=\"Physical%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; damage, which is based on the user's maximum &lt;a href=\"Hit%20Points%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; and ignores both defenses and absorption.\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nDue to the sword being un-buffable, this skill is crucial in order to maximize its damage potential. Due to it being a physical buff, it can be effective against all manner of enemies that may have strong elemental resistances. However, care must be taken when combating enemies that inflict Bleed build-up, as even a single hit can greatly damage the player following an activation. In such cases, immediate consumption of a &lt;a href=\"Bloodred%20Moss%20Clump%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bloodred Moss Clump&lt;/a&gt; may be useful.\nOnline gameplay.\nThe additional Bleed buildup and bonus Physical damage can be extremely helpful when combating other players, particularly in areas where there are other sources of bleed (such as if they've been inflicted with the maggot status effect by various enemies in &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Cathedral of the Deep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20Dungeon\"&gt;Irithyll Dungeon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Painted World of Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;). However, care must be taken as opponents may have their own Bleed-inflicting weaponry equipped, such as &lt;a href=\"Kukri\"&gt;Kukri&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Gnaw\"&gt;Gnaw&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Splintering%20Bolt\"&gt;Splintering Bolt&lt;/a&gt;s, all of which can easily bleed the user out after they activate the buff. As above, immediate consumption of a Bloodred Moss Clump after buffing can be very helpful."}

Attacking enemies from a distance to chip away at their health while also luring them towards the player to engage in close quarters is a reliable strategy.\nOne advantage it does have over staves, is the fact that its casting height is much lower than other staves, this means that while in tight or irregular spaces, like corridors, most staves may hit the environment instead of the enemy when casting a spell, the Blue Flame, however, will not.\nThe Blue Flame is upgradeable through &lt;a href=\"Twinkling%20Titanite%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Twinkling Titanite&lt;/a&gt;, but because its rather low scaling will never be increased through upgrading, it is suggested to &lt;a href=\"Infusion\"&gt;infuse&lt;/a&gt; it with Magic. This will increase its magic damage as well as its scaling with &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. There is little reason to keep this weapon uninfused, if the player intends to use it. Do note that infusion with &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; barely decreases the sword's base stats while ironically providing better scaling for Magic. However, if one wishes to maximize the spell power of this weapon, they are still better off infusing it with &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;. \nWhile the spell buff on this weapon is respectable enough, it has the unique advantage of being temporarily increased further through magic weapon buffs such as &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Magic%20Weapon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Crystal Magic Weapon&lt;/a&gt;. A fully upgraded Magic Blue Flame with Crystal Magic Weapon applied has the strongest spell buff after &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Staff of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;. As such, if a player wishes to run Magic Blue Flame with Crystal Magic weapon as their main catalyst, it is recommended that they buff their magic duration as much as possible (&lt;a href=\"Lingering%20Dragoncrest%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Lingering Dragoncrest Ring&lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=\"Northwarder%20Set\"&gt;Northwarder Set&lt;/a&gt;) since Crystal Magic Weapon has limited uses. \nIts innate magic damage combined with being infusable and buffable gives the rather unique combination of using the stronger buff to innate magic damage of &lt;a href=\"Aromatic%20Ooze\"&gt;Aromatic Ooze&lt;/a&gt; to grant strong sorcery damage even at low levels of Intelligence.

He is located in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Blue\"&gt;Cathedral of Blue&lt;/a&gt;, directly after the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Dragonslayer\"&gt;Old Dragonslayer&lt;/a&gt; boss fight. The player must have successfully assisted another player in killing a boss by using the &lt;a href=\"White%20Sign%20Soapstone%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;White Sign Soapstone&lt;/a&gt; and receiving a Token of Fidelity or find the one in &lt;a href=\"Huntsman%27s%20Copse\"&gt;Huntsman's Copse&lt;/a&gt; along with a &lt;a href=\"Pharros%27%20Lockstone\"&gt;Pharros' Lockstone&lt;/a&gt; on a broken pillar or the one dropped by the red phantoms if you use a ascetic on the blue cathedral bonfire or the heide's ruin bonfire (both drop one), otherwise Blue Sentinel Targray will simply dismiss the player. Additionally, using a &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20Ascetic\"&gt;Bonfire Ascetic&lt;/a&gt; in Heide will allow red phantom Blue Sentinels to spawn that drop three Tokens of Fidelity.\nLore.\nThe Blue Sentinels are a group that descended directly from the original &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Darkmoon\"&gt;Blade of the Darkmoon&lt;/a&gt; covenant that served &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Dark Sun Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this they were part of the group that at some time left the city of the gods and &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt; and reached &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt;, founding the civilization of &lt;a href=\"Heide%27s%20Tower%20of%20Flame\"&gt;Heide&lt;/a&gt; as Heide's &lt;a href=\"Old%20Knight\"&gt;Knights&lt;/a&gt;\nstill possess the &lt;a href=\"Cracked%20Blue%20Eye%20Orb\"&gt;Cracked Blue Eye Orb&lt;/a&gt;s, the worn remains of the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Eye%20Orb\"&gt;Blue Eye Orb&lt;/a&gt;s that were granted to the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Blade\"&gt;Blades of the Darkmoom&lt;/a&gt; that served Gwyndolin to mete out the vengeance of the gods at the times of Anor Londo\nThey shared their origin with that of the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20Blue\"&gt;Way of Blue&lt;/a&gt;, which was not a developed religion but a humble prayer that spread naturally among those seeking help, but which eventually grew to the point that a huge &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Blue\"&gt;Cathedral of Blue&lt;/a&gt; was built in the heart of the city and that the Blue Sentinels used as their headquarters. The Blue Sentinels served the same role of the organization they originated from and thus were tasked with defending the apostles of Blue from evil spirits by traveling between space and time thanks to the &lt;a href=\"Cracked%20Blue%20Eye%20Orb\"&gt;Cracked Blue Eye Orb&lt;/a&gt;s, the remnants of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Eye%20Orb\"&gt;Blue Eye Orb&lt;/a&gt;s. The victorious knights would be rewarded with miracles from the ancient gods of Anor Londo like &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Gods%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Wrath of the Gods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bountiful%20Sunlight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Bountiful Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; that had been lost or jealously guarded elsewhere in Drangleic, implying that they had inherited a strong relationship with the knowledge of the culture of the gods of Lordran.\nAt some point Heide was destroyed due to the rise of the sea levels the city faced and most of it ended up subsumed by the water, the city became a pile of unsafe submerged rubble but the upper part of the city and the Tower of Flame continue to exist and host the headquarters of the Blue Sentinels with &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Sentinel%20Targray\"&gt;Targray&lt;/a&gt;at its command. The organization would continue to exist to protect the members of the Way of Blue, testing the adventurers who arrived in Heide and were confronted by the remaining &lt;a href=\"Heide%20Knight\"&gt;Heide Knight&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Old%20Knight\"&gt;Old Knight&lt;/a&gt;s.\nand the Cathedral of Blue was defended by an &lt;a href=\"Old%20Dragonslayer\"&gt;Old Dragonslayer&lt;/a&gt; as the ultimate challenge before reaching the leader of the covenant.\nDespite Heide's fall, the Blue Sentinels continued to exert enormous influence in countries near Drangleic. For example in &lt;a href=\"Volgen\"&gt;Volgen&lt;/a&gt;, a city ruled by the clerics of the Way of Blue, the Sentinels possess great power and have the right to decide who can run a shop through their blessing."}
