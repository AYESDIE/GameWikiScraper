To the east, Drangleic borders with the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Mirrah\"&gt;Mirrah&lt;/a&gt; while in the distant east the land of &lt;a href=\"Jugo\"&gt;Jugo&lt;/a&gt; and the ruins of the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Forossa\"&gt;Forossa&lt;/a&gt; are located. To the northeast, Drangleic borders with the frozen ruins of the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Eleum%20Loyce\"&gt;Eleum Loyce&lt;/a&gt;. To the west, Drangleic borders with the city of &lt;a href=\"Volgen\"&gt;Volgen&lt;/a&gt;. To the south, Drangleic borders with the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Melfia\"&gt;Melfia&lt;/a&gt; while in the distant south the land of &lt;a href=\"Lanafir\"&gt;Lanafir&lt;/a&gt; is located.\nLore.\nDrangleic's Rise.\nThe kingdom of Drangleic was founded by &lt;a href=\"Vendrick\"&gt;Vendrick&lt;/a&gt; when, together with his older brother &lt;a href=\"Aldia%2C%20Scholar%20of%20the%20First%20Sin\"&gt;Aldia&lt;/a&gt; and his mighty army, he invaded and trampled the domains belonging to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Iron%20King\"&gt;Old Iron King&lt;/a&gt;, the ruins of previous realms and the surrounding lands, uniting the inhabitants of the region and raising up his great country with them.\nVendrick was the leader of a people of skilled warriors whose cavalry did not employ ordinary horses but instead rode wyrms, a race of land wyverns. Those who fought on the backs of these creatures had the title of &lt;a href=\"Dragonrider\"&gt;Dragonrider&lt;/a&gt;s, but their rank was obtained only by the strongest. Vendrick was a leader close to his soldiers and he liked simple and honest warriors that relied only on their own brute strengthand consequently he formed his army so that they did not depend on sorceries or miracles but on physical abilities alone. Even before they could aspire to ride wyrms, Vendrick's warriors had to learn to wield &lt;a href=\"Dragonrider%20Bow\"&gt;great bows&lt;/a&gt; that required inhuman strength just to merely draw them and great skill to shot. In order to then become fully-fledged Dragonriders, these knights were called to tame their wyrms and those who were not able to handle them were torn apart and devoured by the creatures. But those who emerged victorious could boast a deific strength and so Vendrick's knights, together with their wyrms and &lt;a href=\"Dragonrider%27s%20Halberd\"&gt;halberts&lt;/a&gt; imbued with &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, became feared on the battlefield . \nOnce his Dragonrider knights had finished serving in the campaigns that had unified Drangleic and helped found the kingdom of Vendrick, he rewarded his faithful warriors by granting them to serve as his royal guard. The king organized his army with a few simple ranks like the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Guard\"&gt;Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Swordsman\"&gt;Royal Knights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Soldier%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Royal Soldiers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Infantry\"&gt;Royal Infantry&lt;/a&gt;. Vendrick gave great importance to his army, including even simple infantry in the ranks of \"Royal Army\", and equipping each individual soldier with equipment constructed by the royal blacksmiths from high quality materials and &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Soldier%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; with a design inspired by a &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20Leeroy\"&gt;brave knight from an old legend&lt;/a&gt;, obtaining immense loyalty from his soldiers, which did not relent even when they became hollows. The king would also reward those among his soldiers who would distinguish themselves with &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Soldier%27s%20Ring\"&gt;magical rings&lt;/a&gt; capable of increasing the weight of the equipment they could carry, as proof of their meritorious deeds. &lt;a href=\"Velstadt%2C%20the%20Royal%20Aegis\"&gt;Velstadt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fume%20Knight\"&gt;Raime&lt;/a&gt;, two distinguished knight, became the left and right arms of Vendrick. Raime followed his lord because he sought a great strenght and found it in the regal father figure of the king, while Velstadt gave himself in both life and death to his lord because when he arrived in Drangleic he had been reduced to a shadow of his former self and had lost everything including even including the reason why he had abandoned his land. Velstadt also became the leader of the elite &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Knight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;knights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Soldier\"&gt;soldiers&lt;/a&gt; that guarded the Royal Castle and were equipped with refined shields and armors created by the blacksmith of the castle.\nAs the King of Drangleic, Vendrick proved himself a fair and just monarch, who expected the same behavior from his subjects that he trusted and rewarded according to their loyalty and deeds. Thanks to his growing power and his army, Vendrick transformed the kingdom into a prosperous and influential nation to the point of making himself known as \"the one that ruled over the world of man\". Having obtained total political dominion over the lands that made up Drangleic, Vendrick left the already existing religious institutions and their traditions untouched. The king had a lukewarm opinion of their &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;holy powers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Priest\"&gt;clerics&lt;/a&gt; were kept at a distance from the royal court, preserving their positions only for ceremony and as they were inherited from the past but without giving them opportunities to increase their power.\nVendrick influence was so great that at some point he ordered his chancellor to hire a craftsman from &lt;a href=\"Mirrah\"&gt;Mirrah&lt;/a&gt; who knew how to manufacture the \"geisteel\" alloy produced in that country and thus gain an advantage for his army. Wellager managed to bring the artisan &lt;a href=\"Llewellyn\"&gt;Llewellyn&lt;/a&gt; with him thanks to an immense salary, thus stealing the secret of the alloy of Mirrah. Llewellyn became the castle's resident master smith and began working for Vendrick, distinguishing himself for his lack of ostentation and focus on simplicity and sturdyness. Forging &lt;a href=\"Llewellyn%20Set\"&gt;armors&lt;/a&gt; that combined lightness and strenght only for a selected few, including the chancellor himself and &lt;a href=\"Llewellyn%20Shield\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Dirk\"&gt;long dagger&lt;/a&gt; for the king himself that he then gifted to his Chancellor.\nThe artisans and blacksmiths of Vendrick even studied the advanced metallurgical technologies of the fallen civilization of &lt;a href=\"Heide%27s%20Tower%20of%20Flame\"&gt;Heide&lt;/a&gt; to try to replicate the composition of their mysterious alloy and, even if they failed, their attempt to imitate it resulted in a similar bradden steel This fine alloy was forged from ores that were mined in the south of the kingdom and were used widely, in particular to craft &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Knight%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;armors&lt;/a&gt; that provides a sturdy defense with the design of the ancient elite knights of &lt;a href=\"Astora\"&gt;Astora&lt;/a&gt;. The king also continued to be interested in sorcery, coming into possession of magic from &lt;a href=\"Melfia\"&gt;Melfia&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Greatsword\"&gt;Soul Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; and rediscovering ancient ones from &lt;a href=\"Olaphis\"&gt;Olaphis&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Bolt\"&gt;Soul Bolt&lt;/a&gt;. Vendrick also showed interest in the history of the kingdoms before his own, collecting different types of &lt;a href=\"Golem%20%28lore%29\"&gt;Golems&lt;/a&gt; created by different civilizations throughout the history of Drangleic like the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Knight\"&gt;Old Knight&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Heide%27s%20Tower%20of%20Flame\"&gt;Heide&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ruin%20Sentinels\"&gt;Ruin Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Olaphis\"&gt;Olaphis&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Belfry%20Gargoyles\"&gt;Belfry Gargoyles&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Belfry%20Luna\"&gt;Venn&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Manikin\"&gt;Manikin&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Peak\"&gt;Earthen Peak&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ironclad%20Soldier\"&gt;Old Ironclad Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Keep\"&gt;Iron Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nDrangleic's Curses.\nAt a certain point &lt;a href=\"Nashandra\"&gt;Nashandra&lt;/a&gt;, a woman of extreme beauty, arrived in Drangleic from a foreign country all by herself and entered Vendrick's good graces by becoming his consort. The woman warned the king that beyond the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Sea\"&gt;Northern Sea&lt;/a&gt; there was a country of &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Giants&lt;/a&gt;, creatures that possessed souls of immense power and that apparently presented an impeding threat to his kingdom. However, the danger to the kingdom was not the only information that interested Vendrick who must have been aware of the curse of Undeath and wished to acquire more and more power and to seek the Fire. The king was thus seduced by Nashandra's words and, following her advice, he gathered an army and crossed the sea to the north in an effort to subjugate the Giants and claim their souls for his own. When Vendrick landed on the land of the Giants he waged a brutal war against them, slaughtering, pillaging and conducting every act of barbarism with Nashandra at his side. Once his army \"triumphed\" in subjugating his enemies, they returned to Drangleic with a number of captive Giants and an immense number of souls as their prize. \nStudying the inhuman creatures and experimenting on them and their souls and also thanks to the studies on artifacts from older kingdoms, Vendrick and Aldia were thus able to understand the process of creation of the golems, creating &lt;a href=\"Golem\"&gt;Golem&lt;/a&gt;s very similar in appearance to the captured giants. As proof of his gratitude and affection for Nashandra, Vendrick made her his Queen and, using the golems, he built his &lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Castle\"&gt;Royal Castle&lt;/a&gt; as proof of his power in a specific point that the queen had indicated to him. Right under the royal castle there was in fact the ancient &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Want\"&gt;Throne of Want&lt;/a&gt;, an artifact capable of connecting to the First Flame, the source of souls and beginning of it all that the king was seeking. Studying the First Flame and the profound mysteries of the soul together with his brother Aldia, the king came to a very high understanding of the history of the world and the rules of reality, understanding how the Flame brought Disparity and everything from it, propagating souls in the world every time someone linked it, giving it new strength. He also understood how the Dark was kept under control as long as the fire flourished and that once it naturally weakened the curse would strike humans again. \nThanks to this discovery Vendrick became the monarch who came closest to becoming a true \"King\" and turning his wants into reality, as the one who would have access to the primordial Flame and its power could decide the fate of the world, either by linking it and becoming a &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord of Cinder&lt;/a&gt; to prolong the state of the world or refusing this fate and leading the world to darkness as a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Lord\"&gt;Dark Lord&lt;/a&gt;. Vendrick, however, never made either decision and continued to reign over Drangleic. Both he and his brother were not convinced by the two possible choices and, anchored to the illusion of the form that life had during the Age of Fire, they looked for a way to maintain it, searching for a way to free humans from the curse of Undeath and breaking the seal of fire that imprisoned them. As he deepened his knowledge of souls and curses, Vendrick continued to effectively reign over Drangleic, protecting the country from any external threats. Nashadra, as his Queen, helped bring peace to the kingdom, a peace that was so profound that it reminded humans of the Dark from which they came.. Furthermore, from the day the king returned from his incursion into the land of the Giants, a dark shadow gradually covered the king's expression and even his vassals could notice a change in his character.\nThe king of Drangleic became interested in the fate of other rulers of the past who might have found themselves in a situation similar to his and undertook expeditions on the ruins of the &lt;a href=\"Brume%20Tower\"&gt;Brume Tower&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shulva%2C%20Sanctum%20City\"&gt;Shulva&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Eleum%20Loyce\"&gt;Frozen Eleum Loyce&lt;/a&gt;, however later deciding to leave those lands cursed by several catastrophes, partially withdrawing his forces and sealing access thanks to &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Winter\"&gt;magical altars&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the new knowledge gained from his research on giants, the king also realized a particular golem in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Looking%20Glass%20Knight\"&gt;Looking Glass Knight&lt;/a&gt; with the purpose of using it as a ritual trial for those among his brave knights that wanted to become a part of his royal guards. This knight awaited his challengers in the King's Passage, the route taken by those that wanted to prove themselves, and was equipped with armor with high lightning defense, a thorned greatsword and a mirror that was able to deflect spells and summon warriors from other times and worlds. Similar to his army's trials before the conquest of Drangleic, those who failed in overcoming the Looking Glass Knight were simply killed by the golem as sacrifices. \nWhile Vendrick made Drangleic prosper, his older brother Aldia never took an interest in the political affairs of the kingdom he had helped found, preferring to remain in his mansion and dedicating himself to research into the truths of the world. He attracted the greatest mind of the kingdom at his keep to help with his studies and strange rituals. However, his research, motivated by a boundless desire to understand life, began to take a dark turn, leading him to create blasphemous &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Geyser\"&gt;spells with a will of their own&lt;/a&gt; that chased their enemies, a clear characteristic of the darkness. He also created &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Sun\"&gt;excessively destructive pyromancies&lt;/a&gt; just to test the limits of the power of the chaos through rituals and sorceries that increased the magic imbued in a body well beyond their limits damaging the life of the caster.\nHis studies soon turned on humans too and his &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Acolyte\"&gt;acolytes&lt;/a&gt; would use every sort of instruments of dissection to open up the body of their victims in their researches and their works involved dark rituals with human sacrifices. Those who were invited to his mansion would soon become the subjects of unspeakable deeds that resulted in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ritual%20Band\"&gt;magical rings&lt;/a&gt; that turned the life of the wearer into powerful magic, monstrous creatures like the &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt;s or deformed and malformed abominations, clear examples of how Aldia was trying to mix different life forms and push the biology and souls of every creature that ended up under him to the limit, without any ethical limits and driven only by his desire for knowledge. Lord Aldia continued his twisted researches and even went so far as to experiment directly on citizens of Drangleic who were starting to become undead. In his attempts to uncover the secrets of life he came to view the undead as the key to this mystery and to understand how souls could maintain life he infused corpses with them, leaving these people horribly disfigured as a result of the unspeakable procedures that lead them to remain barely sustained by unstable and highly-volatile souls. Aldia, in his obsession with the Darksign, went so far as to carry out atrocious experiments to try to free humans from their seal. The result was the &lt;a href=\"Forlorn\"&gt;Forlorn&lt;/a&gt;, beings that lost both their corporeal form and a world to call their own, remaining simply ghosts who ended up spreading in a Drangleic where time began to stagnate. The separation from the body also deprived them of their consciousness, leaving them only to wander.\nHaving accumulated immense knowledge thanks to his vast and twisted experiments, Aldia decided to direct his research towards a goal that he believed would allow him to overcome the curse of undeath and achieve immortality: to infuse the qualities of the primordial everlasting &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; into humans, to free them from the shackles of their fleeting form and trascend, like the followers of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Remnants\"&gt;Dragon Remnants&lt;/a&gt; were trying to do using &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Head%20Stone%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;stones infused with the power of the dragons&lt;/a&gt;. The scholar obtained some of the Giants that his brother had captured and kept them in his manor as experimental subjects in an attempt to use their bodies and souls to recreate a dragon, only producing creatures with bones resembling draconic features that were killed once they had outlived their usefulness. His efforts, however, did not stop and he continued to experiment on humans to turn them into half-dragons, transforming them into &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Undead\"&gt;undead aberrations&lt;/a&gt; with deformed skulls that became close to those of the dragons but still degraded into hollows. \nAfter continuous failures he finally succeeded in a feat bordering on the impossible: creating an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Dragon\"&gt;Ancient Dragon&lt;/a&gt;. Using a &lt;a href=\"Petrified%20Dragon%20Bone\"&gt;Petrified Dragon Bone&lt;/a&gt; found on the fossilized corpse of a dragon discovered deep within the mines of &lt;a href=\"Brightstone%20Cove%20Tseldora\"&gt;Tseldora&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20a%20Giant\"&gt;Giant Soul&lt;/a&gt;, and knowledge on how souls and golems gained through decades of study, Aldia artificially created a dragon, giving it a great soul to power it as a construct and the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Memories\"&gt;fake memories&lt;/a&gt; of one of the authentic creatures that dated directly to the Age of Ancients. The last goal to be achieved was to finally transfer the immortality of the primordial dragons to a human being and therefore Aldia continued his project by artificially contriving &lt;a href=\"Shanalotte\"&gt;Shanalotte&lt;/a&gt; as a daughter of dragons. However, she was not deemed a success by the scholar either because she was unable to maintain a sufficiently humanoid form or because she was unable to overcome the chains of the Dark Sign. In the end, despite the immense resources, research, sacrifices, time and horrors committed to try to overcome the curse of humans, Aldia failed.\nIn the mountains east of Drangleic, Aldia also created the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aerie\"&gt;Dragon Aerie&lt;/a&gt; to raise hundreds of &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Dragon\"&gt;wyverns&lt;/a&gt; under the control of his spells. The &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shrine\"&gt;Dragon Shrine&lt;/a&gt; was also built at the center of the wyverns' nest, as a site of worship for the Ancient Dragon and where members of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Remnants\"&gt;Dragon Remnants&lt;/a&gt; and those who venerated the dragons and attempted to transform to obtain their immortality and transcend human existence were welcomed, also collecting artifacts such as the &lt;a href=\"Petrified%20Egg\"&gt;Petrified Egg&lt;/a&gt; to study dragon biology. After the king's brother had developed the nest to raise the creatures the Dragonriders of Vendrick's royal guard stopped riding the obsolote wyrms and moved on to creatures closer to the ancient dragons. \nDrangleic's Fall.\nOne day the peace of the kingdom ended when on the northern shores of Drangleic, an army of &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Giants&lt;/a&gt; led by the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Lord\"&gt;Giant Lord&lt;/a&gt; landed to invade the land of humans, moved only by a burning desire to take revenge for the atrocities suffered at the hands of Vendrick.\n&lt;a href=\"Sir%20Syan\"&gt;Sir Syan&lt;/a&gt;, the king's most faithful knight, as soon as he learned of the invasion, volunteered to lead the vanguard of the army to give his lord time to mobilize a sufficient number of soldiers to respond to the attack. However they were slaughtered without honor by the enemies infinitely stronger than them. The sacrifice of Syan and his party, however, allowed the king's army to gain enough time to repel the first wave of Giants. On the north coast of Drangleic, an immense fortress known as the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20of%20Fallen%20Giants\"&gt;Cardinal Tower&lt;/a&gt; was built that would become the cornerstone of the kingdom's defense. The army blacksmiths began to produce &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Swordsman%20Set\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; characterized by a shape that favored movement and also allowed for great defense, ignoring all ornamentation to make it suitable only for battle. However, even the magnificent &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Greatsword\"&gt;Royal Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;s that his knights used were terribly inadequate when fighting the mighty Giants and despite the fact that Vendrick supplied his bravest men with the best equipment available to face the Giants very few were able to demonstrate victories or return alive. The king even commissioned replicas of Syan's &lt;a href=\"Syan%27s%20Set\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Syan%27s%20Halberd\"&gt;halberd&lt;/a&gt; and bestowed them to promising knights, but not long after they donned the armor they would go throughly mad.\nAs the war dragged on and the Giants continued to demonstrate a will of steel, Vendrick's army began a progressive decline caused by unsustainable attrition. The king was forced to hire mercenaries from Forossa and Volgen to reinforce his ranks reduced by casualties and &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Sorceress\"&gt;Desert Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;es from &lt;a href=\"Jugo\"&gt;Jugo&lt;/a&gt; were added to the defense of the Royal Castle. The endless battles also began to take their toll on the population. Those who could afford it ran away to other countries while the poor were left without a place to sleep, the kingdom now reduced to ruins. The conflict continued for three generations unabated, with the Giants continuing to attack the fortifications along the northern coasts of Drangleic and trying to push their way inland towards the Royal Castle. The bodies of the many dead giants that littered the region slowly grew into gret trees, covering the area around Cardinal Tower in a dense forest. \nAt a certain point. Raime and Velstadt clashed and Raime was defeated and deemed a traitor, leading him to resign from his post and reconsider his way of life, reborning as a stalwart warrior that started to seek someone to whom he could dedicate his life. Velstadt instead continued to serve at Vendrick's side as if he was his lord's own shadow.\nTo make things worse, at a certain point Vendrick also found himself dealing with the fate that inevitably affected every kingdom in the history of the region: the First Flame present somewhere in the region began to weaken and the number of undead to grow. The king himself was forced to draw from the power of his immense soul to keep the curse at bay, feeling it growing despite all the strenght he had stolen from the Giants.\nInitially the king simply took over the existing structures that had helped keep the cursed ones at bay under previous countries such as the &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Bastille\"&gt;Lost Bastille&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"No-man%27s%20Wharf\"&gt;No-man's Wharf&lt;/a&gt;, using the golems and creatures already present such as the &lt;a href=\"Flexile%20Sentry\"&gt;Flexile Sentries&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ruin%20Sentinels\"&gt;Ruin Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; as jailers. &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Citizen\"&gt;Undead Citizen&lt;/a&gt; of the kingdom who died and returned to life cursed would thus be locked in the squalid fortress and, once the numbers swelled to fill the cells, forced inside rickety ships and sent to certain death in the open sea. But the ongoing conflict and the resulting increase in deaths would only lead to more undead and more hollows. In an attempt to stave off the curse of undeath that was plaguing his kingdom, Vendrick hired some deserted members of the &lt;a href=\"Suspicious%20Shadow\"&gt;shadow knights&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Mirrah\"&gt;Mirrah&lt;/a&gt;, skilled assassins, to put down the hollows, making them work in the &lt;a href=\"No-man%27s%20Wharf\"&gt;No-man's Wharf&lt;/a&gt; where they sent the imprisoned undead to die in the sea, but before long they became hollow themselves. More and more desperate, Vendrick came to call into his kingdom even &lt;a href=\"Prowlers\"&gt;mad warriors&lt;/a&gt; almost resembling beasts, that came from well beyond his borders and unknown lands.\nOn his own and after the failure of his brother with the attempt to give humans the immortality of dragons, Vendrick continued to search in every way and using all manner of things to purge the curse of Undeath that was slowly devouring his kingdom. One of these experiments was conducted on the &lt;a href=\"Milfanito\"&gt;Milfanito&lt;/a&gt;, creatures created by &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Nito\"&gt;Gravelord Nito&lt;/a&gt; to keep Undeads under control, who resided in the ruins of the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Amana\"&gt;Shrine of Amana&lt;/a&gt; close to the Drangleic Castle. At least one Milfanito was taken as prisoner inside the castle and she was bound to a &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;magic ring&lt;/a&gt; that was capable of making even hollows appear like humans, as the king was fascinated with reclaiming what he feared he would soon lose. At some point Vendrick learned of the monstrous rituals and experiments that his brother carried out in his &lt;a href=\"Aldia%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Keep&lt;/a&gt; even on the subjects of his kingdom. Although they had once sought the truth about souls and a mean to free humans from the curse, their means were different and the fervor of their desperate search had eventually withered their familial ties. Understanding how his older brother had now abandoned every form of morality to experiment on humans, Vendrick decided to confine him and his servants in his mansion, leaving him alive but building a King's Gate that would limit anyone from entering or leaving that wasn't the king himself, but consequently also losing access to the wyverns raised in the Dragon Aerie beyond the villa that represented an important military asset.\nWith his army exhausted by losses and desertions, Vendrick was forced to use the arts of the Old Iron King to produce the ancient &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ironclad%20Soldier\"&gt;Ironclad Golems&lt;/a&gt;, iron husks that were granted life with an enchantment of souls. These warriors wearing decrepit armor one day emerged from the Drangleic Castle and quietly assumed positions among the royal army, without speaking a word or revealing their faces. At the peak of the war against the Giants, Vendrick abandoned all moral reservations and attempted to revive the terrible experiments that his brother had carried out and which had led to the birth of the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Knight\"&gt;Primal Knight&lt;/a&gt;s. Even if only fragments of the rituals remained, the king restored the forbidden art to create the inhuman abominations, everything to obtain warriors that would match their enemies in brute strength thanks to immensely heavy &lt;a href=\"Mastodon%20Greatshield\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mastodon%20Greatsword\"&gt;swords&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mastodon%20Set\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;. \nHowever, in the darkest hour of his reign, Vendrick also understood something else: his dear Queen, Nashandra, was a creature of the Abyss that was born with an insatiable desire. She was a fragment of a &lt;a href=\"Manus%2C%20Father%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;dark creature&lt;/a&gt;, having taken human shape, became obsessed with the King's soul. Impelled by its own cravings, it sought souls, and strove to make the strength of the Giants its own, everything to reach the Throne of Want as the link for the First Flame and spread the Dark. Her painting in the castle was in fact able to curse the undead making them hollow and draining their life and only the king knows whether the depiction of the Queen is a resentful mockery, or an affectionate exaltation. At this point Vendrick had achieved a truly profound understanding of the truths of the world. He understood how at the beginning of the world the First Flame brought Disparity and with it Fire and Darkness and how the latter was seen as a curse, he understood how the fire of souls was not enough to harness the curse and how the Flame would soon fade and the souls of ancient beings would reemerge, before Dark would descend as a curse on humans, making them take their true, immortal form. With the fire extinguished men would finally regain their true form and bury the shackles that the gods imposed on them... yet he continued to look for an alternative, a way to maintain the world and life as he had always been known, frightened by the future in the dark. Just as the kingdom was on the verge of being overwhelmed by the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Lord\"&gt;Giant Lord&lt;/a&gt;'s attack, King Vendrick disappeared. As every last attemp to purge the curse of Undeath had failed he understood that the only true solution would have been to link the Fire himself, sacrificing his immense soul to, at least temporarily, eliminate the curse of and give a glimmer hope to his ruined kingdom.\nVendrick thus fled the Castle through the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Passage\"&gt;King's Passage&lt;/a&gt; never to return, fearing Nashandra's wickedness, and left the &lt;a href=\"Looking%20Glass%20Knight\"&gt;Looking Glass Knight&lt;/a&gt; behind himself, to stand ready to expunge those who would challenge him, forever true to his original command, and becoming the first line of defense against those who would attempt to pursue the runaway king into the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Crypt\"&gt;Undead Crypt&lt;/a&gt;. The king took with him only a handful of &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Soldier\"&gt;Royal Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s and the faithful &lt;a href=\"Velstadt%2C%20the%20Royal%20Aegis\"&gt;Sir Velstadt&lt;/a&gt;, who did not abandon him even when his lord left his kingdom to its own devices, and found refuge in the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Amana\"&gt;Shrine of Amana&lt;/a&gt;. Vendrick was initially intent on reaching the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Want\"&gt;Throne of Want&lt;/a&gt; and link the First Flame but in the end the king understood that if he did so, Nashandra would have gained an easy access to the throne connected to the Flame. Vendrick thus decided to free himself from his soul, abandoning it among the ruins, to descend even deeper into the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Crypt\"&gt;Undead Crypt&lt;/a&gt;. Here, left alone, he isolated himself in a secluded room wearing only his &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Set\"&gt;robes&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Crown\"&gt;crown&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href=\"Ruler%27s%20Swor\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Ring\"&gt;King's Ring&lt;/a&gt;. Now overcome by nihilism, Vendrick allowed himself to be consumed by the curse and soon became a hollow, mindlessly roaming the empty crypt forever to protect the ring that would grant access to the Throne of Want. Velstadt would continue to protect his king even in death, although the darkness of the Crypt would soon end up corrupting his soul and equipment and eroding their divine protection. The knights and soldier left at the Castle waited patiently for the return of their king and leader but turned to stone after decades of service, becoming &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Knight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Stone Knights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Soldier\"&gt;Stone Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWhile Vendrick hollowed himself out, Drangleic still suffered the onslaught of the Giants and when its army seemed about to be overwhelmed, an &lt;a href=\"Bearer%20of%20the%20Curse\"&gt;unknown warrior&lt;/a&gt; felled the Lord of the Giants and his &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Giant\"&gt;beaten and broken remains&lt;/a&gt; were then dragged beneath a stronghold to be sealed away, leaving the remaining Giants forces to scatter and flee without the &lt;a href=\"Giant%27s%20Kinship\"&gt;resonance of their leader&lt;/a&gt; to guide them. At the same time the soldiers of Vendrick defending their fortress died and eventually became hollows, but they kept their honor and continued to defend their country patrolling the area. Even if the Giants were eventually defeated victory came all too late, without a king, an exhausted army and with a country reduced to rubble, depopulated and infested with hollows, the kingdom of Drangleic fell apart.\nWith the collapse of Vendrick's kingdom the defense of the region's borders deteriorated as a result and the mountains surrounding the three sides of Drangleic became the refuge of countless brigands that would prey on the majority of travellers trying to cross them from the outside.\nAs the First Flame continued to fade out, an &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Chasm%20of%20Old\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt; opened beneath Drangleic, the result of the scattered fragments of an ancient abyss and the dissipated &lt;a href=\"Manus%2C%20Father%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Manus, Father of the Abyss&lt;/a&gt; coalescing again, began to expand across the region and absorb all things to grow, and the Darkness made itself felt even in neighboring kingdoms to those attuned to magic. A group of Undead led by &lt;a href=\"Darkdiver%20Grandahl\"&gt;Darkdiver Grandahl&lt;/a&gt;, called the &lt;a href=\"Pilgrims%20of%20Dark\"&gt;Pilgrims of Dark&lt;/a&gt;, started to make pilgrimages to what they considered holy sites and began to delve into the Dark Chasm and overcome the trials that lurked in the depths to refine the darkness within them. In the heart of the abyss the &lt;a href=\"Darklurker\"&gt;Darklurker&lt;/a&gt; manifested itself, a dark angelic creature capable of manipulating darkness along with sorcery, pyromancy and miracles and demonstrating a series of superhuman abilities.\nIn the lands outside of Drangleic the legend spread that, with the helps of the souls found in the region, the Undead would have managed to save themselves from the curse, avoiding losing their humanity and remaining Hollow forever. For this reason, those who died and returned to life as undead came to the ruined kingdom beyond the mountains with the only hope of avoiding their fate.\nCenturies after the end of Vendrick's reign, in the times and region of the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt;, Drangleic, whose name has survived only in the shortened form of \"Drang\", is known as the land of the legend of the Linking of the Fire, confirming how, at one point, a &lt;a href=\"Bearer%20of%20the%20Curse\"&gt;Bearer of the Curse&lt;/a&gt; was able to rekindle the Flame and prolong its life. Vendrick's name has been lost, however, and is only remembered as the \"Old King of Want\", an ancient ruler that was cursed by an all-consuming thirst, making him no king at all in the end. The Drangoriders of his royal guard and their immense strength are also properly remembered. A group of soldiers, who proclaimed themselves descendants from Drangleic and wore the &lt;a href=\"Drang%20Set\"&gt;geisteel armor&lt;/a&gt; made by the &lt;a href=\"Llewellyn\"&gt;blacksmith of Vendrick's Castle&lt;/a&gt;, abandoned the region and became sellswords. Known as &lt;a href=\"Drang%20Knight\"&gt;Drang Knight&lt;/a&gt;s, they scattered across the lands and quickly became known for shieldless and aggressive fighting tactis that only used their &lt;a href=\"Drang%20Twinspears\"&gt;twinspears&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Drang%20Hammers\"&gt;hammers&lt;/a&gt;, strucking fear in their enemies.

The shield also boasts very high &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt; for a medium shield, which makes it very useful for fighting enemies that only deal physical damage and for fighting bosses."}

Some items are fragile and have a low maximum durability reaching into the low tens, while some may be incredibly resilient, going as high as 999.\nIn this system there are three levels of durability, each of which affects the performance of the weapon:\nRepairing equipment.\nRepairing is the process of paying\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Soul%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; to restore durability to a piece of equipment. The cost of repair is dependent on how much durability the piece of equipment has lost. Repairing can either be done through the use of a &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;, from a &lt;a href=\"Repairbox\"&gt;Repairbox&lt;/a&gt;, through the use of &lt;a href=\"Repair%20Powder\"&gt;Repair Powder&lt;/a&gt;, or the casting of the &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;sorcery&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Repair\"&gt;Repair&lt;/a&gt;.\nHow equipment loses durability.\nEquipment can lose durability in a few ways. Armor, for example, is damaged any time you take damage. Some enemies, such as the &lt;a href=\"Gaping%20Dragon\"&gt;Gaping Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Eater\"&gt;Chaos Eater&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Burrowing%20Rockworm\"&gt;Burrowing Rockworm&lt;/a&gt;s have attacks which decrease the durability of all your equipment. There is also the spell &lt;a href=\"Acid%20Surge\"&gt;Acid Surge&lt;/a&gt; which degrades equipment in the same way as the Chaos Eaters' attacks.\nWeapons can lose durability by hitting enemies, walls or breakable objects. Attacks that are deflected, such as when striking a wall, suffer double the durability damage.\nNotes.\nWeapons and shields upgraded down the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Crystal%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;Crystal&lt;/a&gt; path suffer from greatly decreased durability, and may not be repaired in any fashion once the item is at its maximum upgrade level (as item durability is reset when upgraded). Armor cannot be upgraded in this manner.\nEquipping the &lt;a href=\"East%20Wood%20Grain%20Ring\"&gt;East Wood Grain Ring&lt;/a&gt; halves durability drain by doubling the amount of hits required to lose 1 point of durability. It does not alter Durability-damaging effects from enemies like the Chaos Eaters."}

Upon removing the ring, the number of castings will be scaled down to about 67% (rounded down). The underlying conversion seems to keep track of the number of casts with the ring equipped. Hence it is possible to equip the ring and have a 0 casting spell to be increased to 1 cast.\nThe reduction of HP is applied before HP boosting items. This results in having roughly 60% maximum HP with the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Favor%20and%20Protection\"&gt;Ring of Favor and Protection&lt;/a&gt;, 52.5% maximum HP with the &lt;a href=\"Tiny%20Being%27s%20Ring\"&gt;Tiny Being's Ring&lt;/a&gt; and 55% with the &lt;a href=\"Mask%20of%20the%20Mother\"&gt;Mask of the Mother&lt;/a&gt;, these items can also be stacked to further reduce the HP reduction.\nRemoving the ring will not restore the lost health. This can be useful as a quick way to activate the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Tearstone%20Ring\"&gt;Red Tearstone Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ring can be used to reduce fall damage. This is because fall damage is calculated by taking a percentage of the player's maximum HP. This means that the player takes only half of the usual fall damage with the ring equipped, and can use it with no consequences if their HP is less than 50%. Note that this does not allow you to fall longer distances."}

It may be viable in the early game for its high resistances, but it is easily surpassed in protection by other chest pieces.\nCuriously, as if to compensate for this statistical weakness, this armor piece alone greatly reduces the wearer's sound emission while two-handing any small / medium weapon. While gripping anything roughly longsword-sized or smaller in this fashion, and so long as their equip load stays below 50%, the wearer may slip up behind enemies at a normal movement speed whilst remaining completely undetected. Moving around after switching to a large weapon or one-handed grip will alert enemies as normal, as will rolling, attacking, and sprinting in their vicinity. Nevertheless, this tiny special attribute gives the armor piece a niche for those who may enjoy occasional light stealth, but who eschew either the &lt;a href=\"Hush\"&gt;Hush&lt;/a&gt; spell or &lt;a href=\"Slumbering%20Dragoncrest%20Ring\"&gt;Slumbering Dragoncrest Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpgrades.\nRequires 200 &lt;a href=\"souls\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; per upgrade.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"}

This disparity is especially apparent when compared to a Heavy Millwood Battle Axe, which shares its weight of 6.5 with Eleonora, but significantly out performs in regards to AR.\nEleonora isn\u2019t without advantages however. Players willing to overlook Eleonora\u2019s below average damage may find value in its superior range when compared to most of the other axes, mitigating a common shortcoming of the Axe weapon class. More notable though is Eleonora\u2019s weapon art, Feast Bell buffs Eleonora with a powerful health drain on hit, in addition to potent bleed buildup. While active, Eleonora becomes a surprisingly effective weapon against large groups of enemies, or against enemies with large health pools, especially if said enemies are prone to bleed.\nThese benefits give an otherwise outclassed weapon an interesting niche in builds or strategies centered around HP regen and sustainability.\nMoveset.\n&lt;br&gt;\nDescription.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Official translation=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nVideos.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

Doing so will add 145 &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage for roughly 45 seconds.\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nThis skill is useful for adding more damage to the weapon when facing particularly tough opponents. Of note, since it adds Fire damage it is capable of inflicting stagger on enemies that are weak to the element such as &lt;a href=\"Birch%20Woman\"&gt;Birch Women&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pus%20of%20Man\"&gt;Pus of Man&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnline gameplay.\nIt should be noted that the Onyx Blade itself deals innate &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; damage, and thus this skill adds a third source of split-damage rather than augmenting an existing element. As such, it is not quite as effective as one would otherwise believe, though it still adds additional damage and pyromancers will have no shortage of &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt; to cast this skill.\nHitting an enemy with a two-handed weak attack, and then performing the skill immediately after, will result in a true combo that inflicts high damage while also buffing the weapon."}
{"id": "143723", "revid": "33084951", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=143723", "title": "Elfriede's Stance", "text": "Elfriede's Stance is a &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Ashes%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Ashes of Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\nWhen activated, the wielder enters a stance where the support scythe is held in the off-hand and the primary scythe is wielded in the main-hand. Entering the stance consumes no &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;Focus Points&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerforming weak attacks will cause the wielder to leap forward and perform up to three attack chains with the paired scythes, while granting &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt; with 30 &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; health. The primary scythe will deal purely physical damage, while the support scythe inflicts purely &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; damage. The physical damage portion of these attacks inflict a reduced multiplier of the weapon's Attack Rating, and each scythe inflicts 85% of the weapon's &lt;a href=\"Frost\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt; build-up, resulting in 170% of the weapon's build-up per successful attack chain. Like the stance, these attack chains consume no Focus Points.\nThe strong attack will bring the support scythe back and then slash upward while conjuring a field of frost in front of the wielder. This attack possesses 35 Poise health, and inflicts 1.15 times the Magic portion of the weapon's Attack Rating as damage. This upward sweep of the support scythe will inflict the weapon's normal Frost build-up, and then the frost field will inflict 10% of the Frost build-up per tick to any enemies that remain in it. Finally, after a short duration, the frost field will erupt, staggering any foes still in the field and inflicting 2.0 times the Magic portion of the weapon's Attack Rating as damage, as well as 150% of the weapon's innate Frost build-up. This attack consumes 18 FP, or 14 FP if the wielder has the &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Ring\"&gt;Farron Ring&lt;/a&gt; equipped.\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nElfriede's Stance allows the wielder to unleash a flurry of powerful attacks at point-blank range, and is the only way to utilize the Magic portion of the weapon's Attack Rating. The weak attack can lock down foes to be helplessly cut to shreds by the paired scythes, as well as inflict tremendous Frost build-up. The strong attack can be useful when dealing with crowds of enemies in a single direction, as the frost field can deal damage and build up Frostbite in an area. This skill is best used on enemies that have little to no Poise, however, as the prolonged and repeated stagger inflicted by the weak attacks are the strongest aspect of the stance.\nOnline gameplay.\nBecause of the heavy Frost build-up and long stun-lock duration, this skill is very popular for dealing large amounts of damage, especially in co-operative gameplay. Additionally, because the attacks possess Hyper Armor it gives the wielder a very strong option for engaging enemies that manage to sneak within the arc of the primary scythe's blade, a problem that other reapers have no counter to. However, one should be wary that the physical scythe can be &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parried&lt;/a&gt;, so recklessly leaping at a foe with the paired attack chains can be easily countered by prepared opponents.\nThe strong attack, as it uses the support scythe, cannot be parried, and the frost field can create a terrain hazard that discourages foes from approaching to punish should they manage to avoid the initial upward swipe."}

They're typically brown in color and wear a loincloth. They often wield two enormous, obelisk sized stone clubs in combat. Far larger and more formidable than their subordinates, the only Elite Giants to have survived the war reside in a hidden cavern in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Gulch\"&gt;Black Gulch&lt;/a&gt;. They can also be encountered in the &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Vammar\"&gt;Memory of Vammar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Orro\"&gt;Orro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Jeigh\"&gt;Jeigh&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is impossible to receive more than one &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20a%20Giant\"&gt;Soul of a Giant&lt;/a&gt; from any of the memories, nor from Black Gulch. \nStrategy.\nUnfortunately for melee users, taking on the dual club wielding ones will be difficult as their attacks will bypass the player's &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; and their attack range is quite large. When encountered in groups, caution is advised and the best course of action to take is to try luring them out one by one. The shorter giants are a bit easier than the taller ones, as they have smaller damage output and less health. For the unarmed and single club-wielding giants, their attacks leave them vulnerable long enough for the player to attack, so long as the player can dodge or block their attacks effectively. For the poison ball throwing giants, get up close so they stop throwing poison balls and dodge/block their melee attacks until you have an opening. Lastly, for the fireball throwing giants, their fireballs are accurate and have a large area of effect that can linger for a few seconds, so blocking can be more effective than dodging. Since throwing fireballs is their only attack, blocking and then attacking should be the most effective way to dispose of them. &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;-resistant gear and a high fire reduction shield such as the &lt;a href=\"Gyrm%20Greatshield\"&gt;Gyrm Greatshield&lt;/a&gt; would make it easier to sponge their attacks.\n&lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ranged%20Weapons%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;ranged weapons&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Throwing%20Knife%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poison throwing knives&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;poison arrows&lt;/a&gt; prove quite useful in dealing with all varieties of elite giants. Pyromancies that also prove useful are &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Swathe\"&gt;Flame Swathe&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20Mist%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Toxic Mist&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Mist%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poison Mist&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor the duo in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Gulch\"&gt;Black Gulch&lt;/a&gt;, it is for unknown reason possible to receive their drops while only killing one of them if you quit out after doing so and then re-enter the game. The &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20a%20Giant\"&gt;Soul of a Giant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Key\"&gt;Forgotten Key&lt;/a&gt; they drop will then appear in your inventory without having to kill both. \nThey have a weakness to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;."}

As this set can be acquired relatively early in the game, it stands as a viable choice for low-level characters to rely on, and potentially throughout the entirety of the game with frequent upgrading.

The sword is buffed with 80 &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage, which lasts for 45 seconds.\nUsage.\nSingle Player.\nThis skill has several uses in single player, such as damaging a group of enemies at range with the flame trail while buffing the sword, or getting a powerful attack in by hitting a foe with both the sword and the fire trail for major damage. As the skill requires only &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt; and not an &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Attunement&lt;/a&gt; slot, nor does it scale, the buff can be handy for dealing powerful Fire damage on a build with little/no investment in &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnline.\nBecause the buff adds Fire damage on top of already-existing Fire damage, this skill is very useful in that it greatly reduces the effect that an opponent's Fire flat defenses have against the weapon's attacks. As such, it is noticeably stronger than applying &lt;a href=\"Charcoal%20Pine%20Resin%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Charcoal Pine Resin&lt;/a&gt; to any other weapon.\nThe fire trail can be useful in a myriad of ways, from restricting an opponent's movement, to damaging them from range, to dealing guaranteed damage in a tight corridor where they can't easily escape it. As well, the fire trail lingers longer than the invincibility frames of a roll, allowing it to easily catch players that roll through the initial forward surge. The slam itself can also be handy as a wake-up, as hitting another player with both the sword and the fire trail can easily finish them off if they have just been riposted or backstabbed.\nCare should be observed when using this skill against enemy players though, as not only can it be &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parried&lt;/a&gt;, but the long recovery frames leave the wielder extremely vulnerable to backstabs. Careful spacing and judicious management of stamina can prevent foes from easily taking advantage of the recovery frames."}

A normal attack will cause the wielder to lunge forward and thrust with both greatswords, while a strong attack will perform a leap into a downward slam that creates an explosion at the impact point.\nUsage.\nSingle Player.\nAll phases of the skill can deal tremendous damage when they hit. Against tough enemies, it can be useful to initiate the skill at point-blank range, to hit the target with both the greatsword sweep and the projectile, then performing the second phase and letting the enemy's hitbox block the momentum to strike in place.\nOnline.\nThe initial projectile is difficult to use, as it has very little steering capability once activated; the wielder will launch the projectile in the initial facing direction and will have little control over changing its direction. However, the second phase of the skill has considerably more steering power, being capable of being directed to the sides of the initial direction of the projectile.\nWhat this skill provides is strong gap-closing power, as the projectile has moderate range and both the normal and strong attacks possess strong forward momentum, carrying the wielder closer to a distant target."}

Igniting the spear will buff it with 90 &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage for 30 seconds.\nThe initial thrust can be chained into up to two strong attacks. The first strong attack will perform a strong clockwise spin, trailing fire behind the head of the spear. The second strong attack will thrust the spear upward, launching a surge of fire forward.\nUsage.\nSingle Player.\nThis skill gives the Ringed Knight Spear a powerful buff as well as strong thrusting and spinning attacks to suit the situation. The flame surge has a moderate width, giving the spear a way to deal with multiple enemies at once.\nOnline.\nThe wielder will have full control over direction for the entire duration of the skill. This allows skillful players to change the direction of their leap, sweep targets that get behind them and then launch the trail of fire to catch opponents who try to roll away. As well, the initial leap can act to foil players that try to keep out of the spear's long reach, closing the distance quickly.\nBeware that all phases of this skill can be &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parried&lt;/a&gt;."}

The first attack will have the wielder swing the sword twice horizontally, from right to left then back. The second attack is similar to the first, only wilder in arc. The third attack will perform a strong clockwise spin. Subsequent attacks will start over again from the first attack.\nThe strong attack can chain twice. The first attack has the wielder lunge into a powerful thrust with strong forward momentum, while the second attack results in a powerful overhead slam.\nUsage.\nSingle Player.\nThis skill can give the wielder a strong burst of &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage with the attacks, useful against enemies that are weak to the element. Because the Ringed Knight Straight Sword is largely a quality weapon, this gives the wielder the ability to inflict strong Fire damage without investing into caster stats.\nOnline.\nThis skill provides strong horizontal coverage with the normal attacks, as well as strong chasing power with the strong attacks.\nThe first two normal attacks are a true combo, allowing the wielder to hit an opponent up to four times. This can be followed up with the strong attack to chase them down as they try to roll away to recover, and has strong roll-catch potential. However, care should be taken when using this skill, as all parts of it can be &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parried&lt;/a&gt;."}

Bringing her &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20Shard\"&gt;Estus Flask Shard&lt;/a&gt;s will increase the total amount of charges that the Flask can hold.\nShe gives the player the &lt;a href=\"Aged%20Feather\"&gt;Aged Feather&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0when spoken to upon arrival in &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aerie\"&gt;Dragon Aerie&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nThe Emerald Herald's real name is Shanalotte, a name given to her by the &lt;a href=\"dragons\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;. Born of dragons but contrived by men, she was created specifically to break the &lt;a href=\"undead%20curse\"&gt;undead curse&lt;/a&gt;, but her creators failed and she did not come out as intended. Despite this, she guides &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; towards the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Want\"&gt;Throne of Want&lt;/a&gt;, waiting for a powerful undead that might defeat the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Old%20Ones\"&gt;Four Old Ones&lt;/a&gt;, succeed &lt;a href=\"Vendrick\"&gt;Vendrick&lt;/a&gt; and end the undead curse.\nShe eventually finds this someone in the &lt;a href=\"Bearer%20of%20the%20Curse\"&gt;Bearer of the Curse&lt;/a&gt;, an undead with no memory of their origins from a far away land. Shanalotte guides the Bearer of the Curse in their quest, telling them to seek &lt;a href=\"Soul\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; and to seek the king. She will guide the Bearer of the Curse to seek out the Four Old Ones in order to claim their powerful souls. Once the Bearer of the Curse has done this, the way to &lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Castle\"&gt;Drangleic Castle&lt;/a&gt;, the home of Vendrick, will be open. Shanalotte will wait outside the castle, directing the Bearer of the Curse to enter.\nShe will next appear in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Crypt\"&gt;Undead Crypt&lt;/a&gt;, where Vendrick now wanders aimlessly. After the Bearer of the Curse has claimed the king's ring, she will direct them to follow the mark of the king and journey east, and warn them that if they continue on this path, they too will one day walk these same grounds, without really knowing why.\nShanalotte will once again appear once the Bearer of the Curse has reached the Dragon Aerie. Here, she will reveal that it was her manifestations that led them here, and has been guiding them all along. She directs the Bearer to the top of the aerie, where the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Dragon\"&gt;Ancient Dragon&lt;/a&gt; awaits them.\nShanalotte will appear one final time when the Bearer of the Curse is approaching the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Want\"&gt;Throne of Want&lt;/a&gt;. She will tell the Bearer of her origins and her true name. She will warn them that &lt;a href=\"Nashandra\"&gt;Nashandra&lt;/a&gt;, desiring the power of &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;the Flame&lt;/a&gt; and the Great Soul will come after them, but that they must persist nonetheless.\nShould the Bearer of the Curse choose to claim the throne, Shanalotte will narrate their ascent, explaining that linking the flame will cause souls to flourish anew but that the events that have transpired will play out all over again, and that it is the Bearer's choice whether to embrace or renounce this.\n&lt;a href=\"Royal%20Sorcerer%20Navlaan\"&gt;Royal Sorcerer Navlaan&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0tells the player many people believe the Emerald Herald is the last firekeeper. Navlaan will also say she is sometimes known as the \"Muse\".\nStrategy.\nIf the player lowers her health down to half, she will refuse to talk and will simply stand still. Resting at a bonfire will reset her health to normal, but she will still ignore the player until they have spoken with &lt;a href=\"Cromwell%20the%20Pardoner\"&gt;Cromwell the Pardoner&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe drops the &lt;a href=\"Aged%20Feather\"&gt;Aged Feather&lt;/a&gt; if killed."}

This spell also benefits from &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20Synergy\"&gt;miracle synergy&lt;/a&gt; in terms of its magic damage in an incremental way by 0.1 for every miracle synergy level of of its 2.4 MagAdjust modifier. The range for the spell is minimal, shorter than other offensive spells like Lighting Spear or the Soul arrow variants, but it is slightly longer than any weapon can reach. \nOverview.\nEmit Force is useful in PvE as a way of greeting a larger group of weak &lt;a href=\"enemies\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt;. It is also good against stronger enemies as it can often stun them.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, Emit force can be tricky to use owing to its inordinately long casting time, but this is slightly compensated for by its very large area of effect. Emit Force may best be used in narrow corridors to limit opponents' options. In terms of hitting an opponent, it is often best to 'dead aim' (i.e. not be locked onto your target) Emit Force and instead direct it manually towards your target or where your target is likely to dodge, as the large projectile and area of effect makes hitting non-aimed targets slightly easier.\nDescription.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Official translation=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Sooner or later they too will rise from their graves and begin to wander the world and use the power of their tiny flames conserved in the form of &lt;a href=\"Cinders%20of%20a%20Lord\"&gt;cinders&lt;/a&gt;. \nTo get this ending, the player must first give the &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20a%20Fire%20Keeper\"&gt;Eyes of a Fire Keeper&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Keeper%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire Keeper&lt;/a&gt; and summon her after defeating the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Soul of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;. Her sign appears next to the bonfire.\nThe End of Fire (Alternative).\nIn this ending the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20One\"&gt;Ashen One&lt;/a&gt; strikes the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Keeper%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire Keeper&lt;/a&gt; down before the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; is completely extinguished by her. The Ashen One then tramples her limp body and takes the Fire from her hands. Kneeling, the Ashen One raises the Flame, offering it to the sun obscured by a fire-dripping eclipse that resembles the &lt;a href=\"Darksign%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark Sign&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo get this ending, the player must strike the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Keeper%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire Keeper&lt;/a&gt; before the light fades and everything turns to darkness.\nThe Usurpation of Flame.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20One\"&gt;Ashen One&lt;/a&gt; stretches out a hand and the flame spread to their body that begins to burn. However they are able to absorb the entirety of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; inside of their body and the strain makes them collapse on the ground. \nAn indefinite amount of time later, the Ashen One rises again, having successfully controlled the power of the Flame within themselves. The sun obscured by a light-dripping eclipse that resembles the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sigil\"&gt;Dark Sigil&lt;/a&gt; follows the movements of the Ashen One, indicating that the Flame lives within them, but the world is shrouded in a patina of darkness and time is still. In front of them, &lt;a href=\"Yuria%20of%20Londor\"&gt;Yuria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liliane\"&gt;Liliane&lt;/a&gt;, the last two sisters of the Sable Church of &lt;a href=\"Londor\"&gt;Londor&lt;/a&gt; kneel at their feet and pay their respect. Behind them, &lt;a href=\"Anri%20of%20Astora\"&gt;Anri&lt;/a&gt; kneel in service and dozens of Hollows are prostrated in prayer, adoring their long-awaited Lord of Hollows. The Lord then sets out into the world, with both the powers of Fire and Darkness under their control and thus the ability to shape the world in any way they wish.\nTo get this ending, the player must complete a strict and complex questline:"}

In terms of equipment load, Endurance softcaps at 40. It is not usually worth going over this softcap. \nStamina.\n Stamina is represented by the green bar on the top left corner of the screen. One large chunk of the bar is approximately 28.57 stamina. Actions such as dashing and attacking reduce stamina which after a brief pause begins regenerating. \u00a0If the player runs out of stamina, they temporarily cannot attack or dash.\nIf a character is blocking and a blow exceeds the amount of stamina needed to absorb the damage, that character is then staggered, left wide open, and takes the excess damage. This mechanic is dependent on\u00a0&lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt;.\nStamina is capped at 160, which is reached at level 40 endurance; further levels do not increase stamina. Stamina can also be increased by the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Favor%20and%20Protection\"&gt;Ring of Favor and Protection&lt;/a&gt;, even if the 40 endurance cap has been reached.\nStamina Regeneration Rate.\nStamina has a base regeneration rate for all players, regardless of soul level or stats: 45 stamina per second. The regeneration rate can be increased passively while wearing the &lt;a href=\"Mask%20of%20the%20Child\"&gt;Mask of the Child&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grass%20Crest%20Shield\"&gt;Grass Crest Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cloranthy%20Ring\"&gt;Cloranthy Ring&lt;/a&gt;, consuming a &lt;a href=\"Green%20Blossom\"&gt;Green Blossom&lt;/a&gt;, or casting &lt;a href=\"Power%20Within\"&gt;Power Within&lt;/a&gt;. Green blossoms and Power Within do not stack, but all other effects will stack with each other.\nRegeneration rate is lowered by 80% while the player has his/her guard up or while climbing a ladder. Wearing heavy armor pieces reduces this regeneration rate by 1-2 stamina per second. If the player is heavily burdened (more than 50%), then stamina will regenerate 20% slowed. If the player is over-burdened, the penalty is 30% instead.\nEquipment Load.\n Equipment load determines how much equipment the player can equip before being affected by movement penalties. The softcap for endurance is 40 in terms of carry weight. The\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Mask%20of%20the%20Father\"&gt;Mask of the Father&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Havel%27s%20Ring\"&gt;Havel's Ring&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Favor%20and%20Protection\"&gt;Ring of Favor and Protection&lt;/a&gt; also improve equipment load. Though Mask of the Father is so heavy it usually cancels out its own effect. \nIt is generally advised to keep equipment load at or below 25% in order to stay nimble. For more information roll types visit the &lt;a href=\"Rolling\"&gt;Rolling&lt;/a&gt; page. "}

Endurance's main effect is to increase both the player's &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt;, as well as their total &lt;a href=\"HP%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; however, this does not increase it as much as raising &lt;a href=\"Vigor\"&gt;Vigor&lt;/a&gt; will. Endurance is also interactive with &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vitality%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt;, the sum of which determines the player's natural &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; Defense. Finally, Endurance is also interactive with the &lt;a href=\"Adaptability\"&gt;Adaptability&lt;/a&gt; stat, in that raising the two stats at the same rate will grant extra natural &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Demon%27s%20Souls\"&gt;Demon's Souls&lt;/a&gt;\", raising Endurance does not improve a character's &lt;a href=\"Equip%20Load\"&gt;Equip Load&lt;/a&gt;.\nStat development.\nDefense Bonus is leveled by the average level of between &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;, Endurance and &lt;a href=\"Vitality%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt;. Every &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; piece can have a Scaling percentage that determines how it multiplies this value.

Leveling up Endurance will raise the player's stamina by 1 - 3 points up until 40, which is the softcap. At 40 points or greater, 5 or more levels will have to be invested into the stat to receive additional points in stamina.\nStamina is needed to perform various actions in the game, such as guarding, attacking, casting various spells, running, jumping, and dodging, to name a few. Once a player's stamina is exhausted, they will be unable to perform actions until it regenerates. Attempting to perform any actions after stamina is depleted will delay the rate at which it begins to regenerate.\nPlayers that guard against attacks will eventually have their &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Break\"&gt;guard broken&lt;/a&gt; once their stamina is depleted, resulting in them staggering back and being prone to a critical attack.\nVarious items and equipment found throughout the game can improve stamina regeneration or hamper it. Such items include &lt;a href=\"Green%20Blossom%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Green Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Grass%20Crest%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Grass Crest Shield&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Chloranthy%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Chloranthy Ring&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Greatshield%20of%20Glory%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Greatshield of Glory&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, they are usually outside of melee range, so one must use ranged weapons or magic to fight them.\nIt can be worthwhile to seek out and kill them whenever they are encountered, as they always drop a clump of &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Moss\"&gt;Poison Moss&lt;/a&gt; upon death.

It is visible from inside the room with the stone plate door's lever leading to the 2nd switch bridge (the corpse is inaccessible a level above your head). Pass through the stone plate door after opening it, instead of turning left, carry on few steps to the stairs connected to nothing (falling to your death alert), drop off on your right to a ledge, then to another back to the main Catacombs rocky block.\nCharacteristics.\nThe Great Scythe deals decent damage, and its low requirements and weight make it easily accessible to most players, primarily scaling off &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; unlike the usual \"Quality Scaling\" of most weapons in the &lt;a href=\"Halberd\"&gt;Halberd&lt;/a&gt; class. The fast and wide running attack and strong attacks make the Great Scythe a great weapon for \"dead-angling\" though this unintended mechanic has been removed in the Remastered version of the game. \nLike all Halberds, if the attack doesn't connect with an enemy, the user will stumble and seem to not be able to handle the weight. If the hit connects, the stumble animation does not come into play and the user moves as normal. This means that Great Scythe is capable of getting &lt;a href=\"https%3A//darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_%28Dark_Souls%29%23Sweet_Spot_Damage_Bonus\"&gt;Sweet Spot&lt;/a&gt; Bonus Damage. Unlike most Halberds, Great Scythe does not deal &lt;a href=\"Thrust%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Thrust&lt;/a&gt; damage and does not get &lt;a href=\"https%3A//darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_%28Dark_Souls%29%23Counter_Damage\"&gt;Counter Damage&lt;/a&gt; bonuses, making it and the other Scythe-named the weaker weapons within the Halberd class.\nThe Great Scythe builds up &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;bleed&lt;/a&gt; at a rate of 30 per strike and is very similar to the &lt;a href=\"Lifehunt%20Scythe\"&gt;Lifehunt Scythe&lt;/a&gt;, possessing near-identical stats and an identical moveset. The Great Scythe holds the advantage over the Lifehunt Scythe of not having self-bleed buildup, as well as being &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Augmentation\"&gt;enchantable&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, it inflicts less buildup on opponents and deals slightly less base &lt;a href=\"Physical%20Damage%20Types\"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; damage.\nUpgrades.\nScaling Percentage Values.\nThe following chart lists the scaling percentages when this weapon is fully upgraded.

Go upstairs, turn around and jump toward the broken wooden floorboards to reach it.\nCharacteristics.\nThe Great Scythe is the archetype of its weapon class, a long-reaching polearm which can damage targets through raised shields.\nFound early in the game, the Great Scythe's attributes make it attractive to builds that specialize in &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;. It is also the lightest reaper in the game, allowing builds with low &lt;a href=\"Vitality%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt; to wield it with few problems. As with other polearms, it possesses a sweet-spot mechanic where hitting a target with the blade of the weapon will inflict full &lt;a href=\"Slash%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Slash&lt;/a&gt; damage, but if the target is inside of the weapon's arc it will inflict reduced damage and deal &lt;a href=\"Strike%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Strike&lt;/a&gt; damage instead.\nIt is one of two reapers in the game that can be &lt;a href=\"Infusion%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;infused&lt;/a&gt; to meet the wielder's specific build needs, the other being the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Corvian%20Scythe\"&gt;Great Corvian Scythe&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to its larger cousin, the Great Scythe has more lenient stat requirements, making it more ideal for elemental builds that do not wish to level &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and Dexterity too much. However, its damage output is weaker in virtually all cases, making the Corvian Scythe much more favored, especially in &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; situations.\nHowever, the Great Scythe's most powerful asset is that, on top of being the lightest reaper in the game, it is also the one with the longest reach. With proper spacing, the Great Scythe is able to defeat virtually all &lt;a href=\"Halberds%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;halberds&lt;/a&gt; in the game, and can even outreach most &lt;a href=\"Spears%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;spears&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pikes\"&gt;pikes&lt;/a&gt;. In the hands of one with patience, the Great Scythe is a powerful asset.\nMoveset.\n&lt;br&gt;\nUpgrades.\nReinforced with .\n&lt;br&gt;"}

This makes it particularly tough, even among greatshields, as it allows its wielder to absorb numerous consecutive attacks and then be able to retaliate once the opponent has exhausted their stamina. Its elemental resistances are respectable for the most part, being able to block &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; attacks particularly well.\nHowever, the drawback of this greatshield, beyond its massive &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; wielding requirement, is that while equipped it reduces stamina regeneration by 20 points per second, effectively halving it from the default 45 points per second. This can prove to be a fatal flaw should the wielder exhaust their stamina while blocking attacks, as it will take twice as much time to recover stamina, and smart opponents can exploit this weakness by stacking numerous stamina debuffs, such as &lt;a href=\"Impact\"&gt;Impact&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frost\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt;, to render the wielder helpless. This means that in order to mitigate this flaw, it may be necessary to commit a ring slot to a &lt;a href=\"Chloranthy%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Chloranthy Ring&lt;/a&gt; and to actively consume &lt;a href=\"Green%20Blossom%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Green Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; while using this shield.\nUpgrades.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

Because of their high weight, most greatshields will require the wielder to invest not only in Strength, but also &lt;a href=\"Vitality%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt; to fortify their &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; pool.

Greatshields are incapable of performing &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parries&lt;/a&gt;, and instead allow the wielder to &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Bash\"&gt;Shield Bash&lt;/a&gt; their foes, or perform the &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Skill\"&gt;Weapon Skill&lt;/a&gt; of their right-hand weapon without having to two-hand it.\nBecause of their innately high &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt;, upgrading a greatshield is crucial, as increasing their already strong stability will allow them to virtually ignore the stamina damage dealt by smaller weapons."}

However, the Greatsword requires four extra strength to use and weighs two units more. In turn, it also gains the ability to thrust with its strong attacks, as opposed to the Zweihander's overhead swings.\nContrary to popular belief, Greatsword is NOT a \"Strength Weapon\" but is a \"Quality\" Scaling weapon meaning it scales near equally off &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; and will be at its full potential at the relevant stat softcaps. \nThe thrust attacks have the advantage of dealing &lt;a href=\"Thrust%20%28Damage%20Type%29\"&gt;thrust&lt;/a&gt; damage, which is usually more damaging than a &lt;a href=\"Regular%20%28Damage%20Type%29\"&gt;regular&lt;/a&gt; attack with the same attack rating. The attack is relatively fast, and has a good range, allowing it to be used somewhat like a heavy version of the &lt;a href=\"Halberd\"&gt;Halberd&lt;/a&gt;. It works well for counterattacks, and when combined with the &lt;a href=\"Leo%20Ring\"&gt;Leo Ring&lt;/a&gt;, can be absolutely devastating. However, the thrust attack doesn't deal as much poise damage as the Zweihander's strong attack, meaning heavily armored foes may become more troublesome to deal with.\nUpgrades.\nScaling Percentage Values.\nThe following chart lists the scaling percentages when this weapon is fully upgraded.

Unfortunately, because the weapon weighs in at 22.0 units, it is also exceptionally heavy, making it difficult to use effectively at lower levels.\u00a0\nWith broad swipes and immense power, its strong attacks can knock down multiple enemies with ease. It also can stagger opponents easily because of its very high poise damage, making it an exceptional weapon for crowd control situations.

Its overhead swings reach high above the wielder, and its horizontal attacks cover a large area in front of the wielder. The Greatsword also features a low &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; requirement of 10 and the highest potential attack rating of all &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Gem\"&gt;Heavy&lt;/a&gt;-infused ultra greatswords, lending itself well to &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt; builds looking to overpower their enemies.

Because its damage scales with all three stats, it is capable of dealing split damage, making it a good weapon for fighting shield-equipped opponents.\nUtilizing the &lt;a href=\"Bastard%20Sword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bastard Sword&lt;/a&gt; moveset, the Greatsword of Judgment specializes in horizontal and vertical swings and as a result can be lacking in reach. However, these wide swings also give it strong area coverage, allowing it to clear crowds with the horizontal swings and hit overhead targets with the vertical swings. Use of a weak attack from the &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;'s stance also gives it the ability to perform a thrust attack, covering the weakness in its standard moveset.\nWhile it cannot be buffed by spells or resins, &lt;a href=\"Stance%20of%20Judgment\"&gt;Stance of Judgment&lt;/a&gt; allows the player to temporarily increase the &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; damage it deals for a time after performing a powerful attack. While this buff adds less damage and persists for a shorter duration than a properly built &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Magic%20Weapon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Crystal Magic Weapon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Blade%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Darkmoon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, the buff is integrated into the special attacks from the stance, and thus can be activated quickly in the midst of battle while also inflicting strong damage against a foe with the attack itself. This gives the Stance of Judgment an advantage over standard buffs due to the speed with which it can be applied, lack of requirement of an &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Attunement&lt;/a&gt; slot, and comparatively low &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt; cost. As well, this buff is applied on top of existing Magic damage, which is otherwise not possible in any case outside of buffing a &lt;a href=\"Drakeblood%20Greatsword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Drakeblood Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;.\nDue to the high FP cost of the skill, investment into Attunement and equipping an off-hand &lt;a href=\"Simple%20Gem\"&gt;Simple&lt;/a&gt;-infused weapon/shield may be useful."}

In human form, it will have an extremely low attack rating, while it will have a slightly above-average damage output when fully hollowed.\nIts &lt;a href=\"Moveset%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;moveset&lt;/a&gt; is similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Loyce%20Greatsword\"&gt;Charred Loyce Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;; however, two-handed light attacks are standard greatsword swings.\nThe Greatsword also has a very interesting interaction with some &lt;a href=\"infusion\"&gt;infusion&lt;/a&gt;s. Infusing the weapon with &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Stone\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; will give the weapon poison damage without reducing any base damage stats. However, physical scaling is still reduced, although the Dark scaling will be boosted to a B. Infusing the weapon with &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20Stone\"&gt;bleed&lt;/a&gt; will actually give a small \"increase\" to all base damage, with the Bleed damage receiving a much larger boost. The scaling will take a similar effect to poison infusions, however. Infusing the weapon with &lt;a href=\"Darknight%20Stone\"&gt;dark&lt;/a&gt; will only grant a C scaling, but due to matching the innate Dark damage, the player will get considerably more scaling out of this C than the B scaling the status infusions provide."}

Go downstairs once more and then down the ladder. Move through three rooms and then downstairs and to the right, Greirat's cell is at the bottom.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cell%20Key\"&gt;Cell Key&lt;/a&gt; is required to open the cell; it can be found in the room with exploding barrels and several &lt;a href=\"Large%20Hollow%20Soldier\"&gt;Large Hollow Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Starved%20Hound\"&gt;Starved Hound&lt;/a&gt;s, below the roof with the &lt;a href=\"Pus%20of%20Man\"&gt;Pus of Man&lt;/a&gt;. From this roof, head down the ladder on the right, turn around and go inside the building. Move through this area, down two sets of stairs until reaching a large room that has an &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Shard\"&gt;Estus Shard&lt;/a&gt; lying on an anvil. The Cell Key is in a corner of this room, down a small staircase guarded by a &lt;a href=\"Starved%20Hound\"&gt;Starved Hound&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter being freed, Greirat will relocate to &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt; and stay near the base of the staircase on the west wing.\nQuestline.\nAfter thanking the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20One\"&gt;Ashen One&lt;/a&gt; for freeing him, Greirat asks a favor; he bestows the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Tearstone%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Blue Tearstone Ring&lt;/a&gt; to the player under the condition that they find and give it to a woman named Loretta who lives somewhere in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Undead Settlement&lt;/a&gt;. He then warps to &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt; and offers mercantile services.\n&lt;a href=\"Loretta%27s%20Bone\"&gt;Loretta's Bone&lt;/a&gt; is found on a body hanging from the balcony of the first three-story building encountered in the Undead Settlement. It can be knocked down by attacking it with a weapon or projectile. Once the player collects the item and gives it to Greirat, he allows them to keep the ring. After this, Greirat's services will become temporarily unavailable as he grieves for Loretta. Interacting with him after reloading the area will bestow the \"Curl up\" &lt;a href=\"Gestures%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;gesture&lt;/a&gt;. The player needs to reload the area again in order for him to return to normal.\nAt this point, Greirat will ask the player if they would like him to use his skills as a thief and go pillage items from various areas. Agreeing to this will make him leave the shrine until an area boss (any) is defeated. Upon his return, his stock of items will be upgraded. Greirat is guaranteed to return safely from his first pillaging trip.\nOnce the player reaches the barrier at &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt; and returns to Firelink Shrine to speak with Greirat, he will ask the player if they would like him to go and pillage Irithyll. He will die in Irithyll unless certain conditions are met:\nAt this point, the player must defeat an area boss in order for Greirat to return safely. The three earliest bosses available to accomplish this are the &lt;a href=\"Curse-rotted%20Greatwood\"&gt;Curse-rotted Greatwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Sulyvahn\"&gt;Pontiff Sulyvahn&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Demon%20King\"&gt;Old Demon King&lt;/a&gt;. If the player kills &lt;a href=\"Emma%2C%20High%20Priestess%20of%20Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;Emma&lt;/a&gt; they can also defeat any of the available bosses within &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;Lothric Castle&lt;/a&gt;, and any boss in &lt;a href=\"Ashes%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Ashes of Ariandel&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"The%20Ringed%20City\"&gt;The Ringed City&lt;/a&gt; is also an option provided that they are accessible.\nIf Greirat dies during this part of his questline, the player can retrieve his &lt;a href=\"Greirat%27s%20Ashes\"&gt;ashes&lt;/a&gt; from his body located in the far-right corner of the left path in the sewers of Irithyll, surrounded by three &lt;a href=\"Sewer%20Centipede\"&gt;Sewer Centipede&lt;/a&gt;s. Bring the ashes to the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20Handmaid\"&gt;Shrine Handmaid&lt;/a&gt; and she will update her stock of wares with those Greirat initially sold, as well as those that he would have sold had he returned alive.\nOnce the player reaches &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;Lothric Castle&lt;/a&gt; and returns to speak with Greirat at Firelink Shrine, he will ask the player if they want him to pillage the castle. There is no way of saving him if he is sent to pillage Lothric Castle; if the player wishes to keep him alive, they must refrain from sending him when he asks for permission to go. However, sending him there completes his questline. Upon finding his ashes, they can be brought to the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20Handmaid\"&gt;Shrine Handmaid&lt;/a&gt; and new items will be added to her stock in addition to those previously sold by Greirat.\n&lt;a href=\"Greirat%27s%20Ashes\"&gt;Greirat's Ashes&lt;/a&gt; can be found on the rooftops of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt;, past the first &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle\"&gt;Gargoyle&lt;/a&gt; the player encounters. Continue along the rooftop outcrop where below there is a &lt;a href=\"Corvian%20Storyteller\"&gt;Corvian Storyteller&lt;/a&gt; and a group of &lt;a href=\"Corvian\"&gt;Corvian&lt;/a&gt;s. There will be a small break in the ledge where the player can drop down to the lower level without alerting any of the enemies. Continue forward where there will be an adjacent rooftop, jump to it to\u00a0find Greirat's ashes as well as three &lt;a href=\"Titanite%20Scale\"&gt;Titanite Scale&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWares.\nThird pillaging journey.\nGreirat dies during his third pillaging journey in &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;Lothric Castle&lt;/a&gt;, retrieving his ashes will add the items he had collected so far.

He has been searching for his master but cannot find him. After his rescue by the player, he expresses his gratitude by selling the player sorceries.\nGriggs' ultimate goal is finding Big Hat Logan, and they do indeed get reunited if the player did not purchase all of Griggs' items before rescuing Logan. However, Logan will leave again, leaving Griggs with some of his knowledge. Depending on the player's actions, Griggs will then be hollowed in &lt;a href=\"Sen%27s%20Fortress\"&gt;Sen's Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, or remain in Firelink Shrine until the end of the game.\nLore.\nNot much is known about Griggs, except that he is a sorcerer of the Dragon School that claims to be Big Hat Logan's apprentice. Judging from Rickert's claims that Big Hat Logan was a hundred years before his time, it can be assumed that either Rickert is from a hundred years in the future, or that Logan (and thus Griggs) are from a hundred years ago and ended up in the present timeline due to Lordran's time warping.\nHe wears the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sorcerer%20Set\"&gt;Black Sorcerer Set&lt;/a&gt;. In Vinheim, the sorcerers who wear the Black Sorcerer Set are often thieves who use special sorceries to remain undetected, like &lt;a href=\"Hush\"&gt;Hush&lt;/a&gt;, which Griggs drops upon death. In addition, he also teaches &lt;a href=\"Fall%20Control\"&gt;Fall Control&lt;/a&gt;, another spell used by the thieves of the Dragon School.\nStrategy.\nGriggs is very fragile and his sorceries pose no threat.

After a short windup, the player delivers a backhand attack, stunning their target. If the target's shield is up, their guard is broken: they are stunned for a longer period of time, during which the player can perform a &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Frontal Riposte&lt;/a&gt; on them.\nGuard breaking when unarmed or using a fist weapon is significantly faster than guard breaking with any other weapon, and can be accomplished with nearly all weapons.\nPC Issues.\nThe PC version of \"Dark Souls II\" is known to have issues when it comes performing jumping attacks and guard breaks. This is the result of issues with the adapted control scheme of the ported game.\nKeyboard+Mouse Issues.\nWhen playing with keyboard and mouse the mouse buttons are used to perform attacks, but both light and strong attacks are bound to the same button, with the strong attack being activated by double-clicking the button. For that reason there is some input lag after pressing the button (while the game checks for the second input to determine whether to perform light or strong attack) which results in impossibility to perform guard break or jumping attack with keyboard and mouse (it's extremely difficult to press W at the right time). \nThe only safe way to perform the attack is by using keyboard buttons only (W+H in default scheme performs guard break).\nThe \"\" version of the game has an option to disable double-clicking, thus removing the issue.\nGamepad Issues.\nFor some reason gamepad controls were adapted in such a way that it's extremely difficult to perform any of these attacks by pressing analog stick forward and holding the attack button (considerably more difficult than performing them in \"Dark Souls \"with gamepad) because the analog input is not recognized correctly in these situations. The exact reason for this issue is unknown.\nThe only more or less safe way to perform these moves with a gamepad is to use a gamepad mapping software (such as Joy2Key) and bind keyboard buttons to gamepad buttons: for example bind keyboard 'W' to gamepad RB, so that forward movement is activated when the attack button is pressed (Joy2Key doesn't suppress gamepad own input, so the attack function will also be activated). It would be a good idea to bind a 'shift' function to another button (e.g. A which is not otherwise used in combat) so that this guard break bind is only active while the 'shift'-button is pressed (so that regular attacks can still be performed by pressing RB).\nThis issue seems to be fixed (or at least noticeably alleviated) in \"\".\nMaking Guard Break and Jump Attack work on PC with gamepad using Joy2Key.\nThe following is information on how to make Guard Break and Jumping Attack work on PC when using a gamepad.\n\"Note:\" The XInput controller uses the 'Xbox 360 Controller for Windows' driver. The DInput controller requires running an emulator for the game to recognize it, such as &lt;a href=\"https%3A//code.google.com/p/x360ce/downloads/list\"&gt;x360ce&lt;/a&gt;. The instructions below are provided using Logitech F310.\nNote that it is possible to bind profiles to Steam games. Steam is installed in C:\\Games folder with this example (though it may default to C:\\Program Files).\nAfter launching the game, hold down A on the gamepad, then press RB/RT to activate guard break/jump attack. It is not necessary to move the analog stick in this case. Unfortunately, it will not work 100% of the time, because of certain input lag (related to in-game FPS and how binding software works)."}

Three are later encountered as non-respawning enemies in &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aerie\"&gt;Dragon Aerie&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnly in : There is one at &lt;a href=\"Heide%27s%20Tower%20of%20Flame\"&gt;Heide's Tower of Flame&lt;/a&gt;, in front of the drawbridge leading into the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Blue\"&gt;Cathedral of Blue&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nThe \"Guardian Dragon\" is a wyvern that guards the way to &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aerie\"&gt;Dragon Aerie&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to his experiments and magic, &lt;a href=\"Aldia%2C%20Scholar%20of%20the%20First%20Sin\"&gt;Aldia&lt;/a&gt; learned how to control wyverns, commanding this subject to act as a guardian and closing it inside a improvised cage located between his Keep and the Aerie. \nIn the ruins of Heide, another \"Guardian Dragon\" can be found guarding the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Blue\"&gt;Cathedral of Blue&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible that it is the mount of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonrider\"&gt;Dragonrider&lt;/a&gt; who resides nearby in Heide, the elite knights of Vendrick who once rode earth dragons and that would mount wyverns after Aldia learned to control them.\nSummoning.\nIn , &lt;a href=\"Sellsword%20Luet\"&gt;Sellsword Luet&lt;/a&gt; can be summoned from the bottom level of the large room with the dragon skeleton.\nStrategy.\nThis boss isn't too complex. Most of its melee attacks are not much of a threat. Its most dangerous attacks involve its fire breath, which has a large area of effect. Staying underneath it while it is on the ground is a good tactic, as it has only one attack that can reach you there, and it is easily dodged.\nAs it is a dragon, it is weak to &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt;. Make use of this weakness and the battle won't last for very long.\nThe Guardian Dragons in the Aerie will receive power boosts if the player destroys the eggs around the area. They will also become more aggressive and will attack on sight. If the player wishes to fight the dragons but has already broken several eggs, it is advisable to rest at a &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;. This will respawn the eggs and reset the dragons' attack power to normal.\nIn this battle, mobility is better than toughness. Being able to run away at anytime from its fire attack beats trying to shield &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; damage, and getting run down on &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttacks.\nStomp: The dragon attempts to hit the player with its foot. Easy to dodge out of the way.\nBite: The dragon lowers its head and bites to the side. &lt;a href=\"Rolling\"&gt;Rolling&lt;/a&gt; under its body is a good method.\nTail Swipe: The dragon swipes its long tail twice behind it. Roll underneath it, as it may still hit you if you go to its side.\nGround Fire Breath: The dragon lowers its head and breathes a stream of fire towards the player. Deadly if it connects, but if not, then it offers a very good chance to wail on the dragon as it cannot do anything while this attack is in process.\nAerial Fireball: The dragon flies into the air and launches a single fireball at the player. Does a pretty good amount of damage and has a fair area of effect. Snap out of your lock on and sprint as far away from the dragon as soon as he flies up.\nAerial Fire Breath: The dragon flies up in the air and breathes fire at the ground. this fire radiates over a long range. Snap out of your lock on and run away from the fire.\nAerial Turning Fire Breath: The dragon flies up in the air and breathes fire around the arena while turning. Snap out of your lock on and run away from the fire.\nGrounded Sweeping Fire Breath: Breathes fire from right to left. Difficult to avoid.\nDiagonal Fire Breath: Clings to the wall and breathes fire in a non-sweeping diagonal direction.\nDefenses.\nGuardian Dragon (boss)\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 Guardian Dragon by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHTZNpd6SSA&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

Its elemental defenses are also very sound across the board, and here it also lacks a severe weakness to &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage. It is equally resistant to all non-Bleed status effects.\nGundyr's Set also provides high &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; to back up its weight, and when wielding a heavy weapon allows the player to easily trade with virtually any other weapon, even against combos from ultra weapons. The total amount of Poise provided by Gundyr's Set is, in fact, the third-highest amount total provided by an entire set, beaten only by &lt;a href=\"Havel%27s%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Havel's Set&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Smough%27s%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Smough's Set&lt;/a&gt;."}

On his feet are what appear to be a form of moccasins and anklets, and he wields a greatsword imbued with the power of light and of the First Flame, which he uses to adequate effect. His face is that of an aged man with calm eyes, and he has an impressively long, grey beard and hair of the same nature. When the Chosen Undead fights Gwyn in the Kiln of the First Flame, Gwyn Is nothing more than an empty husk with an haggard appearance, charred skin and hollowed eyes.\nLocation.\nGwyn, Lord of Cinder can be found inside the &lt;a href=\"Kiln%20of%20the%20First%20Flame\"&gt;Kiln of the First Flame&lt;/a&gt;.\nSummoning.\nIt is possible to summon &lt;a href=\"Solaire%20of%20Astora\"&gt;Solaire of Astora&lt;/a&gt; to help in the fight if he survived in &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Izalith\"&gt;Lost Izalith&lt;/a&gt;. His summon sign can be found at the top of the staircase from Gwyn.\nLore.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;.\nGwyn is one of the primordial humanoid creatures that appeared underground after the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; appeared, bringing life, death and \"disparity\". He was one of those who found the four &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Soul\"&gt;Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt;s, souls of immense power, together with &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Nito\"&gt;Gravelord Nito&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Witch of Izalith&lt;/a&gt; and much later the &lt;a href=\"Furtive%20Pygmy\"&gt;Furtive Pygmy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThanks to the immense power of his soul, the greatest even among all the other Lords, Gwyn established an underground civilization, becoming its king and forming a developed army of &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Knight\"&gt;Silver Knight&lt;/a&gt;s at his orders. At some point Gwyn also had a relationship with an unknown woman and from their union were born his &lt;a href=\"The%20Nameless%20King\"&gt;firstborn son&lt;/a&gt; and his eldest daughter, &lt;a href=\"Gwynevere%2C%20Princess%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Gwynevere&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce his army has been prepared and armed with &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Greatbow\"&gt;huge bows&lt;/a&gt; that used &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Arrow\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; as big as iron spears and &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Spear\"&gt;massive spears&lt;/a&gt;, Gwyn went to the surface with the intention of waging war against the &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and conquer the world together with his other Lord allies. A war that turned out to be very bloody as for each of the majestic creatures slain three of Gwyn's soldiers perished , in fact the body of dragons was harder than stone and was able to resist fire and magic making their killing difficult. At one point Gwyn was even forced to integrate into his ranks the &lt;a href=\"Ringed%20Knight\"&gt;primordial humans&lt;/a&gt;, descendants of the Furtive Pygmy who had found the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Soul\"&gt;Dark Soul&lt;/a&gt;, and who had developed their own &lt;a href=\"Ringed%20Knight%20Paired%20Greatswords\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ringed%20Knight%20Set\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; infused with the life-giving power of the &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt a certain point &lt;a href=\"Seath\"&gt;Seath&lt;/a&gt;, a pale dragon born without the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Scale\"&gt;scales&lt;/a&gt; of his kind due to the \"disparity\", betrayed the dragons and stole their &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28element%29\"&gt;Primordial Crystal&lt;/a&gt; before allying himself with Gwyn. The Lord Soul of Gwyn allowed him to manipulate the light of the sun thus developed an effective countermeasure against dragons, transforming the rays of sunlight into lightning, a form of energy capable of penetrating dragon scales. Gwyn himself would thus fight against the dragons, throwing &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Spear\"&gt;spears of sunlight&lt;/a&gt; to peel apart the dragons's scales while his knights would infuse their weapons with lightning to pierce the creatures' armor more easily. The dragonslayer knights would have thus found that in order to pierce dragonscale, lightning should not be hurled as a bolt, but rather be thrust as a stake directly into the dragon's hide, to be truly effective while the few women who served in the army would have developed bows made entirely of lightning to enhance their lightning arrows.\nWith the help of the other Lords, Gwyn thus continued the war which was now turning in their favor: the Witch of Izalith and her witches weaved great firestorms, destroying the archtrees and burning the dragons while Nito unleashed a miasma of death, rotting the archtrees and infecting the dragons. Gwyn's eldest son would also take part in the war with his father, killing several dragons with his &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lightning%20Spear\"&gt;lightning spears&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Swordspear\"&gt;primordial cross spear&lt;/a&gt;. \nAfter a long struggle Gwyn and the Lords emerged victorious, exterminating most of the archdragons and thus conquering the surface world.\nDespite having won the war against the dragons, Gwyn found himself having to resolve another issue that undermined his future dominion over the world: the &lt;a href=\"Furtive%20Pygmy\"&gt;Furtive Pygmy&lt;/a&gt; had in fact found the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Soul\"&gt;Dark Soul&lt;/a&gt;, a special soul which, despite continuing to fragment among its descendants, did not lose power and indeed continued to produce life through the &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt;. The Lord, however, resolved the issue very skillfully without having to clash with the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Cleric\"&gt;pygmies&lt;/a&gt;: despite their contribution in the war Gwyn managed to make them perceive themselves as inferior to his clan and make them agree to submit and be made vassals.\nGwyn \"gave\" them a &lt;a href=\"The%20Ringed%20City%20%28Location%29\"&gt;magnificent ringed city&lt;/a&gt; at the edge of the world, the title of \"rulers\" and even his youngest daughter &lt;a href=\"Filianore\"&gt;Filianore&lt;/a&gt;, although he promised her that he would have come back for her.\nWith this clever move Gwyn ensured that the &lt;a href=\"Pygmy%20King\"&gt;Pygmies Lords&lt;/a&gt; and their Dark Soul would remain trapped inside of the Ringed City and out of history, keeping a role of subjection to his dominion, eliminating from history even the contributions of the Ringed Knights during the war against the dragons and the very existence of the Furtive Pygmy. Despite this, Gwyn continued to fear humans and the potential of their soul, going so far as to make an even more extreme move towards them: using the Flame to \"mark\" their Dark Soul and bodies with a &lt;a href=\"Darksign\"&gt;Darksign&lt;/a&gt;. The fire would thus have castrated the powers of humans, making them mortal and incapable of making use of their natural abilities thus assuming a \"fleeting form\".\nHaving secured absolute dominion over the world, Gwyn thus began the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Age of Fire&lt;/a&gt;, a time of prosperity but defined by the power of the First Flame and the vision of the Lord. Gwyn's clan placed themselves at the top of the world's order, assuming the role of deities for humans that remained subjected to their control, and Gwyn took the title \"god of sunlight\". The gods were thus venerated and lived in the city of &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; in the region of &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt;, building an economy and culture around the use of souls and even hunting the descendants of dragons for sport and domesticating &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Drake\"&gt;some of them&lt;/a&gt;. Gwyn would have left the other two Lords to their business: &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Izalith&lt;/a&gt; would have built her &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Izalith\"&gt;civilization underground&lt;/a&gt; while continuing to study flame sorcery while &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Nito\"&gt;Gravelord Nito&lt;/a&gt; would have remained in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Catacombs\"&gt;Catacombs&lt;/a&gt; to administer death with his soul.\nGwyn would also establish the order of his &lt;a href=\"Four%20Knights%20of%20Gwyn\"&gt;Four Knights&lt;/a&gt;, choosing them among his most trusted warriors and entrusting them with several vital tasks along with fragments of his powerful Lord Soul. &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Ornstein\"&gt;Dragonslayer Ornstein&lt;/a&gt; was chosen as leader of the order , &lt;a href=\"Hawkeye%20Gough\"&gt;Hawkeye Gough&lt;/a&gt; as leader of the Dragonslayers and Greatarchers, &lt;a href=\"Artorias%20the%20Abysswalker\"&gt;Artorias&lt;/a&gt; as leader of the Knights and &lt;a href=\"Lord%27s%20Blade%20Ciaran\"&gt;Ciaran&lt;/a&gt; as leader of the Lord's Blades, an order of only female assassins with the function of eliminating Gwyn's enemies in the shadows and with poison\nGwyn proved himself a skilled ruler, using his power to bind and hold close to him the potential powers of the world. He amply rewarded the betrayal of the dragon &lt;a href=\"Seath\"&gt;Seath&lt;/a&gt; and his indispensable contribution to the war, giving him the title of Duke and accepting him into the nobility of the gods and become part of his family, even going so far as to give him one of the daughters of his mother in marriage. Gwyn also gave him a &lt;a href=\"Bequeathed%20Lord%20Soul%20Shard\"&gt;fragment of his powerful Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt; along with the &lt;a href=\"Duke%27s%20Archives\"&gt;Archives&lt;/a&gt;, leaving him to his studies near Anor Londo. He also did a similar thing among the remaining humans in the world, recognizing the abilities of &lt;a href=\"Four%20Kings\"&gt;four of their great leaders&lt;/a&gt; and rewarding them with the title of king, a fragment of his powerful Lord Soul and letting them build their civilization of &lt;a href=\"New%20Londo%20Ruins\"&gt;New Londo&lt;/a&gt; near Anor Londo. At one point Gwyn also manages to befriend the &lt;a href=\"Primordial%20Serpents\"&gt;Primordial Serpent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kingseeker%20Frampt\"&gt;Frampt&lt;/a&gt; and apparently convince him of his ideals and vision of the Age of Fire.\nAt some point Gwyn would also have his lastborn child &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Dark Sun Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt; who was born with a strong affinity for moon magic and a \"fragile and repulsive appearance\", particularly due to the snakes coiled around his lower half. Due to his birth under the \"feminine sign of the moon\" and its influence that gave him a strong moon magic, as well as his lineage, Gwyn raised him as a female so that he could not officially become his heir, even making him wear &lt;a href=\"Moonlight%20Set\"&gt;women's clothing&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Reversal%20Ring\"&gt;magic ring&lt;/a&gt; which would allow Gwyndolin to move and act like a girl, leading him to behave like a sullen brooding goddess\nAt one point the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Witch of Izalith&lt;/a&gt; used her &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Soul\"&gt;Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to replicate the generative properties of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in her producing a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Flame of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; and transforming herself into a &lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; that began producing &lt;a href=\"Demon%20%28lore%29\"&gt;Demons&lt;/a&gt;. The Flame of Chaos would eventually be controlled by Izalith and her daughters, that learned how to use it, moving from being fire sorcerers to developing &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;pyromancy&lt;/a&gt; and thus creating a new society together with the demons generated by the Bed of Chaos and that learned their pyromancies too. These developments pushed Gwyn to wage war against the chaos demons, developing weapons and fighting techniques strong enough to face the size of their new enemies and sending his &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Knight\"&gt;Silver Knight&lt;/a&gt;s to Izalith. During the war their armor and weapons were charred black but despite their strength Gwyn's knights failed to defeat the demons or the Bed of Chaos, ending up retreating and only managing to banish the demons underground while also enslaving some &lt;a href=\"Batwing%20Demon\"&gt;lesser demons&lt;/a&gt; who would become servants of the gods..\nAlthough the Age of Fire and the rule of the gods lasted for centuries, at some point the First Flame began to fade out naturally. Gwyn understood that this would lead to the return of the humans, carriers of the Dark Soul, and that a Dark Lord would arise among them capable of countering its power. The god feared this outcome and his decision was drastic: sacrifice his immense soul power, link the dying Flame and prolong its life in an unnatural way thus resisting the course of nature to mantain the world of gods, a decision he made and followed personally, not delegating the sacrifice to another member of his clan. Before sacrificing himself, Gwyn divided the power of his Lord Soul among the members of his large clan and the power of the sun to his children, entrusting the inheritance of his throne and crown as \"king of the gods\" and \"god of the sun\" to &lt;a href=\"The%20Nameless%20King\"&gt;his firstborn son&lt;/a&gt;. Gwyn also left his sons and Frampt with the task of sheparding the humans, with the intention of continuing the linking of the Flame forever, creating a legend of an undead who would follow Gwyn's sacrificeand repeat his act and become a \"king\" like him.\nNow bereft of most of his Lord Soul's power, Gwyn now with only the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;power of his soul&lt;/a&gt;, left for the &lt;a href=\"Kiln%20of%20the%20First%20Flame\"&gt;Kiln of the First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, the structure built to house and protect it, with only his &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lord%20Set\"&gt;robes&lt;/a&gt;, his mighty &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lord%20Greatsword\"&gt;greatsword&lt;/a&gt; and his powerless &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20the%20Great%20Lord\"&gt;crown&lt;/a&gt;, accompanied only by a guard of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight\"&gt;Black Knight&lt;/a&gt;s. Eventually Gwyn linked the First Flame, prolonging its life but being consumed by it, remaining the first &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;empty husk of cinders&lt;/a&gt; guarding the core of the Kiln. The explosion of the newly kindled fire melted the surroundings and burned his knights to ashes, leaving them to wander the world as disembodied spirits.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn immense amount of time after his first linking of the First Flame, Gwyn's very name was lost and even his &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;miracles recounting his battles with lightning spears&lt;/a&gt; against the dragons at the start of the Age of Fire do not mention plus his name, implying that in the Drangelic region his heritage and culture have been lost. \nIn fact, the only knowledge of a \"god of the sun\" leading the clan of the gods comes from the &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;miracles that narrate the deeds of his son&lt;/a&gt;, who became king and god of the sun after him but was then exiled and deprived of his name.\nHowever in &lt;a href=\"Heide%27s%20Tower%20of%20Flame\"&gt;Heide&lt;/a&gt;, as the beacon of the culture of Anor Londo in the region, there are several statues representing him, albeit in a distorted form but resembling the characteristics of Gwyn's representations in Lordran. Although portraied with the head of an eagle, the pose, the sun medallion and the sword still strongly resemble the weapon, robes and symbology of the Lord of Sunlight.\nCenturies after Gwyn sacrificed his soul to link the Flame, some &lt;a href=\"Old%20King%20Soul\"&gt;remnants of it&lt;/a&gt; manifested again in Drangleic, continuing to exert their influence on the region. At some point the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Iron%20King\"&gt;Old Iron King&lt;/a&gt; came into contact with the soul of Gwyn, which had become \"Ichorous Earth\" and produced the schorcing iron and magma of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Keep\"&gt;Iron Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The Old Iron King was thus destroyed by the mass of iron possessed by the soul of Gwyn who then went on to control the remains of the Old Iron King creating a demonic-looking creature made of melted iron.\n&lt;a href=\"Aldia%2C%20Scholar%20of%20the%20First%20Sin\"&gt;Aldia, Scholar of the First Sin&lt;/a&gt; at some point learned of Gwyn's existence and his story but not of his name refering to him the \"Lord of Light\". He understood how Gwyn altered the natural order and began linked the Flame extending the Age of Fire against the course of nature and expresses his outrage at Gwyn for making men lesser than their original form as the \"Lord of Light\" banished Dark, and all that stemmed from Humanity with the &lt;a href=\"Darksign\"&gt;Darksign&lt;/a&gt;, defining it as the \"First Sin\" made against humans and their nature\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe remnants of the will and power of Gwyn, as the first one to ever link the First Flame, would emerge as part of the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Soul of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;, the deific manifestation of the souls of all those who have linked themselves to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; through history, becoming &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lords of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;, and thus creating an entity possessing all the abilities of the previous Champions despite just being an empty husk.. The powers of Gwyn would thus manifest themselves when the Soul of Cinder was tested by an aspiring Champion in an effort to act as the Flame's last defense inside its &lt;a href=\"Kiln%20of%20the%20First%20Flame%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Kiln&lt;/a&gt;, protecting it from by anyone attempting to link it again and acting as the ultimate test of their strength.\nStrategies.\nHealth and Stamina management are a must in this fight, as Gwyn will rarely give the player any chances to heal. It is heavily advisable to use a fast weapon to attack with, preferably one that drains little stamina. Heavy weapons are not recommended for this fight.\nIt may be hard for the player to find a proper opening to fight back or heal as a result of Gwyn actively seeking the player. Despite his very weakened state, he is still the former Lord of Sunlight, so don't rely on lightning as he is immune. His attacks deal a great amount of damage if they connect. If blocked, his attacks will still deal considerable damage to the player as a result of the flame damage his sword deals. A good way to reduce the damage to a slight margin is by using shields with high fire defense, such as the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Iron%20Greatshield\"&gt;Black Iron Greatshield&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight%20Shield\"&gt;Black Knight Shield&lt;/a&gt;, which can be dropped by the nearby &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight\"&gt;Black Knight&lt;/a&gt;s; however, care should still be taken as blocking a full attack chain will cost a lot of stamina and may eventually result in losing health or dying. The &lt;a href=\"Gold-Hemmed%20Black%20Set\"&gt;Gold-Hemmed Black Set&lt;/a&gt; can further negate the fire damage at the cost of less physical defense against his attacks.\nThe pillars in the arena can be used to block his attacks, however, Gwyn will easily move around them and continue attacking. It is possible for him to keep attacking a pillar that is blocking his path, giving the player a chance to heal, however, he may simply go around it.\n&lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte\"&gt;Parrying&lt;/a&gt; is a high-risk, but incredibly efficient strategy. All of Gwyn's attacks, minus the kick and grab, can be parried. Using the Hornet Ring, a single riposte can erase a large fraction of Gwyn's health. However, any mistakes can end up badly for the player. Therefore, it may be preferable to opt for heavier armor for this strategy, as dodging is not the main tactic, and the additional poise and defense leaves some margin for error. It is ideal to block the first hit of his combo, and parry the telegraphed second hit. After performing a riposte, the player will have just enough time to Estus heal.\nSummoning Solaire or other players can help ease the battle, giving a chance to heal or apply buffs. For Solaire, he may be able to land several hits before dying. By using the Black Knight Halberd or a spear type weapon you can hit Gwyn through the pillars and take little damage from his attacks.\nMelee strategy.\nWhile Gwyn does not provide for a lot of openings, especially if wielding a slow weapon like the Zweihander, it is possible, through using a shield with enough stability and having enough fire resistance, to use a circling strategy.\nKeeping very close to Gwyn and keeping a shield up, the player can be dealt very little damage by the flaming sword by constantly strafing to the player's left. When Gwyn attempts to grab the player or kick them, the slower animation should enable the player to get behind Gwyn's back, thus making the attack miss. At that point, there's a small window to get an attack in. With a weapon with a strong enough attack to break Gwyn's poise, the player then has a full second to finish the attack animation and get the shield back up, effectively never breaking their guard.\nUse of this strategy requires the player to keep a close look on their stamina bar.\nRegularly, though, the player will have to heal themselves, unless the fire damage is completely negated. Using the pillar strategy outlined above is quite efficient. It is a good idea to keep one's health high enough to that a grab attack can't kill with one hit. Therefore, having 20 estus flasks is recommended.\nBoss information.\nAttacks.\nDashing Thrust.\nUsed by Gwyn while he's dashing. Although it is one of his linear attacks, it is possible he may switch to a slashing combo midway. It is also one of his best attacks in terms of tracking the player.\nQuad-Slash Combo.\nGwyn performs this attack in quick succession and solid tracking. It begins with an angled slash, then a horizontal one, another angled and finally a horizontal slash once more. The angled attacks can be sidestepped if the player moves early enough.\nKick.\nTriggered regularly when blocking close to Gwyn, it causes a large drain of stamina if it connects while blocking.\nSlash and Thrust.\nOccasionally Gwyn will interrupt his normal slash combo with a quick thrust afterwards. If it hits, the player will be stunned, leaving them open for further combos.\nSlashing Upper Combo.\nStarts with a powerful horizontal slash, which takes a large portion of stamina, followed by two more hits. The first two slashes can be difficult to evade.\nCharging Slash.\nA powerful slash used by Gwyn to break the player's guard.\nInstant Dash/Double Slash.\nA very fast attack, which comes out of Gwyn's instant dash when he glides towards the player before slashing twice.\nExplosive Hand.\nAn unblockable &lt;a href=\"grab\"&gt;grab&lt;/a&gt; attack that deals massive fire damage. It has a high horizontal hitbox, so it is possible to roll under it to avoid it. It's relatively slow and does not track well so player can simply walk backwards to avoid it. After knocking the player away, Gwyn will follow up with a jumping slash or dashing slash. It also leaves Gwyn open to attacks for a short time.\nDrops.\nGwyn's armor, the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lord%20Set\"&gt;Great Lord Set&lt;/a&gt;, can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Domhnall%20of%20Zena\"&gt;Domhnall of Zena&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"New%20Game%20Plus\"&gt;next playthrough&lt;/a&gt;.\n3D Model.\nThis integration requires JavaScript.

A light shines brightly behind Gwynevere's figure. She is dressed in white cloth and rests on a cushion underneath her arm.\nLocation.\nGwynevere is located in &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;, in a room above the hall where &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Slayer%20Ornstein%20and%20Executioner%20Smough\"&gt;Ornstein and Smough&lt;/a&gt; battle the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt;, behind the door with the &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt; in front of it.\nPlot.\nUpon meeting with Gwynevere for the first time, she grants the player the &lt;a href=\"Lordvessel\"&gt;Lordvessel&lt;/a&gt;, which enables the ability to warp between most bonfires. Gwynevere can also initiate players into the &lt;a href=\"Princess%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Princess's Guard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;.\nKilling Gwynevere, which requires a single hit with any attack, will reveal that she is an illusion created by &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt;. Gwyndolin then removes the rest of his enchantment, causing the sun to permanently set in &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, any player that darkens Anor Londo will become more susceptible to &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Darkmoon\"&gt;Blade of the Darkmoon&lt;/a&gt; invasions when\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Humanity%20Mechanic\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0All deaths within Anor Londo will return the player to a specific bonfire in that stage, regardless of the last bonfire used. In addition, all regular enemies will vanish, except &lt;a href=\"Painting%20Guardian\"&gt;Painting Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, a few &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Knight\"&gt;Silver Knight&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo%23Enemies\"&gt;two new hostile characters&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;.\nGwynevere is the first daughter of &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; and one of the deities who resided in &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Age of Fire&lt;/a&gt;. She was worshiped by the humans as the \"&lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;goddess of sunlight&lt;/a&gt;\" and a symbol of \"fertility and blessings\", while she was also cherished by all the other gods. As a goddess of sunlight, her miracles of &lt;a href=\"Bountiful%20Sunlight\"&gt;Bountiful Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Soothing%20Sunlight\"&gt;Soothing Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; were able to convey the sun's rays to heal and she granted her blessing to many warriors. She also taught her miracles to her &lt;a href=\"Pisaca\"&gt;maidens&lt;/a&gt; and created &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Blessing\"&gt;holy water&lt;/a&gt; with healing properties thanks to her light. Gwynevere was venerated in a cathedral alongside the main one in Anor Londo and the structure was also used to contain the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariamis\"&gt;Painted World of Ariamis&lt;/a&gt;, protected by the &lt;a href=\"Painting%20Guardian\"&gt;Painting Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAfter her father Gwyn linked the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, his throne passed to his &lt;a href=\"The%20Nameless%20King\"&gt;firstborn son&lt;/a&gt; who, however, chose to \"ally\" with the dragons, the ancient enemies of the gods, and was therefore dethroned, exiled and his name eradicated from history, she abandoned Anor Londo together with nearly all of the other deities and moved to an unknown location At some point she married &lt;a href=\"Flame%20God%20Flann\"&gt;Flame God Flann&lt;/a&gt; and became the mother of several children of noble lineage.\nAfter her escape the only deity left to protect Anor Londo was her younger brother &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Dark Sun Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt;. However, he was more than aware of his fragile, repulsive appearance and was therefore psychologically unfit to become the next ruler, still playing the feminine role imposed on him by his father Gwyn. For this reason, Gwyndolin created an illusion of Gwynevere to help him maintain some semblance of divinity and control over the ancient capital. Over time this illusion of the goddess would become a key component in the system that sough a worthy champion to link the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; again and took on the role of guiding and manipulating potential Chosen Undead, as &lt;a href=\"Kingseeker%20Frampt\"&gt;Kingseeker Frampt&lt;/a&gt; would invite them to reach Anor Londo and visit her. The false goddess would welcome the Undead after they defeated &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Slayer%20Ornstein%20and%20Executioner%20Smough\"&gt;Dragon Slayer Ornstein and Executioner Smough&lt;/a&gt;, the cathedral guards, and proved that they was strong enough to fulfill their destiny. Gwynevere's illusion would reward them with her divine presence and the &lt;a href=\"Lordvessel\"&gt;Lordvessel&lt;/a&gt; needed to reach the &lt;a href=\"Kiln%20of%20the%20First%20Flame\"&gt;Kiln of the First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, inducing them with her words to succeed Gwyn and link the fading Flame. The illusion of the goddess would even be used to accept Undead into its covenant of the &lt;a href=\"Princess%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Princess's Guard&lt;/a&gt;, in order to constitute a line of defense against the deception of which they were unaware in exchange for the possibility of using the miracles of the goddess.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point Gwynevere and her followers reached &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; and began creating &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Blessing%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;holy water&lt;/a&gt; blessed with her light and healing powers again, artifacts that remain in the region even centuries after the collapse of &lt;a href=\"Vendrick\"&gt;Vendrick&lt;/a&gt;'s kingdom.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Lindelt\"&gt;Lindelt&lt;/a&gt;, a \"sacred land\" known for its clerics and miracles, her miracles of &lt;a href=\"Bountiful%20Sunlight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Bountiful Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Soothing%20Sunlight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Soothing Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; were preserved by the Lindelt Monastery, after they were passed down through the ages and became their property. In addition, the ruling house of Osteria is in possession of a ring depicting the sun and with the same healing powers as the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Sun%20Princess\"&gt;rings of Gwynevere&lt;/a&gt;, and it is said that as long as House Osteria remains in possession of the ring the peace and security of its people would be assured. Despite this, the goddess seems to have abandoned the region since time immemorial, as her name has been forgotten and the Magic Academy of &lt;a href=\"Melfia\"&gt;Melfia&lt;/a&gt; even goes so far as to deny that she ever existed.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point in time, after her younger brother &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Dark Sun Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt; assumed the title of \"Main God\" and built &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt; on the ruins of Anor Londo to gather the descendants of the gods, she returned to her ancient home. Here the goddess was venerated with multiple statues displayed throughout the city and became the mother of several children with royal blood such as &lt;a href=\"Rosaria%2C%20Mother%20of%20Rebirth\"&gt;Rosaria, Mother of Rebirth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dancer%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Dancer of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt;. The goddess would return to her location in the &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;old cathedral of Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;, protected by the remaining &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Knight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Silver Knights&lt;/a&gt; who had once protected her illusion and whose &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Knight%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; she would once again bless. Eventually she also left Irithyll, leaving her &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Princess%20Ring\"&gt;Sun Princess Ring&lt;/a&gt; behind.\nAt some point, Gwynevere reached &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt; and became the queen of the kingdom, marrying into the bloodline of its monarchs. The goddess resumed her role as a divinity, producing &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Blessing%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;holy water&lt;/a&gt; with healing properties and being worshiped by humans as a symbol of \"fertility and blessing\". Her \"angelic daughter\" &lt;a href=\"Gertrude\"&gt;Gertrude&lt;/a&gt; also became her holy maiden and her healing &lt;a href=\"Bountiful%20Light\"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt; were taught to her personal knights. During the long tradition of supporting the linking of the Flame by the kingdom of Lothric, the goddess alone cared for the &lt;a href=\"Cemetery%20of%20Ash\"&gt;Cemetery of Ash&lt;/a&gt;, the resting place for the &lt;a href=\"Unkindled\"&gt;Unkindled&lt;/a&gt;, beings who had failed to link the flame and whose graves saw no visitors.\nShe eventually became the wife of &lt;a href=\"Oceiros%2C%20the%20Consumed%20King\"&gt;King Oceiros&lt;/a&gt;, the last monarch of Lothric, and supported the kingdom's desire to produce an heir worthy of linking the First Flame, giving birth first to &lt;a href=\"Lorian%2C%20Elder%20Prince%20and%20Lothric%2C%20Younger%20Prince\"&gt;Elder Prince Lorian&lt;/a&gt;, raised to become a knight and then &lt;a href=\"Lothric%2C%20Younger%20Prince\"&gt;Lothric, Younger Prince&lt;/a&gt;, expected to become a \"champion\" and sacrifice himself to the Flame. However, when Prince Lothric and his brother refused to link the fading Flame and they chose to wait out the end of the Age of Fire, King Oceiros went mad in his attempt to produce an heir worthy of their sacrificial destiny. The king found the heretical faith of the paledrake &lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;Seath&lt;/a&gt; among the scholars of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt; and became convinced that a crossbreed heir would have the strength to link the Flame. Oceiros eventually became a deformed humanoid dragon and with him the queen had her youngest child, &lt;a href=\"Ocelotte\"&gt;Ocelotte&lt;/a&gt;. After producing the potential champion, Gwynevere quietly disappeared from the kingdom of Lothric. Realizing that the Flame would soon go out and it would be necessary to bring back even the Unkindled to search for a new champion, the queen enshrined her &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Estus%20Ring\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Untended%20Graves\"&gt;Cemetery of Untended Graves&lt;/a&gt;, so that one day an Unkindled might profit from its use.\nIn the final days of Lothric, the citizens of the kingdom even forgot the miracles of the goddess of sunlight, and ended up creating childish but earnest &lt;a href=\"Projected%20Heal\"&gt;stories&lt;/a&gt; to try to recall her blessings and the back of her figure, as the last image of their queen before she left.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls \u2014 Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFrgZSRtuEY&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

It is also quite short. \nThe light attacks are unique compared to other axes, as the one-handed ones are slightly quicker horizontal slashes instead of side-to-side smashes while the two-handed ones unexpectedly have a slight, peculiar upward tilt.

These thrusting attacks with the heavy bladed head also have uncommon hitstun properties, sometimes allowing the wielder to consecutively hit a target more than twice. However, unlike most other weapons in its class, these thrusting attacks cannot benefit from &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that the wielder must be patient and wield the weapon more akin to a &lt;a href=\"Spears%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt;, keeping foes at the weapon's maximum reach whenever possible.\nCompared to the only other thrusting halberd in the game, the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Hilted%20Halberd\"&gt;Red Hilted Halberd&lt;/a&gt;, the normal Halberd possesses different &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt; values as well as a different &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;. Whereas the Red Hilted Halberd can perform &lt;a href=\"Perseverance%20%28skill%29\"&gt;Perseverance&lt;/a&gt; and engage foes head-on, the normal Halberd possesses a &lt;a href=\"Charge\"&gt;Charge&lt;/a&gt; attack that can be useful for &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; trades or for running down fleeing targets. In terms of damage, the Red Hilted Halberd is stronger when it comes to &lt;a href=\"Infusion%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;infusions&lt;/a&gt; that enhance physical attributes, particularly the &lt;a href=\"Sharp%20Gem\"&gt;Sharp&lt;/a&gt; infusion.

However, this is not a duel, and the player summoned to be the boss will have increased defenses and the magic orbs will automatically appear around them through intervals of time. Similar to Halflight, the player will gain higher defense values and the magic orbs will appear more frequently the more summons the host has.

They share similar attack animations with &lt;a href=\"Axes\"&gt;Axes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Greataxes\"&gt;Greataxes&lt;/a&gt;, and their general usage is similar too. While hammers have \"slightly\" inferior attack rating compared to their axe counterpart, the damage type they deal means they tend to deal higher damage to armored opponents.\nThese weapons are designed for single hit damage rather than a quick succession of hits. This means their attacks are often quite labored and slow. On the other hand, hammers &lt;a href=\"stagger\"&gt;stagger&lt;/a&gt; opponents with relative ease. The sheer force of the blows also makes them very effective against highly defensive opponents, because it will not take long to break their guard.\nSuccessfully striking an opponent greatly reduces the ending lag of the blow, allowing the player to swing again relatively fast. Missing with a hammer will leave the player wide open though. The first strike is the most delicate, however, if it does connect, given the force of the blow and staggering power, it is almost always possible to follow it up with extra strikes, and potentially a &lt;a href=\"stun-lock\"&gt;stun-lock&lt;/a&gt;. Against turtling opponents, it is also possible to pound away at the &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; with relative ease.\nHammers.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nDetailed=\nCondensed=\nUpgraded=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

They move slowly but their sword blows have a long reach and they will often perform a back-swing if the player remains behind them too long. Their most dangerous move is a series of sword slams followed by a leaping dive attack that will often kill the player if they are unable to escape the combo. This move does leave them vulnerable for a few seconds, provided the player evades the initial slam attacks.\nHarald Knights are extremely vulnerable to &lt;a href=\"Plunging%20Attack%23Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;plunging attacks&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, using plunging attacks on the Harald Legion Knights constitutes a critical in of itself, as such, weapons with split damage can outright kill them with a plunging attack.\nAny projectile that hits the head of these knights will stagger them and deal about double the damage. As such, a ranged engagement of these enemies with bows should not be overlooked."}

Its weakness to &lt;a href=\"Strike%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Strike&lt;/a&gt; damage is not far out of line with the rest of its defenses, and the same applies to its resistance to &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage.

It is generally resistant to all forms of &lt;a href=\"physical\"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; damage, save for being slightly more effective against &lt;a href=\"Strike%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Strike&lt;/a&gt; damage. Its elemental resistances are somewhat lower, being particularly weak to &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage despite not being a plate armor set.\nIt is especially effective against all forms of status effects, particularly against &lt;a href=\"Frost\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; buildup, and also provides an appreciable amount of &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt; resistance. It also only provides a token amount of &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;, making it sub-optimal for wielding hyper-armor weapons.\nThis makes it a well-rounded set overall that will work in most situations."}

It also has heavy deflection. However, the &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; has a 50 &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; requirement, and is very heavy. Only those with the highest Strength and &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt; will be able to wield this shield effectively.\nUsing the heavy attack on the shield will grant the user a temporary defensive buff similar to &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Flesh\"&gt;Iron Flesh&lt;/a&gt; (but with no movement penalty or added defenses other than deflection). Using this attack drains the shield by 300 &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;, however, so it can only be cast once before needing repairs (the shield has a total of 500 durability). The effect lasts for 40 seconds.\nWhile it does not have as much &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Greatshield%20of%20Artorias\"&gt;Greatshield of Artorias&lt;/a&gt;, it makes up for this with its spectacular &lt;a href=\"elemental%20defense\"&gt;elemental defense&lt;/a&gt;s (including the highest &lt;a href=\"magic%20defense\"&gt;magic defense&lt;/a&gt; of any shield, tied with the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Ring%20Shield\"&gt;Crystal Ring Shield&lt;/a&gt;). This makes it useful against strong enemies with mixed elemental attacks (such the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20Guardian\"&gt;Sanctuary Guardian&lt;/a&gt;), or against mages (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Bloathead%20Sorcerer\"&gt;Bloathead Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;).\nResistance defense.\nAlong with &lt;a href=\"Physical\"&gt;Physical&lt;/a&gt; and Elemental damage reduction, weapons also have hidden stats that reduce the amount of status &lt;a href=\"build-up\"&gt;build-up&lt;/a&gt; while blocking.\nUpgrades.\n&lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Modification\"&gt;Upgrading&lt;/a&gt; this shield will only improve its damage characteristics."}

For this reason, this is one of the most broadly-used heavy armor sets in the game, and players typically don a piece of this set, as every piece of the set has great defenses, even when matched with lighter, less-resistant armor.\nOne thing to keep in mind with such heavy armor is that unless players possess extremely high &lt;a href=\"Vitality%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt; builds, wearing the full set will most definitely cause them to \"fat &lt;a href=\"roll\"&gt;roll&lt;/a&gt;\" due to surpassing the 70% &lt;a href=\"equip%20load\"&gt;equip load&lt;/a&gt; capacity. As such, it is encouraged that the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Soldier%27s%20Ring\"&gt;Royal Soldier's Ring&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Dragon%20Ring\"&gt;Third Dragon Ring&lt;/a&gt; are used simultaneously. The player may also choose to ignore rolling entirely but beware the risks it might bring, as some attacks of certain &lt;a href=\"Boss%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Enemies%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; are often unblockable, not to mention that the fact that in &lt;a href=\"PvP%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, rolling becomes an essential to most successful players."}

Being lighter only than &lt;a href=\"Smough%27s%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Smough's Set&lt;/a&gt;, the player will need to make a heavy investment in &lt;a href=\"Vitality%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt; in order to be able to even move around, but the investment can be more than worth it if the set is used right.\nThe set provides extreme resistance to physical damage, with even its \"weakness\" to &lt;a href=\"Strike%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Strike&lt;/a&gt; damage being higher than the regular physical defenses of most other sets in the game. Its elemental defenses are lower but still sound across the board, being especially resistant to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage to resist the breath of the dragons. Its resistance to &lt;a href=\"Negative%20Status%20Effects%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;status effects&lt;/a&gt; is also very well-rounded, even sporting resistance against &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt; buildup.\nUnsurprisingly, Havel's Set boasts extreme amounts of &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the wielder to trade against virtually any attacks in the game while still poising through."}

Havel was the comrade-in-arms of &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord Gwyn&lt;/a&gt; and fought alongside him during the War against the &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;Ancient Dragons&lt;/a&gt;.. To testify to the immense strength of the warrior, Havel went so far as to use as a weapon an &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Tooth\"&gt;enormous hammer&lt;/a&gt; created from the tooth of a slain dragon, which, as the body of primordial dragons was made of hard rock, would never break and granted its wielder the power to resist both the flame and magic that came from the dragons' jaws. Similarly, his &lt;a href=\"Havel%27s%20Greatshield\"&gt;greatshield&lt;/a&gt; and incredibly &lt;a href=\"Havel%27s%20Set\"&gt;heavy armor&lt;/a&gt; were sculpted from a mass of rock, as this was what made up the body of dragons, giving their owner tremendous weight and defense power. The greathammer created from a dragon's tooth and the shield infused with its magical power became legendary objects and holy relics of Havel himself and he became known with the title of \"Rock-like\". \nJust like the other &lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;gods of Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gwynevere%2C%20Princess%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Gwynevere&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Allfather%20Lloyd\"&gt;Lloyd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velka%2C%20Goddess%20of%20Sin\"&gt;Velka&lt;/a&gt;, Havel had a religious order and priests around him. Because he had an intense hatred for &lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;Seath the Scaleless&lt;/a&gt;, grandfather of &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;sorcery&lt;/a&gt; and his sworn enemy, Havel hated sorcery too and developed the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Magic%20Barrier\"&gt;Great Magic Barrier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;miracle&lt;/a&gt; to fight and counter sorcerers, conveying it to his priest and allowing them to create a strong magical protective membrane that would greatly reduce magical damage. A simplified version of this miracle in the form of &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Barrier\"&gt;Magic Barrier&lt;/a&gt;, which required less faith from the user but also granted less defense against magic, was generalized for the convenience of the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20White\"&gt;Way of White&lt;/a&gt;, giving simple cleric warriors a good defense against magic, as the all the priests of Havel should have and remained in use during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Allfather%20Lloyd\"&gt;Allfather Lloyd&lt;/a&gt;.\nHavel's incredible strength inspired large numbers of men to follow him. The warriors that adhered to him emulated their idol by wearing equally heavy armor carved from rock and &lt;a href=\"Havel%27s%20Ring\"&gt;magic rings&lt;/a&gt; that allowed them to carry heavier weight with pleasure and for this reason took the name of the hero who inspired their wielders. Thanks to their legendary strength, Havel's knight became known for the fact that they never flinched and never retreated but always crushed those that opposed them..\nAfter Gwyn linked the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Nameless%20King\"&gt;Gwyn's firstborn son&lt;/a&gt; was dethroned and exiled and nearly all of the other deities abandoned Anor Londo, Havel's fate remained unknown. A suit of the armor worn by Havel's knights, along with the greathammer and greatshield that were considered his holy relics, was preserved in the main cathedral of Anor Londo, hidden along with a club infused with the power of the &lt;a href=\"Occult%20%28auxiliary%20effect%29\"&gt;occult&lt;/a&gt; to be more capable of slaying the gods. One of his knights that was still in &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt; turned into a Hollow and was locked away by a dear friend inside a stone cell in the basement of the watchtower of the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Burg\"&gt;Undead Burg&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;.\nTBA\nStrategy.\nHavel proves to be a very dangerous and very powerful enemy, capable of easily killing lower vitality players, low armored players and drain large levels stamina in a single attack: his overhead strike can both break through guards and inflict &lt;a href=\"critical\"&gt;critical&lt;/a&gt; damage, and he takes very low damage from most starting weapons and tools (aside from &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;pyromancies&lt;/a&gt; and weapons buffed with\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Gold%20Pine%20Resin\"&gt;Gold Pine Resin&lt;/a&gt;). However, his rather predictable and slow attack patterns mean that he is particularly susceptible to &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"parry\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt;ing. Chain-parrying is arguably the fastest way to kill him, but is the riskiest, as it requires the player to directly confront the attacks and any minor error will likely mean instant death.\nShould the player choose to fight in melee combat, it is highly recommended to move to the level above, so should the player die, they can safely access their bloodstain before trying again.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Drake%20Sword\"&gt;Drake Sword&lt;/a&gt; can prove to be invaluable to low-leveled players, as it can be obtained nearby and is likely the only weapon that can deal bearable damage in this fight at such an early point in the game, especially with critical hits.\nHe is unusually evasive for such a defensive NPC, favoring &lt;a href=\"rolling\"&gt;rolling&lt;/a&gt; when players use magic or ranged attacks - combined with surprisingly good timing, damage could be difficult to deal. A rapid series of rolls will however drain a majority of his stamina, so one or two kicks from the player can easily be a guard break if he blocks with the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Tooth\"&gt;Dragon Tooth&lt;/a&gt;. On top of this, the overhead attacks will be almost guaranteed to miss if the player stands directly across from him and constantly strafes to either side, leading to an easy backstab.

The fight, however, will not be as difficult as it was in &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt;, since the player will most likely be at a high level and wielding advanced weaponry at that point in the game. In addition, the combat area will be much more spacious, allowing for better evading maneuvers.\nNew to his repertoire of attacks is the ability to cast &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Flesh\"&gt;Stone Flesh&lt;/a&gt; on himself and cover his body with a rock layer, which will render him extremely resilient to attacks, but also reduce his mobility.\nLocations.\nHavel has a small chance of being summoned by the two &lt;a href=\"Man%20Serpent%20Summoner\"&gt;Man Serpent Summoner&lt;/a&gt;s that inhabit &lt;a href=\"Archdragon%20Peak\"&gt;Archdragon Peak&lt;/a&gt;, one of which is found in the &lt;a href=\"Dragon-Kin%20Mausoleum\"&gt;Dragon-Kin Mausoleum&lt;/a&gt;, and the other just before reaching the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Belfry\"&gt;Great Belfry&lt;/a&gt;.\nHavel's fixed location lies at the top of the building on the right after coming from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Belfry\"&gt;Great Belfry&lt;/a&gt;, standing in front of a dead &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt; and guarding a &lt;a href=\"Titanite%20Slab%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Titanite Slab&lt;/a&gt;; it does not matter if he was previously defeated as a summon in any of the other two areas. As with other enemies of this kind, he will not respawn once he has been defeated in this location.\nStrategy.\nHavel will drop both the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Tooth%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dragon Tooth&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Havel%27s%20Greatshield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;greatshield&lt;/a&gt; the first time he is defeated. If the player is not in a hurry to acquire these items, then in the case he is summoned by any of the &lt;a href=\"Man%20Serpent%20Summoner\"&gt;Man Serpent Summoner&lt;/a&gt;s it is recommended to avoid fighting him, as the combat area will be not as spacious and the summoner may meddle in the fight.\nWhen encountered at his fixed location at the top of the building, he will be facing in the opposite direction from the player, which will give the opportunity to start the battle by &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;backstabbing&lt;/a&gt; him (casting &lt;a href=\"Spook\"&gt;Spook&lt;/a&gt; or equipping the &lt;a href=\"Slumbering%20Dragoncrest%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Slumbering Dragoncrest Ring&lt;/a&gt; will ensure he does not turn hostile prematurely).\nHis attacks are slow but very powerful and can take out very large amounts of &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;, so they should not be blocked. He can smash his weapon up to three times in a row or slowly build up for a very powerful swing.\nOnce his life bar has been depleted to about a half, he will retreat and attempt to cast &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Flesh\"&gt;Stone Flesh&lt;/a&gt;, which will wrap his body in a layer of rock and make him extremely resilient to damage, although his mobility will also be severely compromised. He should not be attacked at this moment, as all damage dealt will be minimal and the player risks getting hit for full damage. Instead, move around him for a while until the spell wears off (about 30 seconds).\nWhile casting Stone Flesh, Havel will leave himself open for a backstab, allowing the player to inflict heavy damage and cancel the casting at the same time. After recovering, he will attempt to cast the spell once more and the player can backstab him each time until he is defeated.\nAfter a successful cast of Stone Flesh, Havel will switch to two-handed and become impossible to parry. One strategy is to use a parry shield and never leave close quarters range from him. After a successful parry and critical attack, do not back up. Havel will stand and attempt another one-handed swing which can be parried again. He will not attempt to cast Stone Flesh or switch to two-handed if the player is always immediately next to him, allowing them to parry every blow and kill him easily.\nOr, as is the case for most (if not all) non-huge enemies in the game, just use the &lt;a href=\"Club%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;club&lt;/a&gt;, and easily &lt;a href=\"stunlock\"&gt;stunlock&lt;/a&gt; him to death, trivializing the fight.\nNote that Havel is weak to poison, which means he is quite vulnerable to the &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Spores\"&gt;Poison Spores&lt;/a&gt; weapon art of the &lt;a href=\"Storyteller%27s%20Staff\"&gt;Storyteller's Staff&lt;/a&gt;. He also prefers to stand at the ledge by the wyvern, so he can also be defeated with archery pot-shots and then climbing down the ladder (very likely he won't follow), then climbing back up after a few seconds, whereupon he'll be back at the ledge again or walking towards it.\n&lt;a href=\"Hawkwood%20the%20Deserter\"&gt;Hawkwood&lt;/a&gt; can be summoned to aid in this fight, making it somewhat easier. Note that he is only summonable before obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Twinkling%20Dragon%20Torso%20Stone\"&gt;Twinkling Dragon Torso Stone&lt;/a&gt; or ringing the bell."}

There he acts as a to the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt;, offering a variety of wares, including unique items that he personally crafted.\nGough eventually offers to assist the player in killing &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragon%20Kalameet\"&gt;Black Dragon Kalameet&lt;/a&gt;, but only after the player first encounters the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;. Should the player answer \"Yes\" to both of his questions, Gough will shoot down the \"old bat\", forcing the dragon to engage the player on the ground. It is not necessary for Gough to shoot Kalameet in order to kill the dragon, but it makes the fight significantly easier. Gough gifts his bow to the player upon Kalameet's defeat after several prompts.\nLore.\nHawkeye Gough is one of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Knights%20of%20Gwyn\"&gt;Four Knights of Gwyn&lt;/a&gt; and the owner of the &lt;a href=\"Hawk%20Ring\"&gt;Hawk Ring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hawkeye%20Gough%27s%20Set\"&gt;Hawkeye Gough's Set&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gough%27s%20Greatbow\"&gt;Gough's Greatbow&lt;/a&gt;. It is said that he could knock a flying &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; out of the sky with his mighty bow.\nGough was the leader of the Dragonslayers. He wielded the mightiest of greatbows as he was the only one who had the strength to handle such power. Gough fought bravely in the war against the &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; at the dawn of the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Age of Fire&lt;/a&gt; and was given numerous honors by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Gwyn\"&gt;Lord Gwyn&lt;/a&gt;.\nGough was not without his enemies, however. His sight was impaired by those who dismissed Gough as a brutish giant, packing the eye holes of his helm with tree resin; although this did not impair his ability to shoot with deadly precision.\nAt some point while in &lt;a href=\"Oolacile\"&gt;Oolacile&lt;/a&gt; Gough was imprisoned within a tower. There he created innumerable &lt;a href=\"carvings\"&gt;carvings&lt;/a&gt;, through which he achieved personal enlightenment.\nGough hinted at his relationship with the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Blacksmith\"&gt;Giant Blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nGough has very high &lt;a href=\"hitpoints\"&gt;hitpoints&lt;/a&gt; and can dish out a lot of damage. The confined area in which he resides can make it difficult to avoid his blows.\nDue to Gough's blindness, wearing the &lt;a href=\"Slumbering%20Dragoncrest%20Ring\"&gt;Slumbering Dragoncrest Ring&lt;/a&gt; will cause him to stop and listen for the player's whereabouts.\nHe is susceptible to &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;blood loss&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, they are also extremely costly in weight, meaning that the wearer must invest heavily in &lt;a href=\"Vitality%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt; if they intend to use heavy armor.\nBecause of the high absorption values and the great amount of Poise provided, heavy armor is ideal protection for players who intend to equip ultra weapons and perform &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt; trades with opponents. Ultra weapons tend to weigh a lot and cost tremendous amounts of &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; to swing, so equipment such as &lt;a href=\"Havel%27s%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Havel's Ring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chloranthy%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Chloranthy Ring&lt;/a&gt; tend to go hand-in-hand with such builds.\nBecause virtually all heavy sets are plate metal-based, most sets in this category tend to be weak to &lt;a href=\"Strike%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Strike&lt;/a&gt; damage and &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; attacks, though exceptions do exist. Their plate metal nature, however, also tends to make them highly resistant to &lt;a href=\"Slash%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Slash&lt;/a&gt; damage and &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"buildup\"&gt;buildup&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, it is a very useful addition to one's arsenal, especially as an invader, due to its well-balanced attributes.\nIt is 25% lighter than the &lt;a href=\"Arbalest\"&gt;Arbalest&lt;/a&gt;, and only marginally heavier than the &lt;a href=\"Knight%27s%20Crossbow\"&gt;Knight's Crossbow&lt;/a&gt;, while dealing a respectable amount of pure physical damage. As well, it has better range than the Knight's Crossbow, allowing it to maintain its damage output against enemies that are farther away. Its lack of split damage allows it to take advantage of specialized ammunition more easily, rather than relying on maximizing &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage output by using &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning Bolts&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it a more flexible weapon. The only drawback is that it requires more &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; to wield than the Knight's Crossbow.\nIts combination of light weight and respectable damage makes the Heavy Crossbow a favorite for players that do not wish to invest in the &lt;a href=\"Vitality%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Vitality&lt;/a&gt; to wield an off-hand &lt;a href=\"Avelyn%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Avelyn&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpgrades.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

The area is populated exclusively by &lt;a href=\"Old%20Knight\"&gt;Old Knight&lt;/a&gt;s.\u00a0\nThere are three levers in this area, each revealed after defeating the nearby Old Knights: two can make the Dragonrider boss fight much easier by expanding the size of his arena, and the third lowers the drawbridge to the Cathedral of Blue and the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Dragonslayer\"&gt;Old Dragonslayer&lt;/a&gt; boss. The Old Knights will actively pursue fleeing players up to the Cathedral entrance.\u00a0\nNo-Man's Wharf can be reached through a series of tunnels underneath the tower after defeating the Dragonrider.\nLore.\nHeide is one of the oldest civilizations in the &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; region and was founded by remnants of the late inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; from whom they inherited various influences and knowledge.\nIn fact, Heide's &lt;a href=\"Old%20Knight\"&gt;Knights&lt;/a&gt;, who are so old that their armor is at the point of nearly-crumbing, still possess the &lt;a href=\"Cracked%20Blue%20Eye%20Orb\"&gt;Cracked Blue Eye Orb&lt;/a&gt;s. These are the worn remains of the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Eye%20Orb\"&gt;Blue Eye Orb&lt;/a&gt;s that were granted to the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Blade\"&gt;Blades of the Darkmoon&lt;/a&gt;, who served &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Dark Sun Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt; to mete out the vengeance of the gods in the times of Anor Londo. The original founders of Heide were once servants of Gwyndolin, being part of his covenant.\nIn addition, the inhabitants of Heide inherited the culture of Anor Londo, building their city in an architectural style similar to that of the ancient city of the gods, integrating an immense \"Tower of Flame\" celebrating the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; and adorning their structures with dozens of statues representing &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn&lt;/a&gt;, albeit in a distorted form and with his head replaced with the head of an eagle but still resembing the pose and characteristics of Gwyn's original representations with the sun medallion, sword and robes of the God of Sunlight\nTo add, a &lt;a href=\"Watchdragon%20Parma\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; representing two intertwined \"&lt;a href=\"Primordial%20Serpents\"&gt;serpentine dragons&lt;/a&gt;\" can be found in Heide, regarding the two creatures as \"watchers of the flow of time\" and depicting them as in contrast, one painted white and one black. This implies that, within Heide, the Primordial Serpents and the conflicting ideologies of Kaathe and Frampt were at least partly known.\nIn Heide would also have originated the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20Blue\"&gt;Way of Blue&lt;/a&gt;, which was not a developed religion but a humble prayer that spread naturally among those seeking help, but which eventually grew to the point that a huge &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Blue\"&gt;Cathedral of Blue&lt;/a&gt; was built in the heart of the city. To fill the same role played by the Blades of the Darkmoon, the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Sentinels\"&gt;Blue Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; would be formed, a group that descended directly from the original Blades of the Darkmoon.They were tasked with defending the apostles of Blue from evil spirits by traveling between space and time thanks to the &lt;a href=\"Cracked%20Blue%20Eye%20Orb\"&gt;Cracked Blue Eye Orb&lt;/a&gt;s. The victorious knights would be rewarded with miracles from the ancient gods of Anor Londo like &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Gods%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Wrath of the Gods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bountiful%20Sunlight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Bountiful Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; that had been lost or jealously guarded elsewhere in Drangleic, again implying that Heide's founders had inherited a strong relationship with the knowledge of the city of the gods. Another element that proves the connection between Heide and Anor Londo is the fact that the Cathedral of Blue is defended by an &lt;a href=\"Old%20Dragonslayer\"&gt;Old Dragonslayer&lt;/a&gt;, whose appearance and artifacts are identical to that of the knights who served &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Slayer%20Ornstein\"&gt;Dragon Slayer Ornstein&lt;/a&gt;, thus implying that some of them or knowledge of their heritage had come to the city of Drangleic.\nThe Heide civilization was also highly advanced not only in architectural capabilities but also in metallurgy, producing a special alloy that made their &lt;a href=\"Heide%20Knight%20Sword\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; very durable and whose composition still remains a mystery to Drangleic craftsmen to the point that their attempts to imitate it resulted only in a similar bradded steel.\nHowever, at a certain point, Heide was struck by a cataclysm due to the rise in sea levels the city faced and most of it ended up subsumed by the water, forcing the inhabitants to abandon it. Consequently all records dating back to its history were lost and the inhabitants of Drangleic were even unable to understand whether the name \"Heide\" referred to a land or kingdom and could only understand tell the fact that the Way of Blue had originated in the lost city.\nAlthough the city remains a pile of unsafe submerged rubble, the upper part of the city and the Tower of Flame continue to exist and host the headquarters of the Blue Sentinels with &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Sentinel%20Targray\"&gt;Targray&lt;/a&gt;at its command. The organization would continue to exist to protect the members of the Way of Blue, testing the adventurers who arrived in Heide and were confronted by the remaining &lt;a href=\"Heide%20Knight\"&gt;Heide Knight&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Old%20Knight\"&gt;Old Knight&lt;/a&gt;s.\nArtifacts originating from Lordran and connected to the ancient deities can still be found among the rubble, yet more proof of Heide's origins, like &lt;a href=\"Lloyd%27s%20Talisman%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Lloyd's Talismans&lt;/a&gt;. and &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Blessing%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Divine Blessings&lt;/a&gt;."}

Its running attack is very effective when executed correctly; however, this attack consumes a large amount of &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;. This weapon may be hard to use in &lt;a href=\"PvP%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, as it's fairly easy to dodge the relatively narrow hitbox of its attacks. However, it can deal outstanding damage, should the attacks connect.\nPlayers with high &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt; should consider a &lt;a href=\"Boltstone\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Infusion\"&gt;Infusion&lt;/a&gt; for the Heide Greatlance as it will maintain its &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scaling%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt; while increasing the C scaling in &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; to a B at high reinforcement. Infusion will also cause a minimal reduction in &lt;a href=\"physical%20damage\"&gt;physical damage&lt;/a&gt;, but this penalty is much smaller than most other weapons, and is well worth the large damage boost from Faith."}

This makes the set hard to obtain, but the knights will always drop a random piece of their armor, or the weapon the defeated Knight is wielding, with the exception of the Heide Knight near the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Winter\"&gt;Shrine of Winter&lt;/a&gt;, who uses a sword, but drops the &lt;a href=\"Heide%20Lance\"&gt;Heide Lance&lt;/a&gt; at intensity 1 and the &lt;a href=\"Heide%20Greatlance\"&gt;Heide Greatlance&lt;/a&gt; at intensity 2.\nIn \"\", there are respawning Heide Knights at &lt;a href=\"Heide%27s%20Tower%20of%20Flame\"&gt;Heide's Tower of Flame&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it much easier to obtain the set.

It is capable of horizontal as well as vertical slashes, and a thrusting attack on the second strong attack when one-handed. It also possesses higher than usual durability, making it a rather reliable weapon to use on longer journeys.\nIts main characteristic, however, is that it deals &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage, making it a fairly useful weapon for &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt; builds. Combined with its early availability (it can be found in one of the two immediately accessible areas at the start of the game) as well as its low physical stat requirements, and it becomes a very strong candidate for &lt;a href=\"Infusion\"&gt;infusing&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Boltstone\"&gt;Boltstone&lt;/a&gt;, and even for &lt;a href=\"Power%20Stance\"&gt;Power Stancing&lt;/a&gt; (requiring as little as 16 &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and 15 &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;).

Rather, the best course of action is to avoid engaging it until returning much later with better stats and upgraded weapons.\nIn order to progress into the Undead Parish, the player has two options:\nUpon initial encounter, it is worth attempting to attack the Hellkite Drake's tail, as cutting off its tail will grant the player the &lt;a href=\"Drake%20Sword\"&gt;Drake Sword&lt;/a&gt;, which is a weapon without any kind of scaling. The most reliable way to do this is to equip a bow and shoot at its tail with arrows. Dealing enough damage to the tail will cause it to fall off and grant the player the sword.\nShould the player return to this area later in the game, there are a few ways to permanently dispatch the Hellkite Drake:\nThe Drake regenerates health after it has about 33% HP left, should it still be on its perch; this makes approaches that only use bows and arrows ineffective. In order to kill the Drake, the player must lure it onto the bridge and then engage it with melee attacks. By standing on the bridge and using the nearby walls as cover from its flame breath attacks, it can be goaded into leaving its perch and landing on the bridge. \nEnemy information.\nAttacks.\nCrossing the Burg.\nAs the Hellkite Drake flies towards its perch above the Undead Parish entrance, it breathes fire upon the bridge. This can only be avoided by descending the stairs in the middle of the bridge.\nFire Breath.\nThe Hellkite Drake exhales a plume of flame which covers the entire bridge. It can only be avoided by hiding against the walls in the middle of the bridge that face away from the dragon.\nForward Stomp.\nThe Hellkite Drake moves forward to crush the player with one of its front feet. This can be avoided by retreating out of range of the attack, rolling forward to get past the attack or attempting to block it with a high &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt; shield.\nStomp.\nSimilar to the Front Stomp, however, it uses this when the player is much closer to it. Affects a small area beneath it. Can be dodged by either rolling to one side, or by rolling away from the Drake.\nHead Ram.\nThe Hellkite Drake rears its head to one side, and then sweeps it across the width of the bridge. Can be avoided by either rolling into or away from the attack.\nTail Whip.\nUsed when the player is not directly within biting range but not far enough away to trigger a flame breath attack. It will not perform this attack if the tail has been cut off. Can be avoided by rolling towards and under the attack.\nJumping Flame Dash.\nThe Hellkite Drake hovers in the air, and then dashes towards the player, whilst exhaling flame on the bridge. Can only be avoided by descending the stairs in the middle of the bridge."}

Although almost visibly identical to his brethren, he also sports a red cape to differentiate his status between his fellow knights.\nAfter his corruption in Izalith and his descent into shadows, Arkon becomes a black knight, lordless and alone. He disposes of his cape and glows with interior flames that spill from his eyes and the gaps in his armor, as though he is embered.\nLore.\nArkon partook in the war between the &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;Gods&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Ancients\"&gt;Age of Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. In the midst of a particular skirmish, he is subject to an ambush from the creatures where his master, &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord Gwyn&lt;/a&gt; is snatched by a dragon and taken into the sky. Arkon, too craven to act, watched the God be kidnapped, powerless to do anything against the mighty creatures whilst watching his fellow knights burnt into cinders by the dragon's fire breath. However, this &lt;a href=\"chaos\"&gt;chaos&lt;/a&gt; was soon quelled by &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Artorias\"&gt;Knight Artorias&lt;/a&gt; who saved Arkon from death, before silently taking his leave. Gwyn, having returned after killing his kidnappers sees the deceased dragon in front of Arkon and perceives this work to be done by the Silver Knight. Arkon, in his shame, does nothing to stop the God from congratulating him and granting him the title of Dragonkiller, an everlasting reminder of his failures.\nPlot.\nArkon and a group of Silver Knights are investigating the disappearance of several handmaidens of the goddess &lt;a href=\"Gwynevere%2C%20Princess%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Gwynevere&lt;/a&gt;. Their search leads them to the sewers of &lt;a href=\"The%20Duke%27s%20Archives\"&gt;The Duke's Archives&lt;/a&gt;, and Arkon is greeted by several &lt;a href=\"Channeler\"&gt;Channeler&lt;/a&gt;s and leader among them, &lt;a href=\"Channeler%20Liste\"&gt;Channeler Liste&lt;/a&gt; alongside several chained young women. Arkon demands that he releases the handmaidens, but Liste retorts that he is only in possession of lowly street urchins, and that the knights are trespassing on property of &lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;Seath the Scaleless&lt;/a&gt;, demanding that they leave.\nLater, within the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Ward\"&gt;Lower Ward&lt;/a&gt;, Arkon meets with friend &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight%20Gravis\"&gt;Dragon Knight Gravis&lt;/a&gt; within a tavern to discuss the confrontation with Liste. Mercenary &lt;a href=\"Executioner%20Wurdow\"&gt;Executioner Wurdow&lt;/a&gt; soon disrupts the conversation and goads the two. A duel begins to emerge before Arkon is suddenly called upon by a peasant to return to &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; on Gwyn's orders.\nArkon returns to the city, where he is greeted by Silver Knight &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Siefer\"&gt;Captain Siefer&lt;/a&gt;. Arkon tells Siefer of his failure to retrieve the handmaidens, but Siefer tells Arkon of far more pressing matters within &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Izalith\"&gt;Lost Izalith&lt;/a&gt; - Siefer tells Arkon that he is to lead a large battalion into Izalith to investigate the disappearance of several messengers. Though Arkon is reluctant, Lord Gwyn himself, sitting nearby on his throne, encourages the decision.\nArkon is sent alongside his knights into the depths of Lost Izalith, and is seen alongside fellow knight &lt;a href=\"Garl%20Vinland\"&gt;Garl Vinland&lt;/a&gt; battling several &lt;a href=\"Taurus%20Demon\"&gt;Taurus Demon&lt;/a&gt;s and sending them into a retreat. The Knights follow in hot pursuit. As Arkon and his knights pursue the beaked demon, Garl remarks that the demons flee from their torches. As they turn a corner, however, the beaked demon, standing in front of the &lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; replies with \"hide from fire? Foolish metal giant. We are flame.\" Garl is suddenly consumed by the flame and disintegrates. With Arkon's dismay, the demon reassures him that \"thy friend is still of this world, only changed\". It then announces that it will grant him the same gift and clutches Arkon's helmet with its arms ablaze. Arkon is suddenly transported to an illusion of the Unformed World, in which his troubled past continues to haunt him. Arkon suddenly blackens out.\nHe soon awakens from his slumber only to realize his armor has become black. The decaying body of the beaked demon greets him and cites that his fellow knights are still alive, but also suffer from the same curse and have long-since abandoned him. Arkon in his anger crushes the demon with a boulder and takes his leave.\nHis travels takes him to the land of &lt;a href=\"Oolacile\"&gt;Oolacile&lt;/a&gt;, where he suddenly encounters Knight Artorias. Artorias mistakes Arkon for a &lt;a href=\"Darkwraith\"&gt;Darkwraith&lt;/a&gt; and a battle between them ensues. Artorias quickly overpowers the Black Knight and prepares for the killing blow, before suddenly recognizing Arkon. Artorias informs Arkon that \"a &lt;a href=\"The%20Dark\"&gt;great darkness&lt;/a&gt; has fallen upon Lordran\", and that Lord Gwyn requires him more than ever.\nArkon takes leave for Anor Londo, and soon returns, only to find that Gwyn had left the city. After traversing into the &lt;a href=\"Kiln%20of%20the%20First%20Flame\"&gt;Kiln of the First Flame&lt;/a&gt; and witnessing the spirits of his fellow knights, he makes his way to the structure of the kiln, only to drop to his knees in despair after realizing that Gwyn had sacrificed himself to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing this, Arkon returned to the city to find the Lower Ward being burned by the minions of Seath, who now had command of the sector. Arkon calls Gravis a coward before he and Siefer argue, as Arkon believes that burning the ward is wrong, and blames his fellows for not stopping Gwyn from sacrificing himself. Siefer argues that they had no right to question their god, and that they must keep the fires lit so as to ward of the falling shadows of the Lower Ward, Lost Izalith, and &lt;a href=\"New%20Londo\"&gt;New Londo&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs they go to fight, they are interrupted by the newly-transformed crystal-giant that was once Channeler Liste - a huge brute wielding a massively wooden club. Arkon refuses to help Siefer burn the ward, and together he and Gravis fight to fell the monster. Falling at the end of the fight, Arkon awakens as a black knight before he is put down temporarily by Gravis before she flees, realizing that her friend is gone.\nArkon stumbles across the ashen battlefield, collapsing to his knees as Wurdow demands to know where the hollowing Gravis has gone. The captain of the Silver Knights silently unclips his red cloak, which is quickly swept away by an ash-gray wind.\nArkon's story ends as he proceeds through the passageways of the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Asylum\"&gt;Undead Asylum&lt;/a&gt;. The narrator tells their audience that Arkon - a 'lordless black knight' - wandered Lordran for centuries to combat the spreading darkness. In solitude, however, Arkon was told to have one day changed into what he despised most: a silver knight, once loyal to his masters and to the burning flame, can become a black knight, loyal to none, lurking in the dark. The narrator assures whoever is hearing this tale that even should Arkon or any silver knight some day fall to the dark, we should not despair. The narrator says that the future holds &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;an eternity of heroes&lt;/a&gt;, and before long \"&lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; will set forth to light the way, and rid the world of shadows\" as said Chosen Undead finally slays the wayward Arkon in the shadowy halls of the asylum."}

Invades as a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Spirit%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;dark spirit&lt;/a&gt; in a small room at the end of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Ringed%20City%20%28location%29%23Bonfires\"&gt;Ringed City Streets&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce reaching the bottom of the stairs of the street, stay left to find a ladder allowing access to the last buildings. From there, drop onto a stone path that leads toward a destroyed tower. On one of the balconies of said tower, Ledo will invade (his invasion is triggered a bit before entering the tower from the stone path).\nHe can also be summoned by the &lt;a href=\"Judicator%20Giant\"&gt;Judicator Giant&lt;/a&gt;s for a single attack.\nLore.\nOne of the original knights who served &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord Gwyn&lt;/a&gt;, Ledo made a name for himself within the order but wasn't as renowned as the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Knights%20of%20Gwyn\"&gt;Four Knights of Gwyn&lt;/a&gt;. Regarded as an eccentric, Ledo traveled the world and befriended many beings including &lt;a href=\"Havel%20the%20Rock%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Havel the Rock&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Judicator%20Giant\"&gt;Judicator Giant&lt;/a&gt;s.\nStrategy.\nLedo will invade the player when they explore the tower above the &lt;a href=\"The%20Ringed%20City%20%28location%29%23Bonfires\"&gt;Ringed City Streets&lt;/a&gt;. The small confines of the room make him particularly dangerous and he will likely kill the player swiftly if they are cornered. His hammer swings are slow but very powerful and will deplete virtually all stamina if blocked. If the player keeps their guard up for too long, he will use a guard break followed by an immediate swing that can instantly kill them.\nOccasionally, Ledo will activate the &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; of his hammer, &lt;a href=\"Call%20to%20Stone\"&gt;Call to Stone&lt;/a&gt;, allowing him to perform spinning strikes that have the potential to wipe out the player in a single hit. Even if evaded, the area-of-effect blast at the end of the attack has a short stun effect that can prove deadly if Ledo is in attack range.\nIf the player wishes to avoid confronting Ledo directly, they can use ranged attacks to strike him from the tower's entrance, as long as they use a form of concealment such as the &lt;a href=\"Slumbering%20Dragoncrest%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Slumbering Dragoncrest Ring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spook\"&gt;Spook&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Body%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Hidden Body&lt;/a&gt;. It is important not to enter the tower, as this will aggro Ledo and he will immediately rush to attack."}

The only true advantage that the Silver Knight Shield has is that it requires less &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; to wield, making it more ideal on builds that attempt to limit their amount of Strength investment in favor of other stats.\nUpgrades.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

Once a player obtains this kind of Sin, their username is entered into the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20the%20Guilty\"&gt;Book of the Guilty&lt;/a&gt;, and will remain there until the Sin value returns to zero.\nThe other Sin refers to whether or not the player has made NPCs hostile towards the player. This type of Sin is not logged in the Book of the Guilty, but is instead informed to the player by &lt;a href=\"Oswald%20of%20Carim\"&gt;Oswald of Carim&lt;/a&gt;, by allowing the player to pay for absolution.\nObtaining \"Book of the Guilty Sin\".\nThere are two ways to become logged in the Book of the Guilty.\nEach time this occurs the player will receive one point of Sin.\nRemoving \"Book of the Guilty Sin\".\nThe only way to lose this sin is to be invaded by members of the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Darkmoon\"&gt;Blade of the Darkmoon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;. Each time the player dies during a PvP match with a Blade of the Darkmoon, their sin count will be reduced by one. This happens regardless of what killed the player, or if the invader had any part in their death.\nWhen this score returns to zero, the player will no longer be a target for Blue Eye Orb invasions.\nObtaining \"NPC Hostility Sin\".\nAngering any non-hostile NPC will trigger this type of sinner status on the player. Unlike the Book of the Guilty, it is not accrued and there is no distinction between angering one NPC or many. There are two ways to anger NPCs:\nRemoving \"NPC Hostility Sin\".\nThis sin can be cleared by paying &lt;a href=\"Oswald%20of%20Carim\"&gt;Oswald of Carim&lt;/a&gt; a fee for absolution. The cost of absolution is 500 souls per level, meaning a level 50 player would have to pay 25,000 souls.\nClearing this Sin will cause aggro'd NPCs to become friendly again, and unwelcoming covenants will allow the player to rejoin."}

Sin affects how often the player is invaded by &lt;a href=\"Arbiter%20Spirit\"&gt;Arbiter Spirit&lt;/a&gt;s.\nGaining Sin.\nSin is gained in the following ways:\n&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Remnants\"&gt;Dragon Remnants&lt;/a&gt; members cannot gain sin by using the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Eye%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dragon Eye&lt;/a&gt;, and members of the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Sentinels\"&gt;Blue Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; will not gain sin by hunting down sinners or assisting other members of the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20Blue\"&gt;Way of Blue&lt;/a&gt; covenant.\nAbsolving Sin.\nSin can be absolved in one of two ways. One way is to be killed by an arbiter spirit, the other is to seek a pardon from &lt;a href=\"Cromwell%20the%20Pardoner\"&gt;Cromwell the Pardoner&lt;/a&gt;\nWhen invading, if a Blue Sentinel comes to assist and the invading player is killed, they will lose one point of sin.\nIn the , players can absolve their sins for free once for each character.\nLevels.\nThe following table displays the different levels of sin that can be acquired.\nWretch status removes the cap related to the total amount of &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; that can be lost after multiple &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;s. Normally, this cap is 50% (10 deaths at 5% HP loss per death). A Wretch will continue to lose 5% HP per death after the 10th time. In other words, the player will have only 5% of their maximum Health after dying nineteen (19) times (95% of their health bar will be empty).\nThis can, however, be used with great effect when using the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Pyromancy%20Flame\"&gt;Dark Pyromancy Flame&lt;/a&gt;, since it scales off the player's hollowing. Additionally, by using the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Binding\"&gt;Ring of Binding&lt;/a&gt;, the player will mostly offset such a steep loss of health by keeping it at about 75%."}

The dragon's breath can be heard before spotting him. He will be resting over a rocky structure, getting close to it will make the dragon roar and fly away. A second encounter will happen on the bridge leading to the entrance to Dragon's Sanctum. Sinh will appear and blast the bridge with fireballs, killing the two &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20Soldier\"&gt;Sanctum Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s (and possibly the player if they stand too close).\nThe third and final encounter will happen after entering the white fog in &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Dragon's Rest&lt;/a&gt;, where the boss fight takes place. Sinh will wake from its slumber, throw its fiery breath upwards, and attempt to body slam the player from its nest before properly starting the battle.\nSummoning.\n&lt;a href=\"Transcendent%20Edde\"&gt;Transcendent Edde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Abbess%20Feeva\"&gt;Abbess Feeva&lt;/a&gt; can be &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;summoned&lt;/a&gt; to fight Sinh. Their summon signs are on opposite sides of the bonfire before the &lt;a href=\"Fog%20Door%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Fog Door&lt;/a&gt; leading to the boss fight.\nDue to the dragon's high &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; resist, Transcendent Edde is generally the better summon since Abbess Feeva uses &lt;a href=\"Miracles%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt; to attack. He also has more HP and can take the attacks better.\nLore.\nSinh was a long-sleeping &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; who was found and worshiped by the people of &lt;a href=\"Shulva%2C%20Sanctum%20City\"&gt;Shulva, Sanctum City&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Sunken%20King\"&gt;Sunken King&lt;/a&gt; built the city itself around Sinh's resting place, and created &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Dragon's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; to protect the dragon from intruders. The Sanctum Soldiers guarded the dragon while the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20Priestess\"&gt;Sanctum Priestess&lt;/a&gt;es attempted to continue its slumber with their song.\nHowever, &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Yorgh\"&gt;Sir Yorgh&lt;/a&gt; and his powerful &lt;a href=\"Drakeblood%20Knight\"&gt;Drakeblood Knight&lt;/a&gt;s eventually mounted a siege and invaded Shulva in order to defeat the dragon and steal its fresh blood, which they believed granted \"a true understanding of life\". They were able to defeat all the guards of Dragon's Sanctum and attack Dragon's Rest where Yorgh engaged Sinh. The dragon proved far too powerful for Yorgh to withstand, and he was killed as the poison which built up inside Sinh over the ages was expelled and completely wiped out Sanctum City, covering it in toxic poison. Yorgh's body lies near the dragon's nest, holding &lt;a href=\"Yorgh%27s%20Ring\"&gt;Yorgh's Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is unknown whether this poison was also the cause of the contamination of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Gulch\"&gt;Black Gulch&lt;/a&gt;, but its proximity to Shulva and noxious nature of Black Gulch may have some connection.\nAttacks.\nHead Sweep: Sinh will swing his head and neck from left to right when the player is close.\nStraight Flame: Used when the player is some distance away from Sinh. He will shoot flame in a straight line and will not track the player if he/she strafes to either side. This attack is dangerous to block as it will consume a lot of stamina, possibly resulting in a guard break.\nSweeping Flame: Similar to the Straight Flame attack, Sinh will use this when the player is far away. He begins breathing fire to his left and continues to his right. Running straight in towards Sinh's body can avoid this attack if the player begins as soon as Sinh starts to breathe fire. This opens up an opportunity to attack, since Sinh will not stop breathing fire even if they player gets close.\n180 Flame: Sinh will use this if the player spends too long near his hind legs or tail. He will raise up on slightly and turn his head, breathing fire at anyone directly behind him. It can be avoided by moving around his back in the opposite direction of the dragon's head.\nFiery Drive-by: Used when Sinh takes flight. The start-up is similar to the nosedive, but instead of ramming the player with his snout, Sinh unleashes a streak of flame along the ground. This can be avoided either by quickly dodging to the side of the flame or by running straight towards Sinh while he is in the air. Doing so will cause the flame to pass harmlessly over the player's head.\nClose Range Flame: Triggered when the player is close to Sinh. He will rear up on his hind legs and shoot flame straight down in front of himself. This can be avoided by running around his back and presents an opportunity to attack his tail.\nAerial Fireball: Used when Sinh takes flight. He will hover in place for a moment then unleash a fireball at the player. It has a slight &lt;a href=\"area-of-effect\"&gt;area-of-effect&lt;/a&gt; effect after striking the ground. It can be dodged by &lt;a href=\"rolling\"&gt;rolling&lt;/a&gt; to the side or can miss entirely by running towards Sinh while he is in the air.\nBody Slam: Sinh will always use this attack at the start of the battle, and will periodically use it throughout the fight if the player is some distance from him. He will quickly charge forward, trying to hit the player with his head. He rears up slightly at the end of the attack and can land on top of the player if they are underneath him when his front feet hit the ground.\nClaw Swipe: Triggered when standing in front of Sinh. He will swipe with his right claw and can follow it up with a slam from his left fist. This attack is very fast and can be difficult to dodge because Sinh only gives a small tell before he uses it. It can be avoided by dodging to the right after attacking Sinh's head or chest once.\nTail Whip: Sinh will whip around up to three times, pausing slightly after the second before spinning a third time. This attack is highly damaging and can catch players by surprise because of its range and speed. The safest place to be is directly beneath Sinh.\nNosedive: One of Sinh's airborne attacks. He will dive-bomb the player and attempt to hit them with his snout. Like the rest of his aerial attacks, the safest strategy to avoid the nosedive is to run straight towards him the instant he takes flight. Failing that, the attack can be dodged by rolling to either side.\nDefenses.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 Sinh, the Slumbering Dragon by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWQJHWAHUgM&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

For his service the Iron King bestowed Alonne's name to his &lt;a href=\"Alonne%20Knight\"&gt;knights&lt;/a&gt;.\nFight overview.\nThe player battles Sir Alonne in a large room with plenty of space to move around. He attacks with several different strikes and dashing attacks from long distances, and a move similar to &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Greatsword\"&gt;Dark Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;. He wields the &lt;a href=\"Bewitched%20Alonne%20Sword\"&gt;Bewitched Alonne Sword&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttacks.\nGliding Slash: Sir Alonne will hop backwards once or twice. Note that if the player is standing behind him this will cause damage. Alonne will then glide across the floor and bring his sword in a diagonal upwards slash. This move has two variants: the first is a faster sword slash and shorter glide, while the second is a much slower slash with a longer glide. The timing on the second can be deceptive to the player, especially if they are expecting the faster variant.\nGliding Stab: Has a similar tell to the gliding slash: Sir Alonne will hop backwards then execute a stab attack.\u00a0This attack drains a lot of stamina if blocked.\u00a0\nDark Sword: Similar to Dark Greatsword. If the player is some distance from him, Sir Alonne will unleash several horizontal waves which cause magic damage upon impact.\nImpale: Sir Alonne will charge up for a moment before lunging towards the player, impaling them with his sword if he connects. This is a grab attack and therefore cannot be blocked. The attack drains health from the player and buffs Alonne's sword for roughly 40 seconds.\nParry and Riposte: Similar to &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Sinner\"&gt;The Lost Sinner&lt;/a&gt;, Sir Alonne will sometimes change the way he holds his sword, almost appearing as though he is attempting to block. Should the player attempt to attack him in this pose, Sir Alonne is able to parry and then riposte the player, dealing a large amount of damage.\nKick: He will kick the player if they are constantly shielding oneself. High stamina drain.\nDefenses.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 Sir Alonne by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AFza6bV9iQ&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

He is voiced by .\nLocation.\nSir Vilhelm is initially found outside the chapel where &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Friede\"&gt;Sister Friede&lt;/a&gt; is located. He will tell the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20One\"&gt;Ashen One&lt;/a&gt; that, if they are lost, they may speak with Friede for guidance.\nVilhelm is encountered a second time, in the building that houses &lt;a href=\"The%20Painter\"&gt;The Painter&lt;/a&gt;. He will be hostile to the player and must be defeated in order for the player to progress further.\nLore.\nA &lt;a href=\"hollow\"&gt;hollow&lt;/a&gt;ed knight and hangman of &lt;a href=\"Londor\"&gt;Londor&lt;/a&gt;, Vilhelm served &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Friede\"&gt;Sister Friede&lt;/a&gt; both in Londor and in the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Painted World&lt;/a&gt;, and seeks to prevent the burning of the painting.\nHis &lt;a href=\"Onyx%20Blade\"&gt;greatsword&lt;/a&gt; was a gift from Friede, and a symbol of Vilhelm's resignation from her service. However, Vilhelm stayed in the Painted World despite accepting the blade. He was the one to bring Painter to the library's attic. However, it is not stated if he enclosed her or were just guarding the key and Painter herself.\nAfter the Ashen One is told by Friede to leave, he says the same, warning the player of the increasing danger the further through the painting they dare traverse. When encountered in the building housing The Painter, he will deride the inquisitiveness of the Ashen One, saying that they lack the stomach to face the danger they will put themselves in. He attempts to kill the Ashen One but he is vanquished in the process saying his goodbye to his lady.\nStrategy.\nSir Vilhelm is a resourceful and powerful combatant with an aggressive fighting style. \nAt his disposal he has in his right hand an extremely powerful &lt;a href=\"Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;greatsword&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Onyx%20Blade\"&gt;Onyx Blade&lt;/a&gt;, a weapon that is extremely high damaging and has one of the largest ranges of all in its class, as well as many thrust attacks that can deal extra damage should players be caught mid attack.\nIn his left hand, he will use mostly the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Hand\"&gt;Dark Hand&lt;/a&gt; to block attacks occasionally, and often attempting to siphon health from players who get too close. This can be used to one's advantage especially if wielding weapons that deal plenty of stamina damage, as guard breaking him is extremely easy. \nHowever, should players hold a casting tool (&lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20Flame%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Pyromancy Flame&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Chimes%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Sacred Chime&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Talismans%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Talisman&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Staff&lt;/a&gt;) on their hands at any time, Vilhelm will almost immediately swap his Dark Hand for the &lt;a href=\"Canvas%20Talisman%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Canvas Talisman&lt;/a&gt;, and will cast &lt;a href=\"Vow%20of%20Silence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Vow of Silence&lt;/a&gt; in combination with &lt;a href=\"Unfaltering%20Prayer\"&gt;Unfaltering Prayer&lt;/a&gt; to negate any spells the player has. He will repeat this many times over as the fight progresses; as soon as the spell runs out he will recast it. \nLike &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Knight%20Hodrick\"&gt;Holy Knight Hodrick&lt;/a&gt;, it can be clear to see when he is about to cast a spell, he will switch to the Talisman and begin running in the opposite direction of the player. If he has above half health, then he will cast Vow of Silence, so waiting for him to cast it can be a good idea for a backstab. However, if he is below half health, then the player should keep an aggressive behavior and follow him, keep close to him and backstab him immediately so he will not heal.\nEquipment.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nCorvian Settlement=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Her true quest is to confront her grandfather, &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Knight%20Hodrick\"&gt;Hodrick&lt;/a&gt;, and end his madness.\nIn addition to being able to summon her, Sirris calls upon the player's assistance during her quest to help combat her opponents.\nQuestline.\nSirris is first encountered at &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt; after igniting the &lt;a href=\"Halfway%20Fortress\"&gt;Halfway Fortress&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;; however, she won't interact with the player beyond some dialogue, and will leave afterward. Once the player delivers the &lt;a href=\"Dreamchaser%27s%20Ashes\"&gt;Dreamchaser's Ashes&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20Handmaid\"&gt;Shrine Handmaid&lt;/a&gt;, Sirris will re-appear at Firelink Shrine and introduce herself, as well as teach the &lt;a href=\"Gestures%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Darkmoon Loyalty gesture&lt;/a&gt;. She then leaves her sign to assist the player against the &lt;a href=\"Deacons%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Deacons of the Deep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Abyss%20Watchers\"&gt;Abyss Watchers&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon reaching &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt; and lighting the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Irithyll\"&gt;Central Irithyll&lt;/a&gt; bonfire and then reloading the area, a summon sign will appear at the start of the bridge which allows the player to be summoned to Sirris's world to help her defeat &lt;a href=\"Creighton%20the%20Wanderer%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Creighton the Wanderer&lt;/a&gt;. After Creighton is defeated, Sirris will return to Firelink and thank the player with a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Blessed%20Gem\"&gt;Blessed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mail%20Breaker%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Mail Breaker&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Silvercat%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Silvercat Ring&lt;/a&gt;. This may be skipped to progress through her questline.\nOnce the player defeats both the &lt;a href=\"Curse-rotted%20Greatwood\"&gt;Curse-rotted Greatwood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aldrich%2C%20Devourer%20of%20Gods\"&gt;Aldrich, Devourer of Gods&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20Handmaid\"&gt;Shrine Handmaid&lt;/a&gt; will sell a unique &lt;a href=\"Budding%20Green%20Blossom\"&gt;Budding Green Blossom&lt;/a&gt;, with a special message on it. This is a hint to the player to return to &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Undead Settlement&lt;/a&gt; and go to the arena where the Greatwood was fought. A summon sign can be found at the cusp of the pit, allowing the player to assist Sirris within the Pit of Hollows below. Here, she will confront &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Knight%20Hodrick\"&gt;Holy Knight Hodrick&lt;/a&gt;, her grandfather, and defeat him with the player's assistance. After the fight, the &lt;a href=\"Sunset%20Shield\"&gt;Sunset Shield&lt;/a&gt; will appear at an isolated grave just outside of Firelink Shrine, and the &lt;a href=\"Sunset%20Set\"&gt;Sunset Set&lt;/a&gt; can be found within the &lt;a href=\"Pit%20of%20Hollows\"&gt;Pit of Hollows&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Hodrick is defeated, Sirris will appear at Firelink Shrine and ask to swear a vow of knighthood to the player. If accepted, she can be summoned for the &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Armour\"&gt;Dragonslayer Armour&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lorian%2C%20Elder%20Prince%20and%20Lothric%2C%20Younger%20Prince\"&gt;Twin Princes&lt;/a&gt; boss fights. Regardless of whether she was summoned for any of these battles, once both bosses are defeated her corpse can be found at the same grave where the Sunset Shield was found, holding the &lt;a href=\"Sunless%20Talisman\"&gt;Sunless Talisman&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf her knighthood is refused, Sirris will remain at Firelink Shrine to give the player a chance to change their mind; however, once the player defeats any boss, she will leave. Once this happens, she can be found &lt;a href=\"hollow\"&gt;hollow&lt;/a&gt;ed in the Pit of Hollows, praying to the Altar of Sacrifice. Approaching will cause her to immediately become hostile, and she can be killed for her talisman at this point.\nRegardless of cause, the Shrine Handmaid will have the &lt;a href=\"Sunless%20Set\"&gt;Sunless Set&lt;/a&gt; for sale after Sirris's death.\nStrategy.\nWhen given the opportunity, Sirris will cast &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Blade%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Darkmoon Blade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Barrier%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic Barrier&lt;/a&gt;, increasing her damage output and granting her increased defense against &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; damage. She alternates between wielding her &lt;a href=\"Estoc%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Estoc&lt;/a&gt; in one or both hands, however it does only moderate amounts of damage and is easily &lt;a href=\"Parry%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parried&lt;/a&gt;. When she is low on health, she will attempt to cast &lt;a href=\"Heal%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt; rather than consume Estus, rendering her vulnerable to &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Backstab&lt;/a&gt;s."}

Together with &lt;a href=\"Yuria%20of%20Londor\"&gt;Yuria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liliane\"&gt;Liliane&lt;/a&gt;, Elfriede became the maiden of Kaathe and the Primordial Serpent taught them his art of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Hand%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark Hand&lt;/a&gt;, which was capable of absorbing the souls of their opponents. Together they continued to follow Kaathe's goal of ending the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Age of Fire&lt;/a&gt; founded by the gods to bring about the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Dark\"&gt;Age of Dark&lt;/a&gt; and finding a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Lord\"&gt;Dark Lord&lt;/a&gt; who would be strong enough to usurp the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; for themselves and use its powers to lead the humans into a new age. For this end the three sisters founded the &lt;a href=\"Sable%20Church\"&gt;Sable Church&lt;/a&gt; with just their impressive strength, an organization that aimed to offer salvation to the &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;Hollow&lt;/a&gt;s, and Elfriede, as the eldest sister, became its leader. Over time an increasing number of Undead and Hollows would find refuge with them, evolving into a society made up of those who have lived miserable lives, incredibly old people full of secrets and deceit. This place would become known with the name of &lt;a href=\"Londor\"&gt;Londor&lt;/a&gt;, a place where hollows where able to live outside the oppression of other human society using &lt;a href=\"Purging%20Stone%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;purging stones&lt;/a&gt; to ease their condition and even mining their stagnant Humanity to create &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Gem\"&gt;Hollow Gem&lt;/a&gt;s that they then used to forge weapons.\nThe Sable Church lead by Elfriede continued to grow and began to develop its &lt;a href=\"Vow%20of%20Silence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;dark miracles&lt;/a&gt;, forge its weapons and train knights completely loyal to their cause . In fact the &lt;a href=\"Londor%20Pale%20Shade\"&gt;Londor Pale Shade&lt;/a&gt;s, darkly shriveled and immortal Hollows who fought without honor or pursuit of glory but only to fulfill their duty to the Sable Church , were assassins and knights who are sent to the rest of the world to serve the interests of the Sable Church , even learning the power of the Dark Hand. At some point Elfriede would accept &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Vilhelm\"&gt;Sir Vilhelm&lt;/a&gt; as her knight, bestowing her &lt;a href=\"Onyx%20Blade\"&gt;Onyx Blade&lt;/a&gt; to him who became extremely loyal to her and her cold-blooded hangman. To pursue the interests of Londor and realize their dream of an Age of Dark, Elfriede, as leader of the country of Hollows, finally attempted to usurp the First Flame. However she only managed to take control of a spark, turning into a blackflame, before she ended up failing as the power of the Flame consumed her, burning her face and leaving her as &lt;a href=\"Unkindled\"&gt;Unkindled&lt;/a&gt; reduced to ashes.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; continued to fade and &lt;a href=\"Lothric%2C%20Younger%20Prince\"&gt;Prince Lothric&lt;/a&gt; refused to link it, the &lt;a href=\"Unkindled\"&gt;Unkindled&lt;/a&gt; were exhumed from their graves to hunt down the &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lords of Cinder&lt;/a&gt; of the past that had refused to return to their \"thrones\" and serve as fuel for the Flame a second time. Among them Elfriede return too however she renounced everything, leaving behind her role as leader of the Sable Church, Londor and even her name, becoming known simply as \"Friede\". Having lost her role along with her home she was eventually drawn into the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Painted World of Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;, where the forlorns, unwanted souls without a place to go, were welcomed and found refuge and became the first Ashen One to reside in it. Here she came to accept the frost of the Painted World and came to consider it her new home. She discovered that she wanted to \"protect\" the people who inhabited the Painted World and assumed the precise form that they yearned for, that of their mistress &lt;a href=\"Priscilla\"&gt;Priscilla&lt;/a&gt;, even going so far as to wield a &lt;a href=\"Friede%27s%20Great%20Scythe\"&gt;great scythe&lt;/a&gt; that represented the symbol of a long-lost home for the inhabitants of the painting like the one that Priscilla similarly wielded. At a certain point her knight, &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Vilhelm\"&gt;Sir Vilhelm&lt;/a&gt;, found her in the painted world, returning to her service despite having been released his duty\nOver time Friede earned the trust of some of the inhabitants of the painting, to the point that the &lt;a href=\"Corvian%20Knight\"&gt;Corvian Knight&lt;/a&gt;s who protected the village became infatuated with her, but above all she managed to get close to &lt;a href=\"Father%20Ariandel\"&gt;Father Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;, a great Corvian who had the task of guarding the Flame inside of the Painted World and to restore it using the fire when the painting began to rot, to bring it back to life and avoid the fate of the stagnant outside world. However, just when the painting began to be corrupted and its inhabitants made up their minds to burn it away, Friede opposed their wish, preferring a slow death in the comforting rot to the renewing change of the Flame. And so she convinced Ariandel to bury the Flame of the painting and hold back its strenght using his blood while her Corvian Knights swore to \"protected\" the painting from fire and even killed their own brethren who opposed her. At some point the &lt;a href=\"The%20Painter\"&gt;Painter&lt;/a&gt; would be imprisoned in the library of the corvian village and guarded by Sir Vilhelm to prevent her from restoring the painting, prompting &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Knight%20Gael\"&gt;Slave Knight Gael&lt;/a&gt; to escape from the painting taking a rotten scrap of it and begin searching for another Unkindled that would fulfill the prophecy stating that when the Ashes inside the painting became two the Flame would return and burn the rot away.\nFriede thus remained in the cathedral of the painted world, protecting the Flame and Ariandel from anyone who tried to reach them, while the &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Corvian%20Settler\"&gt;inhabitants of the painting rotted&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Fly\"&gt;filthy insects spread&lt;/a&gt;. When an &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20One\"&gt;Ashen One&lt;/a&gt; arrived in the painting she would kindly but firmly invite them to leave and return to the outside world, leaving the inhabitants of the painting in peace and forget about them. When they ignore her advice and descend the cathedral to confront Father Ariandel she would be forced to wield her scythe and confront them, not before asking Father Ariandel to turn his gaze away from the imminent carnage. When she is defeated the first time, an enraged Ariandel sparks the Flame he bled so much to prevent it from rekindling in a desperate attempt to revive her. Now rekindled, Friede would come back from death to fight by his side again, their souls linked. After falling a second time, Friede would rise yet again thanks to her inner Dark Flame in one final struggle to defeat the Ashen One and prevent the painted world from being eventually replaced with a new one.\nStrategy.\nFirst Phase: Sister Friede.\nFirst of all, it is suggested to use a light weapon (such as a &lt;a href=\"Straight%20Swords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;straight sword&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;greatsword&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) to avoid the risk of being stun-locked by her fast attacks, and also a &lt;a href=\"Greatshields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;greatshield&lt;/a&gt; with high &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt; to minimize some &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; damage.\nAfter the beginning of the fight, be careful and learn her attack patterns while blocking with your shield (be careful anyway, because her &lt;a href=\"Friede%27s%20Great%20Scythe\"&gt;scythe&lt;/a&gt; inflicts &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; damage).\nNote that Friede will nearly always jump away after one or two hits, so it is not advised to go for more as it is very easy to disregard stamina and become open for a devastating counterattack. While she seems to have very little &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt;, she sometimes will almost completely ignore the player's attacks and poise through them with no trouble, guaranteeing the player gets hit if they are getting greedy.\nOccasionally, she will turn invisible and move rapidly through the room, and after a short time, she will perform a grab with her scythe that inflicts heavy damage if not stopped and is difficult to dodge &lt;a href=\"roll\"&gt;roll&lt;/a&gt; away from. It is possible to track her by paying careful attention to which way she jumps. She will either jump to the side, or over the player's head and land behind them. Another way is to run straightforward at her when she turns invisible, as being in close proximity to her or attacking her will cause her to reappear. \nSecond Phase: Father Ariandel and Friede.\nAfter killing Friede in her first phase, a cutscene will play in which &lt;a href=\"Father%20Ariandel\"&gt;Father Ariandel&lt;/a&gt; enters a berserk state, expands the arena, resurrects Friede, and begins to fight the player alongside Friede. During this phase, both Father Ariandel and Sister Friede will share the same health bar, and both will die once the health bar is depleted.\nSister Friede will fight much more defensively, opting to cast ice spells from afar instead of directly engaging the player. However, she will still attack if the player gets too close to her.\nFather Ariandel fights by using his bowl like a weapon and uses it to try and crush the player. He also has several &lt;a href=\"area%20of%20effect\"&gt;area of effect&lt;/a&gt; attacks that are best avoided by staying either away from him, or behind him. He moves slowly and will charge at the player if they are too far away from him to be hit by any of his attacks.\n-If the player has used &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Knight%20Gael\"&gt;Slave Knight Gael's&lt;/a&gt; summon sign, he will be summoned into the arena once the second phase begins.\n-The first time the player defeats this phase, they will be rewarded with a &lt;a href=\"Titanite%20Slab%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Titanite Slab&lt;/a&gt;\nThird Phase: Blackflame Friede.\nAfter defeating the second phase, Friede will resurrect a final time. She will now fight with two scythes. Her original scythe will typically be coated in \"Black Flame\", and will deal significantly more damage than before. Her secondary scythe will deal heavy &lt;a href=\"frost\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt;bite damage, as well as wielding multiple ranged attacks freezing the ground and building up your frost bite meter. She will also go invisible and continuously freeze the ground running up to you and won't stop until attacked. Many of her attacks will gain an area of effect and become incredibly damaging. She will also fight far more aggressively than before."}

They wield of variety of weapons and are capable of fighting despite missing limbs and even their heads.\nSome skeletons in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Undead Settlement&lt;/a&gt; appear much more decayed, with plantlife growing out from their bodies.\nLocations.\n&lt;a href=\"Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Undead Settlement&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Catacombs%20of%20Carthus\"&gt;Catacombs of Carthus&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Smouldering%20Lake\"&gt;Smouldering Lake&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Ringed%20City%20%28location%29\"&gt;The Ringed City&lt;/a&gt;\nStrategy.\nSkeletons often appear in packs and their aggressive fighting style can easily kill an unprepared player. They use a variety of sword attacks, including a leaping slice, dashing lunge, and a dive attack that briefly causes them to fall apart. All of their attacks cause &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt; build-up, and can also &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parry and riposte&lt;/a&gt; the player for heavy damage.\nMost skeletons reanimate when the player is close to them; this process takes a few seconds, however, leaving them vulnerable whilst they assemble themselves. They make a distinct sound when reanimating, so the player should listen out for it when exploring skeleton-inhabited lairs to avoid being ambushed. They are very weak to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; and will flail helplessly if ignited.\nSome of the skeletons in the &lt;a href=\"Catacombs%20of%20Carthus\"&gt;Catacombs of Carthus&lt;/a&gt; have white glowing eyes and will reanimate a second time when defeated.

Only two appear in the game, both in long and narrow passageways where evasion is compromised.\nThey suddenly appear behind unsuspecting undead, their presence announced by the sound of moans from beyond the grave and crushing bone, and start rolling forward. They are impervious to attack and will deal a huge amount of damage should they run over the player or any other unfortunate soul that crosses their path. Upon hitting a wall, they will use their many arms to change direction and start rolling the opposite side in an infinite loop.\nThey drop valuable items the first time they are dealt with.\nLocations.\nTwo boulders appear in the game, both in the &lt;a href=\"Catacombs%20of%20Carthus\"&gt;Catacombs of Carthus&lt;/a&gt;:\nStrategy.\nThe only method of stopping these hindrances is by defeating the hooded sorcerer &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt; that control them. Once this has been achieved, the boulder will keep on rolling one last time until it crashes into a wall. If the player is not able to deal with the skeleton fast enough, it will flee to a more secure location.\nThe first boulder appears at the top of the large staircase in the first section of the &lt;a href=\"Catacombs%20of%20Carthus\"&gt;catacombs&lt;/a&gt;, just as the player is heading down. There will be a couple of &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom, ready to receive them should they attempt to outrun the boulder. A safer method is to stand on one of the small square-shaped platforms found along the staircase and let the boulder pass by, doing the same on its return if necessary.\nThe hooded skeleton controlling this boulder can be found inside the corridor at the bottom of the staircase, on an alcove to the right. Once the boulder breaks apart, it will drop an &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Bone%20Shard\"&gt;Undead Bone Shard&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe second boulder appears just before reaching the &lt;a href=\"Catacombs%20of%20Carthus%23Bonfires\"&gt;Catacombs of Carthus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;. The particular sound it produces should warn the player to stop before setting foot on its path. They should let this boulder roll down the nearby staircase and wait until it comes back, then make way to the bottom. A pack of &lt;a href=\"Hound%20Rat\"&gt;Hound Rat&lt;/a&gt;s will be awaiting downstairs, though, so they may opt to wait a little until the rats go their way, but not long enough to be crushed by the boulder on its return.\nThe hooded &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; controlling this boulder can be found overlooking on the second floor, although it will be heavily guarded by three &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Swordsman%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Skeleton Swordsmen&lt;/a&gt;. To reach this area, the player can take the second doorway on the left. However, a safer route can be found by hitting an &lt;a href=\"Illusory%20Wall%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;illusory wall&lt;/a&gt; to the left of this archway, uncovering another path that will provide a more strategic approach.\nOnce this boulder breaks apart, it will drop a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Gem\"&gt;Dark Gem&lt;/a&gt; and also release a &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Crab\"&gt;Lesser Crab&lt;/a&gt;."}

At the beginning of the fight, the player will have to face the three Skeleton Lords: one on the left, one in the middle and one on the right. The Lord on the left carries a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Scythe%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Great Scythe&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord on the right wields the &lt;a href=\"Roaring%20Halberd\"&gt;Roaring Halberd&lt;/a&gt; and the Lord in the middle carries a large and unique bone staff.\nKilling the Lord on the right will cause swordsmen &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt; to spawn, killing the Lord on the left will spawn armored skeletons and killing the Lord in the middle will spawn &lt;a href=\"Bonewheel%20Skeleton%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bonewheel skeletons&lt;/a&gt;. Since all the skeletons share the same health bar, the player is required kill all of them in order to defeat the boss.\nLore.\nThe Skeleton Lords were originally servants of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Iron%20King\"&gt;Old Iron King&lt;/a&gt; and were tasked with hunting and imprisoning the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. However, they were eventually consumed by the very &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;curse&lt;/a&gt; they were trying to contain and abandoned their duties, choosing to create their own kingdom out of the bones of their victims.\nSummoning.\nThere are no characters that can be summoned for this fight in the original version of \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nScholar of the First Sin.\nIn \"\", the player can summon up to two &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;phantoms&lt;/a&gt; for this fight, &lt;a href=\"Bashful%20Ray\"&gt;Bashful Ray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Creighton%20the%20Wanderer\"&gt;Creighton the Wanderer&lt;/a&gt;.\nBashful Ray's summoning sign can be found inside one of the jail huts found between the two &lt;a href=\"Artificial%20Undead\"&gt;Artificial Undead&lt;/a&gt; spawn points. Creighton's summoning sign can be found in the cave inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;necromancers&lt;/a&gt; after exhausting his dialogue.\nDefenses.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense. -50% strike means taking 150% damage.&lt;br&gt;Curse Resist is 50%.\nStrategy.\nUpon entering the room, the player will be in the presence of the three Skeleton Lords that reign over the &lt;a href=\"Huntsman%27s%20Copse\"&gt;Huntsman's Copse&lt;/a&gt;, each one sitting on a throne made of bones. The Lord on the left carries a scythe, the Lord on the right wields a halberd and the Lord in the middle comes armed with a large bone staff. While all three Lords are capable of casting &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;pyromancies&lt;/a&gt;, the scythe- and halberd-wielding ones will focus more on chasing the player, trying to hit them with melee attacks. The one in the middle will usually stay near the center of the room and cast powerful pyromancies throughout the course of the battle. Upon getting into melee range with this Lord, however, he will also try to bash the player with his staff.\nIt's advisable not to kill more than one Lord at a time, since each time one of them dies, a large group of &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt; will emerge in his place. If the player defeats two or all three Lords before taking care of their respective minions, then they would end up having to deal with all groups of skeletons combined, making the fight needlessly difficult.\nAt the beginning of the fight, the three Lords will first have to stand up from their thrones and slowly levitate down until they reach the ground; this will provide enough time to attack one of them repeatedly, usually allowing to defeat him before he even gets a chance to retaliate. The player should focus in attacking either the Lord on the left or the one on the right at first.\nUpon death, the Lord on the left (scythe-wielding) will spawn a large group of normal &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt;, the one on the right (halberd-wielding) will spawn a medium group of armored skeletons and the one in the middle (staff-wielding) will spawn &lt;a href=\"Bonewheel%20Skeleton%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bonewheel skeletons&lt;/a&gt;; since these are harder to dodge, it's better to leave them for last, when there are no other enemies around.\nItems or spells that can distract lesser enemies, such as &lt;a href=\"Alluring%20Skull%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Alluring Skulls&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Yearn\"&gt;Yearn&lt;/a&gt;, are especially effective in this battle as they can be used to both distract and group large numbers of skeletons, allowing the player to attack them with impunity. Weapons that perform wide horizontal swings, such as those from &lt;a href=\"Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;greatswords&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ultra%20Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;ultra greatswords&lt;/a&gt;, are recommended for this fight as they will allow the player to kill many skeletons at once. Also, since all &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;-type enemies have an innate weakness to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, bringing a weapon infused with this element or casting &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;pyromancies&lt;/a&gt; will render this battle much easier.\nThe boss room also counts with four big columns the player can use for protection. Furthermore, the Lords' thrones themselves can be used for this purpose as well, although they will crumble after receiving a hit.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 Skeleton Lord by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlJd7ca2gi0&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

Despite their name, not all the variants actually use swords in combat. There are four versions encountered:\nThe first three variants are equipped with the &lt;a href=\"Carthus%20Milkring\"&gt;Carthus Milkring&lt;/a&gt;, which enables them to become invisible whilst rolling. The twin shotels warriors are much more acrobatic and can also throw waves of throwing knives at the player that inflict &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bleed&lt;/a&gt; buildup.\nStrategy.\nAll Skeleton Swordsmen are very agile opponents; however, they have little &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt; and are very easy to stagger and stunlock. They can also be lured into bottomless pits for easy kills, as they have difficulty adjusting their momentum when rolling. Their attacks do inflict &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt; and they can be deadly if they trap the player, so it is recommended to avoid fighting them in enclosed spaces.\nSkeletons with white glowing eyes will reanimate once defeated after a few seconds. The player should pay attention to whether or not they drop &lt;a href=\"Souls%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; or an item; if they don't, then they will reanimate and they must be defeated a second time."}

His torso is now larger in comparison to the rest of his body and his chest has a large hole in it, exposing and seeming to originate from his &lt;a href=\"Darksign%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;darksign&lt;/a&gt;. The mantle of his armor also increases in size, becoming akin to a cape. His greatsword is now damaged, having lost its tip and part of the fuller, and his shield is nowhere to be seen.\nLore.\nGael was once a slave knight, a category of knights who, as they were Undead, were used as fodder in the bleakest of battles and even if they grew decrepit, their skin charred black, their bones twisted and they went mad were never relived from duty, their stature signified by their &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Knight%20Hood\"&gt;vibrant red hoods&lt;/a&gt;. At one point he managed to free himself from his life of bloody battles and ended up in the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Painted World of Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;, a refuge for the forlorns, unwanted souls who had no place to call home. He eventually met the &lt;a href=\"The%20Painter\"&gt;Painter&lt;/a&gt;, a girl called \"Lady\" by the &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Corvian%20Settler%20%28character%29\"&gt;corvian inhabitants&lt;/a&gt; of the Painted World and who possesses such great knowledge about the First Flame and the Dark Soul that she is able to use them to paint a world, and acted as a parental figure for her, such that she calls him \"Uncle Gael\".\nAt a certain point &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Friede\"&gt;Sister Friede&lt;/a&gt;, an Unkindled who tried to link the First Flame but failed and was reduced to ashes, entered the painted world and discovered a people that she wished to protect, taking on the &lt;a href=\"Crossbreed%20Priscilla\"&gt;form&lt;/a&gt; that its inhabitants yearned for and coming to consider that place as her new home. The inhabitants of the painted world knew that when the time came and their world began to rot they would have to burn it with the Flame and then restore it and bring it back to life, a task entrusted to &lt;a href=\"Father%20Ariandel\"&gt;Father Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;. However, Friede opposed their wish, preferring a slow death in the rot to the changing of the Flame, and convinced Ariandel to hold back the Flame with his blood, while the &lt;a href=\"Corvian%20Knight\"&gt;Corvian Knight&lt;/a&gt;s infatued with her \"protected\" the painting and even killed their own brethren who opposed her. \nWhen the Painter was imprisoned in the library of the corvian village, Gael escaped from the painting, taking with him a rotten scrap of it and began looking for an Unkindled. In fact, in the painted world there was a prophecy telling that when the Ashes would become two, their Flame would return to burn the rot away, and so he needed to find an Ashen One that could kindle it and show it to her lady. After a long unsuccessful search, Gael would find himself in the &lt;a href=\"Cleansing%20Chapel\"&gt;Cleansing Chapel&lt;/a&gt; where he remained praying to &lt;a href=\"Caitha%2C%20Goddess%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Caitha&lt;/a&gt;, mother of the forlorns, so that his wish could be granted by the goddess. Gael finally encountered the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20One\"&gt;Ashen One&lt;/a&gt; during his journey through &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt; and managed to convince them to touch the scrap of painting, sending them to the Painted World of Ariandel through his piece of the painting.\nGael would thus help the Ashen One in his battle against &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Friede\"&gt;Sister Friede and Father Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;, killing them and reigniting the Flame they were keeping contained, finally allowing his lady to see it. The Painter would have resumed painting a new world in the cathedral, like she promised to Gael, but for the cold and gentle place that she had in mind to create, she also needed a special pigment: the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Soul\"&gt;Dark Soul&lt;/a&gt;, the primordial &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Soul\"&gt;Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt; discovered by the &lt;a href=\"Furtive%20Pygmy\"&gt;Furtive Pygmy&lt;/a&gt; and used to create humankind.\nGael's mission was therefore not over and so the knight set off again with a new mission: to find the Dark Soul and bring it back to the Painter so she could complete her painting. He knew that he wasn't as strong as a Champion and that taking the Dark Soul inside himself would likely ruin and consume him, leaving him little hope to return safely, but despite everything, he set out on his endless journey, crossing the centuries through countless battles and hardships. His &lt;a href=\"Executioner%27s%20Greatsword\"&gt;Executioner's Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; remained with him from beginning to end, becoming &lt;a href=\"Gael%27s%20Greatsword\"&gt;heavily chipped and stained with blood&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Repeating%20Crossbow\"&gt;Repeating Crossbow&lt;/a&gt; he customized become rusted with blood, overused, twisted and marred with dents and scratches. Even Gael's own body suffered from the long journey, being consumed by the over-expanded &lt;a href=\"Darksign\"&gt;Darksign&lt;/a&gt; that fused his flesh with his now rusted and cracked armor.\nHis search continued until the end of the world itself, when it was now reduced to an expanse of dust, ash and rubble, but the knight was finally successful, reaching the &lt;a href=\"The%20Ringed%20City%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Ringed City&lt;/a&gt; where the Dark Soul was contained. On the ruins of the city he found the &lt;a href=\"Pygmy%20Kings\"&gt;Pygmy Kings&lt;/a&gt;, holders of the Dark Soul inherited from the &lt;a href=\"Furtive%20Pygmy\"&gt;Primordial Pygmy&lt;/a&gt;, however, their blood had dried long ago over their ages of inaction, therefore making it useless for the painting of his Lady. Determined to complete his mission, Gael slaughtered the Pygmies with his sword before eating and drinking the dried Dark Souls from their bodies, in a desperate attempt to take it for himself and make it strong enough to be useful again. However it would prove too powerful for him, and when the Ashen One finally reunites with Gael at the end of time, he has been fully consumed both physically and mentally by the Dark Soul and demands their portion of it, attacking them in a rage when they refuse. He is finally struck down, allowing the Ashen One to obtain his &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20the%20Dark%20Soul\"&gt;blood filled with the Dark Soul&lt;/a&gt; to use as a pigment for his Lady, thus fulfilling his final duty in death.\nQuestline.\nUpon arrival to the &lt;a href=\"Cleansing%20Chapel\"&gt;Cleansing Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, he will be found beside the altar, but praying instead to another object of reverence. Noticing the player, he will ask if they would show his lady flame. If the player says no, he will ignore their refusal until agreed, playing a cutscene wherein he will produce a fragment of the painting for the player to enter.\nFight overview.\nWhen encountered as a boss, Gael appears monstrous and his moves mirror his beastly nature, he does high amounts of damage and can endure some significant punishment himself. Aside from the damage his moveset has him bounding, and jumping around the players position in a manner that can even force the lock-on function to drop. His attacks are all easy to memorize however, and the only time the player should worry is when Gael rears back, releases a frustrated groan, quickly followed by several powerful strikes. Followed at the end by high leap plunge attack that effects a small area around the blades impact. Key to this battle is his poise, he can be &lt;a href=\"stagger\"&gt;stagger&lt;/a&gt;ed but not &lt;a href=\"Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;riposted&lt;/a&gt;, the player should pay close attention to how many hits it takes to stagger him (usually three with great weapons), and act accordingly, if this weakness exploited correctly he can be stunned out of his hard-hitting combos in the second phase.\nOnce a third of his HP has been depleted he transitions into his second phase and turns hollow (Noted by the fact that the &lt;a href=\"Hollowslayer%20Greatsword\"&gt;Hollowslayer Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; deals more damage to him in his second and third phase), in which he abandons his previously bestial stance in moves in a very human manner. at this point he also gains new moves and starts using his &lt;a href=\"Repeating%20Crossbow\"&gt;Repeating Crossbow&lt;/a&gt;, a special version of the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20White%20Corona\"&gt;Way of White Corona&lt;/a&gt;, and a slow acting teleport sometimes used when the players is at extreme ranges. The crossbow attacks are best avoided unless using a shield with high stability, due to the sheer volume of projectiles. The corona projectiles usually precede his use of the Repeating Crossbow, and will fan out in a large cone in front of his current position. The player should charge Gael as he winds up this attack and dodge past him in order to avoid the coronas launch, and return path. Attacks with his sword are followed by his damaging cape so dodging towards him is recommended to avoid getting hit after finishing a &lt;a href=\"roll\"&gt;roll&lt;/a&gt;. Once two thirds of his HP have been depleted he transitions into his third phase. At the start of this phase, and throughout the rest of the fight, he will stand still momentarily before releasing a number of slow-moving homing projectiles. &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; will begin to strike the arena wherever his projectiles hit the ground, and will be preceded by the lightnings point of contact glowing light blue. The lightning itself does relatively little damage, especially when resistance is calculated, but when paired with Gael's attacks can be devastating. The lightning does very little damage to Gael as well (13-hp at most) so it is not advised to use this as a method to defeat him.\nAt this point Gael will more commonly mix two forms of his attacks, one being a flipping vertical attack that comes down on the player, quickly followed with another identical strike. This will leave him open for several attacks (two with a heavy weapon). It is still possible to stun Gael in this form, but he is able to recover quicker, and in some cases he will instead release another swarm of the slow moving seeker projectiles. After releasing the projectiles Gael will fly off into the air to the players left, and come in for a diving attack. The player should dodge either into the attack or off to its right, as Gaels cloak will usually swipe players dodging to the left or away. If the player needs to escape Gael to cast buffs or heal, there are three sections of wall around the arena that are large enough to get him caught behind in his attack animations to offer such times. Gael does possess the ability to disappear and teleport to the player, though the process is slow, and its wind up after his teleportation is just as slow. The resulting attack does cover a massive radius however, so it is advised to time the dodge correctly. Or run from Gael once it is noticed that he is teleporting to the players position. One such wall is opposite of the players starting position in the second phase of the fight. It has a broken wall that leads down a slope on the other side that is too sharp for Gael to follow. Forcing him to path around the large structure on his own to reach the player.\n3D Model.\nThis integration requires JavaScript.

It is mostly the same as the &lt;a href=\"Smelter%20Demon\"&gt;Smelter Demon&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Keep\"&gt;Iron Keep&lt;/a&gt;, with some visual differences.\nStrategy.\nThe same combat tactics used when fighting the &lt;a href=\"Smelter%20Demon\"&gt;Smelter Demon&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Keep\"&gt;Iron Keep&lt;/a&gt; can also be applied here for the most part; however, the player must be wary of some minor differences. First and foremost, it's highly recommended to wear the best possible &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; resistant wares available in your inventory, and also bring a shield that has a combination of both good physical and magical defenses. Equip the best &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Quartz%20Ring\"&gt;Spell Quartz Ring&lt;/a&gt; at your disposal and apply any other means necessary to resist Magic damage. Also, make sure your selected weapons are not Magic or Lightning based, as he's highly resistant to those elements.\nAs soon as you cross the fog gate, lock-on and run toward the demon to score a couple of free hits. The battle will then progress in a similar way as that from Iron Keep's. Always roll in the direction of his back on his 1~3 combo (not to his side, lest you risk taking damage). The main difference here is that he'll actually often delay his second and/or third attacks, taunting you into rolling early, so the timing used in one of his combos may be very different from the next.\nWhen about 25% of his health has been depleted, he'll build up energy to start dealing Magic damage around him. Be wary of this and keep your distance because, unlike his Iron Keep counterpart, he'll unleash a highly damaging area of effect attack. When about 40% of his health has been depleted, he'll plunge his sword into his chest to imbue it with Magic. This time, however, he won't perform his area of effect attack and you can unleash a full free combo on him (his defense will raise at this moment, though, so you'll end up dealing about half as much damage).\nThis Smelter Demon seems to be much more fierce than the one at Iron Keep, so manage your stamina wisely. Learn when to attack and when to recharge, and most importantly, don't get greedy, just attack him once or twice (depending on the speed of your weapon) per opportunity and retreat. Also, learn when it's the best moment to heal; this is very important, as this particular boss will automatically react when he detects you're healing and will run toward you to stab you with his sword.\nSummoning.\n&lt;a href=\"Steel-willed%20Lorrie\"&gt;Steel-willed Lorrie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Drifter%20Swordsman%20Aidel\"&gt;Drifter Swordsman Aidel&lt;/a&gt; can be summoned for this battle.

However, that doesn't mean the spins are worthless as they have fairly wide reach and decent stagger potential to keep enemies locked in for the final hit. \nOne thing that can help this weapon's usage is that certain enemies do not hit close enough to the ground to damage the player on the ground. Additionally, equipping this weapon in the left hand instead of the right hand so that the spins are clockwise instead of counter-clockwise, which can help in certain areas (such as the cliffside walk in &lt;a href=\"Brume%20Tower\"&gt;Brume Tower&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Fume%20Sorcerer\"&gt;Fume Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; shooting in the distance that has the right-side blocked by a snow wall).

This puts it at a disadvantage against upgradeable armor sets in its weight class; for example, the fully upgraded &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Set\"&gt;Giant Set&lt;/a&gt; is superior in almost every way. However Smough's Set does offer a small but notable amount of &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt; resistance.\nHowever, Smough's set offers the highest lightning and bleed resistance available among the heavy sets, and even when upgrades are accounted for, it is one of the three best heavy sets in all fields except &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"weight\"&gt;weight&lt;/a&gt;, where it is in fourth and fifth place, respectively. Overall, this makes it a solid all-around armor that requires very little investment.\nSmough's Set has the same weight as the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Set\"&gt;Stone Set&lt;/a&gt;, at 45.2 units. However, the Stone Set offers less defense in all regards, except Poise. Smough's Set is also slightly less &lt;a href=\"Durability\"&gt;durable&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrivia.\nAccording to an interview for \"Dark Souls: Design Works\", Smough's Set is one of &lt;a href=\"Hidetaka%20Miyazaki\"&gt;Hidetaka Miyazaki&lt;/a&gt;'s favourite armor designs."}

Unlike other plate metal sets, Smough's Set provides extremely high defense against &lt;a href=\"Strike%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Strike&lt;/a&gt; damage, which is in fact greater than its defense against &lt;a href=\"Regular%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Regular&lt;/a&gt; damage. Rather, its \"weakest\" physical defense is against &lt;a href=\"Thrust%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Thrust&lt;/a&gt; damage, which is still quite high.\nWhile its defense against elemental damage is poor for its weight, even here Smough's Set is extremely resilient. It has no severe weaknesses against any elemental damage type, and in fact resists &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; the most out of all elements, again complementing its resistance to Strike damage. This is backed by all-round resistance to &lt;a href=\"Negative%20Status%20Effects%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt; buildup, which the set has no particular weaknesses against.\nThe set's \"poor\" &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt;-to-weight ratio is largely due to its extreme weight, as the raw amount of Poise it provides is still exceedingly great, beaten only by Havel's Set in this regard. When paired with &lt;a href=\"Smough%27s%20Great%20Hammer\"&gt;Smough's Great Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, there is virtually nothing that the player cannot trade against."}

Unlike the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, which is tied to the souls of the undead, the faded Flame of Chaos was tied to the souls of the demons, and so the lifeless bodies of &lt;a href=\"Capra%20Demon\"&gt;Capra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taurus%20Demon\"&gt;Taurus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Asylum%20Demon\"&gt;Asylum&lt;/a&gt; and a single &lt;a href=\"Centipede%20Demon\"&gt;Centipede Demon&lt;/a&gt; can be found strewn throughout the ruins and piled high near the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Demon%20King\"&gt;Old Demon King&lt;/a&gt;, one of the last remaining demons of old. A petrified arachnoid body, resembling &lt;a href=\"Quelaag%27s%20Sister\"&gt;Quelaag's Sister&lt;/a&gt;, lies within the ruins, where a humanoid corpse holds the &lt;a href=\"Quelana%20Pyromancy%20Tome\"&gt;Quelana Pyromancy Tome&lt;/a&gt;, indicated that the sisters lived here at one point.\nOn the highest ledge above the Smouldering Lake, a colossal triple ballista fires giant bolts at anyone trying to cross the lake. It is fully automated and the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Slave\"&gt;Giant Slave&lt;/a&gt;s that maintained it are long dead. It represents a significant threat; however, it can be used to one's advantage by getting a bolt to hit the unstable floor in the middle of the lake, opening an entrance to the &lt;a href=\"%23Bonfires\"&gt;Old King's Antechamber&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, at the far wall left of the ballista is a crumbling wall which hides the &lt;a href=\"Speckled%20Stoneplate%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Speckled Stoneplate Ring&lt;/a&gt;, and demolishing the wall with a bolt allows access to it.\nAnother entrance to the &lt;a href=\"%23Bonfires\"&gt;Demon Ruins&lt;/a&gt; lies straight ahead from the entrance to the lake, near the chamber of the Old Demon King. However, burrowed into the ground nearby is a &lt;a href=\"Carthus%20Sand%20Worm\"&gt;Carthus Sand Worm&lt;/a&gt;, which will shoot up when someone comes nearby. As bolts from the ballista can also reach this area, it is an extremely dangerous route to take.\nInside the Demon Ruins reside &lt;a href=\"Smouldering%20Ghru\"&gt;Smouldering Ghru&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Cleric\"&gt;Demon Cleric&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Statue\"&gt;Demon Statue&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Hound%20Rat\"&gt;Hound Rat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Hound%20Rat\"&gt;Giant Hound Rat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Basilisk%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Basilisks&lt;/a&gt;, and two &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Black Knights&lt;/a&gt;. To reach the upper reaches of the lake, a long, winding route through the ruins must be taken, with a great number of these enemies along the way.\nIn the deepest part of the ruins, above a pool of deadly lava, there is a ladder leading up to the high ledges above the lake, guarded by a Black Knight. Below, &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Slayer%20Tsorig\"&gt;Knight Slayer Tsorig&lt;/a&gt; can be found. Once emerging on the ledge, a few ballista bolts must be avoided, but the rock formations will prevent most of them from reaching below. A few &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Skeletons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Wheel\"&gt;Skeleton Wheel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Swordsman%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Skeleton Swordsmen&lt;/a&gt; patrol this area. Past them, the ballista is spinning its gears and can be deactivated with a lever, making the lower area of the lake substantially safer to traverse. A series of ledges against the wall can be dropped down to reach the bottom quickly.\nAn unconfirmed, yet possible, theory is that the Smouldering Lake is another section of the &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Lake\"&gt;Ash Lake&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\". This theory is supported by the presence of massive trees, resembling the &lt;a href=\"archtree\"&gt;archtree&lt;/a&gt;s that the ancient &lt;a href=\"dragons\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; once lived in and that the witches of Izalith burned with their &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;pyromancy&lt;/a&gt;. It is also supported by the close proximity the Ash Lake had to the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Ruins\"&gt;Demon Ruins&lt;/a&gt; as well. Looking from a top-down view from &lt;a href=\"Blighttown\"&gt;Blighttown&lt;/a&gt;, one could see that the entrance to the Demon Ruins was right across from the entrance to the Ash Lake; and as both were beneath, then it would seem reasonable that the two areas were in close proximity to each other.\nBonfires.\nThe Smouldering Lake is a subsection of the Catacombs of Carthus and comprises the following &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfires&lt;/a&gt;:"}

Cloud persists for 5 seconds, and the duration cannot be extended by equipping the &lt;a href=\"Lingering%20Dragoncrest%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lingering Dragoncrest Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nUse.\nSingle player.\nSnap Freeze can be useful for inflicting Frostbite on large and slow enemies that are vulnerable to the status effect, particularly certain &lt;a href=\"Boss%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Sulyvahn\"&gt;Pontiff Sulyvahn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Father%20Ariandel\"&gt;Father Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;, or on large groups of enemies where several can be caught in the cloud at once. As it costs less &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt; and has a much shorter duration than &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Weapon\"&gt;Frozen Weapon&lt;/a&gt;, it is ideal for setting the status effect and then taking advantage of the defense reduction on afflicted foes, as opposed to proccing Frostbite for the burst damage, resetting the buildup with &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage and then repeating.\nAs the cloud lingers for a short time, it is possible to inflict frostbite multiple times in one cast of snap freeze. When paired with a way of rapidly inflicting fire damage, such as with &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Surge%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire Surge&lt;/a&gt; or a quick-hitting fire weapon, it's possible to deal large bursts of damage. This can be a difficult tactic to pull off effectively, as it won't work if the enemy exits the cloud, or if they don't give an opening for the player to apply their fire damage.\nOnline gameplay.\nBecause it is a stationary cloud, Snap Freeze is more suited as a defensive sorcery than an offensive one, creating a terrain hazard at will that debuffs enemy players. Laying down a cloud as an invader can dissuade pursuing &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;phantoms&lt;/a&gt; from giving chase, and is particularly useful for blocking off narrow paths such as hallways and bridges to create space. This can open up opportunities for setting up ambushes later down the line, or creating a temporary barrier behind which one can cast offensive sorceries like &lt;a href=\"Great%20Soul%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Great Soul Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, and can even be used creatively to hinder escape routes after an ambush is set.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;tabber&gt;Official translation=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

It possesses a range only slightly less than that of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Bow%20of%20Pharis%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Black Bow of Pharis&lt;/a&gt;, and like the Black Bow its range can be augmented through equipping the &lt;a href=\"Hawk%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Hawk Ring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Bolt%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Sniper Bolts&lt;/a&gt; in order to maximize shot distance and minimize damage falloff.\nLike all other crossbows, the Sniper Crossbow lacks any &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt; in any category. This means that even with only small investments in &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible to inflict respectable damage at long range. When two-handed, the Sniper Crossbow requires only 12 Strength and 16 Dexterity to be operated, meaning that it can be handy on caster builds that cannot afford to invest many points into physical damage stats.\nHowever, the Sniper Crossbow also comes with critical drawbacks. It is tied for being the heaviest crossbow in the game, alongside the &lt;a href=\"Avelyn%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Avelyn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Repeating%20Crossbow\"&gt;Repeating Crossbow&lt;/a&gt;, both of which excel at short ranges rather than long. As well, it has an increased delay before firing a shot, alongside the loading time that all crossbows have, greatly decreasing its firing rate. This second drawback in particular makes it difficult to perform \"snap shots\" with the weapon, as each shot must be further readied in advance before a bolt can be loosed. These factors make the Sniper Crossbow a poor weapon for engaging enemies at lock-on range.\nUpgrades.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

Solaire goes on to defeat Gwyn and link the Flame in his own world, if he survives Lost Izalith with the player's help.\nLore.\nSolaire is a &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Warrior of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; who is determined to find \"his very own sun\". His faith is upstanding and unwavering, and all holy symbols on Solaire's belongings were painted by himself.\nSolaire claims to be an adherent of the &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt;. His incredible prowess is attributed to training and high-quality equipment, and despite the holy symbols on his equipment, neither Solaire nor his possessions are blessed or enchanted. His attempts to find his sun led him through &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blighttown\"&gt;Blighttown&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Giants\"&gt;Tomb of the Giants&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Izalith\"&gt;Lost Izalith&lt;/a&gt;. When he goes to Lost Izalith, Solaire may become parasitised by a &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Maggot\"&gt;Sunlight Maggot&lt;/a&gt;, a creature known to emit a blinding light when worn on the head. When he finds the maggot, Solaire goes insane, claiming the maggot was the sun he was searching for and attacks the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt; on sight.\nThe nature of Solaire's \"very own sun\" remains unclear. During normal gameplay, Solaire will most likely find the Sunlight Maggot and lose his mind due to his desperation. However, if the Chosen Undead prevents him from finding the maggot, Solaire can be summoned for the fight against &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn&lt;/a&gt;. Having reached the &lt;a href=\"Kiln%20of%20the%20First%20Flame\"&gt;Kiln of the First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible that Solaire \"finds his sun\" by &lt;a href=\"Ending\"&gt;linking the fire&lt;/a&gt;. Solaire's legacy is remembered in both &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt;. In Drangleic, the image of a \"hero of yore\" was painted onto the &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Parma\"&gt;Sunlight Parma&lt;/a&gt;, an item given to the &lt;a href=\"Bearer%20of%20the%20Curse\"&gt;Bearer of the Curse&lt;/a&gt; for offering &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Medal%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Sunlight Medals&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Heirs%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;Heirs of the Sun&lt;/a&gt;. Solaire's &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; is also given to the bearer as a reward from the same covenant. At this point, it still exhibits no special properties beyond its high quality. In Lothric, Solaire is remembered as the Knight of Sunlight, and all of his belongings can be found by the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20One\"&gt;Ashen One&lt;/a&gt;. Though most of them still lack special powers, his &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Straight%20Sword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; has been imbued with the power of the sun, and is said to be a relic of a \"one-sided adoration.\" His &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Talisman%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;talisman&lt;/a&gt; also \"fills the user with similar steadfastness\" to Solaire's own, providing a stronger &lt;a href=\"Unfaltering%20Prayer\"&gt;Unfaltering Prayer&lt;/a&gt; than other talismans.\nStrategy.\nAttacking and killing Solaire will make him unavailable for future boss fights. Should the player wish to attack him, Solaire will fight with a sword and shield, and use the &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Spear\"&gt;Lightning Spear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;miracle&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacter information.\nEquipment.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nUndead Burg / Parish=\nDepths=\nAnor Londo / Sunlight Altar=\nDemon Ruins / Lost Izalith / Kiln=\nInsane=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

While both of these spells are fairly cheap they still have far fewer casts than in previous games, and at least in the beginning will have to be heavily supplemented with a weapon. Additionally, their damage is boosted by 12% by the &lt;a href=\"Young%20Dragon%20Ring\"&gt;Young Dragon Ring&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe starting catalyst, the &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer%27s%20Staff%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Sorcerer's Staff&lt;/a&gt;, actually holds up fairly well at high levels of Intelligence even if it is never really the best and won't actually start scaling until the user's Intelligence is at least 19. Its &lt;a href=\"Skill\"&gt;Weapon Art&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Steady%20Chant\"&gt;Steady Chant&lt;/a&gt; will buff the damage of all Sorceries by 10% for 15 seconds, making it a useful thing to use just before fighting a strong enemy such as a boss. \nThe starting &lt;a href=\"Mail%20Breaker%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Mail Breaker&lt;/a&gt; is a pretty weak weapon and is suitable mostly for &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Riposte&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Backstab\"&gt;Backstab&lt;/a&gt;s, especially since the Weapon Art &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Splitter\"&gt;Shield Splitter&lt;/a&gt; is the user's only notable help against shields. \nHaving a &lt;a href=\"Leather%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Leather Shield&lt;/a&gt; probably won't help much with survivability due to it having the poor damage blocking and low &lt;a href=\"Stability\"&gt;Stability&lt;/a&gt; characteristic of a &lt;a href=\"Small%20Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Small Shield&lt;/a&gt;, though it does have the advantage of a Small Shield's improved &lt;a href=\"Parry%20%28skill%29\"&gt;Parry skill&lt;/a&gt;. As such it is best ignored unless planning to use that parry. For those actually wishing to block, the &lt;a href=\"Large%20Leather%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Large Leather Shield&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20Handmaid\"&gt;Shrine Handmaid&lt;/a&gt; can be wielded with one more point in &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; or the even stronger &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Eagle%20Kite%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Silver Eagle Kite Shield&lt;/a&gt; can be found in &lt;a href=\"High%20Wall%20of%20Lothric\"&gt;High Wall of Lothric&lt;/a&gt; and wielded with 4 more Strength. \nWhile the &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Sorcerer's Set&lt;/a&gt; has bad physical defences it has quite good elemental defences and surprisingly high &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt; resistance. \nThose wishing to get a more usable weapon can wield either the &lt;a href=\"Shortsword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Shortsword&lt;/a&gt; with one more point in Strength or the &lt;a href=\"Scimitar%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Scimitar&lt;/a&gt; with one more point in Dexterity, both buyable from the Shrine Handmaid. \nSorcery trainers can be found in &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Undead Settlement&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Road%20of%20Sacrifices\"&gt;Road of Sacrifices&lt;/a&gt; for further development as a spellcaster. Additionally, the &lt;a href=\"Sage%27s%20Coal\"&gt;Sage's Coal&lt;/a&gt; in the nearby &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Keep\"&gt;Farron Keep&lt;/a&gt; allows for the &lt;a href=\"Infusion%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Infusion&lt;/a&gt; of weapons with &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Gem\"&gt;Crystal Gem&lt;/a&gt;s to let them scale of Intelligence.

While pyromancies focus on offensive spells and miracles focus on defensive and &lt;a href=\"healing\"&gt;healing&lt;/a&gt;, sorceries include a variety of utility and augmentation spells as well as a range of offensive spells.\nAll forms of offensive sorceries cause &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Magic Damage&lt;/a&gt;, which is typically effective against iron armor, tough scales, and other physically resilient materials.\nLore.\nSorcery is said to have originated with &lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;Seath the Scaleless&lt;/a&gt;, the \"grandfather of sorcery\". The ancient land of &lt;a href=\"Oolacile\"&gt;Oolacile&lt;/a&gt; has its own sorceries, which are an \"approximation\" when compared to modern Sorcery and are characterized by augmenting the weapon or body, rather than causing offensive damage. &lt;a href=\"Manus%2C%20Father%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Manus, Father of the Abyss&lt;/a&gt; is the source of at least one &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt; sorcery.\nThe other Abyss sorceries are said to be discovered by an Oolacile sorcerer on the brink of madness, they differ from normal offensive sorceries, which are derived from souls, in that they draw power from humanity and cause both &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Physical%20Damage\"&gt;Physical Damage&lt;/a&gt; due to their \"weighty\" nature.\n&lt;a href=\"Big%20Hat%20Logan\"&gt;Big Hat Logan&lt;/a&gt; of the Dragon School in &lt;a href=\"Vinheim\"&gt;Vinheim&lt;/a&gt; played a role in the development of numerous sorceries.

In early times, the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Witch of Izalith&lt;/a&gt; was able to manipulate heat and flame, with a shamanic art called \"flame sorcery\". This ability was taught to her children, but it has unfortunately died with them when the Witch fell to Chaos and &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;Pyromancy&lt;/a&gt; was created, with the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Firesage\"&gt;Demon Firesage&lt;/a&gt; being the last master of the original fire arts. Painted worlds are also known to harness their cold as magic, and &lt;a href=\"frost\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt; sorceries are apparently common to them. Even another kind of sorcery, called moon sorcery and connected to the ancient Darkmoon energy, was practiced by &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Darkmoon\"&gt;his knights&lt;/a&gt;.\n This being said, they are derived from the research of its founder &lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;Seath&lt;/a&gt;, an albino &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; without scales, who sided with the &lt;a href=\"Lords\"&gt;Lords&lt;/a&gt; when they waged their war on dragon-kind. To aid them in killing the semi-mortal beings, Seath pillaged the Primordial Crystal, which granted him true immortality. \nWelcomed warmly into the newly established royalty, Seath became a Duke, and was permitted to keep the Crystal. He retreated into the &lt;a href=\"The%20Duke%27s%20Archives\"&gt;Archives&lt;/a&gt;, the library castle granted to him along with dukedom, to research the nature of his treasure and discover some other way to achieve immortality without scales. In his research, which drove him at least partially blind\u00a0and mad, he developed powerful arts using the energy extracted from the crystal. This would inspire the crystal sorceries.\n Despite his madness and the people he experimented on, Seath's work inspired many scholars, who derived soul sorceries from his study of souls.\u00a0Rather he continued searching for immortality, and eventually succeeded in connecting the Primordial Crystal with his own life force, becoming a \"true undead\" in that he could not be killed.\nSoon schools like &lt;a href=\"Vinheim\"&gt;Vinheim&lt;/a&gt;'s Dragon School were established, expanding on the work of Seath, and developing new sorceries, from clever sound manipulation, to the generation of powerful blasts of soul energy, often called magic. Meanwhile, in the land of &lt;a href=\"Oolacile\"&gt;Oolacile&lt;/a&gt;, their xanthous scholars developed sorceries that manipulated light energy, known as golden sorceries. During the disaster that consumed Oolacile in the &lt;a href=\"Chasm%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt;, some of the scholars were driven mad by &lt;a href=\"the%20Dark\"&gt;the Dark&lt;/a&gt; and realized the nature of &lt;a href=\"Humanity%20%28item%29\"&gt;humanity&lt;/a&gt;, developing the first dark sorceries seen in modern times.\n At some point, the famous sorcerer \"Big Hat\" &lt;a href=\"Big%20Hat%20Logan\"&gt;Logan&lt;/a&gt; left the Dragon School, and came across the Archives, where he studied the innovations of Seath. Though his starting attempts were imitations and not as powerful, and sometimes seemed close to the Dark, he eventually succeeded in creating crystal medium to facilitate a stronger bond between souls and sorceries, honing it into piercing solid energy, which would become the world's first crystal sorceries. He even create a imitation spell of Seath's curse-laced crystalline White Dragon Breath, although the mental strain of developing such magic dislodged Logan's anchor for reason, driving him mad like his predecessor.\nTwo schools would evolve from the fundamental work of Logan. One was located within the court of the &lt;a href=\"Profaned%20Capital\"&gt;Profaned Capital&lt;/a&gt;, whose sorcerers also functioned as oracles, and emulated Logan using &lt;a href=\"Court%20Sorcerer%27s%20Staff\"&gt;copies of his staff&lt;/a&gt;. They also, through means unknown, recovered &lt;a href=\"Logan%27s%20Scroll\"&gt;a scroll written by Logan himself&lt;/a&gt;, containing the sorceries he made in his early days before gaining access to the Archives, and used it to assert themselves as heirs to the sorcerer. This school did not last long, as a certain oracle's &lt;a href=\"Monstrosity%20of%20Sin\"&gt;relatives&lt;/a&gt; triggered a curse called the Profaned Flame, which mutated the sorcerers responsible and burning the capital to the ground.\n While the oracles were somewhat unscrupulous in their claim, one other school made good on that very same assertion. This school was started by two preacher twins, who were said to be Logan's true spiritual successors, so that they were known to others as the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Sage\"&gt;Crystal Sage&lt;/a&gt;s. They were masters of the crystal magic, and eventually served as spiritual guides for the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives%20Scholar\"&gt;sorcerer scholars&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt; in the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt;. In a pact of uncertain terms, one of the twins traveled to &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Keep\"&gt;Farron&lt;/a&gt; and taught sorceries to the acolytes of the &lt;a href=\"Abyss%20Watchers\"&gt;Undead Legion&lt;/a&gt;, developed as simplifications to slower, less agile spells, due to the Legion's emphasis on speed over power.\nWhile this happened the other twin stayed with the scholars of Lothric, and like their predecessor - and the \"Paledrake\" Seath that they honored religiously - they came across &lt;a href=\"Clawed%20Curse\"&gt;destructive knowledge that threatened to pull away their reason&lt;/a&gt;, often causing the reader to &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;suddenly die and crystallize their soul&lt;/a&gt;. Those scholars would cake themselves in an \"ivory wax\" that protected themselves from this danger. Eventually both twins would go mad, just as Logan and Seath did, and the king of Lothric, &lt;a href=\"Oceiros\"&gt;Oceiros&lt;/a&gt;, would task the scholars with assisting him with creating the perfect heir. His search for Seath's moonlight not only drove him mad like the other scholars preceding him, but it turned him into an abomination somewhat similar in biology and magical nature to Seath, and he was dethroned and kept in the &lt;a href=\"Consumed%20King%27s%20Garden\"&gt;palace garden&lt;/a&gt;, coddling his &lt;a href=\"Ocelotte\"&gt;nonexistent son&lt;/a&gt;, protecting his life with his own.\nGeneral information.\nSorceries are a discipline tied to logic, and for this reason, one must be intelligent enough to cast them. With more intellectual development, one can increase the power of their sorcery. Most sorceries are channeled through a &lt;a href=\"catalyst\"&gt;catalyst&lt;/a&gt;, so named for its ability to quickly direct magic, and some also have natural sorcery altering properties. While the most common catalysts are some form of staff, there are other tools that can act as a catalyst for casting sorceries.\nIn the three games, most sorceries focus on dealing magic elemental\u00a0damage in some form, such as simple arrows to torrential blasts of soul energy. Others provide augmentations to equipment and to oneself, to make combat easier, or simply avoid combat altogether. Sorceries which provide that function mentioned last are usually golden.\nVariations.\nMost of the modern day sorceries are derived from the soul, and the soul they come from is essential to what kind of sorcery it will be classified as. Common sorceries, such as those taught by the Dragon School, are mainly drawn from the manipulation of common souls. Through a complex process of crystallization, this energy can be honed further and become solid magic with properties of both magic and solid items, at which point they are crystal sorceries. While trying to replicate the magic of Seath into an art usable by &lt;a href=\"humans\"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;, Logan developed powerful sorceries unique in their strength and nature, but their homing properties are more closely related to the Dark than to the crystal magic of Seath.\nIn Oolacile, the sorceries were designed to manipulate light, and have functions that none have been able to fully replicate. While sorcery has both offensive and defensive applications, golden sorceries are utilized to completely avoid dangerous situations, whether by lighting the path, concealing oneself as some inconspicuous item, or negating the physicality of magical energies to dispel harmful spells or slow them down. Whether they all happened to be designed like this, or if light is naturally passive like this, is not made certain.\n Some magics are derived from humanity, which is fragmented from a soul, and dark sorceries can be made. Magic of this type are both magical and physical, striking targets with weighty force, and having a natural harmfulness to living things. It is thought that the Dark is highly responsive to emotion, and is drawn towards emotional beings, which allows such magic to tenaciously pursue living things. Just as those who love and hate are undauntingly drawn to the object that they love or hate, humans are able to give this emotion to a portion of their disembodied humanity, which will follow that directive and cause harmful raw Dark to give chase to a target.\n Three forgotten sorceries exist as well. Frost sorceries manipulate the cold of Painted Worlds, and seem to be well known to the sorcerers who inhabit a painted world, where they imbue their weapons with it. They are unfortunately developed only in the painted worlds, and those who have not experienced any true loss, such as those born there naturally, do not share the affinity to the cold as others do, and almost never use them after exiting a painted world. For example, the frost sorcerer &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Sulyvahn\"&gt;Sulyvahn&lt;/a&gt; forsook some of his arts when he left the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Painted World of Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;, but used others to enchant the weapons of &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll&lt;/a&gt; and coat &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; in the unnatural winter climate.\nThe other, truly lost art is flame sorcery, founded by the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Witch of Izalith&lt;/a&gt;. With her family dead or mutated, the daughter &lt;a href=\"Quelana%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Quelana&lt;/a&gt; developed a flame manipulation art that she taught to a &lt;a href=\"Salaman%20the%20Master%20Pyromancer\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the inventor of &lt;a href=\"pyromancy\"&gt;pyromancy&lt;/a&gt; and leaving behind a lasting legacy for ages to come.\nLast is an art called moon sorcery, practiced by Gwyndolin, the god of the Darkmoon. How this art works is not explained, but it allowed Gwyndolin to launch blasts of light blue energy, and is a matter of faith."}

To avert this issue without using a &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20Ascetic\"&gt;Bonfire Ascetic&lt;/a&gt;, joining the &lt;a href=\"Company%20of%20Champions\"&gt;Company of Champions&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Covenants%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Covenant&lt;/a&gt; will make all enemies, including those that have been despawned due to being killed several times but excluding those that never respawn, respawn until the covenant is abandoned.\nIf a player decides to farm souls, there are a few areas that can make this easier for them.\nSoul boosting equipment.\nThere are some armor pieces that will increase the amount of souls gained from killing enemies.These include:\nThe maximum increase to souls gained is 57.5%, which is reached by wearing the Covetous Silver Serpent Ring +2, the Nahr Alma Robes, the Tseldora Trousers, the Jester's Gloves or Tseldora Manchettes, and any of the listed head armors.\nIron Keep.\nThe area past the &lt;a href=\"Ironhearth%20Hall\"&gt;Ironhearth Hall&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt; is well suited for gaining a high number of souls in a short run. It will provide about 11,000 souls, if no soul boosting equipment is worn, and about 30,000 with a Covetous Silver Serpent Ring +1 and the Tseldora Cap, Robes, and Leggings, with Jester's Gloves.\nThis run can also net the player a good supply of &lt;a href=\"Large%20Titanite%20Shard%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Large Titanite Shards&lt;/a&gt;, so one might consider boosting their drop rate, as well.\nStraid's Cell.\nThere are five &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Citizen\"&gt;Undead Citizens&lt;/a&gt; immediately outside the Straid's Cell &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Bastille\"&gt;Lost Bastille&lt;/a&gt;. They are almost completely nonhostile and have low HP, and so are very simply to kill in one hit. On NG, one cycle will earn 1,300 souls in about 20 seconds. Early-game players can easily get the Covetous Silver Serpent Ring +1 from &lt;a href=\"Merchant%20Hag%20Melentia\"&gt;Melentia&lt;/a&gt; this way, increasing the rate to 1,560 souls in 20 seconds. A thrusting weapon or similar is recommended to avoid accidentally hitting Straid.\nThis is also an excellent place to farm Soul Memory in New Game Plus for players interested in passing the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Winter\"&gt;Shrine of Winter&lt;/a&gt; without lighting the four Primal Bonfires. On NG+1, one cycle will drop 2,600 souls, which can be increased to about 3,800-4,200 with full soul-boosting gear. While tedious, this process should only take a few hours, which may be significantly less time overall than the time it takes to clear the minimum 11 bosses (and likely more) to light the four Primal Bonfires.\nThe Old Chaos.\nIf the player has not yet defeated the &lt;a href=\"Burnt%20Ivory%20King\"&gt;Burnt Ivory King&lt;/a&gt;, they can farm the &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Loyce%20Knight\"&gt;Charred Loyce Knight&lt;/a&gt;s that spawn from the gates. Each Knight will drop a minimum of 2,400 souls, and they will respawn indefinitely as long the Ivory King is alive. By simply not attacking the Ivory King, the Knights can be farmed with relative ease. However, the Knights may eventually stop spawning. At this point, the player can simply leave the fight by any means to reset it.\nBy recruiting a single &lt;a href=\"Knight%20of%20Eleum%20Loyce\"&gt;Loyce Knight&lt;/a&gt;, this method will become far easier. The Knights will not only help the player with fighting the Charred Knights, but each Knight will eventually freeze one of the gates, closing it for the remainder of the battle. By limiting the number of Knights to two, only one Charred Knight will spawn at a time, which drastically lowers the danger of the fight.\nBy using the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20the%20Old%20Iron%20King%20%28helm%29\"&gt;Crown of the Old Iron King&lt;/a&gt;, the player may use any Spells for free, for an indefinite amount of time. Spells like &lt;a href=\"Repair%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Repair&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Great%20Heal%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Great Heal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Denial\"&gt;Denial&lt;/a&gt; can prove invaluable to sustain the player.\nThis method is also the most efficient way to farm &lt;a href=\"Loyce%20Soul\"&gt;Loyce Soul&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Loyce%20Knight%23Drops\"&gt;Charred Loyce gear&lt;/a&gt;. It also doesn't require the use of Bonfire Ascetics or the Company of Champions."}

Its weapon of choice is the &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Greatsword\"&gt;Firelink Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;, a massive version of the &lt;a href=\"Coiled%20Sword\"&gt;Coiled Sword&lt;/a&gt; that can change its shape to suit its wielder's needs. It changes attack moves very smoothly, making it hard for players to counterattack it. The different fighting tactics make for a very memorable boss fight.\nWhen the player first enters the arena, the Soul of Cinder will be sitting at the middle of the area, its sword planted before him in a semblance of a &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;. After a moment, it pulls its sword out of the ground and engages the player.\nLocation.\n&lt;a href=\"Kiln%20of%20the%20First%20Flame%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Kiln of the First Flame&lt;/a&gt;\nLore.\nThe Soul of Cinder is the deific manifestation of the souls of all those who have linked themselves to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; through history, becoming &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lords of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;, and thus is an entity possessing all the abilities of the previous Champions despite just being an empty husk.\nIt exists as the Flame's last defense inside its &lt;a href=\"Kiln%20of%20the%20First%20Flame%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Kiln&lt;/a&gt;, protecting it from anyone attempting to link it again and acting as the ultimate test of their strength - a role that it has enacted for a very long time, confronting all who entered the Kiln as aspiring Lords\nWhen tested by an aspiring Champion, the Soul of Cinder would even bring out the remnants of the will and power of the first one to ever link the First Flame: &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord Gwyn&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nFight Overview.\nThe Soul of Cinder boss fight consists of two main phases:\nPhase 1.\nSoul of Cinder can use four different weapon stances, each utilizing different skills and attacks based on a magic type in the game (excluding hexes).\nPhase 2.\nThe Soul of Cinder's second phase begins once the first phase's health bar has been depleted. After restoring its health to full in a damaging explosion of fire, he will abandon its previous moveset (reverting his sword to its default form if necessary) in favor of a moveset very similar to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;'s moveset\u00a0from \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\", with the exception of a few new attacks. The Soul of Cinder will increase in speed and damage at this point. One of its new attacks involves three unique uses of the &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Sunlight Spear&lt;/a&gt; miracle; the first being a standard Sunlight Spear hurled forward, and the second being a Sunlight Spear that is thrown upward into the air. After a brief period, a cloud will form in the sky, an audible thunderclap is heard and shower of homing Sunlight Spears will rain down upon the player from the cloud, dealing massive damage, similar to &lt;a href=\"Splintering%20Lightning%20Spear\"&gt;Splintering Lightning Spear&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\". You can see the cloud if you run away from Soul of Cinder and look upward above it. The final attack is where the Soul of Cinder throws a Sunlight Spear into the ground, causing a small, ground-based &lt;a href=\"area-of-effect\"&gt;area-of-effect&lt;/a&gt; of heavy &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage on impact, similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Stake\"&gt;Lightning Stake&lt;/a&gt; miracle.\nIts sword attacks are identical to Gwyn's and can be dodged in a similar manner. However, the Soul of Cinder will have a new, fast combo that, if caught up in, will juggle the player in the air. The last attack of this combo is a stab into the ground that causes a large, fiery explosion that encompasses a very large area around him. The combo attacks have a fire projectile that will damage the player at range, so it is advised to &lt;a href=\"roll\"&gt;roll&lt;/a&gt; through each attack carefully and keep away as the chain progresses further. It's one of the most powerful attacks in the series, almost completely depleting a player's health if caught and unblocked.\nStrategy.\nIt is advised to finish the first phase quickly to conserve &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Estus&lt;/a&gt; for the second phase. This can be done by aiming to &lt;a href=\"stagger\"&gt;stagger&lt;/a&gt; the boss; by pressuring him and attacking constantly while avoiding its attacks, when it staggers there will be a brief window for a fully-charged strong attack. The boss won't stagger if the player gives it breathing room where its &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt; meter will fill up. However, beware that this strategy is difficult to pull off when the Soul of Cinder uses its Scimitar moveset, because he will start attacking in quick succession. Attacks with heavier weapons like &lt;a href=\"Greataxes%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Greataxes&lt;/a&gt; can stagger the boss within two to three repeated hits, in some cases with the weapon being wielded in one hand alone.\nDuring the second phase, it is best to maintain distance from the boss and try to bait out its jump attack, which is easily avoidable and leaves it open for a hit or two. It is dangerous to keep close to the boss as it might lead to depleting stamina and/or getting caught in his grab or five-hit combo. If caught by the grab, the boss will receive an attack and defense boost for a short duration.\nThe Soul of Cinder is weak to &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;sorceries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage and susceptible to &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; damage. However, it is slightly-resistant to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; attacks, so &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;pyromancies&lt;/a&gt; or fire damage will be less effective, especially in the second phase.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 3 \u2014 Soul of Cinder by Yuka Kitamura\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFnTP7va1lo&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

Like most other &lt;a href=\"Thrust%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;thrusting&lt;/a&gt; weapons, players can attack enemies with this spear from behind their &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;, allowing for a safer approach in narrow spaces. Players should be cautious on attacking in this fashion for prolonged conflicts, as more &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; is consumed than usual with each attack (as well as the reduced stamina regeneration when one is blocking), which could make one more prone to having their &lt;a href=\"guard%20broken\"&gt;guard broken&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnusual for a weapon of this &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Types%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;, it does not only thrust damage, but &lt;a href=\"Strike%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;strike&lt;/a&gt; damage with its first strong attack (1-handed and 2-handed), making it a very versatile spear. This is especially useful in the earlier parts of the game, as most enemies, especially &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ironclad%20Soldier\"&gt;heavily-armored&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Pursuer\"&gt;ones&lt;/a&gt;, are vulnerable to strike damage.\nHowever, the main drawback of the Spear is its incredibly-fast &lt;a href=\"degradation\"&gt;degradation&lt;/a&gt; in combat, especially if one is fighting armored foes, making it paramount for one to watch the durability of the weapon to ensure it does not break prior to reaching a bonfire. Having &lt;a href=\"Repair%20Powder%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;repair powder&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Repair%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;other means&lt;/a&gt; of repairing equipment or &lt;a href=\"Bracing%20Knuckle%20Ring\"&gt;preserving&lt;/a&gt; durability, can help mitigate this."}

This coupled with its low &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; usage, compared to other spears, makes it an excellent early-game weapon. The low stamina usage also lets it excel when attacking from behind a &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;, as the saved stamina can instead be used to maintain one's guard. Furthermore, it also means the Spear has the potential to kill enemies in fewer combos than heavier spears.\nThese strengths come at the cost of the spear being considerably shorter than other spears found near the start of the game. It also has a less versatile &lt;a href=\"moveset\"&gt;moveset&lt;/a&gt; than the &lt;a href=\"Partizan%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Partizan&lt;/a&gt;.\nContrary to what its low weight, stamina usage, and requirements may imply, the Spear's damage is similar to that of other early spears, its primary drawback being its low reach.\nUpgrades.\nReinforced with standard &lt;a href=\"Titanite%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Titanite&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrivia.\nThe red tassel at the end of the spear's shaft exhibits cloth physics, similar to capes and robes. It also receives the same singed effect as armor when the wielder is a &lt;a href=\"Host%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Host of Embers&lt;/a&gt;."}

The extra range that spears provide often allows wielders to attack foes before they are within range with their own weapons; in exchange, spears deal unremarkable damage and have poor &lt;a href=\"stagger\"&gt;stagger&lt;/a&gt; capabilities. Like &lt;a href=\"Thrusting%20Swords\"&gt;Thrusting Swords&lt;/a&gt;, spears have a very small and narrow hit radius, making them difficult to use against fast-moving opponents unless when used in a confined area. Another shared trait with the thrusting swords are the spears' ability to attack while simultaneously guarding with a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;. For their range and strength, Spears are also very fast, so they can be effective for interrupting enemy attacks. Given their strong defensive capabilities but poor damage, spears are a slow, but relatively safe, choice when it comes to taking down enemies. Spears do not do well against a shield. They glance off the shield and do not stagger shielded enemies as easily as other weapon attack types.\nSpears.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nDetailed=\nCondensed=\nUpgraded=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Its Weapon Art, &lt;a href=\"Spin%20Slash%20%28Twinblades%29\"&gt;Spin Slash&lt;/a&gt;, isn't strong in and of itself but has two strong advantages in that it is unparriable and that a light attack or a block/dual attack combos directly into the Spin Slash and its heavy attack follow up, allowing a devastating combo against lightly armored foes. The &lt;a href=\"Wooden%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Wooden Shield&lt;/a&gt;, however, has fallen quite far since its glory days in the previous games due to its poor physical blocking and is mostly only useful for parrying. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Sellsword%20Set\"&gt;Sellsword Set&lt;/a&gt; it wears is decent, having good defences for its weight and being fairly light but has mediocre &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;, though since the class is unlikely to be used for a build using a &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt;-supported weapon (except for maybe the &lt;a href=\"Astora%20Greatsword\"&gt;Astora Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;) this might not be relevant. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Uchigatana%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Uchigatana&lt;/a&gt; is another strong weapon suitable for this class, and is obtainable early on if a slower Dexterity-based weapon is desired.

Pate is encountered in several locations throughout &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; and he will lend his hand to the player in many ways, such as offering his assistance for fighting one of the bosses or pointing the way toward various treasures, not before warning the player, telling them that they will have to overcome several traps ahead if they attempt to get the treasure.\nAlthough at first sight Pate looks like someone who can be trusted, it is revealed later in the game that he may have a sinister side as well. His former partner in crime, &lt;a href=\"Creighton%20of%20Mirrah\"&gt;Creighton of Mirrah&lt;/a&gt;, claims that Pate is a deceiving and greedy man, as well as an expert manipulator who uses his charming behavior to trick other people. It is also implied that Pate, like Creighton, is another psychopath. He is believed to murder other people in order to get all the loot for himself. It is unknown, however, why he decides to help the Bearer of the Curse every time they meet, although it could be implied that Pate acts this way in order to gain the player's trust, so that they can side with him in his final confrontation against Creighton. Creighton's description also more closely matches himself than Pate, as Pate may be generally friendly but not particularly charismatic while Creighton tries to flatter the Bearer of the Curse and frequently acts paranoid and suspicious. This is also supported should either of them survive without the player's intervention - Pate will simply question what happened with astonishment while Creighton will assume the player not interfering was because they were friends with Pate and tell them to leave in a threatening manner, as well as demanding the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Thorns\"&gt;Ring of Thorns&lt;/a&gt; should the player have killed Pate earlier and equipped it. However, despite this, both characters' true intents are still somewhat ambiguous, leaving the player to decide who if either to trust.\nLore.\nLittle is known about Pate's past. It is known that, at some point in his life, he met the serial killer Creighton of &lt;a href=\"Mirrah\"&gt;Mirrah&lt;/a&gt;, and decided to join forces with him during their journey through Drangleic.\nHowever, Pate and Creighton had a dispute over some treasure which ended up in both men trying to kill each other. In the end, Pate managed to lock Creighton away in one of the cells of &lt;a href=\"Huntsman%27s%20Copse\"&gt;Huntsman's Copse&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(although it is later revealed that the cell itself was originally a trap devised by Creighton to lock Pate away).\nPlot.\nMild-Mannered Pate is encountered for the first time in the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20of%20Fallen%20Giants\"&gt;Forest of Fallen Giants&lt;/a&gt;. Upon talking to him, he reveals to the player that he has come to Drangleic\u00a0on a treasure hunt, and he warns them about a group of bandits who are preying on travelers in the area. Exhausting his dialogue after exploring the area through the gate behind him will result in Pate rewarding the player with the &lt;a href=\"White%20Sign%20Soapstone%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;White Sign Soapstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nPate can be summoned as a white phantom for the fight against &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Giant\"&gt;The Last Giant&lt;/a&gt; following this encounter. His summon sign can be found just outside the fog gate.\nPate is revealed to have a more sinister side after the player finds his believed-to-be partner, Creighton of Mirrah.\u00a0Creighton claims that Pate is always running in and stealing the treasure, even though Pate claims the opposite. Pate says that his partner fell into a trap, which is later discovered that Creighton designed this trap to keep Pate incapacitated. In an unfortunate turn of events, Creighton traps himself, and is later released by the player. Creighton vows revenge on Pate.\nPate reappears in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Peak\"&gt;Earthen Peak&lt;/a&gt;. He is found in a room filled with poisonous pots. If he was summoned for The Last Giant and lived through the fight, he will give the player Pate's Armor Set, as well as his shield, spear, and the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Thorns\"&gt;Ring of Thorns&lt;/a&gt;. Pate will tell the Bearer of the Curse that there is another treasure beyond another trap. Upon getting the treasure, he warns you of who to trust, makes a remark saying \"I heard that a man is out for my life...The poor bloke must have quite an imagination, heh.\" (exact quote). This is referring to Creighton of Mirrah, the Wanderer you find at the third Huntsman's Copse &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;. If you collect the treasure before encountering Pate in Earthen Peak, he will still appear in the Brightstone Cove after you've exhausted his dialogue.\nHe then appears in &lt;a href=\"Brightstone%20Cove%20Tseldora\"&gt;Brightstone Cove Tseldora&lt;/a&gt; across the gap from the &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20Threshold\"&gt;Chapel Threshold&lt;/a&gt; bonfire where you find him in a fight against Creighton, both he and Creighton are target-able and once one dies the other becomes non-hostile. The player may choose to help either one. The &lt;a href=\"Tseldora%20Den%20Key\"&gt;Tseldora Den Key&lt;/a&gt; will be obtained from the survivor of the fight given that the player has dealt enough damage to the other; in that case the survivor will also attempt to kill the player with a booby-trapped chest. &lt;a href=\"Creighton%27s%20Set\"&gt;Creighton's armor set&lt;/a&gt; will be obtained from Creighton only in the case that you help him defeat Pate. If the player assists neither and lets them fight to the &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, the survivor will not give the player the Tseldora Den Key and it will become unobtainable.\nCharacter information.\nEquipment"}

They were women who have little concept of self and refer to themselves as a single entity. Nito taught them to sing a special song, making them enchanting singers with the task of comforting the Undead. They live only to sing and will continue to do so until they can do so no longer.\nAfter an immense amount of time after Nito's death due to a &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt;, the Milfanito and the Fenito continued to serve their purpose and and carrying out the will of the \"Great Dead One\", arriving in &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; where they positioned themselves to manage the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Crypt\"&gt;Undead Crypt&lt;/a&gt;, a place of rest for the \"living\" where those afflicted by the curse of Undeath could only pray to one day gain entrance. The Milfanitos would thus have continued to sing to appease the spirits of the dead buried in the crypt.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Amana\"&gt;Shrine of the Living&lt;/a&gt;, where there is a Milfanito, there is an artifact capable of reverse the &lt;a href=\"Hollowing\"&gt;Hollowing&lt;/a&gt; of the Undead while the Milfanito who was imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Castle\"&gt;Drangleic Castle&lt;/a&gt; possesses a &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Ring of the Dead&lt;/a&gt; that is able to make the wearer appear human even when Hollow implying that the Milfanito had developed or had to manage artifacts capable of dealing with condition of the Hollows.\nPlot.\nThe Milfanito are incredibly secluded maidens who reside within the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Amana\"&gt;Shrine of Amana&lt;/a&gt; and sing to comfort those that carry death and dark within themselves. They seem to have very little individuality and more so refer to themselves as a single entity. When they sing, \"the little ones dance\", referring to the &lt;a href=\"Brightbug\"&gt;Brightbug&lt;/a&gt;s scattered around the area. They constantly say that they know nothing about the outside world but have no desire to leave. However, they possess &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Blessing%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Divine Blessings&lt;/a&gt;, although they don't know what they are.

When freed, she will sigh and disappear, dropping the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Ring of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;. A brief singing can be heard while on the elevator leading back to the lower floor. Talking to each of the other two Milfanito afterward will reward the player with one &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Blessing%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Divine Blessing&lt;/a&gt;.

Having found the divine place, the tribe decided to settle in the area, developing a crude culture that placed at its core the sacred oak, an animist religion different from the ancient gods of Anor Londo typical of most humans in the rest of the world. Their &lt;a href=\"Millwood%20Knight%20Set\"&gt;charbronze armor&lt;/a&gt; was adorned with the symbol of the Ethereal Oak while their &lt;a href=\"Millwood%20Knight%20Helm\"&gt;helmets&lt;/a&gt; with the antlers of the blessed beasts of the tree. Their &lt;a href=\"Millwood%20Battle%20Axe\"&gt;battle axes&lt;/a&gt; were also decorated in a similar way and their &lt;a href=\"Ethereal%20Oak%20Shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; decorated with the symbol of the sacred oak symbol was able to regenerate their health.\nThe chieftains of the Milwood knights were also their high priests using their &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Seeker\"&gt;bronze axes&lt;/a&gt; as ceremonial artifacts for religious rituals and, thrusting them into the earth with a prayer, were able to cause a severe earthquake with tremors resembing an explosion. In fact, their faith also included the worship of the earth and their most ancient weapons, &lt;a href=\"Quakestone%20Hammer\"&gt;hammers&lt;/a&gt; with heads of natural stone, were a symbol of their fighting together with the earth itself, as they used them to upheave earth and cause shockwaves that rumbled like a warcry. The culture of Millwood's inhabitants continued to place great importance on their sacred tree that blessed their land and as a result remained a society centered on their knights, tasked with the protection of the Ethereal Oak.\nAt one point Millwood was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Darkeater%20Midir\"&gt;Midir&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient dragon corrupted by the Abyss. The creature's goal, however, was seemingly not to destroy the land and its inhabitants as it only targeted the Ethereal Tree, trying to use its divine powers to cure itself of the harmful effects of the Abyss permeating its body. The people of Millwood managed to survive the first attack but nevertheless did not tolerate the attack on their sacred tree. The knights adapted to the threat despite being warriors of the earth, crafting enormous &lt;a href=\"Millwood%20Greatbow\"&gt;bows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Millwood%20Greatarrow\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; designed to repel Midir, who became their sworn enemy, in raid after raid.\nDue to the continuous use of the Etheral Oak to heal itself, Midir ended up corrupting it and left it to rot consequently leading to the collapse of the Millwood culture which revolved around the sacred tree in every aspect. As the people of Millwood had lost their reason to exist as a society along with their home, they became forlorns and, leaving their belongings, everyone simply left, drifting aimlessly for so long that they even forgot about their bitter enemy. At some point, a group of &lt;a href=\"Millwood%20Knight\"&gt;Millwood Knight&lt;/a&gt;s led by a &lt;a href=\"Captain%27s%20Ashes\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; who kept a branch of the Etheral Oak with him were eventually drawn into the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Painted World of Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;, where they were welcomed by the other lost souls and found refuge. Here the remnants of Millwood society managed to rebuild a tenuous home, taming the &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; of the Painted World and patrolling the areas around their fortress, somehow maintaining the culture of their past in the form of their artifacts. \nLong after the inhabitants of Millwood abandoned their land, the fabled forest was discovered by foreign explorers. The only thing left were the still rotting Ethereal Oak and the vacant ruins of their homes, as no corpses were discovered and the belongings of the people laid neatly on the ground."}

The axe is located on an isolated platform at the top that must be jumped or dropped down onto.\nCharacteristics.\nDespite its modest appearance, the Millwood Battle Axe is one of hardest-hitting &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; in the game for its small size. Its very high base damage and weapon &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; allow the axe to easily outclass even &lt;a href=\"Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;greatswords&lt;/a&gt; in terms of damage. It also gains an A &lt;a href=\"Scaling%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; with a heavy &lt;a href=\"Infusion%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;infusion&lt;/a&gt; and sufficient upgrades. This, combined with its very low &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; requirement, makes it a highly effective weapon for Strength-focused builds. However, being an axe means that it suffers from the usual drawbacks of its class, such as low reach, relatively slow attacks, and an awkward &lt;a href=\"Movesets%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;moveset&lt;/a&gt; in tight corridors.\nThe axe uses a unique variant of &lt;a href=\"Warcry\"&gt;Warcry&lt;/a&gt;. Upon activation, the player sprints forward, leaps, and lands with a roar, &lt;a href=\"stun\"&gt;stun&lt;/a&gt;ning enemies in range.

As such, they should primarily be used to inflict damage on targets rather than attempting to displace them.\nBecause of the slow drawing nature of greatbows, it is ideal to equip the &lt;a href=\"Hawk%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Hawk Ring&lt;/a&gt;, fire the arrows from an &lt;a href=\"Onislayer%20Greatbow\"&gt;Onislayer Greatbow&lt;/a&gt; or fire the arrow using the &lt;a href=\"Puncturing%20Arrow\"&gt;Puncturing Arrow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;, in order to counter the reduced effective range of the greatarrows."}

The greatbow can be found on a corpse in the area, alongside five &lt;a href=\"Millwood%20Greatarrow\"&gt;Millwood Greatarrow&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCharacteristics.\nOne of the most effective ranged weapons in the game, the Millwood Greatbow can bring ruin and destruction upon any target it aims at.\nIts &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt; leans heavily towards &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, making it more oriented towards builds that wield ultra weapons, as opposed to the quality &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Greatbow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dragonslayer Greatbow&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;-favoring &lt;a href=\"Onislayer%20Greatbow\"&gt;Onislayer Greatbow&lt;/a&gt;. As well, its base damage is the highest among all greatbows, and as such its shots are capable of inflicting tremendous damage.\nThe Millwood Greatbow's greatest asset is its &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;, which causes arrows fired from the bow to explode at the impact point after a brief delay, knocking down any nearby targets. This makes it an extremely powerful weapon in &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, as not only are its arrows capable of inflicting increased damage upon hitting its target, but the explosion can inflict additional damage to any targets that linger. The explosion is capable of hitting targets through walls, and the knockdown can displace targets, which can be extremely useful in the vicinity of ledges, narrow chokepoints and large vertical drops.\nHowever, the bow's main drawback is its pitiful attack &lt;a href=\"range\"&gt;range&lt;/a&gt;, which means that shots are particularly susceptible to damage falloff, reducing the damage threat of the arrows considerably. While this can be mitigated via equipping the &lt;a href=\"Hawk%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Hawk Ring&lt;/a&gt; and firing arrows that are not Millwood Greatarrows, it is still a weakness that is not shared by the other greatbows, which also benefit from increased accuracy due to shot curvature not affecting them as much at longer distances.\nUpgrades.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

However, they can be tough to parry due to the occasional delay of their attacks that can trick the player into attempting to parry too early, ensuring they get hit. \nThe greatbow-variant has a very extensive aggro range and will begin continuously sniping at the player from afar until they have been directly engaged via melee attacks. At which point they will immediately switch to an axe and shield. If the player evades, they will once again switch back to the bow and resume shooting. The greatarrow projectiles inflict heavy damage if hit straight on, but also explode after a few seconds, dealing even more damage due to the bow's &lt;a href=\"Pierce%20Earth\"&gt;Pierce Earth&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey are capable of using a special version of warcry which entails them charging toward the player for a second or two, then releasing a warcry along with an aura that staggers the player. After this, they will immediately begin attacking. When buffed, they do extra damage and are also more aggressive. Their attacks will also be delayed a bit in favor of a long charge-up attack that if connected, is possible of instantly killing players with lower vitality. \nTheir Chieftain-Knight (more accurately described as a High Priest) wields an &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Seeker\"&gt;Earth Seeker&lt;/a&gt;. This variant is much more aggressive and when at a distance, will use the weapon's skill, Earthen Wrath, to continuously release an area-of-effect earthquake from afar that will send foes skyward while dealing heavy damage. The effect has superior tracking and will continue to form around the player until the effect has finished. The knight will continue to do this until he is engaged via melee attacks. Regular tactics should be followed for fighting him at melee range."}

When a player attempts to do so, Mimics will proceed to chomp on them in a special grab move, causing heavy damage.\nIf Mimics are hurt before they can grab a player, they reveal a large, lolling tongue and lines of finger-bone teeth, followed by the arms and legs. Once upright they will begin to aggressively pursue their prey. Mimics are fast, tough, and deal high damage; they can easily kill the unprepared.\nIn order to determine the difference between a Mimic and Chest, the most direct visual cue one can get is by looking at the chain connected to the right side of the chest. If the chain is wrapped in a circle then the chest is safe, if the chain is straightened out then it's a Mimic.\nLore.\nThese creatures were once part of the great clan of the &lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;Gods&lt;/a&gt; but at one point they committed the sin of \"greed\". For this they were banished and cursed, resulting into their heads transforming into an imitation of treasure chests. They would became known as Mimics and spread across the world, simulating chests to trick and devour adventurers or becoming deadly defense mechanisms to protect peculiar artifacts. \nLocations.\nA total of nine Mimics can be encountered in the game:\n&lt;a href=\"Sen%27s%20Fortress\"&gt;Sen's Fortress&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; \u00d74\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Duke%27s%20Archives\"&gt;The Duke's Archives&lt;/a&gt; \u00d72\n&lt;a href=\"Oolacile%20Township\"&gt;Oolacile Township&lt;/a&gt; \u00d72\nEnemy information.\nAttacks.\n\u2020 Only applies when opening a Mimic."}
{"id": "46161", "revid": "49243392", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=46161", "title": "Mimic (Dark Souls II)", "text": "Mimics are a type of in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\nSimilarly to their \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\" counterpart; Mimics pretend to be treasure chests and attack when the player attempts to open them. Opening a mimic chest usually results in death, but they won't respawn when killed. Unlike their counterpart in \"Dark Souls\", mimics are not bipedal and instead crawl on the ground upside down.\nWooden chest Mimics can be spotted by their teeth, visible from the small crack in the chest. It also has a lock, whilst the regular do not.\nIron chest Mimics, however, have 2 small silvery locks, whilst the regular do not.\nStrategy.\nMimics can be countered in a multitude of ways. One way to tell the difference between a wooden chest and a Mimic is to look at the front. If there is a lock, do not open it. If there's none, then it's a normal chest (but may still be rigged with a &lt;a href=\"trap\"&gt;trap&lt;/a&gt;). It is also possible to see the Mimic's teeth underneath the lid, which is slightly open, as opposed to the fully closed lid of a normal chest.\nLikewise, there are differences between a normal iron chest and a Mimic which make them easier to tell apart. A Mimic disguised as an iron chest has a slightly clearer color scheme in comparison, and portrays two white vertical hinges on the front, one on each side.\nIf a player attacks a normal chest, it won't display the amount of damage inflicted like an enemy. Be careful, though, as chests can be destroyed, turning its contents into &lt;a href=\"Rubbish%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Rubbish&lt;/a&gt;. If it's a Mimic, a health bar will appear, warning the player of danger. When a Mimic is hit, it won't do anything for a few seconds before it stands up and attacks.\nWhen opening up, the Mimic can injure any player standing too close to it and, in cases with low &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;, will knock the player down. The Mimic uses a spitting attack that does decent damage, but is so poor to connect that it requires the player be almost directly in front of it. It can also attempt to grab the player but the animation is easy to spot and it has a short range.\nMimics also have an unique interaction when hit with &lt;a href=\"Lloyd%27s%20Talisman%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Lloyd's Talismans&lt;/a&gt;. Throwing a talisman at them, while they're still pretending to be a chest, will put the Mimic in a dormant state, slightly open. This way, the Mimic is still alive, but the player can still grab the item inside and escape. Unlike its \"Dark Souls\" counterpart, Lloyd's Talismans can only be used while the Mimic is in chest form.\n&lt;a href=\"Poison%20Mist%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poison Mist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20Mist%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Toxic Mist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Fog%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dark Fog&lt;/a&gt; can poison Mimics without aggroing them.\nDrops.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Majula (SotFS)=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}
{"id": "133371", "revid": "1188343", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=133371", "title": "Mimic (Dark Souls III)", "text": "Mimics are non-respawning in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\nSimilar to previous appearances in the series, Mimics are tall and thin humanoid monsters that pose as treasure chests in order to lure prey. If an incautious unkindled attempts to loot one without measuring the consequences, the Mimic will quickly grab them and start chewing on their head, inflicting heavy damage that in most cases signifies an instant &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Mimic is easily recognizable by the extended chain that lies on its side. Conversely, if the chain is curved backward, then it means the chest is real and can be safely looted.\nThere are two variants:\nMimics are non-respawning enemies and each one has a specific guaranteed drop, these always being a rare or unique item. In addition, all Mimics encountered in the game have a chance of dropping a &lt;a href=\"Symbol%20of%20Avarice%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Symbol of Avarice&lt;/a&gt;, a that grants extra &lt;a href=\"Souls%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; acquisition and boosts &lt;a href=\"Item%20Discovery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Item Discovery&lt;/a&gt; at the cost of draining &lt;a href=\"HP%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; while worn.\nThrowing an &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Hunter%20Charm\"&gt;Undead Hunter Charm&lt;/a&gt; at a Mimic, whether it is hostile or not, will cause it to drop or remain on the ground and render it in a lethargic state. The Mimic will be completely safe to loot for a short period of time, and on the first attempt the player will always obtain their fixed drop. Each time a Mimic is disabled this way, it will also have a chance to spawn a &lt;a href=\"Symbol%20of%20Avarice%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Symbol of Avarice&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\n&lt;a href=\"High%20Wall%20of%20Lothric\"&gt;High Wall of Lothric&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Cathedral of the Deep&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Catacombs%20of%20Carthus\"&gt;Catacombs of Carthus&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20Dungeon\"&gt;Irithyll Dungeon&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Profaned%20Capital\"&gt;Profaned Capital&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;Lothric Castle&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Ringed%20City%20%28location%29\"&gt;The Ringed City&lt;/a&gt; \nStrategy.\nMimics are way more dangerous if they happen to trick the player while posing as chests than how they actually perform in combat. While a Mimic has the potential of inflicting above average damage, their attacks are easily avoidable and they often miss. They can only inflict &lt;a href=\"Physical%20Damage\"&gt;physical damage&lt;/a&gt;, so they can also be blocked by shields that provide complete protection against this type of damage. In addition, they are frequently found in areas where it is possible to perform &lt;a href=\"Plunging%20Attack%23Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;plunging attacks&lt;/a&gt; on them.\nTheir grabs, however, are extremely dangerous and they will attempt to perform them frequently throughout the battle. They are also very resilient to damage, requiring several hits before they finally succumb.\nCrawling Mimics are more difficult to fight due to their more unpredictable moveset. They have the ability to spew blobs of a damaging liquid. Their \"grab\" is also more dangerous, since it may be confused with other attacks and is telegraphed very quickly. In it, the Mimic will pounce on the player, knocking them to the ground, and start licking at them, inflicting medium damage with each lick that, in total, can prove to be fatal. Fortunately, they turn around very slowly, allowing the player to move around and score hits frequently.\nDrops.\nAll Mimics have a chance of dropping a &lt;a href=\"Symbol%20of%20Avarice%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Symbol of Avarice&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;tabber&gt;High Wall of Lothric =\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

Since to use miracles a human needs to remember a more or less long story and believe in the content, the strongest miracles require great &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt; from the caster\nMiracles trace their origin to the dawn of the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Age of Fire&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; led his knights and the other lords in a war against the &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;Archdragons&lt;/a&gt;. The tales of the Lord's hunts of the dragons thus became the first legends of the Gods that would allow human to recount their deeds and replicate their powers.\nMiracles, as stories of different deities, allow different powers to be invoked for a wide range of effects, from traditional support, to offense, to empowerment and negation. Miracles of &lt;a href=\"Gwynevere%2C%20Princess%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"Bountiful%20Sunlight\"&gt;Bountiful Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; employ sunlight to heal the caster and others, miracles of &lt;a href=\"The%20Nameless%20King\"&gt;Gwyn's Firstborn&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lightning%20Spear\"&gt;Great Lightning Spear&lt;/a&gt; employ lightning to create mighty bolts, miracles of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Dark Sun Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Blade\"&gt;Darkmoon Blade&lt;/a&gt; employ the rays of moonlight to empower weapons with magic, miracles of &lt;a href=\"Velka%2C%20Goddess%20of%20Sin\"&gt;Velka, Goddess of Sin&lt;/a&gt; like the secret rite of &lt;a href=\"Vow%20of%20Silence\"&gt;Vow of Silence&lt;/a&gt; employ dark powers to counter the casting of magic in the area, miracles of &lt;a href=\"Allfather%20Lloyd\"&gt;Lloyd&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"Replenishment\"&gt;Replenishment&lt;/a&gt; are more suited for fighting healing while the miracles of &lt;a href=\"Havel%20the%20Rock\"&gt;Havel the Rock&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Barrier\"&gt;Magic Barrier&lt;/a&gt; are more suited to defend from magic. Even the servants of &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Nito\"&gt;Gravelord Nito&lt;/a&gt; employed miracles like &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Sword%20Dance\"&gt;Gravelord Sword Dance&lt;/a&gt; to create a magical copy of the &lt;a href=\"Gravelord%20Sword\"&gt;deadly sword&lt;/a&gt; of their Lord.\nIt is not necessary to learn entirely or precisely the story contained in the miracles to obtain, at least in part, the benefits offered and for this reason the Way of White also produced generalized and simpler copies of miracles to ensure that even those who did not have great faith could take advantage, albeit in a limited way, of the powers they offered. Such were the cases of &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Barrier\"&gt;Magic Barrier&lt;/a&gt;, a reduced version of the tale contained in &lt;a href=\"Great%20Magic%20Barrier\"&gt;Great Magic Barrier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Great%20Heal\"&gt;Great Heal&lt;/a&gt;, a long tale that only a select few learned but from which only several verses in the form of &lt;a href=\"Great%20Heal%20Excerpt\"&gt;Great Heal Excerpt&lt;/a&gt; were borrowed to allow more clerics to use it or even shorter summaries like &lt;a href=\"Heal\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt; designed for novice clerics.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the region and times of Drangleic, the socio-political conditions of the world changed radically from those of Lordran. Incredibly distant in space and time from the influence of the ancient gods of Anor Londo and the Way of White, the religion of the Drangleic lands inevitably underwent evolutions. This is because the knowledge available to these peoples was not only fragmentary but was slowly eroded by the continuous collapse of various kingdoms and by the fact that those who succeeded them inherited only parts of the knowledge of their predecessors, which was not controlled or regulated by any cultural entity capable of remaining stable during all the political vicissitudes or linked to the cyclical nature of the curse of Undeath.\nAs an obvious consequence the very names of the ancient deities of the Gwyn clan and pantheon of the Way of White were forgotten. The Nameless King of the clan of Gwyn's was lost to time even if the \"gross incandescence\" of the father of his followers never waned. Velka's name was lost and only the fact that sin was her domain is preserved while the robes of her priests lost their purpose. Gwynevere's name was long forgotten too and, although urns containing holy water blessed by her are still found in the Drangleic region, there are even institutions that go so far as to publicly deny that she ever existed. The fact that even the names of the long-lost gods were forgotten led the Drangleic people to continue to worship some of them, only knowing them by different names.\nThe particular cultural condition of Drangleic, therefore also led to effects in miracles, since the gods of Anor Londo no longer had an influence in the region to regulate such a delicate matter as their own legends. The priests of &lt;a href=\"Lindelt\"&gt;Lindelt&lt;/a&gt;, the country with the greatest religious influence and knowledge, were instructed that miracles are powers that find their origin in the beginnings of the world that belonged to the followers of the gods, yet they are not even aware of what the First Flame is. The original tomes that contained the ancient miracles of the gods of Anor Londo and their stories have remained in their entirety in only small numbers and most are restorations, and the very names of the gods from which they drew power have long ago been forgotten even by the priests. \nOver time, the most erudite men on the subject even began to rework and remold the sacred legends of the gods to their satisfaction and to obtain new and different powers. The constant manipulations of the divine stories therefore led to many imitative miracles to such an extent that it was impossible to even discern which was the original and which was the imitation, leaving scholars and priests to argue about their origin and truth. The priests of the Drangleic region even went so far as to \"develop\" miracles that were in no way part of the legacy of the Way of White, such as &lt;a href=\"Unveil\"&gt;Unveil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Perseverance\"&gt;Perseverance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Denial\"&gt;Denial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Caressing%20Prayer\"&gt;Caressing Prayer&lt;/a&gt;, a miracle whose very authenticity as a divine tale was questioned and which inherited knowledge of the healing sorceries of fallen New Londo. In addition the &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Warriors of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; devised a new miracles based on tales on their god of war and sun, his first knight and their faithful followers while in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Crypt\"&gt;Undead Crypt&lt;/a&gt; lost and unique miracles like &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Appease\"&gt;Soul Appease&lt;/a&gt; were preserved.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;.\nTowards the end of &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt;'s kingdom, when the power of the gods over the world had almost completely disappeared, humans began to produce miracles that had nothing to do with the ancient deities and took their powers from completely different sources. \n&lt;br&gt; In the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Cathedral of the Deep&lt;/a&gt;, the deacons who were supposed to contain the monstrosities of the Deep allowed themselves to be seduced or lost their minds, adding to the miracles that were supposed to protect them darker stories about the Deep itself, leading them to develop heretical miracles, like &lt;a href=\"Gnaw\"&gt;Gnaw&lt;/a&gt;, that drew on the stagnant darkness to manifest the ravenous insects that lurked in the depths. In &lt;a href=\"Londor\"&gt;Londor&lt;/a&gt;, a land of hollows, &lt;a href=\"Liliane\"&gt;Liliane&lt;/a&gt;'s Sable Church began to spread miracles that recounted tales portraying the suffering and conflict of Hollows and that offered salvation to them, allowing one to draw upon their darkness to infuse their weapons or \"bless\" corpses, consequently highlighting how the subject of these stories and miracles were no longer the ancient gods but human beings, undead or hollows, themselves who had begun to put their \"faith\" in their own race.\nVariations.\nTBA"}

Resonance rings appear as small white circles floating slightly above the ground.\nThe miracles which create resonance rings are &lt;a href=\"Bountiful%20Sunlight\"&gt;Bountiful Sunlight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Great%20Heal\"&gt;Great Heal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Soothing%20Sunlight\"&gt;Soothing Sunlight&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Gods\"&gt;Wrath of the Gods&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe number of resonance rings that a player is near results in a certain level of miracle synergy: 1 ring for a level 1 boost, 3 rings for a level 2 boost, 6 rings for a level 3 boost, and 10 rings for a level 4 boost. A maximum of 10 rings can spawn in a player's world at a time.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Sun%20Princess\"&gt;Ring of the Sun Princess&lt;/a&gt; grants the player one extra level of miracle synergy as long as it is worn. Without the Ring of the Sun Princess, it is possible to have the benefits of a higher level synergy boost, but only when casting miracles near a greater number of resonance rings.\nNine miracles benefit from miracle synergy, as listed below:\nNotes.\nPrior to patch 1.06, miracle synergy didn't work on the PS3. They were never encountered, with one exception: two resonance signs were always present near the bottom of the Catacombs (regardless of time of day or online status), right before the valley that leads to &lt;a href=\"Pinwheel\"&gt;Pinwheel&lt;/a&gt;. However, they did not synergize with miracles.\nAs of patch 1.07, miracle synergy doesn't work on the PS3. It is likely that this will not be resolved on the PS3, as there most likely will be no more updates."}

{"id": "46107", "revid": "356951", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=46107", "title": "Mirrah", "text": "Mirrah (\u30df\u30e9) is a in\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nLore.\nMirrah is a land located to the east of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt;. \nMirrah is known as a land of knights and in fact the country is constantly in the midst of war against its neighboring enemies, making its orders of soldiers the most important element of their society to ensure the kingdom's survival. For this reason children are recognized as adults only after they join an order of knights and distinguish themselves on the battlefield, a fact that highlights how every inhabitant of the kingdom is called to participate in the army to regenerate the losses of constant wars and the importance that serving in the military has in the culture of Mirrah. Because of this, even a person born into poverty, regardless of their gender, could aspire to wealth and fame by climbing the ranks of the army, a dream shared by many among the peasants that aspired to become a knight and escape their hardships. Thanks to one's strength and loyalty to one's lord, anyone could, by distinguishing themselves on the battlefield, be admitted into the elite ranks of Mirrah's official order of knights. \nThe official knights of Mirrah wore their &lt;a href=\"Mirrah%20Chain%20Set\"&gt;formal attire of chainmail&lt;/a&gt; that featured their heraldry: a stag set against a blue field and received their &lt;a href=\"Mirrah%20Shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;, as a symbol of the greatest knights' strength and willingness to give their lives for their country, and a &lt;a href=\"Mirrah%20Greatsword\"&gt;greatsword&lt;/a&gt; that required advanced skill and an unique sword technique. They were expected to fight honorably and rely only upon their swordsmanship\nIn Mirrah there is also the particular order of the Magic Knights. This group of soldiers was created out of the need to deal with enemies capable of using sorcery and for this reason they employed the ancient miracles of Havel like &lt;a href=\"Great%20Magic%20Barrier%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Great Magic Barrier&lt;/a&gt; to obtain a protective magical membrane capable of giving them a \"rock-like\" body that would defend them from magic, lightning, fire and dark spells. These knights, despite their pride of relying only on their swordmanship, were thus able to fight on equal terms with the sorcerers thanks to the power of the gods.\nHowever another traditional order is that of the &lt;a href=\"Suspicious%20Shadow\"&gt;Shadow Knights&lt;/a&gt;, which focuses on assassinations in the cover of darkness and for their skills were often hired as bodyguards too. They quietly carry out unspeakable tasks and use any means necessary to carry out their orders, using a peculiar &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Dagger\"&gt;Shadow Dagger&lt;/a&gt;, formed by bending a sword into the shape of a dagger, and &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Set\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; to hide in the cover of the night. These knights even employ sorceries like &lt;a href=\"Fall%20Control%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Fall Control&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hush%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Hush&lt;/a&gt; to facilitate their surreptitious activity, reducing the sounds they make and the damage they take from falls. Some of these assassins at some point fled the order of shadow knights, rejecting all forms of honor, and resorted to unseemly mercenary work.\nUnder the old capital of Mirrah there is a secret spring that retained divine powers and for this reason gushed forth water with healing properties. This &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Water%20Urn\"&gt;miraculous water&lt;/a&gt; was extracted, bottled and distributed while maintaining the secret of its location, thus guaranteeing the kingdom a very important resource of healing for both its population and the army. However Mirrah has been constantly at war recently, making the acquisition of its water not as easy as before, obviously not only due to the difficulty of external trade but because the water would have been allocated with priority within the land. The excellent alloy called \"geisteel\" had also been invented in the country of Mirrah and it was never sold abroad. The method of manufacture was kept secret as it provided the kingdom's troops with a clear military advantage as it allowed the creation of equipment that was both light and strong.\nDuring the heyday of Drangleic, &lt;a href=\"Vendrick\"&gt;King Vendrick&lt;/a&gt; ordered &lt;a href=\"Chancellor%20Wellager\"&gt;Chancellor Wellager&lt;/a&gt; to hire a craftsman who knew how to manufacture the \"geisteel\" alloy and thus gain an advantage for his army. Wellager managed to bring the craftsman &lt;a href=\"Llewellyn\"&gt;Llewellyn&lt;/a&gt; with him thanks to an immense salary, thus stealing the secret of the artisans of Mirrah. Llewellyn thus became the castle's resident master smith and began working for Vendrick, distinguishing himself for his lack of ostentation and focus on simplicity and strength. Forging &lt;a href=\"Llewellyn%20Set\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; only for a selected few, including the chancellor himself and the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Soldier\"&gt;Stone Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Knight\"&gt;Stone Knight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Dirk\"&gt;long daggers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Llewellyn%20Shield\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt;. Towards the end of his reign, Vendrick hired some of the deserting Shadow Knights from Mirrah to fight against the hollows in an attempt to stave off the curse that was plaguing his kingdom, putting them to work in the &lt;a href=\"No-man%27s%20Wharf\"&gt;No-man's Wharf&lt;/a&gt; where they sent the imprisoned undead to die in the sea, but before long they became hollow themselves."}

A mesmerizing yet lethal dance that can take away a large portion of the enemy's health, paired with the high &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt; break of the attack usually means that an opponent will be hit with all four of the slashes - decimated, if not dead.\nCompared to the Painting Guardian Sword, it lacks a unique two-handed strong attack. The Painting Guardian Sword has a two-handed variant of the one hand strong attack, hitting more and harder.\nA popular strategy was to use it as an offhand, parry-dedicated weapon, thanks to its instant parry frame. However, it lost its popularity soon after several patches which changed its parry frame."}

The palm has a gaping hole lined with teeth, reminiscent of the giant hand of &lt;a href=\"Manus%2C%20Father%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Manus&lt;/a&gt;, while their belly is filled with countless unblinking eyes.\nThey can usually be found sleeping, allowing the player to deal the first blow.

They also react surprisingly fast at the player's attempts to keep some distance, diving, rolling and slamming their back to reach them. It is recommended to draw them out of the temple one at a time and slowly wear them down with ranged weapons from a distance.\nThe player can also attack their sides, although they will frequently retaliate with rolls and body slams. If they attempt a grab attack, the player should immediately evade to the side, as the attack animation propels them forward. Should the player fail to dodge the grab, buttons can be mashed to escape early. This attack deals heavy damage and will automatically drain some &lt;a href=\"Soul%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt;. When they stand up on their hind legs and walk toward the player, hitting them with a strong attack will knock them down into a sitting position, from which the player can &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;riposte&lt;/a&gt; them for high damage.\nAlternatively, if the player has acquired the &lt;a href=\"Silvercat%20Ring\"&gt;Silvercat Ring&lt;/a&gt;, has access to &lt;a href=\"Spook\"&gt;Spook&lt;/a&gt;, or if they are willing to sustain the damage, the trio of monsters found at the bottommost chamber can be dealt with &lt;a href=\"Plunging%20Attack%23Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;plunging attacks&lt;/a&gt; by luring them out, climbing the ladder on the far right and then landing on them with a couple of attacks from above.\nThese creatures are very susceptible to &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt; damage. Using a fast-hitting weapon buffed with a &lt;a href=\"Carthus%20Rouge\"&gt;Carthus Rouge&lt;/a&gt; is highly recommended."}
