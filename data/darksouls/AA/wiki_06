He was worshiped by the humans as the \"&lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;god of war&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDuring the war against the &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, the eldest son would have taken part in the fighting together with &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Slayer%20Ornstein\"&gt;Dragon Slayer Ornstein&lt;/a&gt; and his father Gwyn, using sunlight like him to create &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lightning%20Spear\"&gt;lightning spears&lt;/a&gt; and infuse his weapons to damage the creatures' armor. The god of war would have distinguished himself as a dragon slayer, using his &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Swordspear\"&gt;swordspear&lt;/a&gt; imbued with lightning and even creating his &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Set\"&gt;personal armor&lt;/a&gt; with the scales of his preys. In addition, Ornstein, as his companion during the war, would also become his first knight and as a god of war, the firstborn would have created his own covenant of the &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Warrior of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt;, a group of knights who venerated the heir of the sun and supported other fighters in battle, obtaining &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Medal\"&gt;medals with the symbol of the divinity&lt;/a&gt; as trophies. The eldest would recognize their efforts and reward them by teaching them his &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lightning%20Spear\"&gt;lightning miracles&lt;/a&gt;. The sun warriors would also develop an &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Oath\"&gt;original miracle&lt;/a&gt; based on the story of the Nameless King, Ornstein, and the brave dragonslayers in their service\nAfter his father Gwyn linked the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; the throne of Anor Londo would pass to him, as the eldest son of the King, and he inherited the Sunlight of his father, He would thus wear the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Crown\"&gt;golden crown&lt;/a&gt; and the title of \"king of the gods\" and \"god of the sun\" of his father, and he was said to be inferior to none in terms of pure military strength. . Gwyn's firstborn carried forward his father's design and instructions, shepherding humans on the path to the Linking of the First Flame to continue the Age of Fire In fact, under Anor Londo, a &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Burg\"&gt;city was built exclusively for the undead&lt;/a&gt;, with an altar inside for the firstborn of Gwyn, and the aim of raising and cultivating a chosen undead who would one day sacrifice himself to the Flame, so much so that in city \u200b\u200bthere is the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Parish\"&gt;Undead Parish&lt;/a&gt;, a church at the center of the cult of the burg and connected to the &lt;a href=\"Bell%20Gargoyles\"&gt;first test&lt;/a&gt; to start on the path of Firelinking and ring the first &lt;a href=\"Bells%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Bells of Awakening&lt;/a&gt;, and the town is connected to the &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Kingseeker%20Frampt\"&gt;Kingseeker Frampt&lt;/a&gt; awaited the champion and directed them on their journey. \nHowever, the rest of the firstborn's reign was marked by catastrophes. The &lt;a href=\"Four%20Kings\"&gt;Four Kings&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"New%20Londo%20Ruins\"&gt;Petite Londo&lt;/a&gt; were corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Hand\"&gt;dark power&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Darkstalker%20Kaathe\"&gt;Darkstalker Kaathe&lt;/a&gt;, starting to sow devastation right near the city of the gods, forcing them, after &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Artorias\"&gt;Knight Artorias&lt;/a&gt;' failure to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Darkwraith\"&gt;Darkwraith&lt;/a&gt;s, to flood the city, sacrificing all the humans in it, and seal it. A similar event happened in &lt;a href=\"Oolacile\"&gt;Oolacile&lt;/a&gt; when, again due to Kaathe, the awakening of the &lt;a href=\"Manus%2C%20Father%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;primordial human Manus&lt;/a&gt; and his fury led to the collapse of the country when Artorias was unable to defeat him. In addition to the serious situation on the borders of Anor Londo, the city of the gods itself became a dangerous place when a group of cultists began targeting the clan of Gwyn and their kind and occult weapons capable of killing the gods reached inside the walls of Anor Londo. Furthermore, in the city of the gods &lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;Seath the Scaleless&lt;/a&gt; had now completely lost his mind, transforming his Archives into a prison and going so far as to kidnap the &lt;a href=\"Pisaca\"&gt;maidens of Gwynevere&lt;/a&gt; to carry out experiments on them.\nAt a certain point, the eldest son of Gwyn would go too far as he decided to sacrifice everything to \"ally himself with the &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;\". This behavior proved intolerable for the other deities of Anor Londo, archenemies of the dragons with whom they had fought until their extermination in the past, and the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back was used as an excuse to condemn the firstborn to be dethroned and exiled from the city. The fury of the gods was so great that the former king even lost his deific status, his statues were destroyed and his name erased from the annals of history. Before leaving Anor Londo, the eldest would have left his &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Blade\"&gt;sunlight blade miracle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Sun%27s%20Firstborn\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt; on Gwyn's empty grave in his mausoleum as a final farewell, still demonstrating respect for his father. Although now out of the pantheon of the gods and without a place, the god of war would continue to watch closely over his warriors of the sunlight, listening to their prayers and rewarding the &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Medal\"&gt;proofs of their exploits&lt;/a&gt; with his miracles of &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Spear\"&gt;Sunlight Spear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lightning%20Spear\"&gt;Great Lightning Spear&lt;/a&gt;..\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point the &lt;a href=\"Heirs%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;followers of the god of the sun&lt;/a&gt; reached &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"Harvest%20Valley\"&gt;Harvest Valley&lt;/a&gt;, a region under the control of &lt;a href=\"Belfry%20Sol\"&gt;Alken&lt;/a&gt;, the remains of an altar that venerated the Nameless King can be found in the form of an exact replica of his ancient statues, implying that in the kingdom the god of the sun he was still worshipped before its fall. \nAfter all this time, however, the ancient &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Warrior of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; are no longer alive or no longer have the desire to show themselves openly. As a result, the veneration of the sun that was once widespread among great warriors has become a lost belief, however their very absence has made the tales of their brave deeds all the more alluring. In particular, &lt;a href=\"Solaire%20of%20Astora\"&gt;Solaire of Astora&lt;/a&gt;'s deeds have been memorialized and his &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Sword\"&gt;artifacts&lt;/a&gt; passed down in the cult of the Heirs of the Sun, who continue to act to help other warriors in times of need following the original philosophy of the cult of the sun and collecting evidence of their successes in the form of ancient &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Medal%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;medals with the symbol of the sun&lt;/a&gt; to search among them for the most worthy servant of the sun god.\nDespite this, the &lt;a href=\"Falconer\"&gt;Falconer&lt;/a&gt;s, a group of mercenary falconers hired to protect the elites of &lt;a href=\"Volgen\"&gt;Volgen&lt;/a&gt; were still part of the covenant of those that worshipped the God of the Sun and possessed their Sunlight Medals. In addition, in &lt;a href=\"Lindelt\"&gt;Lindelt&lt;/a&gt;, a \"sacred land\" known for its clerics and miracles, his miracles of &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Lightning Spear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lightning%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Great Lightning Spear&lt;/a&gt; were preserved and passed down among the religion of the region although the name of the clan of gods and the sun god had been lost. Furthermore, some other miracles of the god such as the &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Blade\"&gt;Sunlight Blade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Oath\"&gt;Sacred Oath&lt;/a&gt; appear to have been part of the lost culture of &lt;a href=\"Olaphis\"&gt;Olaphis&lt;/a&gt;, indicating a continuing tradition of the cult of the Nameless King, even if fragmentary, through all the history of Drangleic.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver the centuries, the Nameless King would continue to lead a warrior's life and took part in countless battles, fighting alongside his stormdrake with whom he forged a relationship of profound camaraderie, coming to consider him as a comrade in arms as was an ancient custom among soldiers of the gods.\nAt the origins of the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt;, when people originating from the region of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt; and followers of the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20Blue\"&gt;Way of Blue&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Heirs%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;Heirs of the Sun&lt;/a&gt; moved to a new location, they still remembered the Nameless King as their God of the Sun. In fact, as the early inhabitants of Lothric found themselves facing large numbers of &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Wyvern\"&gt;wyverns&lt;/a&gt; they had to become dragonslayers to surviveand thus they turned to the Nameless King, building an &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20of%20Sunlight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;altar&lt;/a&gt; for him. The first knights of Lothric began to worship the ancestral deity of the sun and war who in return gave them the tools to face the wyverns. Their &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Armour\"&gt;first armors&lt;/a&gt; were heavy masses of iron capable of withstanding dragon fire and similar in design to the &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Set\"&gt;ancient armor&lt;/a&gt; of the dragonslayers of Anor Londo while their shields were capable of absorbing the high lightning emission of wyverns. From the sun god they also soon learned how to infuse their &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Greataxe\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; with the power of lightning, lethal against dragons, and the ancient techniques for hunting archdragons. Armed and protected to counter the fearsome creatures, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Armour\"&gt;old knights of Lothric&lt;/a&gt; devoted themselves to the &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20of%20Sunlight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;covenant of the sun god&lt;/a&gt; and finally learned to use his &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lightning%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt; which allowed them to manipulate the power of lightning. The cult of the Nameless King remained widespread among the army of Lothric even until the last days of the kingdom, as one of his altars can be found right inside the military barracks, and the knights of the kingdom are still part of the &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20of%20Sunlight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Warriors of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; covenant.\nStrategy.\nPhase 1: King of the Storm.\nThe fight begins with the Nameless King entering on his mount from the midway point of the arena. He then proceeds to attack the player through either swipes and slams from his spear. Lightning bolts during flight and flames fired from his mount. Both have two qualifiers; one being that he touches down nearby the player and sprays a swatch of fire in their direction, to cover a large area. The other being when the player stays under the mounts body and is reminiscent of the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Dragon\"&gt;Ancient Dragon&lt;/a&gt;s attack of flying straight up and flooding the area under him with a long burst of fire. This can easily kill the player as it will stun them in the first hit, knocking them down and, hit them once again as they recover.\nAll attacks should either be leveled at the mounts head, or the rider himself. Several attacks are enough to stagger the mount long enough for a critical, or if one has sufficient int/faith. A spell can be used to possibly once shot the rider. A &lt;a href=\"Sunlight%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Sunlight Spear&lt;/a&gt; and standard charm were enough to accomplish this task on NG+1.\nPhase 2: The Nameless King.\nThe Nameless King will dismount and absorb the strength of his mount after it is defeated. His attacks will be dragged out when going after the player. Usually catching an unprepared fighter off guard as they roll too early and are struck for heavy damage. Which on later a play through, can nearly one hit the player in several instances. His attacks will either be followed with large burst of wind, or lightning and he also possesses several attacks that can release ranged bolts on the player. Along with a grab that can travel up to 20 units in the player's direction.\nIt is advised that the player wait for him to finish his attacks before attacking him during his recovery from the combo, or strike him when he is stuck telegraphing his more powerful maneuvers."}

Instead, she spawned a corrupted fire known as the &lt;a href=\"Flame%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Flame of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;. When she failed to control the new flame, it consumed her and molded her into a twisted being known as the &lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, the source of all &lt;a href=\"Demon%20%28lore%29\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually, the Bed of Chaos was destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt;, but the flames of Chaos lived on. At an unknown point, the flames of Chaos were discovered deep below the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Eleum%20Loyce\"&gt;Eleum Loyce&lt;/a&gt;. In an attempt to appease the raging flame, the &lt;a href=\"Ivory%20King\"&gt;Ivory King&lt;/a&gt; built a great cathedral at its mouth and the oracle of Eleum Loyce, &lt;a href=\"Alsanna%2C%20Silent%20Oracle\"&gt;Alsanna&lt;/a&gt;, prayed in silent vigilance. The attempt was unsuccessful and the flames still raged.\nThe king made some attempts to combat the Chaos, and his knights delved valiantly into the depths to exterminate the terrible things that dwelled there, but not one of them returned. Eventually, the Ivory King sensed the degradation of his soul and left Eleum Loyce. He traveled deep into the Chaos with his knights until he was devoured by the flames.\nOverview.\nThe Old Chaos is a large platform afloat on a sea of lava with roots hanging down from above. &lt;a href=\"Alsanna%2C%20Silent%20Oracle\"&gt;Alsanna, Silent Oracle&lt;/a&gt; opens the passage to it. After passing through a fog gate, the player drops down a deep pit which deposits them onto the platform. At least one &lt;a href=\"Knight%20of%20Eleum%20Loyce\"&gt;Knight of Eleum Loyce&lt;/a&gt; will accompany the player into the Chaos.\nUpon arrival, &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Loyce%20Knight\"&gt;Charred Loyce Knight&lt;/a&gt;s will begin to appear from the portal gates at the edges of the platform. After several of them have been defeated, large pillars will raise from the lava and the &lt;a href=\"Burnt%20Ivory%20King\"&gt;Burnt Ivory King&lt;/a&gt; will enter the arena to initiate the final boss battle. After he has been defeated, a beam of light will appear at one end of the platform to warp back into the cathedral.\nAfter the king's defeat, the Old Chaos can be continually accessed to fight Charred Loyce Knights and obtain &lt;a href=\"Loyce%20Soul\"&gt;Loyce Soul&lt;/a&gt;s for Alsanna."}

After freeing her from the library, she'll move to the attic in &lt;a href=\"Ariandel%20Chapel\"&gt;Ariandel Chapel&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nThe Painter is a young woman with dragon lineage and, despite not receiving a name, her mother imparted her with high levels of knowledge about the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Soul\"&gt;Dark Soul&lt;/a&gt; so that she has the ability to harness these two primordial forces and use them to create Painted Worlds.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Friede\"&gt;Elfriede&lt;/a&gt; left behind her role as one the leaders of the Sable Church of &lt;a href=\"Londor\"&gt;Londor&lt;/a&gt;, her two sisters and even her full name she was eventually drawn into the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Painted World of Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;. Here she came to accept it as her new home and she discovered that she wanted to \"protect\" the forlorns who inhabited the Painted World and assumed the precise form that they yearned for: that of their lost mistress &lt;a href=\"Priscilla\"&gt;Priscilla&lt;/a&gt;. Over time Friede earned the trust of some of the inhabitants of the painting, to the point that the &lt;a href=\"Corvian%20Knight\"&gt;Corvian Knight&lt;/a&gt;s who protected the village became infatuated with her, but above all she managed to get close to &lt;a href=\"Father%20Ariandel\"&gt;Father Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;, a great Corvian who had the task of guarding the Flame inside of the Painted World and to restore it using the fire when the painting began to rot, to bring it back to life and avoid the fate of the stagnant outside world. However, just when the painting began to be corrupted and its inhabitants made up their minds to burn it away, Friede opposed their wish, preferring a slow death in the comforting rot to the renewing change of the Flame. And so she convinced Ariandel to bury the Flame of the painting and hold back its strength using his blood while her Corvian Knights swore to \"protect\" the painting from fire and even killed their own brethren who opposed her. \nBecause of her twisted goal, she ordered &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Vilhelm\"&gt;Sir Vilhelm&lt;/a&gt; to imprison the Painter in the library of the corvian village and to guard her to prevent her from restoring the painting, prompting &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Knight%20Gael\"&gt;Slave Knight Gael&lt;/a&gt; to escape from the painting taking a rotten scrap of it and begin searching for another Unkindled that would fulfill the prophecy stating that when the Ashes inside the painting became two the Flame would return and burn the rot away.\nPlot.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20One\"&gt;Ashen One&lt;/a&gt; first hears about the Painter while talking with &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Knight%20Gael\"&gt;Slave Knight Gael&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0the one she affectionately calls \"uncle\", at the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Cathedral of the Deep&lt;/a&gt;. Gael mentions that \"his Lady\" resides in the cold land of Ariandel and claims that the Ashen One's role is to show her the flame. Similarly, the &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Corvian%20Settler%20%28character%29\"&gt;Forlorn Corvian Settler&lt;/a&gt; met in the Corvian Settlement shows his enthusiasm upon meeting the Ashen One, as this is the only person to show \"his Lady\" flame.\nThe Painter was brought to the library's attic by &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Vilhelm\"&gt;Sir Vilhelm&lt;/a&gt;, who was guarding her and the key. He was serving &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Friede\"&gt;Friede&lt;/a&gt;, who imprisoned the Painter with &lt;a href=\"Father%20Ariandel\"&gt;Father Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;'s help. Ariandel is suppressing the flame with his own blood, hence only his and Friede's death can make the Painter able to see it. Painter relocates from library to Ariandel Chapel's attic after opening the door. She's found sitting in front of a big canvas. During her dialogue, she repeats five times that the painting will show a \"cold, dark, and very gentle place\", which is going to be a good home for someone. Upon entering the Painted World of Ariandel, the &lt;a href=\"Drowsy%20Forlorn\"&gt;Drowsy Forlorn&lt;/a&gt;, the first character met on a new path,\u00a0refers to it as a \"cold and gentle\" and \"fine\" home for forlorn ones, who have seen terrible things. However, he doesn't describe it as a \"dark\" place, despite being a \"rotting\" bed and just \"fine\" home compared to \"goodly\" one, as planned by the Painter.\nAfter the Ashen One finds\u00a0&lt;a href=\"The%20Ringed%20City%20%28location%29\"&gt;The Ringed City&lt;/a&gt;, the Painter mentions that she is waiting to receive a pigment colored like the dark soul of man. It is the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20the%20Dark%20Soul\"&gt;Blood of the Dark Soul&lt;/a&gt;, received after Gael's death by the Ashen One's hands. The pigment consists of dark souls consumed by Gael, with blood seeping from his body. After the Painters receives the pigment, she gently thanks the Ashen One and, now in possession of Flame and Dark, she finally starts to work on her painting. She continues to await uncle Gael's return, unaware of his death."}

The Pursuer tracks the Bearer to the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20of%20Fallen%20Giants\"&gt;Forest of Fallen Giants&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Bastille\"&gt;The Lost Bastille&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Keep\"&gt;Iron Keep&lt;/a&gt; and lastly &lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Castle\"&gt;Drangleic Castle&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nThe Pursuer is a large hulking knight who hunts down those who bear the undead curse, possibly to atone for past sins committed. Wielding an &lt;a href=\"Pursuer%27s%20Ultra%20Greatsword\"&gt;ultra greatsword&lt;/a&gt; renowned for being one of the mightiest of its design, the Pursuer will relentlessly stalk its target until slain. It is unknown if the Pursuer served under &lt;a href=\"Vendrick\"&gt;King Vendrick&lt;/a&gt;, as did many other knights, or if it acted off of its own accord.\nLocations.\nIn Scholar of the First Sin, there are several new Pursuers in addition to the ones in the main game.\nOne of the NG+ Pursuers in Drangleic Castle's throne room spawns already-buffed by his Curse Stab.\nAttacks.\nChargeAt a distance, the Pursuer will charge at the player with an upward strike. The easiest way to avoid, is walking to the right as soon as the animation starts.\n3 Hit ComboPerforms two horizontal swipes and if all attacks are performed while the player is still near him, will follow it up with a full 360\u00b0 spin attack or an overhead smash.\nShield BashHe uses his shield and hits the player once with it, causes large stamina drain if blocked.\nCurse StabThe Pursuer's Blade glows blue and he lunges the sword at the player, if it connects, the player will be in an animation where they are impaled on his sword and the player will then be &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;cursed&lt;/a&gt;. This attack cannot be blocked. The hitbox lingers for some time, so while the attack's long windup and low tracking makes it easy to avoid, one can also accidentally walk back into it after dodging it. For the boss variant this also allows it to start using its magic-based attacks. \nIf The Pursuer isn't right next to a target this attack will have a very clear telegraph: The Pursuer will float towards a target in \"neutral mode\", i.e. while not performing an attack and instead just keeps his sword and shield to his sides, before performing the Curse Stab upon reaching the target. \nDark Seeker ProjectilesThe Pursuer will lift into the air and vent &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; energy from its body. This will cause 3 to 5 projectiles to exit its body and fire towards the player after a short delay, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Affinity\"&gt;Affinity&lt;/a&gt; Hex. The projectiles are slow but track extremely well and deal a moderate amount of damage. Typically, this attack occurs after he has dropped below 50% health, but on rare occasion it can happen before. To avoid it, simply run behind the Pursuer as soon as he starts casting it. The boss variant will only begin to use this after it has landed its Curse Stab at least once, but the mini-boss variants can always use it. \nSpread ProjectilesSimilar to the Seeker Projectiles this attack starts with the same animation, but it fires several waves of spreading hex like attacks. These attacks can be dodged by rolling backwards away from the Pursuer and the next attacks will follow the relative direction of the first blast. (the attack has a similar look to the Hex Dark Hail, but lighter in color). The boss variant will only begin to use this after it has landed its Curse Stab at least once, but the mini-boss variants can always use it. \nEnergy BlastSwings his sword and produces an energy blast in the players direction. The Pursuer in Iron Keep cannot use this move. \nCombo 2While blocking with his greatshield, quickly thrusts his weapon twice. He then swings his sword like a whirlwind while ascending a little from the ground.\nDefenses.\n Slash/Strike/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense. -20% strike defense means taking 120% damage. (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)\nStrategy.\nThe Pursuer's combos mainly come in threes, with the third strike leaving him vulnerable to a few hits afterwards.\nAlthough the Pursuer is an agile opponent, &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;parrying&lt;/a&gt; him immobilizes him for several seconds. This allows ample time for a counterattack, and more importantly allows the player to employ ballistae\u00a0against him. On NG, if all three ballista bolts hit, 90% of his health can be taken out. A sizable chunk of his health is taken off even if not all of the bolts hit. The &lt;a href=\"Buckler%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Buckler&lt;/a&gt; received just before the second bonfire in the forest will make parrying easier.\nNote that the Pursuer can be poisoned with weapons or two casts of the pyromancy &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Mist%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poison Mist&lt;/a&gt;. Having two weapons at your disposal is a good way to poison him then switch to your more powerful weapon, Poison &lt;a href=\"Ricard%27s%20Rapier%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Ricard's Rapier&lt;/a&gt; +10 with two strong attacks will poison him, hence then switching to your main weapon for further damage is a good strategy. At the start of the fight, you have time before he fully materializes to initiate a poison.\nMost of his attacks can be evaded if the player rolls to the right (his shielded side). However, this is not advised when he uses his three-hit combo as the spinning slash can still strike the player from the side. In particular, running away to bait his charge and then dodging through it, followed by an attack (Don't use the rolling attack, as it will most likely miss) is a very good tactic, so long as the player knows what the window of invincibility is for their character. (I-Frames)\nHe is vulnerable to lightning damage and somewhat vulnerable to magic. \u00a0\nHe is also capable of inflicting &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt; on the player. This attack is telegraphed by the Pursuer extending its arms and hovering slowly toward the player, the sword will glow blue and the Pursuer will lunge forward, impaling the player, then lift them into and release a Curse-inducing cloud. It is possible to avoid getting cursed if the player is killed by the initial lunge. If the player is successfully Cursed by this move, the Pursuer will get a power boost, evidenced by its glowing, red eyes and a black mist surrounding it. This allows the Pursuer to release &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; orbs that homes in on the player. If any of the orbs connect with the player, they will deal massive damage and cause Curse build-up.\nFor the third encounter in &lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Castle\"&gt;Drangleic Castle&lt;/a&gt;, an easier way of obtaining the Ring of Blades +2 is to defeat one of the Pursuers, return to the King's Gate bonfire, then go back for a one-on-one battle against the second Pursuer.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 The Pursuer by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=merS6to_8-E&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

{"id": "45204", "revid": "49243392", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=45204", "title": "The Rotten", "text": "The Rotten is a &lt;a href=\"Boss%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\nHe is a huge mass of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; fused together, forming a single creature. A &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;Hollow&lt;/a&gt; on his top-left shoulder seems to telegraph the whole entity's movements and attacks.\nPlot.\nThe Rotten is in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Gulch\"&gt;Black Gulch&lt;/a&gt;. After seemingly failing to put a statue\u2019s head back on its body, he becomes enraged and proceeds to focus on the player.\nFight overview.\nThroughout the fight, the Rotten alternates between his cleaver and his empty hand. His cleaver deals heavy damage and can send the player flying or easily &lt;a href=\"stun-lock\"&gt;stun-lock&lt;/a&gt; the player and &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Break\"&gt;break&lt;/a&gt; their guard. The hand has two moves; a front smash and a grab. The grab damages twice; the initial damage is from the grab itself and the following damage comes when the Rotten wrings the player out like a rag.\nStrategy.\nDuring the fight, players would do well to avoid the flaming patches throughout the arena as they can deal heavy damage over a short period. Casting &lt;a href=\"Flash%20Sweat%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Flash Sweat&lt;/a&gt; before entering the fog wall can mitigate the damage.\nThe Rotten attacks with its cleaver by a heavy downward slash, two quicker downward slashes followed by a third heavy slash with slight windup, or horizontal slashes. Dodging toward his right is a good idea as the player risks being hit by the blade by &lt;a href=\"rolling\"&gt;rolling&lt;/a&gt; away from him toward the left.\nWhile not particularly slow, running from The Rotten gives the player sufficient time to cast a self-buff or heal. This small period can be used to cast Flash Sweat to avoid fire damage from the burning pits, &lt;a href=\"Strong%20Magic%20Shield\"&gt;Strong Magic Shield&lt;/a&gt; to counter the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;dark&lt;/a&gt; damage it deals after half its health has been lost, or apply a &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; buff.\nAfter losing about half of its health, the Rotten begins using ranged attacks that deal heavy dark damage. One travels in a straight line after a heavy downward slash, while the other is an &lt;a href=\"area%20of%20effect\"&gt;area of effect&lt;/a&gt; attack. The Rotten will be vulnerable for a short time after each attack, giving ample time to switch to offense. With the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Leo%20Ring\"&gt;Old Leo Ring&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Thrust%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;thrusting&lt;/a&gt; weapon equipped, this fight can end soon after.\nDealing enough damage to one of the arms will sever it, but it will regenerate after some time. If the player cuts off the left arm, they will be rewarded with a &lt;a href=\"Pharros%27%20Lockstone\"&gt;Lockstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith magic, the player should keep their distance from the Rotten and only cast while the Rotten recovers from its attacks.\nDefenses.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense. -35% thrust means taking 135% damage.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 The Rotten by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Tg7VccCrD4&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

It also has just enough &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Attunement&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; to immediately use supportive &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Sorceries&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Spook\"&gt;Spook&lt;/a&gt; for increased stealth or &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Weapon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic Weapon&lt;/a&gt; for extra damage without additional investment in those stats. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Bandit%27s%20Knife%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bandit's Knife&lt;/a&gt; has low damage per attack but can mostly make up for this against enemies that can be afflicted with &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt;, since the dagger's rapid attacks can proc the status effect quickly (even more so with a &lt;a href=\"Carthus%20Rouge\"&gt;Carthus Rouge&lt;/a&gt; on it), and its &lt;a href=\"Quickstep\"&gt;Quickstep&lt;/a&gt; will let it maneuver quickly around foes or in areas that slow movement such as the swamp in &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Keep\"&gt;Farron Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, a flat attack buff such as &lt;a href=\"Charcoal%20Pine%20Resin%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Charcoal Pine Resin&lt;/a&gt; or Magic Weapon will help the most in increasing damage dealt. \nOf the other two pieces of equipment, the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Round%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Iron Round Shield&lt;/a&gt; is a small shield with a decent amount of physical defence (if not elemental defence) and a fairly high amount of &lt;a href=\"Stability\"&gt;Stability&lt;/a&gt;, along with a &lt;a href=\"Small%20Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Small Shield&lt;/a&gt;s improved &lt;a href=\"Parry%20%28skill%29\"&gt;Parry&lt;/a&gt; Weapon Art. The &lt;a href=\"Short%20Bow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Short Bow&lt;/a&gt; on the other hand, is a fairly weak weapon with decent range (if a bit short for a &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bow&lt;/a&gt;) that is best used for pulling foes from their starting location or to whittle down strong foes from just outside of their reach, instead of as a main weapon. As a light bow it has the advantageous quality of being able to fire directly out of a roll or sprint, and its Weapon Art, &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20Fire\"&gt;Rapid Fire&lt;/a&gt;, lets it potentially &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; easier with &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poison Arrow&lt;/a&gt;s. The starting &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Wood Arrow&lt;/a&gt;s can be resupplied from the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20Handmaid\"&gt;Shrine Handmaid&lt;/a&gt;, and will most likely have to be so fairly often if used for attacking since they have low damage. \nThough it has decent physical defence and dark defence for light armor, thanks to its &lt;a href=\"Thief%20Mask%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Thief Mask&lt;/a&gt; and partial &lt;a href=\"Deserter%20Set\"&gt;Deserter Set&lt;/a&gt; not covering its hands slot the Thief effectively has a flat defence penalty, since filling an armor slot gives a small bonus to flat defence. This is most easily fixed by taking the &lt;a href=\"Master%27s%20Gloves\"&gt;Master's Gloves&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Master\"&gt;Sword Master&lt;/a&gt; outside of &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt;, or by buying the &lt;a href=\"Leather%20Gloves%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Leather Gloves&lt;/a&gt; from the Shrine Handmaid. \nIt's more of a hard to use class, owing to its short and fairly weak weapon, asking for greater skill in dodging attacks to get close.

This makes the special attack usable up to eight times before it breaks on the ninth use, although it can be used up to 17 times, breaking on the 18th, with the &lt;a href=\"Bracing%20Knuckle%20Ring\"&gt;Bracing Knuckle Ring&lt;/a&gt; +2.\nThe projectile is functionally identical to the &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Lightning Spear&lt;/a&gt; variants, although weaker. This makes it great for punishing healing attempts in &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; as it can be fired considerably quicker than a Lightning Spear and still does respectable damage. Additionally, hitting any opponent with both the projectile and the blade itself whilst using the special attack will inflict exceptionally high damage.\nMoveset.\nThe moveset is the same as the &lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Sword\"&gt;Drangleic Sword&lt;/a&gt;, except for the heavy attacks, which are switched out for quickly shooting a weak lightning spear, similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dragonslayer Spear&lt;/a&gt;."}

When they were chosen, the god gifted them &lt;a href=\"White%20Seance%20Ring\"&gt;holy rings&lt;/a&gt; to increase their holy magic and &lt;a href=\"Thorolund%20Talisman\"&gt;talismans&lt;/a&gt; infused with the divine power of Lloyd that allowed them an higher miracle adjustement that did not depended upon their faith. The noble priests were also the guardians of laws and social classes as followers of the god of these domains.\nWay of White priests in Thorolund wear distinct caps. While in Thorolund it shows their position within the hierarchy, in &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt; it has almost no meaning. Those dissatisfied with church teachings must go on a spiritual journey, this is likely why clerics from Thorolund are even found in Lordran. High-ranked clerics of Thorolund were granted with &lt;a href=\"Thorolund%20Talisman\"&gt;Thorolund Talisman&lt;/a&gt; whilst &lt;a href=\"Ivory%20Talisman\"&gt;Ivory Talisman&lt;/a&gt; could be only given to female clerics.\nCleric warriors of the Way of White who have proven their faith were gifted with &lt;a href=\"Crescent%20Axe\"&gt;Crescent Axe&lt;/a&gt;s and were known to be unyielding in combat.\nAt some point the Way of White created its first &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; paladin: &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20Leeroy\"&gt;Paladin Leeroy&lt;/a&gt;, gifting him a &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20Set\"&gt;golden armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grant\"&gt;Grant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sanctus\"&gt;Sanctus&lt;/a&gt;, two legendary weapons, and the blessing of a white flame to be effective against the Dark. The paladin was sent to &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt; in the first Undead mission of the Way of White. Later there were further Undead missions, with the aim of seeking out &lt;a href=\"Rite%20of%20Kindling\"&gt;Kindling&lt;/a&gt;s, the secret rite of feeding bonfires with Humanity. One included &lt;a href=\"Reah%20of%20Thorolund\"&gt;Reah of Thorolund&lt;/a&gt;, last daughter of the royal house of Thorolund, accompanied by the two soldiers &lt;a href=\"Vince%20of%20Thorolund\"&gt;Vince of Thorolund&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nico%20of%20Thorolund\"&gt;Nico of Thorolund&lt;/a&gt;."}

This allows it to outcompete most other Talismans until higher levels of faith.

{"id": "131701", "revid": "49243392", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=131701", "title": "Thrall", "text": "Thralls, also known as Hollow Slaves, are &lt;a href=\"Enemies%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\nThralls are tiny hollows that are very agile and move rapidly. They are also very fragile, but can deal heavy damage.\nThey wear nothing but loincloths and their characteristic &lt;a href=\"Thrall%20Hood\"&gt;hoods&lt;/a&gt;, and are seen wielding &lt;a href=\"Thrall%20Axe\"&gt;axes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warpick%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;warpicks&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Flamberge%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;greatswords&lt;/a&gt;, and some also have blowpipes they can use to engage the player from a distance. Certain variants are also able to hurl &lt;a href=\"Firebomb%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;firebombs&lt;/a&gt;.\nThralls are very cowardly and opportunistic, only choosing to engage the player when they have a numerical advantage or attempting to lead them into traps. They are normally encountered in groups of at least three or four, and will often hang from ceilings or walls above the player, ambushing them when they approach loot or enter a narrow chokepoint that limits their mobility. After getting in a successful attack, they may scurry back quickly, avoiding players' retaliatory strikes.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Thrall%20Axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;-wielding variant will frequently perform their weapon's skill, &lt;a href=\"Quickstep\"&gt;Quickstep&lt;/a&gt;, to position themselves around the player and allow other Thralls to surround and overwhelm them.\nThralls encountered within the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt; are much stronger, having larger health pools and wielding weapons with red-hot blades that will inflict &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage as well as physical.\nStrategy.\nIndividually, Thralls are very small threats, their real danger lies in their tendency to mob players or ambush them while aided by other enemies. If the player senses a trap, it is best to step forward to trigger the ambush, and then immediately &lt;a href=\"roll\"&gt;roll&lt;/a&gt; away and retreat to more favorable terrain, where the Thralls must all attack from a single direction.\nAlways keep an eye on the surrounding areas, especially above or below. Thralls can often be seen hanging from ceilings or walls, a sure sign of a trap. Using a &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; to hit them will cause them to immediately drop down or climb up and attack, allowing crafty players to thin out potential ambushes one by one and greatly reducing the threat they pose.\nThralls that wield axes or warpicks have relatively weak attack power, and blocking any of their attacks with a &lt;a href=\"Medium%20Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;medium shield&lt;/a&gt; or larger will cause them to stagger and recoil, allowing the player to inflict bonus &lt;a href=\"instability\"&gt;instability&lt;/a&gt; damage against them and potentially kill them in a single attack.\nLocations.\n&lt;a href=\"Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Undead Settlement&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Cathedral of the Deep&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Consumed%20King%27s%20Garden\"&gt;Consumed King's Garden&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Dreg%20Heap\"&gt;The Dreg Heap&lt;/a&gt;\nDrops.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Undead Settlement =\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The Defender is a heavily armored warrior while the Watcher is lighter and more agile, both wield a shield and a greatsword.\nLocation.\nThey are found in the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Want\"&gt;Throne of Want&lt;/a&gt;, behind the King's Gate in &lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Castle\"&gt;Drangleic Castle&lt;/a&gt; which can only be opened with the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Ring\"&gt;King's Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nThe Watcher is fast while the Defender is slightly slower, making the fight very reminiscent of the fight with &lt;a href=\"Ornstein%20and%20Smough\"&gt;Ornstein and Smough&lt;/a&gt;; as such, the same strategies can be utilized.\nOne difference between the two fights is that both must be killed almost simultaneously. Failure to do so will result in one attempting to resurrect the other with full\u00a0health which can be done indefinitely, though there is a delay before the remaining one will attempt to resurrect their fallen comrade. The player may finish off whoever is trying to resurrect the other as there is a casting time for the revival.\nBoth of them will buff their weapons with &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; (Defender) and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; (Watcher) when they reach half health. In addition, the Defender will throw away his shield once he starts buffing his sword and he will not regain it, even if he is revived.\nThe Watcher has lower resistances than the Defender, so a good strategy is to bring the Watcher to low health and then kill the Defender; the Watcher can be easily dispatched during the revival of the Defender.\nThe Watcher is usually the one to close the distance first, splitting the both of them up and allowing for easy damage. However, after losing his shield, the Defender will be much more aggressive and will close the distance much more frequently.\nBoth bosses tend to go for the same target, making it harder to split them up to fight them individually. This can be used as an advantage if one wishes to do so: the host or phantom, if targeted, can tank them while the other damages from behind.\nSummoning.\n&lt;a href=\"Vengarl%20of%20Forossa\"&gt;Vengarl of Forossa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Benhart%20of%20Jugo\"&gt;Benhart of Jugo&lt;/a&gt; can be summoned for the fight, both summon signs can be found right outside the fog door.\nIn , &lt;a href=\"Bradley%20of%20the%20Old%20Guard\"&gt;Bradley of the Old Guard&lt;/a&gt; can also be summoned for this fight.\nDefenses.\nThrone Watcher.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense.\nThrone Defender\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 Throne Defender, Throne Watcher by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waIHAY43ZGA&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

A long, jagged pathway extending down from the final gate in the depths of the castle leads to a kiln guarded by the last of Vendrick's guardians, the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20Watcher%20and%20Defender\"&gt;Throne Watcher and Defender&lt;/a&gt;. These warriors serve as the last bulwark against &lt;a href=\"Nashandra\"&gt;Nashandra&lt;/a&gt; claming the throne, and by extension, gaining the power of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe actual throne takes the form of a great stone slab carved into the form of a throne, surrounded by a kiln of ash-covered stone, across a gap filled with &lt;a href=\"Golem\"&gt;Golem&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0that aid the true monarch to their rightful place\nLore.\nThe Throne of Want serves as a means to link the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, in a way similar to the thrones of &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lothrics\u2019s Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt;, as it is built inside a kiln and the ashes that cover it seems to indicate the remains of previous &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lords of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile it\u2019s exact origins are unknown, the structure and ashes surrounding the Throne imply that it is much more ancient than the Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"King%20Vendrick\"&gt;Vendrick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nashandra\"&gt;Nashandra&lt;/a&gt;, once Vendrick sougth the fire, for he believed that by linking it he could end the &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead Curse&lt;/a&gt;. But he would later discover that this was a lie, since the flame would fade again and the curse return every time, he then refused to sit on the Throne and decided to search for a permanent way to end the curse. \nAt a certain moment during his reign, &lt;a href=\"Nashandra\"&gt;Nashandra&lt;/a&gt; came to Drangleic, she coveted the Throne of Want and the power of the First Flame, and seduced &lt;a href=\"Vendrick\"&gt;Vendrick&lt;/a&gt; in order to use him as a means to accomplish her goal, becoming his queen.\nMuch time later, after Drangleic was ravaged due to both the war with the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Giants&lt;/a&gt; and the undead curse, which all of Vendrick\u2019s and &lt;a href=\"Aldia%2C%20Scholar%20of%20the%20First%20Sin\"&gt;Aldia&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s plans to cure were in vain, Vendrick found out about Nashandra's plan: to use the throne to claim the First Flame for herself. Vendrick reacted quickly and sent the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20Watcher%20and%20the%20Throne%20Defender\"&gt;Throne Watcher and the Throne Defender&lt;/a&gt; to guard the throne. He then fled to the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Crypt\"&gt;Undead Crypt&lt;/a&gt;, where he eventually went &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, to keep his &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Ring\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20the%20King\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; from the wrong hands. He did all this in an attempt to stop Nashandra.\nPlot.\nThe Throne of Want is the final location in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\", where the &lt;a href=\"Bearer%20of%20the%20Curse\"&gt;Bearer of the Curse&lt;/a&gt; must best the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20Watcher%20and%20Defender\"&gt;Throne Watcher and Defender&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nashandra\"&gt;Nashandra&lt;/a&gt; to become a true monarch and claim the Throne. However, if the player has killed &lt;a href=\"Vendrick\"&gt;Vendrick&lt;/a&gt; before Nashandra, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Aldia\"&gt;Aldia&lt;/a&gt; will appear as the final boss.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Herald\"&gt;Emerald Herald&lt;/a&gt; also makes an appearance at the Throne\u2019s entrance where she reveals her true name. In the aftermath, either she or &lt;a href=\"Aldia%2C%20Scholar%20of%20the%20First%20Sin\"&gt;Aldia&lt;/a&gt; will narrate the game\u2019s ending.\nThe area can only be accessed through use of the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Ring\"&gt;King's Ring&lt;/a&gt;.

They are the ideal weapons for getting through the heavy armor or scales of an enemy, and their unique attack motion allows for very rapid attacks. Their running attack is also a lunge, giving them a farther reach compared to most other swords. \nWhile the pinpoint precision thrusting swords make them very effective against armor, the impact area of the strikes is very small, which means that attacks can be easily evaded or blocked, also making them generally poor candidates for dead-angling. To get the most out of these weapons, they should be used with a counterattacking style that tries to interrupt an opponent's attack once it has begun.\nSome thrusting swords deal very high &lt;a href=\"critical\"&gt;critical&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"riposte\"&gt;riposte&lt;/a&gt;) damage, similar to &lt;a href=\"daggers\"&gt;daggers&lt;/a&gt; in that regard.\nLike curved swords, thrusting swords have their own unique animation that replaces the kick attack. The player makes a horizontal swipe combined with a &lt;a href=\"backstep\"&gt;backstep&lt;/a&gt;. Also like curved swords, thrusting swords can be used to &lt;a href=\"parry\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt; when wielded in the left hand. \nThrusting Swords.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nDetailed=\nCondensed=\nUpgraded=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

While their base damage seems to be low compared with slashing weapons, these weapons make up with their high &lt;a href=\"critical\"&gt;critical&lt;/a&gt; damage and low &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; consumption. Thrusting Swords are also very fast when attacking with one; however, they can be blocked extremely easily for long periods of time, due to their low impact power. The small hit area of a Thrusting Sword also means it can be dodged quite easily.\nThese weapons generally &lt;a href=\"Scaling%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;scale&lt;/a&gt; better with &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; than they do with &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, except\u00a0for the &lt;a href=\"Estoc%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Estoc&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mail%20Breaker%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Mail Breaker&lt;/a&gt;.

The wind can also be used to manipulate foes' positions, rather than simply staggering them in place.\nOnline gameplay.\nCombined with the Storm Curved Sword's longer reach, this allows the wielder to more easily catch opponents with this skill. As above, it is useful for fouling attempts to parry the weapon, and punish them accordingly.\nUsing the full skill to knock an opponent over can give opportunities to hit them with an &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Hunter%20Charm\"&gt;Undead Hunter Charm&lt;/a&gt; on wake-up, or set up other follow-ups.

Regardless, it is the third-lightest greatshield in the game, and the lightest greatshield that provides 100% damage reduction against physical attacks.\nInterestingly, the Tower Shield has the highest &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt; of any shield in the game when upgraded to full of the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;Crystal&lt;/a&gt; path, having a final stability of 90; out-classing &lt;a href=\"Havel%27s%20Greatshield\"&gt;Havel's Greatshield&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Greatshield%20of%20Artorias\"&gt;Greatshield of Artorias&lt;/a&gt; in terms of stability. However, doing so reduces its &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; down to 30 and prevents it from being repaired, making it extremely cost-inefficient.\nWhen upgraded down the &lt;a href=\"Standard%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;Standard&lt;/a&gt; path, the Tower Shield boasts one of the highest stability values of all greatshields with a maximum value of 86; it is followed by the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Iron%20Greatshield\"&gt;Black Iron Greatshield&lt;/a&gt; at 85 stability, and is beat only by the &lt;a href=\"Greatshield%20of%20Artorias\"&gt;Greatshield of Artorias&lt;/a&gt; at 88. The Tower Shield has heavy deflection and a standard bash attack. \nResistance Defense.\nAlong with Physical and &lt;a href=\"Elemental\"&gt;Elemental&lt;/a&gt; damage reduction, weapons also have hidden stats that reduce the amount of status build-up while blocking."}

{"id": "134025", "revid": "1188343", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=134025", "title": "Toxic (Dark Souls III)", "text": "Toxic is a &lt;a href=\"Negative%20Status%20Effects%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;negative status effect&lt;/a&gt; caused by &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, spells, or attacks from certain within the game.\nOverview.\nIf Toxic is inflicted on the player, a status bar will appear on the HUD indicating current level of buildup. Once the bar fills up, the effect procs, inflicting the player with strong damage over time and a stamina regeneration penalty. A player's resistance to Toxic buildup is equal to their resistance to &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; buildup.\nThere are two strains of Toxic: Environmental Toxic, and Player Toxic.\nEnvironmental Toxic.\nEnvironmental Toxic occurs when the source that procs Toxic is from an environmental hazard or a non-human enemy; that is, any source that is not player-based. When inflicted with Environmental Toxic, the player suffers from the following:\nThe two sources of Ground Toxic are the swamp in the &lt;a href=\"Profaned%20Capital\"&gt;Profaned Capital&lt;/a&gt;, and the ground in the &lt;a href=\"Consumed%20King%27s%20Garden\"&gt;Consumed King's Garden&lt;/a&gt;. Projectile Toxic is inflicted by the mist breath attacks of dagger-wielding &lt;a href=\"Smouldering%20Ghru\"&gt;Smouldering Ghru&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Smouldering%20Lake\"&gt;Smouldering Lake&lt;/a&gt;, the spitting attacks of &lt;a href=\"Sewer%20Centipede\"&gt;Sewer Centipede&lt;/a&gt;s, the vomit attacks of &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Corvian%20Settler\"&gt;Forlorn Corvian Settler&lt;/a&gt;s and the breath attacks of the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Prince\"&gt;Demon Prince&lt;/a&gt; in the first phase.\nEnvironmental Toxic persists for 300 seconds, or 5 minutes, unless cured. If not cured, it can inflict a tremendous amount of damage:\nPlayer Toxic.\nPlayer Toxic occurs when the source of the Toxic proc is from a consumable or spell cast by an enemy player, or from a self-proc. Player Toxic is significantly shorter, but also deals increased damage over time to make up for it. When a player is inflicted with Player Toxic, they suffer the following effects:\nDepending on the source, Player Toxic will last for either 60 seconds (if inflicted by &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20Mist%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Toxic Mist&lt;/a&gt;), or 90 seconds (if inflicted by &lt;a href=\"Dung%20Pie%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dung Pie&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stalk%20Dung%20Pie\"&gt;Stalk Dung Pie&lt;/a&gt;). A self-inflicted Toxic from any form of Dung Pie will persist for up to 60 seconds. Left unchecked, Player Toxic will inflict varying amounts of damage:\nToxic resistance improvement.\nNon-armor equipment, particularly &lt;a href=\"Poisonbite%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poisonbite Ring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fleshbite%20Ring\"&gt;Fleshbite Ring&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Knight%27s%20Greatshield\"&gt;Wolf Knight's Greatshield&lt;/a&gt;, will not improve Toxic resistance."}

This is due to the fact that there are only two sources of Toxic that the player can use, one being Toxic Mist, a relatively slow casting pyromancy, and &lt;a href=\"Mytha%27s%20Bent%20Blade\"&gt;the other&lt;/a&gt; being a &lt;a href=\"Daggers%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;dagger&lt;/a&gt; that is lackluster outside of its Toxic build-up.\u00a0As such, if the Toxic isn't inflicted, then it's a waste of a spell slot. In contrast, Poison Mist can stack with &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;poison arrows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Throwing%20Knife%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;poison throwing knives&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29%23Poison%20weapons\"&gt;poison weapons&lt;/a&gt; in general, to put pressure on opponents. As such, it is recommended to use Toxic Mist in small areas or on slow opponents.\nAlthough its intended purpose is somewhat limited in &lt;a href=\"Player%20versus%20Player%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, Toxic Mist can still be great for area denial, and as a means of hiding the caster's follow up attacks. In PvE, it is far more effective however, as enemies don't actively try to avoid the mist. This helps with racking up damage on sturdier foes, such as the &lt;a href=\"Smelter%20Demon\"&gt;Smelter Demon&lt;/a&gt;, who are generally susceptible to poisons.\n&lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; and Toxic can be applied at the same time on the same target. They do not cancel each other out, but rather increase the rate of health degeneration. \nTrivia.\nThis spell is cast with a forward gesture of the hand holding the &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20Flames\"&gt;Pyromancy Flame&lt;/a&gt;. This is in contrast to the casting animation in &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20Mist%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20Mist%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;, where it is exhaled from the caster's mouth.\nAttunement milestones.\nLike all other spells, the amount of casts per slot increases upon reaching certain &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Attunement&lt;/a&gt; milestones:"}

The cloud persists for 6 seconds.\nBuildup is static and is not affected by rings or spell buffs."}

If this is because they drop less items or not is not yet known. To farm these enemies, one should start at the chapel threshold bonfire. From there they should walk back towards the church where the prowling magus and congregation boss fight just was. From there to the right is the cliff leading deeper into the canyon and closest to the church is a small building with clay pots. The player should drop down here, walk through the door, to the back of the room through the door barred by the dresser and table through the 2 wooden doors, the second opening up behind a parasitized undead (one can try attacking him if they wish). Then, to the right along a narrow pathway is another one down below, again, the player can attack or knock off this enemy if they wish, then they should drop down to where the second enemy just was then they should then turn around walking back and through the large opening into a room filled with about 3 or 4 depending where the first undead dropped down. Using this method and item drop boosting equipment such as the jester/explore hat and the prisoners tatters (and a bit of luck) will get the player the entire set if not a few extra in merely a few tries."}

Possessing both weapons in one's inventory, speak to Ludleth of Courland when he is in possession of the &lt;a href=\"Transposing%20Kiln\"&gt;Transposing Kiln&lt;/a&gt; to unlock additional dialogue. The two weapons can then be joined to create the Twin Princes' Greatsword, sacrificing both in the process.\nCharacteristics.\nAs its name and method of acquisition suggest, this greatsword is a mix between Lothric's Holy Sword and Lorian's Greatsword. It possesses the Bastard Sword's move set, utilizing far reaching horizontal sweeps as its strong attacks and normal greatsword light attacks that can benefit from poise. This weapon's base damage is relatively weak due to its damage being split between physical and fire, and as it is a soul-transposed weapon, this cannot be mitigated by infusion.\nCompensating for its comparitively low base damage is its unique weapon art. While in its weapon art stance (parry button), you are able to perform either the fast, long-ranged weapon art of Lothric's Holy Sword, or the slow but powerful, hyper armoured weapon art of Lorian's Greatsword. This allows the weapon to mix up its attacks and confuse opponents. The highly spammable Sacred Light (parry button &gt; light attack) gives it a much longer theoretical range than any other greatsword. Sacred Flame, (parry button &gt; heavy attack) though comparably less useful than Sacred Light, is a solid move for some rare situations where burst damage and hyper armour are called for.\nSo the strength of this weapon is its weapon art's versatility. Sacred Light can be used in a manner similar to Lightning Arrow, making it a useful finishing move for evasive opponents. Meanwhile, Sacred Flame grants more hyper armour than any greathammer attack except for their charged R2s and weapon arts, allowing the wielder to poise through a 2-handed R1 from Morne's Great Hammer with only 23.09 poise. It also \"deals\" a whopping 46.8 poise damage. This means if someone attacks you with Ledo's Great Hammer's R1 and you hit them with Sacred Flame during their attack animation, they will be stunned out of the animation unless they have at least 29.71 poise. This combination means, with a single weapon, you have a ranged, almost lightning arrow-like attack, as well as an attack comparable to a greathammer of more than double the weight. That kind of versatility can be very useful in PvP, provided you can get past the damage being weaker on standard attacks than most greatswords'.\nUnfortunately, despite Sacred Light dealing magic damage (even though the near-identical weapon art on Lothric's Holy Sword deals physical damage) the damage is not increased by the Magic Clutch Ring, Crown of Dusk, etc. However, it also deals physical damage if it hits at close range, which is affected by the Leo Ring if the opponent is attacking or under the instability effect. The fire damage, on the other hand, including both the base damage and the Sacred Flame damage, is affected by items that boost fire damage. Unlike Lorian's Greatsword, Sacred Flame does not add a lingering fire damage buff to the weapon and does not launch targets into the air. Like the Wolf Knight's Greatsword's stanced heavy attack, Sacred Flame is rarely the most practical attack animation, but it still does very high damage, poise damage, and guard break damage compared to many other greatsword weapon arts.\nVideos.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

Requiring only 10 Strength, and 16 Dexterity, the Uchigatana has the lowest requirements of all available katanas in Dark Souls II. With a weight of only 5.0 units, it is the second lightest katana, the lightest being &lt;a href=\"Darkdrift\"&gt;Darkdrift&lt;/a&gt;.\nInterestingly, the Uchigatana has exactly the same stats, scaling, and moveset as the &lt;a href=\"Manslayer\"&gt;Manslayer&lt;/a&gt;. The only differences between the two katanas are that the Manslayer weighs one unit more than the Uchigatana, has higher requirements, and has innate poison damage. It is also worth noting that the Uchigatana upgrades with regular Titanite, unlike the Manslayer which upgrades with &lt;a href=\"Twinkling%20Titanite%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Twinkling Titanite&lt;/a&gt;. The Uchigatana can also be obtained significantly earlier than the Manslayer, and is the superior choice for infusions. Also unlike the Manslayer, consumable buffs such as various pine resins and &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Serum\"&gt;Bleeding Serum&lt;/a&gt; can be applied to the Uchigatana. "}

Its combination of slashes and a powerful thrust on the one-handed strong attack give it a versatile moveset not unlike that of the &lt;a href=\"Long%20Sword\"&gt;Long Sword&lt;/a&gt;, while the advancing slash of the &lt;a href=\"Hold\"&gt;Hold&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; provides an offensive option for closing distance with, or keeping up with, an opponent, as well as a wide horizontal attack that can be useful against multiple opponents, or single agile ones. Furthermore, Hold provides a strong &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt;, meaning &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Skill\"&gt;Weapon Skill&lt;/a&gt; can be used without entirely eliminating the option to parry, though the sheathing animation of Hold makes it far less accessible than a shield that can parry on its own.\nFurthermore, it is the earliest attainable katana in the game, and thus is a good starting weapon for &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt; builds, though obtaining it from the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20Master\"&gt;Sword Master&lt;/a&gt; can prove challenging at the start of a playthrough. As such players struggling to obtain the Uchigatana may want to consider the wide selection of Dexterity-focused weapons that can be bought from the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20Handmaid\"&gt;Shrine Handmaid&lt;/a&gt;.

This means that upgrading this weapon is not worth going through the trouble and that it is an amazing weapon from the moment it is picked up.\nUnfortunately this weapon cannot be infused (as it would probably be too powerful) but can be buffed.\nUmbral Dagger, when using &lt;a href=\"Power%20Stance\"&gt;power stance&lt;/a&gt; attacks or guard breaks (as they are copied from &lt;a href=\"Mytha%27s%20Bent%20Blade\"&gt;Mytha's Bent Blade&lt;/a&gt;), has the distinction of being one of the only two weapons in the game able to inflict the &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Toxic&lt;/a&gt; status, which does significantly higher damage than poison with the trade off of having fewer means to build up the status.

He will be standing next to a bridge wearing the &lt;a href=\"Catarina%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Catarina Set&lt;/a&gt;, attempting to trick the player into believing that he is a knight of Catarina and that he has spotted treasure on the other side of the bridge. Upon reaching the middle of the bridge, a cutscene occurs where Patches will lower it in an attempt to have the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Slave\"&gt;Giant Slave&lt;/a&gt;s kill the player. If they have already killed both giants, he will scold them for doing so.\nAt the end of the cutscene, Patches will remove the armor and relocate to the opposite side of the bridge, shortly before the room where &lt;a href=\"Rosaria%2C%20Mother%20of%20Rebirth\"&gt;Rosaria, Mother of Rebirth&lt;/a&gt; is met. The player can only access this area of the cathedral by taking the elevator up near the Cleansing Chapel and navigating the cathedral rooftops and catwalks before dropping down. Upon talking to Patches in this location, he will pretend as if he has never met the player before. Upon confronting him about the matter (e.g., choosing the \"You know who I am\" option), he will claim that the armor possessed him, and he will grant the player the \"Prostration\" &lt;a href=\"Gestures%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;gesture&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Rusted%20Coin%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Rusted Coin&lt;/a&gt; as way of apology. After this, Patches will become a &lt;a href=\"Merchant%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe above encounter will not occur should the player take the elevator to the cathedral roof from the Cleansing Chapel and access that part of the cathedral first.\nIf Patches does not show up his first encounter will be at the Firelink Shrine trap.\nFirelink Shrine trap.\nPatches can be encountered later at &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt;. If the player enters the tower adjacent to the shrine (the one which requires the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20Key%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Tower Key&lt;/a&gt;) and takes the elevator to the top of the belfry, Patches will close the gate and lock it behind the player. Returning to the gate and talking to Patches will cause him to taunt the player, stating his intention to loot the player's corpse when they die in the tower. The only way out is to reach the bottom of the tower by dropping down onto the coffins (&lt;a href=\"Spook\"&gt;Spook&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Silvercat%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Silvercat Ring&lt;/a&gt; will help) that stick out of the wall, or by using a bonfire warping ability (&lt;a href=\"Homeward%20Bone%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Homeward Bone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darksign%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Darksign&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Homeward%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Homeward&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Coiled%20Sword%20Fragment\"&gt;Coiled Sword Fragment&lt;/a&gt;). Alternatively, dying will simply respawn the player at the most recent bonfire, most likely that within Firelink Shrine.\nUpon returning to the initial meeting place, the player can re-open the gate but Patches will be gone; he will have relocated to the upper level of the shrine, on the right side near the Giant Tree (the player may need to leave and re-enter the area, triggering a loading screen in the process, to cause him to spawn there). If the player confronts him here and refuses to forgive him, he will give them with a &lt;a href=\"Rusted%20Gold%20Coin\"&gt;Rusted Gold Coin&lt;/a&gt; as a form of apology, and will provide his mercantile services here for the remainder of the game. Should the player have not encountered him in the Cathedral of the Deep, he will also teach \"Prostration\" here.\nUpon reloading the area, talking to Patches while he is squatting at his usual location will reward the player the \"Patches squat\" &lt;a href=\"Gestures%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;gesture&lt;/a&gt;.\nRescuing Greirat.\nTalking to Patches while he is a merchant at Firelink Shrine will reveal that he and &lt;a href=\"Greirat%20of%20the%20Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Greirat of the Undead Settlement&lt;/a&gt; are acquaintances. If the player has sent Greirat to pillage &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt;, Patches can be asked to save him. If the player has not purchased the full Catarina Set from Patches, and tells Patches about Greirat's whereabouts when asked (this occurs once an instance of Firelink Shrine has been loaded where Greirat has disappeared from his normal location), Patches will also disappear from Firelink Shrine. Upon beating an area &lt;a href=\"Boss%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; while both are missing from Firelink Shrine (e.g. the location must be reloaded and Patches be absent from his spot), both Patches and Greirat will return.\nA similar event occurs if Greirat is sent to pillage &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;Lothric Castle&lt;/a&gt;; the player can choose to tell Patches of this, and he will leave Firelink until an area boss is defeated. Upon his return, he will sell a &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Blessing\"&gt;Hidden Blessing&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "111211", "revid": "49243392", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=111211", "title": "Undead", "text": "In \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\", to be Undead means that the victim has died, but has been reanimated. Most Undead were sent to the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Asylum\"&gt;Undead Asylum&lt;/a&gt; and imprisoned to await the end of the world. Undeath is seen as a curse or a disease by the living.\nCauses (WIP).\nThe curse of undeath was created when &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Cinder&lt;/a&gt; and Ruler of the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Age of Fire&lt;/a&gt;, began to feel threatened by the kin of the &lt;a href=\"Furtive%20Pygmy\"&gt;Furtive Pigmy&lt;/a&gt;: humans were immortal beings, born from the Dark yet able to live in a world enlightened by the Fire, whose souls did not lose power despite being endlessly splitted and multiplied. The Gods were although aware that humans, both because of their obliviousness regarding their true might and because the immense military might of Anor Londo, could not have yet posed a significative threat to their realm: therefore, a complex and ingenious apparatus was set in motion with the goal to mold humanity into a subservient, weak people that would not only serve the Age of Fire, but also refused to relinquish it to make way for the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Dark\"&gt;Age of Dark&lt;/a&gt;. The knights of the human armies were the first ones to be marked with a &lt;a href=\"Darksign\"&gt;Sigil of Fire&lt;/a&gt; that would contain their Darkness and numb their abilities\u00a0. The strength of the Fire was strong enough to leave an imprinted mark that would become, through few generations, genetically inherited by every newborn. \nThe seal restrains the Darkness within the man, and once the consciousness of that part of the self is lost, &lt;a href=\"Humanity%20%28item%29\"&gt;Humanity&lt;/a&gt;'s presence and nature remains unknown, its abilities nullified, its feelings ignored, its role forgotten. When a human dies, its darkness is not strong enough to keep it alive and death affects men just as it would do with any other creatures born from the Fire. However, their Humanity is still present within their bodies and, unless it gets pillaged, there shall remain forever. \nWhen the Fire begins to fade, its strength is not sufficient to contain the Humanity any further and the immortal darkness brings them back from death. Although, Humanity had never been acknowledged, understood and trained, and after a lifetime spent constricted is deprived of any lucidity and control: and, most importantly, it holds no trace of the self, like the soul did. Therefore, gathering souls is essential to retain sanity for strength is the only defense against mind's decay.\nHow undeath is triggered is unknown, as not all the deads we encounter have been brought back to life, but it almost always occurs regardless of the victim's intentions. However, some individuals like &lt;a href=\"Solaire%20of%20Astora\"&gt;Solaire of Astora&lt;/a&gt; willingly embraced undeath. All those that become Undead show the trace of the &lt;a href=\"Darksign\"&gt;Darksign&lt;/a&gt;.\nSymptoms.\nUnlike the living, the Undead do not perish with death; instead, they are resurrected at &lt;a href=\"bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;bonfires&lt;/a&gt;. However, in time they gradually lose their sanity and intelligence - called Hollowing - unless they can procure souls. The process of hollowing covers many stages of sanity and consciousness, until the last trace of identity is lost. An Undead that has fully lost their sanity is known as a Hollow. \nHollows.\n&lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;Hollow&lt;/a&gt;s are universally hostile to lucid individuals, including other Undeads.\nAnother effect of undeath is the gradual decay of the body over time; this effect is reversed when hollowing is reversed with the absorption of &lt;a href=\"Humanity%20%28item%29\"&gt;Humanity&lt;/a&gt; and its use at bonfires to reverse hollowing: however do note that at a certain point hollowing itself becomes irreversible. It is also mentioned by Aldia that the \"illusion of love\" is said to cease when the Darksign touches a human's flesh.\u00a0\nUndeath is usually reversed whenever the Fire gains enough strength to enforce the sigil over the darkness, which usually happens with every new Linking of Fire. However, powerful beings that have acknowledged how to control their humanity are presumably able to maintain their natural state and avoid death: such people are often revered as &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Lord\"&gt;Dark Lords&lt;/a&gt;. \nSocial status.\nAs a general rule, the Undead are treated with hostility by the living. Game lore suggests that Undead are hunted down by followers of &lt;a href=\"Allfather%20Lloyd\"&gt;Allfather Lloyd&lt;/a&gt; in the lands of the living, who round them up and send them to an &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Undead%20Asylum\"&gt;asylum&lt;/a&gt; with no hope of release. Many of the characters the player meets mention the stigma they faced from the rest of society before they left their former homes.\nHowever, some Undead were treated with respect. For example; &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20Leeroy\"&gt;Paladin Leeroy&lt;/a&gt;, the first Undead from the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20White\"&gt;Way of White&lt;/a&gt;, was granted the treasures of &lt;a href=\"Grant\"&gt;Grant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sanctus\"&gt;Sanctus&lt;/a&gt; by his order."}

The wrappings around their mouth are covered in blood.\nStrategy.\nUndead Citizens pose a serious threat when they're first encountered and remain dangerous throughout the course of the game. Their most common method of attack is to run towards the player, dive, and cause an explosion upon landing. This deals heavy damage to both health and, if blocked, stamina which causes players to stagger. They're usually encountered in groups of 3 or more which can easily kill a good number of players early on. The Undead Citizen's melee attack is not to be dismissed either although it is easy to dodge.\nOne way to know if Undead Citizens are around is to listen for the sound of rattling chains. As soon as it becomes audible pay attention to corners and tight spaces as they are often residing in such areas, usually sitting down, which gives the player a window of opportunity to kill them. \nThe key to dealing with Undead Citizens is to dodge just as they land on the floor as there is a split second window before the explosion happens. Avoid being swarmed, since a dodge will likely avoid only one explosion. \nAnother strategy is to use weapons with high damage and long reach and attacking just as they are preparing to jump, as this will most likely stop their attack and kill them, due to their small HP. If they are closing in fast, or the player is on alert, switching to a bow or crossbow, or even a long ranged spell can be an excellent idea, notice however that there is no sure way to dealing with them if they coming in as a group, in this situation, your safest bet is to just circle around them around the area, and taking them out one by one, but always while exercising extreme caution. If the player has area of effect weaponry such as Urns or spells, then it is advised to use them, the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Water%20Urn\"&gt;Holy Water Urn&lt;/a&gt; is especially effective (while having a fairly low cost) beware, however, of its low range. A single &lt;a href=\"Throwing%20Knife%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Throwing Knife&lt;/a&gt; can also kill them, given a moderate amount of physical stats for scaling. \nAdditionally, if the player has any &lt;a href=\"Alluring%20Skull%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Alluring Skulls&lt;/a&gt; in his/her inventory or the &lt;a href=\"Yearn\"&gt;Yearn&lt;/a&gt; spell, it is advised to use them against groups; focus on one of them, and use it on it, this will cause all of the group to throw themselves at that spot, which a player can take advantage of by then using the aforementioned Holy Water Urn or any Area of Effect source of damage."}

Despite their short stature, they are aggressive opponents that can perform a powerful grapple attack.\nSome clerics have dark crystals growing from their bodies which inflict rapid &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt; build-up.

However, they often appear in packs or alongside stronger opponents, and can be much more dangerous if they mob the player. They will also hang from ledges or play dead in an attempt to ambush the player.\nThey attack rapidly with their stakes and will often leap backward to avoid counterattacks or shove the player as a defensive maneuver. Their grab attack is preceded by a scream where they will leap above the player and try to tackle them to the ground, stabbing them several times if they succeed. This grab attack is usually performed if they see the player holding up a &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;. They may also cast &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning Spear&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Stake\"&gt;Lightning Stake&lt;/a&gt; depending on the situation, and will possess &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt; when casting Lightning Stake.\nThe crystallized variant will not attempt to attack the player, but rather will slowly approach them. They emit a constant &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt; aura, which can quickly petrify a player if left alone, and even if quickly dispatched can still cause considerable buildup, allowing another crystallized Undead Cleric to finish the job."}

She will curse and taunt the player, and refuse to sell any more items. However, she can be killed if the player kills her in one hit."}

It is easiest to attack them from behind as they cannot turn easily.\nAt a distance they will occasionally toss fireballs at the player, and at close range can perform a powerful grab attack where they choke the player before slamming them into the ground. One should be cautious, as these two attacks have nearly identical windup.

Players are either pitted against each other in a free-for-all battle, or divided into two teams of equal size.\nAll participants appear as &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;phantoms&lt;/a&gt;, matching whatever kind of phantom their active &lt;a href=\"Covenant%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt; has. For example, a &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Darkmoon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Blade of the Darkmoon&lt;/a&gt; will appear as a blue phantom, while a &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20of%20Sunlight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Warrior of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; will appear as a golden phantom. Equipping &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20Blue%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Way of Blue&lt;/a&gt; or no covenant will make the character take on the appearance of a host.\nThese online battles are similar to those found in previous games, with the exception that there are no special arenas designed specifically for them this time around, and instead they take place in normal locations visited during the main game, such as the &lt;a href=\"Kiln%20of%20the%20First%20Flame%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Kiln of the First Flame&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archdragon%20Peak\"&gt;Archdragon Peak&lt;/a&gt;.\nWinning multiple times will reward the player with an insignia next to their name which represents the amount of victories they have accumulated on that character. There are two insignias, one for free-for-all and one for team fights. No items or &lt;a href=\"Souls%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; are awarded during or after an Undead Match. Similarly, souls won't be lost nor will &lt;a href=\"hollowing\"&gt;hollowing&lt;/a&gt; increase if the player dies within an Undead Match, although consumed items will not be restored, and broken equipment will not be repaired.\nModes.\nDuel\n1 versus 1 (for honor ranks)\nArenas.\nThere are four arenas taken from the main game where players can participate in an Undead Match:"}

If the player uses light weapons, the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Ring\"&gt;Stone Ring&lt;/a&gt; can help. Their attacks are very slow and easy to dodge, leaving them vulnerable to &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;s. However, their hammer smashes can inflict heavy damage and can slow down the player on impact, these can be very dangerous if cornered or if traversing a narrow ledge.\nThey are very susceptible to &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;, and are usually found in areas where several poison-filled urns are found.

However, trading against enemies is not advised, rather it is a better idea to manipulate their AI to dodge their attacks and then cast while they are unable to retaliate.\nOnline gameplay.\nThis skill is crucial for being able to inflict any damage with Miracles that require the caster to be at point-blank range, such as &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Stake\"&gt;Lightning Stake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Storm\"&gt;Lightning Storm&lt;/a&gt;. Under normal circumstances, one should attempt to use this skill in such a way that only one attack from &lt;a href=\"Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;greatsword&lt;/a&gt;-sized weapons or larger is incurred in the process, as any more risks taking more damage than the opposing player or being Poise-broken; similarly, multiple opponents attacking simultaneously can easily stagger a caster out of this skill, wasting FP and costing time and HP. It is also important to remember that in order for a trade to be successful, the Miracle used must inflict damage greater than that incurred by the caster, meaning that a high amount of &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt; and using the proper catalyst is usually necessary for this skill to be useful.\nWhen used to cast Miracles that require the player to remain stationary for a long period of time such as &lt;a href=\"Great%20Heal%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Great Heal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Pillars%20of%20Light\"&gt;Divine Pillars of Light&lt;/a&gt;, it is important to place one's back against an object if possible, as smart opponents can simply run around and &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt; the caster."}

Like &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;the Undead&lt;/a&gt;, they are cursed with &lt;a href=\"undeath\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt;, and branded with the &lt;a href=\"Darksign%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;darksign&lt;/a&gt;. With &lt;a href=\"Lothric%2C%20Younger%20Prince\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt; having refused to link the Flame, the Lords of Cinder are resurrected to fuel it; but with the Lords having left their thrones and abandoned their duty, Unkindled are resurrected to seek them out and bring the Lords back to their thrones.\nThose who are Unkindled appear to be a sort of opposite to the Undead seen in other games: whereas the Undead seek &lt;a href=\"Humanities\"&gt;Humanities&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Human%20Effigies\"&gt;Human Effigies&lt;/a&gt;, objects comprised of some form of &lt;a href=\"The%20Dark\"&gt;darkness&lt;/a&gt;, Unkindled seek &lt;a href=\"Ember\"&gt;Ember&lt;/a&gt;s, small remnants of flame.

That is the reason why Gundyr is not yet \"Iudex\", \"judge of the ash\": &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Gundyr\"&gt;Gundyr&lt;/a&gt; was a champion who \"came too late\" and was \"greeted by a shrine without fire, and a bell that would not toll.\". He was bested by an unknown warrior and became the sheath of a &lt;a href=\"Coiled%20Sword\"&gt;Coiled Sword&lt;/a&gt;, in the hopes that someday, the &lt;a href=\"first%20flame\"&gt;first flame&lt;/a&gt; would be linked once more.\nThe Queen of Lothric is said to have enshrined the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Estus%20Ring\"&gt;Ashen Estus Ring&lt;/a&gt; in the \"Cemetery of Untended Graves,\" so that it one day could benefit an &lt;a href=\"Unkindled\"&gt;Unkindled&lt;/a&gt;.

If she is first spoken to in the Untended Graves, then introduced in Firelink Shrine afterwards, the Handmaid will greet the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20One\"&gt;Ashen One&lt;/a&gt; by saying \"Oh thou'rt...\" which suggests that she recognizes them.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20a%20Fire%20Keeper\"&gt;Eyes of a Fire Keeper&lt;/a&gt; are found in the flameless shrine of the Untended Graves, behind an illusory wall, on a corpse covered in cloth. The &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20Handmaid\"&gt;Shrine Handmaid&lt;/a&gt; in the Untended Graves mentions a captive, poor girl, possibly referring to the corpse. When &lt;a href=\"Ludleth%20of%20Courland\"&gt;Ludleth of Courland&lt;/a&gt; talks about the eyes, he mentions that the Ashen One found \"her\" and the \"black eyes that shimmer within.\" He also mentions that \"we did all we could to spare her from them,\" implying that the corpse belongs to the first Fire Keeper, and that Ludleth knew her. It is possible, then, that Ludleth was the Lord who linked the Fire in that time, preventing the imminent fading of the Flame to occur and becoming a Lord of Cinder.\nBonfires.\nThe Untended Graves are a subsection of the &lt;a href=\"Cemetery%20of%20Ash\"&gt;Cemetery of Ash&lt;/a&gt; and comprises the following &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfires&lt;/a&gt;:"}

However, Valorheart truly shines when it is two-handed, equipping the shield in the off-hand and completely changing its moveset in the process.\nStandard attacks, as well as rolling and jumping attacks, will utilize the shield to block while attacking, drastically reducing any damage taken when attacking at the same time as the opponent. At the same time, the rolling and jumping two-handed attacks, as well as the standard attack from the &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; stance, will inflict &lt;a href=\"Thrust%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Thrusting&lt;/a&gt; damage, allowing the wielder to &lt;a href=\"Counter%20Attack\"&gt;Counter Attack&lt;/a&gt; the opponent. This makes the weapon extremely strong for performing trades against opponents wielding weapons of equal size, the shield greatly reducing the damage taken while also inflicting full damage against the enemy. It finds its niche when wielded by highly aggressive players, as they can close the range to their opponents and use the shield to block attacks while throwing themselves recklessly at the enemy.\nHowever, as a result of heavy reliance on the shield, Valorheart is extremely stamina-hungry, requiring its wielder to invest heavily into &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt; if they do not want to be guard-broken during trades. As well, the lion shield fares poorly against &lt;a href=\"Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;greatsword&lt;/a&gt;-sized weapons and larger, as even during successfully blocked trades the wielder will still take a considerable amount of damage and lose large amounts of stamina, putting them at great risk of being &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;riposted&lt;/a&gt;. And finally, the shield has poor elemental absorption, meaning that an opponent wielding an &lt;a href=\"Infusion%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;infused&lt;/a&gt; weapon, even of equal size to Valorheart, can still come out on top of trades by cutting straight through its elemental defenses.\nMoveset.\n&lt;br&gt;\nUpgrades.\n&lt;br&gt;\nTrivia.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

Some were captured by a former king and forced to do hard labor in &lt;a href=\"No-man%27s%20Wharf\"&gt;No-man's Wharf&lt;/a&gt;.

They usually fight in groups so you should try to dispatch them quickly before they get together. They will also throw flammable flasks on you, this will cover you in &lt;a href=\"Oil%20%28status%20effect%29\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt; that will cause an explosion (and massive damage) should you light a torch or be struck by a fire arrow. If low on health they can use an &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt; to recover full health.\nVarangian Sailors have low &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt; and can be staggered easily by repeated attacks. They are also very vulnerable to &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;s and have a 0% resistance to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;, so any fire-infused weapons or items, such as &lt;a href=\"Charcoal%20Pine%20Resin%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Charcoal Pine Resins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Firebomb%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Firebombs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;pyromancies&lt;/a&gt; will deal full damage."}

In addition, each spell type is associated with a magic type: &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; for sorcery, &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; for miracles, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; for pyromancy, and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; for hexes.\nCasting a spell sometimes necessitates meeting the minimum &lt;a href=\"Stats%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29%23Attributes\"&gt;attribute&lt;/a&gt; requirements: &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; for sorceries, &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt; for miracles, and a mixture of both Intelligence and Faith for hexes. Pyromancies are unique in that they have no attribute requirements to cast.\nIndividual spells are represented as consumable scrolls, and must be attuned (or equipped) at a bonfire before they can be cast. Spell uses are replenished by either resting at a bonfire or by using various &lt;a href=\"Miscellaneous%20Items%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29%23Restorative%20items\"&gt;restorative items&lt;/a&gt;. To increase attunement slots, one must increase the &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Attunement&lt;/a&gt; attribute. Attunement also influences spell casting time and spell uses. Spell uses can also be increased by attuning more than one copy of the same spell."}

This number is determined by the amount of &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt; of the player (and in the case of one Staff, &lt;a href=\"Luck\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt;).\nA Staff with 130 Spell Buff will generally outperform one that has 120, if they were to cast the same &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Sorcery&lt;/a&gt;. The same holds true in any catalyst using their appropriate spell, with exception of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; Spells.\nMechanics.\nBasic mechanics.\nThe only thing that directly influences a catalyst's Spell Buff are the Faith/Intelligence of the player, and as such, when upgrading a catalyst, the &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt; of these stats will rise and so will its overall Spell Buff. The higher the level of the wielder's Intelligence/Faith stats, the higher the numbers of Spell Buff on a given catalyst.\nA catalyst has a base Spell Buff of 100, with additional Spell Buff being added on top of this value based on the scaling of the associated stat(s). If one or both stat requirements are not met, Spell Buff will be set to a flat value of 60 regardless of other circumstances.\nDark spells.\nThough &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; spells can be cast with any compatible catalyst, their effectiveness is greatly increased when casting the spell with a catalyst specially attuned to casting these types of spells (see Dark Catalysts below). They will usually scale with both Intelligence and Faith, making it a very compatible playstyle with a &lt;a href=\"Pyromancy%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Pyromancer&lt;/a&gt;-type build.\nCatalysts that are fit to cast Dark Spells will continue to scale optimally up until 45 each of both Intelligence and Faith.\nThe Spell Buff of a Dark Catalyst scales equally with Intelligence and Faith. Provided that both stats are of equal level, each will provide half of the increased Spell Buff above 100. When used to cast Dark Spells (&lt;a href=\"Gnaw\"&gt;Gnaw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Great%20Deep%20Soul\"&gt;Great Deep Soul&lt;/a&gt;), both halves of the Spell Buff will be used to calculate its potency. However, when casting normal spells (&lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning Spear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Soul Spear&lt;/a&gt;), only the respective associated stat will be used to calculate Spell Buff, reducing the potency of the spell cast.\nIn the case of &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Chime\"&gt;Crystal Chime&lt;/a&gt;, the inverse is true. Although Crystal Chime scales with both Intelligence and Faith, it is ill-suited for casting Dark Spells, and the results of attempting as such will yield severely weakened spells.\nWeapon buffs.\nWhen augmenting the power of a weapon's attacks via spells such as &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Magic%20Weapon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Crystal Magic Weapon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Blade\"&gt;Lightning Blade&lt;/a&gt;, the catalyst's Spell Buff is factored in to calculate the amount of elemental damage that is added. Usually this is expressed as a percentage of the catalyst's Spell Buff, which is then directly added to the weapon's attack power.\nIn the case of special catalysts that scale with more than one stat or which scale with an unusual stat (such as &lt;a href=\"Man-grub%27s%20Staff\"&gt;Man-grub's Staff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Chime\"&gt;Crystal Chime&lt;/a&gt;, the effectiveness of the weapon buff is severely weakened. In the case of off-stat catalysts a flat 100 Spell Buff is used in the calculation, while in the case of dual-scaling catalysts only the half of the Spell Buff which is normally associated with the spell is used in the calculation.\nAdditionally, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Blade\"&gt;Dark Blade&lt;/a&gt;, a Dark buff-type spell, will only factor in the Faith half of a catalyst's Spell Buff, even for Dark Catalysts. Thus, when buffing a weapon with Dark Blade, a talisman or sacred chime that scales purely with Faith will give better results than one that scales with both Intelligence and Faith."}

Performing a strong attack will cause the player to leap forward, somersaulting with the blade and bringing it spinning downwards, culminating with slamming the blade into the ground.\nUsage.\nSingle Player.\nDue to its vertically-focused attack spins, Spin Slash can be useful against single enemies rather than against groups. Its power is more concentrated in a line than the &lt;a href=\"Spin%20Slash%20%28Curved%20Greatsword%29\"&gt;Spin Slash&lt;/a&gt; of the other curved greatswords, and as such it may have trouble hitting multiple targets.\nOnline.\nThis variant of Spin Slash inflicts the same &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; damage as that of the other curved greatswords, however it has stronger forward momentum and is more linearly focused, making it more suitable for use against lone targets who attempt to space out the skill and retaliate. As with all variants of Spin Slash, it cannot be &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parried&lt;/a&gt;, though caution should still be exercised due to the skill leaving the wielder wide open once they land following the jump spin."}

Performing a strong attack will add two more spins, the first being equal in strength to the initial spin and culminating in one final strong spin, inflicting significantly more damage than the first two spins.\nUsage.\nSingle Player.\nBecause the skill carries the wielder forward with each spin, forward momentum can be used to bring a deadly whirling blade into a group of enemies, hitting them up to three times while staggering them the entire time. Be wary that while there is &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt; on this skill, it can be staggered out of with enough concentrated force.\nOnline.\nLike its smaller cousins, the full weapon art cannot be &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parried&lt;/a&gt;, giving the wielder a way to punish players who attempt to parry the attacks. As well, the third spin in the full chain inflicts tremendous &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; damage, which can be useful if an enemy is attempting to trade into the spin.\nBe wary of using this skill if the enemy is free to dodge, as the full chain leaves the wielder completely vulnerable to a backstab at the end of the third spin."}

Inputting a strong attack during or shortly after the spin will transition into a leap that rotates the wielder onto their side, bringing the weapon spinning downward onto enemies to the front. A pool of lava will be left at the impact point, lingering and dealing additional damage.\nUsage.\nSingle Player.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Spin%20Slash%20%28Scimitar%29\"&gt;Spin Slash&lt;/a&gt; used by light curved swords, this skill is useful for bringing powerful focused damage down on a single target. In the case of the Demon's Scar though, the lava pool left by the strong attack can deal even more damage should the enemy linger in it.\nOnline.\nThis skill is distinguished from the Scimitar's Spin Slash in that the lava pool can be exploited as a stage hazard, forcing the enemy player to avoid it lest they take additional damage. This can be useful for making space, or by baiting the enemy into rolling through it into a Pyromancy like &lt;a href=\"Black%20Flame%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Black Flame&lt;/a&gt;."}

Inputting a strong attack during or shortly after the spin will perform two more spins; the first is a short and small spin low to the ground that further inflicts stun on the target, opening them up for the third and final spin, which is stronger and has a larger arc.\nUsage.\nSingle Player.\nThe strong spin on the second part of the skill has great coverage, and can be useful for inflicting tremendous damage to a group of foes in front of the player. Be wary that careful spacing must be observed, as this skill does not grant &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt; and thus can be easily interrupted.\nOnline.\nThe greatest advantage this skill provides is that it is completely un-&lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parriable&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that it can be used to punish players who attempt to parry the weapon's other attacks. Unlike the &lt;a href=\"Scimitar%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Scimitar's&lt;/a&gt; version of Spin Slash, it also does not leave the wielder airborne and vulnerable to punish, and can be useful in fighting ganks due to the wide horizontal coverage of the third spin.\nIt can also be used to punish players who attempt to use their &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt; while within the threat range of this weapon. Should the wielder be able to connect with a two-handed strong attack, they can true combo into the full weapon art, dealing tremendous damage and likely more than cancelling out the entirety of the health recovered."}

Performing a strong attack will bring the swords around for another spin, swinging horizontally with the left-hand sword and then downward with the right-hand sword, then ending with a simultaneous double-thrust with both swords.\nUsage.\nSingle Player.\nThis skill exploits the long reach of the Gotthard Twinswords as well as their varied moveset, allowing the player to quickly bring horizontal and vertical slashes to bear on a target and then follow with a long-ranged thrust.\nOnline.\nUnlike the other variants of Spin Slash, the version performed by the Gotthard Twinswords can be &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parried&lt;/a&gt; during the strong attack phase. However, the initial spin cannot be parried, which is still useful as most players will attempt to prediction-parry the opening attack rather than waiting out the spin before parrying. This characteristic gives the Gotthard Twinswords the unique position of being the only straight sword in the game with an attack that cannot be parried outside of a jumping attack.\nThe double-thrust at the end also allows the wielder to abuse the weapons' long reach to strike at enemies who think they're safe after dodging the initial spins."}

Inputting a strong attack during or shortly after the spin will transition into a leap that rotates the wielder onto their side, bringing the blade spinning downward onto enemies to the front.\nUsage.\nSingle Player.\nThis skill is useful for inflicting focused strong damage to a single target in front of the player. As light curved swords are generally lacking in striking power, this skill allows the wielder to inflict a burst of powerful damage to bear on a target, inflicting strong stagger and &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt; damage on any foes unfortunate enough to be hit by it.\nOnline.\nNo part of this skill can be &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parried&lt;/a&gt;, giving the associated weapons a useful tool to punish parry-happy opponents. The somersault portion of the attack, under unusual circumstances, can also be used to avoid horizontal arcing weapons that swing closer to the ground, turning an otherwise unfortunate trade into an elegant dodging attack."}
{"id": "158820", "revid": "33084951", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=158820", "title": "Spin Slash (Twinblades)", "text": "Spin Slash is a &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\nThis variant of Spin Slash is shared by the &lt;a href=\"Paired%20Weapons\"&gt;paired&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Curved%20Swords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;curved swords&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe wielder brings both blades together into a counter-clockwise spin. Performing a strong attack while the first spin is in motion will execute a second, stronger spin with a wider arc, bringing one blade shortly after the other.\nUsage.\nSingle Player.\nWhile twinblades are adept at inflicting a flurry of attacks on unfortunate targets, each individual swing can lack impact due to being based on light curved swords; as well, the movements of each individual sword can make it hard to hit a single target with both blades in a single swing. This skill brings focus to the table, allowing the wielder to deal focused damage in the same window of time that they could use the paired attacks, as both blades are brought to bear almost simultaneously rather than swinging in separate arcs. Beware, however, that this comes at the cost of dealing less damage than paired weak attacks.\nOnline.\nAgainst human opponents, the Spin Slash is useful for mixing up attacks, presenting a different attack pattern that can throw them off balance. As well, different attack sequences can be used to execute true combos that can stun-lock a target for up to three attacks, rather than two, dealing extreme amounts of damage for a weapon of this class. Like the &lt;a href=\"Scimitar%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Scimitar&lt;/a&gt;-type &lt;a href=\"Spin%20Slash%20%28Scimitar%29\"&gt;Spin Slash&lt;/a&gt;, it cannot be &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parried&lt;/a&gt;, which is important due to twinblade-type weapons giving opponents twice the number of parry windows, one for each swing of the paired attacks."}

A weak attack will bring the sword into a diagonal upward arc from left to right, inflicting heavy stamina damage on a raised &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;. A strong attack will take a few steps toward the target while bringing the sword forward into a lunging upward thrust.\nThe weak attack of this skill costs 17 &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt; to use (13 FP with the &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Ring\"&gt;Farron Ring&lt;/a&gt; equipped), while the strong attack costs 20 FP (15 FP with Farron Ring).\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nThis skill operates similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Stance%20%28Straight%20Sword%29\"&gt;straight sword variant&lt;/a&gt;, but has several differences. As the weapon is larger, it inflicts a greater amount of stamina damage, allowing it to break open shields with even more ease. The strong attack, on the other hand, does not have as much forward momentum and reach as the straight sword variant, giving it less utility.\nOnline gameplay.\nAs most players will wield a greatsword in both hands to take advantage of &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;, opponents are less likely to see through an attempt at using the guard breaking weak attack than with a straight sword. As well, the horizontal arc of the attack allows the wielder to hit multiple targets, which can be useful for either striking at multiple opponents (such as a &lt;a href=\"Host%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Host of Embers&lt;/a&gt; and his phantom) or for spacing and positioning purposes.\nBecause the strong attack has less forward momentum and reach than the straight sword's lunging thrust, it is less useful for chasing down opponents or as a wake-up attack. However, unlike a straight sword it is capable of taking advantage of &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt;, which allows the wielder to push through an enemy attack and use it to come out on top of a trade."}

A weak attack will bring the sword into an upward swinging arc, inflicting heavy stamina damage on a raised &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;. A strong attack will take several steps toward the target while bringing the sword forward into a lunging upward thrust.\nThe weak attack of this skill costs 17 &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt; to use (13 FP with the &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Ring\"&gt;Farron Ring&lt;/a&gt; equipped), while the strong attack costs 20 FP (15 FP with Farron Ring).\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nThe weak attack of this skill can be very useful in breaking the guards of shield-equipped opponents, allowing the player to follow up with an easy &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;riposte&lt;/a&gt;. While it requires FP to perform unlike a kick, greatshield-wielding enemies will generally withstand a single kick unless the player is wearing the &lt;a href=\"Horsehoof%20Ring\"&gt;Horsehoof Ring&lt;/a&gt;. The strong attack allows the player to quickly close the distance with a distant foe, useful for preventing them from performing certain actions.\nOnline gameplay.\nThe guard break of this skill is very useful against shield-wielding opponents as it is much faster than a kick, though it will only work if they have their shield raised; smart players will be cautious around an opponent holding their straight sword in both hands, and will either dodge the guard break attempt or simply put their shield down and take the attack rather than risk suffering a riposte.\nThe lunging thrust attack is useful for running down opponents after performing a successful riposte. As it has strong forward momentum, it can be used as a wake-up attack to catch players who attempt to roll away, giving the wielder a strong chance of killing their opponent before they can safely reach their &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt;."}

The weak attack will perform a backstep and then lunge forward into an upward angling thrust. The strong attack will perform a quick dash forward into three quick thrusts, followed by a delayed but stronger fourth thrust.\nBoth attacks cost 15 &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt; to use (12 FP with the &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Ring\"&gt;Farron Ring&lt;/a&gt; equipped).\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nThe weak attack from stance can allow the wielder to dodge an enemy attack and then quickly counter them, as the backstep possesses invulnerability frames that allow the wielder to avoid damage with the right timing. The strong attack is useful for going quickly on the offensive, and is particularly powerful when combined with a weapon buff to take advantage of the fast attacks.\nOnline gameplay.\nBoth of these attacks give the wielder the ability to perform fast spacing and positional attacks to counter another player's attacks. While neither attack has &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt;, they can be used to either dodge a single attack and get a counter-hit in, or to quickly close the distance and get several attacks in. The fast nature of these attacks also makes it difficult for an enemy player to predict which attack will be used."}

A weak attack will execute a thrust with strong forward momentum, while a strong attack will execute a delayed horizontal swing and launch a short-ranged wave of Magic damage. After an attack from stance, the weapon will be buffed with 80 Magic damage for 35 seconds.\nUsage.\nSingle Player.\nThis skill can be useful for initiating combat against a particularly powerful enemy, or against a group of enemies. On top of dealing strong damage with the first hit, the weapon will be buffed to deal increased damage for a period of time afterward, which allows the wielder to more quickly dispatch the foe(s) in question. Additionally, keep in mind that both the swing and the wave for the strong attack can deal damage, so hitting an enemy at close range can deal tremendous damage.\nOnline gameplay.\nBecause of how costly the skill is in terms of &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt;, judicious use is recommended, especially on characters with little investment in &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Attunement&lt;/a&gt;. One can attempt to catch a foe with the weak attack at the start of an engagement and then play aggressively for the duration of the buff, or use the strong attack as a roll-catch or wake-up attack. However, be aware that the &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;Hyper Armor&lt;/a&gt; begins only during the actual attacks, thus the wind-up can be easily interrupted due to poor timing. The FP cost and the buff will both occur at the beginning of the animation."}

Also, &lt;a href=\"Standard%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;in contrast&lt;/a&gt; to \"Dark Souls\", common equipment can be reinforced only up to +10, not +15.\nEffects.\nWeapons that upgrade with\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Titanite%20Shard%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Titanite Shards&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0improve damage characteristics by 10% per upgrade. Scaling values will increase gradually and, in some cases, move up a rank (i.e. going from A to S). This basic upgrading may be performed 9 times, before needing a &lt;a href=\"Titanite%20Slab%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Titanite Slab&lt;/a&gt;. Once this process is completed, your weapon will be twice as effective on top of any scaling bonuses it gained.\nRequirements.\nTo reinforce, the player needs an item that is able to be reinforced, the required\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Upgrade%20Materials%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Titanite&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and sufficient\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Souls%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Souls&lt;/a&gt;. For regular titanite weapons, one will need to use 6 Titanite Shards, 6 &lt;a href=\"Large%20Titanite%20Shard%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Large Titanite Shards&lt;/a&gt;, 6 &lt;a href=\"Titanite%20Chunk%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Titanite Chunks&lt;/a&gt;, and 1 &lt;a href=\"Titanite%20Slab%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Titanite Slab&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to ascend a weapon to +10.

However, a blacksmith can downgrade some ascended weapons back to standard (souls and materials previously expended are permanently lost).\nOverview.\nStandard upgrades improve the weapon's base damage as well as the &lt;a href=\"scaling\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt; it receives from &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;, unlike &lt;a href=\"Raw%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;Raw Upgrades&lt;/a&gt;. For Strength and Dexterity builds, standard upgrades are the best choice in the long run for this reason. Although the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;Crystal&lt;/a&gt; path technically creates weapons with greater damage output, crystal weapons cannot be repaired and are therefore only effective in the short term; normal weapons can be used indefinitely as long as they are repaired.\nAll &lt;a href=\"standard%20weapons\"&gt;standard weapons&lt;/a&gt; (minus certain categories that are never enchantable, such as &lt;a href=\"Bows\"&gt;Bows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crossbows\"&gt;Crossbows&lt;/a&gt;) may be &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Augmentation\"&gt;augmented&lt;/a&gt;."}

Gray hounds are tougher than their white counterparts, with the exception of a gray hound in the &lt;a href=\"Untended%20Graves\"&gt;Untended Graves&lt;/a&gt;, which actually has less health than the surrounding white hounds.\nIn a cave beneath the &lt;a href=\"Road%20of%20Sacrifices\"&gt;Road of Sacrifices&lt;/a&gt;, a duo of hounds can be found near some &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;miracle&lt;/a&gt;-related artifacts from &lt;a href=\"Carim\"&gt;Carim&lt;/a&gt;. One is a normal gray hound, and the other is a unique variant with a bloated, festering abdomen, and can vomit &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;. This unique variant also has a special pounce and grabbing attack (tap , / , rapidly to break free).\nLocations.\n&lt;a href=\"Cemetery%20of%20Ash\"&gt;Cemetery of Ash&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"High%20Wall%20of%20Lothric\"&gt;High Wall of Lothric&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Undead Settlement&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Road%20of%20Sacrifices\"&gt;Road of Sacrifices&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Cathedral of the Deep&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Untended%20Graves\"&gt;Untended Graves&lt;/a&gt;\nStrategy.\nAlthough they have low vitality, Starved Hounds are agile creatures that will often evade attacks and retaliate with a leaping bite. They are weak against &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; and will writhe around in agony if set alight, which offers an opportunity to attack them unmolested.\nThey are also notoriously frail, and if attacked with enough force, they will be sent flying back and knocked down. Depending on the situation, this can be either an advantage or a disadvantage, as they can be momentarily disabled and give the player a breathing room, or perhaps it may be more convenient to defeat them as quick as possible to prevent other enemies from gathering."}

While laying down a sustained barrage against an intelligent opponent who is not otherwise distracted can be a waste of &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Points\"&gt;FP&lt;/a&gt;, buffing up the catalyst right before an ambush can make the first strike all the more impactful, moreso if the target has not dutifully leveled up &lt;a href=\"Vigor%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Vigor&lt;/a&gt;.

You can also unlock the workshop by using the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Bastille%20Key\"&gt;Lost Bastille Key&lt;/a&gt;.\nMcDuff needs the &lt;a href=\"Dull%20Ember\"&gt;Dull Ember&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to begin customizing &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; along specific upgrade paths using stones which can make &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Weapons%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;unique weapons&lt;/a&gt;.

It is also possible to get this slab by killing him, but it can only be obtained from one of either method. \nLore.\nMcDuff is losing his mind, evident by the swinging of his hammer at nothing except open air, and murmurs about a soft, fading ember, revealed to be the Dull Ember when the player next visits his workshop with the item in their inventory.\nThis also may be a reference to lighting the torch in his room. By doing this he'll get up and move to his anvil, allowing access to the &lt;a href=\"Craftsman%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Craftsman's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; and a piece of &lt;a href=\"Twinkling%20Titanite%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Twinkling Titanite&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe fact that you acquire the Craftsman's Hammer from the chest he is sitting on could mean he is the legendary Blacksmith mentioned in the item's description. Because of this, he could have been locked away in the cell\u00a0when the Lost Bastille was originally created,\u00a0as humans feared powerful people.\nWhy McDuff is in The Lost Bastille is unclear; whether he is an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; inmate, in self-imposed exile or a remnant of the prison staff is unknown, though his situation resembles that of &lt;a href=\"Rickert%20of%20Vinheim\"&gt;Rickert of Vinheim&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

Inputting a strong attack while in this lunge animation will bring the sword up and around into a downward slam, inflicting 1.85 times the weapon's Attack Rating as damage and 2.1 times the weapon's base Poise damage to any enemies in front of the player, while flattening them.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Fume%20Ultra%20Greatsword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fume Ultra Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; version of the Stomp will use the weapon as a &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;, blocking any attacks from the front during the first part of the skill.\nUsage.\nSingle Player.\nThis skill fulfills the same role as the &lt;a href=\"Stomp%20%28upward%29\"&gt;upward Stomp&lt;/a&gt;, dealing tremendous damage in an area in front of the player while disabling the target(s). However, it is worthwhile to note that it is unique due to the weapons that this skill is present on: the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight%20Greatsword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Black Knight Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; already has an upward-launching power attack in its two-handed strong attack, while the Fume Ultra Greatsword grants the player block frames during the initial stomp.\nOnline.\nThis skill is best used to trade against other heavy weapons after baiting the other player into committing to an attack, as the crushing attack will pancake them, leaving them unable to act for a short period while giving the wielder a brief respite to use as they wish.\nWhen using this skill on the Fume Ultra Greatsword, care should be taken as to which types of attacks are traded against. Because the weapon acts as a shield during the first phase of the skill, it will greatly reduce the amount of damage the wielder takes. However, because of this same property of the skill, the wielder will take tremendous stamina damage for every attack blocked, as the sword lacks strong stability. This means that investment into &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt; should be prioritized, and that it is wiser to attempt to trade into attacks from smaller weapons. Should the player run out of stamina during the initial stomp due to blocking attacks, they will be unable to perform the second phase of the skill to punish the enemy for attacking."}

Inputting a strong attack while in this lunge animation will bring the sword to the wielder's back, then around in a powerful clockwise spin that knocks down all enemies that it hits. The spin will hit twice, first for 0.75 times the weapon's Attack Rating and 0.5 times the weapon's base Poise damage, and then second for 1.25 times the weapon's Attack Rating and 1.3 times the weapon's base Poise damage. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Executioner%27s%20Greatsword\"&gt;Executioner's Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; gains 70 Poise health at the start of the skill, while the ultra greatswords gain 100 Poise health.\nUsage.\nSingle Player.\nProvided that one has enough Poise, the spin attack can be useful for providing a sweeping horizontal attack that inflicts heavy damage to enemies in all directions. Be wary about using this to trade against too many foes though, as they can bring enough attacks to interrupt or even kill you before you pull off the spin.\nOnline.\nGenerally the Stomp should be used to trade against other ultra wielders after baiting them into committing into an attack. It distinguishes itself from other Stomp variations in that it can be used to catch players who spot the trade too late and attempt to get behind you to avoid getting hit. It should never be used by itself if the other player is free to act, as it simply invites them to dodge through the spin and then get off a free &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;.\nBecause it inflicts knockdown on any enemy it hits, it can also be somewhat useful when fighting near a ledge, as there is a chance that the attack can disposition them towards the cliff, possibly knocking them off for an instant kill."}

Inputting a strong attack while in this lunge animation will bring the sword into an upward arc that ends behind the player, inflicting 1.85 times the weapon's Attack Rating as damage and 2.1 times the weapon's base Poise damage to any enemies in front of the player, while knocking them skyward.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bastard%20Sword\"&gt;Bastard Sword&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sword\"&gt;Dark Sword&lt;/a&gt; variants of Stomp gain 70 Poise health, while the ultra greatswords gain 100 Poise health. As well, the Dark Sword's Stomp inflicts 1.8 times the weapon's Attack Rating as damage and 2.2 times its base Poise damage.\nUsage.\nSingle player.\nThe upward variation of Stomp is best used in situations where the player wants to inflict tremendous focused damage on a single target while also disabling them for more breathing space. It is best used against enemies that can be affected by the upward launch, as those enemies must spend additional time getting back up, allowing the player to reset an encounter at an advantage.\nOnline gameplay.\nAs with other variations of Stomp, it is best used when the wielder needs to trade against a weapon of equal or greater size and come out on top. It is most effective when the enemy player is locked in an attack animation and is committed to that attack, as the upward slash will deal tremendous damage and knock them into the air, giving the wielder additional time to turn the tables by recovering health with an &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt;, activate a buff, throw a &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Hunter%20Charm\"&gt;Lloyd's Talisman&lt;/a&gt; at them to keep them at low health once they recover, or simply back off to reset the encounter.\nBe wary about attempting to perform this skill if the enemy is free to act, as they can simply roll through the upward swing and punish you during recovery frames, particularly with a &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;."}

Due to this, buffing this weapon can further increase the power of the two-handed strong attack, as buffs apply to the &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;area of effect&lt;/a&gt; damage. This can present to opportunity for one-shot builds, though this boils down to a gimmick similar to &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20King%20Greataxe\"&gt;Dragon King Greataxe&lt;/a&gt;. "}

Because it is a &lt;a href=\"Boss%20Soul%20Items%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;soul-transposed weapon&lt;/a&gt;, it cannot take advantage of infusions and is thus a quality weapon that does not benefit from very high levels of &lt;a href=\"Dexterity%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dexterity&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, it also has trouble inflicting threatening amounts of damage, due to possessing only moderate scaling.\nIts &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; is a variant of the &lt;a href=\"Falchion%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Falchion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spin%20Slash%20%28Falchion%29\"&gt;Spin Slash&lt;/a&gt;, and is capable of knocking down foes should it connect."}

This makes Straid the only magic trainer that can teach the player all the kinds of magic that are found within the game.\nAlthough Straid is a wise and knowledgeable mage, he is an incredibly vain individual. He constantly looks down on the player for being \"weak\" and he speaks highly about his power and the \"magnificence\" of his spells. Straid always questions the player's intelligence (no matter how high is the Intelligence stat of the player) and he mocks them using his catchphrase \"feeble cursed one!\".\nLocation.\nStraid is found &lt;a href=\"petrified\"&gt;petrified&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Straid%27s%20Cell\"&gt;his cell&lt;/a&gt; in front of a &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Bastille\"&gt;The Lost Bastille&lt;/a&gt;, across the bridge from the &lt;a href=\"Sinners%27%20Rise\"&gt;Sinners' Rise&lt;/a&gt;, and must be cured of his petrification before the player can talk to him or access his bonfire, using a &lt;a href=\"Fragrant%20Branch%20of%20Yore\"&gt;Fragrant Branch of Yore&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nStraid was invited to &lt;a href=\"Olaphis\"&gt;Olaphis&lt;/a&gt; for his wisdom. A well-versed sorcerer, Straid became an expert in the various fields of magic. He is known as the creator of powerful spells, such as &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Soul%20Arrow\"&gt;Homing Soul Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Bolt\"&gt;Soul Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Swathe\"&gt;Flame Swathe&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lingering%20Flame\"&gt;Lingering Flame&lt;/a&gt;. He was also responsible for the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Resistance\"&gt;Ring of Resistance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dispelling%20Ring\"&gt;Dispelling Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough Straid was known in Olaphis for his vast knowledge, he was also feared for it. He was lured into a dreadful trap, which likely resulted in his petrification. Since Straid never accepted an apprentice, a great part of his extensive knowledge was lost and wasn't recovered until he was unpetrified by the &lt;a href=\"Bearer%20of%20the%20Curse\"&gt;Bearer of the Curse&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen cured, Straid reacts remarkably calmly for someone who has been petrified for countless years. He claims that even Olaphis was not the first to stand where Drangleic does now, and that the curse was as much a problem back then as it is now.\nBoss Souls Trades.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

It can only be fought by players upon returning to the asylum, after they leave the facility for the first time.\nLocation.\nThe Stray Demon is found in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Undead%20Asylum\"&gt;Northern Undead Asylum&lt;/a&gt;. When first exiting the prison cell at the beginning of the game, the Stray Demon can be seen wandering around its boss arena through the bars to the right. However, it is impossible to reach at this point in the game since players need to return to the asylum after leaving for the first time. Upon returning, the Stray Demon can be fought by falling through the floor in the middle of the main hall, where players originally fought the &lt;a href=\"Asylum%20Demon\"&gt;Asylum Demon&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe Stray Demon wields an unidentified catalyst, a casting tool used to channel &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;. The weapon is possibly a &lt;a href=\"Demon%27s%20Catalyst\"&gt;Demon's Catalyst&lt;/a&gt;. The demon itself is similar in appearance to the Asylum Demon and the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Firesage\"&gt;Demon Firesage&lt;/a&gt;. It has an almost draconic appearance, with green scales all over its body and a pair of stubby wings on its back. It sports a tail and horn-like growths portrude from its legs and arms. Dark red eyes are accompanied by a set of large teeth that are revealed by the demon's permanently exposed gums.\nLore.\nThe Stray Demon is a greater &lt;a href=\"Demon%20%28lore%29\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; spawned from the &lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, the entity that appeared following the attempt of the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Witch of Izalith&lt;/a&gt; to make a power similar to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; using her &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Soul\"&gt;Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt;. The attempt was successful and she create the &lt;a href=\"Flame%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Flame of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; but Izalith and her powerful soul became a seedbed for a new lifeform: the mother and source of all demons. After its birth, the Stray Demon managed to survive the war that the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Knight\"&gt;Silver Knight&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; waged against its kind and at some point it was able to escape from the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Izalith\"&gt;Lost Izalith&lt;/a&gt;. The demon wandered &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt; until it came to reside in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Undead%20Asylum\"&gt;Northern Undead Asylum&lt;/a&gt;, the prison designed to keep &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; locked away from the rest of the world until the end of time, and that became its domain.\nStrategy.\nThe player will first fall through the floor, lose some health from the landing, and end up across the room in front of the Stray Demon. Casting &lt;a href=\"Fall%20Control\"&gt;Fall Control&lt;/a&gt; before the fight will negate the damage players suffer from falling into the Stray Demon's pit. There is no place to use the &lt;a href=\"White%20Sign%20Soapstone\"&gt;White Sign Soapstone&lt;/a&gt; in this area so it is not possible to summon others for this fight. The major difference from the Asylum Demon is that the Stray Demon wields a catalyst-type weapon that is capable of creating large Magic explosions in front of it, inflicting serious damage in a wide area.\nThe Stray Demon possesses two magic area-of-effect attacks, so learning the telegraphs for them is very important. When it prepares to wave its weapon horizontally, from left to right (player's right to left), it will create a large frontal magic explosion that can be very difficult to roll through. Its other area-of-effect attack is telegraphed by pointing its catalyst downward and planting it into the ground, which creates the self-centered explosion that can reach in an area behind it. The &lt;a href=\"Crest%20Shield\"&gt;Crest Shield&lt;/a&gt;, dropped by &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20of%20Astora\"&gt;Oscar of Astora&lt;/a&gt;, is highly useful in mitigating the magic damage.\nIdeally, much of the fight should be spent attacking the demon from behind, as this leaves it unable to hit the player with its weapon swings. However, caution should be exercised as its downward-stabbing magical explosion can still hit players standing next to its tail. Players can avoid this by retreating a few meters behind it when they see it lift the catalyst up in preparation. In between his explosion attacks, players should pelt his backside with their attack of choice. The Stray Demon will occasionally jump into the air and perform a rear-drop to reorient itself to face the player. When this occurs, this can be avoided by walking about two meters away. Using a shield will deal heavy stamina damage. Sticking to his right may damage and knockdown the player due to the weapon facing in that direction.\nThe Stray Demon is susceptible to &lt;a href=\"Negative%20Status%20Effects%23Bleed\"&gt;bleed&lt;/a&gt; damage and although it can be inflicted with both &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Toxic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;, it is immune to the damage of poison, though toxic will very slowly inflict damage. Like other demons, it also takes bonus damage from &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight\"&gt;Black Knight&lt;/a&gt; weaponry. It is also not as susceptible to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Firebomb\"&gt;Black Firebomb&lt;/a&gt;s as the Asylum Demon.\nBoss\u00a0information.\nAttacks.\nDouble Hammer Swing.\nTwo horizontal swings of the Demon's hammer. Similar to the Asylum Demon's attack. Can be blocked, but heavy stamina drain occurs. Can also be rolled under, allowing the player to attack the Demon.\nPower Smash.\nAn overhead hammer smash with exceptionally long reach. Can be avoided by dodging to the left or right.\nDouble Power Smash.\nCan only be used after the first Power Smash. The Stray Demon raises its hammer, then smashes it down again. Can be dodged by rolling to the left or right.\nButt Slam.\nThe Stray Demon flies up, pauses momentarily to rotate itself to face the player, then falls to the ground. Can be avoided by retreating away.\nFlame Explosion.\nThe Stray Demon brings the hammer to its left (player's right), then waves it horizontally, causing a massive explosion in front of it. Unlike the Hammer Drive attack, it doesn't have any backwards hitbox and can be dodged by getting behind, or even under, the demon. Despite the attacks name, it deals purely &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Damage%20Type%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; damage.\nHammer \u00a0Explosion.\nThe Stray Demon grips the hammer in both hands, pointing downward, and drives it into the ground in front of it. Similar to the Asylum Demon's attack, however, once the hammer hits the ground, a massive explosion occurs at the point of impact, which can deal damage in an area behind it."}

It can spew a &lt;a href=\"Boulder%20Heave\"&gt;barrage of rocks&lt;/a&gt; at the player from a distance, or it can grab them and throw them off the bridge, which results in an instant death.\nThe barrage of rocks have extreme knockback, so it is advised to run behind the demon when it starts using this attack. Its grab is extremely fast, which makes it very difficult to evade, and is usually performed immediately after a previous attack, often when the player is trying to score a hit of their own. It is then advised to always try to attack it from behind. Care must also be taken in this situation, though, as the demon will start performing backward spinning sweeps with its great hammer or wail its tail in order to deal with enemies on the rear.\nIf the player remains too close to the demon for too long, it may occasionally stop for a moment, then leap into the air, letting itself smash onto the ground for an &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;area-of-effect&lt;/a&gt; attack. The area covered by this attack is not too big, however, and the demon will take a couple of seconds to recover, giving the player ample time to score a few hits.\nInflicting enough damage to its legs will cause them to shatter, leaving the demon almost unable to move. Players should not get overconfident, though, as the monster will still be dangerous. It may perform numerous horizontal swings with its great hammer in quick succession, or perform a powerful smash on the ground with it. However, the player may be able to deal enough damage fast enough while in this state, which will stagger the creature and leave it open for a &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;critical attack&lt;/a&gt;, which will most likely end the battle."}

They appear to be &lt;a href=\"hollow\"&gt;hollow&lt;/a&gt;ed and are also missing several parts of their black-colored skin, revealing their flesh. They also have red eyes.\nLocation.\nStray Hounds are commonly found throughout &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Bastille\"&gt;The Lost Bastille&lt;/a&gt;. Three are found in the room next to the first &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;, along with a &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Swordsman\"&gt;Royal Swordsman&lt;/a&gt;. Two are encountered on the bridge leading to &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Bastille%23Bonfires\"&gt;McDuff's Workshop&lt;/a&gt;.

They only have a few attacks, but each of them deals a considerable amount of damage. Simply strafing to the side can avoid the lunge bites that these hounds execute. Using powerful &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;area-of-effect&lt;/a&gt; attacks can also deal with them quickly, as they don't boast a considerable amount of health."}

Major softcaps are 27 when two-handing, and 40 overall. Some weapons like Great Club and Murakumo would benefit from having 28 strength instead of 27 since that is their one handed requirement. \nYour Strength level is given a 1.5x multiplier when two-handing your right hand weapon for the purposes of weapon scaling and requirements. Anything higher than 27 is usually unnecessary outside of reaching the requirement to one hand your weapon. This is because at 27 strength, two handing will reach the optimal scaling soft cap of 40 (27 * 1.5 = 40.5, rounded down to 40). This is why 40/40 quality builds are generally not attainable or advisable in the first NG cycle, as the 13 points invested into strength is wasteful when you can just two hand.\nWeapon Scaling.\nThe following are &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; that scale with strength, and their level of scaling, when not upgraded. Weapon scaling may change when upgraded. Diminishing returns for Strength scaling begin at 40 effective Strength. "}

Raising one's Strength value primarily increases the player's Strength Attack Bonus, the value of which is multiplied by a hidden modifier of a weapon when attacking. Raising Strength also boosts the player's HP and Physical Defense stats slightly.\nFor the few weapons that do scale, the softcaps for strength are 20/40/50 for an increase to physical attack, however very few weapons have meaningful scaling and it is not worth it to reach physical damage scaling caps for a majority of weapons. \nTwo-handing.\nTwo-handing something doubles your Strength only for the purposes of weapon requirements. The scaling of the weapon will not change, only the motion value (small additional damage modifier) of the attacks themselves. An example of this is if a weapon required 17 strength but the player only had 8, the user could two-hand it and still wield the weapon. (17\u00f72 = 8.5 rounded down is 8) This is a way to use a weapon with a strength requirement that might be too high to meet fully. "}

However, if a single attack does not kill them while they are in this state, they will get back up and resume the fight, though they can still be killed before their recovery animation completes.\nDuring its &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; attack, it is advised to hug their chest or their sides. The attack is telegraphed and is rather easy to avoid as it affects a limited area and does not track the target, giving the player time to heal or attack without retaliation.\nThe first beast will suddenly appear behind the player when they start crossing the bridge and will vanish if they retreat under the arch; however, it will not regain any health and it is possible to kill it from a distance with ranged weapons. It is possible that the beast on the bridge, if not slain, will fall down to the swamp area below and attack the player when they go through it.\nThe two in the &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley%23Bonfires\"&gt;Water Reserve&lt;/a&gt; should be lured away from each other, as fighting both at once is very risky. It is advisable to try and lure the one in the far right corner first as luring the one to the left may cause both to attack. As an invader, the player could try to lure unsuspecting hosts to this area in hopes they get attacked by them.\nSulyvahn's Beasts are highly susceptible to &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt;, and as such, using a &lt;a href=\"Carthus%20Rouge\"&gt;Carthus Rouge&lt;/a&gt; and/or weapons such as the &lt;a href=\"Uchigatana%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Uchigatana&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Carthus%20Curved%20Sword\"&gt;Carthus Curved Sword&lt;/a&gt; are recommended.\nIf one has the &lt;a href=\"Slumbering%20Dragoncrest%20Ring\"&gt;Slumbering Dragoncrest Ring&lt;/a&gt; and/or the &lt;a href=\"Spook\"&gt;Spook&lt;/a&gt; spell, plus the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Body\"&gt;Hidden Body&lt;/a&gt; sorcery, the two Sulyvahn's Beasts in the Water Reserve can be dealt with by using the &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Spores\"&gt;Poison Spores&lt;/a&gt; skill from the &lt;a href=\"Storyteller%27s%20Staff\"&gt;Storyteller's Staff&lt;/a&gt; from an applicable distance to slowly whittle their health down, one by one. Simply approach one while under the effects of Hidden Body and the ring/the Spook spell, and use the skill, then back away to the far wall before the spell(s) wear off."}

This means that the sword will outdamage other straight swords with a dedicated quality build.\nHowever, the weapon falters if the player has low strength and dexterity. It also synergizes poorly with infusions, as the weapon's physical scaling is drastically reduced while its elemental scaling is similar to the average straight sword, and its base damage remains low.\nConsumable weapon buffs such as &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Pine%20Resin%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Gold Pine Resin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rotten%20Pine%20Resin%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Rotten Pine Resin&lt;/a&gt; make excellent complements for this weapon.

Beyond this, however, it provides very respectable physical and elemental defenses, and moderate resistance to status effect buildup, particularly against &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt;.\nIts greatest weakness, however, is that it has very poor &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;, comparable to that found on light cloth sets.

However, when used to cast Dark Miracles, it gains the ability to utilize its full &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Buff\"&gt;Spell Buff&lt;/a&gt; rating by incorporating &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; into its attack power, as well as gaining an additional power boost by casting a spell that is classified as Dark, increasing in strength by between 40% and 64%, depending on the specific spell. This means that even if the caster has not made any investments into Intelligence, the Sunless Talisman can be extremely potent for casting spells such as &lt;a href=\"Dorhys%27%20Gnawing\"&gt;Dorhys' Gnawing&lt;/a&gt;. However, in order to unlock its maximum potential, it is ideal to level both Faith and Intelligence equally.\nIt is also worthwhile to note that unlike most talismans, its scaling gives it casting power comparable to its &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Chimes%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;chime&lt;/a&gt; counterpart, &lt;a href=\"Caitha%27s%20Chime%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Caitha's Chime&lt;/a&gt;. However, as it also possesses &lt;a href=\"Unfaltering%20Prayer\"&gt;Unfaltering Prayer&lt;/a&gt;, giving it &lt;a href=\"Hyper%20Armor\"&gt;poise-casting&lt;/a&gt;, this makes the Sunless Talisman a superior combat tool as it only deals slightly less damage than Caitha's Chime with offensive Dark Miracles.\nUpgrades.\nReinforced with &lt;a href=\"Twinkling%20Titanite%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Twinkling Titanite&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

As they are all hollow &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Appease\"&gt;Soul Appease&lt;/a&gt; can be used to make this significantly easier with at least 19 Faith. &lt;a href=\"Item%20Discovery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Item Discovery&lt;/a&gt; raising equipment is recommended. \nFor the original version if you choose to farm Falconers it may be best to do so immediately after starting NG+ and then choosing not to light any bonfires while using either &lt;a href=\"Homeward%20Bone%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Homeward Bones&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Aged%20Feather\"&gt;Aged Feather&lt;/a&gt; to respawn as close as possibe to them (at the small temple at the start). Do note that if you do this you will have to have restocked on items and prepared your items and spells (and preferably also have joined the &lt;a href=\"Company%20of%20Champions\"&gt;Company of Champions&lt;/a&gt;) since doing this afterwards can be either impossible without using a bonfire or just annoying.

Like other plate metal sets it is quite weak to &lt;a href=\"Strike%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Strike&lt;/a&gt; damage, though it resists &lt;a href=\"Slash%20%28damage%20type%29\"&gt;Slash&lt;/a&gt; damage quite well. Its elemental defenses can be found wanting, having mediocre absorption values at best and severe weaknesses to &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt;.

Its powerful scaling in Dark and respectable scaling in Magic makes it a very powerful staff for casting both &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;sorceries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hexes\"&gt;hexes&lt;/a&gt;, allowing players to bring a withering barrage of spell damage upon their enemies.\nHowever, it also has a fairly unimpressive &lt;a href=\"Casting%20Speed\"&gt;Casting Speed&lt;/a&gt;, and its base Magic attack does not improve greatly with upgrades, being outclassed by most sorcery-dedicated staves like the &lt;a href=\"Lizard%20Staff\"&gt;Lizard Staff&lt;/a&gt;. As well, it requires the use of &lt;a href=\"Twinkling%20Titanite%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Twinkling Titanite&lt;/a&gt; in order to upgrade, meaning that it will be hard to take full advantage of it in the early game.

He serves as a sort of tutorial for one-on-one fights in the game.\nHis decayed aspect and almost complete lack of garments may fool the player into thinking it would be an easy fight, but his resilience to damage at the point in the game when he can be first encountered and his superior combat techniques will prove him to be a worthy adversary.\nHe uses the &lt;a href=\"Uchigatana%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Uchigatana&lt;/a&gt;'s two-handed moveset and will often keep changing stances to prepare to use its &lt;a href=\"Hold\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful lunging slash. If attacked while in this stance, he will perform this weapon's secondary skill, a &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parry and riposte&lt;/a&gt; counterattack.\nOnce defeated, he can be summoned to aid in the following boss fights:\nLocations.\n&lt;a href=\"Cemetery%20of%20Ash\"&gt;Cemetery of Ash&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"High%20Wall%20of%20Lothric\"&gt;High Wall of Lothric&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Untended%20Graves\"&gt;Untended Graves&lt;/a&gt;\nStrategy.\nThe Sword Master can be an unexpected powerful adversary the first time he is encountered. He has a long aggro range and will start approaching the player from a big distance, albeit slowly. His attacks are usually limited to no more than two or three slashes while holding his &lt;a href=\"Uchigatana%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;katana&lt;/a&gt; with both hands. However, he will be frequently changing his stance, preparing to unleash his weapon's &lt;a href=\"Hold\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; by holding it at waist level in a sheathed-like manner. Refrain from attacking him at this moment or he will &lt;a href=\"Parry%20and%20Riposte%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt; and follow with a &lt;a href=\"Critical%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;riposte&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe has no resistances to any type of attack, so using elemental infusions or buffs will be helpful against him. He also has very little &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;poise&lt;/a&gt;, so it's possible to stagger him with just a few of well-connected hits. His attacks are quite predictable too, which makes him very susceptible of being parried. It is not recommended to fight him very early in the game, though, as he will take minimal damage while being able to deal high amounts in return.\nThe battle initially takes place near a cliff, so it is possible to lure him into falling with enough practice. In addition, he cannot enter &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt;, so the player may also opt to lure him to the entrance and attack him from inside, preferably with a ranged weapon, though a long enough melee weapon, such as a spear or halberd, will also suffice."}

Instead, it may be easier to either focus on one of the weapons as the main weapon, with perhaps a shield from &lt;a href=\"Maughlin%20the%20Armorer\"&gt;Maughlin the Armorer&lt;/a&gt; in the other hand, or to get a second &lt;a href=\"Shortsword%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Shortsword&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20of%20Fallen%20Giants\"&gt;Forest of Fallen Giants&lt;/a&gt; as that only requires the 2 extra points in Strength to begin Power Stancing. \nThe initial armor set, the &lt;a href=\"Wanderer%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Wanderer Set&lt;/a&gt;, has overall decent defences and is quite light but has no poise, making it nearly useless if trying to directly exchange blows. \nAt 8 i-frames it has a decent starting roll, but due to having the lowest starting HP (only about 740 hp, with only the &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deprived%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Deprived&lt;/a&gt; having similarly low hp at about 770 each while the other classes range from 830 hp to 960 hp) because of its low &lt;a href=\"Vigor\"&gt;Vigor&lt;/a&gt;, getting that stat and then &lt;a href=\"Adaptability\"&gt;Adaptability&lt;/a&gt; up a bit will be good for actually surviving the hits that land.

As well, like a spear, it is capable of performing thrusting attacks from behind a raised &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;, granting defensive utility. This makes the weapon very versatile as the wielder can utilize quick thrusting attacks as well as wide sweeping attacks on the same weapon, granting wide area coverage and ranged spacing attacks.\nHowever, this comes at the cost of a comparatively high Dexterity wielding requirement, as well as a somewhat low base damage when compared to other halberds that also deal purely physical damage. Both of these factors mean that the weapon is most ideal un-&lt;a href=\"Infusion\"&gt;infused&lt;/a&gt;, and that the weapon is best utilized by leveling Dexterity in order to take advantage of its high &lt;a href=\"Parameter%20Bonus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;scaling&lt;/a&gt; in that stat.\nMoveset.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

As of &lt;a href=\"patch%201.05\"&gt;patch 1.05&lt;/a&gt;, if the player kills all of the Mimics in the game, the Symbol of Avarice will be a guaranteed drop from the last one killed. The Mimic in &lt;a href=\"Oolacile%20Township\"&gt;Oolacile Township&lt;/a&gt; is not included in this, as it is not part of the base game.\nCharacteristics.\nThe Symbol of Avarice is a head piece that possesses high &lt;a href=\"physical%20defense\"&gt;physical defense&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poise%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Poise&lt;/a&gt;, but low &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Defense\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Defense\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; resistance; in addition, it cannot be upgraded and drains &lt;a href=\"HP\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; at the rate of 5 per second while being worn.

While worn, the player will absorb 50% more &lt;a href=\"Souls%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; when defeating enemies, including &lt;a href=\"Boss%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt;, and their &lt;a href=\"Item%20Discovery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Item Discovery&lt;/a&gt; will be increased by 100 points. However, the headgear will also drain 10 &lt;a href=\"HP%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; per second while worn.\nAt a &lt;a href=\"weight\"&gt;weight&lt;/a&gt; of 11 units, the Symbol of Avarice is the third heaviest headpiece available, behind &lt;a href=\"Havel%27s%20Helm%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Havel's Helm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Smough%27s%20Helm%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Smough's Helm&lt;/a&gt; at 11.2 and 12.2 units, respectively.\nHow to obtain.\nThe Symbol of Avarice is a potential drop from all &lt;a href=\"Mimic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Mimics&lt;/a&gt; encountered throughout the course of the game. It may even be obtained from the very first Mimic in the &lt;a href=\"High%20Wall%20of%20Lothric\"&gt;High Wall of Lothric&lt;/a&gt;. All Mimics have guaranteed drops, but they may also yield a Symbol of Avarice along with these.\nSince Mimics are non-respawning enemies, each encounter with one is very valuable if one is looking to obtain a Symbol of Avarice. The player must first make sure their &lt;a href=\"Item%20Discovery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Item Discovery&lt;/a&gt; attribute is as high as possible. Crushing a &lt;a href=\"Rusted%20Coin%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Rusted Coin&lt;/a&gt;, or even a &lt;a href=\"Rusted%20Gold%20Coin\"&gt;Rusted Gold Coin&lt;/a&gt;, before engaging a Mimic is recommended, as well as equipping the &lt;a href=\"Covetous%20Gold%20Serpent%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Covetous Gold Serpent Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike in previous installments, Mimics can be disabled momentarily by throwing an &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Hunter%20Charm\"&gt;Undead Hunter Charm&lt;/a&gt; at them. Each time a Mimic is disabled, it will have a chance to spawn a Symbol of Avarice; the Mimic will drop to the ground and be safe to loot for a short period of time. The first time this is done to a mimic, it will drop its guaranteed drop, although they may drop a Symbol of Avarice at the same time, as well.\nIf the Mimic did not drop the headgear, it can be attacked in its staggered state and it will return to its 'trap' form without retaliating. The player can then throw another charm at it, giving it another chance to spawn a Symbol of Avarice. The process can be repeated as long as the player has charms left, or until the Mimic dies."}

It is located in the upper section of the Burg. Later, however, additional weaker Taurus Demons can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Ruins\"&gt;Demon Ruins&lt;/a&gt; as regular . A group of seven Taurus Demons notably inhabits the latter area.\nDescription.\nTaurus Demons wield &lt;a href=\"Demon%27s%20Greataxe\"&gt;Demon's Greataxe&lt;/a&gt;s, weapons carved from the bones of fellow &lt;a href=\"Demon%20%28lore%29\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;. They are large, minotaur-like monsters covered in brown fur. Alongside their yellow eyes, large horns protrude out of their skeletal heads and a tail hangs between their legs.\nLore.\nThe Taurus Demons are lesser &lt;a href=\"Demon%20%28lore%29\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; spawned from the &lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, the entity that appeared following the attempt of the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Witch of Izalith&lt;/a&gt; to make a power similar to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; using her &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Soul\"&gt;Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt;. The attempt was successful and she create the &lt;a href=\"Flame%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Flame of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; but Izalith and her powerful soul became a seedbed for a new lifeform: the mother and source of all demons. After their birth, many Taurus Demons managed to survive the war that the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Knight\"&gt;Silver Knight&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; waged against their kind and at some point one of them was able to escape from the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Izalith\"&gt;Lost Izalith&lt;/a&gt;, bringing its &lt;a href=\"Demon%27s%20Greataxe\"&gt;Demon's Greataxe&lt;/a&gt;, made with the bones of fellow demons, with it. This demon managed to reach the upper section of the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Burg\"&gt;Undead Burg&lt;/a&gt;, a fortified town created for &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; that fell into ruin and made the area into its domain. Many other Taurus Demons continued to inhabit their &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Ruins\"&gt;ancient home&lt;/a&gt; even if reduced to ruins.\nStrategy.\nUndead Burg.\nA quick method to defeating the boss version of this creature is to climb the tower's ladder next to the entrance and perform a &lt;a href=\"Plunging%20Attack%23Dark%20Souls\"&gt;plunging attack&lt;/a&gt; from above. The player should eliminate the two &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Soldier\"&gt;Undead Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s guarding the tower before triggering the boss or they will get in the way. Caution is advised as the Taurus Demon can hurt the player while they are climbing if they are too slow. It can also jump up to the tower if the player stays up there for too long. This can be used to the player's advantage though, as it gives the player time to climb back down the ladder. Once the Taurus Demon climbs back down, a quick climb to the top and a few firebombs quickly dispatches the boss. While running back, the player can safely attack its legs to do additional damage. The player can also use &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Pine%20Resin\"&gt;Gold Pine Resin&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with this strategy to increase damage.\nIf the player decides to take this boss head on, the player can avoid all of its attacks by running between the demon's legs. It is also worth noting that the demon can accidentally fall off the side of the arena. This is more likely to happen when it is on the tower roof and when it performs a Jumping Pound.\nDemon Ruins.\nThe respawning and non-respawning enemies in the Demon Ruins are notable for their extreme aggro range. Care must be taken to avoid fighting several simultaneously, especially in the area surrounding the &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Flame%20Ember\"&gt;Chaos Flame Ember&lt;/a&gt;. With careful positioning, the respawning demon before the Firesage Demon can be dispatched with &lt;a href=\"Plunging%20Attack%23Dark%20Souls\"&gt;plunging attacks&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoss information.\nAttacks.\nGiant Swing.\nAt the start of this attack the Demon will draw back its weapon briefly, before initiating a huge swing across a horizontal arc in front of it. This attack does not have very much range, so it can easily be evaded by backstepping once you see it draw its weapon back. Alternatively, you can roll towards the Demon and go under the attack, which will allow you to get some quick hits in.\nJumping Pound.\nIf there's too much distance between you and the Taurus Demon, it will use the Jumping Pound to close in rapidly. The demon will crouch down, and then it will jump towards you and deliver a long range vertical attack. As soon as you see the demon crouch, either run towards it and roll past the attack, or continue moving backwards to get out of range.\nQuick Ground Stab.\nAnother attack that the Demon will only use when you're close. Because it is one of the quickest attacks, it's the primary one you need to be wary of. The start of the attack is quite similar to the Standing Pound, but the follow up is much quicker. You can still move around to the back of the Demon during the start of the attack, but be ready to roll to the side in case you do not get around in time.\nStanding Pound.\nThis close range version of the Pound is only used if you're very close to the Demon, and is also much easier to avoid. Wait until you see the Demon raise its hammer into the air slowly, and as it commences the attack. walk around to its back. From this position you will be safe to attack before it recovers.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls \u2014 Taurus Demon by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_YZMB64TK0&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

Like &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Gem\"&gt;humanities&lt;/a&gt;, the dregs that form the Deep are also able to condense and take the more solid form of &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Gem\"&gt;dark purple crystal&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLike the Abyss, the Deep is also capable of generating life but it is abominable, dirty and violent, these life forms naturally take on the appearance of small insects that have jaws lined with fangs to tear open the skin and burrow into the flesh in the blink of an eye, very different from the natural &lt;a href=\"Humanity%20Phantom\"&gt;Humanity Phantom&lt;/a&gt;s. Furthermore, the large masses of human dregs that accumulate in the Deep can possess human bodies, leading to the birth of the &lt;a href=\"Murkman\"&gt;Murkmen&lt;/a&gt;, beings that emerge from the depths and despite their damp and rotten form are capable of employing dark weapons and sorcery. The Deep also led to a degenerate evolution of the ancient humans who inhabited the &lt;a href=\"The%20Ringed%20City%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Ringed City&lt;/a&gt;, transforming them into humanoid &lt;a href=\"White-faced%20Locust\"&gt;white locusts&lt;/a&gt; that feed on humans.\nLore.\nThe part of this article about the events of lore is inaccurate, missing sources and requires expansions and additions to be considered useful \nWORK IN PROGRESS\nIt first manifested inside the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Cathedral of the Deep&lt;/a&gt; with the cleric &lt;a href=\"Aldrich\"&gt;Aldrich&lt;/a&gt;, who experienced visions of the Deep Sea. This led him to discover another nature of the Dark, wherein the dregs of it will sink to the lowest depth possible, and form the new nature that would bind and form the world..\nAfter his departure from his home &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll&lt;/a&gt;, the young &lt;a href=\"Aldrich%2C%20Devourer%20of%20Gods\"&gt;Aldrich&lt;/a&gt; was sent to a great cathedral of the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20White\"&gt;Way of White&lt;/a&gt; near the Undead &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Settlement&lt;/a&gt;, a known and peaceful religious center, overseen by three archdeacons: &lt;a href=\"Deacons%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Royce&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"McDonnell%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;McDonnell&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Archdeacon%20Klimt\"&gt;Klimt&lt;/a&gt;). His corruption though led to him consuming human flesh, reveling in the screams of those he would consume. Many of the deacons encouraged this behaviour, as his followers began to supply him with sacrifices, and even began to gather children to feed to him. Through cannibalism, Aldrich gathered more and more strength and power, turning him into a suitable sacrifice for the Linking of the Fire, and to be made a Lord of Cinder: because of this, he was declared a saint, and began to revel in vice. \n&lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Cathedral of the Deep&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe cathedral hosts a very particular place, the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Cleansing Chapel&lt;/a&gt;: facing the path leading to the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Undead Settlement&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Road%20of%20Sacrifices%23Bonfires\"&gt;Crucifixion Woods&lt;/a&gt;, it was meant to welcome and administrate a ritual of cleansing, purification and &lt;a href=\"Notched%20Whip%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;flogging&lt;/a&gt;. The ritual was meant to purify the worshippers of the Fire from the cursed darkness within them, with impurities in the blood shed with whips dropped into puddles that were later wiped away, released into the lake by the chapel. In time, the constant droppings polluted the lake, the dregs falling far into its depths and left there to pile up, unmoved by any flow and far from the eye: the stagnation led those dregs rotting deep underwater and eventually corrupting the lake itself, becoming the flourishing bosom of parasites, nasty insects and far more terrifying lurking creatures. If there is a physical place to be identified as \"the Deep\", this is it: a small lake, polluted by an ages lasting flow of dregs and human impurities that have darkened its very core and turned it into a rotting pond, a stagnating Abyss. \nThe once peaceful Cathedral of the Deep became the home to things most foul, and as of such, the deacons were required to protect themselves from it. Some of those who slipped into the Deep began to wallow in this filth, while others were steadfast and resisted the maddening corruption to some meaningful degree, though they still began to actively practice dark arts.\n&lt;a href=\"Aldrich%2C%20Devourer%20of%20Gods\"&gt;Aldrich, Saint of the Deep&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Aldrich noticed it and understood what was truly happening before their own eyes, he foresaw what this could have led to: an Age of Dark, but different from the old legends'. It would have been an era of corrupted, twisted Darkness, generated by the stagnation that had led to the formation of the Deep and that was slowly engulfing the cathedral itself: the world would have been flooded by an abyssal dark, similar to a deep sea's. He started to reveal this pre-visions of his with few and managed to convert two of the three Archdeacons of the Cathedral, being Royce and McDonnel. Eventually, he consumed so many men and children that the dregs of the Dark built up within him, before it collapsed onto itself, transforming Aldrich into a mass of dregs and his own rotting remains. Despite this sorrowful state, he remained sentient and sane, further proving his sainthood. Sheltered by the clergy, he became massive, sustained by flesh and filled with endless bones.\nHis power made him a candidate to link the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, however he was worthy only for the power of the Deep within him, and was linked against his will. His body was taken away from the burning &lt;a href=\"Kiln%20of%20the%20First%20Flame\"&gt;Kiln&lt;/a&gt; and closed safely into his coffin, to serve the Linking ritual again when the time would have come for his awakening. Meanwhile, the &lt;a href=\"Devout%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Church of the Deep&lt;/a&gt; would start spreading its faith among the Way of White's ranks and more and more clerics and members joined, as the Depths' corruption was spreading more into the cathedral and many horrors started to lurk within its halls. Meanwhile, in &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll&lt;/a&gt;, Sulhyvahn would consolidate his power as the new &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Sulyvahn\"&gt;Pontiff&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20White\"&gt;Way of White&lt;/a&gt;, closing an eye on Royce and McDonnel's practices as long as they didn't go against his rule and doing.\nAfter Aldrich revived and learnt of the world's state, he foresaw the inevitable age of the deep sea coming closer and that the time had come, and neglected his throne. His visions showed him the last of the old royalty of &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;, and resolved with courage in his heart to devour all of the Old Gods himself. Leaving Royce and the main clergy to keep watch over the Cathedral, and their saint's coffin, he marched with McDonnel and his clerics against Irithyll, defying the orders of &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Sulyvahn\"&gt;Sulhyvahn&lt;/a&gt; himself and taking over the city, slaughtering the &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Knight%20Set\"&gt;Pontiff's Knights&lt;/a&gt; and forcing the Pontiff to allow Aldrich the access to the &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Old Cathedral of Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Dark Sun Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt; was kept. Aldrich devoured Gwyndolin in its constant hunger for more power to stand as the new Lord of the approaching new era of the Deep Sea.\nAge of Deep Sea.\nThe is a condition that the world would assume once the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; has gone out. In fact, if naturally the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Age of Fire&lt;/a&gt; should have been followed by an &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Dark\"&gt;Age of Dark&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Soul\"&gt;Dark Soul&lt;/a&gt; has been corrupted and stagnated by the unnatural prolongation of the life of the Flame through the repeated acts of linking it. As a result the Dark Soul itself has remained trapped and castrated within human bodies due to the &lt;a href=\"Darksign\"&gt;Darksign&lt;/a&gt; for millennia, leading it to decay into &lt;a href=\"Human%20Dregs\"&gt;dregs&lt;/a&gt; or worse to explode in the form of &lt;a href=\"Pus%20of%20Man\"&gt;ferocious pus&lt;/a&gt;, becoming something beyond the natural darkness.\nIn this situation the human dregs that sink to the lowest possible depths will become the basis of everything and, as envisioned by Aldrich, a \"deep sea\" would engulf the world in rotten, putrid darkness. These dark soul dregs, having stewed for ages in the depths would also possess what remains of humans, envoloping them in the dark dampness of the Deep. Consequently, in the midst of a world covered in stagnant slime, the condition of the human race would become that of &lt;a href=\"Murkman\"&gt;murky humanoid beings&lt;/a&gt; possessed by stewed or out-of-control dark souls even if capable of using the power of the Deep to cast dark sorceries and instill their weapons. In addition, the Depths would have continued to generate parasitic and hungry &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Grub\"&gt;larvae&lt;/a&gt; and insects that would plague the humans.\nIn the Age of the Deep, Aldrich, as the owner of an immense quantity of dark soul dregs and able to control their dark power, as well as having the &lt;a href=\"Cinders%20of%20a%20Lord\"&gt;cinders of the First Flame&lt;/a&gt; within himself, would be the undisputed Lord of the world, continuing to devour whatever catches his attention for his perversed pleasure and venerated by a cult of deacons who similarly allowed themselves to be seduced by the vision of their saint. \nTo prevent the advent of the Age of Deep following the weakening of the First Flame, the plan of the Sable Church of &lt;a href=\"Londor\"&gt;Londor&lt;/a&gt; has become to tear the Flame off its Kiln and preserve it within a Lord of Hollows who can exploit its power, freezing the state of the world thanks to their Dark Sigil."}

{"id": "46110", "revid": "49243392", "url": "https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=46110", "title": "The Duke's Dear Freja", "text": "The Duke's Dear Freja is a &lt;a href=\"Boss%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20II\"&gt;Dark Souls II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\nThe Duke's Dear Freja is a gigantic two-headed spider fought in &lt;a href=\"Brightstone%20Cove%20Tseldora\"&gt;Brightstone Cove Tseldora&lt;/a&gt;. She is a guardian of one of the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Bonfire\"&gt;Primal Bonfire&lt;/a&gt;s. Unusually, despite being one of the four main bosses of the first half of the game, she does not wield a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Soul\"&gt;Great Soul&lt;/a&gt;, only guards it.\nLore.\nShe was most likely the pet of &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Tseldora\"&gt;Duke Tseldora&lt;/a&gt; who was fascinated by spiders. In &lt;a href=\"Lord%27s%20Private%20Chamber\"&gt;Lord's Private Chamber&lt;/a&gt; the player can find a small cage with torn hole in it, likely the place where the Duke kept her. At some point Freja become host of a mysterious entity called the &lt;a href=\"Writhing%20ruin\"&gt;Writhing ruin&lt;/a&gt; that grew in power, feasting on the wealth of twisted souls found in the land. This was most likely the thing that caused her transformation into her current form.\nLocations.\nNormally fought at the end of &lt;a href=\"Brightstone%20Cove\"&gt;Brightstone Cove&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=\"New%20Game%20Plus%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;NG+&lt;/a&gt; onward the Duke's Dear Freja can be encountered and fought early at the cliff just outside the cave leading into the church where the player fights the &lt;a href=\"Prowling%20Magus%20and%20Congregation\"&gt;Prowling Magus&lt;/a&gt;. It is not possible to kill her here, as she retreats when she reaches 1 HP. Any damage done here will carry across to the actual battle, but caps at 50%. If she is killed through third-party programs, the game will bug out and corrupt your save.\nNote that she only appears here the first time the player passes through and the difficulty is further increased by the three &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Peasant\"&gt;peasants&lt;/a&gt; that will engage while fighting her. Additionally, respawning her through the use of a &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20Ascetic\"&gt;Bonfire Ascetic&lt;/a&gt; will not cause her to appear here.\nStrategy.\nThe Duke's Dear Freja will only take damage when attacking either head found on both ends of her body. Hitting any other portion will simply cause the player's weapon to bounce off. Caution must be taken when approaching these spots as most of her attacks occur at her head areas. The heads are also quite hard to hit with a melee weapon but, fortunately, the lock-on system automatically targets them.\nSlower characters can stay in the area right under either leg that is beside Freja's head(s) and move in while she recovers from her attacks. It will be easy to bait her into doing her close-range attacks from here and with a long enough recovery time to get in one &lt;a href=\"Ultra%20Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;ultra greatsword&lt;/a&gt; swing and then &lt;a href=\"roll\"&gt;roll&lt;/a&gt; away. In this area, players are safe from most of her attacks, except for her jumping attack and her acid attack (her front legs slam down close to her body so the player should move further to her side).\nIf the character is fast enough, it is possible to defeat Freja by continually baiting her beam attacks. Stay at long range to trigger the ether stream, then run toward the opposite head along the character's right side while she is attacking to deal damage. Move back out to long range after attacking, then rinse and repeat.\nMany smaller &lt;a href=\"Parasite%20Spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt; minions also continually attack the player during the fight. They are easy to kill but, if left unattended, can do massive damage from behind, so killing them first is a good idea. Once all the spiders have been eliminated, there will be a short delay before another wave spawns. Use this opportunity to attack Freja.\nIt is possible to sever a head during combat if it takes enough damage. During this time, Freja will be staggered for a second or two, then slam all of her legs into the ground repeatedly. It is advisable to move out of her range when this occurs.\nIn Scholar of the First Sin, one can make this fight significantly easier by holding a torch in one of their hands. This will prevent Freja's parasite spiders from attacking them.\nSummoning.\n&lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Knight%20Boyd\"&gt;Ashen Knight Boyd&lt;/a&gt; can be summoned for this fight. His summon sign is located next to a column beneath a spider web on the opposite wall of the &lt;a href=\"Fog%20Door%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;fog door&lt;/a&gt;. He makes the fight much easier, as he will easily defeat the first wave of smaller spiders and keep the boss busy for a good portion of the fight. He also has very high defense for not having a shield and will thus last a long time during the boss fight.\nIn \"\", two additional summons were added:\nAttacks.\nLeg Slam: Freja slams her two large front legs on the ground. Powerful, but small hitbox. Simply dodge or run away from her face.\nJaw Swipe: Freja rears back and spreads her large pincers and lunges forward for a wide horizontal attack. Run to her side to avoid.\nJump Slam: Freja jumps into the air and falls down in an attempt to land on the player. Can sometimes be difficult to avoid due to her large body.\nLunge Attack: Freja rears up high into the air and thrusts quickly forward with her body. Run to her side to dodge her attack, but stay away from her head.\u00a0\nWeb Spit: Freja spits out balls of web that immobilize the player. When hit, the player will lose a massive amount of maneuverability.\nFrenzy Attack: Freja spits out multiple splatters of acid from any of her heads, which depletes armor &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; and does minor damage, while constantly slamming all of her legs on the ground for a time. Getting away from her completely is advised.\nBeam Attack: Freja fires a deadly beam of &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; horizontally from left to right. It deals extremely high damage as well as being unblockable. It is possible to roll under/through the beam with the use of &lt;a href=\"Adaptability%23Invincibility%20frames\"&gt;invincibility frames&lt;/a&gt;. The most effective tactic is to recognize the set up, then run to the opposite head to negate and deal damage.\nDefenses.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense.\n-10% strike means taking 110% damage.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 The Duke's Dear Freja by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMyPOwI82Y4&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

As well, the wooden structures that make up the level are unstable and may occasionally drop below the player's feet, moving them down a level in the buildings.\nScattered throughout the level are numerous torch sconces that can be ignited with a lit torch. Lighting these sconces can prove invaluable for navigating the level, as they can reveal hidden paths or serve as markers to indicate locations that the player has traversed before. In , lighting all of these torches will cause a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Spirit\"&gt;Dark Spirit&lt;/a&gt; to invade.\nThe level is filled with hollows, who may mob and ambush unsuspecting players who venture forth without a source of light and do not keep an eye on their surroundings. While not very threatening individually, the level's vertical design and lack of light allows them to surprise players at inopportune moments. Care should be taken while navigating the Gutter so as to avoid being overwhelmed or knocked into the abyss."}

While they have no eyes, noses or ears, they have enormous, human-like mouths and teeth. They drop &lt;a href=\"Petrified%20Dragon%20Bone\"&gt;Petrified Dragon Bone&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Scale%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dragon Scales&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Titanite%20Slab%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Titanite Slab&lt;/a&gt;s which, paired with their reptilian appearance and energy spitting ability, hints that they are some kind of twisted draconic descendant. They seem to be constantly \"bleeding\" a black fluid from the top of their bodies, much as a toad excretes poison from their backs.\nStrategy.\nDespite their large size, the Imperfect are quite agile, capable of leaping enormous distances into the air and outrunning a player. They attack using both their mouths and legs, attempting to bite or skull-bash players in front of them, and stomp upon enemies near their legs. They have a grapple attack where they catch the player with their mouths and chew on them, dealing heavy damage. If their opponent tries to keep distance, they will spit an electric sphere with great accuracy and a moderate area of effect. They have large health pools and moderately damaging attacks, but have predictable patterns and are easy to draw away from other enemies.\nThey seem to have no significant defenses, allowing almost any weapon types or elements to deal consistent damage. Even though most of their attacks can be blocked, they can do significant stamina damage. If in melee range, the player must be ready to roll away if the Imperfect gets ready to stomp or jump, as both attacks will deal significant damage, and knock the player down.\nArea of effect miracles like &lt;a href=\"Heavenly%20Thunder\"&gt;Heavenly Thunder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Splintering%20Lightning%20Spear\"&gt;Splintering Lightning Spear&lt;/a&gt; are very effective against them. Note that during their stomp attack their defense is greatly increased so it is advised to save such spell uses for when they are vulnerable."}

It has a stone pillar impaled through its torso, with many swords lodged in its back. Like the other Giants of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt;, the Last Giant lacks a face, possessing a hole where it would be.\nLore.\nThe Last Giant is the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Lord\"&gt;Giant Lord&lt;/a&gt; who laid waste to Drangleic before his defeat by an &lt;a href=\"Bearer%20of%20the%20Curse\"&gt;unknown hero&lt;/a&gt; long ago. Because of his fearsome strength, he was imprisoned beneath the stronghold where he remains to this present day. Once his arena is entered, he recognizes the player's character and charges for one last stand.\nLocation.\nWithin the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20of%20Fallen%20Giants\"&gt;Forest of Fallen Giants&lt;/a&gt;, the Last Giant is found past the second bonfire, at the bottom of a pressure plate-activated elevator.\nSummoning.\n&lt;a href=\"Mild-Mannered%20Pate\"&gt;Mild-Mannered Pate&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Sellsword%20Luet\"&gt;Sellsword Luet&lt;/a&gt; may be summoned to assist in this battle. Their signs\u00a0are located immediately in front of the fog gate. If Pate is summoned and survives the fight, when spoken to in &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Peak\"&gt;Earthen Peak&lt;/a&gt;, he will give the player his armor set, spear, greatshield, and the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Thorns\"&gt;Ring of Thorns&lt;/a&gt;. \nStrategy.\nThe Last Giant has some slow and predictable attack patterns. For this reason, it is better to wield a weapon two-handed and resort to dodging instead of blocking. After losing half of its health, the Last Giant will remove its left arm and use it as a club, giving his swinging attacks more reach. The giant will become much more aggressive in the process and will display a different moveset. Also, the closer you are the more damage it will do.\nIn the first half of the fight, the giant will use three main attacks, \u00a0the first of which is a low sweep with its left arm. This attack is fairly easy to dodge and the wind up is noticeable. Roll between the giant's legs to get a few hits in before backing away. \u00a0As the player is often right near a leg at this point, the follow up attack is usually a stomp with either foot. The third possible attack is a triple stomp, alternating feet while moving. Roll away to avoid getting crushed, and substantially stunned and damaged.\nA semi-rare occurrence during the second part of the fight involves the giant falling forwards, instantly killing the player if he/she happens to be right below.\u00a0If you are not caught in this, then it serves as a fantastic opportunity to attack. This is sometimes the Giant's first move in the fight, and the Giant can catch itself with both hands, or can land flat on its face, where it will remain motionless for more than a few seconds.\nA very simple and effective method is to use the Halberd found earlier in the level and repeatedly use the two-handed R2 spinning attack between the Giant's legs. You will deal massive damage and the only real danger is the Giant's occasional stomps, which are clearly telegraphed and easily dodged.\u00a0\nAnother relatively simple strategy is to simply get behind the Giant, and alternate between attacking a leg and moving backwards to avoid the stomp attack. By staying behind him and close to one of his legs, you'll force him to constantly repeat the same animation until he leaps backward to re-engage. By moving slightly backwards and towards his center (and wearing light enough armor), you'll move fast enough to completely dodge his stomp without rolling, leaving you a larger window and more stamina to attack him with. If you get too close to both of the legs at once (i.e. directly under him), or stay behind him for too long, he'll either jump backwards or do a 1-2-1 alternating stomp with both feet (always starts with the right foot), which interrupts your attack window. Avoid attacking him from the front and, if he manages to get away, wait until he starts running towards you to get behind him again to ensure that you have plenty of time to roll under his sweeping attack.\nAttacks.\nStomp: Stomps his feet once. Uses this move when a player is near him, can be with either foot.\nTriple Stomp Combo: Stomps his feet 3 times in a row, going from different foot each time until 3 stomps are performed.\nSlam: Uses one of his hands and slams it onto the ground. Also the same move is performed with his arm.\nSwipe: Swipes his arm/hand across the ground.\nFall: The Giant uses its entire body to hit the player by falling to the ground.\nDefenses.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Slash/Strike/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 The Last Giant by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KzmFvwaZZo&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

This area can be confusing to new players, although it becomes easier once &lt;a href=\"The%20Pursuer\"&gt;The Pursuer&lt;/a&gt; has been defeated due to the new &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt; access.\nThe Lost Bastille can be accessed from the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20of%20Fallen%20Giants\"&gt;Forest of Fallen Giants&lt;/a&gt; via the bird's nest found past the Pursuer's boss chamber or via the ship accessible in &lt;a href=\"No-man%27s%20Wharf\"&gt;No-man's Wharf&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote that a gate prevents access to a portion of the Lost Bastille if the player arrives from the Forest of Fallen Giants. There are two ways to get to the other side of the gate without going through No-man's Wharf. The first being by obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Antiquated%20Key\"&gt;Antiquated Key&lt;/a&gt; and opening the door found left of the well with a cage containing three &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Citizen\"&gt;Undead Citizen&lt;/a&gt;s. The second way is by falling off the wall through the hidden door in the room right past the set of two gates while wearing the &lt;a href=\"Silvercat%20Ring\"&gt;Silvercat Ring&lt;/a&gt; and having around 1,100 &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Lost Bastille eventually leads to &lt;a href=\"Sinners%27%20Rise\"&gt;Sinners' Rise&lt;/a&gt;, terminating with the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Sinner\"&gt;boss fight&lt;/a&gt; there."}

As such, it's often a good idea to take focus on evading the attacks as turtling often results in the player's guard being broken, which is often fatal.\nAava is very evasive, and will often keep a distance between itself and the player when not attacking. However, Aava can use the distance to give the player a false sense of security, as it can close the distance in the blink of an eye, surprising unaware players. This means that the player must make the most of the openings given, as they're unable to safely otherwise. This is especially true if they're unable to utilize ranged attacks.\nDefenses.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense. -10% thrust means taking 110% damage.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 Aava, the King's Pet by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tQRI_pEFFM&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

The strong attacks are reminiscent of those performed by &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Artorias\"&gt;Artorias&lt;/a&gt; himself. Despite requiring 18 &lt;a href=\"Faith%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Faith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, the Abyss Greatsword does not scale off of these parameters. This should discourage most builds from utilizing this weapon.\nUnusual for a weapon, the Abyss Greatsword has fairly good &lt;a href=\"magic%20resistance\"&gt;magic resistance&lt;/a&gt;, although most &lt;a href=\"shields\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; are still preferable.\nLike &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;Chaos&lt;/a&gt; weapons, the Abyss Greatsword scales with &lt;a href=\"Humanity%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;Humanity&lt;/a&gt; (up to 10). When fully upgraded, with 10 &lt;a href=\"Humanity%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;Humanity&lt;/a&gt;, and 40/40 in Strength and Dexterity, the Abyss Greatsword deals the most raw physical damage among all of the &lt;a href=\"Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; class weapons, beaten only by &lt;a href=\"Ultra%20Greatswords\"&gt;ultra greatswords&lt;/a&gt; and Great Hammers/Axes in this regard. This damage difference is not significant and when factoring in that Abyss Greatsword cannot be &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Augmentation\"&gt;buffed&lt;/a&gt;, other weapons are capable of vastly out performing this sword without putting points into two different casting stats.\nIf one does not meet the Intelligence and Faith requirements but still meet the required Strength and Dexterity, they will still be able to do full damage with the sword, but, will get a stagger animation that makes them immune to backstabs. This occurs because since the Intelligence and Faith requirements don't actually affect the damage output, but rather the Strength and Dexterity, they can completely disregard investing to get the Intelligence and Faith stats to 18. However, the drawback to this is that it will not allow one to do any follow ups, as once this sword makes contact, it will bounce off, stopping the user from doing anything for a few seconds."}

The dagger is not primarily used for offense, or even parrying, but as a hook for the Watchers to utilize their wild, unpredictable fighting style.\nBy the time the Ashen One encounters the Legion, they are mercilessly fighting one another, seemingly because some of the remaining Watchers have gone mad from exposure to the Abyss, hence their glowing red eyes.\nLocation.\nFound at the end of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Farron%20Keep\"&gt;Farron Keep&lt;/a&gt;, from the\u00a0 bonfire (which is near\u00a0two &lt;a href=\"Darkwraith%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Darkwraiths&lt;/a&gt; fighting multiple &lt;a href=\"Ghru\"&gt;Ghru&lt;/a&gt;s). From there is a\u00a0stone path (or alternatively a side path along the right exit of where the bonfire is) where the Ashen One will encounter closed chamber doors where the fighting of the\u00a0Watchers can be heard.\nLore.\nThe Abyss Watchers were the main component of the Undead Legion of Farron, a special fighting force formed to combat the threat of the Abyss. Taking inspiration from the Wolf Knight (&lt;a href=\"Knight%20Artorias\"&gt;Sir Artorias, the Abyss Walker&lt;/a&gt;), the Abyss Watchers themselves sought to utilize the techniques of Artorias, and partook of wolf blood to do so. Now equipped with the strength of Artorias, they became intensely strong and agile, fighting in a coordinated and sporadic pack akin to wolves.\nThough the Legion was not inherently evil or overtly violent,\u00a0at the\u00a0slightest threat of the Abyss the Watchers would go so far as to decimate\u00a0an entire territory. Their distinct outfits, topped off with a tall pointed helm, became an ill omen for any who saw them. Their wolf-blood fighting style was enhanced by the revolutionary use of an ultra greatsword modeled after Artorias' sword along with a carved dagger, utilizing the dagger as support\u00a0for them to develop their own unique, highly agile fighting techniques that were even more unpredictable and vicious than their predecessor. As such, they disdained the use of shields and preferred a constant offense.\nTheir wolf blood did more than enhance their bodies, but their very essence, for all those who partook in it were linked to the soul of Artorias himself. As such, instead of each body hosting distinct souls, all that partook the wolf blood share the one soul distributed among them.\nAlong with the actual Abyss Watchers, the complete Undead Legion consisted of two other levels. To assist them, the Abyss Watchers recruited acolytes, who provided support via &lt;a href=\"Miracle%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Sorcery%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;sorceries&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0\u00a0At some point, they made a pact of uncertain terms with one of the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Sage\"&gt;Crystal Sage&lt;/a&gt;s of the kingdom of Lothric, who agreed to come to &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Keep\"&gt;their headquarters in Farron&lt;/a&gt; and train their acolytes in sorcerous arts. Due to the Legion's emphasis of speed over physical power, they asked the skilled sorcerer to develop unique variations of existing sorceries for the acolytes to use. Some of them were made by a\u00a0scholar named &lt;a href=\"Heysel\"&gt;Heysel&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of the head acolyte, and refined even further than that.\nPerhaps the most telling of their fall were the number of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Farron%20Follower\"&gt;foot soldiers&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0tasked with the covert disposal of corrupted members, as the Abyss would slowly alter them, so the \"Followers\" as they were called would be sent to execute them before they were transformed into creatures. Their primary technique was to surround the target, burning and stabbing them, and finishing them with honor by throwing a spear to kill them.\nEventually, the Watchers &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;linked the Fire&lt;/a&gt;, although it is unknown if one or all had done so, but had\u00a0returned as &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lords of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;. \u00a0\nBeneath their home in Farron Keep, is the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Catacombs%20of%20Carthus\"&gt;Catacombs of Carthus&lt;/a&gt;, which contain a chalice holding\u00a0&lt;a href=\"High%20Lord%20Wolnir\"&gt;High Lord Wolnir&lt;/a&gt;, who fell to the Abyss long ago.\u00a0Along with the cindered\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Smouldering%20Lake\"&gt;Smouldering Lake&lt;/a&gt;, nearby\u00a0is the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Cathedral of the Deep&lt;/a&gt;, resting place of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Aldrich%2C%20Devourer%20of%20Gods\"&gt;Aldrich, Devourer of Gods&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith nothing to live for after the Abyss Watchers linked the flame, the Followers went hollow, roaming the land and eventually disappearing into the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Painted World of Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;. Since there were none to execute the corrupt, the acolytes were &lt;a href=\"Ghru\"&gt;slowly devolved&lt;/a&gt; by the Abyss, and Farron was consumed in a rotting bog. Once the Abyss Watchers had awakened, their home was corrupt and their mission unsuccessful. The Watchers in the keep now fight against themselves; endlessly slaying\u00a0their brethren corrupted by the Abyss.\nStrategy.\nThe fight consists of the player fighting a lone Abyss Watcher, who is present during the entire battle. More Abyss Watchers will awaken to join the battle as it progresses. These Watchers are much more fragile than the main Watcher, but they can still deal a considerable amount of damage, especially when multiple attack at once.\nEvery other Watcher that awakens, starting from the second, will be red-eyed and hostile toward other Watchers. They can directly attack the player or each other, but they will mostly focus on the other watchers. These Watchers can be used to the player's advantage, as they assist in dealing damage and taking aggro. As such, it may be a good idea to switch to a more defensive playstyle while the player waits for these Watchers to even out the odds.\nThe main Watcher, although carrying a greatsword, is extremely fast and dexterous. He is constantly jumping around and evading the players swings by doing so. He will also try to take an advantage by swinging his greatsword around the floor of the arena. Never let your guard down, each and every attack can take you by surprise.\nSecond phase.\nDepleting the main Watcher's HP will trigger a cutscene, which shows the main Watcher absorbing power from the corpses around the arena. After this, the second phase of the battle commences.\nAt this point, the Watcher's sword will ignite, causing it to deal additional &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; damage and leaving trails in the floor that erupt into large pillars of flame. The Watcher himself will also take on an Embered appearance, revealing his true form as one of the Lords of Cinder.\nThe other Watchers no longer rise during the second phase, but the main Watcher is considerably more aggressive and powerful. The fight plays out in a similar fashion, but most of the Watcher's &lt;a href=\"Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;greatsword&lt;/a&gt; attacks are altered in some way. Killing the Watcher at this point will end the fight, but dying will reset it entirely, requiring the player to beat the first phase again."}

Please keep in mind these are found via testing and \"professional\" commentary (people who helped write the guide).\nInvincibility frames.\nInvincibility frames (or i-frames) are the amount of time during a roll that a character is unaffected by enemies' attacks, measured in 1/30ths of a second (or about 0.0333... seconds each). \nInvincibility frames are increased in a non-linear way, affected by Agility rather than &lt;a href=\"Equip%20Load\"&gt;Equip Load&lt;/a&gt;, with Equip Load only affecting distance when rolling. However, having a high amount of adaptability allows you to backstep and roll through attacks that would otherwise be harder to dodge by someone with fewer points invested in the stat, as well as allowing you to even misjudge the timing for a roll and backstep and still avoid damage. \nAgility has specific breakpoints in which you gain iframes, they are the stopping points you will want to meet as you level. The only breakpoints worth caring about are 92/96/99 Agility, these are important because you do not gain additional iframes between breakpoints. This means that having 95 Agility is the same as having 92 Agility in terms of iframes. \nAgility is increased by leveling Adaptability and &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Attunement (Dark Souls II)&lt;/a&gt;, which gives 3 points and 1 points respectively. Up until 110 Agility is reached, 4 points is needed to increase it by 1 stage. After that, roughly 27 points is needed to increase Agility by 1 stage. \nFor the table below, among the &lt;a href=\"Classes%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;starting classes&lt;/a&gt; the Bandit, the Cleric, and the Warrior start at 85 Agility (needing 13, 2, and 4 \"points\" respectively to increase to 86 Agility), the Deprived, and the Swordsman start at 86 Agility (both needing 4 \"points\" to increase to 87 Agility), the Sorcerer starts at 89 Agility (needing 4 \"points\" to increase to 90 Agility), and the Explorer starts at 90 Agility (needing 1 \"points\" to increase to 91 Agility). \nCompared to &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;, 96 Agility will give you 11 i-frames which is the same as all roll types except for &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Wood%20Grain%20Ring\"&gt;Dark Wood Gain Ring&lt;/a&gt; roll type which is 13 iframes.

If left alone to shoot at the player, Cerah has incredibly high damage potential, as he is likely to stagger the player on top of doing high damage, indirectly increasing the damage output of both Varg or the Graverobber. Cerah is the most agile of the three, being able to consistently dodge many attacks, including &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;s. Attacking Cerah will cause both Varg and the Graverobber to charge at the attacker.\nThe Afflicted Graverobber is a very powerful enemy, causing heavy &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;bleed&lt;/a&gt; buildup and being able to catch the player in a stunlock. The damage potential she possesses is phenomenal. The Graverobber will work alongside Varg in a melee situation, stunning the player, then having Varg follow it up with a smash. This is best avoided by trying to separate them and taking them on one at a time.\nAncient Soldier Varg is by far the hardest to topple of the three enemies. Should he reach lower than half of his health, he will begin healing with an &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt;. He spends most of his time blocking with his greatshield, though, meaning there will be multiple opportunities to &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Break\"&gt;guard break&lt;/a&gt; him. He will attempt to work as a tank for his comrades, constantly trying to get in the way to take as much damage for them as he can.\nAll three are capable of &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;bing the player. This means caution should be taken while healing. They move slower than the player while in the water, which can be used as an advantage to get away from them, although this can become a disadvantage if Cerah's line-of-sight is not broken.\nThey are very susceptible to being \"pancaked\" by 2-handed great hammers, the only exception being Varg while he's attacking. With good positioning, you can even pancake Varg and Afflicted together, and keep pancaking them as they get up, as long as Cerah doesn't have line of sight to shoot you. This is probably the fastest way to end the fight.\n&lt;a href=\"Toxic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Toxic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; work well on all three of them, allowing high damage to be dealt at relatively low risk.\nWhen pursuing the player in melee, the bosses are willing to chase the player over the arena's ledges into the water. They tend to hesitate at the edge before jumping, and when landing will pause for a moment even after they're no longer locked into the landing animation. Thus, goading the bosses into chasing you over these edges is a reliable way to get a safe, if small opening to hit them after they land, to get a slight lead over Varg and the graverobber in their pursuit of you with which to get a hit in on Cerah, or to hit them with ranged attacks when they linger at the top of the ledge. Be careful not to stand directly below any of the bosses when doing this, as they can perform plunging attacks on you. The AI pathing also seems to have a slight preference for taking the ramps down instead of jumping off the ledges, so if you jump off while the bosses aren't particularly close or, after dropping, wander too far from the edge closest to the bosses or too close to the ramp, they may opt to take the ramp instead. This pathing preference is not terribly strong, you do not need to wait until the last second to jump off or hug the wall after jumping, just don't drop when your pursuers are halfway across the room or start running for the ramp before they've followed you over the edge.\nDefenses.\nGraverobber\nVarg\nCerah\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 Worshippers of the Dead by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OXrci_HtOI&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

Each of the Dark Souls games takes place during a late point in the Age of Fire, a point which could theoretically lead to the beginning of the Age of Dark, but which does not do so during the normal course of gameplay, with one possible &lt;a href=\"Untended%20Graves\"&gt;exception&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Darkstalker%20Kaathe\"&gt;Darkstalker Kaathe&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt;, protagonist of Dark Souls, is destined to bring about the Age of Dark, as they are the descendant of the &lt;a href=\"Furtive%20Pygmy\"&gt;Furtive Pygmy&lt;/a&gt;, who possessed the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Soul\"&gt;Dark Soul&lt;/a&gt; and divided it among early &lt;a href=\"humans\"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt; in the form of &lt;a href=\"Humanity\"&gt;Humanity&lt;/a&gt;. Should the Chosen Undead abandon the First Flame after the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;, they will \"usher in the Age of Dark\", and become the fabled \"Dark Lord\" of whom Kaathe speaks. It is important to note that Kaathe tells the Chosen Undead that the Age of Dark had apparently already begun shortly before Gwyn chose to link the Flame, though it was seemingly ended and replaced by the Age of Fire when the Flame was linked.\nWhat exactly the term \"Age of Dark\" implies is never made explicitly clear in the games, however it is stated in the canonical Dark Souls Trilogy Compendium to be a time when the Light fades, a Dark Lord is heralded, and humanity dominates the world. When the protagonists are given information about the Age of Dark, it typically comes from the mouths of potentially unreliable narrators, of whom Kaathe and his counterpart, &lt;a href=\"Kingseeker%20Frampt\"&gt;Kingseeker Frampt&lt;/a&gt;, are examples. Kaathe asserts that the Age of Dark is \"the age of men,\" presumably meaning the Age of those possessing Humanity in contrast to the Age of the Gods, and also declares that Gwyn \"resisted the course of nature\" when he linked the Flame and prolonged the Age of Fire.\nThe idea that the linking of the First Flame was unnatural and that it ran contrary to the order of the world is an important concept in the Dark Souls series, especially as the Age of Fire is prolonged perpetually by innumerable successive individuals seeking to prevent the coming of the Age of Dark.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;, countless beings have prolonged the Age of Fire, preventing its end and holding off the coming of the Age of Dark. By the time the game begins, there are countless &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lords of Cinder&lt;/a&gt; - those who successfully linked the First Flame before - and even more &lt;a href=\"Unkindled\"&gt;Unkindled&lt;/a&gt; who were unsuccessful. Eventually the one anointed to next link the Flame (and indeed, who was born for that very purpose), &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Lothric\"&gt;Prince Lothric&lt;/a&gt;, rejected the idea that the Age of Fire should be prolonged any further and instead desired to end what he called the \"fire-linking curse.\" A contingency plan was then activated, in which previous Lords of Cinder were resurrected in hopes that they, who had linked the First Flame before, might do so again. However, by this time, the world that had been created during the Age of Fire had become a twisted shadow of its former self. As a result of the prolonging of the current Age, the act of which seemingly constituted a rejection of the natural order, the material world had become irreparably corrupted, and all lands from all previous points in time had begun to converge upon a single point: the Kingdom of Lothric. Upon reviving and seeing what had become of the world they had fought to protect, the Lords of Cinder, too, rejected the linking of the Flame and refused to sit upon their thrones. &lt;a href=\"Aldrich%2C%20Devourer%20of%20Gods\"&gt;Aldrich&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Lords of Cinder, decided not to take his throne after experiencing visions of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Deep\"&gt;deep sea&lt;/a&gt; and its inevitable coming.\nFollowing the failure of this first contingency plan, a second is activated: Unkindled, those who had previously tried to link the First Flame but who had failed to do so, are resurrected from their graves in the &lt;a href=\"Cemetery%20of%20Ash\"&gt;Cemetery of Ash&lt;/a&gt;, and tasked with placing the rebellious Lords of Cinder upon their thrones so that the First Flame might be linked once more. The &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20One\"&gt;Ashen One&lt;/a&gt;, protagonist of Dark Souls III, is one of these Unkindled.\nAfter the Ashen One defeats each of the Lords of Cinder and places their remains upon their respective thrones in the &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Keeper%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Fire Keeper&lt;/a&gt; removes the embers of the Lords and bestows them upon the Ashen One, making them a \"true lord, fit to link the fire,\" and imbuing them with the power to proceed to the &lt;a href=\"Kiln%20of%20the%20First%20Flame%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Kiln of the First Flame&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, it becomes apparent that at this stage in the Age of Fire, which has been unnaturally prolonged far beyond its intended length, there is little that can be done to keep the First Flame lit. Even if the Ashen One chooses to link the Flame in Ending 1: \"To Link the First Flame\", the fire that results from this rebirth is small and feeble in comparison to the raging inferno that resulted from the Chosen Undead linking the Flame in Dark Souls. In Ending 2: \"The End of Fire\", the First Flame is snuffed out but the Fire Keeper reveals that one day another fire will ignite thus continuing the Cycle of Light and Dark - nullifying the efforts of the Ashen One. In Ending 3: \"The End of Fire (alternate)\" If you kill the Fire Keeper before the cinematic ends, the Ashen One instead takes the First Flame for themselves while the final segment of the opening narration is told: \"Nameless, accursed Undead, unfit even to be cinder...And so it is...that Ash seeketh embers.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Yuria\"&gt;Yuria&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Londor\"&gt;Londor&lt;/a&gt; urges the Ashen One to take the Flame for themselves, to usher in an Age of Dark; for the Sisters of the &lt;a href=\"Sable%20Church\"&gt;Sable Church&lt;/a&gt; were under the guidance of Kaathe. This is Ending 4: \"The Usurpation of Fire\"."}

Should the player choose to kindle the First Flame upon the defeat of Gwyn, they will sacrifice themselves as Gwyn did, thus delaying the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Dark\"&gt;Age of Dark&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0once more.\nSuch a routine of kindling the First Flame repeats itself for generations to come, until the time of &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Lothric\"&gt;Prince Lothric&lt;/a&gt;, when the prolonging of the fire proves futile.\nAs well, call it \"futile\", is practically said in a lighter form that what actually is. The unnatural prolonging of the First Flame's lifespan came with disastrous, if not, downright catastrophical proportions: when the Lords of Cinder started to resurrect, somehow, literal portions of their countries and homelands were, literally, \"teleported\" to Lothric, changing the landscape in unpredictable ways. \nBy the time \"Dark Souls 3\" takes place, the damage caused to the world by the unnatural prolonging of the Age of Fire seems to be irreversible. \nAs the games progress, the sun itself started to change, until it eerily resembled the Darksign itself.\nAt the end of the game, after defeating the Soul of Cinder, the amalgation of all the Lords of Cinder who had ever linked the First Flame, the Ashen One, in case it chose to link the First Flame, unlike the flaming inferno of the first game, the Ashen One is covered from head to toe in a soft-looking fire. The implications are clear: The First Flame itself now is so weak that it cannot be kindled anymore. \nThe First Flame, as the Age of Fire, is beyond saving.\nIn \"The Ringed City\", it is implied that the unnatural prolonging of the Age of Fire has caused an unrepairable damage to the world, as it is shown after Filianore's awakening: the fertile lands seen when the Ashen One arrived on the city were replaced by a seemingly unending, as-far-the-eye-can-see's barren wasteland of unknown nature."}

He was originally only a as Lord Aldia, a mysterious researcher who conducted horrible experiments in his mansion, &lt;a href=\"Aldia%27s%20Keep\"&gt;Aldia's Keep&lt;/a&gt;, but was added into the game proper via the \"\" enhanced edition named after him.\nIn \"Scholar of the First Sin\", Aldia, the older brother of &lt;a href=\"Vendrick\"&gt;King Vendrick&lt;/a&gt;, hints at a path for the &lt;a href=\"Bearer%20of%20the%20Curse\"&gt;Bearer of the Curse&lt;/a&gt; that differs from the one presented to them. If the conditions are met, he can serve as the final boss of \"Dark Souls II\", with his fight triggering after &lt;a href=\"Nashandra\"&gt;Nashandra&lt;/a&gt;'s; he, notably, is the only boss in any \"Dark Souls\" game not to die when defeated, and as such drops no souls nor items, with the player instead gaining the option of an alternate ending in which the Bearer of the Curse is hinted to as following this mysterious other path at Aldia's side. He is voiced by , who also voiced &lt;a href=\"Oswald%20of%20Carim\"&gt;Oswald of Carim&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\nThe Scholar of the &lt;a href=\"First%20sin\"&gt;First Sin&lt;/a&gt; appears to be a giant, charred human head covered in flames and large branches. The ground around the Scholar will be on fire. There is a single red orb near the center of his body, which is possibly an eye. His head and shoulders are all the &lt;a href=\"Bearer%20of%20the%20Curse\"&gt;Bearer of the Curse&lt;/a&gt; sees as he rises from the ground, but this could imply that there is a body below it, invisible to the player.\nLore.\nAldia is the elder brother of King Vendrick, and aided his brother in founding the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt;. He secluded himself in his manor, searching for secrets of life, viewing the Undead as the key to finding it. For his reverence of the Undead, Aldia was shunned by Vendrick, banished to his Keep forever. People who were invited to his manor commonly disappeared and were replaced with malformed beasts. The &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Ritual%20Band\"&gt;Southern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ritual%20Band\"&gt;Northern Ritual Band&lt;/a&gt;s were created by Aldia and his acolytes after cruel, horrible experiments were performed on these people. Many valuable objects came out of Aldia's Keep, including the &lt;a href=\"Sunset%20Staff\"&gt;Sunset Staff&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Spitfire%20Spear\"&gt;Spitfire Spear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Geyser\"&gt;Soul Geyser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Unleash%20Magic\"&gt;Unleash Magic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Sun\"&gt;Forbidden Sun&lt;/a&gt;.\nThrough his experiments, Aldia sought to learn the nature of the &lt;a href=\"undead%20curse\"&gt;undead curse&lt;/a&gt;, and to shed the yoke of fate. He failed, however, and turned into a monstrosity, inhabiting the bonfires.\nPlot.\nAldia serves as a lore-centric character, alluding to a great deal of things in relation to the lore of \"Dark Souls II\".\nWhen the Bearer of the Curse has defeated the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Great%20Ones\"&gt;Four Great Ones&lt;/a&gt; and lit the Primal Bonfires he will emerge and guide the Bearer of the Curse towards his brother Vendrick, now a mindless &lt;a href=\"hollow\"&gt;hollow&lt;/a&gt;. He continues to appear to the Bearer of the Curse, seeking to learn their intentions and telling them of the nature of the curse and the fabric of their world.\nHe will finally attack the Bearer of the Curse before they can take the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Want\"&gt;Throne of Want&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to test them. When Aldia is defeated, he will ask what the Bearer of the Curse wants: light, dark or something else entirely. If the Bearer of the Curse chooses to reject the throne and leave, Aldia will narrate the Bearer of the Curse's departure from the throne.\nStrategy.\nAldia is immobile when fought, but is able to teleport, releasing an area of effect attack around the area he teleports to.\nSeveral of Aldia's attacks deal mixed &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Dark&lt;/a&gt; damage, so some form of fire defense is recommended for this fight. All of his attacks deal either pure &lt;a href=\"physical\"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; or Fire/Dark damage. This means that a shield that is highly resistant to both physical and Fire/Dark damage, such as the &lt;a href=\"Rebel%27s%20Greatshield\"&gt;Rebel's Greatshield&lt;/a&gt;, will reduce his damage output greatly.\nThe Fire Orbs have moderate tracking, so &lt;a href=\"rolling\"&gt;rolling&lt;/a&gt; may be needed to fully evade. Forbidden Sun can be cast in any direction, even directly behind him. The Fire Orb and Forbidden Sun attacks can be avoided by rolling, strafing around Aldia or running perpendicular to their trajectory.\nThe withered tree branches he utilizes inflict physical damage only, making them especially prone to being blocked. At a distance, the branches extend out of the ground in a path in front of him, with moderate tracking, making it harder to roll out of the path of the attack. This is easily noted when one rolls away from the attack, but gets grazed by one of the branches, yet doesn't flinch or stagger upon getting hit.\nThroughout the fight, Aldia will surround himself in a fiery aura that makes close contact with him difficult without the risk of dying to the flames. However, an &lt;a href=\"Ultra%20Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;ultra greatsword&lt;/a&gt; can still reach. This aura also bolsters his own defenses, reducing the damage he receives from all attacks by a significant amount. The fiery aura fades when he performs certain moves, giving the player a small window to attack up close. The first opening is just after he teleports to a new location, and the second is when he is charging up his Forbidden Sun attack.\nWhen Aldia has about half of his health left, he will buff himself, intensifying the flames that cover him. He will keep this form throughout the battle. At this point, he'll start combining various of his previous attacks and cast them in succession.\nAttacks.\nFire Orbs:\nAldia will fire out four orbs of dark fire, placing them above his head. After a short time, the orbs will begin homing in on his target. He can cast this multiple times in a row. How to avoid: block with &lt;a href=\"Gyrm%20Greatshield\"&gt;Gyrm Greatshield&lt;/a&gt; or roll a few times.\nDark Forbidden Sun:\nAldia charges a large dark fireball above his head. While he does this the fire around him will disperses leaving him vulnerable. Attack him while he's charging. How to avoid: the fireball is rather easy to dodge if you roll away right before it hits.\nTree Root Dance:\nAldia slams a root into the ground, causing numerous tree roots to protrude from the ground, moving towards the player rapidly. Just like the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Snake\"&gt;Fire Snake&lt;/a&gt; pyromancy. How to avoid: the roots start appearing right in front of Aldia at the center; a root never appears twice in the same location. Knowing this, first stand closer to his left or right side to avoid the initial roots, then quickly move to stand right in front of him, where the first roots appeared, and the other roots won't be able to follow you.\nCircular Tree Root Dance:\nAldia slams a root into the ground, causing numerous tree roots to come out of the ground around him, not moving towards the player. How to avoid: watch the fire patches appearing on the ground before the roots and move away from them.\nTeleport:\nAldia can teleport at any time. Upon finishing a teleport, he emits an area of effect attack immediately. How to avoid: watch the red light that appears at the location where Aldia is teleporting, then stand back to avoid the blast (similar to &lt;a href=\"Smelter%20Demon\"&gt;Smelter Demon's&lt;/a&gt; fire blast). After that immediately run up to him to land a few hits before his flames go up.\nDefenses.\n\"Burnt out\" mode: low Lightning and Physical-type damage resistance, moderate resistance to &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Flame\" mode, 1st phase: moderate resistance to Lightning and Physical-type damage, high resistance to &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Flame\" mode, 2nd phase: high resistance to Lightning and Physical-type damage, very high resistance to &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;.\nInitial stats.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense. -10% slash means taking 110% damage.\nDialogue.\nWith the introduction of \"\", a great deal of lore-centric dialogue was added to the game, changing much of the preconceived lore. \nThe deformed Aldia is encountered several times by the &lt;a href=\"Bearer%20of%20the%20Curse\"&gt;Bearer of the Curse&lt;/a&gt;. His dialogue ranges from benign to going as far as to express outward rage at &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;. He is referred to by Aldia as the \"Lord of Light\". The scholar describes how the old Lord of Sunlight expelled the darkness, and began the cycle of light and dark. This cycle, this curse, forced &lt;a href=\"Humans\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; to assume a fleeting form, reverting them back to their hollow form. They became less than what they were, and to Aldia, this is the First Sin he has taken his name from. He claims that men are mere props, and that no matter how tender and exquisite that lie may be, it will remain a lie. The anger is audible in his voice at this point, an expression of his fury at the committing of the First Sin, the first Linking of &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;the Flame&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn his third encounter, Aldia acknowledges that for all his anger towards and deeming of the Lord of Light's actions as sinful, the world that Gwyn left behind is still one of \"\"warmth and resplendence\",\" even if it is an illusion to bury mankind's full potential. As such, he asks the Bearer of the Curse if they wish to keep living this beautiful lie in comfort and obeisance to the prophecy before them, or to strike out onto the unpaved road of the 'third path', a world in which the decay caused by the First Sin can be stopped and the cyclical nature of the world is no more.\nThe Scholar alludes to the fates of the three kings, whether or not the player has played through \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Crowns\"&gt;The Lost Crowns&lt;/a&gt;\" DLCs. He speaks also of &lt;a href=\"Vengarl%20of%20Forossa\"&gt;Vengarl of Forossa&lt;/a&gt;. When questioning what drives the player, he mentions that:\n\"One man lost his own body, but lingers on, as a head.\" Additionally, this line could equally refer to Aldia himself, given his diminished form is little more than a head also.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 Aldia, Scholar of the First Sin by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVk4cR8Zd8w&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

Despite his role as a man of faith serving the gods, he was actually a depraved being who took pleasure in devouring humans and hearing their last screams. For the cleric eating people became a routine and he continued to do it for so long that his own body bloated, becoming melted sludge. \nHis depravity had continued for so long because around the same time &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Sulyvahn\"&gt;Sulyvahn&lt;/a&gt; had risen to power in Irithyll, imprisoning &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Allfather Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt; and corrupting the ranks of the church, so much so that even &lt;a href=\"Archdeacon%20McDonnell\"&gt;Mcdonnel&lt;/a&gt;, an archdeacon of Irithyll, freely indulged in dark sorcery. However at some point even the pontiff realized the problem Aldrich posed for his city and clergy and so exiled him, gifting him with one of his &lt;a href=\"Small%20Doll\"&gt;Small Doll&lt;/a&gt;s that would have allowed him to return home . Aldritch was thus imprisoned inside the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Cathedral of the Deep&lt;/a&gt;, a church that was specialized in rituals of purification from stagnant darkness thanks to a peaceful and sacred body of water. \nContinuing to gorge himself on humans, Aldrich inevitably achieved an immense level of power and the qualifications to become a Champion to link the First Flame. As the Flame started to fade out, Aldrich was prepared to be made into a Lord just for his strength, without any consideration for his morality and how he acquired his power. Because of the importance he now held to the Way of White, Aldrich was allowed to indulge in his vices and provided with a constant stream of sacrifices, an operation overseen by the archdeacons of the Cathedral. To accomplish this task, &lt;a href=\"Evangelist\"&gt;Evangelist&lt;/a&gt;s from the Cathedral where sent to \"enlighten\" the inhabitants of the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Undead Settlement&lt;/a&gt;. Those Undead were thus convinced that their purpose was to be purified of their darkness and become the sacrifices necessary for Aldrich to ascend and save the world, thus being loaded onto carriers like cattle and made to be devoured by the future Champion. Busy devouring human flesh, Aldrich wanted to impart the means to bathe in the screams of his victims and eat the very shivers of one life. To do this he fashioned &lt;a href=\"Aldrich%27s%20Ruby\"&gt;warped magic rings&lt;/a&gt; that allowed one to feel the same depraved sensations of the repulsive maneater and recover health with fatal attacks. Those who followed the monster mutated similarly to him, transforming into &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Accursed\"&gt;bestial creatures&lt;/a&gt; with stomachs filled with the remains of their meals and infused with the power of the Deep.\nNow left to indulge in his every perversion so that he could one day link the Flame, Aldrich was even allowed to eat children, some of them his own. Aldrich, despite his unbridled hedonism, still decided to follow his ideals on the Age of Fire as a cleric and, when the time came, he sacrificed himself on the Flame to prolong its life. Before his power was fully consumed, his body, now containing a &lt;a href=\"Cinders%20of%20a%20Lord\"&gt;Cinder of the First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, was taken and entombed in a coffin inside the Cathedral of the Deep to await a day when he would once again be useful as a &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, although the monstrous man-eater had done his duty and was no longer active the effect of his stay in the Cathedral had become profound. Aldrich, continuing to devour humans and their Dark Souls, had accumulated an immense amount of darkness that remained in his body to ferment and degenerate, becoming &lt;a href=\"Human%20Dregs\"&gt;dark dregs&lt;/a&gt;, a darkness beyond any natural limit. The Cathedral's sacred and peaceful body of water that served for purification had consequently been infected, continuing to accumulate and stagnate filth to the point of becomin the \"&lt;a href=\"Deep\"&gt;Deep&lt;/a&gt;\", an abyssal sea of rotten darkness. This dark pool became a cradle of repulsive life, which began to spawn ravenous insects and &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Grub\"&gt;maggots&lt;/a&gt; that infested the corpses buried around the church and brought them back to life. The deacons of the Cathedral thus found themselves faced with the duty of sealing away the horrors that rose from the Deep with their faith and holy fire , to the point of needing grand stories to drive away the madness that the repulsiveness of the deep darkness caused to them.\nAt one point, Sulyvahn sent &lt;a href=\"Archdeacon%20McDonnell\"&gt;McDonnel&lt;/a&gt;, an Archdeacon from Irithyll that was a sorcerer despite being a high-ranking cleric, to help the deacons of the Cathedral. McDonnel thus shared his teachings of sorceries and the priests of the Cathedral became sorcerers too, turning their &lt;a href=\"Cleric%27s%20Candlestick\"&gt;holy candles&lt;/a&gt; into sorcery staves and blades, just to be able to face the abominations of the Deep. However he would soon find delight in the stagnant souls of the Deep, believing the place to be the \"bottom of the world\". Over time the deacons themselves, despite their faith and holy flame, began to succum to the power of the Deep. They began to add dark stores about the Deep to the &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Braille%20Divine%20Tome\"&gt;holy scriptures&lt;/a&gt; intended to grant them divine protection but that were not enough, thus leading to a taboo: the need to worship the Deep itself to find protection from it. McDonnel realized that the rotten darkness of the Deep could become an incredible new power, and by studying it, he created sorceries that manipulated the dark soul dregs, then imparted them to Archdeacon Royce and his deacons. The faith of the Cathedral's deacons in the gods had thus completely crumbled and they began to worship the Deep and its powerful entity: Aldrich, the \"Saint of the Deep\".\nAs the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; continued to fade and &lt;a href=\"Lothric%2C%20Younger%20Prince\"&gt;Prince Lothric&lt;/a&gt; refused to link it, the &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lords of Cinder&lt;/a&gt; of the past were exhumed from their graves to once again be used as fuel. As a result Aldrich also rose from his coffin within the Cathedral of the Deep, however the once-Lord that linked the Fire lost hope in the throne of those that were tasked with prolonging the Age of Fire and refused to sacrifice himself again. In fact Aldrich could see how in the Cathedral the same deacons who were dedicated to sealing the horrors of the Deep had succumbed to their power and the Cathedral itself had become a cradle of repulsive things. In addition, the stagnant darkness of the Deep represented a new magical power that McDonnel had developed and spread among the deacons in the form of deep sorceries and that they had begun to venerate the Deep by adding taboo miracles that called the power of the darkness rotten of the deep sea. Like McDonnel, Aldrich thus came to the conclusion that the darkness beyond humanity that had been born in the Cathedral would become the bottom of the new world, as the Flame would fade out and the Age of Fire concluded, an Age of Deep Seas was coming. The monstrous man-eater already represented an entity filled with the power of the Deep and consequently Aldrich understood how he, the Saint of the Deep, would have to open the new era. Even knowing that it would be a very long ascetism from human flesh, his new goal became to devour the gods, to destroy their hold on the world and Flame and absorb their power for himself. McDonnel obviously followed the ideals of the Saint and cast off his white robes and crown, replacing them with the color of the deep sea they venerated. Most of the Cathedral's &lt;a href=\"Deacon\"&gt;deacons&lt;/a&gt;, already infected by the rotting darkness to the point that roots grew from their eyes and bodies saw the Age of the Deep Sea beyond fire too and thus vowed themselves to the &lt;a href=\"Aldrich%20Faithful\"&gt;covenant of Aldrich&lt;/a&gt;. Together they followed Aldrich in his new crusade: eat &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Allfather Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt;, the king of gods of the city that was once his home\nAldrich thus returned to Irithyll without the &lt;a href=\"Small%20Doll\"&gt;Small Doll&lt;/a&gt; that the Pontiff gifted him in the past, forcing his way through the city's magical barrier with his army of deacons and evangelists. However, he would find his way blocked by Sulyvahn and his &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Knight\"&gt;knights&lt;/a&gt;, as the pontiff had no intention of relinquishing the source of his control over the city and the Way of White so easily. Despite the battle, Aldrich emerged victorious, slaughtering Sulyvahn's troops and defeating the pontiff, forcing him to clear the way for the &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;ruined cathedral of Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; and grant him the king of the gods as an offering. Aldrich finally managed to reach his prey and started to devour Gwyndolin's body, falling into a deep slumber to digest him. In his sleep, Aldrich was also able to absorb Gwyndolin's memories through his soul, as he dreamed about a &lt;a href=\"Crossbreed%20Priscilla\"&gt;pale girl&lt;/a&gt; in hiding.. When the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20One\"&gt;Ashen One&lt;/a&gt; seeking the &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lords of Cinder&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Cinders%20of%20a%20Lord\"&gt;Cinders of a Lord&lt;/a&gt; arrives to slay him in his quest, Aldrich awakens to defend himself, utilizing Gwyndolin's magic and body and a &lt;a href=\"Lifehunt%20Scythe%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;miracle&lt;/a&gt; developed from his dreams.\nFight overview.\nThe encounter begins with Aldrich standing on the far end of the room, imbuing his staff with &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and wielding it menacingly while he prepares for battle. He specializes in ranged combat, doing so by casting diverse dangerous magical spells. Conversely, his close combat abilities become heavily compromised due to his sluggish mobility and tendency to miss hits with his weapon. His substandard melee abilities should not be underestimated, however, because what he lacks in accuracy, he more than makes it up in damage-dealing potential.\nWhen he rears up and aims his &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Longbow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;, he will launch an expanding wave of highly damaging arrows in front of him, allowing you to circle behind him and get hits in.\nThroughout the course of the battle, Aldrich will be constantly summoning small homing projectiles. Each one of these, on its own, only deals a small amount of damage and the player may even opt to sustain a few of them in exchange of inflicting some damage to the boss. However, if they are caught by the full attack, they will sustain heavy damage, which may even kill them in a single barrage.\nAldrich is most vulnerable on his tail, which provides an area where the player may attack without risking themselves too much from being in the staff's range.\nUpon receiving some damage, Aldrich will raise his staff and create a big vortex on the ground in front of him, plunging inside to escape from punishment. This vortex is heavily damaging and the player would be wise in not attacking the boss too many times in a row, preparing instead to move away when it is cast. Aldrich will emerge a moment later on the other side of the hall, as far away from the player as possible, trying to buy some time to cast more spells.\nOnce Aldrich has lost about 40% of his health, he will buff his scythe with &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, every time he emerges from the ground, he will deal damage to nearby players while a much greater amount of homing projectiles spawn with him as he rises.\nHe will also use a replica of the &lt;a href=\"Lifehunt%20Scythe\"&gt;Lifehunt Scythe&lt;/a&gt;, starting a large windup before spinning twice in a full circle, and stealing health with each target that it connects to. This attack is telegraphed, and one can see the miracle generating on his staff, but it can often be confused for another standard swing.\nHis most devastating attack is, without a doubt, is taking out Gwyndolin's bow and shooting toward the sky, making an extensive barrage of arrows rain over the player and follow them for a considerable amount of time. He telegraphs this attack by suddenly stopping and erecting his upper body, while a white flash of light emanates from him. Being caught under the rain of arrows, practically means instant death. As soon as this attack is detected, the player is advised to completely disengage from battle and start running throughout the room with no specific direction.\nStrategy.\nAt the beginning of the fight, charge at Aldrich to avoid his hard-hitting soul spear. Get behind him and focus your attacks on his tail. This leaves him with nothing to do but swing his two slow, devastating melee attacks or teleport across the room (usually, adjacent to where he teleported from).\nAt about 55%-60% health, he will teleport and come back up, buffed with fire. His arrows also go from going forward to following a specific player. If the arrows following the player catch up to them, then that player will most likely go down quick. &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Bug%20Pellet\"&gt;Blue Bug&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Red%20Bug%20Pellet\"&gt;Red Bug Pellet&lt;/a&gt;s are recommended for this fight.\nCasting the sorcery &lt;a href=\"Twisted%20Wall%20of%20Light\"&gt;Twisted Wall of Light&lt;/a&gt; can negate Aldrich's ranged attacks, including his arrow barrage in the second phase, allowing one to wait out the attack by casting repeatedly.\n3D Model.\nThis integration requires JavaScript.

He was worshiped by the humans as the \"&lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;god of law and caste&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHe is one of the primordial humanoid creatures that appeared underground after the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; appeared and was the uncle of Lord Gwyn, implying that he was born before him\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Lord Gwyn&lt;/a&gt; sacrificed himself to link the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt;, his throne passed to his &lt;a href=\"The%20Nameless%20King\"&gt;firstborn son&lt;/a&gt; who, however, chose to \"ally\" with the dragons, the ancient enemies of the gods, and was therefore exiled and his name eradicated from history. Taking advantage of the situation and thanks to the fact of being Gwyn's uncle, Lloyd rose to power, proclaiming himself \"Main God\".\nLloyd then became the ruling deity of the Way of White and was worshiped by the humans as the god of law and social classes and his face was even minted on the golden coins used by men. After nearly all of the deities had abandoned Anor Londo, Lloyd moved his seat of power to the region of &lt;a href=\"Thorolund\"&gt;Thorolund&lt;/a&gt;, which then became the cultural and political center of the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20White\"&gt;Way of White&lt;/a&gt;. The god had absolute power over the country and thus chose among the nobles of the region the ones who would become his apostles and high priests of the Way of White, gifting them &lt;a href=\"White%20Seance%20Ring\"&gt;holy rings&lt;/a&gt; to increase their magic and making their duty the protection of law and social classes.\nUnder Lloyd the Way of White became also a militant religion, and Lloyd's cleric knights became famous for being unyielding in battle and using &lt;a href=\"Force\"&gt;miracles&lt;/a&gt;. The god also began a tradition of hunting the Undead, seen as cursed creatures in the world of humans, for which his warrior clerics were widely praised as heroes and for which they developed &lt;a href=\"Lloyd%27s%20Talisman\"&gt;special amulets&lt;/a&gt; that negated the regeneration of the Undead to better fight against their prey. However, Lloyd's own knights lived in terror of their god's judgment, which was often left to short duels, demonstrating how in reality Lloyd's government was very authoritarian and that his \"law\" was nothing more than cheap and quick violence.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt; emerged from hiding and took his place as \"Main God\" thanks to his direct descent from the previous king Gwyn he also assumed command of the Way of White and became its main deity. The religion went through a major reform and Lloyd was cast out and his personal cult forgotten by the followers of the Way of White, so much so that now the clerics of &lt;a href=\"Carim\"&gt;Carim&lt;/a&gt; openly declare that he was a \"side relation\" to Gwyn and that his title of ruling deity was self-proclaimed and unrighteous when a son of the previous king was still alive. His only legacy were the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Hunter%20Charm\"&gt;talismans&lt;/a&gt; that his knights used to hunt the Undead and that remained in use\nSome of the dethroned god's followers, now cast out as heretics, would find refuge in the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Painted World of Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;, bringing with them the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20White%20Corona\"&gt;lost miracles&lt;/a&gt; of the old religion and fully believing that one day the aureoles of light associated with Lloyd would return with him."}

They move quickly and silently, often hard to discern from the rest of the environment as their darkened armor gives them the advantage of stealth.\nLore.\nOriginally named in honor of &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Alonne\"&gt;Sir Alonne&lt;/a&gt; after he had departed the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Iron%20King\"&gt;Old Iron King&lt;/a&gt; once he helped him ascend to power. The Knights of Alonne were loyal servants of the Old Iron King\u00a0who were tasked with defending his &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Keep\"&gt;fortress&lt;/a&gt; from intruders. Even after the castle was swallowed by lava and the king was transformed into a demon, the knights continued to serve their master and protect the ruins of his kingdom.\nStrategy.\nAlonne Knights don't possess much health and are easily &lt;a href=\"stagger\"&gt;stagger&lt;/a&gt;ed by attacks. However, they are aggressive fighters and will often hop backward to avoid attacks. Their swords are capable of\u00a0causing significant &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt; buildup and they often attack in pairs. They also move very fast and can easily catch up to the player.\nTheir overhead vertical attacks come out extremely quickly and have little to no warning; parrying this attack requires you to react as fast as possible once you see the attack begin. However, they also have a significantly slower thrust attack which will bypass your parry window should you be attempting to react within the required time for their other attacks. As such, parrying them is extremely unreliable and you should avoid doing so unless you are extremely confident or have health to spare.\nKnights wielding bows can be very dangerous at a distance and their arrows cause high knockback. This can be very dangerous when traveling on narrow walkways or ledges.\nIt is recommended to try to hit them before they can get a hit on you, which will stagger them and leave them open for another hit.\nThe knights are susceptible to &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;s right before they hop backward. Circle them around when they stop attacking and then backstab them.\nIt's possible to stagger the Alone Knights by shooting them in the knees with arrows/bolts.\nThey are immune to the &lt;a href=\"Yearn\"&gt;Yearn&lt;/a&gt; spell, so plan accordingly."}

Captains of &lt;a href=\"Alonne%20Knight\"&gt;Alonne Knight&lt;/a&gt; were loyal servants of the Old Iron King who were tasked with defending his fortress from intruders along with Alonne Knights. Even after the castle was swallowed by lava, and the king was transformed into a &lt;a href=\"Demon%20%28lore%29\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;, the knights continued to serve their master and protect the ruins of his kingdom.\nDescription.\nAlonne Captains are tall, ornately armored opponents encountered in &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Keep\"&gt;Iron Keep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Drangleic%20Castle\"&gt;Drangleic Castle&lt;/a&gt;. They are deadly at all ranges, pummeling opponents with greatarrows at range, and unleashing a series of quick, deadly attacks with their lightning swords up close.\nStrategy.\nThese are deadly opponents at all ranges. Their ranged attack is slow and easy to dodge, but packs a punch if it connects and will cause knockback if blocked. They are often encountered in groups, which makes dodging arrows more difficult. It is, however, generally preferable to engage them at range, since they are very fast, and have a lightning sword attack that can penetrate shields. They are very weak to &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; damage, however, and somewhat susceptible to &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, but resist &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; to a great degree.\nIf one is confident, they can be &lt;a href=\"Parry%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;parried&lt;/a&gt;. When in melee range of an Alonne Knight Captain, you could easily dodge their attacks. They take some time to recover from performing their attacks, leaving them vulnerable to &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt;s."}

At an unknown point, she traveled to the northern kingdom of Eleum Loyce, ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Ivory%20King\"&gt;Ivory King&lt;/a&gt;, and devoted herself to him as his oracle. An &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Chaos\"&gt;ancient Chaos&lt;/a&gt; was discovered deep below the land, so in an attempt to appease the raging flame the Ivory King built a &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Cathedral\"&gt;great cathedral&lt;/a&gt; at its mouth and Alsanna prayed in silent vigilance. The attempt was unsuccessful, and the flames still raged.\nEventually, the Ivory King sensed the degradation of his soul and left Eleum Loyce without a word, leaving everything to Alsanna. Upon his departure, he gifted her an intertwined blade of shadow and light, revealing to her that he had already known about her Dark nature. He traveled deep into the Chaos for one final assault but was eventually devoured by its flames. In a last ditch attempt to quell the fiery Chaos, the Gates of Eleum Loyce were opened, allowing the cold harsh blizzard to consume the kingdom whole. \nIn spite of all this, Alsanna bravely chose to remain and devoted herself to prayer to appease the raging flame in memory of her loving lord. All the while hoping that despite all odds, he might perhaps one day return. \nPlot.\nFree the King.\nUpon entering the Grand Cathedral, Alsanna can be found at the top of a flight of stairs, surrounded by frozen branches similar to those growing from the &lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;. She will give some background to the Ivory King and Eleum Loyce when spoken to:\n\"To think Aava could be bested... Who are you? This land is barren, Cursed by the old Chaos. It gave birth to atrocities, and the people fled in fear. Until our lord, the Ivory King, came.\"\n\"My dear lord, a most true king. It was with his magnificent soul that he built Eleum Loyce... and contained the spread of chaos. But the Chaos would not be sated, and the king gave his own soul.\"\n\"Inevitably, the king was drained of vigour, and plunged into the Chaos' heart. Eleum Loyce was frozen in time, its leader lost... I remain here, to contain the Chaos, honouring my Lord's wishes. Perhaps one day, he will return... There is nothing here, save that accursed flame...\"\n\"I have but one wish. That my dear Lord might be freed from that unspeakable Chaos. I haven't the strength to help him myself, but perhaps one such as you... Though yet I am yet to know your name, stranger, will you lend me your strength?\"\nAgreeing to her offer, she replies: \"Kind visitor, I thank you. Let me open the path to Chaos. And please, do all you can...\"\nNext, a beam of light breaks the ice below the staircase, blocking a room that houses a large pit leading to &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Chaos\"&gt;The Old Chaos&lt;/a&gt;. The message \"Alsanna's seal is undone, and the winds of Eleum Loyce are ceased.\" will appear, indicating that various frozen parts of the city have now melted. She goes on:\n\"Many of Eleum Loyce's faithful knights followed their Lord into the Chaos. But not one of them returned. The King's dutiful subjects waited patiently for His homecoming. But it was too long a wait to bear... The knights of Eleum Loyce await a new leader. One who will guide them into Chaos.\"\nThis is an indication to locate the three &lt;a href=\"Knight%20of%20Eleum%20Loyce\"&gt;Knights of Eleum Loyce&lt;/a&gt; so that they may provide aid against the &lt;a href=\"Ivory%20King\"&gt;Ivory King&lt;/a&gt;. Once the Ivory King has been defeated, Alsanna will thank the player and reveal some more of her background and her connection to &lt;a href=\"Manus%2C%20Father%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Manus, Father of the Abyss&lt;/a&gt;:\n\"You've granted my one wish... Now, I have no regrets. I was born amidst the Dark. Long ago, in the depths of the Abyss, my Father perished. The Dark shattered into tiny pieces, one of which was me. How frightened I was. A frail thing, born from but a splinter of Dark. I felt that I might simply disappear.\"\n\"I am, in fact, the incarnation of my Father's fears. I sought an anchor, and I saw that a King of this land was strong. I sought him only to sustain myself, to smother my fears... Now, I realize that he may have known all along. I was born of fear, and my Lord provided comfort. And so here I remain, heiress to my Lord's wishes, watching over Chaos... until the end of time.\"\nLoyce Knight Souls.\nAfter the King's defeat, Alsanna will mention: \"The knights of Eleum Loyce were swallowed by the Chaos... where their souls still remain. I pray for their deliverance.\" This prompts the side quest to collect &lt;a href=\"Loyce%20Soul\"&gt;Loyce Soul&lt;/a&gt;s in exchange for pieces of the &lt;a href=\"Loyce%20Set\"&gt;Loyce Set&lt;/a&gt; and eventually &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20Alsanna%2C%20Silent%20Oracle\"&gt;her soul&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvery time a Loyce Knight soul is returned to her, she says: \"I sense a knight's joyous elation. Kind visitor, please accept my gratitude.\" Progressively, the formations of ice blocking the stairs will break the more souls are returned. Once 15 souls have been returned, she states:\n\"The beings born from the shards of Dark... I am not the only one. Even Dark seeks solace, and more so, souls. Magnificent souls... like your own... One day, you may encounter another. Another being, born of Dark.\"\nOnce 50 souls have been collected, the final pieces of ice break, allowing the player to meet her. She sits at the top of the staircase, kneeling in prayer. When spoken to, her dialogue will allude to her sisters, &lt;a href=\"Nashandra\"&gt;Nashandra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elana%2C%20the%20Squalid%20Queen\"&gt;Elana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nadalia%2C%20Bride%20of%20Ash\"&gt;Nadalia&lt;/a&gt;:\n\"Kind visitor. I am not the only being born of Dark. You will face hardships like no other. Take this. My sisters are as a thick Dark, their lust for souls insatiable... May you find the will to resist their desires...\"\nOnce she grants you her soul, she finishes with: \"Go on, kind visitor. May you reach your journey's end, one day.\""}

The most direct way to get there is through the sealed door and sticking to the left.\nPlot.\nAlvina enters the player into the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Hunter\"&gt;Forest Hunter&lt;/a&gt; covenant when answering \"Yes\" to both of her initial questions. Answering \"No\" to her first question will cause her to shun the player. Hurting Alvina in any way will not kill her, but it will cause her to disappear. If the player is in the Forest Hunter covenant, attacking her will also count as a betrayal and the NPCs in the forest will become hostile, including &lt;a href=\"Shiva%20of%20the%20East\"&gt;Shiva&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible to make Alvina neutral again by absolving sins with &lt;a href=\"Oswald%20of%20Carim\"&gt;Oswald of Carim&lt;/a&gt;.

At some point became a trusted friend of &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Artorias\"&gt;Knight Artorias&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Knights%20of%20Gwyn\"&gt;Four Knights of Gwyn&lt;/a&gt; and his companion &lt;a href=\"Great%20Grey%20Wolf%20Sif\"&gt;Great Grey Wolf Sif&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Artorias' death, Alvina moved to the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Oolacile\"&gt;Oolacile&lt;/a&gt;, now overgrown and known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Darkroot%20Garden\"&gt;Darkroot Garden&lt;/a&gt;\", where the knight succumbed in his fight against the &lt;a href=\"Abyss\"&gt;Abyss&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Manus%2C%20Father%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Manus&lt;/a&gt;.

The wolf settled in the forest where Artorias' tomb had been erected and, holding his companion's sword in his jaws, continued to fight to guard Artorias' rest, slaughtering the numerous Undead who arrived with the intention of plunder the tomb of the legendary knight.\nAlvina thus founded the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Hunter\"&gt;Forest Hunter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;, a clan of hunters bound with the aim of protecting the Darkroot Forest where her friend rested and Sif resided from the many adventurers who invaded it to look for the tomb of the legendary knight. Alvina would try to dissuade those who ventured into the region recently, advising them not to seek Artorias' tomb and that his legends were only fabrications and fairy tales.\nArtorias of the Abyss.\nAlvina can be encountered briefly during the events of the \"&lt;a href=\"Artorias%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Artorias of the Abyss&lt;/a&gt;\" DLC, in the &lt;a href=\"Chasm%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Chasm of the Abyss&lt;/a&gt;. She cannot be interacted with, in the traditional sense, and has no dialogue.\nShe is found after falling through an &lt;a href=\"illusory%20floor\"&gt;illusory floor&lt;/a&gt;, and leads the player to an injured but protected &lt;a href=\"Great%20Grey%20Wolf%20Sif\"&gt;Sif&lt;/a&gt;.\nElizabeth pledges to tell future generations that Artorias defeated Manus and halted the Abyss, appearing to confirm that at least part of Artorias' legend was indeed a fabrication, though he was nevertheless a brave and extremely powerful knight."}

Eventually, he asks the player if they've seen the &lt;a href=\"Purging%20Monument\"&gt;Purging Monument&lt;/a&gt;, in hopes that he can remember his former identity. The player can find Lapp throughout the &lt;a href=\"The%20Ringed%20City%20%28location%29\"&gt;Ringed City&lt;/a&gt;. He will give the player &lt;a href=\"Siegbr%C3%A4u\"&gt;a toast&lt;/a&gt; most times.\nOnce the player has found the Purging Monument, they can go tell Lapp and he will thank the player. He also promises to remember the player as a friend, no matter what. If the player has exhausted Lapp's dialogue several times and has not told him about the whereabouts of the Purging Monument prior to fighting Gael, he will become hollow and attack the player on sight.\nAfter this, the player can find Lapp sitting at a grave site, thanking the player for helping restore his memories, and promising the player will find treasure if they peep past the broken staircase. If the player does this, Lapp will then kick the player down onto the bottom of the staircase and remove his helmet, revealing himself to be &lt;a href=\"Unbreakable%20Patches\"&gt;Patches&lt;/a&gt;.\nPatches notes how every Age has been \"tainted\" with human greed. Though he claims that he himself actually lacks any true worldly wants, he still theorizes that the human race's cupidity is nothing more than core nature. Before he leaves, Patches will wave goodbye to the player: \"I'll stick you in my prayers. A fine dark soul, to you.\"\nOnce the player climbs back up, they will find Lapp's &lt;a href=\"Lapp%27s%20Set\"&gt;armor set&lt;/a&gt; where Patches once stood, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Champion%27s%20Bones\"&gt;Champion's Bones&lt;/a&gt; if they have not been previously acquired.\nDescription.\nDue to his hollowing, Lapp's mind has undergone a metaphorical factory reset, with only certain quirks and traits remaining of his true identity. While he is a friendly individual, he feels as though his former self may not have been so moral, stating that he felt as though his true self was a begrudging man. He is unusually apologetic in regards to talking about his quest, and is very kind, telling the player of a treasure, and risking himself to get it for them. It is clear that his mind hangs by a few strands, and he eventually starts to forget why he even came to the Ringed City, despite reassuring himself that he is \"unbreakable.\""}

She keeps the &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt; lit.\nAnastacia is voiced by , who also voiced &lt;a href=\"Dusk%20of%20Oolacile\"&gt;Dusk of Oolacile&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation.\nShe can be found in a cell below the &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt; bonfire, down the stairs located to the left of the &lt;a href=\"Crestfallen%20Warrior\"&gt;Crestfallen Warrior&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlot.\nInitially, she is unable to speak for her tongue had been removed sometime long ago. Despite this, the player can still interact with her. As with other Fire Keepers, Anastascia has the ability to reinforce the &lt;a href=\"Estus%20Flask%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Estus Flask&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Keeper%20Soul\"&gt;Fire Keeper Soul&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIf &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Lautrec%20of%20Carim\"&gt;Knight Lautrec of Carim&lt;/a&gt; is in &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt;, he will kill Anastacia when either one of the following occurs:\nWhile Anastacia is dead, the &lt;a href=\"bonfire\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt; in Firelink Shrine is inactive and unusable. She leaves behind the &lt;a href=\"Dingy%20Set\"&gt;Dingy Set&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Eye%20Orb\"&gt;Black Eye Orb&lt;/a&gt;. The Black Eye Orb is an invasion item, allowing players to find and invade Lautrec's world to defeat him and retrieve Anastacia's Fire Keeper Soul.\nReturning Anastacia's soul to her cage will revive her, reigniting the Firelink Shrine bonfire. Her tongue will also be restored, allowing the player to engage in conversation with her.\nOnce Anastacia is revived, if the player places the &lt;a href=\"Lordvessel\"&gt;Lordvessel&lt;/a&gt;, offers at least one &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Soul\"&gt;Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bequeathed%20Lord%20Soul%20Shard\"&gt;Lord Soul Shard&lt;/a&gt; to it, and then talks to her, she will fully kindle the Firelink Shrine bonfire.\nLore.\nAnastacia is mentioned by several characters, including herself, to be \"impure\", mainly of speech. However, what exactly made her so unclean is never revealed, as she tells very little to the player even with her tongue restored. It has been hinted from item descriptions that Anastacia chose her own banishment and even imprisonment.\nDrops.\nHer drops can only be obtained if &lt;a href=\"Lautrec%20of%20Carim\"&gt;Lautrec&lt;/a&gt; kills her."}

It is neutral to the player until it is attacked a couple of times.\nSpeaking to the Ancient Dragon will give the player the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Mist%20Heart\"&gt;Ashen Mist Heart&lt;/a&gt;, an object allowing the player to cross into the memories of the dead.\nLore.\nLittle is known of the mysterious dragon dwelling atop the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shrine\"&gt;Dragon Shrine&lt;/a&gt;. It offers the &lt;a href=\"Bearer%20of%20the%20Curse\"&gt;Bearer of the Curse&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Mist%20Heart\"&gt;Ashen Mist Heart&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to peer into the memories of things long deceased. Ironically, this very item casts doubts about the dragon's true identity and origins. It can be used in Freja's arena to enter the memory of an Ancient Dragon, where one can find the dragon's soul. The Ancient Dragon atop the Shrine however, upon defeat, will drop a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20a%20Giant\"&gt;Soul of a Giant&lt;/a&gt;.\nFurther doubts surrounding the dragon's origins are raised by &lt;a href=\"Nashandra\"&gt;Nashandra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Shalquoir\"&gt;Sweet Shalquoir&lt;/a&gt;. Nashandra refers to the dragon as a \"\"false &lt;a href=\"deity\"&gt;deity&lt;/a&gt;\"\" and a \"prop\". Sweet Shalquoir claims there is \"A great creature far to the east. A colossal thing, with the strength to match its size. Or something playing the part at least.\" This suggests that the Ancient Dragon is not a true dragon.\nRumors abound in Drangleic about the king's brother, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Aldia\"&gt;Lord Aldia&lt;/a&gt;, who tried to create a dragon. Perhaps the existence of the Ancient Dragon, and its dubious origins, are testament to his success.\nLocation.\nThe Dragon is found at the very top of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shrine\"&gt;Dragon Shrine&lt;/a&gt; in a large, open arena past the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Knight\"&gt;Dragon Knight&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Drakekeeper\"&gt;Drakekeeper&lt;/a&gt;s. Note that enemies may follow the player to the Ancient Dragon if they are not dispatched.\nStrategy.\nGoing hand in hand with its size, the Ancient Dragon has a huge amount of health and will most likely kill the player in one shot with every attack unless the player has high &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29%23Fire%20Defense\"&gt;Fire defense&lt;/a&gt; or a very high &lt;a href=\"stability\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt; shield. Its most dangerous and most common attack is when it flies up and breathes fire on to the floor, covering a large area.\nThe startup for this attack is obvious, however, so once one sees the attack coming, they can run away. When it lands, the forward fire breath can be baited out by standing somewhere in front of it. This allows the player to run behind the dragon's head and land a few hits.\nAnother strategy is staying near its tail, it gives a constant direction to run to and most of the flame attacks won't reach the player when they are at the end of it. It does, however, have a tail slam that inflicts a lot of damage, but it's easily avoided.\nIt is possible to almost become &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29%23Achieving%20the%20cap\"&gt;immune&lt;/a&gt; to its fire attacks by achieving a 890 fire defense.\nSummons may be targeted as they enter the fight, making it hard for the player to reliably summon two &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;phantoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn excellent strategy to overcome this dragon is to head straight for the back feet. Once there, the best place to stay is right between the middle and inner toes, in such a situation, the dragon will use his stomp attack almost exclusively. When he stomps, simply sprint to the other foot and continue. It is possible for him to use his inner flame attack. But this is easily avoided by simply walking away from the foot in which you were perched.\nDefenses.\n (Stats are from Param Studio and are not estimated)&lt;br&gt;Strike/Slash/Thrust defense are applied on top of Physical Defense.\nMusic.\n&lt;embedvideo service=\"youtube\" alignment=\"center\" description=\"Dark Souls 2 \u2014 Ancient Dragon by \"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQDMMpsyQQc&lt;/embedvideo&gt;"}

Upon triggering the wyvern's entrance, the player should sprint underneath it and head left, reaching some ruins inhabited by several &lt;a href=\"Man%20Serpent\"&gt;Man Serpent&lt;/a&gt;s. It is important not to delay long in this area, as the boss will use its &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;flame&lt;/a&gt; breath to incinerate anything inside. Once the player reaches a stone bridge, the fire cannot reach them, although a new threat presents itself in the form of a &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Man%20Serpent\"&gt;Giant Man Serpent&lt;/a&gt; with a retractable axe. It is strongly advised to lure this enemy back over the bridge before dashing past or engaging in combat.\nUpon reaching the wooden platforms behind the stone bridge, the wyvern will start breathing &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; along the walkways. The player should take cover until the flames cease and immediately drop to the platform directly above the boss. From here, they can perform a &lt;a href=\"Plunging%20Attack%23Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;plunging attack&lt;/a&gt; to instantly kill the monster; this is not without risk, however, as missing the hit will result in falling to their &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. As the boss will stop moving and no longer attack the player once they are above it, a safer but longer method is to eliminate it with ranged weapons.\nAlternatively, if the player does not wish to run the gauntlet, they can fight the wyvern in regular combat. It is recommended to stay under the boss to avoid its &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;flame&lt;/a&gt; breath, although it will constantly attempt to crush them with its feet. Due to the wyvern's high vitality, it is recommended to attack its neck, head, and wings to inflict more damage.\nDrops.\n&lt;tabber&gt;Boss =\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

He is a &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; that will likely prove invaluable to the player throughout the game. Andre is voiced by\u00a0, who also voiced &lt;a href=\"Ingward\"&gt;Ingward&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Petrus%20of%20Thorolund\"&gt;Petrus of Thorolund&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation.\nAndre of Astora is located directly below the &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Parish\"&gt;Undead Parish&lt;/a&gt;, between &lt;a href=\"Darkroot%20Garden\"&gt;Darkroot Garden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sen%27s%20Fortress\"&gt;Sen's Fortress&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlot.\nOften the first blacksmith new players come across, Andre of Astora can be a welcome sight.

He is also the only blacksmith that can ascend weapons down the &lt;a href=\"Raw%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;Raw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Divine%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;Divine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Occult%20%28upgrade%20path%29\"&gt;Occult&lt;/a&gt; paths.\nHe also sells some basic &lt;a href=\"upgrade%20materials\"&gt;upgrade materials&lt;/a&gt;, as well as many &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; (some of which are unique to him). Finally, he sells the &lt;a href=\"Crest%20of%20Artorias\"&gt;Crest of Artorias&lt;/a&gt;, which is required to open the door to Darkroot Forest, a more dangerous section of &lt;a href=\"Darkroot%20Garden\"&gt;Darkroot Garden&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;\", he acts as the blacksmith in &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt;. At the beginning he is unable to &lt;a href=\"infuse\"&gt;infuse&lt;/a&gt; weapons without the correspondent coals found through the game to expand his services. Once the player has found a coal, returning it to him will unlock new infusion options.\nLore.\nAndre is from &lt;a href=\"Astora\"&gt;Astora&lt;/a&gt;; however, little else is known about him but his &lt;a href=\"%23Dialogue\"&gt;dialogue&lt;/a&gt; suggests that he was betrayed by someone some time ago, although he never elaborates on this. He is also acquainted with the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Blacksmith\"&gt;Giant Blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;, as evidenced when he notices the player holding the &lt;a href=\"Giant%27s%20Coal\"&gt;Giant's Coal&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nDespite what common sense might dictate, Andre does not use his &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20Hammer\"&gt;hammer&lt;/a&gt; to fight, preferring to simply use his bare hands. This certainly does not mean that he is a pushover, however; his heavier punches can knock players off their feet, while his jabs are fast and can quickly deal a lot of damage. Andre has a roster of moves unique to him, including a drop kick that has heavy knockback and deals high damage. He also sports unusually high &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; for a character of his stature, so it may take a while to wear him down."}

They haunt the skies over the &lt;a href=\"The%20Dreg%20Heap\"&gt;Dreg Heap&lt;/a&gt; and are initially passive; however, upon detecting a threat, they will relentlessly assault the target with shards of light and can summon auras that inflict &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;curse&lt;/a&gt;.\nAngels are seemingly immortal and can only be truly destroyed by destroying the &lt;a href=\"Pilgrim%20Pupa\"&gt;Pilgrim Pupa&lt;/a&gt; that infects certain corpses of &lt;a href=\"Londor\"&gt;Pilgrims of Londor&lt;/a&gt;. This parasitic entity shares a link with the Angel and slaying it will permanently kill the creature.\nLore.\nThese angelic creatures are physical projections created and controlled by &lt;a href=\"Pilgrim%20Pupa\"&gt;Pilgrim Pupa&lt;/a&gt; that spawned from the corpses of &lt;a href=\"Londor\"&gt;Pilgrims of Londor&lt;/a&gt;. These pilgrims were Hollows exiled from Londor and sent to &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt; on a pilgrimage with the specific goal of \"dying\". They were equipped with shell-shaped protections chained to their backs, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20Set%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;robes of clerics&lt;/a&gt; created to contain the stagnant darkness that risked to become &lt;a href=\"Pus%20of%20Man\"&gt;Pus of Man&lt;/a&gt; during long journeys. In addition these pilgrims are given a &lt;a href=\"Atonement\"&gt;dark miracle&lt;/a&gt;, the only tale known to them, that they believe carry words of forgiveness. In reality they are cursed by this magic that attracts more attention from foes, and consequently accelerates the achievement of their goal of \"dying\". When they finally die as they were ordered, the bodies of the pilgrims of Londor, whose humanity had accumulated and stagnated for a very long time inside their body during their journey, undergo a peculiar transformation and from them their darkness grows and evolves into a new form of sentient life similar to a humanoid larvae.\nAs the pilgrims of Londor where sent to &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt; with the objective to die some of them died and turned into \"angels\". One day one of them managed to visit &lt;a href=\"Gertrude\"&gt;Gertrude&lt;/a&gt;, the holy maiden of &lt;a href=\"Gwynevere%2C%20Princess%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Gwynevere, Queen of Lothric&lt;/a&gt; and it revealed to her a &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Pillars%20of%20Light\"&gt;truth&lt;/a&gt; capable of manifesting pillars of light together with an heretic tale. The holy maiden was convinced by this enlightenment and began to spread the worship of those she considered \"divine messengers\". However this faith was viewed as heresy in Lothric, as it opposed the worship of the ancient gods and the duty to continue linking the First Flame and was consequently unrecognized by any of the Three Pillars that govern the realm, leading to a civil war inside the walls of Lothric between the &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Knight\"&gt;Winged Knight&lt;/a&gt;s that followed Gertrude's faith and the Angels and those still loyal to the Pillars.\nIt is also possible that the &lt;a href=\"Pilgrim%20Butterfly\"&gt;Pilgrim Butterflies&lt;/a&gt; have some connection to the Angels as well, not only due the Pilgrim in their name and general physical similarities, but also how some seemingly use the Dragonslayer Armour they control as a host; those that do dying when the Armour was slain.\nLocations.\nAll the three Angels are found in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Dreg%20Heap\"&gt;The Dreg Heap&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Dreg%20Heap%23Bonfires\"&gt;The Dreg Heap&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Dreg%20Heap%23Bonfires\"&gt;Earthen Peak Ruins&lt;/a&gt;\nStrategy.\nAngels will spawn at fixed locations through the area and immediately start launching a continuous barrage of projectiles at the player, only relenting in their assault for a brief second. Whilst they can be destroyed with ranged weapons, this is a waste of time as they will immediately respawn and resume their attack. The only way to completely eliminate them is to track down and kill their symbiotic cores. Doing so will slay the Angel and it will no longer spawn.\nEncounters with Angels force the player into seeking cover from their relentless assaults and moving from point to point. If they lose sight of the player, they will become docile and patrol the skies, resuming their attack if alerted. The Angels in Earthen Peak will summon auras of light that rapidly inflict &lt;a href=\"Curse%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;curse&lt;/a&gt; if they are unable to directly attack the player, so they should always remain on guard, even when behind cover.\n&lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Body%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Hidden Body&lt;/a&gt; is a good idea to bypass them, especially at open spaces, as the Angel will completely ignore the player. It is recommended to recast the spell frequently before it wears off to avoid alerting them."}

It plays an important role in gameplay, as the &lt;a href=\"Lordvessel\"&gt;Lordvessel&lt;/a&gt; is obtained here after defeating &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Slayer%20Ornstein%20and%20Executioner%20Smough\"&gt;Dragon Slayer Ornstein and Executioner Smough&lt;/a&gt; and reaching &lt;a href=\"Gwynevere%2C%20Princess%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt;. Two &lt;a href=\"covenants\"&gt;covenants&lt;/a&gt; can be joined in Anor Londo.\nIf the player wishes to return to &lt;a href=\"Sen%27s%20Fortress\"&gt;Sen's Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, they may speak to the &lt;a href=\"Batwing%20Demon\"&gt;Batwing Demon&lt;/a&gt; that appears where the player is placed after activating the Resonance Ring.\nNotes.\nGiant Blacksmith.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Blacksmith\"&gt;Giant Blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; is the only blacksmith that is able to create unique weapons from the &lt;a href=\"Boss%20Souls\"&gt;Boss Souls&lt;/a&gt; gathered up to this point. To forge a unique weapon the player also needs to have the corresponding &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; upgraded to +10. The option will then be presented to use the Boss Soul to modify it into a new and far more powerful weapon.\nFirekeeper's Vengeance.\nIf the player frees &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Lautrec%20of%20Carim\"&gt;Lautrec of Carim&lt;/a&gt;, and allows him to live after reaching &lt;a href=\"Blighttown\"&gt;Blighttown&lt;/a&gt;, they will find that &lt;a href=\"Anastacia%20of%20Astora\"&gt;Anastacia of Astora&lt;/a&gt;, keeper of the &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt; bonfire, had been murdered. Examining her remains will grant the dingy clothing set (notable for its curse and poison resistance) and a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Eye%20Orb\"&gt;Black Eye Orb&lt;/a&gt; to the player's inventory.\nIf the player arrives on the platform between the stairs opposite where the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Knight\"&gt;Silver Knight&lt;/a&gt; is located, the Orb will begin to resonate. It can then be used as an item to transport the player as a Spirit of Vengeance to Lautrec's realm. He will be accompanied by a mage and a pikeman. Lautrec's bodyguards only stand in the way, as he is main target, and is the only one who possesses items. Once killed, he will drop a single &lt;a href=\"Humanity%20%28item%29\"&gt;Humanity&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Souvenir%20of%20Reprisal\"&gt;Souvenir of Reprisal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Keeper%20Soul\"&gt;Soul&lt;/a&gt; of Anastacia of Astora, and a &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Favor%20and%20Protection\"&gt;Ring of Favor and Protection&lt;/a&gt;.\nDark Anor Londo.\nIf the player decides to attack &lt;a href=\"Gwynevere%2C%20Princess%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Gwynevere&lt;/a&gt;, she disappears in a dying animation. If the player has not defeated &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt; beforehand, he reprimands the player; Anor Londo darkens, and all &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Batwing%20Demon\"&gt;Batwing Demon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Bell%20Gargoyles\"&gt;Gargoyles&lt;/a&gt; (if not already defeated) disappear. The &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Sentinel\"&gt;Royal Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Knight\"&gt;Silver Knight&lt;/a&gt; greatbowman in the main hall also disappear and are replaced by two non-respawning, hostile Darkmoon Soldiers: one with a &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Soldier%20%28Sword%29\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; and another with a &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Soldier%20%28Greatsword%29\"&gt;greatsword&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Knightess\"&gt;Darkmoon Knightess&lt;/a&gt; awaits the player near the rotating platform. Killing her results in the first bonfire being unusable, but as with any extinguished bonfire, one may still warp to it. One important thing about Dark Anor Londo is, in human form, the player is susceptible to invasions (particularly from Blades of the Darkmoon), regardless of whether the player had killed Gwyndolin or not. Another thing to note about Dark Anor Londo is that within its bounds, the range in which a player may lock-on is decreased.\nIf the player is killed whilst in darkened Anor Londo, they are returned to the first bonfire regardless of whether they have rested there or not. Whether it is a glitch or an intended function by the developers is unconfirmed.\nIf the player desires to fight Dark Sun Gwyndolin via an easy return to the boss area, it is preferable to either:\nIf the player has already darkened Anor Londo and killed the Darkmoon Knightess, the fastest method will be to run to the entrance way of The Duke's Archives (only accessible after placing the Lordvessel) and using the bonfire by the elevator to warp."}

It is a subsection of &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nUnlike its Dark Souls counterpart, Anor Londo's illusionary shining sun is gone and has been replaced with the cold blue rays of the moon. The city has noticeably frozen over, as well as being severely reduced in size, with the only remaining parts of the old city being the cathedral, the rotating staircase, and the honorary tomb of Gwyn. An additional tower now stands where the entrance of the building housing the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariamis\"&gt;Painted World of Ariamis&lt;/a&gt; once stood, with an invisible walkway leading to the top where. Additionally, only three of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Knight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Silver Knights&lt;/a&gt; remain and all &lt;a href=\"Batwing%20Demon\"&gt;Batwing Demon&lt;/a&gt;s are gone. The cathedral has been overrun by &lt;a href=\"Deacon\"&gt;Deacon&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Cathedral of the Deep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Writhing%20Rotten%20Flesh\"&gt;Writhing Rotten Flesh&lt;/a&gt;. The inside of the cathedral has been covered in corpses and maggots. The eastern section of the cathedral has been blocked off by debris, but the western section is still accessible and contains the body of &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Blacksmith\"&gt;an old blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Age of Fire&lt;/a&gt;, Anor Londo was the \"City of Gods\" where &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; once ruled. &lt;a href=\"Gwynevere%2C%20Princess%20of%20Sunlight\"&gt;Gwynevere&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt;, the children of Gwyn, also lived here.\nIn the times of the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt;, things have changed. The beautiful city that once had a glowing sunlight is now cold and dark; the cathedral where the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt; once fought &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Slayer%20Ornstein\"&gt;Ornstein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Executioner%20Smough\"&gt;Smough&lt;/a&gt; is now corrupted by the Deep and the home to Gwyndolin, who took his father's title of King of the Gods but fell ill; and the chamber that once held Gwynevere now has nothing but the &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Princess%20Ring\"&gt;Sun Princess Ring&lt;/a&gt;. A denizen that came from the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Painted World&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Sulyvahn\"&gt;Sulyvahn&lt;/a&gt;, infiltrated the city of Irithyll and &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Darkmoon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Gwyndolin's Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and later proclaimed himself Pontiff. When Gwyndolin fell ill and became incapable of leading the city and the Covenant, he was forced to retire in the cathedral. The leadership passed to &lt;a href=\"Company%20Captain%20Yorshka\"&gt;Captain Yorshka&lt;/a&gt;, Gwyndolin's crossbreed sister, who was immediately imprisoned by Sulyvahn. Sulyvahn converted Irithyll's knights to the worship of the Deep. The Pontiff then led his master and Saint of the Deep, &lt;a href=\"Aldrich%2C%20Devourer%20of%20Gods\"&gt;Aldrich&lt;/a&gt;, to devour the helpless Gwyndolin.\nBonfires.\nAnor Londo is a subsection of &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt; and comprises the following &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfires&lt;/a&gt;:"}

Engaging in conversation with Anri will reveal more details about the &lt;a href=\"Crucifixion%20Woods\"&gt;Crucifixion Woods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Cathedral of the Deep&lt;/a&gt;, the lair of &lt;a href=\"Aldrich%2C%20Saint%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Aldrich, Saint of the Deep&lt;/a&gt;. Talking to Horace will cause him to gift the player with the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Sentinels%20%28item%29\"&gt;Blue Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; covenant emblem. After this meeting, both will move on to the Cathedral of the Deep, dropping their summon signs for &lt;a href=\"Deacons%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;the boss of the area&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the player has acquired the &lt;a href=\"Small%20Doll\"&gt;Small Doll&lt;/a&gt;, Anri and Horace will appear at &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt;. Talking to Anri will reveal their next destination to be &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt;, the true home of Aldrich, which lies beyond &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Keep\"&gt;Farron Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Should &lt;a href=\"Yuria%20of%20Londor\"&gt;Yuria of Londor&lt;/a&gt; be present at Firelink Shrine, talking to her will reveal that &lt;a href=\"Old%20Woman%20of%20Londor\"&gt;one of her fellows&lt;/a&gt; is guiding Anri to Irithyll, and that she intends for the Ashen One and Anri to wed.\nAfter defeating the &lt;a href=\"Abyss%20Watchers\"&gt;Abyss Watchers&lt;/a&gt; and gaining access to the &lt;a href=\"Catacombs%20of%20Carthus\"&gt;Catacombs of Carthus&lt;/a&gt;, the player can find Anri within the area, alone and distraught from being separated from Horace. The player can help them to reunite by locating Horace, and Anri will lay &lt;a href=\"Prism%20Stone%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Prism Stones&lt;/a&gt; to guide Horace to their reunion. However, unbeknownst to both Anri and the Ashen One, Horace has &lt;a href=\"hollow\"&gt;hollow&lt;/a&gt;ed within the &lt;a href=\"Smouldering%20Lake\"&gt;Smouldering Lake&lt;/a&gt; and the quest can either end or continue in one of three ways, once the player has encountered Horace at Smouldering Lake and then found Anri near the rope bridge in Carthus:\nIf Anri does not die in the Catacombs, they can next be encountered in &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt;, at the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Yorshka\"&gt;Church of Yorshka&lt;/a&gt;. Here the player can learn &lt;a href=\"Gestures%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Quiet Resolve&lt;/a&gt; through dialogue, and Anri will gift them the Ring of the Evil Eye here should they have left the Catacombs without finding out about Horace's fate. Again, Anri's questline can diverge here, depending on action taken against &lt;a href=\"Old%20Woman%20of%20Londor\"&gt;the assassin&lt;/a&gt; hidden within the Church of Yorshka:\nThe final part of the questline will begin once &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Sulyvahn\"&gt;Pontiff Sulyvahn&lt;/a&gt; has been defeated.\nIf the assassin carries through with her deed, speaking to Yuria of Londor will inform the Ashen One that Anri is ready to become their spouse, and can be found in the lair of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;the old Darkmoon god&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arriving at Gwyn's honorary tomb in &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;, the Old Woman of Londor will greet the Ashen One and present the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Avowal\"&gt;Sword of Avowal&lt;/a&gt;. The player can then proceed into the tomb and perform the wedding ceremony with Anri, gaining three &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sigil\"&gt;Dark Sigil&lt;/a&gt;s in the process. If the player returns to the tomb later (or reloads the area), they can find &lt;a href=\"Anri%27s%20Straight%20Sword\"&gt;Anri's Straight Sword&lt;/a&gt; within the honorary tomb where Anri once was.\nIf the assassin is stopped, Anri will lay a Prism Stone and a summon sign requesting cooperation in front of the doors of the grand cathedral of Anor Londo. Interacting with this sign will summon the player to aid Anri against &lt;a href=\"Aldrich%2C%20Devourer%20of%20Gods\"&gt;Aldrich, Devourer of Gods&lt;/a&gt;.

The item can be found in an area up the stairs behind the Harald Knight.\nCharacteristics.\nOne of the most complex weapons in the game, the Aquamarine Dagger has a very diverse moveset that packs a lot of power in a deceptively small package.\nIn its normal state, the Aquamarine Dagger handles much like a standard &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dagger&lt;/a&gt;.

When activated, the weapon forms a thin blade of crystal around the main blade of the dagger, granting it the reach of a &lt;a href=\"Straight%20Swords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;straight sword&lt;/a&gt;. As well, activation of the skill is context-sensitive, being able to perform running attacks, rolling attacks and even transform attacks depending on the action performed prior to using the skill. In its transformed state, it is capable of performing attack chains with consecutive weak or strong attacks, much like a normal weapon.\nProper use of the Aquamarine Dagger requires immense skill and quick reflexes, however mastering this weapon will allow its wielder to bring an onslaught of unpredictable attacks against any enemies.\nUpgrades.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

However he also became a sorcerer, as &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Sulyvahn\"&gt;Pontiff Sulyvahn&lt;/a&gt;, who took control of Irithyll and its clergy, was a sorcerer himself and had allowed the study of sorcery among the highest ranks of the Church.

McDonnel, sharing Aldrich's ideals, cast off his white robes and replaced them with robes of deep blue. The Archdeacon gathered an army of deacons and evangelists and thus abandoned the cathedral to follow the Saint of the Deep on his crusade toward Irithyll. Once Aldritch defeated Sulyvahnand took control of the city, McDonnel remained to watch over the place where the saint was busy digesting Gwyndolin, establishing the covenant of &lt;a href=\"Aldrich%20Faithful\"&gt;Aldrich Faithful&lt;/a&gt;, passing on his dark sorceries to followers who brought him evidence of success in their task.\nAt some point McDonnel was incapacitated and his body ended up in the lower levels of Irithyll, in a cistern guarded by two of Pontiff Sulyvahn's &lt;a href=\"Sulyvahn%27s%20Beast\"&gt;beasts&lt;/a&gt;, however he is still able to recognize others, as he manages Aldrich's covenant and teaches sorceries.\nLocation.\nArchdeacon McDonnell's remains can be found in &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt;, at the &lt;a href=\"Water%20Reserve\"&gt;Water Reserve&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom the &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Sulyvahn%20%28bonfire%29\"&gt;Pontiff Sulyvahn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;, proceed onward until reaching the building at the end of the big courtyard with several dead &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Slave\"&gt;Giant Slave&lt;/a&gt;s.

Contrary to what its name implies, this area does not currently contain any true dragons, as those died long ago at the hands of the first Lords. The only dragons seemingly alive is the &lt;a href=\"The%20Nameless%20King\"&gt;King of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nameless%20King\"&gt;Nameless King's&lt;/a&gt; companion stormdrake mount, and the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Wyvern\"&gt;Ancient Wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s.

Those who choose the path of the dragons strive for perfect imitation, using the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Head%20Stone%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Dragon Head Stone&lt;/a&gt; at first, then the torso stone, imbued with the everlasting dragons' power. Special \"twinkling\" stones existed for the most fervent worshipers, who imbued them not only with a more advanced dragon-like form, but also a hovering mirage of an Archdragon. The way of worship and emulation was long and arduous and only those with the most fortitude could complete it.\nArchdragon Peak can be entered only after learning the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Path of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt; gesture found upon a corpse of a &lt;a href=\"Drakeblood%20Knight%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Drakeblood Knight&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Consumed%20King%27s%20Garden\"&gt;Consumed King's Garden&lt;/a&gt;; this faction of knights can be summoned in Archdragon Peak by the man serpents there. Drakeblood Knights worshiped the blood of dragons; and the red cloth decorating their armor is said to symbolize their yearning for blood.\nIn Archdragon Peak, the &lt;a href=\"Calamity%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Calamity Ring&lt;/a&gt; is found, reportedly made from the orange eye of a calamitous dragon, the ring considered a symbol of dragon worship. This dragon was none other than &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragon%20Kalameet\"&gt;Black Dragon Kalameet&lt;/a&gt;, said to be the last one of ancient dragons.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Nameless%20King\"&gt;The Nameless King&lt;/a&gt;, known for once allying with ancient dragons, resides on Archdragon Peak. He is accompanied by a stormdrake, which he tamed and fought alongside him. &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Slayer%20Ornstein\"&gt;Dragon Slayer Ornstein's&lt;/a&gt; weapon and armor can be found laying around the Nameless King's arena; he was said to have left his guard in &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; cathedral to search for the Nameless King."}

However, this weapon cannot be used to stab from behind a shield like certain halberds can, although it can thrust with the one-handed weak attack.\nIt also helps that it has the most poise damage out of any weapon with its weight, making it extremely useful when fighting opponents with heavy armor, it is unfortunate however, that the Archdrake mace deals very little damage, has a shorter range than most halberds, and has no counter strength damage.\nThe real utility of the Archdrake Mace comes when you need to deal consistent Strike damage against heavily-armored opponents. Because it has the moveset of a Halberd, it swings faster than most weapons of its class, albeit having lesser damage than most weapons of its class. Likewise, the two-handed power attack (that of a Halberd's) is extremely useful because it is not as badly impeded by the Shaft-and-Head damage mechanic of Halberd-type weapons. The damage reduction, if the shaft hits your target, is grossly mitigated compared to full-fledged Halberds. Players who are used to the pros and cons of a Halberd will find this weapon attractive to use."}

In this state, before the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; brought any form of life and diversity, the world was undistinguished and consequently everything was made of ash-colored rocks. Like dragons, archtrees were also made of stone and were half-living, half-mineral and simply existed without any changes. They covered the surface of the world, crossing its surface for kilometers deep and reaching the sky in height. The rock wood of the archtrees was immensely capable of resisting magic.\nAt some point the creatures that found the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Soul\"&gt;Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt;s near the First Flame underground and developed their powers emerged to the surface with the intention of exterminating the Dragons and conquer the world for themselves. During the war that followerd &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Izalith&lt;/a&gt; and her daughters used sorcery and their powers to manipulate flames and weaved &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Tempest\"&gt;great firestorms&lt;/a&gt; that scorched the very earth, destroying the archtrees and burning the dragons while Nito unleashed a miasma of death, rotting the archtrees and infecting the dragons and Gwyn and his knights battled the dragons with their their mighty lightning bolts. After the long struggle the Lords emerged victorious, exterminating most of the archdragons and archtrees and thus conquering the surface world for themselves. \nDespite the brutal conflict, several specimens of archtrees continue to survive and in particular in the &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Lake\"&gt;Ash Lake&lt;/a&gt;, an immense underground cave, many of them are still intact, offering shelter to one of the last examples of archdragon descendants: the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Dragon\"&gt;Stone Dragon&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, following the war against the dragons, Izalith developed her civilization underground, building the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Izalith\"&gt;city bearing her name&lt;/a&gt; around the framework of a surviving archtree. The &lt;a href=\"Demon%20%28lore%29\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; created by Izalith's &lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; would have used the tree's stone bark to forge their &lt;a href=\"Demon%27s%20Great%20Hammer\"&gt;great hammers&lt;/a&gt;. The few archtrees that survived evolved in the giant trees found in Lordran, considered their distant offspring, and their wood still inherited the magic resistant properties of their ancestors.\nIn the region of &lt;a href=\"Drangleic\"&gt;Drangleic&lt;/a&gt;, the lower remains of an Archtree can be found in the north. Under the immense structures of the tree's roots the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Amana\"&gt;Shrine of Amana&lt;/a&gt; was built and and it was inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"Amana%20Shrine%20Maiden\"&gt;maidens of Amana&lt;/a&gt;, while, even deeper under the roots the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Crypt\"&gt;Undead Crypt&lt;/a&gt; was located. Here the &lt;a href=\"Grave%20Warden\"&gt;Fenito&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Milfanito\"&gt;Milfanito&lt;/a&gt; took care of the sleep of the undead and alleviated their suffering.\nAt the end of the world, when the First Flame has reached the last crumbs of its power, the entire world has come to converge around its &lt;a href=\"Kiln%20of%20the%20First%20Flame%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Kiln&lt;/a&gt;. The last sparks of the First Flame are located inside a immense dead archtree, cleanly sliced \u200b\u200bin half and now empty inside. The &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Prince\"&gt;Demon Prince&lt;/a&gt; took refuge inside this hollow tree after being defeated by &lt;a href=\"Lorian%2C%20Elder%20Prince%20and%20Lothric%2C%20Younger%20Prince\"&gt;Lorian&lt;/a&gt; and retreating beneath the earth."}

To create this artifact the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Soul\"&gt;Dark Soul&lt;/a&gt; must be used as pigments, consequently implying that Ariamis had access to the two primordial forces. Although it is a world enclosed in a great canvas, it can be accessed from the outside simply by touching the painting and being absorbed within by dark magic. The painting and the mechanism of entry from outside will continue to exist and function as long as even just a fragment, albeit worn and rotting, of the painting continues to exist outside of it.\nIn addition, the painted world continues to be connected to the outside world through the &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;bonfires&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lordvessel\"&gt;Lordvessel&lt;/a&gt;'s power of warping between them is able to reach inside the painting as well.\nAriamis created the Painted World as a sanctuary for Priscilla, so that she could be left alone, shaping it into a wintery forest in which the only building that can be found is an ancient cathedral and its annex serving as a storehouse. The first inhabitant was &lt;a href=\"Crossbreed%20Priscilla\"&gt;Priscilla&lt;/a&gt;, a crossbreed of the dragon &lt;a href=\"Seath%20the%20Scaleless\"&gt;Seath&lt;/a&gt; and a human woman, a creature that was feared by the &lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;gods&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; and treated as an abomination due to the fact that her own body was naturally infused with the &lt;a href=\"Occult%20%28auxiliary%20effect%29\"&gt;occult power&lt;/a&gt; capable of killing them. and possessed &lt;a href=\"Lifehunt%20Scythe\"&gt;Lifehunt&lt;/a&gt; powers. \nEventually Priscilla was drawn away from the world into the cold and lonely Painted World of Ariamis, where she would find refuge. and the artifact was placed inside a cathedral in &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; and it came to be protected by a specific order of &lt;a href=\"Painting%20Guardian\"&gt;Painting Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, such was the perceived threat she posed to the reigning Gods.. The Gods would end up using the painted world as a prison separate from the outside, a place to seal away &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ember\"&gt;dangerous artifacts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Engorged%20Hollow\"&gt;abominations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crow%20Demon\"&gt;sinners&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hollow\"&gt;Hollow&lt;/a&gt;s. Eventually, &lt;a href=\"Velka%2C%20Goddess%20of%20Sin\"&gt;Velka&lt;/a&gt;, as she was the Goddess of Sin would spread her influence inside the painted world, and dozens of &lt;a href=\"Crow%20Demon\"&gt;her cultist followers&lt;/a&gt; managed to find refuge from the outside world there. As the centuries passed, Priscilla remained in the painted world of Ariamis, isolated from the outside world that had treated her as an abomination and accepting the other forlorns who ended up populating it. She came to see herself as a guardian of the Painted World, which she characterizes as \"peaceful,\" and its inhabitants as \"kind\". She would pity those trapped within the painting, as the outside world has treated them with hate and locked them away like her too but would not be hostile to visitors from the outside world, unless provoked, and will only ask them to simply leave in peace as the purpose of the painting was to just be a refuge for lost souls. Through the centuries, Priscilla would continue to protect the inhabitants of the painted world and become their \"mistress\" continuing to welcome the forlorn souls led into the cold world by the tales of heretical storytellers, her &lt;a href=\"Lifehunt%20Scythe\"&gt;Lifehunt Scythe&lt;/a&gt; becoming the symbol of a long-lost home. The &lt;a href=\"Corvian\"&gt;humanoid corvians&lt;/a&gt; who continued to find refuge in the painting would then form a &lt;a href=\"Corvian%20Settlement\"&gt;small village&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough Ariamis' name and their figure would no longer appear in history, their knowledge of the magic connected to the painted worlds was somehow transmitted. The forlorn that found refuge in their world would develop a high understanding of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Soul\"&gt;Dark Soul&lt;/a&gt;, using the Flame to \"restore\" the Painted World by burning it when it would become corrupted from time and started to rot, to avoid the fate of the stagnating outside world. For this purpose, a \"&lt;a href=\"Father%20Ariandel\"&gt;Father&lt;/a&gt;\" was chosen among the corvians who would have to tend to the Flame present in the Painted World to burn it when the time was right and prepare the next one by restoring the painting, thus demonstrating skills and knowledge very close to those of the original creator of the painting. Although the painting is burned and regenerated, taking the name of its last restorer, the previous layer still remains in the depths of the world, as evidenced by the presence of the ancient tower in which Priscilla resided. In addition, the knowledge of how to create a Painted World through the use of First Flame and Dark Soul as pigments was also passed on to a &lt;a href=\"The%20Painter\"&gt;Painter&lt;/a&gt;, a young crossbreed girl addressed as \"Lady\" by the inhabitants of the Painted World."}

He'll relentlessly run toward the player and attack, giving little chance to find an opening. If the player opts to raise a shield, he'll be prone to perform a &lt;a href=\"guard%20break\"&gt;guard break&lt;/a&gt; and follow with two or three slashes from his &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Flame\"&gt;Blue Flame&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the time, however, he'll be casting sorceries which can cover a large area, like &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Greatsword\"&gt;Soul Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Vortex\"&gt;Soul Vortex&lt;/a&gt;. If the player is far away, he'll cast &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Spear%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Soul Spear&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nSpecial care must be taken when he invades in the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20of%20Fallen%20Giants\"&gt;Forest of Fallen Giants&lt;/a&gt;, as the player will usually be at a low level when they first visit that area. Engaging him alone is not recommended until the player has leveled up and acquired better means for both attack and defense. Low-level characters should employ the help of &lt;a href=\"Ruined%20Aflis\"&gt;Ruined Aflis&lt;/a&gt; for this fight (see below).\nA good strategy is to bring a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Hammers%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;great hammer&lt;/a&gt;, hold it with both hands and perform a strong attack to smash him into the ground. Trying to land another hit while he's recovering is arguably recommended, as he could roll away and retaliate with a quick barrage of attacks. To ensure a hit, the player may wait for him around a corner and attack him as he closes in, then find another corner where to hide in and repeat the process until he's defeated.\nEquipping armor that has high magic damage resistance, as well as wearing the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Quartz%20Ring\"&gt;Spell Quartz Ring&lt;/a&gt; and using miracles such as &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Barrier%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;Magic Barrier&lt;/a&gt; can greatly reduce if not outright negate the damage that his spells deal, leaving only his physical attacks as a threat.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Keep\"&gt;Iron Keep&lt;/a&gt;, due to the stage's layout, a different strategy should be adopted. The player can use the walls around the main gate or the two staircases going down to evade Dennis's attacks. A good strategy is to lure him into running around one of the staircases and attack him every time he's about to reach a corner. If he casts a sorcery, the player can just drop down, making his attacks miss completely and giving them enough time to heal."}

They move around by crawling and emanate a trail of smoke and soot.\nWhile they are not overly threatening by themselves, they are often encountered in large numbers and in tight corridors where players will have difficulty evading their attacks. As well, when hit by &lt;a href=\"Fire%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; they will ignite, becoming much more aggressive and moving much more quickly. They will also inflict constant fire damage when within melee range of players, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Smelter%20Demon\"&gt;Smelter Demon&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttacks.\nLeap: Leaps at the player from medium distance, knocking the player down. Deals heavy &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Dark%20Souls%20II%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; damage if blocked. Has poor tracking, so it can be dodged by rolling to the side.\nStrike: Swings its arms to attack the player. After two swings it will fall onto its belly, taking a few seconds to recover.\nExplode: When near the player, it will glow red and explode, destroying itself and inflicting area fire damage with heavy &lt;a href=\"knockback\"&gt;knockback&lt;/a&gt;; this explosion can damage and ignite any nearby Ashen Crawlers. If the player retreats quickly, it has the ability to cancel this attack, but if it has been ignited it loses the ability to cancel the explosion.\nStrategy.\nAshen Crawlers are very slow and ponderous, and their attacks can be easily baited and avoided, allowing players to deal large amounts of damage while they are vulnerable. However, they are extremely durable, requiring many attacks to destroy due to their high elemental and physical damage resistance combined with their large amount of health.\nCare should be taken when fighting Ashen Crawlers, as they will attack in numbers and can easily drain players' stamina with their attacks and deal tremendous damage while they're vulnerable. Try to focus on one at a time, and if possible try to bait their explosion attack and then retreat in order to quickly eliminate them. Given enough maneuvering space, a chain reaction can be set off amongst them where one explosion ignites or destroys several others. Beware, however, that igniting one causes it to become much more aggressive, so once one is on fire it is best to try to bait it into exploding to immediately remove it from the field."}

As the game is progressed, other characters will inhabit the shrine: &lt;a href=\"Ringfinger%20Leonhard\"&gt;Ringfinger Leonhard&lt;/a&gt;, a servant of the goddess &lt;a href=\"Rosaria%2C%20Mother%20of%20Rebirth\"&gt;Rosaria&lt;/a&gt;, who urges the Ashen One to invade the worlds of others to take their embers; &lt;a href=\"Sirris%20of%20the%20Sunless%20Realms\"&gt;Sirris of the Sunless Realms&lt;/a&gt;, on a quest to hunt down members of &lt;a href=\"Rosaria%27s%20Fingers\"&gt;Rosaria's Fingers&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=\"Yuria%20of%20Londor\"&gt;Yuria of Londor&lt;/a&gt;, a founder of the &lt;a href=\"Sable%20Church\"&gt;Sable Church&lt;/a&gt;, who urges the Ashen One to usurp the first flame.\nThe Ashen One places the Coiled Sword in the center of the shrine, creating a bonfire, and proceeds to travel to the &lt;a href=\"High%20Wall%20of%20Lothric\"&gt;High Wall of Lothric&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"High%20Wall%20of%20Lothric\"&gt;High Wall of Lothric&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ashen One then progresses through the High Wall of Lothric, now home to mindless &lt;a href=\"hollow\"&gt;hollow&lt;/a&gt; soldiers, knights, and a fire-breathing &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;. Fighting their way to a church, they encounter &lt;a href=\"Emma%2C%20High%20Priestess%20of%20Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;High Priestess Emma&lt;/a&gt;, the high priestess of Lothric castle. Emma provides them with a banner that will allow them safe passage to the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Undead Settlement&lt;/a&gt;, but warns them that their path is guarded by &lt;a href=\"Vordt%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Vordt of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt;. Emma also gives the opportunity to join the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20Blue%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Way of Blue&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Covenants%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;. Also in the High Wall is &lt;a href=\"Greirat%20of%20the%20Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Greirat of the Undead Settlement&lt;/a&gt;, a thief that will swear himself to the Ashen One if the Ashen One rescues him from his cell and promises to look for a woman named Loretta in the Undead Settlement.\nAfter finding and defeating Vordt, the Ashen One raises the banner on a ledge, and is given transport to the Undead Settlement, a dilapidated town inhabited by hollows.\nUndead Settlement.\nOnce arriving in the Undead Settlement, the Ashen One finds &lt;a href=\"Yoel%20of%20Londor\"&gt;Yoel of Londor&lt;/a&gt; praying for death at a ledge. Upon encountering the Ashen One, Yoel offers his services, providing rudimentary sorceries and offering to draw out the Ashen One's \"true strength\", not telling them that doing so will burden the Ashen One with the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sigil\"&gt;Dark Sigil&lt;/a&gt; which will make them hollow upon death.\nInside the Settlement, the Ashen One is accosted by the inhabitants of the town and pelted with massive arrows by &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Archer%20of%20the%20Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;a Giant atop a tower&lt;/a&gt;. After fighting and killing the &lt;a href=\"Curse-rotted%20Greatwood\"&gt;Curse-rotted Greatwood&lt;/a&gt;, the Ashen One will find a &lt;a href=\"Transposing%20Kiln\"&gt;Transposing Kiln&lt;/a&gt; that will allow Ludleth to provide great spells and weapons from the souls of powerful creatures.\nThe Ashen One may also rescue &lt;a href=\"Cornyx%20of%20the%20Great%20Swamp\"&gt;Cornyx of the Great Swamp&lt;/a&gt;, a master of pyromancy that will share his arts with the Ashen One. Upon finding the church in the center of the settlement, the Ashen One encounters &lt;a href=\"Eygon%20of%20Carim\"&gt;Eygon of Carim&lt;/a&gt;, a disdainful knight of Carim. If the Ashen One purchases a key from the handmaiden, they may free Eygon's ward, a blind nun by the name of &lt;a href=\"Irina%20of%20Carim\"&gt;Irina&lt;/a&gt;, who will offer to tell the Ashen One stories of miracles. After freeing her, Eygon will offer an alliance to the Ashen One, for as long as Irina's safety is guaranteed.\nInside the church, the Ashen One encounters &lt;a href=\"Siegward%20of%20Catarina\"&gt;Siegward of Catarina&lt;/a&gt;, a Catarina knight who is perplexed by a lift that will only take him down, rather than up where he wishes to speak to the Giant. If the Ashen One solves the riddle of the lift, they may make peace with the Giant, who will offer his help.\nOnce through the settlement, the Ashen One makes it to the &lt;a href=\"Road%20of%20Sacrifices\"&gt;Road of Sacrifices&lt;/a&gt;, where offerings were once transported to &lt;a href=\"Aldrich%2C%20Devourer%20of%20Gods\"&gt;Aldrich, Saint of the Deep&lt;/a&gt;.\nRoad of Sacrifices and Crucifixion Woods.\nFollowing the road leads the Ashen One to the Crucifixion Woods, where they encounter &lt;a href=\"Anri%20of%20Astora\"&gt;Anri of Astora&lt;/a&gt; and their companion &lt;a href=\"Horace%20the%20Hushed\"&gt;Horace the Hushed&lt;/a&gt;. Anri seeks Aldrich, and thinks to find him in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Cathedral of the Deep&lt;/a&gt;. They offer their help to the Ashen One, should the Ashen One need it.\nMaking their way through the Crucifixion Woods leads the Ashen One to a crossroads. One path leads to &lt;a href=\"Farron%20Keep\"&gt;Farron Keep&lt;/a&gt;, home of the &lt;a href=\"Abyss%20Watchers\"&gt;Abyss Watchers&lt;/a&gt;, whereas the other one, guarded by one of the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Sage\"&gt;Crystal Sages&lt;/a&gt; leads to the Cathedral of the Deep, home of Aldrich. Here the Ashen One may also find &lt;a href=\"Orbeck%20of%20Vinheim\"&gt;Orbeck of Vinheim&lt;/a&gt;, a sorcerer who will offer to share his knowledge if the Ashen One brings him magic scrolls.\nCathedral of the Deep.\nAfter defeating the Crystal Sage, the Ashen One follows the road to the Cathedral of the Deep. Once there, the Ashen One may encounter &lt;a href=\"Unbreakable%20Patches\"&gt;Unbreakable Patches&lt;/a&gt;, a thief and con-artist that will attempt to kill the Ashen One by luring them onto a narrow path with the promises of treasure, only to lower them below where a giant waits. If the Ashen One survives the trap, Patches will attempt to feign innocence, but if the Ashen One presses him on the matter, he will admit his wrongdoings and offer a gift in recompense, as well as selling the Ashen One his goods.\nDeep inside the Cathedral, the Ashen One finds the &lt;a href=\"Deacons%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Deacons of the Deep&lt;/a&gt; guarding Aldrich's tomb. After defeating them, the Ashen One finds that Aldrich has left the cathedral, finding instead a doll that will allow the Ashen One to enter &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter returning to Firelink Shrine, the Ashen One again encounters Anri and Horace, who tell the Ashen One that Aldrich supposedly hails from Irithyll and that he may have returned home. They will also find &lt;a href=\"Sirris%20of%20the%20Sunless%20Realms\"&gt;Sirris of the Sunless Realms&lt;/a&gt;, who shows little interest in the Ashen One, unless they provide the Handmaiden with a &lt;a href=\"Dreamchaser%27s%20Ashes\"&gt;certain ash&lt;/a&gt;, prompting Sirris to offer the Ashen One their friendship. If the Ashen One chooses to allow Yoel of Londor to draw out their true strength a sufficient number of times, Yoel will eventually die, only to be replaced by &lt;a href=\"Yuria%20of%20Londor\"&gt;Yuria of Londor&lt;/a&gt;, who attempts to sway the Ashen One into usurping the fire and becoming the Dark Lord of Hollows.\nFarron Keep.\nReturning to the Crucifixion Woods and progressing towards Farron Keep, the Ashen One finds a massive swamp. In order to make their way to the &lt;a href=\"Abyss%20Watchers\"&gt;Abyss Watchers&lt;/a&gt;, the Ashen One must extinguish three flames. After doing so, the path to the Keep opens, allowing the Ashen One to face the Abyss Watchers.\nThe Abyss Watchers, reduced to fighting amongst themselves, are defeated by the Ashen One, who claims their ashes in order to restore them to their throne in Firelink Shrine. Killing the Watchers opens the way to the &lt;a href=\"Catacombs%20of%20Carthus\"&gt;Catacombs of Carthus&lt;/a&gt;, an underground tomb filled with skeletal warriors.\nCatacombs of Carthus.\nProgressing through the trap-ridden Catacombs, the Ashen One eventually finds a rickety drawbridge that will lead them to &lt;a href=\"Irithyll%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Irithyll of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt;. If the Ashen One should choose to descend the fallen drawbridge, they may find the &lt;a href=\"Smouldering%20Lake\"&gt;Smouldering Lake&lt;/a&gt;, ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Demon%20King\"&gt;Old Demon King&lt;/a&gt; and home to various demons and a great slithering worm.\nAcross the bridge, the Ashen One finds a strange goblet that pulls them into the Abyss. Here they encounter &lt;a href=\"High%20Lord%20Wolnir\"&gt;High Lord Wolnir&lt;/a&gt;, who attacks the Ashen One. By destroying his enchanted bracelets, Wolnir will lose his grip and fall into the Abyss, allowing the Ashen One to return to the regular world, where the path to Irithyll, a frozen city guarded by an impenetrable barrier and ruled by &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Sulyvahn\"&gt;Pontiff Sulyvahn&lt;/a&gt; in the name of Aldrich, is now open.\nIrithyll of the Boreal Valley.\nThe Ashen One is able to penetrate the barrier to Irithyll with the magic doll they found in the Cathedral of the Deep. Progressing through the frozen city, the Ashen One will again come to a crossroads. They may either descend through the dungeons of Irithyll to find the &lt;a href=\"Profaned%20Capital\"&gt;Profaned Capital&lt;/a&gt;, or progress further into the city, finding the ancient city of the gods, &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;.\nProfaned Capital.\nDescending through the dungeon of Irithyll brings the Ashen One to the &lt;a href=\"Profaned%20Capital\"&gt;Profaned Capital&lt;/a&gt;, home of the reclusive &lt;a href=\"Yhorm%20the%20Giant\"&gt;Yhorm the Giant&lt;/a&gt;, one of the missing lords. Fighting their way past the gargoyles and priestesses that guard the way to the giant, the Ashen One finds him atop his throne. The enormously strong and durable Yhorm initially seems insurmountable, but the Ashen One finds the magic blade &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Ruler\"&gt;Storm Ruler&lt;/a&gt;, a sword with the ability to fell giants, beside his throne. Using the power of the blade, the Ashen One is able to bring Yhorm to his knees and kill him, collecting his ashes.\nIrithyll and Anor Londo.\nReturning to the surface, the Ashen One fights their way to the grand church in Irithyll where they find &lt;a href=\"Pontiff%20Sulyvahn\"&gt;Pontiff Sulyvahn&lt;/a&gt;. Killing Sulyvahn opens the way to &lt;a href=\"Anor%20Londo%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt;, fabled city of the gods, where Aldrich awaits. Aldrich, having lost interest in the flame and having instead turned towards the Dark, sought out Anor Londo to devour the gods themselves. He found and devoured &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Sun%20Gwyndolin\"&gt;Dark Sun Gwyndolin&lt;/a&gt; in Anor Londo, who sacrificed himself to save &lt;a href=\"Company%20Captain%20Yorshka\"&gt;Company Captain Yorshka&lt;/a&gt;.\nFighting their way past the archers protecting the city, the Ashen One finds Aldrich using Gwyndolin as a puppet of sorts, and kills him. After slaying the penultimate lord of cinder, the Ashen One is transported back to &lt;a href=\"Emma%2C%20High%20Priestess%20of%20Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;Emma, High Priestess of Lothric Castle&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"High%20Wall%20of%20Lothric\"&gt;High Wall of Lothric&lt;/a&gt;. A dying Emma begs the Ashen One to find &lt;a href=\"Lothric%2C%20Younger%20Prince\"&gt;Lothric, Younger Prince&lt;/a&gt; and tell him that he must be a lord of cinder, giving the Ashen One the &lt;a href=\"Basin%20of%20Vows\"&gt;Basin of Vows&lt;/a&gt; that will allow them access into &lt;a href=\"Lothric%20Castle\"&gt;Lothric Castle&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the Ashen One can place the basin, they are confronted by the &lt;a href=\"Dancer%20of%20the%20Boreal%20Valley\"&gt;Dancer of the Boreal Valley&lt;/a&gt;, who attacks them. After killing the Dancer, the Ashen One can place the basin and gain access to the castle.\nLothric Castle detours.\nThe Castle, home to various knights and soldiers of Lothric along with fire-breathing dragons, holds the final lord of cinder. By now, the very sun itself has become a &lt;a href=\"Darksign\"&gt;Darksign&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pilgrim%20Butterflies\"&gt;Pilgrim Butterflies&lt;/a&gt; are seen flying towards the castle. Fighting their way through the castle, the Ashen One may choose to make a detour to the &lt;a href=\"Consumed%20King%27s%20Garden\"&gt;Consumed King's Garden&lt;/a&gt;, home to the king of Lothric, &lt;a href=\"Oceiros%2C%20the%20Consumed%20King\"&gt;Oceiros, the Consumed King&lt;/a&gt;. The king, having gone mad long ago and deformed himself into a dragon-like being, ferociously attacks the Ashen One.\nAfter killing him the Ashen One can acquire two secrets. One is a gesture that will allow passage to &lt;a href=\"Archdragon%20Peak\"&gt;Archdragon Peak&lt;/a&gt;, and the other is a secret path to the &lt;a href=\"Untended%20Graves\"&gt;Untended Graves&lt;/a&gt;, a dark version of Firelink Shrine. Here the Ashen One finds &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Gundyr\"&gt;Champion Gundyr&lt;/a&gt;, and behind him, an abandoned Firelink Shrine home only to a Shrine Handmaiden. Here the Ashen One can find the &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20a%20Fire%20Keeper\"&gt;Eyes of a Fire Keeper&lt;/a&gt; which if presented to the Firekeeper will allow her to see a dark vision of the future that the Ashen One may choose to fulfill.\nIn Archdragon Peak, the Ashen One can face the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Wyvern\"&gt;Ancient Wyvern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Nameless%20King\"&gt;The Nameless King&lt;/a&gt;, once known as &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Gwyn%27s%20Firstborn\"&gt;Lord Gwyn's Firstborn&lt;/a&gt;, the old God of War who aligned himself with the Ancient Dragons.\nGrand Archives and Prince Lothric.\nProgressing through Lothric Castle will bring the Ashen One face to face with a &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer%20Armour\"&gt;Dragonslayer Armour&lt;/a&gt; controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Pilgrim%20Butterfly\"&gt;Pilgrim Butterfly&lt;/a&gt;. Defeating the armour opens the way to the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Archives\"&gt;Grand Archives&lt;/a&gt;, home to ancient knowledge.\nThe Ashen One fights their way through the Archives, and find themselves close to the location of Prince Lothric, who hides at the very top of the castle. Lothric has no intention of returning as a lord of cinder however, preferring to watch the world end from afar with his brother Lorian. The brothers attack the Ashen One, who slays them both, and claims Lothric's ashes.\nThe Painted World of Ariandel.\nWithin the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Cathedral of the Deep&lt;/a&gt; the Ashen One can encounter &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Knight%20Gael\"&gt;Slave Knight Gael&lt;/a&gt;, a Hollow Slave Knight who seeks unkindled ash to aid his mistress. Gael presents the Ashen One with a fragment of the &lt;a href=\"Painted%20World%20of%20Ariandel\"&gt;Painted World of Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;, which sucks the Ashen One in. Within the painting, the Ashen One encounters &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Friede\"&gt;Sister Friede&lt;/a&gt; and her loyal knight &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Vilhelm\"&gt;Sir Vilhelm&lt;/a&gt;. Friede is an advisor to &lt;a href=\"Ariandel\"&gt;Ariandel&lt;/a&gt;, the painting's creator, and convinced him to allow the painting to rot rather than allow it to be destroyed and replaced by a new one, despite the wishes of many of the painting's denizens. Friede bids the Ashen One to leave, telling them that they do not belong in the Painted World. \nIf the Ashen One chooses to ignore Friede and explores the Painted World, they may fight the &lt;a href=\"Champion%27s%20Gravetender%20and%20Gravetender%20Greatwolf\"&gt;Champion's Gravetender and Gravetender Greatwolf&lt;/a&gt;, which allows the Ashen One to participate in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20match\"&gt;Undead Match&lt;/a&gt;. Deeper inside the painting, the Ashen One finds the &lt;a href=\"Painter\"&gt;Painter&lt;/a&gt;, Slave Knight Gael's mistress, who has been imprisoned by Friede and Vilhelm in order to prevent her from painting the next world. If the Ashen One opens the way to the inner sanctum hiding Father Ariandel, Friede will confront them and fight to preserve the painting. After a long battle, the Ashen One defeats Friede and Ariandel, prompting the Painted World to begin burning and dooming it to destruction.\nThe Painter informs the Ashen One that she has sent Gael to find the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Soul\"&gt;Dark Soul&lt;/a&gt;, which she will use for her next painting. \nThe Ringed City.\nIf the Ashen One follows Gael, they will find themselves in the &lt;a href=\"Dreg%20Heap\"&gt;Dreg Heap&lt;/a&gt;, an amalgamation of collapsed kingdoms and civilizations at the end of time. Within the Dreg Heap they may encounter &lt;a href=\"Lapp\"&gt;Lapp&lt;/a&gt;, a hollow who seeks the &lt;a href=\"Purging%20Monument\"&gt;Purging Monument&lt;/a&gt; in order to remember his past life. Fighting their way past the Dreg Heap they find two demons, the Demon in Pain &amp; Demon Below who combine to form the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Prince\"&gt;Demon Prince&lt;/a&gt;. Defeating the Demon Prince allows the Ashen One to travel to the &lt;a href=\"Ringed%20City%20%28location%29\"&gt;Ringed City (location)&lt;/a&gt;, the first city of &lt;a href=\"Man\"&gt;Man&lt;/a&gt;, inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"Pygmy%20Lords\"&gt;Pygmy Lords&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Gwyn\"&gt;Gwyn&lt;/a&gt;, the first Lord of Cinder, gifted the city to humanity after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Ancients\"&gt;Age of Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, along with his daughter &lt;a href=\"Filianore\"&gt;Filianore&lt;/a&gt;. \nWithin the city, the Ashen One may encounter &lt;a href=\"Shira%2C%20Knight%20of%20Filianore\"&gt;Shira, Knight of Filianore&lt;/a&gt;, who asks the Ashen One to put down &lt;a href=\"Midir\"&gt;Midir&lt;/a&gt;, a mighty dragon who once served the Gods, but who has now been consumed by the Dark. Fighting their way through the city, the Ashen One finds Midir and sends him hurtling down a chasm. Chasing Midir to his lair, the Ashen One may fulfill Shira's request and fight him to the death. In the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Filianore\"&gt;Church of Filianore&lt;/a&gt;, the Ashen One finds &lt;a href=\"Judicator%20Argo\"&gt;Judicator Argo&lt;/a&gt; who bars the way to Filianore. He will summon &lt;a href=\"Halflight%2C%20Spear%20of%20the%20Church\"&gt;Halflight, Spear of the Church&lt;/a&gt; to fight the Ashen One.\nAfter defeating Halflight, the path to Filianore is open. Filianore lies sleeping while clutching a broken egg-like ceramic. If the Ashen One touches the ceramic, it will shatter into pieces and Filianore will wake, upon which a blinding light emanates from the shards of the ceramic. The Ashen One suddenly finds that the Ringed City is now a lifeless desert, and Filianore an emaciated corpse. Leaving her room, the Ashen One comes upon a fleeing Pygmy. Investigating the scene closer, they find Gael consuming one the remains of a pygmy in order to gain their Dark Soul. He proceeds to attack the Ashen One in order to gain their piece of the Dark Soul.\nThe Ashen One defeats Gael, and gains the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20the%20Dark%20Soul\"&gt;Blood of the Dark Soul&lt;/a&gt;. They may then return this to the Painter, who states that she will use the Blood of the Dark Soul to paint a Painted World that will never rot. She offers to name it after the Ashen One, and if the Ashen One gives no name, she states that she will name it the Painted World of Ash.\nSoul of Cinder.\nAfter returning to the shrine, the Ashen One places the ashes of the lords on their thrones, and the Firekeeper channels their strength to the Ashen One. The Firekeeper bids the Ashen One travel to the First Flame. Accepting the strength of the lords, the Ashen One is transported to a copy of the Firelink shrine, standing amid the wreckage of kingdoms. From there, the Ashen One proceeds to the First Flame.\nThere they encounter the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Soul of Cinder&lt;/a&gt;, a manifestation of the lords that had previously linked the flame. The Soul of Cinder takes on many forms and fighting styles, mimicking those who had linked the flames. Once the Ashen One weakens it, the Soul of Cinder assumes the style of &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Cinder&lt;/a&gt; and first one to link the flame. After defeating the Soul of Cinder, the Ashen One is presented with four options depending on the choices they made.\nOrigin.\nThe background of the Ashen One can be selected, depending of which \"Face Preset\" they choose:"}

They only pose a serious threat when they surround the player, which may happen frequently as they are usually encountered in groups of three or four.

Additionally, its Weapon Art, &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Splitter\"&gt;Shield Splitter&lt;/a&gt;, helps with its bad damage to the stamina of blocking targets by partially bypassing the defences of the block instead. \nIts &lt;a href=\"Target%20Shield%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Targeting Shield&lt;/a&gt;, while not very suitable for blocking, is one of the game's three parrying shields and as such its &lt;a href=\"Parry%20%28skill%29\"&gt;Parry&lt;/a&gt; starts slightly earlier yet ends as late as the regular parry. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Assassin%20Set\"&gt;Assassin Set&lt;/a&gt; has only moderate physical defences but has good magic and fire defences, and high overall resistances against anything that isn't &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Bleed&lt;/a&gt;. \nWhile the Assassin doesn't have any ranged attack, its &lt;a href=\"Spook\"&gt;Spook&lt;/a&gt; Sorcery is extremely useful for removing most non-fatal fall damage and for completely silencing footsteps for 20 seconds, allowing certain obstacles to be bypassed . Unfortunately, while the starting &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer%27s%20Staff%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Sorcerer's Staff&lt;/a&gt; is a fairly good spell tool, if not exactly the best, it won't actually start to gain scaling from stats until Intelligence has reached at least 19, delaying a possible strengthening of the character's Sorceries. \nPicking up the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Arrow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Soul Arrow&lt;/a&gt; Sorcery from the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20Handmaid\"&gt;Shrine Handmaid&lt;/a&gt; gives a reusable ranged attack early on, while the weapon buffing &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Weapon%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Magic Weapon&lt;/a&gt; Sorcery can be gained in either &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Settlement\"&gt;Undead Settlement&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Road%20of%20Sacrifices\"&gt;Road of Sacrifices&lt;/a&gt; to add some of a Staff's spellbuff to weapon damage.

The country in particular, was a land replete with \"royal blood\" and distinguished by the large number of nobles. In addition the famous craftsman of the region were able to build advanced devices like the &lt;a href=\"Binoculars\"&gt;binoculars&lt;/a&gt;.\nAstora was also well known for its noble elite knights whose high-ranking members employed &lt;a href=\"Crest%20Shield\"&gt;enchanted shields&lt;/a&gt; that reduced fire and magic damage and &lt;a href=\"Astora%27s%20Straight%20Sword\"&gt;high-quality swords&lt;/a&gt; imbued with a powerful blessing. The elite knights of Astora are associated with the color blue of their &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Knight%20Set\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crest%20Shield\"&gt;enchanted shields&lt;/a&gt; and they are recognized by the fire-warding heraldic symbol on their armor.\nThe country of Astora is heavily influenced by the culture of the &lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;gods of Anor Londo&lt;/a&gt; and subservient to their ideal of continuing the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Age of Fire&lt;/a&gt; through the sacrifice of a &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Undead\"&gt;Chosen Undead&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Anastacia%20of%20Astora\"&gt;Anastacia of Astora&lt;/a&gt; serves as the &lt;a href=\"Firekeeper\"&gt;Firekeeper&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Firelink%20Shrine\"&gt;Firelink Shrine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andre%20of%20Astora\"&gt;Andre of Astora&lt;/a&gt; serves as a blacksmith in the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Parish\"&gt;Undead Parish&lt;/a&gt;, both of them supporting the Undead seeking to link the Fire that came to &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt;. In addition &lt;a href=\"Solaire%20of%20Astora\"&gt;Solaire of Astora&lt;/a&gt;, deeply influenced by the cult of &lt;a href=\"The%20Nameless%20King\"&gt;Gwyn's firstborn&lt;/a&gt;, just as &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Prince%20Ricard\"&gt;Undead Prince Ricard&lt;/a&gt;, wearing the &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Knight%20Set\"&gt;Elite Knight Set&lt;/a&gt; of Astora's knights, find themselves in Lordran with the goal of reaching Anor Londo. Again, in &lt;a href=\"Oscar%2C%20Knight%20of%20Astora\"&gt;Oscar, Knight of Astora&lt;/a&gt;'s family, an elite knight of Astora, there is a legend about the Chosen Undead and the knight himself travels to the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Undead%20Asylum\"&gt;Northern Undead Asylum&lt;/a&gt; with the mission of freeing an Undead so that they could travel to Lordran and try to link the fading Flame.\nAt some point Astora was assaulted by a dark beast, with an evil eye and capable of absorbing the life of its defeated targets, that ravaged the country until the land was almost destroyed. However this horrid spirit was eventually defeated by one of the noblest knights. Although it was killed, the strength of the creature did not waver and its spirit was captured into a &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Evil%20Eye\"&gt;magic ring with its eye&lt;/a&gt; that kept its life-absorbing power.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls%20III\"&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the times and region of &lt;a href=\"Lothric\"&gt;Lothric&lt;/a&gt;, Astoria is considered a fallen and ruined country and only sayings about its noble knights remain."}

It is the first boss in the game to be encountered by the player.\nLocation.\nThe Asylum Demon is found in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Undead%20Asylum\"&gt;Northern Undead Asylum&lt;/a&gt;. It will attack the player in the exit room that lies immediately after the first &lt;a href=\"Bonfire%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;bonfire&lt;/a&gt;, through the first set of large double-doors. It can be first seen standing above the room before it jumps down to attack the player.\nDescription.\nThe Asylum Demon wields a &lt;a href=\"Demon%27s%20Great%20Hammer\"&gt;Demon's Great Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, an intimidating weapon molded from stone archtrees. The demon has an almost draconic appearance, with spotted blue-green scales all over its body and a pair of stubby wings on its back. It sports a tail and horn-like growths portrude from its legs and arms. Dark red eyes are accompanied by a set of large teeth that are revealed by the demon's permanently exposed gums.\nLore.\nThe Asylum Demon is a lesser &lt;a href=\"Demon%20%28lore%29\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; spawned from the &lt;a href=\"Bed%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Bed of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, the entity that appeared following the attempt of the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20of%20Izalith\"&gt;Witch of Izalith&lt;/a&gt; to make a power similar to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Flame\"&gt;First Flame&lt;/a&gt; using her &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Soul\"&gt;Lord Soul&lt;/a&gt;. The attempt was successful and she create the &lt;a href=\"Flame%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Flame of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; but Izalith and her powerful soul became a seedbed for a new lifeform: the mother and source of all demons. After its birth, the Asylum Demon managed to survive the war that the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Knight\"&gt;Silver Knight&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%2C%20Lord%20of%20Cinder\"&gt;Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; waged against its kind and at some point it was able to escape from the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Izalith\"&gt;Lost Izalith&lt;/a&gt;, bringing its &lt;a href=\"Demon%27s%20Great%20Hammer\"&gt;Demon's Great Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, made from the stone archtrees, with it. The demon wandered &lt;a href=\"Lordran\"&gt;Lordran&lt;/a&gt; until it came to reside in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Undead%20Asylum\"&gt;Northern Undead Asylum&lt;/a&gt;, the prison designed to keep &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; locked away from the rest of the world until the end of time, and that became its domain.\nStrategy.\nThe first encounter with the Asylum Demon is optional and it is highly advised for first-time players to escape the room to avoid confrontation. However, if the player has obtained &lt;a href=\"Black%20Firebomb\"&gt;Black Firebomb&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0as a &lt;a href=\"starting%20gift\"&gt;starting gift&lt;/a&gt;, they can be\u00a0used to defeat the demon relatively quickly, requiring just 5 of them (in NG). Killing the Asylum Demon within this first encounter will yield the &lt;a href=\"Demon%27s%20Great%20Hammer\"&gt;Demon's Great Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. \nShould the player avoid the first encounter, they will have to endure the mandatory second encounter with the Asylum Demon. However, the player can gain a massive advantage by using a &lt;a href=\"Plunging%20Attack%23Dark%20Souls\"&gt;plunging attack&lt;/a&gt; from the ledge above the boss. This will typically deal 1/4 of its health bar, varying depending on which weapon is used. Take note that wielding one's weapon two-handed is recommended for the plunging attack, as it will increase the damage of the attack. Furthermore, players should not stand upon the platform for too long because the demon will eventually leap up and destroy the platform, potentially killing the player.\nOn &lt;a href=\"New%20Game%20Plus\"&gt;New Game Plus&lt;/a&gt;, the Asylum Demon can be easily defeated in the first encounter as the player retains all of their &lt;a href=\"equipment\"&gt;equipment&lt;/a&gt; from their previous playthrough.\nBoss information.\nAttacks.\nThe attacks of the Asylum Demon are similar to, if not the same as, the Vanguard Demon's from\u00a0\"Demon's Souls\".\nButt Slam.\nThe Asylum Demon flies up, pauses, and then allows itself to fall, dealing massive damage if it hits. Very easy to dodge, as it is well telegraphed. Has a slight &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;area of effect&lt;/a&gt;.\nHammer Drive.\nUsed by the Demon when the player is standing right in front of it. Impossible to dodge if standing in front of it.\nHammer Swing.\nA horizontal swing of the Asylum Demon's hammer. Has poor tracking, and is easy to avoid.\nHammer Backswing.\nUsed when the player is side-stepping to its right. Can be dodged by rolling at the last second.\nHammer Scoop.\nUsed when the player is side-stepping to its left. Once again, rolling at the last second allows the player to dodge it.\nHammer Smash.\nA downward smash. Has a large range, but is fairly easy to avoid.\nLeaping Hammer Smash.\nUsed when the player is far away from the Demon. Before attacking, the Asylum Demon will flutter it's wings. Easy to dodge.\nDouble Hammer Swing.\nA combo of Hammer Swings. It has slightly better tracking than it's predecessor, and may be followed up with a Hammer Smash attack."}

Attack dogs have the ability to ignore all forms of incoming damage for a brief time before they attack, and after. This effect also applies before and during any of their dodges, though not after. These invincibility frames are nearly impossible to distinguish from the rest of the dogs actions, it makes it seem as if the dog simply stands still, ignoring attacks for a moment. Time your attacks well to ensure you strike them."}

Its chest is sitting on top of a bookcase to the left of the &lt;a href=\"Channeler\"&gt;Channeler&lt;/a&gt;. Reaching Avelyn requires the player to jump off of the rotating staircase while it is still in motion.\nCharacteristics.\nThe fact that it shoots three bolts at once means that it takes three times as much ammunition as any other crossbow in the game, so make those shots count. If only a single bolt hits an enemy most of the time, it's better to use the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Crossbow%20%28Dark%20Souls%29\"&gt;Heavy Crossbow&lt;/a&gt; instead, as it is lighter and has higher damage-per-bolt ratio.\nLike all crossbows, you cannot aim down sights so the &lt;a href=\"Binoculars\"&gt;Binoculars&lt;/a&gt; can help with aiming. With the Binoculars, line the target up in the exact center of the screen. Change to Avelyn without moving the camera, then fire. Despite its unique nature, Avelyn is considered a standard crossbow and can be\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Modification\"&gt;upgraded&lt;/a&gt; as such. Like all crossbows Avelyn does not scale off any stats though upgrading increases base damage, if infusing the AR of elemental bolts is added to the elemental AR of the infusion, which can be beneficial. Use &lt;a href=\"Ammunition\"&gt;ammo&lt;/a&gt; types that elementally match the infusion when possible and factor in enemy resistances when choosing an infusion and/or ammo type.\nThere is a way to get Avelyn without moving off the staircase. When a save is loaded, the game will not put the player on any piece of environment that can move. This includes all elevators, platforms, and it also includes the stairs in The Duke's Archives. You may have noticed in the past that your souls got dropped in the last \"solid\" place you were standing if you died in an odd position. Follow these detailed (but simple) steps to get Avelyn without having to jump off a moving staircase."}

Though weak on their own, hitting with all three bolts can triple the listed attack rating, making the Avelyn deceptively powerful. Though the reload animation is relatively fast, proper care must be taken when firing as it's impossible to evade incoming attacks until the reload cycle is complete. With the implication of &lt;a href=\"Power%20Stance\"&gt;Power Stancing&lt;/a&gt;, it's possible to fire 6 crossbow bolts; Allowing a higher Damage Per Second. "}

Upon exiting the latter, head straight and either jump or roll diagonally and to the left from the top of the (kickable) ladder to land over a series of bookshelves where the crossbow lies.\nIt is advisable to equip the &lt;a href=\"Silvercat%20Ring%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Silvercat Ring&lt;/a&gt; or cast &lt;a href=\"Spook\"&gt;Spook&lt;/a&gt;, and also deal with the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Sage\"&gt;Crystal Sage&lt;/a&gt; before attempting the jump.\nCharacteristics.\nA time-honored weapon from the previous \"Dark Souls\" games, the Avelyn is characterized by its ability to fire three arrows in quick succession.\nIn terms of raw damage, the Avelyn inflicts the least damage per arrow out of all the crossbows, moreso since the Avelyn suffers from a 5% damage reduction when using physical damage bolts. However, by firing three bolts in a single salvo it is capable of inflicting more damage in a single attack than everything short of the &lt;a href=\"Repeating%20Crossbow\"&gt;Repeating Crossbow&lt;/a&gt;'s skill, &lt;a href=\"Repeat%20Fire\"&gt;Repeat Fire&lt;/a&gt;, assuming that all bolts hit the target. As well, the Avelyn has the special distinction of loosing its first bolt slightly faster than the one shot from standard crossbows, making target tracking easier.\nHowever, the Avelyn also has the unfortunate distinction of being the heaviest crossbow in the game, tying with the Repeating Crossbow and &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Crossbow%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;Sniper Crossbow&lt;/a&gt;. This can make it an extremely cumbersome weapon, as it weighs almost as much as some &lt;a href=\"Greatswords%20%28Dark%20Souls%20III%29\"&gt;greatswords&lt;/a&gt;, and thus equipment loadouts must be planned around wielding such a weapon. Additionally, with a shot range of only 35, it is easily the shortest-ranged weapon in the game, meaning that even if a target is within lock-on range there is no guarantee that projectiles will deal their maximum potential damage. As such, combined with its poor accuracy the Avelyn requires its user to be practically within melee range to make the most of its damage.\nIf damage output is a greater concern than ammunition conservation and weight considerations, then the Avelyn can be a powerful weapon in the right hands.\nUpgrades.\n&lt;br&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;br&gt;"}
