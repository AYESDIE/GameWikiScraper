Unlike the previous game (\"\"), the soundtrack consists mostly of original music, much like the original (with the exception of a few licensed tracks).\nThe radio station format from previous games was expanded upon in multiple ways.\nMost notably, this was the first game in the franchise to feature radio advertisements, something that would return in subsequent games. The commercials use recognizable tropes and clich\u00e9s, oftentimes used in real life commercials, to advertise fictional products in humorous ways. Unlike in previous games, which have little to no commentary given by on-air personalities, the radio hosts in often feature in-depth dialogue that can give the player a better understanding of each host's unique personality. Their dialogue also includes references to places, characters, and events that are present in the game, along with mentions of themes that might relate to the music they play on their respective stations. For the first time in the series, all of the radio hosts are named, which further emphasizes their characterisation.\nEach gang in &lt;a href=\"Anywhere%20City\"&gt;Anywhere City&lt;/a&gt; has their own radio station that broadcasts from within their respective territory. The \nhosts of each gang's station oftentimes have personalities that are reflective of their associated gang. \nIf the player is too far from a specific gang's territory, their associated station will have poor reception, which can sometimes be used as a navigation tool by the player. \nOut of the total eleven radio stations in the game, only five are broadcasted throughout each district of Anywhere City. As a result, this means that some stations are only available if the player is a specific district (a mechanic that wouldn't return until ). A station's availability can sometimes relate to whether or not an associated gang resides within the district. \nThe radio stations in feature thirty unique songs in total, five of which are licensed. Unlike other games in the franchise, fifteen of these songs can be heard on more than one radio station, which brings the total number of times that a song is featured to fourty-five.\nChanging radio stations for preference is possible in the &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; version by using the \"F1\" function key, and in the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation\"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt; version by pressing the \"up\" directional button.\nThe radio stations that the player can listen in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;GTA 2&lt;/a&gt;\" are as follows:\nRadio Stations.\nFurther Notes.\nDue to an incorrect user-made track-listing of unknown origin, three instrumental songs are commonly misidentified:\nHead Radio.\n&lt;a href=\"Head%20Radio%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Head Radio&lt;/a&gt; has 2 alternating DJs: &lt;a href=\"Phanny%20Joe%20Styles\"&gt;Phanny Joe Styles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Riccaro\"&gt;Johnny Riccaro&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on which DJ is on charge, the station changes its format: with Phanny Joe Styles it plays pop, dance, and funk, while with Johnny Riccaro it plays primarily rock and some jazz inspired instrumentation. It is the city's largest commercial radio station and can be received in all areas of the game. It is also the station with the longest runtime: 24 minutes as opposed to the regular 12 minutes. The frequency of this station ranges from 69 to 89 FM, according to a station ID.\nSongs with &lt;a href=\"Phanny%20Joe%20Styles\"&gt;Phanny Joe Styles&lt;/a&gt;:\nThe song \"Real Love\" was censored in the PlayStation version of the game - some words were reversed and/or muted.\nSongs with &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Riccaro\"&gt;Johnny Riccaro&lt;/a&gt;:\nThe song \"Taxi Drivers\" was censored in the PlayStation version of the game - some lyrics were interrupted by the sounds of horns.\nRockstar Radio.\n&lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Radio\"&gt;Rockstar Radio&lt;/a&gt; is hosted by &lt;a href=\"Sammy%20Starock\"&gt;Sammy Starock&lt;/a&gt; and plays primarily rock and takes callers on-air.

Using double entendres, tongue-in-cheek remarks, adult humor and marketing techniques used in real life commercials, these commercials for fictional products are heard in-between songs.\nSome products advertised are \"Flipper Dolphin\" (a fishing product used to fish dolphins, encouraging the users to throw away unwanted catches like little tunas), \"Super Lead Gasoline\" (a rocket fuel that isn't safe for the environment but tastes delicious) and \"Credex Gold\" (a credit card for when you run in debts while betting, and \"the premier choice of lounge lizards and game developers all around the world\")."}

Like \"GTA 2\", radio stations can only be heard while in a vehicle.

This &lt;a href=\"custom%20radio%20station\"&gt;custom radio station&lt;/a&gt; is named \"MP3 Player\" in the PC port, and \"CD Changer\" in the Xbox port.\n\"MP3 Player\" only supports .mp3 and .wav music formats. Tracks are played in alphabetical order according to their file names and cannot be skipped. Inserting custom music into \"MP3 Player\" consists simply of placing music files into the \"mp3\" folder located within the primary game folder (i.e. codice_1). For the Xbox version, a CD must be installed into the console's hard drive.\nOther Songs.\nThe following list of songs was either not included on the in-game radio or they can be heard briefly as snippets or as background music:\nAdditionally, there are a number of places, such as &lt;a href=\"Red%20Light%20District\"&gt;Red Light District&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Hepburn%20Heights\"&gt;Hepburn Heights&lt;/a&gt;, that play short snippets of uncredited music. It is currently unknown whether the songs used were made in-house or were taken from the stock music library.\nCommercials.\n&lt;a href=\"Commercials%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;Commercials in GTA III&lt;/a&gt; are included in-between songs in the radios, a kind of feature that was successful in the previous game and was repeated for \"GTA III\". The commercials are one of the hallmarks of the radios and advertize fictional products using adult humor, zany banters and recognizable marketing clich\u00e9s and tropes used in real life commercials.\nThey are all written by &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Houser\"&gt;Dan Houser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones\"&gt;Lazlow&lt;/a&gt; (the latter of whom also produced them). Several adverts mention telephone numbers and official websites. Rockstar actually created these websites, and though many links just eventually lead back to the Rockstar site, some are really quite detailed. The &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.petsovernight.com\"&gt;Petsovernight.com&lt;/a&gt; website displays pictures of animals and promises \"If it's got a central nervous system, we've got it ready to go in a box to your house\", tying in with the humour in the commercials.\nSome examples of commercials in \"GTA III\" are: \"Sue Your Boss\" (a scheme to gain money through lawsuits and faking injuries), \"Fernando's New Beginnings\" (&lt;a href=\"Fernando%20Martinez\"&gt;Fernando Martinez&lt;/a&gt;'s method of saving stale marriages... through letting the husband use the services of a \"&lt;a href=\"prostitute\"&gt;mistress&lt;/a&gt;\" that satisfies his sexual needs) and \"Liberty City Survivor\" (an extremely violent reality show, \"we will take 20 recently paroled guys, equip them with grenade launchers and flamethrowers, and let them hunt each other down\").\nNon-Selectable Radio Stations.\nThere are several stations that can be seen advertised on billboards throughout Liberty City. However, these cannot be listened to by the player. They are &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20FM\"&gt;Liberty FM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"WLLC%20The%20Zone%2034.9%20FM\"&gt;WLLC The Zone 34.9 FM&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Soul%20FM\"&gt;Liberty Soul FM&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown whether these stations were due to appear before being dropped &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;during development&lt;/a&gt; or if they were simply designed to sit alongside other fake brands advertised in the game.\nAnother possible non-selectable station is what has been referred to as Orbit FM. However, close inspection of the ad (both in the game and in the instruction manual) shows that the correct name is &lt;a href=\"Orbit\"&gt;OR-Bit&lt;/a&gt;. There is no \u2018FM\u2019 and no evidence that it is a radio station."}

In \"GTA IV\", most radio stations are dynamic but some still consist of a single audio file.\nIn \"GTA IV\", the radio is dynamic; DJs and news programs inform Niko of the current weather and time of day. &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; updates itself as the storyline progresses, sometimes reporting news about Niko's actions.\nExiting a vehicle does not automatically switch the engine off, and the radio will still play while the engine is left idle. To fully switch the engine off, the player must hold the enter/exit button when exiting the vehicle. When getting phone calls, it will interfere with the radio signal, much like in real life.\nIn , the first episodic downloadable content for \"GTA IV\", five of these radio stations were expanded, namely WKTT Talk Radio, The Beat 102.7, Liberty City Hardcore, Liberty Rock Radio and Radio Broker. The new music has been added to the song rotations of the stations, so that both the original music and the new tracks play concurrently. The new tracks are also included in the original \"GTA IV\" game.\nThe second DLC, , similarly updated five different stations: Vladivostok FM, K109 The Studio, Electro-Choc, San Juan Sounds, and Integrity 2.0. With both DLC packs installed, the player hears the combined radio content in all single-player and multiplayer modes.\nThe two episodes are available in a stand-alone format, \"Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City\". The radio content included with \"The Lost and Damned\" and \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" is combined with additional, exclusive music appearing on three new radio stations: RamJam FM, Self-Actualization FM, and Vice City FM. These replace several radio stations that did not carry over from \"GTA IV\". However, if the player downloaded the episodes, the radio stations from \"GTA IV\" will still be available, as the three exclusive radio stations from \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" episode are only automatically included if the player bought the special disc from the episodes. \nIn April 2018, 10 years after \"GTA IV\"s release, some songs were removed due to expired licenses, while Vladivostok FM received a new soundtrack due to all but one of the original songs being removed.\nFrom June 3, 2020 in the PC version of \"\" (two months after this version was released and combined \"IV\" and \"EFLC\" as one game) the three exclusive stations coexist with all existing \"IV\" stations. \nStations.\nThere are a combined total of 23 radio stations in \"GTA IV\" and \"EFLC\", with nine stations exclusive to \"GTA IV\" (marked with ) and one custom station modified by the player. \nNote: Italicized songs with * indicate songs removed in April 2018.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Beat%20102.7\"&gt;The Beat 102.7&lt;/a&gt;.\nHosted and remixed by &lt;a href=\"DJ%20Green%20Lantern\"&gt;DJ Green Lantern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"DJ%20Mister%20Cee\"&gt;DJ Mister Cee&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA IV\" and then &lt;a href=\"Funkmaster%20Flex\"&gt;Funkmaster Flex&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Statik%20Selektah\"&gt;Statik Selektah&lt;/a&gt; in \"EFLC\", the station plays Contemporary Hip-Hop and R&amp;B.

The station plays Eastern European music of all genres.\nIn \"GTA IV\":\nRuslana's playlist:\nAdded to \"GTA IV\" after April 2018:\nIn \"TBoGT\" and \"EFLC\":\nHavin' It With DJ Paul:\n&lt;a href=\"WKTT%20Radio\"&gt;WKTT Radio&lt;/a&gt;.\nConservative-leaning talk radio that plays the following programs:\nOther Songs.\nThe following is a list of songs that are found in the game, but cannot be heard fully on any in-game radio stations, as credited in the game manual. Instead, other than the song played during the title sequence, they can be heard exclusively while walking through the interiors of different buildings in the game. One song being heard in a cutscene for the mission, Buyer's Market from \"TLaD\", is dancing Elizabeta Torres. Some of the songs were cut from the radio stations for unknown reasons. In \"EFLC\", the strip club songs are replaced by tracks from Vice City FM. And there are five songs that can be only heard in stingers of radio stations.\nMost of the ringtones found on the game's ringtone download website are from previous \"Grand Theft Auto\" games, mainly from &lt;a href=\"Head%20Radio%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Head Radio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lips%20106\"&gt;Lips 106&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and ', and \"Pager\" is the tone of the pager in \"Grand Theft Auto III\" (which is, in turn, the melody of the theme for the original \"Grand Theft Auto\", which also appeared on radio station Lips 106 in \"Grand Theft Auto III\") and the opening tune on ' when it displays the Rockstar North logo, in the form of a Commodore 64 loading screen. All of these songs are from fictional bands made by Rockstar Games.\nSoundtrack Releases.\nRockstar Games has released five soundtrack albums to date. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Music%20of%20Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;The Music of Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" contains several soundtrack selections from the game. Vladivostok FM features tracks from the in-game radio station featuring three (or four, depending on the release) cut songs. &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Invasion\"&gt;\"Liberty City Invasion\"&lt;/a&gt; features original music produced for the game by DJ Green Lantern, half of them appears on The Beat in the game, but the others were cut. There is also an exclusive DJ intro from DJ Green Lantern (like the way in Vice City's \"Official Soundtrack Box Set).\"\nSimilarly, &lt;a href=\"Statik%20Selektah%27s%20The%20Lost%20And%20Damned%20EP\"&gt;Statik Selektah's \"The Lost and Damned EP\"&lt;/a&gt; features original music produced by Statik Selektah that features in the downloadable episode without any cut tracks. The original themes for all three games are available in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV%20-%20The%20Theme%20Song%20Collection\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV \u2014 The Theme Song Collection&lt;/a&gt;\". A soundtrack album for the first expansion, \"The Music of Grand Theft Auto: The Lost and Damned\" was announced with artwork and Drive By Audio \u2013 \"&lt;a href=\"Jailbait\"&gt;Jailbait&lt;/a&gt;\" was released on the iTunes Store as a single from the album. However, a full track listing was not announced, the album was not released, and the announcement was subsequently removed.\nHere is a list of songs that are not in the game's radio stations, but were released on the soundtrack albums:\nVladivostok FM:\nLiberty City Invasion by DJ Green Lantern (The Beat 102.7):\nThe album and all the songs are released in 2009, but 7 of the 8 songs were meant to be in the original game, so they are made in 2008. Heltah Skeltah's \"Can't Trust 'Em\" was meant to be in The Lost and Damned, so this is the only real 2009 song here.\nThe Lost And Damned EP (Special Edition) (The Beat 102.7):\nCommercials.\nSeveral advertisements can be heard on the radio. These include:\nVehicle Default Groups.\nIn \"GTA IV\" and \"Episodes From Liberty City\", radio stations were split into small groups to become default radio stations for the vehicles. These groups are listed below:\nGallery.\nSeveral stations feature on billboards throughout the city.\nOthers feature on posters in &lt;a href=\"East%20Holland\"&gt;East Holland&lt;/a&gt;, with more added around &lt;a href=\"Star%20Junction\"&gt;Star Junction&lt;/a&gt; exclusively in \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\"."}

Because \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" is set in the same location as \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", only three years earlier, some of the radio stations featured are seen as earlier incarnations of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III%20soundtrack\"&gt;radio stations in GTA III&lt;/a&gt;, while other listed stations and radio shows have ceased broadcasting by \"GTA III\"'s timeline. Unlike ' and \"\", and in a similar manner to \"GTA III\", most songs were either original creations for the game by Rockstar or are in the public domain.\nAlso unlike \"GTA San Andreas\", the radio stations featured in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" are not dynamic, consisting once again of a single, looped audio file with the music, commercials, DJ commentary etc. repeated in the same order. The only exceptions are the \"&lt;a href=\"LCN\"&gt;Liberty News&lt;/a&gt;\" bulletins which play once, and once only, following major events in the game.\nNonetheless, the \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" radio system maintains elements of continuity with both \"GTA III\" and \"GTA San Andreas\", with some DJs and callers reappearing from earlier games. For example, &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Burns\"&gt;Richard Burns&lt;/a&gt;, the journalist for &lt;a href=\"WCTR\"&gt;WCTR&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA San Andreas\", phones into &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Free%20Radio\"&gt;LCFR&lt;/a&gt;. Another change is that some radio stations have a different DJ, which is noticeable in &lt;a href=\"Lips%20106\"&gt;Lips 106&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Andee\"&gt;Andee&lt;/a&gt; being the co-host to the older &lt;a href=\"Cliff%20Lane\"&gt;Cliff Lane&lt;/a&gt;.

Here, once more &lt;a href=\"Rockstar\"&gt;Rockstar&lt;/a&gt; puts radio stations that the player can listen when driving a vehicle, in addition to a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Scanner\"&gt;police radio station&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is worth noting that the subsequent expansion, \"\" uses this same soundtrack even though all the songs were released after 1961.\nIn order to capture the essence of &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; in the late 1960s, and give the feeling of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; crime scene from the period, &lt;a href=\"Rockstar\"&gt;Rockstar&lt;/a&gt; decided to license music from the era. This would be the first use of licensed songs in the game series, a feature that would become recurrent in subsequent games. The soundtrack uses a combination of early reggae and &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; pop, beat, soul and jazz from film scores of the period. In addition to these licensed tracks, Rockstar again created some original songs, these also fit in the era depicted. \nRunning time for all the stations in \"\" is very short, as the stations play only one or two songs (with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20Wireless\"&gt;Westminster Wireless&lt;/a&gt;, which plays three). In fact all 12 stations rank among the shortest stations in the series.\nThe radio stations that the player can listen in \"GTA London\" are as follows:\nRadio Stations.\nBush Sounds.\n&lt;a href=\"Bush%20Sounds\"&gt;Bush Sounds&lt;/a&gt; plays reggae by . \"Dollar in the Teeth\" was released as part of the of \"Return of Django\", reflecting its presence alongside \"Return of Django\" in the station.\nHeavy Heavy Monster Sound.\n&lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Heavy%20Monster%20Sound\"&gt;Heavy Heavy Monster Sound&lt;/a&gt; plays reggae and ska. Unlike Bush Sounds, it features two varied bands as opposed to centering around one. The bands are seminal skinhead acts. Its DJ states that the station broadcasts on 666, on the medium wave. \nBlow Upradio.\n&lt;a href=\"Blow%20Upradio\"&gt;Blow Upradio&lt;/a&gt; plays beat. This station is notable because, at a running time of only 1 minute and 55 seconds, it is the shortest radio station in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series. \"Beat Fuga Shake\" is taken from the soundtrack for the 1967 Italian film \"\" (also known as \"Tiffany Memorandum\").\nKaleidoscope.\n&lt;a href=\"Kaleidoscope\"&gt;Kaleidoscope&lt;/a&gt; plays pop and beat. The tracks are taken from the 1967 Italian film \"\" (also known as \"Your Turn to Die\").\nSound of Soho.\n&lt;a href=\"Sound%20of%20Soho\"&gt;Sound of Soho&lt;/a&gt; plays jazz. \"Tema di Londra M. 1\" is taken from the soundtrack for the 1967 Italian film \"\" (also known as \"Master Stroke\"), while \"Latin Quarter\" is taken from the soundtrack of the 1969 Italian film \"\" (also known as \"One on Top of the Other\").\nRadio Penelope.\n&lt;a href=\"Radio%20Penelope\"&gt;Radio Penelope&lt;/a&gt; is hosted by &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Peter%20Pants-On\"&gt;Doctor Peter Pants-On&lt;/a&gt;, the only named DJ in \"GTA London\". The station plays pop and soul. \"The Roaring Twenties\" is taken from the soundtrack of \"Una sull'altra\", while \"Teresa L'Illusa\" is taken from the soundtrack of the 1973 Italian film \"\" (also known as \"Teresa the Thief\").\nRadio Andorra.\n&lt;a href=\"Radio%20Andorra\"&gt;Radio Andorra&lt;/a&gt; plays pop and beat.

In comparison to \"GTA V\", radio stations are not synced between sessions, lack &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; reports (due to those being attributed to the story line of \"GTA V\") and time of day idents . While players in different vehicles or locations may hear different songs to one another at any given time, a player entering the vehicle of another player should hear the same station as them, sometimes resulting in players hearing the same song twice in a row.\nLike the weapon system, switching between radio stations is done by bringing up a &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Station%20Wheel\"&gt;radio station wheel&lt;/a&gt; while in a vehicle to jump to any station, or turn off the radio. This is in contrast to previous \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" titles which required cycling through stations in sequential order, although this ability is still present. In the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PlayStation 4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%205\"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; versions of the game, the player can also utilise the touch pad to change stations by swiping up or down.\nIn the update, a new \"Favorite Radio Stations\" option was added to the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt;. This allows players to favorite radio stations which then only populate the radio wheel. This will not, however, prevent excluded stations from playing in &lt;a href=\"Properties%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;property&lt;/a&gt; radios.\nRadio interference is heard when listening to a specific station and trying to leave the zone where that signal is available. &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County%20Radio\"&gt;Blaine County Radio&lt;/a&gt; can only be selected in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20Talk%20Radio\"&gt;WCTR&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County\"&gt;Los Santos County&lt;/a&gt; and until &lt;a href=\"Holiday%20Bonuses%202020\"&gt;December 22, 2020&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Still%20Slipping%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Still Slipping Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; could only be heard in &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Park\"&gt;Mirror Park&lt;/a&gt;. If the player leaves the county while listening to the respective station they will lose the signal and the radio will automatically switch to the next station on the radio wheel. Sometimes, if the player passes under any large structure in the game, such as a tunnel or a bridge, can be heard. Radio stations are not available on the island of &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico\"&gt;Cayo Perico&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Rebel%20Radio%20Building\"&gt;Rebel Radio Building&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Senora%20Desert\"&gt;Grand Senora Desert&lt;/a&gt; next to a broadcast tower and has external speakers playing music from the station. However, it does not match what is playing on that station at the time.\nStations.\nThere are 25 in-game radio stations, with 24 active stations in each county and 1 custom station modified by the player.

There are 7 radio stations that were added to \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" since update release.

In addition to contemporary 1990s music, it also includes music from the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. For the first time in the , all the songs are licensed, in complete contrast to the &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations%20in%20GTA\"&gt;stations&lt;/a&gt; of the original game.\nAlthough most vehicles in the game are fitted with radios, some, such as emergency vehicles, play a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Scanner\"&gt;police radio track&lt;/a&gt; instead, and others, such as bicycles and tractors, are not equipped with radios.\nIn previous games, radio stations consisted of a single, looped audio file which repeated songs, DJ commentary and commercials in the same order. In \"GTA San Andreas\", the game itself randomizes the playlist, DJ commentary during and between songs, and other aspects such as weather reports. Some stations, most notably &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20Talk%20Radio\"&gt;West Coast Talk Radio&lt;/a&gt;, changes its programming as the game progresses, sometimes reflecting events within the game or subplots occurring within the radio programming. Even the police radio track changes towards the latter part of the game, when the riots occur.\nAn extensive 8-CD ' was released containing music from the game's radio stations, while a smaller 2-CD ' was also released.\nOn October 26, 2014, \"GTA San Andreas\" was re-released as a download for the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate the game's 10th anniversary. However, over the years, the licenses for some of the songs had expired, and thus some of the songs were excluded from future re-releases as a PS2 Classic on &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PlayStation 4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%205\"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20Series%20X%20and%20Series%20S\"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, as well as \"\". &lt;a href=\"K-Rose\"&gt;K-Rose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"SF-UR\"&gt;SF-UR&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"CSR%20103.9\"&gt;CSR 103.9&lt;/a&gt; are the only stations to retain their original playlists.\nThere are twelve in-game radio stations, with one custom station modified by the player.

This &lt;a href=\"custom%20radio%20station\"&gt;custom radio station&lt;/a&gt; is named \"User Track Player\" in the PC and Xbox ports, and \"Mixtape\" in the iOS port.\n\"User Track Player\" only supports .ogg and .mp3 music formats (as well as shortcuts to those types of files). Contrary to previous custom stations in the series, \"User Track Player\" offers various options of playing the music files: in sequential order, on random, or within a rudimentary radio station that only plays commercials between music tracks. Players are also allowed to immediately skip to the next track if the station is not set as a radio station. Inserting custom music into \"User Track Player\" consists of placing music files in a \"User Tracks\" folder, located in its GTA \"User Files\" folders within My Documents. To ensure recently inserted tracks are sure to be played, \"GTA San Andreas\" requires the players \"scan\" the music folder using the audio options for new music tracks.\n\"Mixtape\" requires the player to create an iTunes playlist on their iOS device named \"GTASA\" and add songs to that playlist. After that has been done, they must start up the game, be in any normal vehicle, and keep changing the radio station until they reach \"Tape Deck\", which is between WCTR and \"Radio Off\".\nOther Songs.\nThe following song was not included in the game, but is featured as a bonus track in the \" :\nCommercials.\n&lt;a href=\"Commercials%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;Commercials in GTA San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; are a gigantic expansion from the previous game, the huge number of fictional products that are advertised in San Andreas dwarfs anything that &lt;a href=\"Rockstar\"&gt;Rockstar&lt;/a&gt; had made until that point. Running time for San Andreas commercials is just a couple of minutes shorter than that of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\". Due to the new randomizing mechanics of the stations in \"San Andreas\", commercials could feature on any radio station and in any order. As \"San Andreas\" is set in an earlier era, the commercials follow the model set by the commercials in \"\" and depicts the media trends, relevant topics and general atmosphere of the early 1990s.\nSome examples of commercials in \"GTA San Andreas\" are: \"Grin\" (a pill to help cure anxiety, depression, and the lack of confidence that comes with raising a family at the suburbs; consuming it is completely safe, \"after all, what could be habit forming about a pill that makes you feel better all of the time?\"), \"Starfish Resort and Casino\" (referencing humorously the 1990s obsession with \"family friendly\" casinos, this is a casino where kids can bet, gain money by making lap dances and selling their organs, \"this kind of fun should be illegal!\") and \"Dreammakers\" (referencing the arrival in the 1990s of many immigrants from ex-communist countries, it offers a start of a career in &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt;; women that \"are only attractive but can hardly read or act will have to sleep their way to the top\", and men that \"are fat, boring, and have no ideas of their own [are] perfect, why not be movie producers!\")\nNon-Selectable Radio Stations.\n&lt;a href=\"Dopealicious%20FM\"&gt;Dopealicious FM&lt;/a&gt; is advertised on billboards throughout the state. However, it is not available for selection at any time during the game and has no songs or DJs associated with it. It is unknown whether the station was originally intended to be a real station but dropped during the &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;development of the game&lt;/a&gt;, or if was simply designed to sit alongside other fake brands advertised in the game.\nAnother possible non-selectable station is &lt;a href=\"Hi%20K69%20Radio%20Station\"&gt;Hi K69&lt;/a&gt;, which is a radio transmitter building located in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Carson\"&gt;Fort Carson&lt;/a&gt;.\nCut Radio Stations.\nUnnamed Early Rave Station.\nIn the PS2 files, there is a list of radio station genres, with \"Country\" being listed as \"Early Rave\", indicating that originally, there was a Rave station present in the game. Furthermore, the following song was requested and approved to be in the game; however, due to the station being scrapped, it went unused:\nFlash FM.\nIn an October 2004 issue of magazine, a preview for \"San Andreas\" disclosed that &lt;a href=\"Flash%20FM\"&gt;Flash FM&lt;/a&gt; was considered for the game at some point. It is also possible that the \"GTA Vice City\" rendition was used as a placeholder before the radio line-up was finalized.\nHit Radio.\nIn the same October 2004 PSM2 preview, an unknown station was known only as \"Hit Radio\". It's unknown what genre it would play; however, judging by the name and the rest of the list, it might have been an early moniker for &lt;a href=\"CSR%20103.9\"&gt;CSR 103.9&lt;/a&gt;."}

In the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PlayStation 4&lt;/a&gt; version, the player can utilise the touch pad to change stations by swiping up or down. When using the radio station wheel in \"GTA V\", or in &lt;a href=\"Director%20Mode\"&gt;Director Mode&lt;/a&gt;, the game will revert to slow motion while changing stations. \nRadio interference is heard when listening to a specific station and trying to leave the zone where that signal is available. &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County%20Radio\"&gt;Blaine County Radio&lt;/a&gt; can only be selected in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20Talk%20Radio\"&gt;WCTR&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County\"&gt;Los Santos County&lt;/a&gt;. If the player leaves the county while listening to the respective station they will lose the signal and the radio will automatically switch to the next station on the radio wheel.

Many of the songs appear on cutscenes, and some songs are programmed to be played at certain parts of a mission; for example, 's \"\" starts to play when the player enters their first vehicle at the start of the game. Emergency vehicles are equipped with a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Scanner\"&gt;police radio&lt;/a&gt; specially recorded for the game, which was a departure from previous games in the series.\nThe arrangement of the soundtrack of \"GTA Vice City\" was a big move on the part of &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt;: unlike previous games in the series, which relied to a great extent on original creations, \"GTA Vice City\" has an overwhelming majority of licensed content, with just five original songs.\nMost radio stations play a mixture of music, DJ chat, and spoof advertising. The stations each reflect one style of music intended to evoke the atmosphere of the time. The bulk of the soundtrack consists of contemporary 1980s music, but also includes music from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.\nSeveral of the stations also reappear in , which is a direct prequel to the game.\nAn extensive 7-CD ' was released containing music from the game's radio stations, while a shorter ' compilation CD was also released.\nOn December 6, 2012, \"GTA Vice City\" was released on &lt;a href=\"Apple%20iOS\"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Android%20OS\"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate the game's 10th anniversary. However, over the years, song licenses expired, and therefore some songs were removed from these versions of the game. The same songs are missing from the game re-releases as a PS2 Classic on &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PlayStation 4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%205\"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt;, as well as .

It has only one program, \"&lt;a href=\"Pressing%20Issues\"&gt;Pressing Issues&lt;/a&gt;\", which is hosted by &lt;a href=\"Maurice%20Chavez\"&gt;Maurice Chavez&lt;/a&gt;. The two station supervisors, &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Freeloader\"&gt;Jonathan Freeloader&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Michelle%20Montanius\"&gt;Michelle Montanius&lt;/a&gt;, appeal listeners for money funding during breaks. Each segment focuses on a particular issue, with Chavez chairing a discussion on the issue between several guests with different backgrounds, points of view or approaches.\nThree such issues are broadcast within the game. They are:\nRadio Espantoso.\n&lt;a href=\"Radio%20Espantoso\"&gt;Radio Espantoso&lt;/a&gt; is a Spanish-language radio station hosted by &lt;a href=\"Pepe%20%28DJ%29\"&gt;Pepe&lt;/a&gt; and plays Latin jazz, mambo, son, salsa and Latin funk.\nTranslations for the titles, at the side, in superscript.\nEmotion 98.3.\n&lt;a href=\"Emotion%2098.3\"&gt;Emotion 98.3&lt;/a&gt; is hosted by &lt;a href=\"Fernando%20Martinez\"&gt;Fernando Martinez&lt;/a&gt; and features soft pop, power ballads and soft rock.\nWave 103.\n&lt;a href=\"Wave%20103\"&gt;Wave 103&lt;/a&gt; is hosted by &lt;a href=\"Adam%20First\"&gt;Adam First&lt;/a&gt;, and features new wave, synthpop and post-punk.\nMP3 Player/Tape Deck.\n\"GTA Vice City\" allows players to play their songs in the &lt;a href=\"PC\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xbox\"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt; and iOS ports of the game. This &lt;a href=\"custom%20radio%20station\"&gt;custom radio station&lt;/a&gt; is named \"MP3 Player\" in the PC port, \"Tape\" in the Xbox port, and \"Tape Deck\" in the iOS port.\n\"MP3 Player\" only supports .ogg and .mp3 music formats (as well as shortcuts to those types of files). Tracks are played in alphabetical order according to their file names and cannot be skipped. Inserting custom music into \"MP3 Player\" consists simply of placing music files into the \"mp3\" folder located within the primary game folder (i.e. codice_1). For the Xbox version, a CD must be installed into the console's hard drive. The logo of \"MP3 Player\" is just a \"palette swap\" of the logo of the \"MP3 Player\" custom station from .\n\"Tape\" requires the player to copy the songs from an audio CD to the Xbox in the \"Music\" menu of the original Xbox Dashboard, so that the game can read the songs from the Xbox hard drive. After that, the songs can be played in the game from a common vehicle changing the radio station until they reach \"TAPE\", also, the player can change the music in the game with the D-pad.\n\"Tape Deck\" requires the player to create a music playlist on their iOS device named \"VICECITY\", and add songs to that playlist. After that's been done, they must start up the game, be in any civilian vehicle, and keep changing the radio station until they reach \"Tape Deck\", which is between &lt;a href=\"Wave%20103\"&gt;Wave 103&lt;/a&gt; and \"Radio Off\".\nOther Songs.\nThe version of \"Al-Naafiysh (The Soul)\" by Hashim used in the third \"GTA Vice City\" trailer is the \"A-Side\" version, which isn't the version used in-game.\nA number of other songs can be heard during mission cutscenes. These songs are not featured on any of the game's radio stations.\nAdditionally, the European edition of the &lt;a href=\"Flash%20FM\"&gt;Flash FM&lt;/a&gt; soundtrack CD contains the following songs, which do not actually appear in the game:\nNon-Selectable Radio Station.\nOne radio station, &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20News\"&gt;Vice City News&lt;/a&gt;, was due to appear in the game as a news radio station but was &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;dropped during development&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, the VCN building and &lt;a href=\"VCN%20Maverick\"&gt;Mavericks&lt;/a&gt; still appear in the final version of the game.\nCommercials.\nCommercials in \"GTA Vice City\" were greatly expanded from the commercials of the previous game. The biggest appeal of the commercials in \"Vice City\" is that for the first time in the series &lt;a href=\"Rockstar\"&gt;Rockstar&lt;/a&gt; could produce commercials that dealt with an earlier era, here showcasing the typical vibe and mindset of people and media of the 1980s. Later games in the series that were set in an earlier period would follow this model.\nDue to being the first game made in the that was set in an earlier era, &lt;a href=\"Rockstar\"&gt;Rockstar&lt;/a&gt; had enough technological advances to showcase the music, clothes, atmosphere and thus, the typical commercials of the 1980s. There are references to relevant topics of the period, such as hair products, the , Japanese car companies dominating the American market and early home consoles that could bring the quality of arcade machines to the living room.\nSome products advertised are: \"Ammu-Nation\" (the firearms store that is \"leading the war against communism\" and that has film festivals where they \"screen the documentary \"\"), \"Yuppie and the Alien\" (a \" meets \" police drama that teams up a human cop and an alien \"that could vaporize dissidents in Alpha Centauri but in this precinct [he has to] do it by-the-book\") and the &lt;a href=\"Domestobot\"&gt;Domestobot&lt;/a&gt; (a domestic helper robot for people that tried hiring a nanny but desisted after she wanted health insurance)."}

It is hosted by &lt;a href=\"Sage\"&gt;Sage&lt;/a&gt; (voiced by Jodie Shawback).\nDescription.\nRadio X is full of the 1990s grunge attitude and of the vibe of the time. Its host, Sage, presents herself as an intellectual, nihilist, revolutionist and pessimistic character.\nThe station's tracklist represents many of the contemporary modern/alternative rock sounds that were prominent or emerging in the early 1990s. The most represented genre on the station is undoubtedly grunge, with bands like L7, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Stone Temple Pilots all having songs on the station, as well as the grunge energy given off by both the station idents and Sage. Also exhibited on the station are major heavy metal and hard rock acts from the late 1980s and early 1990s, like Guns 'n' Roses, Danzig, and Ozzy Osbourne (unavailable on rerelease versions). The alternative metal scene is also on display, from acts such as Helmet, Living Colour, Alice in Chains, Faith No More, and Rage Against The Machine (not on rerelease versions). Interestingly, this alternative metal group mainly features acts that would serve influential to nu metal later in the 1990s, a genre that has yet to appear on GTA radios. The station also features softer, more dance-oriented songs by acts like Depeche Mode, Primal Scream, and The Stone Roses, representing the sounds of early 1990s UK alternative scenes such as synth-rock, Madchester, and neo-psychedelia. There is also a funk rock undertone to some acts, namely Jane's Addiction, The Stone Roses, Primal Scream, and Faith No More.\nThrough its idents it boasts that \"finally there is an alternative to commercial rock, these guys don't care about money\". Sage backs up this statement by claiming \"I don't think any of these guys are signed to a major record label\", a false statement on both parts as most, if not all of Radio X's artists were on major labels by &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;. It also says that it is \"the birth of modern rock and fundamental social upheaval\" and that \"the end of civilization is here\". It attacks the older generation, the , and its music, saying \"anyone who doesn't think this is the best music recorded in history, should just jump off a bridge and die\".\nIt also humorously pokes fun of the self-centered attitude of its listeners, with idents that say \"we are self-important nihilists\", \"who cares about poverty, we got egos to worry about\", \"we're the end of the alphabet people, that's got to mean something, but we don't know what\", and \" and now the X\".\nIt also calls its listeners \"apathetic, despondent, trust-fund babies\" and tells them pessimistic comments like \"nothing that you'll ever do will ever mean anything, we're the only identity you've got\" and \"feel like you mean something\".\nThe station's host, Sage, is a young woman and proud member of Generation X. She is an escaped mental patient who is very opinionated and constantly speaks her views in-between songs. She gets lost frequently in her random musings, displaying extremely pessimistic and narcissistic views. She constantly wants to have sex and hates the older generations so much that she wants to kill anyone over the age of 30.

The side profile also takes a major influence from the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe frontal area features a bulky bumper that houses a meshed vent, which spans about half the car's width and is partially covered by the license plate on the center. The upper area is dominated mostly by the three chrome grilles with the central-mounted Vapid logo on the middle one, followed by the set of rectangular headlamps beside it. The hood features small elevations, which are slightly more prominent as they approach the windshield.\nThe sides of the car feature triangular air intakes at the top of the front wheel wells, which have a silver/chrome finish on the surroundings and the two horizontal separations. The wheel wells and skirting area bulge outwards, which seemingly merge with the bumpers on both ends, together with small extensions on the rear that act as the mudguards. The rest of the car's body is plain and has no character lines, although there is an upper body line starting from the top of the front wheel wells and slightly angles upwards towards the rear end, as well as black horizontal door handles. The same cabin is rather tall and makes use of black trim around each window glass, with body-colored mirror wings mounted near the A-pillars. The roof is relatively flat in appearance and features a spoiler above the rear window.\nThe rear end of the car is mostly occupied by the rear compartment door, which features smooth lines between the inner corners of the tail lights, with the upper one curved upwards. The middle section of the same compartment door holds the Vapid logo on the center below the upper line and silver lettering above the lower line, which displays the car's name on the driver side and the engine specifications on the passenger side, while the bottom area of the compartment door curves inwards and sits above the bumper. The edges of the car house large tail light units, each one consisting of an upper brake light and lower reverse/turning lights, all of them enclosed by C-shaped red main lights. The bumper is relatively bulky compared to the rest of the car's rear end, having a dedicated central section for the license plate and two mouldings for the exhaust pipes. In the enhanced version, the vehicle shares the interior with the &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle spawns in a variety of single-tone and two-tone paint jobs, where the primary color is applied on the bodywork and the secondary color on the lower sides, cabin pillars, mirror wings and roof. It uses a set of seven-spoke rims also shared with the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet\"&gt;Gauntlet&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in medium-profile tires.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nBeing a compact SUV, the Radius is a good example of a , being underwhelming on the exterior but having really good performance on the road. Its active AWD characteristics give it excellent acceleration, though oversteer is still present and can pose a problem in races. The Radius sits very low to the ground and has a decently stiff suspension, giving it sporty handling for an SUV. With a few tuning parts, it can compete with sportier cars like the &lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blista\"&gt;Blista&lt;/a&gt;. However, its durability is not the best, as its not designed to withstand heavy collisions with its bodywork susceptible to deformation, and will start to suffer performance-wise if collided with heavier vehicles or walls too often.\nThe Radius is stated to use a 220ci (3.6L) V6 engine, yet the in-game model is a V8 engine, which is coupled with a 6-speed gearbox and powers all four wheels with a torque distribution of 60% to the front wheels and 40% to the rear. The crossover's engine has a grunty and unique sound with plenty of torque, being similar to a typical cross-plane engine with the roar it produces. A notable drawback to its performance is its transmission, which will only shift at very high RPM. Only a slight slope on a road is necessary to make it hang and refuse to shift."}

{"id": "27218", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=27218", "title": "Ragdoll Physics", "text": " is a feature first implemented in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\". With ragdoll physics, players and NPCs lie on the ground dynamically. The affected model essentially behaves like a \"ragdoll\", hence the name. Characters no longer lie flat and static on surfaces. Their bodies will conform to any objects realistically and can be moved around by collisions and bullets. However, unlike other games that use ragdoll physics, characters in \"GTA\" games do not seem to be affected to the fullest extent and still conform to some preset animations, thus assuming a more \"human\" posture and not like a dummy being thrown around (eg. when jumping off a tall building, the subject would land straight then topple over, rather than landing on one foot and immediately falling to the ground).\nWhen the ragdoll effects on NPC or protagonist is activated by having them hit by a car, falling, etc., they will not just flap around like a \"lifeless\" ragdoll if they are still alive; they will brace themselves while getting thrown about. When a protagonist or NPC gets hit by with a car (but doesn't die from the impact), they will brace themselves as they are getting thrown about the road. Up until they are killed, they will continue to brace their face with their arms and their legs in the fetal position. If a protagonist or NPC is killed by getting hit by a car, their body will be thrown about lifelessly without bracing. This is added for realism as real life people will automatically brace themselves whenever they are thrown. Ragdoll physics are a bit inconvenient at certain times, especially when bailing out of a vehicle or ejecting involuntarily out of a vehicle, unlike the previous renditions, as the player may continue to flop around until death. This feature adds realism and a sense of more control in the game.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", the ragdoll physics have been reduced in bouncing and duration of the flips and impacts, but leave much more damage to the protagonist. When they bail out a car, they will try to brace themselves, but instead of flipping or bouncing, they will slide on the road until they stop, when they are stopped, before getting up, they will stay on the ground as they were taking a break or been in pain. When falling from a mountain, the smallest touch can be fatal to the player, they will keep rolling until they land on a flat surface or a rock, also when falling from a building, aircraft, or any other high area, they will instantly roll in the air screaming. During the freefall time, they will be facing the sky (most times) moving their arms and legs without stopping. This is much more realistic, as if a person falls from a great height, they would move their arms and legs in random ways. However, when a NPC or protagonist is dead, the ragdoll still flips and slides on the ground, unlike in \"GTA IV\", where after landing they would only slide for around a meter.\nPhysics in older games.\nAs ragdoll physics were added in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", in previous games if a player or NPC falls off a building or hill they would fall completely flat even if the ground below is steep. Also if a player or NPC falls on the ground he will land with both feet on the ground and then fall flat. Even if the player or NPC dies from the impact of the fall they will still hit the ground the same way. In \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", if the player falls from a low height Niko will do a stunt roll, but in previous games the player will fall flat on their feet, able to keep moving, with a slight bend forward (this is very hard to notice, but still there) in \"\". If a player or NPC is hit by a car in a game previous to \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", they will fall on their back and then get back up if not killed, or they will fall the same way but slide over the top of the car; in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", Niko or an NPC will fly over the top of the car and can hit the ground in many different ways depending on how high they fall, the speed of the car, and the angle of the collision."}

The bumper has a dedicated section for the license plate, along with a sloped bottom side.\nThe interior of the car is reused from cars like the &lt;a href=\"FMJ\"&gt;FMJ&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tempesta\"&gt;Tempesta&lt;/a&gt;, obviously altered to fit into the sedan layout. However, it uses a dedicated dial set, which retains the speedometer markings from the \"FMJ\" dial set and replaces the tachometer with a \"Kw\" dial. A predominant vertical multimedia display sits in the centre of the dashboard in similar fashion to the real Tesla Model S. Amusingly, the onboard computer features a disc player.\nThe primary color of the car is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary one is applied on the lower portions of the car. The car uses a set of rims identical to the \"Lozspeed Mk.v\" sport rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in low-profile tires.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nFor an electric sports sedan, the Raiden has phenomenal takeoff when accelerating after coming to a full stop. It also has good handling and a great top speed, along with its good turning radius. It can also accelerate fast when reversing. Durability is quite fragile, however, and its body panels fall off rather easily in the event of a rollover, and it is not too great in dealing with collisions and gunfire either. \nBoth the hood and the trunk lack a battery compartment inside, which could indicate that the battery cell is located underneath, much like the real-world Model S. Each axle has two block-shaped components housing the electric motors, explaining the AWD layout (with 35% of the power delivered to the front wheels and the rest to the rear ones). When damaged enough, smoke will emit from both the front and rear of the vehicle. As with other electric vehicles, the car emits a quiet sound, which is clearly heard in quiet areas with the radio off."}

It was made available for purchase in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" during the &lt;a href=\"Gun%20Van%20Week\"&gt;Gun Van Week&lt;/a&gt;, as part of the continuation of the update.\nDescription.\nA railgun is a weapon that fires inert metallic rounds at velocities higher than the speed of sound using an electromagnetic effect. As such, it has incredible range and accuracy in addition to massive kinetic energy. However, at the time the weapon was introduced, railguns are still considered to be prototype phase and due to a myriad of issues, such as power generation and heat dissipation are limited in size and portability to fixed (usually naval) mountings. Portable railguns do not exist outside of theoretical models.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Railgun is a high-tech military prototype weapon designed for infantry use, adopting a carbine-like appearance. It bears a strong resemblance to the featured in the \"Halo\" series.\nThe weapon features a very linear design easily distinguished by two electrically-powered rails on the front, the vented units on either side of the gun just behind the power source, and a small fixed stock on the rear. The Railgun also has a transparent sight on top with a triangle-shaped reticle on it. A green light is visible when the Railgun is loaded and turns red when fired.\nAccording to the text on the side of the weapon, the Railgun is property of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Government.\nWhen equipped, the Railgun emits a low pitch humming sound, which can be more easily heard when in first-person view. When fired, a flash of electric arc can be seen in the barrel, in which it will be followed by a small explosion in the muzzle (a sonic boom) after the rounds are fired. Attempting to fire the weapon without ammunition will produce a unique static sound, as opposed to the standard \"click\" of conventional weapons. In \"GTA Online\", the Railgun has a higher pitched humming sound and lacks the unload charging sound.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe Railgun fires rounds at the speed of 2000 m/s (7200 KPH), which is the same velocity as most weapons. In real life, the rounds travel much faster than regular firearm bullets due to their supersonic velocity. On impact, the kinetic energy rounds are capable of causing massive damage, which are on par with the &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt;. That is, it can destroy any unarmored vehicle in one shot.\nHowever, this weapon requires accurate shooting because of its poor blast radius; any shot that missed deals no damage, especially when one hits a vehicle's window and the projectile can easily pass through both open side doors of a helicopter. Its blast radius is only one meter.\nSince it is a single-shot and it takes multiple seconds to recharge, this weapon is good at dealing with enemy vehicles, but is less effective against groups of enemies on foot. It is also an effective backup weapon to be used in missions that involve heavy shootouts, such as &lt;a href=\"Heists\"&gt;Heists&lt;/a&gt;. When used from low cover, the gun takes less time to recharge, ideal for taking out enemies from areas where they cannot flank the player easily.\nThe gun also has a maximum range of 500 meters, being ideal for long-range application (only surpassed by sniper rifles, which have a maximum range of 1,500 meters). However, its lock-on range is very limited, at only 40 meters (compared to assault rifles, which have a lock-on range of 65 meters).\nBased on the markings of the gun, it has an energy capacity of 1.21 gigawatts. The &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games%20Social%20Club\"&gt;Rockstar Games Social Club&lt;/a&gt; website also indicates the Railgun is a fully-automatic weapon, yet it is a single-shot weapon in-game. Assuming that the weapon is limited by the single-round magazine, it would mechanically have fully-automatic capabilities.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nPreviously only available in select &lt;a href=\"Missions%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt; and gamemodes, the Railgun becomes freely available in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;GTA Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the update, available for purchase at the &lt;a href=\"Gun%20Van\"&gt;Gun Van&lt;/a&gt;. However the weapon\u2019s performance have been reduced. The projectile velocity has been lowered from 2000 m/s (7200 KPH) to 750 m/s (2700 KPH), and inflicts less damage to players and vehicles. The Railgun can kill some players with a single round, but those who are at least Rank 100 will survive with only a sliver of health remaining, and after that they are likely to be wasted from fall damage, unless they are equipped with Super Heavy &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt;, in which case it would take two shots to take them out. It can also destroy unarmored vehicles in one shot, and may be a effective weapon against maneuverable aircraft, although the projectile is slow and only has a range of 500 meters. The weapon cannot lock-on to enemies or vehicles.\nAgainst vehicles, the Railgun does slightly more damage than explosive rounds fired from the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper Mk II&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Shotgun%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Pump Shotgun Mk II&lt;/a&gt; (12.5% more than the aforementioned weapons). It can instantly destroy an unarmored vehicle even if a player is inside (as opposed to two explosive rounds to blow it up). The damage appears to have 45% of the &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt;'s, requiring 20 shots to destroy a heavily armored &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicles\"&gt;Personal Vehicle&lt;/a&gt; (namely the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up%20Custom\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up Custom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nightshark\"&gt;Nightshark&lt;/a&gt;), and nine shots to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino Tank&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the files, the updated model appears to have some of its flags removed, namely the ones that allows the original model to lock on most targets and its ability to be used in a vehicle in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nAdditionally, the Railgun can be found and used in some &lt;a href=\"Adversary%20Modes\"&gt;Adversary Modes&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href=\"Supplies/Steal%20Missions%23Railgun\"&gt;a Bunker Supplies/Steal Mission&lt;/a&gt;, though they cannot be kept afterward unless the player already owns one."}

The barriers will lower when a train is approaching the crossing. However, trains travel very fast and will often pass the crossing before the barriers have fully lowered. In the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20County\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt;, where large sections of the railway line are long and straight, trains will often be travelling at full speed, giving only a split-second warning of when they are about to pass. An impact at this speed may &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; instantly. Because the barriers do not extend for the full length of the road, other drivers will often attempt to pass a closed barrier by driving around it, putting them at risk of being hit by an oncoming train. &lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;Pedestrians&lt;/a&gt; do not stop crossing the tracks, which puts them at risk of being killed by a train as well.\nTrains will not stop if an obstacle is on the tracks, nor does a horn signify that they are approaching. The open crossings in Los Santos must be passed with care as they do not have barriers or lights. At some crossings, because of the location of the traffic lights, a long queue of vehicles can result in some vehicles waiting on the tracks. However, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Wrong%20Side%20of%20the%20Tracks\"&gt;one mission&lt;/a&gt;, vehicles do not normally explode if they are hit by a train.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\".\n Railroad crossings reappear in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" in various parts of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;.

In Los Santos and Blaine County, barriers are present on most crossings, and will close and block the road whenever a train is approaching. In Los Santos, barriers extend for the full length of the road, blocking off all approaching traffic. In Blaine County, however, the barriers do not extend for the full length of the road.\nSimilar railroad crossings can be found in Los Santos, but these do not have barriers and are instead used by the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Transit\"&gt;Los Santos Transit&lt;/a&gt;."}

The sides of the vehicle are seemingly narrower and features additional frames and panels for the rear wheels, while the cabin area is reinforced with various frames on the front and on the roof area. The rear of the car is mostly covered by the rear panels, with additional frames over the engine bay. Its underside is also covered by additional panels, leaving part of the engine exposed.\nThe interior of the car, while similar to the Dune Buggy and the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Docker\"&gt;Space Docker&lt;/a&gt;, features an enclosed front, no longer exposing the steering column. In addition, it uses a set of analog dials and numerous switches on the upper section/dashboard, derived from race cars such as the &lt;a href=\"RE-7B\"&gt;RE-7B&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ETR1\"&gt;ETR1&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe car is only seen with a rather worn appearance, having heavy scratches on the front end. The primary colour is applied on the body panels, while the secondary colour is applied on the bodywork frames and protective cage. The wheels share the same rim design as the Dune Buggy and &lt;a href=\"BF%20Injection\"&gt;Injection&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in high-profile tyres with standard treaded pattern and wider track on the rear ones.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Ramp Buggy's behaviour is different compared to its off-road equivalent, as it has a low ride height to make slipping under cars efficient and appears to withstand collisions better due to the reinforced chassis. However, the car only has average speed and acceleration due to its weight, and its handling appears to be downgraded, difficulting its use on off-road environments.\nPrior to the update, the Ramp Buggy could be damaged by ramming multiple cars, causing its engine to emit smoke from the sides. If the player was still ramming cars after said warning, the engine will stop working, disabling the Ramp Buggy. This issue was shared with the &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Wedge\"&gt;Phantom Wedge&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite having no ballistic weaponry attached to the vehicle, the ramp is considered to be a weapon itself, meaning the use of Passive Mode is not allowed while in the Ramp Buggy. The same applies to the Phantom Wedge.\nThe vehicle features a single-cam Flat-4 engine derived from the Dune Buggy and many BF off-road vehicles, coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a rear engine, rear wheel drive layout. The engine sound is an edited variation of the one used in the Dune Buggy and the Injection, with a lower pitch and a slightly smoother tone."}

Rampages were absent in , but reappeared in and .\nMost rampages task the player with killing a certain number of gang members or civilians in a prescribed way. Typically, one or more weapons will be given to the player for this task, and only these weapons may be used. Sometimes, players are asked to run down their victims or perform the required kills as &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by shootings&lt;/a&gt;; in these scenarios, any kills made outside of a vehicle will not count. Occasionally, the targets may be a certain type of vehicle which must be destroyed, rather than people.\nRampages can be only completed once in , , and , but can be played multiple times in \"GTA San Andreas\" and .

For example, a Kill Frenzy using a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Machine%20Gun\"&gt;Machine Gun&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0will look like a Machine Gun, so unless the player knows which crates are Kill Frenzies and which ones are not, they may end up picking up a Kill Frenzy instead of a weapon.\nIt is not required to use that weapon for killing. Moreover, it is not required to kill either. If the player gets the necessary amount of score, the frenzy is complete. The least risky way to complete a kill frenzy is to launch one on a mission, before doing something that yields a lot of score, e.g. picking up someone or something, entering or delivering a car etc.\nKill frenzies also come in handy on those missions during which the player has to kill many people in a short time.

The console versions of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" contain 5 two-player rampages.\nThe first rampage completed earns the player $500 ($5000 in \"GTA III\") and this reward increases by &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;500 ($5000 in \"GTA III\") for each subsequent completed rampage. Although in \"GTA Advance\" each rampage will reward the player $1000.\nA penalty for failing a rampage in \"GTA Vice City\", \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\" is that any &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level\"&gt;Wanted Level&lt;/a&gt; gained during the rampage remains in force, with &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;Victor&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy&lt;/a&gt; left to their own devices to deal with it. Any enemies attacking the player during the rampage will also continue to be a threat, whether the player has passed the rampage or not.\nIn \"GTA III\", if the player fails a rampage on the first attempt, the pickup icon will move to a second location. If the rampage is failed again at this new location, the icon returns to its original position.\n\"GTA Advance\" seems to be the most unique when it comes to rampage mechanics, as either completing or failing a rampage will always despawn the thugs that were spawned during the rampage, and successfully passing a rampage will always leave the player with a sum of ammo that was used during the rampage.\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;rampages&lt;/a&gt; are sometimes 2-player vehicle-based challenges \u2014 the first player drives, while the second shoots at the targets. Rampages are not required for 100% completion as they are only accessible in a 2-player games, which would render 100% completion impossible for single players.\nIn \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", completing all rampages rewards the player with an &lt;a href=\"M-60\"&gt;M-60&lt;/a&gt;, which spawns at every &lt;a href=\"Safehouses%20in%20GTA%20Liberty%20City%20Stories\"&gt;safehouse&lt;/a&gt;. In the other games, only money is given for completing all rampages, as well as contributing towards 100% completion.\nIn \"GTA Vice City Stories\", once the player passes a rampage for the first time, the white skull on its icon changes to blue, allowing the player to tell which have been previously completed. There is also a special option on the map which marks all completed rampages.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\", there are 30 rampages, which involve killing gang members with a given weapon. Unlike previous games, the player is given henchmen to help kill enemies in some of the rampages, otherwise the rampage is done alone. Score multipliers are given for consecutive kills. Instead of there being a number of people the player has to kill, the rampages work on a points score basis. Destroying gang vehicles also gains points, though fewer than killing gang members. Upon completion, players will be awarded with a bronze, silver or gold medal, depending on their score. All rampages must be completed with at least a bronze medal to obtain 100% completion. Once a rampage is passed, the rampage will still be shown at same location, but instead of a white skull icon, the skull will be outlined in bronze, silver or gold (depending on the player's previous high scores). On top of the 30 rampages, there are also five &lt;a href=\"Riding%20Shotgun\"&gt;Riding Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; missions, which fall under the same in-game category.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nRampages return in \"GTA V\", but are only accessible to &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; and take the form of &lt;a href=\"Strangers%20and%20Freaks\"&gt;Strangers and Freaks&lt;/a&gt;-like side missions.\nUpon approaching the rampage icon, Trevor will engage the people nearby in conversation, an act that inevitably leads to a confrontation and Trevor flying into a rage and massacring them.\nThere are five rampages in total, spread out across the map, and they must be completed in order to unlock the next.\nDuring his rampages, Trevor gains a super-charged version of his special ability, in the form of greatly increased damage resistance and infinite ammo for his given weapon(s) \u2014 this effect lasts until the rampage ends. His special ability can still be triggered for an added invincibility boost."}

The main cause of Trevor's rage is the fact that people call him a 'motherfucker' or that they insult his &lt;a href=\"Mrs.%20Philips\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt;. He also gets very angry when people make fun of him for being Canadian or because of his accent, usually with an overreaction to the subjects. \nThere are a total of five missions in this series.

Upon asking for a sip of the beer, one redneck begins insulting Trevor before the other one points an &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt; at Trevor. Trevor fights back, acquiring the gun and beginning the mission. \nIn an earlier version of the game, this Rampage becomes available immediately after taking control of Trevor for the first time. However, as of May 2014, it is only unlocked upon completion of the mission &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Industries\"&gt;Trevor Philips Industries&lt;/a&gt;.\nMinimum Completion: Killing 25 rednecks.\nTime Limit: 2 minutes\nEnemies: &lt;a href=\"Rednecks%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Rednecks&lt;/a&gt;\nVehicles: &lt;a href=\"BF\"&gt;BF&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Injection\"&gt;Injection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bravado\"&gt;Bravado&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bison\"&gt;Bison&lt;/a&gt;\nGold Medal Objectives:\nRampage: Vagos.\nThis rampage can be started by completing &lt;a href=\"Friends%20Reunited\"&gt;Friends Reunited&lt;/a&gt; and approaching two &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt; members who are conversing in Spanish in &lt;a href=\"East%20Los%20Santos%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;East Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. The members will notice Trevor's non-Hispanic accent and will start asking where he is from. Trevor overreacts taking offense about his accent, steals a &lt;a href=\"Micro-SMG\"&gt;machine gun&lt;/a&gt; from one member, then he gets irritated and the rampage starts.\nMinimum Completion: Killing 30 gang members.\nTime Limit: 2 minutes\nEnemies: &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos&lt;/a&gt;\nVehicles: &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vigero\"&gt;Vigero&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Albany\"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt;\nGold Medal Objectives:\nRampage: Ballas.\nThis rampage can be started by approaching two &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; members who are loitering near an alleyway in &lt;a href=\"Davis\"&gt;Davis&lt;/a&gt;.

Trevor will headbutt a member who is holding an &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, and the rampage starts. Be careful, it is possible for the Ballas to fire an &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt; at Trevor if he moves further down the alleyway during the rampage.\nMinimum Completion: Killing 30 gang members.\nTime Limit: 2 minutes\nEnemies: &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt;\nVehicles: &lt;a href=\"Ubermacht\"&gt;Ubermacht&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Oracle\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lampadati\"&gt;Lampadati&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Felon\"&gt;Felon&lt;/a&gt;\nGold Medal Objectives:\nRampage: Military.\nThis rampage starts by approaching two &lt;a href=\"Military\"&gt;soldiers&lt;/a&gt; who are attempting to repair a &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt; in front of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt;. They will think that Trevor is a tourist, and then they will begin making jokes about &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; people. Trevor gets angry and takes a &lt;a href=\"Grenade%20Launcher\"&gt;Grenade Launcher&lt;/a&gt; from the truck, and the rampage starts. The Grenade Launcher is the ideal weapon because in this rampage the soldiers always come in vehicles, including &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; tanks, though it takes multiple hits from the grenade to destroy a tank. This rampage is also considerably more difficult to survive (even using Trevor's special ability) due to splash damage from the grenades and the fact the soldiers will intentionally try to hit Trevor with their vehicles, and, obviously, the Rhinos.\nMinimum Completion: Killing 35 soldiers.\nTime Limit: 3 minutes\nEnemies: &lt;a href=\"Military\"&gt;Military&lt;/a&gt;\nVehicles: &lt;a href=\"Canis\"&gt;Canis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"HVY\"&gt;HVY&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Barracks\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt;\nGold Medal Objectives:\nRampage: Hipsters.\nThis rampage starts by approaching a hipster who is talking on his cellphone around &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Park\"&gt;Mirror Park&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Cool%20Beans\"&gt;Cool Beans&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Park%20Boulevard\"&gt;Mirror Park Boulevard&lt;/a&gt;. Trevor will steal the hipster's &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;phone&lt;/a&gt;, throw it across the street, and then comment about the hipster's t-shirt, which reads, \"Yes You \"Are\" A Mother Fucker\". The hipster then gets scared and provokes Trevor at the same time. Trevor takes a &lt;a href=\"Sawn-off%20Shotgun\"&gt;Sawn-off Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; behind a table and the rampage starts.\nMinimum Completion: Killing 20 hipsters.\nTime Limit: 2 minutes\nEnemies: &lt;a href=\"Hipsters\"&gt;Hipsters&lt;/a&gt;\nVehicles: &lt;a href=\"Fixter\"&gt;Fixter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Principe\"&gt;Principe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Faggio\"&gt;Faggio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Weeny\"&gt;Weeny&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Issi\"&gt;Issi&lt;/a&gt;\nGold Medal Objectives:"}

The front wheel pivots from a dual C-shaped frame on the left side, and the chassis sports a sloped fairing with a vented section in the center, while a long steel rod runs from the left side and provides the steering capabilities. A large engine sits around the middle of the whole vehicle and sports numerous exhaust pipes that merge into a single tip on the rear section, while two square headlights are mounted just above the exhaust stacks.\nThe section behind the engine bay consists of a fairing/fuel tank with a narrower profile on the rear end, mounting two rectangular rear-view mirrors and a small dial cluster with analog \"Sports Bike\" dials (derived from motorcycles such as the &lt;a href=\"Akuma\"&gt;Akuma&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bati%20800\"&gt;Bati 801&lt;/a&gt;), as well as long handlebars with a red cable on the left that is connected to the engine. The rearmost section features a small black seat over the axle and the corresponding articulated arms, transmission shafts and suspension springs for the large rear wheels, together with circular tail lights consisting of upper reverse lights, middle brake lights and lower main lights. A saddle bag and a license plate can be seen in the center.\nThe vehicle's primary color is applied on the upper side, while the secondary color is applied on the lower side. It uses a unique set of wheels, where the front one bears a circular plate on the right and the rear ones have six spokes.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Rampant Rocket can be considered as a heavier but faster version of the &lt;a href=\"Chimera\"&gt;Chimera&lt;/a&gt;. Its handling is reasonable at lower speeds and can take corners with ease, as expected from a motorcycle. At higher speeds, however, its suffers from some understeer, struggling a bit to weave through traffic \u2014 though getting to high speed is another weak point.\nDespite its handling and appearance suggesting it is a drag-style vehicle, its acceleration and top speed are lacking, outpacing only the slowest motorcycles like the &lt;a href=\"Bagger\"&gt;Bagger&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wolfsbane\"&gt;Wolfsbane&lt;/a&gt;. Although unable to wheelie, its speed can be slightly increased by leaning forward. Overall, the Rampant Rocket is best considered a novelty, unsuitable for use in racing or as an escape vehicle.\nSimilar to the Chimera, its odd physics handling prevents it pitching and rolling while in midair after a jump, causing to either nosedive or remain at the same angle as when it lifts off. This makes the vehicle unsuitable for stunt jumps. Being a long vehicle, it is impossible to perform wheelies and the chances of getting stuck is greater than most motorcycles. Also, going over curbs on the road has the tendency to fling the vehicle up, causing the user to possibly get knocked off of it, resulting in damage or even death. Despite the seemingly clear room for the front wheel, it struggles to go over moderately tall obstacles.\nThe Rampant Rocket is powered by a big-block V8 engine fitted with a supercharger and a primary drive on the front with a fully-animated &lt;a href=\"Auto%20Exotic\"&gt;Auto Exotic&lt;/a&gt; timing belt and pulleys, coupled to a 3-speed gearbox and powering the rear wheels. The engine sound is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Deviant\"&gt;Deviant&lt;/a&gt;, being a slightly higher-pitched version of the &lt;a href=\"Imperator\"&gt;Imperator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt; ones."}

It is stylised as a medium-sized SUV designed with off-road capabilities in mind, featuring large tires, soft suspensions and a high ground clearance. Despite its size, the two-door Rancher is only capable of holding two occupants, as its rear compartment is not capable of carrying passengers, similar to two-door pickup trucks in the series.\nBoth renditions follows a two-tone color scheme, where the primary color covers the majority of the vehicle, such as the hood, roof, some parts of the side profiling, and the rear bed. The secondary color poses as a stripe-like print on the sides and rear of the vehicle. The ' rendition always have the lower section in a black color, resulting in three different colors on a single car. This was changed in the ' rendition, so the lower section will have the same color as the upper section of the vehicle. Both cars only differs in minor details, such as the headlights, tail lights, rear end and wheels.\nDespite being absent from \"\", the SUV has its &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Rancher\"&gt;gang version&lt;/a&gt;, which shares most of the characteristics, but its details are very different.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Rancher returns to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" with a highly similar design, only now higher quality and slight cosmetic adjustments.\nThis rendition appears to be based on the , while the slight lean of the rear of the cab resemble the . The headlights and tail lights seem to draw from the .\nAgain, the vehicle follows the same two-tone color scheme, in the same manner as the \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition. In the frontal area, basic square headlights with small slit-indicator lights are found at the very edge of the grille-area. The grille is a basic rectangle with 6 splitters, finished in chrome. A basic singular bumper is found, with the front registration plate placed in the center, housed in a black frame. On the hood, a groove can be seen spanning the entire depth of the hood, curving off at the end. The entire hood is slightly raised near the edges. A simple flat front windscreen is found with also-simple rectangular side mirrors attached to the front doors with thin rods. The side windows are lined with a white outline, not present on the front windshield.\nOn the side, the most distinctive feature is the piped side steps found on either side of the vehicle. They attach to the underside of the vehicle. The Declasse logo is printed just behind the front fenders. The vehicle holds a compact design in the side profiling, being a compact 2-door SUT (and SUV when the rear camper-shell is attached). The wheel arches mostly avoid curves, with basic square-shaped arches with a small black arch trim outlining this. On the roof, a small aerial is present in the center.\nOn the rear, the vehicle features thin lighting units curving around the rear quarter. The vehicle's main brake lights are fitted in the center of the housing, with the indicators being at the top of the unit, and the reverse lights being squared, surrounded by the rear fog-lights (which appear unusable in-game). The Declasse's text logo is printed on the left side of the rear tailgate, and \"Rancher\" appears in a red format on the right side of it. The rear license plate is embedded into the tailgate, positioned to the right. The secondary colored \"stripe\" wraps most of the rear tailgate. The rear diff is also centralized on the rear axle. On the underside, the exhaust can be seen clearer, revealing it holds a large silencer directly after the exhaust tips are exposed. The exhaust pipe then diagonally crosses the chassis and follows the driveshaft back to the engine. While the suspension remains too unclear to identify, the Rancher appears to use a mix of both A-frame-dependent suspension (lightly indicated on the front axles) and leaf-suspension (seen on the rear axle, with only a small number of steel packs, hinting its light weight capacity).\nThe Rancher has 6-spoke alloy rims wrapped in high profile off-road tires, with knobbly treads and wide profiling.\nOn the rear underside, the exhaust can be seen. The exhaust takes a basic single exit, twin exhaust configuration, relating back to the modeled straight-4 engine. It is mounted on the left.\nThe Rancher may come with several accessories:\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe Rancher is one of the best SUVs. Though its' top speed and acceleration are only average, its' handling, grip, and ride quality off-road is unmatched. What sets it apart from other SUVs like the &lt;a href=\"Landstalker\"&gt;Landstalker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt; is its' excellent suspension, making the toughest of bumps and hurdles almost nonexistent, and keeping the car stable throughout even San Andreas' winding country roads and rolling hills. Its' 4WD powertrain and large tires provide ample grip for climbing steep hills.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", the car makes an excellent choice for the racing mission &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Zi%20Mu%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Wu Zi Mu&lt;/a&gt;, where its excellent suspension and grip allow it to easily overtake the adversaries, who primarily use rear-wheel drive on-road vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Stallion\"&gt;Stallion&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the Rancher is not an on-road performance oriented vehicle. Its suspension consists of solid axles front and rear, as opposed to the independent suspension on more refined SUV's and pick-ups. This layout, coupled with a potent four-cylinder engine, means that on-road cornering is an erratic affair, with plenty of sliding and body roll.\nHowever, the old-fashioned suspension, together with 4WD and an easily controlled engine, starts to pay off when the vehicle is taken off-road. In the hands of a skillful driver, the Rancher is an excellent off-roader. The high ground clearance means boulders are negotiated with ease. The solid axles keep the vehicle planted, although the driver must always be wary of the risk of a roll-over (due to the high center of gravity).\nThe vehicle features a modeled twincam inline-4, laid longitudinally in a front-engine, all wheel drive layout. The vehicle also features a large rear diff and silenced exhaust system.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Rancher can be modified at the &lt;a href=\"TransFender\"&gt;TransFender&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mod%20Garages\"&gt;mod garage&lt;/a&gt; with paint (two colors), hoods, exhausts, spoilers, lights, nitrous (all), roofs, wheels, stereo (Bass Boost) and hydraulics. However, the &lt;a href=\"Rancher%20%28lure%29\"&gt;Lure variant&lt;/a&gt;, with blacked out windows, cannot be modified, nor can it be exported.\nThe Rancher can be modified at &lt;a href=\"TransFenders\"&gt;TransFenders&lt;/a&gt;."}

The vehicle is largely similar to its two-door counterpart in terms of design and features, but there are minor detail changes in the model. On the front end, the bumper is a bit smaller, has riveted details on it and lacks the vertical black sections beside the license plate, while the grille has seven horizontal separations, with the middle one being wider.\nOn the sides, the vehicle assumes a more generic appearance, lacking the black fenders, the black details running through the sides and the side step bars. The front door windows have black separations beside the A-pillars and uses black trim around the windows, rather than the silver/chrome ones from its two-door counterpart. It also has Light Smoke window tint applied by default.\nOn the rear, the vehicle retains the vertical tail lights from its two-door counterpart, but because of the permanent rear compartment, it uses a large compartment door with no dedicated section for the license plate. The bumper has similar features as the front one, and holds the license plate on the center.\nThe vehicle uses a brown leather interior that is derived from the \"GTA IV\" iteration of the Rancher, albeit altered to fit into the four-door layout. In the enhanced version, it uses a brown derivative of the interior used in the &lt;a href=\"Bobcat%20XL\"&gt;Bobcat XL&lt;/a&gt; and many pick-up trucks, also shared with its &lt;a href=\"Rancher%20XL%20%28snow%29\"&gt;snowy variant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Police%20Rancher\"&gt;Police variant&lt;/a&gt;.\nColor distribution is different to its two-door equivalent, where the primary color is applied on the upper half of the vehicle, while the secondary color is applied on the lower half. Its stock wheels are identical to the ones from its two-door counterpart, being a derivative of the \"Raider\" off-road rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Rancher XL is slightly slower than its two-door counterpart due to the extended chassis, and its acceleration and top speed leaves much to be desired. Its handling is much better than the previous edition, though. Its AWD drivetrain provides decent traction, as well as good capacity to sort uneven terrain thanks to its large wheels and high ground clearance, though it will not be the best at hill climbing due to the weight and acceleration. The Rancher XL is the only vehicle with live axle suspension, while others with a live axle model perform as if they have independent systems.\nDespite its seemingly resilient looks, the Rancher XL's durability is shockingly poor, with one hit often being enough to detach large parts of the vehicle such as its fenders.

The random biker joins Brian's meeting and is seen alongside other members of Brian's faction. It turns out to be a trap as Brian tells his men to kill Johnny and his friends. The random biker starts to shoot at Johnny's faction, but is killed by Johnny and his friends.\nCharacter.\nAppearance.\nLike most minor characters, he reuses a generic Lost biker model. However, he does have a consistent appearance: he usually appears as a white male with a blond mohawk/topknot hairstyle, stubble, and a large skull tattoo on his left scalp.\nJudging by his physical appearance, he is roughly in his early 30's during the events of the game.\nAccording to his T-shirt, this biker worked security at the &lt;a href=\"1997\"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt; \"Cannibal Rock Festival\", making him 29 years old at the very youngest.\nPatches.\nThe following patches appear on the biker's jacket:"}

Until the general public starts to focus on what matters, we don't have a chance of catching this guy.

Will he be older and wiser, but close to retirement, a man who dies in the penultimate scene? Or a young punk, who needs a wisecracking older guy to show him the ropes?

Niko is taken aback by Eddie's strange and disturbing comments, including asking Niko if he enjoys being spanked. Niko sternly tells Eddie to \"fuck off\", and that his behavior is \"not cool.\"\nAn enraged Eddie launches into a tirade about how exactly he's tortured and killed children. For example, he says that he once kidnapped a quarterback, conducted anal rape and \"strangled him into knots,\" and pulled out the intestines of another girl \"just to see if he could feel anything.

The killer's name was Eddie Low. Police are searching his apartment in a quiet Dukes suburb for more information. Residents were angry.\"\"\n\"\"The serial killer they couldn't name has been found. Dead. The killer is believed to have killed up to 10 people over the last few months, usually joggers or nighttime strollers. Police believe he attacked the wrong person, and was himself killed in a fight. Detective Jon Atkinson told this newspaper, \"It's very disappointing. I was just about to make an arrest. I'd solved the case. His name was Eddie Low. He lived in Dukes - I was literally heading over to his house when the news came in another body had turned up. Obviously, the screenplay I am writing about the case will now have a slightly different ending, in which I make the arrest, and it will carry the subtitle 'based on true events', because that will make a better story.\" The mayor commented, \"This is not the LCPD's finest hour. We have a killer on the loose for months, and no leads; then they give him this stupid nickname - 'Eddie Low'.\"\n\"What kind of a nickname is that? Heads will roll for this. Oh, bad joke. I mean, people will suffer.\" Eddie Low was the killer's actual nickname. He was a loner Dukes, who apparently kept an account of his actions online here and on the popular networking site MyRoom.\"\""}

Usually, there will be a twenty minute delay after the session is initiated before the first Random Event(s) can start appearing. Each Random Event is triggered independently so some can occur simultaneously. \nMost Random Events will only appear when a player is near the target location. Once an Event is triggered, it will have an independent active time limit and a cooldown timer at the conclusion of that active timer before another event of the same type can be triggered. As each Random Event can have a different active timer and cooldown time, they will appear more and more randomly as the session duration increases.\nActively participating in one Random Event will not prevent triggering other Random Events, however players actively engaged in any other Free Mode work including &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events\"&gt;Freemode Events&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Challenges\"&gt;Freemode Challenges&lt;/a&gt; will not see a Random Event until that work is completed, but they can still trigger one by getting within range.\nEvents.\nPolice Rescue.\nAdded in update.\nThe player may encounter a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Transporter\"&gt;Police Transporter&lt;/a&gt; with its siren on, driving around various locations on the map, containing an arrested &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McReary\"&gt;Packie McReary&lt;/a&gt; whom the player can rescue for a reward of $10,000, 2,800 &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;RP&lt;/a&gt;, and the \"Gunman\" &lt;a href=\"Awards\"&gt;award&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; will then send a text message suggesting McReary owes a debt to the player that can be repaid by recruiting him for participation in &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20Heist\"&gt;The Diamond Casino Heist&lt;/a&gt;.\nDrug Vehicle.\nAdded in update.\nThe player may encounter an active drug deal between two &lt;a href=\"Street%20Punks\"&gt;Street Punks&lt;/a&gt;, which the player may interrupt and steal the drug vehicle. After collecting the vehicle, the player receives a text from either &lt;a href=\"Al%20Carter\"&gt;Al Carter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Edgar%20Carlos\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"The%20Boss%20%28Families%29\"&gt;The Families Boss&lt;/a&gt; giving a delivery point. The player earns $25,000 and RP for delivering the vehicle.\nSleeping Guard.\nAdded in update. \nA &lt;a href=\"El%20Rubio%27s%20Private%20Security\"&gt;guard&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico\"&gt;Cayo Perico&lt;/a&gt; can appear within &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;.

The plane will be marked as a blue dot on the &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt; and will leave a trail of black smoke behind with its left engine damaged, while also emitting a loud alarm. The player must follow it until it crash-lands and scour the wreckage within a marked area to find a briefcase with $25,000 and .\nSmuggler Cache.\nIntroduced with update, a yellow flare may appear in one of five locations across &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;. \nUpon inspecting this flare, another flare location is given, along with a message asking the player to follow the trail of flares towards a Smuggler Cache. This trail may branch off in one of three possible directions from the initial flare. The player must follow this trail soon after discovering the first, or it will disappear soon after. There are five total flares to be followed and collected before the Cache is discovered, which rewards the player with $25,000 and when opened.\nCrime Scene.\nIntroduced with update.\nA Crime Scene may appear in one of ten locations across &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;.

There are a total of 57 random events in \"GTA V\" (60 in the enhanced version), and completing any 14 of these contributes towards &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;100% Completion&lt;/a&gt;. The first 'set' becomes available after the mission &lt;a href=\"Pulling%20Favors\"&gt;Pulling Favors&lt;/a&gt;, with future 'sets' unlocking after completing certain future missions (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Philips\"&gt;Mr. Philips&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe type of encounter is often determined by the color of the dot that appears on the map. A light blue dot indicates a non-hostile encounter, a red indicates a hostile, while a flashing blue/red dot indicates the player can choose to help or hinder them. Of course, depending on the encounter and the player's actions, the color of the icon may change. Attacking the person will change it to red, whereas helping them will change the icon to light blue.\nMany events will repeat throughout the game at random, though some events, such as those that lead to named event characters (like the Hitcher missions) or the Altruist Cult shootout will only appear once and will not respawn when completed. Events that do repeat include robberies, cop chases, shootouts, muggings, and others.\nCertain types of encounters cannot be completed more than once per in-game week. This is particularly true for the Security Vans, the Border Patrols, the Abandoned Vehicles, and some other event types. In the case that the player has completed an event of a certain type, i.e. Security Vans, they\u00a0will have to wait for 6-7 in-game days before they can encounter that type of event again.\nEvents.\nPrisoner Lifts.\n\"Note 1:\" If the prisoner is run over after the event is finished, &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; members will start attacking the protagonist.\nSecurity Vans.\nSecurity vans can be found throughout Los Santos, either in static locations or on the roads. They will reappear throughout the game at random for all characters.\nExclusive Random Events for Returning Players to the Enhanced Edition.\nRandom Events that are exclusive for returning players to the ."}

Taking objects out of their spawn area can make them disappear from the environment/player's grasp. \nThe following is a list of objects that can be picked up and used as thrown items. Some objects have similar variants, which produce no damage, and simply break once thrown:\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nAlthough objects can vastly differ amongst each other, their performance is about the same when thrown at an NPC or objects within the environment. The thrown object deals little damage but can easily knock over pedestrians. It can be picked up again as long as the object is not breakable. Some objects have enough force when thrown to damage the environment, such as shattering certain windows and cracking vehicle windshields. This can lead to instances where items such as edible burgers being capable of cracking windshields, although all the caused damage appears to be superficial. It should be noted that certain objects, such as the common coffee cup dropped by NPCs, appear to be unable to cause aesthetic damage. Other objects cannot be picked up at all; i.e grocery bag contents, books. \nIf the player were to walk into an NPC holding an object whilst pressing the pick up button, the player will quickly take it from them. This can be handy for objects that are too small to easily find.\nThrowing objects at occupied vehicles, walls or interactive decorations does not attract the law, regardless of damage caused. Throwing objects at people or police can trigger a one-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, immediately in the latter case. Sometimes, throwing an object into a group of gang members or police officers will likely cause them to react to the situation (fighting back or causing a wanted level, respectively). Pickable objects are also capable of causing gas canisters to explode, with some persistence. Although it is not usually the case, rarely these explosions can trigger a one-star wanted level. \nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nPickable Objects can be found across &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; and are fairly common among pedestrians and businesses. They can also be in unexpected places, leading to a sense of realism. They can be picked up by pressing (&lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;)/ (&lt;a href=\"PS3\"&gt;PS3&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"PS4\"&gt;PS4&lt;/a&gt;)/ (&lt;a href=\"PC\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;) when near an object. Once picked up, it can be aimed and thrown. Areas where such objects can commonly be found are:"}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Ocelot\"&gt;Ocelot&lt;/a&gt; in the .\nDescription.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\".\nThe Jugular appears as a two-door sports car.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Jugular returns to \"GTA Online\" as a four-door saloon. It was added as part of the continuation of update, released on October 10, 2019, during the &lt;a href=\"Jugular%20Week\"&gt;Jugular Week&lt;/a&gt; event. \n\"Grand Theft Auto VI\".\nThe Jugular can be seen parked on the opposite side of the road along the &lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20GTA%20VI%20Ocean%20Drive-inspired%20road\"&gt;Ocean Drive-inspired road&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Beach%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice Beach&lt;/a&gt;, in the first &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI/Trailers\"&gt;trailer&lt;/a&gt; (0:31).\nInfluence.\n2D Universe.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto\", the Jugular has striking resemblance to the , given the overall shape and the roof panels, hinting an apparent use of gull-wing doors. \nHD Universe.\nReturning to \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", the Jugular assumes a totally different design, based on the . The headlights are similar to the , while the front bumper is taken from the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\".\nJugulars are seen in a variety of single colors for the body. It can be characterized by its distinct headlight housing and rounded rear end.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Jugular is depicted as a sports saloon with various modifications around the body, where the front fascia features a carbon-fibre extender/splitter at the bottom that spans the entire car's width, while a trapezium-shaped section with an horizontal separation can be seen just above it. The middle section is predominated by large intakes with a mesh pattern, where the central one is separated by a black separation, while two curved separations define the outer intakes, which are painted. The upper area is occupied by the central mesh grille bearing the manufacturer emblem on the front, as well as the headlamp units on the outer sides, which consist of dual main lamps, outer turn signals and moder light strips around. The bonnet has elevated areas that start from the upper corners of the grille and lead towards the cabin pillars, along with an impressed area that houses a front intake duct and a trapezium-shaped formation near the windscreen. Said bonnet also opens to reveal the engine bay partially covered by black sections.\nThe sides of the car are fitted with bolt-on extensions on the fender arches, which leave the wheels slightly exposed on the back section, as well as carbon-fibre details over the front exit vents and large side skirts at the bottom. The sides also have inset formations created by the front exit vents, which is more prominent around the front and become flatter as they approach to the rear section. On the greenhouse area, the car has black trim around the windows and beside the roof panel, together with black inner pillars and mirror shells mounted on the A-pillars.\nThe rear of the car makes use of a lip spoiler on the upper side of the boot, while the rear end bears the corresponding manufacturer badging and license plate. The outer sides have large tail lamp units, consisting of large red lamps with smaller turn/reverse lamps within the red units. On the bumper area, the car has ridged formations on the outer sides conforming the rear exit vents, as well as a black section covering the lower rear and part of the underside, housing five diffuser blades and two square-shaped exhausts. A carbon-fibre spoiler is mounted on top of the boot lid.\nThe car uses a dedicated \"Jugular\" interior, which is essentially a derivative of the one found on cars like the &lt;a href=\"Nero\"&gt;Nero&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"XA-21\"&gt;XA-21&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Revolter\"&gt;Revolter&lt;/a&gt;. However, the rear seats are similar to cars like the &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Diamond\"&gt;Super Diamond&lt;/a&gt;, and the analog dials are borrowed from the &lt;a href=\"Raiden\"&gt;Raiden&lt;/a&gt;. The Ocelot emblem can be seen on the horn cap.\nThe car is painted with a primary colour for the bodywork, the outer portion of the rims and the interior stitching, as well as a secondary colour for the front horizontal separation and the roof panel. A trim colour is also available for the interior, being applied to the dashboard, horn cap, part of the doors and the seats. Its rims are similar to the \"Rally Master\" tuner rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, but appear to be slightly larger in diameter and are wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\".\nThe Jugular has a good top speed and handling, but has low durability.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Jugular possess average performance, but makes up for its traction and all wheel drive layout, allowing it to accelerate quicker and drive efficiently over uneven roads and moderately steep hills. While its handling is average, the car tends to understeer at even medium speeds, requiring effective use of the brakes to take corners appropriately. Top speed and braking remains decent compared to sports sedans like the &lt;a href=\"Jackal\"&gt;Jackal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Jugular has one (the eleventh) Advanced Flag enabled. The purpose of this flag is unknown, but it appears to have little impact on performance.\nThe Jugular is powered by a V8 engine (suggested by its cover), coupled to a 8-speed gearbox in a F4 layout (30% front, 70% rear). Its engine sound is similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"XA-21\"&gt;XA-21&lt;/a&gt;, and the exhaust may also crackle after letting off the gas at high revs."}

{"id": "16214", "revid": "52798218", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=16214", "title": "Julio Ochoa", "text": "Julio Ochoa is a character who served as the mayor of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; during the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and its .\nHistory.\nBackground.\nOchoa was elected as the mayor of Liberty City before &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;. Much of his policies were unknown, but he was notorious for his draconian anti-terrorism measures and ineffective gun control laws. He ran for office alongside &lt;a href=\"Bryce%20Dawkins\"&gt;Bryce Dawkins&lt;/a&gt;, who allegedly used market connections to provide financial backing to the Ochoa ticket. During his rise in politics, Ochoa began to associate with individuals such as &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Stubbs\"&gt;Thomas Stubbs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Gravelli\"&gt;Jon Gravelli&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs reported by the \"&lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt;\", Ochoa was responsible for escalating the War on Terror. During the summer before the events of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" take place, he closed the bridges due to an escalated threat of terrorism. This policy was subject to much controversy, as locking out &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt; and the eastern boroughs from &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; was unprecedented. The closure had a significant economic impact on the city, with thousands of commuters unable to reach work, and businesses estimated to have lost \"millions of dollars a day.\"\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nOchoa does not appear during the game, but he is mentioned frequently by the news media on their websites and the radio. The closest Ochoa came to an appearance was in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\", as Thomas Stubbs III receives a phone call from &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt; while in a meeting with Mayor Ochoa. Also, Jon Gravelli claims he was going to receive a visit from Ochoa while in the &lt;a href=\"Schottler%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the autumn of 2008, Ochoa caved to public pressure and reopened the bridges that separate Algonquin from the eastern boroughs. Subsequently, both the &lt;a href=\"Hickey%20Bridge\"&gt;Hickey Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Booth%20Tunnel\"&gt;Booth Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; reopened for travel, allowing for travel between Alderney and Liberty. Ochoa's decision is highly unpopular with &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt;, as they claim he shows \"classic liberal weakness.\" Weazel further claims that \"terrorists use bridges to cross rivers and to kill innocent lives.\"\nAccording to Weazel News, Ochoa defends his strict gun control, which has made the sale and possession of firearms illegal in Liberty City. Ochoa's task force also launches cases against &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt; stores across the country. The mayor's office boasts about Liberty City's low crime and high murder conviction rate. However, allegations of statistical tampering undermine these supposed accomplishments. A local lawyer, &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Goldberg\"&gt;Tom Goldberg&lt;/a&gt;, points out that city officials clear out \"cold cases\" to reach a high conviction rate. Finally, Goldberg concludes his statement, asserting that Liberty City is \"dangerous\" and residents' children are \"not safe.\" \nAfter it is reported that Ochoa's approval numbers have fallen, he launches a radical new plan, called the \"Sinking Ship Solution,\" which would clean the Liberty City subway by flooding it. The unorthodox plan aims to clear out rats, homeless people, and \"annoying\" underground musicians. Additionally, he claims this is an effective method to eliminate the smell of urine from the subway system.\nDuring another radio broadcast, Ochoa is presumed dead after he does not respond to staff with his &lt;a href=\"BitterSweet%20Email%20Device\"&gt;BitterSweet Email Device&lt;/a&gt;. Local government officials call for his resignation, saying that people with mobile email are obligated to immediately respond.\nWhile on a date with &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carmen%20Ortiz\"&gt;Carmen Ortiz&lt;/a&gt; says she saw Ochoa while he opened a new hospital ward. Apparently, Carmen could tell that Ochoa wanted to sleep with her. However, out of loyalty for Niko, she passed up on the opportunity. Carmen's version of the story is never substantiated.\nDuring one of the &lt;a href=\"Higgins%20Helitours\"&gt;Higgins Helitours&lt;/a&gt;, the pilot mentions to Niko and the other tourists that Ochoa eased safety restrictions on helicopters and their pilots. Mayor Ochoa also settles the &lt;a href=\"diamonds\"&gt;diamonds&lt;/a&gt; case when he allows &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Kapowitz\"&gt;Jerry Kapowitz&lt;/a&gt; to keep all proceeds on the sale of the diamonds after he found them, despite over a hundred claims of their ownership. The reason given was that it would be impossible to verify the claims. It makes Ochoa extremely unpopular with a number of people in the Liberty City underworld.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIt is unknown if Ochoa is still mayor during the events of \"\", as an Ammu-Nation website has been set up, which contradicts Ochoa's strict gun regulations.\nCharacter.\nInfluence.\nJulio Ochoa appears to be based on , a Democratic Party nominee for New York City mayor in 2005.

It is a four-lane recessed roadway with overpass exits at relatively evenly spaced intervals. It connects to the main highway servicing the southern ends of &lt;a href=\"Tierra%20Robada\"&gt;Tierra Robada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bone%20County\"&gt;Bone County&lt;/a&gt;, to the highway servicing northwestern Las Venturas and Bone County, and to the major highway connecting Las Venturas with &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe only constituent of this freeway system that does not share the \"Julius Thruway\" designation is the &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Gold%20Parkway\"&gt;Harry Gold Parkway&lt;/a&gt;, which runs through the center of Las Venturas, bisecting the city into western and eastern portions. The nature of the ring-road is such that, if the player is to travel by road alone, it is impossible to enter Las Venturas without traveling on it.\nLike &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Gold%20Parkway\"&gt;Harry Gold Parkway&lt;/a&gt;, Julius Thruway is named after , an American-born communist and Soviet spy.\nThe thruway is based on the .\nComponents.\nJulius Thruway North.\nThe northern arm of the freeway connects to Julius Thruway West at the &lt;a href=\"Pilson%20Intersection\"&gt;Pilson Intersection&lt;/a&gt;, and to Julius Thruway East and the &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Gold%20Parkway\"&gt;Harry Gold Parkway&lt;/a&gt;.

This also connects (at the Pilson Intersection) to the highway heading northwest out of Las Venturas toward &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Meadows%20Airfield\"&gt;Verdant Meadows&lt;/a&gt;. The word \"north\" in the name can be somewhat misleading though, since it does not provide any direct access to the northern areas of Las Venturas. The closest exits to these areas are the northernmost exits on the East and West sections. Unlike other Julius Thruway segments, it is bent; due to this, the traffic here is slightly faster.\nJulius Thruway East.\nThe eastern arm of the freeway, providing service to the &lt;a href=\"Creek\"&gt;Creek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pilgrim\"&gt;Pilgrim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Linden%20Side\"&gt;Linden Side&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Old%20Venturas%20Strip\"&gt;Old Venturas Strip&lt;/a&gt; districts, as well as the eastern portions of casinos such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Camel%27s%20Toe\"&gt;The Camel's Toe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Come-A-Lot\"&gt;Come-A-Lot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Caligula%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Caligula's Palace&lt;/a&gt;.

In \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\", the player could only slide over or under vehicles as opposed to jumping over them, they cannot slide over or under anything else though.\nDescription.\nIn ', \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;GTA IV&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\"\u00a0and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;GTA V&lt;/a&gt;\", climbing was introduced so when the jump button is pressed near a low (but not too low), medium sized, reachable or vaultible object, the player will climb onto or over the object. Jumping is usually used to jump over a gap that can't really be gone over if without jumping. In ', a rolling command is used, even though it's not actually a jump that's performed, objects can be vaulted over so it acts similar to the jumping command.\nControls.\nIn order to jump using the default controls on a &lt;a href=\"PlayStation\"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt;, \"\" must be pressed. On the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20%28console%29\"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt;, \"\" must be pressed and on &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;, the spacebar is pressed (with the exception of \"\" where shift is the jump button).\nThe iOS/Android port of \"GTA III\" features a seperate jump button as well, while in the port of \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", it's mapped to the same button as sprinting (double-tap to jump), and for the \"GTA San Andreas\" iOS/Android version, player will climb/jump over objects automatically if the player makes contact with the object while sprinting.\nJumping and climbing.\nIn some of the first games, the &lt;a href=\"Protagonist\"&gt;protagonists&lt;/a&gt; couldn't jump and climb over objects such as walls or gates, the protagonist could only jump which was still useful for avoiding collisions with vehicles.\nIn later games, the protagonists could jump up and climb onto an object. With the same controls as jumping, the protagonist will automatically latch onto the top of an object within reach, climb up it, or if it's a gate or wall, climb over it and land on the other side.\nIn \"GTA V\", while in story mode, if the player jumps then immediately presses \" on the Xbox, \" on the Playstation or \"R\" on PC, they can rag doll themselves. This does not work on \"GTA Online\", however."}

The logo's \"The Quick Fix\" tagline uses which is the same Monster Energy uses on its logo for its tagline, the text also has a light grey outline just like the Monster logo.\nThe term \"junk\" carries multiple entendres; at face value it can be seen as a reference to the unhealthy nature of energy drinks. \"Junk\" is also a slang term for &lt;a href=\"heroin\"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt;, evidenced by the spoon/syringe incorporated into the \"U\", as well as the slogan \"the quick fix.\" It could also be a take on the term \"adrenaline junkie,\" or a compulsively energetic and adventurous person. Junk could also be a reference to the slang for penis. This is further supported by the syringe, which looks like someone masturbating. \nProducts.\nPost-Rebrand Products.\nWith the Junk Energy rebrand in update, the brand seemingly replaced their lineup with new flavors, judging from the colored logos.

Depending on the location, the player may find a JUNK parachute in the open or a small booth.\nThese activities are available daily, so a new set of ten jumps appears every day, regardless of how many were completed the previous day.

They were introduced as part of the continuation of the update, released on July 20, 2023, during the &lt;a href=\"La%20Coureuse%20Week\"&gt;La Coureuse Week&lt;/a&gt; event.\nDescription.\nJunk Energy Time Trials are short races from one location to another. They are locked to the &lt;a href=\"Junk%20Energy%20Inductor\"&gt;Junk Energy Inductor&lt;/a&gt; provided nearby (although one can still bring their own personal version or even the &lt;a href=\"Inductor\"&gt;regular model&lt;/a&gt;), and the goal is to beat a par time, rewarding the player with &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; and reputation. A purple corona will highlight the starting point, which can be seen on the map as a purple bicycle .\nOnce the player starts the trial, the screen will fade to black, after which they will assume control of an Inductor. A 3-second countdown begins and then the race starts. Unlike standard &lt;a href=\"Time%20Trials\"&gt;Time Trials&lt;/a&gt;, the player must follow checkpoints, similar to &lt;a href=\"Races%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;land races&lt;/a&gt;. Players must take advantage of the boost functionality to reach checkpoints quicker, as well as the bunny hop functionality to sort out small obstacles.\nThe race is live and one-player only, meaning that other players can see the player racing in the freemode session. To avoid interruptions by others, the player is switched to passive mode.\nIf the player took a wrong turn or has gone over the par time, they can hold (PC), (Xbox One/Series X|S), or (PlayStation 4/5) to restart the race. The player will then be placed back at the start and the countdown timer starts again. If the player falls from the bicycle, they are given 20 seconds to re-enter it before failing the time trial. Entering a different vehicle, destroying the bicycle or sending their personal one back to storage will also result on failing the time trial.\nJunk Energy Time Trials are unique and change every day (real-time) in a followed order. Once the player has beaten the par time once, the time trial becomes unavailable for both characters until the next day.\nThere are a total of fourteen time trials."}

They head to &lt;a href=\"Commerce\"&gt;Commerce&lt;/a&gt; and Big Smoke enters the &lt;a href=\"Atrium\"&gt;Atrium&lt;/a&gt;. After a brief moment, a shootout is heard inside, and Carl quickly rushes inside, protecting Smoke from attacking &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt; goons. Once all of the Russians are killed, the two hop on a &lt;a href=\"BF-400\"&gt;BF-400&lt;/a&gt; and attempt to escape. Carl will use the &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt; with unlimited ammo and acts as the shooter, killing as many enemies as possible. On the way, they jump over the ramp of a &lt;a href=\"Packer\"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt; to escape a roadblock, causing all of the Russians there to be obliterated in a huge explosion, however the bike survives.

Walk into the red marker, watch the cutscene if you will, after the cutscene your view will change to Big Smoke's &lt;a href=\"Glendale%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Glendale&lt;/a&gt; (note: whatever vehicle you arrived in will be lost). Now follow the marker on your minimap to the &lt;a href=\"Atrium\"&gt;Atrium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Commerce\"&gt;Commerce&lt;/a&gt;; it's a short drive, so don't drive onto the red marker immediately if you want to hear all the dialogue in the car. Stop in the red marker and watch the cutscene.\nAfter it you will be inside the Atrium. Smoke will yell at you to get in cover. Now for a gunbattle with the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt;. A health bar for Smoke appears on screen and you need to take everybody out before Smoke is killed. You are automatically given a Micro-SMG so use it to shoot the Russian taking cover to your left. Then shoot his friend who is taking cover a few meters behind him. Look up at the balcony above the goon you just blasted to see another guy taking cover behind the balcony. Waste him. There should be several goons taking cover behind the Atrium's main fountain so blast them too. After there dead move out of your current cover and take a new cover behind the fountain. Watch out for a Russian who comes up behind you. There should be a Russian coming down from the stairs where Smoke has moved, shoot him. Turn to see Russians taking cover on the other side of the Atrium. Kill the two that are in cover and the other one blasting out into the open. Look up at the balcony near the stairs and shoot the goon up there. After that Smoke will tell you to follow him, but before you do, quickly race around and pick up ammo and cash from the dead bodies (which disappears quickly). Also, duck into the alcove where Smoke is waiting for an armor pick-up, if needed. Then, approach Smoke.\nYou will appear outside the Atrium. Shoot the nearest goon taking cover near you and the other goon behind him. There will be another goon behind him and another one running up the stairs. Waste them then turn left up the stairs instead of going straight ahead. Once up the stairs waste any goons there. Look to your right and waste some more goons. After they are dead you'll only have a second or two to pick up the nearest dropped cash and ammo (or no time at all if you shot all the goons from a distance).\nIn a brief cutscene that follows, you and Smoke jump on a &lt;a href=\"BF-400\"&gt;BF-400&lt;/a&gt; and drive out of a parking lot, followed by a pair of motorcycles.\nOnce you are out you will be on the back of the bike so you can shoot any thugs that follow you. You have no control over steering; let Big Smoke handle that. And for most of this chase, you'll need to keep looking behind. Smoke's health car is now replaced by a health bar for the bike; if it reaches zero, the bike explodes and the mission is failed.\nThere will be a bike behind you, target the riders instead of the bike to take it out quickly (this is easier said than done as auto-aiming is \"disabled\" during the chase). After that a &lt;a href=\"Packer\"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt; truck will come after you. Don't bother shooting it, its indestructible. After Smoke complains about the traffic another bike will come after you. Shoot the riders off. Smoke will do a jump over two buses (the game awards a modest insane stunt bonus for this, even though you aren't driving). After that the pursuing Packer will smash into a bus and stop. Smoke will then halt the bike as you come to a three car roadblock. Change your view to the front and keep shooting the middle car until it explodes and destroys it. Then turn to the left of the bike and shoot the two goons near a car in front of you.\nSmoke will then drive the bike down the empty flood canal. Return to your rear view as two more bikes appear. Waste the riders. Another bike will then shoot of a bridge and land next to you, take it out. Then ANOTHER bike will jump off ANOTHER bridge. Take it out too. Then two cars will come up behind it. Aim for the gunners poking their heads out the windows to render them useless, you don't need to continuously shoot it as the driver can't do anything anyway. After that a cutscene will show the &lt;a href=\"Packer\"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt; jumping off a bridge and into the canal. Again don't bother shooting the Packer, as it is indestructible. Two bikes and car will also appear behind you. Kill the riders and gunner. Two more cars will shoot into the canal, one of them will get blown up from a car dropped by the packer, the other one rams into another car and blows up. Watch a ramp for more bikes. Shoot em' up, and Smoke will drive up one of the canals side ramps. Another bike will jump onto the ramp, pop it. A bike and car will come up behind you. Blast em. Then a cutscene will show Smoke driving tha bike up the Packer's ramp and the cars exploding. There will be two more stationary cars in front of you. They blow up with one shot so shoot them. Smoke will drive up to the \"Old Sewer Tunnel\" shoot the two thugs in front of it the shoot out its gate and Smoke will drive through. Then four bikes will come up behind you.\nBy this point, it's likely the bike's \"health\" will be very low, so you need to treat the final portion of the chase carefully. If you can shoot out of the drivers, do so. Otherwise, there are two sets of explosive barrels that can be detonated, but care must be taken so that your bike isn't caught in the explosion.\nSmoke will finally drive into a parking lot near the beach and the mission ends (Carl will need to find his own transportation, but there's usually a car or two parked nearby).\nMission cleared.\nThe reward for this mission is increased respect (plus the few dollars awarded by the insane stunt jump)"}

There are only two cases heard in-game, Williams-Jones vs Williams-Jones and Davis vs Allan.\nCases.\nWilliams-Jones vs Williams-Jones.\n&lt;a href=\"Lori%20Williams-Jones\"&gt;Lori Williams-Jones&lt;/a&gt; is angry about the amount of time her husband, &lt;a href=\"Chuck%20Williams-Jones\"&gt;Chuck Williams-Jones&lt;/a&gt;, has been spending playing the fantasy computer game \"&lt;a href=\"Loot%20and%20Wank\"&gt;Loot and Wank&lt;/a&gt;\". She claims that Chuck would sometimes play the game until 2 a.m., and after coming to bed would \"grab her ass\" and \"treat her like a troll\" while saying \"two damage, two damage\". Despite this, Lori says that she till loves her husband, but wants him to know \"I'm not an avatar!\"\nUpon hearing the claim, Judge Grady immediately tells Lori that she is an avatar, and the reason her husband was playing so much time playing \"Loot and Wank\" was because she \"got fat and stopped being sexy\". He advises her to do something positive by getting plastic surgery.\nChuck makes his counter-argument next, immediately stating that he thinks his wife is possessed by Satan, mainly down to the facts that \"she doesn't refill the ice tray, she hates my parents, she stopped giving me head, she spends all my money and thinks she's doing me a massive fucking favor sending out Christmas cards\". After Judge Grady asks about the Williams-Jones' hyphenated surname, Chuck states that it was Lori's idea, as he was born Chuck Williams; he went along with her because he thinks it's fair, as merging surnames \"comes from a time when women were considered property.\" He instead claims that \"women are defective and misbegotten, but I don't own her\" while adding on that he \"would like to own a human being some day\", particularly a \"young, nubile, &lt;a href=\"Philippines\"&gt;Filipino&lt;/a&gt; boy who can sit in my tropical hut and play games and decide who does what by playing hands-free catch the quarter.\"\nJudge Grady butts in to say that hyphenating his surname has turned Chuck into \"half a man\", and asks if he now pees sitting down, to which Chuck awkwardly replies that he does, though he also says that he has to agree to ensure he can still get laid. Lori backs this by telling Judge Grady that they have an equal household. She states that Chuck \"wears tampons whenever I do so that we may both experience the same burden when I'm on my flow.\"\nAt this point, Judge Grady takes the side of Chuck, simply because he is a man, going on to add \"you know who has made the most money throughout history? \"The man\". Who have been the great leaders? \"Men\". Maybe you had Cleopatra, but &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egyptians&lt;/a&gt; live in triangles, tetrahedrons and shit; a triangle is not manly. Who fought the best wars? \"Men\". Who makes the best murderers? \"Men\". Who invented the plague? \"Men\". Following this rant, he asks Lori \"so what if he wants to come home and spend time online with his guild and pleasure elves, running around with his Orcy friends? Let him.\"\nLori next begins to argue that Chuck needs to spend more time with their children, because they \"depend on us, we should be protecting, coddling our children, never letting them out of our sight, electronic tags on them at all times, making them paranoid and neurotic.\" After also adding that it's the future, Judge Grady turns to Chuck, asking him where his &lt;a href=\"Jetpack\"&gt;Jetpack&lt;/a&gt; is, to which he replies \"I don't have one, Your Honor.\" Judge Grady tells him this is correct because \"technology is a lie sent by Liberals to kill us, apart from weapons technology which we use to kill other people.\" He asks Lori if she has ever had a three-way, which she replies \"no Your Honor, it is revolting.\"\nAfter further disagreement, Lori finally breaks, telling the judge that \"This is insulting. This is a court of law. All that you've given me is a lot of dog penis and woman hating. What is wrong with you Judge Grady?\" He lets her know that this isn't a courtroom, it's a studio, and that he is more interested in ratings than justice. After apparently pleasuring himself under his robe while watching Lori argue, he returns to his quarters to make judgement.\nUpon returning, Judge Grady has Chuck tell Lori \"I love you baby, and I will always remember, how good this felt\" before telling him to \"smack that bitch\", to which Chuck duly agrees, slapping Lori across the face. Judge Grady laughs, conceding that this was just for his pleasure as he \"loves domestic violence\". Moving onto the real judgement, Judge Grady says that the courtroom audience names the game, and the plaintiff and defendant have to play it. The audience chooses a duel, meaning both Chuck and Lori get given a gun to kill the other with. Before Judge Grady can finish his next sentence, Chuck immediately picks up his gun, calls Lori a \"stupid whore\", then shoots her, killing her immediately. Judge Grady is annoyed by this, as he still has three minutes to kill before the ad-break. Because of this, he sentences Chuck to 30 days prison time, so that he can \"think about what you did to my ratings.\"\nDavis vs Allan.\n&lt;a href=\"Angela%20Allan\"&gt;Angela Allan&lt;/a&gt; is suing her ex-boyfriend of one year, &lt;a href=\"Lavar%20Davis\"&gt;Lavar Davis&lt;/a&gt;, for $5000 by Allan to fix damages to her car which Lavar caused with a &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Bat\"&gt;baseball bat&lt;/a&gt;.\nLavar immediately calls Angela crazy, to which Judge Grady concludes \"yeah, yeah, sounds like the truth to me\" before banging his gavel. Angela butts in to ask to tell her side of the story, to which Judge Grady agrees, going on to ask her to sit on his lap while he strokes her back.\nAngela states that she had been together with Lavar for over a year and that he had began acting crazy. She is interrupted by Judge Grady's groping, to which he tells her to shush as it is \"part of the legal process\".\nJudge Grady moves back to Lavar, who states \"we were together for a while, she was fine, she carries herself well, she's got big err-errs, if you know what I mean\" to which Judge Grayd agrees that \"she sure does, I'm feeling them right now\". Lavar goes on to add that \"she's evil, and a cheater\" and that she had scratched his brand-new truck which he needed due to being an accountant. Judge Grady takes Lavar's side, saying that he is the kind of man who needs a new truck \"to feel like a man again\".\nAngela states that Lavar sits outside her house at all times of the night, and that he is there in the morning watching her. When she goes to the store, Lavar is watching her \"through the &lt;a href=\"Sprunk\"&gt;Sprunk&lt;/a&gt; bottles on aisle 7\". Lavar immediately refutes this, telling the judge \"I'm not a stalker, Your Honor, after my last conviction I'm just trying to get some information.\" When asked by the judge what information he is looking for, Lavar states that he wants to know \"who she's screwing so I can kill him.\" Angela tells Judge Grady that because of this, Lavar is psychotic, before being groped once more.\nGoing on further with his story, Lavar states that he was really mad about his truck, so he went to his quiet place after his yoga class, meditated, then \"kind of accidentally beat all of the window out of her car with a baseball bat, pee'd in the front seat, slashed the tires and took a dump in the air filter.\" Judge Grady loves this, laughing specifically at Lavar taking a dump in the air filter, as Lavar goes on to add that \"every time she turns on the air conditioner, her car smells like my shit.\" Judge Grady tells Angela that this is why she is the \"undisputed weaker sex and we are humiliating you on the radio. Name on woman wrestler who's any good. Name the first woman on the moon. \"Ah, trick question\". Name one woman pro football player. How many women wrote Shakespeare's plays. Answer me, you can't.\"\nAfter being asked if she deserved all this, Angela states that \"he owes me. He's got a good child and I had his child.\" Turning the conversation to Lavar, Judge Grady asks if they had a child, to which Lavar comments \"we did, but I tried to do the right thing and push it down the stairs, like you recommended on one of your shows, but she had it anyway, and then I tried to sell it on the internet.\" Judge Grady calls this a \"good deal\", before moving back to Angela, who adds \"he acts like he isn't the father, I had to do everything on my own, I didn't sleep for six months.\" On this, Judge Grady calls Angela a \"terrible mother\", saying he can tell just by listening to her.\nLavar goes on to add that \"when I met her I was 24, she said she was 23 but was really 13.\" Angela refutes this, saying that she told Lavar that she was 13 as soon as they met, to which Lavar simply replies \"well they sound alike\". She says that Lavar told her it was okay because he was \"from South Carolina\".\nUpon asking \"how do I know it's my baby anyway\", Judge Grady tells Lavar that a DNA test says so, to which Lavar adds \"what is DNA, I've never seen it, and I'm an accountant. How are you going to believe in something you can't see? I can't see the wind\". Judge Grady laps this up, saying \"I ain't never seen DNA, or a stem cell, or a law degree for that matter.\" He then returns to his quarters to make judgement, taking Angela with him.\nJudge Grady returns, asking the studio audience what game the plaintiff and defendant should play, to which they choose the gladiator cage. A lion in the cage immediately kills Angela Allan, biting off her arm, before turning on Lavar, killing him too. Judge Grady tell the studio audience that after the lion is done, they can eat what's left. A member of the audience later states that human meat does indeed taste like chicken."}

She sometimes reads a book during interviews and forgets when there's a commercial playing.\nK-Chat is one of two stations in \"Vice City\" not represented in the \"\", the other being &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Public%20Radio\"&gt;VCPR&lt;/a&gt;.\nVice City Interviews (1986).\nK-Chat runs \"live\" interviews with both local and national celebrities, along with listener call-in participation. During the broadcast played in the game, Amy talks with seven interviewees, some of whom appear elsewhere in the game.\nThe first guest on the show is &lt;a href=\"Jezz%20Torrent\"&gt;Jezz Torrent&lt;/a&gt;, of the fictional band &lt;a href=\"Love%20Fist\"&gt;Love Fist&lt;/a&gt;, whom Amy admires, along with his drug-addicted \"girlfriend\" &lt;a href=\"Mandy\"&gt;Mandy&lt;/a&gt;. Jezz talks about the commercial failure of his recent album, which he blames on , and about the themes of his music. After the segment ends, they hold a contest to win a ticket to their concert and promoting said concert.\nAfter this segment is an interview with professor and radical feminist &lt;a href=\"Michaela%20Carapadis\"&gt;Michaela Carapadis&lt;/a&gt;. Michaela is obsessed with hating men and even dresses as one, pressuring Amy to do so. She also discusses her recently published thesis, which describes an undercover experience on her study into the male psyche - cross-dressing so as to approach males and study their mentality. She is later insulted by a past-feminist caller on air who tells her her work is \"totally nonsense and is nothing but a load of crap\".\nFollowing that is an interview with &lt;a href=\"Pat%20%22Mr.%20Zoo%22%20Flannerdy\"&gt;Pat \"Mr. Zoo\" Flannerdy&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n animal lover who is implied to have been in zoophilic relationships with animals. Pat attempts to cover up a call that discusses a court case where he went through mental therapy, to which ponders Amy. He is later removed from the studio by his &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Phillips\"&gt;doctor&lt;/a&gt; after talking about a relationship with a dead dolphin called Bobo.\nAfter Flannerdy is removed from the studio, Amy interviews a New Age priestess by the name of &lt;a href=\"Gethsemanee%20Starhawk%20Moonmaker\"&gt;Gethsemanee Starhawk Moonmaker&lt;/a&gt;, who reminds Amy of her aunt. Gethsemanee preaches traditional and naturalist views such as growing out body hair and denouncing machines and technology. During this interview, a caller named &lt;a href=\"Freddy%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;Freddy&lt;/a&gt; makes lewd comments to Gethsemanee, asking her for masochistic punishment.\nThe next interviewee is &lt;a href=\"BJ%20Smith\"&gt;BJ Smith&lt;/a&gt;, an aggressive and overzealous American football legend who discusses his recent fitness tapes and his comeback after working at &lt;a href=\"Sunshine%20Autos\"&gt;a car dealership&lt;/a&gt; for the past few years. During the show, BJ attempts several times to flirt with Amy, who rejects his advances.\nAfter BJ Smith's interview is &lt;a href=\"Claude%20Maginot\"&gt;Claude Maginot&lt;/a&gt;, a classically-trained actor who is ashamed at his recent forced career change - a successful audition for the part of the father in \"&lt;a href=\"Just%20the%20Five%20of%20Us\"&gt;Just the Five of Us&lt;/a&gt;\", a show that Amy admires much to his dismay. He attempts to discuss his unsuccessful interpretive dance performance, \"&lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Future%2C%20There%20will%20be%20Robots\"&gt;In the Future, There will be Robots&lt;/a&gt;\", such as a scene where Maginot frees a manatee from the past. However, Amy finds the work \"boring\" and denounces him as being \"weird and creepy\", to which Maginot replies that Amy is a philistine.\nFinally, Norse deity impersonator &lt;a href=\"Thor\"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt; appears to further explain and sell his series of self-help tapes, which give very ancient, violence-driven answers to common personal problems, such as decapitating one's girlfriend and parading her head on a stick as a declaration of love. He is critical of women, exampled in his treatment of Amy, and he is known to speak in the third person. One of the callers of the shows is from the Vice City chapter of the Bloods, who speaks in Jive and claims that the others in the gang are a big fan of him."}

As such, there are somewhat nostalgic comments in the radio stingers, such as \"music never gets old, just a little *cough* dusty\" and mentions to \"buddies from the '70s [who have] gone to rehab\". The stingers also mock the current music trends of the time, such as grunge and Gangsta rap.\n\"The Dust\", the station's nickname, is a reference to the drug phencyclidine, commonly known as \"angel dust\". As such, the station's stingers take a new meaning when taking into account the references to the drug, like the obliviousness to pain (\"if the police can't stop you *sounds of gunshots and police sirens* you must be on \u00abthe dust\u00bb\").\nThe station appears to have a gonzo sense of humor, as evident in several jingles; \"When all your buddies from the 70s have gone to rehab, we strongly encourage you to stay on; The Dust\", and in some of Smith's lines of dialogue, such as \"You can cry about the miscarriage or keep drinking, rock on.\" and \"For those of you coming to consciousness in a strange bed next to an ugly chick with beer cans and underwear across the floor, run the hell out and get to the clinic\" or even \"It's not every day you hear that record-- wait, yes it is. I love it.\", the latter being an apparent reference to the ever-looping songs of the in-game radios.\nK-DST's host, Tommy \"The Nightmare\" Smith, is a washed-up former member of the fictional 1970s progressive rock act Crystal Ship. He holds misogynistic views and thinks highly of himself and his music. He frequently gets lost in random musings when he voices his opinions. Three callers call into the station, and all of them criticise Smith for his DJ skills (\"No-one understands what the hell you're saying\"), and his seemingly underwhelming music career (\"My God you were crap, you really sucked\"), causing Smith to angrily insult them.\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\nRadio Station.\nThe station plays at the following locations:"}

They also think of themselves as \"pilgrims sent from the east bringing a message to the west\".\nThe two hosts, Marshall Peters and Johnny Lawton, speak in thick &lt;a href=\"Jamaica\"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt;n accents, something that can make them hard to understand to players not familiar with the Jamaican dialect. They smoke a lot on air.\nThey seem to be \"vitriolic best buds\" as they occasionally bicker on air; through their conversations it is revealed Johnny convinced Marshall to get the pair to move to the west coast to get their music heard on a wider audience; however, Marshall soon found out that the real reason why Johnny wanted to come to San Andreas was to be an actor, and even took acting lessons. This is a recurrent in their dialogue as Marshall frequently taunts Johnny for wanting to become an actor, calling him \"Mr. &lt;a href=\"Vinewood\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt;\" and even telling him \"he's no rasta\". Johnny replies that Marshall \"won't be fighting for revolution if the only thing he does is sitting in the ground, smoking and not making any music\". Johnny took acting so seriously that he even went to the extent of quitting smoking, but Marshall soon makes him return to the habit. Although Johnny wants to be more widely known, he still loves reggae, as he says \"so you want to be a rudeboy? you don't get it on &lt;a href=\"CSR%20103.9\"&gt;CSR&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThey criticize the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; for going to war with each other, and because crack is an \"inferior\" drug. They also comment about the supposed lights in the desert, which they claim were actually because everyone was \"just high\".\nDJ Gringo and Pat McKay are also featured on this station as the imaging voices.\nThis station is a West Coast counterpart to the other &lt;a href=\"K-JAH\"&gt;K-JAH&lt;/a&gt; station in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; that is featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;GTA III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\", which is referenced in their station ident, which says \"the best in reggae from Kingston, Brixton and Liberty City all the way to &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDeleted Songs.\nThe following songs were requested and approved to be in the game; however, they didn't make the cut for unknown reasons:"}

It is hosted by &lt;a href=\"Bomba%20Tomba\"&gt;Bomba Tomba&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prodo\"&gt;Prodo&lt;/a&gt;, and only broadcasts throughout the &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20District\"&gt;Industrial District&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Anywhere%20City\"&gt;Anywhere City&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to its owner and co-host, Bomba Tomba, \"KGBH plays best black market radio\", but it is actually heard throughout his broadcast that KGBH is a poorly equipped station that relies on a single tape machine to play music. As a result, it has recurrent technical problems that often interfere with its broadcasts, much to Bomba Tomba's annoyance. \nWhen working the station's poor equipment, Bomba Tomba can be heard getting angry quite often, which is likely a result of his heavy-drinking habit. Bomba Tomba has also been heard to threaten Prodo on air. Another issue likely brought on by his drinking habit is his poor organisational skills, which is oftentimes evidenced by him misplacing things, such as his truck and a special music tape that he had planned to play for his wife. \nDuring the introduction of \"Dazed &amp; Confuzed\", Bomba Tomba claims he's playing a song from an \"all chicks\" band called \"Nipples In Chains\", when in reality, he's playing the aforementioned track from \"Spangly Feet\". This suggests that he sometimes doesn't know what song he's playing, further evidencing his poor organisation skills.\nLike &lt;a href=\"KREZ\"&gt;KREZ&lt;/a&gt;, this radio has no commercials during its runtime; however, it is suggested that Bomba Tomba has played advertisements in past airings.\nThe station's name is likely a portmanteau of the Soviet and grievous bodily harm (). One of its slogans is 'where the big noise is'. \"&lt;a href=\"Grievous%20Bodily%20Harm\"&gt;Grievous Bodily Harm&lt;/a&gt;\" is also the former title of \"Grand Theft Auto 2\" prior to being rebranded as a sequel. It's also possible that the station is a reference to , a mysterious Russian shortwave station that only broadcasts a repeating buzzing tone, and, like KGBH, frequently encounters technical problems due to poor equipment."}

The headlamps seem to be derived from the BMW E30 (E32, E34).\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Kalahari is depicted as a small truck with a lightweight bodywork, where the front end features a small extender/sump guard on the lower side, as well as a small bumper with the license plate on the centre. The upper area is occupied by a black central grille, which extends towards the bumper area and has a wider horizontal separation, while the outer edges are occupied by inset panels that house twin circular headlamps on the front end and rectangular amber lights on the front quarters. The bonnet is relatively tall and bears silver \"CANIS\" lettering on the front and the manufacturer emblem on the upper side.\nThe sides of the car are relatively simple, featuring flared arches and various horizontal details running across the car, with a dedicated section for the doors. A set of square-shaped mirrors can be seen on either side of the windscreen base, while the area behind the cabin is occupied by a small bed, whose upper surfaces use the same details as on the sides.\nThe rear end features a set of circular tail lamps that are similar to the ones from the &lt;a href=\"Mesa%20Grande\"&gt;Mesa&lt;/a&gt;, while the central tailgate bears the silver \"CANIS\" lettering on the left, the manufacturer emblem on the right and the license plate on the centre. A small black exhaust is seen on the lower side.\nIn the original versions of the game, the Kalahari has a beige/light brown dashboard with black seats. In the enhanced version of the game, however, the Kalahari receives a full beige-colored interior shared with the &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;, albeit cleaner in appearance.\nThe vehicle may spawn either with an open top or with a set of extra pillars behind the cabin area and black frames above the cabin and truck bed. The same supports may also have either a black soft top or a black soft top with enclosed bed and rear windows, resulting in four different variations. The vehicle only has access to a single colour applied on the body and uses a set of white plain rims with four bolt details around, wrapped in medium-profile tyres with narrow track width.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Kalahari performs quite well, having a nice top speed and acceleration, it also fairs well off road. While this vehicle has good acceleration, its top speed is not up to par when it comes to competing against other faster vehicles. Furthermore, its thin tire profiles makes it less desirable for off-roading purposes. The Kalahari is great for doing stunt jumps as its incredibly light weight allows it to travel great distances in the air. It is also very nimble due to its size and thin tires.\nThe car is powered by a modeled turbocharged Inline-4, coupled with a 4-speed gearbox in a front engine, all wheel drive layout. Its engine sound is rather unique, somewhat resembling the ones from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Jackal\"&gt;Jackal&lt;/a&gt; and the modern &lt;a href=\"Interceptor\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, with slight similarities to the ones from vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Bagger\"&gt;Bagger&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Rod%20Blazer\"&gt;Hot Rod Blazer&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpecial Variants.\nIn the enhanced version, pre-modified Kalaharis may spawn in beach areas, like the &lt;a href=\"Bifta\"&gt;Bifta&lt;/a&gt;. They usually spawn with accesories intended for off-roading, including custom off-road tyres. Aside from the color schemes, at least one example has a unique customization set, including a spare tyre on the hood."}

The front fascia is reminiscent of the , with the front bumper from the . Additionally, the rear fascia and the bed seem to be influenced by the .\nDesign.\nThe Kamacho assumes a robust design and an utilitarian appearance, where the front end is dominated by a bulky utility bumper with a protective frame above, which houses a towing winch, a license plate and two circular high-beam lights around the central area, while the outer sections bear black triangular sections with small hooks and mesh intakes. The upper area assumes a slanted shape and bears a black strip on the lowermost edge, a black grille with silver \"CANIS\" lettering embossed on the center and two unusable LED lights, while the outer sections house circular main lights and rectangular lights below, split between inner high-beam units and outer turn signals. The hood assumes an elevated profile around the center and has two safety latches/catches.\nThe sides of the vehicle are denoted by the bulky arches and the impressed areas around the middle, which span the whole lenght of the vehicle. The wheelbase area mounts black tubular side steps for access, while the cabin uses square-shaped frameless doors with black vertical handles and two black rear-view mirrors on the frontal doors. The cabin area mostly consists of a soft top similar to the &lt;a href=\"Mesa%20Grande\"&gt;Mesa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;, fitted with a floodlight bar similar to the &lt;a href=\"Riata\"&gt;Riata&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barrage\"&gt;Barrage&lt;/a&gt;. A small bed can be seen on the back.\nThe rear end of the vehicle features a wide tailgate with \"CANIS\" embossed on it, while the rear quarters house a set of square tail lights, separated between the upper main/brake units and the lower turn signals. The rear bumper has similar features to the frontal one, being the central winch and the outer hooks with triangular intakes on the edges. However, the sections beside the winch opening house rectangular reverse lights, while the license plate is mounted on the passenger side, over the rear right vent. Two slanted exhausts can be seen beneath the hooks, while the underside has large sump guards on both ends, as expected from a vehicle of its type. The vehicle reuses the interior and dial set from various SUVs, namely the &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Baller\"&gt;Baller&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"BeeJay%20XL\"&gt;BeeJay XL&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe primary color of the vehicle is applied to the bodywork and engine's cam covers, while the secondary color is applied on the fenders and bumpers. Its stock wheels share the same rim design as the &lt;a href=\"Dubsta%206x6\"&gt;Dubsta 6x6&lt;/a&gt;, the off-road variant of the &lt;a href=\"Mesa%20Grande\"&gt;Mesa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sandking%20XL\"&gt;Sandking XL&lt;/a&gt;, sharing the rim design with the \"Six Gun\" muscle wheels available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops (although the tires retain the old tread pattern). The rims can also support a dedicated color, although naturally-generated examples may have one.\nPerformance.\nThe Kamacho is an adept off roader, with high torque and ground clearance, giving it immense capability offroad. It is capable of tackling even the roughest terrain, with 50/50 torque distribution, giving it an advantage on uneven terrain. Durability is good and can be further improved with the addition of bullbars.\nThe Kamacho has great top speed and acceleration compared to vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Riata\"&gt;Riata&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dubsta%206x6\"&gt;Dubsta 6x6&lt;/a&gt;, as well as good handling, with no signs of fishtailing. Its steering is relatively heavy due to its weight and length, though it can still manage turns easily.\nThe vehicle is powered by a single-cam 5.7L V8 engine with two air filters on it, powering all four wheels through a 5-speed gearbox. It shares the same engine sound from vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Granger\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt; and the Dubsta 6x6.\nInstalling any \"Roll Cage\" modification will increase its traction slightly, in the same way as spoilers."}

The front bumper was taken from the , while the hubcaps were modeled after the ones used on the 1992\u20131997 models. The size of the headlights, as well as the shape and light setup, are an amalgamation of those from the fifth-generation Civic and , while the C-pillar is taken from the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe front end of the car is relatively simple, featuring a black/plastic extender at the bottom of the bumper, followed by a central mesh grille/intake that spans about two-thirds of the car's width and small intakes beside it, being also slightly shorter in height than the grille. On the upper area, the car makes use of large headlamps, consisting of the main units on the inner side and the indicators on the outer side, while the bonnet has distinctive formations starting from the inner edges of the headlamps and run towards the windscreen, black details above and the Dinka emblem on the front. Depending of the front bumper option, the car can have functional fog lamps.\nThe sides of the car feature slightly flared arches and black side skirts, along with plastic panels running through the doors and painted handles. The cabin area also features black trim around the windows, black separations for the rear-quarter windows and painted mirror shells, while the roof area features additional black trim on either side, a small antenna pod on the upper front edge of the left roof line and a glass sunroof over the driver and passenger seats. A small boot lid can be seen on the rear.\nThe rear end of the car has the Dinka emblem and a number plate on the centre of the boot lid, while the outer sections house wide tail lamps, with the outer ones being upper main units and lower indicators, and the inner ones being upper brake and lower reverse units. The bumper assumes a relatively simple shape and also has a black/plastic extender, while the exhaust tube can be seen below, on the driver side. Its interior and dial set are derived from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Schwartzer\"&gt;Schwartzer&lt;/a&gt;, and bears the Dinka emblem on the horn cap.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary one is applied on the engine bay and the interior stitching. A trim colour is also available, which seems to be only applied to the custom \"Seats\" options. It uses a set of large rims with four bolt details around the center and eight spokes around, wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Kanjo SJ is powered by a 4-cylinder engine laid transversely, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout. It shares the same engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Kanjo\"&gt;Blista Kanjo&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Brioso%20300\"&gt;Brioso 300&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with a lower pitch.\nThe handling is quite nippy for a FWD vehicle, but acceleration and speed are below average for the class, beaten by most other coupes. Even when turning hard, the possibility of spinning out is nonexistent. It has bouts of wheelspin when taking off, poor durability, and its bodywork can detach very easily in an event of a rollover or hard collision.\nEvents.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kanjo%20SJ\"&gt;Kanjo SJ&lt;/a&gt; has been featured in the following events:\nChange History.\nReleased in ."}

She claims to have been raised in the Midwest and was apparently coerced by the &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper%20Company\"&gt;United Liberty Paper Company&lt;/a&gt; into becoming an agent for them, so she may have past criminal connections herself. This notion is made more likely to be true by a statement made by the &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper%20Contact\"&gt;United Liberty Paper Contact&lt;/a&gt;, who said that in exchange for working for them, they would 'give her her life back', suggesting that she had something to hide, possibly a criminal past. Even though her job requires her to deceive those around her and keep a certain level of emotional detachment, she appeared to genuinely care about Niko, and seemed remorseful for betraying him, further suggesting she was coerced into her job.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nNiko's first encounter with Karen (then known as Michelle) is during the mission &lt;a href=\"Three%27s%20a%20Crowd\"&gt;Three's a Crowd&lt;/a&gt; where Niko has to pick her and &lt;a href=\"Mallorie%20Bardas\"&gt;Mallorie Bardas&lt;/a&gt; up from the subway station and take them back to Karen's apartment in &lt;a href=\"Rotterdam%20Hill\"&gt;Rotterdam Hill&lt;/a&gt;. During the car ride, Mallorie suggests that she and Niko go out. Karen tells Niko that he's \"the kind of guy she wants to get to know.\" After this encounter, the mission &lt;a href=\"First%20Date%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;First Date&lt;/a&gt; will unlock. After the first date, Niko can take her on a number of dates there after until the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Snow%20Storm\"&gt;The Snow Storm&lt;/a&gt; is completed, where she will confess to Niko that she has been watching him and working for the government.\nSometimes if Niko asks her to come in for a coffee, she will make references to the &lt;a href=\"Modifications/Hot%20Coffee\"&gt;Hot Coffee&lt;/a&gt; controversy. For example, in one instance if Niko asks to come in for coffee, she will say that \"would cost almost $20,000,000\" This is a reference to the total amount that Rockstar Games agreed to pay in settlements for various lawsuits caused by the Hot Coffee Mod in .\nAfter revealing her identity, she confiscates &lt;a href=\"Elizabeta%20Torres\"&gt;Elizabeta's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cocaine\"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt;, and naturally, she and Niko break up.\nAfter she takes Niko to the &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper%20contact\"&gt;United Liberty Paper contact&lt;/a&gt;'s office, she is never seen again for the rest of the game. However, the United Liberty Paper Company's answering machine's voice sounds as if it was recorded by Karen. \nDuring a &lt;a href=\"Portrait%20of%20a%20Killer\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; for ULPC, Niko asked what Karen's reward for bringing in Niko was, to which he replies \"We gave her life back\", once again hinting towards a previous criminal affiliation.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nFive years after the events of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", it is revealed that Karen is now a high-ranked &lt;a href=\"IAA\"&gt;IAA&lt;/a&gt; agent. She appears during &lt;a href=\"The%20Humane%20Labs%20Raid\"&gt;The Humane Labs Raid&lt;/a&gt; first set-up mission, where players are tasked to meet up with Karen in order to &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Raid%20-%20Key%20Codes\"&gt;receive access codes to the facility&lt;/a&gt;. Karen asks if the protagonist's heist crew were involved with &lt;a href=\"The%20Fleeca%20Job\"&gt;The Fleeca Job&lt;/a&gt; and warns them what they're getting into now is a \"whole different ball game\". After receiving confirmation from the IAA that the crew is legitimate, she prepares to hand the code to the crew leader, but when she puts down the briefcase containing the access code, an &lt;a href=\"FIB\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; team ambushes the meeting and kills her bodyguard. Karen immediately runs off while the crew covers her escape by killing the FIB agents.\nShe is later seen at the end of the heist finale, where she talks about how the IAA can get anyone to do their dirty work by paying them. She then hands one of the crew members a &lt;a href=\"Grenade\"&gt;Grenade&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; and then leaves the area.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nShe is seen in the mission &lt;a href=\"Three%27s%20Company\"&gt;Three's Company&lt;/a&gt;, where she tortures &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20K\"&gt;Mr. K&lt;/a&gt; by attacking both his hands with a &lt;a href=\"flashlight\"&gt;flashlight&lt;/a&gt; and then threatens to sodomise him with it. However, before she can carry out her threat, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; interrupts the torture session by smashing through the office window as part of an FIB rescue operation. Michael and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, who was stationed in a nearby building with a &lt;a href=\"sniper%20rifle\"&gt;sniper rifle&lt;/a&gt;, start opening fire on the agents, but Karen manages to escape unharmed and calls for back-up. Nevertheless, Michael gets away with the prisoner and she is not seen again for the rest of the main storyline.\nIn what must be a continuity error on the part of Rockstar Games, her IAA identity card is signed with the name \"Michelle ABC\" instead of her real name, \"Karen\".\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nEvery single encounter that Niko has with \"Michelle\" has a hint that she is trying to gain information from him. She will always ask Niko if he is seeing or involved with someone dangerous, will constantly say that she is a good listener and that Niko can tell her anything he wants. When Niko takes her to a bar, he will even mention while drunk, that he saw her putting something in his drink. Sometimes, after a random date with her, Niko, will say that \"There is something strange about her\", showing that Niko is suspicious about her behavior.\nAfter disclosing her true identity, it is revealed that Karen is a smoker. She is not seen drinking alcohol, though it is unknown if this is related to her job or as a lifestyle choice.\nShe is an excellent &lt;a href=\"pool\"&gt;pool&lt;/a&gt; player; capable of pocketing 3\u20135 balls in a row, and rarely makes mistakes, even though she may comment she hasn't played pool for ages.\nHer favorite radio station is &lt;a href=\"Vladivostok%20FM\"&gt;Vladivostok FM&lt;/a&gt;, although this may be a ruse to appear more compatible with her target(s).\nDespite her intentions, it appears as though Karen genuinely fell for Niko during their time together. This is due to the fact that she is sometimes surprised, upset and genuinely happy when talking to Niko, and after a fair amount of dates, Niko doesn't have to ask to be invited inside. She is also visibly hurt when she is forced to betray him, and upset when Niko calls her a \"fucking bitch.\" After this, she is seen outside the United Liberty Paper building in &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; smoking a cigarette. She apologizes to Niko for lying to him and says that he is a \"\"nice guy\" who is \"better than the creeps [she] normally date[s]\"\", indicating that she took a liking to Niko even though she was only supposed to spy on him.\nIn her appearances in \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\", she is portrayed as an efficient, more ruthless government agent.\nAppearance.\nBetween Karen's appearances, her eye color changes from brown in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" to blue in \"Grand Theft Auto V\", possibly due to contacts.\nInfluence.\nKaren is possibly based on the character from the TV series \"\"."}

As the vehicle is not intended for use on main roads, it lacks any form of dials, although a radio is still available.\nThe Kart can spawn with additional matching side skirts and a small fairing over the steering wheel frame, and may spawn with a variety of primary colors applied on the tubular chassis. It uses small wheels fitted with racing slicks.\nPerformance.\nThe Kart has average speed, good acceleration and good off-roading. It is compact and capable of making sharp turns, although it can oversteer. Its low profile and light weight makes ordinarily small obstacles more dangerous.\nThe Kart is classed as a car, like the &lt;a href=\"Mower\"&gt;Mower&lt;/a&gt;, so CJ does not fall out of his seat when the vehicle flips over, additionally, the player cannot shoot forward from the Kart, despite having a clear view of doing so. The Kart is also able to drive under other vehicles with high ground clearance such as the &lt;a href=\"Petrol%20Truck\"&gt;Tanker trailer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Truck\"&gt;Monster Truck&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Kart is powered by a 2-stroke engine, judging by the engine size, which is apparently coupled to a 4-speed gearbox in a rear engine, rear wheel drive configuration. The engine sound is rather noisy because it is mounted open-air, like a motorcycle engine.\nLocations.\nThe Kart only spawns at specific areas in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; after the mission \"&lt;a href=\"Cut%20Throat%20Business\"&gt;Cut Throat Business&lt;/a&gt;\".

She works at the community center in &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to Packie, Kate witnessed several bloody fights between her brothers; seeing Gerry beating Francis was a traumatic childhood experience for her (she was in therapy for quite a while). Over time, she has apparently become accustomed to living close to violent crime, liking Niko despite her disapproval of his dangerous lifestyle. In contrast to all his sons, Mr. McReary had an excellent relationship with Kate and was pretty much never angry at her.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nKate McReary is first introduced to &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; when he meets her through her brother Packie during the mission &lt;a href=\"Harboring%20a%20Grudge\"&gt;Harboring a Grudge&lt;/a&gt;. Niko visits the &lt;a href=\"McReary%20Residence\"&gt;McReary family home&lt;/a&gt;, where he encounters Kate, who stands out due to her disapproval of the criminal activities surrounding her family. This meeting marks the beginning of Kate's involvement in Niko's life.\nThroughout the game, Kate's role primarily revolves around her interactions with Niko outside the main storyline. After their introduction, Niko can take Kate out on dates, participating in various activities such as dining or attending shows. These dates allow the player to explore Kate's character further and develop a deeper connection between her and Niko. Her conversations provide insight into her perspective on life and Niko's choices, enriching the game's narrative.\nKate's most significant involvement comes during the game's final missions, where her fate is determined by the player's choices. These critical moments underscore the emotional weight of Niko's decisions and Kate's influence on his journey.\nEndings.\nKate's ultimate fate depends on Niko's decision to either do the deal or exact revenge.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nDeal=\nIf \"Deal\" is chosen, Kate is mad at Niko for making a deal with Dimitri when she told him not to, and doesn't attend the wedding as a result. After Niko kills &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri&lt;/a&gt; to avenge &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; (who was accidentally killed by &lt;a href=\"Wedding%20Assassin\"&gt;Dimitri's hitman&lt;/a&gt;), Kate calls him, telling him that she heard of his cousin's death, and will be there for him. After few-in-game days Kate will call Niko and tell him that she is going away, she will say that she doesn't want to bring children in the world to be raised without a father and after a few in game hours she will send Niko an email.\nRevenge=\nIf \"Revenge\" is chosen, Kate is happy that Niko decided to kill Dimitri rather than do the deal. She attends Roman's and &lt;a href=\"Mallorie%20Bardas\"&gt;Mallorie&lt;/a&gt;'s wedding with Niko. During the wedding, Kate is accidentally killed by &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Pegorino\"&gt;Jimmy Pegorino&lt;/a&gt; (who was aiming for Niko) and Niko takes revenge on Pegorino for Kate's death. Later, after Niko has killed Pegorino, Roman says that he and Mallorie are expecting a baby, and if it's a girl, she will be named after Kate.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nCharacter.\nAppearance.\nKate has three kinds of outfits:\nIn Harboring a Grudge, &lt;a href=\"Waste%20Not%20Want%20Knots\"&gt;Waste Not Want Knots&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"I%20Need%20Your%20Clothes%2C%20Your%20Boots%2C%20and%20Your%20Motorcycle\"&gt;I Need Your Clothes, Your Boots, and Your Motorcycle&lt;/a&gt;, she wears a white sweater and a black shirt with denim jeans.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20and%20Mrs.%20Bellic\"&gt;Mr. and Mrs. Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, she wears a green sweatshirt and a multi-coloured shirt with black trousers.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Undertaker\"&gt;Undertaker&lt;/a&gt; and while dating, she wears a black sweatshirt with a black shirt (or somewhat dark green) and black trousers.\nDating Preferences.\nKate is a bit more complicated to date than the other girlfriends. She prefers Niko to wear clothing from &lt;a href=\"Modo\"&gt;Modo&lt;/a&gt;. Her activities are also limited as well, seeing as how she does not like to go &lt;a href=\"bowling\"&gt;bowling&lt;/a&gt;, or see a show at either &lt;a href=\"Perestroika\"&gt;Perestroika&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Split%20Sides\"&gt;Split Sides&lt;/a&gt;. As stated before, no matter how many times the player tries the \"try your luck\" option at the end of a date, the player will never be invited inside because she only considers Niko to be a friend. Kate does not like fast food as she will respond with negative comments such as \"Fast food? Great, a heart attack!\"\nKate's conversations with Niko, after getting her drunk, will eventually reveal that she knew that her father was molesting her brothers. She doesn't explicitly state that her father was a child molester but she does cry that she knew what he was doing to her brothers. One may deduce at first that she knew their father was beating the boys however, once Packie reveals that their father molested both him and Gerry one can conclude she knew her father was molesting her brothers, but kept quiet since her father did not molest her. She thinks her brothers' bad and illegal behaviors are a means to rebel against their father.\nUnlike some other girlfriends, Kate does not have a special ability which can be unlocked. She sleeps from midnight until 8AM.\nMission Appearances.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\n&lt;a href=\"Endings%20in%20GTA%20IV%23Deal\"&gt;Deal&lt;/a&gt; Ending\n&lt;a href=\"Endings%20in%20GTA%20IV%23Revenge\"&gt;Revenge&lt;/a&gt; Ending"}

Although she actually lives there, it is possible that she doesn't like her neighborhood. When Katie decides to do a driving date with Carl, awkwardly when starting (in front of her house), she will say that she doesn't like that place and sometimes says that she doesn't want to live there.\nShe is a nurse in an ER unit in an unnamed hospital. She has had the job for three years, as she says to Carl during dates. She likes to spend her spare time at the &lt;a href=\"Cobra%20Marital%20Arts%20Gym\"&gt;karate dojo&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Garcia\"&gt;Garcia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is possible to date Katie before the San Fierro area is unlocked; in fact, this can be done even before the first mission. However, it is recommended to go to San Fierro during midday hours as she's more likely to spawn then.\nPersonality.\nDuring random conversations while on a date, she mentions that she's a fan of the rapper &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg\"&gt;Madd Dogg&lt;/a&gt;, dislikes &lt;a href=\"OG%20Loc\"&gt;OG Loc&lt;/a&gt; (\"OG Joke is more like it\") and is disturbed by the &lt;a href=\"Epsilon%20Program%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Epsilon Program&lt;/a&gt; \"nutjobs\". She's also fascinated by death and injuries since she loves car accidents and reckless driving, and even asks Carl if he likes to lose a limb, indicating she has and/or . Some of her dialogue implies that her fascination with death even borders on the sexual (She mentions that working in the ER gives her a \"thrill\"), possibly explaining her arousal when CJ collides with other cars and implying that she has . However, she states that is too far even for her.\nDue to her health-conscious image, she likes to eat at diners but avoids fast-food outlets. Katie also likes the shoreline and her mood improves when the player drives by the area, especially by the &lt;a href=\"Gant%20Bridge\"&gt;Gant Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. However, she doesn't like the &lt;a href=\"Queens\"&gt;Queens&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood.\nDating.\nShe can initially be found at the northeast corner of &lt;a href=\"Avispa%20Country%20Club\"&gt;Avispa Country Club&lt;/a&gt; at the south end of the city, practicing tai chi behind some bushes. She can be seen easily from the road. Katie likes men with sex appeal and muscle.\nThere is a glitch which commonly occurs in the gameplay. If a player dates Katie in one game and starts a new game and does not date her, they can usually find after being wasted that their weapons are still with them.\nShe is usually at &lt;a href=\"Katie%20Zhan%27s%20House\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; between 12:00 and 00:00. The following are the possible dating styles when hanging out with her:\nFood Date.\nKatie has a preference for diners, with the nearest diner being the &lt;a href=\"Paradiso%20Diner%20Restaurant\"&gt;Paradiso Diner Restaurant&lt;/a&gt; next to the &lt;a href=\"Gant%20Bridge\"&gt;Gant Bridge&lt;/a&gt; information centre, which is conveniently close to her home. She does not enjoy going to the restaurant located in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20San%20Fierro\"&gt;Downtown&lt;/a&gt;.\nDance Date.\nDespite her dislike of the area, the &lt;a href=\"Gaydar%20Station\"&gt;Gaydar Station&lt;/a&gt; club is the closest dance club to take Katie to.\nDriving Date.\nKatie seems to prefer areas close to the shoreline, so options include driving around the area below the &lt;a href=\"Gant%20Bridge\"&gt;Gant Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jizzy%27s%20Pleasure%20Domes\"&gt;Jizzy's Pleasure Domes&lt;/a&gt; (including the latter's parking lot), or the &lt;a href=\"Bayside\"&gt;Bayside&lt;/a&gt; area across the bridge. She also loves being driven around in Chinatown. She prefers a moderate driving speed; although she will at times encourage Carl to drive faster, doing so makes her Fun meter drop, and on-screen text will inform the player that they are driving too fast.\nShe also appears to be aroused when Carl collides with anything, although this doesn't appear to affect either the Fun meter or Progress statistic. Steer clear of the &lt;a href=\"Queens\"&gt;Queens&lt;/a&gt; area during this date as she dislikes it. An alternative less time consuming way of passing this date, is to simply drive around Katie's housing block at a moderate speed and you will be sure to pass the date.\nCoffee.\nKatie will only invite Carl into her house for \"&lt;a href=\"Hot%20Coffee\"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt;\" when the date ends (arriving at her house) with a relationship over 52%."}

Here, your duty is to stay put and slaughter incoming enemies as they try to access your office safe. Several of Sonny's goons will attempt entry to the office, and it is your job to kill them before they get inside. A &lt;a href=\"Python\"&gt;Colt Python&lt;/a&gt; spawns in the office at the onset of this part of the mission, making this process easier. If you need to, step outside of your office to eliminate the men.

The best place to take cover is behind the office table using the crouch. Once about 20 men are down, &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Vance\"&gt;Lance Vance&lt;/a&gt; emerges from a hallway with many goons protecting him and teases &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy&lt;/a&gt; to follow him.\nNow it's time to kill Lance. He will enter on the second floor of the main hall, overlooking the main staircase and office door, wielding a &lt;a href=\"Kruger\"&gt;Kruger&lt;/a&gt; assault rifle. You and he will engage in a short conversation before he begins shooting at you. At this point, you need to chase Lance down the hallway leading to the interior staircase while he and numerous Forelli goons take shots at you. Upon reaching the interior staircase, Lance will head for the roof.\nWhen you reached the roof, don't start immediately shooting, if you want, take the &lt;a href=\"Adrenaline\"&gt;adrenaline&lt;/a&gt; pill but don't take cover in the explosive barrels!, take a heavy weapon and kill the Forellis and Lance Vance, remember that Lance is wearing armor. Tommy will yell, \"This is the last dance for Lance Vance!\" Lance replies, \"I said, I had enough of that at school!\" Once he is completely dead, Tommy will yell, \"You picked the wrong side, Lance...\". You maybe took damage, a &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; pickup is located in the runway from the heli-point. On the roof, you also have the option of taking out the Forellis' limos, ending the unlimited supply of gangsters. Before getting the principal roof and confront Sonny, go downstairs in the small alcove and take &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; and more ammo if you need.\nWhen you walk out of the office, Sonny will show up at the foot of the main staircase with two more guys, where he \"reminds\" you that your 15 years of incarceration were his to spend, before releasing his goons on you. Shoot Sonny as quickly as possible, as new Forelli soldatos will continue to stream into the main hall. Once Sonny is dead, the mission is over and in the ensuing &lt;a href=\"cutscene\"&gt;cutscene&lt;/a&gt;, Tommy replaces the now deceased Lance with &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Ken Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt; as his right hand man, explaining that this \"could be the beginning of a beautiful business relationship.\""}

The game keeps score of the number of bounces made (by generating a floating number counting the number of bounces over the player's head) until the ball touches the ground, ending the minigame.\nThe beach ball has physics similar to a balloon. After hitting the player, it bounces off, then pauses in mid-air and slowly falls straight down.\nDepending on the player's position in relation to the falling ball, the ball can bounce to a different direction, providing the player with a degree of challenge; the ball will also shoot higher to a capped height after repeated bounces. Players can keep track of the ball's position by observing the shadow of the ball, positioning their player character as best as possible under the ball's shadow.\nLocations.\nBeach balls used to trigger Keepie-Uppy's tend to be difficult to spot due to the small size of the balls. However, the balls are confined within specific invisible boundaries that prevent them from ending up out of bounds.\nThere are two beach balls with set spawn points, both in &lt;a href=\"Starfish%20Island\"&gt;Starfish Island&lt;/a&gt;:\nBeach balls randomly spawn along the beach in Vice City Beach.

In an interview, he said \"The only agreed direction was that we were basically writing a game that we would want to play ourselves. Everything had to be interactive. The player had to be able to drive any vehicle he could find. Nothing was to be off-limits. We wanted fun situations to present themselves just by all the elements coming together, not necessarily in ways that were specially designed.\"\nHamilton was also heavily involved in DMA Design securing a publishing deal with BMG Interactive - he starred as the fictional protagonist in a live-action short film based on what \"Grand Theft Auto\" would be about. In the same interview mentioned previously, Keith mentions that unfortunately the original version of the video was lost and he doesn't know if any copies exist.\nIn another interview, &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Farley\"&gt;Paul Farley&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow programmer at DMA Design, said that Hamilton was notorious for \"always stopping at traffic lights [in-game], much to everyone's amusement.\"\nOn October 21, &lt;a href=\"2022\"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;, speculation gripped the \"GTA\" community, as many believed that the day marked the 25th anniversary of the original \"Grand Theft Auto\" game's release, therefore also marking the start of the series. Former DMA Design music producer &lt;a href=\"Colin%20Anderson\"&gt;Colin Anderson&lt;/a&gt; tweeted later in the day, showing an email Keith Hamilton sent out to everyone at DMA Design on November 27, 1997. The email showed that Hamilton was inviting everyone at the studio out for drinks the following day, noting that \"GTA will finally be released tomorrow\". This email confirmed to the community that the actual release date of \"Grand Theft Auto\" on PC was in fact November 28, 1997.\nGallery.\nSteve Banks - \"Keith Rap\".\n\"Keith Rap\" by Steve Banks, featuring Keith Hamilton rapping.

He started working for the &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; at some point in &lt;a href=\"1978\"&gt;1978&lt;/a&gt;, aged 25. By 1984 his company has begun to represent the &lt;a href=\"VNN\"&gt;Vice News Network&lt;/a&gt; legally, with the company advising people, through a VNN news report, to quote the second amendment of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; constitution if they are prosecuted for illegally using a firearm, after open gun fights in the &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Downtown&lt;/a&gt; district (seen during the mission &lt;a href=\"Nice%20Package\"&gt;Nice Package&lt;/a&gt;). By &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt; he has also established ties with the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; based &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, an Italian-American mob, and has begun to represent them legally.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nIn 1986 he helps &lt;a href=\"Sonny%20Forelli\"&gt;Sonny Forelli&lt;/a&gt;, the suspected &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Leaders\"&gt;Don&lt;/a&gt; of the Family, in establishing his family in Vice City by setting up a drug deal between the &lt;a href=\"Vance%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Vance Crime Family's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;Victor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Vance\"&gt;Lance Vance&lt;/a&gt; and Forelli Family representatives &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harry\"&gt;Harry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lee\"&gt;Lee&lt;/a&gt;. The deal was ambushed but Rosenberg and Vercetti escaped, with Rosenberg hiding in his office, even missing &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Cortez\"&gt;Colonel Juan Cortez&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Party\"&gt;yacht party&lt;/a&gt;, instead sending Vercetti to meet the man who set up the deal and later to &lt;a href=\"Back%20Alley%20Brawl\"&gt;find out&lt;/a&gt; who ambushed the deal. Rosenberg had, before the ambushed drug deal, been representing &lt;a href=\"Giorgio%20Forelli\"&gt;Giorgio Forelli&lt;/a&gt;, who was facing charges of fraud, and sent Vercetti to &lt;a href=\"Jury%20Fury\"&gt;intimidate&lt;/a&gt; two jurors. He had also begun representing real estate mogul &lt;a href=\"Avery%20Carrington\"&gt;Avery Carrington&lt;/a&gt;, who Vercetti later began to work for after causing a &lt;a href=\"Riot%20%28GTA%20Vice%20City%29\"&gt;riot&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Spand%20Express\"&gt;Spand Express&lt;/a&gt; depot.\nVercetti eventually stops working for Rosenberg, who begins to represent him and bailing him from the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City Police Department&lt;/a&gt; police stations across the city, with Rosenberg later attempting to give Vercetti advice about earning more money and about a planned &lt;a href=\"The%20Job\"&gt;bank heist&lt;/a&gt;. He later sides with Vercetti when Sonny Forelli arrives in Vice City and, along with Lance Vance, a former ally of Vercetti, &lt;a href=\"Keep%20Your%20Friends%20Close...\"&gt;attempt to take over Vercetti's business empire&lt;/a&gt;. The two become close friends, although Rosenberg's &lt;a href=\"cocaine\"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt; addiction later drives a wedge between the two.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nTommy Vercetti and Ken Rosenberg continue to drift apart in the early 1990s, with Rosenberg eventually entering rehabilitation at the &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Carson%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;Fort Carson Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Carson\"&gt;Fort Carson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;. His rehabilitation was successful, but his friendship with Vercetti is irreparably damaged, and he is also disbarred as a lawyer. Rosenberg, however, immediately falls into the clutches to Liberty City's three mafia families, the &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Sindacco Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, who have him run &lt;a href=\"Caligula%27s%20Casino\"&gt;Caligula's Casino&lt;/a&gt;, a mafia run casino in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;, with all three families having a stake in the casino.\nRosenberg is informed by &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore Leone&lt;/a&gt;, Don of the Leone Family, that he wants his money back quickly, whilst he expectantly waits for one family to kill him and blame one of the other families. Rosenberg begins to hide in his office once again, with only &lt;a href=\"Tony\"&gt;Tony&lt;/a&gt;, a talking parrot, for company. &lt;a href=\"Kent%20Paul\"&gt;Kent Paul&lt;/a&gt; and his client &lt;a href=\"Maccer\"&gt;Maccer&lt;/a&gt; later &lt;a href=\"Don%20Peyote\"&gt;find&lt;/a&gt; Rosenberg and introduce him to &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, who begins to help Rosenberg out of his situation, including &lt;a href=\"Intensive%20Care\"&gt;saving&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Sindacco\"&gt;Johnny Sindacco&lt;/a&gt; on his way to the &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20Hospital\"&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt;, though Johnny later &lt;a href=\"The%20Meat%20Business\"&gt;dies&lt;/a&gt; of a heart attack after he remembers his &lt;a href=\"Fender%20Ketchup\"&gt;previous encounter&lt;/a&gt; with Carl.\nCarl later works for both Rosenberg and Salvatore Leone to kill more Sindacco and Forelli Family mobsters, both in &lt;a href=\"Freefall\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Mark%27s%20Bistro\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually Carl helps Rosenberg, as well as the by now trapped Kent Paul and Maccer, to escape from Salvatore Leone, telling them to lie low. Rosenberg, who began to use cocaine, also seemingly has flashbacks, once stating \"Just like old times, hey Tommy?\", in reference to Tommy Vercetti, leading Carl to question, \"Who the fuck is Tommy?\"\nRosenberg and Kent Paul later begin to work for &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg\"&gt;Madd Dogg&lt;/a&gt;, a rapper who is being managed by Carl Johnson. He, Kent Paul, Maccer and Madd Dogg later &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;appear&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Johnson%20House\"&gt;Johnson House&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ganton\"&gt;Ganton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, to announce their first gold record.\nCharacter.\nInfluence.\nRosenberg is undoubtedly heavily influenced by 's character Dave Kleinfeld from the &lt;a href=\"1993\"&gt;1993&lt;/a&gt; movie \"\". Both worked as lawyers, helped the protagonists, were heavily addicted to cocaine and both did something that made the protagonist sever their ties with them (in Kleinfeld's case, he was going to testify against Carlito and Tommy severed his ties with Rosenberg because of his drug addiction). The interior of Rosenberg's office in Vice City is also remarkably similar to Dave Klenfield's office.\n\"Busted!\" Quotes.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", during the blank screen after being &lt;a href=\"busted\"&gt;busted&lt;/a&gt; before the player respawns outside the police station, the player can occasionally hear Ken Rosenberg talking over the phone with the police in an attempt to get &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt; released, using a variety of conjecture, insults and even threats to get his way.

Their mother is &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Johnson\"&gt;Beverly Johnson&lt;/a&gt; (who dies just before the game begins). She is also &lt;a href=\"Cesar%20Vialpando\"&gt;Cesar Vialpando&lt;/a&gt;'s girlfriend, and therefore affiliated with both Cesar's &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Varrios Los Aztecas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nAfter learning about &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Ryder's&lt;/a&gt; betrayal, CJ requests that Cesar bring Kendl to safety by fleeing from &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. Later in the storyline, Cesar pondered proposing to Kendl but the question of whether Kendl accepted or not remains unanswered.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nKendl is depicted as intelligent and pragmatic which suggests that although her brothers turned to crime as a last resort to support themselves, Kendl could become successful within the bounds of the law which makes her the \"brains\" of CJ's business ventures. She possesses entrepreneurial talents, strong willpower, creativity, and a sense of leadership. In fact it was Kendl who came up with the idea of \"Letting &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; work for you\" and when CJ responded with, \"I ain't going to no college man\", she shot back that she will take care of it. She has little tolerance for whining or complaining or complacency which causes CJ and others to regard her as a bit bossy. This is exemplified in the mission &lt;a href=\"Zeroing%20In\"&gt;Zeroing In&lt;/a&gt;, when she discovers everyone sitting around playing poker and chastises them questioning if that was how they would build their business."}

His mother appears to be alive and well, and is living in Liberty City, enjoying what America has to offer. When Kenny first arrived, all his income came from shipping American cars back to Russia. After some time in America, he formed his own &lt;a href=\"Petrovic%20Family\"&gt;organization&lt;/a&gt; and he became one of the biggest Russian crime bosses in America, if not the biggest. In the meantime another &lt;a href=\"Faustin%20Family\"&gt;organization&lt;/a&gt; was created by &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Faustin\"&gt;Mikhail Faustin&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe two Russian Mafia organizations seemed at peace, but after &lt;a href=\"Mikhael%20Faustin\"&gt;Faustin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Final%20Destination\"&gt;sent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; to kill Kenny's son &lt;a href=\"Lenny%20Petrovic\"&gt;Lenny Petrovic&lt;/a&gt;, suspecting him to be a rat, Kenny wanted war with Faustin.

Petrovic was prepared for war, but Faustin's second-in-command &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt; wanted to make peace. This deal included Niko killing Faustin. Niko &lt;a href=\"The%20Master%20and%20the%20Molotov\"&gt;did so&lt;/a&gt; and Petrovic didn't eliminate the Faustin Family but instead made an alliance with them. Kenny has several mistresses and girlfriends behind his &lt;a href=\"Mrs.%20Petrovic\"&gt;wife's&lt;/a&gt; back. His goons are sent across the city to destroy &lt;a href=\"Vendors\"&gt;hot dog stands&lt;/a&gt; for his Kosher girlfriend and are forced to escort his mistresses to safe areas away from Petrovic's wife when she discovers his secret lover. He despises the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt;, sending a squad of his gangsters to raid a drug deal they made and sending a goon to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Arnold\"&gt;chapter leader's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;bike&lt;/a&gt;, Sexy Charlie.

After acquiring the Film Studios, Tommy receives a call from Kent Paul, in which Paul claims to have acted in pornographic films in England, and would like a role in one of Tommy's films.\nDuring the transmission of &lt;a href=\"Emotion%2098.3\"&gt;Emotion 98.3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fernando%20Martinez\"&gt;Fernando Martinez&lt;/a&gt; reveals that he hooked Kent Paul (\"little English kid called Paul or something\") with an ugly fat girl with \"the most beautiful eyes he ever saw\" in the Malibu Club. This paired with some cut scenes in some missions, proves that he really has problems hooking up with women in the club.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nKent Paul brought a new English band, the &lt;a href=\"Gurning%20Chimps\"&gt;Gurning Chimps&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to get them noticed, but then finds himself stranded in the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20County\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; with only &lt;a href=\"Maccer\"&gt;one member remaining&lt;/a&gt;. After being &lt;a href=\"Don%20Peyote\"&gt;rescued&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;CJ&lt;/a&gt;, he quickly heads to &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt; to meet his old acquaintance &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;\"Rosie\"&lt;/a&gt; (whom he knows from Vice City). Later, he starts producing for &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Madd Dogg&lt;/a&gt; after the rapper's career was back on track. Kent Paul is also affiliated with &lt;a href=\"The%20Truth\"&gt;The Truth&lt;/a&gt;, who he and Maccer were taking peyote with in the desert.\nPaul was later invited to come to Los Santos along with Rosenberg by CJ, as he required an accountant and sound engineer.\nDuring the mission &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Mark%27s%20Bistro\"&gt;Saint Mark's Bistro&lt;/a&gt;, he is seen driving a blue &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;.\nKent Paul's 80's Nostalgia Zone!\nAt some point before 2002, Paul apparently fell off the wagon with substance abuse. By 2002, he was in a halfway house as part of an after care programme. He started his Kent Paul's 80's Nostalgia Zone! website as part of his therapy and learned about HTML along the way. Kent Paul writing his website is, chronologically, his final role in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nKent Paul normally has a laid back personality. In some missions, however, such as &lt;a href=\"Death%20Row\"&gt;Death Row&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Psycho%20Killer\"&gt;Psycho Killer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Don%20Peyote\"&gt;Don Peyote&lt;/a&gt;, he goes into a panicked state because of the threatening tasks at hand, and because of Maccer's failed resistance to masturbate and do drugs he becomes rather annoyed.\nIn \"GTA Vice City\", Kent Paul appears to slightly resemble and is notably shorter than other pedestrians. In \"GTA San Andreas\" Kent Paul is taller with orange hair and is also notably thinner than in \"GTA Vice City\".\nKent Paul obviously had kicked his drug addiction (as reported by the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;VCPD police&lt;/a&gt; bulletin) by the time of \"GTA San Andreas\" since he got extremely angry at Maccer when he found out he laced his drinks (he hadn't kicked his drinking habit) with peyote.\nPaul may have experience with accounting, as &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Ken Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt; mentioned in a post-mission phone call that \"Paul is good with figures\"."}

The website was shut down on December 20, &lt;a href=\"2020\"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;, along with several other promotional websites, due to end of support for the Adobe Flash Player on December 31, 2020.\nWebsite.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nhome=\n&lt;br&gt;\nWELCOME\nI used to have a mullet, but I'm okay now.\nOctober 1, 2002\nHello, everybody. How are we all? Having a wonderful time of it?&lt;br&gt;Enjoying an amusing sojourn on the world-wide information super-highway web? I do hope so. You've stumbled across Kent Paul's 80's Nostalgia Zone, possibly the best site on the internet.\nJust to clarify, like the banner says, the name is Paul, but I'm from Kent. Rather than being called Kent, like some idiot septic with a brother named Troy or whatever. Currently, I am spending time at an after care programme, having recently left primary, but I will VERY soon be back on my feet and out in the big bad world causing some serious trouble once more. I know I appear to be unfeasibly cheerful this month - this is because my doctor, a certain Dr. Perkins, has said if I can manage to be cheerful and not create what he calls an aura of insecurity and rage and inadequacy about myself and not insult anyone at all or lie for a whole month, then I can walk. I ain't turning soft or nothing, but I got to get back on the streets. The thing about Perkins is he's not bad for a screw, but I've done a lot of bird, because I'm very dangerous, and I once beat up a blind man in Dungeness High Street in Kent (still, he deserved it, 'cause he was staring at my bird's chest and anyway, I imagine he ain't reading this.). The other thing about Perkins is he is an absolute wanker and a little bit of a perv. Keeps asking me if I have feelings for my mum! I love my mum, but not like that. The other thing about Perkins is his wife looks like a moose having a bad hair day.\nAnyways, I've done a lot of work on the memory banks this month.&lt;br&gt;Thinking about things. After all nostalgia's not what is was (I said this first) apart from where I'm concerned. But the 80's were definitely better than today. Look at the facts - I was on the top of my game. Now, I'm in a half way house. People knew how to dress - now they think wearing green smocks and straight jackets is the way to go, at least round my way. Back then, you knew what people was all about - money. Now, all people talk about is feelings and rubbish like that. All gets very confusing, whichever way you look at it.\nWhen I left Kent for Vice City, I was a nobody.&lt;br&gt;A snotty little kid with a cheeky grin and a nasty line in tracksuits. By the time I left, I'd made it real big. I was a player. How did this happen? It was inevitable. You take an acne ridden compulsive liar from the Medway towns and drop him anywhere in America and he will come up smelling of roses. I knew everyone. I discovered most of the &lt;a href=\"%23music\"&gt;bands&lt;/a&gt; popular in the 1980's, but never got the credit. You see, I wasn't too interested in contracts. I was all about the music. It was like a passion for me. That and birds and drugs. They was my passions. Very original I was, I invented all of that crap.\nWhat's more, is I just got sent &lt;a href=\"http%3A//web.archive.org/web/20071023062053/http%3A//www.degenatron.com/\"&gt;THIS LINK&lt;/a&gt; by some moron because I mentioned the Degenatron thing last month. The bloke who wrote me is a right mug, clearly, and looks like he hasn't had so much as a hand shandy since 1987, so we've got that it common, I guess. But, please, bear in mind, now I spend all my time on computers, 'cause there ain't nothing else to do apart from try to watch the nurses getting changed, but in the 80's, I was a bit more interested with giving it very large portions. \nTwo new cards\nSend Rollerskater Vice City Postcard\nSend Shopper Vice City Postcard\nSeptember 4, 2002&lt;br&gt;\nMy memories are priceless! Only I have to pay for them!&lt;br&gt;\nPopular from Dungeness to Missouri*\nQuite a poetical introduction, and that's because I'm in quite a poetical mood. Well, I have to be honest, first up, I've got to apologise to Mrs. Perkins. She's not a dog at all. She's really quite attractive if you like the larger lady, and I also have to admit I was joking when I said that I had had her. I never had her. In fact, right, I think her husband, the esteemed and caring Dr. Perkins is right when he says his wife has never been unfaithful to him during a successful 30 year marriage and they have raised five lovely children and that is exactly the kind of thing you can get too, if you play by the rules.\nOnly, let's be honest, playing by the rules was never Paulo's style. I was a player. Not a referee. Seriously, I'm sorry for any offence I caused and everything, but do me a favour? I mean, Paul, from Kent, aka Kent Paul. I was the main man back then and when I get back on my feet, I'll be the main man again, and not writing apologies to shrinks or their fat wives, who I definitely could have had. But, well, back to me.\nNot the best month for Paulo. Not too good at all, in fact. Got a bit of a knock back on this night club I was going to run. The 80's are back. You don't need me to tell you that, and I was going to be running this very fashionable little exclusive discotheque down in the Isle of Thanet, but the funding fell through. Stupid pillock. So, I've decided to spend an extra month in the after care. Face up to a few things. That demon grandiosity, Perkins calls it. I call it ambition, mate. The thing that made this country great. Gave us an empire. After all, we invented football, but we never win the bloody world cup, do we?\nSo, anyway, back to memories. I had a right funny hair cut back then. Looked like a proper pillock. But what you going to do? I don't make the rules, I only break them! And it seems you people are loving Kent Paul's Nostalgia Zone.\nA lot of people came here last month, and not just family. (Hi mum!) I even got a letter last week.\nFrom a certain JeffJohnson234@hotmail.com\n\"Dear Kent,\"\n\"I'm a big 80s fan. Loved your website. I live in Missouri. Where is Kent? We have a lot of corn here and we all drive cars. Do they have cars in Kent? Will you be my friend? I'm very lonely. I've got a big knife and I want to cut myself. I love goth music. And old televsion shows. Anyways, I was watching cable all last week, and I noticed you made a couple of errors. First - the family was called the Chesterfields, not the Dawkins. And then, you say the little kid was 35, but in fact he was 42. That's why he kept saying \"but I'm 42.\" Because he was. He didn't say \"I'm 35.\" I mean, I think he might have, but only when he was. Also, he was an investment banker not a bond trader as you have it on your website, which is wrong. I don't think you can really call yourself a fan of Five of Us. I've been to lots of conventions. And I still have a lunchbox. Please write back.\"\n\"Keep on trucking!\"\n\"Jeff.\"\nWell, thanks Jeff. You prat. First up, I'm called Paul. I'm from Kent, near London. Second's, I don't care. &lt;a href=\"%23tv%20shows\"&gt;That show&lt;/a&gt; was crap. Third's, no, you can't be my friend. Fourth's I hope you are in prison or something. Am I making myself clear? \nAs you can see, I'm the talk of the internet! Wonder how many people went to see &lt;a href=\"http%3A//web.archive.org/web/20080506112913/http%3A//www.darrenwebb.com/\"&gt;Darren's ponce site&lt;/a&gt;? Wonder how many debates he sparked up? Not many. For your information, Darren's doses have been upped and he's back in the padded cell. Revenge, I call it. Don't mess with the beast, as my old boy used to say. \nSo, anyway, I was remembering, right, how things was and stuff. And they were really pretty good. Had a lot of fun. I was in Vice City as a major player in the record business, working with all of the top acts as an uncredited executive producer and creative influence, but I fell in with the wrong crowd. Myself. Know what I mean? \nIn Vice City, we had the lot, nightclubs, muggers, psychos, lunatics, self help gurus, porno stars.\nBut maybe you know about that already. It was a fabulous place. Real smart and all that fancy architecture. But there was a nasty side. Some very dodgy characters. Villains I call them, although Perkins calls them sociopaths or people with low self-esteem and a lot of weaponry. Make your own mind up. Times were easier back then, because we all knew what was going on. Make a load of money. Use it to borrow a load more money. Buy a lot of really expensive stuff on the never never, then go bankrupt. A simple life, much better than this crap, Perkins. \nThis month's postcards.&lt;br&gt;\n2 more photos I found... If you're a real man, you only travel by helicopter.\nSend Rollerskater Vice City Postcard\nSend Rollerskater Vice City Postcard\nAugust 1, 2002&lt;br&gt;\nMore from the 80s as they really were&lt;br&gt;\nHa ha\u2014stick that in your pipe and smoke it.&lt;br&gt;\nThey said I had a five minute attention span, but they were wrong. Kent Paul is back with more of my exciting and amusing remin, remini, well, my memories of the 1980s. The decade of decadence. A time when entertainment wasn't watching a TV show or going to the movies*, but was manipulating a plastic cube until all of the colours were in the same place.\nWell, to those who enjoyed last month's website**, I can assure you it's only going to get a lot better. For starters, I'm getting the hang of this HTML lark, and for seconds, now that the tranquilizers have worn off, my memory is flooding back. Some of them ain't too happy, and all. But most of them are funny as anything. Especially for me.\nBut it's not just about me, it's also about the 1980s.&lt;br&gt;\nAnd that's what this site is all about. The 1980s and me. When I was in Vice City I showed the yanks a thing or two about being a geezer. A proper geezer from Kent, not some idiot from Essex. Down at the Malibu every night, I would hold court like a man with a court in his hand and I also knew lots of powerful people. Including some really nasty ones, because I'd be lying if I pretended I kept my nose entirely clean. That was never my style, I was too smart for that, even though it did all end up with me making a website for 13 people to enjoy while I do the loast of my time in my aftercare programme, which is great and everything and to be honest, all them times were about lies and the person I lied to most was myself and I really have to apologise to someone I care about a lot\u2014me, for wasting everything and throwing it all away and looking for the easy way out and so on and so forth, but well, I promise you, I knew a few people and had a right laugh, I can promise you that.\nAnyway, Vice City is still going strong, if you like beaches and inane half-wits and guys called Geraldo, but it ain't what it was. Centre of the known universe back then and a right laugh. From the Malibu to Prawn Island and back again. From fancy parties to even fancier hotels, I was everywhere and you tell me I'm making it up? You tell me I'm deceiving myself? You tell me I never amounted to nothing? I tell you to stick it, Doctor Perkins. I was a player. Not some pillock in a white coat handing out pills to a bunch of burnouts. You're a loser, mate. A loser and your wife is a dog. And I've had her.\nHere's 2 more postcards.&lt;br&gt;\nThe lot of you people seemed to like the last one, so I made more.\nSend Rollerskater Vice City Postcard\nSend Rollerskater Vice City Postcard\nJuly 1, 2002&lt;br&gt;\n\"Remembering the time when a dollar was a dollar, a song was a song and foreign policy meant invade first, ask questions later.\"\nI don't know about you, but I just love the 1980s.&lt;br&gt;\nAlways have done. Well, at least since 1990. And I don't think I'm alone. I mean, I am alone now, which is why I've got time to make this website as part of my therapy, but, well, isn't the internet great? That's one thing we didn't have back in the 80s. there's loads of other things we didn't have, too, like a sense of concern for our fellow man, or sports utility vehicles. But to find out more about that, you'll have to wait for my car section, which will come as soon as I figure out how to do the HTML. But seriously, if you'd told me that I'd learn how to use a computer. Well, in 1986 I didn't even know what a computer was. Or I did, but I thought computers were for squares. And they were, because if you were hip, you were in a club, like the Malibu. You weren't spending your time in an after care program, learning skills to suit you in the new economy. I mean, this is great and I'm really positive and everything, but, I'll be honest with you, things were better in the 80s. You knew where you were. It was a great time, a time when 'bribe' and 'corruption' and 'man made fibers' weren't dirty words. Great times. And great memories. Memories we can all share. Apart from really young people. Or dweebs! Or people who forget everything, like I tried to. Well, not forgotten and certainly not forgiven. That's what they told me in court and that's my message to you. We won't forget you and we won't forgive you, for making us all victims. Fashion victims!\nI was maybe the worst fashion victim in town,&lt;br&gt;\nand I was in a town full of them. Probably the most hip, happening and certainly hot place in the whole of the 1980s. Vice City. Oh, I know Vice City is still around today and having something a revival as corruption and depravity come back into fashion, but in the 80s it was something else. The place was on fire. Sometimes literally. When I first arrived there it was a thriving metropolis, and despite my best efforts, it still stands. I don't think I could ever claim to have been king of the city, (my therapist complains a lot about my grandiosity, whatever that means) but certainly I was the crown prince and for a while, I was also the court jester.\nAnyway, enough about me. And back to the 80s.&lt;br&gt;And tell all your friends about this site. If enough people visit, I'll win a prize from my guidance counselor.\nOh, and here's a little e-postcard that I just learned how to make.&lt;br&gt;Send it to your friends, if they're into this sort of thing.\nSend Rollerskater Vice City Postcard\n\"You are visitor number\"\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//web.archive.org/web/20020716133522/http%3A//www.rockstargames.com/esrb/\"&gt;ESRB PRIVACY ONLINE CERTIFIED PRIVACY STATEMENT&lt;/a&gt;\nwhat's new=\n&lt;br&gt;\nWHAT'S NEW\nA whole lot, actually.

I really don't care.\nI'm just about done with this website bollocks. Ever since all the porno sites started charging, it's a mug's game.\nmusic=\n&lt;br&gt;\nMUSIC\nWell, as Jezz Torrent once said, music is the food of love, or in my case a massively under-valued career as a record plugger. The 80s was the best period ever for music, at least in my life. I loved it. Great records. Hot girls. Me on every guest list from here to somewhere else (well, not from here, I wasn't in a frigging halfway house, and I can assure you the parties in here are rubbish, unless you like discussing childhood traumas with pillocks on tranquilisers, but from, well, Kent to Vice City, like me) and so on and so forth. I had the time of my life back then. Music, nightclubs, girls, so many flipping girls. More girls than I could count if I could only count to five. But above all music and that's what this section is all about: music.\nWell, not just any music, but my favourites, or as they say across the pond, favorites. Here's some of them.\nKool and the Gang: \"Summer Madness\"&lt;br&gt;What a record. What an intro. What a gang! Wonderful stuff. Reason I went into the music business, actually, and as a direct result, the reason the music business is where it is today.\nFlock of Seagulls: \"I Ran\"&lt;br&gt;And I tell you so did I, so far away, but that's another story and i can't be bothered to tell it. Flock of Seagulls were one of the first bands I took over to the States, when the new wave thing went really big. I never got the credit I deserved.\nJudas Priest: \"You Got Another Thing Coming\"&lt;br&gt;Rob and the boys knew a thing or two about rock music. People often used to say that to me as well, but they were usually wrong. A great track this one, and I was personally responsible for breaking Priest in America.\nCutting Crew: \"I Just Died in your Arms Tonight\"&lt;br&gt;Well, thankfully, I didn't, but these guys did. You have to love the Cutting Crew. Great lads. Great music. A real tear jerker at the end of the disco. Another track that I discovered and helped to make huge around the world. Again, the cruel hand of fate meant I didn't get the recognition I deserved, but a magic record.\nBlondie: \"Atomic\"&lt;br&gt;Possibly my favourite ever record about nuclear war. I used to know a woman sounded just like that Blondie bird.\nOf course, I like a lot of other records, too. But I liked these ones a lot, probably more than most.\ntimeline &amp; events=\n&lt;br&gt;\nTIMELINE &amp; EVENTS\n1979&lt;br&gt;\n- Margaret Thatcher is elected the first woman Prime Minister in Britain\u2019s history.

There was a good guy, an American or something, and a lot of bad guys, often from Eastern Europe or Vietnam or whatnot, and the good guy would go and kill loads of bad guys, and bring about peace using lots of weapons and killing anyone who didn't understand or couldn't sing the American anthem. How things change, hey?\nAnyway, probably my favourite film was \"Exploder\" with Jack Howitzer. It was the follow up to \"Evacuator\", which was rubbish, but I loved \"Exploder\".\nHowitzer played Tim, a vet with nothing left to prove who gets called into action and kills loads of foreigners for no apparent reason in Cambodia or Camden or somewhere. I remember there was loads of body bags and a big knife with a toothpick. Can't remember much else.\nAlso very popular round this time was slasher films, when people would cut each other with knives. You might remember KNIFE AFTER DARK. It was a load of rubbish, but boy was there a lot of knives, which is a bit like life really.\nI also liked lots of dirty movies, especially ones with girls in, but I'm not allowed to write about that, 'cause Doctor Perkins thinks I should be a monk and besides which I saw loads of funny pictures of Thai girls on his computer. Dirty bastard, still your wife does look like a pig on heat. Vice City had quite an exciting naughty scene, (this is social history, not filth, you prat) but, well, least said, soonest mended, seeing as some of them are now in public service and some of the others would put a price on my head.\ntv shows=\n&lt;br&gt;\nTV SHOWS\nI didn't watch much TV in the 80s. I was too busy chasing skirt. But maybe you did. Square! Anyway, there were a few shows I loved. And these ones were on television too.\nThis hard hitting cop show didn't run for too long, but it was great while it did. If I remember the premise, the show featured a yuppie policeman and an alien policeman running amok in a down town precinct, rife with all manner of social problems. The yuppie would try to defeat them using a personal organizer and a pair of snappy loafers, while the alien would lose his temper and liquidize them using policing methods best left to Alpha Centauri. It was all about fighting crime the hard way, in a $250,000 sports car and a UFO. Where are they now? The actor who played the yuppie, Morgan Daniels, was going to be the next big thing. Unfortunately, the stupid tosser believed his own hype. He's currently doing the rounds in Atlantic City and other small scale holiday resorts, and was convicted of possession of a dangerous animal. The actor who played the Alien, although he was covered head to toe in latex and had five pairs wobbly ears, went on to enjoy a successful career behind the cameras, as a film set catering man. It just goes to show, you never can tell!!!\nThis sitcom ran for three seasons, I think, although not with the original cast. The show mined the popular seam of mainstream entertainment, the fish out of water. Only with a different three fish all in the wrong water. Or something like that. Anyway, you remember how it went, a childless suburban couple went to the adoption agency and came back with three unlikely adoptees. Firstly, a fully grown man, who looked like a young boy. It was never explained why he looked so young, or why a fully grown man with an important job allowed himself to be adopted, but it was really funny. Mr. Dawkins, the 'dad' of the house, would shout \"go to your room\" and Jimmy, the youthful looking 35 year old bond trader would respond with \"But I'm a 35 year old bond trader.\" Secondly, a drunken tramp, who would slur and relieve himself in public and drink the cooking sherry. He was mainly set against the third adoptee, the pyromaniac little girl, played by that girl who ended up marrying the governor. Usually, the little girl would set fire to the couch, then the tramp would put it out. Then the tramp would be rewarded with a little drink, then he'd spill the drink on the little guy who looked weirdly young, then the mum of the house would burst into song, as her contract insisted on it. Then there'd be a group hug. In later series, the girl was replaced by a talking horse. Remember the catchphrases \"Not in my house!\" \"But I'm 35, I just look young.\" \"Can I have some mentholated spirits\" \"Can I have some mentholated spirits, a match and a rag, along with some TNT and a set of working fuses, for my birthday.\" \"Group hug.\"\nfads &amp; fashions=\n&lt;br&gt;\nFADS &amp; FASHIONS\nWell, there were loads of stupid things in the 80s, like having big hair or really narrow ties, but I wasn't going to talk about clothes. One thing that isn't so popular now is roller skating. But it was in Vice City. I always thought it was a 70s thing, and besides which, no self respecting man would ever go on roller skates, but this bird did and lots of men who thought they was birds did and all, but I've never been a fan of roller skating or whatever that stupid thing they do now is, as I'm not a pillock. Anyway, she's a pretty girl, and I should know. I had her. Probably.\ngreat 80s quotes=\n&lt;br&gt;\nGREAT 80S QUOTES\nThe lines that set the tone for the decade from the great and the not so great...and remember, these change every month or whenever I remember.\n\"There is no such thing as society\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"Margaret Thatcher\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"We're not building missiles to fight a war. We're building missiles to preserve the peace.\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"Ronald Reagan\"\n\"Give them what they want. Only build it cheap, so it falls down after five years.\"\n\"Avery Carrington\"\n\"In those days, I didn't know my ass from my elbow. Luckily, a lot of other people did.\"\n\"Educator and philanthropist, Candice Shand, formerly exotic dancer and adult star Candy Suxx\"\n\"At the end of the day, we promise only one thing, and one thing only, that as it pertains to conditions in this state and in this great city, nothing will ever be precisely the way it seemed before, in so far as I think we are all aware that government is not and can never be an institution we respect, more that it is the most effective repository of your tax dollars.\"\n\"Vice City Congressman, Alex Shrub\"\n\"Facts are stupid things.\"&lt;br&gt;\"Ronald Reagan\"\nfood=\n&lt;br&gt;\nFOOD\nOne thing that hasn't changed since the 80s is the fact that people need to eat to survive. And they still do. And in the 80s it was all about two things - nouvelle cuisine (tiny portions for rich people who spoke French) and absolute poisonous crap for the rest of us. How things change!\nAnyway, right, I never was a ponce, whatever my brother might say, so I always liked to eat basic sort of stuff. No endangered species on toast for me, unlike certain morons I could mention, so there are my two favourite eateries in the whole bleeding world. Food fit for a king, and much better than the crap we get in here. Healthy, nutrituous and never did me no harm.\nMall Food Court - absolutely top idea. Loads of different kinds of processed, deep fried, highly carcinogenic food under one roof. Bloody marvelous. I went mental first time I came into one of these.\nPizza - All of the basic food groups represented - bread, cheese, tomato and grease. Kids who ran it were a bunch of spotty prats though.\nfamous faces=\n&lt;br&gt;\nFAMOUS FACES&lt;br&gt;Candy Suxx, Avery Carrington, BJ Jones, Alex Shrub, Pastor Richards, Jack Howitzer, MANY MORE...&lt;br&gt;UNDER CONSTRUCTION\ncomputer games=\n&lt;br&gt;\nCOMPUTER GAMES&lt;br&gt;\nNerd central this one. Squares with milk bottle glasses. But lots more fun than that crap they play today. Real games, you could play for hours on end until you were hallucinating and had burnt your retinas doing the same thing over and over again. Remember the Degenatron? I picked one of these up when it fell off the back of a lorry and I bloody loved it. My cousin now makes a fortune selling pirated PlayStation games down at Ramsgate Saturday market, so it's funny how things turn out, isn't it? Still, in case you were wondering, my cousin is a right wanker.\ncars=\n&lt;br&gt;\nCARS&lt;br&gt;Here's a few pictures of cars I found. Basically, cars haven't changed much, although they have in a way. What I mean is, good luck finding a people carrier or a sports utility vehicle back then. Station wagons, sports cars and that sort of thing. I also found a picture of a speedboat, which is very nice indeed...\nCar for suburban mothers.\nLook at this ponce on a moped. Really fancies himself, doesn't he?\nBeautiful little speedboat.\nYou know what they say about a bloke with an expensive sportscar... Trying to hide certain inadequacies?\n\"last month's entry\"\nWell, they had cars in the 80s, and lots of them were stupid, but I can't find any photos. Instead I found this funny photo. I'll grant you it isn't a car. It's a golf cart, but its more interesting than a car. Now, only idiots played golf, but driving the carts was quite fun, especially after a five day bender at the Malibu. But it was when the Yuppies got really into golf but they was too lazy to walk that it all got silly.\nNOTE: Golf is a stupid game for people who like wearing silly trousers, but the golf club was a nice place to hang out, especially if you knew everybody in town, Perkins.\nclothes=\n&lt;br&gt;\nCLOTHES&lt;br&gt;Well the 80s was all about expressing yourself. About putting on a show to hide the fact you was an empty shell of a human being inside. Unfortunately, this was not always a good thing, as this line up of absolute plonkers will make all too clear to you. These are all shots taken by me of random passers by one afternoon in Vice City many years ago.\nLook at this \"man\" - least said, soonest mended.\nContrary to what you might imagine, this bird is not blind. She just dresses like she is. Looks like she got run over by the road markings machine. What a stupid slag.\nA right fox this bird. She's wearing sunglasses to hide the tears because I just broke her heart. Honest.\nAaah! The timeless charm of leopard skin! Another bird with real deficiencies in the taste department. A moose disguised as a leopard. Look at those bags. Bet she's going into the kind of debt it takes twenty years to pay off. Reckon her knockers are fake and all.\nDid anyone say \"camel toe\"? That pillock behind her is a copper. Fat bloke in taupe - can only mean one thing.\nsocial problems=\n&lt;br&gt;\nSOCIAL PROBLEMS\nPaul's TOP TEN SOCIAL PROBLEMS OF THE 1980's\n10. Rollerskaters&lt;br&gt;\nMy feelings on rollerskaters are well known. Mugs. But real irritating. Try, the Aerobics instructor is heading down the pavement, dreaming of his dream date and smacks straight into you. What a pain. Just cause I'd had a skinful, you prat.\n9. Self Help Programmes&lt;br&gt;\nThese idiots were everywhere. You couldn't turn on the TV or the radio but you'd get some plonker trying to tell you how to make things better. First up, I remember some nutter who thought he was a Viking. Called himself Thor, as you do. Advised you to unleash the Viking within. Called birds wenches and warned you to beware of the frost giant. Frost giant? It was a hundred degrees every day, you mug! Then there was that thief Jeremy Robard. What was his thing? Think your way to success. That was his three step programme, although it turned out he was actually a drug dealer or something like that. Either way, he was a prat. But, if you need someone to tell you how to become successful and get on in this world, then you're no friend of mine.\n8. Giggle Cream&lt;br&gt;\nBig scandal about this stuff. Was a spray cream with far too much propellant and far too little cream. Got banned in 1988 after someone laughed themselves to death or something like that.\n7. Used Car Salesmen&lt;br&gt;\nSame the world over. Only in Vice City, they went one step further. They'd sell you a car they hadn't even bothered to change the number plates on after they nicked it. Bloody cheek. Particularly the ones with celebrity endorsements.\n6. Stalkers&lt;br&gt;\nRight pain in the ass when you're in the music business. Some nutter gets on your case and starts hassling you every time you open your bleeding eyes, then they try and kill you. Nightmare.\n5. Blox&lt;br&gt;\nVery unpleasant cleaning fluid. Not very funny if you threw it on someone, I can tell you. \"Blox kills indiscriminately\" went the advert. Certainly worked on my brain.\n4. Gangs&lt;br&gt;\nIrritating little pillocks who think they can tell you what to do. Mug you. Be rude about your clothes. Sell you drugs. Sleep with your girlfriend. Very, very annoying. I moved with a better class of person myself.\n3. Ammunation&lt;br&gt;\nThis store would sell a gun to anyone, any time. Still do. Now, round my way, being tooled up does not mean having a weapon.\n2. Bikers&lt;br&gt;\nThey didn't wash. They didn't like anyone. They liked to beat people up and take their clothes.\n1. Kent Paul&lt;br&gt;\nI changed my mind. I really was public enemy number one. And I CAN count to ten, so up yours, Perkins.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

During this errand, Miss McIntosh's personal assistant &lt;a href=\"Danni\"&gt;Danni&lt;/a&gt; calls Luis multiple times en route to the club, checking on the order. If the player takes too long to deliver, McIntosh finds a pizzeria in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;, much to the frustration of Luis, who went through all that trouble for nothing.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Libertytreeonline.com/Kerry%20McIntosh%20Demands%20Refund%20From%20Rehab\"&gt;news reports&lt;/a&gt;, presumably the night before the mission &lt;a href=\"Tunnel%20of%20Death\"&gt;Tunnel of Death&lt;/a&gt;, she went to a four-day, luxury rehab clinic in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; before checking out on day three, again going under the influence of drugs and alcohol and crashing her red &lt;a href=\"Huntley%20Sport\"&gt;Huntley Sport&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=\"Wigwam%20Burger\"&gt;Wigwam Burger&lt;/a&gt; restaurant that night. She was supposedly going to stay at another luxury rehab facility in outer space when she decided to stay on earth and sue her previous clinic for being ineffective, later going to a Bahamas luxury clinic. Not long after, she chased a bathroom-peeping &lt;a href=\"paparazzi\"&gt;paparazzi&lt;/a&gt; away from her townhouse wielding a &lt;a href=\"Knife\"&gt;kitchen knife&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nAs of 2013, she is a 28 year old supermodel from &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; with a history of drug and alcohol abuse.\nShe is encountered in person by &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Vangelico\"&gt;Vangelico&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0Jewel Store on &lt;a href=\"Little%20Portola\"&gt;Little Portola&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rockford%20Hills\"&gt;Rockford Hills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; with her &lt;a href=\"dog\"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dexie\"&gt;Dexie&lt;/a&gt;. Trevor is ordered by &lt;a href=\"Nigel\"&gt;Nigel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mrs.%20Thornhill\"&gt;Mrs. Thornhill&lt;/a&gt; to collect Dexie's collar as a souvenir, which results in the dog fleeing at the sight of Trevor when approached, much to the dismay of Kerry. After following Dexie to a stop, he approaches the animal and takes its jewel-encrusted collar.\u00a0Kerry also has a &lt;a href=\"Bleeter\"&gt;Bleeter&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0profile and her bleets can be read from time to time.\nMcIntosh is one of the honored celebrities on the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Walk%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Vinewood Walk of Fame&lt;/a&gt;. \nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nKerry returns in \"GTA Online\" as part of the update where she is one of the celebrities the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;\"GTA Online\" Protagonist&lt;/a&gt; can be called upon to deliver to their &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs\"&gt;club&lt;/a&gt; to maintain their popularity. She will then be found inside the nightclub for a period of time, dancing in the VIP lounge area.\nAs part of the update, the player can buy a painting depicting Kerry to decorate their &lt;a href=\"Master%20Penthouse\"&gt;Master Penthouse&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs part of update, Kerry will hire &lt;a href=\"F.%20Clinton%20and%20Partner\"&gt;F.

Her model in \"GTA IV\" is the same model used for pictures of &lt;a href=\"Jill%20Von%20Crastenburg\"&gt;Jill Von Crastenburg&lt;/a&gt; (albeit without bleached hair and different clothing palettes) and rich female pedestrians found around inner-city &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rotterdam%20Hill\"&gt;Rotterdam Hill&lt;/a&gt;.\nHer clothing model in\u00a0\"GTA V\" is very similar to the clothing she wore in\u00a0\"GTA IV\", albeit with a different skirt pattern.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", the female &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; can buy a skirt identical to the one Kerry wears during the mission she appears in.\nInfluence.\nMcIntosh is a parody of both supermodel and singer (particularly her 2007 meltdown).

{"id": "90014", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=90014", "title": "Vacca", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Pegassi\"&gt;Pegassi&lt;/a&gt; Vacca is a two-door supercar in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nInfluence.\nThe Vacca's design is a mix between the and the with elements from the . The overall design, the greenhouse area, and the front fascia are based mostly on the Gallardo, while the side profile, bonnet, front bumper vents, exhausts, and tail lights are taken from the McLaren. The rear fascia shape, diffuser, rear louvers, and wheels are based on the Lamborghini Aventador. The headlights are shaped like on the facelifted Gallardo, however, flipped upside-down and omitting the headlight washer; the layout may have been inspired by the .\nDesign.\nThe Vacca is considered as the little brother of the &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt;, sharing a similar body shape and layout, but with a slightly shorter lenght and standard doors. The front of the car features three meshed intakes, with the central one being smaller than the outer ones and having the license plate just above it. The upper area has headlamp housings that are finished in , each one containing large circular units with smaller ones almost above them, while the front boot bears a slightly impressed area around the outer edges and opens to reveal a spacious luggage compartment. The manufacturer logo can be seen on the front of the boot compartment.\nThe sides of the car have large inset formations that lead to a set of dual vertical vents, intended to let air to flow through the engine bay and rear brakes, while the doors have mirror shells finished in carbon fibre. The greenhouse area follows a similar shape to its big brother and has blach trim around the windows and a rear engine compartment with carbon-fibre louvres on it, which opens to reveal the engine bay and inner sections also finished in carbon fibre.\nThe rear of the car features carbon-fibre slatted tail lamps on the outer edges, having two turning light strips on the upper side and two main/brake strips on the lower side, while the centre bears the manufacturer logo. On the middle section, the car has a vented panel that is also finished in carbon fibre, with a narrow shape around the centre and housing two trapezium-shaped exhaust tips. The lower area is occupied by the rear bumper that is fitted with a carbon-fibre diffuser, which holds the license plate on the centre and six blades at the bottom. The area behind the plate is also open for aerodynamic purposes.\nThe interior of the car is a derivative of the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;, sharing the same dials and gauges, central panel finished in carbon fibre and sports seats. However, the dials themselves have a yellow colour, and the horn cap bears the corresponding manufacturer emblem.\nThe Vacca can only be painted with a single colour, which is applied on the bodywork and the stitches of the dashboard, steering wheel and seats. The car uses five-spoke split rims with low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\nThe car is capable of high top speeds, owing to its high horse-power. Bearing a powerful engine, the Vacca is very easy to throw around on roads at high speeds. It can curve around bends with ease and weave in and out of traffic without much effort or body roll, though some oversteer is noticeable. Shifts are rather quick but sometimes it takes a while for the Vacca to gain traction after powerful take off, resulting in the transmission hesitating to upshift. This is a result of the vehicle using rear wheel drive instead of its sister car, the &lt;a href=\"Obey\"&gt;Obey&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"9F\"&gt;9F&lt;/a&gt;'s four wheel drive system. Crash deformation is good overall, with the vehicle being able to sustain multiple frontal hits without damaging its engine, which is located in the rear.\nAccording to the website, the Vacca a 5.1L engine that can push 540hp. Its engine model, however, is not very detailed and cannot fully reveal the engine cylinder configuration, aside from the fact that it is set in a \"V\" configuration, as with its brother, the &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt;. It is coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a rear-mid engine, rear wheel drive layout. Its engine sound is the same one from the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "32002", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=32002", "title": "Vader", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Shitzu\"&gt;Shitzu&lt;/a&gt; Vader is a streetfighter featured in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDesign.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nThe bike's overall design appears to be inspired by various naked bike models (which include the Versys, Ninja, Z-series and ER-6n), featuring a similar shaped body and seat layout. It also takes design cues from other standard bikes such as the , , and to a lesser extent, the .\nThe Vader shares a similar profile and some of its details with the &lt;a href=\"PCJ%20600\"&gt;PCJ 600&lt;/a&gt;, but makes use of unique features to distinguish itself from the aforementioned bike. The front section features a large fender mounted on the fork legs, while the upper side has a small fairing with the frontal lamps and the small glass on top. The upper clamp/plate holds two independent handlebars with small chrome mirrors on either side and a small panel with analog dials on the centre. The main body is rather basic and features a large fuel tank with a seemingly straighter profile compared to the one on the PCJ 600, while the engine bay features a front radiator, four exhaust tubes running towards the lower side and a silver body frame. The rear section is mostly occupied by two black seats for the occupants, long frames holding the foot pegs for both the rider and the passenger, and a single red tail lamp on the end. The rear wheel is covered by a carbon-fibre mudguard and connected by a dual-sided swing-arm with a single suspension spring, with the chain drive and sprocket on the left side.\nThere are two variations of the Vader:\nThe Vader spawns in a variety of primary colours applied on the front fender, fuel tank and rear section, as well as secondary colours applied on the rims. It uses the same wheel design as the PCJ 600, being three-spoke rims with medium-profile tyres, with the rear one being also wider.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe bike's initial design and influence remain identical to its previous iteration, albeit adding \"Vader\" markings on either side of the fuel tank, alongside a kanji. Again, the bike can spawn in the two variations listed above. In the enhanced version, the panel on the upper plate uses updated analog dials also used on the PCJ-600 and most sports bikes.\nColour distribution is a bit different, as the bike only has a primary colour for the front fender, fuel tank and rear section, while the rims use a dedicated wheel colour, which can be painted by selecting a custom rear wheel, applying a colour and change back to the stock wheel (as it won't reset to the default alloy color). It retains the same rim design and the wider rear tyre.\nPerformance.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nAcceleration and braking are average, but the top speed is impressive. The Vader does not handle as sharp as other bikes. However, thanks to its stability, this bike is more suitable for a long distance trip. It is also a great choice for those who does not want the heavy weight of a chopper-style motorcycle, as it is very lightweight. Its short wheelbase and height make it an easy bike for doing a wheelie.\nThe bike is powered by what seems to be a 4-cylinder engine, which is supported by the 4-2 exhaust manifold (4 into 2) seen on the bike. It has a high-revving and loud engine sound, derived from the PCJ 600.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Vader returns with minimal performance changes, other than a slightly-lowered curb weight of 230 kg, and tweaks to handling and turning cycles. The top speed remains the same, but its acceleration seems to be more responsive due to better traction; a result of the alterations to the handling system.\nAgain, the bike is powered by what seems to be a 4-cylinder engine, which is supported by the 4-2 exhaust manifold (4 into 2) seen on the bike. The engine noise is the same as the PCJ-600, appearing to be a high-pitched version of the one used in the &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;Sanchez&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "179175", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=179175", "title": "Vagner", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Dewbauchee\"&gt;Dewbauchee&lt;/a&gt; Vagner is a prototype hypercar featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the update, released on June 30th, 2017, during the &lt;a href=\"Independence%20Day%202017\"&gt;Independence Day 2017&lt;/a&gt; event.\nInfluence.\nThe car heavily resembles the prototype hypercar, particularly in the elongated design, frontal fascia and greenhouse area scaling. The shape of the front headlights appears to be inspired by the ones found in the , while the headlights themselves are inspired by the ones found in the . The rear lights seems to be inspired by the . The exhaust has resemblance to the one found in the .\nDesign.\nThe Vagner is distinctive by its lightweight bodywork and sleek cockpit design, where the front end has an elevated profile and mounts a diffuser/wing, which has two additional blades on the outer sides and four support frames; two larger ones on the centre and two smaller ones on the edges. Directly above the additional blades are two intakes intended to direct airflow to the front brakes, followed by modern strips between the intakes and the bodyline that defines the bumper area from the rest of the car. On the upper area, the car has black vertical housings placed over the rounded fenders, where each housing has four sectioned headlamps and a vertical turn signal in between, with the two outer lamps working as the main ones and the inner ones as high-beam lamps. The bonnet area is relatively flat compared to the fenders, having an impressed area on the centre that houses a carbon-fibre plate near the windscreen and the manufacturer emblem on the front.\nThe sides of the car denote its aerodynamic profile, featuring inset formations finished in carbon fibre and passing through the gull-wing doors, directing airflow to the intakes on the rear and two smaller ducts on the doors. The front area has flat skirts bearing silver \"DEWBAUCHEE\" lettering near the front wheels, while the rear area has blades similar to the front end and extend a bit further from the bodywork. The cockpit is relatively rounded and narrow in comparison to the rest of the car, which is mostly finished in carbon-fibre and has a seemingly long windscreen, with the roof area having the corresponding separations on the doors. Directly behind the cabin area, there is a coloured section that separates it from the engine bay, followed by a triangular section that is also finished in carbon fibre and bears a single compartment with a rear window, which exposes the engine bay marked with silver \"DEWBAUCHEE\" lettering. Again, the rear section is seemingly flat in comparison to the rear fenders.\nThe rear end of the car features a flat carbon-fibre plate that follows the same alignment as the rear flat section, holding a set of triangle-shaped lamps above the edges and the central manufacturer emblem on top, together with a single red strip on the end of the plate. The area below the plate consist of two rear exit vents on the edges and a smaller one on the centre, with the separations housing small reverse lamps. Like the front area, the rear has an elevated profile and houses quad-exit exhausts surrounded by a silver detail. The entire underside of the car is carbon-plated, with the corresponding elevations on both ends and having protruding formations on the middle and rear sections, with a central one intended for the exhaust tubes. There are small gaps on the sides defining the aforementioned side skirts, as well as carbon-fibre arms connecting the front wheels.\nThe interior of the car is shared with the &lt;a href=\"X80%20Proto\"&gt;X80 Proto&lt;/a&gt;, using the same dial set and carbon-fibre details around. However, it appears to be slightly narrower, evidenced by the smaller spacing between the dial panel and the cabin's A-pillars. The manufacturer emblem can be seen on the horn cap.\nMost of the car's bodywork is painted with the primary colour, while the separation on the roof is painted with the secondary one. A trim colour is also available for the interior, being applied on the dashboard, part of the doors, the inner portions of the seats and the stitches, as well as an accent colour, for the trims found around the sides, rear and underside. Similar to vehicle like the &lt;a href=\"ETR1\"&gt;ETR1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"RE-7B\"&gt;RE-7B&lt;/a&gt;, the Vagner features racing slicks for the stock rims, with the rims being similar to the \"Mercie\" rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;. These rims can also support a dedicated colour, which is set to black in both naturally-generated and purchased examples, but for the latter case, they will reset to the default alloy colour if the wheels are changed.\nCurrent Design Gallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nCurrent Model=\nOriginal Model=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nPerformance.\nThe Vagner is one of the fastest cars available in the game, possessing great top speed and very good handling. The low suspension gives the car great stability when turning into a corner, however the back end can be prone to lose control if going over a significant bump. The Vagner's decent acceleration allows it to move quickly after taking a turn correctly, which can be an advantage on tracks with many low speed corners. However, the Vagner's acceleration is not as efficient or consistent as other supers such as the &lt;a href=\"Osiris\"&gt;Osiris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tempesta\"&gt;Tempesta&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to downforce and the bump taking ability of the Vagner, the car can take very fast corners at speeds incomparable to most other supercars. However, supercars such as the &lt;a href=\"Tempesta\"&gt;Tempesta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zentorno\"&gt;Zentorno&lt;/a&gt; are better at taking slower corners and hairpins. On a straight line, the Vagner is competitive, having a higher top speed than the regular &lt;a href=\"Nero\"&gt;Nero&lt;/a&gt; but lower than the &lt;a href=\"Itali%20GTB%20Custom\"&gt;Itali GTB Custom&lt;/a&gt;.\nStatistic-wise, the Vagner rivals the &lt;a href=\"X80%20Proto\"&gt;X80 Proto&lt;/a&gt;. The X80 is AWD while the Vagner is RWD, resulting in less understeer overall. It also has good grip in high speed corners due to the downforce. However, this is insignificant in slower corners when the Vagner's downforce statistic results in less cornering grip. Brakes are slightly stronger on the Vagner than the X80. The Vagner has higher traction statistics as well compared to the X80. Lastly, the Vagner weighs 100 kg more than the X80. Both cars can clip curbs.\nThe engine cover/cam cover design is reused from the &lt;a href=\"Furore%20GT\"&gt;Furore GT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20GT\"&gt;Rapid GT&lt;/a&gt;, appearing to be a V8 engine. The engine sound can be said to be similar to that of the X80 Proto, but with a higher pitch, and that of the &lt;a href=\"Specter\"&gt;Specter&lt;/a&gt;. Because of the high power of the engine, and the excessive amount of revolutions per minute, the car tends to backfire when downshifting. Constantly hitting the brake when at high speeds can result in large backfires which have a louder sound than any other backfires on vehicles.\nModifications.\nWhen purchasing a Vagner, the default color options available on &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Motorsport\"&gt;Legendary Motorsport&lt;/a&gt; will apply slightly different colors compared to regular vehicles. This preset gives the vehicle a Stone Silver secondary color regardless of the color chosen. It also adjusts the vehicle's pearlescent and wheel colors and assigns the vehicle a dial color which is applied to various trims, including within the diffuser and along the side intakes."}

{"id": "237610", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=237610", "title": "Vagrant", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Maxwell\"&gt;Maxwell&lt;/a&gt; Vagrant is an off-road buggy featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of update.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Vagrant is evidently based on the , given the overall shape, wheel fenders and headlights (although rearranged in a triangle setup, opposed to the Nomad's linear setup).\nThe vehicle assumes a similar layout to the &lt;a href=\"Dune%20Buggy\"&gt;Dune Buggy&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bifta\"&gt;Bifta&lt;/a&gt;, but has a more modernized bodywork that is predominately finished in black. The front end of the buggy has a small bullbar that protects a small intercooler with a fan on it, while the outer portions mount a set of three circular lights arranged in a triangular setup, consisting of the outer main lights, the inner high-beam lights and the lower indicators. On the upper side, there is a small compartment that bears the Maxwell logo on the front and can be opened (labelled as the \"trunk\" in the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt;), while the sections beside it have protruding shapes, where the suspension springs are located.\nThe cabin area is relatively tall and wide, having the corresponding windscreen and two small mirror wings on the front, as well as two additional frames on the roof area. The same cabin is mostly exposed and lacks any sort of doors or panelling around, other than the plastic fenders on the wheels.\nOn the rear, the buggy has a black upper panel with the Maxwell logo and lettering on the end, together with a painted engine compartment that barely opens (likely to make room for the \"Roof\" options) and protruding sections on the outer sides, where the suspension springs are located. Directly within the rear section, there is the engine bay with the corresponding exhaust system, which leads to the passenger side and towards a large muffler located below the aforementioned panel, before splitting into two small tips located on either side of the same muffler. Either side of the rear are twin circular tail lights, each one consisting of outer brake/turning lights and inner main lights, with white outer rings on the inner set that work as the reverse lights. The bottom area of the rear has a license plate and an exposed bullbar acting as the rear bumper.\nThe underside of the vehicle is mostly plated, with the hoses of the front intercooler and the brakes partially exposed. The wheels have the corresponding control arms connected to the main body, as well as the steering rack on the front, the drive shafts on the rear and the support frames for the fenders.\nThe cabin compartment shares the same dial set and features as most race vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"RE-7B\"&gt;RE-7B&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ETR1\"&gt;ETR1&lt;/a&gt;, having a carbon-fibre dashboard, numerous switches around and a digital display with RPM indicators below, as well as steel flooring and carbon-fibre seats with race seatbelts. The steering wheel also bears the Maxwell logo on the centre.\nThe primary colour of the vehicle is applied on the front compartment and the rear engine compartment, while the secondary colour is applied on the external roll cage and the protective frames. A trim colour is also available for the suspension springs and the overstitches of the steering wheel. It uses a set of rims similar to the ones from the &lt;a href=\"Landstalker\"&gt;Landstalker&lt;/a&gt;, being identical to the \"Challenger\" off-road wheels seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, fitted with high-profile tyres. The rims can also support a dedicated colour, although only examples in &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; can have one, as naturally-generated ones assign the default alloy as the wheel colour.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Vagrant is very competitive in its class, possessing excellent acceleration and top speed. Top speed is high in its class, letting the vehicle compete with other fast off-road vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;Sanchez&lt;/a&gt;. Handling is responsive, allowing the vehicle to make quick turns. Traction is good, keeping the vehicle on the ground. Braking is good, taking only a short distance to come to a complete stop. \nAs with the design of the Vagrant, it has excellent off-road capabilities. Its suspension allows it to go over small rocks and the terrain with ease, making it great for off-road racing. The powerful engine allows it to climb almost any slope with ease. The downside of the Vagrant is that it is rather light, owing to the design of the vehicle. This makes sorting out traffic a problem as hitting vehicles can make it stop completely.\nThe vehicle is powered by what looks like a V-shaped engine, with the textures exposing six outlets on either side. However, the exhaust system seems to originate directly from the centre, with no defined manifolds to prove its exact configuration. It has a 6-speed gearbox and a rear wheel drive configuration, and emits a sound that is similar to cars like the &lt;a href=\"Stinger\"&gt;Stinger&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Stinger%20GT\"&gt;Stinger GT&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Issi%20Classic\"&gt;Issi Classic&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, unlike the UH-1Y, the exhausts are very close to each other, similarly to a //, and it features a tail rotor from a or , which has a similar empennage.\nThe Valkyrie is a rather large helicopter that features a rounded nose, large windows and access doors, as well as a lower section that mounts a frontal turret. On the middle section, there is a large engine compartment with the corresponding intakes on the front, the dual exhausts on the rear and the main rotor with a circular hub on top of the blades, while the lower area consist of an open bay with non-interactive cockpit doors, a lower structure extending to the sides of the helicopter and black skids. The tail boom and are relatively large as well, featuring tall fins on the horizontal stabilizers and a tall vertical stabilizer, housing a fenestron tail rotor with numerous blades and circular hubs. The aircraft features black markings around the fuselage and may have one of the following decals on the nose: a white spade, a pinup model with the caption \"Miss Zancudo\", or a pinup model bending over with the caption \"Come &amp; take it\".\nThe interior of the aircraft is relatively large, featuring a wide instrument panel and an open section leading to the rear bay. The same bay features vertical frames and side-facing seats for the rear passengers/gunners. In the enhanced version, it uses the same \"Flyer\" dials as the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, and shares the same arrangement with the &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe aircraft only spawn in a dark grey primary color around the fuselage and a black secondary color on the nose, up to the windshield and the doors. \nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with port and starboard mounted &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt;s seemingly based on the , as well as a four-barrel gatling gun on the nose, which appear to resemble a .\nPerformance.\nVehicle.\nThe Valkyrie has an above average speed at 140 knots, making it slower than the &lt;a href=\"Swift\"&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt;, but slightly faster than the &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;.

The indicators on the side of the headlights might also be inspired by the . The taillights seem to be inspired by either the or .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nIn terms of design, the Vamos follows a similar profile to vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Impaler\"&gt;Impaler&lt;/a&gt;, where the front end is quite dominated by the bulky bumper with riveted details on the lower area and the sides, two open sections beside the license plate and small amber lights on the outer edges, before reaching the protruding ends of the bumper. The upper area features a large grille with rectangular lights behind them and square-shaped housings for the circular headlights, along with sectioned amber lights on the outer edges. The hood area is relatively simple, with an angled front end and protruding edges.\nThe sides of the car are mostly flat, with a slightly flared profile on the wheel arches and a trim running across the sides, with a detail on the bottom and circular rear-view mirrors on the doors. The greenhouse area is relatively simple, with thin inner pillars and slanted rear. \"396ci\" badges can be seen on the front, while the corresponding manufacturer badges can be seen on the rear, just over the side detail.\nThe rear of the car is traditional, featuring a large trunk with a detail on the center, followed by a black panel and the rectangular tail lights on the rear end. The rear bumper also has the same riveted details and the central license plate as on the front, albeit the rivets are located in the upper area. The manufacturer badge can be seen on the center of the black panel, along with a cursive badge on the passenger side displaying the car's name. Two exhaust pipes can be seen below. The interior is shared with muscle cars like the &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe bodywork and the engine cam covers are painted with the primary color, while the bumpers, trim and details around the car are painted with a secondary color. The rims appear to be a derivative of the \"Old School\" muscle rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, but the center of the rim does not have the details seen on the aforementioned custom rims. These rims can also support a dedicated color, although only examples generated in &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; are painted in black.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Vamos is notorious for its high spin-out, often losing control at higher speeds if not maintained carefully. As a result, it doesn't fare very well when driving through congested traffic. In addition, if the car is launched airborne, the Vamos will often land awkwardly. While the Vamos can be given full suspension upgrades as to negate this effect, its steering is still very sensitive and has bouts of spinning out very easily. The Vamos has a tendency to roll over on its side when executing a tight handbrake turn at high speeds. Durability is good, though repeated impacts can cause drastic issues to the vehicle.\nThe Vamos is stated to be powered by a 396ci (6.5L) engine, with the model being a single-cam V8. This engine is coupled to a 4-speed gearbox and powers the rear wheels, with a distinctively loud engine sound similar to the ones used in the &lt;a href=\"Tulip\"&gt;Tulip&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Imperator\"&gt;Imperator&lt;/a&gt;, with a lower pitch. Installing an \"Exposed Turbo Grille\" modification adds one or two fully-animated turbochargers, though this is purely cosmetic and does not increase performance unless the actual \"Turbo\" modification is installed, while installing a \"Bug Catcher/Ram Pipes\" modification add a supercharger."}

Because this particular Securicar is bulletproof, the player must ram the vehicle continuously until the damage meter is full; large and heavy vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Bus%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Bus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Coach\"&gt;Coach&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Linerunner\"&gt;Linerunner&lt;/a&gt; are particularly useful damaging the Securicar quickly and pinning down the van when necessary. Upon ramming the Securicar for the first time, the van will begin to flee. In addition, the player accumulates a minimum of &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;two stars&lt;/a&gt; by only hitting the vehicle twice.\nWhen the Securicar is sufficiently damaged, its occupants exit the vehicle and flee, allowing the player to commandeer the van and take it to a garage in Portland Harbor. Even if the player has up to three stars, the Securicar's weight should allow the vehicle to push aside any opposing police cars. Regardless of how many stars the player has, their wanted level is nullified when the Securicar reaches its final destination.\nReward.\nThe reward for completing the mission is &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;20,000 and the unlocking of two missions: &lt;a href=\"Cipriani%27s%20Chauffeur\"&gt;Cipriani's Chauffeur&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Joey%20Leone\"&gt;Joey Leone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Turismo&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"El%20Burro\"&gt;El Burro&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, the garage used to stash the Securicar in \"Van Heist\" may receive additional Securicars thereafter (even directly from the &lt;a href=\"Import/Export\"&gt;Import/Export&lt;/a&gt; garage), with payouts for every additional Securicar delivered decreased by &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;500 until the player may no longer receive any more money. Total: 10 &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt;s."}

The members who appear outside are armed and can be recruited by the player to serve as &lt;a href=\"bodyguards\"&gt;bodyguards&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are two groups within the Vance Crime Family, one that runs the legal businesses (&lt;a href=\"prostitution\"&gt;prostitution&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protection%20Racket%20%28business%29\"&gt;protection racket&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Loan%20Shark\"&gt;loan shark&lt;/a&gt;), and one that runs the illegal businesses (&lt;a href=\"robbery\"&gt;robbery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"smuggling\"&gt;smuggling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drug%20Running\"&gt;drug running&lt;/a&gt;).

The goons that carry Mac 10s can perform &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive bys&lt;/a&gt; on rival gang members, firing at a faster rate than the player.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nIn the beginning of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", and during \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\", the crime family is made up of two main members, &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;Victor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Vance\"&gt;Lance Vance&lt;/a&gt;, of which Victor is the leader. Victor and Lance grew up poor and try out drug trafficking to make a profit to live on and provide medical costs for their ill brother, &lt;a href=\"Pete%20Vance\"&gt;Pete Vance&lt;/a&gt;, after Victor is thrown out of the &lt;a href=\"Military%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;United States Army&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nThe Vance Crime Family was known to have seized control of many businesses and assets and became a large scale operation. After the events of \"GTA Vice City Stories\", in which Victor and Lance agree to leave Vice City temporarily, the gang is shrunk. It can be assumed that it had still been active but on a much more minuscule scale.\nThey decided to lay low, away from the criminal life; however, the pair began working again by &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;. It is implied by a few unused lines from the \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" introduction mission &lt;a href=\"In%20The%20Beginning...\"&gt;In The Beginning...&lt;/a&gt; that they stashed the twenty kilos of cocaine in a farm in , but it is unknown if this statement is still considered canon, although it is still implied during the final cutscene of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".

The club itself is divided into a stage (resembling a penis, another example of &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt;' crude humor), bar, private rooms, a small office and the stripper's dressing room. The latter keeps a &lt;a href=\"Snakes\"&gt;large snake&lt;/a&gt; as a pet, which will not move in any case. There is also a DJ booth, which connects to the bar, but both are inaccessible.\n&lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; is seen in the club during his personal trailer, hanging out with &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt;. He seems to be friends with the bouncer/doorman since he always greets Franklin as \"Mr. C\". The doorman will also recognize &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Hang%20Ten\"&gt;Hang Ten&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting they visit the club frequently, especially to see &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; and plan the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Depository\"&gt;Union Depository&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;heist&lt;/a&gt;.

In the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V%23Enhanced%20and%20PC%20Versions\"&gt;enhanced version&lt;/a&gt;, the music heard inside is taken from various &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;radio stations&lt;/a&gt;. As with all other radio stations in the game, only 10 or so songs will play on a randomized loop. Wade may comment on the small song selection if the player walks by him where he will comment, \"They only play like, six songs in here. It's kinda making me crazy.\"\nThe club is a frequent gang hangout location of &lt;a href=\"The%20Families\"&gt;The Families&lt;/a&gt;, as it is located deep in their turf in Strawberry. Members can be seen standing outside the club and there is always a member sitting by one of the tables near the bartender.\nIn \"GTA Online\", the strip club is locked until &lt;a href=\"rank\"&gt;rank&lt;/a&gt; 6.\nDuring the Stolen Watch variation of , the club is taken over by the &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20Mob\"&gt;Armenian Mob&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; is required to fight their way to a safe in the back room and recover a watch.\nThe strip club has a website on the in-game &lt;a href=\"Internet%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt; at www.vanillaunicorn..\nInfluence.\nThe club name is a play on the real-life strip club chain , as both names contain a flavor and a horned animal. However, unicorns are fictional, unlike rhinos.\n\"Vanilla\" is also slang for something or someone that is very basic or in its simplest form, such as a person who is sexually vanilla. \"Unicorn\" is slang for \"&lt;a href=\"Prostitutes\"&gt;single woman&lt;/a&gt;\", meaning the term \"vanilla unicorn\" may refer to a non-kinky single woman.\nAlso, judging by the club's location in Strawberry and its exterior, the building seems to be based on the real life strip club in .\nStrippers.\nIn the strip club, the player can pay &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;40 (pocket cash only) to receive a topless dance in private. The protagonist can flirt with the stripper or touch her to increase a \"Like\" meter. However, there is a bouncer in the private room that walks back and forth, and if the bouncer catches the protagonist touching the dancer three times, the protagonist will be kicked out of the club. If the protagonist likes her enough, he can choose to &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Call\"&gt;take her home&lt;/a&gt;, similar to &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;girlfriends&lt;/a&gt; in . Additionally, the strippers will be added to the characters' &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;cell phone&lt;/a&gt; contacts, much like the women met in the &lt;a href=\"Maisonette%209\"&gt;Maisonette 9&lt;/a&gt; from , and can be taken home without receiving a dance first. However, some strippers do not sleep around.\nAfter Trevor acquires the Vanilla Unicorn, he, Michael and Franklin can touch the strippers without the risk of being ejected. For Trevor, lap dances are free and the strippers call him \"sir\".\nAfter a stripper is taken home for the first time, her &lt;a href=\"Phone%20Numbers\"&gt;number&lt;/a&gt; will be available on the contacts list on the player's phone. The player can then call her at night to pick her up and take her home, but if called during the day she will make an excuse. She will usually send pictures of herself to the player too after being taken home. Sometimes when picked up, strippers will give the player a blowjob while he is driving her home. This can easily be noticed by pressing the button to look behind while driving, as well as the comments made by her and the player.\nIf a stripper is attacked or killed, either at the club or in transit during a booty call, she will be alive and well during her next shift at the club. She will, however, be mad at the player; they will have to restore her \"like\" bar in order to re-acquire her as a booty call. Also, in \"GTA V\", when taking a stripper home, the stripper will get mad and leave the player when it looks like they're leaving her behind.\nIn \"GTA Online\", the player can get a lap dance, again for $40, only there is no bouncer in the area of the private rooms and they can hold the stripper without the worry of being kicked out. They once again must raise a Like bar, which can be worked on by tossing dollar bills during the stripper's pole dance, holding the stripper during lap dances, or using their microphone to flirt with the stripper. Filling the flirt bar will add a bit to the Like bar at a time. Most of them also have their voice lines disabled, unless they have unique lines that are not gender-specific.\nIf particular strippers with whom their Like meters are high enough, are working at the time and a private dance is purchased for one of them, the game will inform the player that there is a girl available that the stripper is willing to dance with (a double lapdance), and they need to be asked to join before entering the private rooms. The second dancer will need to be paid as usual before she agrees.\nIf the player wishes to max out the Like meter, it must be done in one session as it is reset with every new session.\nOnce the Like bar is full, the stripper will give the player her number; if rung, she will come to the player's apartment (the more high-end it is, the better) to perform free lap dances in a predesignated armchair (though not ) for the player and their friends. Only one stripper at a time can be invited over.\nWhen not performing, she will stand by the chair and dance in place. As long as a player is in range and able to activate a lap dance she will stay. If the mobile phone is active or a player is not in range, she will ask for interaction until an in-game notice warns that she will leave if she becomes bored from being ignored. Once she reaches that point, she will say goodbye and simply walk out of the apartment.\nFor some reason, topless dances could not be received in \"GTA Online\", even though it is described as a topless bar by Lcn-exchange.com. Additionally, only &lt;a href=\"Nikki\"&gt;Nikki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chastity\"&gt;Chastity&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fufu\"&gt;Fufu&lt;/a&gt; worked in the club in \"GTA Online\" in the original version. These issues were changed in the Enhanced Version in &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Title%20Update%20Notes\"&gt;patch 1.27&lt;/a&gt;, however.\nThe strippers currently working at the club are:\nThe strippers work in shifts: Sapphire, Fufu, Infernus and Peach work together, between 20:00 and 08:00, as do Juliet, Nikki, Chastity and Cheetah, between 08:00 and 20:00. In each shift, there are two strippers who are available to take home and two who aren't. If the player is looking for a particular stripper and doesn't see her, they can return later when the strippers change shifts. In \"GTA Online\", the strippers work in groups of three instead of four, and the time is randomized. Sapphire, Infernus, and Chastity work together; Fufu, Peach, and Juliet work together; and Cheetah, Nikki, and Juliet work together. Juliet is the only stripper to appear in multiple shifts.\nAs a Safehouse.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Hang%20Ten\"&gt;Hang Ten&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor \"acquires\" the Vanilla Unicorn as a safehouse, replacing &lt;a href=\"Floyd%27s%20Apartment\"&gt;Floyd's Apartment&lt;/a&gt;, which loses its function as a &lt;a href=\"Safehouses%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;safehouse&lt;/a&gt; in the mission. Once acquired (at no cost to the player), Trevor can roam freely around the backrooms of the club.\nThis is one of five safehouses in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series to be given to the player after killing the owner, the others being the &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Estate\"&gt;Vercetti Estate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Playboy%20X%27s%20Penthouse\"&gt;Playboy X's Penthouse&lt;/a&gt; (only if &lt;a href=\"Playboy%20X\"&gt;Playboy X&lt;/a&gt; is killed), &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Jeremy%27s%20Safehouse\"&gt;Brian Jeremy's Safehouse&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Lancaster%20Safehouse\"&gt;Lancaster Safehouse&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther features of the club as a safehouse:\nUnlike other safehouses, if Michael or Franklin fires their weapon inside or at the parking after Hang Ten, Trevor will not call or text them to stop.\nWebsite.\nSpecial Events.\n\"Have an unforgettable bachelor party at the Vanilla Unicorn.

The word 'vapid' means 'dull', which may reference Ford's nature as a producer of commonplace and affordable vehicles, but also sounds similar to 'rapid,' a possible motivation for the use of the name. Vapid is one of the largest car manufacturers in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\nThere is a &lt;a href=\"Vapid%20of%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Vapid of Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; dealership in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Downtown&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;.

Much of their origins and past history is unknown. Likewise, the origins and past of their rivalry with the other Los Santos gangs - particularly the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos&lt;/a&gt; - is also unknown, though it obviously began sometime between &lt;a href=\"1980\"&gt;1980&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;. It is highly likely that they evolved from the &lt;a href=\"El%20Corona\"&gt;El Corona&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood, and their presence grew with the increase of &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt; and other Hispanic/Latino immigration to the area, correlating with the relative deprivation of the area compared to the rest of the city.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Varrios Los Aztecas are not a major part of the story, but are first mentioned during &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20%26amp%3B%20Kendl\"&gt;Sweet &amp; Kendl&lt;/a&gt; in which &lt;a href=\"Sweet\"&gt;Sweet&lt;/a&gt; refers to &lt;a href=\"Kendl\"&gt;Kendl&lt;/a&gt;'s relationship with a high-ranking Azteca member - &lt;a href=\"Cesar%20Vialpando\"&gt;Cesar Vialpando&lt;/a&gt;, stating \"you know we beefing\". Because of this, the gang acts as a fulcrum point between the relationship of Sweet and his sister due to Cesar being Kendl's boyfriend - much to the dismay of Sweet because to Cesar's involvement with the VLA. \nThe radio in the early game mentions that the Aztecas were in a &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos-Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; with the Vagos in &lt;a href=\"East%20Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;East Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, despite the area actually being controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey are first seen during the mission &lt;a href=\"Cesar%20Vialpando%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Cesar Vialpando&lt;/a&gt;. Sweet orders &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;CJ&lt;/a&gt; to follow his sister to a lowriding club at &lt;a href=\"Unity%20Station\"&gt;Unity Station&lt;/a&gt;, where a lowriding competition with a high concentration of Azteca gang members is taking place - including Cesar Vialpando himself. Fortunately, the Aztecas do not harass or fight CJ and let him take part in the bouncing competition against an Azteca member. CJ wins the competition without any violence taking place and is then introduced to Cesar Vialpando - Kendl's boyfriend. CJ makes his objection to the relationship clear, and an influential (possibly an OG) Azteca member called &lt;a href=\"Jose%20%28GTA%20SA%29\"&gt;Jose&lt;/a&gt; approaches CJ and confronts/insults him for his rudeness. Fortunately, Cesar is able to influence Jose to \"cool down\", thus causing him to leave and possibly saving CJ's life. From this point on, Cesar and CJ start to develop a close friendship though the gang violence between the Aztecas and &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt; doesn't decrease.\nIt is likely that the Aztecas have no involvement with &lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt; like the other three Los Santos gangs. This is because the Aztecas never show-up to rob the weapons train during the mission &lt;a href=\"Catalyst\"&gt;Catalyst&lt;/a&gt;, where as the other three gangs were tipped off by CRASH about the train. This is odd since the Aztecas are heavily involved in arms dealing/gun running. Either CRASH are scared of the Aztecas due to them being possibly the most heavily armed gang in Los Santos, or they avoid them because they mistakenly think they are weak due to their small size. Another possibility for this is because CRASH does not want to make the VLA too powerful over the other gangs by equipping them with even more weapons (due to them already being heavily armed). CRASH reveals this mentality to CJ during the mission &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Imports\"&gt;Gray Imports&lt;/a&gt; by stating \"if one tribe gets an unfair advantage over another, that truly troubles me Carl!\".\nHowever, upon the completion of the mission &lt;a href=\"Gone%20Courting\"&gt;Gone Courting&lt;/a&gt;, the Aztecas lose all of their territory and influence to the Vagos - including El Corona, Unity Station, and &lt;a href=\"Little%20Mexico\"&gt;Little Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. Remaining Aztecas are killed or in hiding while Cesar is far away from Los Santos aiding CJ and Kendl.\nThroughout the rest of the middle game, the Aztecas make no appearances. \nUpon the return of CJ to Los Santos, Cesar and the Aztecas regain back their territory from the Vagos in a gang war amid &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Riots\"&gt;citywide riots&lt;/a&gt; with the help of CJ and some Grove Family members during the mission &lt;a href=\"Los%20Desperados\"&gt;Los Desperados&lt;/a&gt;. This mission also introduces the other three known Azteca OG's - &lt;a href=\"Gal\"&gt;Gal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunny\"&gt;Sunny&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hazer\"&gt;Hazer&lt;/a&gt;. This is the only known situation where the Families and the Aztecas join together briefly to take down the Vagos.\nDescription.\nThe Varrios Los Aztecas are an extremely proud Mexican/Latino street gang, and they control &lt;a href=\"El%20Corona\"&gt;El Corona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Little%20Mexico\"&gt;Little Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Unity%20Station\"&gt;Unity Station&lt;/a&gt;. They are the smallest gang in the city but are likely to be one of the most heavily armed, giving them power over the other gangs. They are a traditionally anti-narcotic gang like the Grove Street families, with heavy involvement in gun running/arms trafficking, gang-banging, gang warfare, street violence, gang-related homicide, murder, vandalism, and illegal street racing. They are easily identifiable by their turquoise colored bandanas and 90's \"cholo\" style clothing.\nThe Aztecas have a fierce rivalry with the Los Santos Vagos, and strongly dislike the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Rifa\"&gt;San Fierro Rifa&lt;/a&gt;. They also have many conflicts with the nearby Ballas (especially the Front Yard set) since their territories border near &lt;a href=\"Idlewood\"&gt;Idlewood&lt;/a&gt;. The Aztecas are also enemies with the Grove Street Families and will attack Grove members on sight though the rivalry is not as intense as it is with the Ballas and especially the Vagos since the families are well away from their territory, and since they both share similar views on drug trafficking.\nAztecas will more commonly question CJ about his gang banging status rather than directly shooting him on sight like the Ballas would. If the player chooses to respond positively, CJ will announce he is from Grove Street and the Aztecas will attack. Aztecas members will be hostile to Carl only if he walks on their territory. If he drives a car through their turf, they will just stand on the street and won't even chase him or shoot at his car. This indicates that the Aztecas and GSF have a lighter rivalry, as opposed to the Ballas and Vagos, whom the GSF are arch-enemies with.\nDespite the rivalry between the Aztecas and the Families, two prominent OG's/high ranking members bond a close friendship - Carl Johnson (Grove Street) and Cesar Vialpando (Aztecas) due to Cesar dating Carl's sister Kendl - though this is much to the dismay of Grove Street leader Sweet whom quotes at the beginning of the game \"you know we beefing\" in relation to the rivalry between the two gangs. The friendship of Carl and Cesar is further fueled when they eventually leave behind the gang-banging lifestyle. Hence, despite the fact that Cesar is a friend of the protagonist, this gang will still confront and/or attack CJ if he walks on their turf.\nUnity Station acts as a front for the gang and is a common meeting place, aswell as being the place where their lowrider competition takes place. VLA members are mostly dressed in the 90's \" (Mexican gangster) style clothing of the time and turquoise bandanas are a dead give-away and they will often mark their territroy with graffiti. Members are found hanging around and talking in groups while smoking marijuana and drinking malt liquor. Upon spotting a Balla, Grove, and especially a Vago or rarely a Rifa member on sight - they will engage in a violent confrontation. Aztecas can also sometimes be seen flashing their gang handsigns.\nOn the streets, they are either unarmed or armed with the 9mm &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt;. Since they carry the Micro SMG on the streets along with an &lt;a href=\"RPG\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tec-9\"&gt;Tec-9&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Katana\"&gt;Katana&lt;/a&gt; in the mission &lt;a href=\"Los%20Desperados\"&gt;Los Desperados&lt;/a&gt;, they are actually better armed than their primary enemy - the Vagos, though the Vagos are much larger and have more territory while the Aztecas are the smallest gang in Los Santos - suggesting that they are probably on equal power.\nThe Aztecas drive the &lt;a href=\"Broadway\"&gt;Broadway&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Glendale%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Glendale&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt;. Their favourite radio station is &lt;a href=\"Playback%20FM\"&gt;Playback FM&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe VLA have three different skins that will walk and drive around their territories.\nGal, Sunny, and Hazer are likely the gang's OG's who assist Cesar and Carl to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Desperados\"&gt;recover some of their lost territory&lt;/a&gt; during the mission \"Los Desperados\" towards the end of the game. Jose is also possibly an OG/high ranking member, who is introduced during the mission \"Cesar Vialpando\". The game never explains Cesar's status in the gang. He could be the leader or a high-ranking OG. It is more likely that he is a high-ranking member and not the leader due to his influence over Jose and his overall respect. If he was the leader, it is unlikely he would befriend CJ, ask for the Grove Street Families' help during the mission Los Desperados, or date Kendl.\nThe Aztecas are traditionally heavily into cars and the lowriding culture and \"hopping\" or hydraulics usage as part of their gangs identity and past-time. They have a betting competition known as the &lt;a href=\"Lowrider%20Challenge\"&gt;Lowrider Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. It can be found at Unity Station after talking to the mechanic just outside of the east wall of the station's parking lot.\nUnlike the other gangs, the Aztecas don't primarily seem to be concerned with \"branching out\" or starting businesses/relationships (except for arms running/dealing) like the Vagos/Ballas willingness to engage in the crack trade or the Grove Families willingness for territory/expansion. Instead, they seem to be more locally focused by exclusvely representing and defending their \"barrio\".\nInterestingly, unlike the Ballas and the Grove Families; the Aztecas are not divided into different sets - and are formed as one large gang instead. This is probably due to their small size: the different sets make it easier to organize large gangs, while the Aztecas wouldn't necessarily have that problem.\nTerritory Glitch.\nDue to a glitch, it is possible for the Varrios Los Aztecas to attack &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt; territory. First, the player will have to wait for some Ballas to attack the hood. When the territory is attacked, the player will need to lure 3 Ballas gangbangers into &lt;a href=\"El%20Corona\"&gt;El Corona&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Little%20Mexico\"&gt;Little Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, kill them there and then drive to the attacked hood. The player will see blue points on the map, either &lt;a href=\"Glendale%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Glendale&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Broadway\"&gt;Broadway&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Hermes\"&gt;Hermes&lt;/a&gt; blocking the turf and the Varrios attacking it."}

This indicates the possibility that the Aztecas are a multi-generational gang that have been around for a while. This is not uncommon in Los Angeles, as there are Mexican street gangs such as and Clanton 14 that have been around since the 1930s.\nThey have links to the cartels and are currently at a war with rival &lt;a href=\"El%20Salvador\"&gt;Salvadorian&lt;/a&gt; gang Marabunta Grande over the &lt;a href=\"Drugs\"&gt;drug&lt;/a&gt; trade, drug trafficking, supply routes, and weapons smuggling in the &lt;a href=\"Senora%20Desert\"&gt;Senora Desert&lt;/a&gt; region and parts of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; also reported that there was a recent shootout between the two gangs in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Senora%20Desert\"&gt;Grand Senora Desert&lt;/a&gt;. The Aztecas have also been known to be heavily involved in arms dealing.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" in 2013.\nThey make an appearance in through &lt;a href=\"SecuroServ\"&gt;SecuroServ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo\"&gt;cargo&lt;/a&gt; shipments available to &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;players&lt;/a&gt; of CEO status. They are frequent adversaries and are known to steal shipments of goods intended for the player's &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organization&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey later appear as a rival gang for the &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Clubs&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Clubhouse%20Contracts\"&gt;Biker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Business%20Supplies/Steal%20Missions\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThey are first mentioned in \"GTA V\" in a internet news article from &lt;a href=\"The%20Senora%20Beacon\"&gt;The Senora Beacon&lt;/a&gt; after the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Long%20Stretch\"&gt;The Long Stretch&lt;/a&gt;, the article mentions they using the &lt;a href=\"Alamo%20Sea\"&gt;Alamo Sea&lt;/a&gt; as their base of operations and the fact that they were forced to leave Los Santos because of their war with the Vagos.\nIn the storyline, the VLA are in competition with &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Enterprises\"&gt;Trevor Philips Enterprises&lt;/a&gt; over the weapons trade in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; destroys &lt;a href=\"Ortega\"&gt;Ortega&lt;/a&gt;'s trailer, the VLA decide to take him down. Several VLA members &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Industries\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt; meth lab, but end up defeated.\nThe Aztecas also appear in Trevor's arms smuggling side mission. During the &lt;a href=\"Arms%20Trafficking%20Air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; missions, they appear in just one mission, where they are reunited in four different groups across Blaine County and need to be destroyed by Trevor using bombs dropped by a plane. During the &lt;a href=\"Arms%20Trafficking%20Ground\"&gt;land&lt;/a&gt; missions, they appear in a mission in which they try to pick up an arms package before Trevor.\nAn Azteca mugs a woman at the &lt;a href=\"Automated%20Teller%20Machine\"&gt;ATM&lt;/a&gt; during a &lt;a href=\"Random%20Events%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;random event&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"West%20Vinewood\"&gt;West Vinewood&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Contract.\nThe Aztecas make a minor appearance in update in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\". In &lt;a href=\"2021\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;, during a &lt;a href=\"South%20Central%20Leak\"&gt;South Central Leak&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Vernon\"&gt;Vernon&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"The%20Families\"&gt;The Families&lt;/a&gt; asks the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist to help him and his gang interrupt a meth deal between &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; and the Aztecas, before he helps with &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Dre\"&gt;Dr. Dre&lt;/a&gt;'s stolen phone information.\nTerritory.\nVarrios Los Aztecas members can be found in their territory east of &lt;a href=\"Central%20Los%20Santos%20Hospital\"&gt;Central Los Santos Hospital&lt;/a&gt; around Northern &lt;a href=\"Rancho\"&gt;Rancho&lt;/a&gt;. Probably, they are at war with the North Side Vagos set in the northern part of Rancho, due to the proximity of the territories. They also have territory on Blaine County, with their headquarters being the Alamo Sea. Many Aztecas drive vehicles and members are seen standing on the sidewalks in groups of 3-5. Sometimes, Aztecas will rarely spawn and be replaced by Los Santos Vagos. To prevent this, try approaching Rancho from the north instead of the south.\nGang Appearance.\nAztecas can be easily identified by their light teal/turquoise coloured cholo-style clothing. Their weapons of choice include &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Micro-SMG\"&gt;Micro-SMG&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"SMG\"&gt;SMG&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Knife\"&gt;knives&lt;/a&gt;. Even though they dress similarly to some members of the Marabunta Grande, Aztecas do not sport face tattoos unlike their rivals.\nInfluence.\nIt is likely that the Aztecas are based on various gangs such as the due to their location \u2013 Northern Rancho \u2013 which is based on Florence, as well as given their name. Their long-running rivalry with the Vagos is similar to the rivalry between Clanton 14 and due to the fact that the former did not let Central Americans into their gang which resulted to the creation of the latter and their bloody rivalry. Despite this, the Aztecas are likely based on the South and East Los Angeles-based 18th Street gang, due to both gangs repping blue: turquoise for Aztecas and navy blue for 18th Street. Along with 18th Street's historic and bloody beef with , likely being the influence for the Azteca-Marabunta Grande beef, which is said to have been long running as well, 18th Street also have beef with gangs, such as Florencia 13 and , which is likely the influence for the Azteca-Vagos rivalry, as the Vagos are based on the Sure\u00f1os."}

The station is immediately close to the &lt;a href=\"Linen%20Lounge\"&gt;Linen Lounge&lt;/a&gt;, which is at the same block as &lt;a href=\"Club%20Liberty\"&gt;Club Liberty&lt;/a&gt;.

This is due to the fact that the Algonquin Inner and Bohan Lines' Frankfort Low station is located at intersection of Wardite Street and Frankfort Avenue: north of Vauxite, the Algonquin Outer Line runs east along Wardite Street to East Holland, so it has to pass underneath the Algonquin Inner and Bohan Lines to accommodate for the latter lines' station.\nIn \"GTA IV\", &lt;a href=\"North%20Holland%20Hustlers\"&gt;North Holland Hustlers&lt;/a&gt; can be seen around the station, whereas in , the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt; can be seen instead. \nInfluence.\nThe station and its surroundings are based on the popular in .

The headlights seem to be taken from the facelifted 2019 RC F, with a layout that is similar to that of the , while the lower part of the grille seems to be inspired by the . The side vents are derived from the . The rear fascia, though entirely similar to the RC F, has a trunk design taken from the , while the tail lights are borrowed from the , albeit in a thinner form. \nDesign.\nThe Vectre assumes a grand tourer-like two-door coupe design with a modern and sporty appearance. The design is a blend of smooth, flowing body lines around the side and rear profile, and more aggressive features in the front end. \nThe interior and dial set are shared with cars like the &lt;a href=\"FMJ\"&gt;FMJ&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tempesta\"&gt;Tempesta&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Toros\"&gt;Toros&lt;/a&gt;, with the carbon paddle shifts derived from the last two cars. Similar to the &lt;a href=\"Jester%20RR\"&gt;Jester RR&lt;/a&gt;, the interior itself is a white/paintable variation of the aforementioned cars, and bears the manufacturer emblem on the horn cap. The rear seats are implemented in a similar way to their real-life counterpart; however, they are unusable in-game.\nThe primary color of the vehicle is applied on the bodywork and the engine cam covers, while the secondary color is applied on the brake calipers. A trim color is also available for most of the interior, the horn cap and the overstitches, as well as a dial color. It uses a set of ten-spoke rims with additional angled spokes finished in black, wrapped in low-profile tires. These rims can also support a dedicated color, although only naturally-generated examples may have one.\nPerformance.\nThe Vectre has excellent acceleration off the line, but quickly loses momentum and does not reach a very high top speed. To counter this, it displays very good handling and impressive stability through corners, easily being able to outmaneuver other cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Jester%20RR\"&gt;Jester RR&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Euros\"&gt;Euros&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Vectre is also a very heavy car. Combined with the average brakes, this can lead to understeer during hard braking and through very sharp, low-speed corners. While easy to drive from the get-go, to really get the most out of the Vectre, consistency and careful management of momentum is required.\nThe Vectre is powered by a low-burbling V8 engine, coupled to an 8-speed gearbox in a front-engine, four-wheel-drive configuration (30% front, 70% rear). Its engine sound is shared with the &lt;a href=\"XA-21\"&gt;XA-21&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Jugular\"&gt;Jugular&lt;/a&gt;."}

When exporting them, the player can sell 1 to 4 vehicles at a time depending on the number of associates the player has in their CEO Organization in the session. There are also collections of vehicles that can be sold together, retrieving and successfully exporting the vehicles that complete a collection will offer bonus payments made to not only the CEO but to the associates as well.\nVehicle cargo missions can be conducted in Public or Invite Only sessions. Completing Vehicle Cargo missions unlocks the \"&lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicle%20Work\"&gt;Special Vehicle Work&lt;/a&gt;\" missions; every fourth car successfully warehoused will unlock one of the eight special missions available. In order to unlock all of them, 32 cars must be warehoused.\nWhen sourcing vehicle cargo or when exporting it, the rest of the players in session will receive a message alerting them of the organization moving vehicle cargo, once the global signal countdown is over. The vehicle cargo will be represented then by a blinking red car in the map.\nIf another player not belonging to the organization gets in one of the cars, they can bring it to a police station and earn $5000 in cash, or bring it to their warehouse if they have one and are currently registered as a CEO. In the latter case, they will have to pay for any damages, similarly to when they source a vehicle the usual way.\nSource Vehicle Cargo.\nVehicle missions are started by logging on to the desktop in the office, selecting Vehicle Cargo option and clicking on the source vehicle button. The vehicle will range from top range to standard range randomly. Once a vehicle is sourced, a text message with the info of the vehicle and a picture will be sent to the player via text message on their in-game phone and the &lt;a href=\"Assistant\"&gt;Assistant&lt;/a&gt; will call the player to describe the task on exit from the office. \nObstacles will present themselves to the player, as they go for the vehicle with different scenarios randomly being used. When delivering a vehicle, NPCs may pursue the player and open fire or the player may become &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted&lt;/a&gt; by the police. The player should attempt to keep the car in good condition to avoid high repair costs to maintain the mission profitability. The maximum amount a repair can cost is &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;34,000. Once the damage bill reaches $34,000 it will not increase in value but the vehicle can continue to receive further physical damage until it is eventually destroyed, resulting in mission failure.\nIf the player is split from the rest of the players in the lobby (i.e. network lag leaves the player alone in a public lobby), ends up being the last player in the session, or has a second player join and then leave the session while in the process of delivering a vehicle to the warehouse, it will suffer spontaneous combustion and be destroyed several seconds later (giving the player a short window in which to escape), failing the mission. If the player is close to their warehouse and can reach it in time before the car explodes, the cargo will be saved, but the mounting damage from the flames will result in a hefty repair cost.\nThere is a cooldown of two and a half minutes between vehicle retrieval missions which starts once the player has successfully delivered the vehicle to the warehouse or fails the delivery.\nTarget Vehicles.\nThere are a total of 32 different vehicles to be stolen, with 3 possible variations (plates, colors and modification combinations) of each vehicle, one* of which will fit into the Collection Vehicle Cargo.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nTop=\nMid=\nStandard=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nImport Tips.\nVehicle warehouses have a capacity of 40 cars and there are 32 individual models available to import. Target vehicles are randomly selected from the list of 32 but will not double up until the player has stored one of each of the 32 models. Players can take advantage of this.\nExporting Vehicles.\nSelling vehicles is pretty straight forward. After the player has delivered a vehicle to the warehouse they can sell it right away. The player must go to the &lt;a href=\"Ad-Hawk%20Autos\"&gt;Ad-Hawk Autos&lt;/a&gt; website on the computer located in the vehicle warehouse office and selecting 1 to 4 vehicles to sell or a collection if the player has completed a collection.\nSelling vehicles can profit the player, in summary, between $15,000 and $80,000 per vehicle, depending on vehicle class. This does not include additional bonuses. These are subject to change during special events, such as 2x GTA$ events.\nVehicle Cargo Collections.\nSome buyers will request a collection of cars with certain license plates and modifications. Players will be able to export all cars in the collection upon completing the collection as long as they have enough members in their organization. By exporting collections, players will be awarded with a bonus on top of the regular commission."}

For the CEO to get bonuses for all cars, they need to take them from associates and drop them off themselves."}

Once the player nears the vehicle, these guards will turn hostile.\nAfter the player takes a guarded car, pursuing attackers may spawn in pairs, usually in &lt;a href=\"Schafter%20V12%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;Schafter V12 (Armored)&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;s. \nCar Bomb=\nSometimes an otherwise simple unguarded vehicle target will alert the player upon entry that there is a bomb in the vehicle. The player has 20 seconds to accelerate to a target speed (90 Km/h) and must maintain that speed for a cumulative 2 minutes to allow SecuroServ to remotely defuse the bomb before returning the vehicle to their warehouse. If the player drops below the target speed, the 20 second bomb timer will resume. After 1 minute, the assistant will text message encouragement to keep it up. No NPC attackers will be present in these cases. Using a &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the vehicle (not always possible, depending on where it's parked) prevents the car bomb from being armed and bypasses that part of the mission.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nAmateur Thief.\nThe Assistant will advise that the vehicle is parked but upon arrival the player will discover that the vehicle is mobile and will be informed that an amateur thief has beaten them to it. There will be a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; and several police vehicles pursuing the car. Once the scenario starts when the target starts moving, players have 15 minutes to steal the vehicle, but an on-screen notification will only appear for the last 5 minutes. Engaging the NPC driver or police with gunfire or stealing the car will immediately give the player a 3 star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Wanted Level&lt;/a&gt; and they must lose this before reaching the warehouse. They can choose to attempt to lose the wanted level, or they can call &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; to lose the cops. If the player retains the wanted level when nearing the warehouse, the stars will be reduced to 1 star.\nOnce the wanted level is evaded or removed, this mission doesn't result in any further pursuing attackers.\nDetective Work.\nThe location of the car is unknown but the last known location will be sent to the player by text. The picture will show an obvious landmark, the player must travel to that location and steal the car. On the way back to the warehouse, the vehicle will normally be reported stolen and the player will gain a 1-3 star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; which must be evaded before the vehicle can be delivered.\nMobile Vehicles.\nMobile vehicle missions are simply about stealing a vehicle which is being driven by its owner. There is a 15 minute time limit from the time the player leaves their office in which the player must steal the target vehicle. The NPC target will not simply stop as a result of the player blocking the road. The NPC will stop for traffic lights though, and can be car-jacked at that point. Their path may not encounter any red lights within the time limit allowed, so the player must then shoot the driver. A wanted level may be earned after taking possession of the vehicle. After stealing it, there is no time limit for the delivery to the warehouse. \nIf the 15 minute timer expires, the mission will fail but the target vehicle will continue to be driven. It can still be car-jacked but the player can do nothing with it after that.\nKey.\nThe assistant will inform the player that they are robbing an arms dealer/warlord and the player is required to gain an electronic key to unlock the target vehicle. The vehicle will be located in a garage or porch of a mansion and the property will be guarded with armed security. Only one of the guards will have the key which unlocks the vehicle. The player can either attack or can use stealth tactics and silenced weapons, reducing the amount of resistance. Once the key is found, the player will automatically unlock the car and can drive away.\nIf the player managed to avoid alerting security, no pursuers will spawn. If security was alerted while obtaining the key, then pursuing attackers typically spawn in up to 3 waves of matte-black &lt;a href=\"SuperVolito%20Carbon\"&gt;SuperVolito Carbon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Schafter%20V12%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;Schafter V12 (Armored)&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOversights.\nThe Sam Austin Drive location may be impossible to complete undetected if the guard holding the key is the one standing in front of the tennis court. Killing him will seemingly spook the party-goers on the court and alert the security, regardless of whether the player used suppressors or if the other guards were eliminated.\nCar Meet.\nSome target vehicles may spawn at &lt;a href=\"Street%20Racers\"&gt;Street Racers&lt;/a&gt;' car meets with around 6 other cars. This means attacking via air is not suitable as the risk of blowing up the target vehicle is higher. At the meet, other highly modified cars and lowriders are parked, such as the &lt;a href=\"Virgo%20Classic%20Custom\"&gt;Virgo Classic Custom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer%20Custom\"&gt;Buccaneer Custom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Futo\"&gt;Futo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the cars will have their hoods open and/or use hydraulics while the owners inspect the cars and take pictures. The Street Racers in the car meet are armed with a range of weapons, usually sub machine guns or automatic pistols. Once the player gets near the meet, they will open fire. If the protagonist chooses to begin attacking from afar with a sniper rifle, up to two sets of NPCs will attempt to enter vehicles and, if not stopped, will drive to where the player is located unless the player leaves the position before they get there.\nWhen taking the car back to the warehouse, more modified cars will pursue, vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Pisswasser%20Dominator\"&gt;Pisswasser Dominator&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Futo\"&gt;Futo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20RS\"&gt;Sultan RS&lt;/a&gt;. These &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas\"&gt;Varrios Los Aztecas&lt;/a&gt; attackers are armed with &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt;s. \nThe car meets can be in numerous locations, typically the &lt;a href=\"Palmer-Taylor%20Power%20Station\"&gt;Palmer-Taylor Power Station&lt;/a&gt; or on &lt;a href=\"Eclipse%20Boulevard\"&gt;Eclipse Boulevard&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeist Crew.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Assistant\"&gt;Assistant&lt;/a&gt; sometimes finds a \"professional-looking heist crew\", where the target vehicle among other vehicles is being towed away on &lt;a href=\"Barge\"&gt;barges&lt;/a&gt; by a &lt;a href=\"Tug%20%28boat%29\"&gt;Tug&lt;/a&gt; boat out at sea. When the player leaves the office, they are told to steal a &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; from a specific location, &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Labs%20and%20Research\"&gt;Humane Labs and Research&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zancudo%20Treatment%20Works\"&gt;Zancudo Treatment Works&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Headquarters\"&gt;NOOSE Headquarters&lt;/a&gt; facility. At these facilities, the player is given up to a 3 star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, and around 6 guards will shoot - either &lt;a href=\"Military\"&gt;Military&lt;/a&gt; units or &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; units depending on the location. The player doesn't necessarily need to steal this specific Cargobob marked on the map - if the player owns a Cargobob and calls one from &lt;a href=\"Pegasus\"&gt;Pegasus&lt;/a&gt; or their &lt;a href=\"Hangars\"&gt;hangar,&lt;/a&gt; or if they find one on a helipad, this objective will be skipped upon entry, and the player simply has to go to the marked destination where the vehicle is, out at sea. When the Cargobob is obtained, they will need to fly out to the floats and hook onto the target vehicle. 3 armed guards are on each float and will fire at the helicopter when the player gets relatively close to the area. The tug boat isn't moving, meaning the car isn't going to escape or flee. If the Cargobob is destroyed, however, the mission fails and the props and the target vehicle de-spawn. The locations next to islands allow the player to land the Cargobob and snipe the guards, making the hook-up task safer. From the time the player collects the Cargobob, they have 15 minutes to successfully hook onto the target vehicle. An onscreen countdown timer appears with 5 minutes remaining.\nOnce the car is hooked onto, up to 4 pairs of &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;s will spawn and fire their miniguns at the Cargobob and target vehicle, causing a large amount of damage. The experience of the pilots is significantly bad compared to normal NPCs, where they often crash into buildings and trees. The next pair will spawn if both are evaded or destroyed. \nThe player can release the target vehicle whenever they are back over the mainland and drive it back to the warehouse. It is not compulsory to airlift it all the way; however, the player has a time limit of 20 minutes from first hooking onto the car to deliver the vehicle. A countdown is again shown on screen when the player has 5 minutes remaining to complete the delivery.\nOversights.\nBetween the and updates, this mission was removed, due to a bug where in the sourced car spawns in the water, underneath the barge. This resulted in an instant mission failure as the target car was destroyed. The mission has since been reinstated.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nCargobob Locations=\nTug Boat/Barge Locations=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nRace Bet.\nThe only legal mission involves winning a race bet. The target has set a target time on a point-to-point that he claims is \"unbeatable\". When the vehicle is sourced, the player needs to get to the start line marked on the map in a suitable land vehicle. A carbon-black &lt;a href=\"Elegy%20RH8\"&gt;Elegy RH8&lt;/a&gt; spawns at all start lines. Once the player is at the start line, a 3 second starting line countdown begins and then the destination and target time are revealed. They must beat the race time in order to get the vehicle located at the finish line.\nSimilar to the &lt;a href=\"Time%20Trials\"&gt;Time Trials&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events\"&gt;Freemode Events&lt;/a&gt;, there are no checkpoints and the player does not have to follow the prescribed route to the finish line, although generally there are few viable shortcuts that can be taken.\nIf the player doesn't make it to the finish line before the time runs out the player will fail the mission. The vehicle will not de-spawn if the player got within sight of the finish, but it will catch fire and be unable to be taken.\nAt the finish line, numerous people are cheering on the player, while the target vehicle is guarded by the Street Racer owner. Regardless of the deal, the owner will still attempt to attack the player with a &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Bat\"&gt;Baseball Bat&lt;/a&gt;. The car is now free to be taken. Once on the way back to the warehouse the player will be pursued by up to 4 pairs of &lt;a href=\"Street%20Racers\"&gt;Street Racers&lt;/a&gt; in their imitation \"Fast and Furious\" liveries, such as orange and black or red &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20900R\"&gt;Banshee 900R&lt;/a&gt;s and red or limegreen &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20RS\"&gt;Sultan RS&lt;/a&gt;'s, with gang members armed with &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPhoto Shoot.\nThe target vehicle may sometimes be involved in a photography shoot. The vehicle will be found at a notable location and will be surrounded by a security team with silver &lt;a href=\"Sadler\"&gt;Sadler&lt;/a&gt;s, photographers and models. When the vehicle is located, it is advised to use a &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; helicopter and land near the shoot's setting, taking out the security guards on ground and then pick up the vehicle with the helicopter. When delivering to the warehouse, up to 3 waves of NPCs in matte-black &lt;a href=\"SuperVolito%20Carbon\"&gt;SuperVolito Carbons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Schafter%20V12%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;Schafter V12s (Armored)&lt;/a&gt; may pursue the player and guards in the rear passenger seats of the helicopters will shoot. \nMovie Stunt.\nThe target vehicle can sometimes be involved in a movie production. At the site of the vehicle, a stunt ramp, usually with a ring of fire, will be laid out in front of the vehicle ready for filming. The player can take out the guards or avoid them altogether and steal the car. Taking the guards out using stealth methods is the most successful way of aggressively completing the mission.\nIf the player uses a Cargobob and hooks onto the vehicle, the vehicle's boost will be disabled and the player will be notified. This way, the player is usually spotted given the time it may take to connect the vehicle to the helicopter's hook; however, a quick success may sometimes go completely unnoticed and result in no suspicion and no tailing goons. \nLike the photoshoot, the professional guards also have air and ground support. &lt;a href=\"SuperVolito%20Carbon\"&gt;SuperVolito Carbons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Schafter%20V12%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;Schafter V12s (Armored)&lt;/a&gt; with armed units will pursue the player after taking the car unless the player steals the vehicle without alerting security. This is most easily done by approaching from under the ramp and climbing onto the ramp in front of the target vehicle. If the assistant sends a congratulatory text message that the stunt shot was successful, there should be no pursuit. This allows the player to deliver the vehicle with minimal damage.\nClosed Circuit.\nIn this scenario, the target vehicle is running laps around a oval or circle, accompanied by seven vehicles of the same type (albeit unmodified). This mission is one of the most difficult scenarios to complete without damaging the vehicle, as the driver will not stop for obstructions and must be shot, hooked with a &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; or cornered and pulled out. If disturbed, pedestrians flee the area and all the NPC vehicles may exit the circuit, further hindering the mission and turning it into a chase.\nTraffic Stop.\nThe Assistant will advise that the owner of the target vehicle has been stopped by police (on a routine stop or for multiple DUIs) and the player should hurry and get the vehicle before it is impounded; however, there is no time limit. The vehicle will be on the roadside with 2 &lt;a href=\"Police%20Bike\"&gt;Police Bike&lt;/a&gt;s and officers. The player will gain a wanted level whether they choose to eliminate the police or not. The player must then evade or remove their wanted level before delivering the car to the warehouse.\nCrime Scene.\nThe Assistant will inform the player that the vehicle has been involved in something \"pretty nasty\" and to retrieve it from the crime scene. The vehicle will be surrounded by police guards at the scene. Stealing it will normally require elimination of Police to avoid damage to the target car. The player must then evade or remove their wanted level before delivering the car to the warehouse.\nTail.\nThe Assistant will inform the player that they do not know the location of the target vehicle, but that they know of a vehicle on the way to it. The targets are &lt;a href=\"Little%20Seoul\"&gt;Little Seoul&lt;/a&gt; gangsters. The player needs to tail an NPC driving a &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt; without being observed to the location of the target car and steal it from the &lt;a href=\"Kkangpae\"&gt;Korean gang&lt;/a&gt; protecting it. The tailed vehicle will travel at a slightly aggressive pace, overtaking traffic and running red lights.\nIf the player loses the Kuruma, the mission will fail. If the player is detected, the mission does not fail, but the tailed vehicle will travel at high speed and must now be chased to the end point and the gang members at the destination will be immediately hostile. On the way back to the warehouse NPCs should spawn in pairs of Kurumas but as of update 1.37 this appears to be bugged and the player will only encounter 1 empty pair of Kurumas en route, unless the high speed chase had been triggered in phase one, in which case the chase Kurumas will spawn normally.\nInstructional Messages.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nTail Start Locations=\nTail End Locations=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nLicense Plate Scanner.\nIf the player has another player alongside them in their Organisation, there is a chance they may have to team up to locate the target vehicle. In this unique scenario, the player must collect a Police Maverick marked on the GPS, and use its license plate scanner to scan numerous vehicles marked on the map. Once they have found the correct vehicle, they should steal the car, and take it back to the warehouse.\nThe Police Maverick may spawn at:\nStealing Other Players' Vehicle Cargo.\nThe player is also able to steal other player's vehicle cargo once the vehicle has been retrieved by the original source. The vehicle will become visible on the map for all players in the session to steal. The player will be notified that Vehicle Cargo is being transported and instructions on how to steal the vehicle.\nTypically, players are most successful at stealing vehicle cargo as it is being delivered to the warehouse, by shooting the driver and entering the vehicle. Once stolen, the player will then be instructed to either deliver it to their Vehicle Warehouse, or the nearest Police Station.\nIf the player already has that specific vehicle in their warehouse, they cannot take it into the warehouse, and only have the option of taking it to the nearest police station. If the player doesn't, they can deliver it to the warehouse and use it to sell later on. The assistant will call the player with different variations of lines congratulating the player on stealing another organization's car.\nStealing Vehicle Cargo that is being &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo/Sell%20Missions\"&gt;Exported&lt;/a&gt; will not allow the player to deliver it to their warehouse, as it is \"too hot to modify\"; i.e, another player has already modified the vehicle. An exception is when the vehicle is being exported in a collection, as the vehicle has not been modified at all. The player can, in all cases, take the vehicle to the nearest police station to receive GTA$ and RP.\nIf the player steals a vehicle while not part of an &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organization&lt;/a&gt;, they will only be prompted to deliver it to the nearest police station; however, they can register through &lt;a href=\"SecuroServ\"&gt;SecuroServ&lt;/a&gt; at any point of the delivery and take the vehicle to their warehouse. This means all players have an equal threat of stealing the player's vehicle cargo regardless of whether they are members of Organizations or Motorcycle Clubs, so being wary of this on delivery is advised.\nDepending on the circumstances, when the delivery cutscene plays, it will either display as \"You stole from an organization\" or \"You stole from [Organization]\", the former of which will show when the organization who originally sourced the vehicle have left the session before delivery.\nGeneral Instructions.\nStealing other player's Vehicle Cargo"}

Colors in \"GTA Online\" are unlocked through ranks and various other achievements and have varying prices based on their distinctiveness. \nColors are applied to vehicles in the following levels:\nGroups.\nChameleon.\n&lt;br&gt;\nOther colors.\nThe game features a total of 223 single color options, three of which were added in &lt;a href=\"Updates%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;DLCs&lt;/a&gt;, and 62 of which are Chameleon paint colors exclusive to the versions of \"GTA Online\". \nAlongside the 100+ colors the game allows players to apply to vehicles in mod shops (be it as Primary, Secondary, Pearlescent, Wheel, Trim or Accent), there are roughly 60 more colors not available in mod shops. Some of these appear as the default pearlescent option of certain Metallic colors, but cannot be reapplied if changed. Many of these appear as traffic default colors, and, like default pearlescent colors, cannot be reapplied if changed. As these colors are not available in mod shops, they do not have official in-game names and are simply referred to by their technical name and ID.\nAmong unused colors are \"Worn\" and \"Util\" color groups which have considerably less specular intensity than those of the Classic and Metallic groups, but more-so than the Matte group. These generally appear on utility, industrial and beater vehicles.\nThe table below lists all 161 colors by their technical name and ID. Colors not available in mod shops are marked \"*\". Images of vehicles with the color applied are depicted with a Black (0) pearlescent color applied.\nSlots.\nPearlescent Color.\nThe pearlescent slot can only be used when the vehicle is given a Metallic color. Upon applying a Metallic color, the vehicle will have a pearlescent color already applied (as noted in the &lt;a href=\"%23Metallic\"&gt;Metallic&lt;/a&gt; table). The player can choose from the same 75 colors available in the Classic/Metallic groups and apply them as the Metallic's pearlescent color, acting as a lustre color. Brighter pearlescent colors have greater influence over the base color.\nImages in the table below demonstrate what each of the pearlescent colors look like when applied to Metallic Black (0). The darker the base color, the greater the influence the pearlescent color has on the overall color.\nWheel Color.\nThe wheel color slot is typically applied to the wheel rim, although it may occasionally apply to other vehicle parts as well as the rim itself. Wheel color can only be changed when custom rims are applied. Some vehicles have paintable stock rims, but the color of the rim cannot be changed in mod shops and will reset to the grey Default Wheel Color (156) once the game is restarted, should the player save their vehicle in a &lt;a href=\"Garage\"&gt;Garage&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrim Color.\nThe trim color slot is typically applied to colorable interiors, initially introduced in the update. Technically, the trim color slot can be assigned any color via modification as it uses regular paint, however customization menus in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops offer 68 preset colors, shared with the regular Classic colors, with Carbon Black, Silver, Hot Pink, Formula Red, Gold, Blue and Schafter Purple excluded.\nDial/Accent Color.\nThe accent color slot is typically applied to colorable interiors, initially introduced in the update. Like trim colors, the accent color slot can technically be assigned any color via modification as it uses regular paint, however customization menus in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops offer 49 preset colors. As these colors are generally used as the dial color on cars in &lt;a href=\"Benny%27s%20Original%20Motor%20Works\"&gt;Benny's Original Motor Works&lt;/a&gt;, darker colors are not available."}

Numerous &lt;a href=\"Updates%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;updates&lt;/a&gt; have also added additional categories which are exclusive to \"GTA Online\", including the Street and Track options.

In the enhanced versions of the game, Low Grip Tires can be applied to vehicles in the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Car%20Meet\"&gt;Los Santos Car Meet&lt;/a&gt; mod shop, allowing cars to be drifted. Tires can also be given unique tire wall upgrades, with different designs for each wheel category (such as white wall tires). Finally, the player can customize the color of the smoke tires produce.\nWheel Type.\nThere are 13 Wheel Types across all customization garages, five of which are exclusive to the of \"GTA Online\":\nHigh End.\nThere are 20 High End wheel options available in both painted and chrome.\nLowrider.\nThere are 15 Lowrider wheel options available in both painted and chrome.\nMuscle.\nThere are 18 Muscle wheel options available in both painted and chrome.\nOffroad.\nThere are 25 Offroad wheel options available, with 15 exclusive to the enhanced versions of . Offroad wheels offer improved traction when applied to a vehicle. They feature high-profile tires. All rims were reworked in the update for the of the game, with new 3D tire treads and improved textures. The update also saw the addition of 15 new rim designs exclusively for .\nSport.\nThere are 25 Sport wheel options available in both painted and chrome.\nSUV.\nThere are 19 SUV wheel options available in both painted and chrome.\nTuner.\nThere are 24 Tuner wheel options available in both painted and chrome.\nBike.\nThere are 36 Bike wheel options available, with 23 exclusive to the enhanced versions of . All bike wheel options have a separate front and rear wheel model. Only motorcycles can be fitted with Bike wheels, and only certain motorcycles allow the rear wheel to be customized. The update saw the addition of 23 new rim designs.\nBenny's Originals.\nThere are 31 Benny's Originals wheel options available. These were added in the update and are exclusive to the enhanced versions of \"GTA Online\". They can only be applied to vehicles at &lt;a href=\"Benny%27s%20Original%20Motor%20Works\"&gt;Benny's Original Motor Works&lt;/a&gt;.\nBenny's Bespoke.\nThere are 31 Benny's Bespoke wheel options available.

Race wheels offer six different Tire Design options.\nStreet.\nThere are 30 Street wheel options available. They were introduced in the update for the of the game. Street wheels offer six different Tire Design options.\nTrack.\nThere are 30 Street wheel options available. They were introduced in the update for the of the game. Track wheels offer six different Tire Design options. Some of these are only unlocked once the player has reached a specific &lt;a href=\"Reputation%20%28LS%20Car%20Meet%29\"&gt;Reputation&lt;/a&gt; level at the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Car%20Meet\"&gt;Los Santos Car Meet&lt;/a&gt;.\nWheel Color.\nThere are 41 wheel colors available, including the default \"Alloy\" color. The majority of these colors are named the same as the Classic/Metallic Colors found in the Primary, Secondary, Pearl and Tertiary slots; however, many of the actual colors applied to the wheel are not the same as those applied to vehicle bodywork, and many of the colors are in fact unique colors not available for other respray options.\nThe respray option is only available for custom wheels and cannot be applied to stock wheels. Chrome wheels cannot be resprayed.\nAlthough the player cannot respray stock wheels, a number of vehicles which can spawn in traffic have colorable stock wheels; however, the majority of these vehicles spawn only with the \"default alloy\" color. The remaining few which may spawn in traffic with colored wheels include the &lt;a href=\"Bati%20801\"&gt;Bati 801&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Futo\"&gt;Futo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hakuchou\"&gt;Hakuchou&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Phoenix\"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ruffian\"&gt;Ruffian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vader\"&gt;Vader&lt;/a&gt;. Changing the wheels of these vehicles may result in losing the original color and the stock wheel color cannot be changed thereafter. \nOther vehicles' wheels may be colored with the Primary, Secondary or other slots, allowing some, albeit limited, vehicles to have their stock wheels resprayed. These include the &lt;a href=\"Autarch\"&gt;Autarch&lt;/a&gt; (partially), &lt;a href=\"Half-track\"&gt;Half-track&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hakuchou\"&gt;Hakuchou&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up%20Custom\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up Custom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neon\"&gt;Neon&lt;/a&gt; (partially), &lt;a href=\"Roosevelt\"&gt;Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ruston\"&gt;Ruston&lt;/a&gt; (partially), &lt;a href=\"X80%20Proto\"&gt;X80 Proto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zentorno\"&gt;Zentorno&lt;/a&gt;. This does not affect any custom wheels applied to these vehicles, as custom wheels share color settings across all vehicle models.\nTires.\nIn the original versions of the game, Custom Tires, Bulletproof Tires and Tire Smoke are found under one sub category of the Wheel category, named 'Wheel Accessories'. After the update for the of the game, these options were moved to a sub category named 'Tires', with categories for 'Tire Design' (custom tires), 'Tire Enhancements' (Bulletproof Tires) and 'Tire Smoke' within it.\nTire Design.\nCustom Tires will apply tire lettering to the current rim and is only available on aftermarket rims. The style of lettering depends on the wheel category:"}
{"id": "29233", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=29233", "title": "Vehicle Damage", "text": "Vehicle Damage is a fundamental aspect in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series. The ability to damage and destroy vehicles has been featured in every \"GTA\" game, providing a degree of realism and challenge to the player.\nDescription.\nThroughout the series, most vehicles are susceptible to damage from the environment, typically in the form of crashes, gunfire, or other external forces, providing a certain degree of realism and illustrating the vulnerability of vehicles in the series. If a vehicle is damaged enough, it can burst into flames and explode afterwards, rendering it useless. As the series progresses, the variety of damage increases, offering additional ways in which vehicles can be destroyed. In addition, the manner in which damage is depicted in-game has changed as newer &lt;a href=\"Physics%20Engine\"&gt;game engines&lt;/a&gt; are used.\nDamage resistance should be considered when selecting a vehicle for a task. The high performance of certain vehicles may be offset by a weaker body, while a slow, heavy vehicle may be far more resilient to damage. If a player is not proficient in driving or has not properly planned their path to their destination, choosing a vehicle may become a hindrance if the player is trying to complete a mission within a time limit or escaping from pursuers.\nCertain missions and tricks throughout the series can create a damage-resistant vehicle, which include resistance to bullets, explosions, physical collisions, and fire. Tanks and certain armored vehicles are also naturally highly resistant to damage and are invulnerable to certain forms of destructive forces, such as collisions.\nBehaviour.\n2D Universe.\nVehicles in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\" can be destroyed via high speed crashes, gunfire from firearms and drops into water, features which are still present in all later games. The games are also capable of accurately visualizing portions of vehicles which are damaged using ; each vehicle is divided into sections that are visually represented as either undamaged or damaged: \"GTA\" features six such sections (on four corners and two sides) and \"GTA 2\" has four (on four corners).\nUnlike the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; games (excluding popped tyres), a vehicle's performance degrades as its damage is increasingly severe. For \"GTA\", the only hint to this is an increasingly louder clunking engine noise; in \"GTA 2\" the clutch of the vehicle breaks, making the vehicle produce a loud chattering sound as it drives. A fire may start in the middle of the vehicle, which grows with increased damage or on its own over time.\n3D Universe.\nBy \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", vehicles are far more sensitive to damage, as parts can show signs of damage with the slightest collision, as well as high speed collisions with &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt;. However, the performance of vehicles remains unaffected from damage, and imminent destruction of vehicles is represented by a burning engine. If a vehicle is flipped over, its engine will also burst into flames and result in the vehicle exploding (presumably because of a fuel leak).\n\"GTA III\"s visual representation of vehicle damage improved in complexity. The engine may now emit smoke, providing a gauge on how much endurance a vehicle has left before it catches fire. Most road vehicles in the game are also constructed from separate models representing minor parts of the vehicle (doors, frontal quarter panels/headlights and bumpers) around a central \"core\" (the wheels, engine, chassis and body of vehicles). The damage system of vehicles represents the minor vehicle parts as undamaged, damaged or missing, based on collisions detected on the vehicle; the core of each vehicle remains visually unchanged despite heavy damage. &lt;a href=\"Boat\"&gt;Boat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Airplanes\"&gt;aircraft&lt;/a&gt;, however, will not show signs of damage until they are on the verge of exploding.\nBetween \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\", various improvements and refinements were made on \"GTA III\"s damage engine:\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\", which uses an independent top-down game engine, possesses a vehicle damage engine largely similar to that of \"GTA\" and \"GTA 2\", except that large vehicles (i.e. buses and trucks) may also face the risk of rolling over when cornering at high speeds.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nFor \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", vehicle damage has improved significantly. Imminent destruction is now represented by either a burning engine, a burning fuel tank or both, and clunking engine noises are reintroduced for vehicles with damaged engines. Alternately, the engines of severely damaged vehicles may simply be cut off (this can be rectified by calling any number on the player's &lt;a href=\"mobile%20phone\"&gt;mobile phone&lt;/a&gt;); in addition, vehicles no longer catch fire and explode when they are flipped. If a car the player is not driving falls from a sufficient height, it may explode upon impact with the ground.\nInstead of individually modelled parts in various stages of damage, \"GTA IV\" uses a more flexible damage engine that allows any part of a vehicle's body to flex and distort based on the force and direction of an impact; the body of boats and helicopters may now be damaged in this manner, while motorcycles still cannot. Players can flatten or crush any vehicle using extreme force and explosions can severely damage a vehicle's bodywork. In addition, should a road vehicle sustain severe frontal or rear damage, its axle may also bend to a point where it can no longer function, locking and dragging its wheel along the ground as the vehicle moves, greatly affecting performance. A similar effect is caused if a wheel arch is damaged to the point where it will buckle the wheel. The wheels can also crook, causing the car to pull to one side while driving, making driving in a straight line more difficult.\nOther minor damages were added in the game. Individual lights (including those on motorbikes) and windows can be broken. Opened doors can be broken off by forcing them against another solid object (as doors are now registered as solid objects). Scrapes, scratches and bullet holes are added as minute damages. Punctured tires will deflate and eventually disintegrate, leaving the wheel rim exposed, decreasing traction significantly. Tyre puncturing is achieved by shooting the tyre itself, and bursting them can be done by either driving on deflated tyres for an extensive period of time, or by wheel-spinning constantly. Tyres will also burst when the vehicle is burnt out or fire spreads onto them. Vehicle parts, particularly bumpers, may also hang off, causing them to scrape as indicated by sparks and sounds, and will only break off once completely damaged in a major collision.\nVehicle occupants can now be more reliably killed, as car windows are properly modeled. The first shot will shatter an aimed-at window, and the next shot will pass through the new opening and damage anyone it hits accordingly. Some vehicles are equipped with bulletproof windows which don't shatter. This, along with the ability to aim from a car, makes drive-bys and vehicle chasing far more deadly, as players and NPCs can simply aim for cars' windows and reliably and quickly kill anyone inside. Vehicles' front windshields are also slightly more bullet-resistant than side windows, and front windshields will not shatter instantly.\n\"GTA IV\" also introduces dirt and other stains. Blood from pedestrians (either by shooting them in, on or near the vehicle, or running them down while in the vehicle) may remain on the bodywork, as well as mud and dirt in grassy and muddy areas. This can all be washed off using the car wash.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn \"\", the damage system reverts to that of games prior to \"GTA IV\", limiting visual damage to ajar doors and hood and trunk lids, and smoke or fire from the engine. If a vehicle sustained critical damage but is not in the verge of exploding, sparks can be seen coming out of the engine as well. In addition to this, the vehicle will show a noticeable vibration and a subtle clunking sound can be heard. Vehicles are now certain to explode after sufficient damage, and the player will also be set alight when a vehicle they have damaged heavily ignites. Flipped vehicles will also explode in the same manner as they did prior to \"GTA IV\".\nIt is possible to destroy helicopters with cars using ramps in \"GTA Chinatown Wars\" but it will immediately set the vehicle on fire and explode.\nIn \"GTA Chinatown Wars\", &lt;a href=\"Baggage%20Handler\"&gt;Baggage Handler&lt;/a&gt; drivers, when killed with a melee weapon, &lt;a href=\"Chainsaw\"&gt;Chainsaw&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Teaser\"&gt;Teaser&lt;/a&gt;, will continuously press the gas pedal with their foot causing the vehicle to accelerate, even if it was stopped when the player was killing them.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nVehicle damage in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" remains largely similar to \"GTA IV\", but features some differences and new features.\nPerhaps the biggest difference of all is the integrity of vehicle bodies. Vehicles' bodies are now much more rigid in comparison to \"GTA IV\", and deformation of the greenhouse area in particular is now limited compared to \"GTA IV\".\nLike in \"GTA IV\", individual parts can be broken off easily. Bumpers typically hang off after a collision, however front bumpers in particular remain relatively firm and usually fully attached in heavy collisions to simulate the effectiveness of bumper deformation. Front fenders and quarter panels can also be detached completely in the event of a collision\nSome vehicles feature entire clams of bodywork, such as the &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20R\"&gt;Turismo R&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Osiris\"&gt;Osiris&lt;/a&gt;, which will break off in a similar manner to front-hinged hoods on heavy duty vehicles; in the first event of a crash, the clam will typically become loose and show signs of detachment, and will eventually break open if another collision occurs.\nLike \"GTA IV\", individual lights and windows can be broken, however with the addition of glass shards, small fractures of glass will remain around the borders of windows and around emergency light bars.\nWheels can now come off if a vehicle is hit with enough force, while axles can also bend from side on collisions, causing camber, and majorly affecting steering and sometimes cause wheel lockup, reducing speed, the ability to steer at all, and eventually cause the tyres to burst.\nScratches are more visible and appear for longer compared to \"GTA IV\", and are much more sensitive, as colliding with other vehicles or simply touching them is likely to cause scratch marks.\nLike in \"GTA IV\", many glass particles will be displayed in heavy collisions where windows are broken, along with sparks.\n&lt;a href=\"Involuntary%20Ejection\"&gt;Ejection&lt;/a&gt; through the windscreen is less common in \"GTA V\". However, it causes much more severe damage to the player than in the previous game, often killing them outright.\nAs with \"GTA IV\" games, engine performance degrades with increased damage to the engine compartment. However, like \"GTA IV\", a larger engine damage value means engine performance after each collision is more variable and based heavily on how severe the collision was.\nA notable point of engine damage is distinguished by the sound of what appears to be engine camshaft and crankshaft damage, where a \"rattle\" will be heard, commonly after letting off the throttle. Eventually, and commonly heard after remaining still, a small but noticeable \"hiss\" can eventually be heard, which corresponds with the vehicle's temperature gauge in the enhanced version of the game, indicating overheating.\nLarger collisions will also damage the vehicle's oil-sump and eventually let oil spill from underneath the car; small drips of oil will be shown underneath the engine bay and will drip more quickly as the oil level runs out. A vehicle without oil will then stall, cut out and will not start again, and the vehicle will be rendered unusable.\nFor the first time, fuel makes an appearance in \"GTA V\". While fuel plays no major role in how vehicles behave, and vehicles do not have to be refilled, fuel can spill from vehicles, eventually causing them to run out and stall. This can happen when the rear left quarter panel is shot enough times, or the fuel tank on larger trucks. When shooting just in front of the rear wheel, where the fuel tank usually is, fuel can be seen and heard dribbling out underneath, and will cause a fuel trail when driving. The fuel gauge inside the vehicle (in the enhanced version of the game) will also decrease until there is no fuel left, and the fuel light will display. As the vehicle almost runs out completely, the car will slow down and appear to \"malfunction\", jerky behavior from the accelerator and, if slow enough, often slipping into reverse. After the fuel light displays, the vehicle will then be cut out. The fuel trail can be shot and will ignite, bursting into flames. If the flames reach the fuel tank, it will explode the car, however if there is no fuel left in the vehicle and the fuel trail disappears, the car will not explode.\nIn both \"GTA IV\" and \"GTA V\", depending on the size and speed of the vehicle, if the player crashes into a &lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;civilian's&lt;/a&gt; vehicle, the civilian can be killed on impact. The fatal impact is depicted when either the NPC's head hits the horn and it goes off (sometimes they leave their foot on the gas pedal and the car keeps moving) or they slump on the car seat. It is also possible to incapacitate passengers, who will slump against the dashboard, but for the driver to survive the impact, who will then attempt to hastily drive away. In \"GTA IV\", if the player hits a beater, a &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20%28car%29\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt; (on some occasions), the NPC and car will catch fire and the car will explode.\nCars will instantly explode if the engine or fuel tank is subjected to a very heavy impact with the terrain, typically after falling from a great height and landing nose-down. This is always fatal to the player, should they not &lt;a href=\"Bail%20Out\"&gt;bail out&lt;/a&gt; in time. Landing a vehicle on its wheels after a great fall will avoid an explosion and usually causes only minor damage to the vehicle, depending on how clean the landing was.\nMotorbikes are a lot more vulnerable compared to previous games in the series, and can explode should a heavy enough vehicle run over them.\nIn \"GTA V\" the &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; tank returns again, and still has the ability to blow up cars on impact. Unlike previous generations, the Rhino usually needs to drive over vehicles to make them explode, whereas simply ramming them will usually just incapacitate the occupants. If the player drives over a car with the Rhino, the car will be crushed and will usually explode, but the Rhino itself will also explode after taking enough damage. It is also possible for the Rhino to break wheels off cars if it rolls over them fast enough to prevent the car from exploding.\nAircraft Damage.\nAircraft damage has improved in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\". As with any other type of vehicle in the game, the airplane's fuselage and wings will dent and deform based on the direction and force of an impact, although the wreckage from a large airplane, such as &lt;a href=\"Jet\"&gt;Jet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cargo%20Plane\"&gt;Cargo Plane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;, is quite unrealistic. The rudder, ailerons and elevators of a plane are vulnerable to damage, and can be shot off by other attacking aircraft or knocked off by collisions, impairing or even disabling the aircraft's ability to fly properly - for example, should the rudder be removed from a plane, it will be impossible to turn it in a specific direction without using the elevators and ailerons (should they remain) together, and the plane will drift either to the left or right uncontrollably.\nIf an airplane has taken a large amount of damage (from gunfire, collisions, etc.), the airplane's engine may sputter and die in mid-air, and the airplane will plummet to the ground. During this time, there will be a brief loss of power and the airplane's controls will become less responsive and more unpredictable. This can be indicated by dark black smoke coming from the engines. In the case of dual propulsion aircraft (such as the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;), one of the engines can die with damage, and the active one starts smoking until it dies too, due to the over-revving.\nPropeller-driven aircraft such as the &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20800\"&gt;Cuban 800&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Velum\"&gt;Velum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mammatus\"&gt;Mammatus&lt;/a&gt; can suffer broken propellers from contact with solid objects for a prolonged period of time, or during collisions; in the case of multi-engined propeller aircraft, this leads to the plane banking towards the side the disabled engine is on through asymmetric thrust.\nEngine failures also behave realistically with aircraft with multiple engines mounted on the wings such as the &lt;a href=\"Jet\"&gt;Jet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;. Should one or more engines fail on only one particular side of the aircraft, the resulting thrust imbalance will result in the plane banking in the same direction as the side the failed engine is on, requiring use of the rudder and ailerons to keep the plane level. Despite this, the loss of all engines doesn't necessarily mean the aircraft is doomed; it is possible for every plane in the game to glide without engine power for varying distances, allowing the player to land the aircraft safely if there is enough room to do so.\nLanding gear can be detached with enough force with any terrain, making landings and take-offs far more hazardous, if not flat-out crippling the aircraft's hydraulics. Aircraft and wheeled helicopters can pop tires with bullets, although this very rarely happens in-game. If an aircraft suffers burst tyres, the aircraft will be harder to turn when on the ground.\nUnlike &lt;a href=\"helicopters\"&gt;helicopters&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;GTA IV&lt;/a&gt;\", which can lose the tail or the main rotor if those areas are hit with enough force, helicopters in \"GTA V\" are less likely to lose their tail but can often be crippled; if a helicopter's tail rotor has taken enough damage, usually by gunfire, it can fail, resulting in tailspin and eventually leading to the helicopter's doom.\nIf the player lands a helicopter too suddenly, they may damage the engines. This is revealed by having smoke pouring out of the air intakes. If the engine takes too much damage, fire will erupt from the air intakes as well."}

These provide defense against enemies, often playing a vital role in storyline missions. Some examples require an additional passenger to operate the weapons, while many can be operated single-handedly.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" expands upon the collection of vehicles with mounted weapons, particularly with the introduction of battle-themed DLCs and the series of &lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicles%20%28Import/Export%29\"&gt;Special Vehicles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicles\"&gt;Weaponized Vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. Since the update, vehicle weapons can be added and/or replaced via customization on specialized vehicle workshops.\nEngines.\nEngines are prominent mechanical machines used to power vehicles using multiple forms of energy and energy transformation. Many engines and engine features appear in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series.\nDrivetrains.\nDrivetrains are the system of connecting the transmission to the wheels on a land-vehicle, defined as a group of components that deliver power to the driving wheels. &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; vehicles have a very simplistic drivetrain types, which are Front Wheel Drive, Rear Wheel Drive and All Wheel Drive. For the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; vehicles, however, the concept of the drivetrain has been expanded, especially in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", where said concept is revamped.\nVehicle License Plates.\n are introduced in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" with the player's ability to explore in a three-dimensional environment making plates viewable. In later games, the purpose of license plate becomes more important and necessary to the storyline of the game.\n3D Universe.\nLicense plates in \"GTA III\" and \"\" are static textures, with all plates in \"GTA III\" reading \"LC R29\" (the \"LC\" could stand for &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;). In \"GTA Vice City\", some vehicles retain the LC R29 plates; others have blurred and illegible versions of the 1978-1986/1991-1997 Florida license plate, with pre-release screenshots showing the Florida plate, reading \"VC 685\", used on industrial and low-grade vehicles. It was later reduced in resolution, and in the beta, some vehicles had 1986-2000 New York License plates reading 5SZ 832. For the anniversary edition of \"GTA Vice City\", the plates were changed to be based on 1997-present University of Florida specialty plates reading F66WC.\nFor ' and ', license plates in both games feature an \"LC\" (Liberty City) and \"VC\" (Vice City) prefix, respectively, followed by a four-digit number. While still more varied than in \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Vice City\", the games only offer a limited number of license numbers, with each of them specific to certain vehicles' models.\nLiberty City Stories license plates appear to be based on 1989-1999 New York Motorcycle Plates with a 1999 registration sticker with \"New York\" actually still slightly legible; and in the Shoreside Vale loading screen shows two vehicles with what appears to be 2001-2010 New York Plates which is anachronistic.\nThe Vice City Stories license plate seems to be inspired by the original 1990-2007 Florida Save the Manatees license plate, specifically the grass at the bottom, and the red text based on 1986-1991 Florida license plates; with 1984 registration stickers. With vehicles on the Mainland having a palm tree on the left side of the license plate.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nLicense plates are dynamic in ', generating random 7 character license numbers that consist of both letters and numbers. The pattern is: two letters and two numbers, then a space, then a number and two letters (e.g. AA00 0AA). Each of the three major cities in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; have their own plates and some vehicles have their own custom license numbers. Note, however, that during a session of play, all cars of the same model will have the same number plate (for example, all &lt;a href=\"Landstalker\"&gt;Landstalker&lt;/a&gt;s will have the same plates). These will change if a new session of play is started, even if stored in a garage. Design-wise, the license plates seem to be based on the 1982-1987 and 1987-1994 California plates with October 1991 registration stickers, but the license number pattern seems to take influence from both the Californian plates and the 1984-2000 Nevada plates, and the spacing based on the British format used since September 2001.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", license plates do not have an actual letter-number combination; instead, all license plates simply say \"LIBERTY CITY\" in large blue capital letters. The design of the plates is simply a reproduction of the 2001-2010 license plates (as seen &lt;a href=\"https%3A//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/Liberty_city_license_plate.png\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), with \"New York\" removed and \"The Empire State\" replaced with \"Liberty City State\" at the bottom. Also, despite &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt; being based on New Jersey, a separate state from Liberty City, all license plates in Alderney are Liberty City plates. In the beta license plates were originally intended to have a letter-number combination, much like the vehicles in \"GTA San Andreas\", but this feature was dropped during the game's development, possibly due to complications or difficulties arising from programming this feature, and this is why in trailers and pre-release screen shots the license plates were originally blank. In \"GTA IV\", a license plate from the beta version of the game can be found on the back of fuel trailers (which can be seen in the gallery below), which is seemingly based on on the British format of AA00AAA, with it broken up into AA-00A AA.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", the license plates resemble the current California plates with 2013 registration stickers, down to the abbreviation \"CA\" still being on them yet the year erased, and have \"San Andreas\" written on top instead. There are 8 random characters on each plate; the pattern is two numbers, followed by three letters and three numbers (00AAA000), which is based on the current California pattern simply with a extra number at the front; Furthermore, custom plates with an odd number of characters are offset one space to the right and never centered, which is actual practice in California.\nThere are multiple types of plates, including:\nFor this reason, \"GTA V\" contains the most realistic plate combinations in the series. In the files, each plate receive a specific filename that is applied to a car as part of the possible variations of the same, with a specific probability numbers that determines how frequent a vehicle will spawn with said plate on it.\nVehicles spawned with trainers tend to have registration number 46EEK572, suggesting that this may be a default plate combination.\nThere is a special variation of license plates only seen in &lt;a href=\"North%20Yankton\"&gt;North Yankton&lt;/a&gt;, which features the same elements, except \"Yankton\" in a red stripe, unseen in SA plates, and black numbers. This plate variant only appears on snow vehicles, as North Yankton is a snowy place. These are based on 2001-2006 South Dakota license plates, with black numbers being taken from North Dakota license plates, yet despite being a separate state uses the 00AAA000 format of San Andreas plates, though this could be seen as a hybrid of the AAA 000 format used in North Dakota, and the 00A 000 format used in South Dakota at the time. Unlike in Los Santos, North Yankton Police vehicles share the same plate as their civilian counterparts which is actual practice in in North and South Dakota.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Epsilon%20Program%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Epsilon Program&lt;/a&gt; license plate exists in the game files but is completely unused in-game. It features an \"Epsilon\" text, in a baby blue stripe, its signature color; Oddly enough this license plate features San Andreas registration stickers. The plate is intended to appear on the Tractor, presumably during &lt;a href=\"Unknowing%20the%20Truth\"&gt;Unknowing the Truth&lt;/a&gt;, but due to a hardcoded limitation, the plate texture is ignored; a default plate is applied based on the vehicle's license plate probabilities.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nLicense plates continue to be used in \"GTA Online\". The player was once able to use the &lt;a href=\"iFruit%20App\"&gt;iFruit App&lt;/a&gt; on their smartphone or tablet device to create their own license plates and apply it to their vehicles through &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;. Following the app's shutdown in 2022, this feature was eventually to the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games%20Social%20Club\"&gt;Rockstar Games Social Club&lt;/a&gt; website.\nLicense plates also serve a major importance in the &lt;a href=\"Import/Export\"&gt;Import/Export&lt;/a&gt; update. Customised vehicles that are &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;sourced&lt;/a&gt; around the state of San Andreas appear with custom license plates, some of which are minor references to the car's real life history. Upon exporting, these license plates are replaced with standard code plates to avoid detection.\nThe LSPD \"License Plate Scanner\" appears in a 2-player source mission for &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt;. This device is fitted in the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; and is operated with the on-board camera. The copilot of the helicopter scans plates on vehicles to locate the required vehicle.\nHorns.\nHorns are features present in most \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" games. They are activated by a specific button on the controller or keyboard. Pressing the horn button on a emergency vehicle will activate the lights and sirens. Sirens have an effect: vehicles will weave in and out of traffic to give way to the emergency vehicle. In \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", players can customize the horns their vehicle has. \nHorns do have a effect in the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;: when held, &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt; will run or dive out of the way to avoid being run over. In \"GTA V\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", if the player is using the horn on an NPC, they will react negatively, but if it is used several times, the NPC will accelerate and starts to drive recklessly (not always, but they start to drive faster than normal). \nMusical horns are also added in \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\", as well as in several updates. Most of them has a limited time to play, except one that plays indefinitely. This kind of horn can be found with &lt;a href=\"The%20%22I%27m%20Not%20a%20Hipster%22%20Update\"&gt;The \"I'm Not a Hipster\" Update&lt;/a&gt;.\nLights.\nDaytime Running Lights.\nDaytime Running Lights, also referred to as DRLs, are small light strips or bulbs that cannot be controlled by the player. These lights turn on whenever the car's engine is on, and they remain on until the player turns the car off.\nAuxiliary lamps.\nAuxiliary lamps are lights that differs from the conventional lighting system. These usually provides either more illumination to the front of the car or where the car itself cannot provide from the sides or rear. It can include fog lamps, spotlights, searchlights, etc. However, in \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\", several vehicles can be modified with non-functional fog lights that simply serve as decoration.\nWarning Lights.\nWarning lights are lamps indicating warnings, such as police lights or flashing beacons. They typically flash repetitively.\nTaxi lights.\nTaxi lights are, as the name suggests, lights fitted on taxis indicating their status on call outs.\nLED Displays.\nLED Displays are displays for information, found on buses and service vehicles.\nDoor Ajar Chime.\nDoor Ajar Chimes are chimes that sound in order to alert the vehicle's occupants when a door is open. Only a select few vehicles have it in \"GTA IV\" (and the volume usually needs to be high for it to be heard) but it is more prominent in \"GTA V\", as most vehicles have it.\nVehicles with door-ajar chimes in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\":\nVehicles with door-ajar chimes in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\":\nCar alarms.\nCar alarms first appeared in the first \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" and have appeared in every subsequent game since then. In the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; most parked cars were either locked or with alarms; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;, some cars still feature alarms which will sound if the player breaks the windows of the car or rams them. In all of its appearances, car alarms give the player a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level\"&gt;Wanted Level&lt;/a&gt; if the police spots the player driving it.\nIn some titles, especially in the HD Universe, car alarms can be triggered by tremors as well, such as nearby explosions or crashes, another realistic feature.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", there are five variations, which three of them are different alarm sirens, the fourth one using the car's horn and the fifth one (the rarest of the group) is a silent one (only flashing the car's headlights, red tail lights and indicators).\nBack-up beeper.\nThe , also known as a vehicle motion alarm, is a device intended to warn pedestrians of a moving vehicle, usually as it's backing up. They are mostly found on large trucks and other commercial vehicles.\nA specific sound was used on all vehicles it was applied to throughout the game, which made an appearance throughout the series. In \"GTA V\", a larger variety of reversing sounds were added to make the game more dynamic.\nABS.\nThe (often shortened to ABS) is an automobile safety system that allows the wheels on a motor vehicle to maintain tractive contact with the road surface according to driver inputs while braking, preventing the wheels from locking up (ceasing rotation) and avoiding uncontrolled skidding.\nFactors to determine ABS in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt; games are often limited, but on the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible to determine it via steering while braking and stopping power. Usually, vehicles that have ABS are more responsive in braking and the driver can easily steer the vehicle in order to avoid any obstacle on the path or to take corners safely. Those vehicles that do not have ABS would take long distances to stop and they have little to no steering while braking, making avoiding obstacles difficult. It is also possible by observing the car's wheels while braking. By having ABS, the wheels would be still able to spin, while by having no ABS, the wheels remains locked.\nWhile GTA does not literally implement this feature, ABS would cause tyre skids to be dashed rather than one long mark.\nAn example of how ABS is apparent on two vehicles in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; is the following:\nOther cases are often different in behaviour from the two cases above:\nABS remains to be purely fictional and symptoms of the feature purely coincide with the handling data individual cars sport, as it is \"often\" determined by the handling flags assigned to them (which may or may not be true).\nHydraulics.\nHydraulics are a feature available in some \"GTA\" games, which enable the player to adjust a vehicle's height through electronic manipulation of the suspension with special hydraulic jacks. Hydraulics can be controlled with the right analog stick on console versions, and pressing either the left or right analog stick will make the vehicle's hydraulics either lock in place or hop in the air, respectively. The first car in the series to have hydraulics was a &lt;a href=\"Yardie%20Lobo\"&gt;Yardie Lobo&lt;/a&gt;, in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\". In ', the &lt;a href=\"Voodoo%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Voodoo&lt;/a&gt; was the only vehicle to have hydraulics.Finally in ', the &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; can customize almost any vehicle to feature hydraulics, but storywise, the first vehicle to feature them is the &lt;a href=\"Savanna\"&gt;Savanna&lt;/a&gt;. In San Andreas, many lowriders that are found in the streets are by default equipped with hydraulics. As both hydraulics and the game camera are controlled with the right analog stick (on console versions), vehicles with hydraulics disable the camera control. Almost any car can also be equipped with hydraulics at &lt;a href=\"Wheel%20Arch%20Angels\"&gt;Wheel Arch Angels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trans%20Fender\"&gt;TransFender&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Low%20Co.\"&gt;Loco Low Co.&lt;/a&gt;. In \"GTA V\", the player is able to modify 11 vehicles from &lt;a href=\"Benny%27s%20Original%20Motor%20Works\"&gt;Benny's Original Motor Works&lt;/a&gt; website and app on their cell &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;phone&lt;/a&gt;. This feature is on the enhanced version and Online only.\nCars with hydraulics throughout the series include:\nHidden headlamps.\nHidden headlamps (also known as pop-up headlights) are headlights that are designed to pop open when the driver turns the lights on. When not in use, the headlamps rotate downwards and sit flush with the hood of the car. They are designed to make the car's front end slightly more aerodynamic, by reducing the space needed for headlamps on the front of the car. Only a few vehicles in the entire \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series feature pop-up headlights.\nVehicles with hidden headlamps include:\nDestination Display.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", it is possible to find a unique \"Destination Display\" screen inside a vehicle. They appear on the middle of the vehicle's interior console and disappears when the player leaves the vehicle. There are two variations:\nVehicles with a Destination Display screen:\nUnderglow.\nUnderglow or neon lights are a vehicle modification available in \"\" and the enhanced version of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\". Neon underglow was only available on the &lt;a href=\"Space%20Docker\"&gt;Space Docker&lt;/a&gt; in the former version of GTA V, albeit to the sides of the vehicle rather than the underside.\nVehicles with underglow:\nThe enhanced version of \"GTA V\" for &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PS4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; adds neon underglow as a modification option in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; shops in GTA V Story Mode and Online. Neon Kits are found under the lights section. Once fitted, underglow is always on when the vehicle is running. \nThe player can add different layouts and colors to the vehicle, including:\nInterior Dashboards.\nThe enhanced version of \"GTA V\" for &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PS4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; adds functional interior dashboards to all controllable vehicles along with the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Roadcruiser\"&gt;Police Roadcruiser&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Rancher\"&gt;Police Rancher&lt;/a&gt; seen only in the &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;Prologue&lt;/a&gt;. They are most noticeable when using &lt;a href=\"First-Person%20View\"&gt;First-Person View&lt;/a&gt; while driving.\nMany of the interiors are based on \"GTA IV\"'s exposed interiors and given additional depth and functionality. For example, the &lt;a href=\"Tropic\"&gt;Tropic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stallion\"&gt;Stallion&lt;/a&gt; are the same in both renditions, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Yankee\"&gt;Yankee&lt;/a&gt;, which is used in most trucks in \"GTA V\".\nThe PC version of \"GTA V\" also included the hood-cam view from Xbox 360 and PS3. This was later introduced into the Xbox One and PS4 versions of the game, after the &lt;a href=\"Ill-Gotten%20Gains%20Part%201\"&gt;Ill-Gotten Gains Part 1&lt;/a&gt; Update.\nDashboard Components.\nThe dashboards feature some working gauges and functional indicator lights, including:\nLand vehicles.\nUpon start up, most (if not all) components will light up, due to the engine ECU \"checking\" everything is working. \nNaval Vehicles.\nRear view mirrors are present on most land and some sea vehicles, and are semi-functional - the reflections are not clear and may not reflect dynamic objects, only terrain.\nTo simplify gameplay, vehicle functions such as changing gears or operating the radio are not depicted, and the player's hands never leave the steering wheel except to operate the cell phone in Story Mode.\nSteering wheels are functional in all land vehicles. However, very few vehicles have visible steering wheel mounted controls, such as for controlling radio volume and engaging cruise control. Some vehicles have the manufacturer logo on the steering wheel, while others do not. Motorcycles have functional steering handlebars and aircraft have functional control sticks and yokes, which moves in direction with the console's controls.\nRadio displays are present on some dashboards which will display the current station, song and artist, while others have a static radio. Radios can be generic (factory) models or made by either &lt;a href=\"Wiwang\"&gt;Wiwang&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Meinmacht\"&gt;Meinmacht&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere can be other accessories present in some vehicles, such as coffee or soda cups in the cup holders, air fresheners clipped to the air vents, phone holders, and full ashtrays.\nRemote Camera.\nRemote cameras are devices installed on a few specialized and armed vehicles, which serves as an alternative view for the occupant.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; features a fully-functional camera in the mission &lt;a href=\"Eye%20in%20the%20Sky\"&gt;Eye in the Sky&lt;/a&gt;, where it is used to identify individuals by reading transmitters placed in &lt;a href=\"2012\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; driver licenses. The display for the camera are the altimeter, compass, horizontal angle indicator, microphone (represented as a white line that creates frequency waves when voices are heard) and, unique to this vehicle, the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; writting on the top right corner, above the horizontal angle indicator.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the camera is available for either the copilot or passenger of a specialized vehicle (which they may have different purposes), or an armed vehicle. A variation of it, seen in the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt;, uses a unique aiming reticle, compass and horizontal angle indicator.\nVehicles with remote cameras:\nWinch.\nA is a mechanical device that is used to pull in (wind up) or let out (wind out) or otherwise adjust the \"tension\" of a rope or wire rope (also called \"cable\" or \"wire cable\"). They will have different applications\nAlthough the winch is prominently featured in several off-road oriented vehicles, they are non-functional and serves as descorations for the vehicle in question.\nFuntional winches are prominently featured in helicopters, where in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" can be used to rappel down in certain locations .\nSimilarly, towtrucks use winches to move the tow hook in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBulletproof Windows.\nVarious vehicles in the HD Universe have bulletproof windows, usually complementing a heavily armoured vehicle body. In \"GTA IV\" and its episodes, bulletproof windows are totally immune to gunfire, able to take thousands of rounds with zero consequence. However, in \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\", bulletproof windows are more realistic. They can only take a small amount of gunfire before shattering, and Full Metal Jacket ammo (only usable with a select few guns) can pierce right through them with only a few shots. Despite this, a select few vehicles retain \"GTA IV\"-style bulletproof windows that are completely immune to gunfire, but the aforementioned FMJ ammo can still destroy the windows quite easily. Explosions and being ejected through windshields will also instantly destroy bulletproof windows, along with vehicle occupants smashing out the windows to shoot from within the cabin."}

{"id": "170399", "revid": "38527717", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=170399", "title": "Vehicle Features/Drivetrains", "text": " are the system of connecting the transmission to the wheels on a land-vehicle.\nDescription.\nThe drivetrain is defined as \"the group of components that deliver power to the driving wheels\", where its function is to couple the engine that produces the power to the driving wheels that consume this mechanical power. This connection involves physically linking the two components, which may be at opposite ends of the vehicle and so requiring a long propeller shaft or drive shaft.\nThe way a car's drivetrain and engine are set up can have a drastic effect on occasions such as police chases and enemy gang wars (escaping, for example).\nDrivetrains and Descriptions.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nFront Wheel Drive=\nFront wheel drive (FWD) is when a car's engine power is channeled to the front wheels. FWD cars cost a lot less than other drivetrain types because of less moving parts. In addition, front engine, front wheel drive (FF) cars tend to have understeer when accelerating mid-turn, because accelerating causes the weight of the vehicle to shift onto the rear axle, resulting in decreased acceleration and decreased steering ability.\nRear Wheel Drive=\nRear wheel drive (RWD) is when a car's engine power is sent to the rear wheels. RWD cars tend to be more expensive because they tend to have higher horsepower and more moving parts. Front-engine, rear wheel drive (FR) drivetrain layouts are commonly used in drifting, other rear wheel drive configurations are used in oval racing, circuit racing and drag racing. There are a lot of RWD cars in GTA IV.\nFour Wheel Drive/ All Wheel Drive=\nFour wheel drive/ All wheel drive (4WD/AWD, respectively) is when the engine power is transferred to all four wheels of a car. Acceleration is usually great but sometimes less than FWD cars because the model may have a lower power-to-mass ratio. Still, it provides great acceleration, great offroad capabilities, and the ability to climb rocks, walls, etc without being stuck on them, mostly because the wheels that are in the ground can push the car off the obstacle.\u00a0In theory, it is the best drivetrain layout because the effects of understeer and oversteer counterbalance each other. In practise, 4WD/AWD vehicles tend to suffer greater drivetrain power losses due to the increased weight and parts, sometimes resulting in an overall decrease in performance.\nNote that a few AWD\u00a0cars may have uneven torque distribution (e.g. 30% front, 70% rear). This will affect acceleration, handling and drifting capabilities. Greater front torque distribution causes characteristics of FWD vehicles to show through, while greater rear torque distribution causes characteristics of RWD vehicles.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\n3D Universe.\nContents.\nTable.\nThe layouts featured are as follows (Combining physical appearance of the engine's location and the Handling data). Because of the multiple drivetrain and design changes through the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, some cars will be listed more than once.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\" &amp; \"Episodes From Liberty City\".\nContents.\nTable.\nThe layouts featured are as follows (Combining physical appearance of the engine's location and the &lt;a href=\"Handling.dat/GTAIV\"&gt;Handling data&lt;/a&gt;);\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" &amp; \"Online\".\nContents.\nTable.\nThe layouts featured are as follows (Combining physical appearance of the engine's location and the &lt;a href=\"Handling.meta/GTAV\"&gt;Handling data&lt;/a&gt;);\nTransmission ratios\nAs the transmission is also part of the drivetrain, the ratios are as well. Note that every car with the same amount of gears of another one (&lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt;, both 5 speed) will share the exact same ratios, and if a car had a transmission upgrade, thus adding another gear, such as an upgraded Tailgater (6 speed), it will have the same ratios as one that natively came with that amount of gear, such as the &lt;a href=\"811\"&gt;811&lt;/a&gt; (6 speed). The game does not generate gear ratios that make actual sense below 3 speeds and above 5 speeds, and it only gets worse after a 6 speed, therefore a 6 speed is the most desirable transmission as it has the closest spacing. All gearboxes except the single speed have a ratio span of 3.7:1 ( quotient of 3.33/0.90).\nSingle speed\n2 speed\n3 speed\n4 speed\n5 speed\n6 speed\n7 speed\n8 speed\n9 speed\n10 speed \nHandling Data.\n3D Universe.\nAssuming there is no extra conditions for AWD vehicles, it is presumed that by being AWD will have equal torque distribution for all wheels."}

They are prominent in all \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" games, to an extent.\nDescription.\nAppearing in all \"Grand Theft Auto\" games, engines can be found under the bonnet/hood of almost every vehicle in the games.\n3D Universe.\nUsed as a smaller, realistic element, engines appear as minor textures. Because of their low quality, engine identification is minimal, however, prominent features of the engine, such as camshaft covers, the main engine block, and smaller details of manifolds can be seen. The engines are slightly more detailed in \"GTA San Andreas\", appearing as partially-3D models instead of flat textures.\nHD Universe.\nAppearing in the HD Universe, engines return as a much more focused element. They can now be found as 3D Models, as well as textures. Engine identification can still be problematic, but with the support of 3D models, which can be seen even better with the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Editor\"&gt;Rockstar Editor&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", engines can be identified much easier. Note that, especially in \"GTA V\", the engine \"cover\" (which is the texture seen from looking under the bonnet/hood) can contradict the engine 3D Model, for example, the engine \"cover\" may be identified as a V8, however, the engine model may appear to be an Inline-4.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", engine models are often depicted with basic layouts such as Twin-cylinder, Inline-4 and V8 engines, with a few of them having their own layout (&lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; with a single-cylinder engine). For \"Grand Theft Auto V\", however, newer engine layouts and types were introduced, especially from DLC vehicles (Flat-4 engines like the &lt;a href=\"BF%20Injection\"&gt;Injection&lt;/a&gt; and V6 engines like the &lt;a href=\"Tropos%20Rallye\"&gt;Tropos Rallye&lt;/a&gt;).\nTypes of Engines.\nDifferent engines appear in the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series, where some may seem a sensible choice for the vehicle's style, purpose and appearance.\nEngine Layouts.\nTransversely laid engines - Engine is laid across the car; sideways (aka East-West). Examples include:\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nLongitudinally laid engines - Engine is laid down the car length-ways (aka North-South). Examples include:\nEngine Features.\nAir Filters.\nAir Filters are devices used to filter air before it is drawn into the engine. Although all cars feature air filters, only some vehicles feature external, distinctively large air filters.\nAppearing in the HD Universe the most, they are detailed models with typically red filter paper in a usually cylindrical block placed on the top of the engine cover, or, for basic cars, laid aside the engine, in which an air filter pipe will be used for connection. Depending of the vehicle, air filters can be seen either alone or in conjunction with superchargers and turbochargers. They are also seen as single units, but some models can include two or even three filter units.\nExamples of cars with air filters are:\nTurbochargers.\nTurbochargers are turbine-driven devices used to gain the highest-potential energy from exhaust air. They appear in the HD Universe the most, as a spiral/helical aluminium model, located beside the engine. The only modeled part of a turbocharger seen in-game is the turbine side housing, appearing as the aforementioned description.\nCars in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" can be seen with Turbocharger models by default, however, cars with them will not have any effect on the car's performance unless they purchase a Turbo modification at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; or other mod-shops. Note that cars without turbocharger models by default will not necessarily be fitted with a model even if the turbo modification is purchased. Fewer vehicles may have a turbocharged engine sound heard when shifting gears, even if there is no in-game model or any \"Turbo\" modification installed.\nAs newer vehicles were introduced in the enhanced version of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", turbochargers are more detailed and fully functional, where the turbine moves when idle and revvs up with the engine revolutions.\nExamples of cars with turbochargers are:\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nNote that several super cars in \"GTA V\", particularly examples such as the &lt;a href=\"Osiris\"&gt;Osiris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20R\"&gt;Turismo R&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; appear with side-placed Intercoolers, which are devices used commonly on turbocharged vehicles (especially when located behind intakes on the sides of cars), which cool down intake air for the best possible efficiency and performance. This could suggest that the aforementioned super cars are turbocharged, however, no in-game models of turbochargers appear in these vehicles.\nSuperchargers.\nSuperchargers are air compressor devices used to gain larger amounts of torque and energy, thus gaining an extra \"boost\". It increases the amount of air drawn into the engine by sucking air through a fan in an intake device.\nSuperchargers are claimed to be on several vehicles in game, evidently from in-game badges and website descriptions, however, the supercharger itself cannot be seen in-game. Despite this, supercharger intakes can be seen on cars, particularly muscle cars, whether using in-game modifications (in \"GTA V\"), or as an extra accessory added by default, such as the &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA IV\". Supercharger intakes can be added to certain cars in \"GTA V\", where they are known as bug-catchers. Supercharger Pulleys can be seen on some cars, such as the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20%28car%29\"&gt;Blade&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA V\". Furthermore, badges can be seen on certain cars, defining them as \"supercharged\".\nAs newer vehicles were introduced in the enhanced version of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", superchargers are more detailed and fully functional, where the \"butterflies\" (red valve bug catchers) open with the throttle input and closes again.\nHere lists any in-game evidence suggesting there are Superchargers fitted on cars;\nEngine Parts.\nManifolds.\nAppearing only the HD Universe, manifolds are a set of pipes which allow mixtures of air and fuel to enter and exit the engine. Because of the game limitations/reductions in the past, the manifolds are only present in the HD Universe, and appear as partially-3D Models. In \"GTA V\", manifolds appear in most vehicles, but only a selective few can be seen from the exterior. Those which are not visible can be seen using the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Editor\"&gt;Rockstar Editor&lt;/a&gt;, supposing the engine actually has the model. For \"GTA IV\" and \"GTA V\", manifolds are currently the best way to identify the type of engine, as the engine textures in the HD Universe are still contradictory and not detailed enough to fully identify an engine, leaving the amount/positioning of manifolds as a good technique for identifying the engine.\nCamshafts/Cam Covers.\nCamshafts are a main feature of an engine which are designed to let in a correctly timed release of air and fuel into the cylinders. While the camshaft itself is not visible, the \"cam/camshaft covers\", rocker covers and valve covers are. They are prominently featured in all the games, but detail is limited in the 3D Universe. Timing Belts (or timing chain) are seen on some models of V8 and Inline 4 engines, such as in the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20%28car%29\"&gt;Blade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Youga\"&gt;Youga&lt;/a&gt;. When a piston moves, it rotates the crankshaft which then rotates the camshaft. The Timing belt is the chain or rubber belt that connects the crankshaft to the camshaft. In other words, the movement of timing belt is effectively responsible for the movement of camshaft.\nCurrently, camshaft appears as in-game detail, as Single Overhead Camshaft (SOHC) (on both Inline engines and V engines), and Double Overehad Camshaft (DOHC) (on Inline engines only).\nFuel Intake/Injection.\nCarburetors (or Carburettors) are devices used to blend a mixture of fuel and air before its input into the engine.\nTypically, carbs appear on older style engines, in a down-draft style, which can be seen on the &lt;a href=\"Stinger%20GT\"&gt;Stinger GT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stirling%20GT\"&gt;Stirling GT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"JB%20700\"&gt;JB 700&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Z-Type\"&gt;Z-Type&lt;/a&gt;. Note that these do, however, share the same model as what would be throttle bodies, such as those found on the &lt;a href=\"Futo\"&gt;Futo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brioso%20R/A\"&gt;Brioso R/A&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn reality, carbs, particularly downdraft carbs, are dangerous for intake of foliage and debris, however, in-game, carburetors pose no threat nor affect performance.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Fr%C3%A4nken%20Stange\"&gt;Fr\u00e4nken Stange&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tornado%20Rat%20Rod\"&gt;Tornado Rat Rod&lt;/a&gt; features unique velocity stack carburetors; where the Carburetors are significantly taller and feature large curved cylindrical intakes. The exact same velocity stacks can be applied to the &lt;a href=\"Roosevelt%20Valor\"&gt;Roosevelt Valor&lt;/a&gt;, which is technically incorrect, as the number of stacks (8) does not correspond to the number of cylinders (12).\nSimilarly-looking, Throttle Bodies are another device fitted on cars which regulate the amount of air flowing into the engine, in response the engine control unit then injects more or less fuel. Unlike carbs, throttle bodies do not feature the fuel bowl, as they do not control fuel ratios. In-game, they use the same model as the down-draft carburetors, as well as a small cuboid model used from the main engine block, finally followed by the original 4 inlets on the inlet manifold. \nDue to the nature of the texture, it is almost impossible to differentiate between what are carburettors and what are throttle bodies in-game (with the exception of real-life instinct that throttle bodies are typically modern-used unlike carbs), thus it can be said engines with said parts are either/or, rather than just one.\nEngine Oil.\nOil can be seen present in \"GTA V\". When the engine is heavily damaged, oil can be seen dropping from the engine bay. Heavily damaging the engine bay will eventually cause a large amount of oil leaking expeditiously. The oil gauge can also be seen functional inside some cars (enhanced version only). It measures oil temperature rather than pressure. When stationary, the gauge will increase, and when moving, the gauge will decrease. When the engine bay is heavily damaged, a \"Low Oil\" warning light will appear, shortly before the engine cuts off. \nEngine Modifications.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", various engine modifications are obtainable. They can be unlocked and fitted at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beeker%27s%20Garage\"&gt;Beeker's Garage&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=\"Benny%27s%20Original%20Motor%20Works\"&gt;Benny's Original Motor Works&lt;/a&gt; in the enhanced version of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\").\nThe engine modifications are listed in Engine Management Systems (EMS) upgrade levels, from Level 1 to Level 4. EMS modifications in \"GTA V\" increase acceleration, and cost amounts from $9,000 to around $40,000.\nTurbo tuning is also available, which presumably adds a turbocharger and/or improves upon its intake rate, albeit with high prices ranging from &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;25,000 to $50,000. Similar to EMS upgrades, Turbo tuning increases acceleration, however, at a much higher rate, balanced with its higher cost. Turbo modifications also add the sound of a dump valve (blow-off valve) when gear shifting, most commonly up, or when letting off the throttle at high speeds.\u00a0\nIn the enhanced version of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", exclusively at &lt;a href=\"Benny%27s%20Original%20Motor%20Works\"&gt;Benny's Original Motor Works&lt;/a&gt;, engine block modifications can be added, such as adding custom air filters, intakes, carburetors/throttle bodies and covers.\nEngine Displacement.\nDisplacement is the volume inside a cylinder which the piston revolves within. It is commonly measured in either \"cc\" (Cubic Centimeters), or Liters, where 3000cc would equal 3 Liters. Note that displacement must not be confused with the fuel tank volume.\nSome cars, especially in \"GTA V\", have displacements mentioned on either their in-game website appearance, or on the vehicle itself (for example, badges on the &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Compact\"&gt;Blista Compact&lt;/a&gt;)."}

Police cars have sirens instead of a horn. The &lt;a href=\"Ice-Cream%20Van\"&gt;Ice-Cream Van&lt;/a&gt; has a musical jingle instead of a horn, but it serves no practical purpose.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; Games.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", ', ' and ', the player can honk the horn by pressing H (LSHIFT or RSHIFT in &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;III&lt;/a&gt; and )on the PC and the Left Analog Stick on the PS2. A feature, unique to large trucks, is the reverse beep. This adds some realism, as large trucks in real life normally have those beeps. In ' however, this feature is missing, but horns are used the same way as the other games.\nFrom the 3D Universe games onwards, emergency vehicles may use the siren to move other vehicles out of the road, which makes it easier when doing the &lt;a href=\"Vigilante\"&gt;Vigilante&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paramedic\"&gt;Paramedic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Firefighter\"&gt;Firefighter&lt;/a&gt; side missions. Again, the &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Whoopee\"&gt;ice cream van&lt;/a&gt; has a unique musical jingle instead of a horn, except for \"GTA San Andreas\", where the player could honk normally if the horn button is held down. The jingle of the Mr. Whoopee is used for the purpose of &lt;a href=\"Distribution\"&gt;selling \"ice cream\"&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Cherry%20Popper%20Ice%20Cream%20Factory\"&gt;Cherry Popper Ice Cream Factory&lt;/a&gt;. Uniquely to \"GTA San Andreas\", &lt;a href=\"bicycles\"&gt;bicycles&lt;/a&gt; have a bell instead of horns.\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", sometimes &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt; will not get out of the way if the player honks at them; instead, they will show disdain.\nIn &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; Games.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the horn functions remain unchanged from the 3D Universe games. Emergency vehicles' sirens still move vehicles out of the way. There is still an &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Tasty\"&gt;ice cream van&lt;/a&gt; with a musical jingle in the game; it has 6 different jingles which speed up and slow down depending on the speed of the van. Reverse beeps return to the HD Universe games; most industrial trucks have them. Uniquely to the &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Tasty\"&gt;Mr. Tasty&lt;/a&gt;, it sounds like a \"ding-a-ling\" instead of \"beep\". In \"GTA IV\", some cars have unique horns, not found in any other vehicle in game. Differently from the 3D Universe, boats now have horns, louder than any car horn. Railway vehicles also have horns. They can be heard randomly, or in \"GTA IV\"'s case, only during certain missions.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" the horns have been expanded. Car horns are more random and can be different even if the car is the same. Additionally, the player now can modify his car's horn at the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Tow%20Truck\"&gt;Tow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tow%20Truck%20%28Yankee-based%29\"&gt;Trucks&lt;/a&gt; have rotating lights on the top, but it makes no sound at all and serves only for realism. The &lt;a href=\"Airtug\"&gt;Airtug&lt;/a&gt; has a unique siren that makes a sound of a reverse beep; oddly, it can move vehicles out of the way. There are three different reverse beeps on the trucks. Bicycles, again, have bells instead of horns. In the enhanced version of \"GTA V\", some emergency vehicles have a unique siren. For example, the &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ambulance&lt;/a&gt; siren sounds like a lower version of the ', ' &amp; \"\" police siren.\n&lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;Pedestrians&lt;/a&gt; in HD Universe games now run away from the player's vehicle if they honk at them. In \"GTA V\", car drivers will react when someone honks at them several times, sometimes driving recklessly in the same manner as when they spot a crime. Additionally, they may stop and exit their vehicle and pursue the player in a hostile manner - or even open fire at them (if they are carrying a gun) - if provoked repeatedly.\nVehicles with Unique Horns.\nGTA San Andreas:\n\"GTA IV\" and Episodes:\nGTA V\" and \"GTA Online:"}

Hydraulics are controlled with the movement/camera controls (analog sticks in consoles), where the right one will make the car bounce around in the direction the player wants, while the left one will cause the hydraulics to lock in place.\n&lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nHydraulics were first featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" with the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"Yardie%20Lobo\"&gt;Yardie Lobo&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with permanent hydraulics in replacement of the horn function. It was retained in \"\" with the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"Voodoo%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Voodoo&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"\", hydraulics became an optional modification for almost any car with the addition of mod shops, where the player can install hydraulics at &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Low%20Co.\"&gt;Loco Low Co.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wheel%20Arch%20Angels\"&gt;Wheel Arch Angels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trans%20Fender\"&gt;Trans Fender&lt;/a&gt;.

Some files reveal (along with the &lt;a href=\"Nitro\"&gt;Nitro&lt;/a&gt;) that they are able to be placed on vehicles, but there is no command to use them, leaving it as an unfinished feature. \n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nHydraulics return to the enhanced version of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", in the Update. Players are able to fit them onto lowrider-style \"Custom\" conversions of pre-existing cars, as well as new ones featured in the same update. Hydraulics are exclusively available at &lt;a href=\"Benny%27s%20Original%20Motor%20Works\"&gt;Benny's Original Motor Works&lt;/a&gt;.\nDepending of the vehicle, once they are converted into a Custom version, they are automatically fitted with low-power hydraulics. However, they can be modified with an array of powerful hydraulics that range between &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;125,000 and $250,000, with some of the vehicles reaching up to $275,000 and only one reaching up to $290,000. These modifications control the height jumped and the rate at which it does so.\nVehicles with hydraulics are depicted with several details in the trunk, being several hydraulic pumps finished in chrome and electrically powered by several car batteries, as well as gauges and rods within the system. The various hydraulic modifications will change the look of the hydraulic models in the trunk, adding more pumps and gauges.\nHydraulics work similarly to the ones in the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, which are the following:\nCars with Hydraulics.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe following cars have a chance of having hydraulics when spawned on the street during normal gameplay.

As a form to enhance the realism of the games, small details are added on various cars and improves the overall appearance of the vehicle that accompanies the main lights.\nTurn Signals.\n are blinking lamps mounted near the left and right front and rear corners of a vehicle, and sometimes on the sides or on the side mirrors of a vehicle, activated by the driver on one side of the vehicle at a time to advertise intent to turn or change lanes towards that side.\nThis is a very common feature on many civilian cars or a rare sight on other types of vehicles not intended for public use. Although they have appeared in most of the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series and have been rendered in multiple vehicles, they were not functional in the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; due to limited mechanics in rendering functional lights. However, they become a typical feature from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and onwards, where they are often used by NPCs in the environment to give realism and to tell where the car is going when in an intersection. True to in real-life, rear turn signals can be either of an amber color separated with its own light cast (&lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt;) or a red color and together with the main lighting unit (&lt;a href=\"Stanier\"&gt;Stanier&lt;/a&gt;).\nDespite the apparent changes, the player is unable to make use of turn signal in normal gameplay, although they can be activated via a trainer. In \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", there are rare instances where a parked car may have the turn signals on, being an example the parking lot in &lt;a href=\"Big%20Horn%20Drive\"&gt;Big Horn Drive&lt;/a&gt;, where a &lt;a href=\"Car%20Wash\"&gt;Car Wash&lt;/a&gt; is available.\nDaytime Running Lights.\nDaytime Running Lights, also referred to as DRLs, are small light strips or bulbs that cannot be controlled by the player found exclusively in the HD Universe. These lights turn on whenever the car's engine is on, and they remain on until the player turns the car off. Like normal headlights, these ones can get damaged and turn off during collisions. Much like in real life, DRLs seem to be a relatively new feature in the US only found on late-model cars. Not all vehicles have DRLs, just a select few;\nAuxiliary Lamps.\nAuxiliary lamps are lights that differs from the conventional lighting system. These usually provides either more illumination to the front of the car or where the car itself cannot provide from the sides or rear. It can include fog lamps, spotlights, searchlights, etc.\nAlthough those appeared since the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, most of them are just basic parts and were not coded to provide any source of light, although in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;, some lamps are used in conjuction with the lighting feature or with the car's engine on. Fake lamps do not work, but cannot be destroyed and only deforms like the car itself when crashes over an obstacle.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", some cars allows for modifications that will include non-functional lamps at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarning lights.\nWarning lights are a type of device intended to warn passers-by about a certain type of vehicle operating within an area.

In \"\", the aiming mechanic is simplified with the use of the camera control, making it a bit easier to adjust the angle of attack, though it still required some aiming skill due to the lack of a targeting reticle, especially on vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;.\nHD Universe.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\", the aiming mechanic is the same as in \"GTA San Andreas\", being used on the Fire Truck and the &lt;a href=\"APC\"&gt;APC&lt;/a&gt;. However, the lack of a targeting reticle difficult the aiming on vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"\", aiming difficulty differs depending on the console; on the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20DS\"&gt;Nintendo DS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Apple%20iOS\"&gt;Apple iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Android%20OS\"&gt;Android OS&lt;/a&gt;, this is performed with the touchpad functionality, while on the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%20Portable\"&gt;PlayStation Portable&lt;/a&gt;, this is done with the L1/R1 shoulder buttons.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" retains the advanced aiming mechanic from previous games, but the addition of targeting reticles make armed vehicles easier to operate against a target. In addition, targeting reticles are adjusted with the same settings as for hand-held weapons, using either the regular dot reticle or the advanced one available for each class of hand-held weapons (using a rangefinding-like reticle for tank cannons).\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" saw the introduction of mounted turrets in the update, available for the &lt;a href=\"Technical\"&gt;Technical&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt;. Turrets operate the same way as any mounted weapon, but requires at least another player to use them, while leaving the driver/pilot at full control of the main vehicle. These vehicles are generally a great choice for situations where teamwork is a key element, requiring the driver/pilot to coordinate with their teammates and provide angle of attack if necessary.\nList of Mounted Weapons.\nAdd-ons (Online).\nHUD Icons.\nOriginal version\nEnhanced version"}
{"id": "36578", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=36578", "title": "Vehicle Formats", "text": "This page gives a complete list of all files for used by the PC editions of GTA games to configure vehicles.\nGTA 1.\nVehicles are simple, 2D images (called \"sprites\") which are stored in the .gry and .g24 file archives for each level. Most vehicles use small graphical overlays (called \"deltas\") to apply damage to vehicles, as well as represent door animations. All their performance settings are also contained in these files, as well as the index for which engine sound they will use.\nEngine sounds are stored in the .raw files, which are indexed via the .sdt files.\nGTA2.\nUses similar technology to GTA1. Vehicles are still sprites with deltas but their performance is stored in the \"nyc.gci\" text data file which is used by all levels.\nVehicle File List.\n\"This section is incomplete.\"\nGTA 3.\nVehicles are 3D models with thousands of polygons (&lt;a href=\"DFF\"&gt;*.dff&lt;/a&gt;) and using textures approaching one megapixel in size (&lt;a href=\"TXD\"&gt;*.txd&lt;/a&gt;), both of which are stored in the \"gta3.img\" file archive. In addition to these visual formats, vehicles use an additional collision model which is stored in the \"vehicles.col\" collision dictionary.\nMany aspects of vehicle performance and behaviour are stored in text data files, such as the \"handling.cfg\" file, as well as various files which set the type of pedestrians which will use each vehicle.\nGTA VC.\nUses very similar technology and formats to GTA3. Vehicle visual models, &lt;a href=\"TXD\"&gt;textures&lt;/a&gt;, collision models and behaviour use almost identical formats and filenames to GTA3. There are some significant changes to vehicle performance (handling.cfg) with a new \"SuspensionAntiDive\" parameter and whole new sections for Boat data, Bike data and Flying data.\nGTA SA.\nIs based on GTAVC technology but makes a lot of significant changes. Visual models are now combined with collision models and the capabilities of collision models are extended to include \"shadow meshes\". Vehicle perfomance sees a major overhaul with a heavily revised physics and animation engine, as well as some major changes to relevant file formats (such as handling.cfg)."}

{"id": "34111", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=34111", "title": "Vehicle Mines", "text": "Proximity Mines (formerly known as Vehicle Mines) are &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;explosive vehicle weapons&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\" and in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the update, with five additional variations added in the update.\nDescription.\n\"Grand Theft Auto 2\".\nVehicle Mines are small explosive devices than can be placed on the ground. Based on the &lt;a href=\"Heads-Up%20Display\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; icon, they are depicted as generic land mines with a red light on the middle.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle Mines return in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" with a similar function as its previous iteration, as well as the regular &lt;a href=\"Proximity%20Mines\"&gt;Proximity Mines&lt;/a&gt;. While similar to its hand-held counterparts in terms of features, they assume a disk shape rather than the former's brick shape, and emit a much brighter light.\nThe variations from the update are identical in design, but they have different functionality and light colors, which are: Kinetic (orange light), Spike (dark blue light), EMP (light blue light), Slick (green light) and Sticky (purple light).\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto 2\".\nIf a &lt;a href=\"Vehicles%20in%20GTA%202\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"pedestrian\"&gt;pedestrian&lt;/a&gt; comes into contact with the mine, it will blow them up. Mines can be used to explode pursuers or to block an entrance to a weapon in a multiplayer game for example. When a mine is placed under a stationary car without a driver, the mine will only explode when someone enters the car. This is a neat trap to be used in multiplayer. Its damage per \"round\" is 10+.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nProximity Mines act similarly to the \"GTA 2\" iteration, where they can be deployed from a selected range of weaponized vehicles and explode upon proximity of pedestrians and vehicles. Like most explosives, there can be only five active mines, and placing an additional one will cause the first one to disappear. Proximity mines replace the horn functionality when on a flat surface, while for the Arena Contender vehicles, the mines are assigned with the same button to toggle the lights.\nInitially, the mines are immediately armed upon being placed on the ground, which posed a danger to the user in damaging or destroying the vehicle (in the case of the &lt;a href=\"Dune%20FAV\"&gt;Dune FAV&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Tampa\"&gt;Weaponized Tampa&lt;/a&gt;). This was later changed, as the mine is armed when the vehicle moves away.\nVariants from the &lt;a href=\"Brickade%206x6\"&gt;Brickade 6x6&lt;/a&gt; and Arena War vehicles have special characteristics, which differ from the regular explosive variation:\nNote these mines are only functional in free-roam; during contact missions, heists and races, the mines are disabled and, for most vehicles, the horn is reactivated."}
