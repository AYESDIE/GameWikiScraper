The design is purely custom and does not reflect any real-life manufactured tricycle; however, it has similarities to real-world custom tricycles.\nThe Chimera bears a rather unique design with a three-wheeled layout, where it has a front girder design and springer front end, as well as a small front fender and a single circular headlight attached to the clamp. The upper area mounts long handlebars, while sharp details can be seen on the upper caps of the forks and the ends of the handlebars.\nOn the main body, the fuel tank is seemingly rounded and has a gray strip with a cap in the center, while the cylindrical oil tank is mounted at the front of the main chassis, between the foot pads. The engine has two exhaust pipes on each cylinder block which merge into a single pipe on the right side, bearing a wrapped detail. Like other motorcycles featured in the same update, the Chimera features a protruding primary drive with an &lt;a href=\"Atomic\"&gt;Atomic&lt;/a&gt;-branded belt, which is fully animated. Unlike most motorcycles, however, the trike has no dials.\nThe rear portion of the chassis mounts a small seat above and houses the driveshaft and axle, while both sides mount the articulated arms, suspension shocks/springs and large fenders with circular tail lights. Like the &lt;a href=\"Avarus\"&gt;Avarus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sanctus\"&gt;Sanctus&lt;/a&gt;, the Chimera has a vertically-mounted license plate on the rear left fender.\nThe primary color of the trike is applied on the front fender, headlight housing, fuel tank, oil tank and rear fenders, while the secondary one is applied on the the bodywork frames, the front forks, the details of the headlight housing, the sharp details and the innermost sides of the rear fenders. It uses large wire rims with a permanent light gray/silver finish and high-profile tires with whitewall detail, with the rear ones being wider.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Chimera performs very well in terms of speed and cornering. It also performs wheelies extremely well, even pulling back completely will not result the player of falling off of the Chimera. Because of the three-wheeled design, the Chimera has the disadvantage of being wider and heavier than most motorcycles, but makes up for its stability and control over curbs, bumpy roads and uneven terrain.\nMechanically, the Chimera uses a mix of the physics used by motorcycles and ATVs. While this normally is not a problem, this means going off jumps using the Chimera is all but suicidal; due to the odd physics handling, the vehicle is almost completely unable to pitch and roll while in midair. Instead, it will either heavily nosedive after going off a jump or simply remain at the same angle it was at when it lifted off the ground. Thus, taking it to a stunt race or into a mountainous area is ill-advised, lest the player be unable to land properly after going off a jump and getting &lt;a href=\"wasted\"&gt;wasted&lt;/a&gt; due to landing wrong.\nThe Chimera uses a chain-driven, V-twin internal combustion engine with a 4-speed manual transmission, as evidenced by the foot-actuated gear shifter. It has a mid-revving and odd-firing engine sound, which is also shared with the second variant of the &lt;a href=\"Daemon\"&gt;Daemon&lt;/a&gt; added in the same update.\nInstalling any \"Belt Drive Cover\" modification will increase its traction slightly, in the same way as a spoiler."}

The car's grille consists of only a few horizontal bars compared its previous, much denser design. Later shots reveal the interior has also received a substantial upgrade in quality, particularly in the door cards, as well as changes made to the B pillar.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Chino is a large 2-door coup\u00e9 of late 1960s design. Its overall design, especially in the side profile, appears to be derived primarily from the with some elements taken from the . The idea of the headlights behind the grille might have been inspired by James Hetfield's . Another major influence for the Chino's design is the , seen in the shape of the grille as well as the front bumper, the hood and the roofline. The rear of the car might have been inspired by either the or the .\nThe Chino features a grilled front end, dual circular headlights and a chrome bumper, the latter bearing smaller unusable fog lights and the license plate. The hood bears a small Vapid logo on the front and an elevated center running towards the windshield. The sides are distinguished by the chrome elements on the fenders and the bottom, as well as around the windows, the door handles and the square rear-view mirrors. The rear end features twin tail lights surrounded by chrome trims, as well as a chrome bumper bearing the reverse lights and the license plate. Two exhaust pipes can be seen below. The vehicle borrows some of the badges found on the &lt;a href=\"Peyote\"&gt;Peyote&lt;/a&gt;, while having its own \"CHINO\" badge, applied to the rear end.\nThe Chino may appear as a hardtop coup\u00e9, but can be customized at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; to remove the roof entirely or replace it with a non-retractable fabric top. It is only available in a single color that is also applied on the interior stitching. It uses a set of custom wired wheels with low-profile tires, whose design is entirely unique compared to the wire-type lowrider rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nCurrent Design Gallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nSoft-top=\nTopless=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nOverall, the Chino is a fairly lacking car in terms of performance. It has a low acceleration because of its heavy weight, and the lowest top speed for its class. While the Chino is considered a Muscle car, its engine output is much lower than other cars, making it relatively easy to control and hard to spin out. Handling wise, the Chino is a very well handling Muscle, able to go through most corners without much effort. It still has its bouts of oversteer like any other Muscle, but when the Chino spins out, it is easy to correct. Crash deformation is above average, owing mostly to its large, heavy body which makes it resilient to physical damage and protects the engine sufficiently well. The car's width may prove to be an issue when attempting to cut in between lanes of traffic as it is abnormally wide for a car in general. Overall, the Chino is a good car for cruising around in, but otherwise, is a meager choice for competitive races."}

However, the car has received minor changes, where the rear fenders have the corresponding \"CHINO\" badges near the tail lights, being a bit larger than the one on the rear. Its interior is largely identical, but the rear has a smoother texture and adds a pair of speakers. Its underside is fitted with a paintable frame and has a visible driveshaft, a different exhaust setup (dual pipes instead of a single Y-split pipe), and visible hydraulic bars connected to the suspension.\nWhile the Chino Custom retains the primary color for the body and the interior stitching, the lower frames are also painted with a primary color, while the inner portions of the seats are painted with a secondary color. Both the interior and the dials can change colors as well. The vehicle also gets custom \"Big Worm\" lowrider wheels, along with white-wall tires.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Chino Custom improves upon the original by adding improved acceleration and slightly higher top speed. It feels more responsive in the corners as well because of the lower center of gravity. However, the cornering radius of the Chino Custom is slightly wider than the normal Chino, but this is only noticeable in extreme circumstances and will seldom be an issue in casual driving.\nSimilar to the regular version, the Chino Custom uses a heavy V8 engine, which is mated to a 4-speed gearbox and powers the rear wheels. It shares the same engine sound with the regular Chino, the &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Manana\"&gt;Manana&lt;/a&gt;."}

He is owned by &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt;, but he lives with Franklin for the majority of the game\u2019s storyline due to Lamar believing that Chop will be safer with him, which Franklin agrees to, saying that \u201cit\u2019s the best place for him anyway\u201d.\nDuring some missions, the player is able to switch to Chop in order to find certain people or checkpoints. Chop can also aid the player in finding &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Packages\"&gt;Hidden Packages&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nChop first appears in the mission &lt;a href=\"Chop%20%28mission%29\"&gt;named after him&lt;/a&gt;, where he is brought along by &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar&lt;/a&gt; to help kidnap a &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; member named &lt;a href=\"D\"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;. When D crashes his &lt;a href=\"Bati%20800\"&gt;motorcycle&lt;/a&gt; and attempts to escape on foot, Lamar and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; have no choice but to run after him on foot, using Chop's sense of smell to aid in locating him. The player can switch to Chop's point of view while he searches for D. Despite Franklin having to intervene when he's distracted by the prospect of humping a male dog, Chop is able to subdue D, allowing Lamar and Franklin to apprehend him and pull him into the &lt;a href=\"Speedo\"&gt;van&lt;/a&gt;. However, the duo are forced to free D when Lamar risks revealing their location. Once the mission has been completed, Lamar will call Franklin, asking him to take care of Chop for the time being, and from this moment on, Chop will spawn at Franklin's safehouse.\nChop later appears in the mission &lt;a href=\"Hood%20Safari\"&gt;Hood Safari&lt;/a&gt;, in which he accompanies Franklin, Lamar and &lt;a href=\"Trevor\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; as they do a deal with some Ballas on &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt;. The deal goes wrong, and a large gunfight ensues between the protagonists, the Ballas, and some policemen. Franklin orders Chop to go back home, to which Chop quickly flees the scene.\nChop appears once again in the mission &lt;a href=\"Predator%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Predator&lt;/a&gt;, in which he chases the &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20Brothers\"&gt;O'Neil Brothers&lt;/a&gt; with Franklin and helps him locate &lt;a href=\"Elwood%20O%27Neil\"&gt;Elwood O'Neil&lt;/a&gt; in the woods and take him out before he destroys Trevor's chopper with an &lt;a href=\"RPG\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt;. The player can switch to Chop's view in this mission again, while he tries to find Elwood.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nChop is still alive and living with Franklin as of &lt;a href=\"2021\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;. By this time, Franklin is Chop's official owner, as evidenced by Lamar referring to Chop as \"[Franklin]'s dog.\" In one of the &lt;a href=\"Security%20Contracts\"&gt;Security Contracts&lt;/a&gt;, Franklin mentions that he's the only one he knows of in his neighborhood that owns a dog, with others having more exotic pets instead.\nDuring the events of update, he is seen with Franklin at the &lt;a href=\"F.%20Clinton%20and%20Partner\"&gt;F. Clinton and Partner&lt;/a&gt; headquarters. He has aged noticeably since the events of \"Grand Theft Auto V\", with gray fur above his eyes and on his muzzle. Franklin mentions that he doesn't \"get around too much no more.\" The player can interact with Chop by petting him.\nChop also helps Franklin and Lamar fight some of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt; during the mission &lt;a href=\"Short%20Trip%20-%20Seed%20Capital\"&gt;Short Trip - Seed Capital&lt;/a&gt; by biting one of them and leading the two to the warehouse.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Agency%20Security%20Guard\"&gt;Agency Security Guard&lt;/a&gt; is fond of Chop, certain that the Rottweiler could still reach any intruders that might break into the agency and rip them apart despite his old age. The dog also keeps him company during the night and will do anything for treats, in the form of jerky.\nThe player could transform into Chop after consuming a &lt;a href=\"Peyote%20Plants%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;peyote plant&lt;/a&gt; in the backyard of the &lt;a href=\"Clinton%20Residence\"&gt;Clinton Residence&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Halloween%20Surprise%202019\"&gt;Halloween Surprise 2019&lt;/a&gt; event and from April 6 to April 13 in &lt;a href=\"2020\"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacter.\nInteractions.\nIt is possible for the player to obtain a throwable &lt;a href=\"Ball\"&gt;Ball&lt;/a&gt; in the weapon wheel, allowing them to be able to throw the ball for Chop to fetch. Chop will run after the ball and return it to the player, allowing them to pick it up and throw it again. If the player chooses to take Chop for a walk and gets into a car, Chop will get in the passenger seat of the car. Be aware that if the player has Chop with them and calls somebody on your phone to hang out, once they reach their location, Chop will get out of the car and run home while the friend gets into the front seat. For some reason, Chop will not ride in the back seat of any car and will not ride in the back of a van as he is shown doing in certain missions. He also ignores other vehicles (aerial or aquatic), although in &lt;a href=\"Predator%20%28mission%29\"&gt;a mission&lt;/a&gt; he can be seen aboard &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;Frogger&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player is able to take Chop for walks anywhere, but caution must be taken around busy streets or thoroughfares, as Chop's AI is sometimes not intelligent enough to avoid oncoming vehicles. He can be killed in gunfights, and can also fall into swimming pools or other bodies of water and drown after a period of time, but he will always spawn back unhappily at Franklin's house. While walking Chop, he can attack pedestrians if they are targeted by Franklin, or if they attack him first. This can result in a two-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; for Franklin and the police shooting Chop as well as Franklin.\nChop was customizable via the &lt;a href=\"IFruit%20App\"&gt;iFruit App&lt;/a&gt; on the player's Smartphone, by entering their &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games%20Social%20Club\"&gt;Rockstar Games Social Club&lt;/a&gt; account in the app, and it would be connected to their \"Grand Theft Auto V\" copy. From the app, the player was able to buy any type of colored collars for Chop. Once changed in the app, Chop would wear the customized Collar in your \"GTA V\" game. He could also be taught various simple tricks and commands through the app, such as \"sit\" and \"paw\". His happiness meter would be directly influenced by his wellbeing in iFruit, which affected his behavior in-game. After the iFruit App's servers shut down on December 12th, 2022, all these functionalities have been lost and it is no longer possible to take care of Chop. \nBehavior.\nSince Chop is an animal, no particular character traits can be distinguishable, and the only major determining factor for Chop's behavior is controlled through the iFruit app. If his happiness is low, Chop will be generally upset, and won't immediately respond to Franklin if he calls him or asks him to perform tricks. However, if his happiness level is high, he'll eagerly follow Franklin wherever he goes, and will perform tricks upon Franklin's request. Chop may bark or whine at the player if he approaches.\nChop is generally a friendly dog, but he will attack any NPC who inflicts injury to Franklin, or threatens him verbally. If the player throws a ball for Chop to fetch, he will always run over to pick it up, unless the ball lands in the water or in any other unreachable location. Chop's AI is shown to be quite intelligent, as he is able to navigate through corridors or obstacles with ease, always finding his way back to the player and rarely getting stuck.\nIn \"GTA Online\", Chop can be found on his bed, sitting next to Franklin, sleeping under &lt;a href=\"Imani\"&gt;Imani&lt;/a&gt;'s desk, or if the user has the personal quarters upgrade, he can be found sleeping on the player's bed or couch. If Chop is sitting next to Franklin, the user will be able to pet Chop."}

After chasing through the &lt;a href=\"Simmet%20Alley\"&gt;Simmet Alley&lt;/a&gt;, D is hit by a &lt;a href=\"Bus%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;bus&lt;/a&gt;, throwing him off the bike. He then runs off through a &lt;a href=\"Dashound%20Bus%20Center\"&gt;city bus terminal&lt;/a&gt;. Franklin and Chop jump out the van and the chase ensues on foot.\nThe chase continues into a &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Park%20Rail%20Yard\"&gt;railyard&lt;/a&gt;. Franklin loses the trail and the player is prompted to switch to Chop's point of view while he sniffs out D. During the search, Chop suddenly runs off across a nearby street, after having spotted another (male) &lt;a href=\"Dogs\"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt; of the same size. Chop begins humping the other dog, much to Franklin's chagrin. Eventually, the two continue their search and find D hiding inside a &lt;a href=\"boxcar\"&gt;boxcar&lt;/a&gt;. D jumps out and runs off again, but Franklin sends Chop after him. After a short chase Chop manages to bite D, forcing him to the ground.\nFranklin apprehends D and Lamar arrives with the van. After being forced into the van, D recognizes Lamar by his voice, the back of his head and the van's license plate reading his own name. Franklin takes the driver's seat and they drive back towards &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis%27%20House\"&gt;Lamar's house&lt;/a&gt;. During the ride, there is a brief conversation about D remembering Lamar and Franklin from when they were younger and Lamar makes a ransom call to the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; from his cell phone and demands &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;40,000 for D. Franklin tells Lamar that the Ballas and the LSPD will be able to trace the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;cell phone&lt;/a&gt; and will know where they are now. Franklin tosses the phone out of the van and forces Lamar to let D go. Franklin then drives to the &lt;a href=\"BJ%20Smith%20Recreational%20Center\"&gt;BJ Smith Recreational Center&lt;/a&gt; to drop off Lamar and Chop.\nIf the player hasn't received a message after &lt;a href=\"Repossession\"&gt;Repossession&lt;/a&gt;, Lamar will text Franklin that he got a new cell phone and that &lt;a href=\"Stretch%20%28character%29\"&gt;Stretch&lt;/a&gt; will be coming out of prison soon. Later, Lamar will call Franklin letting him know that Chop will stay at Franklin's house.\nWalkthrough.\nFollow Lamar.After the first cutscene, the player has to follow Lamar and Chop to an alley nearby. Franklin and Lamar will talk on the way. There are no destination markers on the map. If the player stops on the way, Lamar will stop, too, and comment about the player not walking where they should. Attracting any police attention during the walk will fail the mission.\nReturn to Lamar.If the player goes too far from Lamar, this objective will appear warning the player to return to Lamar. If the player continues to go away from Lamar the mission will fail.\nGet in the van.Upon arriving to the alley, the player has to enter Lamar's white &lt;a href=\"Speedo\"&gt;Speedo&lt;/a&gt;.\nWait for Lamar.When the player enters the van, Lamar will be getting Chop to enter the back of the van. The player has to wait for Lamar to enter the van.\nGo to Vinewood Boulevard.Drive to the alley in Vinewood Boulevard which is 1.36mi (2.19km) away from the van's location in Strawberry if following the GPS' legal route. On the way, one of four possible conversations will trigger, depending on the player's actions before the mission.\nGet back in the van.After a short cutscene the player has to chase D, who is on a &lt;a href=\"Bati%20801\"&gt;Bati 801&lt;/a&gt; motorcycle. The player needs to get in the van and then follow D through Los Santos. It is not possible to knock D off his bike or overtake him. If a player achieves to overtake D, his bike will speed up and will be able to very easily push the van out the way should the player stand on his path.\nEventually D will crash at Dashound Bus Center in La Mesa and the player will have to chase him through Mirror Park Rail Yard. The player should be careful at the bus center as there are moving cars and buses which can hit the player. After a short chase through the rail yard, D will hide among the boxcars, leaving Chop to sniff him out.\nThe same objective will appear if the player leaves the van on the way to Vinewood Boulevard, during the chase, and after kidnapping D.\nOpen boxcars to see if D is hiding inside.The player needs to open the first two boxcars to try find D. He will not be in either of them so Chop will continue sniffing out boxcars.\nGo to Chop and pull him off the dog.On the way to the second set of boxcars, Chop will get distracted by another dog. Calling Chop back will not work so the player has to walk over to him and pull him off. Chop will then continue sniffing out boxcars.\nChop will then find three boxcars where D could be hiding. D is hiding in the northernmost boxcar, one at which Chop will be barking. Opening the other two will do nothing, and once the boxcar with D inside opens, the chase will continue. Chop will catch up to D and take him down. The player needs to approach D and Chop to continue.\nIt is possible to switch to Chop and see things from his point of view, but not control him, at any point between D hiding and Franklin approaching D when Chop takes him down.\nTake D to Lamar's house.The player needs to drive Lamar, Chop, and D, to Lamar's house. On the way, Lamar will talk about getting ransom from the Ballas. Lamar will call demanding $40,000 while Franklin worries about being traced since Lamar is calling from a cell phone.\nStop the van to let D out.The player has to stop the van so D can get out.\nLose the Cops.If the player refuses to let D out and continues driving, they will receive a two-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;Wanted Level&lt;/a&gt;. The player will now have to lose the cops before letting D out.\nDrop Lamar off at the rec center.The final drive of the mission, after D is out, the player needs to take Lamar to BJ Smith Recreational Center. The mission ends once the player arrives at the destination.\nThere are no monetary rewards from this mission. Chop will be found at Franklin's house and he can be taken out on walks. Killing Franklin, Lamar, Chop, or D, and destroying the van, at any point will fail the mission."}

The team must take them out. Once all Guards have been killed, the team is then instructed to hack into the laptop in the Airfield's control tower to discover the locations of Merryweather outposts.\nMerryweather will try to take back control of the Airfield whilst a player is hacking, sending in reinforcements via land and air which the rest of the team must defend against.\nOnce the computer is hacked, the team is instructed to enter a &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt;, which there are two of at the Sandy Shores Airfield's helipad. These are used to take out Merryweather's outposts, the first of which is at the communications tower behind the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Sign\"&gt;Vinewood Sign&lt;/a&gt;.

They have an unknown number of children.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nAround the time of \"Just or Unjust\"'s broadcast on WKTT, his wife Lori had become angry about the amount of time he had been spending playing the fantasy computer game \"&lt;a href=\"Loot%20and%20Wank\"&gt;Loot and Wank&lt;/a&gt;\". She claims that Chuck would sometimes play the game until 2 a.m., and after coming to bed would \"grab her ass\" and \"treat her like a troll\" while saying \"two damage, two damage\". Despite this, Lori says that she till loves her husband, but wants him to know \"I'm not an avatar!\"\nUpon hearing the claim, &lt;a href=\"Judge%20Grady\"&gt;Judge Grady&lt;/a&gt; immediately tells Lori that she is an avatar, and the reason her husband was playing so much time playing \"Loot and Wank\" was because she \"got fat and stopped being sexy\". He advises her to do something positive by getting plastic surgery.\nChuck makes his counter-argument next, immediately stating that he thinks his wife is possessed by Satan, mainly down to the facts that \"she doesn't refill the ice tray, she hates my parents, she stopped giving me head, she spends all my money and thinks she's doing me a massive fucking favor sending out Christmas cards\". After Judge Grady asks about the Williams-Jones' hyphenated surname, Chuck states that it was Lori's idea, as he was born Chuck Williams; he went along with her because he thinks it's fair, as merging surnames \"comes from a time when women were considered property.\" He instead claims that \"women are defective and misbegotten, but I don't own her\" while adding on that he \"would like to own a human being some day\", particularly a \"young, nubile, &lt;a href=\"Philippines\"&gt;Filipino&lt;/a&gt; boy who can sit in my tropical hut and play games and decide who does what by playing hands-free catch the quarter.\"\nJudge Grady butts in to say that hyphenating his surname has turned Chuck into \"half a man\", and asks if he now pees sitting down, to which Chuck awkwardly replies that he does, though he also says that he has to agree to ensure he can still get laid. Lori backs this by telling Judge Grady that they have an equal household. She states that Chuck \"wears tampons whenever I do so that we may both experience the same burden when I'm on my flow.\"\nAt this point, Judge Grady takes the side of Chuck, simply because he is a man, going on to add \"you know who has made the most money throughout history? \"The man\". Who have been the great leaders? \"Men\". Maybe you had Cleopatra, but &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egyptians&lt;/a&gt; live in triangles, tetrahedrons and shit; a triangle is not manly. Who fought the best wars? \"Men\". Who makes the best murderers? \"Men\". Who invented the plague? \"Men\". Following this rant, he asks Lori \"so what if he wants to come home and spend time online with his guild and pleasure elves, running around with his Orcy friends? Let him.\"\nLori next begins to argue that Chuck needs to spend more time with their children, because they \"depend on us, we should be protecting, coddling our children, never letting them out of our sight, electronic tags on them at all times, making them paranoid and neurotic.\" After also adding that it's the future, Judge Grady turns to Chuck, asking him where his &lt;a href=\"Jetpack\"&gt;Jetpack&lt;/a&gt; is, to which he replies \"I don't have one, Your Honor.\" Judge Grady tells him this is correct because \"technology is a lie sent by Liberals to kill us, apart from weapons technology which we use to kill other people.\" He asks Lori if she has ever had a three-way, which she replies \"no Your Honor, it is revolting.\"\nAfter further disagreement, Lori finally breaks, telling the judge that \"This is insulting. This is a court of law. All that you've given me is a lot of dog penis and woman hating. What is wrong with you Judge Grady?\" He lets her know that this isn't a courtroom, it's a studio, and that he is more interested in ratings than justice. After apparently pleasuring himself under his robe while watching Lori argue, he returns to his quarters to make judgement.\nUpon returning, Judge Grady has Chuck tell Lori \"I love you baby, and I will always remember, how good this felt\" before telling him to \"smack that bitch\", to which Chuck duly agrees, slapping Lori across the face. Judge Grady laughs, conceding that this was just for his pleasure as he \"loves domestic violence\". Moving onto the real judgement, Judge Grady says that the courtroom audience names the game, and the plaintiff and defendant have to play it. The audience chooses a duel, meaning both Chuck and Lori get given a gun to kill the other with. Before Judge Grady can finish his next sentence, Chuck immediately picks up his gun, calls Lori a \"stupid whore\", then shoots her, killing her immediately. Judge Grady is annoyed by this, as he still has three minutes to kill before the ad-break. Because of this, he sentences Chuck to 30 days prison time, so that he can \"think about what you did to my ratings.\""}

Although, in 1992, real life store Kragen had a slightly different logo. Chuckup means an event in which one or many fails or mess up in a moment of opportunity, and they are ridiculed by peers."}

The car uses a set of modern headlamps with sharp edges on the outer sides, while the manufacturer badge can be seen above the grille. The bonnet features a bulged area on the centre and opens to reveal the engine bay, which bears the corresponding badges over the cam covers.\nThe sides of the car feature smooth lines passing through the doors and traditional side skirts, as well as chrome horizontal door handles.

Being the biggest crack cocaine baron in the area, Dwayne Forge made $50,000 per week and bought himself the &lt;a href=\"Triangle%20Club\"&gt;Triangle Club&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt; as well as a couple of porno shops in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;. During the late '90s there were several high profile convictions including that of Dwayne Forge, which were made with the help of police informant &lt;a href=\"Jayvon%20Simson\"&gt;Jayvon Simson&lt;/a&gt;.\n2000's and Playboy X's Empire.\nForge's young proteg\u00e9, &lt;a href=\"Playboy%20X\"&gt;Playboy X&lt;/a&gt;, then assumed control over empire at the age of 16. He has been running business with the advice of Forge from prison, who haven't lost all his connections, until &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, when he stopped visiting his former mentor. Under Playboy's leadership and rejecting Dwayne's old-fashioned views, the empire went from being exclusively about drugs to expanding into other realms of business, even legitimate, like real estate property. Still having the most success in drug sales, he became friends with &lt;a href=\"Elizabeta%20Torres\"&gt;Elizabeta Torres&lt;/a&gt; and monitored all drug deals in the city. His other connections included the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Lords\"&gt;Spanish Lords&lt;/a&gt; members, &lt;a href=\"Trunchez%20Brothers\"&gt;Trunchez Brothers&lt;/a&gt;, who took over &lt;a href=\"Triangle%20Club\"&gt;Triangle Club&lt;/a&gt; with Playboy's permission.\nOn the other hand, Playboy's ambitions of becoming a legitimate businessman and his less intimidating appearance may have weakened his influence on the streets, which led to uprising of new drug dealing factions. He lost control over &lt;a href=\"Northwood\"&gt;Northwood&lt;/a&gt;, which came into possession of the &lt;a href=\"Northwood%20Dominican%20Drug%20Dealers\"&gt;Dominican drug dealers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"North%20Holland\"&gt;North Holland&lt;/a&gt; became the base of operations for new ambitious crack cocaine dealers, such as &lt;a href=\"Marlon%20Bridges\"&gt;Marlon Bridges&lt;/a&gt;, the member of the &lt;a href=\"North%20Holland%20Hustlers\"&gt;North Holland Hustlers&lt;/a&gt; street gang. The control over &lt;a href=\"East%20Holland\"&gt;East Holland&lt;/a&gt; was lost to &lt;a href=\"Clarence%20Little\"&gt;Clarence Little&lt;/a&gt;, new ruthless crack cocaine and heroin distributor, who had &lt;a href=\"East%20Holland%20Drug%20Gang\"&gt;his own drug gang&lt;/a&gt; in a project housing block.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nBroker and Dukes.\nIn 2008, one of &lt;a href=\"Firefly%20Projects\"&gt;Firefly Projects&lt;/a&gt; gangs' members, &lt;a href=\"Jermaine%20Andrews\"&gt;Jermaine Andrews&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Easy%20Fare\"&gt;took a ride&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; to take some stolen merchandise from a vehicle. Because of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt;'s tight surveillance over him, they were ambushed by the police. Niko successfully escapes the ambush and drops Jermaine near the &lt;a href=\"Pay%27n%27Spray\"&gt;Pay'n'Spray&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Gibson%20Street\"&gt;Gibson Street&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater Niko is ordered by &lt;a href=\"Vlad%20Glebov\"&gt;Vlad Glebov&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Clean%20Getaway\"&gt;steal&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Compact\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; from another possible member of the gangs, &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Jimmy&lt;/a&gt;, as a payment for debt the hustler took from &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Faustin\"&gt;Mikhail Faustin&lt;/a&gt;'s loan shark. During this encounter Jimmy could be knocked out, killed or spared by Niko. His associate, anyway, would try to stop the car from being jacked by all means. Despite being encountered near &lt;a href=\"East%20Island%20City\"&gt;East Island&lt;/a&gt; projects, the two are probably the members of &lt;a href=\"Firefly%20Projects\"&gt;Firefly Projects&lt;/a&gt; gangs, according to their affiliations and behaviour.\n&lt;a href=\"Random%20characters\"&gt;Random character&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Meech\"&gt;Brian Meech&lt;/a&gt; is a client of African-American drug dealers and buys his crack cocaine supplies from them. He called his dealers \"scientists\" for creating the biggest crack rock he ever seen, which he bought during his second random encounter. In his last encounter with Niko he appears to be free of his addiction and plans to meet with the dealers to tell them about it. They attack him however for \"forgetting about pay the interest\", only to be killed, beat up or scared by Niko.\n&lt;a href=\"Most%20Wanted\"&gt;Most Wanted&lt;/a&gt; criminal &lt;a href=\"Tyler%20Pickrel\"&gt;Tyler Pickrel&lt;/a&gt;, convicted for human trafficking, is also killed by Niko in &lt;a href=\"Meadows%20Park\"&gt;Meadows Park&lt;/a&gt;, trying to run away on foot.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Exotic%20Exports\"&gt;Exotic Exports&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt; Niko can also encounters three Hustlers around a required vehicle in the &lt;a href=\"Firefly%20Projects\"&gt;Firefly Projects&lt;/a&gt;. They will attack him with the &lt;a href=\"baseball%20bat\"&gt;baseball bat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt;s after attempting to steal it.\nBohan.\nTwo &lt;a href=\"Yardies\"&gt;Jamaican gangsters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Little%20Jacob\"&gt;Little Jacob&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Real%20Badman\"&gt;Real Badman&lt;/a&gt;, also have a conflict with Hustlers at some point. a New drug crew, which sells marijuana on the corner in &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;, refuses to share the income with Badman, who claims the territory to belong to his posse. Niko &lt;a href=\"Shadow\"&gt;eliminates&lt;/a&gt; the crew after tracking down the dealer to their base of operation in their old &lt;a href=\"Supplier%27s%20Apartment\"&gt;apartment&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater in the storyline, after moving into &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;, Niko starts working for &lt;a href=\"Manny%20Escuela\"&gt;Manny Escuela&lt;/a&gt;, the former member of &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Lords\"&gt;Spanish Lords&lt;/a&gt; and present enemy of drug dealing. During their &lt;a href=\"Escuela%20of%20the%20Streets\"&gt;first meeting&lt;/a&gt;, Manny asks Niko to follow one of the Hustlers to their base of operation in the warehouse, when he leaves Niko to deal with them. Niko successfully wipes out the drug dealers.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Most%20Wanted\"&gt;Most Wanted&lt;/a&gt; missions player can encounter and kill &lt;a href=\"Maxwell%20Caughlin\"&gt;Maxwell Caughlin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Bohan\"&gt;South Bohan&lt;/a&gt; criminal, who is wanted for gang related violence. Maxwell drives a &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlgonquin.\nDuring the party in the &lt;a href=\"Elizabeta%20Torres\"&gt;Elizabeta Torres&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"South%20Bohan%20Projects\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; Niko meets Trey Stewart, alias &lt;a href=\"Playboy%20X\"&gt;Playboy X&lt;/a&gt;, the big time drug dealer from &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;. Elizabeta asks them to oversight &lt;a href=\"Blow%20Your%20Cover\"&gt;the heroin deal&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City Triads&lt;/a&gt;. The deal goes wrong as a &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;buyer&lt;/a&gt; appears to be a undercover police agent. Niko helps Playboy X to escape the ambush and gives him a ride to his &lt;a href=\"Playboy%20X%27s%20Penthouse\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;. Impressed by Niko's skills Playboy X asks him to visit him sometime for work.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; comes for the first time, he sees Playboy in the company of girls, having a little party in his luxury penthouse. The party, however, is broken by &lt;a href=\"Dwayne%20Forge\"&gt;Dwayne Forge&lt;/a&gt;, former mentor of Trey and founder of his empire. Dwayne just has been released from prison, where Playboy stopped visiting him four years ago. Playboy X, being confused, quickly leaves his friend alone with girls, just to take Niko to his &lt;a href=\"Deconstruction%20for%20Beginners\"&gt;first job&lt;/a&gt;. He asks him to take out &lt;a href=\"Messina%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Messina's goons&lt;/a&gt;, who occupied the construction site in &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Gardens\"&gt;Castle Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, which belongs to big estate-developer &lt;a href=\"Yusuf%20Amir\"&gt;Yusuf Amir&lt;/a&gt;. Playboy X, who has the ambitions of going legit, wants him to be his partner. Niko successfully kills all mobsters on site, which, however, doesn't lead to a partnership between Playboy X and Yusuf, since Yusuf has closed the site immediately after the accident in memory of the people who died there.\n&lt;a href=\"Photo%20Shoot\"&gt;The second task&lt;/a&gt; from Playboy X shows his conflict with &lt;a href=\"North%20Holland%20Hustlers\"&gt;North Holland Hustlers&lt;/a&gt; and his damaged reputation on the streets. Young and ambitious member of the gang, &lt;a href=\"Marlon%20Bridges\"&gt;Marlon Bridges&lt;/a&gt;, calls Playboy X a snitch and phoney, doubting his influence and respect between dealers. Niko is ordered to murder Marlon, who's hanging out with his associates from the gang on &lt;a href=\"Rubin%20Swinger%20Basketball%20Courts\"&gt;Rubin Swinger Basketball Courts&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Exeter%20Ave\"&gt;Exeter Ave&lt;/a&gt;. The task is successfully done by Niko.\nHaving the best intentions, &lt;a href=\"Playboy%20X\"&gt;Playboy X&lt;/a&gt; also tells Niko to help &lt;a href=\"Dwayne%20Forge\"&gt;Dwayne Forge&lt;/a&gt; with his problems, since his former mentor seems to be depressed after releasing from prison. He finds Dwayne in a &lt;a href=\"Dwayne%20Forge%27s%20Apartment\"&gt;old dirty appartment&lt;/a&gt;, complaining about his ex-girlfriend &lt;a href=\"Cherise\"&gt;Cherise&lt;/a&gt;, who left him to &lt;a href=\"Jayvon%20Simson\"&gt;Jayvon Simson&lt;/a&gt;. Niko &lt;a href=\"Ruff%20Rider\"&gt;finds&lt;/a&gt; the couple near the Videogeddon arcade in &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt;. He chases down and kills Jayvon, while Cherise can be killed or spared during the mission.\nDwayne Forge is also depressed about losing his influence and business after being arrested. His former &lt;a href=\"The%20Triangle%20Club\"&gt;club&lt;/a&gt; now belongs to &lt;a href=\"Trunchez%20Brothers\"&gt;Trunchez Brothers&lt;/a&gt;. Niko, feeling sorry for Dwayne, &lt;a href=\"Undress%20to%20Kill\"&gt;eliminates&lt;/a&gt; them and later receives the phone call from &lt;a href=\"Playboy%20X\"&gt;Playboy X&lt;/a&gt; who angrily says, that they were his associates and this conflict is bad for his business.\nThe conflict between Trey Stewart and Dwayne Forge grows and both ask Niko to &lt;a href=\"The%20Holland%20Play\"&gt;save one of them by killing the other&lt;/a&gt;. Niko is left with choice of killing Dwayne for reward of $25,000, or killing Playboy, surrounded by his bodyguards, for no reward from Dwayne, who lives in the poverty. If the second option is chosen, however, Dwayne finds his old papers for &lt;a href=\"Playboy%20X%27s%20Penthouse\"&gt;Playboy X's Penthouse&lt;/a&gt; and gives them to Niko, who now able to use it as a &lt;a href=\"Safehouses%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;safehouse&lt;/a&gt;. Dwayne can also become a friend of Niko and if their friendship percentage is high enough, provide Niko with backup of two African-American gangsters.\nNiko also has a large role in the elimination of the &lt;a href=\"East%20Holland%20Drug%20Gang\"&gt;East Holland Drug Gang&lt;/a&gt; on orders of &lt;a href=\"Francis%20McReary\"&gt;Francis McReary&lt;/a&gt;. the Deputy police commissioner is a client of &lt;a href=\"Clarence%20Little\"&gt;Clarence Little&lt;/a&gt; and blackmailed by him. He orders Niko to go into the Project Housing block controlled by the gang he leads and &lt;a href=\"Holland%20Nights\"&gt;kill him&lt;/a&gt;. After seeing his whole gang killed, Clarence surrenders to Niko and begs him for mercy, promising he will never hear of him again. Niko can spare him, just to encounter him later on the streets of &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the encounter, however, Clarence acts hostile towards Niko and threatens him with a &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;. Niko, asking him not to be a \"dick\", takes cover and after a small shootout finishes what has been started in &lt;a href=\"East%20Holland\"&gt;East Holland&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the remaining members of the &lt;a href=\"East%20Holland%20Drug%20Gang\"&gt;East Holland Drug Gang&lt;/a&gt; an unnamed lieutenant, contacts McReary to tell him, that he will tell the police about his sins. McReary orders Niko to &lt;a href=\"Lure%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;kill him&lt;/a&gt;, but the lieutenant is very careful after the latest events and never leaves his apartment. Niko takes the position in the roof across the road and lures the target to the window only to shoot him with a &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;sniper rifle&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlderney.\nPlayer can encounter Hustlers in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt; only during a random meet with &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Bytchkov\"&gt;Ivan Bytchkov&lt;/a&gt;, if he was spared in &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20the%20Not%20So%20Terrible\"&gt;Ivan the Not So Terrible&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Most%20Wanted\"&gt;Most Wanted&lt;/a&gt; missions, exluding their presence in &lt;a href=\"Acter\"&gt;Acter&lt;/a&gt; as pedestrians. Ivan Bytchkov, who became a money lender, has clients among Hustlers. He has a meeting with them in the alley next to &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Clubhouse\"&gt;The Lost Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;. Niko escorts him and later kills the hustlers for attacking Ivan and refusing to pay their debts.\n&lt;a href=\"Danny%20Hatmaker\"&gt;Danny Hatmaker&lt;/a&gt;, most wanted criminal and arms-dealer, is killed by Niko along with his well armed crew in &lt;a href=\"Normandy\"&gt;Normandy&lt;/a&gt; in order to complete &lt;a href=\"Most%20Wanted\"&gt;Most Wanted&lt;/a&gt; mission.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nBroker and Dukes.\nIn 2009, with the Rascalov Mafiya gone, the Firefly Projects set expanded their drug dealing businesses through Dimitri's former turfs in Beachgate and Firefly Island. Kenny Petrovic's Russian Mafia from Hove Beach may also appear at certain times in their turf (mostly during &lt;a href=\"Rampage%21\"&gt;Rampages&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Huang%20Lee\"&gt;Huang Lee&lt;/a&gt; can &lt;a href=\"Drug%20Dealing\"&gt;interact&lt;/a&gt; with two drug dealers in Broker: &lt;a href=\"Andy\"&gt;Andy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clay\"&gt;Clay&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlgonquin.\nThe North Holland Hustlers are still found predominantly in their turf in North Holland by 2009. Huang Lee can interact with four drug dealers in Algonquin: &lt;a href=\"Big%20B.\"&gt;Big B.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dayton\"&gt;Dayton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20%28GTA%20Chinatown%20Wars%29\"&gt;Eddie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trone\"&gt;Trone&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nHustlers can be identified by their flashy, hip-hop inspired attire, such as baggy clothing as well as sneakers, Hinterland boots and jewelry. Younger members of the gang tend to dress with down jackets, hoodies with or without furry hoods, very long T-shirts, brightly colored tracksuits and bomber jackets, baggy jeans, bright sneakers, platinum jewelry, durags, bandanas, and LC caps. Older members seem to dress more conservatively, preferring plain hoodies, leather coats, jeans, dark sneakers, platinum or gold chains, flat caps, and beanies.\nThey can be found hanging around and talking in groups or walking around in their territory as well as driving around in customized black &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Landstalker\"&gt;Landstalker&lt;/a&gt;s or any other un-modified car. Their favorite radio stations are &lt;a href=\"The%20Beat%20102.7\"&gt;The Beat 102.7&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Classics%20104.1\"&gt;The Classics 104.1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Vibe%2098.8\"&gt;The Vibe 98.8&lt;/a&gt;. In \"GTA Chinatown Wars\", they drive around in white &amp; blue &lt;a href=\"Voodoo%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Voodoo&lt;/a&gt;s and listen to &lt;a href=\"Ticklah\"&gt;Ticklah&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"DJ%20Khalil\"&gt;DJ Khalil&lt;/a&gt;.\nHustler lifestyle appears to have originated amongst youths in the city, as &lt;a href=\"Dwayne%20Forge\"&gt;Dwayne Forge&lt;/a&gt; became druglord when he was 18, then when Dwayne went to prison, &lt;a href=\"Playboy%20X\"&gt;Playboy X&lt;/a&gt; took over his business aged only sixteen (based on ages from the LCPD database). &lt;a href=\"Clarence%20Little\"&gt;Clarence Little&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of &lt;a href=\"East%20Holland%20Drug%20Gang\"&gt;East Holland Drug Gang&lt;/a&gt;, also is only 23. Random hustlers on the street can be heard saying about going back to school.\nLike almost every gang in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", if the player walks or runs into a member, hits a member with a car, starts a fight, aims a weapon at them or shoots a weapon in their territory they will often react with hostility.\n&lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;Pay 'n' Spray&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Gibson%20Street\"&gt;Gibson Street&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hove%20Beach\"&gt;Hove Beach&lt;/a&gt; belongs to one of the gangs and &lt;a href=\"Triangle%20Club\"&gt;Triangle Club&lt;/a&gt; was a former property of &lt;a href=\"Dwayne%20Forge\"&gt;Dwayne Forge&lt;/a&gt; before he went to prison. Hustlers primarily make money through marijuana, crack, cocaine and heroin distribution, as well as vehicle theft and selling stolen car parts, but, as their name suggests, involved in all types of criminal activity. They also have influence in &lt;a href=\"South%20Bohan\"&gt;South Bohan&lt;/a&gt; as they operate out of an apartment, warehouse and a garage for their drug-trafficking operations, and one of the Hustlers, &lt;a href=\"Maxwell%20Caughlin\"&gt;Maxwell Caughlin&lt;/a&gt;, can be found there during &lt;a href=\"Most%20Wanted\"&gt;Most Wanted&lt;/a&gt; missions.

The B variant is utilized by the US Marines and is the STOVL (Short-take off and Vertical Landing) / VTOL (Vertical Takeoff and Landing) version. The Hydra's cockpit resembles the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, especially the below the HUD, which is directly taken from that of the F-16. The Hydra's air intakes are from the AV-8B, as well as the side air holes and the four rotatable exhaust nozzles. In fact, the entire VTOL system of the Hydra is still based on the AV-8B Harrier II, rather than the F-35B's Lift Fan System, two steering nozzles and rotatable \"Lobster Back\" exhaust for its main engine.\nThe aircraft assumes a much bulkier construction compared to the \"GTA San Andreas\" iteration, having a triangular-shaped nose with an air data probe/sensor on the end, as well as a glass canopy that pivots from the front (rather than from the right like its previous iteration). The main section of the aircraft has large intakes beside the fuselage, four vectoring nozzles on either side, and lower hatches for the main landing undercarriage, while the wings hold the corresponding ailerons on each side, six weapon pylons below, and long gear struts that pivot to the rear when the landing gear is retracted. The rear/tail area has two large s, two long vertical stabilizers and a single jet turbine. The aircraft bears a registration code on the tips of the vertical stabilizers and is utilized by the &lt;a href=\"Military%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe interior of the aircraft is very similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt;, being a compact cabin with a narrow instrument panel, green display screens and a control stick on each side. In the enhanced version, it uses the same \"Lazer\" dials from the aforementioned fighter jet and several other aircraft.\nThe aircraft is only seen in a light gray colour with a subtle digital camo livery. It also uses a set of industrial wheels also used on the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Savage\"&gt;Savage&lt;/a&gt;.\nSimilar to the P-996 LAZER, the Hydra is equipped with dual cannons below the fuselage and just beside the front main landing gear, as well as six radar-guided missiles on both wings appearing to be modeled after the (which uses smaller rockets derived from the &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt;, similar to the P-996 LAZER).\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto San Andreas\".\nVehicle.\nThe Hydra is the most sophisticated aircraft in the game, boasting a variety of equipment. One of its more prominent abilities is its (Vertical Takeoff and Landing) capabilities, which allow it to hover, descend or ascend vertically like a helicopter, and travel horizontally like an airplane; these abilities are achieved by directing thrust from four jet outlets downwards or backward using specific directional controls (by pushing forward/backwards on console, or by holding down / or / on &lt;a href=\"PC\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;, by default. On the iOS version, it snaps forward automatically at a moderate speed). Due to its excellent engine and maneuverability, the Hydra is the fastest and most fail-deadly aircraft (and one of the fastest vehicles) in the game, and one of the easiest to fly when the player learns the basics of fixed-wing flight. It is able to travel from the southernmost point in Los Santos to the northernmost point of Las Venturas in roughly 60 seconds (1 in-game hour). However, similar aircraft, like the &lt;a href=\"Rustler\"&gt;Rustler&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stuntplane\"&gt;Stuntplane&lt;/a&gt;, can still be more agile. Flying the plane efficiently still requires increased concentration; one mistake can send it plummeting towards the ground.\nThe Hydra is generally the most preferred aircraft for its speed, agility, and weapons which make it an excellent choice for nearly any purpose requiring an airplane. Its chief disadvantage comes not from the vehicle itself, but the game engine. High-speed flight can allow the plane to hit objects, such as trees, before they've become visible due to model/texture loading being slower than the plane itself (this process is also nick-named 'pop-in'). Another drawback is that there is no passenger or co-pilot seat, restricting it to only carry one person, making it unsuitable for several-man transport.\nUnlike the &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt; in ' and ', &lt;a href=\"Vigilante\"&gt;Vigilante&lt;/a&gt; side-missions cannot be started nor performed using the Hydra.\nThe aircraft is powered by a single engine and produces the same loud sound from jet-powered aircraft such as the &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;Shamal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"AT-400\"&gt;AT-400&lt;/a&gt;.\nWeaponry/Features.\nThe Hydra is well-known for being one of the best performing in-game vehicles when it comes to combat, being on par with the &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;. The Hydra comes with the following:\n\"GTA San Andreas\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMissiles (both)=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nSimilar to the \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition, the Hydra is able to switch between vertical and horizontal flight by pressing right on the D-pad (holding left joystick on Enhanced and E&amp;E versions) on consoles, or holding down G (F on Enhanced and E&amp;E versions) on the keyboard on PC.\nWhen in horizontal flying mode, the Hydra has the highest top speed in the game (in the Enhanced and E&amp;E versions, it is beaten by the &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pyro\"&gt;Pyro&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"F-160%20Raiju\"&gt;F-160 Raiju&lt;/a&gt;), at 145 knots / 268 km/h while under 250 meters / 820 feet MSL, and 181.8 knots / 336.8 km/h while higher than 250 meters / 820 feet MSL. However, the Hydra is relatively heavy thus has slightly slower acceleration than the Lazer, and when performing a vertical climb, the Hydra will start to lose speed and eventually stall out, unlike the P-996 Lazer which will continue to gain altitude. The Hydra has acceptable maneuverability, being able to quickly pitch, yaw and roll in any direction; however, due to the Hydra's extra weight, it is one of the least maneuverable jets, only beating the &lt;a href=\"V-65%20Molotok\"&gt;V-65 Molotok&lt;/a&gt; in a tight circle.\nWhen in VTOL mode, the Hydra is surprisingly less maneuverable than its previous rendition; it is easily controllable in this mode, but has difficulty pitching downwards to engage targets, and has trouble correcting its momentum. It has a tendency to continue moving in the direction it was traveling if switched into VTOL mode, and also takes a while to ascend and descend in the same mode. The VTOL capabilities make using the vehicle's weaponry much easier, but it is a double-edged sword; it is not as maneuverable as a helicopter and responds to inputs differently. It is difficult to slow down from flight mode into hover mode and the throttle must be constantly modulated, otherwise the engine will cut out if the Hydra is close to the ground. If slowed down to the point that the main engine shuts off, switching to VTOL mode and accelerating will not start the engine, preventing any thrust coming through the nozzles, and the plane will plummet to the ground. One should be careful when using the Hydra in VTOL mode to attack targets, since it also makes the Hydra much more vulnerable to direct fire and leaving very little chance of dodging rockets from the &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt; and locked-on Homing Missiles from the &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Launcher\"&gt;Homing Launcher&lt;/a&gt; and most weaponized aircraft. Also, when switching to flight mode, the Hydra may lose a small amount of altitude before it takes flight, therefore it is not suitable to change to Jet mode mid-air while very close to the ground or near buildings. If the Hydra plummets to the ground with retracted landing gears, there is an opportunity to change to VTOL mode if the player reacts quickly before it results in an imminent crash. This problem is negated if the Hydra is flying forward while it transforms to flight mode. It also suffers from the Lazer's tendency to wobble in flight due to turbulence, as well as its unresponsive controls if the afterburner is not engaged.\nThe Hydra's VTOL capabilities make it able to land basically anywhere as long as there is enough space available for the aircraft to safely land. The pilot of a Hydra can also land and take off just like a normal plane if the controlling player wishes to do so, having greater stability to perform sharp turns on land compared to the Lazer. Care should be taken when landing in VTOL mode, as the aircraft may bounce slightly away from the ground, thus triggering the ejection mode if the player is not careful on the exit. With VTOL mode and the rudder imputs, one can basically spin the aircraft at any safe direction before take-off, in case the aircraft is facing a building or another obstacle.\nOverall, the Hydra can be considered as a VTOL counterpart to the Lazer. Its finicky performance in VTOL mode is realistic; VTOL aircraft are not like helicopters and, while able to, are not designed to operate in hover mode, which is usually only for takeoff and landings. Despite being a little heavier, the VTOL features make the Hydra a very deadly aircraft with its weaponry (if players take the time to learn its unique quirks), which is partially balanced by not only its price, but also by the fact that the vehicle is not available outright to players in \"GTA Online\". However, as of the update (&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Editions\"&gt;enhanced version&lt;/a&gt; only), the Hydra can be purchased outright, albeit at an even greater price.\nAgain, the aircraft is powered by a single turbojet engine and is equipped with an . It also shares the sound with the Lazer.\nArmor.\nThe Hydra is as durable as the Lazer and not as every other airplane without armor upgrades, being able to take two homing missiles or &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper Mk II&lt;/a&gt; explosive rounds, or three &lt;a href=\"Railgun\"&gt;Railgun&lt;/a&gt; rounds before being destroyed. However, a direct explosive hit to the plane's rear will usually blast away some of the Hydra's control surfaces. While it is still possible to pilot the plane like this, the plane may lose the ability to maneuver along certain axes and the engine will usually have been damaged as well (indicated by the afterburner struggling to ignite or heavy smoke), and another hit to the plane will destroy the aircraft completely.\nWith the introducing of newer, more specialized aircraft since the release of the update, the Hydra's lack of countermeasures proves to be a significant risk, as ground vehicles with significantly more reliable, faster, longer-range or more accurate missile attachments (such as the &lt;a href=\"Oppressor\"&gt;Oppressor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deluxo\"&gt;Deluxo&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Chernobog\"&gt;Chernobog&lt;/a&gt;) can easily target a Hydra and take it down, putting the pilot in an extremely difficult position, given the accuracy of these missiles make them difficult to avoid, especially in open-space areas. Also, many aircraft introduced in the Smuggler's Run update also have a lead against the Hydra in both speed and maneuverability; even the &lt;a href=\"Seabreeze\"&gt;Seabreeze&lt;/a&gt; is a surprisingly maneuverable plane, being better at turning a tighter circle than the Hydra, and the &lt;a href=\"Pyro\"&gt;Pyro&lt;/a&gt; takes the lead with the fastest acceleration and superior maneuverability. Despite these disadvantages in agility, the Hydra more than makes up for it in sheer firepower. Most of the Smuggler's Run aircraft cannot withstand much fire from the Hydra's powerful cannon.\nThe Hydra does not have any flares or other types of counter-measures against locked-on missiles that are fired at the jet, forcing the pilot to manually evade the missile.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nHydra=\nCannon=\nMissiles=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nUpon being converted into a personal aircraft, the Hydra can be repainted with just a primary color for the entirety of the vehicle, excluding the vectoring nozzles and the intakes. The nose and wing armaments will only be slightly tinted. The digital camo livery will be also removed, causing it to have a more uniform color."}

Similar to the &lt;a href=\"Tailgater%20S\"&gt;Tailgater S&lt;/a&gt;, the headlight setup may be inspired by the signature \"Thor's Hammer\" headlights seen on modern , more specifically the . The headlights also look somewhat similar to the .\nBoth \"Tenshun Camouflage\" liveries are inspired by the digital camo livery seen on the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe front end of the vehicle features a narrow mesh intake that spans about half the car's width and has silver/chrome trim around and a central number plate in front of it, followed by smaller intakes on the outer edges that also have silver/chrome trim around. Slightly above the central intake, there is a large mesh grille that bears silver/chrome trim around and the Obey logo on the upper side, while the sections between the grille and the outer intakes have inset formations. Beside the upper edges of the grille, there is the headlamp sets, consisting of dual LED-like units, modern strips and small outer indicators. The bonnet has curved lines starting from the inner edges of the headlamps and then leading towards each side of the windscreen, opening to reveal a plastic cover and small vents in the centre.\nOn the sides, the vehicle has flared fender arches and distinctive shapes for the skirt area, while the doors have additional body lines starting from the headlamps and leading towards the tail lamps, together with horizontal handles. The cabin area makes use of silver/chrome trim around the side windows and black inner pillars, while the roof has a sunroof on the front area and a small spoiler above the rear window. A set of mirror wings can be seen on each side of the front doors, which have painted sections on their upper halves.\nThe rear of the car consists of a large compartment door that bears the Obey logo in the centre and a dedicated section below for the number plate. The tail lamps are located in plastic housings and have a similar layout to the headlamps, consisting of outer indicators and dual main units on the edges, and dual brake units on the compartment door. The bumper area is relatively simple and bears a distinctive formation on the upper side, while the bottom bears silver/chrome trim and a grey section in the centre. The underside of the vehicle is mostly covered by a large plate with circular vents.\nThe interior of the vehicle is similar to vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"BeeJay%20XL\"&gt;BeeJay XL&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Granger\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt;. However, it uses the same dials from cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Raiden\"&gt;Raiden&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Neon\"&gt;Neon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Imorgon\"&gt;Imorgon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe primary colour of the vehicle is applied to the bodywork and the upper portions of the mirror shells, while the secondary colour is applied to the interior stitching. It uses a set of five-spoke rims with bolt details around the centre, wrapped in medium-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe acceleration of the I-Wagen is extraordinary compared to any SUV in the game, going from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 2.2 seconds which makes it the quickest vehicle in the SUV class. However, the major disadvantage is its top speed, reaching only 91.5 MPH, making it the second slowest SUV in the game, only slightly beating the &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;. Handling is exceptional, and the vehicle also has great braking to help it navigate corners.\nThe vehicle is powered by an electric battery, providing direct transmission to all wheels (52%-48%, front-to-rear torque distribution). Being an electric vehicle, it has a very low sound, only heard in quiet areas and with the radio volume off."}

{"id": "36519", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=36519", "title": "IFP", "text": "IFP is the animation format of the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series since \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\". With \"\", there came a new version of the file format, but it still supports animations with the old version. IFP files can contain several single animations which are split up to objects and linked to the animated object or actor in that way. Each object contains a certain number of frames including a time key. Two frames are interpolated by the game.\nFile Specification.\nVersion 1.\nVersion 1 packages are split up as usual into several data structures. The values of those structures are identified by 4 byte information markers. Those are 4 characters describing the following value(s). Note that the only markers which are really used are \"DGAN\" and \"NAME\". All others are simply waste of space. Do not search for them in your code, because not all animations got information markers where they are expected. Sometimes they are also simply zero.\nOffsets are always relative to the current file position. To convert a relative offset to an absolute one just add the number of read bytes.\nStrings are always padded to 4 byte bounds. The \"AnimNameLength\" string after the \"NAME\" information marker describes the string including the terminating zero-byte. You have to round up this value until the number is able to be divided by 4 without any rest, to get the number of bytes you have to write.\nHeader.\n 4b - FourCC - \"ANPK\" (Animation Package, Version identifier)\n 4b - Int32 - Offset to the end of the file\n 4b - FourCC - \"INFO\"\n 4b - Int32 - Offset to end of header\n 4b - Int32 - Number of animations\n Xb - Char[X] - Null-terminated string (internal file name used in the script)\nAnimation.\n 4b - FourCC - \"NAME\"\n 4b - Int32 - Length of the name of the animation (X)\n Xb - char[X] - Animation name (null-terminated string)\n 4b - FourCC - \"DGAN\"\n 4b - Int32 - Offset to the end of the animation (including it's content)\n 4b - FourCC - \"INFO\"\n 4b - Int32 - Offset to first object (usually 0x08)\n 4b - Int32 - Number of objects in the animation\n 4b - Int32 - NULL\nObject.\n 4b - FourCC - \"CPAN\"\n 4b - Int32 - Offset to end of object\n 4b - FourCC - \"ANIM\"\n 4b - Int32 - Offset to the start of frames (usually 0x2C)\n 28b - Char[28] - Object name (null-terminated string)\n 4b - Int32 - Number of frames\n 4b - Int32 - NULL\n 4b - Int32 - Next sibling\n 4b - Int32 - Previous sibling\nFrame Info.\n 4b - FourCC - Type\n 4b - Int32 - End of frame data\nFrame Types.\nFrame types define the size and the content of a frame. Actually there are 3 known types. Each frame type identifier starts with K which corresponds to \"Keyframe\". The following 3 bytes define the order and the content of the data. They are ASCII encoded characters\n R - Rotation\n T - Translation\n S - Scale\n 0 - None\nTranslation is a vector describing a difference in position relative to the current offset in the world as defined by parent frames. For &lt;a href=\"cutscene\"&gt;cutscene&lt;/a&gt;s it is relative to an offset given in a special file. Usually just the root object contains translated frames.\nFrame Data.\nEach type has a different structure. They can be combined and are read by the game in the order they are written in the type value.\n // Rotation\n 4b - Float - X\n 4b - Float - Quaternion Y\n 4b - Float - Quaternion Z\n 4b - Float - Quaternion W\n // Translation\n 4b - Float - Position X\n 4b - Float - Position Y\n 4b - Float - Position Z\n // Scale\n 4b - Float - Scale X\n 4b - Float - Scale Y\n 4b - Float - Scale Z\nEvery frame got one last floating value at the end describing the time in seconds.\n 4b - Float - Time\nVersion 2.\nVersion 2 archives got basically the same hierarchy as above, but the structures are a bit different. In version 2 all strings are null-terminated, but they got a constant size of 24 bytes.\nHeader.\n 4b - FourCC - 'ANP3' (Animation Package 3, Version identifier. However there is no pack with ANP2)\n 4b - Int32 - Offset to end of file\n 24b - Char[24] - internal file name used in the script\n 4b - Int32 - Number of Animations\nAnimation.\n 24b - Char[24] - Animation Name\n 4b - Int32 - Number of Objects\n 4b - Int32 - Size of frame data\n 4b - Int32 - Unknown, always 1\nThe size of data value is a number of bytes which corresponds to the exact size of the frame's usable data, including the compressed coordinates and rotation info.\nObject.\n 24b - Char[24] - Object Name\n 4b - Int32 - Frame type: Child = 3, Root = 4\n 4b - Int32 - Number of Frames\n 4b - Int32 - Bone ID\nFrame.\nRoot frames usually follow the following structure:\n 2b - Int16 - Quaternion X\n 2b - Int16 - Quaternion Y\n 2b - Int16 - Quaternion Z\n 2b - Int16 - Quaternion W\n 2b - Int16 - Time (in seconds)\n 2b - Int16 - Translation X\n 2b - Int16 - Translation Y\n 2b - Int16 - Translation Z\nChild sections normally have no translation values:\n 2b - Int16 - Quaternion X\n 2b - Int16 - Quaternion Y\n 2b - Int16 - Quaternion Z\n 2b - Int16 - Quaternion W\n 2b - Int16 - Time (in seconds)\nTo convert quaternion and translation values to floating values divide them by 4096 and to convert the time to a floating value divide it by 60.\nThe time is the total delta time from the start of the object count and not the respective delta time from the previous frame."}

{"id": "103267", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=103267", "title": "IFruit App", "text": "The iFruit App was a companion application for \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" that allowed players to perform various tasks for in-game benefit, as well as access other \"Grand Theft Auto\" content. As of December 12th, 2022, the app was no longer supported and was removed from the App Store and Google Play.\nDescription.\nThe app was meant to replicate the UI of an &lt;a href=\"iFruit\"&gt;iFruit&lt;/a&gt; phone, a clear parody of &lt;a href=\"Apple%20iOS\"&gt;Apple iOS&lt;/a&gt;, specifically iOS 6. Within the \"home screen\", the app included a &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; app that allowed players to remotely customize and make custom plates for their previously used vehicles in \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\", a Chop the Dog app that allowed players to train and play mini games with &lt;a href=\"Chop\"&gt;Chop&lt;/a&gt;, settings for the app itself, and various links to other \"Grand Theft Auto\"-related apps, games, and website.\nDevice availability.\nThe app was available for:\nShutdown/Replacement.\nIn the final few years of the iFruit App's existence, consistent updates and support became slowed and the app became entirely nonfunctional on newer versions of iOS and Android. On December 12th, 2022, the app was officially dropped and delisted by Rockstar Games, with a promise of a new service to replace the LS Customs app's Custom License Plates functionality coming soon. No replacement for the Chop the Dog app has been announced or speculated.\nOn April 13th, 2023, as part of the Rockstar Newswire message for &lt;a href=\"Boor%20Week\"&gt;Boor Week&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"License%20Plate%20Creator\"&gt;License Plate Creator&lt;/a&gt; was announced. This web browser-based page allows players to create up to 30 custom plates that can be applied to vehicles in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;. This new site would be launched the following week on April 20th alongside the &lt;a href=\"Shake%20Up%20and%20Top%20Marks%20Week\"&gt;Shake Up and Top Marks Week&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Events\"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;.\nLS Customs.\nThe LS Customs app allowed the player to modify the &lt;a href=\"Protagonist\"&gt;protagonists'&lt;/a&gt; vehicles, changing the color of the car, adding different colors of tire smoke, and more. This allowed the player to no longer have to start the game when they need to customize their vehicle. When the user ordered the customisations made to the car in the app, the order was processed when the player next enters the game. The player would then be prompted to take the vehicle to the nearest &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; to apply the customisations. &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;Money&lt;/a&gt; was taken from the protagonist to pay any modifications.\nFor \"GTA V\", the app would not always display the personal vehicle of the protagonist - it would display the last vehicle driven in the game as that protagonist (i.e. if a player last played as Franklin driving a &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20XS\"&gt;Sentinel XS&lt;/a&gt;, the information about that car would show up in the app). For \"GTA Online\" access to each of the online player's 30 customisable vehicles at one time was not possible within the app. The app only displayed the last 10 personal vehicles used per online character.\nThe &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;online player&lt;/a&gt; could also add up to 30 &lt;a href=\"Custom%20Vehicle%20License%20Plates\"&gt;custom license plates&lt;/a&gt; (increased from a single plate in the update), which allowed an individual custom plate to be applied to every vehicle the player can store in their online garages. \nChop the Dog.\nChop the Dog was a mini-game app which focused on taking care of a virtual version of &lt;a href=\"Chop\"&gt;Chop&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout the day (in real life), the user would get notifications from the app whenever Chop was hungry, thirsty or lazy. The player then must give him food and water, along with taking him for walks.\nChop would throw up and get upset if the player overfed him, decreasing his happiness (recognizable by the bone located on the top left corner of the screen). Occasionally, Chop would also defecate, requiring the player to use the glove icon to pick it up and put it in the appropriate trash can.\nPlayers could also use the app to teach Chop new tricks and switch the color of his leash. Chop could perform any trick he learned in the app in \"GTA V\", his leash color in the game would also reflect the one chosen in the app.\nIf the player chose to take Chop for a walk, they could chose between 3 different stages (Park, Street and Beach). Once the stage is chosen, a mini-game starts, with the player in control of Chop. The task that must be completed depended on the stage selected:\nFailing any of the mini-games resulted in Chop's happiness decreasing. Winning a gold medal in all 3 mini-games unlocked an exclusive gold leash to be used by Chop.\nFeeding Chop food and water, teaching him tricks and buying leashes would cost credits, which were generated throughout the day (in real life) or could be obtained in the mini-games.\nKeeping Chop happy was important as it allowed him to behave well and perform the new tricks you teach him. Killing Chop in \"GTA V\" resulted in Chop's Happiness draining completely.\nSettings.\nThe settings menu allowed the player to link the app to their &lt;a href=\"Social%20Club\"&gt;Social Club&lt;/a&gt; account and switch platforms from one console to another if they had migrated from &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PS3&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V%23Next-Gen%20%26amp%3B%20PC%20Versions\"&gt;enhanced version of GTA V&lt;/a&gt;. The player could also link to their Facebook account, which allowed players to post iFruit App updates to their Facebook wall. \nTutorial notifications could also be reset for the LSC and Chop apps. Chop notifications could be enabled or disabled. \nLinks.\nWeb links were provided to:\nReception.\nThe iFruit App received mixed to negative reviews, most notably from its limited options for Los Santos Customs and problematic loading times for both the iOS and Android. Many fans have also expressed much detest for the iFruit App as it strips away some features that could have been placed within the game itself, such as the inability to train Chop without installing the App on a Smartphone."}

Instead, GTA Vice City Stories reuses the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"\" rendition of the Idaho.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%23Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;development of GTA III&lt;/a&gt;, the Idaho was named the \"&lt;a href=\"Hachura\"&gt;Hachura&lt;/a&gt;\", a name previously used for another car in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\", furthermore, one of the &lt;a href=\"Wrecks\"&gt;car wrecks&lt;/a&gt; that can be seen in most of the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; games uses a similar model as the beta version of GTA III's rendition of Idaho.\nPerformance.\nDue to its heavy build and soft suspension, the Idaho lacks serious performance credentials, with poor speed and steering. This places the car at a standing that is even lower than that of an &lt;a href=\"Esperanto%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Esperanto&lt;/a&gt;, but is still faster than a &lt;a href=\"Manana\"&gt;Manana&lt;/a&gt;. Braking is rather poor, with no ABS at all. It is in \"GTA III\" one of the only two cars (the other being the &lt;a href=\"FBI%20Kuruma\"&gt;FBI Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;) to actually scrape its front bumper on the ground when fully braking. A good strategy is to use the handbrake instead of the regular brakes to turn corners. The vehicle suffers the same braking problem as the Esperanto, where (especially in \"GTA III\", where Claude cannot jump from a moving car) an Esperanto travelling at high speed on fire can be lethal for the player inside it. Short of crashing into an obstacle like a tree, the player has little chance to escape before it blows up."}

After many texts from &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; begging him to do the deal, Niko accepts and comes to the conclusion holding grudges is foolish and so he goes with &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Bell\"&gt;Phil Bell&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Port%20Tudor\"&gt;exchange point&lt;/a&gt;.\nDimitri calls Niko to say that he has killed the buyers' representatives, and will keep the heroin for himself. Unfortunately, Niko and Phil are already in the buyers' compound. Believing they will not be able to escape the territory of the newly betrayed buyers without a fight, the pair decide that they will steal the money.\nA massive gunfight ensues in the buyers' warehouse HQ, followed by a car chase when one of the buyers escapes with the money.

Niko meets up with Phil from his apartment in Tudor, and he'll tell Niko that they are going to Port Tudor. Go to the docks. On the way Phil explains the plan; Dimitri is going to hand over the heroin to the buyers while they collect the cash. Head inside the docks. Dimitri then calls Niko and tells him that he has killed the guys collecting the heroin and suggests that Niko and Bell break into the compound and collect the money off of them anyway. Niko then tells Phil and Phil says if they're fighting, they're fighting for the money. Follow Phil. He will climb to the roof of the warehouse and shoot the glass of the skylight.\nJump into the skylight and immediately gain cover. Steal the money from the office. The warehouse is crawling with goons. Wipe them out. Use the &lt;a href=\"Submachine%20Gun\"&gt;SMG&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Sniper&lt;/a&gt; to pick off some goons, then carefully go down the stairs eliminating any goons in sight. Cover Phil if he is in danger. Continue on and gain cover. Eliminate a couple more goons and go down the stairs to ground level. Follow Phil into the office.\nGain cover behind the truck on the right and kill the rest of the goons on the ground. An &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;assault rifle&lt;/a&gt; would be helpful in this situation. Jump over the scaffolding in the middle of the warehouse and go up another set of stairs. Cover Phil as you get closer and closer to the &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;cash&lt;/a&gt; room. Once the area seems quiet, run down to the money room. Cutscene. A goon escapes with the money.\nChase after the buyer. Turn left and there will be a pickup truck and a &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;dirtbike&lt;/a&gt;. It is advisable to take the pickup truck, as there is a serious and constant risk of crashing if the dirtbike is taken. Wait for Phil. Then chase after the buyer. Shoot the truck repeatedly. Kill the buyer. Collect the money. Take Phil back to Tudor. Niko receives a $250,000 cut from the deal. Roman is happy that Niko has seized such a fortune, and that he has put Dimitri's betrayals behind him; Kate, however, is not happy that Niko took the money, and refuses to come to &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20%26amp%3B%20Mrs.%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman's wedding&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath.\nPost mission phone calls:\n1.Niko: \"Well, cousin. We're rich.\"\nRoman:\" You did that deal?! You worked with Dimitri?! That's great, Niko!\"\nNiko: \"Yeah, maybe it would have been if he hadn't screwed me over and nearly gotten me killed.\"\nRoman: \"But he didn't get you killed. You got the money and you survived. We will celebrate at the wedding reception. Cheer up, Niko!\"\nNiko: \"Alright, Roman. Today is your and Mallorie's day. I will be happy for you both.\"\n2.Jimmy: \"We're back on top, Niko. The Pegorinos is still somebody. Phil's bringing me the taste of the cash and Dimitri's still got hold of the horse. This is perfect!\"\nNiko: \"I hope your partnership is a fruitful one. Good luck and goodbye.\"\nJimmy: \"You 'been a useful set of hands. Look after yourself.\"\n3.Niko: \"Hey, Kate. I decided to work with that guy. I don't know if it was the right decision, but I did it. He screwed me over again.\"\nKate: \"You see, Niko? You should have gone with your instinct not to trust him. I can't believe you could care about money that much.\"\nNiko: \"Well, we do what we can to survive, Kate. Are you coming to Roman's wedding?\"\nKate: \"I don't think so, Niko.

In particular, the air intakes arching over the front and rear fenders, finished in carbon fiber, stand out and contribute to the Ignus' distinctive look. Its underside is mostly carbon-plated, with the gearbox/differential exposed. \nThe rear of the Ignus features a functional active spoiler that rises when accelerating. The spoiler loses its functionality when any Spoiler modification is added to the vehicle. Some Spoiler modifications, particularly the Speed, Racer, and GT variations, include functional third brake lights, which turn on when the brakes are activated.\nIts interior is the same from cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Nero\"&gt;Nero&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"XA-21\"&gt;XA-21&lt;/a&gt;, with the Pegassi logo visible on the horn cap and the badging behind the seats.

Although not accessible, a trim colour is also available for the dashboard, horn cap and part of the doors, which is always set to black on purchased examples. It uses a set of 10-spoke dual rims, alternating between larger spokes with a painted finish and smaller ones with a black finish. The outer lines and large spokes can support a dedicated colour, although only naturally-generated examples may have one.\nPerformance.\nThe Ignus is powered by a V12 engine whose model is derived from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Infernus%20Classic\"&gt;Infernus Classic&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Torero\"&gt;Torero&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Toros\"&gt;Toros&lt;/a&gt;.

The headlights are reminiscent of those seen on the , while the rear vents appear to have been influenced by the . Furthermore, the exhausts and diffuser are borrowed from the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe front end of the car features a plastic bottom splitter spanning the entire width, while the area above has various meshed intakes on the upper and lower halves, triangular ducts on the edges and a smaller intake above the upper half. On the upper area, the car bears the manufacturer emblem on the centre and black headlamp housings on the edges, each one having LED-like high-beam strips on the inner sides and four main units on the outer sides. The bonnet has an elevated profile and opens to reveal the battery cell, which bears numerous badges displaying its name and the manufacturer emblem on the centre.\nThe sides of the car are defined by the rounded fenders and the thin exit vents located between the front arches and the doors, while the lower sides have straighter lines at the bottom of the doors, creating a concave profile above the plastic skirts. The glasshouse area has black trim around the windows and on the inner separations, with the doors having plastic rear-view mirror shells near the A-pillars. The area behind the cabin has a sloped profile and has a large rear window, while the rear section features a spoiler by default.\nThe rear end of the car is predominated by a black plastic panel, where the upper area has a single curved red lamp spanning the entire width, the central manufacurer emblem below the lamp, the turn/reverse lamps on the edges and the badges beside the reverse lamps. The lower portion of the panel bears a dedicated central section with the license plate and exit vents on the outer portions, each one having three horizontal separations. Further down to the bottom, there is the exhaust tubes and a plastic diffuser with four blades.\nThe interior of the car is the same one from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Nero\"&gt;Nero&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nero%20Custom\"&gt;Nero Custom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"XA-21\"&gt;XA-21&lt;/a&gt;, but uses the dial set from the &lt;a href=\"Raiden\"&gt;Raiden&lt;/a&gt; (a combination also seen on the &lt;a href=\"Neon\"&gt;Neon&lt;/a&gt;). The crown emblem of the manufacturer can be seen on the horn cap and on the headrests.\nThe car's bodywork is prominently painted in a primary colour, while the roof, the A-pillars and the interior stitching are painted in a secondary colour. A trim colour is also available for the interior, being applied on the dashboard, horn cap, doors and seats. It shares the same rim design as the &lt;a href=\"Lynx\"&gt;Lynx&lt;/a&gt; and can support a dedicated wheel colour, although only naturally-generated examples from &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; may have one.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Imorgon possesses both excellent acceleration \u2014 as seen in other vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Raiden\"&gt;Raiden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Voltic\"&gt;Voltic&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and impressive handling, with its high downforce allowing for very high-speed cornering with little to no traction loss. Together with its acceptable braking, these attributes make it formidable in niche situations with very few straights and frequent cornering.\nThe car suffers on any straight lines. Even for an electric vehicle, its top speed is underwhelming, struggling to get past 107 mph on flat road. This is slower than a vast majority of the Sports class, and puts it in range of cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Penumbra\"&gt;Penumbra&lt;/a&gt; in this respect. Additionally, while certainly impressive, it is marginally outpaced by the &lt;a href=\"Neon\"&gt;Neon&lt;/a&gt; in terms of acceleration.\nThe Imorgon is powered by a large battery with the same model as the one from the &lt;a href=\"Cyclone\"&gt;Cyclone&lt;/a&gt;, as well as an internal combustion engine that starts upon reaching a moderate speed. The Imorgon is unique in that it has been programmed to drive similarly to a hybrid, having a 2-speed gearbox as opposed to the single-speed transmission seen in all other electric cars, together with an all-wheel-drive layout with equal torque distribution. At lower speeds, the vehicle emits a unique rumble upon start, but is smoother on higher revs (easier to heard by accelerating while holding the handbrake button). At higher speeds, the internal combustion engine starts and remains active as long as the player keeps revving it up, which produces a high-revving and smooth sound that is a higher-pitched variation of the one used in the &lt;a href=\"T20\"&gt;T20&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tempesta\"&gt;Tempesta&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, the battery shakes in the same manner as most internal combustion engines, as if the combustion engine is below it."}

The grille, covered headlight mechanism, and hood are likely inspired by the , while the headlights are possibly taken from the . The greenhouse area is identical to the '67 Impala; however, the C-pillar windows end at a much sharper angle, which somewhat resembles the . The rear end and tail light arrangement are heavily based on the .\nThe Impaler assumes a body shape similar to cars like the &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Chino\"&gt;Chino&lt;/a&gt;, featuring a large front bumper with rivet details on the upper side, small intakes on the outer sections, and the license plate in the center. There is an inset grille plate on the upper side that bears the Declasse logo in the center and the manufacturer name on the driver side, while the outer sections act as light covers in a similar manner to the &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20%28car%29\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;, which move to reveal a set of dual circular headlights. The outer portions of the car have a set of three inner lights and three outer indicators on the edges, along with a painted detail separating the lights and the front face of the car from the rest of the body. The hood has a small protruding detail in the center and passes through the whole compartment towards the windshield, passing between two small intakes located below the wipers.\nThe sides have a simplistic shape, with a linear formation that separates the skirting area from the rest of the car and traditional doors with square-shaped mirrors. The cabin area is relatively large and features inner pillars on the door windows, together with two separations for the rear-quarter windows. The Declasse logo and the \"IMPALER\" badges can be seen on the rear quarters of the vehicle.\nThe rear of the car features a black panel surrounded by a painted detail around it, bearing the Declasse logo in the center and the manufacturer name on the passenger side. The edges have a set of three red inner brake lights and three red outer indicators separated in a similar way to the front outer lights. The bumper is flat in appearance and also has rivet details on the upper side, which houses a license plate in the center and two square reverse lights beside it.\nThe primary color of the car is applied to the body, while the secondary color is applied to the bumpers, the details surrounding the front and rear ends, the grille separations, the door handles, the mirrors, and the window trims. A trim color is also available for the interior, being applied on the dashboard, the doors, the seats, and the roof. The rims appear to be a derivative of the \"Old School\" muscle rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, but the central detail is smaller and more traditional in appearance.\nIn stock form, the Impaler has access to a fair amount of customization options, and can be modified to resemble a lowrider. However, it can be modified into one of the &lt;a href=\"Apocalypse%20Impaler\"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Future%20Shock%20Impaler\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Impaler\"&gt;variants&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\".\nThe Impaler is a fairly good performing car for its class; having a decent top speed, good handling and moderate durability.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Impaler possesses good speed and average handling, but has bouts of spinning out if turning a corner too sharply. Durability is fairly good and can take a handful of collisions and gunfire before it starts to fail. In addition, its suspension is relatively bouncy around bumps and curbs.\nThe Impaler is powered by a single-cam V8 engine, coupled to a 4-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. It shares the same engine sound as the &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt;."}

It features the left-wing superhero protagonist of the same name in his adventures.\nDescription.\nImpotent Rage is a parody of extreme liberals (much like how &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Space%20Rangers\"&gt;Republican Space Rangers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kung%20Fu%20Rainbow%20Lazerforce\"&gt;Kung Fu Rainbow Lazerforce&lt;/a&gt; are parodies of extreme conservatives). He is very environmental and gets \"incredibly\" angry when things don't go his way, causing his body to bulk up immensely whenever angered. Impotent Rage appears to be hypocritical as well, claiming to support poor workers whilst running a huge corporation at the same time. He also enjoys many luxuries.\nThe character appears to be as popular as &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Space%20Rangers\"&gt;Republican Space Rangers&lt;/a&gt; and there appears to be a relation between both franchises as they have even had a crossover together. The protagonists can also get Impotent Rage tattoos at local &lt;a href=\"Tattoo\"&gt;tattoo parlors&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe is voiced by &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Simms\"&gt;Frank Simms&lt;/a&gt;.\nEpisodes.\nSuper Proletariat Party People (\"GTA V\").\nThe episode begins with a factory owner arguing with a picket in front of a Kunt Industries factory, with workers demanding 200% raises, summer Fridays off, massages, snacks and pensions for life after retiring at 37.\nWhile going to work, Impotent Rage notices the incident and arrives to the scene. He supports the workers, much to the owner's anger. After a brief debate, Impotent Rage goes into a fit, killing the owner and destroying the factory. The puzzled workers are left alone after Impotent Rage proclaims \"a victory for the working man\" and advises the crowd to go on welfare.\nA part of a morning show called \"Up In The Morning\" is shown, which tells about the celebration of a highway closing at Braxton Industries and a suspicion of that Braxton Hunter, the company's CEO, is actually Impotent Rage. The show's host then reads negative responses about Hunter, which claim that \"Braxton is a rich entitled asshole with too much time on his hands\". After hearing this, Braxton is insulted, but his outrage is interrupted by Violet, his buxom secretary. She hands him an &lt;a href=\"IFruit\"&gt;iFruit phone&lt;/a&gt; with a voicemail message from Uberman, Impotent Rage's arch nemesis. After that, Violet tells Braxton about her love interest in him, but Braxton didn't hear her as he was busy picking his nose. When he starts paying attention again, a flashback scene about Hunter's past is seen.\nIt is also interrupted when Braxton's Eco-Sense goes off. A homeless man with a detergent container in his hands was tossing it in an overflowing trash can in front of the Braxton Industries skyscraper, which angers Braxton for not recycling said can. The homeless man is shaken off as Hunter throws a stapler at him from his rooftop office. Braxton again goes into a fit of rage, and is prompted to go to the Anger Room, and then classical music starts to play. When he walks out of it, Violet warns him about another environment threat in progress.\nAfter a short discussion about outfits and a small commercial of the cartoon's merchandise, the show cuts to a scene of another picket, this time in front of a natural gas well. The three Texan owners of the well convince Impotent Rage that they are oppressed homosexuals, and the superhero propels the group of protesters into the sky.\nImmediately after this Uberman arrives and explains Impotent Rage what did he actually do, before leaving to drill oil wells in sensitive wetlands. Impotent Rage chases after Uberman in his solar-powered Impotent Mobile Electric Car, but it explodes after a small cloud blocks the Sun. The episode ends with Impotent Rage standing among the rubble, wistfully proclaiming \"Why must the conservatives always win?\". It ends with him clenching his fists as if he were to fly and beat his villains, only for him to actually break down and start crying tearfully.\nCredits.\nCrew.\nA Balloon Knot Production"}

{"id": "65193", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=65193", "title": "Impound Garage", "text": "Impound Garages (also known as Vehicle Impounds or\u00a0Impound Lots) are underground parking garages located near police stations in \"\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\",\u00a0and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" which store vehicles seized by the police.\nDescription.\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", there are three impound garages, one for each city, located next to or within a police station area. In the impound area, that includes external parking lot and an underground garage, there are police officers with assigned posts (guarding the entrance or garage gate, entering a police car and driving away, repairing a police car, beating up a civilian etc.), who don't carry nightsticks and are not counted as normal police officers for purposes of counting wanted level (the player may only attain/raise wanted level by one star if they shoot one or beat up/stealth kill several of them in quick succession). There are also a couple police cars, out of which some are locked, one usually has a raised hood and an officer crawling into the engine. In the very back end of the garage there is a place for impounded vehicles. Each garage has a scenario of police cars placement and the officers' assigned mission, that starts once the player enters the underground garage. However, entering the area may result in the player gaining an instant three-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; (for details, see below).\nImpound Garages return in \"GTA V\", functioning similarly to those in \"GTA San Andreas\". Players can now recover abandoned vehicles from the garage. The garage has room for two vehicles, and if the player abandons another vehicle, the oldest vehicle in the garage will be replaced by the most recent vehicle the player abandoned. Impounded vehicles with low suspension will automatically receive scratch damage to the bottom upon exiting the garage due to the steep and sharp angled nature of the incline.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", the Impound Garage allows the player to retrieve a vehicle which was lost during a mission or cutscene. Impound Garages are underground parking garages located at the bottom floors of police stations. The first few floors of the garages contain police cars which spawn in the parking spaces. Vehicles which the player abandoned are stored at the rear of the ground floor of the garage. However, not every abandoned vehicle will be stored here, and on occasion, the vehicle which appears will be a random vehicle which the player never drove.\nSome missions have \"Clear Area\" commands, which remove any parked vehicle within a certain radius from the mission's marker. These vehicles are then placed inside an impound garage, and the player can then enter one of these garages to retrieve their vehicle.\nEntering an Impound Garage without a law enforcement vehicle will result in officers guarding the area pointing a pistol at the player. After a couple seconds, the officer will call for backup and the player will receive a three-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of whether the player kills the officer or leaves the garage after the call has started. However, the player can use stealth or drive a law enforcement vehicle (except the &lt;a href=\"HPV-1000\"&gt;HPV-1000&lt;/a&gt;) to avoid drawing attention of the officers while invading the impound garage.\nDue to a glitch, vehicles may sometimes spawn stuck inside each other, or they may spawn stuck halfway inside the ground. Also, strange occurrences may happen in Impound Garages if the player is playing certain side missions like Vigilante or Export missions; Vehicles will spawn stacked on top of each other or laying on their sides. Aircraft, like &lt;a href=\"Dodo\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt;s or even &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;s, may spawn unlocked (Though aircrafts are barely found in the impound lot in the PC and mobile versions). Impound Garages exhibit strange behaviors like these very commonly. These glitches hint that the Impound Garage was simply a game mechanic that was never perfected or implemented correctly in the game.\nSince the Impound Garage is never mentioned in any instructional guides for the game, it is possible that impound garages were going to be fully functional but were not completed during the game's development. Impound garages were supposed to be introduced to the player in a &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas%23Missions\"&gt;cut&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Impounded\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt;, but it was dropped during development.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nImpound Garages return in \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\". In \"GTA V\", If the player abandons (but doesn't destroy) a vehicle that they have modified at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; or ordered online, they will be able to retrieve the vehicle from the Impound Lot for a fee of $250. Reasons for losing a vehicle in \"GTA V\" might include triggering a mission that requires the use of another vehicle, the vehicle being commandeered by police (which can happen if it's parked outside a police station), wandering too far away from a vehicle and causing it to despawn, or loading an autosave that places the character back at a safehouse instead of in the vehicle. Parking a vehicle in a marked no-parking zone or in a location such as the middle of an intersection may also result in a vehicle being impounded, though this does not always occur. If the player abandons a personal vehicle belonging to a \"GTA V\" protagonist, the vehicle will not be impounded and will respawn at the protagonist's house.\nIn \"GTA Online\", vehicles may only be impounded when the player is killed by the police while close to their personal vehicle. The vehicle will be impounded at the &lt;a href=\"LSPD%20Auto%20Impound\"&gt;LSPD Auto Impound&lt;/a&gt;. The player can retrieve their vehicle for a fee of $250, or steal it by force, though stealing a vehicle will result in the player gaining a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;two-star&lt;/a&gt; wanted level. If the player is registered as a &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt;, they may call their &lt;a href=\"assistant\"&gt;assistant&lt;/a&gt; instead to retrieve the vehicle for a fee of $1000, which will deliver the vehicle back to the player anywhere on the map, similar to retrieving a vehicle from a garage. \nAs with the \"GTA San Andreas\" version, the Impound Garage is not mentioned in the game's instruction manual (though an on-screen message will appear if a player abandons a vehicle)."}

Impromptu Races consist of racing other players to any chosen point on the map.\nImpromptu Races are much simpler than normal multiplayer races: Players cannot choose their starting vehicles, and are instead forced to use the vehicles they were already inside, even if they are from different racing classes. Players may also race in different types of vehicle (i.e. helicopter vs. car). There are no checkpoints in Impromptu Races, meaning the player can take any path they want to reach the finishing point.\nThe finishing point can be selected out of a number of landmarks (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Airport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Golf%20Club\"&gt;Golf Course&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alamo%20Sea\"&gt;Alamo Sea&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) or to a waypoint placed on the map as long as it is at least 0.64 miles (about 1km) away from the starting point. There's an entry fee paid by each player that forms the reward pool for the winner. The minimum fee to participate is $50 and increases with the distance to the finishing point."}

The rims on the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;'s\" rendition of Infernus match the rims used on the , a limited production car based on the Murci\u00e9lago.\nDesign.\nBetween \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\", the Infernus has appeared in three different forms, each illustrating the car as a sleek, low-profile sports car comparable to the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"GTA III\" &amp; \"\", the Infernus has a long body, rounded lights and an integrated spoiler. Although the design suggests an RMR layout, its engine is visible under the front hood, possibly due to limitations of the game engine. In the &lt;a href=\"Android%20OS\"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Apple%20iOS\"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; versions, the vehicle received an updated design, featuring bonnet intakes, rear louvers and white trim around the lights.\nIn ' and ', the Infernus lacks the characteristic scissor doors seen in its real-life counterpart, and features bulged headlights and rounded tail lights, along with a spoiler. This model repositions the engine to the back, as the front compartment is revealed to be the bonnet (though the \"GTA Vice City\" rendition still emits smoke from the front when damaged).\nIn \"\", the Infernus moves slightly towards the design of its \"GTA III\" ancestor, with an intergrated spoiler and soft, rounded corners. The car can also be identified by its thin, bumper-integrated headlights, squared-off side ducts, and large brakelights that stretch the width of the car.\nAll renditions of the Infernus are available in a variety of monotone colours. In \"GTA San Andreas\", the Infernus can be modified at any &lt;a href=\"TransFender\"&gt;TransFender&lt;/a&gt; modification garage.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the Infernus is shown to be manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Pegassi\"&gt;Pegassi&lt;/a&gt;. The car is characterized by the long body and the rear-mid rear configuration, sharing similarities with the \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" renditions. The front bumper of the car features a carbon-fibre bottom/extender with an elevated area on the centre, along with three grated intakes. The upper area features a set of circular headlamps in carbon-fibre housings, protected by glass casings. The bonnet has a small manufacturer emblem on the front and a thin intake near the windscreen.\nThe sides denote its aerodynamic profile, featuring a set of skirts with an intake duct just in front of the rear wheels, as well as \"PEGASSI\" badges. The greenhouse area makes use of plastic trims around the windows, with a fuel inlet on the driver side. The Infernus is also the first car in the series to feature scissor doors; however, they appear to rotate \"away\" from the vehicle body, unlike the standard scissor-door design and purpose. This design trait allows the Infernus' doors to be self-closing, relying on gravity to fall shut from its opened position. Also featured are small, racing-style wing mirrors, roof scoop and rear louvers.\nThe rear of the car is prominently covered in carbon-fibre, housing the five-exhaust set on the centre and the split circular tail lamps on the outer edges. The sections in between are occupied by grated vents exposing part of the engine bay, with the driver-side one bearing the \"INFERNUS\" badging. What appears to be two fins can be seen at the bottom. The Infernus may spawn with a rear spoiler as an extra.\nThe interior is fully finished in black leather and uses the same sport seats as the &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt;. Sections of the dash and transmission tunnel are finished with carbon-fibre accents.\nThe Infernus is set to spawn in a variety of monotone colours on the body, although it is capable of supporting a secondary colour for a stripe over the side skirts (only seen on special variants). The car uses a set of five-spoke rims with bolt details on the surrounding and wrapped in low-profile tyres, with the rear ones being wider.\nThe Infernus in \"\" shares the same design from the \"GTA IV\" rendition, although it is only available without a spoiler and features conventional doors.\nThe Infernus in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" appears to be unchanged from \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", with the exception of a new, red interior, though only in the last-gen version of the game; the enhanced version shares its predominantly-black interior with the &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Furore%20GT\"&gt;Furore GT&lt;/a&gt;.\nColour distribution remains the same as in \"GTA IV\", but the interior stitching matches with the primary colour of the car. The rims are identical to the \"Shadow\" high-end rims also available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\nThe performance of the Infernus remains similar in all of its appearances by being one of, if not the fastest car in each game. Unlike subsequent depictions that have an all-wheel-drive system, the Infernus in \"GTA III\" has a rear-wheel-drive layout.\nDespite the change in drivetrain layout, its handling remains similar and its all-wheel-drive system means the car has good front grip. However, it suffers from understeer due to its small wheels and wheel wells. Caution must be taken while braking as the wheels usually lock up during high speed braking. Power distribution is considered smooth, but due to its high-power output, moderation must be used when taking turns, otherwise fishtailing may ensue. Its suspension in \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Vice City\", however, is softer, allowing it to drive over curbs without jolting the car substantially or bottoming out. Additionally, the drag multiplier is only 1, which means it is the most aerodynamic sports car in the game \u2013 this probably answers why it is often a bit difficult to handle. One of the downsides of the Infernus is its low durability, as it catches fire only after a few collisions.\nIn \"GTA Vice City Stories\", the AWD drivetrain of the Infernus has a 20% front, 80% rear torque distribution, and what sounds like a supercharged engine. With such speed and power, it is great for cruising along the beach, although its turning radius will suffer. The AWD drivetrain can be easily seen by flipping the car over; switching between the handbrake and regular brakes, while applying gas.\nIn \"GTA Vice City\", the Infernus has the same engine sound as the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;, while in in \"GTA Vice City Stories\", it has the same engine sound as the &lt;a href=\"Stinger\"&gt;Stinger&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Infernus returns retaining its renowned performance of high speed and acceleration. It is highly susceptible to deformation from high-speed impacts, due to its light body construction and rear mounted engine. &lt;a href=\"Involuntary%20Ejection\"&gt;Windshield ejection&lt;/a&gt; is also common due to the lack of substance in the front of the car. The Infernus is one of the best racing cars, but does suffer from understeer during high speed turns. However, the mid-engine configuration makes it unlikely to break down or be set aflame from front-end collisions. It is also good at performing quick J-Turns.\nThe in-game engine model is not very detailed, and cannot fully reveal the engine cylinder configuration. However, it can be said to be a V8, as it shares the same base model as the &lt;a href=\"Turismo\"&gt;Turismo&lt;/a&gt; (which is stated in the &lt;a href=\"Auto%20Eroticar\"&gt;Auto Eroticar&lt;/a&gt; website to use a Quad Cam V8), except it has \"Infernus\" engraved into them. It is laid out in a mid-engined all-wheel drive layout, like most Lamborghinis. The Infernus shares its engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Super%20GT\"&gt;Super GT&lt;/a&gt;. It also tends to backfire, like the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buffalo\"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"F620\"&gt;F620&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20RS\"&gt;Sultan RS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bullet%20GT\"&gt;Bullet GT&lt;/a&gt;.\nReturning in \"GTA V\", the Infernus retains its high-performing engine but exchanges understeer for oversteer and general poor stability. As before, it has excellent acceleration and speed due to the AWD drivetrain and what sounds to be a high-revving, high-power engine, but attempting to corner while letting off of the accelerator and not braking will cause wild spinouts and general loss of control. To counter this, the player must always keep either the accelerator or the brakes on throughout the turn. The mid-engine layout provides some measure of resistance against accidents and bullets but otherwise its durability is disappointing, as its wheels can make a positive camber very easily when having side-on crashes.\nAgain, like \"GTA IV\", the engine is very undetailed and cannot fully reveal the cylinder configuration; however, the website states that is a 6-litre engine capable of pushing 610hp. The original version of the game uses the same engine sound as most supercars like the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;, but in the enhanced version, it uses a higher-revving, louder version.\nLocations.\nThe Infernus is part of the codice_1 \"codice_2\". This allows heavily modified Infernuses, among many other modified cars to spawn outside Los Santos Customs, as well at other locations. They only spawn in \"GTA V\"."}

The front fascia, along with the pop-up headlights, closely resembles that of the , while the tail lights and rear mesh are akin to those found on the . The engine cover might have been inspired by the .\nThe radio unit may allude to the real-world collaboration between Lamborghini and , which provided radio units and audio systems for the Diablo. The in-game radio model appears to be influenced by both the Alpine 7618 and Alpine 7903.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Infernus Classic retains the long body and the rear-mid rear configuration from its &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;modern equivalent&lt;/a&gt;, but most of its features lean towards the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" model, especially the beta version known as the \"Dyablo\". In the front fascia, a black grille can be seen spanning most of the car's width, and within the grille there is a set of light clusters consisting of the a lamp, indicator and auxiliary lamp. Small intakes are found below the grille directing airflow to the front brakes. The upper area consists of two pop-up headlamps containing twin circular units, and a bonnet that hinges from the front and opens forward, having a manufacturer badge on the front and a vented duct near the windscreen.\nOn the side profiling, the overall body shape is most noticeable, giving the car its prolific wedge, lengthened design. The car sports a single strake line which splits air into side intakes, with an upper intake leading to the engine bay and the lower intake to the rear brakes. On the cabin area, plastic trim can be seen around the windows, while conventional wing mirrors are found mounted just behind the A-pillar. The area behind the side windows feature more intakes leading to the upper engine bay constructed from the vehicle's metal body, following on from the B pillar of the window. The B pillar is seemingly endless and meets at the very rear of the car along with the side profile's belt line. The Infernus Classic also features scissor doors, though they do not extend further out of the body. In the rear portion, because of the immense engine size and wedge profile of the vehicle, width at this point is most extensive. The B-pillars separate to merge with the rear side body panels, leaving ample room for the engine hood cover - a series of slotted covers, with larger slots at the up-most point of the hood and four groups of covers at the rearmost point. The vehicle sports a large V12 engine with offset intake manifolds. The Pegassi wordmark is also found on the intake covers, similar to how the Diablo's intake covers feature Lamborghini wordmarks. While the engine is aluminium, strips of colour according to the primary colour of the vehicle are found on the intake covers. The side cold intake piping is seen entering the engine intake manifolds from the rear.\nThe rear end consists of a carbon-fibre panel with plastic fittings on the surrounding, sporting unique rear lamps, of which the inner lamps consist of reverse lights. Below the lamps, twin exist dual exhausts emerge from plastic plating inset into the bodywork. A rear grille is also found underneath the central license plate. \nThe Infernus Classic's interior is unique, where the driver-side dashboard features a boxy design with blue dials derived from the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;, but rearranged in a way that the main dials are found beside the smaller gauge cluster and numerous warning lights below these. Two air con units are found on the dashboard above the central column, while a glove box cover can be seen on the passenger side. The central column features a carbon-fibre panel with two gauges, a radio set, gear stick and numerous buttons across the same panel. The Pegassi wordmark is found on the passenger side glove box cover, horn cap, floor mats, and a case next to the gear stick.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the body and the details on the engine cam covers, while the secondary one is applied on the mirror wings, rear vents behind the windows and interior stitching. A trim colour is also available for the dashboard, doors and seats, as well as a detail surrounding the horn cap. It uses a unique set of rims consisting of six rounded spokes with circular spacing between these, with bolt details on the surrounding and around the centre, together with low-profile tyres.\nIf purchased through &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Motorsport\"&gt;Legendary Motorsport&lt;/a&gt;, the Infernus Classic will be fitted with a stock wing that resembles the Lamborghini Diablo SV's stock spoiler; however, if spawned through other means, the wing will not be installed. The spoiler can be seen on the Legendary Motorsport gallery.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe car's boxy yet aerodynamic design pays off in terms of performance. While having a statistically lower top speed than its rival, the &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20Classic\"&gt;Turismo Classic&lt;/a&gt;, and a much heavier weight, the car is still agile and has acceptable acceleration. The lengthy design causes oversteer at times, but is still able to manoeuvre relatively well.\nThe Infernus Classic is powered by a large V12 apparent when the engine's rear compartment is opened, coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a rear-engine, rear wheel drive configuration. It shares its engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt;."}

The headlights are reminiscent of the , while the tail lights and boot lid appear to be based on the .\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the Ingot can spawn with additional tuning parts dubbed \"&lt;a href=\"%23Variants\"&gt;VD90R&lt;/a&gt;\". They appear to be based on the version, while the name itself may be derived from the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Ingot can spawn with or without roof rack bars, as well as the &lt;a href=\"%23Variants\"&gt;VD90R&lt;/a&gt; tuning parts. The majority of the car's body is painted with the primary color, while the lower sides and front/rear bumpers are painted with the secondary color. Despite this, only one of the Ingot's spawning colors has different colors for each of these areas.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the Ingot is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; system with a male voice, but only if the player leaves the \"selected cars\" (default) option in the audio menu.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe \"\" rendition of the Ingot retains the same styling from the \"GTA IV\" rendition, albeit much simpler in details. In other platforms, the Ingot has more detailing than the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20DS\"&gt;Nintendo DS&lt;/a&gt; version of the game, although it lacks the roof bars.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Ingot returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" mostly unchanged from its appearance in \"GTA IV\". The vehicle now lacks its extra \"tuning\" options and only appears in its stock condition. Like \"GTA IV\", it may spawn with or without the roof bars. With the exception of improved light and rear windscreen textures, the model itself remains unchanged.\nIn the enhanced version of the game, the car gains a higher quality &lt;a href=\"Feroci\"&gt;Feroci&lt;/a&gt;-based interior. It may spawn with or without a phone-holder and phone as well as a small air-con fan, and an freshener.\nThe car's dual paint colors are carried over unchanged from \"GTA IV\". With new spawning colors, almost all of the Ingot's spawning colors have \"black\" as the secondary color.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"GTA IV\", the Ingot is an all-round well performing car, but it is not at all performance-oriented, befitting of its family car nature. The vehicle has nimble steering and relatively supportive suspension, allowing good cornering (albeit not at high speeds) and good acceleration (for its mass and style). Its light weight also makes it easier to gain traction, and gives the car more potential in acceleration, cornering and braking. The vehicle has acceptable durability considering its body style. The vehicle takes a reasonable amount of damage before the engine begins to smoke, and performance is only slightly affected by deformation and locked wheels. It should be used as a last resort for getaways if no other vehicles are available, as most trucks and vans are more durable, and almost all other vehicles will be faster.\nThe vehicle features a double overhead camshaft inline-four engine model, which is laid transversely, powering the rear wheels and coupled to a four-speed gearbox.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Ingot has a low-powered straight 4 engine, laid transversely, coupled to a five-speed gearbox in an FF drivetrain layout. The Ingot is not very fast; its high-gear ratios mean that, after finding fifth gear, the car bogs down and hesitates to shift back into fourth, making highway driving painfully slow at times. Driving up a slope or hill of any kind is agonizingly slow, as it lacks sufficient power, traction or torque to maintain the same pace as other vehicles.\nThe Ingot does, however, have decent handling. Its suspension is not too hard or too soft, making it perfect for city driving. 'Scandinavian-flicks' may be preformed in a wet downhill scenario, due to the Ingot's fair weight distribution and absence of power necessary to recover. It shares similar qualities with its real-life counterpart; it is very rigid, and has average crash deformation.\nThe Ingot lacks a connecting diff to its gearbox and engine bottom as seen from the rear, as the engine block is laid longitudinally which does not correspond to the engine model seen from the top, which is laid transversely. This is likely a developer oversight.\nVariants.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nA special \"VD90R\" variant of the car can occasionally be found in \"GTA IV\"; it is an Ingot with removed badging and new grill, a discrete spoiler and body kit, and candy red paint. This variant is driven by the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\n&lt;a href=\"Vehicles%20in%20GTA%20V/Scenarios\"&gt;Scenarios&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ingot is part of the codice_1, \"codice_2\". This set of cars is exclusive to the Ingot , &lt;a href=\"Stratum\"&gt;Stratum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Regina\"&gt;Regina&lt;/a&gt;. It isn't very common, but does appear in specific locations which guarantees a 1/3 chance of the Ingot spawning."}

In the enhanced version, it uses a worn variation of the interior seen in muscle cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Manana\"&gt;Manana&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied to the body, while the secondary colour is applied to the fenders and in the form of twin stripes over the inset sections of the front. It uses a set of five-spoke rims fitted with standard treaded tyres on the front and wider dust tyres on the rear (a setup also shared with the &lt;a href=\"Dune%20Buggy\"&gt;Dune Buggy&lt;/a&gt;).\nPerformance.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", the BF Injection still performs generally well. It has decent acceleration and an average top speed, and is generally stable while turning. Being a purpose-built off-road vehicle, it does perform very well off the asphalt, with its acceleration and speed much more noteworthy. The addition of a covered roof helps in recovery from rollovers. While the rear-mounted engine does generally keep it safe, the rest of the vehicle is very susceptible to deformation damage, and can only take one or two hard crashes before any wheels become stuck. Bulletproof tires are highly recommended for it to withstand gunshots.\nThe Injection features a rear-mounted, air-cooled single cam Flat-4 engine with two carburetors, powering the rear wheels in an RR drivetrain layout. The engine emits a low-revving and loud sound, possibly attributed to its worn condition, which is also shared with the &lt;a href=\"Dune%20Buggy\"&gt;Dune Buggy&lt;/a&gt;."}

The Imperial Highway runs east to oil-producing Brea. \u00a0Both cross the Los Angeles and Los Santos Rivers just below where their respective eastern tributaries join the main channels.

{"id": "20078", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=20078", "title": "Innovation", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Cycles\"&gt;Liberty City Cycles&lt;/a&gt; Innovation is a chopper featured in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\" and later reintroduced in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Team%20Standing%20Update\"&gt;Last Team Standing Update&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nThe Innovation is a radically designed custom chopper with fine detailing and unconventional design elements, most notably featuring a rear wheel with a sprocket connected to the that is directly mounted onto the rim and encompasses the diameter of the rim. The handlebars and headlight are inspired from the , while the body shell (primarily the rear wheel) appears to be based on a Billy Lane Choppers Inc. model.\nThe vehicle features an elaborate tribal paintjob which incorporates &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;Lost's&lt;/a&gt; insignia on the fuel tank, and further encompasses the wheel covers or mudguards, and even the outer extent of the rear rim. There is no &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Cycles\"&gt;LCC&lt;/a&gt; logo on the bike, but on the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; radio, it can be heard that the bike is manufactured by them.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nReturning to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", the Innovation uses the almost exact same design as in \"TLAD\", albeit with a newer color scheme thanks to the improved color-spawning system. Unlike in \"TLAD\", the Innovation does not have any customized paintjob and is no longer a gang bike. Furthermore, its wheels and bodywork cannot be modified, and its modification options are severely limited, compared to other bikes.\nPerformance.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nThe Innovation is powered by a odd-firing engine, with a large V-Twin engine model, and handles smoothly. Its turning radius is smaller than that of the &lt;a href=\"Hexer\"&gt;Hexer&lt;/a&gt;, and the Innovation's brakes are very strong, but they are definitely not the best in the game. Acceleration is average but top speed is impressive, and this is most likely due to its compact size and lighter weight. Due to this, it is one of the easiest choppers to ride in \"TLAD\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nDue to \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\"s enhanced physics, the Innovation now has much stiffer handling, wherein cornering is much more slide-free. Braking is much more responsive than its \"TLAD\" counterpart, and acceleration seems improved. The loss of weight also allows the bike to achieve higher top speeds."}

It also can be found as a minor sponsor on some vehicle liveries, such as the &lt;a href=\"190z\"&gt;190z&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nInside Track is officially featured in \"GTA Online\" as part of update. It is located inside &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20%26amp%3B%20Resort\"&gt;The Diamond Casino &amp; Resort&lt;/a&gt;.\nInterior.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe interior of each Inside Track features four manned counters, ceiling-mounted television screens that broadcast horse races, and two inside track betting (ITB) machines, the only interactive items in the establishment, that line the walls. The interior also features a backroom which can be entered.\nUnlike virtually every other interior space in the game, it is possible to enter Inside Track shops with recruited gang members and other &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s. This is mostly likely a programming oversight from the fact &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt; enters the shop with &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; in the mission &lt;a href=\"Against%20All%20Odds\"&gt;Against All Odds&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe interior of the Inside Track room consists of a large room with a large LCD screen displaying the horse races. Numerous IBT machines can be seen, enough for at least 16 participants (though NPCs may be seen participating in the game).\nBetting System.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe ITB machines allow players to bet on any one of five racehorses for any amount of &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; divisible to five, from a minimum of $5 or a maximum of $9,999,995. After selecting a racehorse, players define the amount that they would like wager using a calculator which allows the player to add specific amounts of money into the wager, including $5, $25, $100, $250, $1,000, $5,000, or $10,000; the $0 is used to clear the amount bet.\nOnce the player places their bet (thereby deducting the bet amount of money from the player), the player is directed to a broadcast of the horse race that last between 25 and 30 seconds depending on when the last horse crosses the finish line. The player can then spot a sign saying \"SARC24\", the channel which is broadcasting the horse races, and probably the first TV channel the player can watch in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series.\nIf the player bets $100 on a horse with 2/1 odd and the horse wins by finishing first, the player receives their $100 bet back in addition to $200 from the 2/1 odds. Otherwise, the player gets nothing.\nBased on 1,000 simulations, the blue colored horse wins 22.9% of the races, the red colored horse wins 22.3% of the races, the yellow colored horse wins 18.0% of the races, the purple colored horse wins 17.4% of the races, and the teal colored horse wins 19.4% of the races. Due to this, paired with the betting odds on each horse, the player should always bet on the teal horse. Also, at the end of the race, if two or more horses tie for a position, the win automatically goes to the horse with the better odds to win (Blue then Red then Yellow and so on).\nBetting trick.\nBy smart utilization of Inside Track, it is possible to amass great sums of money very early on in the game. This trick can be used to achieve $999999999 ($1 short of 1 billion, max amount of money) without using cheats, hacks, trainers, or even using a downloaded savefile. \nA simple way to ensure the player never loses money is to save before betting, so they can just reload the save game if anything goes wrong. With gambling all their money in one go, the player can earn a large amount of money if succeeding.\nThe player should bet on the same horse every time. Statistically, this horse will eventually win, and should not take more than around five attempts. After winning, save the game again and repeat the process if required.\nNote that around 45% of the races will be won by Blue or Red horses. The results can become extremely frustrating, especially if the player's horse jetted off the starting line and then slowed down. Do not let this change your mind though, because the chances are the color of horse the player bet on will win if they continue betting.\nAlways bet on the Teal horse that has the worst odds (the 11/1 or 12/1 horse). This way, the player can win the most amount of cash if succeeded. (Note: the Teal horse usually wins around 19% of the time, yet the player wins 11 or 12 times the money bet if the Teal horse wins). \nFor example, the maximum amount the player can bet is $9999995, $5 short of 10 million. If they win on the 11/1 or the 12/1 horse, the amount earned is at least 100 million. ($109999945 for 11/1 and $119999940 for 12/1, to be exact)\nTo save time travelling back to the betting shop after reloading, the player should save at a location close to the betting shop. The closest &lt;a href=\"Save%20Points%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;safehouse&lt;/a&gt; and Inside Track Betting Shop together are the &lt;a href=\"Jefferson%20Safehouse\"&gt;Jefferson Safehouse&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Jefferson%2C%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Jefferson&lt;/a&gt; and the betting shop in Downtown Los Santos.\n&lt;a href=\"Catalina%27s%20Hideout\"&gt;Catalina's Hideout&lt;/a&gt; works just as fine. Since a &lt;a href=\"Buffalo\"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt; spawns right beside the spawn point, anyone should be able to to make a left turn, drive straight into town, and stop right in front of the betting shop within 20 seconds. \n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nInside Track in \"GTA Online\" works similarly to its counterpart in \"GTA San Andreas\". Players can bet on any of the six horses in the race, with a minimum of $100 and a maximum of $10,000.\nThe horses are numbered. Horses #1 and #2 are the most likely to win, the next two have a smaller chance, and horses #5 and #6 are least likely to win.\nEach horse has its chance of winning given in the form of decimals. Each horse in line has a smaller chance to win than the previous; the two horses from the same \"tier\" can have the same chance. The high-tier horses can have chances from \"evens\" to \"5/1\", the mid-tier horses from \"6/1\" to 15/1\", and the low-tier horses from \"16/1\" to \"30/1\".\nPlayers can theoretically win as much as $300,000 from a single race - if they bet $10,000 on horse #6, but this horse is unlikely to win.\nPlayers can opt for any of the two events:\nMission Appearances.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Against%20All%20Odds\"&gt;Against All Odds&lt;/a&gt;\" in \"GTA San Andreas\", Catalina, together with &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; Carl Johnson, robs the Montgomery branch of the betting shop for money by blowing open the outlet's safe in its back room, drawing the attention of the &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20Sheriff\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; before escaping to Catalina's hideout in &lt;a href=\"Fern%20Ridge\"&gt;Fern Ridge&lt;/a&gt;.\nList of Horse Names and Chances.\nAlmost all of the horse's names are humorous and crude terms, referencing genitalia and sex."}

The front and sides are very likely to have been influenced by the Alpine Armoring Pitbull VX, while the general shape of the greenhouse area seems to take influence from the . The vehicle also draws loose inspiration from the , given the raised suspension, semi-squared door windows and a similar tail lights setup.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Insurgent is a large and bulky vehicle evidently purposed as a military vehicle, whose front end features a reinforced bumper and dual grilles with multiple vent holes facing downwards, intended to protect the radiator while providing the necessary air flow. Its hood is completely sealed for total protection to the engine, featuring a large vent and metal plates around it.\nThe sides are distinguished by the bulky fenders and the armored details on the doors, with an extra set of windows for the rear compartment and the side steps and roof rails. The single windshield also features a bolted-on detail. A hatch can be seen on the roof, though it is unusable.\nThe rear end is basically composed of the dual set of square tail lights, a reinforced bumper and a large unopenable door. The rear compartment is detailed with a floor plate and two benches. The underside feature sump guards just near the axles, along with large, armored wheels with rugged, high-profile tires.\nThe vehicle's primary color is applied onto the bodywork and the sump guards, while the secondary color is applied onto the parts holding the winch, front towing hooks, hood vent and bars, side roof rails, roof hatch hinges, fenders, rear towing hooks and the bolt details on the rear bumper. The stock wheels are also painted with a separated color, though this is only seen when purchased and will revert back to the default alloy color when changed.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nIn terms of overall performance, the acceleration is somewhat lacking due to its heavy weight, but it has an acceptable top speed. The Insurgent's immense weight helps to keep it grounded when cornering, and contributes to it having good handling for a vehicle of its stature. It has a decent cornering radius and understeer is relatively minor. The Insurgent is abnormally sensitive in the air, and may be prone to crash landings if the user is not careful. However, it is able to quickly recover from rolling over. Though the engine model or bay cannot be seen, the sound is similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Landstalker\"&gt;Landstalker&lt;/a&gt;'s, but slightly smoother, coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a front engine, all-wheel drive layout.\nThe Insurgent's sheer weight means that it is a formidable vehicle towards other players. The Insurgent can cripple or even disable many other road vehicles if given a direct hit at full speed, and will usually run over lighter cars, deforming them and often breaking wheels or axles. It also seems to have a degree of top-heaviness that is evident while airborne, however it makes up for it by being able to recover abnormally fast from a rollover, relative to its class. It can also ram parked vehicles and continue to drive without any noticeable damage, and it will only show body deformation after a large number of collisions.\nArmor.\nThe Insurgent is distinctive by its armored body, which is able to withstand more damage than the average car, even able to withstand direct impacts from explosive weapons, comparable to a &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino Tank&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Insurgent has large windshields and windows, making their occupants vulnerable to gunfire from the front, and despite the fact that there is a barrier between the rear seats and the covered compartment, players can still be shot through it.\nWith a driver inside (otherwise the explosion resistance will be cut in half), the Insurgent can take the following:"}

The rear section no longer features the enclosed compartment and the rear door, allowing two passengers to sit in one of the truck bed's benches.\nColor distribution is the same as the normal Insurgent, with the roll bars being painted with the secondary color.

However, the Insurgent has large windshields and windows, making their occupants vulnerable to gunfire from the front. If the vehicle rolls over while carrying the external passengers and the gunner, they will fall off the vehicle and may either suffer a considerable damage or dying from being crushed by the same vehicle.\nThe vehicle comes with bullet-proof tyres by default, making them immune to bullet, fire and spike-strip damage.\nThe Insurgent Pick-Up can take the following:\nWeaponry.\nMachine Gun: What makes the Insurgent Pick-Up a great vehicle is the mounted gun. Although it has a lower damage output than the mounted gun of the &lt;a href=\"Technical\"&gt;Technical&lt;/a&gt; (150 versus 200), it is still lethal to any unarmored target and can be killed easily, and it also exceeds in fire rate to compensate this flaw (about 410 rounds per minute, while the Technical's gun has a fire rate of 333 rounds per minute). The turret also offers a 360-degree coverage and an elevation range of between -20 and 30 degrees, making it an ideal choice against low-flying aircraft and targets close to the vehicle, and a maximum effective range of 500 meters. Both the gun and the turret hatch may offer some degree of protection against ground-level enemies, but they are still vulnerable to getting shot from the sides or elevated areas. Gunners will also fall if the vehicle flips to one side.\nThe rear passengers on the Insurgent Pick-Up can toggle between ducking into the vehicle or getting on the gunner seat by pressing right on the D-Pad. This tactic can be extremely useful in case the gunner is very weak and needs to regenerate their health back by ducking into the car, or to prevent falling off from the vehicle, as explained before. Once they regain their health or the vehicle is upright again, they can press right on the D-Pad to get back up on the gunner seat. Another tactic can be done if there are multiple players on the rear seats, they can take turns being gunners. The ability to use the turret can be done either from the passenger seats or while standing on the roof in case that both rear seats are occupied and another player wants to use the turret.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nInsurgent=\nMachine Gun=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle itself cannot be modified at any mod shop, as it is a &lt;a href=\"Pegasus%20Lifestyle%20Management\"&gt;Pegasus&lt;/a&gt; vehicle. However, one can bring it to a &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt; inside a &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt; to convert it into a custom variant and a &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicles\"&gt;personal vehicle&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, as of the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up%20Custom%20Week\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up Custom Week&lt;/a&gt; event, commencing August 1st, 2017, it became available for all players.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Insurgent Pick-Up Custom is a modifiable variant of the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up&lt;/a&gt;, where it retains the exact same design and properties as the regular Insurgent Pick-Up, except that a tow-hitch is added, able to tow another player's &lt;a href=\"Anti-Aircraft%20Trailer\"&gt;Anti-Aircraft Trailer&lt;/a&gt;. The vehicle can be modified with an array of visual modifications, being armor plates, liveries and respray colors.\nColor distribution is the same as its &lt;a href=\"Pegasus%20Lifestyle%20Management\"&gt;Pegasus&lt;/a&gt; equivalent, and retains the same wheel design and color as the aforementioned vehicle and the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent\"&gt;Insurgent&lt;/a&gt;.\nSimilar to the Pegasus version, the vehicle is equipped with the same machine gun turret that resembles a , but can be replaced with a three-barreled .50 caliber &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt; resembling a gatling gun.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nPerformance-wise, the vehicle is the same as its normal counterpart, as well as the unarmed &lt;a href=\"Insurgent\"&gt;Insurgent&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with a slightly higher revving, and a rather unique turbo engine sound will be present if the vehicle is fitted with one. According to the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games%20Social%20Club\"&gt;Social Club&lt;/a&gt; stats, the vehicle only differs in that it has slightly better acceleration. Still, the performance upgrades can give the vehicle a slight advantage over the regular version, similar to the unarmed Insurgent.\nArmor.\nThe vehicle has slightly more armor than its equivalents; when the Armor option has been maximized to 100%, the vehicle is capable of surviving up to 26 homing missiles, 8 &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bombs\"&gt;sticky bombs&lt;/a&gt; or 8 &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt;s (provided that it is occupied by a driver, otherwise the explosion resistance will be cut in half), or extensive gunfire. However, it has large non-bulletproof windows, making their occupants vulnerable to gunfire.\nThe Insurgent Pick-Up Custom can be equipped with additional Armor Plating that will primarily affect the windows and the gunner position. Adding any Armor Plating will take away the ability for occupants to use throwable weapons, and none of the upgrades render the glass bulletproof.\nWeaponry.\nSimilar to the regular version, the vehicle has access to a turret that provide a 360 degree coverage and an elevation range of between -20 and 30 degrees, making it an ideal choice against low-flying aircraft and targets that are close to the vehicle.\nTrailer.\nTowing an &lt;a href=\"Anti-Aircraft%20Trailer\"&gt;Anti-Aircraft Trailer&lt;/a&gt; in collaboration with another player gives the vehicle increased potential, as the trailer turret can provide additional defense when the main vehicle is suppressing enemies. Caution should be taken when carrying the AA trailer, as it is possible to trigger a proximity mine that the Insurgent Pick-Up Custom has placed, destroying the trailer. The lack of armor often makes the trailer the first vehicle to lose during a combat. Because both vehicles are considered personal vehicles, this requires two people owning at least one of the vehicles.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nInsurgent Custom=\nMachine Gun=\nMinigun=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Insurgent Pick-Up Custom can only be modified at a &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;vehicle workshop&lt;/a&gt; inside a &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt;."}

The sloping front could be taken from either the Fiero SE 2M6 or the , which is definitely where the fog lamps, rear end, and some of the trim were taken from.

The &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; sees this as an opportunity to kill Johnny, so &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt; asks &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl&lt;/a&gt; to keep Johnny away from the Forellis.\nWalkthrough.\nThe mission allows you to choose your own vehicle for this mission, so either before or after the cutscene, try to find a vehicle that has good handling, speed and durability - but not a motorcycle (note, however, that you will lose this vehicle during the course of the mission).\nAfter obtaining a vehicle, drive to the hospital across town to pickup Sindacco (the hospital is due west of the casino). Stop in the red marker in the parking lot, and Carl goes into the hospital automatically speaks to the receptionist. She says there must be some mistake, because Johnny Sindacco was picked up by an &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;ambulance&lt;/a&gt; a few moments ago. There are 3 ambulances driving around the city, each represented by a red blip on the radar. One of those ambulances has Johnny Sindacco inside. Get a fast vehicle and find that ambulance before it escapes. The ambulance with Johnny Sindacco inside is completely random (i.e., if you keep re-doing the mission, it won't always be the same ambulance). Ram the ambulance to see the driver's reaction. A message will appear on-screen to tell you if you have hit the right one.\nIf you do not hit the right ambulance, the mafia are informed and the ambulance that does contain Johnny will attempt to flee the city, giving Carl a limited amount of time to track down the other two red blips.\nWhen you finally hit the correct ambulance, it will speed off with Johnny Sindacco inside. Give chase, and ram it constantly but do not shoot the vehicle as Johnny has to survive. Eventually, two mobsters will get out of the ambulance and attack and shoot you with &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;MP5&lt;/a&gt;s. Optionally waste them, and get into the ambulance and drive Johnny to the &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Abattoir\"&gt;meat factory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whitewood%20Estates\"&gt;Whitewood Estates&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, two mobster vehicles will begin chasing the ambulance and will attempt to stop it by ramming it, doing the PIT maneuver, etc. As long as the ambulance maintains good speed and distance, they shouldn't be too much of a hazard; during this portion of the mission the biggest worry for Carl is flipping the ambulance, and crashing into walls and other cars (which will allow the mobsters to catch up). Keeping the ambulance's siren active will make most (though not all) vehicles swerve out of the way. Johnny will also begin muttering as the ambulance takes damage. Once at the meat factory, stop in the red marker and watch as two Sindacco mobsters take Johnny inside on a wheelchair. The mission is then completed.\nAfter the mission ends, Carl remains in possession of the ambulance, which can optionally be used to undertake the &lt;a href=\"paramedic\"&gt;paramedic&lt;/a&gt; side-mission if it isn't too badly damaged."}

The player is teleported to these interiors through the yellow &lt;a href=\"ENEX\"&gt;Enter-Exit&lt;/a&gt; arrows found in front of certain building entrance doors in the \"exterior world\". The function of these yellow arrows is to teleport the player from the entrance of the building to the corresponding interior of the building.\nThese separate \"worlds\" consists of replicas of the in-game map, where the main map's terrain and objects, except for their collision models, are completely unloaded and invisible, while each individual building interior model is made visible.\nAmbience Sounds.\nSimilarly to the interiors in , certain interiors have unique ambience sounds.\nParticle Effects.\nParticle effects used in interiors such as fire, water and smoke are loaded in the exterior world, although not normally visible without using glitches and exploits.\nDynamic Objects.\nDynamic objects that can be moved through the player's interactions or mission script are normally visible in the world. This includes physical doors used to load interiors, garage doors and interactive cranes.\nSkybox and Weather Presets.\nThe skybox is present inside interiors, and has two variations.\nIf the interior is loaded using the wrong skybox through exploits such as teleportation, it will be subject to glitches (usually mirrors not being rendered).\nInteriors List.\nThere are in total 18 different interior worlds, not including the exterior world where the San Andreas map is rendered. The following list includes all of the available interiors and their respective coordinates in the world map, including unused interiors.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\n1=\n2=\n3=\n4=\n5=\n6=\n7=\n8=\n9=\n10=\n11=\n12=\n13=\n14=\n15=\n16=\n17=\n18=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nPlayStation 2 Exclusive Content.\nAdditional Ammu-Nation Inacessible Room.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; version, two of the existing &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt; interiors (the &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Downtown Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Queens\"&gt;Queens&lt;/a&gt; branches) have a large, inaccessible empty room located next to the shooting range, behind the door at the side of the room. This, along with &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Content%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas/Props%23Rifle%20Range%20Targets\"&gt;unused targets&lt;/a&gt; of characters from \"GTA III\", implies that an extra shooting range challenge, similar to the one featured in &lt;a href=\"The%20Shootist\"&gt;The Shootist&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Rifle%20Range\"&gt;Rifle Range&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Vice City\", was planned at some point in development. This room was cut in all subsequent ports.\nNormally, the room can only be seen from the outside by using a &lt;a href=\"jetpack\"&gt;jetpack&lt;/a&gt; to navigate all the way to the interior. The ceiling can only be seen from certain angles, becoming fully invisible if it is landed on. The ceiling, the walls and the floor are all solid, indicating that the room was not a last minute addition. Looking from the room towards the shooting range, a space may be seen in a wall from certain angles, instead of the door that can be properly seen if looking from the shooting range towards the empty room.\nOversights.\nUnlocking Mission Interiors.\nDue to a glitch involving the Jetpack cheat in the introductory mission &lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Beginning\"&gt;In the Beginning&lt;/a&gt;, certain interior ENEX arrows available only through mission script can be unlocked.\nIf the player enables the Jetpack cheat during the &lt;a href=\"Police%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;Police Car&lt;/a&gt; segment, while Carl is inside the vehicle, the mission won't be able to throw him out of the car in the alleyway in order to progress. Instead, the player is &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;Wasted&lt;/a&gt; and sent to the nearby hospital.\nAfterwards, seven ENEX arrows are unlocked in the map. All of these arrows are intended to be available during missions only, and unavailable before and after completing the mission (except for the &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt;, which is temporarily disabled until its introduction).\nSmoke Generators.\nDue to a glitch in the &lt;a href=\"PC\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; version, smoke particle generators used in interiors (&lt;a href=\"Millie%20Perkins\"&gt;Millie Perkins&lt;/a&gt;'s bedroom torches/&lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell&lt;/a&gt; fryers) may be visible from afar by the player: if the interior is entered, the particles are generated for a few seconds, after which the player can exit the interior and quickly look at the interior's location in the sky.\nThe Fort Carson Cluckin' Bell is the easiest area to use to spot the smoke particles in the sky, due to its close proximity to the Cluckin' Bell sky interior location."}

The two have a &lt;a href=\"First%20Date%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;date&lt;/a&gt; and things seem to be going well between them. Unbeknownst to Bellic, Karen was using him as a way for the IAA to find known criminals located in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. After Bellic &lt;a href=\"The%20Snow%20Storm\"&gt;obtains&lt;/a&gt; stolen &lt;a href=\"cocaine\"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt; for drug dealer &lt;a href=\"Elizabeta%20Torres\"&gt;Elizabeta Torres&lt;/a&gt;, Karen/Michelle exposes her real identity to Niko and an accomplice of his, &lt;a href=\"Little%20Jacob\"&gt;Jacob Hughes&lt;/a&gt;. Karen orders Niko to hand over the cocaine, whilst also telling him that her superiors are interested in utilising Niko's abilities in their own operations.\nA little while after this, Karen calls Niko and asks him to meet her at the &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper%20Headquarters\"&gt;United Liberty Paper building&lt;/a&gt; located in the city. This is where Niko is introduced to &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper%20contact\"&gt;Bernard&lt;/a&gt;, codenamed Agent ULP. Bernard blackmails Bellic into doing several off-the-book jobs for the agency, under threat of leaking his criminal file to \"those clowns in the FIB\". These jobs include &lt;a href=\"Wrong%20is%20Right\"&gt;taking out a known government conspirator&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Portrait%20of%20a%20Killer\"&gt;eliminating a terrorist financer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dust%20Off\"&gt;stealing a helicopter&lt;/a&gt; to aid in &lt;a href=\"Paper%20Trail\"&gt;bringing down a known businessman that also financed terrorist acts&lt;/a&gt;. After the completion of all these jobs, Bernard agrees to help Niko locate &lt;a href=\"Darko%20Brevic\"&gt;the man&lt;/a&gt; he has been searching for.\nIn the meantime, Bernard introduces Niko to &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Gravelli\"&gt;Jon Gravelli&lt;/a&gt;, the head of the &lt;a href=\"Gambetti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Gambetti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;. Gravelli also has Niko &lt;a href=\"Entourage\"&gt;complete&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dining%20Out\"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Liquidize%20the%20Assets\"&gt;tasks&lt;/a&gt; of his own. Meanwhile, the IAA locates and abducts Darko Brevic in , &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;. When Darko gets smuggled into Liberty City, Bernard informs Niko that \"he has his man\" before cutting all ties with him. Niko then &lt;a href=\"That%20Special%20Someone\"&gt;confronts&lt;/a&gt; Darko over his betrayal to his military unit before deciding his fate.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" in 2013.\nAround &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, during the events of the update, &lt;a href=\"Don%20Percival\"&gt;Don Percival&lt;/a&gt; has scientists develop a nerve agent inside &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Labs%20and%20Research\"&gt;Humane Labs and Research&lt;/a&gt;. The IAA formulate a plan to extract the current data about the device to prevent its use by Percival or his private military, &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy using the ethernet and getting in contact with a user named \"&lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Mr. Crest&lt;/a&gt;\", the Agency is put in touch with the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist and their associates. An agent known as &lt;a href=\"Agent%2014\"&gt;Agent 14&lt;/a&gt; visits the planner's house to discuss a job: breaking &lt;a href=\"Maxim%20Rashkovsky\"&gt;Maxim Rashkovsky&lt;/a&gt;, one of the founders of Humane Labs, out of &lt;a href=\"Bolingbroke%20Penitentiary\"&gt;Bolingbroke Penitentiary&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Prison%20Break%20-%20Plane\"&gt;After&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Prison%20Break%20-%20Bus\"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Prison%20Break%20-%20Station\"&gt;different&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Prison%20Break%20-%20Wet%20Work\"&gt;preparations&lt;/a&gt;, the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist successfully &lt;a href=\"The%20Prison%20Break\"&gt;escorts&lt;/a&gt; Rashkovsky out the prison and out of the country. With Maxim freed, he was able to give the IAA details about the laboratory for them to plan a raid.\nSometime later, Agent 14 approaches the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist again to inform the heist crew about another heist: raiding Humane Labs to steal the nerve agent data located on the building's computer terminals. &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Raid%20-%20Key%20Codes\"&gt;After&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Raid%20-%20Insurgents\"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Raid%20-%20EMP\"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Raid%20-%20Valkyrie\"&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Raid%20-%20Deliver%20EMP\"&gt;preparations&lt;/a&gt;, the heist is pulled off. The \"GTA Online\" Protagonist and their associates raid the Humane Labs and Research building and manage to steal the nerve agent data. Agent 14 expresses his gladness at the fact that the crew weren't lost on the job before telling them to meet another agent for the payment. The crew meet Karen Daniels at the &lt;a href=\"Land%20Act%20Reservoir\"&gt;Land Act Reservoir&lt;/a&gt;, where she expresses her surprise that all the Agency had to do was pay them to get the crew to do their operations. Karen tells them that although the team was useful to the IAA, their usefulness has \"run out\". She hands them over a grenade to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt; that was used in the raid, before leaving with an unnamed associate. With their main goal achieved, the IAA cut contact with the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nLater in 2013, the IAA begin to lose funding as terrorist activity had calmed down. This causes the IAA and the FIB to be involved in a bureaucratic fight over which agency will receive more government funding. The IAA kidnap &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Kerimov\"&gt;Ferdinand Kerimov&lt;/a&gt;, a home theater technician who associated with an alleged terrorist, and fake his death to \"remove him from the record\". After a &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Man%20Walking\"&gt;break-in&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County%20Coroner%20Office\"&gt;Los Santos County Coroner Office&lt;/a&gt; orchestrated by the FIB that confirmed Kerimov was alive, the IAA move him to their headquarters for torture and interrogation. &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Haines\"&gt;Steve Haines&lt;/a&gt;' order, &lt;a href=\"Three%27s%20Company\"&gt;abducts Kerimov in the middle of a torture session&lt;/a&gt;, with the help of &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;. Michael and &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Norton\"&gt;Dave Norton&lt;/a&gt; use the knowledge gained from Trevor and Steve torturing Ferdinand to &lt;a href=\"By%20the%20Book\"&gt;take out&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tahir%20Javan\"&gt;Tahir Javan&lt;/a&gt;, the alleged terrorist. Tahir's death being under the hands of the FIB gives them a funding advantage over the IAA.\nHaines then gets Michael, Trevor, and Franklin to &lt;a href=\"Blitz%20Play\"&gt;hijack an IAA funding truck&lt;/a&gt; containing corruption-related fundings from drugs. This further decreases their fundings.\nWhilst Michael and Trevor are &lt;a href=\"Caida%20Libre\"&gt;in hiding&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt; from the threat of the &lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Cartel\"&gt;Madrazo Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, Steve &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Score%20Setup\"&gt;approaches&lt;/a&gt; them yet again with the claim that the Agency, ironically, had tasked &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Labs%20and%20Research\"&gt;Humane Labs and Research&lt;/a&gt; to develop a strong neurotoxin. When it is finished, the IAA would then release the same neurotoxin in a major metropolitan area and pass it off as a terrorist attack to hopefully re-instate their budget due to the demand by the public to stop terrorism. After &lt;a href=\"The%20Paleto%20Score\"&gt;acquiring necessary funding&lt;/a&gt; via a bank robbery, the alleged plan is foiled by Steve, Dave, and Michael, in yet another &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20Business\"&gt;infiltration through the facility&lt;/a&gt;. Said operation ended up with Haines captured, but the &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; piloted by Trevor that was carrying out the refrigeration unit with the neurotoxin managed to fly away with it. \nWith the events of \"The Humane Lab Raid\" that occurred a few months prior, it is unknown whether the neurotoxin was being developed by the IAA or potentially Merryweather again. But, considering the amount of IAA guards encountered whilst escaping the lab in \"Monkey Business\", it is likely that the IAA themselves were having the toxin created.\nAn IAA team led by Bernard manage to intercept Michael, Dave, Steve, and FIB associate &lt;a href=\"Andreas%20Sanchez\"&gt;Andreas Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; during a &lt;a href=\"The%20Wrap%20Up\"&gt;confrontation&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Kortz%20Center\"&gt;Kortz Center&lt;/a&gt;. The agents manage to corner the three men, up until rogue FIB agents and Merryweather Security ambush the entire group. It leads to a huge firefight, and the IAA agents get killed except for Bernard, who &lt;a href=\"Canon\"&gt;canonically&lt;/a&gt; survives the incident.\nFollowing the shootout, Dave Norton manages to pin the blame of all the prior events onto Sanchez. Because Sanchez is already dead (due to Haines shooting him during the Kortz Center shootout for ratting him out), the IAA stop pursuing the FIB.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" after 2013.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2017\"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;, during the events of update, the IAA is involved in stopping a plot by &lt;a href=\"Avon%20Hertz\"&gt;Avon Hertz&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the surface world with nuclear weapons. The event includes working with some rogue Russian agents and a group of operatives led by Agent 14.\nIn the summer of &lt;a href=\"2022\"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;, the IAA hires the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist as a special IAA field agent to investigate a budding criminal conspiracy in Southern San Andreas.\nCharacterization.\nWhile the IAA do work to protect America, their methods in doing so can be highly pragmatic and morally gray, such as using extreme interrogation techniques and threats of forcing objects into their detainees' orifices.\nThe IAA are known to use criminals for off-the-book missions and will use blackmail, threats, or simple payment to motivate them. As stated above, Steve Haines claims they are corrupt and they have indeed proven to be morally flexible when needed, but it should be noted that Haines himself was highly corrupt, and his career was apparently threatened.\nIn an apparent contradiction to Haines' accusations that the IAA created a chemical weapon at the Humane Labs, an IAA agent known as &lt;a href=\"Agent%2014\"&gt;Agent 14&lt;/a&gt; would organize a similar raid on the Humane Labs himself, claiming that the nerve agent there is being developed by &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt;. While either of them could potentially be lying, 14 would ultimately prove to be more trustworthy than Haines, as the IAA seems to retain assets rather than kill off loose ends, as Haines would try to do with those that he conscripted. Subsequent operations at the Humane Labs would lend further credence to Agent 14's claims as both a gunrunning operation, a casino heist and a security contract show that the lab is operated by Merryweather and not the IAA.\nThe IAA is also involved in the gunrunning business. Though this may also be off-the-books, they are known to use motorcycle gangs and organizations to do sales and resupplies, as well as stop unsanctioned sales. It is also known that there may be rogue agents within the agency, as seen in the mission &lt;a href=\"Work%20Dispute\"&gt;Work Dispute&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to their apparent rivalry with the FIB, the IAA seem to dislike Merryweather, as Agent 14 can be quoted as saying that while Merryweather may work government contracts, it doesn't even remotely make them the \"good\" guys, which the IAA seem to consider themselves. They also seem to have a far more openly hostile interaction with Merryweather compared to the FIB, as IAA agents have been kidnapped by the mercenaries while the IAA frequently attempts to stop Merryweather operations such as their weapon sales.\nAccording to Mrs. Rackman, there seems to be a system in place that acts as an insurance against potential infighting, as checks won't cash if a number of agents are dead. Apparently it is to prevent agents from killing each other if they have a conflict with one another.\nUniform.\nIAA agents can be seen wearing various tops, of different colors. They can wear either a tucked-in polo, a jacket, or a sweater. They sometimes may wear a lanyard around their necks with an ID on it, a badge and gun holster made for a Glock on their belts, a communication device on their right ear, sometimes a police-like tool belt, and a watch on their left wrist."}

The websites can be viewed on an in-game web browser styled similar to .\nThe player can access the Internet through any computer available in the game, such as the ones in the &lt;a href=\"Tw%40\"&gt;Tw@&lt;/a&gt; lan-houses, or the ones in the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park%20East%20Safehouse\"&gt;Middle Park East Safehouse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Playboy%20X%27s%20Penthouse\"&gt;Playboy X's Penthouse&lt;/a&gt;.

At least one site has a rather unpleasant effect when visited; &lt;a href=\"littlelacysurprisepageant.com\"&gt;littlelacysurprisepageant.com&lt;/a&gt; will immediately give the player a five-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;.\nNiko Bellic can set up &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;dates&lt;/a&gt; with people on &lt;a href=\"love-meet.net\"&gt;love-meet.net&lt;/a&gt;, or buy s and wallpapers for Niko's cell phone on &lt;a href=\"vipluxuryringtones.com\"&gt;vipluxuryringtones.com&lt;/a&gt;. The protagonist's &lt;a href=\"Mail.eyefind.info\"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; is also frequently used for staying in touch with story characters and getting mission details sometimes. For example, in \"GTA IV\", &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt; will send Niko emails asking him to &lt;a href=\"Exotic%20Exports\"&gt;steal&lt;/a&gt; certain vehicles for him. Emails from Love-Meet.net are the only emails the player can receive after completing the story.\nThere is also a site named &lt;a href=\"whattheydonotwantyoutoknow.com\"&gt;whattheydonotwantyoutoknow.com&lt;/a&gt;, which shows the player where useful hidden objects are, like pigeons (for an &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20and%20Trophies%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;achievement/trophy&lt;/a&gt;), guns, health and &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote: most website addresses can be entered manually, although this can be tedious when playing on a console version of the game, unless the player uses a USB keyboard or chatpad to input text. Note that, despite how URLs are presented in the in-game Internet and in this wiki, the \"www.\" prefix must be used; otherwise, the URLs don't work. Fortunately, the game foregoes the need to use \"http://\"."}

It begins as the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Freeway%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Freeway&lt;/a&gt;, a six-lane urban freeway traveling northeast, passing between the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Racetrack\"&gt;Vinewood Racetrack&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Bowl\"&gt;Vinewood Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. It then begins to turn north while narrowing to a rural four-lane freeway at the &lt;a href=\"Route%2018\"&gt;Route 18&lt;/a&gt; interchange, and skirts along the western edge of the &lt;a href=\"Tataviam%20Mountains\"&gt;Tataviam Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. This part is co-signed with &lt;a href=\"Route%2013\"&gt;Route 13&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the intersection of the &lt;a href=\"Palomino%20Freeway\"&gt;Palomino Freeway&lt;/a&gt;, the two routes split with Route 13 continuing north as the &lt;a href=\"Senora%20Freeway\"&gt;Senora Freeway&lt;/a&gt; and I-1 (according to the exit guide signs) turning toward &lt;a href=\"Route%2015\"&gt;Route 15&lt;/a&gt;.

The only sign that indicates I-1 leading to Senora Way is an exit sign to the Palomino Freeway. Not only is there a gap in standards, but there is a gap in the road as well for southbound traffic. Since there is no ramp between Route 15 northbound and Interstate 1 southbound, there is a gap in the Interstate on the Route 15 portion for travelers going southbound.\nIn order to legally return to Interstate 1 southbound from Route 15, one must continue on Route 13, make a U-turn on the Route 68 interchange. In order to legally go southbound on Interstate 1 after heading northbound, one must continue on Senora Way to the Route 68 interchange, take the ramp southbound on to Route 13, then keep right to get on to Interstate 1 southbound."}

Interstate 4 ends at a two-stack semi-directional T interchange with &lt;a href=\"Sustancia%20Road\"&gt;Sustancia Road&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough the Interstate system connects all of Los Santos, it is not possible to drive directly on Interstate 4 to Los Santos International Airport. To get there, the player must intersect with Interstate 5 in Little Seoul, then drive approximately 1400 ft and exit to &lt;a href=\"Route%2022\"&gt;Route 22&lt;/a&gt; and immediately exit to &lt;a href=\"Route%2019\"&gt;Route 19&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe speed limit on Interstate 4 is 60 mp/h or 100 km/h.\nInfluence.\nThe freeway takes its name from in .\nInterstate 4/Olympic Freeway is based on\u00a0, as it features a &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Transit\"&gt;Los Santos Metro&lt;/a&gt; line running down the middle of the freeway, much like the real 105 features the (formerly Green Line until 2020) of the running in the median of the freeway.

Tommy kills all the Haitian bodyguards on the Tropics and then blow one of them up to leave Rico some space in which to drop Tommy off.\nRico the drops Tommy off, the Streetwannabe's, wielding &lt;a href=\"Ruger\"&gt;Ruger&lt;/a&gt;s, soon begin to attack Tommy.

There are two in the garden, one in the entrance, two around the sides of the house, one on the roof and two on the right side of the house and the small bridge hiding to ambush Tommy. When they're all dead, pick up the briefcases of drugs that they drop. There are two near the house and one in the alcove where the negotiations were taking place. Once Tommy collects the drugs, two surviving Haitians in a &lt;a href=\"Dinghy%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Dinghy&lt;/a&gt; blow up Rico's Jetmax, land, and start shooting at Tommy, but he still kills them.

The tail lights may also have been inspired by the . The circular fog lights on the grille may have been taken from , such as the . The wheels are loosely based on the RAYS Volk Racing 370 Artisan Spirit with VR370 Aero covers. \nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe design of the car is boxy and traditional, where the front end is predominated by the bulky bumper with a lower splitter, square fog lamps and license plate. The upper area is occupied by a black grille bearing two circular fog lamps and the manufacturer emblem in the centre, along with a \"turbo\" badge below the passenger-side foglamp. Besides the grille there are two circular main lamps and rectangular turn signals located in black housings and surrounded by black trim. The bonnet is mostly flat and features a large intake near the windscreen.\nThe sides of the car feature a detail running through the whole car and passing through the doors, while the fenders have a flared shape and a set of black mudguards. The cabin area makes use of plastic trim around the windows, as well as a windscreen banner and black mirror wings. The same \"turbo\" badge can be seen on the front fenders.\nThe rear of the car features another bulky bumper with overriders, while the upper area features a set of rectangular tail lamps and a section for the license plate. The boot is flat in appearance and bears the corresponding badges displaying the manufacturer and name, including the \"turbo\" badge. On the passenger side, a single exhaust tube can be seen, just below the bumper.\nThe interior and dials are shared with the &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Compact\"&gt;Blista Compact&lt;/a&gt;, which are a variation of the ones found inside the &lt;a href=\"Futo\"&gt;Futo&lt;/a&gt;. However, the steering wheel bears the corresponding manufacturer emblem in the centre.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the body, while the secondary one is applied on the roof, pillars, sunstrip and bumper ridges. It has unique rims with small spokes around the dish, with \"VULCAR RACING\" markings over them.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Nebula Turbo is an underperforming car in its class; it could be compared with the Futo in terms of launch time and traction, but feels much heavier and has longer stop times. The top speed is relatively average for its style, but given its class as a Sports Classics vehicle, is somewhat lackluster given some of the other higher-end choices within this class, making its use within straight-line racing in this category substandard. Traction suffers a lot regarding the unfamiliar weight, and the suspension has a lot to be desired from no upgrades and Lowered Suspension upgrades, thanks to one of the advanced flags increasing the bounciness of the suspension, making the car rock about and, in turn, difficult to steer. \nSimilar to some cars added with the update, the vehicle has an unsymmetrical toe value (see &lt;a href=\"%23Bugs/Glitches\"&gt;Bugs/Glitches&lt;/a&gt;), causing its steering to veer off towards the left, making the car somewhat difficult to drive for the first time.\nThe Nebula Turbo has two Advanced Flags enabled. \nWhile the purpose of the second flag is yet unknown, the first flag increases the vehicle's suspension \"springiness\", causing it to bounce excessively while driving.\nThe vehicle is relatively heavy for its body size; with a lateral mass of 1320 kg, it is still vulnerable to larger vehicles and is incapable of ramming other vehicles off the road, but in contrast, is not easily threatened by other, similar sized vehicles.\nThe Nebula Turbo is powered by a 4-cylinder engine coupled to a 4-speed gearbox, powering the rear wheels. It is stated by name, website and badging to be turbocharged, yet there is no model or sound to actually support this unless the Turbo modification is applied, in which case, a turbo dump valve sound will be applied, as with any other vehicle. The last four \"Hood\" modifications allow the car to have one or two turbochargers (with the last one switching to a single-cam V8 engine), but do not improve performance in any way. The engine sound is relatively low-revving and loud."}

Michael's response will depend on the last mission that the player did before the session:\nDr. Friedlander then asks if Michael had any other violent outbursts. Michael's response will depend on the player's actions in the game; sometimes Michael will say that he feels like \"two different people\" and that he doesn't like either of them. He may also say that he hurts other people without thinking and then feels bad about what he did, and other times he might say that he killed someone on the way to the clinic and that he is a \"sick hypocrite\". Regardless of Michael's response, Friedlander will give advice that the player can either accept or reject.\nFriedlander then asks Michael about his sexual behavior, again Michael's response depends on the player's actions; If the player did not sleep with any &lt;a href=\"Prostitute\"&gt;prostitutes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Call\"&gt;booty calls&lt;/a&gt;, Michael will say that he had \"thoughts\" but did not have any problems or he may say that he has been a \"good boy\" and didn't have any problems at all. On the other hand, if the player slept with a prostitute or booty call, Michael will say that he \"got lonely\" and called a girl. Friedlander will chastise Michael if he confesses this.\nThe phone session concludes with Michael saying that he is \"kind of doing better\", to which Isiah says that therapy can really help him and because of this he should be pleased with what he is doing. Isiah then says that he needs to end the session and that phone sessions are a little more expensive, but \"so fulfilling\".\nFriedlander ends the session by asking Michael to speak again soon. Michael hangs up and pays Friedlander $1,500."}

The engine bay has the corresponding radiator on the front and two exhaust pipes on either cylinder block.\nThe rear section has a black seat with room for two occupants, a red tail lamp on the rear end and a short plate holder below, with the corresponding license plate and the turn signals. The rear wheel is connected to the vehicle by a dual-sided swing-arm finished in chrome, having a CFRP mudguard, a single suspension spring and two side frames holding the foot pegs for both occupants. The exhaust tubes are seen on either side of the wheel and are finished in carbon fibre, while the chain drive and sprocket are seen on the left.\nThe primary colour of the bike is applied on the front fairing, mirrors, fuel tank, protective frames and rear, while the secondary colour is applied on the side markings.

The rear lights are similar on the ones from the , except connected similarly to the . The side skirts of the Neo bear resemblance to the . The stock front bumper, grille, bonnet, and headlights seem to take inspiration from the , as well as the stock wheels being near-identical to the ones found on the .\nDesign.\nThe Neo is depicted with a rather aerodynamic design, where the front end features a small black splitter and an open section in the centre, while the area above houses a rounded mesh grille with black vertical elements in front of it and mesh side intakes intended to direct air flow to the front brakes. The upper edges of the car have black housings with circular headlamps that are encased in silver/chrome, as well as modern, LED-like light strips on the inner and upper sides of each housing. On the bonnet area, there are distinctive formations around the centre of the front compartment, which curve towards either side of the windscreen base, along with dual mesh intakes on the outer sides and the manufacturer emblem on the front. Said compartment opens to reveal a small luggage area, various riveted details on the side borders, numerous small intakes on the front area, and a carbon-fibre windscreen base, holding a single central wiper.\nThe sides of the car denote its aerodynamic profile, where the front fenders have distinctive formations starting from the front grille and curving towards the top of the wheel arches, before following the shape of the arches towards the bottom. The middle section consist of various body lines above the skirting area and upper side, the latter going towards the rear end of the car. The vehicle has black skirts, concave sections leading to a set of small intakes, and silver badges with the car's name on it, as well as inset portions for the door handles and key holes. The car makes use of scissor doors, which seem to rotate further away from the car's body in a similar manner to the &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt; (in contrast with most sports cars with similar door design). A set of amber marker lights can be seen on the rearmost portions of the rear fenders.\nOn the greenhouse area, the car features black trim around the windows and the sunroof, black B-pillars and coloured rear-view mirror shells near the A-pillars, which have dual support frames. Directly behind the cabin area, there are triangular rear-quarter windows and a large rear window that exposes the engine bay and the carbon-fibre sections beside it, while the rear section has an impressed area on the boot compartment that follows the shape of the black trim around the rear window, as well as a small lip spoiler at the end.\nThe rear end of the car features modern tail lamp strips, where the outer curved ones work as the main/brake lamps, while the central one work as a third brake lamp. These lamps do not have a defined separation and appear as a single unit, but the central one spans about half the car's width, and the edges align with the halves of the outer exhaust tubes. The area below the tail lamps is predominated by a black section with a mesh vent on the upper side, the dual exit, dual exhaust tubes on the hexagonal sections, the number plate and square reverse lamps on the lower area and a silver/chrome diffuser with an open section at the bottom. The manufacturer emblem can be seen below the central tail lamp, while the silver lettering can be seen embossed over the vented section. The underside of the car is mostly carbon-plated, with an elevated section on the front area and an exposed rear axle.\nThe interior of the car is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Itali%20GTO\"&gt;Itali GTO&lt;/a&gt;, being a derivative of the one used in the &lt;a href=\"Nero\"&gt;Nero&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nero%20Custom\"&gt;Nero Custom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"XA-21\"&gt;XA-21&lt;/a&gt;. It also reuses the same dial set, which is the same one found on the &lt;a href=\"X80%20Proto\"&gt;X80 Proto&lt;/a&gt;. The manufacturer logo can be seen on the horn cap and on the headrests, while the silver lettering is seen embossed on the passenger side, below the aircon unit.\nThe primary colour of the vehicle is applied on the bodywork and the rear-view mirrors, while the secondary one is applied on the surroundings of the door key holes and the portions of the greenhouse area that are not occupied by the black trim and windows. A trim colour is also available for the interior, being applied on the dashboard, the steering wheel, part of the doors, part of the seats, the surrounding of the gear shifter and the interior stitching. The rim design is unique, having six main spokes placed around the inner centre and three smaller ones between each main spoke, placed around the outer centre. It has low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\nPerformance-wise, the Neo is highly comparable with the &lt;a href=\"Itali%20GTO\"&gt;Itali GTO&lt;/a&gt;, with 4WD output and high acceleration. It is much more stable on rough and uneven roads, however, and powerslides are kept short but controllable. Cornering is a little underwhelming in comparison to other high performance Sports Class cars. The top speed is great. Off-road, however, is far less recommended as it can slide out far too easily, often spinning itself out of control.\nThe Neo has two Advanced Flags enabled. \nWhile the purpose of the second flag is yet unknown, the first flag increases the vehicle's suspension \"springiness\", causing it to bounce excessively while driving.\nThe vehicle is powered by a single-cam V8 engine and coupled to a 6-speed gearbox, powering all four wheels with equal torque distribution.

The front end is inspired by the , while the rear end bears similarities to the and , the latter whose taillights are used for the Neon.\nThe Neon is depicted with a traditional 4-door layout and sporty elements, where the front fascia features a carbon-fibre extender/splitter at the bottom, while the bumper area has a trapezium-shaped mesh intake on the centre and a large one that spans about the entirety of the car's width, with a narrower section above the central intake. On the upper area, the car has distinctive inset formations containing black housings, each one consisting of circular lamps and modern LED-like strips, with the three inner strips working as high-beam lamps. A set of dual vertical intakes can be seen beside the bumper intakes and the headlamps, while the bonnet area has two concave formations on the sides and the Pfister logo on the front.\nThe sides of the car make use of inset formations passing through the doors, fins near the front wheels and silver/chrome details on the front fenders and part of the front doors, while the lower areas have concave formations and carbon-fibre skirts, the latter bearing blue \"PFISTER\" badges below the rear doors and \"RAPID CHARGER\u2013E\" near the front wheels. The greenhouse area has black trimmings around the windows and carbon-fibre supports on the front doors and near the A-pillars, holding body-coloured mirror shells.\nThe rear of the car is curved in appearance and bears modern light strips, with the upper one spanning the whole car's width and working as the main lamp, while the middle and lower ones occupy about one quarter of the car's width and work as the brake and main lamps, respectively. Within the tail lamp set, there is a black section with blue \"PFISTER\" badges on it, which is also illuminated when the vehicle\u2019s lights are turned on. The middle area of the rear bumper has the corresponding section for the number plate and a distinctive shape for the bumper area, while the lower area is predominated by a diffuser that is mostly finished in carbon fibre and a rear exit vent, also housing a single reverse light at the bottom of the same vent.\nThe car's interior is the same used in the &lt;a href=\"Nero\"&gt;Nero&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nero%20Custom\"&gt;Nero Custom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"XA-21\"&gt;XA-21&lt;/a&gt;, but uses the same dial set from the &lt;a href=\"Raiden\"&gt;Raiden&lt;/a&gt;, using the corresponding \"Kw\" dial in place of the tachometer. The horn cap bears the Pfister logo.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork, the lower portions of the rear diffuser and the outer surrounding of the stock rims, while the secondary colour is applied on the mirror shells. Although not accessible, a trim colour is also available for the dashboard, horn cap, part of the doors, seats and overstitches. It shares the same rim design as the &lt;a href=\"Osiris\"&gt;Osiris&lt;/a&gt;, being five dual silver/chrome spokes with a black centre, fitted with low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\nContrary to some electric supercars, namely the &lt;a href=\"Cyclone\"&gt;Cyclone&lt;/a&gt;, the Neon possesses impressive traction, which, combined with its acceleration nature, can make the car competitive in certain racing tracks with the &lt;a href=\"Feltzer\"&gt;Feltzer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Elegy%20RH8\"&gt;Elegy RH8&lt;/a&gt;, despite the &lt;a href=\"Pariah\"&gt;Pariah&lt;/a&gt;'s total domination. In the meantime, its top speed is way down the list, being a close match with that of the &lt;a href=\"Raiden\"&gt;Raiden&lt;/a&gt;, as can be predicted from an electric car. This major downside could prevent the Neon from coping huge gaps in &lt;a href=\"Stunt%20Races\"&gt;Stunt Races&lt;/a&gt;, and thus not advised to be used.\nAlthough its powerplant is not very clear due to the lack of details, the Neon uses a battery cell powering two motors, explaining the AWD layout with equal torque distribution (a layout similar to the real-life Taycan/Mission E). Like most electric cars, it has a quiet engine sound that is clearly heard in quiet areas with the radio off."}

The rear lights bear a slight resemblance to those found on the . The design of the stock exhausts, diffuser, side skirts, side profile, and side trim shape seems to be inspired by that found on the . The headlight shape might be inspired by the one found on either the or the .\nDesign.\nThe Nero, being a modernized version of the &lt;a href=\"Adder\"&gt;Adder&lt;/a&gt;, shares some of the styling cues from the aforementioned car, having a similar bulky profile and characteristic features. The front shares the grille and intake positioning from the Adder, but twin separations are seen over the intakes. The headlamp housings assume a similar positioning and shape from the Adder's, but use a set of square lamps with small light strips below. Chrome details can be seen on the intake separations, lower centre and grille surrounding, as well as a manufacturer emblem placed over the grille. The bonnet area is similar to the one on the Adder, and features a carbon-fibre panel in front of the windscreen.\nThe sides of the car assume a similar pattern to the Adder, featuring a curvature passing from the lower side and going up to the roof area. However, there is an angular line where the side vents are located, also finished in chrome. skirts are seen at the bottom, while rear-view mirror shells with chrome strips are seen on the cabin area, as well as black rear-quarter panels. A separation can be found at the rear like the Adder, but does not extend further down, as it passes directly above the engine. The Nero, like the &lt;a href=\"T20\"&gt;T20&lt;/a&gt;, features an active spoiler.\nThe rear of the car features dual circular exhausts and a manufaturer emblem on the central panel, as well as carbon-fibre rear vents on the outer edges, surrounded by red light strips. The lower area is dominated by triangle-shaped vents on the edges, a trapezium-shaped vent on the centre and a black six-element diffuser, with a small reverse light centered on it. Its underside also uses a CFRP plate covering the entirety of the vehicle, exposing the section around the rear axle.\nIts interior is very modernized, featuring a dashboard with two main analog dials and a digital display, two AC units on the center and two more at either side of the dashboard, as well as a &lt;a href=\"Meinmacht\"&gt;Meinmacht&lt;/a&gt; radio display. The steering wheel features four buttons and two paddle shifts behind it, as well as the Truffade logo on the horn cap. The gear stick is very stilized and the seats have a sleek appearance, appearing to be some kind of race seats.\nThe car's main body, upper side and rear panel are painted in a primary colour, while the front bumper, part of the cabin, sides and rear are painted in a secondary colour. A trim colour is also available for its interior, mainly the panels, stitching and horn cap. Although not accessible, part of the engine covers are assigned with the \"dial\" colour, which is set to black in purchased examples. A set of seven-spoke rims with a manufacturer emblem on the black, bolted-on centre can be seen, wrapped in low-profile tyres. The rims can be also painted, although only those generated in the &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; may have a colour.\nPerformance.\nThe Nero's performance is a significant improvement from the &lt;a href=\"Adder\"&gt;Adder&lt;/a&gt;, the previous &lt;a href=\"Truffade\"&gt;Truffade&lt;/a&gt; hypercar, in that acceleration is very similar. The vehicle becomes heavier, however, but it helps on keeping its stability, as well as being rather tough to push, being an ideal choice for stunt races.\nAlthough the engine is unclear to identify, it seems to emulate the Chiron's . However, unlike the Adder's one, which is basically composed of two V8 covers, it uses its own texture, closely resembling the aforementioned engine and with the Truffade's logo embossed on each cam cover. Said engine is coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a mid engine, all wheel drive (20% front, 80% rear) layout. Its engine sound is identical to the one from the Adder, albeit slightly louder."}

The exhausts from the regular Nero are replaced by a quad-setup, similar to the ones found on the , while the stock spoiler may be a mix of the Bugatti and the . \nDesign.\nThe front end is fitted with a splitter spanning the width of the car and supported by two small struts, as well as small canards on the outer edges and an orange racing tow hook below the grille. The bonnet area has been extensively modified with safety pins, a larger carbon-fibre panel and slatted intakes over the fenders. Bolt/rivet details can be also seen on the fittings of the windscreen.\nThe sides of the car denote a more aerodynamic profile, featuring an inset/cut-out section on the front fenders. It has larger carbon-fibre skirts with small fins on either side, and the doors seem to have visible hinges and rear-vision cameras in place of standard mirror shells (though they are not seen functioning in any way). A small antenna can be seen on the roof, and small scoops can be seen on the rear fenders and boot area, together with a conventional spoiler/wing attached to it from a middle frame and the outer edges.\nThe rear of the car is mostly identical in design and features quad exhaust tubes on the central panel, along with a manufacturer emblem on the passenger side. Again, its underside uses a CFRP plate covering the entirety of the vehicle, exposing the section around the rear axle.\nThe interior is shared with the standard Nero. However, the stock seats have a Truffade 'T' emblem embedded on the headrest. Certain modifications, however, may replace it with a race-style interior, using a digital speedometer/display and numerous switches around the dashboard, similar to cars like the &lt;a href=\"RE-7B\"&gt;RE-7B&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ETR1\"&gt;ETR1&lt;/a&gt;.\nColour distribution is the same as the regular Nero, with the main body, upper side and rear panel being painted in a primary colour, and the front bumper, part of the cabin, sides and rear being painted in a secondary colour. However, the details on the splitter and skirts, as well as the side walls on the tyres, matches with the car's primary colour. Again, a trim colour is available for the interior panels, stitching and horn cap, as well as a dial colour that also affects the radio display. The vehicle uses the same set of seven-spoke rims with a manufacturer emblem on the black, bolted-on centre, wrapped in low-profile tyres. Again, the rims can also support a dedicated colour, although only naturally-generated examples may have one (which is set to white like the regular Nero).\nPerformance.\nBeing a GT-oriented variant of the standard Nero, the car receives upgrades in speed and acceleration, where the files list the car as being 0.2 km/h faster than the regular Nero. The car gains upgraded handling thanks to the weight reduction, likely due to the carbon fibre inserts around the entire body. The vehicle's spoiler also supplies more downforce and control. Despite the weight reduction, the vehicle remains relatively stable, being even more ideal for stunt races.\nThe car retains the same engine and sound as the normal Nero, while the model is also shared from the &lt;a href=\"Adder\"&gt;Adder&lt;/a&gt;, another Truffade supercar.\nThe Nero Custom's statistical stock top speed is 117 mph / 188.3 km/h.\nThis makes it, at stock, one of the fastest vehicles in the game, in a straight line, tied with the &lt;a href=\"X80%20Proto\"&gt;X80 Proto&lt;/a&gt;, however when modified, vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20900R\"&gt;Banshee 900R&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pariah\"&gt;Pariah&lt;/a&gt; will exceed this speed, even if the Nero Custom is upgraded too."}

What angers him the most is that they've manage to break apart his &lt;a href=\"Impotent%20Rage\"&gt;Impotent Rage&lt;/a&gt; statue. Before Trevor can exact his revenge, he threatens &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Hebert\"&gt;Wade&lt;/a&gt; into quickly finding &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael Townley&lt;/a&gt;, which he has so far been unsuccessful in doing.\nOutside the trailer, Trevor explains to Ron that two weapons planes will be landing at &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Sandy Shores Airfield&lt;/a&gt; later that day, with Trevor planning to \"appropriate them\". To prepare for this, Trevor and Ron take 2 &lt;a href=\"Blazer\"&gt;Blazer&lt;/a&gt;s and he rides to the local &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt; while Ron goes to the vantage point. Trevor threatens the &lt;a href=\"Melvin\"&gt;store clerk&lt;/a&gt; into giving him a &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Sniper Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, a scope, and a &lt;a href=\"suppressor\"&gt;suppressor&lt;/a&gt; all for free. After leaving the store, Trevor rides to meet Ron at a water tower to the north of the airfield. A few hours later, under cover of darkness, Ron makes his way towards the airfield whilst Trevor watches on through a sniper rifle. After Trevor kills any watching bikers, Ron plants a bomb on a gas tank at the airfield. A &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; piloted by several enemies appears above and Ron warns Trevor to shoot it down, so they won't notice about the attack. Trevor shoots its pilot. A &lt;a href=\"Cutscenes\"&gt;cutscene&lt;/a&gt; briefly plays when the pilotless chopper descends and eventually crashes.\nDespite this, The Lost noticed the attack and prepared to launch a counterattack. As Ron prepares to escape in one of the planes, Trevor, instead of riding along with him, decides to hop onto the plane's wing on his stomach. While Ron is piloting the plane out of the hangar, Trevor fires at the members of the The Lost MC whilst laying on his stomach, back and side, killing enemies who can threaten Ron and his plane.\nAs Ron taxis further down the runway, Trevor leaps off the plane's wing and takes another &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20800\"&gt;plane&lt;/a&gt;. While taking off, Trevor hits two bikers, one flailing out from underneath the speeding plane, while the other leaps onto and grasps the wing as Trevor takes off, but Trevor quickly takes him out.\nRon leads Trevor over the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt;, where he encourages Trevor to fly low to avoid getting spotted by the &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;military base&lt;/a&gt;.

Another violent incident yesterday saw a massive shootout between drug factions at Sandy Shores Airfield that left many dead and police confused. Police Spokesman Elmore Thickett told reporters \"these violent incidents are becoming all too common in Blaine County. Sure, we've always had problems - this is a poor county - but the past few months have seen things get completely out of control. We don't know how to cope and are requesting help from the state. So far, they seen more interested in posing in movies than stopping folk up here from getting shot but that ain't nothing new.\" Experts are blaming the violence on a multi-sided turf war with participants trying to gain control of the cocaine trade from Mexico into Los Santos, as well as the methamphetamine trade most of which is manufactured locally before being sold overseas and across the country. As many as five major gangs may be involved in the trade. Some are seen as particularly deranged. The highly lucrative crystal methamphetamine trade seems to be headquartered in the towns around the Alamo Sea, while it is also believed several Mexican cartels also have a presence in the area. Police have attributed several recent massacres to an on-going turf war thought to involve four or five gangs from Los Santos and two or more local operations. Some recent shootouts have been so bloody, some local politicians are calling for increased firepower and have requested either military or paramilitary support to control recent events. Don Percival, CEO of Merry Weather has offered his company's services. Reports link several incidents to a particular local drug dealer police are desperately trying to identify.

The battle takes place inside the &lt;a href=\"RC%20Battle%20Ground\"&gt;RC Battle Ground&lt;/a&gt;. To win, Zero must navigate across the area and safely get his &lt;a href=\"RC%20Bandit\"&gt;RC Bandit&lt;/a&gt; into Berkley's compound. However, Berkley has an &lt;a href=\"RC%20Goblin\"&gt;RC Goblin&lt;/a&gt; dropping debris on the path leading to the compound, blocking Zero's route along the way. The player must use Zero's RC Goblin to remove any obstructions in Zero's way. He must also destroy any tanks that could be potential hazards to the RC Bandit.

Zero has three Goblins, so if one is destroyed he will spawn in another, though the player will restart from the beginning of the compound. The Bandit's health level appears on-screen. Begin by removing the first barrel in Zero's way- just drop it in the \"river\". Zero will drive to a gap in the path and request a bridge. However, if Carl places one of the planks over the gap, Zero will drive directly into the firing range of one of Berkley's three &lt;a href=\"RC%20Tiger\"&gt;RC Tiger&lt;/a&gt;s. Therefore, a better alternative is to leave Zero's Bandit at the gap while Carl destroys the three tanks - one is directly ahead along the path, the second is near the second gap, and the third is directly outside Berkley's base. If time permits, drop a bomb on Berkley's Goblin to stop the influx of barrels. Then, bridge the gaps and follow alongside the Bandit to get rid of any barrels remaining on the path."}

Over the course of these missions, Trevor assaults the various celebrities to obtain the requested items and even goes as far as killing Mark Fostenburg.\nAfter retrieving the items, Trevor meets up once more with Nigel and Mrs. Thornhill to deliver the desired souvenirs. During the meeting, the couple spot their favourite action star, &lt;a href=\"Al%20Di%20Napoli\"&gt;Al Di Napoli&lt;/a&gt;, and ask Trevor to help them get him to a \"private interview\" they'd set up in an abandoned garage. Trevor takes Nigel and Mrs. Thornhill on a high-speed car chase after Di Napoli, who ultimately crashes his car and gets kidnapped by the elderly stalkers.\nAfter holding him captive for a few days, Nigel and Mrs. Thornhill decide they can't keep Al locked up any more, since he refuses to eat and they fear he'll starve. The elderly Brits ask Trevor what they can do and he suggests to either release him somewhere in the countryside where they can get away before he can contact anyone or \"sending him on a trip he can't come back from\". Since they are, as Nigel himself puts it, \"not very good with goodbyes\", the Brits ask Trevor to take care of Al and then send him away.\nThe player then gets to choose whether they kill Al by parking the car he's stuck in on the railway line or they drive out to the countryside and let him go. Trevor can even blow up the car before entering it and kill Nigel and Mrs. Thornhill. Either way, Nigel and Mrs. Thornhill make no further appearances in the game."}

It's me, McAffrey. I've got some news that &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore&lt;/a&gt; might appreciate. Come see me up at the usual place."}

{"id": "18534", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=18534", "title": "Nightblade", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Chop%20Shop\"&gt;Liberty Chop Shop&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Western%20Motorcycle%20Company\"&gt;Western Motorcycle Company&lt;/a&gt; Nightblade is a cruiser motorcycle featured in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the update.\nDesign.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nThe Nightblade appears to be based on the Harley-Davidson Rocker C FXCWC.\nThe bike is depicted with a rather long profile, featuring a small front mudguard attached to the center of the wheel and with inverted forks. A circular headlight is mounted on the lower clamp in the triple trees with two bullet-style turn signals on either side of each side. The handlebars sit atop by a set of risers.\nThe main body features a single lower frame that splits into two frames below, a long fuel tank with chrome trim around the side panels, a rounded oil tank and a black leather seat that extends towards the rear fender and having a rigid-style swingarm on the rear. The engine bay features a circular air filter and a two-into-one exhaust on the right. The section below the oil tank/battery cover features foot pegs for the passenger.\nThe rear section consist of a small fender with a single red light and license plate on the end, while the turn signals are mounted on a rigid bracket connected to the red tail light and the end of the bike's swingarm. The rear wheel is connected to a triangular swingarm and features the corresponding chain drive and sprocket on the left.\nThe primary color of the bike is applied on most of the bike's components, while the secondary color is applied on the side panels of the fuel tank. It uses a set of wire spokes similar to the &lt;a href=\"Freeway\"&gt;Freeway&lt;/a&gt; and wrapped in medium-profile tires, with the rear one being wider.\nLike other similar bikes, there was a &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Content\"&gt;Beta&lt;/a&gt; version of it in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\". It was mostly identical to the \"TLAD\" iteration, but the transmission cover had \"Nightblade\" badges on it and the handlebars were slightly different, with a single speedometer on the center.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Nightblade returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" with a complete redesign, inspired from the Harley Davidson Night Rod Special.\nThe Nightblade retains the generally long design, but assumes a more robust body. The front retains most of the features from the \"TLAD\" iteration, but the headlight is mounted on the upper clamp and lacks the turn signals on the sides, while the handlebars have sleek mirror wings.\nThe main body has tubular frames around the body, a dam spoiler in front of the engine bay and side covers located behind the triple clamps and below the fuel tank, while the engine bay has a single exhaust pipe on the right side, coming from the front cylinder block. Directly over the fuel tank area, there is a dial set derived from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt;, but rearranged in a way that the speedometer is on the center, the temperature gauge on the left and the fuel gauge on the right. WMC badges can be seen on either side of the fuel tank as well.\nThe rear area of the bike features a flat leather seat with white outlining around it, together with a long rear fender with a wide red brake tail light on the end. The rear wheel is connected by a black, dual-sided swingarm, supported by what looks like air suspension tubes on either side. The chain drive and sprocket are fully animated and feature a black covering above, while a small plate holder can be seen on the left, with the license plate and a small red main light above.\nThe primary color of the bike is applied on the main components, while the secondary color is applied on the frames. The wheels appear to be similar to the \"Speedway\" rims also available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with a permanent black finish and wrapped in high-profile tires, with the rear one being wider. The outer surrounding of the rims can also support a dedicated wheel color, which can be painted by selecting a custom rear wheel, applying a color and change back to the stock wheel (as it won't reset to the default alloy color).\nPerformance.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nThe Nightblade has above average top speed and acceleration, as well as acceptable braking. However, the heaviness of the bike and the long body often struggles to take corners and is unable to perform &lt;a href=\"wheelie\"&gt;wheelie&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Nightblade uses a chain-driven, V-twin internal combustion engine with a 5-speed manual transmission, as evidenced by the foot-actuated gear shifter. The engine emits a high-revving, odd-firing noise which sounds to be partially or fully unrestricted, identical to the &lt;a href=\"Lycan\"&gt;Lycan&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Nightblade performs well for its type. It has a relatively high top speed and good acceleration. Its handling is also nippy compared to other choppers. Its heavy weight does not significantly restrict its ability to maneuver, although it does stop the player form being able to perform wheelies. Its durability is weak against harsh collisions and landings after a jump as it can only take a couple of punishments before the bike starts billowing smoke and eventually catch fire and explode.\nThe bike is powered by a push-rod V-Twin engine and coupled to a 5-speed manual gearbox, evident by the foot-actuated shifter. The engine produces a distinctively low-revving, loud engine sound, slightly smother than the ones from most chopper bikes."}

Unlike strip clubs, however, interactive nightclubs in the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series are relatively rare, only appearing in ', ', \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\". Most other games in the series also feature nightclubs but these are inaccessible and play no part in the storyline.\nDescription.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Malibu%20Club%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Malibu Club&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Vice City\" is the first interactive nightclub in the series. It becomes accessible early in the game, containing a lively interior complete with an active dancefloor, a bar, and an overhead office. The club may even be purchased by &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt; after \"&lt;a href=\"Shakedown%20%28GTA%20Vice%20City%29\"&gt;Shakedown&lt;/a&gt;\", and its office used as a meeting place &lt;a href=\"The%20Job\"&gt;to stage a heist&lt;/a&gt;. There are also entertainers onstage, parodying the .\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", clubs may be used by the player to &lt;a href=\"Rhythm-based%20Minigames\"&gt;dance&lt;/a&gt; with a girl, in a minigame similar in fashion to the &lt;a href=\"Lowrider%20Challenge\"&gt;Lowrider Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. The interior of clubs also comes complete with &lt;a href=\"Arcade%20Games\"&gt;video games&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vending%20Machines\"&gt;snack and drink machines&lt;/a&gt;. There are three clubs in \"GTA San Andreas\":\nTwo songs from &lt;a href=\"SF-UR\"&gt;SF-UR&lt;/a&gt; usually play in the background when the player is not dancing, these songs being ' \" and 's \". For songs played when the player dances, see .\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThree nightclubs are named in \"GTA IV\" but none are accessible. &lt;a href=\"Maisonette%209\"&gt;Maisonette 9&lt;/a&gt; in particular is occasionally mentioned in \"GTA IV\" media but does not appear, while &lt;a href=\"Bahama%20Mamas\"&gt;Bahama Mamas&lt;/a&gt; is not accessible due to a temporary closure.\nThe only interactive club is &lt;a href=\"Club%20Liberty\"&gt;Club Liberty&lt;/a&gt;, a semi-interactive club in &lt;a href=\"Northwood\"&gt;Northwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, which serves as a &lt;a href=\"bar\"&gt;bar&lt;/a&gt; where the player and a friend or girlfriend can &lt;a href=\"Drinking\"&gt;drink&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nNightclubs take center stage in \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", with three clubs central to the game's plot:\nWhile in Maisonette 9 or Hercules, the player can partake in &lt;a href=\"Rhythm-based%20Minigames\"&gt;dancing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Drinking\"&gt;taking shots of liquor&lt;/a&gt;. Maisonette 9 also allows the player to perform &lt;a href=\"Club%20Management\"&gt;Club Management&lt;/a&gt; side activities, as well as engage in champagne drinking contests.\nUnlike their predecessors, nightclubs in \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" are only open at night, and are closed during the day.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" features several nightclubs but, with the exception of one Strangers and Freaks mission, none of them is accessible. The clubs are:\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" features fully accessible, interactive and customizable &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs\"&gt;Nightclubs&lt;/a&gt; as part of the update. They can be purchased on &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank%20Foreclosure\"&gt;Maze Bank Foreclosure&lt;/a&gt; and can be customized with an array of designs, names, lights and more, and serve as both a &lt;a href=\"Safehouse\"&gt;Safehouse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs\"&gt;business&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Properties%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;property&lt;/a&gt; that the player can relax in. \nIn update, a new nighclub, &lt;a href=\"The%20Music%20Locker\"&gt;The Music Locker&lt;/a&gt;, was introduced. It is located directly underneath &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20%26amp%3B%20Resort\"&gt;The Diamond Casino &amp; Resort&lt;/a&gt;, and it is accessible to all players; however, owners of a &lt;a href=\"Master%20Penthouse\"&gt;Master Penthouse&lt;/a&gt; will have no entry fee, exclusive access to table service in the club's VIP section, and the only ones allowed direct entry into the club through The Diamond's elevator."}

As part of quality of life improvements, such calls were made to be only manually triggered.\nThe player can purchase any one of 10 locations from &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank%20Foreclosures\"&gt;Maze Bank Foreclosures&lt;/a&gt;.\nCustomization.\n&lt;includeonly&gt;\nPurchase.\nOn approaching the site of their new business, the player receives an odd text from Tony:\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;\nSetup.\nAs with other businesses, the player must first conduct Setup work to start up their business. After that, the nightclub will be filled with the necessary equipment and employees to keep the club running, and will be ready for use. \nSetup: Staff.\nThe player will be tasked into picking up three staff members located around &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; that Tony has poached. Tony requests that the player drives in his &lt;a href=\"Schafter%20V12\"&gt;Schafter V12&lt;/a&gt; to 3 destinations to pick them up.\nThe player just needs to pull up and attract the NPC's attention (honking the horn is sufficient). All three can be collected in one trip. After they have been collected, they all need to be taken back to the Nightclub safely.\nSetup: Equipment.\nThe player also needs to collect equipment to be used at the nightclub. The needed equipment is attached to a &lt;a href=\"Festival%20Bus\"&gt;Festival Bus&lt;/a&gt; being used at a &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20Sacrifice\"&gt;Ritual Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt; wind-down party in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Senora%20Desert\"&gt;Grand Senora Desert&lt;/a&gt; and the player will need to steal the bus and deliver it to the nightclub warehouse entrance. Tony requests that the player do it without killing anyone.\nResident DJs.\nDJ recruitment is then required. Players are automatically sent to collect &lt;a href=\"Solomun\"&gt;Solomun&lt;/a&gt; after a short cut scene once the second setup job was completed.\nInteraction Menu.\nA new menu for Nightclub Management is added to the player's &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt; after purchasing a club.\nFeatures.\nOnce the setup is complete, the club will be fully operational and interactive.\nFront Entry.\nExterior.\nThe exterior of the club will show an entry corona at a doorway, manned by a bouncer. As the nightclub increases or decreases in popularity, the number of NPCs queuing outside will vary. It can be noted that if the dress code of the nightclub is changed then the exterior queue may reflect the change, unless multiple clubs for different players in the session are located at the same place. \nEntering another player's club presents the player with an access menu which will list all owners of that location in the current free-roam session.\nCashiers Desk.\nAn unnamed female is at the front desk. She is interactive to set the player entry restrictions, entry cost and dress code (these options are also available from the interaction menu). \nSecurity.\nThe head of security, Marcel, usually stands on the main stairwell down from the cashiers desk into the main club and will greet the player as \"boss\" but he is otherwise non-interactive.\nMain Club Floor.\nBar.\nThe main bar is straight ahead and is staffed by an unnamed female bartender. Drinks are free for the owner of the club, visitors pay. If the staff upgrade option is purchased, a second female bartender will be behind the bar.\nDance floor.\nThe main dance floor space with two circular slightly elevated platforms for the paid dancers (if hired). A stairway on the left leads up to the VIP area. The DJ stage and sound system is directly ahead. If the staff upgrade option is purchased, a bouncer will be standing at the back of the dance floor. \nDJ Stage.\nAn elevated stage area with sound and light equipment where the resident DJs perform. Access to the stage from the dance floor is on its left side and a further stairway leads up from the booth to the second level VIP area. To the right of the DJ stage a doorway leads to the restrooms.\nIf the player is not a member of the groups that have been allowed access, a bouncer will stop the player from accessing either stairway to the booth.\nRestrooms.\nUnisex restrooms with 4 cubicles, 6 wall mounted urinals opposite, or two large troughs depending on the style. A large mirror over the sinks.\nA restroom attendant, who is an &lt;a href=\"Epsilon%20Program%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Epsilonist&lt;/a&gt;, is stationed next to the condom vending machine and can be tipped $1 at a time. When tipped 577 times in a single session, the Epsilon Robes will be unlocked.\nA doorway to the right is guarded by a bouncer and leads to the elevator and rear garage entry. There is a service elevator in this corridor which can be used to access the basement levels. It does not go up to the office level.\nGarage Entry.\nExterior.\nA corona at the garage door will allow access by vehicle directly to the service entrance parking spot. If additional garage space is purchased, a menu will allow selection of the desired garage level.\nWhen entering through the garage on foot, options to enter the nightclub (the default parking space area) or access any of the garage or warehouse levels are provided.\nNightclub Service Entrance.\nA smaller garage area capable of storing one personal vehicle. Vehicles delivered in management missions will be parked in here but will become static props.\nA short wide stairway on the left leads directly up to the office space and this provides the quickest access to the office without needing to walk through multiple levels of nightclub floor.\nThe passage to the right leads to the service elevator providing access to the basement levels in into the club via the restrooms.\nIf the player is not a member of the groups that have been allowed access, the bouncer will stop the player from accessing this area from the foyer outside the restrooms.\nVIP Area.\nThe stairway from the main dance floor leads up to the VIP area of the club. \nBar.\nThe VIP bar staffed by head bartender, Connie. Expensive champagne can be purchased from this bar, as well as the cheaper fare offered in the downstairs bar. Even the owner must pay for the expensive bottles here. If the staff upgrade option is purchased, a second female bartender will be behind the bar.\nThe player can also enter the bar service area and serve free drinks to other players currently visiting their club themselves. The player will not serve drinks to NPCs though.\nVIP Lounge.\nA VIP lounge area is located to the left side and a balcony overlooks the main dance floor. The player can sit on the couch. Tony Prince can often be found in this area when he is not in the office space. Celebrities delivered to the club will be found here, dancing or drinking. There is a bottle of vodka or rum that can be consumed and there are &lt;a href=\"Drugs\"&gt;joints&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Smoking\"&gt;cigarettes&lt;/a&gt; (depending on the active Resident DJ) on two of the tables that can be smoked.\nIf the player is not a member of the groups that have been allowed access, they will be unable to cross the threshold into the lounge area from the upper floor, but can still access the VIP bar. If the staff upgrade is purchased, a bouncer will be stationed here to stop unauthorised access.\nOffice.\nAnother bouncer will be monitoring the door to the office space at the far end of the VIP lounge area. If the player is not a member of the groups that have been allowed access, he will stop the player from accessing either the office or the stairway down to the DJ booth.\nA small lobby leads to a circular room with two executive style desks in the center. One of these desks belongs to Tony, the other to the player. Tony's desk includes a small framed photograph of &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Fernando Lopez&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player's desk includes a management computer and trophies awarded as part of the nightclub will appear on this desk as they are earned. If the security upgrade is purchased, security camera monitors will be accessible from this desk.\nElevator.\nThe main elevator is accessible from this circular office space to lead down into the basement warehouse and garage levels. This elevator does not stop at the main club floor.\nSafe.\nEarnings from the club operations are added to a hidden safe in the wall opposite the player's desk. The player needs to open and collect from this safe weekly.\nGun Locker.\nA hidden gun locker will appear opposite Tony's desk, but only if the optional security upgrade is installed.\nBar.\nA self-service bar is located behind a privacy glass wall overlooking the top of the DJ Stage and dance floor.\nControls on the wall in the office allow the player to dim the lights of the private bar and activate the privacy glass between the bar and the dance floor.\nBed.\nA small sofa serves as a bed where the player can sleep. A &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Revolver\"&gt;Heavy Revolver&lt;/a&gt; can be found on the opposite side if the security upgrade is installed.\nWardrobe.\nThere is a fully-functional wardrobe next to the sofa in the corridor leading to the rear garage entrance.\nBasement.\nAccessed from the elevator or exterior garage entrance.\nDelivery Garage Level B1.\nA garage for the three nightclub delivery vehicles including a &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;Weaponized Vehicle Workshop&lt;/a&gt;. Personal vehicles cannot access this level or be stored here.\nA free &lt;a href=\"Speedo%20Custom\"&gt;Speedo Custom&lt;/a&gt; is automatically provided. The &lt;a href=\"Mule%20Custom\"&gt;Mule Custom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pounder%20Custom\"&gt;Pounder Custom&lt;/a&gt; will be stored here if purchased.\nDefault Warehouse Level B1.\nThe warehouse is on a shared level with the delivery vehicle garage. Yohan is based here and will usually be sitting at one of three computer terminals in one of the connected circular rooms. An &lt;a href=\"Assault%20SMG\"&gt;Assault SMG&lt;/a&gt; will also spawn here if the security upgrade is purchased. The central circular room has a management computer for the player. Warehouse goods will be stored in the adjoining circular rooms as they are produced.\nOptional Basement Levels B2-B4.\nIf purchased, up to three additional 10 car garage levels for personal vehicles can be accessed by the internal elevator and if purchased, the first three additional warehouse levels will be on these levels. Much like on Level B1, a weapon will spawn on the computer room desk if the security upgrade is purchased, with B2 spawning a &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Shotgun\"&gt;Pump Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;, B3 spawning an &lt;a href=\"Advanced%20Rifle\"&gt;Advanced Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, and B4 spawning a &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper\"&gt;Heavy Sniper&lt;/a&gt;.\nOptional Terrorbyte Garage and Basement Level B5.\nThe fourth additional warehouse level if purchased. Storage space for nightclub goods. Contains a third management computer. if the security upgrade is purchased, one SecuroServ guard will be stationed on this level, and a &lt;a href=\"Grenade%20Launcher\"&gt;Grenade Launcher&lt;/a&gt; will spawn on the computer room desk.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Terrorbyte\"&gt;Terrorbyte&lt;/a&gt; is purchased, it will be exclusively stored in another fully equipped garage area on this level, and can be upgraded/customized on-site. Some business resupply missions, such as special cargo, can be launched from the garage, but most features, such as the drone and client jobs, require the Terrorbyte to exit the garage first.\nActivities.\nDancing.\nThe player can begin dancing anywhere on the two main levels of the club. Dancing in the club to each DJ set &lt;a href=\"Awards\"&gt;awards&lt;/a&gt; the player with new achievements and trophies for their desk, as well as limited edition t-shirts. Dancing in an owned nightclub will increase popularity by 1% per minute if the popularity bar is under 50%. After reaching 50% in popularity, the bar will not increase if the player continues dancing.\nDancing on the dance floor level (including in the DJ booth) allows the player to activate a cinematic camera while dancing.\nAwards list.\nDance perfectly in a Nightclub, with no missed beats, for 5 minutes. (Must be continuous)\nDrinking.\nThe player can drink at any of the three bars or consume their own Pi\u00dfwasser from their inventory anywhere. There are also drinks sitting on tables throughout the club that the players can freely drink. \nFrom the self-serve bar, the player has a selection of whiskey or wine which use existing drinking mechanics, but an additional bottle of alcohol requires the player to step up to the table and to pour the shots first, before drinking. As the player becomes more intoxicated, the animation of pouring becomes noticeably more labored and messy.\nOrdering a single shot of &lt;a href=\"Macbeth\"&gt;Macbeth&lt;/a&gt; from either bar will cause the player to pass out instantly, but drinking anything else will require at least three rounds depending on the strength of the beverage of choice. Once the player passes out from drinking, they will awaken in a random location. New awards are available for repeatedly drinking oneself to oblivion. Passing out from the shot gives a very small chance of being awarded the &lt;a href=\"Kifflom%20T-Shirt\"&gt;Kifflom T-Shirt&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"UFO%20tattoo\"&gt;UFO tattoo&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen drinking from one of the bars, the bar staff will motion to refuse service when the player is already intoxicated, but owners will continue to be served until they pass out.\nAwards.\nGet Drunk in any nightclub.\nThe \"Club Drunk\" award counter does not require that the player pass out, but the T-Shirts do.\nManagement.\nPlayers manage their club from the computers in the office or basement levels. The player can also watch a livestream of the current DJ from their computer. \nThe Home screen gives a summary of the club status.\nNightclub Management.\nThis application shows the popularity of the nightclub, number of player visits, current clientele, current daily income, safe capacity, and celebrity appearances as statistics. The player can start a promotion mission using the 'Promote Club' button as well as view a graph of the daily income changes.\nIn order to increase and maintain the popularity of the nightclub, the player must undergo regular club management. As the player progresses through management missions, they will encounter various celebrities who will also give the club high popularity. There are various examples of club management which revolve around promoting the club and its DJs. This can be performed in any session type.\nResident DJ.\nThis application allows the player to manage which DJ will perform. A sample of the DJ mix can be played back.\nWhen a new DJ becomes available, the player can book them for $100,000 and undertake a mission to collect them. If the player wishes to revert to a previous DJ, a $10,000 fee is payable. Changing DJ for the first time will refill the popularity bar, while subsequent changes to previously used DJs will only increase the bar by 10%.\nWarehouse Management.\nAn application used for assigning the warehouse technician (and hiring more techs) to goods production which allows passive accrual of goods for additional profit. Up to five technicians can be hired and assigned to goods accumulation. The seven goods types are classified by the type of business and are only available if the player already owns the corresponding business.\nSell Goods.\nApplication used to sell goods produced by the warehouse techs. The goods can be sold by type, by special order or selling total inventory, depending on the capacity of the owned delivery vehicles.\nUpgrades.\nThe following upgrades are available for Nightclubs. It should be noted that if the player chooses to trade Nightclubs, all upgrades installed from the previous Nightclub will not be carried over to the new one. The upgrades are:\nPopularity and Rewards.\nCash.\nOnce set up, a Nightclub on its own will generate up to &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;50,000 cash every in-game day (48 minutes) as long as the player is in session and keeps popularity high through the management missions. As the popularity bar reduces, so does the payout. With the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online/Editions\"&gt;PS5 and Xbox Series X|S&lt;/a&gt; releases of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Nightclub increased from &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;10,000 to &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;50,000 cash every in-game day (48 minutes). This updated value was later added to the PC and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Editions\"&gt;Enhanced Edition&lt;/a&gt; versions.\nThe money is stored in the safe in the office to a maximum value of $250,000 and must be manually claimed at least weekly and banked by the player. When the safe is full (), Tony will message the player and start keeping excess funds for himself.\nThe safe capacity was $70,000 prior to update; afterwards, it was increased to $250,000. After the &lt;a href=\"Double%20Down%20Week\"&gt;Double Down Week&lt;/a&gt; event, it was decreased to $210,000 to avoid a bug where the cash disappeared upon pickup. The capacity was then re-raised to $250,000 with the launch of update.\nOther impacts.\nAs popularity lowers, other impacts will be seen in the club.\nLazlow Jones has at least eight different stations, four when the club exceeds 50% popularity and four when the club is unpopular:\nThe drinks available at the bars will become \"out of stock\", starting with the most expensive whisky and champagne at 60% and progressing until only Pi\u00dfwasser, vodka, The Mount and silver Bl\u00eauter'd are available at 0%.\nThe club will become emptier, starting with the VIP Lounge and then the VIP bar area, progressing to the public bar and eventually the dance floor.\nTony Prince will not change his activities or dialogue as popularity increases or decreases.\nStaff.\nYohan's dialogue indicates he finds Connie attractive, but Connie tells the player that she thinks he is a creep. Yohan and the other warehouse staff will remark about their isolation in the basement when visited; some may also recommend the player purchase certain businesses.\n&lt;br&gt;\nAfter update, Yohan can be called to start a &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs/Steal%20Goods\"&gt;Nightclub resupply&lt;/a&gt; mission.\nCelebrities.\nOccasionally, as one of the night club management missions, Lazlow will require the player to pick up &lt;a href=\"Wave%20of%20Celebrity%20in%20the%20HD%20Universe\"&gt;celebrities&lt;/a&gt; and drop them off at the club. Once picked up, these celebrities can be found dancing in the nightclub's VIP area. It is possible to have multiple celebrities in the VIP area at one time.\nCelebrities include:\nLazlow will also task the player with collecting local unnamed VIPs for the VIP area, however these NPCs will not appear in the VIP room after they are delivered to the club.\nEnglish Dave may also task the player with bringing friends of the resident DJ into the club, but like the VIPs, these NPCs will not be seen anywhere after they are delivered."}

If the camera detects the player in its vision, the police will converge on the apartment after the player exits. When the laptop is located, the player simply inserts a storage drive into the laptop, waits for the virus to upload, and exits the apartment, still being cautious of the camera's view.\nAfter exiting the apartment, Tony informs the player that the paparazzo is attempting a deal of the original photograph to a buyer, and requests that they take out the paparazzo, steal his camera, and return it back to the Nightclub. \nLazlow Jones: Promote Club Jobs.\nCollect VIPs.\nThe player is directed by &lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Lazlow Jones&lt;/a&gt; to collect 2 VIPs from separate locations and deliver them to the club.

Unlike celebrities, the NPC VIPs will not be visible inside the VIP lounge area of the club immediately after they are delivered.\nLocate celebrity.\nLazlow has a lead on a celebrity to bring to the club, but doesn't know exactly where they are. He will send &lt;a href=\"snapmatic\"&gt;snapmatic&lt;/a&gt; images by text to the player's phone and the player must use Tony's &lt;a href=\"Patriot%20Stretch\"&gt;Patriot Stretch&lt;/a&gt; to go to the location.

At the second location the scenario repeats and the player will find the celebrity waiting at the third location.\nUpon completion, the popularity of the club will increase and the player will be rewarded with up to $5,000 and up to 800 RP.

The player must hijack the transporter with the celebrity in the back. They must then lose their 2 star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; before taking the celebrity to the club. Killing the cops on the scene will still only invoke a 2-star wanted level.

The player has the choice to accept or reject these jobs. There are no time limits on these jobs. They often trigger if a player starts a new session while registered as a CEO, VIP or Motorcycle Club President. English Dave continues to assign these tasks even after he \"permanently\" relocates to the &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico%20Beach%20Party\"&gt;Cayo Perico Beach Party&lt;/a&gt;. Once each of these jobs is successfully completed, it will never trigger again.\nSteal equipment.\n&lt;a href=\"English%20Dave\"&gt;English Dave&lt;/a&gt; calls stating that the club DJ is unhappy with the club atmosphere and needs new equipment. This mission requires the acquisition and return of a &lt;a href=\"Speedo\"&gt;vehicle&lt;/a&gt; loaded with musical equipment. There may be security that needs to be dealt with at the location of the van.\nOn the way back to the club, teams of &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt; guards will pursue in &lt;a href=\"Dilettante\"&gt;Dilettante&lt;/a&gt;s.\nUpon completion, the popularity of the club will increase. \nCollect friends.\n&lt;a href=\"English%20Dave\"&gt;English Dave&lt;/a&gt; calls stating the DJ wants their friends brought to the club. The player is required to collect a &lt;a href=\"Volatus\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; and pick up the three NPCs and return to the club. However, one of the NPCs is afraid of heights, so the player is required to maintain an altitude of under 250 ft on the return journey.\nUpon completion, the popularity of the club will increase. Like the VIPs, the NPC friends will not be seen in the club after they are delivered.\nRecover the vinyl.\n&lt;a href=\"English%20Dave\"&gt;English Dave&lt;/a&gt; calls stating that the club DJ has had their vinyl records stolen and they are being used in a private party aboard the &lt;a href=\"Dignity\"&gt;Dignity&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player travels from their current location to a beach where two &lt;a href=\"Seashark\"&gt;Seashark&lt;/a&gt;s are waiting. The player needs to storm the yacht and recover the case of records and return to their club. Opponents armed with knives and pistols will provide resistance.\nA &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Sparrow\"&gt;Sea Sparrow&lt;/a&gt; will be parked next to the yacht to make the return trip a little faster.\nUpon completion, the popularity of the club will increase.\nRescue the friends.\n&lt;a href=\"English%20Dave\"&gt;English Dave&lt;/a&gt; calls stating that the club DJ's friends have been kidnapped.

Enemy gang members may give chase on the return trip.\nUpon completion, the popularity of the club will increase. Like the VIPs, the NPC friends will not be seen in the club after they are delivered.\nMarcel: Nightclub Security Jobs.\n&lt;br&gt;\nTwo jobs tasked by the Nightclub's lead bouncer &lt;a href=\"Marcel\"&gt;Marcel&lt;/a&gt; were added with update. While inside the Nightclub, Marcel will occasionally text the player regarding Nightclub Security Jobs that he requires assistance with. \nIn order for Marcel's Nightclub Security Jobs to trigger, the Nightclub must not be at 0% popularity, and the jobs will not trigger until the player leaves the garage area, either approaching their office or the public spaces. Once the player receives Marcel's text, there will a cooldown timer of 48 minutes (1 in-game day) before the next job can occur. Successfully completing the job, failing the job, or ignoring the job by leaving the Nightclub will not affect the timer. It is possible to change the currently active Nightclub Security Job by heading down to the Nightclub basement via the elevator and back to the main floor, upon which another job will trigger.\nThe cooldown of the Nightclub Security Jobs is independent from the Nightclub Management Missions cooldown timer. They can occur even when the Management Missions timer is active, and do not add to the timer upon completion. The player does not need to be registered as a &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;MC President&lt;/a&gt; to trigger these jobs.\nDeliver VIP.\nThe player can find a VIP patron passed out somewhere in the Nightclub, such as the VIP lounge, in a storage passageway leading behind the upstairs bar, or on the bed behind the player's office. A blue friendly icon marks their location on the interior map. Interacting with the VIP loads them into a Nightclub Limo with the VIP laying down on the back seat, and starts the mission.\nThe player is spawned outside the Nightclub in a Nightclub Limo vehicle and tasked with delivering the VIP to a destination within a ten-minute time limit. Driving too fast (70 mph or above) or crashing increases the \"VIP spooked\" bar. If the bar is completely filled, the VIP will jump out of the limo and run away. The limo engine will catch fire and eventually break down.\nThe VIP will either need to be taken home or to a hospital, or occasionally to &lt;a href=\"Parsons%20Rehabilitation%20Center\"&gt;Parsons Rehabilitation Center&lt;/a&gt;. The drop-off locations are randomly chosen, with the hospital destination being as far away as &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the mission, the limo remains available to the player (unlike other nightclub delivery missions) and is designated with a yellow icon, though it cannot be modified or kept as a personal vehicle.\nEject troublemaker.\nThe player can find a problematic patron somewhere in the Nightclub, such as the loading bay, the restroom, off the dance floor, or at the lower bar. A blue blip appears on the minimap to indicate the location of the mission which the player can interact with to begin. Interacting with the troublemaker starts an animation of the player cracking their knuckles, followed by a short cutscene of the player and Marcel ejecting the troublemaker from the premises, completing the mission. This is the only club management mission that does not require leaving the nightclub.\nRewards.\nAs well as the tangible rewards obtained in each mission of money, RP, popularity, and increases to the celebrity appearances statistic, a \"Number One Nightclub\" \"Hotspot\" reward trophy will appear on Tony's desk after a 90% popularity level is maintained for the required duration. While the accumulated time does not have to be in a single session, the time for one's popularity will be reset if the player leaves freemode in order to perform missions outside of it."}

The player must recover the property from the street punks and return it back to the nightclub. There will be six targets scattering away from the club location and a single player will need to recover property from three of them and return them individually to the nightclub garage to pass the mission.\nIf the player fails the mission, the &lt;a href=\"Nightclub%20Management\"&gt;nightclub's popularity&lt;/a&gt; will decrease.\nUpon completion, if the player has not applied a security upgrade to their club, Lazlow will suggest they do so.\nNightclub Warehouse Raids.\nWhen having at least 20% of stock capacity in the Nightclub's warehouse, &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt; can call the player to tell them that &lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; are raiding the &lt;a href=\"nightclubs\"&gt;nightclub&lt;/a&gt;.

Owning a second storage floor doubles the minimum amount of stock that the player needs to have before the warehouse can get raided by the &lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt;; from 20% to 40%."}

From July 24 to July 31 2018, &lt;a href=\"Solomun\"&gt;Solomun&lt;/a&gt; was the only DJ available. Players are automatically sent to collect Solomun after a short cutscene once the second nightclub setup job is complete.\nAfter completing all of the setup, access is provided to the management computers in the office and warehouse levels.\nAfter the first week, multiple DJs became available, so the player could choose which DJs to recruit using the management application. They may also receive a call from &lt;a href=\"English%20Dave\"&gt;English Dave&lt;/a&gt; telling them about new DJs and allowing them to recruit the DJs on the spot if desired.\nOnce DJs are recruited, the app allows the player to manage them.

The pilot passes out just as the plane is approaching and Solomun takes the controls and crash-lands at &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Sandy Shores Airfield&lt;/a&gt; while the player chases the jet.\nThe player then drives back to the nightclub with Solomun and Dave.\nOther members of the player's &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organizations&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Clubs&lt;/a&gt; can assist by following the jet but can not drive the car. They can provide protection on the way back to the club from rival players who can not even see the jet but will be able to intercept the player on the return journey to the club for increased popularity of their own clubs if they prevent the delivery of the DJ.\nTale of Us.\nEnglish Dave says &lt;a href=\"Tale%20Of%20Us\"&gt;Tale Of Us&lt;/a&gt; have a contract rider (additional details added to a contract) which dictates they need to be picked up in an &lt;a href=\"Enus\"&gt;Enus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stafford\"&gt;Stafford&lt;/a&gt; which will have to be stolen off the back of a transporter trailer.\nIf the player owns a Stafford, it cannot be used to pick up Tale of Us at LSIA, the mission requires the player to steal it off the transporter.\nThe player shoots the lower hinges of the transporter to release firstly a &lt;a href=\"Vapid\"&gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Flash%20GT\"&gt;Flash GT&lt;/a&gt; and then the upper hinges at the sides to release a &lt;a href=\"RUNE\"&gt;RUNE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cheburek\"&gt;Cheburek&lt;/a&gt; before the Stafford falls safely to the road and can be stolen. The transporter is indestructible and the driver cannot be shot so it will continue doing a loop of the map until the player shoots out the hinges or an unseen time limit of 30 minutes expires. Other rival and associate players can see the transporter at all times but it is indestructible to them too. It is possible to cause the truck to jack-knife and detach the trailer, making the hinges an easy static target. Three shots from a &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt; are sufficient to take out each hinge. Once the Stafford is retrieved, the transporter loses its indestructibility.\nThe player must then evade any &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; before travelling to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSIA&lt;/a&gt; where Dave is waiting and they can collect the DJs and deliver them to their club. Rival players can then intercept the Stafford and prevent delivery of the DJs to increase the popularity of their own clubs.\nCarmine and Matteo are impressed with the car, but on the way back they note that a &lt;a href=\"Stretch\"&gt;limo&lt;/a&gt; or something would have been just fine. It is revealed that the rider Dave was working from (a Stafford, two gallons of mezcal, and a swimming pool of rubber duckies) was not valid, and all they asked for was their mixer and preferred drinks from the bar. Dave realizes it must have been &lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones\"&gt;Lazlow Jones&lt;/a&gt;' personal list that he somehow snuck into the contract.\nDixon.\nEnglish Dave says that he is meeting up with &lt;a href=\"Dixon\"&gt;Dixon&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"The%20Richman%20Hotel\"&gt;The Richman Hotel&lt;/a&gt; and asks the player to pick them up from there using &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Schafter%20V12\"&gt;Schafter V12&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon arrival, Dave is agitated but before he can explain, Dixon walks out of the hotel. Dave acts like nothing is wrong and asks Dixon to hang back, as if needing to discuss business privately with the Protagonist. Dave reveals that while watching the DJ's belongings, he stepped into the bathroom for a hit of cocaine and someone stole Dixon's backpack. Luckily, the apparent thief hurries past right then with the backpack to join his accomplice, who's waiting on a motorcycle. While Dave keeps the unaware Dixon occupied, the player must chase after and take out the thief. The player does not have to use the Tony's car for the chase. Once the thief is killed, the bag can be picked up and returned to the hotel where Dave is waiting with the DJ and the player can then drive them to the club in Tony's car, at which point Rival players can intercept them and take out the DJ for increased popularity of their own club.\nOn the way back to the club, Dave and Dixon bond over a shared love of football and discuss the &lt;a href=\"LS%20Benders\"&gt;LS Benders&lt;/a&gt; football team.\nThe Black Madonna.\nEnglish Dave explains that &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Madonna\"&gt;The Black Madonna&lt;/a&gt; is prone to \"spontaneous acts of generosity\" and is throwing a free rave in an underprivileged area and the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; have raided it. The player must travel from their nightclub to &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Del%20Sol\"&gt;Puerto Del Sol&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Helipad\"&gt;helipad&lt;/a&gt; where Dave is waiting with a &lt;a href=\"Jetsam\"&gt;Jetsam&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt;. The player flies to the location of the rave with Dave and finds Marea being loaded into the back of a squad car. The player airlifts the car containing the DJ and a single LSPD officer away from the scene and loses their &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; and returns to the helipad. Upon landing, the LSPD officer attempts to arrest them but Marea knocks him out with a single punch and the trio return to the club."}

The seven goods types are classified by the type of business and are only available if the player already owns that corresponding CEO, Motorcycle Club, or Gunrunning illicit business.\nThe Sell Goods application allows the player to embark on a selection of sell jobs to dispose of these crates for profit. &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt; takes a 10% cut up to a maximum of $100,000 as a money laundering fee.\nSales Options.\nThe amount of goods a player can store depends on the storage options purchased with their club. By default, only one warehouse level is provided.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online/Editions\"&gt;PS5 and Xbox Series X|S&lt;/a&gt; releases of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", Goods related to &lt;a href=\"The%20Open%20Road\"&gt;Motorcycle Club Businesses&lt;/a&gt;, such as Cash Creation and Organic Produce, pay 35% more from their original value. The &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Title%20Update%20Notes/Update-2022-04-26\"&gt;1.59&lt;/a&gt; update on April 26, &lt;a href=\"2022\"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt; later added this updated value to the PC and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Editions\"&gt;Enhanced Edition&lt;/a&gt; versions.\nThe player is required to use the default &lt;a href=\"Speedo%20Custom\"&gt;Speedo Custom&lt;/a&gt; or purchase a &lt;a href=\"Mule%20Custom\"&gt;Mule Custom&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Pounder%20Custom\"&gt;Pounder Custom&lt;/a&gt; to deliver the goods. Each vehicle is capable of carrying a fixed volume of crates. \nSell Crates.\nThe player can select each type of goods individually and sell only those goods.\nSell All Goods.\nThe player can select this option to sell all stock of all types in one shipment, provided they have the vehicular capacity available. If the total crates exceeds the capacity of the available delivery vehicles, the sale will not proceed.\nSell: Special Orders.\nAt any time, the application will provide three Special Orders, each comprising of combinations of three different goods types of varying quantities. The player can make these shipments which will attract a 5% premium on the sale price for the first listed offer, and a 10% premium on the other two. This, combined with Tony's laundering fee, will result in a loss of only 5.5% for selling the first Special Order, and a 1% for selling any of the other two.\nEach Special Order has a designation to a buyer's business. The possible buyer businesses include: \nThere is a 2.5% bonus applied for each other player in the lobby that is not in the seller's organization; this bonus is calculated from the total after Tony's take. Prior to update, this bonus was 1% per player.\nSell Goods Jobs.\nOnce the Nightclub owner decides to sell their goods, a random mission is triggered and the objective is to bring the delivery vehicle to its destination(s).\nSome of the missions will involve enemy groups, which may be &lt;a href=\"Kkangpae\"&gt;Kkangpae&lt;/a&gt; gang members, &lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Cartel\"&gt;Madrazo Cartel&lt;/a&gt; goons, &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; members, or &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt; operatives. &lt;a href=\"Rednecks%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Rednecks&lt;/a&gt; will also be a possible enemy group if the sell mission occurs in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are ten different missions:\nSingle Drop.\nThe mission is very straightforward. The player is instructed to drive to a single drop location to complete the sale. However, &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony&lt;/a&gt; will inform of possible enemies on the way.\nAs soon as the player starts driving away from their Nightclub, enemies (in three waves of two vehicles) will spawn in an attempt to take them out and/or destroy the vehicle.\nSplit Drops.\nThis mission is similar to the previous one, but the player has to drive to five random locations, which can be completed in any order. However, after completing the second drop, two enemy vehicles will start chasing the player.\nHigh Risk Trade.\nThis mission is somewhat similar to the previous one, only that it has less drop-off points at the cost of more enemy forces.\nAfter completing the first drop, two enemy vehicles will chase the player until they are lost or taken out; two more vehicles give chase after the second drop. When approaching the third and last drop, a roadblock will be set up, composed of several enemies and their corresponding vehicles to stop the player's delivery vehicle. Once they are taken out, the player can simply drive to the drop-off location to complete the sale.\nOffshore Barge Drop.\nThe player is instructed to drive to the location of a &lt;a href=\"Jetsam\"&gt;Jetsam&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; and airlift it to a &lt;a href=\"Lando-Corp\"&gt;Lando-Corp&lt;/a&gt; dredge &lt;a href=\"barge\"&gt;barge&lt;/a&gt; off the coast, onto which they need to carefully drop the delivery vehicle and leave the area to complete the mission.\nChopper Tail.\nThe player is instructed to go to a meeting point where the buyer's associates will be above in a &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;Frogger&lt;/a&gt; helicopter. The player has to use a &lt;a href=\"Flare%20Gun\"&gt;Flare Gun&lt;/a&gt; to signal them (if they do not have the weapon, they are provided with one), then follow the helicopter to the destination. The chopper will stop if the player is too far away, but will continue to its route when they catch up.\nOnce they arrive to the location, the chopper will drop a &lt;a href=\"flare\"&gt;flare&lt;/a&gt; to mark the drop-off location. The player has to then park the vehicle there to complete the sale.If the helicopter is spooked or destroyed by the player or rivals, Tony will send a text and inform the player that they can use &lt;a href=\"Trackify\"&gt;Trackify&lt;/a&gt; to find it\nSightseer.\nThis mission is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Sightseer\"&gt;Sightseer&lt;/a&gt; VIP/CEO work, where the player has to use the &lt;a href=\"Sightseer%20%28app%29\"&gt;Sightseer&lt;/a&gt; app to reveal the drop-off locations. No enemies will spawn during this mission.\nBuyer Associate Protection.\nThis mission is similar to the high-risk trade mission. The player is instructed to drive to the first location and drop the crate. Merryweather will spawn to intercept the player in two &lt;a href=\"Mesa%20Grande\"&gt;Mesa&lt;/a&gt; SUVs, so they have to be careful on the way to the second drop.\nAfter delivering the second crate, Tony will inform the players that the buyer's associate is in trouble, so they have to get there while avoiding more Merryweather Mesas. After managing to reach the third location, the player has to defend the buyer's associate from three waves of incoming Merryweather forces, which will spawn in two vehicles, each one carrying the driver and a passenger.\nFailing to protect the buyer's associate cut the payment by 100k or about 10% (On top of the Tony's 10% cut).\nAfter failing or succeeding in protecting the buyer's associate, the player is instructed to leave the area to complete the mission.\nSearch for the Buyer.\nThis mission is largely similar to the single drop mission. However, the buyer's location is unknown, so they have to find an orange &lt;a href=\"Kamacho\"&gt;Kamacho&lt;/a&gt; within a large marked area, similar to &lt;a href=\"Executive%20Search\"&gt;Executive Search&lt;/a&gt;. Once the Kamacho is found or 2 minutes passed since the player entered the search area, the player has to park the delivery vehicle and leave the area to complete the mission.\nUndamaged Shipment Bonus.\nThis mission works identical to the high-risk trade mission, but no enemies will spawn. However, Tony informs that the buyer will be very minutious with the delivery vehicle and wants it to be delivered with no damage. A $10,000 bonus will be set, which will be reduced with damage. The same bonus will be added to the sell value once the player brings the vehicle to the final drop. With no enemies, the challenge is to avoid running into NPC traffic or being damaged by other players.\nPolice Ambush.\nThe player is instructed to drive to a single drop-off location to deliver the goods. However, it turns out to be an ambush operation, with two &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Cruiser\"&gt;Unmarked Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s attempting to intercept the player and triggering a two-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; or four-star wanted level if the Unmarked Cruisers are attacked.\nOnce the player manages to lose the wanted level, an alternate drop-off location will be revealed, so they are safe to deliver the goods with no trouble. The player may then proceed safely to the marked location without hassle.\n&lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt;'s remove wanted level service may be used to remove the wanted level, however either by glitch or by design, the unmarked cruisers and other police vehicles may continue to pursue/shoot at the player, even though there is no wanted level. Fighting back or allowing one of the vehicles to collide with the delivery vehicle will result in a four-star wanted level.\nThis variant starts off using the same dialogue and scenario as the Single Drop variant, but can be easily distinguished by the fact that no enemy forces will spawn to attack the player on their way to the initial drop-off location and the player getting 20 minutes instead of 10."}

They were added in update and can be triggered by calling &lt;a href=\"Yohan%20Blair\"&gt;Yohan Blair&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nSimilar to &lt;a href=\"Business%20Battles\"&gt;Business Battles&lt;/a&gt;, each mission will be for a randomly selected Goods type, which will be indicated by Yohan's introductory phone call. Any Goods type can be selected as long as it is not currently fully stocked at the player's Nightclub Warehouse. \nUpon success or failure of a Steal Warehouse Goods mission, there is a 20-minute cooldown timer before another can be started. The player does not need to be registered as a &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;CEO/VIP&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;MC President&lt;/a&gt; to trigger these missions. There is no PvP element to these missions. Rival players cannot compete for the goods, although they can see the events taking place and interact with the enemy targets and even destroy the goods.\nMission Types.\nTugboat.\nDescription.\nYohan informs the player of a currently docked &lt;a href=\"Tug%20%28boat%29\"&gt;Tug boat&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Port of Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; holding a shipment of Goods. The player is tasked with retrieving the Goods from aboard the Tug and returning them back to the Nightclub. Yohan claims that there will be minimal resistance.\nThe Tug is guarded by an enemy gang that will open fire once the player approaches. The Goods crate is located within the bridge cabin of the Tug, and the player must climb aboard the Tug to retrieve it. To aid the player, there ia a breakable &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt; crate containing &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Body Armor&lt;/a&gt; amongst the enemy forces on the dockside, and two further breakable crates on the Tug containing a &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;Health Pack&lt;/a&gt; and an ammo pack (12 rounds of &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt; ammo) respectively.\nDestroying the Tug will not destroy the Goods crate, but it will sink along with the Tug, forcing the player to dive underwater to retrieve it.\nOnce retrieved, enemy reinforcements will pursue the player in three waves (two vehicles with two occupants each). The mission ends once the player successfully delivers the Goods to the Nightclub Garage.\nRemovals Truck.\nDescription.\nThe player has to stop and steal a &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; containing cargo and bring it back to the nightclub. \nIf the Benson is not stopped, it will travel to a random gang location where the occupants will get out. The player can then assault the gang and steal the truck.\nAfter getting in the truck, or arriving at its destination, three waves of enemy gang reinforcements (two vehicles with two occupants each) will arrive to chase the player on the way back to their club.\nRewards.\nUnlike Business Battles, which only give one unit of the selected Goods type per crate delivered, completing a Steal Nightclub Goods mission rewards the player with a specific number of units depending on the Goods type:\nThe reward amounts are consistent and are not affected by the player's performance in the mission. If the amount rewarded were to push the player's stock of that Goods type beyond the maximum, the excess units will be forfeit. Steal Warehouse Goods missions are therefore unable to be started if the player has all Goods types fully stocked."}

The seven goods types are classified by the type of business and are only available if the player already owns the corresponding business.\nIf a player does not already own the required business, the warehouse goods will be locked.\nInitially, one staff member, &lt;a href=\"Yohan\"&gt;Yohan&lt;/a&gt;, is available to allocate to any one of the seven possible goods types. Four more technicians can be hired and assigned to goods accumulation allowing for up to five of the seven possible goods types to be accrued simultaneously. Only one tech can be assigned to each goods type so the player should only hire techs for the number of business they own. Further technicians can be hired for:\nPlayers can reassign their tech to other goods types at any time, so a single tech can still produce a full warehouse over a long period of time.\nProduction and storage.\nOnce a technician is allocated to a category of goods, they will accrue those goods automatically with no further input from the player. Unlike running those businesses themselves, no supplies will need to be sourced or purchased.\nAll functionality is available in every session type (online, invite-only, etc.) as of update.\nDepending on the upgrades purchased with the club, the amount of crates of goods that can be held in stock and the rate of production will vary. The club comes with one warehouse floor by default and each subsequent floor doubles that storage capacity. The equipment upgrade option doubles the production rates for each of the goods.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online/Editions\"&gt;PS5 and Xbox Series X|S&lt;/a&gt; releases of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", Goods related to &lt;a href=\"The%20Open%20Road\"&gt;Motorcycle Club Businesses&lt;/a&gt;, such as Cash Creation and Organic Produce, pay 35% more from their original value.

This stock is not restricted to the types of businesses the player owns, enabling them to acquire goods they cannot otherwise produce themselves.\nStash Houses.\nSuccessfully raiding a Stash House can also re-supply random club warehouse stock.\nStealing Goods.\nAdded in update, the player can call Yohan to start a &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs/Steal%20Goods\"&gt;Nightclub Goods steal mission&lt;/a&gt;. Much like Business Battles, this enables players to stock up on goods they do not own the business to produce themselves.\nSelling goods.\nSell goods produced by the warehouse techs. The goods can be sold by type, by special order or selling total inventory.\nStreet Dealers.\nSmall amounts of warehouse drug supplies (South American Imports, Pharmaceuticals and Organic Produce) can be sold direct to Street Dealers."}

Its acceleration is above average and easily outclasses other vehicles of its size such as the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Barracks\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt;. Top speed is acceptable, at around 100 miles per hour before redlining. Braking, however, leaves much to be desired, as it is slow to come to a complete stop but is manageable if caution is used.\nDue to the vehicle's incredibly long wheelbase, it struggles a bit when navigating streets or the arena and tends to suffer from understeer and when accelerating, fishtailing. Furthermore, it can be pushed off quite easily by other, heavier vehicles, often resulting it in being rolled over, in addition to driving through steep slopes that can also result in it rolling over.\nDespite the Bruiser having a front differential and a transfer case visible, it does not have AWD characteristics. This makes it very tough to climb steep hills. Even on flat rough terrain, it struggles to sort small obstacles like barriers or rocks, due to its front bumper having extremely low clearance. The rear end, on the other part, has no obstruction, allowing to sort these obstacles easily.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Glendale%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Glendale&lt;/a&gt; and the other Bruisers, the vehicle is powered by the same engine fitted to the &lt;a href=\"Regina\"&gt;Regina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt;, being a single-overhead camshaft V8 fitted with a cylindrical air filter. Said engine is coupled to a 5-speed gearbox and powers the four rear wheels. Its sound is also smoother and mid-revving, similar to the one used on vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Ramp%20Buggy\"&gt;Ramp Buggy&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dune%20FAV\"&gt;Dune FAV&lt;/a&gt;.\nIts traction can be slightly increased with any \"Spoiler\" modification, even though they are not technically spoilers.\nArmor.\nThe Bruiser excels in an enforcer. Due to its large size and optional ram modification, it is capable of pushing all but the largest vehicles out of its way with no effort. Only large vehicles like &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Utility%20Truck\"&gt;Utility Truck&lt;/a&gt;s will not be pushed out of the way and will slow the Bruiser down. Furthermore, owing to its large, exposed wheels, they are vulnerable to gunfire or being pierced by spike strips if not fitted with bulletproof tires; the tires can cause the wheels to camber if burst, which greatly affects its handling.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nDual .50 Cal=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Nightmare Bruiser can be modified at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beeker%27s%20Garage\"&gt;Beeker's Garage&lt;/a&gt;, although special upgrades are only available at the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Workshop\"&gt;Arena Workshop&lt;/a&gt;."}

The rims are similar to the ones from its two other variants and many industrial vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Packer\"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt;, with the original black hole texture removed (although the original \"normal\" texture is still present, leaving the appearance of a hole-like area on the wheel). These rims can also support a dedicated color, although purchased examples have a yellow color by default, which cannot be changed due to the lack of custom wheels options.\nThe truck is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with a front flamethrower, and can be also modified with a rear flamethrower.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nAs expected from a large truck of its kind, the Cerberus is relatively slow but remains powerful and a definite successor to the likes of the Phantom, particularly when it comes to ramming vehicles out of the way.\nThe vehicle's straight-line performance is, overall, relatively poor. The truck also has a limited number of only 3 gears when compared to other trucks often featuring 5.\nThe Cerberus' engine model is identical to the Phantom and Packer, being a relatively undetailed model which appears to replicate a V8 engine, suggested by its spark plug textures, however with no physical manifolds or cam-heads, the engine model is otherwise unidentifiable. The truck's engine sound is also shared with the &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Custom\"&gt;Phantom Custom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hauler%20Custom\"&gt;Hauler Custom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chernobog\"&gt;Chernobog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scarab\"&gt;Scarab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"TM-02%20Khanjali\"&gt;TM-02 Khanjali&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor.\nThe Cerberus' durability is, by default, relatively substandard and is on-par with the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;, among other trucks of a similar size. A single explosion nearby may burst the truck into flames, however, somewhat advantageously, the truck's length in comparison to other trucks means explosions to the rear are much less likely to deal damage to the vehicle's fuel tanks, positioned below the cab, and the engine located at the front, however explosions at or around the frontal area will still cause immediate damage. With Armor Plating, the truck's durability is significantly improved, surviving up to 2 explosions. The truck does not deform.\nThe truck comes with a bullet-resistant front windshield, surviving several rounds from a machine gun before breaking, however the side windows are not.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nFlamethrower=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Nightmare Cerberus can only be modified at the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Workshop\"&gt;Arena Workshop&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, this issue can be reduced with the Heavy Armor upgrade installed, as it adds armour plating around the vehicle, having the windshield partially protected by metal bars and the sides with window plating with a small weak spot. The rear remains unarmoured in that aspect, due to the rear louvres on it. Depending on the armour level, it can take at least three missiles from an &lt;a href=\"Oppressor\"&gt;Oppressor&lt;/a&gt; before being destroyed by a fourth, making it one of the more decent weaponized vehicles due to its balance between weapons, abilities and durability.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nDual .50 Cal=\nKinetic Mortar=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Nightmare Imperator can be modified at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, although special upgrades are only available at the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Workshop\"&gt;Arena Workshop&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, it has a higher top speed and higher suspension, but the increased weight means it has a rather lower acceleration. The high suspension allows the car to sort out obstacles better than the stock version, but because of the RWD layout, it struggles to climb steep hills in comparison to dedicated off-road vehicles.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Arena%20War\"&gt;Arena War&lt;/a&gt; modes, the Issi is generally inferior to most Arena contenders due to its size, being easily pushed away by heavier vehicles. However, it works better on modes such as &lt;a href=\"Flag%20War\"&gt;Flag War&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Games%20Masters\"&gt;Games Masters&lt;/a&gt;, as it can squeeze through narrow areas where most cars cannot.

Braking is also very good for a vehicle of this size, only taking a few seconds to come to a complete stop. However, the relatively light mass makes it unable to push other vehicles out of the way without slowing down like the &lt;a href=\"Bruiser\"&gt;Bruiser&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt;, and attempting to run over smaller vehicles at higher speeds will often launch itself up in the air and topple over haphazardly and juggle around, which can make recovery a challenge. Installing a ram weapon may reduce chances of rollovers, but may affect the way it handles bumpy roads and obstacles on the front.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Arena%20War\"&gt;Arena War&lt;/a&gt; modes, the Sasquatch can be an easy target due to its large size, and the slow speed and handling may render it easily outmaneuvered by vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"ZR380\"&gt;ZR380&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Deathbike\"&gt;Deathbike&lt;/a&gt;. However, it can be a serious threat due to its large wheels; any smaller vehicle stuck between the two wheels of a side may be either instantly destroyed or severely damaged, being an ideal choice for modes such as &lt;a href=\"Carnage\"&gt;Carnage&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Tag%20Team\"&gt;Tag Team&lt;/a&gt;, but caution should be taken for any &lt;a href=\"Drones\"&gt;drone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"RC%20Bandito\"&gt;RC Bandito&lt;/a&gt; or guided missile used by spectators.\nLike the Liberator and the Marshall, the Sasquatch uses a high-power V8 engine, coupled to a 3-speed gearbox in a mid-engine, all wheel drive layout. It also shares the same loud engine sound from the aforementioned monster trucks.\nLike other Arena vehicles, it can withstand a single explosive without being destroyed. However, the cabin leaves no protection for the occupants and the engine is partially exposed on the rear, rendering them vulnerable to gunfire. This issue can be mitigated with the addition of armor upgrades, as it installs a grilled defense for the windows and large metal plates behind the cabin and over the engine bay. The side windows, however, leave no protection at all.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Nightmare Sasquatch can only be modified at the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Workshop\"&gt;Arena Workshop&lt;/a&gt;."}

The track wheels (sprocket, idler and road wheels) are painted with a dedicated wheel color. The vehicle also has permanent colors applied to random parts; the upper track panels are colored green, blue and pink (from front to rear). The rear bed has a purple-colored durbar floor and the sections below the seats are painted in blue.\nThe vehicle can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with a top-mounted machine gun on the roof, which resembles a .\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Scarab accelerates fairly quick compared to other tracked vehicles and possess above average handling, as well as extremely good braking capabilities. The Scarab's biggest weakness, however, is its mediocre top speed; even with boost, it is unable to pass 75 miles an hour. While having good suspension, scoop upgrades may hinder its capabilities.\nAlthough it is not heavy enough to crush cars like the &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino Tank&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"TM-02%20Khanjali\"&gt;TM-02 Khanjali&lt;/a&gt;, the Scarab can still pose a threat towards anyone. The vehicle can push away vehicles with ease and is difficult to be pushed by other light cars, making it an excellent choice for transportation around the map.\nThe vehicle is powered by a diesel engine located around the middle section, given the location of the vents. It shares the same engine sound with vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Custom\"&gt;Phantom Custom&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hauler%20Custom\"&gt;Hauler Custom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Chernobog\"&gt;Chernobog&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor.\nCompared to other Arena vehicles, the Scarab excels in armor resistance, able to take up to six rockets before being destroyed. However, its windshield is pretty large, leaving the front occupants vulnerable to gunfire, with little to no protection for the rear passengers. These issues can be solved with the addition of the Full Armor plate, which leaves a smaller weak spot on the windshield, and the Plated Cage upgrade, which covers most of the rear bed while allowing the rear passenger to shoot at any enemy behind the vehicle.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Nightmare Scarab can be modified at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, although special upgrades are only available at the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Workshop\"&gt;Arena Workshop&lt;/a&gt;."}

The rims can also support a dedicated color, although converted examples have a yellow color by default, which cannot be changed due to the lack of custom wheels options. The car also has permanent colors applied to random parts, which are the following;\nThe vehicle can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with two side-mounted machine guns in place of the fenders, which resemble either or short-barreled machine guns.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe vehicle performs similarly to its base model, having average acceleration and top speed. However, the player may experience fishtailing upon initial acceleration due to the high amount of engine power delivered to the rear wheels, and some degree of understeer at high speeds. The unequeal weight distribution, short wheelbase and wide rear axle means it can easily lose control if the vehicle hits an obstacle. Because of this, the Slamvan can be very difficult to use in &lt;a href=\"Arena%20War\"&gt;Arena War&lt;/a&gt; modes due to the narrow spaces and short roads of the arena maps.\nThe vehicle is powered by a big-block V8 engine similar to vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Fr%C3%A4nken%20Stange\"&gt;Fr\u00e4nken Stange&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tornado%20Rat%20Rod\"&gt;Tornado Rat Rod&lt;/a&gt;, coupled to a 4-speed gearbox in a rear-mid engine, rear wheel drive layout. It uses the same loud engine sound from the Slamvan and the &lt;a href=\"Slamvan%20Custom\"&gt;Slamvan Custom&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor.\nThe Slamvan, like other Arena vehicles, can withstand a single explosive without being destroyed, but the large windows leave the occupants highly vulnerable to gunfire on the front and sides, and the rear engine is also exposed to gunfire from the rear. This issue can be mitigated with the addition of armor upgrades, partially protecting the cabin with metal bars on the driver side and a plate on the passenger side, while the side windows are partially protected by metal bars. These upgrades also cover the engine and part of the rear windows, with the Heavy Armor upgrade providing the highest protection. The rear wheels can be partially protected with curved plates acting as mudguards. Bulletproof Tires are not available, but will carry over if applied to the stock Slamvan before converting to the Arena variant.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Nightmare Slamvan can be modified at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, although special upgrades are only available at the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Workshop\"&gt;Arena Workshop&lt;/a&gt;."}

Some of its components, like the hood, rear louvres and rear light protectors, have a texture. One of the rear louvres, the third one from top to bottom, bears the &lt;a href=\"Ranch%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ranch&lt;/a&gt; brand on it and has a plain texture compared to the other ones.\nThe primary colour of the vehicle is applied on most of the bodywork, the mirror wings, one of the rear louvres, part of the interior, the sections of the dashboard holding the switches and the overstitches, while the secondary colour is applied on the lower headlight housings, over fenders, side window trims, roof scoop, inner door frames and tyres. It shares the same rim design as the Apocalypse variant and the &lt;a href=\"Verlierer\"&gt;Verlierer&lt;/a&gt;, fitted with low-profile &lt;a href=\"Fukaru\"&gt;Fukaru&lt;/a&gt; tyres. The rims can also support a dedicated colour, which is set to the default alloy colour on purchased examples. The car also has permanent colours applied to random parts; The hood is painted in purple, while the hood vents and rear light protectors are painted in red. The diamond/durbar louvres also alternate between purple and red.\nThe vehicle can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with two top-mounted machine guns on the hood, which resemble .\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nBeing a sports car, the ZR380 performs exceptionally well. It has great top speed and good handling, but its acceleration is decent, partially due to the weight of its armour parts. The reinforced chassis gives the car good resistance to collisions, but still has average ramming capabilities.\nWhile its hood is completely sealed, it is possible to remove it through customization, revealing to be powered by a twin-cam Inline-4 engine, with \"Annis\" embossed on the cover. It also features two cold-air intake systems coming from the upper grille (ram-air intake) of the car (a feature seen on cars like the &lt;a href=\"Exemplar\"&gt;Exemplar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20GT\"&gt;Rapid GT&lt;/a&gt;). It also has a 6-speed gearbox, a rear wheel drive layout and a sound that is similar to cars like the &lt;a href=\"Verlierer\"&gt;Verlierer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ETR1\"&gt;ETR1&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ZR380 can withstand a single explosive without being destroyed, like other Arena vehicles. However, the car is already modified with window plates on the front, making it a good choice for hits &amp; runs. It can be further upgraded with more armour plating on the side windows and the rear side of the cabin, although the occupants are still vulnerable to enemy gunfire.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Nightmare ZR380 can be modified at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, although special upgrades are only available at the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Workshop\"&gt;Arena Workshop&lt;/a&gt;."}

The wraparound rear window is most likely taken from the . There is also a resemblance to the , apparent in the double lighting arrangement and both main and lower grilles.

Additional modifications can be installed to customize it into some sort of dragster. Its interior is the same \"Dominator\" interior and dials used on various muscle cars.\nThe primary color of the car is applied on the bodywork and the interior stitching, while the secondary color is applied on the center of the car, in the form of a wide stripe passing through it. Its stock wheels seem to use the 5-spoke rim design similar to some of the sport rims available at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, but are flat in appearance and with a mostly squared end.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Nightshade has acceptable acceleration and an average top speed for the class. Its handling is remarkably good, keeping some semblance of traction despite being a muscle car. Oversteer is less common than other Muscle cars and easier to correct. Its handling feels very nice, but this is mostly due to being underpowered compared to other Muscles, and it is therefore less viable for racing. In addition, wheelspin is a common sight when using the throttle at full power. Crash deformation is excellent, and it can take several head-on hits before showing any real damage.\nAccording to the website, the Nightshade is stated to be powered by a 5-liter V8 capable of pushing 420bhp, and the badges state it is powered by a V8 turbo. Both statements make sense with the vehicle's engine model and spark plug textures, which show that it is indeed a single cam V8, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. Its engine sound is the same as cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, as of the &lt;a href=\"Nightshark%20Week\"&gt;Nightshark Week&lt;/a&gt; event, it became available for purchase.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe SUV appears to be based on the Kombat, with elements from the Dartz Black Shark, predominately in the front design.\nThe Nightshark assumes an utilitarian and sturdy design, featuring a heavy-duty bumper with a steel bar in the center and an open mesh grille with high-beam square lights, followed by circular main lights and dual outer turning lights. The hood area is mostly enclosed, featuring small vents on either side.\nOn the sides, small armor panels run between the angular arches, while the cabin area has dual circular high-beam lights with three marker lights on the roof, and small bars above the side windows. The exhaust tips can be seen on either rear quarter of the rear bumper.\nThe rear has a thick armor panel in the center and rectangular tail lights beside it, separated into the main and brake units on the inner side, and dual turning units with lower reverse units on the outer side. The heavy-duty rear bumper mounts the license plate and a steel bar with the tow hitch, along with a sump guard on the underside.\nThe interior of the vehicle is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent\"&gt;Insurgent&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up&lt;/a&gt;, using a digital dial set with various components usually seen on industrial trucks. The back section has a rather worn appearance.\nThe vehicle is prominently painted in a primary color, with the outer portions and circular holes of the front bumper, the steel bars, the side armor panels and the side roof bars painted in a secondary color. The vehicle uses large industrial wheels with high-profile tires, sharing the same steel rim design with the ones from the Insurgent and its armed variant. These rims can also support a dedicated color (although only naturally-generated examples may have one).\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with four retractable machine guns located in the outermost vent holes of the front bumper. When selected, the small hatches open and the machine guns are extended/retracted.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nFor an armored vehicle of this size, the Nightshark performs exceptionally well. It has great acceleration and good top speed, as well as great handling, able to sort most turns on the road, though one may experience slight understeer on sharp turns. The reinforced bumper also means it can push over other vehicles rather easily, without a drastic loss of speed. Its suspension is average for a car of its type, meaning it can keep its stability on bumpy terrain and uneven roads, but the ground clearance is seemingly low, often crashing into obstacles such as small barriers.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent\"&gt;Insurgent&lt;/a&gt; and its variants, the hood is completely sealed, meaning there is no way to reveal its engine (In fact, it lacks an engine model). The engine sound is similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Schafter%20V12\"&gt;Schafter V12&lt;/a&gt;, which sounds higher-revving and louder. When idle, the engine sound is the same one used on the &lt;a href=\"Lynx\"&gt;Lynx&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent\"&gt;Insurgent&lt;/a&gt;, the Nightshark is resistant to explosions, able to take up to 8 &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RPGs&lt;/a&gt; or 8 &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bombs\"&gt;sticky bombs&lt;/a&gt;, being destroyed with a ninth one. It is also able to take up to 26 homing missiles when fully upgraded (provided that it is occupied by a driver, otherwise the explosion resistance will be halved), giving it high durability against vehicles with homing missiles and providing reaction time for the driver to escape.\nIts only downside is that the windows are not bullet-proof, meaning that players are vulnerable to gunfire. This can be partially remediated by installing window plates, as they cover most of the cabin and only leave a small opening. Still, players can be shot from a small opening, and the plates on the doors do not protect the occupants. The window plates also prevent the occupants from using any weapons at all (except for the front MGs).\nWeaponry.\nMachine Gun: The driver has access to four front-facing machine guns, which perform similarly to those from vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Blazer%20Aqua\"&gt;Blazer Aqua&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ruiner%202000\"&gt;Ruiner 2000&lt;/a&gt;, with a damage of 20 and a fire rate of 1,000 rounds per minute. They have decent firepower against players and vehicles with none or light armor, but will struggle against heavily-armored vehicles.\nTrailer.\nTowing an &lt;a href=\"Anti-Aircraft%20Trailer\"&gt;Anti-Aircraft Trailer&lt;/a&gt; in collaboration with another player gives the vehicle increased potential, as the Nightshark lacks any sort of defensive capabilities against targets on either side and rear but is faster than most other vehicles that can tow it. The lack of armor often makes the trailer the first vehicle to lose during a combat.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMachine Gun=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Nightshark is able to be customized in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, although the liveries can only be accessed in the &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;Vehicle Workshop&lt;/a&gt; inside a &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt;."}

Players should be aware that there is a security guard who constantly patrols around for a few seconds and comes back; if the guard sees the player touching her three times, he will throw the player out of the club (this does not apply to GTA Online). &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;GTA Online players&lt;/a&gt; must use their microphone to flirt with the stripper.\nWhen her 'like' meter is high enough, she will provide the player with the option to pick her up behind the club in \"GTA V\". She will join the player in their car, so they can take her home for &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Call\"&gt;booty calls&lt;/a&gt;. In \"GTA Online\", however, the player will receive her &lt;a href=\"Phone%20Numbers\"&gt;phone number&lt;/a&gt; and will be able to invite her to their &lt;a href=\"Safehouses%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;apartment&lt;/a&gt; where she will perform lap dances for free.\nIn \"GTA V\", her number will be available in the player's &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;phone&lt;/a&gt; after being taken home for the first time. The player can only call at night to take her home. Nikki (along with other available strippers to take home) will usually send pictures of herself after being taken home to have sex.\nIn \"GTA V\", when taking Nikki home, she will get mad and leave the player when it looks like they're leaving her behind. The same happens in \"GTA Online\" when it looks like she's being ignored.\nCharacter.\nAppearance.\nNikki has short black hair and tattoos on her lower back and leg, with purple thigh-height boots.\nIf the player dates her, she will wear a long sakko and a shirt.\nShe shares a character model with &lt;a href=\"Cheetah%20%28stripper%29\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;. The only difference being the clothing, skin, and hair design."}

He later worked for &lt;a href=\"Gangs%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;organized crime syndicates&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"Hitmen\"&gt;hired-gun&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. Ever since the wars ended, Niko's main goal in life was to find and kill one of two men: &lt;a href=\"Bernie%20Crane\"&gt;Florian Cravic&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Darko%20Brevic\"&gt;Darko Brevic&lt;/a&gt;, for one of them betrayed his &lt;a href=\"Fifteen%20Man%20Squad\"&gt;military unit&lt;/a&gt; during the wars and nearly killed him. Niko is the younger cousin of &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman Bellic&lt;/a&gt; and the son of &lt;a href=\"Milica%20Bellic\"&gt;Milica Bellic&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was voiced by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Hollick\"&gt;Michael Hollick&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nEarly Life and Family.\nNiko was born in Yugoslavia in &lt;a href=\"1978\"&gt;1978&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbian&lt;/a&gt; family. It was implied that his father was an abusive alcoholic. His mother, Milica Bellic, was unhappy that her son grew up in such a harsh place. In a conversation with &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McReary\"&gt;Patrick McReary&lt;/a&gt;, Niko reveals that he had a &lt;a href=\"Niko%27s%20Brother\"&gt;brother&lt;/a&gt; who died during the Yugoslav Wars. According to the dialogue in the mission &lt;a href=\"Taking%20in%20the%20Trash\"&gt;Taking in the Trash&lt;/a&gt;, Niko dreamed of becoming an astronaut when he was a child. In a conversation with &lt;a href=\"Dwayne%20Forge\"&gt;Dwayne Forge&lt;/a&gt;, Niko mentions the house where he grew up in did not have electricity until he was twelve. In a conversation with &lt;a href=\"Kate%20McReary\"&gt;Kate McReary&lt;/a&gt;, Niko says that he found out his aunt (Roman's mother) was raped and murdered, some time after Roman's departure to the United States. Knowing Roman would be even more devastated if he knew the true circumstances of his mother's death, Niko covered up what happened, telling him that she died in a house fire.\nBosnian Wars.\nNiko grew up in the harsh environment of the Yugoslav Wars, and was a teenage soldier for the Serb led army (The Yugoslav Wars were fought between &lt;a href=\"1991\"&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;, which means that Niko was only 13-23 years old at the time). Niko says that he was betrayed \"ten years ago\", making it closer to &lt;a href=\"1997\"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt; (although Florian claims that it was \"twelve or thirteen years ago\" in a phone call after the mission &lt;a href=\"That%20Special%20Someone\"&gt;That Special Someone&lt;/a&gt;). He served as a helicopter pilot and an infantryman during the war, and during the mission &lt;a href=\"Easy%20Fare\"&gt;Easy Fare&lt;/a&gt;, Roman alludes to him driving a tank.\nDuring the war, Niko both witnessed and committed numerous atrocities, which led to his cynical perspective on life, and a certain degree of regret, depression, and emotional detachment. Eventually, Niko's unit of &lt;a href=\"Fifteen%20Man%20Squad\"&gt;fifteen men&lt;/a&gt; (most of them friends from his hometown) were ambushed by enemy forces, but Darko Brevic, Florian Cravic, and Niko himself survived. Niko concluded that either Florian or Darko had sold the group out, and he vowed to uncover and kill the culprit, not only to gain revenge, but also to hopefully \"close the book\" on the incident and move on with his life.\nPost-War life.\nNiko had trouble finding steady work after the war. Niko's cousin, Roman, had already moved to &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt; to start a new life in Liberty City while Niko spent the next decade working in the European criminal underworld, leading to a period of incarceration in a European penitentiary. After his release from prison, he began working for a human trafficking ring led by &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt;. When a boat involved in the operation sank in the Adriatic Sea during a smuggling run into &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, Niko swam to safety, but everything and everyone else was lost. Bulgarin believed that Niko had intentionally scuttled the ship and stole his money. Bulgarin's reach was too great within Europe, so Niko joined the merchant navy to escape him.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nNiko spent seven months on the cargo ship &lt;a href=\"Platypus\"&gt;Platypus&lt;/a&gt;, which eventually smuggled Niko into Liberty City.\nDuring the game, Niko says he moved to Liberty City because he wanted a new life by living the American Dream, but when he does arrive in Liberty City, he has nothing except Roman. Niko parted ways with &lt;a href=\"Hossan%20Ramzy\"&gt;Hossan&lt;/a&gt; and the Platypus crew there, partly to &lt;a href=\"The%20Cousins%20Bellic\"&gt;reunite with his cousin&lt;/a&gt;, and partly to track down Florian Cravic, who had moved to Liberty City after the war. Roman had been boasting of great success in Liberty City, but in truth, his assets amounted to a small, gritty taxi depot and a rundown apartment, and he was saddled with heavy debts due to his gambling habit. Niko &lt;a href=\"Three%27s%20a%20Crowd\"&gt;would&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Easy%20Fare\"&gt;ass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"Jamaican%20Heat\"&gt;ist&lt;/a&gt; Roman in his taxi business, and protect his cousin from the loan sharks who were harassing him. Roman's connections eventually led to Niko making friends with &lt;a href=\"Little%20Jacob\"&gt;Little Jacob&lt;/a&gt;, and taking work from the &lt;a href=\"Faustin%20Mafiya\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt;, setting in &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Vlad\"&gt;motion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Revolution\"&gt;the events&lt;/a&gt; of the game.\nAfter killing &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Glebov\"&gt;Vladimir Glebov&lt;/a&gt;, Niko is spared by &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Faustin\"&gt;Mikhail Faustin&lt;/a&gt;, although &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt; wanted him and Roman killed. After &lt;a href=\"The%20Master%20and%20the%20Molotov\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; Mikhail, &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Revolution\"&gt;Dimitri reveals his connections with Ray Bulgarin and turns against him, even trying to kill him&lt;/a&gt;. Niko and Roman flee &lt;a href=\"Hove%20Beach\"&gt;Hove Beach&lt;/a&gt; when their &lt;a href=\"Broker%20Safehouse\"&gt;apartment&lt;/a&gt; and Roman's taxi depot &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Sorrow\"&gt;were burned down&lt;/a&gt;. It is at this point that Niko becomes a hitman and an associate of many. &lt;a href=\"Mallorie%20Bardas\"&gt;Mallorie Bardas&lt;/a&gt;, Roman's girlfriend, &lt;a href=\"Escuela%20of%20the%20Streets\"&gt;introduces&lt;/a&gt; him to two contacts, &lt;a href=\"Manny%20Escuela\"&gt;Manny Escuela&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Luck%20of%20the%20Irish\"&gt;and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Elizabeta%20Torres\"&gt;Elizabeta Torres&lt;/a&gt;. Niko develops affiliations and becomes a worker of the &lt;a href=\"McReary%20Family\"&gt;McReary Family&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Playboy%20X\"&gt;Playboy X&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwayne%20Forge\"&gt;Dwayne Forge&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%20Family\"&gt;Pegorino Family&lt;/a&gt;, to name a few, over the course of the game. In an attempt to lure Niko into an ambush, Dimitri &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Holiday\"&gt;kidnap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"Hostile%20Negotiation\"&gt;s&lt;/a&gt; Roman, who is &lt;a href=\"Hostile%20Negotiation\"&gt;rescued&lt;/a&gt; by Niko.\nNiko eventually becomes in forced contact with an &lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;International Affairs Agency&lt;/a&gt; front under the name of &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper\"&gt;United Liberty Paper&lt;/a&gt;, who blackmails him into doing some \"country-protecting\" work. Also, &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt; managed to help Niko find Florian Cravic. When Niko &lt;a href=\"Weekend%20at%20Florian%27s\"&gt;confronts him&lt;/a&gt;, Florian, who now calls himself Bernie Crane, begs for forgiveness and claims he is not only a homosexual but that he is not the one who betrayed Niko (despite escaping). Niko forgives him and actually begins helping Bernie &lt;a href=\"Hating%20the%20Haters\"&gt;with&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Union%20Drive\"&gt;his&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Buoys%20Ahoy\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a sign of gratitude towards Niko for his work with them, the U.L.P. locate Darko Brevic in Romania and smuggle him into Liberty City. Niko &lt;a href=\"That%20Special%20Someone\"&gt;confronts Brevic&lt;/a&gt;, who confesses that he sold Niko's army unit out for $1,000, which he used to fund his heroin addiction. Enraged at the fact his unit were betrayed for such a paltry sum, Niko holds Brevic at gunpoint. Whether Niko kills Brevic or not depends on the player's actions.\nAfter his confrontation with Brevic, Niko meets &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Pegorino\"&gt;Jimmy Pegorino&lt;/a&gt; again. Pegorino asks Niko to do a heroin deal with Dimitri Rascalov. Niko is reluctant to do so, because of the bitterness between himself and Rascalov. The conclusion of the storyline depends on the player's decision.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nRevenge=\nIf the player chooses to take revenge on Rascalov, Niko fights his way onto the Platypus ship, which Rascalov is loading with heroin, and confronts Rascalov over his earlier &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Revolution\"&gt;betrayal&lt;/a&gt; of Niko. Niko executes Rascalov, which leads to the downfall of the Pegorino family. Angered at Niko's betrayal, Pegorino attempts to assassinate him in a drive-by shooting at Roman Bellic's wedding, but instead kills Niko's girlfriend &lt;a href=\"Kate%20McReary\"&gt;Kate McReary&lt;/a&gt;. To avenge Kate's death, Niko, along with Little Jacob and Roman, chases Pegorino throughout the city before confronting and killing him on Happiness Island.\nDeal=\nIf the player chooses to do the deal with Rascalov, he will betray Niko again and send a &lt;a href=\"Wedding%20Assassin\"&gt;hitman&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20%26amp%3B%20Mrs.%20Bellic\"&gt;assassinate Niko&lt;/a&gt; at his cousin's &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20%26amp%3B%20Mrs.%20Bellic\"&gt;wedding&lt;/a&gt;. Niko survives and kills the assassin, though his cousin Roman is accidentally shot and killed during the shootout. Enraged by this, Niko and Little Jacob chase Rascalov, who kills Jimmy Pegorino, throughout the city before confronting and killing him on &lt;a href=\"Happiness%20Island\"&gt;Happiness Island&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nAt the end of the game, a &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; report states that Niko is wanted for questioning by the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; (although not as a suspect) for the events of his cousin's wedding.\nNiko's immigrant status is uncertain and arouses the suspicion of the LCPD and FIB. Although Niko often protests that he \"has his papers\" while fleeing police, Roman says that Niko does not have a visa. This is further evidenced in a &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt; article about the death of the Platypus's captain, &lt;a href=\"Zorba%20Philippidis\"&gt;Zorba Philippidis&lt;/a&gt;, which states that none of the crew possess visas.\nIf &lt;a href=\"Diamonds%20Are%20a%20Girl%27s%20Best%20Friend\"&gt;Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend&lt;/a&gt; is played after &lt;a href=\"Pest%20Control\"&gt;Pest Control&lt;/a&gt;, Niko tells Packie that he intends to go after Ray Bulgarin, although Ray would be &lt;a href=\"Departure%20Time\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Lopez&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIf Niko chooses to do the &lt;a href=\"deal\"&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt; with Dimitri, after Roman's death, Niko most likely gives up his life of crime and stays close to his friends as they are there for him. Also, Niko says to Mallorie that her child will need not to worry about being fatherless, hinting Niko will help take care of her child and assume a fatherly role.\nIf Niko chooses to seek &lt;a href=\"Revenge\"&gt;Revenge&lt;/a&gt; on Dimitri, Niko's love interest, Kate is killed though he is still able to have a date such as &lt;a href=\"Alexandra%20Chilton\"&gt;Alexandra Chilton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carmen%20Ortiz\"&gt;Carmen Ortiz&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Kiki%20Jenkins\"&gt;Kiki Jenkins&lt;/a&gt; and keep in contact with his cousin and friends. He most likely gives up his life of crime and tries to live a normal one with Roman, as is hinted by the comments made about him in .\n2013.\nNot much is known about Niko's life during the events of \"Grand Theft Auto V\". It is hinted that he has completely given up a life of crime, and has now retired. &lt;a href=\"Casing%20the%20Jewel%20Store\"&gt;While setting up for the first heist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; mentioned to &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; that he knew \"an Eastern European guy making moves in Liberty City\", but dismissed the idea as \"he went quiet\". This would hint that he'd continued his life as a career criminal for a few more years before leaving it, especially if he was able to gain such notoriety as recently as of 2013.\nLater while on a &lt;a href=\"The%20Paleto%20Score\"&gt;heist&lt;/a&gt;, if Packie was chosen for the job, he begins talking about his &lt;a href=\"Three%20Leaf%20Clover\"&gt;most successful job&lt;/a&gt; in Liberty City, and then mentions Niko, revealing that he doesn't even know what became of him, and that he is \"probably dead\". It is possible though that Niko has cut all ties to his previous criminal lifestyle, including all ties with Packie, and is retired.\nAfter completing the mission &lt;a href=\"Reuniting%20the%20Family\"&gt;Reuniting the Family&lt;/a&gt;, one potential scenario in &lt;a href=\"Michael%27s%20mansion\"&gt;his house&lt;/a&gt; sees his family gathered around the dining room table. &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Jimmy&lt;/a&gt;, Michael's son, is writing his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 on a laptop. However, the screen displays a &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader\"&gt;Lifeinvader&lt;/a&gt; profile page as an Easter egg. \nBy using a camera to zoom in, the page is revealed to be that of Niko Bellic, complete with an image of the character. He now lives in Broker, still working as a taxi driver for Bellic Cab Service, and is still in contact with Mallorie Bardas, &lt;a href=\"Little%20Jacob\"&gt;Little Jacob&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt;, who all liked his latest status. There is also a Happy Birthday note for Roman which was dated as being posted 40 minutes prior. As Rockstar Games have officially stated that there are no \"true paths\" for \"Grand Theft Auto IV\"s storyline, and it's all determinant to the player, and this official stance was issued after the release of \"GTA V\", Niko Bellic's &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader/Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;LifeInvader profile&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA V\" (including Roman as a friend) is considered an &lt;a href=\"Secrets%20and%20Easter%20Eggs\"&gt;Easter Egg&lt;/a&gt;. \nA wanted poster for Niko can be seen on the porch of a house just west of &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;. This is another Easter egg referencing the \n2017.\nIn update for \"GTA Online\", Lester Crest briefly mentions Niko when he is talking about &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper%20contact\"&gt;Agent ULP&lt;/a&gt;, who blackmailed Niko to work for him &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;almost a decade ago&lt;/a&gt;.\n2022.\nIn update for \"GTA Online\", Agent ULP briefly mentions Niko during &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Paper%20Trail\"&gt;Operation Paper Trail&lt;/a&gt;, though not by name, to the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist as a previous IAA hired \"agent\". During the same dialogue, ULP makes a reference to his own dialogue from the \"GTA IV\" mission &lt;a href=\"Wrong%20is%20Right\"&gt;Wrong is Right&lt;/a&gt;, telling the protagonist they \"can't always tell who the good guys are. I'm not a good guy. But I'm fighting with them\".\nFurthermore, after the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist's &lt;a href=\"ULP%20-%20Cleanup\"&gt;final mission&lt;/a&gt; as a sworn-in IAA agent, they receive a final phone call from Agent ULP telling them they're on their own from now on and wishing them the best, saying the exact same phrase as to Niko during his last phone call to him in the \"GTA IV\" mission &lt;a href=\"That%20Special%20Someone\"&gt;That Special Someone&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 \"You're out. You've done good things for us, and we are grateful. From here in, you're alone. Goodbye\".\nCharacter.\nPersonality and traits.\nFrom the beginning, It is clearly evident that Niko's suffering from a quarter-life crisis. Having grown up in difficult conditions and witnessed the horrors of warfare, Niko in general feels frustrated, fatalistic, confused with his life's direction, pessimistic, overwhelmed, unappreciated, cynical, and unfulfilled. \nNiko is very protective of his family and loved ones, particularly his cousin Roman, whom Niko constantly has to worry about due to his gambling habit. Roman has an indiscreet nature of frequently getting the pair into trouble. He is withdrawn among strangers, but has good manners, and shows a softer side with love interests like &lt;a href=\"Kate%20McReary\"&gt;Kate McReary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Karen%20Daniels\"&gt;Michelle&lt;/a&gt;. That said, the horrors of war, both witnessed and perpetrated by Niko, have given him a great sense of guilt, and an ambivalence about the value of human life \u2014 he warns away pursuers and expresses regret over his past violence, but also feels that killing is all that he can do, readily taking on jobs which necessarily involve murder. Niko is prone to violence after being angered and he has an explosive temper when he is betrayed, manipulated, or his loyalty is questioned, but he is also quick to help the defenseless and unfortunate, even &lt;a href=\"Random%20characters\"&gt;those he merely meets in passing&lt;/a&gt;; he apparently possesses a sense of idealism which was wounded by his wartime experiences. Unfortunately, such a split attitude leads to hypocrisy \u2014 Niko, for example, appears to genuinely sympathize with the &lt;a href=\"McReary%20Family\"&gt;McRearys&lt;/a&gt;' grief over the demise of one of their brothers (either &lt;a href=\"Derrick%20McReary\"&gt;Derrick McReary&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Francis%20McReary\"&gt;Francis McReary&lt;/a&gt;), despite having secretly &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Brothers\"&gt;committed&lt;/a&gt; that murder himself. This makes it highly possible that Niko is a pessimist.\nNiko's bitterness at the murder of his friends during the war has consumed him, and he is unable to let it go, taking on several highly dangerous jobs merely to enable his quest for vengeance. Several of his friends, most notably Roman, urge him to find a new reason to live, and there are many morality choices for Niko to emphasize his trait.\nNiko's business-like manner usually leads him to behave more maturely and cautiously than his acquaintances, although with acquaintances like Brucie Kibbutz, Bernie Crane and Roman, this is no surprise. He has an apparent distaste for illegal drugs, much like &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;Victor Vance&lt;/a&gt;. He frequently turns down Little Jacob's offers for marijuana and warns Packie about his cocaine habit. He also finds it distasteful to traffic in cocaine and particularly heroin, although this may be due to the heavy jail sentences they attract as much as any moral qualms. He is skeptical of American mainstream culture, which he sees as \"shallow\" and \"hypocritical\" and has trouble relating to Roman's fascination with the country. However, he reasons that being in America is far better than back in Serbia due to the country's instability and misery.\nNiko also exhibits dislike for American conservative politicians, whom he considers to be hypocrites. An example is &lt;a href=\"Bryce%20Dawkins\"&gt;Bryce Dawkins&lt;/a&gt;, whom Niko says is a \"bullshitter\" for giving homophobic speeches and preaching about family values to gain political power when he himself is bisexual. However, a conversation between Niko and &lt;a href=\"Kiki%20Jenkins\"&gt;Kiki Jenkins&lt;/a&gt; reveals he considers himself neither liberal nor conservative, and that the war gave him a highly cynical view of politicians in general.\nNiko has a certain degree of empathy for other people, even random strangers, and feels obliged to help others who cannot help themselves. Most missions involve Niko doing jobs for money, particularly one occasion. After meeting a troubled young girl, &lt;a href=\"Marnie%20Allen\"&gt;Marnie Allen&lt;/a&gt;, he even gives her some of his own money multiple times to help her out. He is also surprisingly calm when speaking to authority figures, even those as powerful as Francis McReary, who he simply asks for more money from, much to the disappointment and frustration of McReary. He is usually never emotionally disturbed by anyone besides Darko Brevic. He expresses disgust at Brevic's drug addiction, and how he betrayed his army unit in exchange for drug money. If Niko kills Brevic, Niko will hesitate for a moment before unloading 12 shots (one for every member of Niko's army unit who was killed) into Brevic's body uncontrollably, even after Brevic's death after about the sixth shot. The only other figure that has visibly disturbed Niko is &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Low\"&gt;Eddie Low&lt;/a&gt;, who Niko is understandably creeped out by. This can even horrify the player to an extent, such as when Low makes comments about all the people he has murdered in gruesome ways, or Low's clinginess towards Niko for being his 'friend'. During his encounters with Eddie, Niko's eyebrows are raised and his mouth is open in disbelief. Otherwise, Niko's face is usually very serious.\nNiko almost always refuses alcohol when it is offered to him (he asks for water in the mission &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20the%20Not%20So%20Terrible\"&gt;Ivan the Not So Terrible&lt;/a&gt;) except for the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Holland%20Play\"&gt;The Holland Play&lt;/a&gt; where Playboy X pours him a glass. Niko goes to drink it, but changes his mind and puts the glass on a table. There is a scene where Niko does drink a glass of vodka (on the rocks) in the mission &lt;a href=\"One%20Last%20Thing\"&gt;One Last Thing&lt;/a&gt;, while talking to Jimmy Pegorino, but this is understandable considering &lt;a href=\"That%20Special%20Someone\"&gt;what he had just been through&lt;/a&gt;. Niko does seem to enjoy a drink, but knows the time and place for it. He refuses alcohol outright in instances where he needs to keep a sharp mind, such as during missions.\nWithout the player's control, Niko will never hit female pedestrians. For example, when Niko carjacks someone, the animation can sometimes see him punch or kick the occupant of the car, but he only does this to male drivers. If the driver is female, Niko will just pull her out of the car and not harm her.\nAppearance.\nNiko has brown hair and hazel eyes. He has facial hair that resembles a \"scruffy\" looking 5 o'clock shadow, which fits his 'thug' appearance very well. Niko isn't as heavily muscled as Luis or Johnny and he's more slender than both of them. Still, Niko has enough physical strength to hold his own in a fistfight and he's capable of pulling himself up on a ledge after hanging by his straight arms. He is also strong enough to twist Brucie's arm with ease. Several characters throughout the story call Niko \"big guy\" or \"big man\", which likely means that he is of tall stature and heavy build. Niko has a scar running through his left brow. He most likely got the scar during the war, however, this has not been confirmed. Niko's body is of 'average' build, but characters like Bernie Crane mention that \"Niko is still in great shape.\" Later, Bernie asks if Niko works out, to which Niko answers he doesn't work out but his dangerous lifestyle keeps him active. People consider him to be \"above average\" build despite his slender appearance. During his appearances in \"TLAD\" and \"TBoGT\", Niko looks almost exactly the same, except that he no longer has dimples. In \"GTA Online\" as a parent model, he looks similar to his \"GTA IV\" counterpart, but he now has a buzz cut and wears a polo shirt which can also be purchased by the player in &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;clothing shops&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeta.\nIn artworks and earlier screenshots, Niko had often been seen wearing finger-less gloves. The files still remain in the PC version and can only be used with an in-game trainer. Obtaining them in the game without modding is impossible. The reason why they have been removed from the final version of the game is unknown, but it is likely due to the fact that they are not very inconspicuous.\nIn early beta versions of \"GTA IV\", Niko had slightly thicker hair and sometimes he can be seen with a buzz cut, neither of which appear in \"GTA IV\", but still exist in the game files.\nNaming, Errors and Language.\nThe word \"Niko\" means \"nobody\" in the Serbo-Croatian language. The surname \"Bellic\" cannot exist in that language with that spelling, as it does not allow the double-L in \"Bellic\"; \"Bellic\" is also pronounced with a hard 'c' (/bel-lik/) throughout the game \u2014 Niko himself uses the incorrect pronunciation when introducing himself to the &lt;a href=\"Karen%20%28Receptionist%29\"&gt;receptionist&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Goldberg%2C%20Ligner%20and%20Shyster\"&gt;Goldberg, Ligner and Shyster&lt;/a&gt; in the mission &lt;a href=\"Final%20Interview\"&gt;Final Interview&lt;/a&gt;. A proper pronunciation would use a hard 'ch' (/belich/, as used in-game with the names \"Darko Brevic\" and \"Florian Cravic\"); a more authentic rendering of Niko's surname would be 'Beli\u0107'. At one point, Florian, speaking in his native Serbo-Croatian, pronounces the name correctly; \"Bellic\" may simply be an Anglicised version of \"Beli\u0107\". Going by that custom, Niko's real name may be Nikola Beli\u0107. The surname \"Bellic\" is likely derived from Russian rather than Serbian, which is incorrect.\nThe first name \"Niko\" is distinctively of Croatian origin rather than Serbian, the latter one preferring the name \"Nikola\". In the mission Final Interview, Tom Goldberg refers to Niko as \"Nikolai\", although this is an assumption on his part \u2014 he begins their interview by saying, \"Hello, Niko! What's that short for? Nikolai?\" Niko does not respond and no one else calls him \"Nikolai\" in the game.\nNiko's voice actor, Michael Hollick, is American, and the accent he assumes for Niko stereotypes Eastern Europeans (Slavic peoples) in general, instead of being specifically Serbian; Niko's spoken Serbo-Croatian is frequently mispronounced or wrongly emphasised.\nAdditionally, Niko's mother writes in a language similar to Serbo-Croatian.\nIn Other Media.\nInitial Inspiration.\nNiko appears to be visually inspired by Sasha from the 2001 movie , which takes place in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the war. Sasha's clothes are even available to buy in the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Shop\"&gt;Russian Shop&lt;/a&gt;.\nSasha's actor later confirmed in an interview that he was asked to play \"a man with a dark past, with a slightly rumpled appearance\" in an unnamed video game, whose producers liked his performance as Sasha. Given few details about what he was being asked to do or what for, Mashkov thought it was a questionable proposal and not very interesting, and he turned it down. Only later did he learn that the game was \"GTA IV\".\nPopularity.\nNiko was voted 13th in the 2011 edition of the Guinness World Records for the Top 50 favorite game characters. His name was incorrectly spelled \"Nico Bellic.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nNiko Bellic is available as a special &lt;a href=\"Dad\"&gt;Dad&lt;/a&gt;, used in &lt;a href=\"Character%20Creator\"&gt;creating&lt;/a&gt; the player's &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;custom character&lt;/a&gt;, alongside &lt;a href=\"Misty\"&gt;Misty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"John%20Marston\"&gt;John Marston&lt;/a&gt; from \"\"."}

On the middle section, the plane features numerous rounded windows and the angled wings with silver/chrome front surfaces, while the underside protrudes from the rest of the aircraft and houses the main landing gear. The tail boom/empennage mounts the engines on either side and the on the end, which is also taller and more angular than the ones from the Shamal and the Luxor. The vertical stabilizer bears a registration code that reads \"NLS210R\".\nThe interior of the aircraft shares the same instrument panel and the \"Lazer\" dial set from the Shamal and the Luxor, also using green screens with animated displays below. Similar to the &lt;a href=\"Luxor%20Deluxe\"&gt;Luxor Deluxe&lt;/a&gt;, it features a luxury interior, which includes a stand with bottles of champagne on it and a small room with four seats; with two seats facing to a small table that contains a bottle of champagne, two drinking cups and an ashtray with cigars on it. On both sides of the room compartment, there are two LCD screens with no text on it (since the interior is reused from that of the Luxor Deluxe, but having the \"Buckingham Luxor\" text removed). There is a second room with the same features as the first one, except by having only two seats on the right side of the plane, while the left side is occupied by an unused stand.\nThe aircraft's fuselage is painted with a primary color, while the secondary color is applied on the undercarriage. There are three swept back lines down the side of the fuselage to the empennage, where the upper one is classed as the secondary color and covers most of the vertical stabilizer, the middle one as the \"wheel\" color (which is always set to gray on purchased examples due to the wheel colour being set to the default alloy) and the lower stripe as the \"pearlescent\" color. It uses a set of industrial wheels also shared with the Shamal and the Luxor, being derived from industrial vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Nimbus is quite a fast jet, possessing a top speed slightly higher than the Luxor's, albeit with slower acceleration. It also has better braking abilities than the aforementioned jet, although agility is not as good.\nThe aircraft is powered by twin turbofan engines, also sharing its engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Luxor\"&gt;Luxor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;Shamal&lt;/a&gt;, albeit having a louder volume.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nUpon being converted into a personal aircraft, the Nimbus can be repainted with a primary color and a secondary color. It is possible to change the third stripe via the pearlescent color given with the primary \"metallic\" color. However, due to the second stripe using the plane's \"wheel\" (color slot 4) color, the color of the stripe cannot be changed."}
