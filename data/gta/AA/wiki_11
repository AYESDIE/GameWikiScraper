Woozie explains to him the problems he's having about the casino business. Apparently, either one of the three &lt;a href=\"Mafia\"&gt;Mafia&lt;/a&gt; families in the city - the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Sindacco Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; - are causing the trouble for him, and would do anything to keep them away. Woozie then offers a deal to Carl; in exchange for some help with the casino business, Woozie would offer Carl a share of the casino. Carl gladly agrees.\nA little later, a Triad comes in, saying that some thugs have been interrupting things, and that &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Sindacco\"&gt;one of the thugs&lt;/a&gt; was caught. Woozie orders him to get rid of the thug, but Carl has a better idea. He orders the Triad to tie him up on the windscreen of a &lt;a href=\"Feltzer\"&gt;Feltzer&lt;/a&gt;, and he would deal with this a little later.\nSoon enough, Carl goes to the garage and finds the thug already tied up to the windscreen of the car. Carl leaves the garage and drives frantically around town in order scare the thug into revealing which family he belongs to. The thug eventually reveals that he is from the Sindacco Family, and Carl says that's all he wanted to hear, leaving the thug horrified at having spilled the beans to Carl as to who is giving the Triads so much trouble. He then goes back to the casino.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nReward.\nThe rewards for this mission are &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;5,000 and an increase in &lt;a href=\"respect\"&gt;respect&lt;/a&gt;.

However, pressing the \"Sprint\" key after a measure of time will skip this cutscene and allow the vehicle to exit the garage. The player can also turn the Frame Limiter ON to solve this problem."}

Believing Tahir is linked to terrorist organizations, Ferdinand is kidnapped due to his association with him. The IAA mistakenly believe him to be a jihadist and that the cinema equipment he was installing was actually for surveillance. His death is faked and for six weeks he is interrogated in the &lt;a href=\"IAA%20Headquarters\"&gt;IAA Headquarters&lt;/a&gt;, where he is held as an intelligence asset.\nThe FIB, seeing through the IAA's story that Ferdinand was killed and desperate to receive the government funding, begin working on a way to extract him. FIB agent &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Norton\"&gt;Dave Norton&lt;/a&gt; subtly blackmails former bank robber &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt;, whom he had prior dealings with, into helping him. Having intel stating that Ferdinand's body was being held at the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County%20Coroner%20Office\"&gt;Los Santos County Coroner Office&lt;/a&gt;, Dave &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Man%20Walking\"&gt;knocks out Michael&lt;/a&gt;, who is believed to be dead and taken to the coroner's office for an autopsy. This allows him access to the building and when he wakes up, he finds the corpse claimed to be Ferdinand, but discovers it's a large African American woman. He calls Dave to inform him and escapes.\nLater on, Dave, agent &lt;a href=\"Andreas%20Sanchez\"&gt;Andreas Sanchez&lt;/a&gt;, and their boss &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Haines\"&gt;Steve Haines&lt;/a&gt; come up with a plan to &lt;a href=\"Three%27s%20Company\"&gt;extract&lt;/a&gt; Ferdinand from the IAA headquarters by once again blackmailing Michael, but this time including his friend &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; and former bank robbing partner &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;. Franklin is instructed to provide &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;sniper&lt;/a&gt; cover from the nearby &lt;a href=\"Arcadius%20Business%20Center\"&gt;Arcadius Business Center&lt;/a&gt; while Michael repels down from a helicopter piloted by Trevor, breaks the window to the room where Ferdinand is held, and grabs him. As Ferdinand is being interrogated by IAA agent &lt;a href=\"Karen%20Daniels\"&gt;Karen Daniels&lt;/a&gt;, the FIB execute their plan and successfully extract him. Ferdinand is initially grateful but soon finds himself shoved into a trunk by an FIB agent.\nFerdinand is taken to a warehouse in &lt;a href=\"Banning\"&gt;Banning&lt;/a&gt; with Dave and Haines, where the latter invites his friend &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt; to torture Ferdinand for his own personal amusement. Haines then orders Michael and Trevor to join them, who arrive as Weston is leaving. Desperate to get Ferdinand to tell him what he told the IAA in order to get the government funding first, Haines orders Trevor to torture Ferdinand to get him to reveal who he is working for, while Michael and Dave set off to &lt;a href=\"By%20the%20Book\"&gt;kill the target&lt;/a&gt; provided. Ferdinand, confused due to him not actually being linked to any terrorists, initially provides the address of the house in Rockford Hills that he worked at. When Michael and Dave arrive, Michael recognizes it as where the show \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Real%20Cunts%20of%20Suburbia\"&gt;The Real Cunts of Suburbia&lt;/a&gt;\" is being filmed and determines its not who they're looking for. Dave calls Haines, who in-turn orders Trevor to torture Ferdinand. When Trevor is finished, Haines asks Ferdinand about Tahir Javan, to which he provides the address of his house in Chumash. When Michael and Dave travel there, they find that Tahir is having a house party, requiring Trevor to torture Ferdinand several more times over the course of a few hours in order to reveal the description of Tahir. When Michael is satisfied with the information provided and is able to pick Tahir out of the crowd, he assassinates him with a sniper rifle.\nAfterwards, Haines orders Trevor to kill Ferdinand, claiming that he will no longer be useful. Trevor decides instead to let him live, because he doesn't like taking orders from government officials, and also because he believes Ferdinand must \"deliver a message\" about the pointlessness of torture, stating the torture only 'works' for the torturer's amusement or if the torturee gets off on it. He drives Ferdinand to the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt;, ignoring his complaints about his poor health and wanting to see his family again, and tells him to fly out of the country. Once dropped off at the airport, Ferdinand attempts to run away. Instead of entering the airport terminal, he stumbles at the top of a flight of stairs that lead down to the entry to the airport &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Transit\"&gt;LST station&lt;/a&gt; and immediately disappears, never to be seen or encountered again.\nIf his tooth was pulled out by Trevor during the torture session, it will appear in &lt;a href=\"Floyd%27s%20Apartment\"&gt;Floyd's Apartment&lt;/a&gt; along with the pliers used to pull it out, and can be seen until Trevor &lt;a href=\"Caida%20Libre\"&gt;flees the city&lt;/a&gt; after kidnapping &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin Madrazo&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Patricia%20Madrazo\"&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt;."}

He originally shared the show with &lt;a href=\"Lionel%20Makepeace\"&gt;Lionel Makepeace&lt;/a&gt;, who was often at odds with him and did not understand Fernando's poetic yet shallow monologues about passion and lust.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nBy &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;, he had proved popular enough that he hosted the show himself, possibly because his philosophy on passion fit much better in the era than Makepeace's deeper more sensitive views on the subject. Around this time Martinez also did a commercial for &lt;a href=\"Medallion%20Man\"&gt;Medallion Man&lt;/a&gt;, which was &lt;a href=\"Commercials%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;advertised&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;radio stations&lt;/a&gt; throughout &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;. At one point, he details how, during one of his visits to the &lt;a href=\"Malibu%20Club\"&gt;Malibu Club&lt;/a&gt;, he happened upon a lonely woman and introduced her to an &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;Englishman&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Kent%20Paul\"&gt;Kent Paul&lt;/a&gt;, and thus realized that he had a \"gift for bringing people together\", possibly foreshadowing his &lt;a href=\"Fernando%27s%20New%20Beginnings\"&gt;future business venture&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nSometime after 1986, he was fired from Emotion 98.3 and forced out of Vice City for unknown reasons. He then moved to &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, where he became the improvised host of \"&lt;a href=\"Lonely%20Hearts\"&gt;Lonely Hearts&lt;/a&gt;\" on &lt;a href=\"WCTR\"&gt;WCTR&lt;/a&gt; after hijacking the show from then-current host &lt;a href=\"Christy%20MacIntyre\"&gt;Christy MacIntyre&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nHe resurfaces in &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;, running a program in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; called \"&lt;a href=\"Fernando%27s%20New%20Beginnings\"&gt;Fernando's New Beginnings&lt;/a&gt;\", where husbands relieve the stress of married life by getting a &lt;a href=\"Prostitutes\"&gt;mistress&lt;/a&gt;.

When asked about his ethnic background, he says he is \"Latin\" but later claims that he is from &lt;a href=\"Upstate%20Liberty\"&gt;Upstate Liberty&lt;/a&gt;. Lazlow eventually gets fed up when he realizes \"Fernando's New Beginnings\" is nothing more than a &lt;a href=\"Brothel\"&gt;brothel&lt;/a&gt;, and ends the interview by yelling \"You're just a cheap pimp from Upstate, get out of my studio!\".

He has his own program called \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Fernando%20Show\"&gt;The Fernando Show&lt;/a&gt;\", where he is seemingly trying to give up his outdated and sexist womanizing ways and trying, though very frequently failing, to respect women and treat them as something more than just sex objects.\nDuring his interview with &lt;a href=\"Sue%20Murry\"&gt;Sue Murry&lt;/a&gt;, he shows sexual attraction towards her (despite earlier implying that he is either married to or living with the mother of his children) and is unable to refrain from continuously hitting on her until eventually she becomes outraged and leaves the studio, accusing Fernando of being a \"woman hater\" due to his sexist remarks and behavior.\nIn \"GTA V\", Fernando reveals that he is actually an illegal immigrant that got to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt; by outrunning a speed boat, presumably referring to the country's Border Patrol.\nHe is one of the honored celebrities on the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Walk%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Vinewood Walk of Fame&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nMartinez comes across as a \"\" who seduces all the women he meets and who has a passionate and lustful personality.

In one clip, two of the cars appear:\nThe vehicle's design is largely similar to its \"GTA IV\" design, however changes have been made to the car's door handles, rim design, plastic trims and skirts.\nInfluence.\nThe Feroci is based on a with the rear of the and takes many styling cues from numerous mid-size cars such as the and .

On the rear decklid, the name \"Feroci\" is placed where the name \"Intrepid\" would be, so the Feroci takes some styling cues from a .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe front bumper of the car is relatively large in profile and features a black narrow intake that spans about half the car's width, along with a set of unusable fog lamps beside it and a central plate holder mounted ahead of the intake. On the upper area, the central section is occupied by a trapezium-shaped chrome grille with five horizontal dividers and the Bravado emblem, while the sections beside it are occupied by wide headlight units, split between the main lights and smaller turn signals. The hood has smooth lines that start almost from the upper edges of the grille and run towards the windshield.\nThe sides of the car are denoted by the accent lines passing through, with the lower lines being at the same height as the upper edges of the bumpers, and the upper ones connected to the outer edges of the light units on both ends, just below the silver/chrome door handles. The greenhouse area makes use of black trim around the windows, painted mirrors on the front doors, and inner pillars on the rear doors, while the roof has a sunroof panel and additional black trim separating the roof area from the rest of the vehicle.\nOn the rear, the car's trunk lid features a black section with silver \"FEROCI\" lettering embossed on it and a third-brake light above, while the rear quarters house large tail lights, consisting of single main/brake units on the upper half and dual turn/reverse units on the lower half. Additional silver badging can be seen below the tail light units, displaying the manufacturer name on the driver side and the engine specifications on the passenger side. The rear bumper juts out from the rest of the car and features a plate holder in the center, small vents on the outer sides, and a narrow black section spanning most of the car's width, along with a small exhaust pipe on the driver side. The Feroci shares its interior with the &lt;a href=\"Imponte\"&gt;Imponte&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"DF8-90\"&gt;DF8-90&lt;/a&gt;, as \"DF8-90\" is printed on the seats.\nThe Feroci may spawn with several cosmetic accessories:\nThe vehicle spawns in a variety of primary colors for the bodywork, as well as a white secondary color that is actually applied on the rims (with some exceptions being either gold or black). It uses a set of five-spoke rims fitted with medium-profile tires.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Feroci is powered by what is claimed to be a 3-liter V6 on the badges, but is modeled as a twin-cam four-cylinder engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive configuration. Acceleration is acceptable, but not exceptional. Top speed is quite high. Handling is degraded by its rather soft suspension, designed for a nice ride, which it does, albeit with some firmness at low speeds. With enough effort the sedan can actually powerslide well, but drifts will need a rather odd amount of handbrake. With some practice, this car is a very good drifter. When beyond its limits, the suspension gives in fairly easily, but is one of the few vehicles that can drift, yet still have good handling. The steering feel is well weighted but feels too heavy, again at low speeds.\nBraking is acceptable, the vehicle is rather good at slowing down from high speeds. The Feroci has ABS, although it does not always work. Crash deformation is acceptable, and the engine can sustain many direct hits before catching fire. Overall, with a good driver and a gang of three others, this car can really change the tide of a deathmatch, beat some hard missions, or can win the player some good races. Although the gang variant has better protection from bullets (as the bodykit covers the wheels in certain angles), that works against the car when going off-road is required.\nThe engine sound is relatively smooth and mid-revving, also being shared with similar sedans such as the &lt;a href=\"Presidente\"&gt;Presidente&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vincent\"&gt;Vincent&lt;/a&gt;."}

The entire system consists of two ferry terminals (&lt;a href=\"Harwood%20Ferry%20Terminal\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Harwood\"&gt;Harwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rockford%20Ferry%20Terminal\"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rockford\"&gt;Rockford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;), and two identical large, blue-and-white ferries that alternate between both terminals.\nIn order to use a ferry service, the &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; must wait until a ferry is docked at a ferry terminal, at which point a yellow halo marker will appear on the dock in front of the ferry (but only if the player is not &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted&lt;/a&gt; at that moment). The player must then drive or walk into the halo, and press a button in order to confirm entry into the ferry. Each ferry ride is $25. The journey can last for up to two minutes, due largely to the slow speed of the ferry, although the player can skip to the period when the ferry arrives at its destination to save time. \nLike the &lt;a href=\"Subway%20Car\"&gt;Subway Car&lt;/a&gt;, the ferries cannot be stolen and controlled. However, the player may be able to jump on the lower deck of a ferry while it is docked. They may bump back and forth at first, but then the bumping stops. On rare occasions, the player may be able to jump into the empty interior. As soon as the ferry leaves the terminal, there will be violent bumping back and forth, eventually leading to the player falling into the water and drowning, although the player can counter the violent bumping by running in accordance to the direction of the ferry. Jumping onto the ferry is highly unrecommended, as even when the player manages to stay on throughout the entire course, the player cannot safely disembark the ferry from the other side in order to get to land in another terminal (unless they manage to jump inside the ferry).\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nThe ferry does not seem to particularly resemble any real-life model of a ferry. In the game, the vessel has two decks. The lower deck features a storage compartment for vehicles, in the form of a rather large area that is surrounded by two lateral walls and two sets of gates, one to the bow of the ferry, and the other to the stern of the ferry. The higher deck, that is on top of the storage compartment, features fences on its edges and the bridge of the vessel. On top of the bridge, there is a funnel out of which steam perpetually comes out.\nThe ferry is a textured vehicle, always appearing in a mix of white and blue. Most of the ferry is white, while the blue color is used for some side stripes on the hull and the lateral walls of the storage compartment, the gates, the top of the bridge, the flooring below the top of the bridge and a railing on the higher deck that is located towards the bow of the ferry.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nThe ferry is, as it can be expected, a rather slow vehicle. Its usefulness consists in its capacity to transport numerous vehicles and pedestrians from a part to the city to another, being a good transport option in the absence of bridges and tunnels.\nStrangely, despite its slow nature, according to the game files, the ferry can reach a maximum speed of 190 kph. However, this is never the case in normal gameplay.\nFate.\nThe ferry service is threatened by two new road links, the &lt;a href=\"Callahan%20Bridge\"&gt;Callahan Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Porter%20Tunnel\"&gt;Porter Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are under construction during events in the game. The possible obsolescence of the ferry service spurred union members to stage a &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Ferry%20Strike\"&gt;strike&lt;/a&gt; that momentarily shut down ferry services, cutting Portland off from the rest of the city. It is only after assurances by the mayor's office that some of the workers returned to work (as depicted during \"&lt;a href=\"Driving%20Mr%20Leone\"&gt;Driving Mr Leone&lt;/a&gt;\"), returning the ferry to normal service.\nIt is implied the ferry system was ultimately shut down following \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", as nothing remains of the service during events in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", which is set three years later, in 2001. The Portland terminal was demolished for the Portland exit of the Porter Tunnel while &lt;a href=\"Phil%27s%20Army%20Surplus\"&gt;Phil's Army Surplus&lt;/a&gt; was erected in place of the Staunton terminal."}

When activated, it also allows the driver to exit the vehicle without turning the engine off, which will also prevent the vehicle\u2019s radio from cutting off, thus allowing music to play.\nThe volume of the speakers is similar to that found on Benny's lowriders, but the bus' speakers seem to have slightly more bass than the lowrider stereo systems. Similarly, music can be heard in a roughly 250ft radius from the speakers.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nWhile the Festival Bus has near-identical performance to the &lt;a href=\"Prison%20Bus\"&gt;Prison Bus&lt;/a&gt;, one of the key benefits is that it doesn't tip over as easily compared to the Prison Bus, though its acceleration has lowered due to the DJ equipment and speakers being added to the vehicle. Furthermore, because of the additional features added to the bus, it can be problematic when attempting to drive underneath lower bridges and tunnels that are too low for it to go through.\nIt can be noted that the stage accessories, including the sculpture and speakers, can be detached in collision. These parts exceed the height of most street lights and traffic lights around &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, making it relatively difficult to avoid them. They also narrowly miss some overpasses, particularly along the &lt;a href=\"La%20Puerta%20Freeway\"&gt;La Puerta Freeway&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough it has the same capacity as its prison counterpart, additional players can stand on the stage roof without the risk of falling.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe bus cannot be modified as it is a &lt;a href=\"Pegasus\"&gt;Pegasus&lt;/a&gt; vehicle, however the player can choose from 10 different liveries:"}

In the following years, he became such a highly decorated and high-ranked FIB special agent to the point that he was given leadership of his own FIB special unit and became the handler and boss of several well-known FIB special agents, including &lt;a href=\"Andreas%20Sanchez\"&gt;Andreas Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Norton\"&gt;Dave Norton&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, Haines was chosen to become the host of a new criminal reality TV show called \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Underbelly%20Of%20Paradise\"&gt;The Underbelly Of Paradise&lt;/a&gt;\". As host of the show, Haines (and his camera crew) regularly make reports on gang activity and the overall criminal underworld of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, which is divided between rival criminal gangs. Haines would then become a celebrity, thanks to the success of the program.\nHowever, despite the decorations from the Bureau, leading his own unit, and becoming famous as the host of \"The Underbelly Of Paradise\", by &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, Haines and his right-hand man, Andreas Sanchez, were infamously corrupt. Haines in particular, was known to be on the payroll of several wealthy and powerful people, including eccentric billionaire &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt;, whom Haines considers a \"close friend\".\nEvents prior to \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn 2013, both the FIB and the rival &lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;IAA&lt;/a&gt; are in a heated battle to secure government funding after cuts had been made to the budgets of both organisations due to a decrease in terrorist activity. Haines actively engages in attempts to sabotage the IAA in order to gain more prestige within the Bureau by securing more funding from the government and improving his own public image in the process.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nAfter Michael makes Franklin &lt;a href=\"Complications\"&gt;crash&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"BeeJay%20XL\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Simeon%20Yetarian\"&gt;Simeon\u2019s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Premium%20Deluxe%20Motorsport\"&gt;dealership&lt;/a&gt; and beats him up, he can call Dave Norton and the two will catch up. Norton will mention that Steve is his new supervisor and is on the TV show. Michael asks if he\u2019s a good guy and Norton tells him that he\u2019s okay.\nWhen news of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Jewel%20Store%20Job\"&gt;robbery&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Vangelico\"&gt;Vangelico jewelry store&lt;/a&gt; reaches his ears, Haines immediately notices that several points match the M.O. of 'deceased' bank robber &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael Townley&lt;/a&gt;, who was supposed have been shot down by Dave Norton in a &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;botched robbery&lt;/a&gt; up in &lt;a href=\"Ludendorff\"&gt;Ludendorff&lt;/a&gt;. Looking into Norton's files, Haines realizes that Norton had made a secret deal with Michael and is currently hiding him in Los Santos under the alias Michael De Santa. Figuring he could use him for his own ends, Haines uses his influence over Norton to coerce Michael and his associates, &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;, into carrying out several illicit tasks for him. All of these jobs are aimed at sabotaging rival agency, the IAA, so the government will allocate more funding to the FIB, allowing Haines to advance his career.\nThe first of these tasks involves breaking into the &lt;a href=\"IAA%20Headquarters\"&gt;IAA Headquarters&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Three%27s%20Company\"&gt;kidnap&lt;/a&gt; Agency prisoner &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Kerimov\"&gt;Ferdinand Kerimov&lt;/a&gt;. After the kidnapping is successful, Haines later has Trevor torture Kerimov to get information, so that Michael and Dave can &lt;a href=\"By%20the%20Book\"&gt;locate and assassinate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tahir%20Javan\"&gt;Tahir Javan&lt;/a&gt;, a man suspected to be involved with &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijan\"&gt;Azerbaijani&lt;/a&gt; terrorists. After Javan is killed, Haines orders Trevor to kill Kerimov, but Trevor instead releases him, telling Kerimov to go into hiding in another country and become an \"advocate against torture\".\nLater on, Michael, Franklin, and Trevor meet up with Haines, Norton, and Sanchez at the &lt;a href=\"Murrieta%20Oil%20Field\"&gt;Murrieta Oil Field&lt;/a&gt; to discuss business. Steve tells the protagonists of his new plan to sabotage the IAA: &lt;a href=\"Blitz%20Play\"&gt;Robbing&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt; carrying valuable government bonds that Haines claims will be used by the IAA to finance gang warfare and thus cause a situation which will require giving them more funding from the US government. Using boiler suits, masks, a &lt;a href=\"Trash%20Truck\"&gt;trash truck&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Towtruck%20%28Yankee-based%29\"&gt;tow truck&lt;/a&gt;, and a getaway vehicle, the trio attack the armored car and escape with the bonds, giving them to Devin Weston at Haines' behest.\nAfter some time, Haines and Norton meet with Michael and Trevor, who are now hiding in &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt; (due to Trevor assaulting cartel boss &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin Madrazo&lt;/a&gt; and kidnapping &lt;a href=\"Patricia%20Madrazo\"&gt;his wife&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Caida%20Libre\"&gt;a job went south&lt;/a&gt;). This time, the FIB wants to raid &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Labs%20and%20Research\"&gt;Humane Labs and Research&lt;/a&gt;, an IAA compound, where according to Haines' sources, the Agency is developing an experimental neurotoxin that they plan to release in a metropolitan area as part of a staged terrorist plot meant to draw more funding for them. However, before the raid can be carried out, the protagonists need to acquire enough funds to obtain the necessary equipment. To this end, the trio contacts their associate &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; and hatch a plot to rob the &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County%20Savings%20Bank\"&gt;Blaine County Savings Bank&lt;/a&gt;. Despite some difficulty brought forth by the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County%20Sheriff\"&gt;corrupt local police department&lt;/a&gt; who used the bank to launder and store their pay-offs and extortion money, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Paleto%20Score\"&gt;heist&lt;/a&gt; is a success and the crew obtain the necessary funding.\nThe trio meet with Haines and Norton at &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Catfish\"&gt;Cape Catfish&lt;/a&gt; to start the &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20Business\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; on the IAA Compound, and upon discovering the fact that the crew did not procure additional manpower for the job (a fact Haines neglected to get them to do as Norton claimed he was going to have Sanchez make them do it), the FIB agents reluctantly join the caper team. Michael, Norton, and Haines take care of the theft, while Franklin and Trevor conduct the getaway. After infiltrating the research facility and stealing the neurotoxin, the theft crew are held back by unexpected IAA reinforcements. However, Haines manages to buy them enough time to escape by shooting himself in the leg and pretending to be an inside man who was trying to stop the theft, thus distracting the IAA agents long enough for the rest of the crew to escape.\nHaines' presence in the IAA compound during its raid causes the Bureau to start catching on to his corrupt and unsanctioned operations, which causes Haines to become increasingly paranoid. To prevent his arrest, Haines orders Michael and Franklin to &lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;break into the FIB headquarters and steal all the compromising information the Bureau has on him&lt;/a&gt;, promising to delete Michael's files and cut him and his friends loose after the job is done. After getting a team together, Michael and Franklin successfully raid the &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Headquarters\"&gt;FIB Headquarters&lt;/a&gt;, wiping out not only the evidence the Bureau had on Haines, but also the evidence Haines had on him and his crew, destroying Steve's leverage over them.\nHowever, because information specifically about Haines was erased, higher ups at the FIB begin to suspect he was the one behind the raid. Haines is still afraid of being caught red-handed and decides to try and pin the blame for all his illegal operations on Michael and Dave. He calls them both to a meeting with himself and Sanchez at the &lt;a href=\"Kortz%20Center\"&gt;Kortz Center&lt;/a&gt; and, once they arrive, he tries to have them both arrested. However, a rival FIB team arrives and Haines realizes that he has been promptly betrayed by Sanchez, who is revealed to have been working with a rival FIB unit all along. To complicate the situation further, separate groups consisting of IAA agents led by &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper%20contact\"&gt;United Liberty Paper contact&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt; battalion arrive.\nThe situation &lt;a href=\"The%20Wrap%20Up\"&gt;ultimately results in a massive four-way shootout&lt;/a&gt;. Haines gets shot in the leg (the same one he had previously shot himself in) and, in retaliation, he kills Sanchez before escaping, leaving Michael and Norton behind to die. However, with help from the unexpected arrival of Trevor, the duo manage to shoot their way out of the Center, killing all FIB, IAA, and Merryweather operatives present. During the shootout, Trevor suggests that they kill Haines, however Norton refuses and instead says that he will try to calm him down.\nAfter the Kortz Center incident, an infuriated Haines wishes to have all three protagonists killed, but Dave manages to calm him down and convinces him to spare Michael and Franklin, though he still insists that Trevor has to die, since he's too unpredictable to be kept quiet. He and Dave meet with Franklin after he &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Down\"&gt;drops off&lt;/a&gt; his friend &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt; at home and tasks him with the killing.\nHowever, soon after, Franklin is contacted by Devin Weston, who tells him to kill Michael for interfering with his business and for accidentally causing &lt;a href=\"Molly%20Schultz\"&gt;his lawyer's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Legal%20Trouble\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. As he can't kill both, Franklin is left with three choices: &lt;a href=\"Something%20Sensible\"&gt;kill Trevor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Time%27s%20Come\"&gt;kill Michael&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;save them both and team up to take down their enemies&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, Franklin chooses the third option.\nEndings.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nEnding C=\nThe Third Way.\nFranklin meets with Lester to tell him about his predicament. At first, Lester suggests killing both Michael and Trevor, but eventually thinks of a better plan - he will call Haines and Weston and tell them that the protagonists are melting the stolen gold from the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Depository\"&gt;Union Depository&lt;/a&gt; heist at a foundry in &lt;a href=\"Murrieta%20Heights\"&gt;Murrieta Heights&lt;/a&gt;. Once both of them send their goons to take out the trio, the protagonists can ambush them and take them out. The plan is a success as Franklin, Michael and Trevor take out Haines' corrupt FIB unit and Weston's private Merryweather battalion, thus eliminating both Haines' and Weston's criminal muscle. \nThe trio then decide to eliminate their enemies once and for all, agreeing to kill those they weren't directly associated with to throw off suspicion. While Michael goes after &lt;a href=\"Stretch%20%28character%29\"&gt;Stretch&lt;/a&gt; and Franklin targets &lt;a href=\"Wei%20Cheng\"&gt;Wei Cheng&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor eagerly goes after Haines. With Lester's help, Trevor locates Haines at the &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro%20Pier\"&gt;Del Perro Pier&lt;/a&gt;, where he is shooting an episode of his reality TV show. While Haines is filming a monologue on the &lt;a href=\"Ferris%20Whale%20%28Ferris%20Wheel%29\"&gt;ferris wheel&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor shoots him in the head with a sniper rifle (though Trevor can kill Steve with other weapons if the player is close enough), killing him while the &lt;a href=\"Underbelly%20Of%20Paradise%20Cameraman\"&gt;cameraman&lt;/a&gt; is still filming.\nEnding A=\nSomething Sensible.\nFranklin meets Trevor at the Murrieta Oil Fields and, after a brief chase, murders Trevor with Michael's help. Afterwards, Franklin calls Haines and informs him that he's done as he requested. Franklin also asks Haines to persuade Devin Weston not to go after him for sparing Michael. Haines tells Franklin that he'll handle Weston, who's in a precarious position because Merryweather has lost its licence to operate in the country, but also tells him to never contact him again.\nEnding B=\nThe Time's Come.\nIf Franklin chooses to kill Michael, he murders his former mentor on his own after a brief chase. Afterwards, Franklin calls Weston to inform him that he's done as requested and also to ask him to persuade Haines not to go after him for not killing Trevor. Weston tells Franklin he's already handled Haines and Norton, but tells him he's no longer useful and to never contact him again.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nAftermath of The Third Way.\n&lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Meteor\"&gt;Los Santos Meteor&lt;/a&gt; Newspaper \"\"Steve Haines, decorated FIB agent and host of the popular TV show \"The Underbelly Of Paradise\" unwittingly helped expose that underbelly further yesterday as he was assassinated while filming a segment of his TV show on the Ferris Whale on Del Perro Pier. Agent Haines, who had twice recently been injured in the line of duty, had been an agent for nearly 20 years and a TV host for five. FIB spokesman Gary Lane told the Los Santos Meteor \"Agent Haines died a hero, doing what he loved, which was presenting a TV show. He really helped combine the chaos of anti-terrorism and the mindlessness of network television into one highly successful career.\" Mr. Haines, who was not married, lived with his mother.\"\"\nPersonality.\nAs stated above, Haines is a corrupt FIB agent who does not hesitate when it comes to breaking the law and Bureau procedure and policy if there is an opportunity to further advance his career. Haines first appears to be pleasant and charming on his TV show, but when Michael meets him in person, he is shown to be selfish, arrogant, callous, manipulative, and overconfident in dialogue, thinking solely about his career. When they first meet, Haines introduces himself to Michael by saying \"Steve Haines, but you probably knew that already\" and asks Michael if he's ever watched his show, before displaying open displeasure when Michael claims he has never heard of Haines or his show. His true colors are shown, however, when Michael begins to jokingly mock Haines and his partners over their rogue activities. Haines plays along and even compliments Michael on his quick wit at first, before his temperament suddenly changes when he grabs Michael by the throat and threatens to strangle him to death if he continues to disrespect him. Haines has a very short temper and even shorter patience, as shown when he chokes Michael for making a few wisecracking jokes at his expense. Haines also attempts to make his own wisecracks, but his snide and arrogant personality often results in these jokes falling flat. Despite these traits, Dave Norton tries to assure Michael that they're not that different and that Haines and Norton are less corrupt than some divisions in the FIB, but over time it is shown that even Norton has no control over Haines, as do the rest of the protagonists.\nHaines is shown to be despised by almost everyone he comes into contact with (most noticeably by Michael and Trevor, who both share a deep hatred towards Haines). Despite this, he claims a personal friendship with Devin Weston, though Weston's reference to Haines as a \"clown\" would suggest otherwise. Haines has no qualms with torturing and/or killing people he sees as standing in the way of his career. This is shown when he has Trevor Philips brutally torture a seemingly innocent man for information (who was more than willing to give Haines the information he requested) on another possible terror suspect, before casually ordering Philips to murder the man when he is of no further use to him and leaving to attend a racquetball game. He is also shown to have little to no regard for innocent casualties, as until Dave objected, Haines initially suggested that Dave and Michael kill a man who owned a house in Rockford Hills where a TV show was being filmed for nothing more than the fact that he was of Azerbaijani descent and that the man Haines was interrogating, Ferdinand Kerimov, claimed to have installed equipment there for the show. Further evidence is shown when Haines also threatened to shoot Kerimov and call an airstrike on &lt;a href=\"Chumash\"&gt;Chumash&lt;/a&gt; if Kerimov failed to identify the target they were looking for, although it's possible that Haines was only bluffing about this to scare Kerimov.\nHaines is an opportunist. He uses Michael, Trevor, and Franklin to do his dirty work before betraying them when they outlive their usefulness to him. Haines is also willing to sacrifice others to save his own skin which is evident when he attempts to have Dave Norton and Michael De Santa arrested to deflect blame for all the criminal activities they participated in.\nTV host.\nSince 2008, Haines has been the host of \"The Underbelly of Paradise\" - a reality TV show that explores (and exploits) the poorer, crime-ridden streets of Los Santos and all the gangs that have their own turf in the city, including the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Families\"&gt;Chamberlain Gangsters Families&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;, who had been tracked down for years from the FIB, according to Haines.\nIn the TV show, Haines implies that the FIB (or his unit at least) have a \"community approach\" with the Ballas. He tries to prove this by greeting a Ballas member, only to be insulted by him.\nIf Franklin chooses &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;option C&lt;/a&gt;, then Trevor will track down Haines, who is shooting an episode of his show at &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro%20Pier\"&gt;Del Perro Pier&lt;/a&gt;, and kill him. After Haines's death, Dave Norton will call Michael and reveal to him that he has replaced Haines as the host of the show.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;GTA Online Protagonist&lt;/a&gt; can watch reruns of Haines's episodes on TV."}

Upon winning the race with Niko at the wheel, Brucie is so impressed that he turns the Comet over to Niko (implying that the car is not legitimately owned by Stevie, but is simply a \"company car\" obtained through his stolen car business).

He is credited as one of the major players in giving the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series the identity that it is well known for today.\nCareer.\nWaterson grew up in in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1993\"&gt;1993&lt;/a&gt;, he was asked by a group of friends to attend an art exhibition, located in a small gallery above a pub in , Scotland. He pulled some of his previous work together and decided to attend. While there, the Art Director for DMA Design at the time, &lt;a href=\"David%20Osborne\"&gt;David Osborne&lt;/a&gt;, happened to see his work and offered him an interview and job at DMA Design. Waterson became employee number 30 by the end of 1993.\nOnce working for DMA Design, Waterson's first assignment while learning game development was level designing on the game ', a piece of the established ' series of the 1990s. Waterson claims it took nearly a year to finish the game, working by trial-and-error, while teaching himself how video games are constructed.\nWork on \"Grand Theft Auto\".\nWaterson's next project was a new game called \"Race'n'Chase\". He was the first artist assigned to the game and was in charge of designing, modelling and rendering the 3D vehicles, as well as the 3D animation of characters and pedestrians. He was also involved in a number of key game design features, which the game was built on and still feature to this day.\nRace'n'Chase was never meant to be a game about criminality. It was a driving game with various game modes like Race, Cops and Robbers, and Demolition Derby.\nWaterson and Ian Johnson, a new coder at DMA Design and Waterson's flatmate, fixated on the idea of the protagonist being a getaway driver. This was when the theme of criminality first struck home.\nAn early piece of concept art Waterson drew for the game's boxart featured the strapline \"You can't drive with handcuffs on\".\nWaterson had a tongue-in-cheek title for the game - \u2018Get In. Get Out. Start Fucking About.\u2019 This is the idea he kept building on top of. While working on making these ideas mission specific, or building new missions to justify their existence, Waterson and the design team would simply add anything they found cool and fun to play around with. While working with some of the accepted norms of game design at the time, the teams continued to force in wanton destruction wherever they could. Even if ideas were turned down by senior staff, they were usually forced into the game anyway. As soon as the ability to hijack a car was implemented, everyone started committing grand theft auto.\nWaterson believes one of the turning points for the game was when he and Ian Johnson joked about implementing &lt;a href=\"Tank\"&gt;tanks&lt;/a&gt; into the game. At the time, Waterson says \"it was so ludicrous. There was no reason for them. There was no concept behind their involvement, apart from that they are almost indestructible, highly dangerous, and a load of fun to smash stuff with.\" After a short trip to the local store, their minds were set and they began mapping out thier plan. The premise was that there was a vehicle code that they could use, and also a ballistics code that allowed a rotating &lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrian&lt;/a&gt; to shoot bullets in eight directions. The idea was to put a pedestrian on top of a car, and make the car drive much slower than it normally would and massively increase the damage of the bullets it fired. This was the original version of the Tank.\nWaterson modelled the base for the tank and tracks in 3D, and textured it with camouflage using Alias Wavefront on a Silicon Graphics machine. Then he set about building the turret. \"The turret was like a player character sat on top of a car that could move independently, allowing the player to drive the vehicle, aim the turret, and fire.\" After staying late at work to test the Tank, they quickly implemented it into the game's code andleft it for the QA testers to find the next day. The testers and other designers loved the Tanks, and they were left in the game as a staple of the series to this day.\nLater Works.\nAfter \"Grand Theft Auto\" was released in &lt;a href=\"1997\"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;, Waterson at some point left DMA Design and moved around a few other game design companies for around 10 years before appearing to leave the business.\nThe first company he worked for was , where one of the games he worked on was the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Take-Two%20Interactive\"&gt;Take-Two Interactive&lt;/a&gt; published \"\", which released in &lt;a href=\"2002\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn December &lt;a href=\"2021\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;, Waterson began giving interviews to the website &lt;a href=\"https%3A//gamerhub.co.uk/\"&gt;GamerHub&lt;/a&gt; regarding his work on the original \"Grand Theft Auto\". These interviews were published every two weeks, going in-depth on various details of the game's design."}

{"id": "31553", "revid": "4255233", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=31553", "title": "Sticky Bombs", "text": "Sticky Bombs are throwable explosives featured in , and .\nDesign.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nThe Sticky Bomb is a -like explosive with a tripwire-triggered mechanism taped onto it. When thrown, the bombs emit a steady beep and a yellow light flashes. When activated the beep rises in pitch and speed, and the light turns red, then after less than a second, they detonate.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Sticky Bomb gains a new design and is now comprised of two M112 C-4 explosive sticks with a remote-controlled time bomb taped onto it. There is a small red light attached to the device to help mark it when placed and, like in its previous iteration, emits a steady beep, though not as noisy.\nPerformance.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nThe Sticky Bomb has the primary advantage of being a controlled explosive and having a controlled detonation, making it useful for timing explosives when the target is on the blast radius, which is similar to that of a &lt;a href=\"grenade\"&gt;grenade&lt;/a&gt;. As expected from its name, they can be thrown and stick to any surface they hit, which gives it another advantage over grenades as there is no need to be concerned they might bounce away from the target and either miss or worse, come back to the player and kill them in the process. Unlike &lt;a href=\"Satchel%20Charges\"&gt;Satchel Charges&lt;/a&gt; from , these bombs do not stick to people. They can then be detonated by pressing Down on the D-pad or shooting them.\nUp to 10 Sticky Bombs (2 in multiplayer) can be placed; throwing out the 11th (3rd in multiplayer) will cause the first one to disappear. The bombs have a 90 second fuse, so if an armed bomb is left undetonated for 90 seconds, it will automatically detonate. If the player is in a vehicle of any kind and they try to hold the sticky bomb until it detonates, it will not explode even after 90 seconds has gone by. It will start to beep slowly, and after about 60 seconds the beeping will get faster, but it will still not explode. If the player throws it out after holding it for a long time, the timer will reset as it is thrown out, so holding the bomb will not affect the time it takes to detonate.\nBecause of the beeping sound and the yellow light, the player might take difficulties to take out other players, as they can see or hear the bomb and they might either avoid passing over there or destroying them with another weapon, so the player may need to find alternatives. One of the best methods is that the player just need to open a car door (preferably to the side other players do not use to enter the vehicle) and stick the bomb to the inside of the door, so when the door closes, the bomb is inside the vehicle. This prevents other players from seeing the bomb.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Sticky Bomb is no different from the \"TBOGT\" iteration. Although they cannot stick to pedestrians in Story Mode, they can stick to them, as well as other players in Online. The limit for placed bombs has been amplified to 20 (5 in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\"). When the limit is reached, a message appears on the screen indicating it, and, like in \"TBOGT\", the first one disappears when the 21st (6th in \"GTA Online\") is placed. Unlike in \"TBOGT\", they will not explode over time.\nSticky Bombs can be used as a cheaper replacement for the &lt;a href=\"car%20bomb\"&gt;car bomb&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Online\". The player just need to open a car door (preferably to the side other players do not use to enter the vehicle) and stick the bomb to the inside of the door, so when the door closes, the bomb is inside the vehicle. This prevents other players from seeing the bomb, by applying the car bomb trick mentioned above, they can ensure no other players can see them.\nThe weapon can be useful in drive-bys, due to the fact it deals a large amount of damage, can stick to any vehicle, and can be detonated at any time (which allows them to be used somewhat like landmines). However, the player must be careful to ensure that their own car does not get caught in the blast radius, if using them against a vehicle in close proximity. Another factor to take in mind is how fragile they are, as shooting them will cause them to explode. If they are placed onto a vertical surface and rammed by a car, they will detonate. When armed, the Sticky Bomb will explode when shot from the player's hand; the vehicle they are inside will be destroyed, regardless if the vehicle has any sort of protection to explosions.\nSticky Bombs are more damaging against tanks, inflicting 28.57% more than any normal explosion. The &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; (in free roam) can be destroyed with three Sticky Bombs, while the &lt;a href=\"TM-02%20Khanjali\"&gt;TM-02 Khanjali&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"APC\"&gt;APC&lt;/a&gt; can be destroyed with six Sticky Bombs."}

The overall design is heavily based on both the and 1967 , while the front lights appear to be inspired by the . The car also features design cues from the and the Intermeccanica Italia GT, also Italian sports cars.\nThe overall profile of the car is similar to the \"Vice City\" renditions, but assumes an older design. The front end is protected by a chrome bumper spanning the width of the car and part of the sides, along with two small grilles and a license plate. It has stacked circular headlamps located in chrome housings, while the bonnet features the manufacturer emblem on the front.\nThe sides follow a curved design on the front fenders and a slightly wider profile on the rear ones, while the greenhouse area is mostly predominated by chrome elements on the circular rear-view mirrors, door handles and trim around the windscreen. The driver side portion behind the cabin features an upper fuel cap.\nThe rear is more traditional, featuring circular tail lamps on the edges and a chrome bumper on the lower side. The boot's end houses a set of chrome plate lights besides the license plate and a chrome handle, along with silver \"GROTTI\" and \"Stinger V8\" badges.\nThe interior of the car is a derivative of the one used used in the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;, featuring the same dial layout and central console elements, although the dials are black. In addition, it replaces the carbon-fibre unit backing with a wooden/walnut variation. The corresponding Grotti badges can be seen on the steering wheel and the passenger-side portion next to the central console unit.\nThe car is available with a soft top or with no roof, which can be changed in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.

The \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" version of the vehicle has a similar performance to its \"GTA III\" counterpart; however, it now features a RWD drivetrain, and its top speed is higher.\nIn \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\", the Stinger is amongst the fastest and best handling cars in the game. The Stinger in \"GTA Vice City\" features a FWD drivetrain, which may be unusual for a high-end sports car, but it allows the car to be more stable during hard acceleration and turning than the RWD drivetrains in some other sports cars (especially in rainy conditions). This attribute, along with the lack of understeer of the car, makes the Stinger ideal for &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Street%20Racer\"&gt;racing&lt;/a&gt;. The only flaw with the car occurs when one uses too much handbrake during turns, which will cause the Stinger to oversteer and overswing its rear end. \nIn \"GTA Vice City Stories\", the Stinger has a RWD drivetrain instead. Its top speed is also higher when compared to that of the \"GTA Vice City\" counterpart.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Stinger boasts a relatively high speed and acceleration, on par with several sports coup\u00e9s such as the &lt;a href=\"Feltzer\"&gt;Feltzer&lt;/a&gt;. Its 3.0L V8 engine (according to the website), mounted in a front position, longitudinally, is capable of delivering impressive top speed and acceleration. At high speeds however, oversteer is noticeable, and the car has the tendency to fishtail when turning, and on some occasions powerslide off the road. The vehicle's durability is average, as the car can sustain multiple head-on collisions before failing. The acceleration is beyond all other Sports Classics, as well as its speed. Its braking distance is a let down, unlike the &lt;a href=\"JB%20700\"&gt;JB 700&lt;/a&gt;, it seems to take a while to fully come to a stop.\nRockstar Games Social Club.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nStinger=\nTopless Stinger=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nGallery.\nDesign.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nSoft-Top=\nTopless=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nA variant of the Stinger used by the Sicilian Mafia appears in missions.

The rear, glass-enclosed V8 with down-draft carbureters may be inspired by the , while the double barrel downdraft carburetors found on the engine block appear to be based on the series (particularly the double-barrel downdrafts found on the Ferrari 250 GTO, on which the Stinger GT is based heavily). The central twin exhaust may be inspired by the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.supercars.net/blog/1963-aston-martin-dp214-gallery/1050422-2/\"&gt;Aston Martin DP214&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\nAs the name suggests, it is the variant of the &lt;a href=\"Stinger\"&gt;Stinger&lt;/a&gt; and thus, shares the initial bodywork design and layout. However, it is depicted as a hardtop, rear-engine variant of the aforementioned vehicle. The front of the car retains the split grille and the circular lamps located in chrome housings, but the front end is slightly more extended and the lower sides of the grille are a bit curved. The chrome bumper of the regular Stinger is removed in favour of a front splitter, which spans the width of the car. The bonnet features two vents, whose concave portions cover most of the section between the front axle and the windscreen.\nThe side profiling remains mostly identical to the regular Stinger, but the rear area was slightly altered with two intakes for the engine bay. The greenhouse area features a solid roof, rear-quarter windows and a single rear window that exposes the engine bay, along with chrome trims around them.\nThe rear end received drastic changes compared to the regular Stinger; a flat panel houses a set of protruding tail lamps and the plate lights are no longer present, although the corresponding badges remain in place. Said rear panel is surrounded by extensions on the sides and the upper area, forming a ducktail spoiler. Two bevelled twin-exhaust tips can be seen in the centre, which are of a larger diameter than the ones from the regular version. Its underside was rearranged as well, with the gearbox located on the rear axle and two black frames conforming the rear portion of the chassis, which allows the rear compartment to pivot backwards.\nThe interior of the car is the same one used in the Stinger, being a derivative of the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt; interior, while also retaining the wooden/walnut panels. The Grotti badge can be seen on the steering wheel, but the one on the passenger-side portion is absent.\nAgain, the primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary colour, although unable to be changed, is applied on the interior stitching, being only dictated by the selected colour when purchasing it (i.e. buying the car in a red colour gives an orange colour for the interior stitching). It uses the same set of wheels as the Stinger, being a derivative of the \"Wired\" lowrider wheels available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\nThe Stinger GT, being a grand tourer, is a good performing car for its class. The in-game engine model shows a single overhead camshaft V8 engine, with 4 double barreled-downdraft carburetors. Unlike the standard Stinger, the Stinger GT has its engine mounted in a rear-mid longitudinal position, whereas the Stinger has the engine placed in front-mid position.\nThe car also features two side-rear mounted radiators, which strangely share the same model as the intercoolers featured on the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20R\"&gt;Turismo R&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Osiris\"&gt;Osiris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"T20\"&gt;T20&lt;/a&gt;, however, intercoolers are typically only used on turbocharged vehicles, which the Stinger GT is not, leaving the only possibility of them being rear-placed engine radiators.\nDespite Legendary Motorsport stating the Stinger GT has better performance than the standard &lt;a href=\"Stinger\"&gt;Stinger&lt;/a&gt;, in-game testing has shown that there is no significant difference between the two, which leaves the player at the option of the player's preferable body style of convertible or coupe within the Stinger range.\nIts apparent 320HP 3 liter engine pushes it to a stated top speed of 175 mph (according to Legendary Motorsport), with a stated acceleration time of 5.7 seconds. The vehicle's engine sound appears to be shared with the regular &lt;a href=\"Stinger\"&gt;Stinger&lt;/a&gt;, both being the same as the &lt;a href=\"Seashark\"&gt;Seashark&lt;/a&gt; sound. Traction is impressive, thanks to the rear-engine, rear wheel drive layout, which sends power directly to the wheels the engine is located upon. Recapping, the Stinger GT has a good top speed, and impressive acceleration. Handling is responsive and reliable, however, braking distance is bad."}

Behind the glass casing on the edges, two circular headlamps can be seen, along with two smaller turn signals below. The bonnet features safety pins and intake ducts finished in black.\nOn the sides, the car features a detail starting from the front wheel arches and ending on the gull-wing doors (one of the first cars in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; to feature this door design), together with black slatted vents bearing the manufacturer emblem and dual exhaust pipes exiting directly in front of the doors on either side. The rear wheels have body plates covering the top quarter of the wheel, named body plating. On the greenhouse area, the car features chrome classic mirrors near the A-pillars and chrome window trim, while the rear features a \"bubble\" window, which distinctively sticks out from the rest of the body work. A fuel cap can be seen on the driver side, near the rear window.\nThe rear of the car is very curved, with a slightly curved license plate to fit in with the rest of the bodywork, just below the manufacturer emblem and between two boot pins. The edges have small rectangular tail lamps and the width of the car is fully protected by a chrome bumper.\nThe vehicle is painted with a primary colour for the bodywork and the stitching, and a secondary colour for the bonnet. The stock wheels are identical to the \"El Jefe\" muscle rims also available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Stirling GT has excellent acceleration and its top speed is decent, falling in the middle between the Roosevelt and most of the other high end sports classics. The handling is incredible, acting less like a Sports Classic and more similarly to some sports cars, with large amounts of grip, meaning oversteer is only present when attempting to conserve too much speed around a corner. Along with the &lt;a href=\"JB%20700\"&gt;JB 700&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roosevelt\"&gt;Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Casco\"&gt;Casco&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Coquette%20Classic\"&gt;Coquette Classic&lt;/a&gt;, the Stirling GT has high resistance to impact deformation. Its responsive handling, especially for Sports Classics, means it is a very good choice for racing in the Sports Classics class on most tracks, though the &lt;a href=\"Z-Type\"&gt;Z-Type&lt;/a&gt; is still a better choice on longer races with fewer corners.\nThe vehicle is stated to be powered by an apparent 3-Liter 310HP V8, which is replicated in the engine bay, as a single-overhead camshaft V8, with 4 double-barrel downdraft carburetors, and side exit, straight-through, twin-dual exhausts. The engine sound is shared with the Casco, and the JB 700 (latter applies to the enhanced version only).\nThe engine sound tends to crackle viciously when decelerating, this is because of its high-rev output, when decelerating, an excessive amount of unbalanced ratios of air and fuel are blown out of the exhaust, causing many consecutive explosions within the exhaust, this is because of its carburetors which don't automatically stop fuel input, and its straight-through exhaust system which doesn't quieten down these explosions. This can be heard prominently &lt;a href=\"https%3A//m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DMUEs43axxkE\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this trait, turbochargers fitted to the car are emphasized much more and the dump valve is much more notable.\nWhen the turbo and transmission are upgraded, the car will viciously shake when accelerated while stationary. This is much more prominent than other high-output cars.\nWith the HSW upgrade applied, the engine note will be much higher-pitched and will have a different exhaust \u2018pop\u2019 sound. \nSpecial Variants.\n\"GTA Online\": Import/Export.\nThree heavily modified variants of the Stirling GT may appear in &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt; source missions.

This makes it the oldest-looking weapon in the game, although it may be a historical reproduction.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nSpeed and reach of the Stone Hatchet is similar to that of comparable melee weapons, particularly to the &lt;a href=\"Hatchet\"&gt;Hatchet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Axe\"&gt;Battle Axe&lt;/a&gt;. Like other axes, it is also usable on bikes. It deals a lot more damage than any other melee weapon.\nIts unique ability is triggering Stone Hatchet Rampage, a rampage mode akin to &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Special%20Ability%23Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Special Ability&lt;/a&gt; after a kill. After killing a player or NPC, the player enters Stone Hatchet Rampage, making them nearly immortal for 12 seconds, which can be lengthened with further kills with the hatchet. It thus allows killing multiple enemies in melee or safely fleeing the area. Originally, the effect also worked when using the hatchet from a bike, making quick hit-and-run charges a more viable tactic. This was patched so it now kicks the player off the bike during Rampage mode. Additionally, switching weapons during Stone Hatchet Rampage immediately ends the ability, making it impossible to attack with other weapons with the ability active.\nWhen Stone Hatchet Rampage ends, the player will have to wait for 60 seconds to reactivate it. During this period, the Hatchet acts as a normal melee weapon.\nStone Hatchet Rampage may only be triggered in free mode, making the Stone Hatchet a mere alternate visual of other axes in other modes such as &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt;."}

There is a damage meter on the top, if the player takes way too long to kill all three members, one of them will throw a &lt;a href=\"Molotov%20Cocktail\"&gt;Molotov Cocktail&lt;/a&gt; into the building, damaging it and filling up the damage meter. If it fills up, the mission will be a failure.

{"id": "2382", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2382", "title": "Stratum", "text": "The Stratum is a four-door station wagon appearing in , , , , , and due to appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto VI&lt;/a&gt;\". It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Zirconium\"&gt;Zirconium&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe design of the Stratum appears to be mostly taken from the , with the addition of painted D-pillars. This, however, contradicts the &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt; setting of the game. This might suggest that the Stratum could also be loosely inspired, in essence, by the , which features a similarly slanted front end, a comparable name, and a fitting production history.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Stratum carries over a similar design from its previous iteration, although its influence is less clear, with its primary inspiration once again seemingly taken from the and, conceptually, the , with a front end derived from the , as seen in the overlapping hood, slim grille design , emblem placement, and headlights. The taillights appear to be modeled after those of the in terms of size, shape, and layout, while the rear end overall could loosely resemble the , particularly in the design of the rear bumper. Furthermore, the lettering position is similar to that of the , with text conceivably inspired by the \"SATURN\" lettering featured on the Saturn SW's rear bumper. The design of the C-pillars might also have been derived from the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Stratum assumes a more streamlined design compared to the &lt;a href=\"Solair\"&gt;Solair&lt;/a&gt;, and it is considered a tuner. The front of the car has a panel between the headlights in place of a regular grille, black details on the doors and around the windows, and small red tail lights on the rear quarters. The gas cap can be seen on the rear right side. The car spawns in a variety of single colors applied on the body.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nRetaining a close overall design from its previous iteration, the Stratum appears more streamlined and sportier compared to the &lt;a href=\"Solair\"&gt;Solair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ingot\"&gt;Ingot&lt;/a&gt;. The front of the car is largely similar, but there are small intakes added beside the number plate and two black strips with front-facing rectangular fog lamps, while the upper area has a small grille and the corresponding badges on the central panel. The sides are largely similar to its previous iteration, but \"ZIRCONIUM\" badges are added on the front portions, between the front arches and the front doors, while the roof features an aerial on the back section. The rear features additional tail lights and yellow reflectors on the rear compartment door, as well as additional Zirconium and 2.6 GT badging above and \"STRATUM\" debossed between the tail lights. The rear bumper features black strips and the number plate on the center, while a single titanium-tipped exhaust pipe can be seen on the driver's side, just below the bumper.\nThe Stratum can be seen either in stock form or with a variety of extras installed on it, being the following:\nThe car is seen in a variety of single colors for the body, and it uses a set of seven-spoke rims with medium-profile tires.\nThe Stratum is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; system with a male voice but only if the player leaves the \"selected cars\" (default) option in the audio menu.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Stratum's design remains unchanged, although the Zirconium badges on both ends change from red to blue. The car also gains an updated interior in the enhanced version, being the \"Feroci\" interior and dial set also used on cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Ingot\"&gt;Ingot&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Intruder\"&gt;Intruder&lt;/a&gt;. The extra exterior components from the \"GTA IV\" iteration were also retained, although there is no option to install or remove these in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops.\nAgain, the car spawns in a variety of single colors on the body and retains the same wheel design, which is also used on the &lt;a href=\"Asterope\"&gt;Asterope&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nAcceleration and speed are surprisingly impressive, considering the Stratum\u2019s size. The drivetrain is front-engine, rear-drive, making the Stratum a good selection as a drive-by vehicle. The body is weak, however, making the car susceptible to intense damage from high-speed impacts and heavy gunfire.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe handling of the Stratum is fairly good, though oversteer can be dramatic at times, and its suspension evens out bumps without being excessively soft. Braking is acceptable, giving the car a good braking time which is helped by its low ride height and small weight. Crash deformation is very good, with the Stratum keeping most of its shape in a collision; engine build quality, however, is less desirable, with the Stratum often left disabled after only a few impacts. Acceleration is rather decent, and has a high top speed, overtaking some other sedans and cars of similar design.\nThe Stratum appears to be powered by an inline-4 with a single turbo fitted (contrary to the optional \"Twin Turbo\" badging seen in models with the spoiler extra), alongside the turbocharger's air filter seen at the bottom right. This engine is coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a RWD configuration. The engine sound is smooth, comparable to that of the &lt;a href=\"Solair\"&gt;Solair&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ingot\"&gt;Ingot&lt;/a&gt;, which are also station wagons.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"GTA V\", the Stratum performs better due to the revamped handling in the game. It also gains more responsive handling, and braking is improved further, although this is still relatively poor compared to other cars in its class. The vehicle is noticeably slightly lighter, as it seems to glide around corners with little understeer. The steering itself, however, feels somewhat heavy and can serve as a handicap to an inexperienced driver.\nAgain the engine is the same turbocharged inline-4 with a 5-speed gearbox. However, it gains an all-wheel-drive layout (40%\u201360%, front to rear torque distribution), and retains the \"Twin Turbo\" badge seen in models with the spoiler extra, despite no changes being made to the engine. The engine sound is rather smooth, appearing to be similar to the one used in the modern &lt;a href=\"Oracle\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Stratum is considered a tuner, and can be upgraded at &lt;a href=\"Wheel%20Arch%20Angels\"&gt;Wheel Arch Angels&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Flats\"&gt;Ocean Flats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe Stratum is part of two codice_1, \"codice_2\" and \"codice_3\". The first set of cars is exclusive to the Stratum, &lt;a href=\"Regina\"&gt;Regina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ingot\"&gt;Ingot&lt;/a&gt;. It isn't very common, but does appear in specific locations which guarantees a 1/3 chance of the Stratum spawning. The Tourist selection of cars is a collection of several low-medium end cars such as the &lt;a href=\"BeeJay%20XL\"&gt;BeeJay XL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Camper%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Camper&lt;/a&gt;, which spawn in specific \"tourist\" locations."}

The wings house the taxi lights beside the engines, the outer ailerons and the inner airbrakes, while the tail/empennage has two flashing red beacons on the tail. The underside has a fixed tricycle undercarriage.\nThe cockpit of the aircraft has a sectioned instrument panel and additional switches above the seats, while the rear section has an open door leading to the cockpit and two long benches (although only two passengers sit on the left).\nThe aircraft's fuselage, wings, tail and landing gear struts are painted with the primary color, while the air data probes around the fuselage, the frame above the rear left door and the overstitches over the instrument panel and around the seats are painted with the secondary color. It uses a set of industrial wheels derived from trucks such as the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with dual machine guns on the nose, which are similar to those from the &lt;a href=\"Tula\"&gt;Tula&lt;/a&gt;, as well as bombs.\nPerformance.\nVehicle.\nThe aircraft possess similar characteristics to planes such as the &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20800\"&gt;Cuban 800&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mogul\"&gt;Mogul&lt;/a&gt;, having a relatively low top speed and decent handling, although the large wingspan can be problematic on areas with tall obstacles. However, true to its real-life inspiration, the plane has STOL (Short Takeoff and Landing) capabilities, requiring relatively short runways in comparison to similarly-sized aircraft. The tricycle undercarriage also provides good stability when taxiing around uneven areas and good ground clearance, enough to keep the propellers safe from certain obstacles. Care should be taken upon exiting from the active aircraft, as there is barely distance between the cockpit doors and the propellers.\nThe aircraft is powered by two engines, given the exhausts on either side of the compartment. However, it uses the same sound from piston-powered aircraft such as the &lt;a href=\"Mammatus\"&gt;Mammatus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Velum\"&gt;Velum&lt;/a&gt;.\nWeaponry.\nMachine Gun: The aircraft can be equipped with dual front-mounted machine guns operated by the pilot, which function similarly to the ones from aircraft such as the &lt;a href=\"Tula\"&gt;Tula&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mogul\"&gt;Mogul&lt;/a&gt;, causing high damage over unarmored vehicles and destroying them in about five seconds. This can be dangerous against most aircraft, as they are less resistant to bullets in general. They also have a maximum range of 250 meters, similar to aircraft like the &lt;a href=\"LF-22%20Starling\"&gt;LF-22 Starling&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"V-65%20Molotok\"&gt;V-65 Molotok&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMachine Gun=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nChange History.\nReleased in ."}

They usually serve a purpose or function, some grant the player with rewards, where as some are purely cosmetic features, which make the game as detailed and as busy as possible, as well as adding realism. \nStreet Accessories in the 3D Universe were uncommon, only the basic additions such as street lights, traffic lights and trash cans existed. In \"\", a large toll-booth exists on the &lt;a href=\"Gant%20Bridge\"&gt;Gant Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. Many of these accessories were nonfunctional, and only some were interactive or destructible. Most trees in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" were unsolid, and the player could walk through them. \nIn the HD Universe, many new accessories are present, things common in large cities like news dispensers were added, most of which are destructible, with a few being interactive, or possessing a unique feature. In \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", things like bus stops and fences would smash upon collision and gun fire, and street lights plunged streets into darkness when knocked over. Fire hydrants would release water when crashed into, and toll booths in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\" required the payment of the player, for permission to cross the bridges. \nMany of the props found in \"GTA V\" are removed in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", likely for online hardware restrictions.\nAccessories.\nUtility Poles.\n are more likely to be used as street accessories that appear in the \"GTA\" series. These poles, however, cannot be knocked over or destroyed by the player. \nTraffic Lights.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe majority of traffic lights in \"GTA IV\" are based on &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.mccain-inc.com/\"&gt;McCain traffic signals&lt;/a&gt;, the iconic yellow-style traffic lights in New York City.\nTraffic lights operate as intended and in accordance with the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic-light_signalling_and_operation\"&gt;United States signalling and operation standards&lt;/a&gt;. When signaled red, traffic will stop, when signaled green, traffic is allowed to move, and when amber, traffic prepares to stop. Traffic lights do not flash amber in any occurrence in-game.\nMost traffic signals can be destroyed, in a similar way to street lights. The main light pole itself can often be broken away from its road mounting, disabling the traffic light and producing sparks. The light will then fall and as a result, each section will break apart. AI traffic will behave as if the traffic light is still functioning and operate as normal.\nTraffic signals hung from a boom are able to swing. They can be seen swinging back and forth in any weather condition, but much faster and aggressively in wind and rainy conditions.\nAll traffic lights systems operate at the same speed and do not consider traffic flow or congestion. A red light will take 10 seconds to change to green, and 12 seconds (including orange) to change back to red.\nVarious traffic light poles also have pedestrian signals attached. These iconic devices are built-in yellow boxes attached to the main pole just above human reach. On the box is a black display featuring a hand and a walking human. The hand will light up red when pedestrians are advised not to cross due to crossing traffic, and the walking human will display white when it is safe to cross.\nThe typical intersection layout varies by location, Algonquin being vastly different from the rest of the city. Small intersections around &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt; usually consist of a single traffic light with the respective number of traffic signals on it, while &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;'s grid system and repetitive string of one-way streets results in the majority of intersections consisting of three traffic lights; two single poles for two-way flowing traffic on the avenue, and a large dual-lane pole for the one-way flowing street.\nAs already noted, traffic behaves as expected with traffic lights, however the advanced level of AI pathing can often cause a variety of notable repercussions often caused or dependent on timing between the signal change and flowing traffic. Fast flowing AI traffic approaching a green-turning-red traffic signal will usually halt at the last minute, but depending on the speed the AI vehicle was travelling, a vehicle which stops after the stop-line often proceeds with their journey having stopped, ignoring the red light. The same occurs in the reverse situation, fast flowing AI traffic approaching a red-turning-green traffic signal will halt and continue. Traffic usually does not become inpatient with long-lasting traffic jams caused by traffic lights and vehicles will not normally jump red lights.\nTaxi drivers who are told to \"hurry up\" by the player will jump red lights, avoiding traffic by simply driving on the other side of the road through the intersection. Distressed pedestrians will also ignore red lights, for example, if they recover a stolen vehicle from the player, or are disturbed by surrounding explosions or gunfire (unless they leave their vehicle). Responding emergency vehicles will ignore traffic lights; however, their responding AI, particularly of &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ambulances&lt;/a&gt; also often causes collisions with other vehicles, pedestrians and road-side props.\nPedestrians will also behave correctly with pedestrian signals. Approaching the crosswalk, they will only cross when the signal displays the white figure, unless distressed, or physically pushed into the road. The white figure displays when the opposing traffic flow does not intersect with the crosswalk, however, due to a minor oversight with signal behavior and limitations, the lack of a turning filter often causes traffic to almost or completely run down pedestrians when turning; this is most notable at box intersections when crossing pedestrians are safe to cross, but turning traffic makes it unsafe. Pedestrians will react to the situation, both parties often insulting each other, before carrying on with their day. This oversight is present on almost every single intersection in Liberty City.\nPedestrians will also hurry quickly when the light begins to flash (indicating that traffic will begin to start). This light flashes at the last 2 seconds of the 12 second window they have to cross.\nThere are 11 different traffic light models in-game.\nTraffic Lights\nPedestrian Lights\nFunctions in \"GTA\".\nTraffic lights.\nTraffic will stop at traffic lights when they are red, sometimes, they will ignore the fact the lights are red, police spotting this will chase them. The player will not receive a wanted level for crossing the red light. Some traffic lights in \"GTA IV\" are misprogrammed and cause the cars to stop at the green light and go at the red light. This glitch is also prominent in \"GTA V\", particularly at situations where a filter light is present, causing traffic to turn out in one direction onto busy roads. Some traffic lights are also turned off in \"GTA V\", such as those around Cypress Flats.\nIn \"GTA V\", in &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;The Big Score (subtle approach)&lt;/a&gt;, the player takes over traffic lights in order to divert the two courses of the team and Merryweather. In \"GTA V\", the pedestrian stop/start walk signs show a man strutting.\nIn most 3D Universe games, the amber light on traffic lights will often start blinking during thunderstorms, indicating the power has been shut off.\nFire Hydrants.\nIn \"GTA IV\" and \"GTA V\", when the player knocks one over, water will dispense and be fired into the air, parking a on-fire car on top of it will put the fire out. Walking over a knocked over fire hydrant whilst water is still firing will cause the player to fall over.\nParking Meters.\nIn ' and ', when knocked over, they will drop money.\nStreet lights.\nIn \"GTA IV\" and \"GTA V\", when they are knocked over, electrical sparks will be shot from the base of the light. The lights-less area will be darkened.\nTollbooths.\nIn \"GTA IV\" and \"\", the player has to stop and pay the booth in order to cross, if not, they will receive a wanted level.\nBus Stops.\nIn \"GTA V\", NPCs can be found sitting in Bus Stops, and when a &lt;a href=\"Bus%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;bus&lt;/a&gt; arrives, they will get on the Bus. They can also be found getting off Buses at Bus Stops. In \"GTA Vice City\", sometimes a bus will spawn next to a bus stop sign with some pedestrians waiting by the sign getting in and some getting off. Tommy can also wait by a bus stop while driving a Coach to get passengers, being rewarded 5 dollars for each one.\nNews Stands.\nIn \"GTA V\", people can be found looking into the boxes placed on the edge of the walkway. They will dispense newspapers when knocked over."}

By default, the front lacks any guard, but can have one through mod shops.\nThe main body is more of less identical to the regular Blazer, but the upper front area has a carbon-fiber detail around the handlebars and fuel cap, while the engine bay features additional frames around the engine, a carbon-fiber detail around the front intercooler and the exhaust pipe on the left side of the engine block. The handlebars lack a central frame and has a black detail on the center, with a set of small gauges using \"Sports Bike\" dials, derived from bikes like the &lt;a href=\"Akuma\"&gt;Akuma&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bati%20800\"&gt;Bati 801&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe rear area is mostly the same as the regular Blazer, but has shortened rear fenders, a backrest, a small rack and long frames holding candle-like turning signals. The vehicle uses a longer swingarm to fit the larger wheels and incorporates an articulated dual frame, passing through the rear simgle suspension shock/spring. The exhaust pipe splits into dual pipes with large colored mufflers.\nColor distribution is reversed from the regular Blazer, where the primary one is applied on the main body, the lower frames, the rear backrest/rack and the exhaust mufflers, while the secondary one is applied on the front section, the side fairings and part of the rear fenders. It uses a set of six-spoke dual rims, wrapped in low-profile tires.\nPerformance.\nThe Street Blazer is a very well-performing vehicle. Top speed is not very high but the acceleration is superb (both forward and backward), and the bike can stop from full speed almost instantly. Despite the slightly extended chassis, handling remains on par with the Blazer and the other variants. The vehicle performs well on the pavement, and is also still a very capable off-road ATV. If the Street Blazer is airborne, it may have trouble with pitching whilst airborne, as it has a bad tendency to shift and move around and if landed incorrectly, the rider may be at risk of being dismounted upon landing.\nThis version of the Blazer is also easier to perform wheelies, although once the wheelie is performed, the player will not be able to wheelie again, as the bike cannot wheelie once it has moderate speed. However on the plus side, the Street Blazer will not throw the player off if the wheelie is pulled back too far; the rear end rack acts like a pseudo-wheelie bar that prevents the player from falling off, so the rider can pull the bike back as far as they wish for as long as they want.\nThe Street Blazer appears to be powered by an upgraded parallel-twin engine, coupled to a 6-speed gearbox and powering all wheels with equal power distribution. It shares the same engine sound from the &lt;a href=\"BF-400\"&gt;BF400&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Manchez\"&gt;Manchez&lt;/a&gt;."}

Unlike the car thieves, if an on-foot police officer sees them committing a crime, they will chase after them. Gang members also don't take kindly to being pick-pocketed and will usually open fire on the thief.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nThe criminals in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;GTA III&lt;/a&gt;\" come in two varieties. One of the criminals looks strikingly similar to members of the &lt;a href=\"Southside%20Hoods\"&gt;Southside Hoods&lt;/a&gt;, except he has a different face texture and wears a brown, teal jacket with grayish stripes and gray pants, as opposed to the Hoods' red or purple jackets. The other criminal wears a hat, a black shirt with white sleeves, and blue \"camo\" shorts and is a white male.\nMuch like in \"GTA 2\", they will steal any civilian or gang vehicle that they can access, including the player's vehicle. They can also be seen pickpocketing &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt; (including each other, although the criminals who have been robbed will strike up their fists and stand) \u2013 who usually run away or chase and fight them. If you point your gun at them, they will give you the &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; that they robbed from the pedestrian.\nLots of them spawn in &lt;a href=\"Hepburn%20Heights\"&gt;Hepburn Heights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wichita%20Gardens\"&gt;Wichita Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, however, they can spawn in any other district usually at night. They never spawn in &lt;a href=\"Cedar%20Grove\"&gt;Cedar Grove&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike in \"GTA 2\", and in later games, however, the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; don't give chase to them, and instead, pedestrians themselves give chase.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nLike in previous games, the criminals in \"\" come in three varieties; one is a black man with a black leather jacket, blue jeans, black gloves, and white sneakers. The other is a white man with a brown leather jacket, blue jeans, and black shoes. The last one, although the rarest of the three, is a Hispanic man, resembling a &lt;a href=\"Pimp\"&gt;Pimp&lt;/a&gt;, with a red leather jacket, black pants with red leather stripes, and a sombrero.\nThe first two bear a resemblance to the &lt;a href=\"Streetwannabe%27s\"&gt;Sharks&lt;/a&gt;, although with cleaner attire. They can often be seen in groups in the &lt;a href=\"North%20Point%20Mall\"&gt;North Point Mall&lt;/a&gt; at night, except for the Hispanic man, in and outside the mall. They really don't rob people of their money, rather, they will steal any civilian vehicle that they can access, including &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;ambulances&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"helicopters\"&gt;helicopters&lt;/a&gt;, and the player's vehicle. They will not attempt to steal motorcycles, scooters, gang cars, vehicles (apart from &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhinos&lt;/a&gt;), or &lt;a href=\"Firetruck%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;fire trucks&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey might even commandeer a &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; or other helicopter if the player lands one near them and waits long enough for one of them to notice the aircraft. However, unlike later games, they won't fly away. Instead, they will drift forwards along the road with the rotor blades spinning. This is the result of the game's engine being unable to implement proper AI for normal NPCs flying helicopters outside of missions. This can become a serious safety hazard, since the blades can severely damage anyone that comes near it, including the player.\nHowever, if a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Officers\"&gt;police officer&lt;/a&gt; sees them car-jacking, or just walking in general, they will attempt to stop them \u2013 the player is rewarded a \"Good Citizen Bonus\" of &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;50, if they choose to help the officer (there is a glitch where the player can repeatedly stomp on the criminal and receive the $50 bonus until the body disappears, even if the criminal is dead). This only applies if the player uses his fists or a melee weapon; if the player discharges firearms under any circumstances near a cop, they will receive a star on their &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;Wanted Level&lt;/a&gt;.\nMembers of the &lt;a href=\"Patrol%20Invest%20Group\"&gt;Patrol Invest Group&lt;/a&gt; also don't take kindly to them and will sometimes try to shoot the street criminals, but only if the street criminals attack them.\nThe cops pursuing them can be up to three officers against one street criminals (more if there are &lt;a href=\"Special%20Weapons%20and%20Tactics\"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; or even the &lt;a href=\"Military\"&gt;Army&lt;/a&gt;) and they will not give up pursuing them unless the &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt; commits a hostile action near a officer pursuing them, and the cops will completely ignore them and immediately turn against Vercetti instead. In fact, all law enforcement in &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt; will pursue them, similar to &lt;a href=\"Gangs\"&gt;gang&lt;/a&gt; members.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe criminals in ' will try to steal any vehicle, including the player's, however they will not steal any law enforcement vehicles. They may have hidden weapons, such as a &lt;a href=\"knife\"&gt;knife&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt;. Like in \"GTA Vice City\", if a police officer sees, they will attempt to stop them. Unfortunately, the player can no longer receive a \"Good Citizen Bonus\" for helping the officer, in fact, the player is more likely to attain a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; by doing so, possibly because it's considered interfering with police affairs. Nevertheless, the police can still be helped by blocking the criminal's car with one's own or bike or even kill the criminals when out of the cops' sight. Just like normal &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt;, criminals will often either compliment or insult &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;CJ&lt;/a&gt;, depending on his appearance. ' has the most criminals out of all the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; games, with a grand total of 9 criminals. Each city has three: a black criminal, a Hispanic criminal, and a white criminal.\nThere are three criminals that can be found mainly in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, but may also appear in other cities. The first one is a black male dressed in a dark blue checkered shirt, a gold chain, forest-green chonglers, and white sneakers, and apparently has been to prison before. The second one is a Hispanic male wearing sunglasses, a plaid tan shirt worn in a \"cholo\" style, khaki pants, and black sneakers. The third one is a &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20Bikers\"&gt;San Andreas Biker&lt;/a&gt;, a white male with sunglasses, a gold chain, fingerless gloves, a leather motorcycle jacket with a gray T-shirt underneath, tan pants, and motorcycle boots. Los Santos criminals are also unique due to the fact that they can spawn during the day, whilst the criminals of San Fierro and Las Venturas tend to appear at night. This could be a representation of the city's high crime rate.\nThere are also three criminals unique to &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;. The first is a black male wearing a white hat, sunglasses, a blue shirt worn in a \"cholo\" style, khaki pants, and white sneakers. The second is a Hispanic male sporting a lilac shirt, a gold necklace, a gold bracelet, black pants, and coffee-coloured shoes, and seems to be of high class. The third one is a white male dressed in a green shirt with black sleeves, jeans, and black-and-grey shoes.\nFinally, there are another three criminals that can be found only in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;. The first is a black male in an olive plaid shirt, grey pants, and grey shoes. The second is a Hispanic male dressed in a blue-and white striped polo shirt with black sleeves, jeans, and grey-and-black sneakers, and appears to resemble &lt;a href=\"T-Bone%20Mendez\"&gt;T-Bone Mendez&lt;/a&gt;. The third and final one is a white male who appears to be a punk rocker, sporting a red mohawk, a customized motorcycle jacket, a grey punk rock T-shirt, tattoo sleeves, ripped jeans, and maroon combat boots. The punk is the rarest of them all, and is very difficult to spot.\n&lt;a href=\"Crack%20Dealers\"&gt;Crack Dealers&lt;/a&gt; can also be seen throughout &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;. They are identifiable by their clothes and their actions. They wear either jeans and a black tank top or a light-grey hooded jacket. They stand in the same place for a long period of time and deal to other pedestrians. They carry a &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt; and a large amount of cash.\nAlthough not necessarily \"criminals\", road ragers are also a fairly common sight in San Andreas, particularly in rural areas. If someone crashes into them, they will exit their vehicle and attempt to fight/kill the other driver. Sometimes, they will be armed with a melee weapon, such as a &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Golf%20Club\"&gt;golf club&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Bat\"&gt;baseball bat&lt;/a&gt;. If they are successful in killing the other driver, they will usually just get back in their car and drive away. Occasionally, a police chase may randomly appear between armed felons in a car and police officers. The armed felons will do a &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by&lt;/a&gt; at the cops during a chase.\nA police chase may also start if a motorist hits a police vehicle whether it be accidental, bad driving, on purpose, poor patience or caused by someone else pushing the car. The police will give chase to whoever hit their car and will attempt to stop them. Once they are stopped, the police will attempt to drag the pedestrian out of his/her car and will open fire on him/her regardless of if they are armed or not. Police will also shoot members of certain gangs on sight unless they are in a vehicle.\nSometimes, a police officer can be seen running after a random NPC (who can be heard screaming and saying things like \"I didn't do it!\" or \"It wasn't me!\"), however, unlike GTA Vice City, when the officer catches up to him/her he will then simply walk away. Strangely, the NPC will still run away screaming.\nRarely, police officers will randomly come out of their &lt;a href=\"Police%20Car\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; and open fire at a street criminal, even if he didn't do anything wrong.\nRandom NPCs may attack an officer for some unknown reason and the officer will take out a pistol and shoot at his attacker. However, the NPC has a chance of gaining a pistol after punching the officer, especially when they knock him into the ground.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nThe criminals in \"\" come in at least two different varieties; one has light skin and wears a grey hooded shirt, a blue jacket and green pants, while the other has dark skin and wears a blue and brown jacket, dark pants and a dark hat.\nA large number of them appear in &lt;a href=\"Bedford%20Point\"&gt;Bedford Point&lt;/a&gt;, although they also appear in other parts of the city. Like in the previous two games, the criminals are often chased by police officers, and the $50 \"Good Citizen Bonus\" for helping the officer to stop the criminal returns having been absent in \"GTA San Andreas\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nIn \"\", there are two varieties of street criminals. One has a vest and T-shirt with trousers. Another one, which is much rarer, sports a hat, a vest and 50's pants. Helping the cops fight the street criminals grants a $50 Good Citizen bonus.\nThey can also be encountered during Taxi missions, requesting to stop at a business for them to rob. No Good Citizen bonus can be received; instead, the player gets a 2 star wanted level.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;GTA IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;cops&lt;/a&gt; are much more vigilant and will try to arrest anyone who commits a crime, including anyone who tries to attack the player. After they have been arrested, the suspect is taken to the nearest law enforcement vehicle, including ones that the player has saved by parking on one of their parking spaces.\nHowever, they tend to simply drive around, instead of taking the criminal to the nearest police station. Some criminals may also try to run away while the officer is escorting them to a police car. If the criminal is armed but not aggressive then the police officer will confiscate the weapon and say things like \"A concealed weapon, huh? That's another crime to add to your sheet.\" or \"Carrying a weapon in this &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; is a felony.\" If the suspect isn't armed, they will be arrested for fraud as the officer will comment \"Whoa, where'd you get all these stolen credit cards from?\". It is possible to get a cop to arrest a prisoner with the use of cheats.\nIf the criminal is armed and aggressive, they will attack the cops and the cops will arm themselves and try to kill the criminal. The cops can also call for some reinforcement, or if there is a shooting between the cops and the street criminals near a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Cop Car&lt;/a&gt; with an officer inside, then the cops inside the car will also go out and shoot at the street criminals.\nIf there is a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;police helicopter&lt;/a&gt; nearby, the helicopter will also stop where the shooting is taking place, although they don't usually shoot and they often tend to crash, certainly meaning that the criminals took the helicopter out of the air.\nLike in \"GTA San Andreas\", if the player tries to help an officer, they are more likely to attain a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, but they can still trip the criminal up and the police will thank the player if done. It is possible that the \"Good Citizen Bonus\" was meant to make a full return, but was &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Content%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;cut&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor some reason, if they see a street vendor attacking the player, they will not arrest them, but instead open fire, despite the fact they don't have any weapons. This also includes &lt;a href=\"Security%20Guards\"&gt;security guards&lt;/a&gt;, bouncers, the clerk at a &lt;a href=\"TW%40\"&gt;TW@&lt;/a&gt;, and the security guard at &lt;a href=\"Perseus\"&gt;Perseus&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nStreet criminals also appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\". They range from random hoods, to gang members and they are always armed with a weapon. When traveling around, a random police pursuit will sometimes occur in the player's vicinity. Police will usually tail the suspects before engaging in a chase with them. Once a chase has been initiated, the criminals will attempt to ditch the cops. Sometimes the player may stumble upon a chase already in progress. If the police smash into the player's vehicle, the player receives a wanted star even though the collision was the fault of the officer, but only if the player was moving at the moment of collision.\nAlso, the player can sometimes come across the aftermath of a police chase, with the criminals engaging in a gunfight with officers. If the criminals crash their vehicle or are boxed in by police, they will exit the vehicle and begin shooting at the police. Since the police use the &lt;a href=\"Cover%20System\"&gt;Cover System&lt;/a&gt; to attack, they usually kill all street criminals at the scene, instead of the other way around (street criminals killing off all cops). However, on a rare occasion, the hoods will kill the officers pursuing them and then flee the scene.\nStreet Criminals also appear as &lt;a href=\"Random%20Events%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;random&lt;/a&gt;, minor enemies of the player in the game. Street Criminals usually appear robbing someone's car or wallet. The player then has the choice to either ignore the street criminals or go after them and beat them to a pulp, or kill them, and then either give back the person's wallet or car or drive away with the person's belongings. They'll appear as red dots on the maps while hostile.\nSome street criminals may also try to steal cars, and kill or beat up other peds who run into their cars or themselves. In the re-release, gang members in hoods are more volatile and will respond to threats more quickly. On a rare occasion, some street criminals may try to steal the player's vehicle.\nBy following any Police Car that have randomly activated their sirens, they will eventually find an NPC criminal and engage in a car chase. This often happens near the &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Row%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Mission Row Police Station&lt;/a&gt; by following any patrol car (sirens off and patrolling). This also works with other patrol cars when the player calls the emergency services on their smartphone.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;GTA Online&lt;/a&gt;\", a &lt;a href=\"Joyrider\"&gt;driver in a black Sentinel XS&lt;/a&gt; is seen driving past the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; in a reckless manner and would either pose as a threat by engaging in a gunfight or run away from the player to avoid combat. The driver can also drive other vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt;, but is always seen driving the black &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20XS\"&gt;Sentinel XS&lt;/a&gt;, and the NPCs for the black Sentinel XS are randomized. The police will also use their megaphone (like they always do) to tell the street criminal to stop their car."}

When the race starts, the players soon have to turn left onto &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20London%20Street\"&gt;Dutch London Street&lt;/a&gt;; barriers and other props are placed on the inside of the corner to prevent sizeable corner cutting. Almost immediately after the turn, the racers have the option to take either the standard route, which continues on Dutch London Street, or a shortcut leading past the &lt;a href=\"Rancho%20Towers\"&gt;Rancho Towers&lt;/a&gt; monument. Players taking the normal route have to turn left onto &lt;a href=\"Carson%20Avenue\"&gt;Carson Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, after which the two routes link up.\nThe players continue down a short straight section on Carson Avenue, followed by a right turn onto &lt;a href=\"Roy%20Lowenstein%20Boulevard\"&gt;Roy Lowenstein Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; and a turn onto &lt;a href=\"Macdonald%20Street\"&gt;Macdonald Street&lt;/a&gt; at the next junction. This area features another shortcut, as the racers can turn into a narrow alleyway while still on Carson Avenue; the paths join on Macdonald Street. All of the players continue down the entirety of this road, after which they turn right onto &lt;a href=\"Little%20Bighorn%20Avenue\"&gt;Little Bighorn Avenue&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe route then continues around a factory in an anticlockwise fashion, after which the racers head back down Little Bighorn Avenue, passing underneath the &lt;a href=\"Innocence%20Boulevard\"&gt;Innocence Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; bridge, shortly followed by a tight left-hand turn onto Jamestown Street. They race down the windy portion of this street, after which they turn right onto Macdonald Street; alternatively, the players can briefly turn onto Innocence Boulevard at the first junction on Jamestown Street, and then into a winding alleyway leading onto Macdonald Street, serving as the third and last shortcut of the track.\nSoon after, the racers turn left onto Roy Lowenstein Boulevard after passing the railway tracks, followed soon by another left-hand turn, where the players once again pass the railway tracks and continue down Carson Avenue. At the next junction, the players turn right and continue down Jamestown Street to the start/finish line."}

The racers continue down this avenue for a short while, after which they turn right onto &lt;a href=\"North%20Rockford%20Drive\"&gt;North Rockford Drive&lt;/a&gt; and then right again at the following junction. \nPlayers continue on &lt;a href=\"Red%20Desert%20Avenue\"&gt;Red Desert Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, followed by a left turn onto Bay City Avenue at checkpoint 7. They briefly race on this downward slopping road, before turning left onto &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20Avenue\"&gt;San Andreas Avenue&lt;/a&gt; and then back onto North Rockford Drive soon after.

All players then continue onto Bay City Avenue, shortly after which the racers turn left onto Boulevard Del Perro.

The racers continue north and then turn right onto &lt;a href=\"Pyrite%20Avenue\"&gt;Pyrite Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, at the end of which they turn right and briefly continue south down the &lt;a href=\"Route%201\"&gt;Great Ocean Highway&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, the players can utilise a shortcut by turning into &lt;a href=\"Red%27s%20Machine%20Supplies\"&gt;Red's Machine Supplies&lt;/a&gt; from Paleto Boulevard and then coming straight onto the highway, omitting the drive down Pyrite Avenue.\nAt the next checkpoint, they already turn off the highway and continue on &lt;a href=\"Duluoz%20Avenue\"&gt;Duluoz Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, before turning left onto Paleto Boulevard at the following junction. The next stretch of road is shared with a previous section of the circuit, so racers may have to watch out for other, oncoming players. The route continues to the end of this boulevard, after which the players have to turn back onto the highway at checkpoint 10. Part of the highway route that follows is yet again shared with another part of the route. \nAt checkpoint 14, the players turn into the &lt;a href=\"Clucking%20Bell%20Farms\"&gt;Clucking Bell Farms&lt;/a&gt;, where they race around the back of a building and through the car park in front, before coming back onto the highway at checkpoint 19. Here, they can choose between the normal route and another shortcut. The traditional route leads them onto Procopio Drive and then down Paleto Boulevard once they turn left at a junction. If players opt for the shortcut, they drive through the construction site in the north of Paleto Bay and then continue on Paleto Boulevard. Immediately afterwards, another shortcut allows the players to turn right, drive through the car park of &lt;a href=\"Willie%27s%20Supermarket\"&gt;Willie's Supermarket&lt;/a&gt;, and then jump down onto Procopio Drive. Racers not making use of this shortcut continue slightly further down Paleto Boulevard until checkpoint 23, when they turn right onto &lt;a href=\"Cascabel%20Avenue\"&gt;Cascabel Avenue&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the end of this road, these racers turn left onto Procopio Drive, merging with those who used the shortcut, coming from further up the road. All racers then continue south-west until reaching the start/finish line."}

Head down to the indicated location. At the &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20Bay%20Bridge\"&gt;Dukes Bay Bridge&lt;/a&gt; toll booth bunches of enemies are surrounding Heston's squad.

They can also be seen driving their &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Burrito\"&gt;Gang Burrito&lt;/a&gt; (the vehicle of the second generation of the Gang). It is suggested that they are involved in arms smuggling and drug trafficking. They seem to be on bad terms with The&lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Bikers\"&gt;Bikers&lt;/a&gt;. They even stole &lt;a href=\"Mitch%20Baker\"&gt;Mitch Baker's&lt;/a&gt; prized motorcycle and stored it in a garage in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Downtown&lt;/a&gt; Vice City.

They are usually seen wearing denim jackets and jeans.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nDuring the events of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\", the gang was known as \"The Sharks\" and had many turfs around &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Beach\"&gt;Vice City Beach&lt;/a&gt;. They manage a number of drugs, smuggling, robbery and extortion businesses which &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;Victor Vance&lt;/a&gt; can take over. The Sharks continue to attack &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;Victor&lt;/a&gt; until all their businesses were taken. They often hunt Victor in their &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Rancher\"&gt;Gang Rancher&lt;/a&gt;s (the vehicle of the first generation of the Gang) and sometimes try to destroy his empire sites. They are seen wearing brightly coloured tracksuits, light brown or grey pants and berets. Their hats has a shark fin symbol on them.

The Sharks will also shoot at members of the Vance Crime Family. During empire attacks, they wield incredibly powerful weapons, such as SMGs and Assault Rifles, which can kill the player in seconds, making the Sharks the most dangerous gang to deal with in &lt;a href=\"Empire%20Building\"&gt;Empire Building&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, after Victor has took over all of their buildings, they will stop attacking him and they will be neutral to him.

His appearance is different from other gang members; like the white members, he has a dragon patch on the back of his jacket and has a fuschia belt. The Streetwannabe's leader's main weapon is the &lt;a href=\"Ruger\"&gt;Ruger&lt;/a&gt; assault rifle, which he used in the missions &lt;a href=\"The%20Chase\"&gt;The Chase&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Phnom%20Penh%20%2786\"&gt;Phnom Penh '86&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point he joined the Streetwannabe's street gang and, by &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;, became the gang's leader. Nothing is known about his life before 1986, except that he is an associate of &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz\"&gt;Ricardo Diaz&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nThe leader stole 3% of profit he was making from working with &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz\"&gt;Ricardo Diaz&lt;/a&gt;. In turn, Diaz &lt;a href=\"The%20Chase\"&gt;sends&lt;/a&gt; Tommy Vercetti to find the leader and find out where he and his associates are hiding. As Tommy arrives at the leader's apartment, he gets spotted by him and a rooftop chase ensues, during which the leader tries shooting Tommy multiple times. Eventually the two get off the rooftops and the leader gets picked up by an associate of his in a &lt;a href=\"BF%20Injection\"&gt;BF Injection&lt;/a&gt;. Tommy continues chasing the leader through the streets of &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt; and follows the leader to his gang's hideout in the abandoned mansions previously owned by the &lt;a href=\"Mendez%20Cartel\"&gt;Mendez Brothers&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Prawn%20Island\"&gt;Prawn Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter finding out where the leader and his gang are hiding, Diaz &lt;a href=\"Phnom%20Penh%20%2786\"&gt;tasks&lt;/a&gt; Vercetti and &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Vance\"&gt;Lance Vance&lt;/a&gt; to initiate an air attack on the Streetwannabe's hideout, which Diaz calls a \"fortress on ground level\". The duo raid the hideout by shooting all Streetwannabe's on sight with an &lt;a href=\"M60\"&gt;M60&lt;/a&gt; mounted on a &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;. As the assault on his hideout goes on successfully, the leader climbs onto the roof of the east most mansion with a portion of the few men he had left and tries taking down Vercetti and Vance's helicopter, before being gunned down by Vercetti.

On the lower area of the front, the car has a trapezium-shaped meshed intake with a license plate on the centre, along with smaller intakes on the outer sides with a black horizontal separation and a circular fog lamp on the upper outer corners. On the upper area, the car bears a chrome grille with three horizontal elements and the Benefactor emblem on the centre, while the outer edges house a set of circular headlamps over black sections, L-shaped strips on the lower inner sides and small turn signals on the outer sides, with chrome separations on the units. The bonnet is relatively simple and has elevated portions running from either side of the grille to the base of the cabin A-pillars.\nOn the sides, the car has black fender arches extending further from the body, as well as chrome strips at the bottom of the side skirts. There is a body line starting from the outer edges of the headlamps and run towards the outer edges of the tail lamps, passing above the chrome horizontal door handles. The greenhouse area features chrome trims around the side windows and black trim on the windscreen and inner pillars, along with square-shaped mirrors whose lower halves are finished in black. The roof area features two chrome rails separating the panel from the rest of the car.\nThe rear of the car is predominated by the compartment door, which features a roof spoiler above the rear window and two black sections beside it, while the area below the window is occupied by the Benefactor badge on the centre reused from the XLS and the license plate. The middle section houses the tail lamps, with the outer ones being the main/turning lamps and the inner ones the brake/reverse lamps. The lower area is occupied by the bumper, which houses two red reflectors on the rear quarters, a black bottom diffuser with four separations and two mouldings on the edges for the exhaust tubes. As expected from an off-road vehicle, the underside has sump guards on both ends protecting the axles, as well as red suspension springs for the wheels.\nThe interior of the car is shared with vehicles like the Schafter and the &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt;, but there are protruding details around the dials and some of the warning lights are located within the same gauges. The steering wheel bears the Benefactor logo on the horn cap.\nThe primary colour of the vehicle is applied on the bodywork and the interior stitching, while the secondary one is applied on the lower portions of the front, the portion of the skirts behind the chrome strips and the roof panel. Its stock rims appear to be a derivative of the \"Benefactor\" SUV rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, but lacks the detail on the centre and has riveted details on the surrounding, wrapped in high-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\nDue to the off-road nature of the Streiter\u2019s design, the performance is sub-par for its class, having increased weight and lowered top speed as a result. And although durable, it is not recommended for racing, as even off-road rally cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Omnis\"&gt;Omnis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"GB200\"&gt;GB200&lt;/a&gt; can easily out-perform the Streiter. Another downside from the vehicle is that it has lower ramming capabilities compared to off-road dedicated vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Kamacho\"&gt;Kamacho&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent\"&gt;Insurgent&lt;/a&gt;, limiting its purpose for cruising around uneven terrain. However, it generally has good stability and does not flip easily.\nThe Streiter is powered by a single-cam V8 engine, coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a front engine, all wheel drive layout with equal torque distribution. The engine sound appears to be an edited variation of the one used in the &lt;a href=\"XLS\"&gt;XLS&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Stanier\"&gt;Stanier&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, using additional effects derived from the &lt;a href=\"Schafter%20V12\"&gt;Schafter V12&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Schafter%20LWB\"&gt;Schafter LWB&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nightshark\"&gt;Nightshark&lt;/a&gt; when idle. Due to the loud effects, the base engine sound can be heard quite clearly on higher revolutions."}

Because of the use of effects, the latter will appear too bright for one to identify, unless they view it through the Stretch's tinted windscreens, or through inspection of internal files.\n\"GTA IV\"s Stretch also features durable windows (particularly side windows) unlike most other cars in the game - they can withstand a significant amount of gunfire before shattering. The Stretch comes in numerous tones of white of black. The vehicle will make an audible &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features\"&gt;door ajar&lt;/a&gt; sound if a door is open. It can be heard clearly in quiet areas with the volume turned up.\nThe Stretch is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; system with a female voice, but only if the player leaves the \"selected cars\" (default) option in the audio menu.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn and , it is the limo variant of the &lt;a href=\"Albany\"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Washington\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, which is based on the . The car appears with an unknown dark window tint applied by default.\nThe rear interior of the vehicle retains the design of the original interior in \"GTA IV\" and is not changed in the enhanced version of \"GTA V\". The television screen from \"GTA IV\" is removed.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nBeing a large, multi-passenger vehicle with an extended drive axle due to its length, it has a rear wheel drive layout. Exceptions are the \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Vice City\" variants which are front wheel drive, therefore, not requiring an extended drive axle and performing better in terms of acceleration and hill climbing. Its length makes it difficult to maneuver through tight spaces and around corners at high speed, and its suspension is too soft, contributing to body roll. Although it may be prone to body roll, the soft suspension also guarantees a very comfortable ride on potholed roads. Its ability to absorb damage is not particularly impressive either, making the Stretch more of a specific-use vehicle, or a status-grabber, and a generally poor choice for primary transportation, or for evading cops. Unfortunately, it can only fit three passengers, and thus cannot be used to transport extra gang members in, like the &lt;a href=\"Coach\"&gt;Coach&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bus%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Bus&lt;/a&gt; can.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Stretch's performance is a somewhat downgrade from the 3D Universe rendition. Due to it being based on the &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Admiral&lt;/a&gt;, an already heavy vehicle, it is a very heavy limousine and therefore its acceleration is inferior. Its long wheelbase also proves it hard to corner, slowing down for corners is vital. The durability is an improvement thanks to its bulky design and reinforced windows. The low-profile body design also makes it less of a target to enemies.\nLike the Admiral, the Stretch is powered by what appears to be a V8, as suggested by the engine cover, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. Its sound is similar to that of the Admiral, as well as many luxury sedans.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Stretch's performance seems unchanged from the \"GTA IV\" version, except that the vehicle has somewhat better handling, due to the reduced mass. Its top speed is reduced slightly, and acceleration is reduced significantly, even despite the retained drive system and less mass. Gear shifts are slightly higher, thus giving the car less potential in terms of acceleration.\nVariants.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nHow to Obtain the White-black Stretch.\nA white limousine was featured on &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20Talk%20Radio\"&gt;WCTR&lt;/a&gt;, \"Sensationalist Bullshit\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nPink.\nIn the enhanced version of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", it is possible to find a Stretch with a unique pink color. This particular model can only be seen parked in a single location and is not found in traffic.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nIn the enhanced version of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", there are two variants of the Stretch with custom license plates \"DIAMOND1\" and \"DIAMOND2\". The first one is a white and black version used in the &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Work\"&gt;Casino Work&lt;/a&gt; mission &lt;a href=\"High%20Rollin%27\"&gt;High Rollin'&lt;/a&gt; and the second one is an all-black version provided as a transport when the player requests the \"Limousine Services\" option by calling to &lt;a href=\"Agatha%20Baker\"&gt;Agatha Baker&lt;/a&gt;. Both versions have tinted windows and Xenon lights.\nLocations.\nThe Stretch is only used in a few missions, and is usually found in the more affluent areas in each city."}

He was a senior member of the &lt;a href=\"Chamberlain%20Gangster%20Families\"&gt;Chamberlain Gangster Families&lt;/a&gt; and a former friend of &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe is portrayed by &lt;a href=\"Hassan%20Johnson\"&gt;Hassan Johnson&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nHarold Joseph was born in Los Santos and joined the Chamberlain Gangster Families at a young age. He eventually worked his way up through the ranks and became a senior and respected veteran \"OG\" member within the gang, also earning his nickname \"Stretch\". He also became friends with up-and-coming members &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;. However, Franklin developed an antagonistic relationship with Stretch, presumably due to his bad influence over Lamar, and his reckless and selfish behavior. Lamar, however, idolized Stretch from a young age.\nAt some point prior to &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, Stretch was arrested and taken to &lt;a href=\"Bolingbroke%20Penitentiary\"&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt; for an unknown crime that he presumably committed for the CGF. While in prison, Stretch betrayed the Families and began associating with the Ballas instead.\nStretch has a child with &lt;a href=\"Renatta%20Sidwell\"&gt;Renatta Sidwell&lt;/a&gt;, his ex-girlfriend, who posts a message on &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader/Harold%20Joseph\"&gt;his Lifeinvader&lt;/a&gt; after his release from prison critical that he hasn't been to visit her or \"the little one\", implying he is shirking his paternal responsibility.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nNear the beginning of the events of \"Grand Theft Auto V\", Stretch is released from prison for crimes which are never revealed, and Lamar plans a sort of reunion for himself, Stretch and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt;. The trio &lt;a href=\"The%20Long%20Stretch\"&gt;first meet&lt;/a&gt; at the front of &lt;a href=\"Clinton%20Residence\"&gt;Franklin's house&lt;/a&gt;, where Franklin and Stretch both exchange insults/crude jokes and nearly get into a fight with each other; Lamar questions why they can't ever get along.\nAfter passing by a &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;gunshop&lt;/a&gt;, they go to a &lt;a href=\"Rogers%20Salvage%20and%20Scrap\"&gt;factory&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"La%20Puerta\"&gt;La Puerta&lt;/a&gt; for a drug deal with Ballas gang member &lt;a href=\"D\"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arrival, a friendly conversation quickly goes awry when D becomes hostile with Franklin and Lamar, which further worsens when the crew realize the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; have arrived to kill them as revenge for D being &lt;a href=\"Chop%20%28mission%29\"&gt;kidnapped by Lamar and Franklin earlier&lt;/a&gt;. Stretch, in anger, shoots and kills D; after this, the trio then begin to escape the factory. They enter a shootout with the Ballas and kill them all, but upon getting out of the factory, the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; have arrived, leading to a car chase. However, the trio lose the cops, and drive back to Franklin's house.\nSome time later, Stretch tells Lamar &lt;a href=\"Hood%20Safari\"&gt;to buy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"drugs\"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt; from a gangster in &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt;. However, Franklin and &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; unexpectedly come to the deal as well, and thanks to Trevor, it is revealed that the drugs are fake and that they were going to be scammed if it wasn't for Trevor interfering. Some Ballas members are also waiting to attack them after the failed deal. Franklin, Lamar and Trevor kill all the gangsters and manage to shake off the police yet again. If Franklin escapes with Lamar, he will tell Lamar on the way home that Stretch set them up.\nStretch eventually convinced Lamar to go off on his own to the Ballas &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Forest%20Sawmill\"&gt;hideout&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt; and tell the Ballas that they are willing to sell drugs, as this would be a sort of a money making and peace making opportunity. In reality, this was a set up and &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Down\"&gt;Lamar ended up getting kidnapped by the Ballas&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, after being convinced by &lt;a href=\"Tanisha%20Jackson\"&gt;Tanisha&lt;/a&gt;, Franklin, with the help of his new criminal partners &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Down\"&gt;assault the sawmill, kill all the Ballas, and rescue Lamar.&lt;/a&gt; While on the way back home, the two have a small dispute during which Franklin attempts to convince Lamar to leave his gangbanging, crime-ridden lifestyle, and get a real job. Franklin also tells Lamar about how Stretch hooked up with the Ballas during his time in prison, and that Stretch was the one setting them up the entire time.\nEnding.\nBy the end of the game, Franklin is given separate orders by &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Haines\"&gt;Steve Haines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt; to kill one of his friends. Haines wants him to kill Trevor and Weston wants him to kill Michael. The player then has to choose between carrying out Haines' instructions, carrying out Weston's, or disregarding them both and getting together with both Trevor and Michael to take out their enemies.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nEnding C=\nThe Third Way.\nFranklin contacts Lester and asks him for help on figuring out what to do. Lester initially suggests killing both Trevor and Michael, but eventually comes up with a better way to solve the problem. He lures Haines' corrupt FIB allies and Weston's private Merryweather batallion to a &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Banks%20Steel%20Foundry\"&gt;foundry&lt;/a&gt; where the three protagonists ambush and kill all of them, stripping both Haines and Weston of their brute force power. They give a call to &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester&lt;/a&gt;, who tells them the current locations of their targets. Michael will agree to assassinate Stretch, due to his lack of any association with him. Stretch will be hanging out with a &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; crew, in the basketball court at the &lt;a href=\"BJ%20Smith%20Recreational%20Center\"&gt;BJ Smith Recreational Center&lt;/a&gt;, talking about Franklin and Lamar. Michael interrupts the conversation, telling Stretch that he's got a message from his \"homies\"; Stretch figures out that Michael is a friend of Franklin and orders the Ballas to kill Michael, but ultimately Stretch and the Ballas are all killed. Immediately after completing his job, Michael calls the others, stating that Stretch \"ain't a problem no more.\"\nEnding A or B=\nSomething Sensible/The Time's Come.\nIf Franklin chooses either A or B, he will receive a phone call from Lamar, who informs him that he has finally cut ties with Stretch, having agreed with Franklin's warning after thinking about what he'd said after rescuing him, Franklin wishes him the best and asks him out to hang out some time, Lamar agrees but not before hanging up, after telling Franklin that he is laying low for the time being (which is assumed that Stretch survived the game and will probably come looking for Lamar).\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nAftermath of The Third Way.\nLos Santos Shepherd Newspaper \"\"A notorious member of the &lt;a href=\"Chamberlain%20Gangster%20Families\"&gt;Chamberlain Gangster Families&lt;/a&gt; gang was killed yesterday, only months after he released on parole. &lt;a href=\"Stretch%20%28character%29\"&gt;Harold OG Stretch&lt;/a&gt; was shot while playing &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt;. No witnesses have come forward. Mr. Joseph was unmarried.\"\"\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nFrom his appearances, Stretch is shown to be an extremely murderous, violent, brutal, bloodthirsty, sadistic, selfish, reckless, cold-blooded and trigger-happy gangster, who for some reason, shows a very strong mutual dislike towards fellow gangster &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; and the two frequently argue, leaving &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar&lt;/a&gt; to pick a side, however most of the times Lamar tries to stay neutral to their conflict and tries to resolve their issues.\nThe possible reason for Franklin's dislike of Stretch could be due to Stretch trying to pull Franklin into the life that put him in &lt;a href=\"Bolingbroke%20Penitentiary\"&gt;jail&lt;/a&gt; in the first place, and also due to Stretch's selfish personality and his routine gangbanging life, while Stretch appears to dislike Franklin due to his attempts to leave the hood and make something real for himself as well as for skepticisms and his doubts about the deals they make and that Lamar and Stretch should also leave the hood and get some jobs which won't get them killed in the process.\nHe appears to have a very short temper, assaulting Franklin for poking fun at him for \"dropping the soap\" in prison, and is also very merciless as shown when he immediately, and without hesitation, shoots an unarmed &lt;a href=\"D\"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt; twice in the face when he discovered that he had betrayed them.\nIn spite of his recklessness, Stretch is also very deceitful and manipulative, as shown when he secretly defected from the &lt;a href=\"Families\"&gt;Families&lt;/a&gt; to the Ballas in prison, feigned loyalty to the Families while he was actually a traitor (unbeknownst to most) and several times used his influence on Lamar to manipulate him and try to make him think that Franklin is a snitch and to make deals with the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; which are actually set-ups for Franklin and Lamar to be killed. After the shootout at the scrapyard in The Long Stretch, he pins the blame on Franklin and Lamar for killing D and the Ballas, even though he too participated in the shootout and was the one who shot D to start with.\nAppearance.\nStretch is a short, bulky man with numerous tattoos covering his body. He wears usual CGF clothes including a white T-shirt, blue shorts, a black \"SA\" hat with a green bill, black sneakers with green laces, a lime green watch, and a silver chain. He has no hair at all."}

As with the standard Schafter, the C-pillar and taillight shape are derived from the and the fascia resembles the .\nDesign.\nThe Stretch E features a slightly different front grille and front bumper than the stock Schafter, being based on the &lt;a href=\"Schafter%23Special%20Variants\"&gt;unused base model&lt;/a&gt; rather than &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt;'s customized version. Like the base model, it features quad exhausts, while the customized model only has two. The Stretch E features the same wheel design as the first generation Schafter.\nWhile sharing the same name as the &lt;a href=\"Stretch\"&gt;Stretch&lt;/a&gt;, the Stretch E looks less luxurious, as it lacks any additions aside two more seats in the rear compartment. It also lacks lights on the sides of the doors. \nThe Stretch E is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; system with a female voice, but only if the player leaves the \"selected cars\" (default) option in the audio menu.\nPerformance.\nThe Stretch E has slightly better performance than the TBOGT Schafter, having impressive acceleration (which, for a vehicle of its weight and size, is incredible) and a high top speed. The vehicle has nimble cornering, yet oversteer is present, but the steering radius is still impressive and allows the vehicle to corner tightly, when taking into account its length. Its weight does not prove much of a problem, and braking does not fail badly unless under immense pressure at high speeds.\nThe engine sound is much different from its standard Schafter counterpart, whereby it now sounds lower revving, possibly even a downgraded configuration. The engine cover appears to be loosely based on a V8 cover.

But some might appear after playing/Replaying the aforementioned mission for some limited time, even if the player abandons the car for the mission. After completing the mission, the player can just simply drive it to a &lt;a href=\"Luis%27%20Apartment\"&gt;safehouse&lt;/a&gt; and save. Then the Stretch E will stay in the space."}

The shopfront of strip clubs have often appeared in some form, either as part of street scenery, particularly in red-light districts, or as an interactive locale, complete with interiors and even the ability to pay for a strip club's facilities.\nStrip clubs have appeared in mostly all games of the (with exception of \"\" and ), but only accessible in , , , , , and .\nPrior to the release of \"Grand Theft Auto V\", however, they function more like bikini bars as their dancers do not actually strip, until the release of \"GTA V\", where they do strip.\n2D Universe.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\".\nStrip clubs appeared in the original \"Grand Theft Auto\", and were even mentioned during certain missions but, like most establishments in the 2D universe, can not be accessed.\n3D Universe.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nThe game features a strip club known as &lt;a href=\"Luigi%27s%20Sex%20Club%207\"&gt;Luigi's Sex Club 7&lt;/a&gt;, owned by &lt;a href=\"Luigi%20Goterelli\"&gt;Luigi Goterelli&lt;/a&gt;, but it can not be accessed.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nThe only strip club in \"GTA Vice City\" is &lt;a href=\"The%20Pole%20Position%20Club\"&gt;The Pole Position Club&lt;/a&gt;, which, following &lt;a href=\"Shakedown%20%28GTA%20Vice%20City%29\"&gt;Shakedown&lt;/a&gt;, may be purchased by the player. In addition to open stages (which are primarily populated by conventional &lt;a href=\"pedestrian\"&gt;pedestrian&lt;/a&gt; models), the Pole Position offers backroom dances by a stripper, which the player may pay by the minute (&lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;5 every 5 game minutes) to watch. By spending a total of $300 on the dances, the player will complete the club's asset mission, allowing the player to acquire money from the club from this point on, and it will drop $4000 each day. The stockier backroom stripper is also replaced by a slimmer and more scantly-clad counterpart.\nIn addition, once the club's asset mission is completed, another backroom of the club is opened. Upon entering this room, a cutscene is activated showing a more animated stripper dressed in a cowgirl theme dancing for &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt;. Before this room is unlocked, the room is closed, with a sign reading \"No Entry - Management Only\" posted on the door. The stripper in this room is rumored to be one of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Twins\"&gt;twins&lt;/a&gt; mentioned in the game's manual. The other is a bartender in &lt;a href=\"Malibu%20Club\"&gt;Malibu Club&lt;/a&gt; after that asset is bought.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\n\"GTA San Andreas\" offers the player an expanded number of strip clubs dotted around &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;: four in total, not including &lt;a href=\"Jizzy%27s%20Pleasure%20Domes\"&gt;Jizzy's Pleasure Domes&lt;/a&gt;, which is only accessible in game during the mission &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Cold%20Killa\"&gt;Ice Cold Killa&lt;/a&gt;. The accessible strip clubs include:\nEach strip club comes with one of two different interiors depending on their location and size; The Pig Pen and the Old Venturas Strip Strip Club, both larger inner city strip clubs, feature a spacious variation, while smaller strip clubs, including The Big Spread Ranch and Nude Strippers Daily, use a more compact interior.\nIn all strip clubs in the game, the player may receive a private dance in a backroom for $100 (only one dancing animation is featured), or throw $20 worth of money at dancing strippers in public area, prompting them to execute increasingly erotic dance moves. In addition, the clubs are typically protected by security; any unruly behavior by the player (such as jumping onto a stripper's stage, attacking any individuals or simply firing a gun) will prompt security guards to react aggressively against the player, resulting in the player being unable to use any of the club's facilities as long as the player is inside. It should also be noted that guards constantly respawn, so the player will not be able to clear the clubs.\nThe private dances go into three levels of dance sessions. Each one has a different dancer with different moves:\nAlso, the music collection only consists of three songs that play in the main areas and private rooms of all strip clubs. Two of the songs are from &lt;a href=\"CSR%20103.9\"&gt;CSR 103.9&lt;/a&gt; and the other is from &lt;a href=\"Bounce%20FM\"&gt;Bounce FM&lt;/a&gt;.

Upgrading a &lt;a href=\"Protection%20Racket%20%28business%29\"&gt;Protection racket&lt;/a&gt; site to high roller status transform the building into a strip club, where a dancer can be seen performing inside. The dancer cannot be interacted with, and will continue to dance even when the player jumps on stage to her.\nHD Universe.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and \"Episodes from Liberty City\".\nThere are strip clubs in \"GTA IV\", but only &lt;a href=\"The%20Triangle%20Club\"&gt;The Triangle Club&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Honkers%20Gentlemen%27s%20Club\"&gt;Honkers Gentlemen's Club&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt; are accessible to the players. The others are the &lt;a href=\"Pillows%20Club\"&gt;Pillows Club&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Cerveza%20Heights\"&gt;Cerveza Heights&lt;/a&gt; (under the &lt;a href=\"Huntington%20Street%20Station\"&gt;subway station&lt;/a&gt;), and the &lt;a href=\"Beechwood%20Strip%20Joint\"&gt;Beechwood Strip Joint&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Wenrohronon%20Avenue\"&gt;Wenrohronon Avenue&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Beechwood%20City\"&gt;Beechwood City&lt;/a&gt;.\nMusic selection differs in the \"GTA IV\" strip clubs this time. In The Triangle Club, &lt;a href=\"The%20Vibe%2098.8\"&gt;The Vibe 98.8&lt;/a&gt; playlist will play in the main area (albeit without commercials) while Honkers plays the &lt;a href=\"Electro-Choc\"&gt;Electro-Choc&lt;/a&gt; playlist but in \"\" (disc version) Electro-Choc will play in both clubs. In the case of private dances however, there are three songs for each dance session. This applies in both strip clubs.\nWhile dancers in open areas are no longer interactive in the same degree as in \"GTA San Andreas\", players still have access to backroom lapdances, which have been improved to reward players who incrementally pay with increasingly erotic dancing. There is also more variation in the types of dancers available. Instead of walking into a marker for the dances, there are strippers who will walk up to the player and ask if they want a dance or not. There are three levels in this system:\nStrippers in the strip clubs will sometimes wear garters (bands of elastic cloth; usually worn around the thigh by exotic dancers and strippers). If one looks closely at the dollar bills stuffed into the garter, they are seen to be 69 dollar bills, another innuendo by &lt;a href=\"Rockstar\"&gt;Rockstar&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"69\"&gt;69&lt;/a&gt; sex position. Strip clubs in \"GTA IV\" may also be used as a place for players to bring their &lt;a href=\"Friendships%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;friends&lt;/a&gt; (or even &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;girlfriend&lt;/a&gt;, depending on their taste) to during outings, but requires the player \"enjoy themselves\" by paying for at least one private dance. Like in \"GTA San Andreas\", security guards are present in strip clubs, watching for disruptive behavior and preparing to react to troublemakers a hostile manner; a strip club's operations will also cease if the player chooses to run amok in the vicinity. Similarly if the player lacks money and asks for lapdances regardless, the dance session will continue but end with the dancer(s) running out of the room screaming, followed by security attacking the player and the player gaining a wanted level. If Niko has a friend such as &lt;a href=\"Roman\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; at the strip club, he will help fight the &lt;a href=\"Security%20Guards\"&gt;Security Guards&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to enter a strip club, the player must be disarmed. There is a glitch in the &lt;a href=\"PS3\"&gt;PS3&lt;/a&gt; version in which if Niko goes into the Triangle Club alone and partakes in a private dance, the dancer may run away after the dance and security guards will attack, regardless of whether the player has drawn a weapon or not.\nIf the player goes to the strip clubs on Valentine's Day, some of the strippers will be wearing red and white heart-shaped pasties and will have hearts on the front of their thongs.\nIn the DLC \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\", the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20MC%20Clubhouse\"&gt;Lost MC Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; safehouse occasionally has a woman pole dancing on a stage, using similar dance moves than those scripted for stage dancers in the strip clubs. Johnny cannot interact with these dancers.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nStrip Clubs in \"GTA V\" have been upgraded since \"GTA IV\". There is only one player-accessible club in the game; it is located in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and known as the &lt;a href=\"Vanilla%20Unicorn\"&gt;Vanilla Unicorn&lt;/a&gt;. It offers things such as new and improved lap dances (but without the previous feature of lap dance music), where the dancers are fully naked except from panties, the ability to throw money at the strippers, and the ability to actually be thrown out by the bodyguards. When having the private dance, the player can choose to flirt with the and/or touch the stripper while trying to make sure the guard can't see them. Doing either of these things raises the stripper's personal like bar. If it reaches the top, the player can choose to take them home, or receives the ability to get a double dance.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\", when &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hang%20Ten\"&gt;takes over&lt;/a&gt; the Vanilla Unicorn, he receives free dances from all the girls at the club. The no touching rule no longer applies to any of the 3 characters after this point, so players can touch the girls as much as they like, even with the bouncer looking right at them. They may even walk on the stage without being thrown out.\nInaccessible Clubs.\nThree other strip clubs (and general bars/nightclubs that apparently feature stripping entertainment) are present in Southern San Andreas but are not accessible to the player.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nIn \"GTA Online\", the &lt;a href=\"Vanilla%20Unicorn\"&gt;strip club&lt;/a&gt; is unlocked after reaching &lt;a href=\"Rank\"&gt;rank 6&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; will receive a text message, and the player can visit the club anytime they want. The player can get a private dance, and can raise the strippers' bar, by flirting with them, using a microphone if they have one. However, the strippers don't dance topless like in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" on PS3 &amp; &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; versions. The enhanced editions were patched to add topless dancers in the 1.27 update. After the \"like\" bar is increased enough, their number will be added to the players' &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;phone&lt;/a&gt;. Then, they can call the stripper to come to their &lt;a href=\"Safehouses%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; to give a private dance for free."}

{"id": "184745", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=184745", "title": "Stromberg (car)", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Ocelot\"&gt;Ocelot&lt;/a&gt; Stromberg is a custom submersible sports car featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of update.\nInfluence.\nThe Stromberg seems to be an analogue to the , more specifically the from the 1977 movie \"\", as evident by the Stromberg's general appearance, weaponry, and most importantly, its submersible feature. The design itself, however, has little to no resemblance to the Esprit, borrowing the majority of its design elements from several different 1970s European sports cars. The two most prominent cars featured in the Stromberg's design are the , as seen in the side profile, wheel design, black trim going around the car, front intake, and possibly the rear louvres, and the , especially the , evident in the louvres behind the side windows, greenhouse area, and whole rear fascia. The front fascia, as well as the rear vents of the Stromberg, feature some similarities to the , with the vents on the bonnet of the Stromberg, where the guns are located, being shaped and placed similarly to the ones found on the . The headlights are potentially inspired by the , however, with the layout closer to the , while the tail lights, albeit shaped like the Countach, may have been based on the , although with only a two-light layout. The tail lights may have also been influenced by the ; the louvres may have also been inspired by the , while the front may have been influenced by the .\nDesign.\nThe Stromberg is distinguished by its wedge-shaped profile, where the front end features a small central intake that spans about half the car's width and a flat bumper that is finished in black/plastic, while the bonnet area features a set of black headlamp housings with dual square-shaped units and a sectioned panel with ridged details between the lamps. The same bonnet area has smooth lines starting from the inner edges of each headlamp housing and running towards the windscreen, as well as small vents.\nOn the sides, black/plastic detail can be seen running along the body of the car and is aligned with the upper edges of the front bumper, while the doors have small rear-view mirrors near the A-pillars and black/plastic handles. The greenhouse area features black trim around the windows, a set of rear-quarter vents on the B pillars, and a vented rear engine compartment, with a separation in the centre.\nThe rear of the car features a black vented panel in the centre and two black tail lamp housings on the edges with dual circular units each, with the inner ones being the main/brake lamps and the outer ones being turn indicators. The area below is slanted and features a wide exhaust muffler with twin exit twin exhausts. The interior of the car is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Ardent\"&gt;Ardent&lt;/a&gt;, although the centre of the steering wheel is permanently white.\nThe vehicle is distinguished by its ability to switch between car mode and submarine mode, which, just like the &lt;a href=\"Deluxo\"&gt;Deluxo&lt;/a&gt;, can be transitioned between at any time. It features various functional components that do not seem to have fully-rendered storage spaces inside the vehicle; they merely disappear into the car's bodywork when stowed:\nThe primary colour of the car is applied to the upper side of the bodywork and the interior stitching, while the secondary colour is applied to the lower side of the bodywork, the middle panel and the rear fins. Although not accessible, a trim colour is also available for the dashboard, doors and seats. The wheels are a derivative of the \"Revolver\" muscle rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs/Wheels\"&gt;Los Santos Customs/Wheels&lt;/a&gt;, albeit having black tint/shade and medium-profile tyres with a detailed tread pattern.\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;armed&lt;/a&gt; with two machine guns protruding from the vents near the windscreen, and the panel between the headlamps pops up to reveal a set of missile/torpedo launchers.\nCurrent Design Gallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nCar Mode=\nSubmarine Mode=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nPerformance.\nCar Mode.\nOn car mode, the Stromberg seems to have fair handling and speed, but has average acceleration, the latter of which can be improved by upgrading it at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; or at a &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;vehicle workshop&lt;/a&gt;. Being an amphibious vehicle, it will not fail like other land vehicles if left in car-mode when entering water, but will be difficult to control, therefore making it essential to change into the submarine mode. Losing the driver door, however, renders it vulnerable to water, being destroyed in the process like any normal vehicle. The car's windows are shatterproof, although they are not bulletproof.\nBy holding right on the D-Pad, or holding H on PC, the vehicle transitions from car mode to submarine mode in approximately four seconds.\nSubmarine Mode.\nOn submarine mode, performance is average. Forward speed is quicker than a &lt;a href=\"Submersible\"&gt;Submersible&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Kraken\"&gt;Kraken&lt;/a&gt;, but is still slower than any surface speed boat.\nAscent and descent rate is faster than other submersibles but can only be achieved using forward momentum and pitching the nose. There is no raise and lower control functionality as in the other submersibles as these controls are assigned to the weapons in the Stromberg. Rudder response is quite sensitive. The car will momentum-drift noticeably when trying to turn sharply under water.\nCollision with the seabed or underwater flora will cause damage, and can eventually destroy the vehicle (and potentially kill the occupants depending on the depth this occurs). The vehicle shares the same depth range as other submersibles and will be crushed by water pressure at just past 500 ft (0.11 miles), &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; the occupants, even if they are equipped with &lt;a href=\"Scuba%20Suit\"&gt;Scuba Suit&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIt is (or was) possible to surpass the \"death barrier\" by diving deep &amp; fast in a high angle and switching into car mode just before passing the depth limit at 500ft under sea level which would otherwise crush the Stromberg. It seems like this depth barrier works (worked) only on vehicles that are \"classified as submarines\" and not on all vehicles in general which lets the Stromberg surpass it while in car mode and therefore \"classified as car\". If the submarine mode is enabled below the depth barrier the Stromberg will be crushed immediately, but even so the player is not trapped there because the Stromberg will rise above the depth barrier again over time.\nVisibility when breaching the surface is poor and there is a risk when driving out of the water of the vehicle getting stuck on terrain whereby neither land nor submarine mode will be usable to get the vehicle unstuck. Abandoning the vehicle on foot and getting it redelivered by the &lt;a href=\"Garage%20Mechanic\"&gt;Garage Mechanic&lt;/a&gt; or pushing it with other nearby vehicles/boats will be required.\nIt is possible to exit the Stromberg under water without destroying it. It is also possible to (re-)enter the Stromberg under water, too, though the Stromberg will slowly rise to the surface if empty.\nBy holding again right on the D-Pad, or holding H on PC, the vehicle transitions from submarine mode to car mode in approximately three seconds.\nWhen fighting against the &lt;a href=\"Toreador\"&gt;Toreador&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Kosatka\"&gt;Kosatka&lt;/a&gt;, the Stromberg is at a significant disadvantage, as it not only lacks the sonar equipment to detect hidden submarines, it also cannot dodge incoming torpedoes as easily when compared to a Toreador utilizing its boosting ability and the Stromberg has a limited supply of missiles/torpedoes.\nDefence.\nDefence-wise, it takes six homing rockets or two RPG rockets to explode the Stromberg, giving it a slight defensive edge over the &lt;a href=\"Deluxo\"&gt;Deluxo&lt;/a&gt;, another weaponized vehicle from the same update. However, it is very vulnerable to close, high-angle air attacks due to a limited lock-on angle of the homing missile, although it is devastating once locked on to an opponent.\nThe Stromberg, like most vehicles with similar design layout, provides slight protection against targets from the rear. Even though the windows cannot be shattered, they offer no protection to the occupants.\nWeaponry.\nThe driver has access to a set of weapons for both car and submarine modes:\nOnly the passenger can make use of &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by&lt;/a&gt; weapons when on land.\nPerformance Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMachine Gun=\nMissiles=\nTorpedoes=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

However, as of the &lt;a href=\"Stryder%20Week\"&gt;Stryder Week&lt;/a&gt; event, it is available for purchase.\nDesign.\nThe Stryder appears to resemble the , although the proportions are closer to the , evident by the smaller front end, stylized headlamps and higher ground clearance.\nThe vehicle is distinguished by its three-wheeled layout and small bodywork, where the frontal area is predominated by a black guard mounted in front of the chassis. The front wheels are supported by various silver control arms, with the corresponding steering arms and the single suspension spring on the center. The front fairing is relatively small and features two large headlights on the lower front area, while two long intakes can be seen beside the fairing and holding two extensions above the front wheels, housing narrow turn signals on the edges. The handlebars are connected by dual supports on the center and have long frames that hold the rear-view mirrors, as well as a single \"Race\" digital display on the center similar to the &lt;a href=\"Diabolus\"&gt;Diabolus&lt;/a&gt; (which is much smaller than any other motorcycle and is hard to get a better view of them when in first-person mode).\nThe main body of the vehicle is rather unique, featuring a fuel tank with the aforementioned long intakes on the upper area, carbon-fiber strips on the middle area and plastic sections with rear exit vents on the lower area. The engine bay is partially covered by the side body extensions, which also have plastic trim around the front and carbon-fiber strips on the outer sides and the rear portion. Both the engine bay and the body extensions have meshed intakes on the front, and the bottom area has a triangle-shaped vent with plastic surrounding and supports on the sides for the body extensions.\nThe rear section mainly consist of the black seat, the tail lights and the license plate on the end, along with dual exhaust pipes below. The lower area is predominated by the foot pegs and the black dual-sided swingarm, with the fully-animated chain drive and sprocket on the left and a carbon-fiber circular plate on the right. A small mudguard can be seen below the exhaust pipes.\nThe bodywork, body extensions and rear mudguard are painted with the primary colour, while the details of the front guard, part of the front fairing, the detail of the front suspension shock, the sides of the fuel tank and the rear end are painted with the secondary colour. The vehicle uses a unique set of six-spoke dual rims, which can also support a dedicated colour (although only examples from the &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; or appearing in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20Heist\"&gt;Casino Heist&lt;/a&gt; prep and finale may have a black colour).\nPerformance.\nThe Stryder is quick and agile in terms of both speed and maneuverability, being quite precise around corners at relatively high speeds. Unlike the Chimera, the Stryder's weight prevents it from ever pulling off wheelies and it does not fare very well on curbs, which can either throw the bike into a spin or cause the biker to fall off from the bike. In addition, it does not handle jumps very well and if airborne, it will pitch uncontrollably, often landing badly. It also struggles to reverse, even through small slopes.\nThe engine sound is high revving, being the same as sports bikes like the &lt;a href=\"Akuma\"&gt;Akuma&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Defiler\"&gt;Defiler&lt;/a&gt;."}

Likewise, it is able to quickly set vehicles in flames.\nIts strengths are countered by a very poor range, leaving it at a disadvantage in firefights at medium ranges. It also has a lengthy pump sequence in \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" and \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\" compared to other shotguns.

Franklin asks Lamar to stop pestering them while Imani announces to the group that she found the man behind the leaks: &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Henderson\"&gt;Jonathan Henderson&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a, Johnny Guns), a producer from &lt;a href=\"WesLos%20Records\"&gt;WesLos Records&lt;/a&gt; who holds a long-time grudge against Dr. Dre over a royalties conflict from the 1990s. Angered by this turn of events, Dr. Dre makes a threatening phone call to Johnny Guns while Lamar unsuccessfully attempts to butt in and resume his promotion \"deal\".\nLater outside the Agency, Franklin will call the player to ask them if they can return Dr. Dre's car to the &lt;a href=\"Record%20A%20Studios\"&gt;Record A Studios&lt;/a&gt;. The player must then return to a &lt;a href=\"corona\"&gt;corona&lt;/a&gt; outside Franklin's office in the Agency to start the mission.\nThe player is initially tasked to drive Dr. Dre's &lt;a href=\"Champion\"&gt;Champion&lt;/a&gt; to the studio, but as they approach the location, Franklin calls the player in panic informing them that Johnny Guns has sent his men to attack the studio and asks for the players' help to defend the studio.\nAs the player arrives, &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Guns%27%20Hired%20Gunmen\"&gt;Johnny's hired gunmen&lt;/a&gt; have already overrun the studio and are holding its occupants hostage.

After inviting several other artists and getting &lt;a href=\"DJ%20Pooh\"&gt;DJ Pooh&lt;/a&gt; to clear up the studio of dead bodies, Dr. Dre, along with &lt;a href=\"Anderson%20.Paak\"&gt;Anderson .Paak&lt;/a&gt;, conclude the mission with a live recording of an improvised song for the guests."}

In both \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\", it is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Coil\"&gt;Coil&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nThe weapon was originally &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;set to feature&lt;/a&gt; in \"\", but was removed. Its model can still be found in the original &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; release (v1.40) in game files under \"stungun.dff\" and \"stungun.txd\" names, assuming a generic bar-like item. The weapon's functionality was never implemented in the game.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn \"\", the Teaser assumes a design loosely based on an , with a pair of probes that attaches to the target when used.\nIt is classed as a &lt;a href=\"Melee%20Weapons\"&gt;melee weapon&lt;/a&gt;, but acts like a &lt;a href=\"Handguns\"&gt;handgun&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Stun Gun is based on a TASER 7, with elements from the M26 TASER.\nThe weapon features a distinctive black/yellow finish and two openings for the probes, as well as two sights in a similar manner to various weapons. In the , a &lt;a href=\"Coil\"&gt;Coil&lt;/a&gt; logo is seen on the handle/grip, and in &lt;a href=\"First-Person%20View\"&gt;first-person view&lt;/a&gt;, there is an electronic gauge below the sights that indicates if it has power or is recharging.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe Teaser launches a small wire which attaches to the target and sends a continuous electric charge into them. It has a power meter, which starts at 100, and is depleted with use; it recharges while idle. If a victim is shocked by it for long enough, they will catch on &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; and will eventually die, and the player will immediately gain a one-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Chinatown%20Wars\"&gt;Wanted Level&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Stun Gun can shock victims with thousands of volts of electricity and then leave them incapable of getting up, lying on the ground and eventually pulling out a &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt; if they have one. Usually, Stun Gun victims do not survive; however, in some cases such as street criminals and &lt;a href=\"animals\"&gt;animals&lt;/a&gt;, after being shocked they will get up as if nothing happened. The Stun Gun has a limited effective range, being slightly longer than most melee weapons.\nThe Stun Gun can also be used as a &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;Drive-By&lt;/a&gt; weapon (since it is classed as a handgun), though the low damage, low fire rate and short range limits its usage to just stunning NPCs on the streets with the car parked near them. Despite it being a Stun Gun, it is capable of being used to shoot out non-bulletproof vehicle tires and to kill people.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the weapon has a slower recharge speed, requiring 12 seconds before using it again, and the recharge time cannot be skipped by switching to another weapon. It will also do noticeable damage to targets, as its damage has been increased from 1 to 20. The Stun Gun cannot be used as a drive-by weapon unlike its story mode counterpart. However, during &lt;a href=\"The%20Gangbanger%20Robbery\"&gt;The Gangbanger Robbery&lt;/a&gt;, the taser used during said mission has the story mode rate of fire, while still dealing the same amount of damage as the \"GTA Online\" variant. Once the heist is completed, the fire rate is once again toned down.\nFiles list the weapon with an absurd ammo capacity, and even then, there is a flag that gives the weapon infinite ammo. This would theoretically prevent the character from even performing a reload animation. Even though the weapon has two openings for the probes, the weapon only fires a single electroshocking probe in the same way as a round of a conventional firearm, most likely due to limitations.\n\"GTA V\" and \"Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nGTA V=\nGTA Online=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The racers quickly come to an open left-hand hairpin turn, followed by a descending piece of track and some minor jumps. After these, there is another open left-hand hairpin turn and then another widened path with some minor jumps. After these, the players once again continue down a normal-width piece of track.\nSoon after, there is a left-hand kink and a slightly longer left corner, after which the racers continue on the inside part of a yellow pipe. There is a boost pad here, followed by a jump onto a lower yellow pipe. Again, there is another boost pad and a jump, which leads the racers down a short, descending piece of track, followed by a right-hand corner and then some small jumps onto a lower piece of track.

It is available for up to 16 players.\nDescription.\nThe race is a 42 checkpoint long Lap race, default to 2 laps.\nThe start is located above the sea, east of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSIA&lt;/a&gt;. Once the race begins, the racers soon come to a slanted piece of track; they have to traverse an incline, followed by a long, right-hand corner leading them back down to their starting altitude. After a slight bend, the racers make their way down a relatively straight piece of track; there is a considerable narrowing of the track towards the end of the straight.\nAfter this narrowing, there is a sweeping right-hand corner which leads the racers down another straight. This piece of track goes through one of the support pillars of the &lt;a href=\"Miriam%20Turner%20Overpass\"&gt;Miriam Turner Overpass&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 the player can either just avoid the steel pillars or use one of the two jumps to propel their way through two higher openings. Afterwards, there is a small descent, followed by a long sweeping left-hand corner and a high-speed chicane.\nImmediately after the chicane, the racers make their way up another slanted piece of track; there is a left-hand, open hairpin turn at the top, which leads the players onto a descent. They enter a green tube, in which they perform a loop; boost pads are placed throughout to ensure racers have enough momentum. The tube leads them onto a green piece of track, on which they have to perform another loop, which leads them into another green tube with boost pads. Once inside this tube, they make a right-hand turn, which leads them down a straight piece of tube, at the end of which is a jump onto a lower piece of track.\nBoost pads are placed on this piece of track, since the racers soon have to make another jump to a lower track. Two strips of boost pads are placed here as well, and what follows is a loop, after which there is a small jump into a green tube. Once inside, the racers take two long, right-hand turns, followed by a downwards, 360-degree clockwise turn. Shortly after, there is another left-hand turn leading the players to an orange piece of track with an obstacle.\nAfter passing the obstacle, the tube soon ends, and the racers continue down normal track. There is a right-hand kink, followed by a left-hand corner; afterwards, there is a slight narrowing of the track due to an obstacle. After this, there is a long sweeping right-hander, which then tightens, followed by a considerable narrowing of the track. Right after this, there is a boost pad, which helps to propel the racers around a loop encircling the Miriam Turner Overpass.\nOnce the loop is completed, the racers jump into a green tube, which soon turns upwards and allows the racers to jump right onto the start/finish line track piece."}

It is available for up to 16 players.\nDescription.\nThe race is a 100 checkpoint long Point to Point race.\nThe start is located in &lt;a href=\"Raton%20Canyon\"&gt;Raton Canyon&lt;/a&gt;. Once the race begins, the racers make their way east alongside &lt;a href=\"Cassidy%20Creek\"&gt;Cassidy Creek&lt;/a&gt;. They soon have to perform a loop, and boost pads are placed to ensure they get enough momentum to propel them around, after which they continue east on a track piece. Soon, they come to a jump which leads them onto a slightly higher level track. What follows is a slight left-hand kink and a tighter left-hander, immediately followed by a significant narrowing of the track.\nAfter the track opens up again, they come to a long, right-hand corner, followed by a small descent and an acute, right-hand corner. They continue down a short straight, after which comes a relatively large descent and a jump onto &lt;a href=\"North%20Calafia%20Way\"&gt;North Calafia Way&lt;/a&gt;. They continue southbound, crossing the &lt;a href=\"Calafia%20Bridge\"&gt;Calafia Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and continuing on &lt;a href=\"Calafia%20Road\"&gt;Calafia Road&lt;/a&gt;. Soon, they perform a hard right and continue on &lt;a href=\"Raton%20Pass\"&gt;Raton Pass&lt;/a&gt;. The racers make their way uphill on this winding road. As the road levels off and starts descending, they use a natural stone ramp to jump into a yellow tube.\nThe tube starts descending to a much lower level, where the racers exit the tube and continue on standard track. There is a slight right-hand turn, followed by a short straight with an obstacle, which slightly narrows the track. What follows is a windy piece of track, which can still be taken at full speed. The racers soon come to a loop, which takes place above the &lt;a href=\"Cassidy%20Creek%20Bridge\"&gt;Cassidy Creek Bridge&lt;/a&gt;; numerous boost pads are placed here to propel the racers around. After the loop, there are two square, right-hand turns, after which there is a long straight.\nThe straight ends with a square left-hand corner, followed by a descending piece of track that leads the racers onto the &lt;a href=\"Route%201\"&gt;Great Ocean Highway&lt;/a&gt;. This is soon followed by an acute turn onto a dirt road in the &lt;a href=\"Chiliad%20Mountain%20State%20Wilderness\"&gt;Chiliad Mountain State Wilderness&lt;/a&gt;. The route continue on this descending road all the way to Cassidy Creek, where the racers perform a jump into a yellow tube. Boost pads are placed inside to ensure the vehicles get enough momentum, as the tube soon starts ascending and winding, eventually ending up facing west, towards the ocean.\nAt the end of the tube, the racers do a small jump and continue on standard track. They soon come to a right-hand corner, followed by a small decline, a right-hand kink, and a tighter right-hander. This is followed by a left-right chicane, where the first corner is considerably tighter than the second. They continue down a short descending piece of track leading onto a long straight; there are two obstacles placed here \u2013 one in the middle of the track and the second narrowing the track on both sides. There is a long sweeping, right-hand corner at the end of this straight, leading onto another, shorter straight.\nA jump is placed at the end of this track, which leads the racers onto another straight; the same two obstacles as before are placed here, except in the reverse order. This is followed by two left-hand corners, after which there is a straight piece of track, which soon starts descending, leading the racers into the &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt; road tunnel. After coming out of the tunnel, they continue on the dirt paths all the way up to the &lt;a href=\"Altruist%20Camp\"&gt;Altruist Camp&lt;/a&gt;. They then proceed through the camp and take a jump into the finish checkpoint in the air."}

Once the race begins, the racers soon come to three boost pad strips placed along an ascending piece of track, which serves as a jump onto a descending track piece further north. There is another boost pad placed here, and the track eventually levels off, followed by two left-hand corners. This is soon followed by a track piece that bends to the left, leading onto an ascending piece of track with two boost pad strips. This serves as a jump onto a higher track.\nOnce the racers land the jump, they soon come to a very long sweeping, left-hand turn, which tightens towards the end. This is followed by a right-hand corner, which leads them onto a short, descending track piece with a boost pad, which serves as a jump onto a much lower piece of track. Here, a short straight is followed by a very long, right-hand corner, leading onto another ascending track piece with three boost pad strips. \nThe racers use this as yet another jump, which takes them onto a descending piece of track, followed by a left-hand kink and a small jump. Immediately after the jump, the racers come to two left-hand corners, the latter leading them towards the start/finish line."}

It is available for up to 16 players.\nDescription.\nThe race is a 36 checkpoint long Lap race, default to 2 laps. It is a fairly technical track with few straights and many tight corners.\nThe start is located above &lt;a href=\"Alta%20Street\"&gt;Alta Street&lt;/a&gt;. Once the race starts, the players continue down a short straight, followed by a long left-hand corner and a tighter right-hand corner. What follows is a right-hand kink and a jump onto another track piece; the racers also jump across another part of the track. Once they land the jump, they soon come to a left hairpin turn, after which there is a boost pad to make sure the racers have enough momentum to correctly take the upcoming jump.\nAfter this jump, the racers come to a right hairpin turn and another right-hand corner, which leads them down a short straight. Here, they cross a perpendicular track piece and then jump over another, followed by three square right-handers. Following this, the racers jump over the track they were racing down before the three successive corners. Afterwards, they continue through a right-hand corner, followed by a boost pad strip and a jump. The same section repeats once again: three square right-hand corners and a jump over the track piece.\nOnce on the next track piece, there is soon a right-hand kink which turns into a slight right bend, followed by a straight which crosses two track junctions. The straight ends with a left-hand corner, followed by a left hairpin turn, which leads the racers to a jump; another boost pad is placed here to propel the vehicles across a perpendicular track piece. This jump is followed by a right-hand hairpin turn and another jump with a boost pad. After this, there is another left-hand hairpin turn, which leads the racers onto a short straight; they also cross a track junction.\nHaving crossed this junction, the racers come to a right-hand kink and a much tighter right-hander, which leads them to a boost pad and yet another jump. After this, there is a left-right chicane, followed by a straight, where the racers cross another track junction. This straight ends with two right-hand corners and a slight left bend, after which the racers cross another junction. Soon after, there are three square left-handers and another junction, followed by a slight right bend and a jump; there is a short but significant narrowing of the track following this jump. Afterwards, there is a left-hand corner, leading the racers to the start/finish line."}

Once the race begins, the players continue down the remainder of this straight and through an archway underneath another piece of track. The straight ends with a right-hand corner, followed by a short straight and then another right-hand corner. The racers come to another straight, which narrows as they pass the power station. The track then widens again and leads onto an elevated track piece with a jump prop at the top; three strips of boost pads are also placed here.\nThe jump leads onto a track positioned below, with a wide red platform piece around it to ensure players don't fall off. The racers continue through a left-hand corner, followed by a jump that leads them onto another, lower track; another red platform is positioned around the main track. After a left-hand turn and a short straight, the track begins leading upwards, with two strips of boost pads placed on this elevated track. They jump from the top onto a lower piece of track, after which they soon have to make their way around a 180-degree left-hander.\nThis leads the racers onto a short straight, followed by a 180-degree right-hand corner, after which the track immediately narrows significantly while the racers pass through the power station. When they make it to the other side, a single boost pad helps to propel them off a jump prop onto a slightly higher red platform, after which they continue on standard track. The racers soon make their way around a banked right-hander, followed by an elevated track leading them onto an enclosed piece of track. After a left-hand corner, they make their way out of the enclosure and come to another banked, right-hand corner.\nAfter the banked corner, they continue down a long straight, which ends with a jump prop and two strips of boost pads. The racers jump through the smoke coming out of the smokestacks and onto a red platform. Following this, they continue on standard track, soon coming to a double apex, right-hand corner, before continuing down a short straight and through a left-hand corner. This leads them down another straight, part of it much narrower than the rest. After a right-hander, they come to another track piece enclosed by large barriers.\nFollowing a right-hand turn, the racers make their way out of the enclosure and immediately take a jump onto a lower track; a strip of boost pads is placed right before the jump. They continue down a straight which leads them through the power station for the last time; the track also narrows twice along this straight. This is followed by a left-hand corner and a 180-degree left-hander, after which they drive over a strip of boost pads and jump onto a slightly higher red platform. They continue through an archway underneath another track piece, followed by a right-hand corner leading them towards the start/finish line."}

They jump from the elevated track onto a descending track piece. What follows is a relatively long straight and a long, 180-degree left-hand corner, after which the racers continue down a short straight and past two kinks.\nFollowing the kinks, the racers continue down another straight, ending with a jump onto another track piece; a strip of boost pads is also placed before the jump. This is followed by a left-hand kink and a tight hairpin left-hander, after which the racers make their way past a slight right-hand corner. Following a short straight, they race through a square left-hander, leading them onto a straight piece of track, ending with a jump onto another track piece. The route then bends to the left, which is followed by a right kink and a tight, left-hand corner.\nAfter the tight corner, the racers continue down the track, soon coming to a right-hand corner and a left-hander soon after.

Shortly after the start line, a large 180 degree raised bend turns the track right, with track pieces laid above the water in the Canals. It passes under the several walkway bridges, and players must avoid several blockades before it passes under &lt;a href=\"Palomino%20Avenue\"&gt;Palomino Avenue&lt;/a&gt;. After passing under, a large incline leads to a jump, before players land in front of a cross-roads loop. Once completed the 270 degree corner loop, the track heads south towards the &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Beach\"&gt;Vespucci Beach&lt;/a&gt;. Several bends lead the track towards the sea where the raised track corners multiple times, before two pieces of track run side-by-side along the beach. The track then lifts and corners 180 degrees to lead the players onto the other side of the track, now heading up the beach west. The track has a long straight before making a sudden left corner near the pier, and another left corner leading to a large 4-way jump. At this jump, players have the risk of crashing into each other if one is so dawdle behind. After making the first jump, the track circuits round to the other side of the jump, shortly before entering yellowing tubing. After exiting the tubing, a fast-pace ramp leads to ground level, reaching back to the start line.\nThe race is a 41 checkpoint long Lap race, default to 2 laps. It is set to Super cars only and is mid-day by default. The color scheme of the race is yellow and green throughout the course.\nPremium.\nThe premium edition of the race is/was specifically for the &lt;a href=\"Tyrus\"&gt;Tyrus&lt;/a&gt; only, and was 3 laps. The entry fee was $20,000 and 8 players are required. 1st place is awarded $100,000, 2nd place $30,000, and 3rd place $20,000."}

Once the race begins, the players make their way north, soon coming to an ascending piece of track, where four strips of boost pads are also placed. These help the racers gain momentum so they can jump through a number of hexagonal-shaped loops. Jumping through these leads them onto a green, concave platform, after which they enter a grey tube which quickly starts bending leftwards and upwards; the bend continues for 180-degrees, and the racers continue south.\nAlmost immediately after the tube stops bending, the tube ends and the racers continue on standard track. They quickly come to a long, ascending track piece, on which five strips of boost pads are placed. They jump onto a long, slightly higher positioned platform. After making their way to the end of this platform, they race down a short, relatively straight piece of track, followed by a left hairpin turn. Afterwards, the racers continue down a track piece which eventually bends slightly to the right and then to the left. What follows is a giant loop, with seven strips of boost pads placed around the loop; the latter part of the track is enclosed by barriers.\nThe loop ends and sends the racers flying downwards through a large number of hexagonal-shaped obstacles, with them eventually landing on a downwards-sloped blue platform with a large, circular boost pad. The racers jump onto a green, concave platform, after which they continue onto an ascending track with four strips of boost pads. This track piece leads them into another grey loop, which almost constantly bends leftwards. Once the racers come out of the tube, they continue on standard track, which bends to the left. At the end of this track are three strips of boost pads, and the racers jump onto a slightly lower platform.\nThe track then quickly sloped upwards, and the racers have to jump across the &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank%20Tower\"&gt;Maze Bank Tower&lt;/a&gt;; a strip of boost pads is placed here to ensure they have enough momentum. They continue on a platform and then on standard track, which quickly starts ascending, with three strips of boost pads placed on this track piece. The racers continue through a banked left-hander, which leads them onto a levelled track. They soon come to a right-hand bend, followed by three strips of boost pads and a jump which leads them into the enclosed platform area, where the start/finish line is located."}

Stunt races can be found above \"Races\" in the jobs menu, and on the map as pink stunt-wheel symbols.\nThe races play like any normal race, with a maximum of 16 players in the lobby. The player can play on their own if they prefer to. The lobby interface features a checkered flag border/background, unique to these types of races. Unlike other races, Stunt Races can only be played in \"standard\" mode. The races are filled with checkpoints placed around a stunt-based circuit, with extreme usage and combination of the game world's props, buildings and infrastructure, as well as the new props. Around the circuit, numerous alarm sounds can be heard playing. The beginning of a race starts with a rocket-like sound, while the end of the race always finishes with a klaxon horn.\nThere a several new props included:\nPremium Stunt Races.\nEvery week, when the tunables update, one or more races become the premium race - stunt races can also become premium races. This makes the race a betting stage where the player must pay $20,000 to enter, and compete with strictly 7 more players to win the race and earn $100,000. Premium races require 8 players to begin, with no host, and appear as the golden stunt wheel on the map. Premium races are also non-contact with slipstream turned on, and use cars strictly bought by the player in Free Roam as opposed to supplying all the cars in a vehicular class like normal races.\nAs of August 9, 2016, the rewards for premium races have changed slightly.

These races are strictly locked to the specific vehicle and are required to perform the race. There are currently 30 Special Vehicle Stunt Races.\nTransform Races.\nTransform Races are another type of Stunt Races added in continuation of the &lt;a href=\"Smuggler%27s%20Run\"&gt;Smuggler's Run&lt;/a&gt; update for \"GTA Online\", released on October 17, 2017, during the &lt;a href=\"Transform%20Race%20Week\"&gt;Transform Race Week&lt;/a&gt; event. They are treated as separate content. These completely reform the way Stunt Races function, in that the certain checkpoints transform the player's vehicle into another type of vehicle during the race - for example, helicopters, planes, boats, bicycles, motorcycles, parachutes and other land vehicles, to match the flow of the race. These are significantly longer races and tend to feature a theme, often consisting of one large prop which acts as the play area.

Lastly, any decimal on the cash reward gets removed and the driver is rewarded the cash bonus for the Insane Stunt.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn \"\", triggering an Insane Stunt reward requires the driver to either jump a distance of 136ft or greater, reach a height of at least 16ft, perform at least two flips, or a rotation of 360\u00b0 or greater. Achieving two of these thresholds rewards the driver with a Double Insane Stunt which doubles the cash reward for the jump. Surpassing all three Insane Stunt goals rewards the driver with a Triple Insane Stunt earning the driver three times that of a standard Insane Stunt.\nWhen calculating the reward for a jump, four factors determine the money payout for an Insane Stunt; Distance, Height, Flips, Rotation. Distance and Height are measured in feet that increment by 3.333 feet, where the invisible decimal becomes important when calculating the reward for the jump. The distance traveled in the jump gets multiplied by 0.12, the height obtained gets multiplied by 0.9, each flip gives $12, and each degree spun is multiplied by 0.0667. Next, if the Insane Stunt performed is a Double or Triple the formula multiplies by 2 or 3 respectively.

An additional stripe surrounds the middle of the plane's fuselage, that starts on the front and ends in the back rudders.\nPressing the action/sub-missions button will activate a trail of red smoke (regardless of the plane's actual color) coming out the back of the plane. The smoke is used merely for aesthetic purposes, similar to the Cropduster's \"pesticide\".\nPerformance.\nThe Stuntplane is easily one of the best and most agile planes in the whole game, even better than the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rustler\"&gt;Rustler&lt;/a&gt;. It has a remarkably fast take-off time, likely thanks to its light weight, and has a moderate amount of speed while in the air. The plane's most notable feature is its incredible maneuvering capabilities which allow players to easily execute and (both of which are featured in the &lt;a href=\"Pilot%20School\"&gt;Pilot School&lt;/a&gt; trials).\nHowever, the very sensitive controls make the Stuntplane's handling tricky and easy to over correct, especially if damaged or while flying in high winds, combined with the fact that the Stuntplane has a very tight turning radius, but suffers from extreme over-turn. The Stuntplane also has the 2nd shortest takeoff/landing distance, next to the Hydra (in hover mode). Due to it being a biplane, it is very slow, which helps at landing, though still being faster than the &lt;a href=\"Dodo\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt;.\nSee Also.\nOther biplanes in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt; series:"}

Presumably marketed towards those interested in modern urbanwear, the store's interior is decorated in a gritty urban theme, and even features a stage. &lt;a href=\"Radio%20X\"&gt;Radio X&lt;/a&gt; can be heard playing inside Sub Urban stores. There are three Sub Urban outlets in the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe brand is mentioned in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", where it is advertised on the &lt;a href=\"Designerslave.com\"&gt;Designerslave.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Websites%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; and owns the &lt;a href=\"White%20Widow\"&gt;White Widow&lt;/a&gt; brand. It is sold in the Go Out store on &lt;a href=\"East%20Island%20City\"&gt;East Island City&lt;/a&gt;, with the logo from \"GTA San Andreas\" on it. An alternate logo also exists in \"GTA IV\", which features the name in block letters, although \"Sub\" and \"Urban\" remained separate. This logo would serve as a prototype for the logo that would debut in \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", the stores reappear as accessible clothing stores. The stores replace the grungy urban theme seen in \"San Andreas\" in favor for a cleaner and more modern look in its stores, featuring brick or plaster walls, wood or concrete flooring, and neon colors and lights, a style reflecting contemporary hipster aesthetics of the early 2010s. Its logo has been updated to feature block lettering that was prototyped in \"GTA IV\" and the store has been re-named as one word. It serves as a replacement for the &lt;a href=\"Modo\"&gt;Modo&lt;/a&gt; stores of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, selling mid-range clothing.

One such gang is located in &lt;a href=\"Trenton\"&gt;Trenton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;. In the early missions, &lt;a href=\"Mike\"&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; is sent by the &lt;a href=\"Mafia\"&gt;Mafia&lt;/a&gt; to collect money from the Hoods who don't want to pay them. At first reluctant, Mike does so and becomes an enemy of the Hoods.\nLater, &lt;a href=\"Mike\"&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Scorelli%20%28mission%29\"&gt;sent&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"8-Ball\"&gt;8-Ball&lt;/a&gt; to steal the car of a gangster going by the name of &lt;a href=\"Scorelli\"&gt;Scorelli&lt;/a&gt;. He appears to be involved with the Hoods, as some Hoods members are sent by him after Mike after he steals his &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Stallion\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt;.

Due to the fact that Scorelli drives a Diablo and appears to live in &lt;a href=\"Hepburn%20Heights\"&gt;Hepburn Heights&lt;/a&gt;, might mean that these Hoods are working together with the &lt;a href=\"Diablos\"&gt;Diablos&lt;/a&gt;.\nHoods members also appear to be on bad terms with &lt;a href=\"Jonnie\"&gt;Jonnie&lt;/a&gt;, a bartender, as they try to kill him during the mission &lt;a href=\"Love%20Boat\"&gt;Love Boat&lt;/a&gt; but are defeated by Mike. In the &lt;a href=\"Time%27s%20Up\"&gt;next mission&lt;/a&gt;, it becomes apparent that they owe money to Jonnie, who sends Mike to kill four Hoods in Portland. A street criminal, &lt;a href=\"Freddy%20%28GTA%20Advance%29\"&gt;Freddy&lt;/a&gt;, is also defended by Hoods and shares his in-game appearance with generic Hoods.\nThey don't appear much during the &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt; portion of the game, though nevertheless, they spawn in &lt;a href=\"Belleville%20Park\"&gt;Belleville Park&lt;/a&gt; and attack Mike on sight. Their only appearance is during the mission &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Pimpin%27\"&gt;Bad Pimpin'&lt;/a&gt; where they are seen defending the &lt;a href=\"Pimp\"&gt;Pimp&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Asuka%20Kasen\"&gt;Asuka Kasen&lt;/a&gt; sent Mike to kill.\nBy the end of the game, &lt;a href=\"Xox\"&gt;Xox&lt;/a&gt; targets Mike and tells him to come over to &lt;a href=\"Wichita%20Gardens\"&gt;Wichita Gardens&lt;/a&gt;. The player has a choice between going there and meeting with &lt;a href=\"Cisco\"&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt;. As it turns out, the meeting is an ambush, forcing Mike to kill Xox and his Hoods entourage. In the &lt;a href=\"Decoy%20Disaster\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt;, they make an appearance, trying to kill Mike who is posing as Cisco in his &lt;a href=\"Stretch\"&gt;Stretch&lt;/a&gt; limousine, together with the &lt;a href=\"Mafia\"&gt;Mafia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Yardies\"&gt;Yardies&lt;/a&gt;. Later, he is contacted by another member of the Hoods, who ambushes him with another group and tells him that Cisco is dead. After dealing with them, Mike rushes to Cisco's jet, and learns that the man said the truth.\nIt becomes apparent that the killer of Cisco is no one else than &lt;a href=\"Vinnie\"&gt;Vinnie&lt;/a&gt; himself, who faked his death. The Hoods appear as his bodyguards and allies, so Mike has to kill them before dealing with Vinnie himself. This is their last appearance in the storyline.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nBy the time takes place in &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;, the Nines begin selling &lt;a href=\"SPANK\"&gt;SPANK&lt;/a&gt; on local streets. The Red Jacks, particularly their leader &lt;a href=\"D-Ice\"&gt;D-Ice&lt;/a&gt;, are against the drug and narcotic business and &lt;a href=\"Southside%20Hoods%20War\"&gt;start a war&lt;/a&gt; with the Nines.

The participants of the war were D-Ice, &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"D-Ice%27s%20Brother\"&gt;D-Ice's Brother&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe War.\nThe war started in 2001, three years after the belligerent gangs worked together as the &lt;a href=\"Southside%20Hoods\"&gt;Southside Hoods&lt;/a&gt;, to assist the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; in driving the rival &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forellis&lt;/a&gt; out of their turf. In 2001, the Purple Nines got their hands of supplies of the &lt;a href=\"SPANK\"&gt;SPANK&lt;/a&gt; drug, and started selling it on the streets. The Jacks, however, did not share their view of the drug, opposing it for unknown reasons. This difference slowly damaged the relationship between both gangs, until a full-blown gang war between both factions broke out.\nBy the time Claude had arrived to Shoreside Vale, the war was already in full swing. At this point, the status of the war cannot be determined clearly. D-Ice, the leader of the Red Jacks, contacted Claude through a payphone at &lt;a href=\"Wichita%20Gardens\"&gt;Wichita Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, giving him the task of &lt;a href=\"Uzi%20Money\"&gt;killing as many Nines as possible in a drive-by spree&lt;/a&gt; to weaken the gang. Later on, under Ice's orders, Claude &lt;a href=\"Toyminator\"&gt;intercepted and destroyed&lt;/a&gt; a number of SPANK-laden armored vans with an RC car truck. In retaliation for Claude's attacks, the Purple Nines rigged D-Ice's &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt; with a sensitive time bomb, forcing Claude to &lt;a href=\"Rigged%20to%20Blow%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;drive the car&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; into a garage in &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Mark%27s\"&gt;Saint Mark's&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing Claude's intervention in the war, the Nines sustained severe losses, and the Jacks gained the upper hand. The few remaining survivors, refusing to go down easily, &lt;a href=\"Rumble\"&gt;challenged&lt;/a&gt; the Jacks to one final, old fashioned &lt;a href=\"baseball%20bat\"&gt;baseball bat&lt;/a&gt; gang war. After being given the details of the situation, Claude picked up D-Ice's younger brother at &lt;a href=\"Wichita%20Gardens\"&gt;Wichita Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, and the two headed to the designated spot at the &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20View%20Picnic%20Area\"&gt;Staunton View Picnic Area&lt;/a&gt;, meeting the last Nines gangsters there. A short confrontation between the two groups ensued, but Claude and D-Ice's brother managed to hold their ground and defeat the Purple Nines troop. This fight marked the presumed end of the Purple Nines, and the closing of the war with the Red Jacks' victory. After this, the Purple Nines are wiped out from the city."}

The bike gets most benefit from the performance upgrades available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, since these are mostly focused on acceleration. The motorcycle is quite heavy, and as a result, it is not as nimble and maneuverable as other lighter bikes in the game. It has a large turning radius.\nLike the police variant, the bike is powered by a V-Twin engine and coupled to a 4-speed gearbox.

On the sides, various wooden planks can be seen strapped to the body, while two small wings can be seen behind the front wheels, each one supported by a cable and three hooks. The cabin area also features wooden pieces around the pillars and the roof. The rear area is covered by more wooden planks and a roof sheet over the engine bay, where it contains several electrical devices. The most outstanding feature of the vehicle are the two trashcans positioned on either side and supported by wooden planks, intended to emulate jet engines, as well as upper wooden pieces with rods mounted on them, appearing to be upper fins with large antenna. The underside area is identical to the Dune Buggy, with the exception of a trashcan lid mounted on the rear.\nThe cabin compartment features the same components as the Dune Buggy, being the corresponding set of pedals, a steering wheel with a visible steering column reaching the steering arms, the gear stick connected to the engine and the main seats. Similar to the Dune Buggy, the Space Docker is also fitted with a CB radio, and occasional trucker chatter can be heard regardless of whether the main radio is turned on or off (it only plays if playing as &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe Space Docker is only seen with a light grey/red scheme with several red markings on it (possibly in accordance to the alien/space theme), as well as long coils of glowing blue EL wire wrapped around the vehicle's body, which light up at night. The vehicle uses unique wheel caps with red markings on them, together with standard-treaded tyres.\nPerformance.\nBeing similar in construction and design to the Dune Buggy, the Space Docker performs well off-road, but it has slightly lower acceleration than the Dune Buggy. Its back end is prone to fishtailing, especially at high speeds, possibly due to its low performance tyres and large weight (2,000 kilograms, 200 kg more than the base model).\nThe Space Docker is not indestructible, as the front end of the vehicle deforms just as badly, if not worse, than the original Dune Buggy. The vehicle, like the Dune Buggy and the &lt;a href=\"BF%20Injection\"&gt;Injection&lt;/a&gt;, is powered by a single-cam Flat-4 engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a rear engine, rear wheel drive layout. The Space Docker actually sounds like a\u00a0Dune Buggy\u00a0when heard carefully, and the \"spaceship\" engine sound is actually made by a sound device inside the vehicle."}

They serve as the &lt;a href=\"Antagonist\"&gt;antagonist&lt;/a&gt; gang during the beginning of the game.\nThey seem to have lost the Cerveza Heights territory to the Triads, which results in them trying a few times to recover their territory, during the missions &lt;a href=\"Under%20the%20Gun\"&gt;Under the Gun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Payback%20%28GTA%20Chinatown%20Wars%29\"&gt;Payback&lt;/a&gt;. They still seem to claim some businesses in Dukes, and remain in conflict with Wu Lee for a while, trying to torch some of his businesses in revenge for Huang doing the same to them and attempting to kill Kenny and Huang at &lt;a href=\"Kenny%27s%20Warehouse\"&gt;Kenny's Warehouse&lt;/a&gt;. The last time they appear is during the mission &lt;a href=\"Sa-Boat-Age\"&gt;Sa-Boat-Age&lt;/a&gt;, attempting to kill &lt;a href=\"Chan%20Jaoming\"&gt;Chan Jaoming&lt;/a&gt;, leaving Huang to defend him from the onslaught.\nDescription.\nThe gang takes influence from eastcoast hispanic gangs such as the . They are one of the largest street gangs operating in GTA IV, having influence across virtually all boroughs (including &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;) except &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;; having turf in &lt;a href=\"South%20Bohan\"&gt;South Bohan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fortside\"&gt;Fortside&lt;/a&gt; (night time only), &lt;a href=\"Cerveza%20Heights\"&gt;Cerveza Heights&lt;/a&gt; (which they lose to the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"2009\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"East%20Holland\"&gt;East Holland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20City\"&gt;Alderney City&lt;/a&gt;; they maintain a strong street presence within these territories. In the Alderney City turf, since they share their turf with the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20Mob\"&gt;Korean Mob&lt;/a&gt;, they don't attack each other and\u00a0may even drive around in cars with Koreans in the passenger seat and both will attack the player if the car is damaged. They will however attack each other if the player provokes a shoot out or when a member of one gang punches a member of the other. Spanish Lords wear black and gold, also red and blue, as in addition to their gang colors, they proudly wear clothes depicting the Puerto Rican flag. Some are seen wearing t-shirts with the word \"Boricua\" printed on them, a term that derives from the pre-columbian Taino Indian language of Puerto Rico, which means Puerto Rican. Fishnet shirts and leather jackets are popular as well. Most often, the Spanish Lords are seen driving in &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Primo\"&gt;Primo&lt;/a&gt;s painted metallic red with gold rims and trim. In Chinatown Wars, they drive beige &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt; muscle cars with better handling and a red underglow. They also use an orange/white &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt; to transport drugs. Members often sell Coke and rarely Ecstasy, which they also buy for huge prices.\nThere are four sets of Spanish Lords members:\nSome members of the Spanish Lords don't wear gold, but the Spanish Lords usually can be seen wearing it as their primary color. Sometimes, if you hit a car belonging to one while he's in it, the gang member will come out with a &lt;a href=\"Knife\"&gt;Knife.&lt;/a&gt; At night they usually walk around with &lt;a href=\"Micro-SMG\"&gt;Micro-SMG&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0in case of fights.\nTheir favorite radio stations are &lt;a href=\"San%20Juan%20Sounds\"&gt;San Juan Sounds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Beat%20102.7\"&gt;The Beat 102.7&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alchemist\"&gt;Alchemist&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\nTheir name - Spanish Lords - is a play on their real life counterpart - the Latin Kings. Both gangs flash black and yellow and both have Puerto Ricans as the majority of its members (Chicago Latin Kings are mostly Mexicans, New York Latin Kings are mostly Puerto Ricans). They may also be based off of Associacion \u00d1etas due to the fact that some members flash the said gangs colors such as those on the Puerto Rican flag and even the flag itself. This is not unusual as Rockstar mixed up several gangs' traits from their real life counterparts to avoid favoritism."}

{"id": "2040", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2040", "title": "Sparrow", "text": "The Sparrow is a &lt;a href=\"helicopter\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; featured in ', ', ', ' and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of update.\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nThe Sparrow is based on the (more specifically on the \"G-series\"), evidenced by the \"soap bubble\" canopy and the exposed welded-tube tail rotor.\nThe Sparrow generally assumes a lightweight appearance, feauring a glass cockpit and curved doors, as well as a small engine, long skids and an exposed tail boom with small fins and a tubular end for the tail rotor. The rendition in \"GTA San Andreas\" appears to have linear doors and square-shaped windows spanning the upper area of the cabin. The Sparrow is only available in a grey color in the \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\" renditions, and white in the \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition. Although not visible, a red secondary color is also listed in the files in \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA San Andreas\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe Sparrow appears slightly more compact than its original appearance, with the tail being reduced in size and no longer sporting the original exposed frame. Despite this, it still appears as a compact helicopter featuring machine guns. It only appears during certain missions, alongside the &lt;a href=\"Defender\"&gt;Defender&lt;/a&gt;, a similar attack helicopter.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Sparrow returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" with the same design as the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Sparrow\"&gt;Sea Sparrow&lt;/a&gt;, being based on a with the engine from the , while retaining the tail setup from the Bell 47.\nThe vehicle has the same design and features as the pre-existing Sea Sparrow, but the pontoons are replaced by regular skids. Some tweaks were also made to the model, such as the skid struts being slightly more vertical, the blades being fully black and the circular detail on the engine bay being fully finished in silver. Like the Sea Sparrow, it uses a small instrument panel with the \"Flyer\" dial set on it, with the same layout as the &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Attack variant&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle is set to spawn in a light grey primary color for the body and a black secondary color for the small fins of the horizontal stabilizers. However, the respray option from the Moon Pool workshop seems to apply to both primary and secondary colors at once.\nLike the Sea Sparrow, the vehicle does not have any &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;, but it can be equipped with one via customization, either a Minigun based on a gatling gun or a small missile launcher with four tubes inside.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe helicopter handles quite well in \"GTA Vice City\" compared to the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; due to its low weight, but has taken a slight downturn in \"GTA San Andreas\". It can fit two people inside and is great for transporting a body guard in \"GTA Vice City\" or a homie in \"GTA San Andreas\". While it is not as fast as the &lt;a href=\"VCN%20Maverick\"&gt;VCN Maverick&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"VCN%20Maverick\"&gt;News Chopper&lt;/a&gt;, the Sparrow is easier to use, being a perfect choice for practicing flying. The weak point of the helicopter is its uncovered engine, and a few shots are enough to bring it out of the air, proving that it has no armor. If the player hits any door on the helicopter, it will be removed like it is the case with cars, making it the first helicopter to have removable doors.\nThe aircraft is powered by a single piston engine, and shares its engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; and its variants.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe performance of the Sparrow is a bit different to that of the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Sparrow\"&gt;amphibious variant&lt;/a&gt;, as the reduced weight gives it similar traits to the &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;attack variant&lt;/a&gt;. The handling of the helicopter is very nimble, but remains relatively stable (albeit slightly inferior to the Buzzard in that aspect), allowing the player to perform quick maneuvers. In addition, when flying at full speed, the aircraft will slightly descend, similarly to the Buzzard.\nBeing a standard helicopter, however, the Sparrow is unable to land on water, although it can still hover above water like most helicopters. Due to the skids being part of the aircraft's body, the tail rotor can be kept away from the sea waves. Even in stock condition, the Sparrow performs identically to a fully-upgraded Sea Sparrow.\nLike its amphibious variant, the vehicle is powered by a single turboshaft engine, which produces the same rotor sound as the former, as well as most regular helicopters.\nDefense.\nIn terms of durability, the helicopter remains as vulnerable as the Sea Sparrow and other civilian helicopters in the game (including the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;Frogger&lt;/a&gt;), as it has no protection for the occupants against gunfire and cannot withstand a single explosion before being destroyed. The lack of armor upgrades makes it even more fragile to collisions and most form of attacks, and the rigidness of the skids means it can be easily damaged by hard landings, unlike most helicopters with similar setups. Just like other helicopters, after taking enough damage, the engine will begin to smoke, until it will shut down after smoking for two minutes and twenty seconds. The Sparrow will gradually take damage when it is landed on top of a vehicle.\nThe tail rotor cannot be destroyed by any means, as receiving gunfire will damage the helicopter instead.\nA unique feature of the helicopter is that it cannot be targeted by the air defenses of the &lt;a href=\"Galaxy%20Super%20Yacht\"&gt;Galaxy Super Yacht&lt;/a&gt;, allowing it to safely fly over or attack players on the yacht without getting blown up.\nCountermeasures.\nThe vehicle can be fitted with countermeasures to improve its defensive capabilities against homing missiles, each one with their own attributes:\nWeaponry.\nLike the Sea Sparrow, the Sparrow can equip a pilot-operated weapon mounted below the cabin, which only one can be installed at once:\nOccupants are unable to use drive-by weapons.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMinigun=\nMissiles=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Sparrow can only be modified inside the Moon Pool workshop of the &lt;a href=\"Kosatka\"&gt;Kosatka&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike most vehicles, the vehicle has limited access to 30 Classic colors with the same cost.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nThe Sparrow only spawns in these areas (except the one in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Downtown&lt;/a&gt;) after completing the &lt;a href=\"Missions\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rub%20Out\"&gt;Rub Out&lt;/a&gt; and entering them starts the &lt;a href=\"Chopper%20Checkpoints\"&gt;Chopper Checkpoints&lt;/a&gt; side mission."}

Each protagonist has a small yellow meter below the radar which indicates how much time the player has left before the special ability deactivates. While playing as any protagonist, the player can activate the special ability by pressing + on &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PS3&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PS4&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"PlayStation%205\"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt;, + on &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Xbox%20Series%20X%20and%20Series%20S\"&gt;Xbox Series X|S&lt;/a&gt;, or on &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;.

This allows him to easily take corners at full speed and make precise maneuvers quickly. By enhancing this skill, its maximum storage capacity is increased, which directly affects its duration. Franklin's special ability begins at one third of maximum capacity, which lasts for 30 seconds of duration. As soon as the ability gets activated, the screen darkens and takes on a slight hue of green, during which the game world becomes very slow, and all of the lights on the screen become blurry and leave trails. Controls of the vehicle become smoother and allow Franklin to pass through narrow gaps between other cars to do dangerous turns and slides without losing control or speed of the vehicle and overall improve performance. This is reminiscent of the Zone ability in ' and ', which are also made by &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt;, which allows the player to slow down time to weave through traffic. It is also reminiscent of the Speed Breaker ability in ', ' and \"\", albeit without the vehicle mass increase.\nThis ability only can be applied to ground motor vehicles like &lt;a href=\"cars\"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"motorcycles\"&gt;motorcycles&lt;/a&gt;, and even to the &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; tank. This is particularly useful if Franklin is attacking someone with the cannon. The special ability also applies to drive-by shootings.\nJust driving around with Franklin can increase his special skill although minutely. The more extreme the circumstance the better chance of increased skill. The following events give an increase to Franklin's special skill in varying amounts:\n&lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt; is the only in-game character who acknowledges the existence of Special Ability, asking him to \"use that special driving thing that he does\" during &lt;a href=\"Chop%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Chop&lt;/a&gt;. According to him, Franklin looks funny while using it, \"like watching Chop try to read while you do that shit,\" or \"when you go all cross-eyed like you constipated or some shit.\"\nMichael De Santa.\n&lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt;'s Special ability is Area Kill. While active, Michael enters a bullet-time-like effect, allowing him to slow time and gain the advantage in shootouts. By enhancing this skill, its maximum storage capacity is increased, which directly affects its duration. Michael's Special skill lasts for 30 seconds when the Stat Bar for Special skill has been maxed out. Similar to other Rockstar titles such as /'s Dead Eye (Rank One) ability in the ' series, the Bullet Time ability in the ' series and the &lt;a href=\"Adrenaline\"&gt;adrenaline pill&lt;/a&gt; power up from some &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; games, this allows Michael to focus and plan his movements and aim while shooting. As the ability is activated, the screen acquires a blue tint and the action is slowed down, including Michael's movements and the weapon used.\nThis ability can only be activated when Michael is on foot and cannot be activated when he's in a vehicle (unless when &lt;a href=\"Character%20Wheel\"&gt;switching&lt;/a&gt; to him and he's in his &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; giving money to &lt;a href=\"Tracey%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Tracey&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Jimmy&lt;/a&gt;; here, the ability can be activated, but once the ability is stopped or depleted, it can't be activated again).\nSpecial combat maneuvers increase Michael's Special. The following events increase Michael's special skill in varying amounts:\nTracey De Santa indirectly mentions his special ability in &lt;a href=\"Daddy%27s%20Little%20Girl\"&gt;Daddy's Little Girl&lt;/a&gt;, saying \"My daddy never misses!\", although this could simply be her overplaying Michael's aim.\nTrevor Philips.\n &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt;'s special skill is Red Mist, which allows him to take less damage and inflict more damage, making him nearly invincible. As the ability is activated, Trevor bursts into rage, damage taken is decreased and damage given is increased. Trevor will not &lt;a href=\"wasted\"&gt;die&lt;/a&gt; while the ability is activated, allowing him to survive lethal events such as explosions, heavy collisions, or being hit by trains or other locomotives. The screen turns orange and blood red, acquires both a ripple visual effect and a buzzing sound effect, time slows down slightly, but never as slow as Michael's or Franklin's ability. By enhancing this skill, its maximum storage capacity is increased, which directly affects its duration. Trevor's Special skill lasts for 30 seconds when the Stat Bar for Special skill has been maxed out. This special move is reminiscent of 's Blind Rage in the game ', where the camera shifts from a third-person view to a first-person view, Tony becomes invincible, is given unlimited ammo, the ability to recover +200 health points with every kill, deals increased damage and auto-targets multiple enemies at once in a berserk rage. The similar ability is also in another Rockstar Games movie-based game, '. This game also has a similar rage mode where the playable characters become invincible, and their attacks doubled. The screen also becomes orange-shaded when activated. Another rage mode reminiscent to this special move is in the game \"\" called Slaughter Mode, where becomes invincible, his melee attacks deal increased damage, is given unlimited throwing knives and his health bar slowly regenerates to full. This skill is also reminiscent of the Agro ability in \"Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition\" and \"Midnight Club: Los Angeles\", which are also made by Rockstar Games, which allows the player's car to become indestructible and inflict more damage towards traffic, racers, objects and even police vehicles.\nHe is able to resist serious to lethal damage like &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, explosions, &lt;a href=\"Cougars\"&gt;cougar&lt;/a&gt; attacks and Rhino cannons. He also performs a special melee attack with up close enemies. Unfortunately, while he doesn't take as much damage, he's still susceptible to the reactions of these attacks (body flying during an explosion, cars can run over him, cougars taking him down etc.), sometimes rendering him defenseless if attacked constantly by grenades, rockets, animals, or vehicles. A modified version of Trevor's ability is featured in &lt;a href=\"Rampage%20%28GTA%20V%20Missions%29\"&gt;Rampages&lt;/a&gt;, but his special ability can still be activated, allowing even more advantage against the targets.\nHe only can perform his special ability while on foot.\nWhen activated, Trevor will furiously shout random unique taunts and scream in a fit of rage when reactivated.\nThings that make Trevor angry increase his special capacity. The following events increase his capacity in varying amounts:"}

The handguard is a similar size and shape to that of the G36C, but the vent holes are lower down that of the H&amp;K, meaning space for six instead of two per side. The carry handle is more linear than those of the G36 family, but is derived from the G36C variant. The assault rifle features a pistol grip with three thumb grooves, unlike any German assault rifle in production in 2013. The magazine's shape is rectangular, inspired by 7.62 Galil variant's magazines, which is odd considering the use of 5.56mm ammunition. The front sight is very different than that of the actual G36C's, in that it lacks the circular, round front sights seen in other Heckler &amp; Koch weapons such as the and . Instead of the G36's ambidextrous charging handle that lies flush with the body, the Special Carbine has a charging handle that juts out on both sides of the weapon in the same location.\nAlthough the weapon can only fire in full-automatic, there is a double-sided fire selector with small icons on it, which \"X\" is the safe position, \"&gt;\" is semi-automatic and \"\u00bb\" is full-automatic.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nChambered in 5.56mm, the weapon has very high damage per second, equal to that of the &lt;a href=\"Gusenberg%20Sweeper\"&gt;Gusenberg Sweeper&lt;/a&gt;, meaning higher than the &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt; (higher damage per shot), but lower than the &lt;a href=\"Advanced%20Rifle\"&gt;Advanced Rifle&lt;/a&gt; (lower rate of fire) and both the &lt;a href=\"MG\"&gt;MG&lt;/a&gt; (lower damage per shot) and &lt;a href=\"Combat%20MG\"&gt;Combat MG&lt;/a&gt; (lower damage per shot and rate of fire in RPM). Accuracy is high, equal to that of the Carbine Rifle. While very powerful and accurate, the Special Carbine has slightly less effective range than other assault rifles, which can limit its effectiveness at longer ranges, though its accuracy somewhat makes up for this.\nThe weapon by default has a 30-round magazine, which can be replaced with a 60-round magazine. In \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", as of the update, it can be further upgraded with a 100-round box magazine, which offers as much suppression fire as an &lt;a href=\"MG\"&gt;MG&lt;/a&gt; with \"Extended Clip\" or a &lt;a href=\"Combat%20MG\"&gt;Combat MG&lt;/a&gt; with \"Default Clip\", at the cost of a slightly increased reload time.\nThe Special Carbine also has a unique knocking firing sound, which seems to have more impact force than other assault rifles, hence the fact that it deals more damage than most of them."}

Notable changes are a different handguard with a seemingly shorter barrel, a different top rail with smaller iron sights and an L-shaped lightweight stock. Most of the features and details from the standard version are also seen in this weapon.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Special Carbine Mk II slightly improves over the regular Special Carbine in damage (from 32 to 32.5), with the same rate of fire. Compared to other assault rifles, it has the second highest damage per second, only beaten out by the &lt;a href=\"Bullpup%20Rifle%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Bullpup Rifle Mk II&lt;/a&gt; but still outperforms the &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Carbine Rifle Mk II&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Rifle%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Assault Rifle Mk II&lt;/a&gt;.

This makes the weapon a better choice for long-range engagements.\nThe weapon has access to the following ammo types:\nNote that specialized ammo magazines have a reduced capacity of 20 rounds, with an overall capacity of 240 rounds (12 magazines)."}

When exporting them, the player can select the number of crates they wish to export (or all of them at once), which will bring a total amount of money that the buyer will give the player upon delivery.\nEvery so often, unique Special Cargo may be found - this cargo is worth a great deal more than regular cargo, with one crate often selling up to $150,000. Note that as this is even more special, it costs more to buy it.\nBuy Special Cargo.\nBuy missions are the missions the player completes to get special cargo crates in their &lt;a href=\"Warehouses\"&gt;Warehouse&lt;/a&gt;. These missions can be started from their &lt;a href=\"Offices\"&gt;office&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"SecuroServ\"&gt;SecuroServ&lt;/a&gt; terminal. The player can select the amount of crates they want to source and store:\nIt should be noted that players can only pick up one crate at a time, so they have to deliver it to their warehouse and pick the others. However, the player is usually tasked to pick a vehicle with 2 or 3 crates at once, being an ideal option to complete the mission quicker. However, regardless of the choice, the cargo's location will be notified to rival players in the session, which are given the option to destroy the cargo for a small amount of cash and &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;RP&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe missions have a cooldown which is the same regardless of what level (amount of crates) mission is launched, so it is generally recommended to attempt the highest level/amount missions. It should be noted that the cooldown timer is applied to the warehouse the player selects to store the cargo, so if they own more than one warehouse, they can launch another buy mission for that warehouse and repeat the process.\nAfter update, players can also send &lt;a href=\"Lupe\"&gt;Lupe&lt;/a&gt; or their &lt;a href=\"Warehouse%20Staff\"&gt;Warehouse Staff&lt;/a&gt; member to source random cargo for $7,500 each trip. &lt;a href=\"Warehouse%20Staff\"&gt;Warehouse Staff&lt;/a&gt; takes one game day (48 mins IRL time) to source the cargo, and sometimes, special items can also be sourced. They randomly accrue from one to four crates (three normal crates + one special item). The option of Special Cargo sourcing will be disabled if the warehouse is full, and if the warehouse has special cargo sourcing active and the warehouse becomes full during this time, the player will get a notification saying \"There was no space to store the special cargo your staff has sourced\".\nProducts.\nProducts which the player can buy include:\nSpecial Items.\nOccasionally, the Assistant will call the player to tell them about a Special Item on the SecuroServ Network. This Item is more expensive, but will also bring in more profit once sold. The special item sells 5x of its cost, and unlike the normal products, the special items will not increase the value as the item number increases. The following is a list for the special items:\nSell Special Cargo.\nExporting Special Cargo will require the player to access the &lt;a href=\"Ad-Hawk\"&gt;Ad-Hawk&lt;/a&gt; laptop computer inside the Warehouse and choose the amount of cargo to sell. The cargo can be exported via three different methods of transport; land, sea, or air. On land, &lt;a href=\"Brickade\"&gt;Brickade&lt;/a&gt; trucks may be used to contain large amounts of cargo, although more often than not, multiple Brickades may need to be delivered. There is usually enough time for a single player to deliver more than one truck, but having an associate is recommended. On water, the &lt;a href=\"Tug%20%28boat%29\"&gt;Tug&lt;/a&gt; boat may be used to export products out at sea, while in air, the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20800\"&gt;Cuban 800&lt;/a&gt; may be used to drop cargo to destination(s). All vehicles used for the sell missions can be previously upgraded at the work bench inside each warehouse to ensure better possibilities to complete a sale.\nAgain, like in source missions, the cargo will be marked to rival players in public sessions and they can opt to sabotage the vehicle. Vehicles generally have increased resistance against most forms of attacks, but players themselves may be still vulnerable to gunfire, thus leaving the vehicle vulnerable and risking to lose all products."}

In general, a time limit appears should the player(s) take too long to get all the cargo back to the warehouse.\nCargo Vehicles.\nThere are several possible vehicles that can contain the cargo, of which several are limited to specific outcomes. \nStandard Pickup.\nThe cargo is located in a van marked on the map. The player is free to retrieve it and deliver it at their &lt;a href=\"Warehouses\"&gt;Warehouse&lt;/a&gt; with no problems.\nWay Back Trouble.\nSimilar to the Standard Pickup mission, the player can take the van without trouble, yet they will encounter enemies on the way back (wave of enemies = crate number in regular, 3 waves for the special item, 4 enemies in 2 vehicles for each wave).\nSpooked.\nThe dealer was spooked, and so has moved the position of the cargo van. This is only discovered on arrival of the initial location and so the player is given an updated location to retrieve the van.\nMoving Pickup.\nThe player is tasked with retrieving the vehicle. Once they do so, they will encounter enemies on the way back (wave of enemies = crate number in regular, 3 waves for the special item, 4 enemies in 2 vehicles for each wave). The vehicle may also only start to escape once a player approaches it, with armed guards attempting to hamper the player's progress.\nHelicopter Packages.\nThe cargo may be transported by helicopter, but the vehicle is usually randomized. Sometimes it can be &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;Frogger&lt;/a&gt;s (Frogger number = crate number in regular, 3 Froggers for the special item) with side bay gunners. In order for the player to obtain the cargo, the helicopter must be destroyed with any means.\nDeal Gone Wrong.\nSimilar to a random event in story mode, the player arrives at the scene, not finding any cargo, but instead found several gangsters dead, with several gang cars (&lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt;s if the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos&lt;/a&gt; was involved, or &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Burrito\"&gt;Gang Burrito&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Daemon\"&gt;Lost MC Daemon&lt;/a&gt; if the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20MC\"&gt;Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; was involved) parked around, usually severely damaged and cannot be entered. The assistant then proceeds to tell the player to look for clues that may lead them to the cargo. A yellow area is then indicated on the map, always at the shootout scene. The cargo is always in this area. If after some time the player still fails to find the cargo, the assistant will locate the cargo and pinpoint them on the radar.\nOnce the player leaves the scene, and when they are carrying cargo, chasers from another gang (who have probably broken the deal) will arrive in vehicles and attempt to intercept them (wave of enemies = crate number, 4 enemies in 2 vehicles for each wave). All enemies (survived victims and chasers) in this mission are armed with &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThere are ? possible locations each consisting of the exact same set up:\nCrash Site.\nA &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;Shamal&lt;/a&gt; carrying cargo has crash-landed and police are on scene. The Cargo will be found in separate crates scattered around the jet. The crash site consists of the destroyed Shamal prop used in &lt;a href=\"Caida%20Libre\"&gt;Caida Libre&lt;/a&gt;, along with two &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20SUV\"&gt;Sheriff SUV&lt;/a&gt;s and several police and FIB officers guarding the area.\nThe player will be given a wanted level once they enter the area and police will give chase after stealing the cargo. They will need to lose their wanted level before reaching the warehouse.\nThere are five possible locations each consisting of the exact same set up:\nAir Drop.\nIn the beginning, each organization member is given 8 Flares. There are 2 types of the missions:\nStandard.\nThere will be a drop zone marked on the map, and the player(s) are required to throw a flare inside a marked area, after which the cargo will drop from the sky and is free to be taken. Only one flare is required to send the cargo down from the skies, and they immediately appear on the map once dropped.\nThe Valkyrie Issue.\nHarder than the standard type, a &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt; will appear, carrying the cargo and quickly flying away from the player. In order for the player to obtain the cargo, the Valkyrie must be destroyed, after which there will be a few soldiers parachuting down, with the number of them dependent on the number of cargo purchased (3 soldiers for the special item). Note the player must be careful to take out the Valkyrie, as the gunners on the helicopter will attack the player with miniguns and the autocannon.\nOn the ground, &lt;a href=\"Mesa\"&gt;Merryweather Mesa&lt;/a&gt;s may spawn as backup units, although there are examples where no further NPC pursuers arrive at all in certain scenarios.\nNotes.\nThe player can judge the mission type based on what the Assistant said on the phone. If the Assistant says \"It's being flown in...\" or \"It's coming in by plane...\", then it's safe to take the cargo without trouble.\nHowever, if the player hears \"regular\" dialogue: \"We're ready to go...\", \"Just pinged the collection location...\", or \"I've sent the collection point...\", then they must prepare for encountering the Valkyrie.\nPersonnel Issue.\nThe organization is blackmailed by the dealer, who only agrees to hand in the cargo if they take out some of the dealer's rivals. The organization members are then instructed to go to the vantage point, where a &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper\"&gt;Heavy Sniper&lt;/a&gt; spawns. Upon arrival, they will receive a text, hinting the targets, who are easily visible from the vantage point. Sniping is not compulsory and the players can kill them whatever way they want. Once all targets are dead, the players may get a wanted level, but a vehicle loaded with the cargo is now marked on the map. Players are then required to take it back to the warehouse, with no further resistance (target number/wanted level = crate number in regular, 3 targets for the special item).\nMultiple Vehicles.\nThere are 2 types of the missions:\nMap Searching.\nThere are multiple vehicles scattered around the map and are always on the move (van number = crate number +1 in regular, 4 vans for the special item). Only one of them contains the cargo the player needs to move closer to inspect them. The assistant will always text the player a message, either urging them to take the vehicle, or inform them to check others if it does not hold the cargo. Once the correct vehicle is identified, the organization can then take the vehicle and bring it back.\nTrackify Searching.\nSometimes, the game does not list them on the map, instead requiring the use of &lt;a href=\"Trackify\"&gt;Trackify&lt;/a&gt; app (replaces Securoserv icon). If this happens, the mission is made much harder, since it only lists a vague location and the direction, and that it only tracks targets through linear distance. A helicopter will make that slightly easier though (target number = crate number in regular, 3 targets for the special item).\nIn general, the last target to show up on the map or Trackify app is the actual cargo vehicle.\nThieves.\nWhen the player arrives at the location, it's revealed that thieves had stolen the player's cargo, and they are running away. They will not fight back, though a weapon can be dropped if they are killed. Their number depends on the number of crates brought. There will be no resistance after their death.\nAmbush.\nThere are 2 types of the missions:\nGang Ambush.\nShould it be an ambush by gang members, they will pretend to be normal workers, and there will be &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt;s parked nearby occupied by them. In the case of a gang ambush, The gang members will use the Bensons to block the player's way and attack the player who takes the cargo vehicle. Gang members must be killed before the cargo vehicle is able to be picked up.\nThere are ? possible locations each consisting of the exact same set up:\nPolice Ambush.\nPolice will ambush the player with &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Granger\"&gt;FIB Granger&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Cruiser\"&gt;Unmarked Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s. The player will gain a wanted level (wanted level = crate number in regular, 3-star wanted level for the special item) for just getting the target vehicle, although if another player destroys the police vehicles prior, it will take off some heat for the player who's stealing the vehicle.\nGang Fights.\nIn this mission, the player gets involved in a gang fight. When the player reached the collection point, two gangs will start a fight for the cargo vehicle. If one gang wins, one of them will get in the vehicle and drive away. The player has to observe them, find the right time, and take the vehicle.\nNote that if the player takes out the gangs before they start a fight, then other gang members will spawn to attack on the way back.\nThere are ? possible locations of the gang fights:\nCargo on the Sea.\nIn order to get the cargo, the player is tasked with destroy a &lt;a href=\"Marquis\"&gt;Marquis&lt;/a&gt;, which is carrying the cargo, along with two &lt;a href=\"Suntrap\"&gt;Suntrap&lt;/a&gt;s guarding the sailboat (6 enemies in total, two in each boat, with &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt;s).\nA &lt;a href=\"Dinghy%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Dinghy&lt;/a&gt; will spawn on the coast that is nearest to the Marquis; the player can drive it to approach and destroy the sailboat. The enemies will fight back, and even a &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt; spawns to attack.\nIf the player is wasted on the sea, they will spawn on a &lt;a href=\"Seashark\"&gt;Seashark&lt;/a&gt;.\nRobbed Cargos.\nFor some reasons, the cargo was robbed by the gang, the player have to take out the enemies and bring the cargo back to the warehouse. Once the player leaves the scene and carries cargo, enemies will arrive in vehicles and attack them (wave of enemies = crate number, 2 enemies in 2 vehicles for each wave).\nThere are 5 possible gangs that the player can be encountered:\nThe Police Transporter.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Police%20Transporter\"&gt;Police Transporter&lt;/a&gt; holding the cargo is on the move and has two &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; officers in it. Killing them and any responding police incurs a wanted level (wanted level = crate number in regular, 3-star wanted level for the special item).\nNote that the vehicle has a bulletproof windshield, so the occupants can only be killed through the side windows.\nPolice Confiscation.\nThe police have seized the vehicle and brought it to a police station. Several police officers are usually at the scene. Killing or even provoking them in any way will incur wanted levels (wanted level = crate number in regular, 3-star wanted level for the special item).\nThe following 2 missions were added in the update:\nAuto Shop.\nSome Special Cargo Crates are held at an Auto shop. The player must go to the location and retrieve them.\nRecover Valuables.\nThe player has to get satchel charges to be able to search some underwater containers, which contain valuables that can be used to trade for the cargo. After collecting the three valuables, they have to be brought to a safehouse, after which the player will recieve a van loaded with cargo."}

{"id": "184154", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=184154", "title": "Special Vehicle Stunt Races", "text": "Special Vehicle Stunt Races, also known as \"Special Vehicle Circuit\", are a variation of &lt;a href=\"Stunt%20Races\"&gt;Stunt Races&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", released on 14th March, 2017, as part of the update.\nDescription.\nSpecial Vehicle Stunt Races are specialized stunt races that are based around the unique abilities the &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Voltic\"&gt;Rocket Voltic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blazer%20Aqua\"&gt;Blazer Aqua&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ruiner%202000\"&gt;Ruiner 2000&lt;/a&gt; each have. The races are adapted to allow for fast-paced racing while still accommodating their individual abilities, such as the Ruiner 2000's jump functionality and paragliding technique, the Rocket Voltic's powerful rocket boost ability, and the Blazer Aqua's ability to transition from water to land easily.\nThe new races also add new props available in the &lt;a href=\"Creator\"&gt;Creator&lt;/a&gt;, including the Ability Recharge pad, which assumes a similar design to the green Boost pad featuring arrows. The Recharge pad is yellow and instantly recharges the vehicle's ability. If the ability is active and the player hits the recharge pad, the ability will continue without the player having to reactivate it, particularly useful when used in a chain (repeated pads one after another, seen present in many Rocket Voltic races). Recharges are also commonly found before the ability's usage, such as jumps for the &lt;a href=\"Ruiner%202000\"&gt;Ruiner 2000&lt;/a&gt;. The Blazer Aqua does not require recharges, and the parachute function on the Ruiner 2000 also does not require a recharge.\nAnother new prop is the Xero Gas blimp with a mounted marquee sign that reads \"GIVE YOUR CAR A BOOST\", and three other props indicate when to use abilities: a FlyUS \"Take Flight\" sign to jump over, a Ron Oil \"To the last DROP\" gantry to warn of a drop (has mounted diamond signs on the legs that show parachutes), and an Xero Gas \"Give your car a boost\" gantries to warn the player to activate their boost (has mounted diamond signs on the legs that show burning rocket boosters). There is no specific warning sign for the Blazer Aqua if entering water, but the Ron gantry is suitable for this.\nFurther new props are a hurdle for the Ruiner 2000 to jump over and neon stunt tubes. Up-pointing arrow tire walls help indicate that the Ruiner 2000 should jump.\nRuiner 2000.\nThe majority of Ruiner 2000's Special Vehicle Stunt Races are found high above Los Santos and San Andreas, often sporting challenging props to avoid by using the jump boost, while also featuring base jumping zones where the player should parachute onto a target in a similar manner to &lt;a href=\"Overtime%20Rumble\"&gt;Overtime Rumble&lt;/a&gt;.\nRocket Voltic.\nMany of the Rocket Voltic Special Vehicle Stunt Races make use of long straights or curves to form high-speed racing (centered around the boost), commonly presented with a mixture of \"wallrides\", where the track is placed on its side and the driver must keep the car vertically stable. Loops are also prominent during Rocket Voltic races, albeit much bigger in size compared to those in regular supercar &lt;a href=\"Stunt%20Races\"&gt;Stunt Races&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlazer Aqua.\nAs the Blazer Aqua has the capacity to traverse between water and land, all of its races are based on both water and land. Making use of its 4 wheels, tubes often represent pipework before plunging the player into water. The Blazer Aqua is also able to withstand being submerged for a brief moment, often caused when falling into water at high speed.\nList of Special Races.\nThere are currently 30 Special Vehicle Stunt Races, 20 were added with the initial release and 10 more were released on May 1st, &lt;a href=\"2018\"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, as part of the &lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicle%20Stunt%20Race%20Week\"&gt;Special Vehicle Stunt Race Week&lt;/a&gt; event. These are listed in the Stunt Races list, with the \"Ruiner 2000\", \"Rocket Voltic\", \"Blazer Aqua\", \"Deluxo\", \"Stromberg\" or \"Thruster\" notations. There are 6 Blazer Aqua races, 7 Rocket Voltic races, 7 Ruiner 2000 races, 4 Deluxo races, 3 Stromberg races, and 3 Thruster races."}

Associates will automaticly be invited and if they're in the office, they will automaticly join.\nIn the mission.\nSpecial Vehicle Work missions should not be very difficult and would not take more than 15 minutes, depending of the player's gameplay style. However, players must have good coordination, as these missions often requires teamwork, mainly for turreted vehicles and coordinated tactics, such as defending another player from enemies.

The front bumper seems to be inspired by the one found on the , and the bonnet vents seem to take inspiration from the Mercedes-McLaren SLR. The shape of the rear lights appears to be a combination of the lights on the and the aforementioned Aston Martin DB10.\nThe design of the car is relatively rounded and aerodynamic, where the front bumper mainly consists of a trapezium-shaped intake on the centre and two side intakes on a higher height, with an inset centre between these side intakes. The bonnet area features the corresponding Dewbauchee insignia on the centre and plastic housings on the sides, each one having dual, vertically-aligned circular lamps with plastic trim and carbon-fibre base. The same bonnet area has a slight bulge that curves to the sides and features dual meshed intakes near the windscreen, with two chrome separations over each one.\nThe sides of the car denote the narrow body with the bulky fenders, with the rear ones being wider than the front ones. Trapezoid-shaped exit vents with plastic trim can be seen around the front fenders, just over inset panels that align with the rest of the body as it approaches to the rear fender. The lower area features inset skirting areas fitted with small carbon-fibre strips at the bottom. The greenhouse area features black trim around the windows, carbon-fibre details on the A-pillars, sleek rear-view mirror wings and small rear-quarter windows, with no defined inner pillars between these and the door windows. The rear window features straight upper corners and rounded lower corners.\nThe rear of the car is distinctively curved, featuring a boot lip with a slightly larger centre and curved mouldings on the outer edges, as well as the manufacturer insignia on the centre of the boot lip. There is a set of red lights with a central red strip between these, along with a plastic strip between the side lights and below the aforementioned light strip. A curved section with a plastic detail spans the whole width of the car, surrounding the dual exit, dual chrome exhaust tips and a license plate with a plastic detail below it.\nThe underside of the car is mostly covered with carbon-fibre plating, leaving the axle sections exposed. The front plate comforms the lower front end with an elevated section spanning the same width as the front central intake, while a set of body-coloured panels comform the rest of the rear end, just beside the plastic centre.\nThe Specter is the first car to use its dedicated \"Specter\" interior; this interior features a wide driver-side dashboard containing a mostly rectangular cluster, having three analog dials centralized on the steering column. On the left there is a square-shaped aircon unit, while on the right there is a carbon-fibre strip on the central column, containing a triangle-shaped aircon unit over the radio set. The steering wheel features various switches and a horn cap bearing the manufacturer insignia, while a set of paddle shifters can be seen behind the steering wheel. The passenger side of the dashboard is seemingly curved and features a sectioned panel, featuring another square-shaped aircon unit. The central area between the seats have an automatic gear stick and what looks like an arm rest.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork, the rear panels on the underside and the paddle shifters on the interior, while the secondary colour is applied on the stitches found on the dashboard and the seats. The wheels feature a unique set of ten-spoke rims with grooves on each rim and a black centre bearing the Dewbauchee insignia. The car also uses low-profile tyres, with the rear ones having a wider track.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nAs expected from an exotic sports car, the vehicle performs very well, being one of the most well performing cars in its class. The car has decent acceleration, thanks to a very powerful engine which is given away by the amount of revs the car gives off under throttle. The car's front to rear length is surprisingly compact, given the lack of rear overhang, which lowers the chances of the vehicle spinning out of control under intense cornering. Overall, the car is similar to other cars in the Dewbauchee range, particularly the &lt;a href=\"Seven-70\"&gt;Seven-70&lt;/a&gt;, which shares a very similar overall design.\nBecause the front bonnet of the vehicle does not open, the engine is not visible. However, with the help of the Rockstar Editor, it becomes clear the vehicle lacks an engine model altogether. This is also the case on the &lt;a href=\"Specter%20Custom\"&gt;Custom&lt;/a&gt; version of the vehicle. The engine sound is roughly similar to the one from the &lt;a href=\"Schafter%20V12\"&gt;Schafter V12&lt;/a&gt;, with a slightly lower pitch."}

The vehicle does not appear to be based on any specific real-life motorsport vehicle, simply being a motorsport variant of the Specter (which is mainly based on the ). Its interior reuses the same dials and components as the standard version, although there are modifications that allow the car to use race-type components, being digital displays and switches in place of the radio set.\nColour distribution is more or less identical, where the primary colour is applied on the bodywork, rear panels and paddle shifters, while the secondary colour is applied on the interior stitching. A trim colour is also available for the dashboard panellings, surrounding of the dial cluster and aircon units, steering wheel, pedals, central section, doorcards and seats, as well as a dial colour. The vehicle retains the same wheel design as the standard model, but can also support a dedicated wheel colour (though only examples generated in the &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; may have a light blue colour).\nThe Specter Custom emits an electrical beep when the engine is turned off, the same sound effect is heard on the &lt;a href=\"Tempesta\"&gt;Tempesta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"811\"&gt;811&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nero%20Custom\"&gt;Nero Custom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Specter\"&gt;Specter&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Itali%20GTB%20Custom\"&gt;Itali GTB Custom&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nPerformamce-wise, the car remains identical to the regular Specter. The car receives upgrades in speed and acceleration, where the files list the car as being 0.2 km/h faster than the regular Specter. The car also gains upgraded handling thanks to the weight reduction.\nThe Specter Custom retains the same engine sound as the regular model, being similar to the &lt;a href=\"Schafter%20V12\"&gt;Schafter V12&lt;/a&gt;. Similar to the regular model, the car's bonnet is fixed and cannot be opened, and is also revealed that there is no engine model either."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Pegassi\"&gt;Pegassi&lt;/a&gt; in the HD Universe.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Speeder is designed as a classic speed boat, closely based on the and the .\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nThroughout the 3D Universe, the Speeder is generally depicted as a low-profile speedboat with a modern and sporty appearance, as well as with a large cockpit with four seats. Depending of the game, the boat assumes different designs:\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn , the Speeder seems to be based on the model featured in \"GTA San Andreas\", distinguished by the engine intake on the rear and the general windscreen profile, as well as the antenna on the back. Because of the perspective of the game the occupant's area seems to be smaller, as &lt;a href=\"Huang%20Lee\"&gt;Huang&lt;/a&gt; sits almost on the middle of the boat.\nThe boat spawns in a variety of colours for most of the body, with the portion on the engine compartment being white.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nReturning to and with the &lt;a href=\"Beach%20Bum%20Update\"&gt;Beach Bum Update&lt;/a&gt;, the Speeder features a long hull and a wooden finish on the upper portions, a metal reinforcement on the end of the bow, tall hand rails around the deck and small cleats near the windscreen, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Pegassi\"&gt;Pegassi&lt;/a&gt; emblem on the end of the deck and \"Speeder\" badges on either side of the bow. Small docking cleats and silver/chrome frames can be seen on the gunwales near the cabin quarters and the engine bay.\nThe cabin quarters feature a large windscreen on the front with silver/chrome trim and a wooden finish on the front quarter frames, which mount small circular lamps that are similar to the spotlights seen on &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser%20%28Disambiguation%29\"&gt;Police Cruisers&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the interior of the cabin has a wooden finish and features a black dashboard with the corresponding controls on the left, an unusable door on the right that leads to a living space, and a small cabinet on the far right. The seats are finished in white leather and arranged in a way that the captain sits in an independent bucket seat on the left side, and the passengers on a C-shaped bench seat. In the enhanced version, the boat uses analogue \"Truck\" dials also shared with other boats.\nTowards the stern, the engine bay has a sectioned wooden cover in the centre with a white leather outline and various steps whose upper surfaces also have a wooden finish, while small circular details can be seen on the rear end, finished in silver/chrome. \"Pegassi\" markings can seen on the sides of the stern, as well as a \"Speeder\" badge on the rear end. The propulsion system can be seen below.\nThe boat is painted with a primary colour for the hull and most of the occupant's area.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nDesigned as a lean watercraft, the Speeder is a good boat in terms of handling and speed, being the fastest boat in \"Grand Theft Auto III\" and \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\", the third fastest in \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" and \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", and the fourth fastest in \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\". All renditions share the same performance, according to the files, and use twin inboard engines with identical sounds with other boats in their respective games.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", the Speeder has very good top speed and acceleration, being able to compete with other boats in the same class, such as the &lt;a href=\"Jetmax\"&gt;Jetmax&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dinghy%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Dinghy&lt;/a&gt;, and also being able to outrun &lt;a href=\"Predator\"&gt;Police Predators&lt;/a&gt; with relative ease.\nThe Speeder is powered by twin inboard engines with propellers.

The hood is relatively simple and has a slanted profile.\nThe sides of the van makes use of small extensions/flares on the wheel arches, along with impressed lines on the sides and black door handles. The cabin area has black trim around the windows and two black rectangular mirrors near the A-pillars, while the rearmost area has a black strip surrounding the end of the cargo hold. Below the rearmost left section, there is the exhaust muffler and pipe exiting towards the left-hand side.\nThe rear end of the van is mostly occupied by the cargo doors, where the right one has a black section with the door handle and the license plate, while the left one bears a badge that reads \"Vapid ST\". The outer sides have vertical tail lights with a black surrounding, each one consisting of large red lights in the center and smaller turn/reverse lights on the upper/lower ends, respectively. Again, the van has a bulky black bumper.\nThe Speedo features various company names, such as &lt;a href=\"Deliver%20Me%20Timbers\"&gt;Deliver Me Timbers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Easy%20Lay%20Carpet\"&gt;Easy Lay Carpet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hello%20Tailor\"&gt;Hello Tailor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nonna%20Pina%27s\"&gt;Nonna Pina's Restaurant&lt;/a&gt;. It also spawns in a variety of single colors for the body and uses five-spoke angled rims, wrapped in medium-profile tires.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\", the Speedo retains the same design as the \"GTA IV\" rendition, albeit it no longer sports company logos. Small changes have been made to the van, such as the grille having fewer separations and fully finished in black, and the badging on the rear doors (the left door has the Vapid logo and grey lettering displaying the car's name, while the right door has silver \"VAPID\" lettering). The van also has an unknown window tint applied by default. In the enhanced version, the badge has been moved from the grille divider to the hood of the vehicle, similar to 1992\u20132003 Ford vans. The van's interior is also dirty, with some trash near the wheel humps.\nAgain, the van appears in a variety of single colors for the body and retains the same wheel design as in \"GTA IV\", being five-spoke angled rims with medium-profile tires.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe vehicle is quite agile, thanks to its adapted suspension and weightless rear end. Powersliding is quite easy in this vehicle; however, in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City's&lt;/a&gt; hilly terrain the Speedo is prone to bouncing about more frequently than other vehicles of its size. The engine is quite strong, leading to mediocre acceleration and a reasonable top speed. The lack of braking power, however, makes turning and braking simultaneously impossible, which is a big problem when slowing down into a 90 degree turn or any type of fast driving or racing. The Speedo is, after the &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt;, the second-fastest vehicle in the \"van\" classification, but it is the most maneuverable.\nThe vehicle is powered by what seems like a high-torque V8 diesel engine, with a 5-speed gearbox in a rear-wheel drive layout. The engine sound is shared from the other vans, namely the &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Pony\"&gt;Pony&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Speedo retains many of its performance qualities from its \"GTA IV\" appearance, although the reformed handling in \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\" results in the van gaining a suspension upgrade, to the point that the van feels more stable around corners, and thus its turning radius is greatly improved. The van has seemingly less traction than its previous appearance, sometimes resulting in the wheels spinning when setting off. The van is relatively durable during collisions, with no significant deformation occurring, even after multiple head on collisions and rolls, but the engine is still relatively weak compared to other vans in the game. It appears to have the highest top speed of vans in the game, wherein it seems to be superior to many average sedans in this field. Its off-road capabilities are significantly poorer than other vans due to the lower power engine.\nAgain, the vehicle is powered by a high-torque V8 diesel engine, with a 5-speed gearbox in a rear-wheel drive layout. The engine sound is relatively similar to the \"GTA IV\" iteration, also shared with vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Pony\"&gt;Pony&lt;/a&gt;.\nLiveries.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Speedo has four possible liveries in \"GTA IV\". The vehicle will appear in random colors with these liveries.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe Speedo is part of codice_1 \"codice_2\" which commonly appears driving in and out of alleyways and parking areas."}

The van received various changes in comparison to the regular model, where the front bumper features a shinier, chromed finish around the lower half and a singular flat meshed grille in place of the horizontal grille (likely to make room for the grille plating from the armor upgrades), while the hood assumes a bulkier appearance around the center. On the sides, the arches, particularly the rear ones, are extended and more defined, while the front quarter panels have vented sections with three horizontal chrome separations on them. The rear end of the van retains most of the features from the regular model, but the whole rear bumper has a shinier, chromed finish. The interior appears to be the same as the regular model, but the rear section and wheel wells are finished in a gray color instead of white. The vehicle can also be modified with an array of visual modifications, being armor plates, liveries and respray colors.\nThe primary color of the vehicle is applied to the entire body, while the secondary color is applied to the stripe passing around the sides and rear, just below the lower body line. It retains the same wheel design, being five-spoke angled rims with medium-profile tires.\nThe van can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with either two front-facing machine guns, a remote machine gun turret resembling a , or a remote &lt;a href=\"minigun\"&gt;minigun&lt;/a&gt; turret similar to a .\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Speedo Custom is overall superior to the original Speedo, with a slightly higher top speed and acceleration, together with better braking and handling overall. Still, the seeming lack of traction renders the van difficult to accelerate after being stopped, and the relatively light mass renders it unable to push other cars easily. The wedge provided by the \"Heavy Armor Plating\" upgrade allows the vehicle to push cars away slightly better, although it is still not very effective due to the light weight.\nLike the regular Speedo, the vehicle is powered by a high-torque V8 diesel engine, with a 5-speed gearbox in a rear-wheel-drive layout. The engine sound is the same as the regular Speedo, the &lt;a href=\"Clown%20Van\"&gt;Clown Van&lt;/a&gt; and other similar vans.\nArmor.\nDespite having three different levels of armor upgrades, none of them make the van any more durable, as the van will still explode with only a single explosive near the body, unless the player is in a &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs/Sell%20Goods\"&gt;Sell Goods&lt;/a&gt; mission, which gains increased resistance and immunity to missile lock-ons. However, the cabin has bullet-resistant windows similar to vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Schafter%20V12%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;Schafter V12 (Armored)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Baller%20LE%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;Baller LE (Armored)&lt;/a&gt;, giving the occupants slight protection against most firearms before being shattered.\nThe Speedo Custom can be equipped with additional Armor Plating that will primarily affect the windows. Adding any Armor Plating will take away the ability for occupants to use throwable weapons.\nWeaponry.\nThe Speedo Custom has access to an array of weapons operated by the driver:\nNote that, while both remote turrets have a limited elevation angle of about 20 degrees, the Remote .50 Cal is able to aim up to 55 degrees with the \"Hood view\" enabled, making it deadly against targets almost above the van.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMachine Gun=\n.50 Cal=\nMinigun=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Speedo Custom can only be modified at the &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;Vehicle Workshop&lt;/a&gt; inside a &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs\"&gt;Nightclub&lt;/a&gt;."}

The cornering radius and brakes are also improved, but not to the same extent as the aforementioned straight-line performance changes. Its mass was also reduced by 100 kilograms, compared to the base model. Despite these upgrades, there are still a few sports cars that can surpass the Sprunk Buffalo.\nLike the normal Buffalo S, the Sprunk Buffalo is powered by a twin-cam, straight-4 engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front-engine, rear wheel drive layout. It also shares the same high-revving sound."}

In a &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader\"&gt;Lifeinvader&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Warstock%20Cache%20%26amp%3B%20Carry\"&gt;Warstock Cache &amp; Carry&lt;/a&gt;, under the \"ATV\" category, there is a &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt;-based vehicle that matches with the description of the unused assets, implying that this vehicle is the Squaddie. Low-detailed examples can be also seen in the same picture, on the image of the beta &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;.\nBased on the image, this version combined elements from the and a / (specifically the variant, given the configuration). The front grille, headlights, hood, flared fenders and bottom sides were identical to the &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt;, but featured a small utility bumper, non-chromed front section, a square-shaped cabin, a split windshield and what seems to be a black air intake snorkel on the hood. The rear appears to feature side guard rails and canopy frames over it, presumably having enough room for passengers, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bison\"&gt;Bison&lt;/a&gt;. Like the &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt;, the vehicle featured a desert camo livery.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Squaddie makes a return to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" with the same layout as the beta model. However, its general design leans more towards the HMMWV/M1097 than the Hummer H2 (more similar to &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; iterations of the &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt;), though still retaining the core body profile and dimensions of \"GTA V\"'s Patriot, which is based on a H2.\nThe vehicle assumes a more utilitarian appearance than before, featuring a bulky bumper with a wide guard that spans the whole width of the truck. Its front end assume a more unique design in comparison to the Patriot, featuring circular headlights and turn signals on the same locations as its civilian counterpart, along with a sectioned grille and a small \"Mammoth\" badge just above the same. The hood features two black slatted vents on the center, two small hooks and rubber details, along with a long body-colored air intake snorkel on the right. Like the Patriot, the front section hinges from the front and opens forward to reveal the engine bay.\nThe sides of the truck have similar features to the regular Patriot and the beta model, being the flared fenders, flared bottom side and the formations on the middle section. However, it has a shorter cabin with similar design and features to the beta model. It also uses large rectangular doors with a cross-shaped pattern on the lower side, visible hinges, black door handles and larger rear-view mirrors. The rear section of the truck is occupied by a long bed with bench seats inside, black rails on the upper borders and amber lights on the rearmost sides, along with a long exhaust stack on the left and step bars on the rear quarters. The frames on the truck bed no longer comes as standard, though restorable when modified.\nThe rear end of the truck is rather unique, featuring a large tailgate on the center that is used by the back passengers when entering or exiting the vehicle, and a black utility bumper with hooks, step bars and a driver-side license plate (with the hooks being identical to the ones on the &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;). The tail lights are the same ones from the &lt;a href=\"Winky\"&gt;Winky&lt;/a&gt;, being a set of outer circular main lights and inner split brake lights.\nThe interior of the truck is roughly similar to the Winky, sharing the same \"Dominator\" dials and layout on the center, the switches around the dashboard and the specifications plate on the passenger side (albeit removing the original \"Winky\" text on it). Within the driver side, there are warning stickers unique to this vehicle.\nThe primary color of the truck is applied on most of the bodywork, while the secondary color is applied on the doors and the roof. It uses a set of plain rims similar to the ones from the Winky, albeit with a black center and wrapped in high-profile tires. The rims can also support a dedicated color, although only naturally-generated examples may have one. Unlike the beta model, it no longer has the traditional desert camo livery, but instead uses standard camo liveries from the update.\nThe Squaddie\u2019s horn is shared with both the &lt;a href=\"Marquis\"&gt;Marquis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kurtz%2031%20Patrol%20Boat\"&gt;Kurtz 31 Patrol Boat&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nIn comparison to the &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt;, the Squaddie performs quite better on off-road environments thanks to its slightly higher top speed and better handling. Acceleration and braking seems to be a bit lower to the regular Patriot, and its rather light weight renders it unable to push similarly-sized vehicles easily. Unlike most DLC vehicles, the Squaddie can be deformed quite easily, likely due to it being a restored vehicle from the &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;Beta&lt;/a&gt; version.\nThe vehicle is powered by an inline-4 engine similar to the &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Patriot%20Stretch\"&gt;Stretch variant&lt;/a&gt;, but lacking any sort of throttle bodies. It has a 5-speed gearbox and an all-wheel-drive layout, with a distribution of 40% to the front and 60% to the rear. Its engine sound is also similar to most SUVs and pickup trucks, with an additional tone similar to the &lt;a href=\"Barrage\"&gt;Barrage&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Winky\"&gt;Winky&lt;/a&gt;.\nInstalling any \"Bodywork\" modification will increase its traction slightly, in the same way as a spoiler."}

{"id": "2375", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2375", "title": "Squalo", "text": "The Squalo (spelt Squallo in \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\") is a in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series, available in ', ', \"\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\". It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Grotti\"&gt;Grotti&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA IV\", and &lt;a href=\"Shitzu\"&gt;Shitzu&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA V\".\nDescription.\nThroughout its appearances, the Squalo is easily recognisable as one of the speedboats featured in the series. Colour variations may also differ between games. In its original appearance in \"GTA Vice City\", the boat comes with a combination of a constant white with a variable bright colour, while later renditions feature more flexible colour choices.\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nIn ' and ', the design of the Squalo closely resembles a (which was a vehicle used in the 1980s TV show '), with elements from the Wellcraft Scarab 38 KV. In ', however, the design leans more towards the Scarab 38 KV, albeit with a curved windscreen.\nThe Squalo assumes an aerodynamic design with a large profile, featuring a long hull with a bow that takes almost half the length of the whole boat and two rectangular sections finished in black. The cabin quarters are generally ample and feature traditional front seats and an unusable rear bench seat. Towards the stern area, there is the engine bay, the twin outboard engines and four propulsion jets/nozzles. The renditions of the Squalo in \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA San Andreas\" are specifically given \"\"Squalo II\" and \"Squalo III\"\" names, respectively, suggesting a series of Squalos were released over time.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nFor \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the Squalo takes inspiration from boats such as the Sea Ray 210 Overnighter and the Fibrafort 265.\nThe Squalo assumes a more curved and modern design, but is comparably shorter than its earlier counterparts. The boat features a bulky hull with a circular hatch on the deck and small cleats near the windscreen, while the cabin quarters are seemingly open towards the stern and feature four seats for the occupants. The stern/rear end features a wide swim step and the propulsion system below.\nThe Squalo will spawn either with or without a spoiler over the cabin quarters, similarly to the 3D Universe renditions. It is assigned a primary colour for the lower portions of the hull, most of the outer edges and most of the optional spoiler, and a secondary colour for the upper portions of the hull, the upper deck of the bow, part of the gunwales and the upper frontal portions of the spoiler.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\"and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Squalo remains largely similar to the \"GTA IV\" rendition, albeit with small differences. The bow has a set of circular headlights added and the hatch on the deck is painted, while the cabin quarters and swim step on the stern area gain a white finish. However, it has a reduced capacity, as the rear seats were removed. In the enhanced version, the boat uses analogue \"Truck\" dials also shared with other boats.\nColour distribution remains similar to the \"GTA IV\" iteration, although the lower portions of the cabin quarters are painted with the primary colour.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe Squalo, like any high-end speedboat, possesses excellent speed and is the \"fastest boat\" as mentioned in &lt;a href=\"The%20Fastest%20Boat\"&gt;one of Diaz's missions in \"GTA Vice City\"&lt;/a&gt;. Like any high-performance boat, the Squalo is capable of turning on a dime when the throttle is applied.\nAll renditions of the Squalo are powered by twin outboard engines, and use a mid-revving engine sound shared with other boats, with the \"GTA San Andreas\" iteration being seemingly lower-pitched, sharing this sound with all other boats in the same game.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Squalo performs as well as in the 3D Universe, having good speed and good acceleration. While it is not as fast as the &lt;a href=\"Jetmax\"&gt;Jetmax&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Smuggler\"&gt;Smuggler&lt;/a&gt;, the Squalo possesses rather impressive handling, given its shorter design.\nThe Squalo is powered by twin inboard engines with propellers. It uses a high-revving and high-pitched engine sound also shared with other speedboats. \n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Squalo remains a relatively fast boat, and while still inferior to the &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20Jetmax\"&gt;Jetmax&lt;/a&gt;, it possesses good handling. Due to the revised water physics, the Squalo may experience some reduction of speed while sorting out waves.\nAgain, the Squalo is powered by twin inboard engines with propellers. It shares the engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20R\"&gt;Turismo R&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feltzer\"&gt;Feltzer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carbonizzare\"&gt;Carbonizzare&lt;/a&gt;.\nStatic Variants.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nA different Squalo can be found at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Lifeguard\"&gt;Los Santos Lifeguard&lt;/a&gt; facilities but is a prop rather than a vehicle so is unusable by the player. It can be distinguished by a weathered gradient striped paint job, name and numbering on the side and a distinctive timber deck. They sit on dual-axle trailers (whereas the standard Squalo trailer is a single-axle). One is attached to a &lt;a href=\"Power%20Metal\"&gt;Power Metal&lt;/a&gt; lifeboat crane at the end of the pier at &lt;a href=\"Chumash\"&gt;Chumash&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "2377", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2377", "title": "Stafford", "text": "The Stafford is a vintage, ultra-luxury four-door sedan featured in \"\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the update, released on July 31st, 2018, during the &lt;a href=\"Tale%20of%20Us%20Residency%20Week\"&gt;Tale of Us Residency Week&lt;/a&gt; event. It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Enus\"&gt;Enus&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Stafford is overall based on the , with the front fascia most likely inspired by a , a one-off model of the .\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe car returns again as a luxury Rolls-Royce-inspired car, albeit assuming an older design, mainly based around the . Both the front fascia and rear fascia, as well as the side profile of the vehicle, are largely inspired by the , as indicated by the grille design and structure, the headlights, front and rear bumpers with overriders, trim around the car, a partially covered rear wheel, and the rear light cluster. The front bumper also appears with additional lamps mounted onto it and directional markers on top of the fenders, also inspired by the Mark IX. Some of the side profiling is also reminiscent, to a lesser extent, of the , which features extensive fender lines and body curves.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Stafford is notable for being significantly smoother, longer, wider and taller than most other sedans. The car features a square grille, square headlamps, rectangle tail lamps and silver bumpers. It is available in a variety of single colours.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Stafford is distinctive by its classic styling and chrome elements around it. The front of the car is very long and is dominated by the tall grille, the chrome bumper with large overriders, and the circular headlamps with chrome details around them. The bonnet area features two engine compartments, a central chrome strip and a grille ornament.\nThe sides of the car uses curved, bulky fenders, together with flared arches, flared skirting area and rear body plates covering the upper third part of the wheel. Chrome details can be seen on the upper area passing from the grille to the door handles, as well as on the lower area passing from the front quarters to the rear end. The greenhouse area is again predominated by chrome trimmings around the windows, also featuring circular rear-view mirrors finished in chrome\nThe rear of the car is distinctively curved, featuring a large boot with chrome license plate lights and handle. The outer edges feature a dual set of upper amber lamps and lower red lamps, surrounded by chrome details. Again, there is a chrome bumper with large overriders. When the boot is open, it reveals an elevated compartment with a hatch, likely for the spare wheel.\nInside the car, the Stafford reuses the &lt;a href=\"Roosevelt\"&gt;Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt;'s interior, with small additions and removals; a chrome centre mirror has been mounted on the centre dashboard, a small radio set is attached underneath the dashboard, the gear shifter has been removed and ancillary control handles have been added to the steering column. The door panels also feature door cards with handles and window crank handles. Like the real counterpart, the Stafford features two chairs positioned closely together in the front and a bench seat in the rear.\nThe Stafford assigns the primary colour for the upper side and the secondary colour for the lower side and the stitching around the seats, the latter being a bit different from most cars. A trim colour is also available for the interior. The stock rims share the same design from the \u2018Smoothie\u2019 wheels from &lt;a href=\"Benny%27s%20Original%20Motor%20Works/Wheels\"&gt;Benny\u2019s Original Motorworks&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with an added whitewall tyre.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe car's ride and brakes perform more smoothly when compared to other vehicles. The car's performance is average-to-good. With average acceleration and a good top speed, the car is considerably speedy. However, its heavy weight and rear-wheel-drive drivetrain may result in some significant oversteer, or even spin-outs when accelerating during a turn. Its height, combined with a wheelbase too narrow to compensate, makes the car somewhat unstable, and its durability is average.\nIt can be noted that driving the Stafford boosts CJ's &lt;a href=\"Statistics%23Sex%20Appeal\"&gt;sex appeal&lt;/a&gt; significantly, which makes it a car of choice to pick up &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;girlfriends&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Stafford appears to be powered by a V8 engine with a RWD configuration. Acceleration is terrible and top speed is somewhat below average. The car's low torque will make it struggle when climbing steep slopes, but this also results in minimal wheel spin when taking off. Braking is average. Handling wise, the steering feels firm and is adequate when slowly driving around corners, but tends to understeer at higher speeds. The suspension is rather soft and bouncy, as fitting for a vehicle designed for luxury. Body roll can be seen when turning.\nOverall the Stafford is much better suited for cruising around at lower speeds and for situations where high intensity driving is not required."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Classique\"&gt;Classique&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vapid\"&gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\", the Stallion resembles a . However, the hood is more alike the Pontiac GTO.\nStallions are seen in a variety of single colors and with a hardtop roof.\n\"3D Universe\".\nIn the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, the Stallion appears to be based mainly on the (also the ) in the front end, while the back end is closer to the '70-'72 Cutlass. The hood scoop seems to have been influenced by the , which is a platform-mate of the Cutlass. The notchback roofline, the smaller size and the name could be nods to the 1st generation . \nAll renditions of the Stallion remained largely the same, retaining the front bumper with fog lights, dual grilles, circular headlights, twin ram-air hood, square tail lights on either side of the rear bumper and twin exhaust pipes. However, there are small differences between each models, depending of the game's settings:\nLiberty City and Vice City versions may spawn with an open top or soft top, while the San Andreas version features a hard top. The soft top always has a secondary color, but the hard top has the car's primary color.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Stallion makes a return in \"GTA IV\", where it is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Classique\"&gt;Classique&lt;/a&gt;. The grille and lights remain almost unchanged, but the body more resembles a ; the rear end looks like that of a 1971 or '72 Cutlass (it says \"STALLION\" above the bumper much like it says \"OLDSMOBILE\") with extra lights. The headlights are surrounded by headlight bezels similar to those on a '68 Cutlass.\nThe Stallion assumes a similar layout to the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; renditions, only with a larger body and slightly narrower front. The front fascia retains the bumper, grille and headlight placement, though the lower fog lights are no longer present. The car also retains the twin ram-air hood and opens to reveal a V8 engine with a strut brace over it, while circular mirrors are seen mounted on the front fenders, just beside the hood. The cabin area adds rear-quarter windows and a passenger-side antenna next to the trunk compartment, while the rear bumper adds two rectangular turn signals between the square red tail lights and the central license plate, though it does not have any reversing lights (similar to the &lt;a href=\"Intruder\"&gt;Intruder&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Contender\"&gt;Contender&lt;/a&gt;). A single exhaust pipe can be seen on the driver side.\nAgain, the vehicle may spawn with a colored hard top or a black soft top, the latter being either folded up or down. It can spawn in a variety of primary colors for the body and the hard top, and uses a set of five-spoke wheels and medium-profile tires.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn \"\", there are two versions depending of the platform:\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Stallion returns in the enhanced version of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", this time manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt; (albeit still possessing &lt;a href=\"Classique\"&gt;Classique&lt;/a&gt; badging on the car itself). It appears relatively unchanged in terms of design from its \"GTA IV\" counterpart.\nIt can be obtained in two variants, the stock car and the street versions, with the latter being available in hardtop and convertible forms. When purchased, the Stallion will always spawn without a roof. Currently, the soft-top/hardtop forms can only be found spawning on the streets in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\". Since the &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events%20Update\"&gt;Freemode Events Update&lt;/a&gt;, however, it is possible to buy the roof in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, though it still does not offer any visual modifications.\nAgain, the car only spawns in a single color for the body and the hard top, and the rims were slightly changed, being similar to the \"Kracka\" rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n2D Universe.\nThe Stallion is one of the fastest cars on the road.\n3D Universe.\nThe Stallion's handling varies in each game. In \"GTA III\", \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", it has reasonable acceleration, though its rear wheel drive layout and huge amount of low-down torque led to it being easy to perform professional-grade drifts around corners, doughnuts and wheel-spin when taking off. \nThe \"GTA Vice City Stories\" version is altogether slower than the other renditions, but its tail-happy traits remained. In \"GTA San Andreas\", it handles much like the &lt;a href=\"Clover\"&gt;Clover&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sabre\"&gt;Sabre&lt;/a&gt; (even having the same engine sound to the latter), but fishtailing rarely occurs.\nUnlike most other muscle cars, the Stallion has a low-revving V8 that sounds more like an inline engine (except in \"GTA San Andreas\"), coupled to a four-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. The engine sound is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Manana\"&gt;Manana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Perennial\"&gt;Perennial&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Idaho\"&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" the Stallion is easier to steer, but it will occasionally spin out of control, especially in poor weather conditions such as rain. With good power, handling, and acceleration it is easily one of the top three muscle cars in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", thanks to its 5.7 liter (347ci) twin-cam V8 engine, the 5-speed gearbox and the FR layout. Care should be taken through corners though; despite having good grip, the Stallion is awful at keeping flat through corners. The Stallion can also be quite bumpy on the road. Braking is below average. Durability is poor, as the vehicle can only take few hits before catching fire.\nThe vehicle uses a loud engine sound, shared with muscle cars like the &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20Turbo\"&gt;Sabre GT&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20%28car%29\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe \"\" rendition adopts a combination of performance traits of previous renditions, with high top speed and acceleration and good steering, but very poor grip as a result of excess torque, resulting in the Stallion skidding frequently, even in slight turns. It competes with the &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20%28car%29\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Stallion shares the same engine and drivetrain, but sporting different performance, having worse acceleration than in \"GTA IV\", but a higher top speed, and much better handling. The car no longer spins out of control when cornering at high speeds.\nAgain, the car has a 5.7 liter (347ci) twin-cam V8 engine, a 5-speed gearbox and an FR layout. It uses a low-revving sound shared with cars like the &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20%28car%29\"&gt;Blade&lt;/a&gt;.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", the Stallion can be modified only at &lt;a href=\"TransFender\"&gt;TransFender&lt;/a&gt;:\nGallery.\nDesign.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nStandard=\nSoft-top=\nTopless=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The entire complex consists of two structures: A single tower to the north, and a taller terraced structure to the south; the main entrance is only seen at the northern wing. The back of the building is a point of interest. It features numerous tables, palm trees, bushes, and a sloped pool with a series of diving boards in order of size from smallest to biggest. It also has a boardwalk in the back leading to the beach. These features imply that Standing Vice Point functions as either a hotel, an upscale apartment, or both.\nDue to the earlier setting of \"GTA Vice City Stories\", &lt;a href=\"1984\"&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt;, certain features in the building have yet to be constructed or put in.

A stone pillar has also been included at the main entrance, displaying a large yellow S logo, presumably denoting the \"Standing\" portion of the building's name. In \"GTA Vice City Stories\", these features are absent.\nGlitch.\nIn \"GTA Vice City Stories\", there is a glitch involving a large tree and the wall towards the back. This glitch will cause the players to run through the wall and end up outside of the walled-in area. To do this, players must go to the gate leading down to the beach, and then locate the biggest tree just north of it.

The icon will appear on the map as soon as the player enters a Free Mode session. Each player will have their own Stash House location which will persist through session changes for the duration of the day. The location will change at the same time as the &lt;a href=\"Gun%20Van\"&gt;Gun Van&lt;/a&gt;, at 07:00 UTC.\nThere is a purple &lt;a href=\"Corona\"&gt;Corona&lt;/a&gt; marking the entry point. There is usually a security camera outside the entrance, but it cannot be disabled and the player always kicks down the door to break in. If a player has an active &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organization&lt;/a&gt; with associates, is a &lt;a href=\"SecuroServ\"&gt;SecuroServ&lt;/a&gt; VIP with bodyguards. or is an &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;MC Club&lt;/a&gt; president with members, the affiliated players will not see the map marker or corona until their leader enters. They will be prompted to also enter, and a yellow Entrance marker will appear on their map and a yellow corona will appear at the entry for them to follow their leader inside. Affiliate player's own Stash House marker may disappear while they are \"employed\". Players with a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Wanted Level&lt;/a&gt; are not allowed to enter the Stash House. \nOnce inside, players must eliminate the five hostile enemy gang members.\nThere is a locked safe inside containing the target reward but the player needs to locate a yellow \"postit\" note with one of ten possible three-number combinations to the safe before it can be opened. If explosives or the &lt;a href=\"Up-n-Atomizer\"&gt;Up-n-Atomizer&lt;/a&gt; were used to clear the room, furniture or bodies may obscure the combination and may need to be moved again to be able to read it.\nAfter opening the safe with the combination, the player leaves the Stash House and has to leave the area to complete the mission. At least two waves of enemy reinforcements (more if there are multiple players on the job) will arrive in vehicles to pursue the player. If the player is &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;Wasted&lt;/a&gt; after leaving the Stash House before managing to leave the area, they will re-spawn with the package still in their possession and will still just need to leave the area to successfully complete the job.\nThe pursuing enemies do not need to be evaded or killed to complete the job. As soon as the player reaches the required distance from the Stash House, any pursuing gang members will instantly de-spawn. Their vehicles will not disappear though, and they will be driven by standard non-hostile NPCs. However they are still considered mission vehicles so cannot be stored and converted to personal vehicles.\nLocations.\nThere are 25 possible locations of the active Stash House.\nCo-locations with Gang Attacks and/or G's Cache.\nTwo stash house locations need to be approached with caution as they may spawn within an active &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Attacks\"&gt;gang attack&lt;/a&gt; zone. The attack should be dealt with first (by either completing it or escaping to a safe distance to cancel out the attack). The locations are: Cherry Pie Farm and Miller's Fishery. The Fishery location is also the only site that is also a possible &lt;a href=\"G%27s%20Caches\"&gt;G's Cache&lt;/a&gt; spawn point, allowing both to be completed in one stop. The Altruist Camp location, while not a Gang Attack zone, remains dangerous as the cult members will attack the player (if cleared out before entering the Stash House, the cultists will respawn after a couple of minutes, likely in time for the player to emerge from the stash house).\nRewards.\nThe player reward can be supplies for any player-owned business that is running and increments of $500 the longer the player spent inside the Stash House. If the player doesn't own any business, they will receive 1000&lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;RP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;30,000 directly."}

Several stairways around the courtyard lead up from the roadside to the main entrance. The building is built on four large pillars which hold the main tower.

The Hurricanes Gordy and Hermione play a major role in the storyline, serving as a plot device to prevent the player from accessing future unlockable areas.\nAttractions and Landmarks.\nFlorida is world-renowned for its beach resorts and amusement parks such as &lt;a href=\"Fun%20World\"&gt;Fun World&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"National%20Aeronautics%20and%20Space%20Administration\"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; also operates a field center in the state.\nTransportation.\nUnlike the real-life counterpart, neither Florida nor Vice City have any metrorail systems, and they are not mentioned to exist in any form.\nFlorida has only one known/named public airport, that being the &lt;a href=\"Escobar%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Escobar International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, serving Vice City.\n&lt;a href=\"Bayshore%20Avenue\"&gt;Bayshore Avenue&lt;/a&gt; is also implied to be part of Florida's highway system in promotional postcards.\nSports.\nFlorida has only one known football team, the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Mambas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City Mambas&lt;/a&gt;. Media celebrity &lt;a href=\"BJ%20Smith%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;BJ Smith&lt;/a&gt; used to be a former tight end for the Vice City Mambas football team, as well as running illegal businesses in Florida.\nThe Mambas are not physically seen in-game, except for a cameo appearance in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\".\nReligion.\nFlorida in the 1980s has rich and diverse religious cultures, although they are never used as a plot device in the games.\nThe most notable religious figure is Florida's resident televangelist and celebrity &lt;a href=\"Pastor%20Richards\"&gt;Pastor Richards&lt;/a&gt;, originated from Mars, Alabama, depicted as a maniac firebrand preacher obsessed with money, who the authorities believe to be embezzling money from his \"Salvation Statue\" fund for a private mansion in Hawaii.\nPresent Day.\nLittle information is given about Florida in the 21st century.\nThe last chronological mention of the state in the \"GTA\" series occurs in &lt;a href=\"Kent%20Paul%27s%2080%27s%20Nostalgia%20Zone%21\"&gt;Kent Paul's 80's Nostalgia Zone!&lt;/a&gt;, an in-universe blog written by &lt;a href=\"Kent%20Paul\"&gt;Kent Paul&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2002\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt; as part of his therapy. In the blog, Paul recalls his time in Florida in the 1980s and mentions Vice City's \"social problems\", with a little footnote directed to crime kingpin Tommy Vercetti, suggesting he is still a powerful person in Florida as of 2002.\nFlorida is also mentioned as a destination for vacations in \"Grand Theft Auto III\" and \"Manhunt 2\".\nPostcards.\nVice City postcards available on &lt;a href=\"Kent%20Paul%27s%2080%27s%20Nostalgia%20Zone%21\"&gt;Kent Paul's 80's Nostalgia Zone!&lt;/a&gt; promotional website for \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nHD Universe.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;Rockstar North&lt;/a&gt; preserved the previous fictional names of cities and states after the series' reboot in 2008, Vice City was also introduced originally as a city in the state of \"Florida\" in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.It was only mentioned in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and briefly in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\". In subsequent mentions in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", Vice City's mentions are no longer accompanied by the state's name, foreshadowing the state's rebranding.\nFlorida was eventually rendered non-canon to the HD Universe, in favor of the addition of the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Leonida\"&gt;State of Leonida&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto VI&lt;/a&gt;\", which hosts the cities of &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Beach%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice Beach&lt;/a&gt; (both originally treated as Florida locations) and several satirical reinterpretations of real-life Floridian counties.\nThe \"\"&lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City, Leonida&lt;/a&gt;\" rebranding is exclusive to the HD Universe and does not affect the established \"&lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City, Florida&lt;/a&gt;\"\" from previous titles, as the 3D Universe trilogy is set in a completely separate canon."}

However, only a small section of North Yankton is accessible, specifically the region around the town of &lt;a href=\"Ludendorff\"&gt;Ludendorff&lt;/a&gt;, as deviating from the game's pre-determined route will result in mission failure. This is because the rest of the map doesn't physically exist and several areas are not rendered, being replaced by background textures.\nThe main road in Ludendorff is &lt;a href=\"Cavalry%20Boulevard\"&gt;Cavalry Boulevard&lt;/a&gt;, which has a railway line running across it, but if the player deviates from the road, the roads and rails will also begin to lose textures. Trees are also missing textures, except the closest ones, and some are placed over the roads. Missing terrains are at least the same, with fake fences rounding large portions of the map.\nWith the exception of breakable objects around the &lt;a href=\"Ludendorff%20Church%20and%20Cemetery\"&gt;Ludendorff Church and Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, most objects in the area, such as stop signs, trashcans and fences are unbreakable compared to their &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; counterparts. This is due to the fact that North Yankton doesn't allow the player to explore. In addition, the warning lights on the &lt;a href=\"Railroad%20Crossings\"&gt;railroad crossings&lt;/a&gt; always flash.\nTraffic paths do exist for North Yankton, and unique, snow-covered versions of vehicles found outside the state can be observed driving on Cavalry Boulevard and some of the other streets surrounding Ludendorff.\nNorth Yankton is so far the only location in the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series that is completely landlocked.\nEvents.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nCash Depot Robbery.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, nine years before the main events of \"GTA V\", &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael Townley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Brad%20Snider\"&gt;Brad Snider&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;robbed&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Bobcat%20Security%20Depot\"&gt;Bobcat Cash Depot&lt;/a&gt; in Ludendorff. The &lt;a href=\"North%20Yankton%20State%20Patrol\"&gt;North Yankton State Patrol&lt;/a&gt; swarmed the scene and chased the three men as they tried to escape to their getaway helicopter. The &lt;a href=\"Rancher%20XL\"&gt;SUV&lt;/a&gt; they were riding in was hit by a train and disabled, so the trio escaped on foot to their destination. A sniper, &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Norton\"&gt;Dave Norton&lt;/a&gt;, hid around a corner and attempted to kill Trevor but missed. However, he managed to kill Brad. He also shot Michael (in reality, Dave shot Michael as it was their backup plan if he missed Trevor). Trevor is forced to fend off the approaching police by himself before fleeing. A funeral for Michael is then shown at a cemetery, while Michael watches on from a distance and flicks away his cigarette. \nSometime between 2004 and 2013, Michael and his family, who had assumed new identities, and Trevor had all moved to &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;.\nCemetery Shootout.\nNorth Yankton is visited again in &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt; during the mission &lt;a href=\"Bury%20the%20Hatchet\"&gt;Bury the Hatchet&lt;/a&gt; by Trevor, who was determined to find out who was really buried in Michael's grave after the bank robbery, despite Michael's attempts to talk him out of it. Michael followed him in an attempt to stop him. Trevor arrives at the cemetery and exhumes the grave, and his suspicions are confirmed when he opens the coffin and finds Brad Snider's body inside. Following this, the two were attacked by &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Triads\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt; who were hunting for Trevor; Trevor escaped from the cemetery, leaving Michael to fight the Triads alone. Michael fights his way through the Triads, but he is captured when he reaches his &lt;a href=\"Asea\"&gt;Asea&lt;/a&gt;, due to it being immobilized by Trevor.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nLudendorff is first introduced in the Bottom Dollar Bounties update. As this area is exclusively a Survival game mode setting, it plays no role in the storyline of \"GTA Online\".\nLaw Enforcement.\nThe police seen in Ludendorff are State Police, evidenced by text on the cars. As of 2004, the state police drive white &lt;a href=\"Police%20Roadcruiser\"&gt;Police Roadcruiser&lt;/a&gt;s with two stripes down the side and \"STATE PATROL\" next to the front door, similar to that of a North Dakota state police car, with the police emblem engraved on the front doors. They also use &lt;a href=\"Police%20Rancher\"&gt;Police Rancher&lt;/a&gt;s with the same livery. Due to the snowy weather, the cars are fitted with snow chains on the tires to allow for better traction on the road. The cars also have a snow-covered texture. State troopers wear black coats over white shirts with black ties, and light brown pants and can sometimes be seen wearing winter hats.\nSnowy Vehicles.\nNumerous snowy vehicles can be seen driving around North Yankton at the times it is visited. These vehicles are only ever seen during the two missions they appear in (where more variations are seen in the second of the two missions), and are scripted only to appear during the mission. As such, the vehicles will not be seen driving around if the map is reached outside of the missions.\nIf the player was to gain a wanted level while in North Yankton reached with the use of glitches or mods, police vehicles will spawn on and follow the roads as normal, as the roads feature their own paths for the missions. This is because LSPD spawned in a wanted level are not restricted to Los Santos, and are simply spawned on any roads belonging to Los Santos, which is also why normal cars do not appear in North Yankton off-mission. This means North Yankton's road paths are linked to Los Santos's.\nInfluence.\nNorth Yankton may be based upon the state of . Very little is known about the state; however, the small town of &lt;a href=\"Ludendorff\"&gt;Ludendorff&lt;/a&gt; is located in the state, a city based on and . The state's name is derived from the . This is similar to how North Dakota is named after the . The state itself may be named after , which was the capital of the until it was split into the present day North and South Dakota. There is a in , right across the from Yankton, South Dakota."}

The in-game San Andreas is square-shaped and its area is estimated to be 33 square kilometres in size (12.7 square miles), the largest setting in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series up until\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\"'s rendition of part of the same &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe state is divided into three cities and five counties: the cities of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;; and the counties of &lt;a href=\"Red%20County\"&gt;Red County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flint%20County\"&gt;Flint County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Whetstone\"&gt;Whetstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tierra%20Robada\"&gt;Tierra Robada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bone%20County\"&gt;Bone County&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are hints that more areas of San Andreas exist, but are simply not included for gameplay purposes. For example, some maps found in the game connect San Andreas to a mainland. There is also mention of an unnamed state capital.\nCities.\nLos Santos.\nLos Santos is the largest city, both by population and area in San Andreas. It is based on , . It is filled with references to famous L.A. landmarks, including the , the , the , the and the , among many others. It borders &lt;a href=\"Red%20County\"&gt;Red County&lt;/a&gt; to the north and &lt;a href=\"Flint%20County\"&gt;Flint County&lt;/a&gt; to the west. Los Santos also includes several districts that resemble cities in , such as &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Maria\"&gt;Santa Maria&lt;/a&gt; (), &lt;a href=\"Rodeo\"&gt;Rodeo&lt;/a&gt; (), &lt;a href=\"East%20Beach\"&gt;East Beach&lt;/a&gt; (), &lt;a href=\"Ganton\"&gt;Ganton&lt;/a&gt; (), &lt;a href=\"Idlewood\"&gt;Idlewood&lt;/a&gt; () and &lt;a href=\"Vinewood\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; ().\nSan Fierro.\nSan Fierro is the smallest city in area and the second largest in population in San Andreas, situated on a peninsula in the western portion of the state. It is based on the city of , California, with the additional references of two bridges in , the and the , the latter being made to also resemble the in both design and physical location. South of San Fierro lies the massive &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt; and the little town of &lt;a href=\"Angel%20Pine\"&gt;Angel Pine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whetstone\"&gt;Whetstone&lt;/a&gt;. North of the city, across the &lt;a href=\"Gant%20Bridge\"&gt;Gant Bridge&lt;/a&gt; (San Fierro's version of the ), lays the small town of &lt;a href=\"Bayside\"&gt;Bayside&lt;/a&gt;. Northeast of the city lies the county of &lt;a href=\"Tierra%20Robada\"&gt;Tierra Robada&lt;/a&gt;. To the east is the &lt;a href=\"Panopticon\"&gt;Panopticon&lt;/a&gt;, and to the southeast is &lt;a href=\"Flint%20County\"&gt;Flint County&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city bears visible scars of an earthquake, a likely reference to the , three years before the game takes place. However, news on the radio reports on the aftermath of an earthquake early in the game, suggesting that a major earthquake had hit the state recently.\nLas Venturas.\nLas Venturas is a city based on , . It is the second largest city in area and smallest in population in San Andreas, and like its counterpart, Las Venturas is located in a desert region and hosts legalized gambling, sporting casinos such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Camel%27s%20Toe\"&gt;The Camel's Toe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Caligula%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Caligula's Palace&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city is also notable for its freeway system. The &lt;a href=\"Julius%20Thruway\"&gt;Julius Thruway&lt;/a&gt; is a freeway that circles the whole city. Freeways from both Los Santos and San Fierro intersect with it. Another major road is the &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Gold%20Parkway\"&gt;Harry Gold Parkway&lt;/a&gt;, which runs through the middle of the city and intersects twice with the Julius Thruway and then leads to Los Santos (though it is not called the Harry Gold Parkway once it leaves the city). At one point in the game, the game's protagonist, Carl Johnson, pulls off an -esque heist in Caligula's Casino, subsequently fomenting relationships between &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore Leone&lt;/a&gt;.\nLas Venturas is translated from Spanish to English as \"The Fortunes.\"\nCounties and Smaller Towns.\nIn addition to the three principal metropolises, San Andreas state is home to several smaller towns and suburbs that are scattered over several counties.\nRed County.\nRed County is a rural county located among forests consisting of primarily tall redwood trees and streams. The county is based on the quintessential American countryside and is populated with stereotypical rednecks. It is based on the , which is located in the center of California (the center of the map is in Blueberry Acres), the , which is just north of Los Angeles, and , which is south of it.\nThe Panopticon.\nThe Panopticon is a little area situated in the western part of &lt;a href=\"Red%20County\"&gt;Red County&lt;/a&gt;. It is an abandoned lumbermill settlement on a hill with views of San Fierro. The interiors of the cabins here have bloodstains, indicating a rather lax or careless workflow.\nPalomino Creek.\nPalomino Creek is a town located in north east Red County in the state of San Andreas. It is home to a bank, which has suffered from many robberies, a Pizza Stack, and &lt;a href=\"Hanky%20Panky%20Point\"&gt;Hanky Panky Point&lt;/a&gt;, a popular destination for teenage couples and weird old men. &lt;a href=\"K-Rose\"&gt;K-Rose&lt;/a&gt; radio station mentions a football game between Palomino Creek High School and Blueberry High School in &lt;a href=\"Blueberry\"&gt;Blueberry&lt;/a&gt; (although there is neither a football field nor high school in either town), which might be a reference to the 1986 film , where Taft high school goes against Bakersfield high school in a football game, Bakersfield being a possible inspiration for Palomino Creek.\nPalomino Creek is the largest settlement in the state outside of the major cities.\nMontgomery.\nMontgomery is located in northeastern Red County. It has a small hospital called &lt;a href=\"Crippen%20Memorial%20Hospital\"&gt;Crippen Memorial Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Well%20Stacked%20Pizza\"&gt;Well Stacked Pizza&lt;/a&gt;, and also contains a small &lt;a href=\"Inside%20Track\"&gt;horse betting shop&lt;/a&gt;.\nDillimore.\nDillimore is located on the northern outskirts of Los Santos. Although it is a small town, it contains a &lt;a href=\"Dillimore%20Police%20Station\"&gt;sheriff's office&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;Pay 'n' Spray&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Gasso\"&gt;gas station&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"The%20Welcome%20Pump\"&gt;diner&lt;/a&gt;. It also has &lt;a href=\"Dillimore%20Safehouse\"&gt;a safehouse&lt;/a&gt; and houses the large farm estate which contains the &lt;a href=\"Quad\"&gt;Quad&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlueberry.\nBlueberry is the biggest rural town in Red County. On the outskirts of town, there is a &lt;a href=\"Blueberry%20Acres\"&gt;large farm&lt;/a&gt; and brewery. The town itself is home to a liquor store, &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blueberry%20Safehouse\"&gt;safehouse&lt;/a&gt;. The climate resembles that of San Fierro. It is possible that the buildings on the outskirts of town are a high school, and the fields could possibly be a football field of some sort, which would answer an announcement on &lt;a href=\"K-Rose\"&gt;K-Rose&lt;/a&gt; about a football game between Blueberry &amp; Palomino Creek.\nFlint County.\nFlint County is an undeveloped rural part of San Andreas. There are no towns, with the only settlements being a few gas stations, trailer parks, and only a couple of farms. There are only a few missions in Flint County throughout the game which mostly involve racing through it.\nWhetstone.\nWhetstone is located in the southwest corner of San Andreas, just south of San Fierro. The county is home to Mount Chiliad, the tallest mountain in the state at a half-mile (800 m) in height.\nAngel Pine.\nAngel Pine is a logging town in Whetstone, located on the foot of Mount Chiliad. It notably contains a hospital (&lt;a href=\"Angel%20Pine%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;Angel Pine Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;) from which &lt;a href=\"Paramedic\"&gt;Paramedic&lt;/a&gt; missions can be performed. It also contains a &lt;a href=\"Angel%20Pine%20Sheriff%27s%20Station\"&gt;sheriff's office&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Angel%20Pine%20Sawmill\"&gt;sawmill&lt;/a&gt;, an Ammu-Nation and a &lt;a href=\"Angel%20Pine%20Mobile%20Home%20Park\"&gt;trailer park&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Romero%27s%20Hearse\"&gt;hearse&lt;/a&gt; may also be found parked near the hospital. &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; was dropped off here by &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Pulaski\"&gt;Eddie Pulaski&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Hernandez\"&gt;Jimmy Hernandez&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Johnson\"&gt;Sweet Johnson&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt;.\nTierra Robada.\nTierra Robada (based on the area) is a small, rural county north of San Fierro.\nBayside.\nBayside is a waterfront town located on the western tip of Tierra Robada, just north across the bay from San Fierro. The sole access point to the town is directly linked to San Fierro via the &lt;a href=\"Gant%20Bridge\"&gt;Gant Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. The town contains two notable features: First, its &lt;a href=\"Boat%20School\"&gt;boat school&lt;/a&gt;, where Carl can obtain his boating licence; second, the town has a helipad, usually with a helicopter present, useful for traveling. It is a common rest stop for people traveling from San Fierro to Las Venturas.\nThe presence of the &lt;a href=\"Bayside%20Marina\"&gt;Bayside Marina&lt;/a&gt; and its proximity to the Gant Bridge suggests that the town is based on\u00a0, California, and\u00a0, California, before their upscale development, which is almost geographically similar to Bayside, in addition to having one of its access points connected directly to the Golden Gate Bridge.\nEl Quebrados.\nEl Quebrados is home to a &lt;a href=\"El%20Quebrados%20Sheriff%27s%20Station\"&gt;sheriff's department&lt;/a&gt;, a medical centre (&lt;a href=\"El%20Quebrados%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;El Quebrados Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;), and a &lt;a href=\"El%20Quebrados%20Safehouse\"&gt;safehouse&lt;/a&gt;. The town is located east of Bayside. The name \"El Quebrados\", which is an improper mix of singular and plural Spanish, translates roughly to \"The Bankrupt,\" or \"The Broken\".\nLas Barrancas.\nLas Barrancas is located within viewing range of the &lt;a href=\"Sherman%20Dam\"&gt;Sherman Dam&lt;/a&gt;, and is also located just beside a cliffside ruin. \"Las Barrancas\" is Spanish for \"Canyons\". This town is likely based on , .\nAldea Malvada.\nAldea Malvada is a ghost town located in Tierra Robada overlooking El Quebrados on the outskirts of town. It literally translates into English as \"Evil Village\".\nBone County.\nBone County, most likely based on , , and counties in Nevada, is one of the most important areas of the game, other than the major cities themselves, containing many areas and missions needed for continuation; a large amount of &lt;a href=\"Secrets%20and%20Easter%20Eggs%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;Easter Eggs&lt;/a&gt; are also located within it. The county's two most prominent features include a secret military base named \"&lt;a href=\"Area%2069%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Area 69&lt;/a&gt;\" (based on ) located at its centre, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Meadows%20Airfield\"&gt;Verdant Meadows Airfield&lt;/a&gt;, directly north of Area 69. Bone County boasts an oil field (&lt;a href=\"Octane%20Springs\"&gt;Octane Springs&lt;/a&gt;), a &lt;a href=\"Hunter%20Quarry\"&gt;quarry&lt;/a&gt;, and several unique natural features such as mesas.\nThe Sherman Reservoir and Dam.\nThe county is bordered in the west by the Sherman Reservoir and Sherman Dam (based on the Hoover Dam) as well as Tierra Robada county. Las Venturas is located to its east, and Red County to its south. The county as a whole is obviously based on rural portions for the American state of Nevada, because it has a similar climate, terrain and topography. A &lt;a href=\"Dinghy%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Dinghy&lt;/a&gt; raft and a &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Sparrow\"&gt;Sea Sparrow&lt;/a&gt; can be found docked on both sides of the reservoir. Also, a &lt;a href=\"Skimmer\"&gt;Skimmer&lt;/a&gt; can be found just north of the dam, right at the part where the river (based on the ) splits.\nRestricted Area (Area 69).\nArea 69 is a restricted military base, modeled after Area 51 and named for the 69 sex position. The base houses various clandestine government projects, including the \"&lt;a href=\"Black%20Project\"&gt;Black Project&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"jetpack\"&gt;jetpack&lt;/a&gt;. It may possibly house some projects involving UFOs and/or extraterrestrial life, as suggested by the presence of the nearby \"&lt;a href=\"Lil%27%20Probe%20Inn\"&gt;Lil' Probe Inn&lt;/a&gt;\", dialogue on the base's PA system during the \"Black Project\" mission, and by dialogue on &lt;a href=\"Marvin%20Trill\"&gt;Marvin Trill&lt;/a&gt;'s in-game radio show.\nMuch of the base consists of underground research labs, although the player can only enter the labs during the course of one mission, or by finding a way into San Andreas' \"&lt;a href=\"Blue%20Hell\"&gt;Blue Hell&lt;/a&gt;\", an area under the main terrain mesh, and finding the underground base there. The aboveground structures include a series of control towers, guard posts, and garages for military vehicles. These garages are the first area in the game in which tanks and military helicopters will automatically spawn. The player automatically receives a five-star wanted level for entering, attempting to enter, or flying over the base (at a low altitude); surface-to-air missiles will be fired at the player from the base if he attempts to fly over. The SAM sites which launch the missiles can be destroyed however, and if flying a &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt; aircraft, decoy flares can be deployed to reduce the likelihood of being shot down.\nFort Carson.\nFort Carson is the largest town in Bone County, and also its county seat, as indicated by the small red building in the main street, having been significantly undeveloped as of &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;. It is based on the real-life towns of and , both being in Nevada: Rachel due to it being the closest inhabited settlement to Area 51 and housing the ; Carson City for the appearance of the town itself; the main street, the town hall and the surroundings. North of the town is Area 69, as well as the smaller town of &lt;a href=\"Las%20Payasadas\"&gt;Las Payasadas&lt;/a&gt;. It also has a small hospital (&lt;a href=\"Fort%20Carson%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;Fort Carson Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;), a &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Carson%20Sheriff%27s%20Station\"&gt;sheriff's office&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Carson%20Safehouse\"&gt;a safehouse&lt;/a&gt;. There is also an Ammu-Nation just outside of town. Fort Carson is also seen in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Introduction\"&gt;The Introduction&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Ken Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt; was in rehab in the town's hospital. The town is located west of &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;. A small &lt;a href=\"Cropduster\"&gt;Cropduster&lt;/a&gt; is known to appear next to one of the houses near here and it is flyable.\nLil' Probe Inn.\nThe Lil' Probe Inn, a bar/motel, is located north from Fort Carson. The Lil' Probe Inn is actually a parody of the Little A'le Inn in Rachel; the interior of the Probe Inn matches the interior of the real-life Little A'Le'Inn. Down the road from the Lil' Probe Inn is Area 69. Its name is a mix of Little A'Le'Inn, while also referring to \"probing\", the alleged anal probes used in alien research.\nThe Big Ear.\nThe Big Ear, a large satellite dish located west of Area 69, is claimed by the official \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" website to emit radiation that results in birth defects in the local populace, specifically where newborns are born without ears.\nLas Payasadas.\nLas Payasadas (Spanish for \"clowning off\" or \"antics\") bills itself as the home of \"The Big Pecker \u2014 the world's largest cock\", which in fact is a huge animatronic rooster designed to advertise a store called \"&lt;a href=\"Pecker%27s%20Feed%20and%20Seed\"&gt;Pecker's Feed and Seed&lt;/a&gt;\". It is located in northern Bone County. Possibly based on , Nevada.\nEast Bone County Town.\nThe unnamed East Bone County Town is located directly west of Las Venturas, and is home to &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Spread%20Ranch\"&gt;The Big Spread Ranch&lt;/a&gt; strip club. It is possibly inspired by various towns and settlements west of Las Vegas, such as Calico Basin, Bonnie Springs, and .\nLas Brujas.\nLas Brujas is another ghost town located in the &lt;a href=\"El%20Castillo%20del%20Diablo\"&gt;El Castillo del Diablo&lt;/a&gt; (Translation: The Castle of the Devil) region of Bone County. It is located right off the &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Meadows%20Airfield\"&gt;Verdant Meadows&lt;/a&gt; airstrip. Its name is Spanish for \"The Witches\". It is based on , California.\nFault Line.\nThere is &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20Fault\"&gt;a fault line&lt;/a&gt; that goes along the seabed in the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Bay\"&gt;San Fierro Bay&lt;/a&gt;. This is a reference to the which runs the whole length of California, which could be an inspiration towards the in-game state's name."}

{"id": "47625", "revid": "33378340", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=47625", "title": "State of San Andreas (HD Universe)", "text": "The State of San Andreas, also known as the San Andreas Republic, is a state located in the southwestern &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt;, featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\". San Andreas is closely based on real-life . When compared to its 3D Universe &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;predecessor&lt;/a&gt;, San Andreas is much more accurate in terms of geography and size.\nOverview.\nSan Andreas is a large, populous state. Its diverse climate makes it unique, ranging from grassy plains to arid deserts to forests and mountain ranges. The forests of San Andreas are dominated by the mighty Redwood trees, standing tall over the ground. San Andreas is located on the West Coast of the United States and is the birthplace of several new pop culture trends, including celebrity fallouts. The state sits on the coast of the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. San Andreas is nicknamed \"The Golden State\", much like California.\nThe area of southern San Andreas accessible in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" consists of two counties: urban &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County\"&gt;Los Santos County&lt;/a&gt; and mostly rural &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;. Other locations such as &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; do not appear, but are mentioned numerous times. &lt;a href=\"Red%20County%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Red County&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flint%20County%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Flint County&lt;/a&gt; were also previously mentioned in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\". \nSan Andreas is unique in that it is the first setting in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series not to have any part of the map restricted at the start of the game, with the exception of certain specific locations, such as the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;city airport&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Labs%20and%20Research\"&gt;Humane Labs and Research&lt;/a&gt; chemical laboratories, the &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;military base&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Bolingbroke%20Penitentiary\"&gt;state prison&lt;/a&gt;. This means that even at the very beginning of the story, players can explore and discover the world to their hearts' content. However, some locations, such as &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;, do not play a role in the storyline until a certain &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Philips\"&gt;point&lt;/a&gt; in the game.\nSan Andreas' motto is, \"We won't be broken hypocrites forever,\" as stated in a San Andreas Tourism Board commercial; according to the same advertisement, San Andreas has the most polluted air in the world.\nBy the summer of &lt;a href=\"2022\"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;, San Andreas is considered \"the most violent state in the country\".\nHistory.\nLittle is known about the history of San Andreas. Throughout the story, snippets of the state's history are mentioned in dialogue. San Andreas used to be a territory of &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; in the 1800s, which explains the large Mexican population and some Spanish geographic names. The city of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, however, was founded in &lt;a href=\"1781\"&gt;1781&lt;/a&gt;, which was when the was still in control. Old Mexican bloodlines like &lt;a href=\"Manuel\"&gt;Manuel&lt;/a&gt;'s resided there for over 200 years, and consider themselves more American than Americans themselves. &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt; was established in &lt;a href=\"1823\"&gt;1823&lt;/a&gt;.\nJudging from the state flag, it is possible that the American settlers came to San Andreas and defeated Mexico, thus establishing the San Andreas Republic. &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County\"&gt;Los Santos County&lt;/a&gt; was established in &lt;a href=\"1889\"&gt;1889&lt;/a&gt;, several decades after the founding of Blaine County. In the 20th century, San Andreas became the center of culture in America and gave birth to the famous &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; film culture, resulting in classics like \"&lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Zombie\"&gt;Vinewood Zombie&lt;/a&gt;\". In \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", it is stated that Los Santos experienced &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Riots\"&gt;riots&lt;/a&gt; in the 1990s, just like the . In 2021, San Andreas legalized recreational cannabis, though there had long been stores before that in 2013 that sold medical marijuana purportedly to only those with prescriptions.\nThe beaver is the official state animal of San Andreas. The beaver can be seen on the state flag, the logo of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County%20Sheriff\"&gt;Los Santos County Sheriff&lt;/a&gt;, and on the seal of the city of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nThe entire state, like its real-life counterpart, is geographically diverse, with nearly every biome. Unlike its counterpart, the entire state of San Andreas gets covered in snow for a week or two each year. The metropolis of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; is located at the very south of the state, separated from the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Senora%20Desert\"&gt;Grand Senora Desert&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Hills\"&gt;Vinewood Hills&lt;/a&gt;, where the famous &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Sign\"&gt;Vinewood Sign&lt;/a&gt; is located. The &lt;a href=\"Alamo%20Sea\"&gt;Alamo Sea&lt;/a&gt;, a salty lake based on real-life Salton Sea, along with the aforementioned desert and the towns of &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grapeseed\"&gt;Grapeseed&lt;/a&gt; is in a wide basin surrounded by the massive &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt;, the highest point of the state, in the north, &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Josiah\"&gt;Mount Josiah&lt;/a&gt; to the west, the &lt;a href=\"San%20Chianski%20Mountain%20Range\"&gt;San Chianski Mountain Range&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Gordo\"&gt;Mount Gordo&lt;/a&gt; to the east, and the Vinewood Hills to the south. Across Mount Chiliad, the town of &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt; and its surrounding forest is connected to the rest of the state by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Ocean%20Highway\"&gt;Great Ocean Highway&lt;/a&gt;, Mount Chiliad Tunnel and &lt;a href=\"Braddock%20Pass\"&gt;Braddock Pass&lt;/a&gt; between Mount Chiliad and Mount Gordo. The &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt; U.S. Army Base is located at the foot of Mount Josiah, beside the &lt;a href=\"Zancudo%20River\"&gt;Zancudo River&lt;/a&gt;, one of two natural outlets of the Alamo Sea, the other being &lt;a href=\"Cassidy%20Creek\"&gt;Cassidy Creek&lt;/a&gt;, which cuts through &lt;a href=\"Raton%20Canyon\"&gt;Raton Canyon&lt;/a&gt;. Natural beaches border the west of the island, stretching from the Los Santos district of &lt;a href=\"Vespucci\"&gt;Vespucci&lt;/a&gt; to Paleto Bay, while the east coast has high cliffs and mountains.\nThe state's flying industry is served by &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt; (LSIA), &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt; (for military use), the &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Sandy Shores Airfield&lt;/a&gt; (owned by one of the protagonists Trevor Philips), and &lt;a href=\"McKenzie%20Field\"&gt;McKenzie Field&lt;/a&gt; in Grapeseed (used for air trafficking operations). The &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Port of Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; is a major seaport where cargo ships can be found.\nDemographics.\nThe city of Los Santos is very diverse in population, from the large African-American community in &lt;a href=\"South%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;South Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, the Hispanic population in &lt;a href=\"East%20Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;East Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and the celebrity millionaires in &lt;a href=\"Rockford%20Hills\"&gt;Rockford Hills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Richman%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Richman&lt;/a&gt;. Rednecks inhabit &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Grapeseed\"&gt;Grapeseed&lt;/a&gt; is the state's center of agriculture. It is also said that hipsters can be found in &lt;a href=\"Chumash\"&gt;Chumash&lt;/a&gt; and the LS district of &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Park\"&gt;Mirror Park&lt;/a&gt;. The Chiliad Mountain State Wilderness is a common hunting ground and the home of the &lt;a href=\"Altruist%20Camp\"&gt;Altruist Camp&lt;/a&gt;.\nCounties.\nSan Andreas has four known counties: Los Santos County, Blaine County, Red County and Flint County. However, the latter two do not appear in the game.\nLos Santos County.\nLos Santos County is the southernmost county in the state, and is also the most developed. It consists of the cities of Los Santos and Davis, along with a large variety of highlands, beaches, and interconnected &lt;a href=\"Numbered%20Highway%20in%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;highways&lt;/a&gt;. The town of &lt;a href=\"Chumash\"&gt;Chumash&lt;/a&gt; is located in the western side of the county along with a large beach. It is bordered by Blaine County to the north by &lt;a href=\"Route%2068\"&gt;Route 68&lt;/a&gt;. Los Santos County is the urban area of Southern San Andreas.\nBlaine County.\nBlaine County is the second-southernmost county of the state and the northernmost featured. Blaine County is mostly known for its wildlife, including a large desert, highlands, a sea, and forests. There are three towns in the county: &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grapeseed\"&gt;Grapeseed&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt;. One of the most visited landmarks in the county is &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt;. Blaine County is the rural area of Southern San Andreas.\nOther Mentioned Counties.\nThroughout the series, some names of counties are mentioned and referenced, but other than that, they never physically appear in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; of the series.\nRed County.\nRed County is mentioned in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nFlint County.\nFlint County is mentioned on homecremation.com in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", and during the mission &lt;a href=\"Short%20Trip%20-%20Fire%20It%20Up\"&gt;Short Trip - Fire It Up&lt;/a&gt; in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nMajor Cities.\nLos Santos.\nThe city of Los Santos is based on , . The city is the main setting of the events of \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and initial home of two of the protagonists.\nOther Mentioned Cities.\nSan Fierro.\nThe city of San Fierro is based on , . The city was mentioned by Lester Crest during &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Heist\"&gt;The Doomsday Heist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zachary\"&gt;Zachary&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Kult%20FM\"&gt;Kult FM&lt;/a&gt;.\nTowns.\nThe state features four known towns:\nSandy Shores.\nSandy Shores is the most notable due to this being the home of one of the protagonists, &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;. The town is located in the center of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Senora%20Desert\"&gt;Grand Senora Desert&lt;/a&gt;, bordering the &lt;a href=\"Alamo%20Sea\"&gt;Alamo Sea&lt;/a&gt; to the north.\nChumash.\nChumash is a town mostly based on . It is supposedly populated by hipsters, as stated by &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Norton\"&gt;Dave Norton&lt;/a&gt;. There are many beachfront homes and some docks. It is bordered by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Ocean%20Highway\"&gt;Great Ocean Highway&lt;/a&gt;.\nPaleto Bay.\nPaleto Bay is the northernmost town in southern San Andreas. Paleto Bay is known for being a visited landmark for people who like BASE jumping from &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt;. Paleto Bay is a good rest stop for truckers on the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Ocean%20Highway\"&gt;Great Ocean Highway&lt;/a&gt; due to it holding various services such as a bank and a &lt;a href=\"Filling%20Station\"&gt;gas station&lt;/a&gt;.\nGrapeseed.\nGrapeseed is a town located at the northeast end of the &lt;a href=\"Alamo%20Sea\"&gt;Alamo Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The town is primarily an agricultural one and contains several farms. It is the second smallest town in the state, just ahead of Sandy Shores.\nUnincorporated communities.\nThis is a list of communities that usually have no local government or services and are generally unrecognized as official territories.\nEcosystems.\nSan Andreas has a rich and diverse variety of ecosystems ranging from mountains to canyons. These include locations throughout San Andreas that are typically unsettled by humans and populated by different &lt;a href=\"Animals\"&gt;animals&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnimals.\nSan Andreas is home to many different species of &lt;a href=\"Animals\"&gt;animals&lt;/a&gt;. From &lt;a href=\"dogs\"&gt;dogs&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Seagull\"&gt;seagulls&lt;/a&gt;, San Andreas has it all. Animals are not present in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", however.\nHighway System.\nSan Andreas has a complex highway system that contains many elaborate routes, interstates, and freeways. The system reaches all throughout the state and is the most developed highway system in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;\"Grand Theft Auto\"&lt;/a&gt; series to date.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThere are numerous references to the State of San Andreas in \"GTA IV\" and its . These include characters mentioning locations, TV shows, and radio; however, they refer to the 3D Universe rendition of San Andreas instead of \"GTA V\"; in particular, the TV broadcast for &lt;a href=\"Venturas%20Poker%20Challenge\"&gt;Venturas Poker Challenge&lt;/a&gt; uses footages of Las Venturas from \"GTA: San Andreas\". This is due to the HD Universe rendition of the state of San Andreas not being developed at the moment. \nLocations from San Andreas in the HD Universe have been pre-established in \"GTA IV\" before their appearance in \"GTA V\", such as the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20San%20Andreas%2C%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;University of San Andreas, Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs seen by character dialogues and Internet sites, the city names &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; (including &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt;), Red County, Flint County, San Fierro, and Las Venturas are still used, confirming that these locations exist in the HD Universe, but are not located in the southern portion of the state seen in \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nReferences.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", the stats can say \"miles traveled from Liberty City to Los Santos.\" Also, when you hear other pedestrians on the sidewalk or the street talking on the phone, you may hear them mention San Andreas."}

Health can be regained by eating food, saving, or picking up a health \"power-up\" or first-aid kit. Entering an &lt;a href=\"Ambulance\"&gt;Ambulance&lt;/a&gt; will also restore a small amount of health. In San Andreas during the mission called \"Reuniting The Families\" the player can regenerate his health by kissing prostitutes. In San Andreas the value ranges from 0 to a maximum of 1000. Default value at the start of a new game is 569.\n&lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor counts as an extra \"layer\" of health; it can be acquired via an Armor &lt;a href=\"Pickups\"&gt;pickup&lt;/a&gt;, purchased at an &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt; store, or, in some games, acquired by entering the Police &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;. The exact abilities of Armor vary from game to game \u2014 generally, Armor will absorb all gunfire and explosive damage until it is entirely depleted; damage from falls and vehicle impacts may deplete Armor, or may leave Armor intact and deplete Health.\n&lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level\"&gt;Wanted Level&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Wanted Level indicates the level of police interest in the player, rated from a 6-head scale (&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;\"GTA\"&lt;/a&gt; and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;GTA 2&lt;/a&gt;\"), 6-star scale (\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;GTA III&lt;/a&gt;\" \u2014 \"\"), and a 5-star scale (\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;GTA V&lt;/a&gt;\"). If the player commits serious crimes (and the police are aware of them), it will indicate the extent of the crimes, and how much force &lt;a href=\"Police%20%28law%20enforcement%29\"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt; will employ in capturing (or killing) the player. If the police successfully catch the player, they will be &lt;a href=\"Busted\"&gt;Busted&lt;/a&gt;.\nAltitude Meter.\nThe Altitude Meter is a bar that rises or falls according to how high up the player is from sea level. This meter is only available when in an aircraft or when using a &lt;a href=\"parachute\"&gt;parachute&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"GTA San Andreas\" HUD Statistics.\n\"\" has a set of character statistics viewable either by holding the 'status' button or key, or via the &lt;a href=\"Pause%20Menu\"&gt;Pause Menu&lt;/a&gt;. On the mobile (&lt;a href=\"Apple%20iOS\"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Android%20OS\"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;) versions of the game, the statistics can be viewed by tapping and holding the weapon icon. These reflect &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;'s physique, physical abilities, and expertise; unlike in older \"GTA\" games, these change according to the player's actions. The status menu cannot be viewed when in a vehicle on the PS2 version as this will enable the vehicle's nitro upgrade if one has been installed; otherwise, it has no function.\nRespect.\n&lt;a href=\"Respect\"&gt;Respect&lt;/a&gt; indicates CJ's level of influence in the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt;. The more respect CJ has, the more gang members he can recruit, starting with 1 and up to a maximum of 7. Respect is gained upon completing some missions, killing members of enemy gangs or law enforcement, successfully taking over enemy gang territory and spraying over &lt;a href=\"Tags\"&gt;Tags&lt;/a&gt;. It is also influenced by CJ's appearance; &lt;a href=\"Barbers\"&gt;hairstyle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tattoos\"&gt;tattoos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt; and muscle all offer a small increase to respect. However, wearing green clothes in GSF territory gives a more significant boost. Respect is lost by not wearing green in GSF territory, killing friendly gang members and losing territory to enemy gangs.\nWeapon Skill.\nWeapon Skill is CJ's ability to use different types of weapons. CJ can become more skilled with various weapons by successfully shooting NPC's or vehicles. Most individual weapons have their own separate skill to build up, but the &lt;a href=\"Tec-9\"&gt;Tec-9&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt; are grouped together as \"Machine Pistols\". CJ's skill with each weapon begins as \"Poor\", then can increase to \"Gangster\" level, and finally \"Hitman\" level at maximum. Becoming more skilled improves CJ's accuracy, targeting range, strafe speed, rate of fire, and allows him to move while firing. Additionally, reaching Hitman level with the &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sawn-Off%20Shotgun\"&gt;Sawn-Off Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;, Tec-9 and Micro SMG allows CJ to wield two at once. Thrown weapons such as &lt;a href=\"Grenades\"&gt;Grenades&lt;/a&gt;, melee weapons, &lt;a href=\"Rifle\"&gt;Rifle&lt;/a&gt;s and heavy weapons like the &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt; do not have skill meters.\nVehicle Skill.\nVehicle Skill is CJ's ability to use different types of vehicles gradually increases based on distance covered. There are separate skills for automobiles, bicycles, motorbikes and aircraft. Becoming more skilled makes vehicles more responsive, allowing the player to turn more sharply and handle more easily. It also allows CJ to perform higher bunny hops and reduces his chance of being knocked off a bicycle or motorbike by collisions.\nLung Capacity.\n&lt;a href=\"Swimming\"&gt;Lung Capacity&lt;/a&gt; represents how long CJ can hold his breath when diving underwater. An oxygen meter is displayed whenever CJ dives underwater. Lung capacity is increased by swimming underwater for extended periods, especially by collecting &lt;a href=\"Oysters\"&gt;Oysters&lt;/a&gt;. If the player stays underwater long enough for the oxygen meter to deplete, CJ will start rapidly losing health until he either drowns or comes up for air. After coming up for air CJ will not regain lost health, only oxygen. If CJ has yet to reach 20% of his lung capacity, he will not be able to perform the mission &lt;a href=\"Amphibious%20Assault\"&gt;Amphibious Assault&lt;/a&gt;.\nStamina.\nStamina indicates endurance with regards to running, swimming, and cycling. Low stamina means CJ will grow fatigued easily and stop sprinting after short distances. Stamina has to be built up over the course of the entire game by exercising. In \"\", a stamina bar also exists whenever the player is in the water. If it runs out, the player will &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;drown&lt;/a&gt;. Behind the scenes this is measured with a value from 0 to a maximum of 1000. Default value at the start of a new game is 100 or 10%.\nMuscle.\nMuscle indicates CJ's muscular development. Muscle influences how much damage CJ deals in melee combat, as well as the respect and sex appeal stats. Muscle is increased by working out at a gym, or otherwise exercising (running, riding bikes, swimming). A 50% muscle statistic alters CJ's walking and running style (muscular.ifp animation set). A 100% muscle statistic is detrimental to Sex appeal and will prevent CJ from initiating contact with some &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;girlfriends&lt;/a&gt;. To prevent this, obtain all 50 Oysters, buy high-end outfits and haircuts, and drive a high-end vehicle, such as a tuner or sports car. Behind the scenes this is measured with a value from 0 to a maximum of 1000. Default value at the start of a new game is 50 or 5%.\nIf CJ has zero fat and does not eat enough food, he will start losing muscle.\nFat.\nFat indicates CJ's body fat. Fat is increased by eating (including meals during dates), and decreased by exercising, either at a &lt;a href=\"gym\"&gt;gym&lt;/a&gt; or in the world at large, or by not eating for an extended period. Being overweight will naturally change CJ's appearance, dialogue (mostly related to his weight) and eventually lessens most physical capabilities (including health, running speed, jumping, etc.). Having no fat at all is inadvisable, because CJ will instead start to lose muscle if he grows hungry. Before this happens, the player is given the following warning: \u201cYou are starting to feel hungry and you are starting to lose energy. You need to find something to eat.\u201d If he has no muscle or fat to shed, he will then start to lose health until it eventually kills CJ. Behind the scenes this is measured with a value from 0 to a maximum of 1000. Default value at the start of a new game is 200 or 20%.\nEating too much in one sitting will cause CJ to vomit. It's dangerous to eat somewhere between 9 to 12 of the largest or salad meal at any restaurant. The magic number depends on health, fat, muscle, time, etc. If this happens, the player will not gain any fat, nor be served in any restaurant until 11 game hours have passed. Oddly enough, eating until purge does count as eating; while it won't regain health, it will stave off hunger and weight loss like normal.\nSex Appeal.\nSex Appeal indicates how women will react to CJ. It is influenced by CJ's &lt;a href=\"Vehicles%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;current vehicle&lt;/a&gt; (and its condition), hairstyle, clothing, tattoos, fat and muscle. Collecting all 50 &lt;a href=\"Oysters\"&gt;Oysters&lt;/a&gt; can prevent some of the pitfalls of low sex appeal (girlfriends being dissatisfied with CJ's appearance, or potential girlfriends not wanting to talk to CJ), however, female &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt; are not affected by collecting all oysters and react to his current sex appeal like normal. Also, sleeping with &lt;a href=\"prostitutes\"&gt;prostitutes&lt;/a&gt; can raise some of the sex appeal. In general, more expensive items offer a more significant increase in sex appeal, especially clothing. Lowriders and sports cars give the greatest boosts to this statistic; any vehicle still provides its increase after Carl exits, as long as he stays within a distance of 120ft from it.\n\"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\" HUD Statistics.\nPlayer stats appear once again in \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\", when selecting the &lt;a href=\"Character%20Wheel\"&gt;Character Wheel&lt;/a&gt;. The stats include Stamina, Shooting, Strength, Stealth, Flying, Driving, Lung Capacity, and Special. These stats start out different for each protagonist, but can eventually be maxed out.\nSpecial.\nUsing a character's &lt;a href=\"Special%20Ability\"&gt;Special Ability&lt;/a&gt; will gradually improve the stat. As the stat bar increases, the speed at which that character's Special Ability bar fills up will also increase, and when it's active, the bar will deplete more slowly, allowing more time to use it. Only available to Franklin, Michael and Trevor.\nMax Health.\nExclusive to the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;Online Protagonist&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt;, Max Health will Increase by 1 point every level up to level 100. Every 20 levels, the Max Health stat bar will show up with the corresponding number (20 for level 20, 40 for level 40 etc.). When the player has Max Health - they can survive a &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper\"&gt;Heavy Sniper&lt;/a&gt; shot to the Stomach or Lower Torso with minimal health.\nRank.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Version\"&gt;Enhanced Version&lt;/a&gt;, displays the character's current &lt;a href=\"Rank\"&gt;Rank&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;Reputation&lt;/a&gt; points progress towards their next level up.\nStamina.\nExtra stamina will allow the characters to sprint, cycle and swim for longer before getting tired. When the character's stamina gets depleted, the normally green health bar will start flashing red, causing gradual damage to the player if they continue the actions and drop down exhausted when the bar gets too low. The stat will increase if the player performs each of those activities. Maxing out Stamina will allow the character to perform these strenuous actions indefinitely with no fear of health loss.\nShooting.\nA higher Shooting stat will make the character more accurate by reducing recoil while shooting any gun. The character will also be able to reload faster and carry more ammunition to a max of 9999 bullets per gun category. The more targets the player hits, particularly headshots, the more their Shooting stat will increase. Spend time in the &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation%20Shooting%20Ranges\"&gt;Shooting Range&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt; and take on shooting challenges as a fast way to improve this skill.\nStrength.\nAdditional strength will inflict heavier damage during &lt;a href=\"Fist\"&gt;hand-to-hand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Melee%20Weapons\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; combat, increase speed at climbing ladders, increase damage reduction from &lt;a href=\"Falling\"&gt;falls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Windshield%20Ejection\"&gt;car crashes&lt;/a&gt;, explosions, gunfire, physical attacks, and &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, and improve the character's &lt;a href=\"Tennis\"&gt;Tennis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Golf\"&gt;Golf&lt;/a&gt; performance by allowing them to hit the ball harder. Engaging in unarmed combat, and taking part in sports like Tennis, Golf and &lt;a href=\"Yoga\"&gt;Yoga&lt;/a&gt; will raise the character's Strength.\nStealth.\nThe higher the Stealth stat is, the quieter the character will be in both stealth and normal movement modes, and they'll also be able to move more quickly in stealth mode. The Stealth stat will increase the more time you spend moving in stealth and especially performing silent takedowns. By default, pressing the left analogue stick or left ctrl will enter you into stealth mode. Press it again to move normally.\nFlying.\nWhen a character has a low Flying stats, the performance of any &lt;a href=\"Planes\"&gt;aircraft&lt;/a&gt; they're flying will be more susceptible to the effects of turbulence. As the stats increase, the character will be able to both fly and land more smoothly, and also will improve the ability to fly any &lt;a href=\"Helicopter\"&gt;aircraft&lt;/a&gt;. Just spending time flying steadily will increase the stat, whereas the &lt;a href=\"Flight%20School\"&gt;Flight School&lt;/a&gt; will make the process a lot faster by completing its challenges.\nDriving.\nImproving the &lt;a href=\"Driving\"&gt;Driving&lt;/a&gt; skills will improve the character's &lt;a href=\"vehicle\"&gt;vehicle&lt;/a&gt; handling when airborne and make performing &lt;a href=\"Wheelie\"&gt;wheelies&lt;/a&gt; easier. The more time the character spends driving vehicles, the faster the stat will increase, particularly performing wheelies and landing &lt;a href=\"Stunt%20Jumps\"&gt;big jumps on four or two wheels&lt;/a&gt;.\nLung Capacity.\nHaving a high &lt;a href=\"Lung%20Capacity\"&gt;Lung Capacity&lt;/a&gt; means the character can stay submerged under water for longer and the Oxygen Meter will decrease more slowly. Lung capacity will increase as the character spends more time under water, whether with or without the &lt;a href=\"Scuba%20Suit\"&gt;Scuba Suit&lt;/a&gt;. Every thirty seconds the player spends underwater will increase this stat one percent.\nMental State.\n\"GTA Online\" protagonists only\nThis indicates the effects of the player's actions. Depending on the current state, the player's blip on the map will become increasingly red. Mental State will be raised whenever the player kills a player or pedestrian, and other players will receive rewards for killing others with a high Mental State."}

Whilst the statue's design is very much similar to the Statue of Liberty's, there are several visible differences on the Statue of Happiness: \nThe \"GTA Chinatown Wars\" rendition of the statue is scaled down in order to be more visible in the game's &lt;a href=\"Top-Down%20Perspective\"&gt;top-down perspective&lt;/a&gt;. While the structure retains the star fort base, the pedestal was removed and the statue is smaller. However, the full rendition of the statue appears while talking with a &lt;a href=\"Osama\"&gt;drug dealer&lt;/a&gt; on the Island.\nHistory.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Peep%20That%20Shit%23Soak%20In%20The%20Sights\"&gt;Peep that Shit&lt;/a&gt;, the statue was presented to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt; in 1886 from the French to mark 100 years free of British food and spelling. In one &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; report, however, the French president had requested the United States return the statue, in response to the American president's decision to rename French maid outfits as \"slutty Halloween costumes\" (a reference to the real-life controversy surrounding the use of \"\" instead of \"French fries\" in menus of eateries in the United States' House of Representatives).\nIn \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", &lt;a href=\"Youvebeencelebinated.com\"&gt;the \"Celebinator\"&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0writes in his blog about the statue after his \"&lt;a href=\"...Blog%20This%21\"&gt;helicopter tour&lt;/a&gt;\" of the city (the last sentence in the post regarding the statue could be a reference to its beating heart). Also, through the article, The Celebinator mentions that her face reminds her of someone and that \"if I was married to that cold slab of stone, I'd be off with any fat bird who'd take me.\" These might be further reference to Hillary Clinton and how her husband, former US President Bill Clinton, was caught in an affair with Monica Lewinsky.\nTablet inscription.\nThe tablet held by the Statue bears an inscription referring to the United States' treatment towards immigrants who entered the country seeking a better life, and closes with . It reads:\nAccessibility.\n&lt;a href=\"Happiness%20Island\"&gt;Happiness Island&lt;/a&gt;, where the statue is located, is only accessible via helicopter, boat or by swimming. &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; is the closest island, and the nearest &lt;a href=\"Subway%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;subway stop&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Gardens%20Station\"&gt;Castle Gardens&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Algonquin%20Outer%20Line\"&gt;Algonquin Outer Line&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Higgins%20Helitours\"&gt;Higgins Helitours&lt;/a&gt; is on the southeast side of Algonquin for a helicopter, and there are numerous boats at moorings on the west side of Algonquin. The island itself has a number of boats that spawn there, and also &lt;a href=\"Forklift%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Forklift&lt;/a&gt;s. A random vehicle (usually a &lt;a href=\"Futo\"&gt;Futo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Compact\"&gt;Blista Compact&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ingot\"&gt;Ingot&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Uranus\"&gt;Uranus&lt;/a&gt;) also spawns behind one of the sheds, and a &lt;a href=\"Faggio\"&gt;Faggio&lt;/a&gt; spawns in a small area near the main plaza.\nStatue's heart.\nInside the statue is a beating heart, one of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\"s &lt;a href=\"Secrets%20and%20Easter%20Eggs%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;Easter eggs&lt;/a&gt; and is among one of the first Easter eggs that were found in the game. The entrance is on the upper platform of the pedestal, right at the feet of the statue, which is only accessible by a helicopter.\nThe southern door leading to the heart has a sign: \"No Hidden Content This Way\". This is similar to the sign on top of the &lt;a href=\"Gant%20Bridge\"&gt;Gant Bridge&lt;/a&gt; in and &lt;a href=\"The%20Hidden%20Sign\"&gt;The Hidden Sign&lt;/a&gt; in . Through the door there is a ladder going upwards into the body of the statue itself. At the top of the ladder there is a small platform with a large, beating heart chained to the inside of the statue. The heart is indestructible.\nIn \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", it is possible for &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Drinking\"&gt;pass out from drinking too many shots&lt;/a&gt; and wake up in this room with a &lt;a href=\"parachute\"&gt;parachute&lt;/a&gt;."}

As with other safehouses in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", it is possible to shoot at people and vehicles from the interior windows using the &lt;a href=\"sniper%20rifle\"&gt;sniper rifle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe building still stands, unchanged, in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", although it is unknown if Toni Cipriani still owns it.

The design of the grille and bumper appears to be influenced by the . The rear bumper and tail lights could possibly be borrowed from the .\nDesign.\nThe front of the vehicle features a black bumper with a dedicated central section for the license plate (with the plate itself being notably smaller than the rest of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City's&lt;/a&gt; license plates). The upper area consists of a black rectangular grille with four horizontal and five vertical elements, together with a set of inner headlights and outer turn signals. The hood has a slanted shape and bears the Vapid logo on the front end. The cabin has vertical door handles and square-shaped mirror wings with a black finish, along with silver \"V8\" badges at the bottom.\nThe rear section mainly consists of the cargo box, which features various marker lights on the front and rear ends, as well as mudguards for the rear wheels. The rear end has two large cargo doors with silver badging on the driver-side one, and an extended section with a warning strip in the center, and two reverse lights on each side. The brake, main and turning lights are mounted on a rear guard seen below the truck, while the license plate is placed between these tail lights. The chassis has two battery/storage boxes and a single exhaust pipe below, which ends between the boxes and the rear axle.\nThe Steed is seen in two possible color combinations, consisting of a primary one for most of the vehicle and a secondary one for the lower portions of the cargo hold and the rivets on the side walls; the first one is an all-white color, while the second one is a grayish white primary color with a dark grey/black secondary. The Steed is available either in blank or in one of six liveries: &lt;a href=\"24/7\"&gt;24/7 Supermarkets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Krapea\"&gt;Krapea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Logger%20Beer\"&gt;Logger Beer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Raine\"&gt;Raine&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Cder%20Milk%C3%A9n\"&gt;\u00dcder Milk\u00e9n&lt;/a&gt;. Optionally, graffiti marks can be seen on any of these versions. It uses industrial wheels with a similar design to the ones seen on vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\nThe Steed, like most large vehicles, has poor acceleration and handling, but it has a very good top speed for a vehicle of its size. The braking is also very good. Despite its height, the Steed does not tip over easily.\nThe vehicle is stated to be powered by an intercooled V8 engine, although its current engine model is that of a turbocharged Inline-4. Said engine is coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a rear-wheel drive layout. Its engine sound is similar to vans such as the &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Pony\"&gt;Pony&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Speedo\"&gt;Speedo&lt;/a&gt;."}

Despite its use by civilians, the Ranger only appears with a green body and a white roof. Like the Repair Van, it also features a front-lid mounted spare tire, similar to a Land Rover. The Ranger grants the player an average sum of money when exported.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", the Ranger is now depicted as a &lt;a href=\"Police%20%28law%20enforcement%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt;-issued &lt;a href=\"Rancher\"&gt;Rancher&lt;/a&gt; that is outfitted with sirens, light bars, radio antenna and a criminal-hold in the back. The Ranger is primarily native in rural &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, where rough terrain merits its presence. A peculiarity of the Ranger is that smoke will emerge from \"the center\" of the vehicle after sustaining heavy damage instead of its engine in the front. Its right headlight also does not light up completely, it only glows. It's unknown whether this is a &lt;a href=\"Glitches%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;glitch&lt;/a&gt; or intended by the game developers or probably to differ the &lt;a href=\"Rancher\"&gt;Rancher&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt also has a different paint job from other vehicles in the SAPD. The &lt;a href=\"Police%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;Police cars&lt;/a&gt; have the 'panda' paintjob, with black fronts and hoods, white doors and roofs and black rears and trunks. However, the Ranger's paintjob appears more patchy: black front with a \"white\" hood, white doors with half the roof painted black and the other half white, and black rear fenders and tailgate.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: London\".\n\"GTA London\"s Ranger is a somewhat lumbering vehicle, with average top speed but below-average acceleration, bulky weight, poor brakes and poor handling. However, the Ranger does have one of the fastest maximum reversing speed, on par with the &lt;a href=\"Beagle%203\"&gt;Beagle 3&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\n\"GTA San Andreas\" Ranger handles somewhat the same as the original Rancher, but it is much faster, having a top speed similar to that of some sport cars. It also has a slightly larger ground clearance, and its more durable body can sustain more damage than the &lt;a href=\"Rancher\"&gt;Rancher&lt;/a&gt;. It is a great off-road vehicle and can easily drive over rocks. Despite this, because of its weight and somewhat poor traction, it isn't the best vehicle for hill climbing. Doing so will often cause it to tip over, falling down the mountain. However, it can accelerate extremely well even on steep inclines."}

The rear plate holder is similar to the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Rapid GT is essentially a two-door version of the &lt;a href=\"Exemplar\"&gt;Exemplar&lt;/a&gt;, sharing the initial front and rear fascias and main body design. The front face of this car is comprised of a range of curves. The bumper is dominated by the appearance of four grilles. Above the front spoiler, there are three grille sections all identical in height; the central section accounts for a third of the bumper's width. The largest of the four grilles is located centrally above the other three. The vehicle features carbon-fibre-lined headlight housing, which are positioned in an impressed area of the front facets which also bulges out. They are outlined by two convex curves; however, the outer edge can be divided into two curves. The lighting comes from two circular lamps and then an LED strip in the bottom area of the headlamp unit. Two-thirds of the bonnet width is accounted for by an elevated section a short distance behind the headlights. There is an impression either side of the elevated section that channels air into an intake.\nThe main body area is very linear; the main body line is straight and runs from level with the lower edge of the wheel-arch face to the level with upper edge of the rear wheel-arch face. The upper body line runs along from the top of the front flared wheel-arch through and beyond the rear flared arch, a small, black, ovular rear-view mirror rests on the point where this line meets the A-pillar. For the roadster form, there is a retractable black soft-top that stores under a metal and fabric flip-up lid. The fixed roof form of the car features a long, elegant . Both versions of the car feature frameless door windows and lack B pillars. There is an air vent parallel with the front wheel-arch curve just behind the front wheel-arch. At the point where the intake meets the main body line there is a small turn indicator lamp. At the bottom of the body, the lower edges of the flared arches are connected by a ledge.\nThe rear face of the vehicle has an aggressive design style. The rear lights sit an impressed section of the rear face, a short distance from the top. The rear lights are split into three sections, the top and bottom sections having red lighting, the middle section having orange lighting and closest to the centre, white lighting. The manufacturer logo in located centrally just below the impressed area's edge. On the rear bumper, parallel to the inner edges of the rear lights there is an impressed area where the license plate is mounted. Below this area, three-quarters of the bumper width is occupied by a CFRP unit. Either side of this unit there are stacked twin-tipped exhaust tips located in vent, whose inner edges are parallel to the outer edges of the diffuser.\nThe car is available in two versions that share the same name: a standard hardtop version and a &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20GT%20%28cabrio%29\"&gt;convertible&lt;/a&gt; version with a soft, retractable roof. Both versions have their primary colours applied to the body and the interior stitching. The car uses a set of wheels that are identical to the \"Blade\" high-end wheels also available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;. The Rapid GT also features large cross-drilled brake rotors which are coupled to red, six-piston brake calipers, mounted towards the rear of the wheel.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe vehicle has very good acceleration, but relatively average top speed for the class. Its handling is acceptable, but is otherwise lacking in both response time and cornering radius. It may oversteer at certain corners, but correcting oversteer is easy. Crash deformation, as with most other non-DLC sports cars, is poor, and the car frequently has bent axles or jammed wheels after one or two collisions at speed.\nThe engine model seems to be loosely based on a V8, whereby it assumes a similar design to the 's . Similar to the &lt;a href=\"Furore%20GT\"&gt;Furore GT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Exemplar\"&gt;Exemplar&lt;/a&gt;, it features two cold-air intake systems coming from the upper grille (ram-air intake) of the car.\nNPC-Modified Variants.\nVinewood Modded Rapid GT.\nPre-modified variants of the Rapid GT coupe can be seen driving around &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; randomly, particularly along &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Boulevard\"&gt;Vinewood Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eclipse%20Boulevard\"&gt;Eclipse Boulevard&lt;/a&gt;. The following two sets may spawn only in story mode. The vehicles appear in set color sets with the same modifications.\nSee &lt;a href=\"%23Locations\"&gt;Scenario Locations&lt;/a&gt; for spawn locations.\nLos Santos Customs Modded Single Player.\nLike the randomly spawning modified Rapid GT coupes in Vinewood, two sets of Rapid GT coupes may spawn outside Los Santos Customs, pre-modified. These again only spawn in single player. The vehicles appear in set color sets with the same modifications. They will not spawn with any of the default extra components. These variants are named \"LS_CUSTOMS_MODDED_SP\" and use the exact same modifications and colors as the Vinewood Modded Rapid GT sets.\nSee &lt;a href=\"%23Locations\"&gt;Scenario Locations&lt;/a&gt; for spawn locations.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\n&lt;a href=\"Vehicles%20in%20GTA%20V/Scenarios\"&gt;Scenarios&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Rapid GT coupe is part of the codice_1, \"codice_2\".

The side skirts, side vents, tail lamps, and grille are reminiscent of the ones found on the . The side vent, although clearly taking inspiration from the Interceptor, is divided similarly to the vent found on the . The single headlight setup, rim design, and the majority of the rear fascia, including the lip at the end of the boot, seem to be borrowed from the .\nCertain stripe livery options resemble stripes found on GT350 and GT500 Shelby variants of the '67\u2013'68 Ford Mustang.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nDepicted as the older generation of the &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20GT\"&gt;Rapid GT&lt;/a&gt;, the vehicle assumes the same two-door, front-engine layout, but its design is more squared. Its front end features a chrome split grille, a bumper with two vertical defenses and four rectangular foglamps that are functional when the high beams are active. The outer edges are occupied by the two circular headlamps and the two split rectangle turn signals, both featuring chrome details around them. The bonnet has a simplistic design and the manufacturer emblem can be seen in front of it.\nThe sides are distinguishable by the flared arches, the twin vents on the front fenders and the chrome strip at the bottom, with the door handles, rear-view mirrors and side marker lights also finished in chrome. The greenhouse area also features chrome trim around the windows.\nThe rear of the car features a small boot with a lip on the end bearing the silver \"DEWBAUCHEE\" lettering, followed by a flat panel with the chrome housings on the edges, having the tail light sets. A chrome bumper protects the rear, with the license plate seen below it. The lower portion has two mouldings for the exhaust tubes.\nThe Rapid GT Classic has a mostly unique interior with a wooden trim and steering wheel, leather seats, and manual gated shifter. The dashboard dials and meters are similar to the ones used in muscle car interiors, but differently arranged.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the body, while the secondary colour is applied on the bonnet. A trim colour is also available for the interior, dashboard and seats. It uses a set of wheels that are identical to the ones from the &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20Turbo\"&gt;Sabre Turbo&lt;/a&gt;, being a derivative of the \"Muscle Freak\" muscle wheels available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Rapid GT Classic has decent handling for its class. It has sharp turning capabilities which can lead to oversteer that can be quite challenging at high speeds. The high output V8 engine seems to be a higher-revving variant of the modern Rapid GT engine, which shifts at around 7500rpm in full throttle, and rev limiter set at 8000rpm. Braking is below average when compared to higher end cars in its class. Crash deformation is acceptable.\nThe Rapid GT Classic is powered by a single-cam V8 engine. Unlike other V8 engines found on other cars, this one sports additional details over the centre to give the impression of a slightly larger size. With the supercharger blowers applied, the engine can have additional pulleys that seem to be properly placed on it."}

The taillights are reminiscent of the and the headlights seem to combine elements from both the Invader and T-Rex models, but they might also have been inspired by the .\nThe car features various \"RAPTOR\" markings around the body, which uses a cursive pattern similar to the \"T-REX\" markings from its real-life iteration.\nDesign.\nThe Raptor features a rather compact design, being comparable to the &lt;a href=\"Bifta\"&gt;Bifta&lt;/a&gt; and most vehicles manufactured by the same company. The Raptor's overall bodywork is wedge-positive, while the drivetrain and chassis itself remain completely level. In the front area, the vehicle's hood is in the shape of a curved-edge triangle and gradually becomes thinner towards the front. Numerous grooves are seen in the hood and a triangular grille at the tip of the nose, as well as a grille beside this at either side of the hood. On top of the hood are small twin-circular headlamps which stick out of the vehicle in a cylindrical shape. Various steering arms are found protruding from the nose, attaching to the wheels. These front wheels are covered by small fenders.\nOn the middle section, the sides have an angled profile that aligns with the front, together with long-profile side intakes. These intakes lead to the rear-mid mounted engine. On the cabin area, a half-windscreen is mounted onto the two main A-pillar tubes and two small wing-mirrors are seen mounted on thin supports, while the B-pillar tubes are covered with padding and connect just in front of the rear arch. From the A-pillars, there is a roof section with another scoop leading to the rear. Two black pipes are seen behind the seats and exiting from the rear of the roof scoop, which transfer air into the engine bay.\nOn the rear section, the bodywork itself rises at the rear to reveal the single rear wheel and make space for the exhaust system, and as such, narrows into a thin \"lip\" which ends just above the wheel. Said thin lip holds the set of circular tail lights, with the two central lights being the brake lights, and the outside lights being the turning lights. Another light strip is seen above these. Below the lip, there is a black plate holder with the license plate on the center and the two rectangular reverse lights. The rear wheel is supported by a suspension spring and linkage fixed to the rear axle and bodywork, while the engine partially seen hiding under the body of the car provides transmission through a chain drive. Two exhaust tubes can be seen running beside the wheel, with a carbon-fiber finish around it.\nThe open interior reveals a small set of analog dials and a digital display in between together with a digital radio display on the center. These components are part of a dedicated \"Raptor\" dial set, which shares the same set from the \"Prototipo White\" dials found on the &lt;a href=\"X80%20Proto\"&gt;X80 Proto&lt;/a&gt;. The steering wheel is supported by an exposed steering column, while the interior is fitted with racing seats.\nThe primary color is mostly applied onto the bodywork and the interior, while the secondary color applies in the form of a stripe running from the hood and towards the rear section, as well as the steering arms, pillar tubes, rear-view mirrors, dial panel, gearbox transmission tunnel, part of the racing seats, the rear section and rear wheel linkage. In addition, the \"RAPTOR\" markings found on the seat belts, B-pillar tubes and rear section are painted with the primary color, while the ones found on the front left of the hood, headrests and right side of the dashboard are also painted with the secondary color. It uses a set of wheels similar to the \"Chromatic Z\" high-end rims, which are also available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\nAs expected from a vehicle in the Sports class, the Raptor performs well. It does not quite match the typical sports cars in its class, however it is still very quick and has nippy handling. The single rear wheel, contrary to first-time expectation, does not prove problematic in cornering or reversing, and still remains perfectly stable.\nDue to the singular rear wheel, bumps and curbs in the road severely affect how the Raptor handles. Passing over bumps at high speeds will most likely cause the Raptor to spin out and lose speed. Hitting bumps from the side of the rear wheel also cause this to happen. In addition, reversing the car may cause a slight offset upon initial acceleration, so one has to correct it whenever the player requires reversing the vehicle. The light bodywork also means the car cannot push vehicles or obstacles away with ease, but makes up from the lack of bodywork deformation, meaning collisions would not affect its steering.\nThe Raptor is powered by an inline-6 engine, based on the box-shaped engine and the six exhausts pipes coming from the engine bay. Said engine is coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a rear-mid engine, rear wheel drive layout. The simplified rear wheel drive system makes the Raptor even lighter than the vast majority of the cars, including the &lt;a href=\"Panto\"&gt;Panto&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"X80%20Proto\"&gt;X80 Proto&lt;/a&gt;, explaining the good speed. The vehicle shares its engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Entity%20XF\"&gt;Entity XF&lt;/a&gt;, being extremely high-revving, unusual for its kind. It also produces an engine ignition sound similar to the &lt;a href=\"Vortex%20%28motorcycle%29\"&gt;Vortex&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shotaro\"&gt;Shotaro&lt;/a&gt;."}
