In , the gang is simply referred to as the Russian Mafia, as it is the only Russian crime family in Liberty City by &lt;a href=\"2009\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Leaders\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; of the organization, &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Petrovic\"&gt;Kenny Petrovic&lt;/a&gt;, is believed to be the most powerful Russian kingpin in Liberty City, and possibly &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt;. The syndicate is involved in all types of criminal activities, including drug trade, vehicle thefts and racketeering.\nDescription.\nMembers can be encountered in &lt;a href=\"Hove%20Beach\"&gt;Hove Beach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Firefly%20Island\"&gt;Firefly Island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beachgate\"&gt;Beachgate&lt;/a&gt;. They drive unique customized black &lt;a href=\"Rebla\"&gt;Rebla&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt;s, unlike the &lt;a href=\"Faustin%20Mafiya\"&gt;Faustin/Rascalov Mafiya&lt;/a&gt; who drive &lt;a href=\"Uranus\"&gt;Uranus&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"Ingot\"&gt;Ingot&lt;/a&gt;s. Members of the Petrovic Mafiya dress similarly to the Faustin Mafiya, the only difference being the Petrovic Mafiya often has older members who dress in nicer clothing. They often wear checkered sports coats, sheepskin Harrington jackets, suits with ties, argyle turtleneck sweaters, and trousers. Lower ranking members will often dress in denim jackets over hoodies, Soviet-style leather coats, track jackets, leather ski jackets, jeans, sneakers, and boots. However, in &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;, playable Petrovic Mafiya members reuse character models used by the Faustin/Rascalov Mafiya.\nHowever, being the parts of Russian Organized Crime, both gangs share their hostility and hospitality towards player. After &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; becomes an associate of the &lt;a href=\"Faustin%20Mafiya\"&gt;Faustin Mafiya&lt;/a&gt; he can't be attacked by Russian mobsters under any circumstances, being the part of Russian Organized Crime as well. Despite this, Russian mobsters won't help Russian gangsters in fights, hinting that members of the crime syndicates don't tie themselves with street level criminals. In fact, should the player start a gunfight involving Petrovic and Faustin gangsters, they will open fire on each other, as well as the player.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nGang was founded by &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Petrovic\"&gt;Kenny Petrovic&lt;/a&gt;, who was born in &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1956\"&gt;1956&lt;/a&gt;. His father was a World War II veteran, who fought during the Battle of Stalingrad. Kenny arrived in the US in the 1980s on an Israeli passport though, this was confiscated when evidence came to light that he did not, as previously claimed, have a Jewish grandmother. Kenny joined &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia\"&gt;Russian Organized Crime&lt;/a&gt; and with the permission of the gang's elders started to make money by shipping American-made cars back to Russia. After some time in &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt;, he formed his own organization and became the kingpin of Russian Organized Crime in Liberty City, if not the whole United States.\nDuring the mid-'90s, another Russian criminal, &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Faustin\"&gt;Mikhail Faustin&lt;/a&gt;, exploited a loophole in the immigration treaty to gain US residency. Along with his close friend, &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt;, Mikhail founded his own organization among Russian Organized Crime and later have taken control of it over &lt;a href=\"Hove%20Beach\"&gt;Hove Beach&lt;/a&gt; area, which residents are mostly Russians. Petrovic's Crime Syndicate, however, maintained good relations with Faustin's organization, probably because its interests covered the whole &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;country&lt;/a&gt;, making it unnecessary to go at war for control over one neighborhood.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Petrovic Crime Syndicate had been working alongside the &lt;a href=\"Faustin%20Mafiya\"&gt;Faustin Crime Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; until &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Faustin\"&gt;Mikhail Faustin&lt;/a&gt; goes insane because of his drug addiction. He orders his henchman, &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Final%20Destination\"&gt;execute&lt;/a&gt; Petrovic's son, &lt;a href=\"Lenny%20Petrovic\"&gt;Lenny&lt;/a&gt;, suspecting him of being an &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; informant. Later Faustin orders to destroy Petrovic's &lt;a href=\"Used%20Auto%20Parts\"&gt;garage&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"South%20Bohan\"&gt;South Bohan&lt;/a&gt;, because the owner owes him money and he wants to \"teach people to listen to him\".\nKenny Petrovic then orders the deaths of Faustin's administration, including &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, and Mikhail himself. Dimitri, possibly due to romantic relationships of his cousin with Petrovic's son, strikes a deal with Petrovic that places blame solely on Mikhail, which would have Niko, as the one who killed Petrovic's son, &lt;a href=\"The%20Master%20and%20the%20Molotov\"&gt;assassinate&lt;/a&gt; Mikhail and have Dimitri replace him as &lt;a href=\"Boss\"&gt;the new boss&lt;/a&gt;.\nDimitri proves himself as an effective leader and earner, quickly gaining control over various illegal activities around the city and making new connections, such as &lt;a href=\"Ancelotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Ancelotti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%20Family\"&gt;Pegorino Family&lt;/a&gt;. His successes, however, turns out to be a failure, when one of the people he betrayed earlier, &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, comes for revenge. Dimitri, as well as his new partner &lt;a href=\"James%20Pegorino\"&gt;James Pegorino&lt;/a&gt;, is &lt;a href=\"Endings%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"A%20Revenger%27s%20Tragedy\"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"A%20Dish%20Served%20Cold\"&gt;after&lt;/a&gt; big &lt;a href=\"Heroin\"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt; deal, which is supposed to make him one of the most powerful people in the criminal underworld. Trying to get unsold heroin for himself and leave the country, another major Russian mobster, &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Departure%20Time\"&gt;got killed in his jet&lt;/a&gt;, which leaves Kenny Petrovic's organization as the most powerful Russian crime syndicate in the city and the country.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" Multiplayer.\nShortly after the end of Rascalov's and Bulgarin's Russian crime syndicates, &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Petrovic\"&gt;Kenny Petrovic&lt;/a&gt; flies back from Russia to Liberty City. He and his bodyguards &lt;a href=\"Hangman%27s%20NOOSE\"&gt;were ambushed&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, attempting to leave the private jet. Bodyguards managed to fight NOOSE back and save Petrovic from being arrested, being generously rewarded for their efforts. The charges were probably withdrawn later, due to Petrovic's many connections.\nPetrovic buys himself the old residence of &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Pegorino\"&gt;Jimmy Pegorino&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;, which serves him as the new base of operations. \nPetrovic's Crime Syndicate supplies &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; with methamphetamine, which probably served as the reason for their rivals, the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt;, to destroy one of Petrovic's meth labs. Petrovic responds by sending a squad of his hitmen to &lt;a href=\"Deal%20Breaker%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;raid a drug deal&lt;/a&gt; they made with one of the Mafia families of Liberty City and by ordering a goon to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Arnold\"&gt;chapter leader's&lt;/a&gt; bike, called Sexy Charlie.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Mob\"&gt;Albanian Mob&lt;/a&gt; tries to ship stolen cars out of the country by boat without Petrovic's permission, he orders &lt;a href=\"Bomb%20Da%20Base%20II\"&gt;the hit&lt;/a&gt; on them as well, mentioning that this highly profitable \"business\" was his only source of income when he first arrived in America. His squad steals the explosives from a &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt; and blows the &lt;a href=\"Platypus\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt; up, also ending the Albanian Mob's operations in Liberty City.\nAt some point, Petrovic hires a &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer%20in%20GTA%20IV%23Player%20Model\"&gt;squad of hitmen&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Mafiya%20Work\"&gt;deal with his&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Team%20Mafiya%20Work\"&gt;organization's everyday problems&lt;/a&gt;. He contacts them through the phone and gives different missions and orders, ranging from hiding his mistress from his wife and killing street drug dealers to &lt;a href=\"Car%20Jack%20City\"&gt;steal required&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Team%20Car%20Jack%20City\"&gt;vehicles across the city&lt;/a&gt;. Petrovic's Crime Syndicate seems to have a lot of connections among the criminal underworld of Liberty City, including &lt;a href=\"Rami%20Yalon\"&gt;Rami Yalon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Little%20Jacob\"&gt;Little Jacob&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gordon%20Sargent\"&gt;Gordon Sargent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nBy &lt;a href=\"2009\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;, Petrovic Mafiya, simply referred to as the Russian Mafia, still controls the Hove Beach area of Broker. Meanwhile, the nearby territories of the wiped-out Rascalov and Bulgarin crime syndicates, &lt;a href=\"Firefly%20Island\"&gt;Firefly Island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beachgate\"&gt;Beachgate&lt;/a&gt;, are now controlled by an African-American gang, the &lt;a href=\"Hustlers\"&gt;Hustlers&lt;/a&gt;. The state of Alderney, Petrovic Mafiya's main territory, does not make an appearance in \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\"; therefore, they can only be encountered in their Hove Beach territory in Broker, Liberty City.\nThey are seen driving their variants of &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade%20FXT\"&gt;Cavalcade FXT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt;. Exclusively to the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%20Portable\"&gt;PSP&lt;/a&gt; port, their Cavalcade FXT has a neon underglow. Their favorite radio stations are &lt;a href=\"DJ%20Khalil\"&gt;DJ Khalil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ticklah\"&gt;Ticklah&lt;/a&gt;. Their drug vans can be found in that area, where the player can steal them and take the drugs for themselves.\nHuang can purchase drugs from &lt;a href=\"Cazza\"&gt;Cazza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Borris\"&gt;Borris&lt;/a&gt;, two Russian dealers found around Hove Beach. Their main source of income is selling &lt;a href=\"Ecstasy\"&gt;Ecstasy&lt;/a&gt; and purchasing &lt;a href=\"Cocaine\"&gt;Cocaine&lt;/a&gt; for re-selling.\nThe Russian Mafia plays no major role in the storyline, serving only as enemies during &lt;a href=\"Rampage%21\"&gt;Rampages&lt;/a&gt; and a source of income for the &lt;a href=\"Drug%20Dealing\"&gt;Drug Dealing&lt;/a&gt; minigame. They appear as enemies during the PSP exclusive mission &lt;a href=\"Half%20Cut\"&gt;Half Cut&lt;/a&gt;, due to Huang giving away free cocaine on their turf as part of a drug-related documentary being filmed by &lt;a href=\"Melanie%20Mallard\"&gt;Melanie Mallard&lt;/a&gt;."}

The tail lights have a similar appearance to the , while the trim on the boot may have been influenced by the . \nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Peyote is distinctive by its classic styling, where the front end features a chrome bumper with circular details, as well as a plate holder centered on the driver side. The upper side is mostly dominated by the rectangular grille, having a wider horizontal line and bearing the manufacturer's badge. A set of circular lamps can be seen on the outer edges, housed in chrome sections. Chrome lines cab be also seen on the hood and the fenders.\nOn the sides, chrome trim can be seen at the bottom, the wheel arches and the rear fenders, along with \"V10 Supercharged\" badges on the front fenders and \"Peyote\" badges on the rear fins. The greenhouse area also features chrome trim around the windows, as well as two circular rear-view mirrors.\nThe rear of the car follows a similar layout to the front, where the tail lamps are located in chrome housings and the rear bumper features a plate holder on the passenger side. A chrome detail can be seen on the trunk, followed by chrome letterings displaying the car's name.\nThe Peyote may spawn with or without a solid roof, and a rear extension with a continental kit, resulting in four possible variations. Some Peyotes may also come with zebra skin patterns on the seats and a pair of black &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features%23Fuzzy%20Dice\"&gt;fuzzy dice&lt;/a&gt; hanging from the rear view mirror.\nThe Peyote is set to spawn in a single color and uses wired rims.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe Peyote in \"\" assumes a similar appearance to the \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" version. However, it is permanently depicted as a soft-top convertible with the roof up and a continental kit.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe vehicle returns with the exact same design and model as in \"GTA IV\", featuring the same extra accesories. However the Peyote will no longer spawn with the continental kit, it is instead an optional modification at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Peyote is set to spawn in a variety of colors, where the secondary one is applied on the roof. It also retains the same wheel design, being similar to the \"Big Worm\" rims.\nCurrent Design Gallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nHard Top=\nTopless=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe performance of the Peyote is below average in comparison to other cars of similar size in the game, however it tops the top speed leaderboard for the \"vintage\" class in a multiplayer &lt;a href=\"Races%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;. While having a powerful engine that is able to provide both good acceleration and top speed, its long wheelbase combined with small tires result in poor cornering and stability, often requiring the aid of the handbrake to make moderately sharp turns. At its top speed the Peyote handles badly but if turned just slightly it will not spin.\nInstead of the brakes locking up, the car will still slide, resulting in poor braking. Minor use when in motion is acceptable, but attempting to bring the car to a halt can be difficult. When braking downhill (such as exiting off-ramps), the driver learns to stand on the brakes for quite a distance before the desired stopping point.\nThe badging on the sides reads \"V10 Supercharged\", but the engine under the hood is what appears to be a standard V8 engine with 4 double-barrel downdraft carburetors. The engine sound is a loud engine identical to that of the &lt;a href=\"Voodoo%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Voodoo&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nReturning to \"GTA V\", the car remains relatively unchanged performance wise. The car is slightly heavier, meaning it can be a tough obstacle when it comes to pushing the car out of the way. Its acceleration is also worse, partially due to its weight increase. Its top speed is lowered, and its braking distance has been shortened. The changes do not seem to effect the car much, as its engine is still the same."}

However, the car has received only minor changes, the Peyote badged plate holder, which initially featured on the rear bumper of the original counterpart, is moved to the front and centered, while the rear plate is mounted directly over the car's rear bumper, thus lacking a plate holder (likely to make room for the plate holder modifications). Its underside is fitted with a paintable frame and has a visible driveshaft, a different exhaust setup (dual pipes instead of a single Y-split pipe), and visible hydraulic bars connected to the suspension, and its roof also has a custom pattern detail. The interior is reused from the Peyote, yet the original Vapid badged steering wheel is now replaced to the &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt; one that same as the &lt;a href=\"Voodoo%20Custom\"&gt;Voodoo Custom&lt;/a&gt;'s.\nRather than the Peyote's two-tone color, the Peyote Custom only features a single primary color on the body, but makes up for it by having an interior color and a dial color. The secondary color is applied to the inner sections of the seats, and the roof is permanently white both outside and inside. The vehicle also gets custom \"Big Worm\" lowrider wheels, along with white-wall tires.\nPerformance.\nThe Peyote Custom has slightly improved top speed and traction, though it retains the poor braking and acceleration of its base model. Handling-wise, the vehicle has a weighty feel to it and has a wide turning radius, giving it a slight understeer but not too much that it can't be mitigated by skillful use of brakes and driving. The handbrake will give it a better cornering ability than the normal brakes at higher speeds.\nLike the regular version, the engine under the hood is what appears to be a standard V8 engine with 4 double-barrel downdraft carburetors (with the badges stating a supercharged V10), mated to a 4-speed gearbox ina front engine, rear wheel drive layout.

It also takes inspirations from the , a 1955 Ford Thunderbird gasser.\nNotable changes on the vehicle are the removal of the front bumper and part of the lower side, giving room for the front-mounted oil tank. The front suspension setup was completely rearranged, being a steel axle beam supported by a pair of springs, in a higher height. The grille itself is highly detailed and exposes part of the engine bay and a protective cage around it. The rear wheel arches were cut in order to fit the large drag tires.\nOther minor features were changed as well: the original \"V10 Supercharged\" badge on the sides were removed, and the original black trimming is absent on this model. While the interior remains identical to that of the standard model, it receives a race-type steering wheel. The vehicle may spawn with a stock carbon roof, a painted (primary or secondary) hard top, or no roof, as well as with or without the hood, although all these options can be changed in any vehicle mod shop.\nThe primary color of the car is applied to the body and engine cam covers, while the secondary color is applied to the frames around the engine and the inner sections of the front fenders (easily seen with the hood open or removed). Although not accessible, a trim color is available for the custom seats installed with the \"Roll Cage\" modifications, which is set to black on purchased examples. It uses a set of plain rims with five triangle-shaped details around the center and chrome outer lips, fitted with high-profile tires, with the rear ones being significantly larger and wider. On the front wheels, the outermost section of the rims adjacent to the outer lips are painted with the wheel color, although only naturally-generated examples may have a black color.\nCertain liveries will remove the rear-side Peyote badging when applied.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Peyote Gasser has decent speed, excellent acceleration and fair braking, making it great for speeding in a straight line; however, the vehicle suffers from understeer at higher speeds, making turning quite difficult, thus good brake and speed control is a necessity to be able to turn correctly. Because of the higher ground clearance, the Peyote Gasser can travel through uneven terrain and small obstacles easier than its standard counterpart.\nThe Peyote Gasser has one (the eleventh) Advanced Flag enabled. The purpose of this flag is unknown, but it appears to have little impact on performance.\nThe Peyote Gasser is powered by a single-cam V8 engine fitted with a rounded top-mounted air filter and fully-animated timing belt and pulleys, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front-engine, rear-wheel drive-layout. The engine sound is the same as the &lt;a href=\"Tornado%20Rat%20Rod\"&gt;Tornado Rat Rod&lt;/a&gt;, which derives from the &lt;a href=\"Trophy%20Truck\"&gt;Trophy Truck&lt;/a&gt;, and the engine start-up is the same as the &lt;a href=\"Fr%C3%A4nken%20Stange\"&gt;Fr\u00e4nken Stange&lt;/a&gt;. Some hood options also allows for a supercharger with either single/dual air filters, ram pipes or bug catchers."}

They work almost identically to the &lt;a href=\"Peyote%20Plants%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;Peyote Plants in \"GTA V\"&lt;/a&gt;; however, they spawn at different locations. Unlike &lt;a href=\"Playing%20Cards\"&gt;Playing Cards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Action%20Figures\"&gt;Action Figures&lt;/a&gt;, these respawn after roughly 24 in-game hours and there is no final reward given to the player for collecting them all.\nThe plants can also be eaten while in &lt;a href=\"Passive%20Mode\"&gt;passive mode&lt;/a&gt;. This way, the player cannot hurt anyone while playing as an animal, nor can they be harmed themselves.\nThe police will also ignore the player while playing as an animal.\nIf one is playing with a controller, it will start vibrating once they are near a peyote plant. When consumed, the player starts hallucinating and will pass out, after which they will spawn as a random animal. The selection of animals the player has a chance to spawn as is dictated by where the plant is located \u2013 on land or in the ocean. The following is a list of which animals the player can be transformed into:\nThere are also two special animals the player can turn into. The peyote plant in the backyard of the &lt;a href=\"Clinton%20Residence\"&gt;Clinton Residence&lt;/a&gt; will turn the player into &lt;a href=\"Chop\"&gt;Chop&lt;/a&gt;, though during their activation in October of 2020, there is a known chance of the peyote instead turning the player into any random animal. In &lt;a href=\"Grapeseed\"&gt;Grapeseed&lt;/a&gt;, at the base of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt;, there is a plant that will transform the player into &lt;a href=\"Sasquatch\"&gt;Sasquatch&lt;/a&gt; if consumed between 03:30 and 08:30 and while the weather is foggy. The Sasquatch has super strength and increased health, and it can swim and use weapons, but unlike in single player cannot drive or use the &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Wheel\"&gt;Weapon Wheel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player can end the hallucination at any time, after which they will spawn at the nearest hospital and be awarded 5,000 &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;RP&lt;/a&gt;. The event also ends if the player dies or goes into water.\nLocations.\nNote: Images for locations 58 and 61-76 do not show the actual plants, as they were removed from the game on November 14."}

It can be consumed by the player. Named after the real-life cactus which contains psychoactive properties, this plant seemingly has some sort of hallucinogenic effect on the protagonist's brain and body once taken.\nDescription.\nOnce the player finds a Peyote plant, an on-screen prompt will tell the player to press right on the D-pad in order to eat it. If pressed, a short cutscene will play, during which the player will be seen kneeling down and breaking a chunk off of the Peyote plant, before popping it in their mouth. After this, they will faint and fall on the ground, and the screen will shimmer and display bright colors (similar to the effects of &lt;a href=\"Weed\"&gt;Weed&lt;/a&gt;), and then the screen will suddenly go white. When the player comes to his senses, they will seemingly find themselves in the body of a random animal. While this is obviously part of the hallucination sequence, the player will be able to move the animal around and (for &lt;a href=\"birds\"&gt;birds&lt;/a&gt;) even fly it around the gameworld (using controls similar to those of flying normal fixed-wing aircraft), interacting with pedestrians and other animals. The player is unable to pick up any objects while in the hallucinogenic state, so exploring underwater &lt;a href=\"wrecks\"&gt;wrecks&lt;/a&gt; can be done but no weapons or &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Packages%23Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;briefcases&lt;/a&gt; can be collected. Similarly, money and weaponry dropped by NPCs killed by the animal cannot be collected.\nIn the bird's body, the player is able to fly around the state, and will quite humorously be able to defecate on command (often times with comical consequences). As any quadrupedal animal (&lt;a href=\"dogs\"&gt;dogs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cats\"&gt;cats&lt;/a&gt;, etc.), the player is able to press the \"horn\" button to make the animal produce sounds (barks, meows, etc.) During the hallucination, the protagonist can be heard talking in his normal voice, in a complete state of awe at the peyote plant's powerful effects.\nThe player cannot choose which type of animal they can take control of, however the peyote will make echoing animal noises when the player is near it, giving them a hint what they will turn into as well as the plant's whereabouts (this is arguably not too helpful as it can also be an actual animal making noise). If the animal somehow dies or goes into water, the hallucination will end, and the player will find themself back in their own body. Alternatively, the player can pick when to end the hallucination by holding the right on the D-Pad. As the drug starts to wear off, the protagonist can be seen near the original plant's location, still mimicking the animal's behavior, such as flapping his wings (if he was a bird), or crawling around on the ground (if he was a dog). After some time, he will regain his senses.\nEven if the player is an animal, &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; interaction will still be treated like normal. For example, if the player approaches some gangsters as an animal, they would talk to him and open fire if provoked. Pedestrians not killed outright by an attack may fight back against the animal rather than fleeing. &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt; may respond to any \"crime\" committed as an animal, such as killing or harassing (by standing in front of the people until they call the police). Expect a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; when flying over any restricted area as a bird. Wanted levels can be eliminated by ending the hallucination. Playable animals can also be attacked and killed by NPC animals in the wilderness.\nLocations.\nThere are 27 standard collectible Peyote plant locations.\nReward.\nCollecting the 21 Land-based Peyote Plants will unlock all the controllable animals and award the player the Cryptozoologist &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20and%20Trophies%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;.\nHidden Bonus: Golden Peyote.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events%20Update\"&gt;Freemode Events Update&lt;/a&gt;, the Peyote plant hunt was expanded upon.\nIf a player has completed the game &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;100%&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20One\"&gt;The Last One&lt;/a&gt; side-mission and has found all 27 Peyote Plants, golden Peyote plants will appear, one in a different location for each day of the week but only from 5:30 to 8:00 AM in the morning and only when there is snowy or foggy weather.\nEating these golden plants will turn the player into &lt;a href=\"Sasquatch\"&gt;Sasquatch&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player needs to eat each of the golden Peyote plants in order from Sunday to Saturday.\nThey will be able to observe a dead animal or a dead human nearby each time they \"transform\" and when eating the last plant on Saturday morning, the &lt;a href=\"Sasquatch%20Hunter\"&gt;Sasquatch Hunter&lt;/a&gt; will be seen laying dead next to the player.\nGrowling at this point will cause a howl to sound from the distance, which the player needs to follow, starting a hunt of sorts that consists of following a trail of dead bodies. Eventually, the player will arrive at &lt;a href=\"Thomson%20Scrapyard\"&gt;Thomson Scrapyard&lt;/a&gt; and growling will be disabled.\nThe very last body will be located next to a small shack nearby where the camera will then focus onto the top of one of the plane carcasses, whereupon a &lt;a href=\"Beast\"&gt;Beast&lt;/a&gt; will jump down, starting a fight with the player. If the player wins, the hallucination will end automatically and the Sasquatch and Beast characters will be unlocked in &lt;a href=\"Director%20Mode\"&gt;Director Mode&lt;/a&gt;."}

Furthermore, some of the design elements are incorporated from the , and the . Additionally, the Phantom features a T-bar and tail lights that resemble the . \nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe truck serves as the only semi-trailer truck available in the game (although it is unable to &lt;a href=\"Towing\"&gt;move&lt;/a&gt; any of the cargo trailers around the city) and is possibly used in Labor Union Trucking (as the truck is driven by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Commission\"&gt;Italian Mafia&lt;/a&gt;). The front of the vehicle features a large heavy-duty bumper with a red/white warning stripe at the bottom, the license plate on the center and a set of bumper guides on the edges. The front of the nose is finished in silver/chrome and features a large grille with a riveted surrounding and dual circular headlights mounted on either side of the grille, while the sides of the nose have large circular fenders for the front wheels. The same nose features cursive \"Jobuilt\" badges above the grille and on the sides.\nThe main cabin of the truck is very elevated, featuring a set of side steps and large fuel tanks on the lower sides, as well as cab skirts with additional lights. On the middle section, the truck features two large air cleaners between the nose and the cabin doors, long grab handles next to the doors and large vertical exhaust stacks between the main cabin and the sleeper cab. The upper area features a split windshield with a custom visor on the front, large rear-view mirrors on the doors and numerous circular marker lights and trumpet horns on the roof of the main cabin, along with fewer rectangular marker lights on the rear end of the sleeper cab. The sides of the sleeper cab bear gold \"JOBUILT\" and silver \"Phantom V24 Supercharged\" badges.\nThe rear section consist of the bare chassis with the corresponding , featuring side access ladders and small mudguards in front of the wheel set. The rear end has circular tail lights on the upper side, a central license plate below the reverse lights and large mudflaps behind the wheel set, bearing cursive \"Jobuilt\" badges at the bottom. Behind the sleeper cab, there are two vertical frames attached to the edges of the same, possibly intended to prevent the trailer damaging the truck when turning too sharply.\nThe truck is available in several single colors for the cabin, the sleeper cab and the front mudguards of the rear section. It uses industrial wheels also seen in vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Yankee\"&gt;Yankee&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Phantom is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; system with a male voice, but only if the player leaves the \"selected cars\" (default) option in the audio menu.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Phantom returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" with the same design as in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\". However, it gains the ability to tow trailers, along with other semi-trucks featured in the game. The Phantom is also fitted with a CB radio, and occasional trucker chatter can be heard regardless of whether the main radio is turned on or off. The chatter will only play if playing as &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;.\nAgain, the truck is available in several single colors for the cabin, the sleeper cab and the front mudguards of the rear section, and uses the same industrial wheels from its previous rendition, also seen in vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Tow%20Truck%20%28Yankee-based%29\"&gt;Yankee-based Towtruck&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", the Phantom's performance is above average for what one might expect from a truck of its size. It has above average acceleration, and given enough room, can reach an impressive top speed that can rival some sports cars. Cornering is rather sluggish, and careful use of the brakes are required at higher speeds to offset the understeer. Few non-armored vehicles can match the durability of the Phantom. Deformation damage seldom has need of being considered, and the engine can take several hard blows before giving out. As expected, it has a very high mass, easily ramming traffic out of the way, and capable of setting vehicles on fire with just one hit at a decent speed. As long as tight spaces are out of the question, the Phantom is quite viable for use as a chase or getaway vehicle. Despite being an enormous vehicle, the Phantom can still be used to perform burnouts and \"donuts\".\nThe Phantom has, according to badges, a 24-valve Supercharged engine. Strangely, the engine model for the Phantom appears to use 8 spark plugs textures, suggesting it is a petrol engine (untypical for a vehicle of this kind). It also suggests the engine can only be a petrol single-cam V8, but with a boxy appearance and connected to an adjacent air filter, with no sight of a supercharged as claimed. The 7-speed gearbox seems to be a rare use of an auxiliary gearbox in-game; a secondary gearbox working very similar to twin-geared bikes - the secondary gearbox having less gears than the primary gearbox, but giving the primary gearbox more potential by allowing a higher combination of gears. The exact same feature is found on the &lt;a href=\"Packer\"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt; in GTA IV. The gear shifts are very low and ratios seem almost equal (apart from the last gear). Its engine sound is somewhat similar to a diesel engine, which revs moderately high (yet still lower than other trucks, such as the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt;), and provides a significantly smooth engine sound, yet the roar produced from the engine can still be heard unlike the aforementioned vehicles, the Benson and Securicar.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", the performance is virtually identical to its \"GTA IV\" counterpart. However, the general speed increase of vehicles in the game have toned down the advantages present before. It can still serve as a decent vehicle to travel long distances with, due to its acceptable speed and excellent durability. It is not recommended for off-road use, due to its top-heaviness and slow acceleration on slopes.\nAgain, the Phantom has, according to badges, a 24-valve Supercharged engine, with the same engine model as in \"GTA IV\". However, it has a traditional 5-speed gearbox, lacking the auxiliary gearbox altogether. It retains the same engine sound from the \"GTA IV\" iteration, being also shared with trucks like the &lt;a href=\"Packer\"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Pounder\"&gt;Pounder&lt;/a&gt;."}

It also has custom flame sounds and effects, with a unique detuned horn. It will be driven by an invisible NPC to give the appearance it is driving on its own.\nThe Phantom Car will spawn in any free roam session with a minimum of two players, and when at least 15 minutes has passed since the player joined. Once these criteria are met, the Phantom Car will spawn between 9pm and 5am, and choose one of the players as an attack target when they're on foot or in normal vehicles (planes, boats, weaponized vehicles and special vehicles are not allowed).\nWhen a target player is inside a vehicle, the Phantom Car will remain passive and simply follow the player around. However, when they're on foot, it will become aggressive, the hood will catch fire and its headlights will turn red, and it will attempt to ram and kill them. The target player can also catch fire from the car when being attacked, and the fire will keep burning until they have died, which is different from the normal settings, while it has no effect on non-target players. The Phantom Car is almost indestructible, but can be defeated through the use of explosive weapons (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Grenade%20Launcher\"&gt;Grenade Launcher&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe event will be completed and the Phantom Car will disappear after it has been defeated or the target player has been killed. If it is stuck for too long, doesn't encounter an on-foot target, gets forced into an interior such as &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, or other events are triggered, then the car will simply despawn.\nInfluence.\nThe Phantom Car is a reference to \"Christine\", a malevolently possessed &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Astephenking%3AChristine_%28car%29\"&gt;1958 Plymouth Fury&lt;/a&gt; that stars in the Stephen King novel and 1983 film of the &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Astephenking%3AChristine_%28film%29\"&gt;same name&lt;/a&gt;. The way the vehicle catches fire and attempts to run over the player is a reference to a scene in the film where Christine attempts to run over a gang member that has vandalized her while being set ablaze."}

The fact it is one of the vehicles to carry the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt; seems to take inspirations from the from \"\".\nThe Phantom Custom is a customizable variant of the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;, which retains the general layout and most of the features from the regular version. However, the bumper has a different shape at the bottom and omits the red/white warning stripe, while the headlights are housed in front of the fenders rather than beside the grille area. The nose of the truck is more square shaped and the fenders have an angular design. The cabin area is mostly similar, but the mirrors are finished in black rather than in silver/chrome, and the roof features a different set of marker lights and dual trumpet horns on either side. The sleeper cab is also taller and more square shaped. The rear section is mostly similar, but the side access ladders are wider (similar to the &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Wedge\"&gt;Phantom Wedge&lt;/a&gt;) and the mudguards in front of the wheels are also angular in design, while the rear mudflaps no longer bear the cursive \"Jobuilt\" badges at the bottom. Like the Phantom Wedge, the Phantom Custom can carry three additional passengers on the back if no trailers are attached to it, with two sitting on either side access ladder and one on the rear end, near the fifth wheel. Players in the rear section can also switch seats if there is an empty slot.\nLike the regular Phantom and the Phantom Wedge, the vehicle only has a primary color for the cabin and the sleeper cab, and also retains the same industrial wheels from the aforementioned trucks.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Phantom Custom performs similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Wedge\"&gt;Phantom Wedge&lt;/a&gt;, but having the same mass as the regular &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in a slightly better acceleration (which can be improved further with performance upgrades). The heavy mass gives the truck good traction on most surfaces, and is able to push most vehicles with no significant speed/torque loss. However, the brakes of the vehicle are somewhat lacking compared to other performance stats, requiring long distances before stopping the vehicle completely. When going on a downhill, the truck may take too much distance to stop, therefore it is advised to take great care when going downhill with the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt; attached.\nOverall, it performs similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Hauler%20Custom\"&gt;Hauler Custom&lt;/a&gt;, but has limited steering capabilities in favour of mass and ramming power. Because of the open windows, the front occupants can make use of &lt;a href=\"Thrown%20Weapons\"&gt;thrown weapons&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bombs\"&gt;Sticky Bombs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Proximity%20Mines\"&gt;Proximity Mines&lt;/a&gt;. Players in the rear section can make use of two-handed weapons (namely &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Combat%20MG\"&gt;Combat MGs&lt;/a&gt;), at the cost of being vulnerable to fall from the truck if it flips down or being hit by another vehicle.\nThe Phantom Custom has, according to badges, a 24-valve Supercharged engine. Strangely, the engine model for the Phantom Custom appears to use 8 spark plugs textures, suggesting it is a petrol engine (untypical for a vehicle of this kind). It also suggests the engine can only be a petrol single-cam V8, but with a boxy appearance and connected to an adjacent air filter, with no sight of a supercharged as claimed. The engine sound is very different from other trucks, being a low-revving diesel engine also shared with the Hauler Custom.\nArmor.\nAs with the Hauler Custom, the vehicle is incredibly durable, able to take multiple explosions before being destroyed. The cabin also offers limited protection to the occupants thanks to its bullet-resistant windows, which can withstand up to 15 rounds from most firearms before being shattered. The truck also has a strong body, meaning it can withstand several collisions with virtually no deformation. If the MOC trailer is destroyed, the Phantom Custom will despawn, even if it hasn\u2019t taken any damage.\nWith 100% Armor Upgrade and a driver inside (otherwise one of the two each will halve the vehicle\u2019s resistance), the Phantom Custom can take the following:\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Phantom Custom can only be modified at a &lt;a href=\"Bunkers\"&gt;bunker&lt;/a&gt; vehicle workshop, along with the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen purchased, the Phantom Custom comes painted in the following colors by default:"}
{"id": "172117", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=172117", "title": "Phantom Wedge", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Jobuilt\"&gt;Jobuilt&lt;/a&gt; Phantom Wedge is a modified semi-trailer truck featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the update.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Phantom Wedge, as the name implies, is a modified version of the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt; with a large, defensive metal wedge added to the front to ram vehicles. Its appearance appears to be heavily based on the used by Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman in their last episode of the popular show \"MythBusters\", in the Grand Finale, where they used it to plow through all the props used in their long-lasting run.\nThe Phantom's hood has been removed in order to fit the massive structure that connects the wedge to the truck, composed of welded bars placed around the front and to the rear area of the vehicle. The front fenders are partially cut and the roof has two circular headlights, while the side access ladders on the rear section are wider. Unlike the regular Phantom, the Phantom Wedge can carry three additional passengers on the back if no trailers are attached to it, with two sitting on either side access ladder and one on the rear end, near the fifth wheel. Players in the rear section can also switch seats if there is an empty slot.\nThe Phantom appears with a rusty appearance and spawns with a single primary color for the cabin and the sleeper cab (which alternates between white and black in naturally-generated examples). It also retains the industrial wheel design from the regular Phantom.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Phantom Wedge improves drastically over its regular counterpart, as it has better acceleration and top speed. The truck can be advantageous over the &lt;a href=\"Ramp%20Buggy\"&gt;Ramp Buggy&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Armored%20Boxville\"&gt;Armored Boxville&lt;/a&gt;, as not only can hit small vehicles with ease, but can depart other heavy vehicles with no problem. Its only downside is that the wedge makes the vehicle much longer than usual, being very tricky to navigate through alleyways, buildings other similar environments. Players in the rear section can switch seats when a slot is available, offering total coverage for defense with two-handed weapons (namely &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Combat%20MG\"&gt;Combat MG&lt;/a&gt;s), at the cost of being vulnerable to fall from the truck if it flips down or being hit by another vehicle.\nPrior to the update, the Phantom Wedge could be damaged by ramming multiple cars, causing its engine to emit smoke from the sides. If the player was still ramming cars after said warning, the engine will stop working, disabling the Phantom Wedge. This issue was shared with the &lt;a href=\"Ramp%20Buggy\"&gt;Ramp Buggy&lt;/a&gt;.\nInstead of the traditional box-shaped engine, the Phantom Wedge utilizes a single-cam V8 engine. The badges are retained from the regular Phantom, stating it is a supercharged 24 valve engine (despite no supercharger being present). The vehicle's exposed engine means the visible timing belt functions, rotating the cams and crank, similar in fashion to the &lt;a href=\"Fr%C3%A4nken%20Stange\"&gt;Fr\u00e4nken Stange&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tornado%20Rat%20Rod\"&gt;Tornado Rat Rod&lt;/a&gt;. It shares the same engine sound from the regular Phantom and many industrial trucks, only with a slight higher-revving tone due to the improved engine power."}

Tommy, who has become drunk from the boomshine fumes, manages to drive Phil to an ex-army surgeon who owes Phil favours. As a token of gratitude, Phil allows Tommy to purchase weapons from him."}

As the name implies, it is a shooting range to give the &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; practice with manually aimed weapons. Like the shooting range in ', it can be very difficult due to the limitations of the analog stick or D-pad of the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%20Portable\"&gt;PlayStation Portable&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; consoles being used as the manual aim.\nThe shooting range has five rounds. The rounds have to be completed in a single try; if the player fails or quits, they will have to start from the beginning. The guns used for each round are &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;9mm pistol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Action%20Shotgun\"&gt;Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"M16\"&gt;M16&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Sniper\"&gt;Dragunov&lt;/a&gt; laser sighted sniper rifle.

Shooting a friendly target is treated as a miss in the accuracy calculation and will deduct 200 points from the player's score.\nA similar shooting competition-style side mission is played in \"\". The major difference is that the \"GTA SA\" game is a competition with AI-controlled characters, whereas the VCS version is only Victor vs. the clock.\nRewards.\nAfter all rounds are completed, the player will receive &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;2,500 and get a 25% discount for all weapons in and &lt;a href=\"Stonewall%20J%27s\"&gt;Stonewall J's&lt;/a&gt;."}

He was seen as a consigliere figure to Don &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Pegorino\"&gt;Jimmy Pegorino&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0He was\u00a0a friend of Pegorino crime family captain &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt;, even though they both almost constantly\u00a0argued and disagreed.\u00a0Bell wasn't a made-man as he is only 10% Italian, and most of his family originated from &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhil Bell was born in 1967 in &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20City\"&gt;Alderney City&lt;/a&gt;. He is mostly of Irish ancestry, with small Italian heritage, though he acts as if he was a full Italian, probably to fit in with his fellow mafioso. In 1984, at age of 17, he was arrested for trying to steal a car.\nPhil was arrested in 1988 and 1990 for promoting gambling and manslaughter respectively. Phil had likely joined the Pegorino Family by then; Jimmy Pegorino says in &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%27s%20Pride\"&gt;Pegorino's Pride&lt;/a&gt; that Phil is a long-time trusted business partner of his. He also says that he wishes to promote Phil, but worries whether it will offend the Commission, who often discriminate against non-Italians. He was previously married and has at least two children, but is now involved in a court battle with his ex-wife over custody of their children.\nPhil maintains that he is a legitimate businessman, managing construction yards and the Pegorino-owned &lt;a href=\"Honker%27s%20Gentlemen%27s%20Club\"&gt;Honker's Gentlemen's Club&lt;/a&gt; based in &lt;a href=\"Tudor\"&gt;Tudor&lt;/a&gt;. The authorities have his places of business bugged, so he speaks in generalities which will not implicate him in anything, and is especially cautious with his planning. He and fellow Pegorino capo Ray Boccino secretly hate each other, because Phil believes \"every move he makes is so obvious, it's disgusting to see him trying to sleaze his way up the ladder\". Ray is also much more ambitious and even selfish, while Phil believes that \"there ain't much in this life you got control of\", which is why he follows Jimmy's orders to the letter, even when he believes it won't work perfectly (as seen in &lt;a href=\"Catch%20the%20Wave\"&gt;Catch the Wave&lt;/a&gt;). Phil and Jimmy Pegorino's wife &lt;a href=\"Angie%20Pegorino\"&gt;Angie&lt;/a&gt; are very good friends, causing some to believe they're having an affair. Jimmy doesn't believe the rumors, and has trust in Phil. Phil's role within the Pegorino family is never stated.\nBased on his reactions during the mission &lt;a href=\"Trespass\"&gt;Trespass&lt;/a&gt;, Phil appears to have a fear of flying.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nMeeting Niko Bellic.\nPhil first meets &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Museum%20Piece\"&gt;failed diamonds deal&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20Mob\"&gt;Jewish Mob&lt;/a&gt;, as the money were stolen by &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; member &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;. Phil tells to both Niko and Ray that Pegorino is angry because of the deal gone wrong. The two then sent Niko to find and kill Johnny's associate &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;Jim Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;.\nEmploying Niko.\nAfter some work with Ray, Niko was sent to work for Phil, who planned to attack and rob both the &lt;a href=\"Ancelotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Ancelottis&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Faustin%20Mafiya\"&gt;Faustin Mafiya&lt;/a&gt;. The two steal a truck loaded with drugs, and attack a dock full of Russians, stealing two drug boats.\nEnding.\nTowards the end of the game, the &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Pegorino Family&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0receives too much police attention, leading Jimmy to believe the family has several rats. He contemplates which one of his capos he should kill - Phil and Ray each secretly suggest to Pegorino that he kill the other. Jimmy eventually decides to kill Ray. At the very end, whether Deal or Revenge is chosen, Phil chooses to leave organized crime for good in favor of a simple life in a small town. In the Deal ending, after all the mess of the exchange with &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt;, he wishes Niko all the best and they part on good terms.\nHowever, if the Revenge ending is chosen, Niko decides not to make the deal with Dimitri and executes him on the &lt;a href=\"Platypus\"&gt;Platypus&lt;/a&gt;, ruining the Pegorinos in the process. Afterwards, Phil calls Niko. Phil is not angry, and even supports his decision, stating (correctly, as proven by choosing Deal) that Dimitri always gave him a bad feeling. Phil, however, tells him that he can't see him again, as it would cause problems.\nCharacter.\nInfluence.\nPhil Bell may be based on from the film \"\". They are both Irish-Italians who can't become high ranking members due to their Irish ancestry. In the opening cutscene for Catch the Wave, Phil asks Niko if he's seen a surveillance helicopter, which is a reference to a scene from the movie."}

Jerry sends Vic to help Phil get rid of some &lt;a href=\"Cholos\"&gt;Cholos&lt;/a&gt; that are giving him trouble.

After being saved by Vic, Phil promises to stay sober from now on; however, he begins to drink again when &lt;a href=\"Armando%20Mendez\"&gt;Armando Mendez&lt;/a&gt; kills Louise. Phil, wanting revenge on the &lt;a href=\"Mendez%20Cartel\"&gt;Mendez Brothers&lt;/a&gt;, gets drunk and blows up the entrance of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Baxter%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Fort Baxter Air Base&lt;/a&gt; so that Vic can steal a &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt; helicopter to attack the &lt;a href=\"The%20Mendez%20Building\"&gt;Mendez compound&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt; hires Phil to pull off a bank robbery in the mission \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Shootist\"&gt;The Shootist&lt;/a&gt;\". Phil is the one who suggests Tommy should employ &lt;a href=\"Hilary%20King\"&gt;Hilary King&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"The%20Driver\"&gt;getaway driver&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"The%20Job\"&gt;robbery&lt;/a&gt;, Phil invites Tommy to work for him in order to get fixed with firepower. After Tommy &lt;a href=\"Gun%20Runner\"&gt;kills&lt;/a&gt; Phil's &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20Garcia\"&gt;rival gun dealer&lt;/a&gt;, a drunken Phil invites Tommy over to check out a Boomshine bomb he had set up, wired to a remote detonator. The remote doesn't work the first time, so Phil changes its batteries for fresh ones sitting beside the bomb. Now standing just a meter away from the powerful explosive, in inebriated carelessness, he presses the remote's trigger, detonating the bomb and blowing his left arm off. Tommy drives Phil to an ex-army surgeon to be patched up. Tommy and Phil start an arms business, with Phil supplying Tommy with expensive heavy weapons not available in local Ammu-Nations throughout the rest of the game.\nIn \"GTA Vice City\", Phil's mobile home is accessible. Gun Racks displaying several handguns, submachine guns and rifles are on the wall. When his bedroom is entered, his bed consists of a camouflaged mattress, an American Flag-styled pillow, and a few girl posters on the walls. A &lt;a href=\"Kaufman%20Cabs\"&gt;Kaufman Cabs&lt;/a&gt; calendar can also be seen in his mobile home. He also has a &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt; parked inside a hangar next to his home.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nBy &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;, Phil resides in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, where he owns a &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Cassidy%27s%20Fully%20Cocked%20Gun%20Shop\"&gt;gun store&lt;/a&gt;, selling heavy artillery. Phil makes a short appearance during the mission \"&lt;a href=\"More%20Deadly%20Than%20the%20Male\"&gt;More Deadly Than the Male&lt;/a&gt;\" as &lt;a href=\"Toshiko%20Kasen\"&gt;Toshiko Kasen&lt;/a&gt;'s gun dealer. During the cutscene at the end, Phil admits that he does so much business at the docks he should set himself up there and not halfway down Staunton Island. This explains why he has left his &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Cassidy%27s%20Fully%20Cocked%20Gun%20Shop\"&gt;heavy artillery store&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bedford%20Point\"&gt;Bedford Point&lt;/a&gt; and has moved to his &lt;a href=\"Phil%27s%20Army%20Surplus\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rockford\"&gt;Rockford&lt;/a&gt; by the time of the events of \"GTA III\".\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;, corrupt &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; cop &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Machowski\"&gt;Ray Machowski&lt;/a&gt; commissions &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; to go and &lt;a href=\"Arms%20Shortage\"&gt;meet Phil at his shop&lt;/a&gt;, since some members of the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;Colombian Cartel&lt;/a&gt; tried to extort weapons out of Phil. Phil and Claude attack the Cartel men as they arrive and kill them, preventing them from stealing Phil's weapons. During this mission, Phil claims to have lost his arm in &lt;a href=\"Nicaragua\"&gt;Nicaragua&lt;/a&gt;.\nPost-\"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nHe is also mentioned in &lt;a href=\"2003\"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Manhunt\"&gt;Manhunt&lt;/a&gt;\" by members of the Carcer City Police Department. This implies he expanded his business over to &lt;a href=\"Carcer%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Carcer City&lt;/a&gt; too, which is close to Liberty City according to the &lt;a href=\"Lips%20106\"&gt;Lips 106&lt;/a&gt; news segment in \"GTA III\".\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nIn all of Phil's appearances, he appears as a manic heavy artillery arms dealer, selling the protagonist military-grade weaponry such as &lt;a href=\"Grenade\"&gt;grenades&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;rocket launchers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;miniguns&lt;/a&gt;. Phil presents himself as a military veteran and regularly discusses his experiences, including claims of having \"flashbacks\" to the &lt;a href=\"Vietnam\"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href=\"Cam%20Jones\"&gt;Cam Jones&lt;/a&gt; claims that Phil was never in the army, and Phil's records show that he was repeatedly refused for service due to \"drunkenness and unsuitable temperament for combat\".\nPhil has been featured as a heavy drinker. He distils \"&lt;a href=\"Boomshine\"&gt;Boomshine&lt;/a&gt;\", a highly explosive mixture that can get a man drunk off its fumes alone, which he started distilling and selling in Vice City around &lt;a href=\"1984\"&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt;. During a phone conversation with &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt;, he explains that, due to his heavy boomshine consumption, he is blind in his left eye.\nPhil\u2019s dialogue in certain missions indicates that he drinks as a result of possible depression, likely due to his bad relationship with his father. Otherwise, he appeared to have a good relationship with Louise and was genuinely mournful of her death. It was shown that her death caused Phil to return to his drinking habits.\nDespite his fault, Phil overall appeared to be very loyal and respectful to those he cared about and would go above and beyond for them, including attacking a military base to name a few, that includes Vic, Lance, Tommy, even Martinez for a time. It\u2019s likely that Martinez\u2019 betrayal worsened his paranoia.\nAppearance.\nPhil's most notable feature is his one arm. He &lt;a href=\"Boomshine%20Saigon\"&gt;lost his left arm&lt;/a&gt; in 1986 after he was caught in the blast radius of a boomshine bomb, during the events of \"GTA Vice City\". His subsequent appearances also depict him with only one arm. He is overweight and blond-haired, with a short nose, grey-blue eyes, a square jaw and a cleft chin. \nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\", Phil is sporting a handlebar moustache. By 1986, he shaved it off permanently. Moreover, in the 1980s, Phil's hair was styled in a mullet, and by 1998 he sports a crew cut instead and still does as of 2001.\nPhil's fashion sense would slowly become more military-like as time passed. In 1984, he wears a vest and jeans. Two years later, he sports a black muscle shirt with a Confederate flag on it, along with green cargo shorts and white sneakers.

Collins' appearance in \"\" makes him the first &lt;a href=\"Real%20People%20in%20GTA\"&gt;real-life celebrity&lt;/a&gt; to physically appear as himself in a \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" game.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nCollins was given a toy drum kit for Christmas when he was five. Later, his uncle Mark Wade made him a makeshift one that he used regularly. As Collins grew older these were followed by more complete sets bought by his parents. He practiced by playing alongside the television and radio, and never learned to read and write conventional musical notation; instead, he uses a system he devised himself.\nHis professional training began at fourteen when he entered Barbara Speake Stage School. He began a career as a child actor and model, and won his first major role as The Artful Dodger in the London production of Oliver!. He was an extra in The Beatles' A Hard Day's Night - one of hundreds of screaming teenagers during the TV concert sequence and seen fleetingly in a close-up. He was also in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. He also auditioned for the role of Romeo in Romeo and Juliet (1968). In 1970, the 19-year old Collins played percussion on the George Harrison song \"The Art of Dying\". Harrison credited him in the liner notes to the remastered CD version of the album released in 2000. Collins was among the last three finalists for the role of \"I.Q.\" on the children's American television show The Bugaloos (he lost out to English actor/musician .\nDespite the beginnings of an acting career, Collins continued to gravitate towards music. While attending Chiswick Community School he formed a band called The Real Thing and later joined The Freehold. With the latter group, he wrote his first song titled \"Lying Crying Dying\".\nCollins' first record deal came as drummer for Flaming Youth who released a single album, Ark 2 (1969). Melody Maker featured the album as \"Pop Album of the Month\", describing it as \"adult music beautifully played with nice tight harmonies\". However, the album's main single, \"From Now On\", was a commercial failure. After a year of touring, band tensions and the lack of commercial success dissolved the group.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nIn 1984, Phil is in Vice City for an upcoming concert. Phil's manager, &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Mickelthwaite\"&gt;Barry Mickelthwaite&lt;/a&gt; owes $3,000,000 to &lt;a href=\"Giorgio%20Forelli\"&gt;Giorgio Forelli&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; capo, and he is worried that Forelli is going to try and assassinate Phil if he does not get his money back. &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;Victor Vance&lt;/a&gt;, who is working for Barry's friend &lt;a href=\"Reni%20Wassulmaier\"&gt;Reni Wassulmaier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kill%20Phil\"&gt;agrees to go with Barry to meet Phil&lt;/a&gt;, who is arriving in the city by helicopter. Vic and Barry meet Phil, who is also greeted by some Forelli Family gunmen. The gunmen destroy Phil's helicopter a few moments after he alights. Vic kills the gunmen and drives Phil and Barry to Phil's hotel.\nA few days later, Vic meets Barry, Phil and Reni at the &lt;a href=\"InterGlobal%20Films\"&gt;film studio&lt;/a&gt;. Phil is due to perform a soundcheck for his concert at the &lt;a href=\"Hyman%20Memorial%20Stadium\"&gt;Hyman Memorial Stadium&lt;/a&gt; later that day, and Barry wants Vic to . Vic arrives at the stadium to find it filled with armed Forelli gang members. He kills many of them, eventually finding a basement keycard. He heads down to the basement to find some hitmen planting a bomb. Vic kills them and defuses the bomb before Phil and Barry arrive.\nA few weeks pass and &lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Air%20Tonight\"&gt;the day of Phil's concert arrives&lt;/a&gt;. After escorting Reni, who has just had her fourth sex change, to the airport, Vic heads to the concert. When he arrives, Phil is already on stage and Barry is worried that Giorgio's men are going to make an attempt on Phil's life during the concert. Barry's fears are confirmed when Vic spots a man trying to sabotage the lighting rig, with Phil directly underneath. Vic successfully fends off Forelli's men, and Phil completes his concert intact. After the concert, Vic congratulates Phil, and Barry decides to pay Giorgio his money back to avoid any more threats to Phil's life. Phil sarcastically suggests Vic becomes his new manager, before announcing to Barry that he plans to spend a few days in Vice City on holiday, and suggests Barry takes Reni's advice and gets breast implants to accompany \"the real [tit he] use[s] for a head\".\nUpon completing \"In the Air Tonight\", the player can purchase a ticket to see the \"Phil Collins: Live in Vice City\" concert at the Hyman Memorial Stadium. The ticket costs $6,000 and allows Vic to watch an uninterrupted rendition of Collins performing In the Air Tonight.\nIn addition to his physical appearance in the game, Collins appears as one of the imaging voices on &lt;a href=\"Emotion%2098.3\"&gt;Emotion 98.3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flash%20FM\"&gt;Flash FM&lt;/a&gt;."}

At some point, she collaborated with billionaire &lt;a href=\"Avon%20Hertz\"&gt;Avon Hertz&lt;/a&gt; when he was working with the IAA.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nAfter &lt;a href=\"The%20Data%20Breaches\"&gt;an attack by mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; on an IAA &lt;a href=\"Facilities%23The%2010th%20Facility\"&gt;facility&lt;/a&gt;, Rackman and &lt;a href=\"Agent%2014\"&gt;Agent 14&lt;/a&gt; enter a war room in the facility expecting to find more enemies, but instead come across the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;\"GTA Online\" Protagonist&lt;/a&gt;, having already killed the attackers. She is initially suspicious of the Protagonist's presence at the facility, holding them at gunpoint until &lt;a href=\"Agent%2014\"&gt;Agent 14&lt;/a&gt; vouches for them. Not long after, Avon arrives and explains that he sent the Protagonist after his AI &lt;a href=\"Cliffford\"&gt;Cliffford&lt;/a&gt; realized that mercenaries were going to attack the facility. The group discusses the attack that just took place, with Rackman believing that it was orchestrated by the &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russians&lt;/a&gt;, which Avon concurs, stating that he thinks the person behind it was a man named &lt;a href=\"Bogdan\"&gt;Bogdan&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, Rackman supervises a meeting in the player's facility between herself, Agent 14, &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt;, Avon, and the player. During the meeting, she informs the group about the kidnapping of &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper%20contact\"&gt;one of her agents&lt;/a&gt;, who was investigating data breaches in their department. Although reluctant to do so, she clears Lester and the players to steal whatever necessary for the heist, before leaving. \nWhen &lt;a href=\"The%20Bogdan%20Problem\"&gt;the player is infiltrating&lt;/a&gt; a submarine belonging to Bogdan, Avon reveals that he was the one responsible for the attack on the IAA facility and that Cliffford now has access to the entire &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; defense grid. Rackman meets with Lester, Agent 14, and the player at &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt;'s hangar where, after berating 14 for complaining about his career now being in ruins, she gives Lester the authority to take any actions needed to stop Avon, and reassures him and the player that they will all be paid. After wishing them luck, she and 14 leave.\nAfterwards, Rackman once again meets in the player's facility, although this time only with Lester, the players, and Bogdan, who agreed to help stop Avon. She explains that Agent 14 was kidnapped by &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt;, who plan to sell him to Avon, and that he needs to be rescued, or else the players and Lester will not get paid. She also instructs the players to a &lt;a href=\"Chernobog\"&gt;Chernobog&lt;/a&gt; in order to protect the other kidnapped agent, ULP, while he returns to safety.\n, Rackman talks to the player throughout the mission, frequently emphasizing that Agent 14 must not be killed. Once the player successfully saves 14, Rackman expresses her gratitude for rescuing him without any IAA agent casualties.\nDuring , Rackman oversees the escort of ULP to a safehouse. During the escort, she, Lester, and Bogdan give orders to the player as they use the Chernobog to shoot down enemy helicopters. Upon reaching the safehouse, she informs the player that ULP will be in hiding until Avon is dealt with, as &lt;a href=\"Cliffford%20Mercenaries\"&gt;his men&lt;/a&gt; will be looking for him. Before departing, she addresses ULP by his real name, Bernard, telling him to stay safe.\nLater, Rackman, Lester, and Bogdan oversee the player as they a number of SAM turrets controlled by Avon on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt;. After the players are finished, she and Agent 14 meet them at the &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Sandy Shores Airfield&lt;/a&gt;, where she once again berates 14. She requests a status report from Lester, who explains that he's having trouble tracking down Avon and his AI, &lt;a href=\"Cliffford\"&gt;Cliffford&lt;/a&gt;. Rackman asks why they can't just unplug Cliffford, to which she is informed by Lester that it does not work that way.\nAfter Avon's location was tracked down, Rackman, along with Lester and Agent 14, talk with the &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Scenario\"&gt;player as they assault&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20Launch%20Facility\"&gt;Mount Chiliad Launch Facility&lt;/a&gt;, from which Avon plans to launch a missile. After Avon is killed and the code of Cliffford is destroyed, the player flies to the &lt;a href=\"Galileo%20Observatory\"&gt;Galileo Observatory&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Thruster\"&gt;Thrusters&lt;/a&gt;, to meet with Rackman, 14, and Lester. Lester expresses his excitement, believing that he will get to keep one of the Thrusters, but is told by 14 and Rackman that they are government property and will need them back. At the observatory, once Rackman confirms with Lester that Cliffford is gone, she explains that none of what happened will go on record. She thanks the player and Lester for their hard work and promises that they will be paid. After threatening to fire 14 for his role in letting Avon into the government and reassuring Lester that his money will be sent to him, Rackman and 14 leave.\nPersonality.\nRackman is a senior agent or supervisor in the IAA. She has a no-nonsense attitude and is often seen on her &lt;a href=\"IFruit\"&gt;IFruit&lt;/a&gt; phone giving orders. After their first ever meeting, Lester describes her as clearly the one wearing the trousers in her working relationship with Agent 14."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Imponte\"&gt;Imponte&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\n3D Universe.\nThe Phoenix is based on the / and , but the round tail lights are similar to .\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Phoenix returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" with a near-identical appearance from the 3D Universe, although it takes on a resemblance to the , with elements from . The front bumper and grille shape are derived from the , while the rear fascia and the boot are derived from the , although retaining the spoiler from the Trans Am.\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nThe Phoenix is distinctive by its angled front and flat rear end, sporting rectangular headlights, circular tail light and side trim detail. The vehicle has been changed slightly throughout the games, with a rear deck lid blackout panel in \"GTA San Andreas\", and a thinner stripe in \"GTA Vice City Stories\". The car is distinctive by its hood scoop, where in \"GTA Vice City\" it is fully functional.\nThe car can spawn with single colors or a two-tone paintjob, where the secondary color is applied in the form of a stripe passing through the hood, the roof and the rear.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe vehicle assumes a slightly larger bodywork with a similar shape to the 3D Universe renditions, where the front end has a more vertical profile with a pointy shape around the center. The lower area is predominated by a bulky bumper with a central wide intake and a plastic lower section, while the upper area is predominated by the dual meshed grilles bearing the corresponding badges and the chrome inset housings with circular headlights. The hood slightly curves towards the front and has a small bulge that slightly elevates as it approaches to the windshield, with a decal on the driver-side front displaying its name.\nThe sides of the car are very similar to the 3D Universe model, with flared arches and elevated rear section, along with additional manufacturer badges and the \"Phoenix\" decals on the front fenders. The greenhouse area is relatively short and wide, where the rear section features a curved profile with additional badges next to the door windows. The roof has sectioned panels on it.\nThe rear of the car is similar to the 3D Universe iterations, featuring a slanted rear end with a blacked-out panel identical to the \"GTA San Andreas\" version. A set of circular tail lights with chrome trim and inner reverse/turning lights can be seen on either side, along with a central plate holder. The lower area of the bumper has two small cut-outs for the exhaust tips. On the underside, two exhaust pipes runs across the car and ends in two exhaust silencers, which both splits into two long pipes, resulting in four tail pipes that are seen under the rear bumper. The car prominently spawns with a ducktail spoiler.\nLike its 3D Universe iteration, the car may spawn either with a single body color or with a randomly colored stripe in the middle, where it is determined by the secondary color when modified at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;. The decals displaying its name are also painted with the secondary color. It uses a unique set of wheels consisting of numerous rims crossing at each other, forming various pentagons and triangles around the center.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe Phoenix is acceptably fast, however has great acceleration and torque, offset by having somewhat of a loose rear end. It has a top speed of 200 km/h (230 km/h in \"GTA Vice City Stories\"), faster than other comparable muscle cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Sabre\"&gt;Sabre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clover\"&gt;Clover&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stallion\"&gt;Stallion&lt;/a&gt;, which all share a top speed of 160 km/h. This makes it a great vehicle for drifting with. The Phoenix drives and sounds as if it is powered by a large supercharged engine, and also features a large air scoop for the carburetor. It can also be modified in &lt;a href=\"TransFender\"&gt;TransFender&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA San Andreas\" with nearly all of the available options for customization, but most of the categories have only one option as with most car customization in San Andreas. Like most muscle cars, it has a two person capacity. On the downside, the brakes are not as good as the other sports cars in \"GTA San Andreas\". \nWith the exception of \"GTA San Andreas\", all of the 3D Universe appearances of the Phoenix bear a sports/high end car engine sound rather than the iconic V8 muscle car engine the car is associated with.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Phoenix has a high top speed and decent acceleration. It also has excellent torque and can climb steep hills with ease. Unfortunately, it suffers from poor handling. Its poor weight distribution and light rear end leads to severe oversteer, especially at high speeds. Its back end is prone to fishtailing, and crashes and spin-outs may occur more often than usual in this car. The durability is below-par, and it is prone to frame loss (fenders, bumpers, hoods, etc.) in event of a rollover accident. \nIt highly benefits from customization, as its acceleration can be topped with the right modifications. In essence, the Phoenix is quite similar to the &lt;a href=\"Ruiner\"&gt;Ruiner&lt;/a&gt;, however the Ruiner is generally superior in all areas. Thus, the Phoenix is better suited to more mundane roles, such as cruising at intermediate speeds. Despite this, the Phoenix can still be a competitor in the right hands, especially in races with more straights than corners.\nThe Phoenix is powered by what is stated to be a V8 turbo, somewhat true to its engine model, which is coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. Its engine sound is of a high-performance engine, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Ruiner\"&gt;Ruiner&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt; in that aspect.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Phoenix can only be modified in a &lt;a href=\"TransFender\"&gt;TransFender&lt;/a&gt; garage.\nNOTE: &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Transfender\"&gt;Transfender&lt;/a&gt; will charge 20% more (except for colors)\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Phoenix is an extremely rare car, akin to the &lt;a href=\"Euros\"&gt;Euros&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Berkley%27s%20RC%20Van\"&gt;Berkley's RC Van&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hotknife\"&gt;Hotknife&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "35298", "revid": "5132177", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=35298", "title": "Physics Engine", "text": "A physics engine is an approximate simulation of certain simple physical systems. These includes objects collisions and fluid dynamics.\n3D Universe.\nFrom \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" up to \"\" (excluding \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\"), their physics engines are most likely similar. The engine is probably built in house since &lt;a href=\"Renderware\"&gt;Renderware&lt;/a&gt; was mostly used for models and textures in these \"GTA\" games.\nObject collisions were extremely crude. Dynamic objects and vehicles will obey the perceived laws of physics under normal conditions. They can bounce off other objects and slide against other objects. Dynamic objects will not experience gravity unless affected by the environment. If a dynamic object is placed incorrectly above ground, the object can appear to hover above the ground. The collision models were made not to match the model of the object exactly. This caused many anomalies, including the appearance of going through objects, invisible walls, and the appearance of standing on air. Dynamic objects also have problems when colliding at high speeds. This can cause objects to get stuck within other objects or can cause objects to go through other objects entirely.\nThe physics of the vehicles has improved with each iteration of the games. In \"GTA III\", the engine fully supports the basic physics of four-wheeled land vehicles and a crude support of airborne vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Dodo\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Helicopter%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;police helicopter&lt;/a&gt;. \"GTA Vice City\" introduced support for two-wheeled motor vehicles and a more proper way to support airborne vehicles.\nHD Universe.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" uses the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Advanced%20Game%20Engine\"&gt;Rockstar Advanced Game Engine&lt;/a&gt; (RAGE), which includes a proprietary physics engine, and runs along with the Euphoria animation engine. Improvements to the physics engine has been vast. The engine still suffers from some anomalies experienced in previous games but they have been dramatically reduced.\nMost dynamic objects will experience gravity, even if not acted by the environment. Dynamic objects placed above other dynamic objects will travel in tandem. The water has been dramatically improved. When objects land in water, the water will ripple and create a wave in response.\nThe introduction of Euphoria lets characters be able to interact with the environment in a physically realistic way. Dead characters will conform with the environment instead of laying flat. Characters bailing out of vehicles or falling off a building will bounce off objects.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" also uses the RAGE engine, but this time it has been modified to include new underwater physics along with above water physics similar to that of \"GTA IV\". Other modifications include support for fixed wing aircraft, aircraft turbulence, player health damage in high speed vehicular crashes, and more rigid vehicle bodies that do not deform as easily as those in \"GTA IV\". Another thing that has been slightly modified is character physics. For example, when walking up a slope too steep, a character will stumble and rag doll down the hill."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Cheval\"&gt;Cheval&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Picador is based on the .\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Picador retains the design that combines elements from various model years. The front fascia and side skirts appear to be inspired by the , while the grille shape and headlights are reminiscent of the . The side profile seems to be taken from the , incorporating details such as door handles, mirrors, and bed shape from the . The rear fascia, exhausts, and bonnet bear similarities to the models; however, combining the double hood scoops into a single one, possibly influenced by the . The front bumper intakes and turn signals also resemble those of the 1969 model year, while the front bumper shape is akin to the . The greenhouse area and smaller overall dimensions draw parallels to the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Picador shares a likeness to the &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, the Picador is implied to be a coup\u00e9 utility variant of the Buccaneer, which shares a similar grille and headlight design.\nIt may occasionally be depicted with different items on its bed as two separate extras, the first one being two planks and the second one being several &lt;a href=\"Sprunk\"&gt;Sprunk&lt;/a&gt; cans. The vehicle is seen in a variety of primary colors on the body, as well as secondary colors on the inner bed walls and wheel wells (though this color cannot be changed through a mod shop).\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Picador's design is generally narrower than the \"GTA San Andreas\" iteration, featuring a silver front bumper with a wide vented section holding two square amber signals on the edges and a plate holder on the center. The upper area consist of a grilled section with a wide divider on the middle and the Cheval emblem on the center, along with four circular headlamps on the outer edges. The bonnet has a slightly bulged profile and features a vented section near the windshield.\nThe sides of the vehicle are very simple in design, featuring small flares around the upper sides of the wheel arches and inset/ridged details on the skirting area, as well as horizontal door handles and circular rear-view mirrors near the A-pillars of the cabin. The cabin area is relatively small, featuring silver trimming around the windshield and rear window, while the sides appear to use dual trimming; thinner trim around the window glass and wider around the actual door frame, seen in the small gaps next to the door windows. The area behind the cabin is occupied by a small truck bed with the wheel wells on either side.\nThe rear end of the car mostly consists of the tailgate, which has a black panel with silver upper and lower borders and a plastic middle strip, as well as the Cheval badges on the center. The rear quarters of the vehicle are occupied by square-shaped red marker lamps, which also have silver trimming around. The rear bumper is finished in silver and houses two rectangular brake lamps near the edges and the license plate on the center, while two exhaust tubes can be seen below. In the enhanced version, the car uses the same interior as the &lt;a href=\"Bobcat%20XL\"&gt;Bobcat XL&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle only has a primary color, which is applied on the entire bodywork. It also uses a set of five-spoke rims wrapped in low-profile tires, which is unique in design compared to certain muscle rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops.\nAs of update for the enhanced version of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the vehicle gains visual modifications and the option to apply a secondary color for applicable modifications and a trim color for the paddings of the \"Padded Full Cage\" option.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Picador has the highest top speed and acceleration for any pickup in the game, possibly due to the large V8 diesel engine. However, it is also the lightest and lacks the torque of the stronger trucks; its cornering is also a little unstable, owing to its rear-wheel-drive layout. The Picador can only carry two in the cab.\nThe vehicle uses a low-revving and noisy engine from the &lt;a href=\"Cabbie\"&gt;Cabbie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Intruder\"&gt;Intruder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunrise\"&gt;Sunrise&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vincent\"&gt;Vincent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Willard\"&gt;Willard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yosemite\"&gt;Yosemite&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Picador's speed and acceleration are good in comparison to most street cars, especially when upgraded, but it is heavily outclassed by other muscle cars. Its handling is at odds with more conventional muscle cars, since its four-wheel-drive system gives it excellent traction and launch speed. This, combined with its soft suspension, makes the Picador one of the best muscle cars for offroading, though one must be wary of body roll. Crash deformation is poor and bullet resistance is only average.\nThe Picador is powered by a large displacement V8 and is mated to a 5-speed gearbox, powering all rear wheels with a torque distribution of 40% to the front wheels and 60% to the rear wheels. It shares its engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20Turbo\"&gt;Sabre Turbo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fugitive\"&gt;Fugitive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet\"&gt;Gauntlet&lt;/a&gt;. "}

The package is being guarded by &lt;a href=\"Rednecks%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Rednecks&lt;/a&gt; and is on top of the staircase which leads to the ladder to make it to the highest point of the Cement Works.\nOnce Package #1 has been collected, the team has five real-time minutes to get to the Altruist Camp and collect the package. The package is being guarded by &lt;a href=\"Altruist%20Cult\"&gt;Altruist Cult Members&lt;/a&gt; and is inside the Northwesternmost building in the camp.\nOnce Package #2 has been collected, the team has five real-time minutes to get to Earl's Mini-Mart and collect the package. The package is being guarded by Rednecks and is behind the mini-mart.\nOnce Package #3 has been collected, the team has seven real-time minutes to get to the Fridgit Warehouse and collect the package. The package is being guarded by &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Triads\"&gt;Los Santos Triads&lt;/a&gt; and is inside of a parking garage.\nOnce all packages have been collected, the team has five real-time minutes to get back to Sandy Shores Airfield.

In \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", they are located on the ground, glowing bright red for better visibility.\nTypes of Pickups.\nPower-Ups.\nA Power-Up specifically refers to a pickup that provides a temporary extra ability or effect to the player. An example of this is the &lt;a href=\"Adrenaline\"&gt;Adrenaline&lt;/a&gt; pickups in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\".\nBehavior.\nThere are other features which the player activates by walking into a floating icon, but are not pickups, power-ups or collectibles. These include the &lt;a href=\"Save\"&gt;Save&lt;/a&gt; icon, &lt;a href=\"Assets\"&gt;Assets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rampages\"&gt;Rampages&lt;/a&gt;.\nPickups disappear once the player has collected it by walking into it, unless the player fails to collect the item. The one exception to this is the dollar-sign pickup allowing the player to collect money earned on &lt;a href=\"Assets\"&gt;Assets&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen an armed person is killed by the player, he leaves behind the weapon as pickup for the player, which, excluding \"GTA IV\" and \"GTA V\", floats in mid-air. Money can be collected from NPC killed by the player. The pickup can come in the symbol of \"$\", or stacked-up notes. Money taken from normal NPC is usually not a lot, but collecting from a planned killing in certain missions may leave a huge sum of money, which, in \"GTA Chinatown Wars\" comes in the form of a blue \"$\" symbol. Killing of people who recently visited an ATM in \"GTA IV\" can leave a huge sum of money in one area.\nHealth, armor and police bribes (3D Universe) are scattered throughout the cities in the form of a green cross or red cross, blue or golden armor symbol or a star respectively. They usually respawn at the same location after being collected.\nIn Missions.\nIn certain &lt;a href=\"missions\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt; of a game, the mission may require you to pickup a certain item which has its own pickup symbol not found in normal circumstances. Such include wallets or documents, depending on the mission."}

When arriving, Cesar will hand CJ a &lt;a href=\"sniper%20rifle\"&gt;sniper rifle&lt;/a&gt;.

Eventually, &lt;a href=\"T-Bone%20Mendez\"&gt;T-Bone Mendez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt; will arrive with their escorts to the deal, but, in an unexpected turn, &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno\"&gt;Mike Toreno&lt;/a&gt; arrives in his black &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; helicopter and sees the guards' bodies on the roofs, so he flees. Toreno's flight alerts Mendez and Ryder and a huge gun battle erupts between the Ballas, the San Fierro Rifa and the Mountain Cloud Boys.\nYou will then enter and fight Mendez's goons while defending both Cesar and the Mountain Cloud Boys. Don't jump into the battle right away; continue using the sniper rifle from the roof to pick off any enemy gang members you can see in the street (some will begin running towards your building and will come upstairs and attack if not stopped). When you do decide to head to Pier 69, make sure Cesar follows you (so take the stairs down; don't jump off the front of the building). You do not need to kill everyone to reach T-Bone, and you don't need to run through the middle of Pier 69 which becomes a shooting gallery; simply run along the east side of the pier, by the water, picking off any enemy that jump out at your or shoot at you from between buildings. When you reach the end of the pier where T-Bone is, you can shoot him down, which triggers a cutscene showing both CJ and Cesar shooting T-Bone, whose corpse then falls into the water.\nRyder then tries to make a getaway. He jumps off the Pier and starts swimming towards one of the two &lt;a href=\"Speeder%20%28boat%29\"&gt;Speeder&lt;/a&gt; boats. You must kill him, by either swimming towards the boats and giving chase doing a drive-by or use a gun and kill him from the pier, either way works, though if you use the boat drive-by option you'll get a phone call from Cesar checking up on you.

The lower area of the front end features a small splitter and a central meshed intake, which spans about one-third of the car's width and houses two fog lamps on either side. The bumper covers the front and part of the front quarters of the vehicle, which is finished in chrome and has plastic strips on the outer portions, as well as a set of rectangular indicators on the outer sides. The upper area is surrounded by a chrome trim and features an inset central section for the &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an license plate, two slatted grilles with horizontal separations and four square headlamps, with the inner ones being a bit smaller. The bonnet is relatively long and has two mesh vents near the windscreen.\nOn the sides, the car features slightly flared arches and badges on the rear fenders, displaying the car's name. The doors are also long and are fitted with traditional chrome handles and circular rear-view mirrors. The greenhouse area spans about two-thirds of the car's length and features chrome trim around the windows and inner pillars, with black wide ones separating the door windows and the rear-quarter windows. There is a rear hatch that has an elevated profile on the rearmost section.\nThe rear end of the car bears a central badge just below the hatch that displays the manufacturer name, while a sectioned panel houses the central European license plate and the two red rectangular lamps. The rear bumper has similar features to the front one, having rectangular reverse lights on the outer sides. The lower area has two mouldings for the exhaust tubes. Its interior is shared with cars like the &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork and the interior stitching, while the secondary colour is applied on the lower side of the car. It uses a set of wheels that are identical to the \"Super Fin\" lowrider rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nOverall, the Pigalle is better performing than its initial appearance may imply. It has good acceleration for its class, and Super-level top speeds. It handles well as a result of its high traction levels compared to other Sports Classics, attributed to its reduced engine power and low center of gravity. However, the front wheel drivetrain limits the car's turning circle and overall handing. Understeer is an issue with the Pigalle, but it is not as punishing as other Sports Classics when attempting to carry speed. The braking distance is remarkably good for a Sports Classic. Crash deformation is acceptable.\nThe car is powered by a single-cam V8 engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front wheel, front wheel drive layout. Its engine sound is smooth and low-revving, appearing to be a variation of the one used in the &lt;a href=\"JB%20700\"&gt;JB 700&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stirling%20GT\"&gt;Stirling GT&lt;/a&gt;, without the loud engine tones from the aforementioned cars. If the turbo upgrade is installed on the Pigalle, it will feature compressor surges (creating a fluttering \"whistle\" sound) rather than a blow-off valve (which creates a distinct \"hiss\" sound when letting off the accelerator). This also occurs with the &lt;a href=\"Warrener\"&gt;Warrener&lt;/a&gt;."}

This can make missions such as &lt;a href=\"Firefighter\"&gt;Firefighter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paramedic\"&gt;Paramedic&lt;/a&gt; difficult or impossible in some circumstances as the game thinks the two suburbs are physically located next to each other, and gives the player a very short time span such as 30 seconds or 1 minute to get from one place to the other. Since there are only two roads (not counting a ramp) to the lower section, the player may have to cancel a mission or simply fail it as there isn't enough time to drive down to Wichita Gardens."}

The hospital's logo appears as a heart on a red background, with what appears to be a blood drip coming from it.

The interior consists of a small section of corridor seen from the southern entrance, and a larger section of interior can be seen from the top entrance. An alternative, heavily damaged counterpart of the top floor interior is used during &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Souvenirs%20-%20Al%20Di%20Napoli\"&gt;Vinewood Souvenirs - Al Di Napoli&lt;/a&gt;.

The name \"Pinnacle\" may be a play on \"Maxima\", as both of the names suggest an uppermost extreme.\nPerformance.\nThe Pinnacle is, according to badging, powered by a 3.5L V8 engine (suggested by the cover), which is coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in an front-engine, rear wheel drive layout. The engine pulls strongly, launching the vehicle off the line quickly to 60 mph and giving it a high top speed.

The suspension is firm, but due to its shallow maximum wheel angle, the Pinnacle corners very poorly even at slow speeds.

It also causes less damage on the \u201cedges\u201d of said radius, and targets/vehicles may endure the explosion. The Pipe Bomb also leaves a trail of fire after exploding, which is good for fire traps, although much smaller than that of the &lt;a href=\"Molotov%20Cocktail\"&gt;Molotov Cocktail&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Hawk%20%26amp%3B%20Little\"&gt;Hawk &amp; Little&lt;/a&gt; in and .\nDescription.\nThe Pistol is mainly used at the start of the game as the first weapon the player obtains, or later when the player has run out of ammunition for other firearms. It is a reliable backup weapon, but not one that should be used as a primary, as it is outclassed by many other weapons in damage, fire rate, and overall effectiveness.\nDesign.\nThe pistol frequently varies in design throughout the series, taking the form of many popular handguns.\n2D Universe.\nIn , the Pistol in the &lt;a href=\"HUD\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; image resembles the Soviet , but the in-game sprite (before picking up the weapon) shows a instead, possibly a .\nIn and , the Pistol closely resembles the by the HUD icon.\nIn , due to the game's futuristic setting, the Pistol assumes a generic design with a small barrel, though the model bears some resemblance to the .\n3D Universe.\nIn , and , the pistol is modeled after a . It is stated to be a 9mm handgun, despite the real weapon usually firing .45 ACP rounds (although some 9mm variants exist).\nIn various cutscenes throughout the storylines of \"GTA San Andreas\", the pistol is used instead of the normal M1911. The cutscenes are the following: &lt;a href=\"The%20Introduction\"&gt;The Introduction&lt;/a&gt; short film, &lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Beginning\"&gt;In the Beginning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ryder%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;The Green Sabre&lt;/a&gt; (ending cutscene), &lt;a href=\"First%20Base\"&gt;First Base&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Mike Toreno&lt;/a&gt; (second cutscene), &lt;a href=\"Home%20Coming\"&gt;Home Coming&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;End of the Line&lt;/a&gt; (ending cutscene). Given the fact that the in-game Pistol's magazine capacity (17 rounds) is incorrect for an M1911 but correct for a Glock 17, it may be that the developers originally intended the player to use the model seen in the cutscenes, but this feature was left out for some reason. Note that the M1911 is still used in the cutscenes of the missions &lt;a href=\"Outrider\"&gt;Outrider&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Noon\"&gt;High Noon&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn , the Pistol is a , being one of the most accurately depicted pistols in the \"GTA\" series. However, during the cutscene of &lt;a href=\"Crazy%20%2769%27\"&gt;Crazy '69'&lt;/a&gt;, Ray Machowski carries a silver M1911A1 instead. In the first cutscene of &lt;a href=\"Driving%20Mr%20Leone\"&gt;Driving Mr Leone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore&lt;/a&gt; is holding the same Glock 17 pistol model that appears in several cutscenes in \"GTA San Andreas\".\nIn , the Pistol is modeled after a , a modification of the original Beretta 92. It could be intended to be the nearly identical military version, the Beretta M9, likely to do with the fact that the M9 was the standard issue sidearm for the US military, and the game starts off with the protagonist &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;Victor Vance&lt;/a&gt; serving in the &lt;a href=\"Military%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;U.S. Army&lt;/a&gt;. However, the game is set in 1984; the 92F was produced during this year, but the M9 was introduced in 1985, replacing the Colt M1911 as the standard U.S. Army sidearm. Also, the magazine capacity of 17 rounds is slightly larger than the Beretta's 15 (there are 17-round magazines for the real Beretta, but they were not in existence in 1984). In the cutscenes of the missions &lt;a href=\"Nice%20Package\"&gt;Nice Package&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Mugshot%20Longshot\"&gt;The Mugshot Longshot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Bridges\"&gt;Burning Bridges&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Last%20Stand\"&gt;Last Stand&lt;/a&gt; (ending cutscene), a silver Beretta is used instead of the grey one seen during normal gameplay.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn , the Pistol is an incorrectly textured Glock 17. \"22\" is inscribed on the slide, but there is no locking block pin behind the takedown lever, indicating that it is in fact a Glock 17, not a 22. The in-game 9mm caliber and magazine capacity are also those of a Glock 17. The sights on the model are incorrect; the gun's front sight is a duplicate of the twin-post rear sight.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn , artworks that include the pistol show that it bears some resemblance to the .\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn and , the Pistol is modeled after a (which is based on the Beretta 92 seen in \"Vice City Stories\"). It has a 12-round magazine which would make the magazine closer to that of a PT92C's; 10, 15 and 17-round magazines are standard on the PT92AF. Said weapon's slide seems to be modified to resemble a Colt M1911 in some aspects. In the enhanced version, it appears to have a brown grip instead of black.\nPerformance.\n2D Universe.\nIn its original form in \"Grand Theft Auto\" and \"Grand Theft Auto 2\", the pistol is one of the least effective firearms, firing only one bullet every second or so, at a rate slower than a &lt;a href=\"Machine%20Gun\"&gt;machine gun&lt;/a&gt;.\n3D Universe.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto III\", \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" and \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\", the pistol generally has poor stopping power, average accuracy, and a fairly short range. In \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" and \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\", the weapon is slightly more effective than its previous iterations, having better accuracy, and in \"San Andreas\", capable of one-headshot kill, making it a reliable backup weapon.\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", depending on the weapon skill, some of the weapon's attributes change:\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", the Pistol performs even better. Unlike in previous games, in which the Pistol is soon usurped by other weapons, the Pistol in \"GTA IV\" can be used effectively throughout the entire game. By using cover strategically, being patient, and making the shots count, it is possible to complete most missions in \"GTA IV\" and its episodes with just a Pistol. It can be fired from cars, and its availability, ammo capacity, and higher fire rate make it more desirable for drive-bys and chases than the &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Eagle\"&gt;Combat Pistol&lt;/a&gt;. However, submachine guns are always a better option than pistols if available, mainly because of their fully automatic capability, fire rate, and in some cases higher damage.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", the Pistol performs similarly to the one in \"GTA IV\", but the power, range, and low recoil of the weapon make it significantly more useful despite the pistol holds five less bullets per magazine. This time, it comes with a magazine carrying 12 bullets, though it can be upgraded to 16 bullets with the \"Extended Clip\". As an addition, the rate of fire can be increased by repeatedly tapping the fire button instead of holding it down.\nIn other words, the Pistol can be an excellent all-around weapon for earlier stages of the game, although its efficiency might be lower compared to an &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the mission &lt;a href=\"Complications\"&gt;Complications&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; confronts &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt;, he states it is a 9mm weapon. However, the descriptions at &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt; and on the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games%20Social%20Club\"&gt;Social Club&lt;/a&gt; website claim it is a .45 caliber weapon.\nLocations.\nThe Pistol can be purchased at every gun store, as well as being found in various places listed below. All Police Officers carry this Pistol as their standard service weapon and therefore the player can easily gain control of one if they have not yet unlocked any gun stores or are in need of more ammunition. Street criminals or gang members will also use these and even shoot at the player if provoked.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nGeneral\n&lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Flint%20County\"&gt;Flint County&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nGeneral\n&lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;"}

The pistol is coloured silver and has a long, thin barrel, a rounded trigger and a wooden grip. The pistol is designed to hold eight rounds per magazine.\nPerformance.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nThe Pistol .44 is a very powerful pistol thanks to its ammo type.

However, it has the slowest rate of fire among the \"GTA IVs\" handguns due to its recoil. The weapon is reasonably fast when used as a &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by weapon&lt;/a&gt;, being on par with the Combat Pistol, but its fire rate is still an issue against enemies with fully-automatic weapons.\nJust like the other two pistols in the game, it is also capable of being used for &lt;a href=\"executions\"&gt;executions&lt;/a&gt;."}

The player can buy stocks from them on the &lt;a href=\"Bawsaq.com\"&gt;Bawsaq.com&lt;/a&gt; website in \"GTA V\".\nDescription.\n'Wasser' is German for 'water', implying the beverage's literal name is 'piss water', a slang term for cheap, watered-down beer. According to the in-game website &lt;a href=\"Piswasser.com\"&gt;www.piswasser.com&lt;/a&gt;, the ingredients include \"the fresh urine of Bavarian virgins\" (however, the site goes on to say \"or so we claim\", implying that it might not be as fresh as one would hope). Billboards seen in-game expand the urine references, even going so far as to suggest the bottles contain nothing but urine (perhaps in reference to the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.snopes.com/horrors/food/corona.asp\"&gt;urine in Corona beer&lt;/a&gt; rumor). The beer's slogan and tagline is: \"You're In For A Good Time\" (\"You're In\" being a pun on \"Urine\"). The quality of the beer is reflected by its second slogan: \"Cheap German Lager For Export Only\". The Pi\u00dfwasser badge on bar pumps is labelled \"\u00dc-Rhine\" (and the six-crate of Pi\u00dfwasser that &lt;a href=\"Rockstar\"&gt;Rockstar&lt;/a&gt; sent to UK website CVG Online as a present was labelled in the same way), which is probably a reference to the river in Germany, as well as another pun on \"urine\". Pi\u00dfwasser sponsored &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Space%20Rangers\"&gt;Republican Space Rangers&lt;/a&gt; in 2008.\nRadio and television advertisements for the beer feature variations of a song sung by a stereotypical redneck man with lyrics that portray comically exaggerated effects of alcoholism, including \"[giving] a dude head\" and \"[driving] drunk off a pier\". The Pi\u00dfwasser song largely spoofs 's anthem, \"This is Budweiser, This is Beer\", particularly towards the end of the jingle.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", a Pi\u00dfwasser beer hat becomes available through the &lt;a href=\"Crate%20Drops\"&gt;special crates&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Independence%20Day%20Special\"&gt;Independence Day Special&lt;/a&gt;. It can also be purchased in convenience stores across &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; and can be drunk at safehouses.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto VI&lt;/a&gt;\", Pi\u00dfwasser appears to be sold at &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Jack%27s%20Liquor\"&gt;Uncle Jack's Liquor&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\nThe name and commercial branding of Pi\u00dfwasser is likely based on , however the logo and bottle design itself appears to resemble German beer \"Perlenbacher\". The Pi\u00dfwasser logo uses the \"Delima MT\" typeface.\nThe new Pi\u00dfwasser Ice variant seen in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" is a very clear reference to Bud Ice. It features an almost identical logo and colour schemes.\nThe labels on the bottles are similar to 's labeling.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThere is a small warehouse with Pi\u00dfwasser signage above the door in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nPi\u00dfwasser have a large factory in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;:"}

The stock car may be modified further in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; including the ability to respray the underlying color. The sponsorship decals can not be changed or removed.\nColor distribution is changed, where the primary one is applied on the bodywork and the interior stitching, while the secondary one is applied on the mirror shells. It shares the same wheel design, albeit able to support a dedicated color (which is only possible on naturally-generated examples such as in &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe Pi\u00dfwasser Dominator has the following minor sponsors:\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nLike all of the race version of vehicles within \"GTA V\", the race version sports massively improved performance over the standard Dominator, having much better braking (one of the best of Muscle cars in the game) and improved acceleration, as well as a higher top speed, to such a point it is one of the fastest cars in a straight line. However, the vehicle still suffers from poor traction due to the engine's immense torque. The vehicle's mass is also slightly decreased, compared to the base model.\nAgain, the vehicle is powered by the same V8 engine, sharing the same engine sound as the regular Dominator. In the files, its top speed was increased by 1 km/h / 2 mph in comparison to the regular Dominator."}

Then they take the gold to four modified &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet\"&gt;Gauntlet&lt;/a&gt;s, so they can get out of the city without alerting the police.\nChoosing the subtle method will unlock the following &lt;a href=\"Heist%20Setups\"&gt;setup mission&lt;/a&gt;:\nObvious.\nIn this method, Franklin uses a &lt;a href=\"Cutter\"&gt;Cutter&lt;/a&gt; to reach the Union Depository vault from the underground, so he can steal the gold directly from the vault. Michael will be at the front of the bank, distracting the cops and Trevor uses his &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; the take the gold to the &lt;a href=\"Freight%20Train\"&gt;Train&lt;/a&gt;.\nChoosing the obvious method will unlock the following setup mission:\nCrew.\nThe following characters are available to complete Michael, Trevor and Franklin's crew.\nSubtle.\nGunmen x2.\n\"Note: the first gunman helps Michael and Trevor in the Union Depository and also helps load the Gauntlets with gold, while the second gunman helps hold the guards while they steal the Securicars.\"\nDrivers x2.\n\"Note: the first driver helps load the Gauntlets with gold and drives one of the Gauntlets during the escape, while the second driver helps change the tires of the Securicars when they're stolen and drives one of the trucks that the Gauntlet drivers must load their cars onto.\"\nObvious.\nDrivers x2.\n\"Note: the first driver will be the pilot of the second helicopter, while the second driver will be the driver of the train.\"\nGunmen x2.\n\"Note: the first gunman helps Franklin steal the gold bars from the vault, while the second gunman helps Michael in the streets engaging the police.\"\n\"* The player must first complete the character's stranger task.\"\nFor maximum cash, the best choice is the obvious approach, with Karim Denz and Taliana Martinez as the two drivers; and Daryl Johns and Norm Richards or Hugh Welsh as the two gunman, adding well over $41 million for each character (more if the player chooses the &lt;a href=\"Something%20Sensible\"&gt;A&lt;/a&gt; ending).\nThis is the best choice because all the crew members have the lowest heist cut of their categories, and the obvious approach does not require a hacker, so the protagonists need even less to pay for the crew. Also, choosing the obvious route does not require paying out a $300,000 bribe, and only one vehicle needs to be upgraded, as opposed to three in the subtle approach. It's also important to know that if Karim Denz has no experience, he must be selected as the second driver, to drive the train or he will crash making the crew lose half of the score.\nFor the subtle approach, the best choice would be Rickie Lukens as the hacker, Karim Denz and Taliana Martinez as the two drivers; and Daryl Johns and Packie McReary or Chef as the two gunman. Rickie has the lowest cut of the hackers, so he does not receive too much of the final score. Even if he doesn't have previous experience, he will not cause too much trouble to the crew. Karim and Taliana have very low cuts, and if Karim has no experience he must be selected as the second driver, or else he will lose part of the score. As for the gunmen, Daryl has the lowest cut of all them, so he must be selected as the second gunman, for the first gunman, it must be a good gunman, like Packie or Chef. Even with previous experience, all the available bad gunmen will drop gold while loading the gauntlets, losing part of the final score. \nWith the additional cost of the hacker and the good gunman, plus the bribe of $300,000 for Casey, make the final cut for each of the protagonists only $35 million, not counting the additional expense of upgrading the three Gauntlets."}

In the enhanced version, it uses the same \"Sports Bike\" dial set from motorcycles such as the &lt;a href=\"Akuma\"&gt;Akuma&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bati%20800\"&gt;Bati 801&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe main body of the bike is extensively modified, having a carbon-fibre main frame around the upper area and tubular protective frames around the engine bay, while the fuel tank features a carbon-fibre section between the front section and the circular cap, along with \"PRINCIPE\" lettering on the sides. The engine bay is rather unique, featuring what looks like a large intake/air filter with \"LECTRO KERS\" markings on the sides, the corresponding radiator above and a protruding clutch cover on the right, with a chrome grating over it. There are dual exhaust tubes below the engine bay, behind the front intake.\nThe rear section consist of a painted rear with the carbon-fibre subframe below, having gray seats on top for the occupants, \"LECTRO KERS\" markings on the sides, dual red tail lamps on the rear end and a plate holder below, with the corresponding license plate and turn signals. The rear wheel is connected to the main body by a dual-sided swing-arm finiahed in black, having a carbon-fibre mudguard, single suspension spring and side frames holding the foot pegs for the occupants. Two upswept exhaust tubes are seen on either side of the rear wheel, with carbon-fibre finish near the tips. The chain drive and sprocket can be also seen on the left, the latter being wider than those from regular sports bikes.\nThe most distinctive feature of the Lectro, as explained in the website description, is the (KERS), which is an automotive system for recovering a moving vehicle's otherwise lost kinetic energy under braking and is stored in a reservoir for later use in acceleration. This particular feature is represented by the design of the rear area, where the bike has two wires coming from the rear wheel and runs through the left side of the swing-arm. On the swing-arm pivot, the wires lead up to a hyper cell battery located behind the engine bay and is connected to a direct-drive brush-less motor. This motor receives the stored power of the cell battery and transmits it to the rear wheel via an outer secondary chain drive on the left, located just beside the inner primary chain drive. In the enhanced version, the chains are fully animated.\nThe bike is painted with a primary colour applied on the front fairing, mirror wings, fuel tank, lower intake and rear section, as well as with a secondary colour on the tubular frames. It uses split six-spoke rims similar to the \"Speedway\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and fitted with medium-profile tyres, with the rear one being wider.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Lectro is a fairly average performing motorcycle. Its top speed and acceleration are more similar to the &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;, being decent but nothing worth noting. Players can use the KERS boost by pressing the left stick to gain a boost, which can be refilled by letting go of the accelerator.\nWhen using the KERS boost, the Lectro is able to keep up, albeit shortly, to the &lt;a href=\"Akuma\"&gt;Akuma&lt;/a&gt;. However, with only a couple seconds of KERS use before it is used up, the Lectro will begin lagging behind as soon as the KERS is used up.

Devin proceeds to explain that, being one of the two shareholders (the other being Solomon Richards' \"idiot\"\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ira%20Richards\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt;) in &lt;a href=\"Richards%20Majestic%20Productions\"&gt;Richards Majestic Productions&lt;/a&gt;, he plans to pull the plug on their latest movie in order to receive a massive insurance payout. With that money, he will pay off Solomon's son to agree to tear the film lot down in order for Devin to build condos, tax free and possible rebates. Solomon tries to protect the movie reel, but Molly forcibly snatches the film from his arms. Refusing to surrender his first film, Michael storms out of Solomon's office and pursues Molly, who is taking the movie reel (&lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28film%29\"&gt;Meltdown&lt;/a&gt;) to an unknown discreet offshore location by &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;plane&lt;/a&gt;. \nBy the time Michael arrives at\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, Molly has received a police escort team paid for by Weston. Michael pursues Molly on the airport runways, causing huge amounts of mayhem along the way and indirectly killing many officers. Eventually the police order Molly to pull over, but they are ignored until Molly stops at Devin Weston's hangar backdoor, where a &lt;a href=\"Jet\"&gt;Jet&lt;/a&gt; is waiting for her to board with the film. Molly, who is aware of Michael pursuing her, but mistakenly assumes he is trying to kill her, runs into the hangar in a panic, where she is sucked into the jet engine, dropping the film. Michael collects the film and must lose his three-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, since the cops are now pursuing him for entering a restricted area. Michael successfully escapes from the police, concluding the mission.\nIn a post-mission phone call with Solomon, Michael learns that there were backups of the film due to it being shot digitally, making the chase, Devin's plans and Molly's death all for naught. However, he is soon cheered up by Solomon announcing that \"Meltdown\" will have a full-fledged Vinewood premiere, with his family guaranteed seats there.\nDespite Solomon saying that the invitations are on their way, &lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;The Bureau Raid&lt;/a&gt; and its immediate follow-up missions must be completed before the &lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;premiere&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath.\nWeazel News (Radio).\n\"\"Terror at the airport.\" \"A frightening scene at Los Santos International; reports say there are multiple causalities and millions of dollars of damage.

Salvatore agrees to invest money into the casino, along with the Forelli Family, leading to the three families each owning a third of the casino. However, the Sindacco Family are forced to remove &lt;a href=\"Mickey%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;Mickey&lt;/a&gt;, their man running the casino, and replace him with someone the three families can control but who will remain neutral.\nIn Vice City, the Vercetti Gang remain a strong force, although Ken Rosenberg's continued drug use leads to him being disbarred from being a lawyer and entering rehab in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Carson\"&gt;Fort Carson&lt;/a&gt;. After leaving rehab he phones Tommy Vercetti, but Vercetti has cut all ties with him, leading to him losing contact with Vercetti.&lt;ref name=\"Rosenberg/Vercetti\"&gt;Ken Rosenberg: \"Ah, yes.

This, along with Salvatore's insistence that he wants his money back quickly, put Ken into a difficult position. He has only one friend, a parrott called &lt;a href=\"Tony\"&gt;Tony&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href=\"Kent%20Paul\"&gt;Kent Paul&lt;/a&gt;, a friend from Vice City, finds Rosenberg along with his new musician &lt;a href=\"Maccer\"&gt;Maccer&lt;/a&gt; and ally &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;.

Carl has now gained Salvatore's trust, in part as he had worked with his son &lt;a href=\"Joey%20Leone\"&gt;Joey Leone&lt;/a&gt; and in part because of the jobs Carl has done. However, &lt;a href=\"Breaking%20the%20Bank%20at%20Caligula%27s\"&gt;Carl and the San Fierro Triads pull off a heist at the casino&lt;/a&gt;, leading to a big money loss for all three families.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\n1992-1998.\nSometime in 1994 Don Leone sent out Toni Cipriani to kill an unnamed made man from either the Sindaccos or Forellis. Toni murders the man and \"lays low\" for 4 years until 1998.\n1998.\nOn October 30, 1998, &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt; came back to &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; to find out that &lt;a href=\"Vincenzo%20Cilli\"&gt;Vincenzo Cilli&lt;/a&gt; had taken over his position in the family. Now back at the bottom of the ladder, Toni finds himself working for Vincenzo, doing many favours for him such as &lt;a href=\"Slacker\"&gt;picking up a drug dealer working for him and dropping him off at Chinatown to deal drugs there&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dealing%20Revenge\"&gt;killing members of the Sindacco family who were dealing on Leone turf&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Smash%20and%20Grab\"&gt;picking up members of Vincenzo's crew after they botched a gas station stickup and evading the police&lt;/a&gt;. After Toni was &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Wheels%20%28GTA%20Liberty%20City%20Stories%29\"&gt;ambushed by the police for picking up a car with cocaine stored in the trunk&lt;/a&gt; as a favour for Vincenzo, Toni severed his ties with him and instead started working for &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Daniel%20O%27Toole\"&gt;JD O'Toole&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Sindacco&lt;/a&gt; barman who had turned against &lt;a href=\"Paulie%20Sindacco\"&gt;Paulie Sindacco&lt;/a&gt; in his bid to become a member of the Leone family, performing jobs for him such as &lt;a href=\"Don%20in%2060%20Seconds\"&gt;rescuing Salvatore from Paulie's Revue Bar before the LCPD arrested him&lt;/a&gt;. After proving himself in the war against the &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Sindaccos&lt;/a&gt;, Toni was contacted by &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore&lt;/a&gt;, who had more work for him, and at the same time &lt;a href=\"Mrs.%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni's mother&lt;/a&gt; demanded that Toni visit her. Toni started working for both of them, performing jobs for Salvatore such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Offer\"&gt;delivering a bribe to a union boss at the docks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ho%20Selecta%21\"&gt;plying the dockworkers with prostitutes to gain their support&lt;/a&gt;, and performing jobs for his mother such as &lt;a href=\"Big%20Rumble%20in%20Little%20China\"&gt;murdering several Triads to prove his bravery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Meat\"&gt;murdering Giovanni Casa for not paying his mother protection money&lt;/a&gt;.

Toni later started working for Salvatore's wife &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Latore\"&gt;Maria Latore&lt;/a&gt;, getting him in trouble as &lt;a href=\"Shop%20%27til%20You%20Strop\"&gt;she shoplifted&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taken%20for%20a%20Ride\"&gt;almost got kidnapped by the Sindaccos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Booby%20Prize\"&gt;putting herself up as 1st place prize gift in a street race&lt;/a&gt;, getting beaten up by the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Bikers\"&gt;Liberty City Bikers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cedric%20Fotheringay\"&gt;leader&lt;/a&gt; (who Toni &lt;a href=\"Biker%20Heat\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"Overdose%20of%20Trouble\"&gt;almost overdosing&lt;/a&gt;. Toni starts working for JD again where he &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%27s%20Salvation\"&gt;saves Salvatore's life&lt;/a&gt; and the Leone get into a &lt;a href=\"The%20Guns%20of%20Leone\"&gt;gang war&lt;/a&gt; with the Sindaccos, but that's not all, The &lt;a href=\"Sicilian%20Mafia\"&gt;Sicilian Mafia&lt;/a&gt; were paying the local gangs to start a mob war between the Leones, Sindaccos, and Forelli Families, led by Salvatore's Uncle &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Leone\"&gt;Uncle Leone&lt;/a&gt;. This leads to a lot of attacks forcing the 3 families to leave &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;."}

Having failed to secure &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt; as Mayor of Liberty City, they begin to control new Mayor &lt;a href=\"Miles%20O%27Donovan\"&gt;Miles O'Donovan&lt;/a&gt; after rescuing him from the Sicilian Mafia.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Advance\".\nThe Leones appear in \"Grand Theft Auto Advance\", ambiguously referred to as \"The Mafia\". \nAs seen during the events of the game, they still have full control of the &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Harbor\"&gt;Portland Harbor&lt;/a&gt; and still use the docks for smuggling in the year &lt;a href=\"2000\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;. Two small-time associates of the Mafia, &lt;a href=\"Vinnie\"&gt;Vinnie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mike\"&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt;, are \"errand boys\" for the Mafia, receiving orders from Mafia members at &lt;a href=\"Momma%27s%20Restaurante\"&gt;Momma's Restaurante&lt;/a&gt;. The two other families are absent and are never mentioned, as by this point, the Sindaccos are wiped out from Liberty City and the Forellis are severely weakened.\nIn the early missions, Mike (under orders of Vinnie) is sent by the Mafia to collect money from the Southside Hoods who don't want to pay them. At first reluctant, Mike does so and becomes an enemy of the Hoods.\nLater in the storyline, Yakuza co-leader &lt;a href=\"Asuka%20Kasen\"&gt;Asuka Kasen&lt;/a&gt; employs &lt;a href=\"Mike\"&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; to extract revenge on the Mafia using a &lt;a href=\"Katana\"&gt;Katana&lt;/a&gt;, a Kasen family heirloom implied to be the same one taken from her late brother Kazuki. She has Mike kidnap at least fifteen Leone Family gang members, with the intention of trafficking them to Asia for use as servants. The Mafia eventually attempt to ambush Asuka in &lt;a href=\"Wichita%20Gardens\"&gt;Wichita Gardens&lt;/a&gt; during the mission &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Joint\"&gt;Assault Joint&lt;/a&gt;, but she flees the scene in time. Mike kills the Mafia hitmen shortly before defeating &lt;a href=\"King%20Courtney\"&gt;King Courtney&lt;/a&gt; and the Uptown Yardies, and leaving Liberty City.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nBy &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt; the Leone family have lost some power in the city, although they remain one of the strongest crime syndicates in the city. Most of the territory they had gained in Chinatown is lost to the Triads whilst the Diablos have taken control of Hepburn Heights, as &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Sabotage\"&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; by Toni Cipriani in 1998. This leads to shootouts between the Leones and the Triads around the Red Light District and Chinatown. The &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;Colombian Cartel&lt;/a&gt; have also been undermining the Leone family, selling &lt;a href=\"SPANK\"&gt;SPANK&lt;/a&gt; from the factory on freighter in &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Harbor\"&gt;Portland Harbor&lt;/a&gt; and through noodle stands. This sparks major hostilities in and around Trenton, the business place of Salvatore's son &lt;a href=\"Joey%20Leone\"&gt;Joey&lt;/a&gt;, and also around Portland Harbor. The Leone Family first launch a full-scale war against the Triads. This leads to the death of three Triad warlords and the destruction of the Triads' &lt;a href=\"Turtle%20Head%20Fishing%20Company\"&gt;Fish Factory&lt;/a&gt;. The Cartel too are weakened with the destruction of their freighter in Portland Harbor. Whilst neither conflict with the Triads or Cartel is resolved, both appear to be going in the Leone's favour.\nHowever, Salvatore's paranoia sets in when his wife, &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Latore\"&gt;Maria Latore&lt;/a&gt;, inadvertently claims she is having an affair with Leone associate &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt;. Salvatore &lt;a href=\"Last%20Requests\"&gt;rigs&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; with a bomb in an attempt to kill Claude, but Maria manages to warn Claude of this plot. The two meet at a small jetty with the co-leader of the Yakuza, &lt;a href=\"Asuka%20Kasen\"&gt;Asuka Kasen&lt;/a&gt;, who has Claude &lt;a href=\"Sayonara%20Salvatore\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; Salvatore to prove that he has severed all ties with the Leone Family. Following this, the Leones will shoot at Claude on sight if he is spotted in their territory. It is unknown who becomes Leone Don following Salvatore's death.\nTraits.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and ', Leone henchmen wear black suits, some with sunglasses. In ', the mobsters (presumed to be the Leone Family) dress in either brown leather jackets with gray pants, light blue shirts with chains or in black jogging suits.\nThe official gang car of the Leone family is the &lt;a href=\"Mafia%20Sentinel\"&gt;Mafia Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, a modified jet black (gray in \"GTA III\") version of the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; which is supercharged only in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\". However, there are also uniquely jet black versions of other cars either used by the Leone family or located near their property in both \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Liberty City Stories\". These include a &lt;a href=\"Rumpo\"&gt;Rumpo&lt;/a&gt; used by the Leones in the original PS2 version of &lt;a href=\"Under%20Surveillance/PS2%20Version\"&gt;Under Surveillance&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt; owned by Salvatore Leone in &lt;a href=\"The%20Trouble%20With%20Triads\"&gt;The Trouble With Triads&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Pony\"&gt;Pony&lt;/a&gt; used by Toni Cipriani in &lt;a href=\"Taking%20the%20Peace\"&gt;Taking the Peace&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt; used by former Capo &lt;a href=\"Vincenzo%20Cilli\"&gt;Vincenzo Cilli&lt;/a&gt; and parked outside his house, and a &lt;a href=\"PCJ-600\"&gt;PCJ-600&lt;/a&gt; parked outside Salvatore Leone's mansion.\nTheir favorite radio station\u00a0is &lt;a href=\"Double%20Clef%20FM\"&gt;Double Clef FM&lt;/a&gt;. This radio station is also favored by the city's other Mafia families (and the Leones' biggest enemies), the Forellis and the Sindaccos. In \"GTA III\", they might sometimes listen to &lt;a href=\"Flashback%20FM\"&gt;Flashback FM&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Mafia are very dangerous once hostile, capable of making quick work of vehicles if the player drives within range of their shotguns."}

Her father, Harold, was a &lt;a href=\"Chickens\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt; farmer and her mother, Ellen, was a slopper at a dairy farm. She suffered lung problems due to heavy smoking during childhood. At school, Leonora was an unremarkable student, but hit puberty at an early age, and attracted a lot of attention from other students and the school faculty.\nAt &lt;a href=\"1967\"&gt;fifteen years old&lt;/a&gt;, Leonora dropped out of high school and travelled to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; by hitchhiking to escape from her uncle and dreamt to become either a movie star or a model. After working as a waitress for several months, her natural beauty and childlike naivete caught the eye of the entertainment industry, and Leonora became a common face on the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; party circuit and casting-couch circuit.\nMovie Career.\nBy the early 1970s, Leonora was getting regular work as a model in print ads, television commercials and minor acting roles on movies. In &lt;a href=\"1973\"&gt;1973&lt;/a&gt;, she got cast in &lt;a href=\"Richards%20Majestic%20Productions\"&gt;Richards Majestic Productions&lt;/a&gt;' film \"&lt;a href=\"Rum%20Runner\"&gt;Rum Runner&lt;/a&gt;\" in which she played Beryl, a wise-cracking disabled &lt;a href=\"prostitute\"&gt;prostitute&lt;/a&gt; and stole every scene she was in. However, she was described by the media as \"a pretty face to watch without perhaps much spark in the eyes\", implying although she was beautiful-looking, she probably wasn't very intelligent. It was also rumored that she was considered for the female lead role in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Many%20Wives%20of%20Alfredo%20Smith\"&gt;The Many Wives of Alfredo Smith&lt;/a&gt;.\" However, she was abducted, tortured, raped and murdered by &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Dreyfuss\"&gt;Peter Dreyfuss&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1975\"&gt;1975&lt;/a&gt;.\nMurder.\nDreyfuss mutilated Leonara by cutting off both her hands and feet and placed them in opposite areas, cutting off several facial features, leaving multiple incisions on her breasts, drawing a star on her back with cigar burns, slicing off a portion of her thigh and writing \"ham\" on it while also raping her. As she begged to be free, Dreyfuss kept on, and she kept screaming. When Dreyfuss told her to be quiet, she refused, so he killed her. He then cleared up all the evidence and the tracks so he wouldn't be caught.\nOn January 17th, 1975, following an anonymous tip-off to the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt;, her body was found by the side of the &lt;a href=\"Land%20Act%20Dam\"&gt;Land Act Dam&lt;/a&gt; by reporters hours before the LSPD showed up, with the reporters trampling over all usable forensic evidence. The LSPD couldn't find any form of evidence to figure out who killed Johnson, so the case was closed shortly afterwards.\nAfter Leonora's death, Dreyfuss taunted her family for years by sending letters, making anonymous phone calls, and sending Leonora's locket and her severed lips on the anniversary of the murder. According to some other rumors/reports, he had also stalked her for years before finally abducting and raping her, though this was not confirmed by himself.\nMore information about Johnson's murder can be found on the in-game &lt;a href=\"Websites%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"WhokilledLeonoraJohnson.com\"&gt;www.whokilledLeonoraJohnson.com&lt;/a&gt;. According to this site, a pornographic take of her murder, \"Lay Enormous Johnson,\" was produced in &lt;a href=\"1984\"&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt;. Leonora was portrayed by Jessica Barlow, a woman who claimed to have been \"Leonora's best friend at high school,\" although Leonora's parents had no idea who she was.\nThe story was also featured in an episode of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Underbelly%20Of%20Paradise\"&gt;The Underbelly Of Paradise&lt;/a&gt;\".\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThere is a series of 50 &lt;a href=\"Letter%20Scraps\"&gt;scraps&lt;/a&gt; of a torn-up letter that Peter had sent to a friend, &lt;a href=\"David%20Richards\"&gt;David Richards&lt;/a&gt;, in 1975, shortly after Leonora's murder, confessing his crime and justifying his actions artistically. After finding all the letter scraps, the player will see the entire letter, and then the \"Strangers and Freaks\" mission &lt;a href=\"A%20Starlet%20in%20Vinewood\"&gt;A Starlet in Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; will be unlocked for &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt;, in which he confronts Dreyfuss about the murder, and vigilante justice against Dreyfuss is optional.\nCharacter.\nInfluence.\nLeonora Johnson's murder shares similarities to the .\nSome details of Leonora Johnson's murder are perhaps a reference to the death/murder of Kay Amin, the former wife of Ugandan ex-President, .

After the missions wait a few minutes and the market will change (the stock market will change every 30 seconds), so be patient and wait for the stock to reach maximum before selling, it depends on the mission/stock market, but it's not uncommon to go beyond 50% increase (150% for Bus Assassination), but most of the times it will level out at around 80%.\nThe assassination missions \"are\" required for &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;100% completion&lt;/a&gt; but may be done after the main storyline ends (the only exception being &lt;a href=\"The%20Hotel%20Assassination\"&gt;The Hotel Assassination&lt;/a&gt; which is part of the storyline as it provides Franklin with a new &lt;a href=\"3671%20Whispymound%20Drive\"&gt;safehouse&lt;/a&gt;). Players wishing to maximize the amount of money made by the characters may therefore wish to wait until \"after\" the main storyline ends before engaging in these missions, and particularly after receiving the cut from &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;The Big Score&lt;/a&gt; which pays out after completing &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;The Third Way&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Something%20Sensible\"&gt;Something Sensible&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"The%20Time%27s%20Come\"&gt;The Time's Come&lt;/a&gt;.\nLester will give Franklin a hint to what is going to happen after the assassination, the missions are often a personal matter for Lester, but most of the times it is just for personal gain. He will advise which stocks to buy and when.\nBenefits.\nThe player can use the stock market profits from these missions to buy the more expensive properties/businesses such as the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Golf%20Club\"&gt;Los Santos Golf Club&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cinema%20Doppler\"&gt;or any&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ten%20Cent%20Theater\"&gt;of the three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tivoli%20Cinema\"&gt;cinemas&lt;/a&gt; available for &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; that would otherwise be unaffordable. It is advised to do all of them (excluding The Hotel Assassination) after &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;The Big Score&lt;/a&gt; to ensure a maximum payout from larger stock investments. \nMissions.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Hotel%20Assassination\"&gt;The Hotel Assassination&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the introductory assassination, Lester explains his stock market manipulation to Franklin.

The player can now wait for the car to pass and blow it up, which will result in a wanted level, or they can snipe him and drive off quickly to avoid attention. The mission passes and the player is rewarded with $3000. No wanted level will give the player a $2000 bonus.\nThis mission is not required to progress the storyline.\nStock Tip.\n\"Note: save the game in a different slot before doing this mission, so you can reload in case anything goes wrong.\"\nUse all the cash earned from the previous assassination mission, the player should now have more than $700,000,000.

He is hiding at a &lt;a href=\"Mile%20High%20Club\"&gt;construction site&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pillbox%20Hill\"&gt;Pillbox Hill&lt;/a&gt; under armed guard due to Lester's informant letting him know what was coming. Franklin shoots through and arrives at the roof. He then shoots down Bonelli's chopper and skydives to the ground. Upon calling Lester, he is told there is too much heat and that they are going to let the dust settle. Franklin is rewarded with $10,000.\nThis mission is not required to progress the storyline.\nStock Tip.\n\"Note: save the game in a different slot before doing this mission, so you can reload in case anything goes wrong.\"\nUse all the cash earned from the previous assassination mission, the player should now have more than $2,100,000,000. Now the player is free to spend the money.\nMaximum Income.\nBecause &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt; uses a 32-bit signed integer in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", the maximum income the player can earn from the Assassination Missions is limited to $2,147,483,648. After reaching this amount of cash, the game will start to glitch and will not pass this number. Players can work around the 32-bit signed integer limit by investing some cash in the high value stock (e.g. Ammu-Nation) and re-selling to top up their bank account back up to the limit each time they spend any cash.\nPatch.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"Grand_Theft_Auto_V/Title_Update_Notes/Update-2015-10-20\"&gt;Title Update 1.14 on 10-20-2015&lt;/a&gt;, return percentages are reduced, presumably to prevent players exceeding the integer limit which was known to be causing unexpected behaviour or errors.\nUpdated returns (examples).\nThe following table lays out potential stock returns for each assassination as tested after the 1.14 update."}

There are multiple satellite dishes and antennae on the roof. The house is surrounded by chain-link fences with additional razor wire protection in some areas above the garage. There are two cables (one red, one blue) leading from a high voltage cabinet around the back to the front room window. The windows are all barred.\nThe walls of the house and yard are adorned with various warning signs. There are five external CCTV cameras attached to the house, connected to monitors located inside the house. An intercom can be found to the left of the front door. A couple of garden gnomes are outside the front door and there are two more in the back yard.\nAmong the warning signs there is a wooden sign saying 'Beware of Dog', and the sound of a dog barking can be heard. It appears to be a recording though, as no dog can be seen and the same sound repeats endlessly. The source of the sound appears to be two speakers attached to the wall of the house (one to the left of the front door and one at the western side of the house).\nInterior.\nThe interior is inaccessible outside of missions:\nThe interior is full of file boxes, computers, and surveillance equipment. Inaccessible doors are located to the left and right of the main entrance. All the doorways are wider than usual to accommodate Lester's wheelchair. From the entrance hallway, the main living space is to the northwest. On the right, there is a bed with a large screen TV at its foot and a red easy chair. All windows and other sources of natural light are covered with either blankets, wooden boards or newspaper clippings taped together. The rest of the accessible space is dominated by desks and shelving containing the computers and surveillance equipment. A small green sofa is located in the far corner."}

As an act of revenge, he hacked their systems, a fact that Lester claims \"never gets old\". \nAt an unknown point in time, Lester moved out to the Midwest, where he met and became affiliated with bank robbers &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael Townley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;, and became a regular member of their heist crews since the start of their partnership, working mostly as a planner and information scout. During this time, Lester likely told both of them about the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Depository\"&gt;Union Depository&lt;/a&gt;, a superbank in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; where the government keeps their gold reserve, leading to the three of them to come up with potential schemes on how to rob the place. In &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, Lester refused to participate in &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;robbing&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Bobcat%20Security%20Depot\"&gt;cash storage facility&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ludendorff\"&gt;Ludendorff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20North%20Yankton\"&gt;North Yankton&lt;/a&gt;, believing it was a bad idea. His suspicions are later confirmed when he discovers that, during this same heist, Michael was apparently gunned down and another associate, &lt;a href=\"Brad%20Snider\"&gt;Brad&lt;/a&gt;, was subsequently arrested.\nFollowing the botched heist, Lester moved to Los Santos and purchased a &lt;a href=\"Darnell%20Bros.\"&gt;garment factory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"La%20Mesa\"&gt;La Mesa&lt;/a&gt;, along with several &lt;a href=\"Lester%27s%20Safehouse\"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lester%27s%20Warehouse\"&gt;properties&lt;/a&gt; to use as fronts for his various operations. During this time, Lester investigated the &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;Ludendorff heist&lt;/a&gt; and learned that Michael was alive but had faked his death and moved to Los Santos as well, having previously made a deal with &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Norton\"&gt;Dave Norton&lt;/a&gt;. However, as Michael never revealed that Lester was part of the crew, Lester in turn never revealed Michael's secret. Lester also lost contact with Trevor, but secretly kept tabs on his and Michael's whereabouts.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" in 2013.\nMeeting the player.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; is introduced to Lester in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" upon reaching &lt;a href=\"rank\"&gt;rank&lt;/a&gt; 10; Lester phones them and asks to meet up at &lt;a href=\"Lester%27s%20House\"&gt;his house&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"El%20Burro%20Heights\"&gt;El Burro Heights&lt;/a&gt;. When the pair meet, he informs the player of their growing reputation and suggests that they invest their money in real estate in order to protect it from being robbed. Before the player leaves, Lester tells them they are able to put a &lt;a href=\"Bounties\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; on other players by simply calling him. If the player sets a bounty on another player, Lester will take a cut of &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;1,000.\nFrom version &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto_V/Title%20Update%20Notes/Update-2014-07-01\"&gt;1.15&lt;/a&gt;, the player could receive messages from Lester, who required a &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Kill_Target\"&gt;target be eliminated&lt;/a&gt; for easy cash. These jobs were removed from version &lt;a href=\"Grand_Theft_Auto%20V/Title%20Update%20Notes/Update-2015-09-15\"&gt;1.29&lt;/a&gt; but remained playable on the original versions until their access to \"GTA Online\" was shut down in December 2021.\nContact Missions.\nAs the player increases their rank and reputation, Lester provides more jobs, mostly stealing vehicles or other items, retrieving people of interest, or decreasing the capacity of the law enforcement in Los Santos. For most of these missions, Lester uses his &lt;a href=\"Lester%27s%20Warehouse\"&gt;warehouse&lt;/a&gt; as a pick-up or drop-off point.\nLester seems to have a distaste for &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt; and is disgruntled by its increasing scale of domestic operations. Because of his negative feelings and also for opportunistic reasons, he instructs the player to steal &lt;a href=\"A%20Titan%20of%20a%20Job\"&gt;a Titan plane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"By%20Land%2C%20Sea%20and%20Air\"&gt;two Buzzard Attack Choppers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Teaser%20Trailer\"&gt;a secretly-developed electromagnetic weapon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Docks%20to%20Stock\"&gt;a container full of weapons&lt;/a&gt; from them, to be used for his other, undisclosed projects.\nHeists.\nLester sends a text message to the player, asking to meet him in his factory, to talk about an opportunity. Lester then introduces the player to the online &lt;a href=\"Heist\"&gt;Heist&lt;/a&gt;s. He and &lt;a href=\"Paige%20Harris\"&gt;Paige Harris&lt;/a&gt; help the player in the execution of a &lt;a href=\"Fleeca%20Job\"&gt;heist&lt;/a&gt;, targeting a safety deposit box at the &lt;a href=\"Chumash\"&gt;Chumash&lt;/a&gt; branch of &lt;a href=\"Fleeca\"&gt;Fleeca&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfterwards, he refers the players to &lt;a href=\"Prison%20Break\"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Raid\"&gt;heists&lt;/a&gt; he wants &lt;a href=\"Series%20A\"&gt;no part in&lt;/a&gt;, but still takes a finder's fee for the referral. Finally, Lester leads the player on a &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Standard\"&gt;final heist&lt;/a&gt;, where they rob the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Standard%20Public%20Depository%20Bank\"&gt;Pacific Standard Public Depository Bank&lt;/a&gt;.\nLester also would request the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist to &lt;a href=\"Distract%20Cops\"&gt;distract the cops&lt;/a&gt; occasionally to allow his contact to safely escape. The feature was removed from the in the Freemode Events Update and remained exclusive to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 editions until they were shut down.\nBikers.\nLester, under the nickname \"Long John Teabag\" and using a voice changer, helps the player set up and run illegal business for their &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Club&lt;/a&gt;, using &lt;a href=\"The%20Open%20Road\"&gt;The Open Road&lt;/a&gt;, a network server run by him.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nLester and Michael reunite after nearly a decade when Michael finds himself in need of money after unintentionally angering &lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Cartel\"&gt;Cartel&lt;/a&gt; boss &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin Madrazo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20Counseling\"&gt;by pulling his mistress' house down a hill&lt;/a&gt;, believing it to be the home of &lt;a href=\"Kyle%20Chavis\"&gt;Kyle Chavis&lt;/a&gt;, a tennis coach who'd slept with &lt;a href=\"Amanda%20De%20Santa\"&gt;his wife&lt;/a&gt;. Lester agrees to help, but only after Michael assassinates &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader\"&gt;Lifeinvader&lt;/a&gt; CEO &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Norris\"&gt;Jay Norris&lt;/a&gt;, who Lester had long since became enraged with due to Norris' use of child labor and the \"messiah complex\" he developed. Lester also planned to make a profit by buying Lifeinvader shares at minimal price, only to sell them at inflated ones later, after Norris' death. Once the &lt;a href=\"Friend%20Request\"&gt;assassination&lt;/a&gt; is completed, Lester helps Michael, and his new associate &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, pull off a &lt;a href=\"The%20Jewel%20Store%20Job\"&gt;robbery&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Vangelico\"&gt;Vangelico&lt;/a&gt; jewel store in &lt;a href=\"Portola%20Drive\"&gt;Portola Drive&lt;/a&gt;, which covers the cost of the repairs to Madrazo's &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo%27s%20house\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater in the game, Lester hires Franklin several times to &lt;a href=\"Lester%27s%20Assassinations\"&gt;pull off other similar assassinations&lt;/a&gt; in order to amass a fortune in the stock market. Lester buys up large amounts of stock in the rival companies of his targets when their share prices are low, so that their share prices will rise significantly following the assassinations and Lester can sell his shares at a profit. Other victims include &lt;a href=\"Brett%20Lowrey\"&gt;Brett Lowrey&lt;/a&gt;, the CEO of &lt;a href=\"Bilkinton%20Research\"&gt;Bilkinton Research&lt;/a&gt; who had recently come under fire for manufacturing faulty erectile dysfunction medication; four corrupt jurors who planned to throw out a lawsuit against &lt;a href=\"Redwood%20Cigarettes\"&gt;Redwood Cigarettes&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Jackson%20Skinner\"&gt;Jackson Skinner&lt;/a&gt;, the Head of Product Development at &lt;a href=\"Facade\"&gt;Facade&lt;/a&gt; at the center of a data mining scandal; &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Penny\"&gt;Isaac Penny&lt;/a&gt;, a venture capitalist who planned to acquire a majority share of &lt;a href=\"Vapid\"&gt;Vapid Motor Company&lt;/a&gt; simply to outsource most of the jobs; and &lt;a href=\"Enzo%20Bonelli\"&gt;Enzo Bonelli&lt;/a&gt;, a mobster turned real estate developer who blackmailed his way into several construction contracts for Los Santos.\nLester reunites with Trevor after the latter &lt;a href=\"The%20Merryweather%20Heist\"&gt;stole an unknown superweapon&lt;/a&gt; from a private security company named &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt;, and convinces him to return it in order to not get hunted down by many major national governments. Additionally, he helps the protagonists &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Score%20Setup\"&gt;plan out&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Paleto%20Score\"&gt;a robbery on a County Bank&lt;/a&gt; to finance an FIB &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20Business\"&gt;operation&lt;/a&gt;, helps Franklin &lt;a href=\"Fresh%20Meat%20%28mission%29\"&gt;rescue&lt;/a&gt; Michael after he's &lt;a href=\"Bury%20the%20Hatchet\"&gt;captured&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Wei%20Cheng\"&gt;Wei Cheng&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Triads\"&gt;triad&lt;/a&gt; due to his connection with Trevor, &lt;a href=\"Cleaning%20out%20the%20Bureau\"&gt;helps&lt;/a&gt; Michael and Franklin carry out a &lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;break-in&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Headquarters\"&gt;FIB Headquarters&lt;/a&gt; to delete incriminating files about the team and Agent &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Haines\"&gt;Steve Haines&lt;/a&gt;, and helps the three protagonists &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Down\"&gt;find and rescue&lt;/a&gt; Franklin's friend &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt; after Franklin's former friend &lt;a href=\"Stretch%20%28character%29\"&gt;Stretch&lt;/a&gt; betrayed him to the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt;.

If the player chooses the Obvious approach to &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;The Big Score&lt;/a&gt;, Lester will travel as a passenger in Trevor's &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; and shoot down pursuing Merryweather &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;helicopters&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt;.\nEndings.\nBy the end of the game, Franklin is given separate orders by Steve Haines and &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt; to kill one of his friends. Haines wants him to &lt;a href=\"Something%20Sensible\"&gt;kill Trevor&lt;/a&gt; and Weston wants him to &lt;a href=\"The%20Time%27s%20Come\"&gt;kill Michael&lt;/a&gt;. The player then has to choose between carrying out Haines' instructions, carrying out Weston's, or disregarding them both and &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;getting together with both Michael and Trevor to take out their enemies&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nEnding C=\nThe Third Way.\nFranklin contacts Lester and asks him for help on figuring out what to do. Lester initially suggests killing both Trevor and Michael, but eventually comes up with a better way to solve the problem. He lures Haines' corrupt &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; allies and Weston's private &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather battalion&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Banks%20Steel%20Foundry\"&gt;foundry&lt;/a&gt; where the three protagonists ambush and kill all of them, stripping both Haines and &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Weston&lt;/a&gt; of their brute force power. Afterwards, Lester acquires the locations of all of the protagonists' enemies (after Franklin explains to him that &lt;a href=\"Stretch%20%28character%29\"&gt;Stretch&lt;/a&gt;'s real name is Harold Joseph), allowing them to take out their enemies once and for all. Michael kills Stretch, Franklin kills &lt;a href=\"Wei%20Cheng\"&gt;Wei Cheng&lt;/a&gt; and Trevor kills Haines before going to &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston%27s%20Mansion\"&gt;Devin Weston mansion&lt;/a&gt; to kidnap him. Trevor takes Weston to a cliff in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt; where he meets up with Michael and Franklin and all three protagonists proceed to mock a terrified Weston before pushing the &lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; he is in off the cliff, killing him. After the assassinations are carried out, Lester sends all three protagonists their respective shares from the UD job and congratulates them on a job well done.\nEnding A or B=\nSomething Sensible/The Time's Come.\nIn these endings, Lester only appears again through an email he sends to the two surviving protagonists. If Trevor is &lt;a href=\"Something%20Sensible\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt;, he sends Franklin and Michael their share of the Union Depository job and splits Trevor's share between them, as well as claiming to be \"rather disappointed\" that things \"had to end as they did\". If Michael is &lt;a href=\"The%20Time%27s%20Come\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt;, Lester sends Franklin and Trevor their shares of the Union Depository job and sends Michael's share to his family, while at the same time stating in his email that he hopes neither Franklin nor Trevor was involved in Michael's death.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" after 2013.\nThe Doomsday Heist.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2017\"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;, Lester contacts the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist, saying he has found opportunities more lucrative than the traditional bank heists, which can be utilized under a &lt;a href=\"SecuroServ\"&gt;SecuroServ&lt;/a&gt; VIP contract, a SecuroServ CEO organization, or a registered Motorcycle Club. The player begins by purchasing a &lt;a href=\"Facilities\"&gt;government facility&lt;/a&gt;, where Lester meets them along with a billionaire named &lt;a href=\"Avon%20Hertz\"&gt;Avon Hertz&lt;/a&gt; and his AI neural network named &lt;a href=\"Cliffford\"&gt;Cliffford&lt;/a&gt;. Avon claims that he and Cliffford have unfolded a doomsday plot from an unknown foreign entity and is looking to hire some people for taking on extremely dangerous missions, such as the &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Headquarters\"&gt;NOOSE building&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt; from Merryweather. Thus, Lester and the protagonist agree to become hired guns for Avon.\nIn the, &lt;a href=\"The%20Data%20Breaches\"&gt;conclusion of Act 1&lt;/a&gt;, Avon sends the protagonist to a secret IAA facility beneath the &lt;a href=\"Satellite%20Relay%20Station\"&gt;Satellite Relay Station&lt;/a&gt; which is under attack by Merryweather Security. Avon claims that Merryweather was hired by an \"unknown\" client and that it is the protagonist's job to clear the facility of hostile activity and rescue any IAA agents still alive. After the attack is foiled, &lt;a href=\"Agent%2014\"&gt;Agent 14&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Phoenicia%20Rackman\"&gt;Phoenicia Rackman&lt;/a&gt; reluctantly team up with Avon on behalf of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;International Affairs Agency&lt;/a&gt;. The three of them hire Lester and the protagonist to find the \"unknown\" client who paid off Merryweather and uncover their intentions. The trail eventually leads to the \"&lt;a href=\"Ramius\"&gt;Ramius&lt;/a&gt;\", a Russian submarine off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt;, and a rogue Russian special ops unit led by a mysterious Russian agent called &lt;a href=\"Bogdan\"&gt;Bogdan&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"The%20Bogdan%20Problem\"&gt;conclusion of Act 2&lt;/a&gt;, the protagonist, with the help of Lester, infiltrates the \"Ramius\" and eliminates anyone who stands in their way. After Avon orders them to upload Cliffford into the sub's mainframe, Bogdan reveals himself and tells the protagonist that Avon and Cliffford are actually planning to launch a nuclear missile, resulting in , and that he was only trying to stop them. Avon reveals his true colors and Cliffford initiates the sub's self-destruct sequence to destroy all \"evidence\". Lester orders the protagonist to jump ship and Bogdan willingly provides them with some scuba gear before taking flight in an escape pod, after which the Ramius explodes. After escaping, the protagonist regroups with Lester, Rackman, and Agent 14 at the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter killing Avon and destroying Cliffford in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Scenario\"&gt;Act 3 finale&lt;/a&gt;, the protagonist reconvenes with Lester, Agent 14, and Rackman at the &lt;a href=\"Galileo%20Observatory\"&gt;Galileo Observatory&lt;/a&gt; and is congratulated on their success and for stopping a nuclear war. Lester, speaking for the protagonist and himself, tells Rackman that they will settle for their \"fat paycheck\" and Rackman agrees to pay. A socially awkward Lester then tries to initiate \"small talk\" with the protagonist before giving up and saying \"Well, this has been... horrifying... really, really horrifying but... also pretty fun. So, bye bye.\".\nAt the conclusion of &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Heist\"&gt;The Doomsday Heist&lt;/a&gt;, Lester calls the protagonist and informs them that due to their work in stopping Avon, Lester will no longer charge the player when they need police attention removed.\nThe Diamond Casino Heist.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2019\"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;, Lester unexpectedly contacts the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist, asking them to meet him at &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Park\"&gt;Mirror Park&lt;/a&gt; for a new opportunity. When the protagonist arrives, Lester is angry at the player for messaging him and tells them that he is done with heists. When the protagonist shows Lester that he messaged them, Lester realizes that his phone was hacked. The hacker, &lt;a href=\"Georgina%20Cheng\"&gt;Georgina Cheng&lt;/a&gt;, immediately shows up with her associate &lt;a href=\"Huang\"&gt;Huang&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of &lt;a href=\"Cheng%20Family%20Holdings\"&gt;Cheng Family Holdings&lt;/a&gt;. She claims that she wants the two of them to rob &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20%26amp%3B%20Resort\"&gt;The Diamond Casino &amp; Resort&lt;/a&gt; for her, due to the &lt;a href=\"Duggan%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Duggan Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; recently taking control of the casino from them. Though reluctant to do so, Lester agrees to help and tells the protagonist to purchase an &lt;a href=\"Arcades\"&gt;Arcade Center&lt;/a&gt; to be used as a front for the heist, with him hiring staff, including his old friend Michael's son &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Jimmy&lt;/a&gt;, to make the purchase seem legitimate. Lester briefly explains to the protagonist that Jimmy is a \"family friend\", and Jimmy refers to Lester as \"my Uncle Les\", indicating Lester is still close friends with Michael and his family by this time.\nLater on, Lester meets up with the protagonist at their newly purchased Arcade center and runs them through some basic business setup to get the place up and running before they can plan the heist in the basement. Lester remains behind the scenes as the &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20Heist\"&gt;heist&lt;/a&gt; planner and gives instructions on the Prep missions and eventually the heist itself. Once it is pulled off, Lester regroups with the crew on the roof of the building directly across from the casino to celebrate. Georgina then unexpectedly arrives and flirts with him, eventually making out passionately on the rooftop as they begin a romantic relationship.\nAfter the heist, Lester continues to help the protagonist rob the casino whenever they want, should they choose to do so. Later on, a picture can be seen of Lester and Georgina hanging out at the &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro%20Pier\"&gt;Del Perro Pier&lt;/a&gt;, with Lester having won a stuffed animal from one of the carnival games for her.\nThe Contract.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2021\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;, during the events of update, it is revealed that Franklin and Lester are still in touch, and that Lester has recently spoken to Franklin about the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist robbing The Diamond Casino &amp; Resort in 2019.\nLester is also briefly mentioned by Franklin during the &lt;a href=\"Payphone%20Hits\"&gt;Payphone Hits&lt;/a&gt; introduction, as \"the dude who &lt;a href=\"Lester%27s%20Assassinations\"&gt;used to run the hits&lt;/a&gt; in this town\".\nAgents of Sabotage.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2024\"&gt;2024&lt;/a&gt;, Lester sells the Darnell Garment Factory to the . He later sends them an email, remarking that most of Los Santos belongs to them now. An attached picture confirms Lester and Georgina are still together. The fact that his email mentions he is retired could possibly indicate that by this point, he and the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist have stopped robbing The Diamond Casino &amp; Resort.\nCharacter.\nLester suffers from a wasting disease which has gradually worn down his motor skills during his life and left him wheelchair-bound, though he is able to walk short distances with the use of a &lt;a href=\"cane\"&gt;cane&lt;/a&gt;. Due to his limited mobility, Lester has grown considerably overweight, and he also suffers from asthma. In &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20Heist\"&gt;The Diamond Casino Heist&lt;/a&gt; - Aggressive approach, he tells the player that \"driving aggravates his hives\". At another point in The Diamond Casino Heist, Lester says that he \"feels his eczema clearing\".\nIt is implied that Lester was bullied in high school, as he posted on &lt;a href=\"Bleeter\"&gt;Bleeter&lt;/a&gt; that \"getting revenge\" on his old high school class \"never seemed to get old\". Although he owns a &lt;a href=\"Asea\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt;, he is rarely seen driving.\nLester appears to be ambidextrous, as he uses both arms to draw on the planning board when putting together the plan in the &lt;a href=\"Arcades\"&gt;arcade&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nIn 2013, he is usually seen dressed in a green checkered shirt and blue jeans or brown trousers. He has an unused brown suit with a green checkered undershirt with a small tie and black loafers. The in-game version of Lester's artwork shows him wearing a red shirt instead of the green checkered shirt. This outfit is only seen in the &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Score%20Setup\"&gt;Paleto Score Setup&lt;/a&gt; when getting off the bus and in the Paleto Score heist opening cutscene when he meets Michael, Trevor, Franklin, and the chosen gunman at &lt;a href=\"Ace%20Liquor\"&gt;Ace Liquor&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality.\nDespite Lester's physical disabilities, he makes up for this with a genius-level intelligence, a masterful expertise in technology and computing and a sharp eye for detail, which is what makes him an excellent planner for the various heists he has pulled off throughout his life. He is also an avid video-gamer and is a particular fan of \"&lt;a href=\"Righteous%20Slaughter%207\"&gt;Righteous Slaughter 7&lt;/a&gt;\".\nLester is, by his own admission, socially awkward and reveals to the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist during the Fleeca Job that he is \"not the best conversationalist\" and rarely meets people in person. When he meets people online and arranges to meet them in real life, he will show up but not introduce himself to his dates and will instead watch them from afar. Sometimes he likes cracking bad jokes that are met with awkward silence, showing his inability to deal with people outside the business or the online life.\nLester is very well informed on world politics and the machinations and details of corporate activities. Using this knowledge, he has previously been involved in stock fraud and corporate assassination. He also keeps a close eye on the criminal world. He mentions \"an Eastern European guy in Liberty City\" when thinking of people to help them hit the jewelry store, possibly referring to &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;. He comments on the &lt;a href=\"McReary%20Family\"&gt;McReary family&lt;/a&gt; if the player chooses &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McReary\"&gt;Packie&lt;/a&gt;'s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 while planning a heist, indicating that he also knows about them beyond just Patrick himself.\nLester is also shown to brew his own moonshine, as when first entering Lester's home, the player can find alcohol brewing equipment set up with tubes running into jugs. After &lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;The Bureau Raid&lt;/a&gt;, if the player chose the Covert approach, Lester instructs Franklin to fill up everyone's glasses and mention he has some \"real vintage\" moonshine.\nOn Lester's &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader\"&gt;Lifeinvader&lt;/a&gt; page, a message from a girl asking about his true age can be seen, implying that he fakes his age in order to talk to younger women, with &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; referring to him as \"Lester the Molester\". Lester admits to Franklin that he &lt;a href=\"Hacking\"&gt;hacks&lt;/a&gt; girls' webcams to watch them and after &lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;The Bureau Raid&lt;/a&gt; (Fire Crew approach), he says he will \"reverse engineer a webcam and spy on those sorority girls again\". Lester possibly believes that the is watching him as he has an Illuminati poster in his house as well as a folder on his laptop's desktop labeled \"Illuminati\", and this may possibly explain why the windows of his house are covered up.\nServices (\"GTA Online\").\nLester is unlocked as a phone contact at rank 10. When called, he offers a wide range of services, which are generally to assist the Protagonist. Each service costs a specific amount of money and is unlocked once a specific rank has been reached."}

He has been arrested on three occasions: once in &lt;a href=\"1999\"&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt; for burglary, in &lt;a href=\"2003\"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt; for possession of a controlled substance (namely cocaine) and in &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt; for burglary. He may also be working as a middleman as the LCPD Database states that the &lt;a href=\"Jaoming%20Family\"&gt;Jaoming Family&lt;/a&gt; supply the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt; with narcotics.

Because of this, he hires Lester to discover if the informant is connected to the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt; motorcycle club, who were previously allied to the Triads. A few days later, Lester e-mails &lt;a href=\"Huang%20Lee\"&gt;Huang Lee&lt;/a&gt; and asks Huang to help him infiltrate the gang.\nBecause Lester cannot ride a motorcycle, he asks Huang to &lt;a href=\"Double%20Trouble\"&gt;undertake&lt;/a&gt; the AOD's initiation test on his behalf. Wearing Lester's spare jacket and riding his &lt;a href=\"Chopper\"&gt;bike&lt;/a&gt;, Huang manages to impress the gang by performing several stunts and intimidating &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; into surrendering their territories. Huang later destroys the &lt;a href=\"Monoglobe\"&gt;Monoglobe&lt;/a&gt;, which kills several Lost MC members in the process. Despite Huang, pretending to be Lester, being successful in the first test, Lester reveals that there is another, final test: selling the gang's merchandise. However, Lester had to prove himself to other members that he wasn't a \"narc\", leading him to drink and smoke for two days in row, making him too intoxicated to complete the final test. Huang then &lt;a href=\"Faster%20Pusher%20Man%21%20Sell%21%20Sell%21\"&gt;sells the merchandise for several potential buyers&lt;/a&gt;. Having passed the initiation, Lester is accepted into the gang.\nInvestigation.\nLester soon discovers that the only person within the AOD who can inform him of any potential informants within the club is &lt;a href=\"Meredith\"&gt;Meredith&lt;/a&gt;, the girlfriend of chapter leader &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Arnold\"&gt;Lester Arnold&lt;/a&gt;. However, only senior members of the club can communicate with her. Because of this, Lester attempts to gain more credibility within the club by offering to escort a convoy carrying the club's products. Lester asks Huang for his &lt;a href=\"Convoy%20Conflict\"&gt;assistance&lt;/a&gt;. The convoy is attacked by The Lost, but Huang manages to fend them off and the products are safely delivered, which grants Lester permission to speak with Meredith.\nMeredith performs oral sex on Lester, which arouses suspicions amongst the AOD members. Suspecting that the couple have had an affair, they attempt to follow Meredith to Lester's apartment. Lester, who was close to receiving information from Meredith about a potential informant, asks Huang to &lt;a href=\"See%20No%20Evil\"&gt;prevent&lt;/a&gt; the Angels of Death from reaching his apartment whilst he receives information from Meredith. Huang fends off AOD members following Meredith's car, and then stands guard outside whilst Lester receives the information from Meredith. After the mission, Lester emails Huang and informs him that the informant is not within the Angels of Death. Lester thanks Huang for his help, and ends the email by telling Huang that he can call Lester at any time should be ever need assistance."}

The player assumes the role of a bee that must attain a specific number of flowers attached to leaves (which translates to points in the form of honey) while moving upwards on each level. This must be done\u00a0within an allotted time, while avoiding thorny stems that will instantly kill the bee on contact. Those thorns are the only threat in the game apart from the timer. If the player depletes all\u00a0lives, the game is over; the play starts with three lives but extra lives are\u00a0given as the score (honey)\u00a0increases. If the bee collects all the flowers, the player will move on to the next level, which will be predictably more difficult as the number of flowers to collect and the amount of thorny obstacles are increased.\nThe movement of the bee (clearly based on 's 1984 arcade hit \"\", considered quite\u00a0original back then) is controlled\u00a0left and right\u00a0by directional commands, and vertical movement is based on\u00a0the balance of the\u00a0opposing forces of the bee's upwards thrust and the downwards force of gravity on the bee (its weight). Thus, downwards movement can only be made indirectly, and is challenging until the player adapts to it. Tapping the thrust button the bee can fly horizontally or it can\u00a0bump on the leaves as it falls\u00a0to jump higher."}

I agree whole heartedly with you - my actions were a little inhumane. But that's not a bad thing. Inhumanity is the very watchword, the very currency, the very life blood of the artist! My inhumanity makes me human. It's thanks to my inhumanity that I'm able to speak to people with the moral authority of the sinner and the creator, all at once. I had to kill &lt;a href=\"Leonora%20Johnson\"&gt;her&lt;/a&gt;. And I had to do it in that way. The way that would hurt me most - by torturing her slowly and painfully, then sending mementos from our date to her family. And in the years since, I've had to, at times, goad her family into further suffering. Just to prove how very much I understand suffering and how I can represent it best as an artist - isn't it better that one family suffers so the world can be free to enjoy, to learn and to be cleansed by my masterpieces? Don't even bother answering that. The answer is obvious and if you get it wrong, well, then you're less of a man than I thought.\"\n\"But let us not concern ourselves with such trivialities - we are artists, my friend. The last of a dying breed. I dread the day when you finally retire and &lt;a href=\"Solomon%20Richards\"&gt;Solomon&lt;/a&gt; takes over - sure I love the kid but he's a remorseless hack with none of your passion, your creative zeal. He's a weak livered moralizer hiding in the body of a &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; decadent. He understands nothing about why we act as we do! Not because we can, but because we must. And that's the thing. Some people take advantage of their position in this town for pleasure - as if sleeping with multiple young girls, or torturing hitchhikers or eating dogs could ever be fun? It's awful. I only do it to experience it so my art is truer, deeper, more meaningful, and I believe you know that.\"\n\"I cannot wait for you to read my new draft of LEARED. I have really removed the cliches that ruined Shakespeare's plays and found the power, the moment, the thing we talked about that wonderful night in &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; when we paid the hookers to stab each other.\"\n\"Anyway, I hope you and Rachel have worked through your problems. I look forward to making Friday supper again soon. You've always been an inspiration to me.\"\n\"Your dear friend\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Peter%20Dreyfuss\"&gt;Dreyfuss&lt;/a&gt;\""}

For example, Liberty City has been the city with more updates in the saga and has been preserved in all its versions, the equivalent of Central Park from the first to the last version.\nLiberty City.\nAs mentioned, Liberty City is the city with more versions based on New York City.

The difference between the above places is that New Guernsey NJ (name and geography are very similar to NJ) would be part of Liberty City (1) by their size and Shoreside Vale is based elsewhere (and not primarily in NJ), however Alderney is a state based entirely on NJ and independent of Liberty City as well as is its real counterpart NY.\nPlaces.\nThe following table shows the places of New Guernsey, Shoreside Vale and Alderney its real counterpart:\nSan Andreas/San Fierro.\nSan Francisco also has its equivalent in the \"GTA\" series since the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;first game&lt;/a&gt; with the City of San Andreas that shows neighborhoods based on their real counterparts.

It is the first city that the player must play in before they may go on to unlock the other two cities (&lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;).\nHistory.\n\"\"The so-called \"gateway to freedom\", where millions of Europeans first entered the USA, is everything you imagined it could be and more. Glamorous and cynical, hard-edged and soft-livered, beautiful and damned, it is a city living on the edge. From the glamor of Island City to the down at heel bums of The Brix, this is truly the city that sleeps with one eye open. Founded on land bought from Native Americans for just $37, a barrel of mead and a sack of feathers by Belgian settlers in 1603, the ancient 5 boroughs of Liberty Island (incorporating Nixon Island and Law Island), The Brix, Estoria, Kings and Brocklyn have effectively been joined in the metropolitan area by urban areas from the neighboring &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20New%20Guernsey\"&gt;state of New Guernsey&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Whether you have lived in Liberty all your life, or are visiting for the first time, there is always something new to see. From the tragedy of Law Island, where a plague out break once killed a million immigrants awaiting transfers to the mainland, to the ethnic charm of Island Heights, to the galleries and sky scrapers of downtown Island City, there is so much to see and do.\"\"What really makes Liberty City, though, is the people who choose to live there. From plague to city-wide bankruptcy in the 1970s, from new dawns to broken promises, these people have lived through it all, secure in the knowledge that as long as they have coffee in the morning and an easy buck to make, things can't be that bad. Liberty City has acquired a terrible reputation for violent, organized crime over the years. Yet, as the mayor's office spokesman says, \"Liberty City used to be a very violent place, but since we took office, it now has the 47th lowest murder rate of any cite on the eastern sea board\". Nonetheless, inexperienced visitors are advised to avoid The Park at night, when drug-addled squirrels run wild, keep out of Kings at day or night, and to avoid The Brix at any given time.\"\"\u2015 &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.rockstargames.com/gta/\"&gt;Official GTA website &gt; Cities &gt; Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;\nInfluence.\nThe city is based on . The name appears to be a nod to the real-life and its landmark, the . The in-universe counterpart of is named &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Island\"&gt;Liberty Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nWeighing against &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;its later counterpart&lt;/a&gt;, the city's geography and alignment of districts in the game are much more reminiscent of , featuring two major mainlands with a -like central island named &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Island\"&gt;Liberty Island&lt;/a&gt; (which contains a large park at the center, a reference to ), and several smaller islands along a river of the city, with the mainlands and islands connected primarily by road bridges. Neighboring and surrounding boroughs in New York City are also spoofed, the former described as being in a separate state (&lt;a href=\"State%20of%20New%20Guernsey\"&gt;New Guernsey&lt;/a&gt;) of its own (similar to &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\").\nLike New York City, Liberty City is designed as heavily urbanized city with vast numbers of buildings and only a minimal number of parks and greenery. A looping train line, running along elevated and underground lines, also services locations all across the city.\nDistricts.\nLiberty City has the largest number of districts among the three in the game, with a total of 14. The districts are evidently based on real life areas in New York City, while their names are wordplay's of those from their real life counterparts:\nCrime.\nVarious areas in Liberty City suffer from high crime rates, most likely brought about by the rivalry between the &lt;a href=\"Mafia\"&gt;Mafia&lt;/a&gt; families from Liberty and New Guernsey \u2013 the &lt;a href=\"Vercotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Vercotti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sonetti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Sonetti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. The Sonetti Crime Family is known to use the Liberty City subway system to smuggle their merchandise, presumably drugs, across the state.\nThe two families fight over the drugs trade and other businesses in Liberty City for money and power. Aside from the gang violence and drug trafficking, other crimes and social problems such as car theft, kidnapping, arms trafficking, drug smuggling, and &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; corruption also plague certain districts and neighborhoods.\nOn the game's promotional website, the mayor's office spokesman claims that the city used to be a very violent place, but since they took office, it now has the 47th lowest murder rate of any city on the eastern sea board. The visitor guide warns inexperienced visitors to avoid &lt;a href=\"Park\"&gt;The Park&lt;/a&gt; at night, when drug-addled squirrels run wild, to keep out of &lt;a href=\"Kings\"&gt;Kings&lt;/a&gt; at day or night, and to avoid &lt;a href=\"Brix\"&gt;The Brix&lt;/a&gt; at any given time.\nBy &lt;a href=\"1997\"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Protagonists%20in%20GTA%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;hired gun&lt;/a&gt; from the Vercottis engaged in a major gang war against the Sonettis, which resulted in the death of &lt;a href=\"Sonetti\"&gt;Don Sonetti&lt;/a&gt; and the fall of the Sonetti Crime Family. The same person was also involved in two bombing attacks in the Liberty City subway system, destroying two &lt;a href=\"Train\"&gt;subway trains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gangsta%20Bang%20-%20Counthash\"&gt;one of them&lt;/a&gt; resulting in over a hundred casualties.\nTransportation.\nLiberty City has a subway system that connects the many areas of Brocklyn, Kings, Liberty Island, and Brix via rail bridges and tunnels. The subway also reaches a few areas of the neighbouring New Guernsey State, including &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Law\"&gt;Fort Law&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Guernsey%20City\"&gt;Guernsey City&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Color\"&gt;Game Boy Color&lt;/a&gt; port of \"Grand Theft Auto\", the subway trains, rail bridges and tunnels are absent due to hardware limitations, while subway station platforms are replaced by buildings with a \"subway\" sign, which are used as a fast travel point to each station."}

The city area has a population of 4,000,000 people by 2001. According to the official website, Liberty City's sister city is &lt;a href=\"Beirut\"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt;, an ironic joke from the producers considering Beirut was frequently bombed during the .\nDespite the multiple inspirations, Liberty City is treated as being New York City in the 3D Universe.\nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt; says in its October &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt; issue that Liberty will celebrate its 200th anniversary:\nLiberty City was established in &lt;a href=\"1798\"&gt;1798&lt;/a&gt;, 22 years after the Declaration of Independence in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Chatterbox%20FM\"&gt;Chatterbox FM&lt;/a&gt; host &lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Lazlow Jones&lt;/a&gt;, Liberty City was \"a church, a cow pasture and three houses when the telephone was invented\" (the first telephone was patented in 1876). Most of the history of the 3D Universe Liberty City does not reflect that of real-life New York City; for example, New York City was founded in 1624, making it 174 years older than the 3D Universe Liberty City, and by 1876 New York was a sprawling metropolis of over one million people that ranked as the largest city in the US and second largest in the world (behind London).\nBoroughs.\nLiberty City is divided into three boroughs, comprising 25 defined districts and neighborhoods, and the outskirts of the city. In \"Grand Theft Auto III\", a small area made exclusively for the &lt;a href=\"Introduction%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;introduction cutscene&lt;/a&gt; is hidden behind the hills of Shoreside Vale, although the area cannot be reached by normal means. It is popularly known as the \"Ghost Town\" due to the lack of collision. In \"Grand Theft Auto III - The Definitive Edition\", the area is rendered invisible after the cutscene ends, and the hills are replaced by an unnamed section of &lt;a href=\"Upstate%20Liberty\"&gt;Upstate Liberty&lt;/a&gt; only meant to be background scenery.\nThe boroughs of Liberty City are: \nGeography.\nLiberty City is located on the of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Liberty%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;State of Liberty&lt;/a&gt;. It is north of &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;, far away east of the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;State of San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, and close to &lt;a href=\"Carcer%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Carcer City&lt;/a&gt;, with links to &lt;a href=\"Upstate%20Liberty\"&gt;Upstate Liberty&lt;/a&gt; through a &lt;a href=\"Upstate%20Tunnel\"&gt;road tunnel&lt;/a&gt; connecting &lt;a href=\"Cedar%20Grove\"&gt;Cedar Grove&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cochrane%20Dam\"&gt;Cochrane Dam&lt;/a&gt; as seen in \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nThe city is relatively flat, with major hills only appearing in Portland (&lt;a href=\"Saint%20Mark%27s\"&gt;Saint Mark's&lt;/a&gt;) and Shoreside Vale (&lt;a href=\"Pike%20Creek\"&gt;Pike Creek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cedar%20Grove\"&gt;Cedar Grove&lt;/a&gt;). In \"Grand Theft Auto Advance\", however, the city is depicted to have no hills, although this is due to the limited resources of the &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Advance\"&gt;Game Boy Advance&lt;/a&gt;. Portland and Staunton Island are completely surrounded by ocean water. In Shoreside Vale a major river flows through the center of the borough down from the Cochrane Dam to Witchita Gardens.\nCityscape.\nClimate.\nDuring the setting of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", in &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt; Liberty City was going through a snowy December winter, with snow on streets and structures visible. During the setting of \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\", in &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt; Liberty City experiences a pleasant autumn with rain and cloudy days. During the setting of \"Grand Theft Auto III\", in &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt; the weather is cool with frequent rain and fog. The thermometer in &lt;a href=\"Bedford%20Point\"&gt;Bedford Point&lt;/a&gt; indicates the city's current temperature, which oddly tells the temperature in Celsius rather than in Fahrenheit. Liberty City is the only city in the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; where snow has covered the ground.\nDifferences between \"GTA III\" &amp; \"GTA: Liberty City Stories\".\nThe Liberty City featured in \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\" is based on the \"Grand Theft Auto III\" version of the city, but it is set three years previous in &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of the city remains the same but there are some noticeable differences between this and its &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt; counterpart.\nGang Control differences.\nDue to the city\u2019s large Italian-American population, particularly in Portland, the city sees a constantly fluctuating level of mafia activity. In 2001, two mafia families are present, with the Leones being the dominant Mafia family operating in Portland, mainly in &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Mark%27s\"&gt;Saint Mark's&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Light%20District\"&gt;Red Light District&lt;/a&gt;, and the much smaller &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli&lt;/a&gt; family operating mainly out of their only known front: &lt;a href=\"Marco%27s%20Bistro\"&gt;Marco's Bistro&lt;/a&gt;, and an additional hideout in &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Quays\"&gt;Atlantic Quays&lt;/a&gt;. But in 1998, there were three families operating in the city, the Leone, the &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Sindacco&lt;/a&gt; families, and &lt;a href=\"Sicilian%20Mafia\"&gt;a fourth trying&lt;/a&gt; to get in. The Leones are still in control of Saint Mark's but the Sindaccos control the Red Light District and Hepburn Heights in Portland and &lt;a href=\"Newport\"&gt;Newport&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Torrington\"&gt;Torrington&lt;/a&gt; in Staunton while the Forellis control Fort Staunton in Staunton Island and &lt;a href=\"Wichita%20Gardens\"&gt;Wichita Gardens&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Vale\"&gt;Shoreside Vale&lt;/a&gt;. The three families are locked in war with each other, leading to the arrest, trial and release of &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore Leone&lt;/a&gt;, the deaths of Forelli-controlled Mayor &lt;a href=\"Roger%20C.%20Hole\"&gt;Roger C. Hole&lt;/a&gt; and Sindacco Don &lt;a href=\"Paulie%20Sindacco\"&gt;Paulie Sindacco&lt;/a&gt; and the destruction of Fort Staunton. The weakening of the Mafia led to new gangs coming in for control of territory left behind. The &lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Yardies\"&gt;Yardies&lt;/a&gt; end up controling Newport, the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;Colombian Cartel&lt;/a&gt; control Fort Staunton while the &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt; control Torrington, southern Newport and surrounding areas. On Portland, the Triads control &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Diablos\"&gt;Diablos&lt;/a&gt; battle with the Leones for control of Hepburn Heights and the Red Light District. While on Shoreside Vale, the &lt;a href=\"Southside%20Hoods\"&gt;Southside Hoods&lt;/a&gt; control former Forelli Wichita Gardens. Other gangs in 1998 include the &lt;a href=\"Avenging%20Angels\"&gt;Avenging Angels&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Biker%20Gang\"&gt;Liberty City Bikers&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy 2001, the aforementioned gangs still control their aforementioned territories but the Sindaccos have been ran out of the city and the Forellis are now considerably weakened. Furthermore, the Liberty City Bikers have gone extinct following a city-wide motorcycle ban, and the Avenging Angels have similarly disappeared without a trace.\nPolitics.\nThe Mayor of Liberty City in &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Miles%20O%27Donovan\"&gt;Miles O'Donovan&lt;/a&gt;, who won an election against &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"A%20Walk%20in%20the%20Park\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; of the previous mayor, &lt;a href=\"Roger%20C.%20Hole\"&gt;Roger C. Hole&lt;/a&gt;, at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;.\nRoger C. Hole was elected Mayor of Liberty City in &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt; and during this time proved to be corrupt. Hole, who was being controlled by &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Boss\"&gt;Don&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Franco%20Forelli\"&gt;Franco Forelli&lt;/a&gt;, caused numerous controversies during his term in office. In 1993, three Russian prostitutes and a construction company manager were caught trying to get a government contract from Hole. In 1995, he was photographed with members of the Forelli Crime Family whilst he was accused of securing drugs for city officials in return for sanitation contracts. Hole was also accused of sleeping with two underage girls. Eventually, his connections with the Forelli Crime Family resulted in his own death in 1998. During his term in office, he raised taxation, reduced public expenditure, increased bureaucratic costs and kept Liberty City in the national news.\nAn election was then triggered, with businessman Donald Love running against former candidate Miles O'Donovan. Love received help from &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore Leone&lt;/a&gt; and Toni Cipriani, who campaigned for him, stopped the Forelli Crime Family rigging the election and even attempt to rig the election in Donald's favour. However, after links between Love and the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; were discovered, the people voted in favour of O'Donovan.\nEducation.\nThere is only one known educational building in the city: the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Community%20College\"&gt;Liberty City Community College&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Campus\"&gt;Liberty Campus&lt;/a&gt; district of Staunton Island. In the beta version of \"Grand Theft Auto III\", a school could also be seen in the &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt; district of &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;, although this was later replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20School%20Hall\"&gt;Old School Hall&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;\"Grand Theft Auto Advance\"&lt;/a&gt;, the Liberty Campus college is seen during the mission &lt;a href=\"School%27s%20Out\"&gt;School's Out&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Mike\"&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; kidnaps &lt;a href=\"Yuka\"&gt;Yuka&lt;/a&gt;, the niece of &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt; co-leader &lt;a href=\"Asuka%20Kasen\"&gt;Asuka Kasen&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Liberty City Community College is based at the Liberty Campus district. The college is run by &lt;a href=\"Dean%20Smegley\"&gt;Dean Smegley&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Ershwitz\"&gt;Eric Ershwitz&lt;/a&gt; employed at the college as Professor for Contemporary Crime. The college was named in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in Smegley's appointment as Dean and his changing of the colleges program. Smegley, in &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;, announces his plans to abandon the old methods of evaluation and old subjects, planning to replace them with diplomas for new subjects and grading students on how bad they look. The new subjects include: Street cleaning, Processed Agriculture Rotation, Grill Management, Floor cleaning, Restroom Administration, Coatroom Management, Automobile Ignition Circumvention and Pharmaceutical Baking.\nMedia.\nLiberty City's media is dominated, in &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;, by the &lt;a href=\"Love%20Media\"&gt;Love Media&lt;/a&gt; group run by &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt;, which also controls numerous other businesses across the city. The company owns \"900 radio stations, 300 television stations, 4 networks, 3 satellites, and 10 senators\" according to a Love Media advert. Besides owning various media, Love Media probably also has films, including \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Mainframe\"&gt;The Mainframe&lt;/a&gt;\" which was released in &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;.\nRadio.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;, the city had ten independently owned radio stations. The city also had a publicly funded station, &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Free%20Radio\"&gt;Liberty City Free Radio&lt;/a&gt;. By 2001, the airwaves of the city had changed. Love Media purchased Head Radio, Double Clef FM, &lt;a href=\"Flashback%2095.6\"&gt;Flashback 95.6&lt;/a&gt; and Liberty City Free Radio, replacing that station with &lt;a href=\"Chatterbox%20FM\"&gt;Chatterbox FM&lt;/a&gt;. A number of stations remain outside of Love Media's ownership: Lips 106, Rise FM, MSX FM (replacing MSX 98) and &lt;a href=\"Game%20Radio\"&gt;Game Radio&lt;/a&gt; (which replaced The Liberty Jam). Three other radio stations also exist in the city in 2001, although &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; cannot listen to them. They are &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20FM\"&gt;Liberty FM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"WLLC%20The%20Zone%2034.9%20FM\"&gt;WLLC \u2018The Zone\u2019&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Soul%20FM\"&gt;Liberty Soul FM&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Radio Del Mundo seems to have disappeared due to unknown reasons.\nThe player can listen to the following radio stations:\nPrint Media.\nThe city's newspaper, the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt;, is privately owned in 1998, but by 2001 comes under the ownership of the Love Media group. The newspaper has been \"promoting family values\" for over fifty years. &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Tedman\"&gt;Adam Tedman&lt;/a&gt;, a report for the paper, reports that the Liberty Tree won the \"Most Absorbent Newsprint Award\" at the Cleaning and Tidying Association of &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt; annual awards ceremony. In the same &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree/Liberty%20Tree%20Wins%20Award.%20No%20New%20Information.\"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, Tedman also references that Liberty Tree has a rival in the city, although he does not mention the newspaper by name. \nSports.\nLiberty City has two known sports teams: the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Cocks%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City Cocks&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Beavers%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City Beavers&lt;/a&gt;. Both are football (soccer) teams, and play at the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Memorial%20Coliseum\"&gt;Liberty Memorial Coliseum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Aspatria\"&gt;Aspatria.&lt;/a&gt; Fans of the Liberty City Cocks can be seen in the area.\n&lt;a href=\"Derrick%20Thackery\"&gt;Derrick Thackery&lt;/a&gt; mentioned a match between the two on &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20Talk%20Radio\"&gt;WCTR's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Tight%20End%20Zone\"&gt;The Tight End Zone&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;. Another match between the two is played in September of &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt; reporting that the Liberty Cocks won 3-0 after a hat-trick (three goals) from Iranian striker &lt;a href=\"Ma%27am\"&gt;Ma'am&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is a slight oddity with the Liberty City Cocks. They are an American football team in &lt;a href=\"Two-Hand%20Toss\"&gt;Two-Hand Toss&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Memorial%20Coliseum\"&gt;Liberty Memorial Coliseum&lt;/a&gt; in \"Grand Theft Auto III\" has an American football field with Liberty City Cocks lettering in the end-zones, implying that they are an American football team. Either this is a developer oversight, or the Liberty City Cocks field both a soccer and a football team; this would be somewhat akin to the real-life , who shared somewhat of an association with the .\nServices.\nLiberty City has many services available 24 hours per day, including restaurants, transportation, gas, firefighting and health care; these services have different levels of interactivity and benefits. Food service can range from restaurants, food distributors (companies) and cafeterias as &lt;a href=\"Punk%20Noodles\"&gt;Punk Noodles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Joe%27s%20Pizza\"&gt;Joe's Pizza&lt;/a&gt; (used more in &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;), to &lt;a href=\"Tarbrush%20Caf%C3%A9\"&gt;Tarbrush Caf\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Momma%27s%20Restaurante\"&gt;Momma's Restaurante&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belly-Up%20Fish%20%26amp%3B%20Seafood%20Processing%20Plant\"&gt;Belly-Up Fish &amp; Seafood Processing Plant&lt;/a&gt;, etc. Public transportation comes in the form of taxis, buses and commuter trains (both subway and elevated lines).\nPublic Transportation.\nThe public transportation of Liberty City is widely used by pedestrians in the city. The &lt;a href=\"taxi\"&gt;taxi&lt;/a&gt;, which is available for the player to use in taxi side missions, is a common form of transportation for the residents of Liberty City. Liberty City also features a subway system which can provide the player with convenient, reasonably fast transportation between the three boroughs. The Portland El is another carrier, which provides local elevated train service for Portland Island.\nHealth Care.\nHospitals provide another important service in Liberty City; they revive the player, for a cash fee, in the event of his death. The hospitals of Liberty City are:\nPolice.\nThe Liberty City Police Department, which was founded in &lt;a href=\"1869\"&gt;1869&lt;/a&gt;, is another widely used service for all types of problems such as gang fights or theft. The LCPD has problems with bribery and corruption; the dealings of &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Machowski\"&gt;Ray Machowski&lt;/a&gt; with the criminal elements of Liberty City, many of which are revealed in his missions for &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt;, are a rather typical example of the nature of the LCPD. This is most notable and happens in the 2001-\"Grand Theft Auto III\" rendition of Liberty City, since they will not attack &lt;a href=\"Street%20Criminals\"&gt;street criminals&lt;/a&gt; like in earlier and later games, or simply because they weren't programmed to do so, as the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Military\"&gt;Army&lt;/a&gt; will also not attack &lt;a href=\"Street%20Criminals\"&gt;street thugs&lt;/a&gt;. They will take down criminals at any force in the 1998-\"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\" rendition, though, along with the aforementioned in-game agencies.\nFire.\nThe Liberty City Fire Department, founded in &lt;a href=\"1872\"&gt;1872&lt;/a&gt;, is responsible for extinguishing burning buildings, cars and people throughout the city. The Liberty City Fire Department founded has three stations, one located on each island. Fire trucks can usually be found parked outside each of these stations.\nTransportation Infrastructure.\nPrimary road infrastructure around the city includes four bridges (only two bridges -- the &lt;a href=\"Callahan%20Bridge\"&gt;Callahan Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Lift%20Bridge\"&gt;Shoreside Lift Bridge&lt;/a&gt; -- serve the purpose of connecting the three islands), two expressways, the &lt;a href=\"Porter%20Tunnel\"&gt;Porter Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;, which runs underneath all three boroughs of the city, another tunnel under construction in Shoreside Vale (which presumably leads upstate). There is also &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt; and public transportation, such as the subway, that can be used by the player and the &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt;.\nBridges.\nLiberty City has four street bridges throughout the city, two large bridges that connects the three islands:\nCallahan Bridge, also known as \"West Port Bridge\", is a four lane suspension bridge finished sometime after &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;, when construction was almost completed. The bridge links the &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt; district of Portland to the &lt;a href=\"Newport\"&gt;Newport&lt;/a&gt; district of Staunton Island. In &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt; the bridge was partially destroyed when the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;Colombian Cartel&lt;/a&gt; kidnapped the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Oriental%20Gentleman\"&gt;Old Oriental Gentleman&lt;/a&gt;, planting a bomb to kill the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; officers transporting him, &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"8-Ball\"&gt;8-Ball&lt;/a&gt; to Portland.\nThe Shoreside Lift Bridge is a four lane lift bridge, most likely based off George Washington Bridge connecting Manhattan to the New Jersey. In 1998, &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt; has to wait for a &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Ferry%20Strike\"&gt;strike&lt;/a&gt; to end before using the bridge, whilst in 2001 &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; is forced to wait until a mechanical problem is fixed.\nThere are also two smaller but notable bridges: an &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Vale%20Arch%20Bridge\"&gt;unnamed bridge in Shoreside Vale&lt;/a&gt; connecting &lt;a href=\"Pike%20Creek\"&gt;Pike Creek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cedar%20Grove\"&gt;Cedar Grove&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Staunton%20Bridge\"&gt;unnamed little bridge&lt;/a&gt; on Staunton Island connecting &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Staunton\"&gt;Fort Staunton&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Rockford\"&gt;Rockford&lt;/a&gt;.\nExpressways.\nThere are three expressways located in Staunton Island. The first expressway is the &lt;a href=\"Aspatria%20-%20Bedford%20Point%20Expressway\"&gt;Aspatria - Bedford Point Expressway&lt;/a&gt;, a four-lane highway located in the western part of the island. This is the biggest highway in the city, connecting Aspatria with Bedford Point, passing through Belleville Park and below the Shoreside Lift Bridge.\nThe second highway, called \"&lt;a href=\"Newport/Fort%20Staunton%20Expressway\"&gt;Newport/Fort Staunton Expressway&lt;/a&gt;\", runs along the east coast of Staunton Island through the Newport and Fort Staunton districts.\nThere is another highway that links the Newport, Fort Staunton and Torrington districts in east Staunton Island, which is the only highway that pedestrians will walk across; this is possibly because this highway is more akin to a traditional street than the other two.\nRoad Tunnels.\n&lt;a href=\"Porter%20Tunnel\"&gt;Porter Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; is an underground and underwater road tunnel connecting the city's three boroughs. The tunnel may be based on the or the . The tunnel has four lanes, apart from the exit at Staunton Island, which only has two lanes. The tunnel entry/exit points include &lt;a href=\"Harwood\"&gt;Harwood&lt;/a&gt; (in Portland), &lt;a href=\"Rockford\"&gt;Rockford&lt;/a&gt; (in Staunton Island), and &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wichita%20Gardens\"&gt;Wichita Gardens&lt;/a&gt; (both in Shoreside Vale). Construction for the tunnel begins in 1998, however, numerous delays see the tunnel finally open in October 2001, with Claude having to wait for the tunnel to be fully constructed.\nA second road tunnel is located on Shoreside Vale, with entry points at &lt;a href=\"Cedar%20Grove\"&gt;Cedar Grove&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cochrane%20Dam\"&gt;Cochrane Dam&lt;/a&gt;, accessible only in \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\". The tunnel branches into \"Upstate\", although this is blocked off.\nTrains and Subways.\nPortland El.\nThe Portland El (electric line) is an elevated train service running on Portland, connecting the &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Marks\"&gt;Saint Marks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hepburn%20Heights\"&gt;Hepburn Heights&lt;/a&gt; districts. The system, introduced in &lt;a href=\"1930\"&gt;1930&lt;/a&gt;, is not connected to the city's subway system. The three stations are &lt;a href=\"Baillie%20Station\"&gt;Baillie Station&lt;/a&gt; (in Saint Marks), &lt;a href=\"Kurowski%20Station\"&gt;Kurowski Station&lt;/a&gt; (in Chinatown) and &lt;a href=\"Rothwell%20Station\"&gt;Rothwell Station&lt;/a&gt; (in Hepburn Heights).\nSubway.\nThe inter-borough subway system is an underground system linking the three boroughs of the city. The subway stations are located at the border of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Light%20District\"&gt;Red Light District&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt; in Portland, at &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Campus\"&gt;Liberty Campus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bedford%20Point\"&gt;Bedford Point&lt;/a&gt; in Staunton Island, and &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt; in Shoreside Vale. At some point, Liberty City had another subway system, which was abandoned after the construction of the new subway. &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt; uses an old subway entrance to destroy &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Staunton\"&gt;Fort Staunton&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Bringing%20the%20House%20Down\"&gt;Bringing the House Down&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nTaxis.\nOne form of public transport seen on the streets is a taxi. There are two types of taxi seen around Liberty City:\nLiberty City's taxi companies are &lt;a href=\"Mean%20Street%20Taxis\"&gt;Mean Street Taxis&lt;/a&gt;, which is based in &lt;a href=\"Trenton\"&gt;Trenton&lt;/a&gt; (they also operate in &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;, as the main rivals of &lt;a href=\"Kaufman%20Cabs\"&gt;Kaufman Cabs&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Borgnine%20Taxis\"&gt;Borgnine Taxis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Harwood\"&gt;Harwood&lt;/a&gt;, and formerly, the &lt;a href=\"Sunnyside%20Taxis\"&gt;Sunnyside Taxis&lt;/a&gt; in the 1990s.\nFerry Service.\nLiberty City\u00b4s &lt;a href=\"ferry\"&gt;ferry&lt;/a&gt; was the most used interborough transportation service until it was replaced with the more convenient and efficient Callahan Bridge. The ferry connected Portland and Staunton Island, with docks located in &lt;a href=\"Harwood\"&gt;Harwood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rockford\"&gt;Rockford&lt;/a&gt;. The ferry service was canceled by &lt;a href=\"Miles%20O%27Donovan\"&gt;Miles O'Donovan&lt;/a&gt;, despite his promise to maintain the service. In &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;, workers across the city went on strike to protect the ferry service, which only provoked the closure, leaving Portland off the rest of the city. By 2000, the ferry service had been replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Callahan%20Bridge\"&gt;Callahan Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Porter%20Tunnel\"&gt;Porter Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;.\nAirport.\nLiberty City's airport, which is called \"&lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt;\", is the only airport in the city, located in Shoreside Vale. This means of transport is the most widely used by travelers going to and from Liberty City since &lt;a href=\"1953\"&gt;1953&lt;/a&gt;, providing $&lt;a href=\"69\"&gt;69&lt;/a&gt; tickets for travel to different places like &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Miami\"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;, Bogota, Amsterdam, Bangkok, Toronto, Leith and &lt;a href=\"Tokyo\"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;. Several airlines like &lt;a href=\"Air%20Rockstar\"&gt;Rockstar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"DMAir%20Rockstar\"&gt;DMAir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"McAdam%20Airways\"&gt;McAdam Airways&lt;/a&gt;, among others, operate in this airport, providing flights to domestic and international locations.\nRailroad.\nVery little is known about the Liberty City Railroad, but evidence like an old rail yard with some rusty rails located inside it and a &lt;a href=\"Harbour%20Tunnel\"&gt;tunnel&lt;/a&gt; shows that it once existed within the city.\nCrime.\nLiberty City has, in 2001, a rampant crime rate and is known as the \"worst place in &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt;\" because of this. The main problem for the city is the organised crime, and in particular the problem of gangs. The city has also had problems with specific individuals, namely &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1971\"&gt;1971&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mike\"&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2000\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; in 2001. The &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt; and radio stations document the criminal acts occurring in the city and the resulting consequences. These include the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City Police Department&lt;/a&gt; introducing helicopters, paramedics threatening to go on strike and prosecuting criminals (such as &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore Leone&lt;/a&gt; between 1998 and 2001).\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;, residents of Liberty City \"were 38% less likely to be a victim of a violent crime than the rest of the nation, unless those crimes included mugging, murder, carjacking or assault\". Whilst the Liberty Tree reports that between &lt;a href=\"2000\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt; \"part I\" offenses (murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny, grand theft auto and arson) went up 11%. They also report that \"Violent Offenses (Murder, Rape, Robbery, and Aggravated Assault) are up 73% and murder has increased four fifths from last year's 23% of what it had been previously\".\nLiberty City in \"GTA Advance\".\nThe 3D Universe rendition of Liberty City in \"Grand Theft Auto Advance\" is not entirely similar to the original version depicted in \"Grand Theft Auto III\". While the map layout remains the same, there are major changes in the world itself. This is likely due to the limitations of the &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Advance\"&gt;Game Boy Advance&lt;/a&gt;, or an oversight by &lt;a href=\"Digital%20Eclipse\"&gt;Digital Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;. For example:\nRoles in other games.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nLiberty City appears twice and is mentioned on a number of occasions during \"\", including being the setting for the &lt;a href=\"In%20The%20Beginning...\"&gt;introduction&lt;/a&gt; to the game, where the &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Boss\"&gt;Don&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sonny%20Forelli\"&gt;Sonny Forelli&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href=\"Sonny%27s%20Right-Hand%20Man\"&gt;right-hand man&lt;/a&gt; and an unnamed associate are seen in a back-room inside &lt;a href=\"Marco%27s%20Bistro\"&gt;Marco's Bistro&lt;/a&gt; discussing the future of a Forelli Crime Family soldato &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt; after he gets out of jail. Sonny Forelli appears inside Marco's Bistro again during &lt;a href=\"An%20Old%20Friend\"&gt;An Old Friend&lt;/a&gt;. The district of &lt;a href=\"Harwood\"&gt;Harwood&lt;/a&gt; is also referred to during the game, and in particular during the games &lt;a href=\"Climax\"&gt;climax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Keep%20Your%20Friends%20Close...\"&gt;Keep Your Friends Close...&lt;/a&gt;, with Sonny referring to Vercetti as \"The Harwood Butcher\". There are also several posters in the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; that mentions the phrase \"take a vacation in Liberty City\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nLiberty City appears in &lt;a href=\"The%20Introduction\"&gt;The Introduction&lt;/a&gt; DVD and during the mission &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Mark%27s%20Bistro\"&gt;Saint Mark's Bistro&lt;/a&gt;, as well as being mentioned on a number of occasions during \"\". The Introduction DVD shows the games &lt;a href=\"Protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; attempting to steal cars in the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Light%20District\"&gt;Red Light District&lt;/a&gt; and later receiving a phone call from his brother &lt;a href=\"Sean%20Johnson\"&gt;Sweet Johnson&lt;/a&gt; regarding his &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Johnson\"&gt;mother's death&lt;/a&gt; whilst in the city. After arriving back in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; for his mother's funeral, he was asked by &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt; about when he would be returning to Liberty City. Carl Johnson tells &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore Leone&lt;/a&gt; that he worked for Salvatore's son &lt;a href=\"Joey%20Leone\"&gt;Joey&lt;/a&gt; in Liberty City to gain Salvatore's trust during the mission &lt;a href=\"Freefall\"&gt;Freefall&lt;/a&gt;. The mission &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Mark%27s%20Bistro\"&gt;Saint Mark's Bistro&lt;/a&gt; involves Carl Johnson returning to Liberty City to perform a hit at &lt;a href=\"Marco%27s%20Bistro\"&gt;Marco's Bistro&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, there are some differences in terms of content, for example, the island of &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt; is somewhat larger and the neighborhoods of &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Vale\"&gt;Shoreside Vale&lt;/a&gt; are denser than in the Liberty City from \"GTA III\". There are also no road curves, as is usual in the &lt;a href=\"2D%20Universe\"&gt;2D Grand Theft Auto games&lt;/a&gt;. Other notable differences is the absence of the &lt;a href=\"Portland%20El\"&gt;Portland El&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Subway%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;Subway&lt;/a&gt;.\nInconsistencies with the original Liberty City map.\nIn \"GTA Advance\", there are many locations and businesses that are absent in both \"GTA III\" or \"GTA Liberty City Stories\". Various brands seen around the city are unique to this game, rather than the well-known recurring brands across the series. \nMany prominent locations and landmarks from \"GTA III\" are either replaced with generic buildings or stores, while others are moved to the other side of the island. In some cases, some of the landmarks are replaced with another location which makes no sense to exist. The most notable examples are &lt;a href=\"Asuka%20Kasen%27s%20Condo\"&gt;Asuka Kasen's Condo&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Newport\"&gt;Newport&lt;/a&gt; being replaced by an &lt;a href=\"Aerial%20Surveillance%20Equipment%20Factory\"&gt;Aerial Surveillance Equipment Factory&lt;/a&gt; (while the original building is moved to &lt;a href=\"Bedford%20Point\"&gt;Bedford Point&lt;/a&gt; and renamed \"&lt;a href=\"Asuka%27s%20Mansion\"&gt;Asuka's Mansion&lt;/a&gt;\"), and the &lt;a href=\"Cedar%20Ridge%20Observatory\"&gt;Cedar Ridge Observatory&lt;/a&gt; being replaced by &lt;a href=\"King%20Courtney%27s%20Warehouse\"&gt;warehouse&lt;/a&gt; owned by the &lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Yardies\"&gt;Uptown Yardies&lt;/a&gt;."}

Compared to the previous universe counterparts, the city has more detail and personality, with many places which are based on landmarks such as the &lt;a href=\"Statue%20of%20Happiness\"&gt;Statue of Happiness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Star%20Junction\"&gt;Star Junction&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Rotterdam%20Tower\"&gt;Rotterdam Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis rendition of Liberty City has versions of four of the five boroughs of , plus . is &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;, is &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;, is &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;, and is &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;. The state and city of is &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;, which is separate from Liberty City. The only borough not to be recreated in the game is . Although in the game, Liberty City appears to be an isolated set of islands, the rest of America is actually nearby. Rockstar Games stated that they avoided placing unreachable pieces of land in the distance to retain the city's \"complete\" feel.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and its two episodes (\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\") use the same full rendition of the city. However, a small number of different locations are accessible in the different episodes. \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\" uses the entire city apart from neighbouring &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney State&lt;/a&gt;, although some locations are slightly altered in terms of height and elevation for the isometric 3D perspective of the game.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", the films \"&lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28film%29\"&gt;Meltdown&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"An%20American%20Divorce\"&gt;An American Divorce&lt;/a&gt;\" produced by &lt;a href=\"Richards%20Majestic%20Productions\"&gt;Richards Majestic Productions&lt;/a&gt; are set in Liberty City.\nGeography.\nLiberty City is divided into 56 individual and unique neighbourhoods which are spread across four boroughs within Liberty City and border the neighboring state of &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20City\"&gt;Alderney City&lt;/a&gt;. Whereas the 3D Universe version of Liberty City was partly located on the mainland, the \"GTA IV\" version is completely made up of islands.\nHistory of Liberty City.\nThe earliest settlement that would eventually become Liberty City was established in &lt;a href=\"1609\"&gt;1609&lt;/a&gt;, when the Dutch hired the English explorer &lt;a href=\"Horatio%20Humboldt\"&gt;Horatio Humboldt&lt;/a&gt; to find a new location for them to sell &lt;a href=\"Weed\"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt;. Humboldt eventually sailed into the Humboldt River, which had coincidentally been named that way by the natives (according to Humboldt's account). The Dutch soon established a colony on the banks of the river and immigrants from all over Europe emigrated to the settlement find out what freedom was truly like in the colony of New Rotterdam, which promised convenience stores and public hangings, as well as the possibility of purchasing slaves thanks to a slave trade craze which swept the nascent colony ever since the first slave ship arrived. Within the span of a few years, the Dutch had become a minority in their own colony, and the East India Trading company hired &lt;a href=\"Gloria%20Hole\"&gt;Gloria Hole&lt;/a&gt; to return New Rotterdam to a \"civilised\" state. Eventually, the English took over New Rotterdam, which was based on a slender island named Algonquin after an old Indian word with the same pronunciation, after the settlers signed a petition to be ruled by the English instead of the Dutch.\nThe small colony soon expanded with the rising level of immigration, establishing settlements on three neighboring islands. The first consisted of both Broker, named after the King of England's bastard son who was conceived by a milk maid and the other Dukes, after the term Duky because the people living there smelled like excrement. Alderney was named after an American settler called Phillip D'Alderney, the only man who could bear living in the swampy industrial island. The smallest island was named Bohan after a Dutch word that meant \"Dutch word\". The British and the Americans fought in what was to be known as the American Revolution for freedom from British taxes, and after receiving a statue of a transvestite eating ice cream from the French, the Americans won and removed the Union Jack and melting the statue of King George into chains, toilet seats and gold teeth. The capitol of the young nation was soon changed to Washington D.C. and all of Liberty City's politicians moved there. The next century saw the massive immigration of the Irish into Liberty City, displacing African-Americans as the primary source of labor. The tensions between the North and South over slavery boiled over into a civil war, with riots breaking out in the city. After the end of the war, the &lt;a href=\"Subway%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;Liberty City Subway&lt;/a&gt; was constructed. At the beginning of the 20th century, the city's overcrowding, impressiveness, and grandiose, along with the invention of the automobile, allowed it to take its modern form. \nThe 21st century would host some challenges for Liberty City. A few years prior to 2008, it is implied that a terrorist attack hit the city, leaving its residents paranoid of terrorism for years to come (an analogy to the ). In the summer of 2008, a dirty bomb threat forces the closure of bridges linking Algonquin to the eastern boroughs and the neighboring state of Alderney. Experts estimate that these anti-terrorism measures force local businesses to lose \"millions of dollars a day.\" This economic impact on Liberty City creates intense public pressure for Mayor &lt;a href=\"Julio%20Ochoa\"&gt;Julio Ochoa&lt;/a&gt; to lighten his policies. Not long after the media picks up on the story, Ochoa finally caves to pressure and reopens all bridges.\nFive years later, it is stated in two internet news articles in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and by &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Shadow\"&gt;Twin Shadow&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Mirror%20Park\"&gt;Radio Mirror Park&lt;/a&gt; that Liberty City was devastated by a massive storm. During the aftermath, &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; reports that gas and electric monopolies will provide relief to victims. &lt;a href=\"Globe%20Oil\"&gt;Globe Oil&lt;/a&gt; and other petroleum companies start a fund for victims called, \"Warming hearts, not warming oceans.\" It is a campaign to debunk climate change and replace vehicles damaged in the storm. Despite their best efforts, hundreds of thousands were left without homes and vehicles. The devastating impacts enriched the automobile industry. This is an obvious reference to which hit New York and New Jersey in 2012.\nBefore the autumn of 2013, it is revealed there was a sit-in protest outside &lt;a href=\"The%20Exchange%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;The Exchange&lt;/a&gt; in Algonquin. At least &lt;a href=\"Curtis%20Weaver\"&gt;one protestor&lt;/a&gt;, likely alongside many others, were incarcerated as a result. This is a clear reference to the protest movement that began in 2011.\nCity Information.\n As of 2008, the population of Liberty City is 8,363,710. The mayor is &lt;a href=\"Julio%20Ochoa\"&gt;Julio Ochoa&lt;/a&gt; while the deputy mayor is &lt;a href=\"Bryce%20Dawkins\"&gt;Bryce Dawkins&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Stubbs%20III\"&gt;Thomas Stubbs III&lt;/a&gt; is Liberty City's congressman. The time setting is approximately late summer-early fall 2008 in \"GTA IV\" and autumn 2009 in \"GTA Chinatown Wars\".\nThe area of the city is compressed in size (as seen with the Rotterdam Tower's proximity to the Broker Bridge in the final shot), and the various landmarks are placed much closer to each other than in real life. The entire map is smaller than that of \"\", but is immensely more detailed. This made Liberty City in \"GTA IV\" the most lifelike city to feature in any \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" game at the time of release. From the massive buildings and large mass of traffic on every block of Algonquin, to residential areas of Bohan, Rockstar has successfully compromised quantity for quality, although the lack of pedestrians in normally crowded places such as Star Junction (based on Times Square) has drawn criticism.\nIn \"GTA IV\", the scaling of Liberty City as compared to New York City has a number of differences in the building heights, road distances, and landmark positions. Liberty City is also known as a shrunk version of New York City with almost everything cramped together.\nGround Zero (World Trade Center site) has been excluded from the \"GTA IV\"s Liberty City in a way that as though it does not even exist in the real life New York City while having the site replaced with the merger of buildings surrounding the Ground Zero. Liberty City is an incredibly diverse city and so are its neighbourhoods and residents. Such examples of diverse neighbourhoods include the large Russian, Italian-American, Latino and African-American populations found in various neighborhoods across the city. Liberty City's residents are known for their sarcastic attitude. The demonym of a Liberty City inhabitant is \"Libertonian\".\nHousing, Architecture and Geography.\nLiberty City has a unique geography. Firstly, it is an island city that is surrounded by water. Consisting of four different boroughs (&lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;) that are all separated by water and connected by bridge; with the exception of Broker and Dukes, which are connected by land. Smaller islands also exist around the main boroughs; including &lt;a href=\"Happiness%20Island\"&gt;Happiness Island&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Colony%20Island\"&gt;Colony Island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Charge%20Island\"&gt;Charge Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nLiberty City's housing architecture and style is a direct amalgam off of the style used in New York City. rowhouses, terraced , low-rise apartments and urban are commonplace; especially in the boroughs of &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the more affluent neighborhoods; particularly in &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;, have a higher concentration of larger single-family homes of , or style. The borough of &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; hosts many modern landmarks and skyscrapers, in fact, Liberty City boasts some of the tallest Skyscrapers in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, with the most impressive being the &lt;a href=\"Rotterdam%20Tower\"&gt;Rotterdam Tower&lt;/a&gt;. Various points of natural parkland can also be found throughout Liberty City, the largest of which being &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park\"&gt;Middle Park&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;.\nDue to the size and population demand of Liberty City, housing projects, towers and urban complexes are also commonplace throughout the various boroughs. They are, however, often stereotyped as being low-income while breeding high-crime rates, despite some housing projects in Liberty City being more affluent and having a lower crime-rate. Housing projects in Liberty City include:\nParks of Liberty City include:\nCrime.\nIt's no secret that various areas in Liberty City suffer from high crime rates; most likely brought about by the large number of gangs and criminal organizations in Liberty as well as a large underground black market in various areas - in particular the drugs trade, each fighting for control of the city and will use any means possible. &lt;a href=\"The%20Commission\"&gt;The Commission&lt;/a&gt; is an Italian-American Mafia association made up of the Five Families, which are the &lt;a href=\"Ancelotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Ancelotti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Pavano%20Family\"&gt;Pavano Family&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gambetti%20Family\"&gt;Gambetti Family&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Messina%20Family\"&gt;Messina Family&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lupisella%20Family\"&gt;Lupisella Family&lt;/a&gt;. Another mafia family called the &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%20Family\"&gt;Pegorino Family&lt;/a&gt; also exist but are not part of the Commission and primarily operate in the &lt;a href=\"state%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;state of Alderney&lt;/a&gt; as opposed to Liberty City. Aside from the Italian mafia families, there are other major crime organizations such as the &lt;a href=\"McReary%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;McReary Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Korean%20Mob\"&gt;Korean Mob&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt;.\nAside from these major big-time criminal organisations, there are, of course, many small-time local ethnic street gangs in Liberty City as well, such as the &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Mob\"&gt;Albanian Mob&lt;/a&gt;, Jamaican &lt;a href=\"Hillside%20Posse\"&gt;Hillside Posse&lt;/a&gt;, motorcycle gangs (&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt;) and various pockets of &lt;a href=\"Hustlers\"&gt;African American gangs&lt;/a&gt; (such as the &lt;a href=\"North%20Holland%20Hustlers\"&gt;North Holland Hustlers&lt;/a&gt;) as well as various Hispanic gangs such as the &lt;a href=\"Dominican%20Drug%20Cartel\"&gt;Northwood Dominican Drug Dealers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Lords\"&gt;Spanish Lords&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany of the gangs fight over the drugs trade and other businesses in Liberty City for money and power. However, after word gets out about smuggled diamonds; some of the major criminal organizations battle for possession of the diamonds too; including the &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Pegorino Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; and The Lost Motorcycle Club.\nAside from the gang violence and drug trafficking, other crimes and social problems such as prostitution, car theft, arms trafficking, economic deprivation/poverty and a little history of corruption in the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; also plague certain districts and neighborhoods. During 2008, Liberty City mayor &lt;a href=\"Julio%20Ochoa\"&gt;Julio Ochoa&lt;/a&gt; took a tough stance against gun crime by introducing gun control laws; limiting the availability of firearms. He did so primarily by shutting down &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt; stores across Liberty City. However, this campaign has proved to be generally ineffective as the sale of firearms in Liberty City appears to be booming as an underground black market; with criminal organisations, drug lords and gangs typically being heavily armed. Regardless, Ammu-Nation started a new online delivery service in Liberty City in 2009.\nBy 2009, the Triads have become the most notorious crime organization of Liberty City, after the three Triad family bosses started a &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Chinatown\"&gt;war between each other&lt;/a&gt; in order to replace the Triad leader &lt;a href=\"Hsin%20Jaoming\"&gt;Hsin Jaoming&lt;/a&gt;, who was seeking to appoint a replacement and retire. Around this time, the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20American%20Killers\"&gt;Irish American Killers&lt;/a&gt; control the &lt;a href=\"Steinway\"&gt;Steinway&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Meadows%20Park\"&gt;Meadows Park&lt;/a&gt; turf, formerly owned by the McReary Family. It is assumed that they are the same Irish crime syndicate, although renamed after most of the McReary family members vanished, as they share the same territories. A North Korean street gang called &lt;a href=\"Midtown%20Gangsters\"&gt;Midtown Gangsters&lt;/a&gt; would later take over the Albanian Mob's former territories in eastern Bohan, after the latter gang was taken down by Kenny Petrovic's Russian Mafia.\nStatistically, parts of Broker and especially Bohan are notorious for their higher crime rates, gang violence and drug trafficking market in the city. Most of the crime occurs in the deprived and run-down neighbourhoods as well as the large projects/housing complexes around Liberty City. Bohan deserves a special mention as they often outperform the other boroughs in terms of crime rate with Broker often coming in second. The many projects and housing complexes around northern Algonquin also appear to be plagued by a high crime rate. Dukes appears to be the safest borough in Liberty City due to its heavy middle/upper-class influence but still contains a minority of areas with a higher crime rate.\nCrime-for-crime, some of the most dangerous and/or deprived areas with the highest crime rate in Liberty City include:\nFood &amp; Drink.\nMuch of Liberty City's catering scene comprises fast-food chains and snack vendors. Two of the most dominant fast-food chains within the city are the &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell&lt;/a&gt; franchises. Their restaurants can be found in several locations across the city. Hot dog &lt;a href=\"vendors\"&gt;vendors&lt;/a&gt; can also be found in many locations, as well as a few hamburger vendors and mixed nuts vendors around Liberty City, particularly around &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park\"&gt;Middle Park&lt;/a&gt;.\nSports Teams.\nLiberty City, being one of the largest cities in GTA's America, is home to many major league sports franchises. The &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Swingers\"&gt;Liberty Swingers&lt;/a&gt; (based on the , and ) are the baseball team. There is one American football team, the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Wrath\"&gt;Liberty City Wrath&lt;/a&gt; (based on the and the ). There are two basketball teams, the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Penetrators\"&gt;Liberty City Penetrators&lt;/a&gt; (based on the ), and the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Warriors\"&gt;Liberty City Warriors&lt;/a&gt; (who share a name with the ), as well as a women's basketball team, the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Salamanders\"&gt;Liberty City Salamanders&lt;/a&gt;. The hockey team is the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Rampage\"&gt;Liberty City Rampage&lt;/a&gt; (who have a logo that's similar to an older logo, albeit recolored). There are also three soccer teams the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mist%20FC\"&gt;Red Mist FC&lt;/a&gt; (based on the ), the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Cocks%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City Cocks&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Beavers%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City Beavers&lt;/a&gt;.\nTransportation.\nThe main form of transport throughout Liberty City is by road, there's a fleet of &lt;a href=\"taxi\"&gt;taxi&lt;/a&gt;s throughout the city, making it easier to transport through the city fast. There is a prominent &lt;a href=\"Freeways%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;freeway&lt;/a&gt; in each borough, with two in Algonquin and another stretching from Broker to Dukes. A connects each island to &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;, with two from Algonquin to &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt; and another from &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is also an extensive &lt;a href=\"Subway%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;subway&lt;/a&gt; system, connecting the many areas of Broker, Dukes, Algonquin, and Bohan with two main routes. One serves inner Algonquin and Bohan, the other serves outer Algonquin and Broker/Dukes. The subway reaches everywhere in Liberty City, except for &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;, as it is not a part of Liberty State.\nEvery street in the new Liberty City has a name, increasing the realism (in past games, only a few rare street names were used for locations such as &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt; in \"\". The 3D Universe version of Liberty City had some street names as evidenced on the GTA III website, but none are directly referenced in any game). All the streets on each island have a meaning, for example, most streets in Broker are named after famous cowboys; streets in Dukes are named after patriotic events, and streets in Algonquin are named after minerals, chemical elements, and U.S. State Capitals.\nHelicopters can be flown either by the player or by an NPC pilot when participating in &lt;a href=\"Helitours\"&gt;Helitours&lt;/a&gt; or by using &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie's&lt;/a&gt; special ability. Liberty City has an airport in Dukes named &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International&lt;/a&gt; that receives planes from around the world. The aircraft cannot be used by the player in the game. Boats can also be used to travel between the islands.\nEducation.\nHigh Schools.\nA few high schools that are based in Liberty City can be seen on the in-game website &lt;a href=\"Hornyhighschoolreunions.com\"&gt;Hornyhighschoolreunions.com&lt;/a&gt; \nVespucci University.\n&lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20University\"&gt;Vespucci University&lt;/a&gt; is located in &lt;a href=\"Varsity%20Heights\"&gt;Varsity Heights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; and appears to be based on .\nChoice of City.\nWhen asked why &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt; decided to reuse Liberty City, &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Houser\"&gt;Dan Houser&lt;/a&gt;, Vice President of the company said: \"New York City is an environment we felt had never been done to the level we were envisioning it in a video game. From looking at all of the locations, this was the one that really stood out to us, and really had that impact. It has.\"\n\"The texture of the Algonquin streets, which are filled with crater-like potholes and occasional glimpses of the brick used in a world gone by, are greatly varied in design and something you can't tear your eye from. The visual makeup of the city was something we could capture real well and really understand the minute aspects of its personality. Trying to put that into a video game is something that we think is unique to the video game medium. It was a way that we could capture some aspects of the experience of living there that you couldn't put into a film, you couldn't put into a TV show, and you couldn't put into a book.\"\n\"A big part of New York life is walking around the streets and meeting lunatics. That's something that we definitely tried to put into the game. We are trying to give it that life and difference between the neighborhoods and the difference between the kinds of people. We are trying to capture that Capital of the World aspect of New York.\"\n\"It's not the full city, it's an approximation thereof. We make a city that feels like the real thing, but is perfectly tuned for gameplay in the broadest sense. The world is not designed to be a video game. We are trying to make a video game that feels like the world, but still plays like a video game. The design of the city and the missions that unfold within it are designed hand-in-hand and complement each other perfectly. Everything in this world is here for a reason, where it is directly tied to gameplay or simply there to create atmosphere.\"\nBeta Releases.\nThe depiction of Liberty City in the has been retouched to picture the entire city, or at least its landmass, as being larger than it is in-game. &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt; is seen extended further to the right, or east, and lights that stretch to the horizon are visible in this extended area, as well as behind Dukes and Algonquin.

It is distinguishable as a large bustling commercial/business district full of amazing towering skyscrapers and a varied composition of cultures. Some of the most high-end are located within Algonquin, including &lt;a href=\"The%20Exchange%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;The Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park%20East\"&gt;Middle Park East&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hatton%20Gardens\"&gt;Hatton Gardens&lt;/a&gt;. It is also home to the &lt;a href=\"Star%20Junction\"&gt;Star Junction&lt;/a&gt; district, a busy and vibrant commercial intersection composed of &lt;a href=\"Burlesque\"&gt;Burlesque&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Denver-Exeter%20Avenue\"&gt;Denver-Exeter Avenue&lt;/a&gt;. Some of Liberty City's most iconic sights are located within Algonquin, according to &lt;a href=\"Peep%20That%20Shit\"&gt;Peep That Shit&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Easton%20Terminal\"&gt;Grand Easton Terminal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Triangle%20Building\"&gt;Triangle Building&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zirconium%20Building\"&gt;Zirconium Building&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park\"&gt;Middle Park&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rotterdam%20Tower\"&gt;Rotterdam Tower&lt;/a&gt; and its observatory deck, \"The Top of The World\".\nBroker.\n&lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt; is the second smallest borough of Liberty City. It is situated to the south of the borough of &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt; and connected to &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Broker%20Bridge\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Algonquin%20Bridge\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; bridges. The majority of its are gritty, run down, and industrial; however, in some cases, gentrification is common. In other districts, like &lt;a href=\"Outlook\"&gt;Outlook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rotterdam%20Hill\"&gt;Rotterdam Hill&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"South%20Slopes\"&gt;South Slopes&lt;/a&gt;, a diverse upper and lower middle-class population of yuppies, immigrants, business-people, working-class, and hipsters resides.\nAccording to the documentary &lt;a href=\"A%20History%20of%20Liberty%20City\"&gt;A History of Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"CNT\"&gt;CNT&lt;/a&gt;, Broker is named after Sir William Broker III. He was the king's bastard son that was conceived by a milk maid.\nDukes.\n&lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt; consists of nine, large, heavily-populated . The character of Dukes varies considerably across its neighborhoods. It has the most green space out of all the boroughs in Liberty City which is particularly concentrated around the districts in the north of the borough such as &lt;a href=\"Meadows%20Park\"&gt;Meadows Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Willis\"&gt;Willis&lt;/a&gt;, and western parts of &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. The income of Dukes itself overall could be described as middle class, as it also could be considered the most suburban out of all four boroughs. The main urbanized district of the borough is East Island City which is centered around the &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20Boulevard\"&gt;Dukes Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; thoroughfare. It contains both modern business land use. It consists of a Bank of Liberty chain, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Union%20of%20Contemporary%20Arts\"&gt;National Union of Contemporary Arts&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"LC24\"&gt;LC24&lt;/a&gt; Tower in addition to declining industrial areas in the neighborhood's southern reaches and Beechwood City, which also merges with Broker. Charge Island is Dukes' other industrial centered local.\nFrancis International Airport is Dukes' and Liberty City's largest district, and obviously serves as the center for aviation in Liberty City.\nAccording to the documentary &lt;a href=\"A%20History%20of%20Liberty%20City\"&gt;A History of Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"CNT\"&gt;CNT&lt;/a&gt;, Dukes name was derived from the word dookie because the people smelled like shit.\nBohan.\n&lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt; is the smallest of Liberty City's boroughs. It appears to be the most deprived and in the state of decline, with the borough mainly consisting of run-down housing projects, pockets of small-time businesses and shops that have presumably failed shortly after their establishment. Abandoned buildings and decrepit warehouses are a common sight in Bohan, with notable examples in &lt;a href=\"South%20Bohan\"&gt;South Bohan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fortside\"&gt;Fortside&lt;/a&gt;. Whilst there is often evidence of gentrification in other deprived districts across Liberty City, there is very little evidence of it in these neighborhoods with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Gardens\"&gt;Northern Gardens&lt;/a&gt;. It is also home to a large industrial area, namely so, &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Industrial&lt;/a&gt;. The area consists of small warehouses and several construction sites, as well as access to small docking areas around the southern peninsular. \nThe population of Bohan are mainly of Latin American origin; this population trend is particularly concentrated around Puerto Rican South Bohan and Dominican Fortside. Other ethnic enclaves include the predominant African-American demographic of Northern Gardens and an Albanian presence in Little Bay.\nDistricts.\nEach of Liberty City's 56 districts is identified both on the physical copy of the \"GTA IV\" map and on the in-game HUD and map.\nStreets.\nAlgonquin.\nUnique to Algonquin, streets and avenues are assigned a grid-like system which gives many benefits, including better navigation and transport systems and provides a more effective layout for buildings and structures. The city's avenues distribute districts with smaller blocks of buildings and serve as a functional and practical way of traveling longitudinally through the island's long, narrow shape. When taking Algonquin's 25 streets and seven avenues into account, it can be calculated that there are 144 blocks in Algonquin's grid system; this does not include the minor roads that are located in and around the grid.\nFrom east to west, Algonquin is based upon the following avenues:\nAvenues in Algonquin are named alphabetically from east to west, spanning from A to G, and are named after state capitals, former of current, of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpanning horizontally are streets. Almost all streets are 2-lane, 1-way flowing traffic lanes, with each alternating street running the opposite direction, starting with the southern-most street, &lt;a href=\"Amethyst%20Street\"&gt;Amethyst Street&lt;/a&gt;, flowing east, &lt;a href=\"Barium%20Street\"&gt;Barium Street&lt;/a&gt; flowing west, etc. &lt;a href=\"Garnet%20Street\"&gt;Garnet Street&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kunzite%20Street\"&gt;Kunzite Street&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Topaz%20Street\"&gt;Topaz Street&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park\"&gt;Middle Park&lt;/a&gt; span of &lt;a href=\"Quartz%20Street\"&gt;Quartz Street&lt;/a&gt; flow on both directions. The former three are examples of 4-lane streets. Algonquin's streets are arranged alphabetically from A to X and from south to north. These streets are named after minerals. \nOther named streets are named after their surroundings, passing or shape, such as &lt;a href=\"Flatfish%20Place\"&gt;Flatfish Place&lt;/a&gt;'s proximity with the &lt;a href=\"Fishmarket%20South\"&gt;Fishmarket South&lt;/a&gt; district, or &lt;a href=\"Cavity%20Lane\"&gt;Cavity Lane&lt;/a&gt;'s twisted, narrow shape within a street block. &lt;a href=\"Union%20Drive%20East\"&gt;Union Drive East&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Union%20Drive%20West\"&gt;Union Drive West&lt;/a&gt; serve as major highways on the east and west sides of the island respectively. \nConnecting Algonquin to neighboring islands and boroughs are a series of bridges and tunnels. These provide a vital connection between the boroughs and can carry a large amount of traffic at once. \nThe following bridges and tunnels connect to Algonquin:\nStreet Features.\nTraffic Lights.\nThe majority of traffic lights in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;GTA IV&lt;/a&gt;\" are based on &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.mccain-inc.com/\"&gt;McCain traffic signals&lt;/a&gt;, the iconic yellow-style traffic lights used across New York City.\nTraffic lights operate as intended and in accordance with the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic-light_signalling_and_operation\"&gt;United States signalling and operation standards&lt;/a&gt;. When signaled red, traffic will stop, when signaled green, traffic is allowed to move, and when amber, traffic prepares to stop. Traffic lights do not flash amber in any occurrence in-game.\nMost traffic signals can be destroyed, in a similar way to street lights. The main light pole itself can often be broken away from its road mounting, disabling the traffic light and producing sparks. The light will then fall and as a result, each section will break apart. AI traffic will behave as if the traffic light is still functioning and operate as normal.\nTraffic signals hung from a boom are able to swing. They can be seen swinging back and forth in any weather condition, but much faster and aggressively in wind and rainy conditions.\nAll traffic lights systems operate at the same speed and do not consider traffic flow or congestion. A red light will take 10 seconds to change to green, and 12 seconds (including orange) to change back to red.\nVarious traffic light poles also have pedestrian signals attached. These iconic devices are built-in yellow boxes attached to the main pole just above human reach. On the box is a black display featuring a hand and a walking human. The hand will light up red when pedestrians are advised not to cross due to crossing traffic, and the walking human will display white when it is safe to cross.\nThe typical intersection layout varies by location, Algonquin being vastly different from the rest of the city. Small intersections around &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt; usually consist of a single traffic light with the respective number of traffic signals on it, while &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;'s grid system and repetitive string of one-way streets results in the majority of intersections consisting of three traffic lights; two single poles for two-way flowing traffic on the avenue, and a large dual-lane pole for the one-way flowing street.\nAs already noted, traffic behaves as expected with traffic lights, however the advanced level of AI pathing can often cause a variety of notable repercussions often caused or dependent on timing between the signal change and flowing traffic. Fast flowing AI traffic approaching a green-turning-red traffic signal will usually halt at the last minute, but depending on the speed the AI vehicle was travelling, a vehicle which stops after the stop-line often proceeds with their journey having stopped, ignoring the red light. The same occurs in the reverse situation, fast flowing AI traffic approaching a red-turning-green traffic signal will halt and continue. Traffic usually does not become inpatient with long-lasting traffic jams caused by traffic lights and vehicles will not normally jump red lights.\nTaxi drivers who are told to \"hurry up\" by the player will jump red lights, avoiding traffic by simply driving on the other side of the road through the intersection. Distressed pedestrians will also ignore red lights, for example, if they recover a stolen vehicle from the player, or are disturbed by surrounding explosions or gunfire (unless they leave their vehicle). Responding emergency vehicles will ignore traffic lights, however their responding AI, particularly of &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ambulances&lt;/a&gt; also often causes collisions with other vehicles, pedestrians and road-side props.\nPedestrians will also behave correctly with pedestrian signals. Approaching the crosswalk, they will only cross when the signal displays the white figure, unless distressed, or physically pushed into the road. The white figure displays when the opposing traffic flow does not intersect with the crosswalk, however, due to a minor oversight with signal behavior and limitations, the lack of a turning filter often causes traffic to almost or completely run down pedestrians when turning; this is most notable at box intersections when crossing pedestrians are safe to cross, but turning traffic makes it unsafe. Pedestrians will react to the situation, both parties often insulting each other, before carrying on with their day. This oversight is present on almost every single intersection in Liberty City.\nPedestrians will also hurry quickly when the light begins to flash (indicating that traffic will begin to start). This light flashes at the last 2 seconds of the 12 second window they have to cross.\nThere are 11 different traffic light models in-game.\nTraffic Lights\nPedestrian Lights"}

The Liberty City Cathedral resembles the iconic in New York City. Due to this close resemblance, it is possible that the Liberty City Cathedral was based upon the real-life St. Patrick's. The cathedral is implied to be Catholic, as Protestants do not practice confession; further implications towards it being a Catholic cathedral come from the burials of storyline characters in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" who come from traditionally Catholic (&lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt;) backgrounds. The building has three identically designed frontages, each facing south, east, and west. An interior of the cathedral is further included for the \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" rendition for use in missions (see &lt;a href=\"%23Prominent%20roles\"&gt;Prominent roles&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Cemetery\"&gt;a large cemetery&lt;/a&gt; (also known as the garden) exists as a corner plot next to the cathedral. As the game's storyline progresses, the cemetery is increasingly occupied by graves of certain characters which the player is responsible for killing, such as &lt;a href=\"Paulie%20Sindacco\"&gt;Paulie Sindacco&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vincenzo%20Cilli\"&gt;Vincenzo Cilli&lt;/a&gt;. It is revealed on &lt;a href=\"Chatterbox%20FM\"&gt;Chatterbox&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Free%20Radio\"&gt;Liberty City Free Radio&lt;/a&gt; in \"Liberty City Stories\", however, that a lobby exists to have a &lt;a href=\"Bedford%20Point%20Opera%20House\"&gt;large square concrete building&lt;/a&gt; (complete with state of the art electronic facilities) built over the cemetery as a counterbalance to the seemingly imposing cathedral. Indeed, this serves as a retcon for \"GTA III\" that explains why a large but stark concrete building exists next to the cathedral. The loss of the cemetery meant the cathedral in \"GTA III\" is left with only a thin strip of burial ground on the cathedral's north side.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nAt the cathedral, &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni&lt;/a&gt; can access the Confessional missions for Father Ned, a priest who runs the church. When the player has completed all the Confessional missions, Father Ned reveals himself to be &lt;a href=\"Ned%20Burner\"&gt;Ned Burner&lt;/a&gt;, an ace news reporter who tricked Toni into creating chaos in the city for him to report on. Toni later gets vengeance on Ned and &lt;a href=\"Stop%20the%20Press\"&gt;kills him&lt;/a&gt; under orders from &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt; after the former witnessed the &lt;a href=\"Panlantic%20Land%20Grab\"&gt;murder&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Avery%20Carrington\"&gt;Avery Carrington&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn \"GTA Advance\", the film star &lt;a href=\"Biff%20Rock\"&gt;Biff Rock&lt;/a&gt; uses the cathedral as a &lt;a href=\"Scorned%20Lover\"&gt;set for his movie&lt;/a&gt;."}

The strikes were caused by the uncertainty of the continuation of the Liberty City &lt;a href=\"ferry\"&gt;ferry&lt;/a&gt; services.\nDescription.\nThe strikes first emerged when the corrupt &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Trade%20Union\"&gt;Liberty City Trade Union&lt;/a&gt; boss &lt;a href=\"Jane%20Hopper\"&gt;Jane Hopper&lt;/a&gt; encouraged the ferry workers to fight against the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Callahan%20Bridge\"&gt;Callahan Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and the proposed extensions to the &lt;a href=\"Porter%20Tunnel\"&gt;Porter Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;.

Hopper betrays Salvatore and her strikers begin to attack the mafia if they come in contact.\nEffects.\nThe strikes have many effects on the early stages of the game. At first, the strikers are positioned at the &lt;a href=\"Harwood\"&gt;Harwood&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Harwood%20Ferry%20Terminal\"&gt;Ferry Terminal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Harbor\"&gt;Portland Docks&lt;/a&gt;.

In the mission \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Offer\"&gt;The Offer&lt;/a&gt;\", Salvatore assigns Toni to send cash to Hopper knowing that he has no alternative option. Hopper takes the cash as a 'donation' and unsuccessfully orders her strikers to attack Toni.\nHopper's Defeat.\nFurther angered by Hopper's attacks on Toni and her on-air radio insults of himself, Salvatore orders Toni to &lt;a href=\"Rollercoaster%20Ride\"&gt;scare&lt;/a&gt; Hopper into his control. Toni kills Hopper's chauffeur and disguises himself as him to steal Hopper's limo. Toni then drives frantically to scare Hopper who in turn follows Salvatore's orders to use the docks to get drugs to Portland.\nLift Bridge Blockade.\nAfter the strikes in &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt; are terminated, a portion of the uncompleted Callahan Bridge has been built into a large ramp allowing full access to &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Lift%20Bridge\"&gt;Shoreside Lift Bridge&lt;/a&gt; however, is closed due to further protests about the future of the Liberty City Ferry Service.

The strikers here are still considerably aggressive and attempt to prevent the player from accessing the closed bridge, and will still attack Toni.\nEnding.\nThe strikes came to a close after Toni &lt;a href=\"A%20Walk%20in%20the%20Park\"&gt;assassinates&lt;/a&gt; the corrupted mayor Roger C. Hole, during a jog in &lt;a href=\"Belleville%20Park\"&gt;Belleville Park&lt;/a&gt;.

Members of the LCGC believe that if every citizen was armed, no one would be \"dumb enough to shoot anybody\", a notion that they claim the founding fathers of the United States believed in when they drafted the country's Constitution.\nThe LCGC's advertising is very similar to those of Ammu-Nation in earlier games, featuring the rugged voice of an American man, arguing large purchases of firearms while getting drunk is the American way. It also copies elements of advertising from previous Ammu-Nation advertising, such as the association of women's breasts with guns.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\", the Liberty City Gun Club is located near &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, to the south of the &lt;a href=\"Willis%20Wash%20and%20Lube\"&gt;Willis Wash and Lube&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;Pay 'n' Spray&lt;/a&gt; and east of the &lt;a href=\"Hi-Way%20Tire%20Co.\"&gt;Hi-Way Tire Co.&lt;/a&gt; street racing point.

There are a total of 5 courses, each related to a specific class of firearms. If the player achieves a gold medal for all 5 courses, they receive a discount for weapon purchases from Ammu-Nation.\nThe rules of the courses are as applied:\nGallery.\nVideo"}

{"id": "95296", "revid": "54312061", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=95296", "title": "Liberty City National Exchange", "text": "The Liberty City National Exchange (LCN) is one of two stock exchanges available in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", the other being &lt;a href=\"BAWSAQ\"&gt;BAWSAQ&lt;/a&gt;.\nWebsite.\nlcn-exchange.com is the official website of the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20National%20Exchange\"&gt;Liberty City National Exchange&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\". The player can use the website to invest in stocks in various businesses.\nTo gain money using the LCN stock market, the player will need to predict the trends. To do this, the player will have to look at the maximum and minimum value of any stock, then watch the graph on the left and the actual value of the stock on the right. Using this, the player can predict how the stock will perform over time.\nThe stocks always have a peak (the moment the stocks reach their highest values) and a decline (the moment the stocks reach their lowest values), the period between a peak and a decline is called a \"contraction\". It is during this period that the player must buy stocks. After this period, there will always be an \"expansion\" period, duing which the stock recovers the value of the previous peak and then thrives to a new maximum value. It is during this period that the player must sell their stocks.\nLCN stocks can grow or fall really fast. It is possible to lose or gain 20% of the stock value in half a day. It is recommended to always buy at the minimum value (decline) and sell at the maximum value (peak). \nCorporate Rivals.\nThe LCN market is full of rival companies. The player should never invest in direct competitors. Since each stock rivals each other, they will be the opposite in stock success. If one company is doing very well and the stocks of its rival are significantly down, expect the tables to flip should the player invest in the failing stock as it will very likely shoot up while the previous successful company's stocks will plummet. For example, if &lt;a href=\"Cool%20Beans\"&gt;Cool Beans&lt;/a&gt; is up by 9% and &lt;a href=\"Bean%20Machine\"&gt;Bean Machine&lt;/a&gt; is down by 9%, investing in Bean Machine will result in more of a profit as Cool Beans will plummet, as it cannot go up forever. However, Bean Machine will likely shoot up in just 10 in-game hours. However, this is risky.\nPlayers must not waste their time with rumors according to which if FlyUS planes are blown up, AirEmu stocks will go up or likewise, as they are confirmed to be fake. Any profits must be quick saved through the phone, while advancing time must be done by saving in the bed, but exiting with B or Circle, for whichever console is used, so that time will advance, but it will not be saved. If the player's portfolio shows owned stocks to be plummeting, the game must be reloaded, so it will be at the time before sleeping (when the player had profits in their portfolio) and then sell immediately. This can be boring, but it will stop failures and ensure maximum profit. (Alternatively, one can quick save before investing and then invest in something else if their last investment had them stuck on money loss, but the stocks might change before reloading if no shares are saved on the file. This will essentially waste time and isn't recommended. Observing how stocks go up and down by quick saving and sleeping without purchasing will not work. The evolution of stocks is better predicted by having them purchased and then checking on them after quick saving and sleeping.)\nAugury Insurance can fluctuate between -30% and +30%, generating the same profits as some Assassination Missions. Different news pieces can be seen for stocks such as 'World gulping eCola on record level, stocks rise', but these are random and change each time the player reloads, which can give them an edge for predictions, but can be very dangerous at the same time.\nInfluence.\nLiberty City National Exchange (LCN) is based on the\u00a0real life (NYSE), the largest stock exchange in the modern day world."}

They keep track on the criminal elements in Liberty City. In &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt; they were tracking &lt;a href=\"Vincenzo%20Cilli\"&gt;Vincenzo Cilli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore Leone&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt; they continued to track Toni and Salvatore, but also concentrated on &lt;a href=\"Joey%20Leone\"&gt;Joey Leone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Luigi%20Goterelli\"&gt;Luigi Goterelli&lt;/a&gt; along with investigating the gang problems in the city. The LCPD appears to be under funded by Mayor &lt;a href=\"Miles%20O%27Donovan\"&gt;Miles O'Donovan&lt;/a&gt;, as they only received helicopters in April 2001.&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.rockstargames.com/libertytree/apr2001/story2.html\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This creates an inconsistency, as in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" (which takes place in &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;) the LCPD freely uses as many helicopters as necessary when chasing down the player.\nLeon McAffrey was a corrupt police officer, who was involved in selling stories to &lt;a href=\"Ned%20Burner\"&gt;Ned Burner&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt; newspaper and in helping various gangs. The first can be seen on the \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.rockstargames.com/libertycitystories/gta_lcs.html\"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, whereas the second can be seen during \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" (as he helps the Leone Family and the &lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Yardies\"&gt;Uptown Yardies&lt;/a&gt;). An investigation was launched into the corruption within the LCPD, and McAffrey is placed under arrest.\nRay Machowski, another corrupt police officer, was straight but later became a corrupt officer under the influence of McAffrey. He began to work with the &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt;, but in 2001, Leon McAffrey threatened to turn state evidence against him. He employed &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Plaster%20Blaster\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; McAffrey and then assisted him in Ray's escape from the city. Moreover, Ray also had a partner that he suspected of being a rat, so he hired Claude to &lt;a href=\"Gone%20Fishing\"&gt;take him down&lt;/a&gt; as well.\nTanner was working undercover as a driver for the Yakuza, until &lt;a href=\"Asuka%20Kasen\"&gt;Asuka Kasen&lt;/a&gt; figured out his true colours. Claude was ordered to &lt;a href=\"Two-Faced%20Tanner\"&gt;kill him&lt;/a&gt;.\nDivisions.\nSpecial Weapons and Tactics.\nThe police department houses a &lt;a href=\"Special%20Weapons%20and%20Tactics\"&gt;Special Weapons and Tactics&lt;/a&gt;, which appears at the four-star wanted level. These highly trained officers travel in fours in the fast and durable &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;, wielding &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Uzi&lt;/a&gt;s. They will spawn alongside the police cruisers in four-star-wanted level. In \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", when the player stays in one place at a four-star wanted level, S.W.A.T. officers will rappel down from the police helicopters. They are lethal to a player on-foot, even with &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, and can destroy a car in a matter of seconds.The S.W.A.T. team is based in the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20SWAT%20Headquarters\"&gt;Liberty City SWAT Headquarters&lt;/a&gt;, located next to the &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island%20Police%20Headquarters\"&gt;Staunton Island Police Headquarters&lt;/a&gt;.\nStations.\nLCPD stations can be found in the following places:\nEquipment.\nUniforms.\nIn \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", LCPD officers wear uniforms consisting of a navy blue jacket over their uniform with their gold badge in the front and long navy blue pants. LCPD officers also have a navy blue cap with a gold cap badge on the front. The shirt color is black in \"GTA III\" and blue in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\".\nVehicles.\nThe LCPD's vehicle of choice tends to be the \"&lt;a href=\"Police%20Car\"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt;\", a generic squad car, and a police helicopter (which appears an &lt;a href=\"Police%20Helicopter%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;unnamed and uncontrollable police helicopter&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA III\", and a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\"), and the &lt;a href=\"Predator\"&gt;Predator&lt;/a&gt; for maritime pursuits. The SWAT branch operates &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe livery of the police car varies between the three games. In \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Advance\", police cars are depicted with a panda-like black and white color scheme, which looks similar to the LAPD livery. The police car in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", however, features a black body and white roof, with a pair of horizontal white strips. The \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" renditions feature \"LCPD\" and \"Police\" text on the sides, and the trunk and boot lids, respectively.\nWeapons.\nThe standard weapon of the LCPD in all of the \"GTA III\" era games is the &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt;, which in \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Advance\" is based on an M1911, and the Glock 17 in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\". Note that in some missions, they use different weapons: for example, some officers carry &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Shotgun\"&gt;shotguns&lt;/a&gt; in GTA III's mission &lt;a href=\"Decoy\"&gt;Decoy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;SMGs&lt;/a&gt; in Liberty City Stories' mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Guns%20of%20Leone\"&gt;The Guns of Leone&lt;/a&gt;.\nDevelopment.\nIn the beta versions of \"GTA III\", the LCPD had a much different appearance. Vehicles (the police car, and the Enforcer) had a blue-white color scheme, based on the color scheme used by the NYPD during the 1990s. Officers originally had mustaches; there was also an &lt;a href=\"Military\"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt; helicopter (which would eventually become the &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;) that may have been used alongside of the LCPD in higher wanted levels.\nThe blue and white colors were reminiscent to that of the NYPD, which the LCPD is based on. Changes were made after the 9/11 attacks, likely out of respect for the emergency personnel who responded to the tragedy. However, the blue-white scheme on the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Helicopter%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;helicopters&lt;/a&gt; is still used in the game. The beta LCPD still appears in the instruction manual of the original PS2 version. There is also an unused LCPD skin in the game files.\nDuring the development of \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", the LCPD were originally going to use the baby-blue/white color scheme as well as the template used in the 1990s by the NYPD. However, at some point in development, the color scheme was changed back to black and white, but the template still remained.\nProminent Appearances in Missions.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nNote: Unlike other gang appearances, police appears in almost all missions of \"GTA III\" if the player commits a crime during the mission. This is the mission appearance list for the police appearing without the player committing an unnecessary crime."}
{"id": "23790", "revid": "25295528", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=23790", "title": "Liberty City Police Department (HD Universe)", "text": "The Liberty City Police Department (LCPD) is the of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;State of Alderney&lt;/a&gt; (only in &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;) in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe LCPD is based on the .\nOverview.\nThe Liberty City Police Department has around 40,000 police officers who each serve many different roles, most notably \"walking the beat\" on patrol all throughout &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. They reign in a \"complete operational\" status over Liberty City, meaning they are the primary law enforcement organization in the city even if the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; have a presence there. The LCPD is organized into different divisions. \nThe Aviation Unit of the LCPD has a fleet of &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;s that are on constant patrol. Aviation assistance can be summoned from one of the four police stations with aviation facilities. The Police Mavericks can be seen often in the skies of Liberty City, most often patrolling with &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt;s above major bridges such as the &lt;a href=\"Hickey%20Bridge\"&gt;Hickey Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"East%20Borough%20Bridge\"&gt;East Borough Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, looking for potential signs of terrorism.\nThe LCPD is known for its very \"aggressive\" techniques in pursuing crime, most notably saturating a high-crime area (or one or more individuals committing several crimes in short succession) with dozens of police officers and patrol cars. They take the famous NYPD rationale of having a large police presence, ensuring prevention of and a quick response to crime. In times of emergency, they respond appropriately and pour all available resources into stopping or containing an incident, including NOOSE and/or FIB backup.\nThe LCPD, along with the NOOSE and the FIB, become extremely aggressive when the player is wanted and continue to use deadly force against player even after the protagonist has died and \"&lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;grayed out&lt;/a&gt;\". LCPD officers are sometimes seen writing tickets (as noticed around &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park\"&gt;Middle Park&lt;/a&gt; and in Highway Patrol duties on the various bridges where they await speeders). LCPD officers on foot patrol are sometimes seen chasing and apprehending criminals at gunpoint; after they are cornered by the pursuing officer(s), a marked police car is contacted to take the criminal away for processing.\nDespite their aggressive response if the player commits a crime, the LCPD can also assist the player if they are attacked by other NPCs. Running past a police officer while another NPC gives chase, or being hit/shot by an NPC while an officer is nearby will result in the officer attempting to take out or arrest the offending NPC, often recruiting other officers nearby in the process.\nThe LCPD is also on an active recruiting campaign, with \"Join The LCPD\" posters and billboards at select locations throughout the city and adorning the front of the LCPD &lt;a href=\"The%20Triangle\"&gt;Triangle&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Star%20Junction\"&gt;Star Junction&lt;/a&gt; subway station, (which is in front of a Liberty City services booth). They also appear in the streets if the player dials 911 to summon a Police Vehicle with two police officers inside. The front passenger will check around for any incidents, while the police officer in the Police Vehicle will remain in it unless an emergency occurs. However, if there is nothing happening, the front passenger will return to the Police Vehicle. The front passenger will also tell the driver that nothing happened. The same thing occurs to the driver if nothing happened while he is reaching the Police Vehicle.\nIf an assailant is confirmed to commit a crime (either via being reported to the police by civilians or being directly sighted by police) or attacks a police officer responding to a 911 call, two officers from a police vehicle (and other police officers in the immediate area), wielding &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;s, will pursue the criminal and attempt to catch him. Responding officers always draw their sidearms when faced with a suspect. If there are not any criminals around, they will get back inside their cruiser and leave or, in case of officers on foot patrol, continue walking.\nUnlike civilians, who report crimes via the telephone (a lengthy process), police sightings are reported immediately. Further crimes, such as attacking a police officer, and evading arrest will increase the player's Wanted Level. They can even respond to crimes out of their sight, as &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;civilians&lt;/a&gt; can call the police on their &lt;a href=\"Cell%20phone\"&gt;cell phones&lt;/a&gt; to report crimes.\nWhen the player reaches two stars, additional police vehicles are sent to the area, and the officers in the front passenger seats of the vehicles will step out wielding &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Shotgun\"&gt;Pump Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;s (if fit cops are spotted).\nAt three stars, the NOOSE \"Patriotism and Immigration Authority\" will join the fight with &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Patriot\"&gt;NOOSE Patriot&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Cruiser\"&gt;NOOSE Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s with LCPD officers firing on the player with shotguns and pistols, as well as a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; to oversee the scene and follow fleeing suspects. The helicopters will have two LCPD riflemen equipped with &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt;s (or &lt;a href=\"M249\"&gt;Advanced MGs&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\") and an LCPD pilot on board; the riflemen will engage the suspect on sight. The front passengers of the NOOSE patrol vehicles will also wield shotguns (if fit cops are spotted).\nAt four stars, instead of LCPD officers in a Police Maverick, the same helicopter is deployed with two NOOSE \"Tactical Response Unit\" riflemen with Carbine Rifles or Advanced MGs, and a NOOSE pilot. On the ground, the police will deploy &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;s carrying four NOOSE Tactical Response Unit officers and/or &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Buffalo\"&gt;FIB Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;s carrying four FIB agents; both of these are equipped with body armor, Carbine Rifles, &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;SMGs&lt;/a&gt;, and Pump Shotguns (as well as &lt;a href=\"Assault%20SMG\"&gt;Assault SMG&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Automatic%20Shotgun\"&gt;Automatic Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;s in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\"), with Pistols carried as a backup weapon.\nAt five and six stars, two NOOSE Annihilators are deployed carrying two NOOSE Tactical Response Unit riflemen with the same Carbine Rifles or Advanced MGs and a NOOSE pilot on board, and Enforcers and/or FIB Buffalos will continue to be sent in alongside regular police officers. Also at five and six stars, the LCPD, NOOSE and FIB will start to shoot out of their vehicles.\nTypes of Officers.\nThere are two types of police officers that vary in their appearance and how they use the assigned equipment listed below:\nStructure.\nSenior management.\nPolice Commissioner\nDeputy Police Commissioner\nDeputy Commissioner for Public Affairs\nNarcotics Agent\nList of Police Stations.\nLiberty City.\nThe LCPD is large and organized, possessing 5 Borough stations and 13 Police Stations throughout Liberty City.\nDialogue.\nLCPD officers can be heard shouting while on a pursuit, be it on foot, in a vehicle, or even at sea. The police scanner also reports crimes in detail, reporting type of crime, its approximate location and heading, the type of person involved, the color, make and model of vehicles involved, and the status of the crime. LCPD officers also operate megaphones inside their vehicles, including the &lt;a href=\"Predator\"&gt;Predator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;.\nEquipment.\nVehicles.\nIn \"GTA IV\", LCPD officers on the streets commonly drive two variants of police cars: the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Patrol\"&gt;Police Patrol&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;. These serve as their vehicles of choice when the player reaches a one-to-three-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, and will continue to appear in conjunction with &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; forces in a four-star wanted level or higher. In \"\", the LCPD only uses the Police Patrol (although game art of both the Police Patrol and Police Cruiser are still used when the player is &lt;a href=\"Busted\"&gt;Busted&lt;/a&gt;), and only appears up to a four-star wanted level (alongside &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;NOOSE Enforcers&lt;/a&gt;), as the FIB takes over at five stars.\nThe LCPD also extends their authority in the air in \"GTA IV\" with the use of &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;s, which commonly patrol the sky even when the player does not have a wanted level. Police Mavericks will occasionally join a one- or two-star wanted level when they happen to be within close proximity of the player, but the helicopter is certain to appear only when the player has a three-star wanted level with LCPD riflemen armed with &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifles\"&gt;Carbine Rifles&lt;/a&gt; and an LCPD pilot; however, at four stars, the Police Maverick will come with two NOOSE Tactical Response Unit Officers riflemen as well as a NOOSE Tactical Response Unit pilot if the NOOSE TRU is deployed. The &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt; takes over from five to six stars onward, with the LCPD using them at five and six stars if FIB is deployed. If the NOOSE is deployed at five and six stars, a NOOSE pilot and riflemen armed with Carbine Rifles will use the Annihilator.\nAt sea, the LCPD is equipped with &lt;a href=\"Predator\"&gt;Police Predators&lt;/a&gt;, which appear when the player has three stars or more. The boats carry a police officer that pursues the player, with two police officers armed with Carbine Rifles at the back who will use deadly force against the player. In \"GTA Chinatown Wars\", however, the Predator is replaced with the &lt;a href=\"Coast%20Guard%20Launch\"&gt;Coast Guard Launch&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\" also includes two more LCPD-marked Vehicles, the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser%20%28Buffalo%29\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; (named \"Police Cruiser\" in-game) and the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Bike\"&gt;Police Bike&lt;/a&gt;, a police motorcycle. Neither vehicle is used by LCPD officers, and they are only available in the Multiplayer of \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\". A third police vehicle, the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Stinger\"&gt;Police Stinger&lt;/a&gt;, does not bear the LCPD's signature blue-and-white livery but does bear the LCPD's logo. The Police Stinger is also not used by the LCPD officers in-game as a pursuit vehicle.\nIt should be noted that for the first time in the series, LCPD officers will not hesitate to commandeer civilian vehicles, should no police vehicles be available to them. If necessary, the LCPD will take any ground vehicle, regardless of its performance or speed. This means that if the player enters areas such as &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, they may find themselves being pursued by an officer who has commandeered a &lt;a href=\"Ripley\"&gt;Ripley&lt;/a&gt; or even an &lt;a href=\"Airtug\"&gt;Airtug&lt;/a&gt;. They can also ride in the back of a police patrol or cruiser with other officers if there are no vehicles to drive.\nWeapons and other portable equipment.\nThe LCPD Officers carry a range of equipment on their gun belts and in their cars. A collapsible baton is in place on the officers' gun belts, but the police officers do not utilize the weapon at all in-game. The baton is reinstated in the \"\" rendition of the LCPD. The Department-issue police firearm is the &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;. This is used when making felony arrests, pursuing suspects, and in self-defense against a deadly threat. If a police officer is disarmed, they may resort to using their fists to defend themselves. If police officers are patrolling in a Police Cruiser or a Police Patrol (patrol vehicles always have two police officers onboard), and the suspect has a two-star wanted level or higher, fit police officers will carry the &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Shotgun\"&gt;Pump Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; with eight shells in the magazine tube.\nPolice officers who are guarding high-security places such as the &lt;a href=\"Statue%20of%20Happiness\"&gt;Statue of Happiness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Civilization%20Committee\"&gt;Civilization Committee&lt;/a&gt; Headquarters, and the &lt;a href=\"Rotterdam%20Tower\"&gt;Rotterdam Tower&lt;/a&gt; will carry Carbines, which is a good deterrent of both terrorist activity and everyday crime. Police riflemen will also carry Carbines when riding a Maverick or Annihilator, though they can also use Advanced MGs for this purpose as evidenced in \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\". When the suspect has a five-star wanted level or more, the LCPD will deploy snipers to shoot the player with &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Sniper\"&gt;Combat Sniper&lt;/a&gt;s from some rooftops, specifically those in &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Exchange%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;The Exchange&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Shotgun\"&gt;Combat Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;s are also adopted by the department but are never seen in action except in &lt;a href=\"The%20Snow%20Storm\"&gt;The Snow Storm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Museum%20Piece\"&gt;Museum Piece&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, they remain inside their police cars, likely as a weapon for situations where a pistol will not be enough.\nThe LCPD officers also carry personal radios in order to report crimes and call for assistance and backup; they can sometimes be seen talking into them while patrolling, as can &lt;a href=\"Security%20Guard\"&gt;security guards&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlso, in \"\", the LCPD was in a partnership with &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt;, in order to give away cash for old and/or used weapons of any type (all of those that &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20in%20GTA%20Chinatown%20Wars\"&gt;appeared in the game&lt;/a&gt;) as shown in the game booklet.\nUniforms.\nDepending on the in-game weather, police officers on foot will wear different uniforms, such as a raincoat with LCPD in yellow at the back and a white hat cover. Officers in vehicles can wear any outfit type, but will always have a white hat cover. However, some police officers can wear a raincoat with a police hat that doesn't have a white hat cover. This is most apparent during scripted mission appearances such as Three-Leaf Clover. Officers at stations, most notably one inside the East Holland Police Station's helipad access stairway, can have this appearance as well. Officers at tollbooths and borough roadblocks may wear raincoats despite the in-game weather. Fit officers always display their shield-style badge on their left breast except when covered by a raincoat. \nThe uniforms of fit police officers are generally navy blue with black buttons and navy-blue shoes. Police officers can wear either a long-sleeve shirt with a coat, captain's collar pins and tie, the same but without a coat and pins, or a short-sleeve shirt with a long-sleeve black undershirt and no tie. Officers always wear peaked LCPD caps when on patrol. The tie clips of the police officers have \"LCPD\" engraved in the middle. \nOverweight Police officers have similar but slightly different uniforms. Some may wear sky blue shirts, as opposed to navy blue shirts, paired with a weathered fleece-lined coat. This indicates that they are more seasoned and veteran police officers, as the sky blue color was issued by the NYPD in the 1970s till the late 1990s, and presumably so by the LCPD. Overweight officers shall also wear a navy blue uniform of the same style, with the coat being in visibly better shape. Neither version of the outfit has a badge displayed. Overweight officers shall also wear short-sleeve collared shirts with white undershirts, always in navy blue with a badge displayed. During rainy weather, Overweight officers shall wear raincoats when on foot with either light or navy blue collared shirts.\nThe Alderney State Troopers wear different uniforms from those of the Liberty City Police Department; this consists of a sky blue shirt, dark blue tie with triangular pin, swept-wing style peaked cap with triangular badge, over-the-shoulder belt and holster and navy blue trousers with a yellow stripe on the side of each leg. Curiously, they may also wear an LCPD jacket and tie similar to those seen on fit LCPD officers but with ASP trousers and cap. The Alderney State Police's uniforms thus bear resemblance to those of the ; however, their police stations bear the LCPD logo and their vehicles have LCPD livery, most likely due to development time constraints.\nPlayer Clothing.\nLCPD headgear is available for female multiplayer characters In the PC version of \"GTA IV\", consisting of a Vapid-branded motorcycle helmet and a black beret featuring the LCPD patch.\nBeta Content.\nCut Officer Types.\nFemale police officers.\nIn \"GTA IV\" there were supposed to be female police officers. One can be spotted in the first \"GTA IV\" official trailer meaning they were cut late in development.\nTraffic Police Officers.\nIn \"GTA IV\", there were supposed to be traffic police officers. One can be spotted in the second \"GTA IV\" official trailer meaning they were cut late in development. Their model can still be found in the game as m_y_cop_traffic_01.wdd. A traffic police officer makes an appearance in the mission &lt;a href=\"Pest%20Control\"&gt;Pest Control&lt;/a&gt;, manning a booth on the eastbound side of the East Borough Bridge. \nBeta Police Hat Design.\nUnlike the hats worn by overweight police officers and the unused traffic police cap, which display a true-to-life NYPD hat device, the hats worn by fit police officers feature a modified version with the left side of the device being mirrored; however, the normal and specular texture layers for m_y_cop_p are based on the real-life design, suggesting that the diffuse texture was changed during development. Despite this, the original texture can still be found in the form of an unused prop for M_M_Alcoholic.\nCut Equipment.\n&lt;a href=\"Nightstick\"&gt;Nightstick&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"GTA IV\" the police officers were supposed to be armed with nightsticks as there are some quotes like \"You know where a nightstick goes?\", \"I'm going to break this stick off in you!\", \"Don't make me use my nightstick on your head!\", \"I got 15 inches for you to suck on\".\nUnused props.\nThere is a variety of unused accessories for police officers in the game's pedprops.img file. While not necessarily cut from the game, they lack any entries in the pedVariations.dat file that would enable them to be equipped by officers. They are as follows:\nWebsite.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe in-game &lt;a href=\"Internet%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; features an official website for the LCPD, located at Libertycitypolice.com.\n&lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; receives an &lt;a href=\"Mail.eyefind.info\"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Francis%20McReary\"&gt;Francis McReary&lt;/a&gt; to inform him about the website. If the player scrolls all the way to the bottom of the page and clicks on the small padlock icon, they can access the secret &lt;a href=\"LCPD%20Database\"&gt;police database&lt;/a&gt;, listing dozens of characters from the game and their police records. A humorous detail about the site is that the LCPD haven't actually restricted the database to authorised people (with a password), but instead have a warning at the top of the page that it may only be used by the LCPD. The player can browse the site freely, including the restricted database section, as the site won't give any &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted level stars&lt;/a&gt;, unlike &lt;a href=\"www.littlelacysurprisepageant.com\"&gt;littlelacysurprisepageant.com&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe LCPD also set up a sting site known as &lt;a href=\"littlelacysurprisepageant.com\"&gt;littlelacysurprisepageant.com&lt;/a&gt;, used to catch people attempting to access child pornography. If the website is interfaced, the player will immediately receive a five-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level\"&gt;Wanted Level&lt;/a&gt; after logging off the computer.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn \"\", the undercover officer &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Heston\"&gt;Wade Heston's&lt;/a&gt; e-mail address is W.Heston@Libertycitypolice.com.\nPatch.\nAlthough the patch is based on the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.dafont.com/forum/attach/orig/2/9/293522.jpg\"&gt;NYPD&lt;/a&gt;, it is clearly states that the LCPD is known for police brutality. In the middle of the patch, two Police Officers in riot gear are shown with batons dragging a man on the ground (this same design is seen on LSPD badges in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;GTA V&lt;/a&gt;\"). Below this, the scales of Justice are weighing a coffee cup and a doughnut. The Alderney State Police wear their own shoulder patches, similar to those of the ; however, their vehicles and police stations reuse the LCPD patch."}

The biggest star on the Swingers is troubled star power starting pitcher &lt;a href=\"Ernesto%20Asaltacunas\"&gt;Ernesto Asaltacunas&lt;/a&gt;, and their manager is &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Thornsteen\"&gt;Henry Thornsteen&lt;/a&gt;.

Eventually, the city council granted their request. The same year, Swingers' fans were furious at inadequate doping by team players. Subsequently, the head coach resigned and players taking too few steroids were terminated. The remaining players promise to train and take whatever is necessary to win.\nThe Swingers make an appearance in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" in the &lt;a href=\"Logger%20Beer\"&gt;Logger Light&lt;/a&gt; TV Commercial, where they are against the Corkers.

Their logo consists of the abbreviated title \"LTA\" with cursive lettering, which is often seen within a circle. Their main color is blue, however the text and circle color appear vary depending on where they are found. Alternative logo designs include parallel diagonal stripes running through the LTA text, used for the LTA bus service, and a circular arrow looping around the LTA text, used for the LTA subway service.\nLiberty Transport Authority operate the &lt;a href=\"Brute\"&gt;Brute&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bus%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Bus&lt;/a&gt;, bearing a pastel green and light grey color scheme, bearing the LTA logo and tag lines.

According to the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt; newspaper, some Japanese men have become part of the Triads, implying a link with the &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs seen on a screenshot, the Triads also drove in the beta an unnamed sedan/saloon, possibly the &lt;a href=\"Beamer\"&gt;Beamer&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nThey are the initial enemy of &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt;, while he works for the Leone family. An all-out war between the Triads and the Leones erupted as the Triads attempted to muscle in on Leone businesses in &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt;. The war concluded after three of the Triad warlords were assassinated and their fish factory was destroyed by a Leone truck bomb (ironically, this place serves as a &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Drugs%20Warehouse\"&gt;warehouse&lt;/a&gt; that used to belong to the Leones &lt;a href=\"The%20Trouble%20With%20Triads\"&gt;until the Triads blew it up&lt;/a&gt;). While it is improbable that the Triads were finished in Liberty City, they were definitely weakened to a significant extent because of the loss of their most powerful asset.\nTriad members wear blue boiler suits and black bandannas. In the &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;beta releases of the game&lt;/a&gt;, the Triads originally wore black tracksuits with tattoos and no bandana.

He proved her wrong. After the &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Sindacco Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; were forced out of Portland, the Triads became a big problem for the Leones as they started moving in on the rest of Chinatown. &lt;a href=\"Massimo%20Torini\"&gt;Massimo Torini&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Sicilian%20Mafia\"&gt;Sicilian Mafia&lt;/a&gt; had predicted them to do so. It was part of his plan to destroy all other mob influence in Portland. Toni was sent to follow Torini through Chinatown for information, but he was spotted by the Triads, whom he killed during his escape. The Triads later retaliated by blowing up &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore Leone&lt;/a&gt;'s warehouse in Callahan Point.\nIn \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", they wear blue tracksuits with their gang logo on the back, with black or blue pants, and black sunglasses. They carry meat cleavers and pistols. The favorite radio station of the Triads in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" is &lt;a href=\"Flashback%20FM\"&gt;Flashback FM&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Advance\".\nIn , they wear light blue tracksuits, and they drive &lt;a href=\"Mr%20Wongs\"&gt;Mr Wongs&lt;/a&gt; instead of &lt;a href=\"Triad%20Fish%20Van\"&gt;Fish Vans&lt;/a&gt;.

Huang travels to Liberty City in 2009 to deliver his father's sword, &lt;a href=\"Yu%20Jian%20Sword\"&gt;Yu Jian&lt;/a&gt;, to the new patriarch of the Lee family, Uncle Wu \"Kenny\" Lee, who intends to present it to Hsin in order to gain favor for the position of Triad boss. Unbeknownst to Hsin, the sword is actually worthless, its tradition having been invented by Mr. Lee after he won it in a card game. As Huang Lee arrives at &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, he is ambushed by several mysterious thugs, who steal the sword and leave Huang for dead.\nHaving fallen out of favor with Hsin for the loss of the sword, Kenny enlists his nephew's help in regaining lost territory and reputation, while Huang continues his search for both the thieves who stole Yu Jian (leaving him for dead) and the identity of his father's killer. He goes on to work for top Triad\u00a0lieutenants &lt;a href=\"Chan%20Jaoming\"&gt;Chan Jaoming&lt;/a&gt;, the feeble-minded son of Hsin with a penchant for street races, who often employs Huang to clean up his mistakes - including &lt;a href=\"Jackin%27%20Chan\"&gt;rescuing Chan from the Irish-American Killers, who have kidnapped him&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Counterfeit%20Gangster\"&gt;destroying Chan's contraband before the FIB get their hands on it&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Slaying%20With%20Fire\"&gt;using Huang to wipe out a large number of Chan's entourage in a surprise ambush at Happiness Island after it was revealed that one of his top men was an FIB informant&lt;/a&gt; - and &lt;a href=\"Zhou%20Ming\"&gt;Zhou Ming&lt;/a&gt;, a narcissist who sometimes displays borderline psychotic behavior and is involved in audacious endeavours, including &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Haul%20Z\"&gt;committing a bank robbery and using a Chinese Red Dragon costume to escape the police&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flatliner\"&gt;arranging for Huang to hijack an ambulance containing an old friend of Zhou's from Francis International Airport which is then delivered to his club in East Island City&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"So%20Near%2C%20Yet%20Sonar\"&gt;sending Huang to retrieve the cargo from his destroyed contraband boat&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0The\u00a0Triads\u00a0also frequently come under attack by the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Lords\"&gt;Spanish Lords&lt;/a&gt;, who have long been enemies of the Triads. The\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Lords\"&gt;Spanish Lords&lt;/a&gt; interfere with Triad business in many ways: by\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Raw%20Deal\"&gt;turning on Chan and Huang at a drug deal between the two\u00a0parties in Northwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Copter%20Carnage\"&gt;by attacking Uncle Kenny's merchandise at his East Island City warehouse&lt;/a&gt;, and by &lt;a href=\"Sa-Boat-Age\"&gt;sabotaging a speedboat that Chan had stolen from them, leading to an attempt to assassinate him on open water&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Triads also become close business partners with the &lt;a href=\"Messina%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Messina Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, to the extent that &lt;a href=\"Missed%20the%20Boat%3F\"&gt;Huang helps Hsin's business associates in the Mafia smuggle contraband merchandise into the city&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Huang%20Lee\"&gt;Huang Lee&lt;/a&gt; later inadvertently sabotages the Triads' truce with the Messina family, after almost killing &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Capra\"&gt;Jimmy Capra&lt;/a&gt;, a Messina made man, on &lt;a href=\"Oversights\"&gt;Rudy D'Avanzo's orders&lt;/a&gt;. In order to redeem himself, &lt;a href=\"A%20Rude%20Awakening\"&gt;Huang assassinates Rudy D'Avanzo&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is also revealed throughout the game that the Triads employ the help of the Korean &lt;a href=\"Midtown%20Gangsters\"&gt;Midtown Gangsters&lt;/a&gt; as hired muscle, in a similar fashion to the &lt;a href=\"Ancelotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Ancelotti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; using the now defunct &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Mob\"&gt;Albanian Mob&lt;/a&gt; as hired muscle, or the &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Pegorino Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href=\"McReary%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;McReary Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; as hired muscle. However, during the events of the game, Huang discovers, through the help of the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; undercover detective &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Heston\"&gt;Wade Heston&lt;/a&gt;, that the Korean gangsters want to become independent of the family, and that they also might have been involved with the robbery of the &lt;a href=\"Yu%20Jian%20Sword\"&gt;Yu Jian Sword&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this, Huang performs several attacks against the Koreans, such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Tow%20Job\"&gt;causing a carnage to put one of the Koreans in jail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"By%20Myriads%20of%20Swords\"&gt;beheading two of their members&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Wages%20of%20Hsin\"&gt;destroying one of their main bases&lt;/a&gt;. The Midtown Gangsters gradually grow weaker due to the actions of Huang and the Triads, leading to &lt;a href=\"Arms%20Out%20of%20Harm%27s%20Way\"&gt;Hsin dispatching Huang to destroy a weapons shipment at the docks, out of fear that the Midtown Gangsters might use the weapons against the Triads&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cash%20%26amp%3B%20Burn\"&gt;the Midtown Gangsters losing control of a protection racket at a Castle Garden construction site to the Irish gangsters, prompting Zhou Ming to dispatch Huang to drive them out&lt;/a&gt;.\nHsin's insistence that a federal informant is compromising Triad business leads to severe retribution. Under Hsin's orders, Huang executes several Triads suspected of being the rat, and a brief war between the Triads and the Korean Midtown Gangsters, who had long been loyal to the Triads, follows. With the aid of LCPD detective Wade Heston, Huang discovers that a sect of the Midtown Gangsters, a group of assassins known as the &lt;a href=\"Wonsu%20Nodong\"&gt;Wonsu Nodong&lt;/a&gt;, was responsible for the theft of Yu Jian and harboring the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; rat. Hsin enlists the services of private investigator &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Leroc\"&gt;Lester Leroc&lt;/a&gt;, who Huang helps to infiltrate the Angels of Death, following rumours that the rat might be within their ranks. Huang is also tricked by mobster Rudy D'Avanzo into doing his bidding, under the pretense that he will get concrete evidence that proves Jimmy Capra to be the rat, not realizing that D'Avanzo is using him as his muscle in his war against the Messinas.\nUltimately, a document recovered by Huang and Heston names both Chan and Zhou as rats. Huang informs his uncle Kenny of this, and &lt;a href=\"Rat%20Race\"&gt;the two present the evidence to Hsin&lt;/a&gt;, who is disgraced by the possibility of his son betraying his Triads and decides to retire to Macau, naming Kenny his successor. Kenny promptly orders Chan and Zhou's executions, which Huang &lt;a href=\"Clear%20the%20Pier\"&gt;carries out&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hit%20from%20the%20Tong\"&gt;with little remorse&lt;/a&gt;, despite both men denying the accusations against them.\nHowever, Heston learns the document incriminating Chan and Zhou was a fake, and at a meeting on &lt;a href=\"Charge%20Island\"&gt;Charge Island&lt;/a&gt;, Huang discovers that Kenny is the rat, murdered his brother (Huang's father) and orchestrated the theft of Yu Jian with the Wonsu Nodong in order to disgrace Hsin and take his place as Triad leader. Huang pursues Kenny to Hsin's penthouse, where he injures Hsin with Yu Jian, the weapon having been in his possession all along. Huang takes his revenge and kills Kenny, while the wounded Hsin is arrested by the police, leaving the Triads without a leader. However, before being taken away, Hsin offers the position to Huang, who does not respond.\nVehicles.\nThe Triads are seen to drive a number of customized vehicles from 2008 to 2009, the time periods of Grand Theft Auto IV and Chinatown Wars.\nIn GTA IV, a Triad variant of the &lt;a href=\"Feroci\"&gt;Feroci&lt;/a&gt;, known as the JDM VIP, can be seen driven by Triad gangsters in Chinatown, Algonquin. It features a chin and spoiler not seen on standard Ferocis, as well as gold rims, a dark blue paintjob, and Chinese knotting hung from the rearview mirror. It displays superior performance to the standard Feroci.\nIn addition to the JDM VIP, the Triads also drive custom variants of the &lt;a href=\"Intruder\"&gt;Intruder&lt;/a&gt; known as the Intruder VX, which sport a red paintjob, sideskirts and a spoiler, and the same knotting seen on the Triad Ferocis. Both of those cars play &lt;a href=\"Electro-Choc\"&gt;Electro-Choc&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Broker\"&gt;Radio Broker&lt;/a&gt; by default.\nIn \"GTA Chinatown Wars\", the custom Ferocis and Intruders have seemingly been replaced by a custom variant of the &lt;a href=\"Hellenbach\"&gt;Hellenbach&lt;/a&gt;. Painted in the Triad's signature lavender purple, it features a white stripe running the length of the car, large bumpers and sideskirts, blue neon underglow visible only at night, and nitrous-enhanced top speed. It can be seen patrolling Triad territory in &lt;a href=\"Cerveza%20Heights\"&gt;Cerveza Heights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Easton\"&gt;Lower Easton&lt;/a&gt; and typically contains one or two Triad gangsters armed with &lt;a href=\"SMG\"&gt;SMG&lt;/a&gt;'s. In this game, they listen to &lt;a href=\"Prairie%20Cartel\"&gt;Prairie Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sinowav%20FM\"&gt;Sinowav FM&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"DFA\"&gt;DFA&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdditionally, other gang cars appear in \"GTA Chinatown Wars\". These include a Triad &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Admiral&lt;/a&gt; variant, that is seen parked around &lt;a href=\"Cerveza%20Heights\"&gt;Cerveza Heights&lt;/a&gt;. This one has a different engine and horn sound from the regular Admiral and plays the &lt;a href=\"DJ%20Khalil\"&gt;DJ Khalil&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Alchemist\"&gt;Alchemist&lt;/a&gt; radio stations by default instead of the Admiral's &lt;a href=\"Truth%20%26amp%3B%20Soul\"&gt;Truth &amp; Soul&lt;/a&gt;. Another car used by the Triads is a tuned &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt; variant, this one has a better top speed from the regular Comet, and has a red neon underglow at night. It is used solely by the &lt;a href=\"Jaoming%20Family\"&gt;Jaoming Family&lt;/a&gt;, and as such can be found only in missions involving them and in rampages involving them. It plays &lt;a href=\"Deadmau5\"&gt;Deadmau5&lt;/a&gt; by default.\nMission Appearances.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nMission appearances other than Huang himself and the bosses who give him missions:"}

It is run by the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Transport%20Authority\"&gt;Liberty City Transport Authority&lt;/a&gt; and would appear to be for cross-river commuter journeys to Liberty City (hence the name).

Like other bus stops in the game, no &lt;a href=\"Bus%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;buses&lt;/a&gt; are seen using them because bus services were cut from the final game.\nThe terminal has tight security, with &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20State%20Police\"&gt;Alderney State Police&lt;/a&gt; carrying &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt;s stationed in every corner of the terminal.\nThe only advertisement from &lt;a href=\"Walsh%27s%20Wee%20Winky\"&gt;Walsh's Wee Winky&lt;/a&gt; in the city, can be found in the south-west side of the terminal.\nInfluence.\nIt is based on the in .

Originating in the 2000's and gaining popularity in the early to mid-2010's, hipsters are known for their appreciation of niche and alternative cultural elements, such as vintage clothing, indie music, and artisanal foods. Despite their focus on authenticity and originality, hipsters are sometimes criticized for being overly ironic or for creating their own form of mainstream culture, which contradicts their emphasis on uniqueness. \nHipsters can be found across multiple neighborhoods in north and west &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, though they are most prevalent in Mirror Park, making up a majority of its residents. Other neighborhoods with significant hipster presence include &lt;a href=\"Hawick\"&gt;Hawick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alta\"&gt;Alta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chumash\"&gt;Chumash&lt;/a&gt;, and the cities of &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro\"&gt;Del Perro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rockford%20Hills\"&gt;Rockford Hills&lt;/a&gt;.\nHipsters are legitimate in their business interests and mostly focus on the media and entertainment industry. They seem to be in the movie making business, as seen at the beginning of the fifth &lt;a href=\"Rampages%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;Rampage&lt;/a&gt; mission. Hipsters can also be seen &lt;a href=\"Fame%20or%20Shame%20%28mission%29\"&gt;auditioning&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Fame%20or%20Shame\"&gt;Fame or Shame&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting they also dabble in television. They could also be involved in the music industry to some extent, as hipsters can be mentioned in street conversations as being \"the singer in an electronic band\".\nAppearance.\nHipsters are tough to distinguish from other civilians in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. They are composed almost exclusively of multiracial young adults of the Millenial generation, though some appear older, closer to their 30s or 40s. Most hipsters wear a scarf as a distinguishing feature, although this is not always the case. Male hipsters are seen wearing V-neck or baseball shirts, zip-up hoodies, skinny jeans and shorts, flip flops, skate shoes. They may sport styled hair and mustaches, and often dress in very brightly-colored clothing. Female hipsters are often seen wearing antique dresses, leggings, and vintage footwear, such as dress slippers, ornate sandals or go-go boots."}

There you will see the receivers, a group of armed women. They are heavily armed with various weapons, including pump-action shotguns, &lt;a href=\"Uzi\"&gt;Uzi&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Tec-9\"&gt;Tec-9&lt;/a&gt;s, while one may have an &lt;a href=\"M16\"&gt;M4 Carbine&lt;/a&gt;, and there are a few snipers high up in various locations. Kill as many of these female mobsters as possible, since these women will man the escorting Red Sentinels that will protect the courier's car, while moving around quickly to avoid the snipers.\nThe courier should be landing in a &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; helicopter. Now quickly take down the courier (who is wearing armor) and her escort down, before they reach their getaway car, a unique black Sentinel. If they get on the car you will have to snipe the courier dead through the windshield. Once the courier is dead, pick up the plates and either drive or fly (using the courier's Maverick) to the print works and deliver the plates. Mission accomplished!\nIf you destroy the black car before the courier's chopper lands, then the chopper will not touchdown and you will fail the mission.\nStrategy Two.\nIf you don't stop the courier's car at the docks, no fear! You can use your own vehicle and ram the courier's car in Little Havana or Little Haiti, getting it stuck in one of the alleys or obstacles. You can either shoot the courier through the windshield, or the courier will bail and then she can be killed. If you blow the car up with the courier inside, the plates will get blow up as well and the mission will be failed.\nStrategy Three.\nYou can setup an ambush at the courier's destination in Little Haiti. (The first time, you can tail the courier all the way there so you are aware of the location.) The courier will head through the northern alley on foot, and you can block this with a vehicle.\nWalk the below-grade entrance carefully. As the courier's car gets close, the doors will open and a line of four women (wearing jeans, headbands, red shirts, and vests) with pump-action shotguns will walk out. Kill these women first and then turn your attention to the alley. As the Sentinels won't drive into the alleyway, the courier has to be on foot, making this an easy kill.\nInside the underground room is a printing press. If the player opts to wait inside, a few seconds after the courier arrives, the doors will closed, failing the mission and trapping the player inside.\nStrategy four.\nThere is a very easy way to finish the mission: observing the way that the courier passes, you can kill it using a sniper rifle. She will fall dead on the floor and you can use it use the black Sentinel to reach the Print Works avoiding the other women who pursue you into two other cars Sentinel.\nUnique Black Sentinel.\nThe courier's getaway car is normally locked, however after she gets in, shoot her through the windshield and her body will tumble out (so you can take the plates). The easiest way to do this is right at the docks.\nYou can take this vehicle to one of your garages, exit and let the doors lock, then blow it up. After delivering the plates to complete the mission, don't save yet, return to your garage and close/open the garage to respawn a unique black-colored Sentinel that is unlocked !"}

The first van attacked will provoke a reaction from the AOD member in the passenger seat, the second van contains AOD members in the front and rear, whilst the third van is escorted by two bikes.\nThere is no time limit for this mission and the vans will not disappear if Johnny gets too far away.\nOnce all three vans have been destroyed, the mission is complete. Soon after, Johnny will begin working for &lt;a href=\"Malc\"&gt;Malc&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath.\nAfter this mission, Jim explains to Johnny that &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Thorpe\"&gt;Terry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Simons\"&gt;Clay&lt;/a&gt; can now be called for backup when required."}

It is a freeroam mission given to the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Malc\"&gt;Malc&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nMalc informs the player(s) that a special delivery bike has been stolen from customs and the buyer wants it back. The player is directed to the location.\nOn the way to the marked location, Malc will call again and advise the bike is inside a container on the rooftop of the building.\nOn arrival, there are three small containers on the roof protected by many opposing gang members. &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;Frogger&lt;/a&gt; helicopters are present on the roof, along with a &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Jetsam Cargobob&lt;/a&gt;. At one location, a helicopter is on the ground that players can use. Once the player attacks, two more helicopters will arrive to defend the rooftop from the air. \nOnce the player has made it to the rooftop and examined one of the three containers, they will need to locate an industrial cutting saw to open the locked container doors. A portable cabin will be located somewhere on the roof where the player will find a duffel bag with the saw inside.\nThe player then needs to cut open each container until the bike is found.\nOnce the container with the target &lt;a href=\"Oppressor\"&gt;Oppressor&lt;/a&gt; is located, the player has to get it to a buyer. The player is instructed to use the Cargobob to airlift it there inside the container. More gang members will arrive in two more helicopters at this point to prevent the player taking it. \nIf the Cargobob is destroyed, Malc will text suggesting the keys for the bike must be on the rooftop somewhere, although the keys are always available to collect and use regardless of the status of the Cargobob.\nIf the player choses to use the Cargobob, they simply need to airlift it to the buyer location. If the player has collected the keys, they have the option of riding the bike out of the container and off the rooftop (some container locations have ducting that could make the Oppressor rocket take-off precarious however). \nOnce the container or the the bike is dropped off to the &lt;a href=\"Duggan%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Duggan Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; buyer, the player needs to leave the area to complete the mission.\nIf the Oppressor is destroyed at any point, the mission fails."}

The launcher's warhead is also exposed, instead of housed in the tube.\nIt has the unique ability of targeting vehicles, both ground and air. Its targeting system is similar to the missiles found on some weaponized aircraft, being able to lock-on to selected targets indicated by an outlined box. It can also be fired freely without any targets. As such, it is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Heat%20Seeking%20Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Heat Seeking Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt; from \"\".\nAccording to the text on the side of the weapon, the Homing Launcher is property of the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; Government.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Homing Launcher has an incredibly long range; it can lock on to vehicles 300 meters away, and the missile has a maximum range of 1,080 meters before it self destructs in ten seconds, being able to follow fighter jets for a very long distance, surpassing all missiles/rockets (including mounted rockets on vehicles). The projectiles fired by the Homing Launcher are very fast (108m/s or 388.8kph) and can easily chase down a &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt; in flight. The missiles can destroy or disable aircraft in only one hit, making them the best weapon to use against aircraft, alongside the &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Railgun\"&gt;Railgun&lt;/a&gt;. The missile is most effective at pursuing escaping enemies, as approaching ones will have a much easier time dodging the missile. However, it takes two seconds to acquire lock-on to a target. Additionally, it can carry only 10 rockets instead of 20 unlike the normal &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt;. Homing Launcher missiles locked onto a player-controlled aircraft (especially noted with helicopters) is able to sweep back around when it misses its target the first time. Additionally, rockets fired at stronger vehicles (like the &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino Tank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt;, etc) by the Homing Launcher may cause fire to be spread onto the vehicle. Although this can avoid explosion, it can still cause damage to the vehicle, especially aircraft.\nA well-shot missile is likely a death sentence for unarmored helicopters and slow planes. However, an experienced pilot in a fighter jet will easily dodge its shots, although they will probably break off their attack while missiles are in air in order to get rid of them.\nUnlike the Rocket Launcher however, the explosion damage against vehicles is lower and, as such, vehicle explosion is not guaranteed when hitting an aircraft or an armored helicopter such as the &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt;. It will, at least, destroy the engine (in the case of aircraft with multiple engines, one of the two) and may even blow parts off, making piloting the said vehicle much harder. It will take three times the amount to destroy certain vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent\"&gt;Insurgent&lt;/a&gt;, which requires 23 homing missiles rather than eight RPG rockets to blow it up, due to a flag that does not inflict extra petrol tank damage. These missiles share the same blast radius similar to the Rocket Launcher and most explosives (five meters), and are still lethal if caught anywhere in the explosion.\nThe Homing Launcher has been rebalanced in the update to have increased reload times, reduced firing rate, and an increase to the resilience of large capacity planes against it. Additionally, it appears to be less effective compared to the rockets fired from a &lt;a href=\"Ruiner%202000\"&gt;Ruiner 2000&lt;/a&gt; ()."}

Franklin, however, doesn't want to be part of the petty gang banging in any way possible. Trevor suddenly appears out of the blue. After giving Denise $7 and shooing her back into the house, he says his reason for being there is to make new friends. At that moment, a drug deal sounded intriguing.\nThe men load themselves into the back of Lamar's &lt;a href=\"Speedo\"&gt;van&lt;/a&gt;, along with Lamar's dog &lt;a href=\"Chop\"&gt;Chop&lt;/a&gt;, and head to &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt;, where they'll do the exchange with the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt;. After reaching Grove Street shortly, everyone gets out of the van and follows Lamar up to one of the houses. &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20Drug%20Dealer\"&gt;The dealer&lt;/a&gt; opens the door suspiciously as all three men are presented with a white block wrapped in plastic. Once it's cut open, Lamar gets a taste and is extremely eager to hand over a large sum of cash for it.\nTrevor, however, is much more skeptical. He asks if they can take a sample from the other side of the brick, but the dealer refuses to do so and instead plays hardball, emboldened by Franklin's eagerness to leave as soon as possible. As Trevor grows frustrated, he grabs onto the block and after a moment of tug of war with the dealer, it breaks in half, proving his skepticism to be correct after all; it was just a gram of nose-candy surrounding a core of drywall filler. The dealer shouts out into the street that they have a case of \"buyer's remorse\" on hand before quickly slamming the door, which alerts all nearby Ballas and causes them to open fire at the crew.\nThe throbbing score violently begins to increase as more armed Ballas members appear in &lt;a href=\"Felon\"&gt;Felon&lt;/a&gt;s disposed to kill the trio as Chop runs back home. In the heat of the battle, the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; show up to deal with the situation. Franklin and Trevor follow Lamar through a narrow alley that he found in an effort to help the men escape. As they ran towards the open water, they see the rapper &lt;a href=\"MC%20Clip\"&gt;MC Clip&lt;/a&gt; and a group of girls in colourful bikinis dancing for a film crew in front of three &lt;a href=\"Seashark\"&gt;jet skis&lt;/a&gt;. After stealing them, all three men head towards the open sea.\nAfter riding across the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt; and putting distance between them and the cops, Franklin figures that the cops would have a harder time catching them if they all split up.

However in \"\", it is the same size as the regular Rumpo, but with larger wheels. It is primarily distinguishable from a regular Rumpo by its paintjob. \nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", the body of the van body features a total of three color tones (dull green, blue and red), and also features graffiti on both sides, while the \"\" rendition features a white and yellow paintjob, as well as the aforementioned graffiti. There is a way to get a Hoods Rumpo XL without the graffiti through glitching or very rare occurrences, just like the lightless &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt; glitch.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Advance\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\", the Hoods, which is also based on the Rumpo in the game, differs with its grooves on the roof that run from the front to the back, as opposed to the grooves of the Rumpo that cut across the van from its sides. It can appear in four different colors as opposed to the standard Hoods Rumpo XL in the other games.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe Hoods Rumpo XL handles neutrally and once it picks up speed, the van can go fairly fast. The acceleration is faster than the normal Rumpo, but strangely it is slower at top speed. It is also all wheel drive and can easily drive up steep hills like the one near the &lt;a href=\"North%20West%20Towers\"&gt;Shoreside Vale Safehouse&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nFor the \"\" rendition, however, its technical aspects have been changed. Its mass and top speed were increased, its drivetrain is now rear-wheel drive, being difficult to use off-road."}

Once chosen, a yellow marker on the map indicates the GPS route to the said location. Each location has a slightly different premise, but each require the organisation to steal either a briefcase or a &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; tank.\nNo matter which variant of the mission is started, the organisation will receive a wanted level once the target object is retrieved. While the mission is active, all services which remove the player's wanted level, such as Lester's \"Cops Turn Blind Eye\" or the CEO's \"Bribe Authorities\" options, are made unavailable until the mission ends. While the briefcase/Rhino can be delivered while a wanted level is still active, it is not impossible for members to evade it beforehand.\nLSIA.\nThe high security location is within the hangar south of the airport, where &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;'s hangar is located.

The organisation receives a four-star wanted level once the briefcase is picked up.\nMerryweather Base.\nThe briefcase is located inside an office at the front of the warehouse, where several Merryweather units are found with high fire-rate weapons and armor. Numerous Merryweather mercenaries are scattered around the ground level and on the formation of the dock where the dock-crane and helipad are located. Once the player makes their way inside the office, they need to pick up the briefcase and deliver it to either a mansion in &lt;a href=\"Richman%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Richman&lt;/a&gt;, a small farm just west of the &lt;a href=\"Senora%20Freeway\"&gt;Senora Freeway&lt;/a&gt;, or to a building behind the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Sign\"&gt;Vinewood Sign&lt;/a&gt;. The organisation receives a four-star wanted level once the briefcase is picked up.\nFort Zancudo.\nThis is the only variant of the mission where the objective is not a briefcase but rather a Rhino tank, which is located in a large hangar in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt;. It is guarded by many military soldiers and an officer. The organisation is required to make their way past all the guards, steal the tank, and deliver it to either &lt;a href=\"Chumash\"&gt;Chumash&lt;/a&gt;, a house near &lt;a href=\"Harmony\"&gt;Harmony&lt;/a&gt;, or to the &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Forest%20Sawmill\"&gt;Paleto Forest Sawmill&lt;/a&gt;.\nAltruist Camp.\nThe briefcase is located at the end of the camp out in the open, being held by a cult leader and guarded by 3 cultists. All four are armed with Carbine Rifles. Multiple other cultists are also scattered around the camp and will fire on sight with pistols. The player will not earn a wanted level when they provoke the enemies, although if they kill some, they will earn 1-2 stars depending on circumstances. Once the briefcase is obtained, a three-star wanted level is attained. The organisation needs to deliver the briefcase to either &lt;a href=\"Marlowe%20Vineyards\"&gt;Marlowe Vineyards&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Stoner%20Cement%20Works\"&gt;Stoner Cement Works&lt;/a&gt; storage facility, or a large warehouse in &lt;a href=\"Grapeseed\"&gt;Grapeseed&lt;/a&gt;."}

Upon loading, the host has the option between making the mode a \"Last Team Standing\" or \"Last Man Standing\" game-mode. In Last Team Standing, players are split into two teams and one team has to work together to eliminate the other. Depending on whether or not the host of the match enables \"Team Balancing\", players can switch between teams before the game starts. With Team Balancing enabled, the number of total players joined is divided into two, and the option to \"Join Team\" before loading is disabled.\nPlayers may chose between any of the Arena Ready or Arena Contender vehicles before loading, and, if enabled by the host, select a \"Custom\" vehicle. This mode is not restricted to any particular Arena War vehicle. With Custom Vehicles enabled, the player is also able to upgrade their vehicle before the match starts.\nWhen the round starts, a random players will be given the bomb. They then have one minute to pass the bomb onto an enemy contender by making contact with their vehicle. After the time has elapsed, the contender carrying the bomb will be destroyed and eliminated from the match. Players who are killed will be forced to spectate from the spectator box. Eliminated players can also use traps, turrets, &lt;a href=\"RC%20Bandito\"&gt;RC Bandito&lt;/a&gt;s, and Battle Drones to damage the remaining enemy contenders.\nThe bomb's timer will gradually decrease in 5-second increments, down to a minimum of thirty seconds. If the player carrying the bomb is destroyed by other means (crashing, other contenders' weapons...), the bomb will be given to another player, but the bomb's timer will not decrease by five seconds.\nOnce only one player or only players on one team (depending on the game-mode chosen) remain, that player/team will win the round.\nMaps.\nThere are three variations of Hot Bomb for each Arena War theme: Apocalypse, Future Shock, and Nightmare.\nAll three maps are open-space and do not consist of any circuits or laps.
