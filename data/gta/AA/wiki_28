However, its drivetrain was rearranged into an RWD layout and has an increased weight (3500 kg). Despite this, the vehicle still performs better than the Mule. Both the Triad Fish Van and the Mr. Wongs have similar performance. It remains the fastest large truck in the game."}

So, he tells Huang to go over to his apartment, where he stashed some samples of drugs, and to take them to a dealer who is willing to take them off his hands in &lt;a href=\"Steinway\"&gt;Steinway&lt;/a&gt;.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nWalkthrough.\nFirst, go to Huang's &lt;a href=\"Cerveza%20Heights%20Apartment\"&gt;apartment&lt;/a&gt;. After walking in, there will be a red toolbox inside. This is the stash box, which can hide any drugs the player has. Click on it to find the different drug categories. Only one is available for now, which is Acid. Normally the player can select how much he needs, but Uncle Kenny wants Huang to sell them all. Click on the check sign, and it'll be transferred to Huang's holdall, the bag which holds all of the drugs to be traded, and ones that have been bought.\nThen, drive over to the dealer on the &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt;. He'll be marked with a blue briefcase, and is in a &lt;a href=\"Firefly%20Projects\"&gt;Firefly Projects&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Basketball\"&gt;basketball court&lt;/a&gt;. Sell all of the &lt;a href=\"acid\"&gt;acid&lt;/a&gt;, and after that &lt;a href=\"Liam\"&gt;the dealer&lt;/a&gt; will tell Huang something. &lt;a href=\"Security%20Cameras\"&gt;Security cameras&lt;/a&gt; are in the discreet locations dealers pick, and more and more of them are being &lt;a href=\"busted\"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this, the prices for drugs are skyhigh, and until the cameras are destroyed the prices will drop.\nShortly after this, another dealer called &lt;a href=\"Danny\"&gt;Danny&lt;/a&gt; e-mails Huang on his &lt;a href=\"Communication\"&gt;PDA&lt;/a&gt; that he has some rock-bottom cheap &lt;a href=\"cocaine\"&gt;coke&lt;/a&gt; for sale. He'll be marked by a coke sign and a red arrow meaning the dealer is selling. Drive over to &lt;a href=\"Meadows%20Park\"&gt;Meadows Park&lt;/a&gt; to meet him, and buy all the coke he has. But then, &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;cops&lt;/a&gt; begin to bust the deal. Stash the coke in Huang's apartment before you get &lt;a href=\"busted\"&gt;busted&lt;/a&gt;, or the police will confiscate it. Once the player gets back to the apartment, enter it and stash the coke in the stash box. Then, exit and the mission is completed.\nReward.\nSince this introduces &lt;a href=\"Drug%20Dealing\"&gt;Drug Dealing&lt;/a&gt;, the mini game is unlocked for anytime. Finding new dealers will add them to the in-game map and make sure that having enough drugs to sell and enough money to buy. From time to time, dealers will e-mail Huang with special discounts on drugs, or times where they tell Huang if he sells them a particular type of drug, they'll pay him big time with cash. There are up to 80 dealers to find, and they'll be in discreet locations to deal.\nThis mission also unlocks the 100 cameras scattered around &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; for destruction. The more are destroyed, the lower the prices for drugs go down. This is GTA Chinatown Wars version of hidden packages.\nMission Replay Description.\n\"\"Land of the free, my ass. This place is gonna be land of the freebasing just as soon as I find more dealer contacts.\"\n\"This town is so full of crackheads, deadbeats, and junkies that I'm gonna be flying home on my own jet - maybe even my own airline.\"\n\"Still, this city's security cameras are a bitch - maybe I should do something about them. Like I said, land of the free, my ass.\"\""}

The front clip is fitted with upper and side safety pins, which hinges from the front to reveal the truck's large V8 engine, surrounded by the roll-caging.\nThe cabin area features four high-beam rally lights on the roof, while each side of the vehicle has side-mounted, aluminium exhausts which run under the doors. It lack any sort of windows or rear-view mirrors. A roll cage is present by default, which is part of the tubular chassis.\nOn the rear area, the rear bed contains a large amount of roll-caging, as well as a dedicated rack to carry two spare wheels tied down with green ratchet straps, in a side-by-side positioning. The outer sides have body panels that are specially shaped to contain the aforementioned spare wheels. Behind the cabin is a radiator, and directly beside it are fire extinguishers, as well as side fuel hoses. The vehicle does not have functioning brake or tail lights.\nThe underside of the vehicle uses quad-shock absorbers on each axle, dampening impact to its extreme ride height, together with springs with internal shocks and additional hydraulic shocks. The front axle is protected by a diff cover and a front sump guard, as well as protective layers on the A-frame suspension. The rear axle sports semi-elliptical leaf springs and additional hinged shock absorbers running from the chassis to the axle itself.\nThe Trophy Truck includes many switches and buttons across the interior, and features a knob reading F/R, likely indicating a rear/four wheel drive locking diff. The steering wheel itself includes multiple buttons, and directly behind that are two paddles for an apparent semi-automatic paddle-shift gearbox. A large extended gear-shifter is centralized between the carbon-fiber racing seats. Also, a radio is seen located under the carbon-fiber dashboard.\nThe vehicle's bodywork, engine cam covers and the stitches on the steering wheel are painted in a primary color, while the tubular chassis, front bumper guard and cabin roll cage are painted in a secondary color. Although not accessible, a tertiary color is applied on the cage paddings, which is only available in black upon purchasing it, and are only painted in the corresponding color sets available in &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;. It uses a set of six-spoke rims similar to the \"Endo v.2\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in &lt;a href=\"Atomic\"&gt;Atomic&lt;/a&gt; high-profile, all-terrain radial tires with detailed tread patterns. Both the stock wheel rims and the spare wheel rims on the rear bed are painted with the \"Wheel\" color.\nBoth liveries have the same sponsors, although the Western Company livery adds the corresponding sponsor on it:\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle's most notable advantage is its suspension, which is extremely loose and absorbs jumps and mounds of desert, giving the vehicle excellent off-roading capabilities. It has impressive acceleration and speed due to the engine. The weight of the rear tires and the location that they are in makes the vehicle's rear end spin out a lot around corners, so speed is not recommended when cornering. The Trophy Truck has a four wheel drive layout, giving it excellent traction and off-road abilities. One of its major setbacks, however, are the exposed tires due to the high ground clearance that makes it susceptible to gunfire or spike strips (unless if the truck is fitted with Bulletproof Tires). Its resistance to collisions is generally good, but can easily lose most of its body components and spare wheels in the process, leaving the vehicle almost in bare chassis.\nThe engine model appears to be a large V8 with two square air-filters located centrally on the block. The valve covers can be seen along with the roll cage. Two exhausts are seen coming from the engine, running down the side of the vehicle. In front of the engine, a large radiator with radiator fans is seen, placed directly in front of the camshaft cogs. The engine is setup with a single overhead cam configuration."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Grotti\"&gt;Grotti&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA IV\" and &lt;a href=\"Shitzu\"&gt;Shitzu&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA V\".\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nAll iterations of the Tropic are essentially or , based on the .\nThe Tropic is evidently larger than most conventional boats, on par with the &lt;a href=\"Marquis\"&gt;Marquis&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rio\"&gt;Rio&lt;/a&gt;. It features a long hull with tall hand rails and a large living space with opaque windows, while the back features an access ladder on the right and glass doors on the left that allow small visibility to the living space, along with additional accessories such as a lifebuoy on the left and a yellow box on the right. The features the main controls on the front, as well as a bench seat on the rear. The stern features two small nozzles for the inboard engine.\nAll renditions of the Tropic are available only in an all-white color, with the secondary one revealed to be applied to the floors of the rear deck and flybridge, the structure covering the flybridge and the bench seats, as well as the sofas and part of the cabinets in the \"GTA San Andreas\" iteration.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", the Tropic is still a cabin cruiser, but it has a low-profile cabin housed in its bulky hull, strongly resembling a .\nThe Tropic assumes a much smaller design compared to speedboats such as the &lt;a href=\"Jetmax\"&gt;Jetmax&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Squalo\"&gt;Squalo&lt;/a&gt; (with the title of largest boat belonging to the &lt;a href=\"Tug%20%28boat%29\"&gt;Tug&lt;/a&gt;, which is easily twice the size of the pre-\"GTA IV\" Tropic). The boat features a short and wide hull with a slight curvature towards the stern, while the cabin quarters are mostly finished in black and use a sleek windshield with silver/chrome trim, two bucket seats with rollbar loops for the front occupants and large bench seats for the rear occupants. The boat makes use of conventional propellers and small vents on the rear.\nThe Tropic can spawn in different variations with pre-determined extras, which primarily affect the bow, gunwales and cabin:\nThe boat spawns in a white primary color for most of the body, as well as a small variety of secondary colors for the upper portions of the hull, a frame on the dashboard, the rollbar loops on the seats and the propulsion systems.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Tropic returns to \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" with the same design and features, albeit with circular headlights on the bow and rugged/metal flooring on the swim step, while the rollbar loops on the seats were removed. In the enhanced version, the boat uses analog \"Truck\" dials like most boats.\nThe vehicle spawns with the same extras, although the roofed variants were removed in the enhanced version. It also has the same color distribution, although it has a larger variety of color sets.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nDespite its size and weight, the Tropic in \"GTA Vice City\" has an exceptional top speed, although its ability to turn at high speeds is poor. In \"GTA Vice City Stories\", however, it is generally one of the slowest boats (comparable to the &lt;a href=\"Marquis\"&gt;Marquis&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rio\"&gt;Rio&lt;/a&gt;) due to its size and weight. The \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition is remarkably fast, comparable to a &lt;a href=\"Squalo\"&gt;Squalo&lt;/a&gt;.\nDue to the two large inboard engines with s, the boat is able to navigate across shallow waters. It is a great boat for transporting large gangs, and great for just cruising around in the waters of &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, but with the disadvantage of its bad turning.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe \"GTA IV\" rendition features greatly improved performance, but remains a lower-end speedboat. However, it is the third-fastest boat, having a similar speed as the &lt;a href=\"Dinghy%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Dinghy&lt;/a&gt; in the game. Being generally shorter, the Tropic handles relatively well in narrow passages.\nAgain, the boat uses twin inboard engines with propellers, and it shares the engine sound with most speedboats.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\", the boat retains its significant qualities from its previous rendition; however, the handling has been revamped due to the large overhaul of vehicle physics. Its mass has been reduced significantly, allowing it to have higher speeds (though remaining inferior to the speedboats and the ones added in later updates). In addition, while not as versatile as the &lt;a href=\"Seashark\"&gt;Seashark&lt;/a&gt;, it is still a safer alternative for narrow passages, as the Seashark is not very resilient to collisions and the occupants may be ejected.\nAgain, the boat uses twin inboard engines with Z-drive propellers and a relatively low-revving engine sound, with a tone similar to cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Jackal\"&gt;Jackal&lt;/a&gt; and the modern &lt;a href=\"Interceptor\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;.\nGallery.\nDesign.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nStandard=\nYacht=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nVariants.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nYacht.\nA special version of the Tropic appears when purchasing the &lt;a href=\"Galaxy%20Super%20Yacht\"&gt;Orion Yacht&lt;/a&gt; in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", added as part of the update. It spawns in the colors of the yacht; altering the color of the yacht will consequently alter the color of the boat and any other vehicles that spawn on the yacht.\nIt is essentially the same Tropic, with the same features and extras as the regular version. It also retains the same color sets and distribution, used by default when spawned through other means.\nStatic Variants.\nRufus.\n\"Rufus\" is the name for a boat based on the Tropic, appearing as a prop in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\"."}

The front end draws inspiration from the , with the pop-up headlights, vents behind them, and black plastic bar with indicators likely sourced from either the or the . Additionally, the elongated C-pillar, the placement of the rear plate, and the vents located beneath the louvers appear to be influenced by these Ferraris, particularly the 288 model. The rear lights are similarly positioned and feature a cutout in the spoiler akin to that of the Stratos, albeit in a twin configuration, and they draw layout inspiration from either the previously mentioned Ferraris or the . The rear bumper and the exhausts are similar to the .\nDesign.\nTropos Rallye was the first vehicle to feature pop-up headlights in \"GTA Online\". It was also the first vehicle to feature pop-up headlights since the &lt;a href=\"Hakumai\"&gt;Hakumai&lt;/a&gt; in . The front arches of the car feature small ducts directly above the pop-up headlights for extra decoration. Under the front bumper and light unit is a spoiler with additional intakes, the central one being wider and larger than the ones beside it. The front clam of the vehicle opens to reveal a spare wheel tied with green straps, in a similar manner to the &lt;a href=\"Trophy%20Truck\"&gt;Trophy Truck&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe cabin area makes use or a curved windscreen with a single wiper on the centre, while the trims and the A-pillars are finished in black. A set of mirrors can be seen near the A-pillars, as well as black door handles.\nOn the rear area, the car features a roof-mounted lip spoiler and a set of rear louvers in place of a rear window, covering what looks like two vented panels for the engine bay. The rear end features a ducktail spoiler and a set of circular tail lamps, composed of outer red lamps and smaller turn/reverse lamps within these. The rear arches are wider in appearance and have a set of plastic mudguards, while twin exit, twin exhausts are found coming out of the rear body. Exhaust silencers can be seen underneath the vehicle, behind the rear wheels. The rear clam of the vehicle also opens, to reveal the vehicle's V6 engine and an inner wall/window behind the cabin area.\nThe underside area of the car uses a set of single wishbone suspension with protective layers for the front axle, and a multi-link suspension system for the rear axle, with each of the rear axle shafts having parallel trailing arms, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Omnis\"&gt;Omnis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe interior of the car makes use of steel foot rests, red race seats and carbon-fibre door panels with exposed door frames and pull straps. The Tropos Rallye includes various switches and buttons on the dashboard, and features a knob reading F/R, likely indicating a rear/four wheel drive locking differential. An RPM indicator can be seen over the steering column, and a large extended gear-shifter is centralized on the console between the seats. Also, a radio is seen located under the dashboard, on the passenger side.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork and the interior stitching, while the secondary colour is applied to the roof, pillars mirror shells and the exposed door frames. The wheels have a unique rim design, consisting of star-shaped rims with thinner spokes and small borders on them, while having a pentagonal centre. The tyres have a detailed treaded pattern shared with the Omnis. The rear wheels are also wider than the front ones and the rims have a dedicated \"Wheel\" colour.\nBoth liveries have the same sponsors, although the Stronzo livery adds the corresponding sponsor on it:\nPerformance.\nThe vehicle has good performance for its design, although most other vehicles in its class are still superior to it. Its off-roading capabilities are impressive thanks to the mid-rear engine layout, which gives it less body weight and better power to weight ratio. The vehicle also sports a compact design giving it minimal weight.\nThe Tropos has a relatively small steering radius when compared to other similar cars, meaning it has a tendency to understeer at speed. The high revving engine gives a large amount of power and extra fuel causes large backfires during shifting and deceleration.\nAmong the rally cars featured in the game, the Tropos Rallye is one of the best balanced when taken away from tarmac. The relatively light weight, combined with its low centre of mass and short wheelbase, give it very good cornering ability and stability on loose gravel and dirt surfaces.\nThe Tropos is one of the first vehicles in the game to sport a modeled V6 engine, which is carburettored/throttle bodied, and laid transversely. Said engine is coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a rear-mid engine, rear wheel drive layout. The engine sound is low-revving and louder, appearing to be a lower-pitched, edited variation of the one used on the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;."}

The missions are activated by standing inside the red mission marker. The business generates &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;2,000 per day after completing all eight trucking missions. They become available after completing Catalina's mission, &lt;a href=\"Tanker%20Commander\"&gt;Tanker Commander&lt;/a&gt;, which features one of the depot's employees, &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Whittaker\"&gt;Mr. Whittaker&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe missions consist of either delivering cargo within a time limit, delivering a fragile cargo without damaging it, or delivering an illegal cargo whilst being pursued by the &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;three or more star wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. The wanted level cannot be decreased even with &lt;a href=\"Police%20bribe\"&gt;police bribes&lt;/a&gt; or, if the player manages to get in, any &lt;a href=\"Pay%27n%27Spray\"&gt;Pay'n'Spray&lt;/a&gt;. If the player fails the mission, the wanted level will stay with the player but they can now use police bribes and spray shops, while passing the mission will automatically remove their wanted level.\nThe successive missions are increasingly difficult, with tighter time limits, more fragile cargo, or stronger police attention, while also covering a larger area of land to reach the destination. Leaving the cab or detaching the trailer for too long will result in mission failure. It is noteworthy that the last two missions cannot be started until the player completes &lt;a href=\"Yay%20Ka-Boom-Boom\"&gt;Yay Ka-Boom-Boom&lt;/a&gt;, which is necessary to unlock access to &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;.\nMissions.\nThere are a total of eight missions, getting increasingly more difficult as the player progresses. The maximum amount of money that can be earned from finishing all eight missions in a single run is $33,500. After completing a single run of missions, the player can return to replay the Trucking missions anytime, but they will be randomly ordered.\nMission 1.\nGoods must be delivered quickly. The player starts with a maximum value of $1,000, with a time indicator telling when the player has to be at the destination. If the goods are late, cash will be cut in half and a second deadline time will be given. If it's missed, cash will be cut further in half. Miss the third deadline and the mission will be failed. The destination of the first mission will always be located in &lt;a href=\"Red%20County\"&gt;Red County&lt;/a&gt;, with the player usually taking the road near the depot heading north towards &lt;a href=\"Blueberry\"&gt;Blueberry&lt;/a&gt;, which is within East &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;.\nMission 2.\nFragile goods must be delivered. The player starts with a maximum value of $1,500 and must try not to damage the cargo. A damage bar will record the amount of damage the truck and the cargo has received, decreasing the value as the bar depletes. Because this is the first of its kind of mission, the decrease of money will not be as drastic as the future damage missions. On this mission, the destination will always be further eastwards than the previous mission, namely somewhere within or near Montgomery, East San Andreas.\nMission 3.\nIllegal goods must be delivered. The player starts with a fixed value of $2,000 (the value never decreases), but there will be a wanted level of three stars once the truck leaves the compound. Throughout the mission, the police will actively pursue the player's truck, as the wanted level itself cannot be decreased by any means, but it will disappear once the player successfully completes this mission. The delivery location is always within the southern parts of Los Santos.\nMission 4.\nSimilar to Mission 1, goods must be delivered quickly. The player starts with a maximum value of\u00a0$3,000. Compared to the previous timed mission, there is a tighter delivery deadline and a longer distance, and passing the Flint Intersection, which is a necessity, can be especially frustrating, as the player can end up on the wrong side of the road if not careful. The delivery location is always situated within Whetstone, including Angel Pine.\nMission 5.\nSimilar to Mission 2, fragile goods must be delivered. The player starts with a maximum value of $4,000. Compared to the previous fragile goods mission, the cargo contains 'extremely fragile' goods, so extra caution must be taken when going through a tight corner and/or a crowded traffic, so as to also avoid accidentally detaching the trailer, and contact with a police vehicle must be avoided at all times too. The destination is always located in San Fierro.\nMission 6.\nSimilar to Mission 3, illegal goods must be delivered. The player starts with a fixed value of $5,000 and will receive a three-star wanted level upon leaving the compound. Again, the player must watch out for the police coming in the way. The distance is also further than the previous illegal goods mission, with the delivery location randomly chosen from the possible destinations in the previous two missions, which can be confusing.\nMission 7.\nThis is a combination of Missions 1 and 2, where fragile goods must be delivered quickly. The player starts with a maximum value of $7,000. This mission is arguably the hardest, as the player has to arrive at the destination as quickly as possible and not take damage at the same time. This will often result in lesser profits upon completion of the mission, unless the player is skilled enough to avoid damage to the truck. The location is situated within rural North San Andreas.\nMission 8.\nThis is basically similar to Missions 3 and 6, where illegal goods must be delivered. The player starts with a fixed value of $10,000. The cargo contains 'highly illegal' goods, so there will be a four-star wanted level instead of three stars in the previous illegal goods missions, and therefore more police in the way. The delivery destination is located in Las Venturas."}

The hood/nose features two rectangular hatches on either side that open to reveal the engine bay, while the lower left section appears to house a small exhaust and a fuel cap.\nOn the rear section, the vehicle features small steps and a tall cabin with two access doors on either side, marker lights on both ends, and an amber beacon on the right half of the roof, as well as a fire extinguisher on the left-hand section behind the cabin. The rear end of the vehicle features two circular main/brake lights on either side and a single circular reverse/rear-facing main light in the center, while the lower area has a black ram bar with a tow hitch (though unlike the Baggage, it cannot &lt;a href=\"Towing\"&gt;tow&lt;/a&gt; any of the airport carriages). The Tug is one of very few vehicles to feature a rear window wiper.\nThe Tug may spawn with a toolbox or with a small case behind the cabin as separate extras, and only spawns in a white color, where the primary one is applied to the upper section of the vehicle and the secondary one to the lower section.\nPerformance.\nContrary to its appearance, the Tug has a high overall speed, but low acceleration. The Tug is not particularly useful for non-urban environments and also has very limited capabilities for evading pursuers, but can be a quick and efficient mode of transport from getting from the airport to a safehouse or other location via surface streets. Its best use is as a substitute for walking, being slower than a car, yet faster than running.\nThe Tug is powered by a small petrol engine, which is partially visible by breaking one of the side hatches on the hood/nose area. The same engine is coupled to a 4-speed gearbox in a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, and it shares the noisy engine sound with the Baggage."}

The Tug has an obvious industrial use in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", and it is most likely used to move the large garbage barges dotted around the city's waters, although this cannot be utilised in-game since all barges are fixed structures.\nThe vessel boasts a huge and sturdy with a large fender-like structure on the bow and various old tyre fenders on the port and starboard sides, while the gunwales/barriers have small cleats and open sections. There are various yellow-tipped situated around the deck and two large towing winches on the stern area, while the rearmost section has a slightly elevated platform with a single lifebuoy. Below the vessel, there is the large propulsion system, consisting of a tail shaft, a and dual rudder blades.\nThe deck is large and carries a three-storey , with access ladders on the back, tall hand rails around, additional lifebuoys and a tall with a single tube. The bottom cabin has numerous circular opaque windows and unusable access doors on the rear portions, while the middle cabin has transparent windows with unusable access doors and a fully-visible interior. The sits at the top and is the only accessible area of the vessel, having an open-door design and the helm inside where the captain stands behind it (in a similar way to the &lt;a href=\"Reefer\"&gt;Reefer&lt;/a&gt;). The roof mounts the radar mast and a single circular lamp, while a tall mainmast is situated behind, with cables attached to the roof of the same bridge and a headmast light/antenna on top.\nThe Tug is only seem in a rusty colour, with the hull mostly being black and the superstructure being of a brownish/reddish colour.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nReturning to as part of the update, the Tug has a similar design to the Janice Ann Reinauer and tug boats.\nThe Tug possesses the same design and features as the \"&lt;a href=\"Olifantus\"&gt;Olifantus&lt;/a&gt;\" prop found in the game, which in turn is a smaller variant of the \"GTA IV\" iteration. The hull remains largely similar to the previous iteration, but there are large access ladders that allow easier access to the vessel from the water, fewer tyre fenders on the port and starboard sides, numerous cleats painted in yellow, and loose cables on the mounted winches and rearmost platform, alongside the yellow-tipped bitts. The propulsion system below the hull has an enclosed shaft and a single rudder blade.\nChanges to the superstructure have been made as well; the top cabin was removed and the funnel has a sloped shape with dual tubes on top, while the lifebuoys are mounted beside the lower cabin and on the side hand rails. The former middle cabin becomes the main bridge and adopts an open-door design with an enlarged rear and side boxes derived from the top cabin, while the roof retains most of the features from the \"GTA IV\" iteration (albeit with a simplified radar mast). The mainmast has various cables/ropes and bears the &lt;a href=\"The%20Port%20Authority%20of%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;LSPA&lt;/a&gt; flag and two (specifically \"I\" and \"P\"), while a non-functional can be seen on top. The interior of the bridge has the corresponding helm/steering wheel and instruments, including analogue \"Truck\" dials and a functional interior light.\nThe Tug still has a rusty appearance as it did in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", but gains an updated scheme, consisting of a red/blue scheme with markings on the hull, and a white/blue scheme for the superstructure (which wraps the entire vehicle, as the files indicate it spawns in a white primary colour).\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe boat is very large, and as expected for a vehicle of its size, is very slow, even more so than a &lt;a href=\"Reefer\"&gt;Reefer&lt;/a&gt;. The Tug also possesses heavy control and very poor stopping power (due to the vehicle being a watercraft, coupled with its weight). Because of its obvious size, the Tug can easily flip other boats. The Tug can take numerous impacts from explosives or rockets before it is completely destroyed, since the water will set off any flame coming from the rear (where the propulsion system is located).\nWhilst on the Tug, the player cannot run, but the player may move faster if they aim with a pistol. Pressing the correct button to board the ship will also cause the player to automatically walk to the wheel of the boat. This vehicle can only properly contain one person in multiplayer (the driver), although others can still stand on the deck; however, these players will lose some control of their characters.\nWhen the boat is moving, they will also begin to glide off slowly; if anyone stands at the front of the boat, they will actually pass through the superstructure and see the water beneath. It is possible for passengers to stay on the boat by hanging onto the side of the boat's hull without letting go.\nThe Tug is powered by dual inboard engines powering a single propeller, similar to most real-life tugboats. They emit a generally low-revving and noisy sound, unique to this vehicle.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe boat retains most of its characteristics of being a heavy, slow and large boat. It is very sluggish and somewhat underpowered in the water, and slowing down may become problematic in high currents. It is the only watercraft in the game that can only seat one occupant (excluding the &lt;a href=\"Blazer%20Aqua\"&gt;Blazer Aqua&lt;/a&gt;, which is amphibious), but other players can stand on the boat's deck, allowing them to use any kind of weapon while the boat is in motion. However, the Tug's slow speed and decreased durability (it cannot survive a single explosion) do not make it a very useful vehicle in combat. The Tug is completely immune to damage from collisions.\nAgain, the Tug is powered by dual inboard engines powering a single propeller, which emit a generally low-revving and noisy sound.\nStatic Variants.\nClean Tug.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Port%20Tudor\"&gt;Port Tudor&lt;/a&gt;, there is a docked Tug inside a warehouse. It has much cleaner bodywork than those the player can use.\nOlifantus.\n\"Olifantus\" is the name for a tugboat based on the Tug, appearing as a prop in . The design is unchanged from the Tug, with the exception of a different paint job and the lack of the 3rd floor cab. The Olifantus serves as the livery for the Tug featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

Around the main section, the plane features side windows, sliding access doors and the inset sections and lower hatches for the retractable main undercarriage, while the upper area features the main wings with four engines on either side, which are actually part of a single component that tilts forwards or upwards. The tail boom is relatively long and features an open section for the gunner and a empennage, with the horizontal stabilizers mounted on the vertical one, as well as the corresponding tail landing undercarriage. The interior has ample room for the occupants and features a wide flight instrument with black and yellow dials, similar to older aircraft featured in the same update such as the &lt;a href=\"LF-22%20Starling\"&gt;LF-22 Starling&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"P-45%20Nokota\"&gt;P-45 Nokota&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost of the aircraft's body is painted in a primary color, while the underside and lower surfaces of the wings are painted in a secondary color. It uses a set of wheels similar to trucks like the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;, also seen on other aircraft.\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with a set of machine guns on the nose appearing to resemble and a single machine gun turret on the rear resembling a , the latter able to be modified with dual machine guns or a single &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt; resembling a 7.62mm gatling gun. It can be also modified with bombs.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Tula is a very versatile vehicle, as it has a VTOL mode similar to the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt; and amphibious capabilities, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Dodo\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn forward flight mode, the Tula accelerates rather slow, but is capable of reaching decent speeds, on par with aircraft like the &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20800\"&gt;Cuban 800&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Velum\"&gt;Velum&lt;/a&gt;. Its handling is generally good, able to maneuver the aircraft quickly, but its cumbersome weight does not allow to perform stunts for a prolonged period of time. The wingspan is rather wide, being susceptible to collide with objects when flying through tall structures such as the skyscrapers of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; or the wind turbines of &lt;a href=\"RON%20Alternates%20Wind%20Farm\"&gt;RON Alternates Wind Farm&lt;/a&gt;, but gives general stability on flight.\nIn vertical flight mode, the vehicle is rather slow compared to helicopters, but makes up for its quick and steady response when tilting the aircraft to a side, allowing to safely land on areas with little to no space for conventional planes (i.e. helipads) or for strafing/bombing runs. Similar to the Hydra, however, switching from vertical to forward mode may cause the vehicle to lose some altitude, so players should have the aircraft on a considerable height to avoid crashing it into any ground obstacle.\nCare should be taken when landing the plane on water, as a steep nosedive or a hard impact would either disable it or blast the ailerons, rendering it very difficult to use in forward flight mode. In fact, attempting to take off with the ailerons missing may cause a severely erratic behaviour, especially when equipped with JATO thrusters.\nThe Tula is powered by four engines according to the website description and in-game model. Its sound is similar to the one from the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;.\nJATO.\nThe aircraft can be equipped with eight thrusters, which are intended for a near-instant take-off and quick acceleration. JATO thrusters propel the aircraft for 5 seconds and are recharged upon landing only while in forward flight mode. If the plane is in vertical flight mode, it won't recharge until the player tilts the wings forward.\nDefense.\nSimilar to most aircraft featured in the update, the Tula can withstand two homing missiles before it is destroyed with a third one, making it a decent choice of transport. However, because of its size, the Tula can be an easy target. Also, because of its performance, the Tula may not be able to fight against more nimble weaponized aircraft or even any vehicle armed with homing missiles, as it lacks heavy weaponry. The gunner on the back is very exposed to gunfire and will fall off if the plane is flying upside-down.\nCountermeasures.\nThe vehicle can be fitted with countermeasures to improve its defensive capabilities against homing missiles, each one with their own attributes:\nNote that a co-pilot is required to use the countermeasures.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMachine Gun (nose)=\nMachine Gun=\nDual MG=\nMinigun=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

The vehicle also includes some details taken from other American cars from that era: its rear seems to be a cross of the and the . The Malibu's grille is stretched out beyond the headlights, which results in the grille ending similarly to the , while the front indicators and the front bumper cutouts seem to be reminiscent of a , albeit scaled down.\n\"Grand Theft Auto VI\".\nThe Tulip's reappearance in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto VI&lt;/a&gt;\" remains largely based on the 1972 Chevelle Malibu, but with various small detail changes carrying the influence further, including a set of wheels that are similar to those from the 1971 and 1972 Chevelle SS. The briefly-seen \"Tulip by Declasse\" badge seen on the rear is a reference to the seen on the Chevelle models from the aforementioned era, similar to the \"Vigero by Declasse\" badge seen on the back of the &lt;a href=\"Vigero\"&gt;Vigero&lt;/a&gt; referencing the \"Camaro by Chevrolet\" badge.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Tulip assumes a body shape similar to the &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20Turbo\"&gt;Sabre Turbo&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stallion\"&gt;Stallion&lt;/a&gt;, where the front end features a wide bumper with rectangular amber lights on either side, along with a license plate on the center. The upper area of the car is occupied by a grilled section bearing the manufacturer logo on the center and two circular headlights on the edges, housed within plastic, square-shaped sections. The hood is relatively simple and has a slightly pronounced center. On the sides, the car makes use of painted trims on the wheel arches, while two side-exit exhaust pipes can be seen near the rear wheels. The cabin area features painted trims passing above the windows and on the inner pillars, along with square-shaped mirrors. The rear of the car has a slanted trunk bearing silver \"DECLASSE\" lettering on the passenger side, while the bumper has the license plate on the center and a set of three vertical tail lights on the edges, together with what looks like bumper overriders beside the plate. On the underside, the car has a visible fuel tank. It uses the \"Dominator\" interior.\nThe car's bodywork, part of the engine and the rims are painted with the primary color, while the bumpers, grille and the trims found around the car are painted with the secondary color. It uses a set of wheels that are identical to the \"Spooner\" muscle wheels available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto VI\".\nFrom how it appears in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI/Trailers%23Trailer%201\"&gt;first trailer&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto VI&lt;/a&gt;\", the design of the Tulip remains largely identical with noteworthy enhancements in quality. These upgrades include the incorporation of 3D door/panel gaps, door key locks, a 3D grille badge, extra chrome trims, and detailed B-pillars. Alongside these quality improvements, the model undergoes certain design modifications such as the substitution of the roof with a vinyl counterpart, the addition of rear bumper stickers, a &lt;a href=\"Xero\"&gt;Xero&lt;/a&gt; windscreen sticker, metal sills running along the sides, detailed undercarriage elements, a fresh set of rims, front bumper bolts, and a cursive Tulip emblem on the passenger side of its trunk. Notably, it boasts a weathered paint job with additional worn detailing on the metal sills, lights, vinyl roof, and all chrome components. \nIt is the only vehicle in the first trailer which can be seen close-up, particularly its interior, revealing an entirely unique, high-detailed interior, with a unique instrument setup, leatherette seats, new door cards and functional, fully reflective side-view and rear-view mirrors. A later shot also depicts trash in the footwells. \nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Tulip's speed and handling is remarkable, though tedious when driving it the first time and it has bouts of high wheelspin upon taking off. Its suspension travel when airborne is problematic and can be relatively jumpy around bumps and has bouts of oversteer if turning a corner too hard without properly managing it. Not only that, its steering is quite jerky on even the slightest turns. Even with fully upgraded suspension, it still has issue with oversteer. Still, the Tulip is quite the competitor for races and can easily catch up to equally-faster vehicles at the hands of an expert driver.\nWhen modified with a supercharger upgrade, the bypass valves will open and close when revving the engine. The Tulip's wheels will also camber negatively with suspension modifications.\nThe car holds a V8 engine with a mounted cylinder air filter, positioned in a front-engine, rear wheel drive configuration through a 4-speed gearbox. Its engine sound appears to be a combination of the sounds found on the &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Imperator\"&gt;Imperator&lt;/a&gt;, with the former faintly heard on higher revolutions."}

At the time, it was presumed that O'Malley had friends in criminally high places. Now it seems he was freed so he could be silenced, or punished for past crimes. Police have no leads on what might have been behind the need to silence or kill Mr. O'Malley, 48.

He asks Niko to kill Aiden when he is being taken back to the &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20State%20Correctional%20Facility\"&gt;Alderney State Correctional Facility&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nThe mission starts with Niko ready to do as he is told, when &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McReary\"&gt;Patrick \"Packie\" McReary&lt;/a&gt; calls and informs him that he will help him on this mission. He also informs Niko that carrying out the mission as Derrick ordered is a bad idea because O'Malley is under heavy police custody, and if he is killed in the presence of the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt;, Derrick would be the first person to be questioned about it. To avoid this, Packie suggests making it look like Aiden is being broken out of jail.\nPackie further tells Niko that he left a &lt;a href=\"Biff\"&gt;Biff&lt;/a&gt; truck in an alleyway that will be useful in the jail bust. He hid a &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt; inside as well. The first part of the mission is to pick up the truck which is now marked on the radar. Once inside, Niko calls Packie, who is out driving a truck of his own and following the convoy that carries Aiden. He tells Niko that the plan is to ambush the convoy in the &lt;a href=\"Booth%20Tunnel\"&gt;Booth Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;\nThe truck provided by Packie must be driven to the Booth Tunnel and, once inside, parked perpendicular to the road so that it serves as a roadblock. The game goes to a cutscene. The convoy carrying Aiden O'Malley arrives and is halted by the truck. Packie arrives in his vehicle, and does the same as Niko, sandwiching the convoy between the two trucks. The police are more than suspicious by this point. One particular officer exits his squad car with the intent of instructing Niko to move his vehicle.\nThe cutscene ends with Niko outside the truck on the opposite side of the convoy, now armed with a rocket launcher. Now the fireworks begin. All of the police and &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; officers must be eliminated before proceeding. However, the &lt;a href=\"Stockade\"&gt;Stockade&lt;/a&gt; in which Aiden is held must not be destroyed or else the mission will be failed. Packie will help eliminate some officers. The two police cars nearest Niko can be safely destroyed with the rocket launcher, after which gunning down the few remaining officers with your choice of assault rifle shouldn't present much difficulty.\nOnce the officers are down, Niko will hop in the driver's seat of the van, and Packie will sit in the back and keep watch on Aiden. After leaving the Booth Tunnel, the player must get rid of his wanted level. This can be done either in Alderney or Algonquin.\nAfter you have lost your wanted level, Niko relays to Packie that the van stands out, and they have to ditch it. A new destination will be marked by the GPS, where the Stockade must be parked and changed for another, less conspicious car.\nOnce all three men are inside, Niko will be instructed by Packie to drive to the cliffs in Leftwood. The destination will be marked by the GPS. On the way, Aiden will ask about who sent Niko and Packie to help him escape and where will he be taken. Packie will give answers hinting at Aiden's execution.\nOnce you get to the cliffs, all three men exit the car and the game goes to a cutscene. Watch Aiden preach his gratitude on the edge of a very disappointingly low cliff. Aiden requests once more who put Niko and Packie up to springing him free, and to his dismay, \"Derrick McReary\" is the answer. Packie angrily condemns Aiden for his loose tongue and orders Niko to get rid of him. Packie gets into the car, and drives away leaving Niko with Aiden.\nThe player may kill Aiden in any way he likes. If he is shot, a small cutscene will show him falling off the edge and hitting the rocks, ending up in the water. Once Aiden is dead, the mission is over and Niko will call Derrick to tell him of Aiden's death."}

In the PSP and mobile versions, the Turismo has even more C6 influence, to the point that it closely resembles the &lt;a href=\"Coquette\"&gt;Coquette&lt;/a&gt;. \nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe car assumes a sleek and aerodynamic design. characterized by its extensive length and distinctive rear taillights and rear vent. The rear of the car features a tall, double-fin spoiler by default. Below the rear vent, a number plate appearing to emulate &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an number plates can be seen. In the \"\", this plate is replaced with a blank, standard American-style number plate.\nThe Turismo is seen in a variety of single colours, being applied to the entire body and the spoiler.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Turismo gains a major redesign compared to its previous iteration. It remains a sleek and aerodynamic sports car, but has an overall smaller footprint and a more rounded design. The vehicle is characterized by its large front trunk area, its rear fender intakes, and its distinctive taillight and rear grille assembly, which bears a slight resemblance to its \"\" counterpart. The rear fender intakes of the Turismo may randomly spawn either as flat slatted grilles or as scooped intakes.\nThe Turismo's sporty interior is heavily clad in tan leather on the dash and seats. A \"TURISMO\" badge can be seen on the door seams when the doors are open, as well as on the dial cluster and glovebox (albeit in a heavily low quality). A low-quality Grotti badge can be seen on the horn cap.\nThe Turismo spawns in a variety of single colours applied to the entire body. It uses a set of 12-spoke rims with bolt details on the outer section.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe Turismo in \"\" largely retains the \"GTA IV\" appearance, with several design differences depending on the version played. In the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20DS\"&gt;Nintendo DS&lt;/a&gt; version, the vehicle remains largely similar to the \"GTA IV\" rendition, with subtle changes to the shape of the headlights. In the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%20Portable\"&gt;PSP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Apple%20iOS\"&gt;mo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"Android%20OS\"&gt;bile&lt;/a&gt; versions of the game, the design differences are more substantial, with the headlights bearing a slight resemblance to the &lt;a href=\"Coquette\"&gt;Coquette&lt;/a&gt;, being moved further up the front end of the car.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe engine appears to be a V6 equipped with three carburetors/throttle bodies on top, which is coupled to a five-speed gearbox in a mid engine, all wheel drive layout. It uses the high-revving engine sound from high-end sports cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Super%20GT\"&gt;Super GT&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Autoeroticar.com\"&gt;Autoeroticar.com&lt;/a&gt;, the Turismo's engine in \"GTA IV\" is a high-revving 4.0L Quad Cam V8 fitted to 5-speed manual transmission. Its engine model is roughly similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt; of the same game, with \"GROTTI\" printed on the cam covers. True to the website statement, it is coupled to a 5-speed manual gearbox in a rear engine, rear wheel drive layout. The website also specifies that the vehicle features ABS, which is somewhat complemented with the fact that the wheels rarely lock under braking pressure (unless the car encounters a significant bump on the road), as well as having good steering capabilities while braking. It has a unique engine sound, being high-revving and high-pitched, yet with a rather quiet tone compared to the one used on the &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Super%20GT\"&gt;SuperGT&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe Turismo still performs very well like in \"GTA IV\", and the mid engine layout also means that it is shielded from frontal impacts and mildly shielded from rear impacts. Similarly to \"GTA IV\", the Turismo has low resistance to gunfire."}

Also, killing any of the opponents will lead to the race being called off. \nAs with the races in \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\", the bike races are more difficult than those in \"\" due to &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;Vic&lt;/a&gt;'s propensity of being thrown from the bike after hitting the slightest obstacle and for the most part the courses are short enough \u2013 and some only require 1 lap \u2013 that any delay of this nature can result in a loss.\nThe Turismo races are unique among \"GTA III\" era race missions in that it costs money for each attempt at the race. If a race is failed, Victor has to return to either Sunshine Autos or to the fairground to trigger another attempt (paying the entry fee again), and then go back to the starting point of the race."}

The side vents and partially hidden headlights are most likely taken from the ; however, the headlights feature a layout similar to the parking lights on the . The exhausts are inspired by the , while the door handles are identical to those found on the . \nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Turismo Classic is distinguished by its simplistic design with sporty elements around it, where the front bumper feature split grilles and a lower grille vent intended to allow air to flow underneath the car, followed by small ducts on the wheels arches intended for brake cooling. Above the bumper, there is a sloping bonnet that holds the integrated pop-up headlamps, the blue Grotti badge on the centre, the side vented sections and the single slit intake near the cowl for radiator and air cooling. The headlamps themselves consist of four rectangular units, the inner ones being large main lamps and the outer ones being smaller turn signals, with black details around them. Unlike most pop-up headlamps from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Tropos%20Rallye\"&gt;Tropos Rallye&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Infernus%20Classic\"&gt;Infernus Classic&lt;/a&gt;, the lamps are not fully hidden within the car's body. The bonnet hinges from the front and opens forward to reveal a spacious luggage compartment and portions covering the wheels.\nThe side profile is aerodynamic, with a wheelbase that is relatively short when compared to the &lt;a href=\"Infernus%20Classic\"&gt;Infernus Classic&lt;/a&gt;. The car's most prominent feature is the inset door panels which allow for air to flow continuously to the rear intakes, leading to the engine bay (upper) and brakes (lower), accompanied by a slight curve that blends into the rear arches. It is on this curve that the car's door handles are mounted on. On the greenhouse area, the A-pillar sweeps over the cabin, before dipping to form the C-pillar, and flowing into the rear fenders, while the curved glass of the rear quarter windows directs air into the additional engine intakes situated behind them. The large rear window allows for an unspoiled view of the hulking, mid-mounted V12 engine. Large wing mirrors supported by two thin, curved frames can be seen mounted on the A-pillars.\nOn the rear fascia, a black section can be seen partially covered by a decorative grill that extend their entire width. This section holds large rectangular tail lamps on the outer side and square-shaped smaller lamps on the inner side, along with the Grotti wordmark on the upper left corner and a unique Turismo badging on the centre. Directly below the black section, six small exit vents can be seen on either side of the car, with a trapezium-shaped section between the inner vents. The rear bumper holds a license plate on the centre and features large outer edges, with dedicated slots for the dual, twin-exit exhausts with a black trim around. The engine compartment opens forward too to reveal the engine, the black sections and the exhaust tubes leading to the rear end of the car, featuring two support arms on either side.\nThe interior of the car is very unique, with white stitching below the dash, on the steering wheel, on the central console and the seats. The dials and gauges were borrowed from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt;, but are placed on square-shaped slots found on the dial cluster and the central console. A Grotti wordmark can be seen below the passenger glove compartment, while the gear stick and the switches can be seen on the central section between the seats. The blue Grotti badging can be seen on the horn cap.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary colour is applied on the mirror wings. A trim colour is also available for the interior, painting the dashboard and the doorcards. It uses a set of wheels identical to the \"Five Star\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, albeit using more bolt details on the surrounding.\nIf purchased through &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Motorsport\"&gt;Legendary Motorsport&lt;/a&gt;, the Turismo Classic will be fitted a stock wing that resembles the Ferrari F40's stock spoiler; however, if spawned through other means, the wing will not be installed. The spoiler can be seen on the Legendary Motorsport gallery.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Turismo Classic has a perfect mix between sleek, aerodynamic design and lightweight bodywork, allowing for good acceleration and a high top speed. The vehicle's powerful V12 engine can be seen mounted in a rear-mid position, powering the rear wheels. The car's handling is stellar in its class, providing good downforce and stable cornering. The brakes are somewhat poor compared to more modern vehicles, but compared to its classmates in Sports Classics, they are more than acceptable. However, it has a somewhat poor turning radius, and can be prone to spinning out.\nDespite the car's age, it features a 6-speed gearbox like its rival, the &lt;a href=\"Infernus%20Classic\"&gt;Infernus Classic&lt;/a&gt;, allowing for high potential. It is the fastest Sports Classics vehicle around a traditional circuit as well.\nThe engine sound is high-revving, appearing to be an edited version of the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; engine.\nWith the HSW upgrade applied, the engine note will be much higher-pitched and will have a different exhaust \u2018pop\u2019 sound when an aftermarket exhaust is fitted."}

It has decent acceleration at low and medium speeds, being able to keep up with the &lt;a href=\"Emerus\"&gt;Emerus&lt;/a&gt;, another expensive high performance hypercar, but its low top speed of around 121 mph means it will be overtaken by most other supercars on a long straight.\nThe traction and grip of the Turismo Omaggio, on the other hand, are in a class of their own, being able to clear corners at a speed even cars specialized for racing cannot, while keeping a great handling line without understeer or oversteer. Such handling combined with its high downforce and minimal loss of grip on off-road surfaces make it a great car to drive around in, regardless of weather or road conditions. \nOverall, despite the low top speed of the Turismo Omaggio, its performance in corners and high adaptability to different driving conditions make it a highly worthwhile vehicle to use in races with plenty of corners and few straights, or for just driving around the map. The Turismo Omaggio's friendly handling also makes it easy to drive for beginners, while skilled racers are to push its performance to its absolute limit without fear of sudden loss of control.\nModifications.\nThe vehicle can be customized in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, although special upgrades (tagged with ) are only available at the vehicle workshop inside &lt;a href=\"Agencies\"&gt;Agencies&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "109561", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=109561", "title": "Turismo R", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Grotti\"&gt;Grotti&lt;/a&gt; Turismo R is a hypercar featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the &lt;a href=\"Business%20Update\"&gt;Business Update&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\nThe design of the Turismo R is heavily inspired by , as seen in its side profile and greenhouse area, as well as incorporating additional elements taken from the design studies that served as a base for the LaFerrari. The front fascia of the car seem to be inspired by either the or the concept cars, while the headlights seem to be borrowed from the . The side vents, rear indicators, and shape of the rear seems to bear some resemblance to the . The rear also somewhat resembles the , especially with the \"GT Wing\" spoiler options applied. The tail lights are laid out similarly to those on the . The engine bay is reused from the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; and is configured and modeled after the .\nThe \"Aero Split Wing\" spoiler, \"White Accents,\" and \"Red Accents\" livery options appear to be taken from the .\nDesign.\nThe Turismo R is made up of many sharp curves and edges, giving it an aggressive appearance. The front end of the car is rather curved and features a insert at the bottom centre, as well as a CFRP separation on the middle section that separates the meshed intakes. The upper area is rather bulky on the outer sides and has two black vertical housings, each one containing dual circular lamps. The bonnet area assumes a prominent wedge shape and has two V-shaped intakes around the middle section, with a small distance between each other. The Grotti emblem can be seen on the edge of the bonnet area.\nOn the sides, the car makes use of large concave sections running through the doors and going towards the rear intakes, featuring carbon-fibre skirts at the bottom and black details on the upper borders, along with silver \"Grotti\" lettering near the front wheels. There are also large curved panels covering the rear intakes, bearing \"Turismo R\" badges on them. The pillars and the roof of the area are finished in carbon fibre, with the former holding rear-view mirror wings around the middle, and the latter having an impressed area on the centre.\nThe rear of the car consist of a slanted section behind the cabin that is mounted over a concave shape, where it features a triangle-shaped window with four small vents on either side, where the engine bay is located. There are two elevated sections between the slanted back and the rear bulky fenders, housing large intakes intended to direct air flow to the engine bay and rear exit vents. The rear end of the car houses two additional curved vents, a central section with the Grotti logo and dual circular tail lamps on the upper edges, along with a \"Turismo R\" badge on the passenger side. This whole section act as a rear clam for the engine bay, which hinges from the rear and opens to reveal the engine, the carbon-fibre separation of the cabin and black frames around. The lower area of the rear consist of a carbon-fibre section with two L-shaped light strips on the outer edges, the twin rear diffusers with three blades each and the central section with the license plate and the twin circular exhaust tubes. The underside of the car is mostly carbon plated, leaving the gearbox/diff exposed.\nThe interior of the car is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;, using the same dial set, layout and features. The Grotti emblem can be seen in the centre of the steering wheel.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary colour is applied on the portions around the cabin, the mirror wings, the side panels of the rear intakes and the interior stitching. The car uses a set of wheels similar to the \"Sinthetic Z\" sports rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, but the circular detail on the centre is slightly larger. It also has low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\nThe Turismo R falls just short of being one of the fastest Super Cars in the game. Acceleration is excellent and there is a nice amount of wheel spin. Top speed is also very good, being as fast as the Zentorno. Because the car contains an electric motor, there is no loss of power during gear shifts. Therefore, the engine has a reputation for being very smooth and immediate. The engine is one of the most technologically advanced engines in the game. However, the Turismo R can be damaged very quickly often resulting in the hood coming off after a few collisions, especially at a high rate of speed. Unlike most quickly damaged cars, the wheels do not lock very often.\nJust like the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;, if the suspension is lowered to the maximum through &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, the Turismo R is able to drive right under high-suspension vehicles, such as the &lt;a href=\"Sandking%20XL\"&gt;Sandking XL&lt;/a&gt;, at high speed and sometimes some low-suspension vehicles if driving head-on against them. The only downside to this, however, is that it has the tendency to hit curbs much more easily, damaging the car and even flipping it over. The same is true of the &lt;a href=\"Zentorno\"&gt;Zentorno&lt;/a&gt;, even with default suspension.\nThe engine model appears to be a single-overhead camshaft V8, evidently by the exhaust manifolds seen when the rear hood is removed, while the in-game website claimed the engine is a V12. The car features intercoolers located directly after the side-intakes, suggesting the car is turbocharged. The exact same engine model is found in the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;. It shares its engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Feltzer\"&gt;Feltzer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carbonizzare\"&gt;Carbonizzare&lt;/a&gt;."}

It has a 3-box design with four pillars. Like the other armoured vehicles in the game, the vehicle adds armour padding on the sides and window armouring on the pillars. The sunroof from its standard equivalent was replaced by a turret similar to the ones from the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Armored%20Boxville\"&gt;Armored Boxville&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle is only available in a black colour. Its wheels share the same rim design as the \"Diamond Cut\" sport rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nThe vehicle &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;features&lt;/a&gt; a mounted &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt; similar to the ones seen on the side of the &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie%20MOD.0\"&gt;Valkyrie MOD.0&lt;/a&gt; (being a ), though the iron sight is absent.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nIn terms of driving, the vehicle is extremely nimble. It shares many of its characteristics with the &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt;, rather than the &lt;a href=\"Schafter%20V12\"&gt;V12&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Schafter%20LWB\"&gt;LWB&lt;/a&gt; counterparts. In this respect, the car has average acceleration, comparable to the said vehicle, with a slightly lower top speed. The car is relatively light when driven, deceiving its armored appearance, which allows good acceleration and even better traction; little wheelspin is seen when setting of the vehicle. Not only is the power-to-weight ratio impressive, but it also has a great cornering radius, which is much better than the slightly shorter &lt;a href=\"Stretch\"&gt;Stretch&lt;/a&gt;, even despite its wheelbase length and armor, but rear-ending the limo causes it to lose control due to the lack of weight, as well as the extended wheelbase.\nSimilar to the &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt; and its derivatives, the Turreted Limo has an engine cover similar to that of a typical covered V8 engine, although much simplier in detailing (it does not have protuding bolts for the cam covers). Said engine is coupled to a 4-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive configuration. Its sound is also the same as cars such as the Schafter or the &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor/Defense.\nLike other armored vehicles, the Turreted Limo features a reinforced armor that withstand a single explosive and bulletproof windows that provide decent protection until they shatter. The car is, however, significantly weaker than the other armored vehicles in the game. While the armored padding on the side doors does protect it from explosions, the car's light weight makes it prone to flipping or being sent flying into the air, which can often result in getting stuck. Not only is durability insufficient. Frontal impacts cause little damage to its lighting system; however, the vehicle's front end is still rather deformable, unlike the other armored Schafters (to which the limo is based on). All in all, the car is extremely well performing due to the shared platforms, however its armor can be said to deceive its actual efficiency, assuming that the Turreted Limo is not used for offensive purposes, unlike the well-armored Insurgent Pick Up.\nWeaponry.\nMachine Gun: the mounted minigun on the back of the vehicle works similarly to the port and starboard guns from the Valkyrie, being relatively good at taking out targets and vehicles due to the fire rate and the ability to blow up vehicles upon being damaged enough (while machine guns can only set them aflame and require additional rounds to finally destroy them). However, damage is relatively lower than the guns from the Insurgent and &lt;a href=\"Technical\"&gt;Technical&lt;/a&gt;, taking a bit longer to take out heavily armored vehicles. Both the gun and the turret hatch may offer some degree of protection against ground-level enemies, but they are still vulnerable to getting shot from the sides or elevated areas. Gunners will also fall if the vehicle flips to one side.\nThe rear passengers on the Turreted Limo can toggle between ducking into the vehicle or getting on the gunner seat by pressing right on the D-Pad. This tactic can be extremely useful in case the gunner is very weak and needs to regenerate their health back by ducking into the car, or to prevent falling off from the vehicle, as explained before. Once they regain their health or the vehicle is upright again, they can press right on the D-Pad to get back up on the gunner seat. Another tactic can be done if there are multiple players on the rear seats, they can take turns being gunners. The ability to use the turret can be done either from the passenger seats or while standing on the roof in case that both rear seats are occupied and another player wants to use the turret.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMachine Gun=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

A Haitian Gang Lord died recently, apparently the Cubans did it but nobody knows for sure. Avery wants Tommy to make the Haitians sure they did it by killing the new &lt;a href=\"Haitian%20Gang%20Lord\"&gt;Haitian Gang Lord&lt;/a&gt; at the old one's funeral.\nThe Mission.\nAfter getting the briefing from Avery, head down to the &lt;a href=\"Little%20Havana%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Little Havana&lt;/a&gt; clothes store and pick up a Cuban Hombre outfit. Then get a car and drive to the funeral which is located next to the &lt;a href=\"Little%20Haiti%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Little Haiti&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Well%20Stacked%20Pizza%20Co.\"&gt;Pizzeria&lt;/a&gt;, as of this part, there are various ways to kill the Haitian Gang Lord:\nThis is the easiest method and with greater chance of success:\nGrab the Cuban clothing first, then take a helicopter and use it to land on the roof of the building that is just across the funeral. While arriving at there, get to the corner of the roof. The Haitians will be spotted and begin shooting at the player, then use a sniper-rifle to kill the Haitian Gang Lord before he gets away in a &lt;a href=\"Romero%27s%20Hearse\"&gt;Romero's Hearse&lt;/a&gt; (be aware of a time limit about 10 seconds) and thereafter use the helicopter to escape avoiding the Haitians.\nThis technique is virtually fool-proof, but none of the two special cars that appear in this mission can be obtained by doing this trick, unless the player gets off the roof after killing the Haitian Gang Lord and run in one of them.\nFor the second method, having a &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Sniper Rifle&lt;/a&gt; in the weapon inventory. Drive to the funeral and pull out the Sniper, take aim and kill the Gang Lord. Don't be worried about the mission failure, because if the target is missed, the snipe rifle will accidentally shoot down either one of the gangs instead of a Haitian Gang Lord or in the air, which attracts attention to the Haitians, and the game will order the player to chase down the Gang Lord.\nFor the third method, an &lt;a href=\"Uzi\"&gt;Uzi&lt;/a&gt;, Mac or any type of sub-machine gun will be required, since it will be needed to shoot fast and then run. Get to the funeral, pull out the sub-machine gun and run towards the Gang Lord, avoiding gunfire from the Haitian Bodyguards, then open fire and shoot him. Then run out of there before the Haitians could &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;eliminate Tommy&lt;/a&gt;. Having a body armor to protect from the Haitians' gunfire, but make sure to run away as fast as possible, because the worn armor wearing won't last from the gunfire.\nThe fourth method is to get the rocket launcher (either collect 70 hidden packages or get it from Hooker Inn's pool). It would help greatly if the player gained the \"fast reload\" capability but without it, will also work. First park the get away car some place further away, then fire a rocket from the launcher, it will be noticed that the car does not get destroyed by the splash damage. Once arrived, park the car, get out and run some place near funeral car driven by the Haitian lord without alerting the guards. Take out the rocket launcher and aim at the riff raff. Start spamming the rockets if the player has \"Fast reload\" ability. The rockets should have no problem taking out the guards, cars and the crime lord even if he gets into the vehicle. Once he is eliminated, sprint rapidly to the get away car and get out of Little Haiti.\nA fifth, quick method is to drive with a car right behind the alleyway where the gang lord is located, leave the car, get on it and take a clean sight of him. Shoot him in the head with any weapon available and leave quickly. This will avoid to face the rest of the Haitians and it'll be able complete the mission quickly. Alternatively, if you have &lt;a href=\"Grenades\"&gt;Grenades&lt;/a&gt; can just throw one over far enough to blow him up.\nThe sixth method or the normal way is getting to the funeral and using any weapon, (a submachine gun is recommended), and start killing Haitian Bodyguards, eventually the Gang Lord will get in a &lt;a href=\"Romero\"&gt;Romero's Hearse&lt;/a&gt; and drive away. Get in a fast car and ram into the hearse, but watch out for bombs inside the coffins when one of the Haitian gangs drop it in the back of the hearse. When the car catches fire, the Gang Lord will get out of the Hearse and make a run for it, the player can simply either get out of the car and shoot him or simply run him over. Watch out though. The Haitian Gang Lord is carrying an &lt;a href=\"M4%20Carbine\"&gt;M4 Carbine&lt;/a&gt; assault rifle, so run him over instead, after shooting down his gangs.\nWhen the Gang Lord is eliminated, leave Little Haiti and the mission will be complete.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nReward.\nThe reward for completing this mission is &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;2500 and the mission &lt;a href=\"Stunt%20Boat%20Challenge\"&gt;Stunt Boat Challenge&lt;/a&gt; is unlocked.\nPost Mission Phone Call.\n&lt;a href=\"Umberto%20Robina\"&gt;Umberto Robina&lt;/a&gt;: Hey &lt;a href=\"Leo%20Teal\"&gt;Leo&lt;/a&gt;!

His debut studio album \"Goblin\" (&lt;a href=\"2011\"&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;) brought him mainstream exposure, which was aided by the popularity of the single \"Yonkers\" and its accompanying music video.

It uses a set of rims similar to the \"Chromatic Z\" high-end rims available in mod shops, with at least two colour sets with either white or black rims.\nPerformance.\nThe Tyrant's straight line performance is similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Entity%20XXR\"&gt;Entity XXR&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taipan\"&gt;Taipan&lt;/a&gt;, cars featured in the same Southern San Andreas Super Sport Series DLC. However, the Tyrant has great handling and is very stable, unlike the aforemetioned cars. Owing to its size, the Tyrant cannot squeeze through narrow areas easily, although its mass often means slightly better pushing capabilities than most supercars.\nThe Tyrant has all four advanced flags enabled:\nThe engine sound seems to be similar to the one found on the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;."}

The bonnet may be inspired by the , while the headlight and other elements could be influenced by either the or the .\nDesign.\nThe Tyrus features a distinctively long body and a very aerodynamic design, where the front end has a plastic extender/splitter at the bottom. A set of mesh intakes can be seen on the vertical section of the car, the central one having a curvature on the upper side and a racing hook centered on it, followed by two split curved intakes on the edges and two canards on the front quarters of the vehicle. On the upper area, the car features a set of dual circular lamps with small turn signals, which are located in black housings and behind glass casings, together with bolted-on plastic trims around it. The bonnet is relatively aerodynamic, sporting a central intake, two concave sections, bolt details and safety pins.\nOn the sides, the front fenders feature bolted-on extensions and flat rear fenders with bolt details on the upper side, along with plastic skirts slightly extending out of the body. Two inset formations can be seen through the doors, with the upper one starting from the front vents and leading to the rear ones intended to direct airflow to the engine bay, and the lower one leading to a lower vent intended to direct airflow to the rear brakes. The cabin area makes use of plastic trim with a &lt;a href=\"Pi%C3%9Fwasser\"&gt;Pi\u00dfwasser&lt;/a&gt; banner on the top side of the windscreen and rear-quarter panels with circular vents, as well as the corresponding butterfly doors with bolted-on side windows and sections of the roof being carried with the door, although the hinge itself appears to be absent. The roof area features a long front scoop with an aerial mounted over it, while the area behind the cabin has an openable engine compartment with horizontal slatted vents on the sides and small vertical vents on the centre. Further towards the rear end, there is a smaller scoop with a vented panel intended to direct airflow to the gearbox/diff area, as well as a large spoiler mounted over the vented panel and a lip/ducktail spoiler on the rear end.\nThe rear end of the car has black panels holding the circular tail lamps, a central vent with \"PROGEN\" lettering on the lower passenger side and small upper strips for the third brake light and the reverse lights. The lower area is occupied by two rear vents with a single horizontal separation and a central meshed vent, with open sections for the twin-exit, twin exhaust tubes and the license plate in between the exhausts. The entire underside of the vehicle is carbon-plated, with an open section for the gearbox/diff and a diffuser on the rear end, with large horizontal panels mounted between the vertical blades.\nThe interior of the car makes use of steel foot rests, a carbon-fibre floor and carbon-fibre sport seats with race seatbelts, along with a coloured roll cage. The Tyrus includes various switches and buttons on the center console and passenger side and features a knob reading F/R, likely indicating a rear/four wheel drive locking diff. An RPM indicator can be seen in the gauge cluster below the digital dial, and a large extended gear-shifter is centralized on the console between the seats. Also, a radio is seen located under the dashboard, on the passenger side.\nThe vehicle only has a primary colour applied on the bodywork, roll cage, and interior stitching. Although not accessible, a trim colour is applied on the cage paddings and a dial colour for the digital display, which are set to black in purchased examples. Similar to vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"ETR1\"&gt;ETR1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"RE-7B\"&gt;RE-7B&lt;/a&gt;, the Tyrus features &lt;a href=\"Atomic\"&gt;Atomic&lt;/a&gt; racing slicks for the stock wheels, with the rims having six spokes and an hexagonal centre. The rims can also support a dedicated wheel colour, although it is only present in examples generated in the &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe liveries have the following sponsors:\nPerformance.\nThe car performs extremely well. The car has extreme grip, but can still understeer around corners occasionally. It has a high top speed thanks to its extreme power.\nUnder the engine cover is a V8 engine reused from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Reaper\"&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, with what appears to be two cold-air intake systems coming from the roof scoop (ram-air intake) of the car in a similar manner to cars like the &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20GT\"&gt;Rapid GT&lt;/a&gt;, powering the rear wheels through a 6-speed gearbox. The engine sound is similar to the &lt;a href=\"X80%20Proto\"&gt;X80 Proto&lt;/a&gt;, being a very high revving engine, and the car tends to backfire when decelerating or revving quickly. When powered down, the engine shares the same sound effect used on the &lt;a href=\"Shotaro\"&gt;Shotaro&lt;/a&gt; and X80 Proto."}

Route 1 travels along the western and northern coastlines of &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;. The route covers the entire Great Ocean Highway, from its southern terminus in &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro\"&gt;Del Perro&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Dignity%20Village\"&gt;Dignity Village&lt;/a&gt;.

Once leaving the tunnel, the six lane &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro%20Freeway\"&gt;Del Perro Freeway&lt;/a&gt; travels northwest along the edge of &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro%20Beach\"&gt;Del Perro Beach&lt;/a&gt;. Even as a freeway, beachfront property still lines the side of the road. The Del Perro Freeway ends near &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Bluffs\"&gt;Pacific Bluffs&lt;/a&gt; (and a possible &lt;a href=\"Route%2018\"&gt;Route 18&lt;/a&gt; west end) and begins to narrow down until the south end of Ineseno Road, where it turns north and becomes a divided two lane highway. It then runs through &lt;a href=\"Chumash\"&gt;Chumash&lt;/a&gt; and along the west edge of the &lt;a href=\"Tongva%20Hills\"&gt;Tongva Hills&lt;/a&gt; where it eventually meets the western terminus of &lt;a href=\"Route%2068\"&gt;Route 68&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt then crosses the &lt;a href=\"Lago%20Zancudo\"&gt;Lago Zancudo&lt;/a&gt; bridge, and passes under &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt; through a tunnel, emerging into &lt;a href=\"North%20Chumash\"&gt;North Chumash&lt;/a&gt;. Near &lt;a href=\"Raton%20Canyon\"&gt;Raton Canyon&lt;/a&gt;, it creates an S-curve before driving over another bridge and traveling in a northeastern direction.

The UFO above &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt; has a locked-vehicle script and seems to be protected by force-fields, as the player can be thrown away from it while trying to parachute to the top. The UFO above &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt; will push the player away if approached too closely, while the UFO on top of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt; will simply vanish (it is not solid).\nBe careful when approaching them in an aircraft; when the player is near any of the UFOs, these will cause a temporary engine shutdown, making it a risk to collide with them when travelling directly toward them. The UFOs are immune to weapons and are unable to be locked-on with the &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"P-996%20Lazer\"&gt;P-996 Lazer&lt;/a&gt; targetting.\nThe sound effects heard when standing close to either the FIB UFO or the Fort Zancudo UFO can be listened to .\nFort Zancudo UFO writings.\nThe words \"Segregate and Rearrange\" are present on the cockpit of the Fort Zancudo UFO (rearranging the letters from \"segregate\" can lead to the words \"Easter egg\"). \nMount Chiliad Drawing.\nA mysterious drawing on a wall in the Mount Chiliad &lt;a href=\"Cable%20Car\"&gt;cable car&lt;/a&gt; station appears to show the mountain with lightning emanating from it and an odd symbol, possibly an eye or a UFO, on top. Other notable details on the drawing are depictions of a UFO, a person on a jetpack, a cracked egg, and multiple boxes with Xs in the middle of them. Nothing else is known about the meaning of the drawing.\nUnder the observation platform on top of the mountain is the same symbol featured on top of the drawing. Carved on the side of the platform are the words \"Come back when your story is complete\". This serves only to inform the player that they must reach 100% completion in order to see the UFO. This same symbol is also painted on the side of the mountain and in the &lt;a href=\"Beam%20Me%20Up\"&gt;Beam Me Up&lt;/a&gt; area in Sandy Shores, along with a drawing of a rain cloud and the moon, another way to inform the player of the UFOs viewing requirements, in this case being stormy weather and the time being 3AM.\nLocations.\nThese cannot be seen from a great distance.

It is part of the &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Paper%20Trail\"&gt;Operation Paper Trail&lt;/a&gt; mission strand.\nDescription.\nBefore the mission starts, ULP will call the player about &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Johnson\"&gt;Agent Johnson's&lt;/a&gt; report, to inform that the &lt;a href=\"Duggan%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Duggans&lt;/a&gt; are leveraging some kind of high-advanced neural network, and AI program to inflate gas prices and manipulate every aspect of the global oil market to their advantage, thus dificulting the trace. However, due to their recent actions, the Duggans are moving the tech to a more secure location and they have to intercept it.\nAt the start of the mission, the player is tasked to search the van that is being marked on the map. However, ULP informs that there is a jamming network interfering with the signal and that the player must deal with it by destroying the jammer antennas.\nThere are five jammers located on the top of various buildings, guarded by Duggan members. Destroying all jammers is not mandatory, but will reduce the size of the search area. When all the jammers are destroyed, the van will be precisely marked on the map.\nOnce the van is stolen, the player must bring it to a &lt;a href=\"TPI%20Meth%20Lab\"&gt;drop-off&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Great%20Chaparral\"&gt;Great Chaparral&lt;/a&gt;.

At the drop-off, there will be two IAA agents with an &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Cruiser\"&gt;Unmarked Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; nearby. After bringing the van, the mission is completed."}

It is the last part of the &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Paper%20Trail\"&gt;Operation Paper Trail&lt;/a&gt; mission strand.\nDescription.\nBefore the mission starts, ULP will call the player that the situation with the &lt;a href=\"Duggan%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Duggans&lt;/a&gt; has been resolved and the crisis has been adverted. However, he informs that there is still one loose end to tie off so this won't happen again, and that is in the servers at &lt;a href=\"Avon%20Hertz\"&gt;Avon Hertz's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20Launch%20Facility\"&gt;missile silo&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; is then required to deal with the remnants of &lt;a href=\"Cliffford\"&gt;Cliffford&lt;/a&gt; and end this permanently.\nAt the start of the mission, the player is instructed to go to the silo, where they are tasked to find and delete all traces of Cliffford from the original servers. ULP also informs of a &lt;a href=\"Conada\"&gt;Conada&lt;/a&gt; helicopter available for easy transportation, which will be near IAA agents with an &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Cruiser\"&gt;Unmarked Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Alta%20Construction%20Site\"&gt;Alta Construction Site&lt;/a&gt;. On the way to the silo, ULP tells that since Avon's death, the site was locked and shut down, so they need to restore the power once inside. When approaching the silo, the player is then instructed to go to the blast doors at the top of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt; and enter through the emergency personnel hatch.\nWhen inside, the player starts in the missile silo and the place is totally dark, so they need a &lt;a href=\"Flashlight\"&gt;Flashlight&lt;/a&gt;. The player is instructed to go to the control room and find the manual override to restore the power. The player eventually notices a &lt;a href=\"Cliffford%20Mercenaries\"&gt;Juggernaut&lt;/a&gt;, which is shut down and emitting a breathing noise.\nOnce they found it, the player interacts with the power breaker and move the lever three times, but the power is still off. ULP informs that the fuses would have been blown off during the decommissioning process and that there should be spares around. The player may notice more Juggernauts on the following rooms, with ULP stating they were too costly to remove them and were left there, but they were shut down since Cliffford's \"death\". After collecting all four fuses, they have to return to the control room, replace the fuses and restore the power.\nWith the power back, the player is instructed to go to the server room and find the servers, so they can overwrite the residual data with the &lt;a href=\"SecuroServ\"&gt;SecuroServ&lt;/a&gt; app provided by ULP and create a final extractable copy of Cliffford data into the app of the player's &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;phone&lt;/a&gt;. ULP also informs that the original firewalls were already breached, so the overwriting should be trivial. After hacking the first server, ULP will notice \"crazy\" readings in their remote monitoring systems.\nThis gets worsened after hacking the second server, which triggers a failsafe mechanism and a loud alarm is heard. ULP warns that the server overwrite triggered a \"search and destroy\" behaviour on the Juggernauts, causing them to activate/re-animate and attack the player with their &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt;s. The player must continue overwriting the other two servers while dealing with the hostile juggernauts, so they can delete all remainings of Cliffford in the servers and leave the site immediately. ULP will also comment that the player's phone, which carries the backup Cliffford data, has become \"the single most dangerous and valuable hard drive on the planet\". The player is then instructed to exit the facility via the elevator in the silo, while dealing with the Juggernauts from earlier.\nOnce outside, the player may see an enemy &lt;a href=\"Annihilator%20Stealth\"&gt;Annihilator Stealth&lt;/a&gt; ready to attack them, and that the Conada helicopter is damaged, so they must take out the helicopter and escape from Mount Chiliad. A parachute is nearby so the player can parachute down the mountain. While escaping, ULP informs that some of the Cliffford mercenaries were operating independently since the Doomsday incident, and that they will attempt to take out the player to get the device with the Cliffford data. The player is instructed to go to the IAA &lt;a href=\"Satellite%20Relay%20Station\"&gt;Satellite Relay Station&lt;/a&gt;, while dealing with Cliffford reinforcements in &lt;a href=\"Dubsta%206x6\"&gt;Dubsta 6x6&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;s. Eventually, the mercenaries will retreat and the player reaches the entrance of the facility, where an IAA agent with a &lt;a href=\"Greenwood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Greenwood&lt;/a&gt; will be waiting. Once getting to the location, the mission is completed."}

It is part of the &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Paper%20Trail\"&gt;Operation Paper Trail&lt;/a&gt; mission strand.\nDescription.\nBefore the mission starts, ULP will call the player to reveal him the findings made from the hardware stolen during Intelligence; it confirms ULP's suspicion that the &lt;a href=\"Duggan%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Duggans&lt;/a&gt; are indeed conspiring to fix the gas prices, and that they intend doing so by buying technology from the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB's&lt;/a&gt; collection of seized assets.\nHowever, the nature of the technology the Duggans are attempting to buy remains to be uncovered as the Agency is still analyzing the contents of the hardware. In the meantime, the player's intrusion into the FIB's heaquarters during the last mission have attracted undue attention to the Agency. To keep the Bureau at bay, ULP orders the player to conduct a counterintelligence operation against them.\nAt the start of the mission, the player is tasked with hacking surveillance &lt;a href=\"drones\"&gt;drones&lt;/a&gt; deployed by the FIB in response to their recent security breach, in hopes of finding a base of operation where the player could potentially retrieve more intelligence on the Duggan conspiracy. The two drones are flying around &lt;a href=\"La%20Mesa\"&gt;La Mesa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"El%20Burro%20Heights\"&gt;El Burro Heights&lt;/a&gt;, the player must get close and hack them using the &lt;a href=\"SecuroServ\"&gt;SecuroServ&lt;/a&gt; app.\nOnce both drones have been hacked, ULP manages to pin down the base of operation at either the &lt;a href=\"Bilingsgate%20Motel\"&gt;Bilingsgate Motel&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Pink%20Cage%20Motel\"&gt;Pink Cage Motel&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Perrera%20Beach%20Motel\"&gt;Perrera Beach Motel&lt;/a&gt;. The player must go to the motel and break into the room. However, nobody is found inside, ULP therefore asks the player to give him access to the computer controlling the drones in hopes of finding intel. As ULP goes over the data, he realizes that it is a sting set up by the FIB. Before the player can escape the room, it is flooded by an anesthesic gas which knocks them out.\nThe player wakes up in the back of a &lt;a href=\"Youga%20Classic%204x4\"&gt;Youga Classic 4x4&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of a vacant lot in &lt;a href=\"Cypress%20Flats\"&gt;Cypress Flats&lt;/a&gt;, surrounded by &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; and FIB officers. ULP regains contact with the player and informs them that the FIB has set up a bomb inside the van in attempt to false flag it as a failed IAA operation. He then tasks the player with defusing the bomb, as the van can be used as a lever against the FIB in case their operation goes south.\nThe player is then given six minutes and two lives to defuse the bomb, by triggering a minigame of conducting a beam with various mirror nodes to break various packets and avoid the firewalls (in a similar manner to the terminals in &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Scenario\"&gt;The Doomsday Scenario&lt;/a&gt;). They must complete two stages.\nOnce the player disarms the bomb, they have to evade the law enforcement and bring the van to a IAA safehouse outside &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;. A health bar is displayed on the lower right corner, which they must ensure it is not depleted, while the wanted level will be permanent within the city. After losing the cops and bringing the van to the drop-off, the mission is completed."}

However, he informs of another issue; one of their undercover agents infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"Duggan%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Duggan organization&lt;/a&gt; as soon as the issue of the rising gas prices started, and that she stopped checking in 24 hours ago. He states that such situation cannot be ignored, and since the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; is a senior field operative, it is their responsibility to bring the agent back.\nAt the start of the mission, the player is tasked to go to a garage in &lt;a href=\"Hawick\"&gt;Hawick&lt;/a&gt;, where they must enter and search clues of her whereabouts. There is a &lt;a href=\"Primo%20Custom\"&gt;Primo Custom&lt;/a&gt; that the player can enter so they can check the recent GPS locations.\nAfter leaving the garage, there will be three possible locations marked in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;, which the player must search. The player may eventually find an ongoing shootout between the Duggans and cartel soldiers (possibly the &lt;a href=\"Marabunta%20Grande\"&gt;Marabunta Grande&lt;/a&gt;), with &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County%20Sheriff\"&gt;Los Santos County Sheriff&lt;/a&gt; also present in the area. The player must deal with the enemies while searching for the agent, which will be taking cover from the oncoming gunfire.\nOnce the agent has been found, the player must secure her while evading the &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. On the way, she informs that the Duggans are putting a next-gen computer sofware to manipulate and fix the gas prices, as well as exploitings backdoors to many entities, including the &lt;a href=\"BAWSAQ\"&gt;BAWSAQ&lt;/a&gt; data center. She also warns that the Duggans have most of the tech and they might acquire more from the FIB's confiscated items.\nAfter losing the cops, Agent Johnson says she is feeling a little faint and that she needs to go to a hospital. The player is then instructed to go to the nearest hospital on the city. After bringing her to the hospital, the mission is completed."}

When the remains silent, the ULP contact interprets it as an enthusiastic consent and congratulates them.\nThe crew is instructed to go to &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20Avenue\"&gt;San Andreas Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, where ULP informs them that the gas prices have raised significantly and that he suspects it is part of an \"old-fashioned conspiracy\", with the leading suspect being the &lt;a href=\"Duggan%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Duggan Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;. He informs them that the location where they are heading is the residence of &lt;a href=\"Mason%20Duggan\"&gt;Mason Duggan&lt;/a&gt;, the younger brother of &lt;a href=\"Thornton%20Duggan\"&gt;Thornton&lt;/a&gt;. The crew is then instructed to enter the apartment.\nOnce inside, the crew is tasked with finding Mason's laptop and hacking it with hacking software given by ULP. The player must complete the &lt;a href=\"hacking\"&gt;hacking&lt;/a&gt; by opening &lt;a href=\"BruteForce\"&gt;BruteForce.exe&lt;/a&gt; and selecting the eight highlighted letters. Once it is done, the laptop briefly displays a map with two red markers, where the targets would be. The players are then instructed to leave the apartment.\nOnce outside, ULP reveals that the Duggans have been given two collection points by the Bureau: the &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Headquarters\"&gt;headquarters&lt;/a&gt; and a seized contraband depot in &lt;a href=\"Cypress%20Flats\"&gt;Cypress Flats&lt;/a&gt;. The crew can choose which target location to retrieve first:\nFIB HQ.\nThe crew is given the option to find a maintenance outfit marked at the &lt;a href=\"Alta%20Construction%20Site\"&gt;Alta Construction Site&lt;/a&gt;, loaded on two &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt; vans with the rear doors open, so they can get through the HQ without alerting anyone inside. The crew is then tasked with entering the HQ with their weapons concealed and using the elevator to get to the target floor.\nOnce on the upper floor, ULP warns that if they are spotted outside of the construction area, the FIB will become suspicious and will attack them immediately. The crew is tasked with finding a tablet and some kind of a miniature data storage device, located in one of the main rooms and heavily guarded by FIB personnel. From there, the player can take them down with suppressed weapons or silent melee takedowns, provided they are not within the vision of another enemy. If a player is spotted, there is still a small chance to take them out before alerting anyone.\nOnce the two hardware devices are collected, the crew is instructed to leave the HQ. If they remain undetected, they can simply move towards the entrance with no issues.\nFIB Depot.\nThe crew is informed by ULP that they must deal with the security system of the depot, by finding and destroying two fuse boxes located on the exterior of the depot. The fuse boxes won't be marked on the radar, but a red arrow icon can be still seen above the boxes. Once they are destroyed, they can enter the FIB depot without triggering the alarm.\nOnce inside, the depot (with the same appearance as a lower garage floor of the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Workshop\"&gt;Arena Workshop&lt;/a&gt;) is totally dark and the crew must use a &lt;a href=\"Flashlight\"&gt;Flashlight&lt;/a&gt; to search for the hardware devices scattered through: an external hard drive and some sort of VR headset. Once collected, they are instructed to leave the depot.\nEnd.\nAfter collecting all the required hardware from both sites, the crew is instructed to deliver them to the drop-off located behind one of the warehouses in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSIA&lt;/a&gt;, where two IAA agents with an &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Cruiser\"&gt;Unmarked Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; will be waiting.

It is the penultimate mission of the &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Paper%20Trail\"&gt;Operation Paper Trail&lt;/a&gt; mission strand.\nDescription.\nBefore the mission starts, ULP will call the player that their teams have gone through the hardware the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; has recovered from the &lt;a href=\"Duggan%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Duggans&lt;/a&gt; and that he confirms his worst-case scenario. He informs that part of &lt;a href=\"Cliffford\"&gt;Cliffford&lt;/a&gt;, the AI of &lt;a href=\"Avon%20Hertz\"&gt;Avon Hertz&lt;/a&gt;, is still in archived backup drives from the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt;, to which the Duggans have been buying to control the price of gas. ULP also tells that the Duggans are making a last move and that they must intercept a deal.\nAt the start of the mission, the player is instructed to go to the &lt;a href=\"Mile%20High%20Club\"&gt;Mile High Club&lt;/a&gt;, where ULP will provide access to the cameras on the &lt;a href=\"drones\"&gt;drones&lt;/a&gt; to look around. There will be a drone on ground level, on one of the accessible floors of the building and on the top of the building, where they spot &lt;a href=\"Mason%20Duggan\"&gt;Mason Duggan&lt;/a&gt; in a deal with the FIB, with a briefcase containing the Cliffford drives and an &lt;a href=\"Annihilator%20Stealth\"&gt;Annihilator Stealth&lt;/a&gt; nearby.\nAfter looking around, the player is instructed to find an elevator keycard, which is in possession of a Duggan security guard. They must deal with several Duggan and FIB guards while avoiding detection, including weaponized drones. Once the keypad has been collected, they have to use it on the orange elevator nearby to reach to one of the floors, which is as far as it can go. The player then clears out their way to the next elevator, by taking out more guards and drones. After reaching the top of the building, the player is immediately spotted, and they must deal with the guards and an drone shooting at them in order to get the briefcase.\nOn the way to the upper floor, Mason is already in the helicopter and attempt to fly away, which the player has to damage to force him to land. Eventually, the helicopter lands at the &lt;a href=\"Maibatsu%20Factory\"&gt;Maibatsu Factory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"La%20Mesa\"&gt;La Mesa&lt;/a&gt; and they must reach there, while dealing with Duggan reinforcements on the site and pursuers in &lt;a href=\"Kamacho\"&gt;Kamacho&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Caracara%204x4\"&gt;Caracara 4x4&lt;/a&gt; pickup trucks on the way.\nAfter taking out Mason, they have to collect the briefcase and bring it to the drop-off at the western end of &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Island\"&gt;Elysian Island&lt;/a&gt;, while avoiding the Duggan reinforcements. At the drop-off, there will be two IAA agents with an &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Cruiser\"&gt;Unmarked Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; nearby. After bringing the briefcase, the mission is completed."}

It is primarily based on the , with the cockpit and wheel fairings removed and added a more responsive wing.\nThe vehicle features a tricycle undercarriage and a large glider wing on top that is controlled by the lower handlebar, having various articulation joints for the basic aircraft maneuvering. The Ultralight features a small console with the \"Flyer\" dials on the front, a single seat in the middle and the engine behind the main support of the wing. Several parts that provide the basic functioning of the engine, such as the radiator, the alternator and the fuel tank, can be seen around the engine and the rear section of the vehicle's frames. As with various vehicles featured after the update, the engine has fully-animated pulleys and timing belt.\nIts primary color is applied on the main body, front suspension, front portion and rear frames of the wing, upper side of the intake manifold and the rotor' spinner, while its secondary color is applied on the frames that hold the front wheel, seat, handlebar, rear section of the wing, fuel tank, rear suspension springs, air filter, engine cover and a set of tubes connected to the alternator. Although not accessible, there is a tertiary/trim color that is applied to the \"7.62mm Gimbal Turret\" option, which is always set to black. It uses plain industrial wheels similar to the ones used in aircraft like the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs stated before, the vehicle can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with a 7.62mm Gimbal Turret, which is about the size of the mounted cameras seen on the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;Frogger&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Attack variant&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Ultralight performs differently from other general aircraft, as it has a lower ceiling (maximum altitude) than other aircraft, at 4,800 feet. It also has limited maneuverability; having no rudder, it has very limited yawing capabilities and requires banked turns, and it cannot perform knife flights nor fly upside down for too long, as the aircraft will \"correct\" by itself, not to mention it may lose airspeed quickly when attempting to go vertically. Landing the Ultralight is tricky because its vast wing and weight make it very easy to lift when making contact on the ground. Touching down at or slightly below level to the ground is recommended (although it is better using the altitude indicator in the first-person cockpit). After update, the glider wing is non-solid and can clip through walls and objects.\nStill, its nippy handling on the ground, short take-off and landing distance make it versatile to use in almost any terrain and is great for cruising around the map. As a glider, the Ultralight can glide indefinitely with the engine off and the pilot's proper maneuvering. Careful to not run directly to the aircraft, as it can be easily pushed and the character may get knocked out. In addition, sharp turns may flip the aircraft easily when taxiing around.\nThe Ultralight is powered by a small Inline-4 engine, which produces a rather noisy sound, likely due to it being exposed.\nDefense.\nThe Ultralight is generally decent at evading targets, but is also fragile against collisions and gunfire, as it can easily emit smoke after a few impacts or firearm rounds. The pilot is also vulnerable and can be killed in the process.\nThe most redeeming feature of the Ultralight is that if the Muffled Carbon Propeller is added, the aircraft can allow the player to go off the radar while gliding, cruising or under gentle acceleration, making it useful to avoid detection by hostile players.\nCountermeasures.\nThe vehicle can be fitted with countermeasures to improve its defensive capabilities against homing missiles, each one with their own attributes:\nWeaponry.\nMachine Gun: The Ultralight can be upgraded with a 7.62mm Gimbal Turret mounted at the end of the front frame. While it has a base damage of 30 like most front-facing machine guns on land vehicles, it is capable of destroying vehicles upon being damaged enough, in a similar way to mounted Miniguns, as well as having a high fire rate of 1,200 rounds per minute and good range of 300 meters/984 feet. It also has near-complete coverage at about 300 degrees of rotation and 40 degrees of elevation up and down, ideal against most targets while flying above them. The player can optionally choose the weapon camera, although they will have difficulty orienting the aircraft itself if the gun is selected.

During a gang war an Underboss is mostly targeted by other rival gangs and so is the Don and his &lt;a href=\"Consigliere\"&gt;Consigliere&lt;/a&gt;. The reason they are mostly targeted is because they are the leading members of a gang and to prevent the gang of getting a new leader due to the Underboss being next in line to being the Leader."}

The headlights and tail lights are found from those of a .\nThe Rocoto is depicted with a rather large body with ample room for the occupants. At the base of the front, the vehicle features a black section with a rectangular mesh intake on the centre, which spans about one-third of the car's width. Slightly above this black section, the front is made up of a trapezium-shaped main grille with four plastic horizontal elements over the mesh pattern, as well as rhomboid-shaped outer intakes with two plastic horizontal elements and a coloured middle separation that houses modern strips. On the upper area, the centre is occupied by a smaller rectangular grille with a mesh pattern and plastic trim around it, while the outer portions are occupied by inset housings with silver trim around, where each housing has dual circular headlamps and triangle-shaped amber signals, as well as silver details around each unit. The bonnet is made up of curved lines starting from the inner sides of the headlamp housings and reaching towards the base of the windscreen, together with inner lines parallel to the main ones.\nOn the sides, the vehicle has slightly wider formations around the wheel arches and lower sides, along with black details around the same arches and skirting area. On the cabin area, the SUV makes use of silver trim around the windows and black inner pillars, while the front doors mount rounded mirror shells near the A-pillars, with the lower halves finished in carbon fibre and supported by black frames.\nThe rear of the car is predominated by the rear compartment door, which features a roof spoiler with two rectangular brake lamps over the rear window, while the lower half features a silver strip between the inner brake lamps on the middle, the Obey logo below the silver strip, the license plate on the centre of the lower area and two rectangular brake lamps beside the plate. The edges of the car bear additional lamps on the middle section, consisting of the outer turn signals and the inner main/reverse lamps. The lower area of the car consist of a vented section with dual-exit, dual exhaust tubes housed on the edges and a black bottom section. The interior is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt;, using the same dial set in the enhanced version.\nThe car only has access to a single colour, which is applied on the bodywork and the upper halves of the mirror shells. It uses a set of rims similar to the \"LozSpeed Ten\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in medium-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Rocoto is a good alternative to the more popular SUVs in the game, the &lt;a href=\"Dubsta\"&gt;Dubsta&lt;/a&gt; and the second generation &lt;a href=\"Baller\"&gt;Baller&lt;/a&gt;. It has a great balance between off-road and on-road performance, with a stiffer ride and high-speed transmission that makes the vehicle more responsive and able to reach a high top speed, while the AWD layout maximizes the potential for the vehicles terrain visits. On the other hand, acceleration is somewhat average and its braking is among the worst in its class, and the ability to resist damage is poor, as after a few hard-on collisions, it is somewhat common for one of the front wheels to camber and jam into the fenders.\nThe Rocoto has a V8 engine with a 5-speed gearbox, powering all four wheels (with 40% of the engine power delivered to the front wheels and the rest of it to the rear). The engine sound is seemingly low powered, but somewhat high-revving with relatively smooth timing, which is also shared with the &lt;a href=\"Prairie\"&gt;Prairie&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpecial Variants.\nSaeeda Kadam.\nA dark red Rocoto can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Random%20Events%20in%20GTA%20V%23Car%20Theft\"&gt;Random Event - Car Theft 2&lt;/a&gt;, where it is stolen and the player has the option to retrieve it to its &lt;a href=\"Saeeda%20Kadam\"&gt;owner&lt;/a&gt;.

After his re-election, in &lt;a href=\"1997\"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;, he was accused of securing drugs for city officials in return for sanitation contracts. The \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" website also suggests that Hole has had sex with at least two underage females. A court case was brought against Hole, who denied knowing that the females were underage and that their driving licenses were fakes. Hole was cleared of any wrongdoing.\nBy 1998, he has long given up on the democratic process of being mayor. His main political movements before 1998 include raising taxation, reducing public spenditure, increasing bureaucratic costs and keeping Liberty City in the national news. Hole is controlled by the Forelli Family &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Leaders\"&gt;Don&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Franco%20Forelli\"&gt;Franco Forelli&lt;/a&gt;. Hole also works with some construction companies, as confirmed by &lt;a href=\"Avery%20Carrington\"&gt;Avery Carrington&lt;/a&gt; on the official \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" website.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nIn 1998, Hole, under orders from the Forelli Family, attempts to arrest &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; Don &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore Leone&lt;/a&gt;, who manages to &lt;a href=\"Driving%20Mr%20Leone\"&gt;escape&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt;.

The main section features a long cockpit with dual sliding canopies for the occupants, while the wings have black surfaces on the front, outer ailerons and inner air brakes on the rear, hatches for the main la ding gear and four weapon hard-points on its wings (two per side). The tail boom is relatively long and bears the star emblem that denotes its affiliation with the &lt;a href=\"Military\"&gt;Military&lt;/a&gt;, while the empennage has black surfaces on the horizontal stabilizers. The interior of the aircraft uses the same \"Lazer\" textures and dial set from fighter jets such as the &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;, albeit duplicated for both seats. The pilot sits on the front seat, while the co-pilot sits on the rear one.\nThe vehicle is painted with a primary color for the body, as well as a secondary color for the lower portion of the front intake, the bolted-on trims of the canopies, and the tips on the wings, vertical stabilizer, and lower fins. It uses a set of industrial wheels derived from trucks such as the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe aircraft can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with either a set of 7.62mm machine guns resembling AN/M-B machine gun pods, or a set of explosive cannons apparently resembling 12.7mm gun pods, as well as rocket launchers resembling SBAT 70mm rocket launchers, and bombs.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Rogue is a relatively simple aircraft to fly, as it has a high top speed of 353 kph/191 knots while flying above 250 meters/820 feet, and average acceleration. It is the fastest propeller plane, as well as the third fastest vehicle in the game (outpaced by the &lt;a href=\"Pyro\"&gt;Pyro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"F-160%20Raiju\"&gt;F-160 Raiju&lt;/a&gt;). The Rogue's handling is responsive but with extremely powerful rudders (30 degrees per second), making yaw inputs extremely sensitive. The aircraft has a much longer take-off roll compared to other fighter aircraft, making take-offs with limited space a challenge. While flying, it is very important to pull up the landing gear since it causes it to lose a significant amount of maneuverability, airspeed and will be pulled downwards towards the ground. The undercarriage setup provides good stability, and the plane does not tip over as easily as aircraft such as the &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Besra\"&gt;Besra&lt;/a&gt;, but care should be taken on the front, as the large propeller blades may scratch with any obstacle and end up braking, rendering the aircraft inoperative.\nThe aircraft is powered by a single engine, as indicated in the website and the in-game model. Its engine sound is somewhat mid-revving and noisy, being more or less similar to piston-powered aircraft like the &lt;a href=\"Alpha-Z1\"&gt;Alpha-Z1&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Seabreeze\"&gt;Seabreeze&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefense.\nThe Rogue, with upgraded armor, is almost twice as resistant to bullet damage as airplanes without armor upgrades. It takes about eighteen &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper\"&gt;Heavy Sniper&lt;/a&gt; rounds to completely destroy the aircraft. The Rogue can also withstand two direct hits from the &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Launcher\"&gt;Homing Launcher&lt;/a&gt; or Explosive rounds from the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper Mk II&lt;/a&gt;, blowing up on the third hit. However, any explosive damage to the control surfaces of the aircraft will knock them off, potentially leaving the aircraft unable to maneuver.\nCountermeasures.\nThe vehicle can be fitted with countermeasures to improve its defensive capabilities against homing missiles, each one with their own attributes:\nWeaponry.\nThe Rogue has access to an array of weapons mainly operated by the pilot:\nIf a player sits in the co-pilot seat, the owner of the vehicle can toggle control of the bomb bay, but the co-pilot needs good coordination with the pilot to make this tactic as effective as possible.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMachine Gun=\nExplosive MG=\nMissiles=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

She later realizes that the driver is Toni, who then drives erratically over Portland until she agrees to do as Salvatore tells her. The player is essentially required to drive at high speeds, collide with anything, execute stunt jumps, or perform a combination of the two or three until Hopper's \"Scare\" meter is full, which indicates Hopper will be fully cooperative with Salvatore. The mission is complete once the player finally drops Hopper off at the ferry terminal.\nReward.\nThe reward for completing the mission is &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;1,000. The &lt;a href=\"Chauffeur%27s%20Clothes\"&gt;Chauffeur's Clothes&lt;/a&gt; Outfit is also unlocked after the mission."}

It is equipped with red taxi affixed to the grille and trunk, and taxi stickers applied to the rear bumper, rear window, and trunk, the latter of which replaces the Esperanto badge on the standard model. Roman's Taxi also features a unique red interior, with more plush front seats, a unique horn, and only one exhaust pipe on the right side, as opposed to two on the regular Esperanto.\nBy default, Roman's Taxi is black with a discolored dark gray driver's side front fender. It can be resprayed to other colors and may be randomly resprayed back to its default appearance, although the driver's side fender will remain a light pink color. \nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nPerformance and handling-wise, the taxi is heavier than the Esperanto (1700 kg to the Esperanto's 1600 kg), and has inferior acceleration, but has a significantly greater top speed. It also has slightly stronger braking and softer suspension. The handling feels good and can go around a corner at low speeds without much trouble. It is slightly less prone to deformation than the Esperanto, and can better withstand collisions.\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nRoman's Taxi is the first vehicle that the player drives in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", and was prominently featured in pre-release materials, with the car initially painted with an all-black body color.

After the war, she used all of the money she had saved to send Roman to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt;. She also wanted to send Niko to the United States, but he stayed behind to fight in the Yugoslav War. After arriving in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, Roman eventually saved up enough &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt;, and bought &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Taxi\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Esperanto%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;taxis&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Express%20Car%20Service\"&gt;cab depot&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually an &lt;a href=\"Broker%20Safehouse\"&gt;apartment&lt;/a&gt;. It is implied that upon arriving in Liberty City, he began to put on weight, as &lt;a href=\"Bernie%20Crane\"&gt;Bernie Crane&lt;/a&gt; describes Roman as \"putting on a few vanity pounds\", proving that Roman must have gained weight after leaving Yugoslavia. When Niko complained about Roman's \"shitty\" apartment, Roman told him he slept under at his desk at his taxi depot for over a year before he was finally able to get the apartment.\nIn a conversation with &lt;a href=\"Kate%20McReary\"&gt;Kate McReary&lt;/a&gt;, Niko says that he found Roman's mother raped and murdered, although Niko told Roman that she died in a house fire. In conversations between Niko and Roman and other characters, it is revealed that both Niko and Roman's fathers were alcoholic, wife-beating bullies.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nNiko's arrival.\nWhen Niko &lt;a href=\"The%20Cousins%20Bellic\"&gt;arrives&lt;/a&gt; in Liberty City, he soon &lt;a href=\"It%27s%20Your%20Call\"&gt;finds out&lt;/a&gt; that Roman is heavily in debt with various powerful underworld figures in the city, including the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia\"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Mob\"&gt;Albanian&lt;/a&gt; Mafias, mostly due to his gambling addiction. Roman employs his girlfriend Mallorie at his taxi depot; although he is unaware that she is having an affair with Vlad Glebov. Niko &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20Out\"&gt;kills&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dardan%20Petrela\"&gt;Dardan Petrela&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kalem\"&gt;Kalem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bledar%20Morina\"&gt;Bledar Morina&lt;/a&gt;, three Albanians, when they attempt to collect their money.\nInvolvement with the Russians.\nWhen Roman finds out about Mallorie's affair with Vlad, he is upset, and Niko confronts and &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Vlad\"&gt;kills&lt;/a&gt; Vlad for him. Vlad's death causes Roman to become paranoid because he fears retaliation from Vlad's boss, &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Faustin\"&gt;Mikhail Faustin&lt;/a&gt;. His worst fears proved to be correct. He and Niko are later &lt;a href=\"Crime%20and%20Punishment\"&gt;kidnapped&lt;/a&gt; on orders from &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Faustin\"&gt;Faustin&lt;/a&gt;. Faustin shoots Roman in the stomach (because his screaming would alert &lt;a href=\"Ilyena%20Faustin\"&gt;Ilyena&lt;/a&gt;, his wife, upstairs, who was watching television at the time), but he survives. This leads to Niko doing a couple of jobs for Faustin such as &lt;a href=\"No%20Love%20Lost\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; a patched member of &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Michaels\"&gt;Jason Michaels&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater events.\nAfter Niko &lt;a href=\"The%20Master%20and%20the%20Molotov\"&gt;kills&lt;/a&gt; Faustin for &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt;, Rascalov and &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Revolution\"&gt;betray&lt;/a&gt; Niko, &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Sorrow\"&gt;burning down&lt;/a&gt; his apartment in Hove Beach and Roman's taxi depot. The cousins move into Mallorie's cousin's apartment in &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;, where he also opens another taxi depot with the insurance money he received from the fire.\nRoman later has a \"cold streak\" in his poker games, leading the Russians to hire &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt; with the help of &lt;a href=\"Malc\"&gt;Malc&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Holiday\"&gt;kidnap him&lt;/a&gt;, taking him to a warehouse in the &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Industrial&lt;/a&gt; area of &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;. The Russians hope that they can kill Niko when he tries to rescue Roman. But, Niko would later &lt;a href=\"Hostile%20Negotiation\"&gt;rescue him&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Niko rescues Roman, he continues gambling. He goes on a hot streak, wins a lot of money, upgrades his taxis from &lt;a href=\"Esperanto%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Esperanto&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt;s and buys a luxury penthouse in &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;, telling Niko they are finally going to live the dream.\nEnding.\nTowards the end of the storyline in \"GTA IV\", Niko has to decide if he will &lt;a href=\"A%20Dish%20Served%20Cold\"&gt;kill Dimitri&lt;/a&gt; in revenge for his betrayal or &lt;a href=\"If%20the%20Price%20is%20Right\"&gt;work with him again&lt;/a&gt; in a heroin deal for &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Pegorino\"&gt;Jimmy Pegorino&lt;/a&gt;. Roman &lt;a href=\"One%20Last%20Thing\"&gt;urges Niko to forget revenge and work with Dimitri&lt;/a&gt;, considering the large amount of money he could receive for his work. He tells Niko he would be able to afford a great honeymoon with Mallorie and that maybe he and Niko could take a private jet to &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nRevenge=\nIf Niko decides to get &lt;a href=\"A%20Dish%20Served%20Cold\"&gt;revenge on Dimitri&lt;/a&gt;, Jimmy Pegorino will be furious about his business being ruined. During Roman's and Mallorie's wedding, Pegorino attempts to kill Niko in a drive-by shooting, but kills &lt;a href=\"Kate%20McReary\"&gt;Kate McReary&lt;/a&gt;, Niko's love interest, by accident.\nAfter Niko kills Pegorino, Roman tells him that Mallorie is pregnant, and that if it's a girl, her name will be Kate. Niko is still in mourning over Kate's death, but is relieved that now he, Roman and their allies will be able to live calmly without fear of mob retaliations.\nDeal=\nIf Niko decides to strike a &lt;a href=\"If%20the%20Price%20is%20Right\"&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt;, Dimitri betrays Niko again during the mission and was forced to steal the money afterwards, he sends an &lt;a href=\"Wedding%20Assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt; to kill Niko at &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20%26amp%3B%20Mrs.%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman's and Mallorie's wedding&lt;/a&gt;. Niko fights and kills the assassin, but in the struggle, Roman is accidentally &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;shot&lt;/a&gt; in the chest and killed.\nAfter Niko kills Dimitri with the help of Little Jacob, Mallorie will reveal that she is pregnant with Roman's &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Child\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt;. She struggles that her son will grow up without a father, but Niko explains that her son will never have to worry about anything.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nFurther Notes.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", after the player chooses either &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;Ending C&lt;/a&gt; (canon finale) or &lt;a href=\"Something%20Sensible\"&gt;Ending A&lt;/a&gt;, one potential scenario in &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Michael%27s%20mansion\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; sees his family gathered around the dining room table. &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Jimmy&lt;/a&gt;, Michael's son, is writing his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 on a laptop. However, the screen displays a &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader\"&gt;Lifeinvader&lt;/a&gt; profile page as an Easter egg. \nBy using a camera to zoom in, the page is revealed to be that of Niko Bellic, complete with an image of the character. He now lives in Broker, still working as a taxi driver for Bellic Cab Service, and is still in contact with Mallorie Bardas, &lt;a href=\"Little%20Jacob\"&gt;Little Jacob&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt;, who all liked his latest status. There is also a Happy Birthday note for Roman which was dated as being posted 40 minutes prior. As Rockstar Games have officially stated that there are no \"true paths\" for the \"Grand Theft Auto IV\"s storyline, and it's all determinant to the player, and this official stance was issued after the release of \"GTA V\", Niko Bellic's &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader/Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;LifeInvader profile&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA V\" (including Roman as a friend) is considered an &lt;a href=\"Secrets%20and%20Easter%20Eggs\"&gt;Easter Egg&lt;/a&gt;. \nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nRoman mainly appears to be concerned more about making &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt;, possibly being more desperate to prosper than any of the other characters, which has led him to build a bad reputation in the city for his gambling addiction, of which he is constantly reminded by Niko. Despite his love of money and his problems, he cares a lot about his friends and family, and is sometimes annoyed at Niko's affiliation with organized crime. Out of all the characters, Roman appears to be the least interested in organized crime, as he only wishes to earn money and live the \"American Dream.\"\nRoman understands that Niko is unable to find regular work, and does not trouble him about his life as a criminal, but instead tells him to be careful, as some of the crimes Niko commits (&lt;a href=\"Missions%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;racketeering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Three%20Leaf%20Clover\"&gt;armed robbery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Exotic%20Exports\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stevie%27s%20Car%20Thefts\"&gt;thefts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Fixer%27s%20Assassinations\"&gt;assassinations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drug%20Delivery\"&gt;delivering drugs&lt;/a&gt;, etc.), could get Niko an extremely long jail sentence.\nOutfits.\nRoman has three outfits:\nFavorite Friend Activity Hangouts.\nThese are Roman's favorite places during a friend activity with him:\nAfter completion of &lt;a href=\"Bull%20in%20a%20China%20Shop\"&gt;Bull in a China Shop&lt;/a&gt;, getting his likeness percentage high will unlock his special ability to service taxi rides for Niko for free, also unlocking the achievement, Driving Mr. Bellic.\nMission Appearances.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\n&lt;a href=\"Deal\"&gt;Deal&lt;/a&gt; Ending\n&lt;a href=\"Revenge\"&gt;Revenge&lt;/a&gt; Ending\nPost-mission phone calls.\nAfter completing certain \"GTA IV\" missions, Niko can call Roman; this keeps Niko in touch with his cousin, while also showing Niko's opinion regarding the various situations he gets in, revealing more detail about his character."}

{"id": "2328", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2328", "title": "Romero's Hearse", "text": "The Romero Hearse is a vehicle which first appeared in ' as the Romero's Hearse. The name was shortened to Romero in ' and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", and in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", it was renamed the Romero Hearse. It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Albany\"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA IV\" and &lt;a href=\"Chariot\"&gt;Chariot&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA V.\"\nInfluence.\n3D Universe.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, Romero's Hearse takes an overall influence from 1980s models of the . The model in takes influence in its rear end from , while the front and rear ends of the model more closely resemble the LeSabre Superior Hearse.\nHD Universe.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;, the Romero Hearse takes on a modern hearse design using the body of the &lt;a href=\"Washington\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, taking influence from hearse models of the .\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nThe design of Romero's Hearse in \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" is as expected for a vehicle tailored to transport the deceased, appearing as a black station wagon-like car with a rear compartment designed to carry a coffin. The car does not seem to be based on any particular model, loosely sharing cues from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Regina\"&gt;Regina&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Greenwood%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Greenwood&lt;/a&gt;. The vehicle features a set of rear doors intended for the loading of the coffin on the back, as well as an extended roof and side decorations on the separations of the door windows and on the rear sections. The rear end has vertical tail lights in a similar way to the &lt;a href=\"Perennial\"&gt;Perennial&lt;/a&gt;. The car may have a coffin at the back (appearing with one of two or three different designs), and may spawn in black or in four shades of grey.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", the design of the Romero leans more towards the &lt;a href=\"Regina\"&gt;Regina&lt;/a&gt;, but still has unique features to distinct it from other standard cars. The rear section is largely similar to the \"GTA Vice City\" rendition in terms of layout and features, but the rear wheels are partially covered by the bodywork and has smaller tail lights. Despite having rear door handles, the car lacks any sort ofopenable rear doors, as there are no gaps. It sports a wider range of colors for the body as primary and roof as secondary (although generally maintain dark tones).\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe HD universe rendition of the Romero is built on the &lt;a href=\"Washington\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; chassis, and as such, bears the &lt;a href=\"Albany\"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt; brand. The front is evidently the same as the Washington's, sharing the same grille placements, headlights and the Albany ornament on the hood. The sides retain the chrome details passing through the doors, but the original plastic details from the Washington were replaced by chrome ones on the bottom sides and the greenhouse area, alomg with side lights on the rear quarters. As expected from a hearse, the Romero has an additional set of rear doors with curtain textures inside, an extended roof and the decorations around the back section. The rear end of the car features a single rear door that hinges from the driver side and is fitted with curtain textures inside, as well as a set of red lights on the outer edges and white vertical lights on the bumper, beside the license plate. The vehicle has a unique dark purple interior.\nUnlike former renditions, the vehicle no longer spawns with a coffin on the back (aside from the mission &lt;a href=\"Undertaker\"&gt;Undertaker&lt;/a&gt;, which is an actual prop rather than an extra), and only spawns in black. The Romero shares the same rims of the Washington, but has whitewall tires.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Romero reappears unchanged in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", though the cross decorations were removed. While it seems to retain the rear doors, they are actually part of the bodywork, therefore uninteractive in any way. \nIn the original versions of the game, the Romero retained the dark purple color. In the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V%23Enhanced%20and%20PC%20Versions\"&gt;enhanced version&lt;/a&gt;, however, the interior is black like many other vehicles. The rear of the vehicle remains purple, however.\nThe Romero Hearse uses the &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt; interior, unlike the &lt;a href=\"Washington\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; which uses the generic \"Police/Taxi\" interior.\nUnlike in \"GTA IV\", the Romero will spawn either with an empty back, a coffin or a coffin with wreaths. The vehicle is only available in a single body color, though the color of the stitching matches with the body. It retains the same wheel design as the Washington, although it lack the whitewall details on the tires.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe Romero's Hearse in \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" is a car capable of high speeds, but suffers from poor steering due to its weight and long wheelbase.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", the vehicle is almost an amalgamation of all the least desirable characteristics in a car. Its engine is weak, with poor acceleration, low top speed, and low durability. Its suspension is soft and very low, sometimes leading to the chassis scraping the ground from a fall (This problem can be fixed by modifying it with &lt;a href=\"Hydraulics\"&gt;Hydraulics&lt;/a&gt; at any &lt;a href=\"Transfender\"&gt;Transfender&lt;/a&gt; shop, and locking the hydraulics on 'High' mode). Its brakes are weak, and its wheels do not lock up when braking.\nAll renditions of the hearse are only capable of carrying two occupants, despite featuring two back doors in most cases. The \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" rendition is an exception, being capable of holding four occupants.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Romero retains the adequate handling of the Washington, but has inferior acceleration and top speed due to the added weight of the wagon body. Suspension is average on the front, but rather low on the rear because of the extra weight, which causes certain difficulty on curbs or bumpy terrain when reversing the vehicle.\nLike the Washington, the Romero is powered by a single-cam V8 engine, coupled to a five-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. The engine appears to have four small pipes on the vehicle's passenger side, but only three on the vehicle's driver side (with the fourth one seemingly hidden within the engine bay texture). The engine sound is shared with the Washington and other luxury cars, being low-revving and smooth.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Romero Hearse retains some of its handling elements from its appearance in \"GTA IV\". However, its top speed has been improved. Once close to or at its top speed, the Romero Hearse can gain enough momentum to push through obstacles and roadblocks with relative ease. The vehicle's performance still remains below average, but acceptable for its size and purpose.\nAgain, the car is powered by a single-cam V8 engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout.

He is an associate and neighbour of Trevor Philips, intern at &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Enterprises\"&gt;Trevor Philips Enterprises&lt;/a&gt;, and the host of a podcast during the &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County%20Radio%20Community%20Hour\"&gt;Blaine County Radio Community Hour&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County%20Talk%20Radio\"&gt;Blaine County Talk Radio&lt;/a&gt;. He occasionally acts as the CEO of Trevor's business, managing it while Trevor is not in Sandy Shores.\nRonald Jakowski was possibly born in the Midwestern United States and previously worked as an accountant. He was happily married for 12 years before he met &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;. Trevor convinced him that his wife was only holding him back in life and scared her when he threatened dismemberment. Ron was kicked out by his wife and they divorced, with Ron deep in debt due to paying settlement fees to her. He ended up becoming Trevor's \"best friend\" and moved into a &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Jakowski%27s%20Trailer\"&gt;trailer&lt;/a&gt; next door to him in &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;. He began to obsess over conspiracy theories and work for Trevor's company, &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Enterprises\"&gt;Trevor Philips Enterprises&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, he began hosting &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County%20Radio\"&gt;Blaine County Radio&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County%20Radio%20Community%20Hour\"&gt;Community Hour&lt;/a&gt;. As part of his conspiracy theories, he worked with drone-jamming technology.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" (before \"Grand Theft Auto V\").\nIn &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, the , working for &lt;a href=\"The%20Families\"&gt;Families&lt;/a&gt; member &lt;a href=\"Gerald\"&gt;Gerald&lt;/a&gt; steals an &lt;a href=\"Meth%27d%20Up\"&gt;RV belonging to Trevor Philips Enterprises&lt;/a&gt;. Ron messages the Protagonist, who comes to &lt;a href=\"Trevor%27s%20Trailer\"&gt;Trevor's Trailer&lt;/a&gt; to settle the issue and watches as Trevor instructs the player to do work for him to make-up for taking his RV. Ron then gives the player missions for Trevor and Trevor Philips Enterprises, mostly comprising of taking various things from &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Romance%20Isn%27t%20Dead\"&gt;one of their vans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fuelling%20the%20Flames\"&gt;a tanker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turbine%20Carbine\"&gt;a van full of weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daemon%20Run\"&gt;some bikes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crank%20Up%20the%20Volume\"&gt;an RV meth lab&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wet%20Workers\"&gt;a boat&lt;/a&gt;. He also tasks the player &lt;a href=\"Base%20Invaders\"&gt;with stealing a Cargobob from Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"A%20Boat%20in%20the%20Bay\"&gt;a boat from the federal government&lt;/a&gt; (removed in the Enhanced Edition), and &lt;a href=\"Landing%20Gear\"&gt;a plane from a rival drug dealing crew&lt;/a&gt;. He also occasionally calls the Player to remind them about Crate Drops (removed in the &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events%20Update\"&gt;Freemode Events Update&lt;/a&gt;).\nHe later helps Trevor pitch the &lt;a href=\"Series%20A\"&gt;Series A&lt;/a&gt; heist to the player. He is often the person the Crew meets at the end of each &lt;a href=\"Heist%20Setups\"&gt;setup&lt;/a&gt; mission. He also provides information to the crew through &lt;a href=\"Earpiece\"&gt;Earpiece&lt;/a&gt;s during some of the missions. He is then seen briefly in the Finale, informing the Crew of the Gangs incoming attack on Trevor.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nRon is first seen trying to calm down &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt; while he is angrily heading towards Trevor's trailer. However, the efforts of Ron and &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Hebert\"&gt;Wade Hebert&lt;/a&gt; could not prevent Trevor from murdering Johnny.\nThe three men get into Trevor's &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt; to drive towards &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;'s location in &lt;a href=\"Grapeseed\"&gt;Grapeseed&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, they confront and threaten &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Thorpe\"&gt;Terry Thorpe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Simons\"&gt;Clay Simons&lt;/a&gt;. This causes the two bikers to ride back to &lt;a href=\"Stab%20City\"&gt;Stab City&lt;/a&gt; to warn the other Lost members, but Trevor kills them en route.\nEventually, the trio arrive at &lt;a href=\"The%20Range\"&gt;The Range&lt;/a&gt;, the Lost's headquarters. Ron and Wade wait in Trevor's truck while Trevor kills the bikers. After the bikers are killed, Ron and Trevor drive towards &lt;a href=\"Ortega\"&gt;Ortega&lt;/a&gt;'s trailer. Trevor rams Ortega's trailer into the river, before either killing or sparing Ortega.\nA few days later, some members of The Lost ransack &lt;a href=\"Trevor%27s%20Trailer\"&gt;Trevor's Trailer&lt;/a&gt; in retaliation for Johnny's murder. Following this, Trevor decides to wipe out The Lost's presence in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;. Ron assists him in taking over the &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Sandy Shores Airfield&lt;/a&gt;. Trevor orders Ron to sneak into the airfield while Trevor provides cover as a lookout in a water tower. After Trevor \"buys\" a &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Sniper Rifle&lt;/a&gt;, Ron takes his &lt;a href=\"Blazer\"&gt;Blazer&lt;/a&gt; and sneaks into the airfield undetected, thanks to Trevor's sniping. Ron places explosives on the gas tank and it explodes. The duo flies off in two &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20800\"&gt;airplanes&lt;/a&gt; and deliver the guns to their Mexican contact, before landing at &lt;a href=\"McKenzie%20Field%20Hangar\"&gt;McKenzie Field&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Wade discovers &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael Townley&lt;/a&gt;'s whereabouts in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor puts Ron in temporary charge of Trevor Philips Enterprises while he and Wade are in Los Santos. Ron remains in Sandy Shores and runs the business during Trevor's absence. While Trevor is in Los Santos, Ron occasionally contacts Trevor asking for advice and to inform Trevor that some &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Triads\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; men have been surveying Trevor's trailer and his &lt;a href=\"Liquor%20Ace\"&gt;meth lab&lt;/a&gt;. Trevor can also call Ron on occasion to ask him about the business.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Caida%20Libre\"&gt;working&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin Madrazo&lt;/a&gt;, kidnapping his &lt;a href=\"Patricia%20Madrazo\"&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt; and being exiled from Los Santos, Trevor finally returns to Sandy Shores with Michael and he starts working with Ron again. While Trevor was away, Ron says that he has been monitoring chatter and tapping into &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt; networks to collect information about them. Trevor uses this information to \"&lt;a href=\"Minor%20Turbulence\"&gt;intercept&lt;/a&gt;\" a Merryweather weapons &lt;a href=\"Cargo%20Plane\"&gt;plane&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href=\"Derailed\"&gt;derailing&lt;/a&gt; a Merryweather &lt;a href=\"Freight%20Train\"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt; carrying precious goods. Ron also interacts with Michael for the first time during his stay in Sandy Shores, when they can be seen discussing Ron's paranoia in one &lt;a href=\"Switch%20Scenes\"&gt;switch scene&lt;/a&gt;, and the player can speak to Ron while controlling Michael using the interact button, although Ron will respond by insulting Michael.\nAfter Trevor returns to Los Santos, Ron is only heard again in two missions. The first is in &lt;a href=\"Bury%20the%20Hatchet\"&gt;Bury the Hatchet&lt;/a&gt; if the player starts the mission using Trevor, where Trevor asks Ron to prepare a plane for him to go to &lt;a href=\"North%20Yankton\"&gt;North Yankton&lt;/a&gt;. The other depends on the player's choice at the end of the game.\nEnding.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nEnding C=\nRon sends a text message to Trevor informing him that he has left a &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Rod%20Blazer\"&gt;gift&lt;/a&gt; to him by his &lt;a href=\"Trevor%27s%20Trailer\"&gt;trailer&lt;/a&gt;. During the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;The Third Way&lt;/a&gt;, if the player switches to Trevor while the protagonists are driving towards their targets, Trevor will call Ron to inform him that &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Enterprises\"&gt;Trevor Philips Enterprises&lt;/a&gt;' future looks good, since they have more money coming in and that the \"Chinese problem\" will soon be taken care of. Ron appears optimistic after hearing this.\nEnding A=\nRon sends an e-mail message to Michael saying that he can't believe he killed Trevor, and that thanks to him he lost everything he had, his best friend and the business they developed. Ron insults Michael, who treats his email as \"spam\" and tells Ron not to contact him again.\nEnding B=\nRon sends a text message to Trevor informing him that he has left a &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Rod%20Blazer\"&gt;gift&lt;/a&gt; to him by his &lt;a href=\"Trevor%27s%20Trailer\"&gt;trailer&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nDuring and after the storyline, Ron can often be found outside Trevor's trailer, spouting random conspiracy theories or training his aim by shooting tin cans. He can also be found inside the trailer listening to a radio through headphones. If the player interacts with Ron as Trevor, he will insult Ron for how \"useless\" he is with Ron apologizing as a response. If the player interacts with Ron as Michael, he will call him \"Trevor's weird friend\" and creepy, but Ron does not respond. &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; is the only &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; who cannot interact with Ron because they did not meet each other in the storyline.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" (after \"Grand Theft Auto V\").\nSmuggler's Run.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2017\"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;, Ron secures a partnership with the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist in the contraband smuggling business, in which he gets a 3% cut of the goods smuggled by the player. Once the protagonist purchases a &lt;a href=\"Hangars\"&gt;hangar&lt;/a&gt;, he is seen trying to dispose the bodies of two agents. When introducing the hangar, he makes a passing reference to Trevor having \"gone &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; on him\" and refers to him indirectly as his \"old boss\", revealing Ron and Trevor's parternship has come to an end sometime between 2013 and 2017.\nA new episode of the Blaine County Radio Community Hour podcast is broadcast by Blaine County Talk Radio, featuring various references to events during \"Grand Theft Auto V\"s timeline, \"Grand Theft Auto\" itself and events such as snow in Los Santos during Christmas events and switching characters, and a monologue indirectly referencing the fact that the \"GTA Online\"s timeline is now advancing in real-life timing. It also stars a guest, a right-wing activist named &lt;a href=\"Sophia%20Bowles-Carmichael\"&gt;Sophia Bowles-Carmichael&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, Ron discovers that Sophia merely came onto the show to seduce him as she hadn't been with a man in a decade. She attempts to bang on the doors of Ron's rooms to let her back in, but Ron rejects this.\nLos Santos Drug Wars.\nIn late &lt;a href=\"2022\"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;, Ron calls the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist, telling them an unidentified group has taken over Trevor's old property at &lt;a href=\"Ace%20Liquor\"&gt;Liquor Ace&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt; and asking them to meet him there. When the protagonist arrives, they find a crowd gathered to watch an impromptu wrestling match, as Ron had somehow ended up going against a large woman, later revealed to be &lt;a href=\"Luchadora\"&gt;Luchadora&lt;/a&gt;, who easily pins him down. Ron asks the protagonist to help him before things are interrupted by the group's leader, &lt;a href=\"Dax\"&gt;Dax&lt;/a&gt;, who questions the protagonist. Ron introduces them as his \"extremely dangerous\" friend, and after determining the protagonist is cool, Dax introduces them to the rest of his &lt;a href=\"Fooliganz\"&gt;troupe&lt;/a&gt;, including Luchadora and &lt;a href=\"Labrat\"&gt;Labrat&lt;/a&gt;. Ron later expresses concern to Dax about &lt;a href=\"Chef\"&gt;Chef&lt;/a&gt;, who has passed out after taking a large number of drugs, and advises the protagonist not to join up with the troupe, seeing them as nothing more than a bunch of \"weirdos\". He then manages to rouse Chef and help him leave the scene, just before &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;'s attack on the liquor store.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nRockstar describes Ron by saying \"if his best buddy Trevor Philips is like a shark, Ron is like a remora\", who is \"paranoid but terrified\" of Trevor.\nRon describes himself as a \"independent thinker\" who lives in Sandy Shores to be \"away from the man\". This has resulted in Ron becoming very paranoid, constantly worrying about government surveillance, such as wiretapping cellphones, or various other conspiracies. This can be seen multiple times during the storyline, like when he claims that the &lt;a href=\"military\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; sent a drone to spy on him and Trevor due to their arms dealing or when he is found outside Trevor's Trailer using a &lt;a href=\"Digiscanner\"&gt;device&lt;/a&gt; to locate alien frequencies.\nHe is an unlikely friend of Trevor but as said above, he is terrified of him and so goes to great lengths to appease him whenever he can, such as when he let Trevor bully him into giving up his share of the profits of an &lt;a href=\"Nervous%20Ron\"&gt;arms dealing job&lt;/a&gt; the two carried out, especially if Trevor is close to losing his very short temper. Trevor describes Ron as a \"conspiracy theorist\", which fits with his paranoia. Despite Ron's timidness, he acts as a sort of henchman for Trevor and helps him with missions such as sneaking around the Lost MC's base to plant explosives while Trevor watches and covers him through a sniper scope, which indicates a level of trust between them, and when Trevor introduces Ron to Michael, he describes Ron as \"very loyal\" and \"dependable\".\nDue to trying to appease Trevor whenever he can, Ron will always agree with Trevor even when the latter insults him or his conspiracy theories, making him something of a \"yes man\". Despite his fear, he seems to genuinely look up to Trevor, even with Trevor often threatening him with violence. This concern can be seen in the mission Derailed, where Ron admits to Michael that Trevor is indeed a \"bad person\", but he does have a \"sensitive side\". Ron's undying loyalty to Trevor is also shown in a text at the end of &lt;a href=\"Something%20Sensible\"&gt;Something Sensible&lt;/a&gt;, where he curses Michael for killing Trevor, showing also that Ron's loyalty to him is more than just out of fear.\nDespite his loyalty to Trevor, it's clear that Trevor is a toxic influence on Ron. Trevor's regular threats of violence against Ron have had negative effects on Ron's life (Trevor was the reason Ron's wife divorced him after he threatened to dismember her), and his fear of what will happen should Trevor follow through on his threats causes him to agree with whatever he's planning in order to appease him, leading him to develop Stockholm Syndrome to a degree. This is exemplified during when Ron, fearful that the might become hostile should he screw up, begs them not to hurt him. \nDespite his timidness and meek personality, Ron has shown himself capable of murder without any prompt from Trevor, as the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist met Ron in a hangar after he just killed two agents. Ron also became a partner of another business and occasionally gave out missions that sometimes required killing other competitors to the smuggling operation, showing that Ron has become dangerous and ruthless in his own right due to Trevor's influence and his own paranoid personality.\nAppearance.\nRon Jakowski is a middle-aged white man. He has short grey hair, stubble, blue eyes, and a cleft chin, and wears a grey bucket hat with a red, white, and blue band, and large-framed tortoiseshell eyeglasses with one hinge taped. If his hat is removed, Ron's receding hairline can be seen. As a result of his &lt;a href=\"Methamphetamine\"&gt;meth&lt;/a&gt; usage, Ron regularly appeared with scabs and blemishes on his face. By &lt;a href=\"2022\"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;, his face is significantly cleaner, suggesting he may no longer be using methamphetamine by this time.\nHis typical outfit consists of his hat and glasses, a red plaid shirt worn over a white tank top, a necklace with a small medallion, tan cargo shorts, a knee brace, and Birkenstock sandals. In 2022, he now sports a blue plaid shirt instead of a red one, his shorts are now brown, and his hat band is black and yellow."}

Three of the four vehicular entry points to the building are blocked by parked cars. Eight Professionals and five FIB agents armed with &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;Assault Rifles&lt;/a&gt; are conducting a handover of the target documents. One of the Professionals can be heard mentioning company secrets during the mission, implying that he is getting questions from one of the FIB invading his privacy regarding his company.\nFrom this point, this mission has been patched many times to fix bugs/exploits and increase the difficulty.\nVersion History.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nCurrent mission=\nMay 2014-current.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"High%20Life%20Update\"&gt;High Life Update&lt;/a&gt; in May 2014, the mission difficulty was changed, similar to &lt;a href=\"Coveted\"&gt;Coveted&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player(s) must kill all the FIB agents and Professionals at the parking lot.

It was initially made available in \"GTA Online\" as a time-restricted vehicle from February 13 to March 3, 2014, and later re-released, for both games, indefinitely.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe vehicle is based on the custom owned by the infamous mobster , along with elements from the Cadillac 341B. Its grille and headlights (including its metal mesh covers) are based from certain Bentley car models from the same period, particularly the 1927 . According to the Newswire description, the vehicle is armored.\nThe Roosevelt is depicted as a classic 1920s sedan, where the front end has visible frames that are part of the chassis, holding dual chrome bumper bars spanning the car's width. There are four drum headlights closely installed together in front of the grille, with the upper ones having metal mesh covers and the lower ones being smaller and function as high-beam lights. The grille has a chrome finish around and bears the Albany logo on the front, while the hood area features a chrome strip near the windshield that separates the engine compartment from the rest of the car.\nOn the sides, the car feature large side arches and stepsides running across the car, along with what seems to be four small containers situated under the doors. The front arches have two spare wheels preserved in black leather cases tied with two small straps. The greenhouse area makes use of two circula fog lights on the A-pillars and a sunshade on top of the windshield, together with a soft leather top over the seats area.\nThe rear of the car has a black luggage bag/chest located behind a rear rack, which cannot be opened in normal gameplay and is considered an extra component. There are two small red circular tail lights mounted over the rear arches, as well as dual chrome bumper bars spanning the car's width, similar to the front. A license plate can be seen on the passenger side, over the bumper frames.\nThe interior of the car is unique, well detailed, and appropriate for its era, using a wooden backing with multiple brass dials. The car also employs classically upholstered bench seats in place of independent seats, while the doors have inner pull handles in place of lever handles like most modern cars. Additional wooden details can be also seen around the windows and beside the bench seats. The car mistakenly seems to have a steering wheel that would match a car from the 1950s and 1960s.\nThe Roosevelt comes in a variety of colors, where the primary one is applied to the chassis frames holding the front bumper, bodywork, window surroundings and wheel rims, while the secondary color is applied on the side arches, stepsides, lower containers, cabin area and rear luggage rack, along with thin stripes passing through the chrome door handles and running towards the rear wall of the car. It uses a unique set of wire rims with a circular center, wrapped in medium-profile tires.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Roosevelt drives smoothly and can go up to relatively high speeds, although acceleration is not as good and it is quite heavy (possibly due to its thick armor). With its archaic suspension, spinning out is very likely at higher speeds, and oversteer may become an issue. Lowering the suspension may help prevent this since it will reduce body roll. It is quite durable and proves capable when off-roading.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Granger\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Granger\"&gt;its&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lifeguard\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Park%20Ranger\"&gt;enforcement&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20SUV\"&gt;variants&lt;/a&gt;), players can ride on the sides of the vehicle, standing on the running boards. While doing so, they are able to use assault rifles and MGs, which are not normally available for use in any vehicle other than helicopters. However, as like any vehicle of this type, passengers hanging from the outside will fall off from harder collisions, scraping against surfaces or impacts from large heights. The number of passengers may affect the car's acceleration.\nThe Roosevelt is powered a massive V12 engine with 6 double-barrel downdraft carburetors, coupled to a 4-speed transmission in a RWD layout. Its engine produces a unique noisy sound, being somewhat smoother than diesel engines from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, the car has modern spare wheel coverings with chrome circular mirrors on top, as well as whitewall tires. The metal mesh covers are absent, but can be added back via customization. The car also retains the same brown leather interior with the same brass dials over a wooden backing.\nColor distribution is similar to the Roosevelt, having the primary color applied on the front chassis frames, bodywork and window surroundings, and the secondary colour applied on the side arches, stepsides, cabin, rear luggage rack and the thin stripes passing through the sides and going towards the rear. Although not accessible, a tertiary color is also available for the roof panel, which is always set to black on purchased examples. The vehicle shares the same wire rim design as the regular Roosevelt, though assigned with a dedicated wheel color instead of the primary one.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nPerformance-wise, the Roosevelt Valor performs identical to the regular version, having a relatively good top speed and durability, but below average acceleration and high chances of spinning out due to the archaic suspension. Like the regular Roosevelt, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Granger\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"FIB%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20SUV\"&gt;enforcement&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Park%20Ranger\"&gt;variants&lt;/a&gt;, two passengers can hang on the sides, allowing them to use assault rifles and light machine guns for &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-bys&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike the standard Roosevelt, the Roosevelt Valor is powered by the same massive V12 engine with 6 double-barrel downdraft carburetors, coupled to a 4-speed transmission in a RWD layout.

It is 77 storeys high, making it the tallest building in the city before the &lt;a href=\"Zirconium%20Building\"&gt;Zirconium Building&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bawsaq%20Building\"&gt;Bawsaq Building&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"South%20Parkway%20Building\"&gt;South Parkway Building&lt;/a&gt; in descending order. It is marked on the official Manual Liberty City Area Map as a Point of Interest.\nThe player can access an observation deck situated at the top of the tower and look through its multitudinous binoculars. Due to the considerable height of the building, a sniper rifle will have no use on the observation deck as &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"vehicles\"&gt;vehicles&lt;/a&gt; will not spawn on the ground while the player is at that height. It is safe from the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt;, as only the player can access the observation deck. However, there are no other escape routes, so it is an inadvisable destination if it lies within the &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted&lt;/a&gt; search radius.\nThe closest underground railway station is &lt;a href=\"Suffolk%20Station\"&gt;Suffolk Station&lt;/a&gt; located on &lt;a href=\"Garnet%20Street\"&gt;Garnet Street&lt;/a&gt;, to the southern elevation of the building. It is served by the &lt;a href=\"Algonquin%20Inner%20Line\"&gt;K/C Algonquin Inner Line&lt;/a&gt;. The building is heavily guarded: uniformed security guards can be found in the entrance lobby, occasionally along with LCPD officers. Two officers with &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt;s can be found at a static post outside the main entrance of the building.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nWhile the interior is inaccessible (unlike in &lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;, \"vide infra\") in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", the observation deck can be accessed via a floating blue arrow icon located on the eastern elevation, on &lt;a href=\"Denver-Exeter%20Avenue\"&gt;Denver-Exeter Avenue&lt;/a&gt;. The building features \"Empire State\" textures above the entrances - perhaps an oversight on the part of the developers.\nOne &lt;a href=\"Higgins%20Helitours\"&gt;Helitour pilot&lt;/a&gt; mentions that his friend attempted to from the tower, but was stopped by &lt;a href=\"Security%20Guards\"&gt;security guards&lt;/a&gt; who \"were tubby, but they sure could move!\" These security guards seem to be absent from the observation deck, however.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", the Rotterdam Tower exhibits many differences as far as functionality and exterior design are concerned, perhaps most notably the implementation of an accessible lobby. The exterior door textures are replaced by accessible doors leading into a lavishly decorated lobby featuring ceramic textures, large pillars, several paintings and relief displays naming several \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" cities such as &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;. The original observation deck teleporter located just outside the doors remains in place.\nThe observation deck is also vastly different. A staircase leads to the upper pylon, several satellite dishes were removed, and some details were added on the spire, including an interactive ladder, a new framework holding the ladder in place, and new signage. A large neon sign facing north displays \"Rotterdam Tower: Top of the World\", which is visible from &lt;a href=\"Star%20Junction\"&gt;Star Junction&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"parachute\"&gt;parachute&lt;/a&gt; is located on the top of the first ladder. Two ladders on the eastern and western elevations of the building were also removed, which in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" allowed players to descend to the immediate setback below. Night lighting at the top of the building was also changed; as opposed to the original blue, white and red color scheme present at night, \"TBoGT\" replaces them with bright purple and red colors, albeit only visible at certain distances (see &lt;a href=\"%23Bugs/Glitches\"&gt;Bugs/Glitches&lt;/a&gt;). The \"Empire State\" sign on the entrance walls was removed. These modifications do not concern \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\".\nFinally, the building's textures were halved in resolution. The original \"GTA IV\" textures, all 512x512, are still present in the base version of both games, but \"TBoGT\" patch files override the original textures in \"TBoGT \"with 256x256 textures, thus reducing the visual quality of the building. The original LOD textures remain unchanged, including the minuscule \"Empire State\" texture which appears to have been clashing (or ) with the higher quality textures in \"GTA IV.\" However, an updated \"base floor\" model in \"TBoGT\" appears to have rectified z-fighting bugs by re-positioning the entrance wall textures ever so slightly in comparison to LODs, which still clash with the model, but are otherwise no longer noticeable. None of the changes made in \"TBoGT\" are present in \"TLAD\", however, retaining the original \"GTA IV\" design.\nInfluence.\nThe Rotterdam Tower is based on the located on 20 W 34th St, New York, United States. The real-life building is referenced in one of Brucie's heli tours, as he states \"If I were that big chimp, I'd climb it too!\" as a reference to , specifically the scene where King Kong climbs the Empire State Building. The building is named after the city of in the Netherlands.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn , only the lower level exterior walls are visible due to the \"top down\" perspective. However, the entire building appears in the background when talking with the &lt;a href=\"Osama\"&gt;drug dealer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Happiness%20Island\"&gt;Happiness Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nOversights.\nThe night lights at the top of the building in PC versions of \"GTA IV\" with version 1.0.6.0 or newer installed and both PC \"\" DLC versions of the game have broken emissive shaders. While in console versions and PC versions that are older than version 1.0.6.0 of \"GTA IV\" and \"Episodes from Liberty City\", the blue, red and white lights on top the tower would show from afar."}

{"id": "101349", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=101349", "title": "Rubble", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Jobuilt\"&gt;Jobuilt&lt;/a&gt; Rubble is a dump truck appearing in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" and due to appear in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto VI&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Rubble is based on a Peterbilt 359 dump truck, with cues from a 1984 Peterbilt 359 EXHD.\nThe vehicle is essentially a dump-truck variant of the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;, which shares the same cabin design and most of the initial features. However, the Rubble has two sets of front-facing marker lights between the nose and the air cleaners, which are not present on the Phantom. The truck also lacks the badges found above the grille and on the sides of the nose.\nThe rear section is mainly occupied by the tipper, which features a tarp system that pivots from the lower middle section (similar to the &lt;a href=\"Tipper\"&gt;Tipper&lt;/a&gt;) and an unopenable tailgate on the rear end. There are various marker lights on the upper front and on the sides of the rear tipper, while the rear outer edges have vertical tail lights. The sides of the chassis have the corresponding fuel tanks on either side and a single oil tank on the left, along with a set of brown mudflaps that are similar to the ones seen on trucks such as the &lt;a href=\"Biff\"&gt;Biff&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Trashmaster\"&gt;Trashmaster&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe truck shares the same interior with the Phantom, using an analog dial set and extra components derived from various industrial vehicles. The Rubble is also fitted with a CB radio, and occasional trucker chatter can be heard regardless of whether the main radio is turned on or off. The chatter will only play if playing as &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Rubble always spawn in a rusty/faded appearance and can spawn either empty or with a pile of construction rubble on the back. The vehicle spawns in a limited variety of primary colors for the cabin and secondary colors for the rear tipper, and uses the same industrial wheels from trucks like the Phantom and the Tipper.\nAll Rubbles are operated by &lt;a href=\"Skiver%20Construction%20Corporation\"&gt;Skiver Construction Corporation&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe truck is very heavy, having the &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; struggle to hold it, and, because of the sheer size of it, when traveling around sharp corners, it will tend to tip over. In general, a lot of its performance aspects are carried over from the Phantom, although the top speed is seemingly lower and due to the heavier weight, the vehicle struggles to corner without resistance. The heavy weight also means it matches other large trucks in the ability to ram other vehicles off the road with relative ease, and durability is extremely high.\nDespite the cab being based directly on the Phantom, the engine model is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Scrap%20Truck\"&gt;Scrap Truck&lt;/a&gt;, being a front mounted turbocharged, twin-cam, four-cylinder engine. Despite this, the engine sound remains the same as the Phantoms. This engine is mounted in a front-engine, rear wheel drive layout, and uses a 4-speed gearbox.\nPlayers can climb onto the cab and ride on it without the risk of falling off/out. Smaller vehicles such as motorcycles and compact cars can be driven inside the tipper compartment and be carried, although this may result in increased weight and higher chances of tipping over when performing sharp turns, aside from the transported vehicle constantly hitting the tipper's walls."}

Rudy asks Huang to come to the meeting with him so they can use this opportunity to kill Capra, but it turns out that it was all an ambush by Capra to kill Rudy.

Hsin asks for any proof that Capra was the rat and when Huang says that he has none, he finally realizes that Jimmy Capra was never the rat in the first place. In fact, realizing Huang's capabilities, Rudy was just taking advantage of Huang's desperation to find the traitor, to deal with a 'trouble' he had with Jimmy Capra. Huang then &lt;a href=\"A%20Rude%20Awakening\"&gt;decides to go after Rudy&lt;/a&gt; to have his revenge and to make amends for his actions against Capra.\nHuang goes looking at all the places he previously meet D'Avanzo to locate him.

Jayvon is also the current boyfriend of Dwayne's ex-girlfriend, &lt;a href=\"Cherise%20Glover\"&gt;Cherise Glover&lt;/a&gt;. Dwayne says that he was sending this money to Cherise from prison to help pay her rent, but now that he knows that she was giving the money to Jayvon instead he wants it back.

The argument was followed by a chase on motorbikes then his grizzly murder. It is no surprise that upset community leaders are pointing to games as the cause of this death: the pattern of altercation, vehicle chase, murder, rebirth and try again is common in video games. Although Mr. Simson was a known drug user and dealer with several convictions, we are certain this case is due to polygons and pixels not parole boards.\""}

In the enhanced version, the Ruffian uses the \"Sports Bike\" dial set also used on the aforementioned bikes, specifically the speedometer.\nThe main body of the bike features a black frame around the upper and rear area of the engine bay, while the fuel tank is large and has two vented sections around the front and silver lettering on either side, displaying the manufacturer name. The engine bay has the corresponding radiator on the front, the exhaust tubes passing on the frontal and lower area of the same engine bay, and foot pegs mounted on the basic frame, intended for the rider.\nThe rear section features a black seat for the rider and a passenger, foot pegs on the lower frame intended for the passenger and dual exhaust tubes below, partially covered by a carbon-fibre panel. There is a single red tail light on the rear end and a black plate holder below, with the corresponding license plate and turn indicators beside it. The rear wheel is connected to the vehicle by a dual-sided swing-arm, having a small carbon-fibre mudguard, a single suspension spring and the corresponding chain drive and sprocket on the left.\nThe Ruffian spawns in two variations: The first one has a small fairing with a small intake, a single circular headlamp above the intake and a glass visor on top, with small mirrors on the handlebars. The second one, on the other part, has no fairing, no mirrors and dual circular headlamps.\nThe bike spawns in a variety of primary colours applied on the fuel tank and rear section, and the rims use a dedicated wheel colour, which can be painted by selecting a custom rear wheel, applying a colour and change back to the stock wheel (as it won't reset to the default alloy color). The bike uses split six-spoke rims similar to the \"Speedway\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, with the rear wheel being wider.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Ruffian is a very quick and versatile sportsbike. Its engine gives it excellent acceleration and decent top speed. Greater stability is credited to its longer wheelbase, which makes cruising at high speeds safer than other shorter bikes. In addition, despite being a sportsbike, it does not notably suffer when driving off-road. While it is clearly not optimal, a skilled driver can make the minor disadvantage seem nonexistent. It is one of the fastest bikes in the game, only falling behind the &lt;a href=\"Bati%20800\"&gt;Bati 801&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Akuma\"&gt;Akuma&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Vader\"&gt;Vader&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the other hand, cornering does suffer. It is considerably less agile than other motorcycles and is thus not well suited for race circuits with more turns than straights. Stunt agility, however, is notable. Pulling tricks with this bike is quite easy thanks to its high ride height, ease of performing wheelies and light weight.\u00a0\nThe Ruffian is powered by a 3-cylinder engine, which is supported by the 3-1 exhaust manifold (3 into 1) seen on the bike. The engine noise appears to be a lower-revving, lower-pitched variation of the one used in the Bati 801 and its &lt;a href=\"Bati%20Custom\"&gt;RR variant&lt;/a&gt;."}

In \"GTA IV\" the hood features an optional offset cowl induction hood strikingly similar to those found on 1982-1984 Trans Ams and 1985-1992 Firebird Formulas. The front fascia elements, wheel design, boot, and tail light layout are modeled after the , while the headlights and exhausts resemble those from the . The front bumper seems to be a mix of both Starion and 300ZX bumpers.\nThe tail lights and trunk spoiler are shaped like those of the Camaro, but the area between and below the tail lights better resembles the Firebird, with badging positioned where the Firebird logo would be. Ruiners may feature \"RUINER\" decals and stripes along the lower part of the doors, much like those of the Camaro IROC-Z, although the stripes and decals share colors with the ground effects, much like the 1982\u20131984 Trans Ams.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Ruiner assumes a similar role and build from the \"\" iteration of the &lt;a href=\"Buffalo\"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, but sports modernized features around. The front end has a slanted profile, with small intakes on the lower edges and a central grille/intake below the bumper area, just behind a plate holder. The turn signals can be seen on the bumper, while a set of square-shaped lights can be seen on the hood area within black housings, under small hatches that resemble pop-up headlights (though no animation is present). The section between the main lights bears silver \"IMPONTE\" lettering next to the driver-side lamp, while the front of the hood bears the manufacturer emblem.\nOn the sides, a set of marker lights and silver \"IMPONTE\" lettering are seen on the front, while the arches and the skirts have a slightly flared profile. The doors have black horizontal handles and body-colored mirror shells with black supports, while the greenhouse area bears a plastic trim around the windows, a painted C-pillar with \"450GT\" badges on either side and a central frame on the roof area. The rear trunk lid/hatch bears a lip spoiler.\nThe rear end of the car features a plastic panel on the center bearing numerous badges, while the outer sections have sectioned tail lights consisting of L-shaped indicator units, upper brake units, middle main units and inner reverse units (with the lower red ones between the indicators and the reverse lights not being used). The center of the bumper features a flat section with a plate holder, while the driver-side section at the bottom has a cut-out for the twin circular exhaust tips.\nThe Ruiner features a roof, which comes in three different variations: with solid roof panels, with glass roof panels or without roof panels. It may feature a plain hood or with an offset cowl induction hood. Ruiners can spawn in a variety of colors, with the primary one on the body and the secondary one on the mirror shells and in the form of stripes on the lower side, displaying the car's name. A tertiary color is also available for the rims, which is set to white or gold (the latter only available in at least three color sets). The rims have five wide spokes with a pentagon-shaped center and black details.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Ruiner retains its design from \"GTA IV\", with only minor changes. It features a quad exhaust instead of the dual exhaust present on the \"GTA IV\" version. The turbo hood bulge is no longer available and a traditional ram air hood (similar to the &lt;a href=\"Buffalo\"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt; from \"\") can be applied to it instead. There have also been minor changes to the badges and decals.\nAs of Patch 1.29, the three T-Top roof options from the \"GTA IV\" version are present but cannot be changed by the player and are random at spawn. All variants spawns with its windows rolled up, even without roof panels. Color distribution is the same as before, but the mirrors changed to receive the primary color and the interior stitching matches with the same primary one. The Ruiner's rim design is the same, able to be found in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; under the Muscle category, named \"Mecha\". There is also an off-road counterpart under the Off Road category, named \"Dune Basher\". Unique to the stock rims, however, is that the wheel color has a darker tone (although painting the stock wheels is only possible on &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;).\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"GTA IV\", the car handles quite loosely, being able to perform power slides with ease, and in the hands of a skilled driver, can prove to be an excellently handling vehicle. The car can brake easily, and can accelerate quickly, leaving the player with a well-rounded muscle car, perfect for any criminal getaway. Just be careful for the lack of durability and low ground clearance. The Ruiner is also a great choice for &lt;a href=\"Races%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;races&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to its badges, the Ruiner is powered by a large 450 cubic inches (7.4 liter) Fuel injected &lt;a href=\"Engines\"&gt;V8&lt;/a&gt; engine, which is supported by its engine model (a single cam V8, judging by its small details on the cam covers), coupled to a 5-speed gearbox. Its engine sound is identical to that of the &lt;a href=\"Faction\"&gt;Faction&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sabre\"&gt;Sabre&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nAcceleration is very good, close to cars with a much higher price tag. Its top speed is also excellent; it is brisk, yet controllable.\nThe suspension is moderately firm, giving the Ruiner much needed grip in the turns, while still loose enough to have some fun with. Handling-wise, the Ruiner is a stellar performer, with constant grip, controllable loss of traction, and a lot of torque. Braking is very good, if not among the best in its class. Crash deformation is acceptable, but can only withstand a few high-speed crashes before stalling.\nAs in \"GTA IV\", the Ruiner is powered by the same 450cui Fuel-injected V8 (according to badges), coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear-wheel drive layout. The engine sound is the same as the one on the &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt;.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nAs of the update for \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Ruiner received livery modifications, not available in Story Mode."}

The headlights are hidden within the car and act as pop-up units, which retain the square-shaped lights from the standard Ruiner. It also features the same offset cowl induction hood from the standard model in \"GTA IV\" but with a vent insert instead of a solid panel. The sides are mostly identical to the Ruiner, but without the side marker lights and all of the silver badges. The cabin is mostly identical, with the exception of the permanently solid roof with a small hatch. The rear of the car retains the lip spoiler, the central plate holder and the quad exhaust setup, but features a black panel containing LED tail lights on the same position as the ones from the Ruiner, with the outer ones being the brake/marker lights and the inner ones the reverse lights and turn signals.\nCompared to the standard version, the Ruiner 2000 gains a completely redesigned interior, consisting of dual digital displays with numerous switches below them and RPM indicators in the center, reused from race-type interiors. A radio display can be also seen in the center of the console, facing to the driver side.\nColor distribution is similar to the normal Ruiner, with the primary one on the body, interior stitching and details of the steering wheel and the secondary one in the form of two stripes on the lower side, though no longer bearing the \"RUINER\" name on the sides.

The hood is based on the \" hood from the WS6 performance package. The headlights seem to be slightly inspired by the Firebird package \", but they follow the shape of the . The front bumper is similar to the , while the rear bumper is similar to the for the Camaro. Unlike its real-life counterpart, the Ruiner ZZ-8 does not include pop-up headlights.\nDesign.\nThe design and profile of the car remain relatively similar to its &lt;a href=\"Ruiner\"&gt;older generation&lt;/a&gt;, albeit featuring a more modern styling and additional features. The front end has a slanted profile, with small intakes on the lower edges and a central section with a license plate in the center and dual intakes beside it. The turn signals can be seen on the bumper just above the outer intakes, while a set of modern headlights are seen on the hood area, which are divided into four sections and are located under small hatches that resemble pop-up headlights (though no animation is present). The hood area is predominated by dual intakes in the center, with a bulky profile that runs towards the cabin area.\nOn the sides, small exit vents are seen on the front and a set of marker lights on the rear, while the skirts have a slightly flared profile. The doors have numerous badges around the front and black horizontal handles, while the greenhouse area is mostly finished in a plastic trim and bears a painted C-pillar and a central frame on the roof area. The trunk lid mounts a large spoiler by default.\nThe rear end of the car features a plastic panel in the center with markings that read \"IMPONTE\" (originally being silver lettering on initial release, but later replaced with a debossed effect in the update), while the outer sections have modernized tail lights with a hexagonal pattern, divided into outer main units and inner brake units, along with circular reverse lights located within the inner units. The center of the bumper features an inset area for the license plate, while the bottom has a plastic section with dual exit vents on either side and a central moulding for the twin wide exhaust tips. The interior is the same one from cars such as the &lt;a href=\"9F\"&gt;9F&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20GT\"&gt;Rapid GT&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Adder\"&gt;Adder&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe primary color of the car is applied to the body and the engine cam covers, while the secondary one is applied to the C-pillar.

Though, turning too hard and aggressively at moderate-to-high speeds will make it start spinning out, so light steering is recommended to avoid oversteer at medium-to-high speeds. Despite its strong build, it deforms quite easily due to its fragile bodywork from hard collisions.\nThe Ruiner ZZ-8 is powered by single-cam V8 engine, with the badges indicating it being turbocharged. It is coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear-wheel drive layout, and the engine sound is the same as the one on the &lt;a href=\"Dominator%20ASP\"&gt;Dominator ASP&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ruiner%20ZZ-8\"&gt;Ruiner ZZ-8&lt;/a&gt; has been featured in the following events:\nChange History.\nReleased in ."}

While the cars top speed is only moderately high, the car possesses a good and consistent rate of acceleration that complements this ability well. Due to its lower speed and power, the car steering system is also responsive enough, allowing the player to determine the angle of cornering while the car still remains controllable, and is capable of recovering from a powerslide after a sharp turn; its brakes, especially when applied in high speed, are revealed to be average. All in all, the car manages to balance speed and control very well."}
{"id": "2331", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2331", "title": "Rumpo", "text": "The Rumpo is a van featured in the and . It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Bravado\"&gt;Bravado&lt;/a&gt; in the HD Universe.\nDescription.\nThe Rumpo has retained its overall design throughout the series, being an average-sized van capable of carrying four passengers (two in the front, two in the back).\n3D Universe.\nIn \"GTA III\", the Rumpo chiefly resembles a Dodge Ram Van; in subsequent games, however, the Ram Van-derived vehicle becomes the &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt;. In \"GTA III\", the &lt;a href=\"Pony\"&gt;Pony&lt;/a&gt; is a large van with an elevated roof; in \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA San Andreas\", the Rumpo inherited this design, and the Pony was given a new one.\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nIn and , the van appears to be based on a , with the side paneling of a Ford Van. A design trait unique to this rendition of the Rumpo are the small 70's-style windows located at the rear of the van. The van spawns in a variety of primary colors for the body, and different tones of gray for the bumpers and headlight surroundings.\nIn , and , the Rumpo is very different, appearing to resemble the , and takes the design originally sported by the &lt;a href=\"Pony\"&gt;Pony&lt;/a&gt; (see 'Naming confusion' section below). The \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition is shown with side marker lights, details around the rear compartment and smaller wheel arches.\nRumpos typically sport a variety of company logos and are seen in a variety of primary colors for the body. The company logos that may appear are:\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn and , the Rumpo adopts a design inverse to that of the &lt;a href=\"Speedo\"&gt;Speedo&lt;/a&gt;, resembling the with touches from the . Unlike most &lt;a href=\"Bravado\"&gt;Bravado&lt;/a&gt; vehicles, the Rumpo does not take any inspiration from any Dodge car.\nThe Rumpo is shown with a relatively similar appearance to the \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" renditions, albeit with a more modern design and various details. The front is predominately finished in chrome and sports a traditional bumper with a plastic finish at the bottom half, and a narrow mesh intake/vent in the center of the upper half, spanning about half the van's width. The entire front end is seemingly linear in shape with the outer portions slightly angled upwards, where the main grille appears to have its outer edges aligned with the outer edges of the bumper intake/vent, and bears three horizontal dividers, with the middle one being wider and bearing the Bravado emblem. Either side of the grille area has a set of dual rectangular headlights with small indicators on the outer edges, which are split by separations that are as wide as the middle grille divider, and their outermost edges run parallel to the outer edges of the grille and the top angled edges of the van. A small hood lid is visible, which has an elevated compartment that is about as wide as the main grille, while leaving a small gap near the windshield, also following the slight curvature of the latter.\nThe sides of the van are clearly denoted by smooth body lines around, being the curved shapes above the wheel arches, the lower ridges between the arches and the upper lines passing through the whole body, in conjunction with protruding shapes at the bottom. The doors make use of rectangular mirror wings and vertical handles finished in plastic, while the windows have plastic trim around and impressed panelling on either side of the rear compartment. The van also has an unknown window tint applied by default. The roof area is flat in shape, with protruding lines passing through the sides and rear, just above the windows.\nThe rear of the van features two large doors with square windows, with the driver-side one bearing the Bravado badge at the bottom and the passenger-side one a plastic section for a license plate. On either side of the rear are two vertical tail lights, whose lower edges coincide with the bottom of the rear door windows and are split between upper brake lights, middle reverse lights and lower main lights. There is a smooth body line located below the plate holder, which spans the whole width of the van, while a fully-chromed bumper sits at the bottom. On the underside, the exhaust muffler and tip can be seen on the rear-left quarter of the vehicle. Its interior is shared with other vans and various trucks in the game, which in the enhanced version use the analog \"Truck\" dials.\nThe vehicle may occasionally spawn with a &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; livery (though not featuring any specialized equipment), and is available in colors of white, black, red, and shades of grey and silver. As of the update, the Rumpo can be customized at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops to add or remove the Weazel News livery, though the color still cannot be changed. It shares the wheel design with the &lt;a href=\"Speedo\"&gt;Speedo&lt;/a&gt;, being five-spoke rims with medium-profile tires.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe Rumpo originally introduced in \"Grand Theft Auto III\" is fairly fast, but with average handling and a tendency to two-wheel and tip over under rough cornering. These characteristics are shared with the \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\" version.\nThe redesigned Rumpo in \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" and \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\" handles much like the smaller Pony, but is actually lighter than it. Also, because of its height and stiff suspension, it has a nasty tendency to jolt around and even tip on bumpy roads.\nAll renditions of the vehicle use a petrol engine that powers the front wheels through a 5-speed gearbox, and it emits a generally smooth engine sound also shared with other vans, such as the &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt; and/or the &lt;a href=\"Pony\"&gt;Pony&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Rumpo in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" has average acceleration compared to other vans, but can be modified with a turbocharger in Los Santos Customs and other mod shops to bring it on par with the &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ambulance&lt;/a&gt;. The Rumpo is somewhat agile and can corner easily at low speeds. Durability is average. An advantage of the Rumpo is its high ground clearance, allowing it to cover rough ground with ease.\nThe Rumpo is powered by what looks like a single-cam engine, powering the rear wheels through a five-speed gearbox. The engine sound is the same smooth and low-revving one as the other vans in the game, such as the &lt;a href=\"Speedo\"&gt;Speedo&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Transporter\"&gt;Police Transporter&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is based on the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//sportsmobile.com/sportsmobile-4x4/\"&gt;Sportsmobile Classic 4\u00d74&lt;/a&gt;, an off-road van that was built on a chassis.\nThe Rumpo Custom makes use of several off-road modifications similar to the &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt; version of the &lt;a href=\"Mesa%20Grande\"&gt;Mesa&lt;/a&gt;, as well as small changes on the body. The front of the car is largely dominated by a black utility bumper with a mounted guard, with two circular flood lights mounted on it. Both the grille and the headlights were retained from the original Rumpo, albeit finished in black.\nOn the sides, the bottom area features tubular side steps and has two sliding doors that opens in a similar manner to the &lt;a href=\"Minivan%20Custom\"&gt;Minivan Custom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moonbeam\"&gt;Moonbeam&lt;/a&gt;, replacing the rear doors from the original model, as well as a small ladder on the rear left side. The cabin area appears to have small sunshades/deflectors on the door windows, and the roof features a full-size rack with four more flood lights on the front and a spare tire on the rear.\nThe rear end is mostly identical to the Rumpo, but there is a single compartment door with another spare tire mounted on the driver side, as well as a license plate on the passenger side. The tail lights are the same as the normal Rumpo, albeit placed on a lower height. A reinforced rear bumper with tail light guards can be seen as well.\nThe Rumpo Custom can be only painted in a single color, which also affects the stitching on the interior. The wheels share the rim color and design with the &lt;a href=\"Brawler\"&gt;Brawler&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in high-profile tires with knobby treads.\nThe vehicle features a unique horn not present on any other vehicle in the game.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Rumpo Custom performs much better than the standard model, since the off-road tires, combined with its high suspension, makes it much easier to drive over uneven terrains. The vehicle features bullet-resistant glass panes, giving the occupants temporary protection from gunfire.\nA disadvantage of the Rumpo Custom is its heightened suspension; even with upgraded suspension, it is prone to tip over when cornering at high speed, partially due to being rather soft, noticeable when making a sharp turn or braking. Being a van, it has average top speed and acceleration, which may be problematic at evading enemies.\nLike the standard Rumpo, the vehicle is powered by a single-cam V8 engine, coupled to a 5-gearbox in a front engine, all wheel drive layout. Its engine sound is also unique, being a higher-pitched and louder variation of the van sound commonly found on vans like the &lt;a href=\"Speedo\"&gt;Speedo&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Youga\"&gt;Youga&lt;/a&gt;."}

The tail boom houses the empennage with the horizontal stabilizers and the vertical stabilizer, while the lower side has a single tail wheel. &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; stands on top of the plane's left wing to open the hatch to reach the cockpit.\nThe Rustler is seen with a gray body and black/white stripes on the lower surfaces of the main wings and the tail boom. The primary color is applied to the upper surfaces of the fuselage, wings and horizontal stabilizers, while the secondary color is applied to the end of the nose, the wing tips and the vertical stabilizer.\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;armed&lt;/a&gt; with a set of six built-in machine guns fixed into the wings.\nPerformance.\nVehicle.\nAs expected from a fighter plane, the Rustler has impressive speed in the air and is very maneuverable, making it one of the easiest planes to fly, and it is also the first one provided to the player during the course of the story. However, it has a relatively long take-off time compared to other propeller-planes of its size. Like other propeller planes, it will stall when the player attempts to fly it vertically. The plane is also incredibly susceptible to damage.\nThe Rustler is powered by a V12 engine similar to its real-life inspirations, and uses a low-pitched sound also used on the &lt;a href=\"Stuntplane\"&gt;Stuntplane&lt;/a&gt;.\nWeaponry.\nThe machine guns deal a moderate amount of damage, but they do not lock onto targets. Being coupled with the plane's impressive speed while in the air, this makes them difficult to use effectively. However, the Rustler can shoot down an AI-controlled &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt; in a dogfight with no problems, due to its maneuverability, speed, the machine guns' power and the guns' rate of fire."}

The front fascia is inspired by the one found on the .\nThe Ruston is distinguished by its boxy profile, yet with an aerodynamic design and largely dominated by details. The front features a large carbon intake with two painted ducts on either side, a plastic splitter at the bottom and a tow hook in the center. The car appears to have LED headlights placed on carbon-fiber housings, along with the turning signals below. The hood area is mostly flat in shape, with the fenders giving it a bulky profile and featuring lightweight mirror wings over these. The front also bears silver lettering in the center, displaying the vehicle's manufacturer.\nThe sides of the car are clearly denoted by inset formations running through most of the car's body, small side skirts with fins on the rear edges and slanted shapes around the cabin, which become seemingly flatter as they run towards the rear end. The inset formations have a carbon-fiber finish and run towards large rear intakes intended for the rear brakes/engine bay, while smaller inset strips run parallel to the upper edges and are connected to the rear wheel arches. The cabin area features a bolted-on strip with a small windshield attached on the front, while two black rollbars with a fuel hose on the driver side and a central intake can be seen behind the seats. Most of the rear section is also occupied by a black compartment with carbon-fiber panels.\nOn the rear end, the car has silver lettering in the center that displays the vehicle's manufacturer, and carbon-fiber housings with LED tail lights on either side, each one consisting of two red units and single turn signals with inner reverse units. Like the front end, a carbon-fiber section predominates most of the vehicle and houses a license plate, a tow hook and dual exhaust pipes in the center, while a large diffuser with dual blades is mounted on the lower portion. The underside of the car is mostly covered by various bolted-on, carbon-fiber panels, with the front one leaving small room for the front wheels' steering.\nThe Ruston features an interior predominated by race elements, where the central section has a carbon-fiber panel running from the dashboard to the rear compartment, while a digital speedometer is connected to the dashboard by two carbon-fiber frames. The doors are reinforced by cross bars on the inner side and feature bolted-on panels with pull straps on the upper side, while dual articulated hinges can be seen on the frames when the same doors are open. As expected from its racing design, lightweight seats with red seatbelts are fitted as standard.\nThe car is painted in a primary color for the body, the overstitches on the steering wheel and the details of the stock wheels, while the secondary color is applied on the rear diffuser and the inner portions of the cabin area. Although not accessible and not listed in the files, the vehicle's dashboard supports a trim color, which is always set to black. The wheels are similar to those from the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;, being a variation of the \"Cheetah R\" high-end rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, although they lack the bolt details around the center. The rims also support a dedicated color, although this is only possible in &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;, as naturally-generated examples always use the default alloy color.\nIf purchased through &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Motorsport\"&gt;Legendary Motorsport&lt;/a&gt;, the Ruston will be fitted with a stock wing that resembles the VUHL 05's stock spoiler; however, if spawned through other means, the wing will not be installed. The spoiler can be seen on the Legendary Motorsport gallery.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Ruston has a relatively quick acceleration and nippy handling around corners, with the chance of an oversteer relatively slim. Its durability against collisions is surprisingly strong for a lightweight sports car, making it a good choice for freemode. However, its lack of traction around corners renders it ineffective as a racing vehicle. Furthermore, the openness of the Ruston makes the player very exposed to gunfire due to not having any roof covers for protection.\nGiven the black compartment on the rear, the Ruston appears to have a rear-mid engine, rear wheel drive layout, with a 5-speed gearbox. Its engine configuration, however, is not indicated, as the compartment does not open and there is no engine model. Its engine sound is derived from the &lt;a href=\"Monroe\"&gt;Monroe&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bifta\"&gt;Bifta&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;."}

The shop is possibly a parody of and .\nDescription.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nRusty Brown's was first mentioned in an &lt;a href=\"Commercials%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;advertisement&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;radio stations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Flash%20FM\"&gt;Flash FM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fever%20105\"&gt;Fever 105&lt;/a&gt;. True to &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar's&lt;/a&gt; humor, people in the ad have very sexually suggestive opinions of their donuts (i.e. \"\"I like to lick lovingly around the outside and then thrust my tongue in the middle.\"; \"I just love the batter. All over my face.\"\"). Obviously, the commercial is all about oral sex, especially anilingus, given that \"Rusty Brown Ring\" is a slang for anus, then ATM (Ass to Mouth). Rusty Brown's is also mentioned on the police radio. ( \"Is there an officer at Rusty Brown's downtown? There must be.\")\n&lt;a href=\"Toni\"&gt;Toni&lt;/a&gt;, Flash FM's DJ, dedicates Wang Chung's \"Dance Hall Days\" to the shop. A Rusty's box appears on the desk in the flash version of the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.rockstargames.com/vicecity/\"&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt; of \"\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nRusty Brown's has no physical presence as a business outlet in \"\". However, examination of internal files suggests that the brand name was to be used for a &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;cut&lt;/a&gt; chain of donut stores around &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;CJ&lt;/a&gt; could eat donuts, but this was removed in the final version, rendering the interior of the restaurant inaccessible during normal gameplay. A possible reason is that the real-life Dunkin' Donuts (the chain Rusty Brown's is parodying) had no presence on the West Coast in the 1990s.\nA shared interior of the outlet, which is featured in cutscenes in early missions with &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt;, exists but is only accessible via the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Interiors%20Universe\"&gt;Hidden Interiors Universe&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, textures and models for donuts on trays (in a similar fashion as fast food trays for &lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Well%20Stacked%20Pizza%20Co.\"&gt;Well Stacked Pizza&lt;/a&gt;) also exist in internal files.\nSimilar donut shops, including &lt;a href=\"Jim%27s%20Sticky%20Ring\"&gt;Jim's Sticky Ring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tuff%20Nut%20Donuts\"&gt;Tuff Nut Donuts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"King%20Ring\"&gt;King Ring&lt;/a&gt; exist in the final version of the game's setting.\nSome &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Street%20Criminals\"&gt;street criminals&lt;/a&gt; can be heard saying \"I'm a Rusty Brown doughnut eating gangsta!\". Also, a &lt;a href=\"pedestrian\"&gt;pedestrian&lt;/a&gt; will sometimes comment \"Have you been to Rusty Brown's?\". Both of these quotes indicate that Rusty Brown's was to play a larger role in the game, and they might have been left in the game by accident.\nAdditionally, in &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20Fuhrberger\"&gt;Colonel Fuhrberger&lt;/a&gt;'s kitchen, there is a leaflet for Rusty Brown's Ring Donuts on the table, indicating that it could have been featured in the game. This can also be seen in the &lt;a href=\"Johnson%20House\"&gt;Johnson House&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nRusty Brown's appears in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" at a diner &lt;a href=\"Callahan%20Point\"&gt;Callahan Point&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; (circa &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;) where &lt;a href=\"Greasy%20Joe%27s\"&gt;Greasy Joe's&lt;/a&gt; would be in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" (set in &lt;a href=\"2000\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;, respectively). A &lt;a href=\"Police%20Car\"&gt;Police Car&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the parking lot.\nIt is also likely to be &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Bikers\"&gt;Liberty City Bikers&lt;/a&gt; turf, as referenced in a &lt;a href=\"Overdose%20of%20Trouble\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni&lt;/a&gt; has to find a cure for the overdosed &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Latore\"&gt;Maria Latore&lt;/a&gt;, who thinks she left the cure, which was called \"zap\", near there. They find no zap there, and they also find the enraged biker gang, because Toni and Maria were behind &lt;a href=\"Biker%20Heat\"&gt;the killing&lt;/a&gt; of their leader, &lt;a href=\"Cedric%20Fotheringay\"&gt;Cedric \"Wayne\" Fotheringay&lt;/a&gt;. The bikers then give chase to the pair.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe business is over &lt;a href=\"1958\"&gt;50 years old&lt;/a&gt;. It has expanded into the Internet, selling donuts online, and recently opened the franchise in East Asia. Its main site is at &lt;a href=\"Rustybrownsringdonuts.com\"&gt;www.rustybrownsringdonuts.com&lt;/a&gt;. Rusty Brown's has a theme for the &lt;a href=\"cell%20phone\"&gt;cell phone&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Vipluxuryringtones.com\"&gt;www.vipluxuryringtones.com&lt;/a&gt;. The company proudly sponsors the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey are also one of the official sponsors of the &lt;a href=\"CNT\"&gt;CNT&lt;/a&gt; program &lt;a href=\"I%27m%20Rich\"&gt;I'm Rich&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn Chinatown Wars, each &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Stunt%20Jumps\"&gt;Unique Stunt Jump&lt;/a&gt; involves crashing your car through a Rusty Brown's billboard. There are 30 spread throughout &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nA Rusty Brown's outlet is located on &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Boulevard\"&gt;Vespucci Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; just around the corner from the &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Row%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Mission Row Police Station&lt;/a&gt; and next to the &lt;a href=\"Ground%20%26amp%3B%20Pound%20Caf%C3%A9\"&gt;Ground &amp; Pound Caf\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, (reinforcing a police stereotype of coffee and donuts). In the first &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Trailers\"&gt;trailer&lt;/a&gt;, the location had signage textures indicating it was the &lt;a href=\"Glory%20Hole%20Theme%20Park\"&gt;Glory Holes Bakery&lt;/a&gt;.\nRusty Brown's advertises the new Red Ring of Death donut on their &lt;a href=\"Bleeter\"&gt;Bleeter&lt;/a&gt;. Many Rusty Brown's Ring Donuts ads can be found throughout &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally a sign for Rusty Brown's Ring Donuts (as well as an &lt;a href=\"Up-n-Atom%20Burger\"&gt;Up-n-Atom sign and store&lt;/a&gt;) can be found across the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Boulevard%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;street&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Bishop%27s%20WTF%3F%21\"&gt;Bishop's WTF?!&lt;/a&gt;.

While identical in design, it has rusty spots, patches and damage across the bodywork and rusty front bumper and side steps, in the same manner as many &lt;a href=\"beaters\"&gt;beaters&lt;/a&gt;. The interior is in a very beater condition similar to the &lt;a href=\"Rat-Loader\"&gt;Rat-Loader&lt;/a&gt;, with torn dash material and stains across the interior, and dirty door paneling, seats and steering wheel. It is also fitted with a CB radio, and occasional trucker chatter can be heard regardless of whether the main radio is turned on or off. The chatter will only play if playing as &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike the regular Rebel, this variant has access to rally/off-road modifications, which include assorted bullbars, extended wheel arches, and a variety of bed options including covers and roll bars. It is even possible to install a reinforced spaceframe that replaces remove most of the vehicle's bodywork and includes rallying equipment such as spare wheels, tool kits and additional fog lamps. With the space frame installed, the Rebel's quarter panels, bed floor and sides and tail lights are all removed, leaving the cab and front end intact (reinforced with additional framework), and rearranged suspension setup. The Rusty Rebel may also spawn with the same roll bar options as its clean version.\nThe general bodywork is painted with the primary colour, while the \"REBEL 4x4\" markings are permanently white, no longer assigning a secondary colour. The truck appears with the same eight spoke wheels wrapped in high-profile off-road tyres, albeit with a rusty condition on the rims.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe truck shares a similar performance with the regular Rebel, being a nimble and fast vehicle with good traction for off-road environments. However, it seems to have delayed ignition due to its rusty condition, similar to most beaters.\nThe truck is powered by the same V8 engine as its clean counterpart, and retains the same 5-speed gearbox and AWD layout (with a 30% front, 70% rear torque distribution). Unlike the clean version, the Rusty Rebel has a petrol engine sound that is much smoother, and valve/injection timing is more consistent, being similar to the &lt;a href=\"Rat-Loader\"&gt;Rat-Loader&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Duneloader\"&gt;Duneloader&lt;/a&gt; (enhanced version)."}

Ryder was expelled from high school for assaulting a teacher who was wearing &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; colors, although Ryder claims he was 'too intelligent' for school. It is also revealed that Ryder has been a drug dealer since the age of ten.\nAt an unknown point in time, Ryder joined the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt; street gang, eventually rising through the ranks of the gang until becoming one of Sweet's closest allies, being helped by the departure of &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1987\"&gt;1987&lt;/a&gt; following his &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Johnson\"&gt;brother's&lt;/a&gt; death. The Grove Street Families, however, began to lose influence, power and &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; to their arch rivals, the Ballas, due to their stance against the sale of drugs, which was fueling the Ballas rise to prominence.\n&lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt; attempted to convince Sweet about the benefits of selling drugs but failed, later meeting Ryder in his &lt;a href=\"Ryder%27s%20House\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; where he convinces him to join his newly formed alliance with the Ballas. The alliance is later expanded to include the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt;, while another was established with the &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Syndicate\"&gt;Loco Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;, who began supplying the new alliance with drugs from their base in &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, although they do not realise that an &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno\"&gt;undercover government agent&lt;/a&gt; is involved in the operation.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nCarl Johnson's Return.\nThe death of &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Johnson\"&gt;Beverly Johnson&lt;/a&gt; brings her son, Carl Johnson, back to Los Santos from &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. Johnson meets Ryder again shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20%26amp%3B%20Kendl\"&gt;funeral&lt;/a&gt; where they are attacked by a group of Ballas in a &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by shooting&lt;/a&gt;, destroying Smoke's &lt;a href=\"Perennial\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt;. Carl, Sweet, Smoke and Ryder flee the area on &lt;a href=\"BMX%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;BMX bicycles&lt;/a&gt;. The four cycle to &lt;a href=\"Mulholland%20Intersection\"&gt;Mulholland Intersection&lt;/a&gt; where Sweet breaks away from the group, distracting the Ballas vehicle, allowing Carl, Smoke and Ryder to escape. The three are briefly followed again by a Ballas &lt;a href=\"Voodoo%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt;, although the Ballas do not aim their guns at Smoke and Ryder due to their clandestine alliance, a fact missed by the Johnson brothers. Smoke also refuses to shoot at a Ballas car performing a &lt;a href=\"Drive-Thru\"&gt;drive-by shooting&lt;/a&gt;, claiming he did not wish to waste the food they had just ordered, although Ryder does start shooting at the Ballas.\nRyder continues his life as normal with the Grove Street Families, often being seen with Sweet and Carl. He begins to hire Carl to do various tasks, the first being to drive to &lt;a href=\"The%20Well%20Stacked%20Pizza%20Co.\"&gt;The Well Stacked Pizza Co.&lt;/a&gt; fast-food restaurant in &lt;a href=\"Idlewood\"&gt;Idlewood&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Ryder%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Ryder attempted to rob the store&lt;/a&gt; but was thwarted by the manager, using a &lt;a href=\"shotgun\"&gt;shotgun&lt;/a&gt; in self-defense. Ryder later assists Carl to &lt;a href=\"Cleaning%20the%20Hood\"&gt;kill a drug dealer&lt;/a&gt; and then a number of Ballas gangsters who were associated with the dealer in a &lt;a href=\"Crack%20Den\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; in Idlewood. Ryder also hires Carl to help him &lt;a href=\"Home%20Invasion\"&gt;steal weapons&lt;/a&gt; from the home of &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20Fuhrberger\"&gt;Colonel Fuhrberger&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"East%20Beach\"&gt;East Beach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Catalyst\"&gt;steal a weapons shipment&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"Brown%20Streak%20Railroad\"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt; coming from &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href=\"Robbing%20Uncle%20Sam\"&gt;steal weapons&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20National%20Guard%20Depot\"&gt;National Guard Depot&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Docks\"&gt;Ocean Docks&lt;/a&gt;.\nRyder later accompanies Carl, Sweet and Smoke to the &lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell&lt;/a&gt; fast-food restaurant in &lt;a href=\"Willowfield\"&gt;Willowfield&lt;/a&gt;, where they see a group Ballas attempt a drive-by shooting. The four survive and destroy the Ballas car. Ryder is again seen when the four &lt;a href=\"Nines%20and%20AK%27s\"&gt;discuss the gang's weapons&lt;/a&gt; and later performs a number of drive-by shootings with the three in &lt;a href=\"East%20Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;East Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jefferson%2C%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Jefferson&lt;/a&gt;. He also attended a &lt;a href=\"House%20Party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; thrown by &lt;a href=\"OG%20Loc\"&gt;OG Loc&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt;.\nSweet later arranges a &lt;a href=\"Reuniting%20the%20Families\"&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Jefferson%20Motel\"&gt;Jefferson Motel&lt;/a&gt; between the various subdivisions of the Grove Street Families, in an attempt to bring the factions back together to fight against the Ballas.\nRyder, upon arriving with Sweet, Carl and Smoke, criticises the non-Grove Street gangsters, which Carl and Sweet do not realize is an attack on the gang rather than the subdivisions. Sweet enters the motel on his own and, when the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Police Department&lt;/a&gt; ambush the meeting, Ryder and Smoke flee the scene in Sweet's &lt;a href=\"Greenwood%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Greenwood&lt;/a&gt;. The two, however, later reappear at the side of the motel and escape with Carl and Sweet from the pursuing police, driving the car through a &lt;a href=\"Sprunk\"&gt;Sprunk&lt;/a&gt; billboard. The car explodes upon landing on the road below while the four, who had bailed out of the car, decide to go back home seperately.\nBetrayal.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Johnson\"&gt;Sweet&lt;/a&gt; explains to CJ that he is going to go to the &lt;a href=\"Mulholland%20Intersection\"&gt;Mulholland Intersection&lt;/a&gt; to ambush some &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; members, &lt;a href=\"Cesar%20Vialpando\"&gt;Cesar Vialpando&lt;/a&gt;, the boyfriend of Sweet and Carl's sister &lt;a href=\"Kendl%20Johnson\"&gt;Kendl&lt;/a&gt; and also a friend of Carl's, phones Carl and tells him that he must urgently come to an alleyway in &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Bluffs\"&gt;Verdant Bluffs&lt;/a&gt;. Carl meets Cesar in the alleyway, where the duo witness Smoke and Ryder, along with &lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt; officers &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Pulaski\"&gt;Eddie Pulaski&lt;/a&gt;, and also some more Ballas members with the &lt;a href=\"Sabre%23.22The%20Green%20Sabre.22\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; used in the killing of Carl's mother. Deeply shocked, Carl finally realises the true colours of Smoke and Ryder and how they are complicit in his &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Johnson\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"The%20Introduction\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, but he is unable to confront the alliance between the game's three antagonistic groups (&lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt;/Ryder) and is forced to go to &lt;a href=\"Mulholland%20Intersection\"&gt;Mulholland Intersection&lt;/a&gt; to save his brother from a Ballas ambush during a shootout. Sweet is injured during the shootout, but Carl continues fighting the Ballas. The police arrive and the duo are arrested, with Sweet taken to a prison hospital 'upstate' and Carl to &lt;a href=\"Angel%20Pine\"&gt;Angel Pine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whetstone\"&gt;Whetstone&lt;/a&gt; by Tenpenny, Pulaski and &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Hernandez\"&gt;Jimmy Hernandez&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the absence of both Sweet and Carl, Smoke and Ryder take control of the Grove Street Families and add them to their alliance. Tenpenny orders Carl to stay out of Los Santos or else Sweet will be put in danger. With both their leaders out of Los Santos, the Grove Street Families turf is taken over by the Ballas, with Families members now working for Smoke and Ryder by taking drug shipments from the &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Syndicate\"&gt;Loco Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Syndicate%20Crack%20Factory\"&gt;drug manufacturing plant&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Doherty\"&gt;Doherty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; back to Los Santos. Cesar Vialpando, however, later discovers this and informs Carl, who stops a number of the shipments from reaching Los Santos. Carl later moves to San Fierro, but with Cesar's help, later photographs Ryder and the other Loco Syndicate members doing business in the mission &lt;a href=\"Photo%20Opportunity\"&gt;Photo Opportunity&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath.\nAfter obtaining the photographs, Carl returns to San Fierro and has them developed. He meets with &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Zi%20Mu\"&gt;Wu Zi Mu&lt;/a&gt;, a leading member of the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Triads\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt; in San Fierro and his &lt;a href=\"Triad%20Assistant%201\"&gt;assistant&lt;/a&gt;, who identifies the three leaders as &lt;a href=\"Jizzy%20B.\"&gt;Jizzy B.&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"The%20Pleasure%20Domes%20Club\"&gt;nightclub owner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"T-Bone%20Mendez\"&gt;T-Bone Mendez&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Rifa\"&gt;San Fierro Rifa&lt;/a&gt;, and the gang's &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno\"&gt;leader&lt;/a&gt;, although they are unaware that he is an undercover government agent.\nIn the mission &lt;a href=\"Pier%2069%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Pier 69&lt;/a&gt;, Ryder and Mendez are in a deal\u2014after using Wu Zi Mu's Triad army to help subdue the gangs, Cesar and Carl kill Mendez. Ryder will then attempt to flee in a boat; Carl kills him by either sniping him whilst he swims to it, or by chasing and shooting him down whilst seaborne.\nFollowing Ryder's death, Cesar tells Carl that Ryder once tried to have sex with Kendl. Although Carl responded as a protective brother would, he still seemed to regret having to kill his lifelong friend.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nRyder is depicted as loud, wild, and unpredictable. He is known to go into rampages and always attempt the impossible. Ryder has a peerless mean streak and an extremely short temper, making him the loose cannon of the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt;. He also has delusions of grandeur and a possible , stemming from his short stature. He sees himself as a \"genius\" and thinks he is too intelligent for school. Furthermore, Ryder is also very brusque, as he rudely states his terse opinions of CJ since the latter's return to Los Santos and has the tendency to belittle him. Though Ryder is very passionate of the Grove Street Families, he is also easily convinced by Big Smoke to make a little cash despite the fact that it means turning on his own gang. Ryder's impulsive and wild attitude is possibly due to his drug addiction, for he is almost always seen holding a joint in each cutscene he appears in. Though his history is unknown, it is implied that he was once a rebellious and belligerent child due to CJ saying in the mission &lt;a href=\"Robbing%20Uncle%20Sam\"&gt;Robbing Uncle Sam&lt;/a&gt; that he once beat up a teacher just for wearing purple, which is a color used by the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite turning on his own gang and CJ, in the whole series of events, including the deadly hunt on him by CJ, Ryder never shows any attempt to kill or harm CJ, even when the latter finally kills him in the mission Pier 69. During the aforementioned mission, he can be seen wielding an &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Rifle\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt; before the meet with T-Bone, although he never attempts to fight against CJ during the mission. \nHe commonly says \"/\", which is a term commonly used by his voice actor &lt;a href=\"MC%20Eiht\"&gt;MC Eiht&lt;/a&gt; instead of saying \"yeah\".\nAppearance.\nRyder has short, dark, bushy hair and a mustache. He wears a black cap that reads \"San Andreas\" and black sunglasses. Moreover, he wears a dark green jacket, similar to the Grn (Green) Windbreaker from &lt;a href=\"Sub%20Urban\"&gt;Sub Urban&lt;/a&gt;. He also has blue jeans with black and white sneakers.\nVehicle.\nRyder owns a brown &lt;a href=\"Picador\"&gt;Picador&lt;/a&gt; with a number plate which spells out \"SHERM\", referring to his addiction to sherm (as Carl also calls him a \"sherm head\" in &lt;a href=\"Photo%20Opportunity\"&gt;Photo Opportunity&lt;/a&gt;), a cigarette with marijuana mixed into the tobacco that has been immersed in PCP. In many &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Content\"&gt;pre-release&lt;/a&gt; screenshots, Ryder's vehicle was a brown &lt;a href=\"Sadler\"&gt;Sadler&lt;/a&gt;.\nDevelopment.\nIn the beta stage(s) of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", Ryder's appearance was different, much like that of CJ, Sweet, and Big Smoke. Originally, he wore no hat and no glasses. Instead of curly, bushy hair, he had cornrows. He wore a black hoodie with the same pants as in the final version, but wore black sneakers similar to the Black Hi-Tops from Sub Urban. This iteration of Ryder's appearance may have resembled the rapper and music producer , before his final version resembled ."}

The middle section mounts a round turret that has a smaller hatch on top.\nThe rear end of the vehicle assumes a similar shape to the sides, featuring another unusable hitch on the lower center and access steps on the passenger side, while the upper area mounts a bulky exhaust vent on the driver side and circular tail lights on the oter edges, consisting of upper red units and lower reverse units. The underside of the vehicle is rather basic, having the corresponding axles and diffs.\nThe interior of the vehicle lacks a dedicated dashboard, steering wheel and seat, thus the character simply floats inside the vehicle. In addition, the seats are located far behind the windshield area. The vehicle also features a wailing siren but lacks light bars to complement it, like the &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle is only available in a navy blue color with &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas Police Department&lt;/a&gt; markings around, and can spawn either unmarked or with an identification number on the front-left, rear-left side of the roof near the turret and rear quarters (which are: 1, 6, 7 and 9). It also uses a set of industrial wheels with navy blue rims.\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with a small water cannon turret, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Firetruck%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\nVehicle.\nThe S.W.A.T. is a very capable vehicle, with excellent top speed and grip, but suffering from understeer and poor acceleration up inclines (thanks to its heavy weight). On road, the vehicle handles acceptably well for such an armored vehicle, and the same goes for off road. Thanks to its large wheels and 4WD powertrain, it is capable of scaling moderately steep hills. However, its suspension is obviously geared for more urban environments, as although being soft, it has very little travel, and the wheels gain camber angle as they extend downward. These traits make well for crossing small bumps like curbs, and keeping the vehicle stable in corners by managing body roll, however, they make the vehicle noticeable bouncy off-road, compared to more capable vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rancher\"&gt;Rancher&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe S.W.A.T., like any police vehicle, can be used to initiate the &lt;a href=\"Vigilante\"&gt;Vigilante&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Missions\"&gt;vehicle mission&lt;/a&gt;. However, since &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; cannot perform a drive-by in the S.W.A.T., it is not recommended to try to do so. Out of all police vehicles in the game, the S.W.A.T. is one of the least favorable choices for this mission, being rather slow and poor in turning. However, the water cannon may be used to subdue attacking criminals for a ramming attack, and its heavy weight can be used as a weapon to inflict damage on any vehicle in its path, as its shovel-shaped front easily pushes cars harshly with minuscule damage done to the APC.\nThe S.W.A.T. uses a diesel engine and a 5-speed gearbox to power all wheels. It shares the same engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor.\nThe vehicle is more resistant to bullets than the average car, akin to the cut &lt;a href=\"FBI%20Truck\"&gt;FBI Truck&lt;/a&gt;, however is no more resistant to crashing and damage than said car. The one from the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;last mission&lt;/a&gt;, however, appears with bulletproof and fireproof capabilities, so for an entirely unmodded game, the S.W.A.T. can be considered bulletproof.\nFeatures.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Firetruck%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt;, the S.W.A.T. is equipped with a fully rotatable water cannon similar to the one on the Fire Truck, having quick traverse and elevation capabilities. As with the Fire Truck, the water cannon cannot harm &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt; but they can be knocked down, as well as used to putting out fires. It should be noted that attempting to spray the water cannon from the front or the back will collide the water stream with the S.W.A.T itself, meaning that the player should aim upward or to the sides when using the cannon.\nLocations.\nThe S.W.A.T. is considerably rare, appearing only twice during the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;last mission&lt;/a&gt;, only one of which can be stored in a garage:"}

The headlights and grille dimensions seem to be inspired by the . The spoiler seems to be similar to the one found on the , but with mounts similar to the ones from the 787B.\nDesign.\nThe S80RR shares many design traits with the &lt;a href=\"RE-7B\"&gt;RE-7B&lt;/a&gt;, being the low profile and aerodynamic styling, but depicted with older features in comparison. The front of the car features a sloped profile with a squared-off bottom, having small intakes and ducts on the centre and near the cabin. Four circular headlamps, enclosed in glass casings with black fittings, can be seen on the outer edges. The front serves as an openable compartment that hinges from the front, and opens forward to reveal the front suspension setup and a radiator/intercooler.\nThe sides feature rounded front arches with square-shaped mirror shells, vertical intakes on the lower areas and side-exit exhausts near the rear arches. The cabin area is relatively rounded and narrower, featuring black surroundings on the windows and gull-wing doors. The rear area acts as the engine compartment, which hinges from behind the cabin and opens forward to reveal the engine bay, protective frames and rear suspension setup.\nThe rear area features circular tail lamps and thin vents, while the centre is occupied by a rear structure holding the race spoiler, and two rectangular reverse lights can be seen besides it. The entire underside of the vehicle is mostly plated in carbon fibre, featuring elevated sections running towards the rear end, while the front suspension arms are exposed.\nThe interior appears to reflect its classic design. While similar to the race interior from the RE-7B in terms of features, the S80RR employs two analog dials over the steering column (though the steering wheel contains paddle shifters rather than a traditional H-shifter), with various rearranges for the curved dashboard. What is also unique about the S80RR is having only one seat, and the seat and wheel are located in the centre, unlike many other cars that are usually located on the left side.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork and the stitching on the steering wheel, while the secondary colour is applied on the roll cage, chassis, engine covering and suspension springs. Similar to vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"ETR1\"&gt;ETR1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"RE-7B\"&gt;RE-7B&lt;/a&gt;, the S80RR features racing slicks with custom markings for the stock wheels, with the rims being similar to the \"Dash VIP\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, albeit omitting the details between the bolts and featuring a yellowish colour.\nPerformance.\nThe S80RR's acceleration is surprisingly good for a rear-wheel-drive vehicle. Top speed is comparable with most super-class cars. The handling is almost one of a kind compared to other cars, with the ability to steer very sharply, and easily regain control if the car begins to powerslide. The car does not suffer much from instability when going over uneven roads thanks to its weight and downforce. Highly recommended with races that feature many sharp turns.\nThe S80RR has one (the eleventh) Advanced Flag enabled, which prevents the vehicle from being slammed/stanced by shooting the wheels. After the update, it also forces the tire clipping boundaries on the vehicles' stock wheels when applying different wheel options with a bigger sidewall, thus preventing better bump-absorption when using Offroad wheels.\nThe vehicle is powered by a single-cam V8 engine, coupled to a 6-speed gearbox and powering the rear wheels. The engine sound is similar to the one on the RE-7B."}

The bonnet area has a distinctive curved line on the front, running towards either side of the windscreen, along with an impressed area in the centre that bears the Karin logo on the end.\nThe sides of the car are denoted by the distinctive body lines through the whole body, particularly the ones around the wheel arches, skirting area, greenhouse and rear portion. The front fenders have sectioned panels with narrow exit vents, while the doors have painted handles and painted mirror shells. The greenhouse area makes use of black trim around the windows and small separations for the rear-quarter windows, while the roof panel has two pieces of black trim on either side and a wide impressed area in the centre. The rear area has a small boot lid and mounts a small carbon-fibre spoiler by default, with painted supports and fins.\nThe rear of the car bears the Karin logo and the number plate on the boot lid, while a set of tail lights can be seen on the outer edges, consisting of red units split between the upper main lights and the lower brake lights, and inner circular reverse lights with carbon-fibre sections beside them. The rear bumper is relatively simple and bears a black/plastic detail on the lowermost edge, while the bottom area is finished in black and has two mouldings for the exhaust tips and a modern third-brake light in the centre.

It uses a set of rims similar to the \"Mercie\" Sport rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe car is powered by what seems to be a Flat-4/Boxer engine similar to its real-life inspiration, coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive configuration. Its engine sound is similar to cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Monroe\"&gt;Monroe&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bifta\"&gt;Bifta&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;."}

In addition, both games manage to take advantage of the PSP's network support to include &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer%20in%20GTA%20Liberty%20City%20Stories\"&gt;multiplayer modes&lt;/a&gt;, a feature which is absent in the PS2 port. Both \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\" have been huge successes in terms of the number of sales in comparison to other PSP games.\n has also been ported to the system in late 2009.\nIn 2014, the last versions of PSP (except the latest PSP E1000 and PS Vita) were discontinued."}

Playa del Seville is a multi-racial community, with African-Americans making up the majority of the population.\nThe area contains a set of housing projects, a beach, a nearby busy road, a set of lock-up garages, a basketball court, a small street with some small single-family homes and a few small businesses and stores. Despite the ominous gang activity, the area is more middle-class than Ganton and the beach is a popular tourist destination.\nInfluence.\nBecause of its beach location, its proximity to the docks, and predominantly being a residential district, Playa del Seville is primarily based on the and neighborhoods of Los Angeles. However, the &lt;a href=\"Seville%20Boulevard%20Flats\"&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; buildings of Playa del Seville are reused from the &lt;a href=\"Ganton%20Courts\"&gt;Ganton Courts&lt;/a&gt; which are based on the in .\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nPlaya del Seville does not feature much in \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".

It is hosted by &lt;a href=\"Forth%20Right%20MC\"&gt;Forth Right MC&lt;/a&gt; (voiced by &lt;a href=\"Chuck%20D.\"&gt;Chuck D.&lt;/a&gt;).\nDescription.\nPlayback's playlist consists of late 1980s rap by East Coast artists, in contrast to &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Radio Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, whose playlist is predominantly early 1990s rap by West Coast acts.\nPlayback assumes a more retro and nostalgic nature, even though the oldest songs on the playlist were released only five years before the events of the game. Its idents scold listeners because \"while they were going on with the 1980s pop style, these rappers were inventing hip hop\". They also claim that if listeners want to \"be learned on the history of hip hop\", they must listen to this station. Playback also makes nostalgic comments such as that this kind of music \"was the reason [its listeners] put that subwoofer in the car\", and so the station could also represent &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt;' homage to the early hip hop era.\nIts DJ, Fort Right MC, is, as the idents boast, \"the mouthiest man in hip-hop\". He is a very opinionated guy who rants about politics, TV shows, women, science fiction, \"nerd stuff\" and aliens. He believes East Coast rap is superior to its West Coast counterpart. He also hates the people living on the West Coast and says he wants another earthquake to hit San Andreas. His presenting style is unpopular, as the majority of his callers want him to play the records instead of listening to his ramblings. Radio Los Santos host &lt;a href=\"Julio%20G\"&gt;Julio G&lt;/a&gt; agrees with this view, as he says that the songs on Playback are \"great\" but that \"its DJ is whack\".\nPlayback FM is the favorite station of the &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Varrios Los Aztecas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe soundtrack to this station was released together with &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Radio Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; as part of the 8-CD \"\"."}

He was once very book smart as a child (in later years he would refrain from this positive work ethic) when he was eight or nine, he became close to the neighborhood's biggest drug lord, &lt;a href=\"Dwayne%20Forge\"&gt;Dwayne Forge&lt;/a&gt;, who treated Stewart like a son and taught him how to sell drugs. Dwayne states that Playboy was always a bright kid, but he had no street knowledge, so Dwayne taught him the rules of the game. When Dwayne was arrested, Stewart became the head of Dwayne's business interests. Playboy X was previously a small-time dealer, also robbing people for some time before taking over the cocaine empire and bringing it to new heights.\nLeadership of the business.\nUnder Playboy's leadership and rejecting Dwayne's old-fashioned views, the empire went from being exclusively about drugs to expanding into other realms of (even legitimate) business. Still having the most success in drug sales, he became friends with &lt;a href=\"Elizabeta%20Torres\"&gt;Elizabeta Torres&lt;/a&gt; and monitored all drug deals in the city. After 2004, he stopped visiting Dwayne in prison, and being at a selfish point in his life, probably bought his yellow &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt; within a year or two of that date.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nEventually in &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, Playboy X was introduced to &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Blow%20Your%20Cover\"&gt;a heroin deal&lt;/a&gt; and the two began a business relationship. Playboy X also makes a brief appearance in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\" where Playboy refuses to meet &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt; during the party.\nExpanding into other businesses, Playboy even dreamed of leaving crime behind entirely to become a legitimate real estate developer and \"see my name in big, gold letters!\". He also explains his resolve to give money to poor young blacks and schools after he's wealthy to atone for selling drugs to children (although his penthouse and luxury car insinuate that he's already quite wealthy). He sought to win over &lt;a href=\"Yusuf%20Amir\"&gt;Yusuf Amir&lt;/a&gt;, a billionaire property developer from Dubai. Amir was under intense pressure to cooperate with the Mafia, who had shut down his construction site under the guise of a union strike in order to extort funds from him. X believed he could maneuver himself into Amir's favor by employing Niko to dispatch the mob gunmen besieging the site. Niko vacated the site in Playboy X's mission \"&lt;a href=\"Deconstruction%20for%20Beginners\"&gt;Deconstruction for Beginners&lt;/a&gt;\", but Amir was unresponsive. Instead of rewarding X with shares in lucrative construction contracts, he permanently closed down the construction site in memory of those who had died. It is revealed in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\" mission \"&lt;a href=\"For%20the%20Man%20Who%20Has%20Everything\"&gt;For the Man Who Has Everything&lt;/a&gt;\" that Amir continued construction on the soon-to-be Amir Towers.\nLater, Niko was sent by X to &lt;a href=\"Photo%20Shoot\"&gt;exterminate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Marlon%20Bridges\"&gt;Marlon Bridges&lt;/a&gt;. X also gave him a &lt;a href=\"Whiz\"&gt;Whiz&lt;/a&gt; Wireless Cell handset to keep and so that X could assist Niko in the job, as it requires Niko to send an MMS which his second-hand Badger phone given to him by his cousin &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; is incapable of doing as it does not have a camera.\nDwayne's release from prison and The Holland Play.\nEventually, Dwayne is released from prison and tensions rise between him and X almost immediately. Playboy ignores Forge and attempts to distance himself from his former mentor, leaving Forge feeling bitter, heartbroken and betrayed. Playboy is still the Boss of the &lt;a href=\"North%20Holland%20Hustlers\"&gt;North Holland Hustlers&lt;/a&gt;, as eventually Forge retakes his former base of operations, the &lt;a href=\"Triangle%20Club\"&gt;Triangle Club&lt;/a&gt;, from associates of Playboy's, the &lt;a href=\"Trunchez%20Brothers\"&gt;Trunchez Brothers&lt;/a&gt;. Playboy is furious and it is clear that the bad blood between the former partners is going to come to a head.\nPlayboy X has a private conversation with Niko, claiming that Forge is talking behind his back and attempting to usurp leadership from him, even though he claims he offered half of the business to Forge. Though apparently very saddened by having to kill his mentor, he offers &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko&lt;/a&gt; $25,000 to kill Dwayne. Subsequently, Niko is also hired by Dwayne to kill Playboy X after word hits the streets that there is a contract out on him.\nIf Niko chooses to kill Dwayne, Playboy has a change of heart, seemingly upset that his \"father figure\" was killed. Presumably in denial, he blames Niko's cold-heartedness for the betrayal and although he pays Niko the $25,000 as agreed and wishes him the best, he cuts all ties with Niko and claims that he cannot be friends with him knowing he killed Dwayne. Later, his answering machine even claims that \"you don't know what you got until it's gone.\"\nIf Niko chooses to kill Playboy, he shoots his way through Playboy's penthouse and corners him in an alleyway, easily executing him by shooting him in the throat, and thus, returning control of the North Holland Hustlers gang to Forge. As a token of his appreciation, Dwayne gives &lt;a href=\"Playboy%20X%27s%20Penthouse\"&gt;Playboy's penthouse&lt;/a&gt; (which he reveals he had the deed to all along) to Niko.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nPlayboy presents himself as an altruist who one day seeks to help the poor in his community. However, his actions and even his words prove that he is a materialistic hypocrite, as he states in his introductory mission: \"If a deal make paper, I do it.\" His missions consist solely of him chasing more wealth to seemingly do nothing with, while he touts that he is still the same young hustler from his youth, unchanged by money. Despite this, he heavily values connections and treats his peers as tools and means to an end rather than valued friends, as he treats &lt;a href=\"Elizabeta%20Torres\"&gt;Elizabeta&lt;/a&gt; as a mere business partner with a great deal of hookups, ignores Dwayne after the latter's imprisonment and resulting loss of usefulness to him, and discards Niko as a partner should the player kill Dwayne instead of him. Ironically, this last example is the only time when Playboy seems to value someone (or more accurately, their memory) for more than business connections. \nIn his youth, Playboy was quite book smart, although by the events of \"GTA IV\", this has clearly changed, as he claims Jesus Christ killed John the Baptist and that he and &lt;a href=\"Yusuf%20Amir\"&gt;Yusuf Amir&lt;/a&gt; might be cousins simply because he believes Dubai is in Africa, which Niko quickly refutes on both occasions only for Playboy to ignore him. He also appears rather cowardly, as he prefers to simply hear and oversee drug deals and other dangerous situations as opposed to actually taking part in them. This can be seen in all of the missions he appears in, as he hides and blind fires in the only &lt;a href=\"Blow%20Your%20Cover\"&gt;mission he is in a firefight&lt;/a&gt;, and has Niko do his dirty work in the other ones. If the player chooses to kill him, his cowardice can be seen even more prominently, as he quickly abandons his fellow gang members and even drops his weapon once cornered."}

The player's choice in &lt;a href=\"The%20Holland%20Play\"&gt;The Holland Play&lt;/a&gt; determines whether Playboy X remains in possession of the penthouse or whether &lt;a href=\"Dwayne%20Forge\"&gt;Dwayne&lt;/a&gt; relinquishes it to &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, henceforth becoming a safehouse.\nIf the player decides to kill Dwayne, the safehouse remains Playboy X's, but the player can still gain access by landing a helicopter on the roof or by climbing from a nearby alley - the patio doors are permanently open, although none of the features inside can be used. The player can also access the penthouse by parking an SUV or other high-roofed vehicle at the bottom of the fire stairs and climbing up them. The safehouse can also be entered using the same method in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\". The player can also park vehicles in the parking space; Playboy's yellow &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt; is also parked there.\nAround the same time this safehouse is acquired, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; buys &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park%20East%20Safehouse\"&gt;another one&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;. Together, the Algonquin safehouses are vastly superior to the &lt;a href=\"South%20Bohan%20Safehouse\"&gt;South Bohan Safehouse&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20Safehouse\"&gt;safehouse that follows&lt;/a&gt; in terms of their condition and facilities.\nAmenities.\nThe lavish penthouse is located on top of the Xenotime Street apartment building. It has a &lt;a href=\"Panoramic\"&gt;Panoramic&lt;/a&gt; wide screen television, jacuzzi, &lt;a href=\"pool\"&gt;pool&lt;/a&gt; table, punching bag, stereo speakers (Tuned to &lt;a href=\"The%20Beat%20102.7\"&gt;The Beat 102.7&lt;/a&gt;), and an &lt;a href=\"Claude%27s%20Outfit\"&gt;outfit&lt;/a&gt; based on the clothing style of &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;; the penthouse itself has no &lt;a href=\"Internet%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt;, but you can use the guard's computer downstairs, in the lobby - interestingly, the monitor bears the &lt;a href=\"Tw%40\"&gt;Tw@&lt;/a&gt; desktop when not in use. Niko can't play pool by himself, but can play against friends and dates. This pool table does incur quite a few unwanted glitches. Animations of characters setting up shots are often in incorrect directions and the balls often fall off the table when hit very hard towards corners. When the player picks up a &lt;a href=\"Friends%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;date&lt;/a&gt;, it won't be listed on the map, but the player can still walk through the door and take the elevator, regardless. The penthouse also includes photographs of a child Playboy X and Dwayne, evidence of the penthouse's previous owner and his associate.\nFrom the bedroom there is an open double-door which leads out onto a wood and stone-floored patio. There are deck chairs and a sunshade, a hot tub and a gas barbecue outside with an explosive gas canister. The player can exit the patio by going down the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Escape\"&gt;fire stairs&lt;/a&gt; at one side, or can jump across to the adjacent building and take the internal stairs straight to street level. A fall from the patio will &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; Niko.\nInfluence.\nThe building is based on 486 Saint Nicholas Avenue, New York, USA."}

However, as soon as he arrives and meets with Roman, he &lt;a href=\"The%20Cousins%20Bellic\"&gt;discovers&lt;/a&gt; that all of his cousin's stories were lies: in reality, Roman lives in &lt;a href=\"Broker%20Safehouse\"&gt;a heavily-cramped apartment&lt;/a&gt; and runs &lt;a href=\"Express%20Car%20Service\"&gt;a small taxi service&lt;/a&gt;. Niko begins working for Roman's company, soon meeting his girlfriend &lt;a href=\"Mallorie\"&gt;Mallorie&lt;/a&gt;, who &lt;a href=\"Three%27s%20a%20Crowd\"&gt;introduces&lt;/a&gt; him to her friend &lt;a href=\"Karen%20Daniels\"&gt;Michelle&lt;/a&gt;, whom he quickly &lt;a href=\"First%20Date%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;begins to date&lt;/a&gt;. Niko also discovers that Roman is heavily in debt and has problems with the loan sharks. He protects him on several occasions, eventually &lt;a href=\"Bleed%20Out\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dardan%20Petrela\"&gt;Dardan Petrela&lt;/a&gt;, the head of the &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Mob\"&gt;Albanian Mob&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;, after he and his associates attack Roman.\nContinuing working for Roman, Niko soon &lt;a href=\"Jamaican%20Heat\"&gt;meets&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Little%20Jacob\"&gt;Little Jacob&lt;/a&gt;, the underboss of the &lt;a href=\"Yardies\"&gt;Yardies&lt;/a&gt; and a good friend of Roman's, whom he helps in dealing with several rival drug dealers, with the pair soon becoming good friends; it is also Jacob that Niko obtains his first weapon from. Niko later meets &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Glebov\"&gt;Vladimir \"Vlad\" Glebov&lt;/a&gt;, Roman's Russian loan shark, who gives him several debt-collecting jobs to keep Roman from sinking into debt. In Vlad's &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20the%20Not%20So%20Terrible\"&gt;final mission&lt;/a&gt;, Niko is tasked with killing Vlad's associate &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Bytchkov\"&gt;Ivan Bytchkov&lt;/a&gt;, but he may choose to spare his life instead (being the first character in the game whose fate can be chosen).\nLater, Niko &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Vlad\"&gt;learns&lt;/a&gt; that Vlad had slept with Mallorie and &lt;a href=\"Executions\"&gt;executes&lt;/a&gt; him. Afterwards, he reveals to Roman his real quest in Liberty City: to find and kill the man who betrayed his old unit. Shortly after, Niko and Roman are &lt;a href=\"Crime%20and%20Punishment\"&gt;kidnapped&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Faustin\"&gt;Mikhail Faustin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt;, the leaders of the Russian Mafia in Broker and Vlad's superiors. Faustin is shown to be an absolute hothead, but is not bothered by Vlad's murder and ends up releasing the pair and employing Niko for several jobs. During his work for Faustin, Niko &lt;a href=\"Logging%20On\"&gt;is introduced&lt;/a&gt; by Roman to his friend &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Internet%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt;. He &lt;a href=\"Search%20and%20Delete\"&gt;performs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Easy%20as%20Can%20Be\"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Out%20of%20the%20Closet\"&gt;jobs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"No.%201\"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; Brucie, along with &lt;a href=\"Exotic%20Exports\"&gt;some car thefts&lt;/a&gt;, but eventually quits working for him, although the two remain good friends. \nMost of Niko's jobs for Faustin involve attacks against &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Petrovic\"&gt;Kenny Petrovic&lt;/a&gt;, Liberty City's most powerful mobster. After Petrovic threatens to retaliate, Niko later meets with Dimitri privately, who explains that he needs to kill Faustin to make amends with Petrovic. Out of options, Niko &lt;a href=\"The%20Master%20and%20the%20Molotov\"&gt;assassinates&lt;/a&gt; Faustin, after being promised to be paid for the hit by Dimitri. However, when Niko &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Revolution\"&gt;meets&lt;/a&gt; Dimitri at a warehouse to collect his money, Dimitri betrays Niko and sells him out to his friend and fellow Russian crime lord &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt;, Niko's former employer and the same man that he came to Liberty City to escape from. Niko escapes from the ambush with Little Jacob's help, but Dimitri's men soon &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Sorrow\"&gt;burn down&lt;/a&gt; both Roman's taxi service and apartment in retaliation.\nBohan-Algonquin.\nAfter losing everything, Niko and Roman move to &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;, temporarily being accomodated in &lt;a href=\"South%20Bohan%20Safehouse\"&gt;a small apartment&lt;/a&gt; which belongs to Mallorie's cousin. Niko begins working in Bohan, on the recommendation of Mallorie, for &lt;a href=\"Manny%20Escuela\"&gt;Manny Escuela&lt;/a&gt;, an ego-driven vigilante who's dedicated to clean up the streets of South Bohan, and &lt;a href=\"Elizabeta%20Torres\"&gt;Elizabeta Torres&lt;/a&gt;, a Puerto Rican drug baroness. Niko quickly takes a personal disliking towards Escuela, but working for Torres, he makes new criminal connections, including Irish gangster &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McReary\"&gt;Patrick McReary&lt;/a&gt;, after saving him during a &lt;a href=\"Luck%20of%20the%20Irish\"&gt;botched deal&lt;/a&gt;, and drug dealer &lt;a href=\"Playboy%20X\"&gt;Playboy X&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href=\"Blow%20Your%20Cover\"&gt;assisting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Buyer%27s%20Market\"&gt;him&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; vice-president &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt; on a botched heroin deal. Following this failed exchange, the bridges to &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; open, granting the player access to the district. \nNiko soon begins taking on jobs from Playboy, such as &lt;a href=\"Deconstruction%20for%20Beginners\"&gt;taking down&lt;/a&gt; a union site for his friend &lt;a href=\"Yusuf%20Amir\"&gt;Yusuf Amir&lt;/a&gt;. Playboy later introduces Niko to his mentor &lt;a href=\"Dwayne%20Forge\"&gt;Dwayne Forge&lt;/a&gt;, who was recently released from prison, whom he also &lt;a href=\"Ruff%20Rider\"&gt;works&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Undress%20to%20Kill\"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; and helps rebuild his life, quickly forming a bond with him over their tragic past. However, tensions between Playboy and Dwayne begin to rise, and both men eventually &lt;a href=\"The%20Holland%20Play\"&gt;ask&lt;/a&gt;Niko to kill each other, leaving him with two possible options: murder either Dwayne or Playboy. Should he kill Dwayne, Playboy pays him for the hit, before cutting all ties with him, regreting that he hired Niko to kill his mentor. Should he kill Playboy, Niko becomes good friends with Dwayne, who lets him stay in Playboy's &lt;a href=\"Playboy%20X%27s%20Penthouse\"&gt;penthouse&lt;/a&gt;, revealing that he had the deed to it all along. \nNiko receives an angry call from Elizabeta, who tells him that Little Jacob sold some of her cocaine to the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt;, and they had ripped both of them off. Niko successfully &lt;a href=\"The%20Snow%20Storm\"&gt;retrieves&lt;/a&gt; the drugs, but when he goes to give them to Jacob, he is surprised to find Michelle, who reveals herself as an undercover government agent actually named Karen, and brings him before her agency, known only by it's cover: &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper%20Company\"&gt;United Liberty Paper&lt;/a&gt;. Niko is entrapped into working for the agency and &lt;a href=\"Wrong%20is%20Right\"&gt;is tasked&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Portrait%20of%20a%20Killer\"&gt;with killing several known&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Paper%20Trail\"&gt;or suspected terrorists&lt;/a&gt;. In return, the agency clears his criminal record and promises to track down the traitor of his old squad. \nNiko later &lt;a href=\"Have%20a%20Heart\"&gt;visits&lt;/a&gt; Elizabeta one final time, who reveals that she is under investigation of the police and fears that she will be arrested soon, just as Manny and his cameraman, &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Hamilton\"&gt;Jay Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;, walk in and attempt to convince her to stop dealing drugs. In a drug-induced outburst, Elizabeta kills both of them, and then asks Niko to dispose of the bodies. Afterwards, Niko cuts all ties with Elizabeta, and it can be heard on the &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;radio&lt;/a&gt; later in the game that Elizabeta was eventually arrested and sentenced to &lt;a href=\"2308\"&gt;300 years&lt;/a&gt; in prison on multiple charges. \nAt one point, Roman suddenly disappears and Mallorie informs Niko that he has been &lt;a href=\"Roman%27s%20Holiday\"&gt;kidnapped&lt;/a&gt; by Dimitri's men. Niko is able to &lt;a href=\"Hostile%20Negotiation\"&gt;save&lt;/a&gt; his cousin, with his hatred for Dimitri only intensifying. Later, Roman's fortunes suddenly improve when the latter receives a large amount of money from an insurance claim he made on his destroyed business. Using the money, Roman buys himself and Niko an &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Park%20East%20Safehouse\"&gt;apartment&lt;/a&gt; in Algonquin, then restarts his taxi company.\nNiko soon begins working for the McReary family, as he is blackmailed into helping corrupt cop &lt;a href=\"Francis%20McReary\"&gt;Francis&lt;/a&gt; (whom he briefly met during his &lt;a href=\"Street%20Sweeper\"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; for Manny) by &lt;a href=\"Call%20and%20Collect\"&gt;killing several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Final%20Interview\"&gt;people who possess&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Holland%20Nights\"&gt;incriminating evidence&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lure%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;against him&lt;/a&gt;, and assists Patrick on &lt;a href=\"Harboring%20a%20Grudge\"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Waste%20Not%20Want%20Knots\"&gt;robberies&lt;/a&gt;, most notably &lt;a href=\"Three%20Leaf%20Clover\"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20Liberty\"&gt;Bank of Liberty&lt;/a&gt;. Following the robbery, the bridges to &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt; open, unlocking the entire city, and Niko works for the rest of the McReary brothers, namely &lt;a href=\"Derrick%20McReary\"&gt;Derrick&lt;/a&gt;, who took part in the heist and is a retired mobster, having recently returned from &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; (where he ran to hide from the mob) and employs Niko &lt;a href=\"Smackdown%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;to deal with&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Babysitting\"&gt;several problems&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tunnel%20of%20Death\"&gt;from his past&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gerald%20McReary\"&gt;Gerald&lt;/a&gt;, who planned the robbery and is the leader of the &lt;a href=\"McReary%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Irish Mob&lt;/a&gt;, employing Niko &lt;a href=\"Actions%20Speak%20Louder%20than%20Words\"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"I%20Need%20Your%20Clothes%2C%20Your%20Boots%2C%20and%20Your%20Motorcycle\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; the Albanian Mob to ruin the truce between them and the &lt;a href=\"Ancelotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Ancelotti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Pegorino Family&lt;/a&gt;'s behalf. During this time, Niko befriends Patrick and develops a relationship with his sister &lt;a href=\"Kate%20McReary\"&gt;Kate&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrancis soon learns that Derrick has returned from Ireland and, fearing that he might rat him out, hires Niko &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Brothers\"&gt;to assassinate him&lt;/a&gt;. However, Derrick then calls Niko to tell him that he suspects Francis is trying to kill him and asks him to protect him. This once again leaves Niko with two possible options: kill Francis or Derrick. Regardless, Niko then &lt;a href=\"Undertaker\"&gt;attends&lt;/a&gt; the funeral, fending off several Albanian mobsters who attack it in retaliation for Niko's attacks on them earlier, and either cuts all his ties with Derrick, or blackmails Francis into helping him escape from the police whenever he will need (which lasts only until the end of the storyline). He also learns from Patrick that Gerald was arrested shortly before the funeral.\nThrough Patrick, Niko also meets Italian mobster and Pegorino Family &lt;a href=\"caporegime\"&gt;caporegime&lt;/a&gt; Ray Boccino, who employs him to assist him with a major &lt;a href=\"Diamonds\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt; dealing scheme. First, Niko and several of Boccino's associates, led by &lt;a href=\"Luca%20Silvestri\"&gt;Luca Silvestri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taking%20In%20the%20Trash\"&gt;retrieve&lt;/a&gt; the diamonds from several trash bags, where they were hidden away by members of The Lost MC after &lt;a href=\"Diamonds%20in%20the%20Rough\"&gt;being&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Frosting%20on%20the%20Cake\"&gt;stolen&lt;/a&gt; from nightclub owner &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt;. However, Luca and his crew betray Boccino and plan to run away with the diamonds, forcing Niko &lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;to kill them in order to retrieve the diamonds&lt;/a&gt;. Niko then works with Johnny Klebitz &lt;a href=\"Museum%20Piece\"&gt;to attempt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Collector%27s%20Item\"&gt;to sell&lt;/a&gt; the diamonds to &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20Mob\"&gt;Jewish Mob&lt;/a&gt; representative &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Roth\"&gt;Isaac Roth&lt;/a&gt;, but they &lt;a href=\"Not%20So%20Fast\"&gt;are ambushed&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Lopez&lt;/a&gt;, who steals the diamonds, whilst Johnny escapes with the money in the chaos. Niko later informs Boccino of Johnny's betrayal, and he sends him to &lt;a href=\"No%20Way%20on%20the%20Subway\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; his best friend &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;Jim Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; in retaliation, as well as &lt;a href=\"Late%20Checkout\"&gt;Roth and his men&lt;/a&gt;, after they accuse Boccino of the ambush and threaten to retaliate.\nIn exchange for his work for him, Boccino helps Niko &lt;a href=\"Weekend%20at%20Florian%27s\"&gt;track down&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bernie%20Crane\"&gt;Florian Cravic&lt;/a&gt;, one of the two survivors of his old squad. Niko and Roman confront Florian, who changed his name to Bernie Crane and has become a homosexual, and discover that he is not the traitor, meaning that the one who betrayed the squad can only be the other known survivor: &lt;a href=\"Darko%20Brevic\"&gt;Darko Brevic&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlgonquin-Alderney.\nNiko begins helping Bernie with several favours, first &lt;a href=\"Hating%20the%20Haters\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Hater\"&gt;a man&lt;/a&gt; who has attacked him due to his homosexual nature. Afterwards, Niko learns that Bernie is in a secret relantionship with vice-mayor &lt;a href=\"Bryce%20Dawkins\"&gt;Bryce Dawkins&lt;/a&gt;, who is being blackmailed by several men. Niko &lt;a href=\"Union%20Drive\"&gt;accompanies Bernie to meet with the men&lt;/a&gt;, discovering that they are working for Dimitri, and manages to kill them. However, when Bernie later &lt;a href=\"Buoys%20Ahoy\"&gt;invites&lt;/a&gt; Niko to a peaceful boat ride, they are attacked by more of Dimitri's men, whom Niko also kills. Afterwards, the pair part ways, not before Bernie makes Niko a gift: Bryce's &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt;.\nNiko is also introduced to &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Gravelli\"&gt;Jon Gravelli&lt;/a&gt;, the eldery and dying Don of the &lt;a href=\"Gambetti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Gambetti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; - the most powerful of the five Italian Mafia families within &lt;a href=\"the%20Commission\"&gt;the Commission&lt;/a&gt; - by &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper%20contact\"&gt;United Liberty Paper contact&lt;/a&gt;. Niko performs several jobs for Gravelli, such as &lt;a href=\"Entourage\"&gt;protecting&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Jefferson\"&gt;politican&lt;/a&gt; from Dimitri's men, or &lt;a href=\"Liquidize%20the%20Assets\"&gt;destroying multiple drug vans&lt;/a&gt; belonging to the &lt;a href=\"Ancelotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Ancelotti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, which are guarded by Dimitri's men. Grateful, Gravelli promises to help the Paper track down Darko Brevic.\nRay Boccino later contacts Niko once again, offering him an &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20Safehouse\"&gt;apartment&lt;/a&gt; in Alderney and introducing him to his friend and associate &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Bell\"&gt;Phil Bell&lt;/a&gt;. Bell employs Niko for several jobs, such as &lt;a href=\"Truck%20Hustle\"&gt;stealing&lt;/a&gt; a truck full of &lt;a href=\"heroin\"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Catch%20the%20Wave\"&gt;helping him steal the remaining drugs&lt;/a&gt; of the Ancelotti Family from Dimitri's men, and later recommends him to his boss, &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Pegorino\"&gt;Jimmy Pegorino&lt;/a&gt;. Pegorino is concerned about the recent loss in power of his family and, eager to join the &lt;a href=\"The%20Commission\"&gt;Commission&lt;/a&gt;, employ Niko to &lt;a href=\"Pegorino%27s%20Pride\"&gt;assist him on a deal&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Pavano%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Pavano Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; that would hopefully allow him to achieve this goal. However, the Pavano end up double crossing Pegorino and attempt to kill him, but Niko is able to save him, and later is asked to &lt;a href=\"Payback%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;attack a major group of Pavanos as payback&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, Pegorino grows more paranoid and believes to be surrounded by rats, asking Niko to &lt;a href=\"Flatline\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; his bodyguard &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Corrado\"&gt;Anthony Corrado&lt;/a&gt;, who was revealed to be an &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; informant, and &lt;a href=\"Pest%20Control\"&gt;later Ray Boccino as well&lt;/a&gt;, whom he suspected of being an informant.\nAround the same time, Niko visits Gerald McReary in prison, who asks him to help Patrick kidnap &lt;a href=\"Gracie%20Ancelotti\"&gt;Gracie Ancelotti&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Ancelotti\"&gt;Giovanni Ancelotti&lt;/a&gt;, the Don of the Ancelotti Family, in order to later ransom her off for the diamonds, which Gerald learned came into the possession of the Ancelotti Family. Niko &lt;a href=\"I%27ll%20Take%20Her\"&gt;successfully kidnaps&lt;/a&gt; Gracie, and Patrick later sets up an exchange with the Ancelotti Family, who &lt;a href=\"Ladies%20Half%20Price\"&gt;send&lt;/a&gt; Tony Prince and his bodyguard Luis Lopez - who stole the diamonds during Niko's original exchange with the Jewish Mob - to save Gracie. &lt;a href=\"Diamonds%20Are%20a%20Girl%27s%20Best%20Friend\"&gt;The exchange goes well at first, until Ray Bulgarin arrives and orders his men to kill Niko and retrieve the diamonds&lt;/a&gt;. Whilst Tony and Luis flee with Gracie and Bulgarin escapes, Niko and Patrick kill Bulgarin's men, but one of them grabs the diamonds and throws them into a passing garbage truck, leading to them being permanently lost. Afterwards, Niko cuts all his ties with Gerald, who asks him to look after his family.\nEventually, United Liberty Paper track down Darko Brevic and bring him to the cargo bay of &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, informing Niko, before cutting all ties with him. Niko, accompanied by Roman, finds Darko and, after a tense confrontation, is given the choice of either killing him, which leads to Niko feeling \"empty\", or sparing and letting him run away, which will cause Niko to feel better.\nAfter all the completion of all these missions, the ending of the game commences.\nEnding.\n\"Main article: &lt;a href=\"Endings%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;Endings in GTA IV&lt;/a&gt;\""}

Where film stars and millionaires do their best to avoid the dealers and gangbangers.\nNow, it's the early 90s. Carl's got to go home. His mother has been murdered, his family has fallen apart and his childhood friends are all heading towards disaster.\nOn his return to the neighborhood, a couple of corrupt cops frame him for homicide. CJ is forced on a journey that takes him across the entire state of San Andreas, to save his family and to take control of the streets.\nStoryline.\nPrior Events.\n&lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; (\"CJ\") was born and raised in &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ganton\"&gt;Ganton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, sharing a &lt;a href=\"The%20Johnson%20House\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; with his mother &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Johnson\"&gt;Beverly&lt;/a&gt;, brothers &lt;a href=\"Sweet\"&gt;Sean&lt;/a&gt; (\"Sweet\") and &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Johnson\"&gt;Brian&lt;/a&gt; and sister &lt;a href=\"Kendl\"&gt;Kendl&lt;/a&gt;. Sweet, CJ and their friends, &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Melvin Harris&lt;/a&gt; (\"Big Smoke\") and &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Lance Wilson&lt;/a&gt; (\"Ryder\") joined the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt; gang as children, with Sweet working his way up the ranks to become the gang's leader, while Carl became the underboss and Big Smoke and Ryder became high-ranking lieutenants. The Grove Street Families gained power in Los Santos, fighting with the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt; for control of the streets.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1987\"&gt;1987&lt;/a&gt;, Brian Johnson died. The cause of his death was never revealed, though it is implied that Carl was present and did not attempt to help him. Sweet held Carl responsible for Brian's death, which led to Carl leaving Los Santos and moving to &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, where he started working as a car thief for &lt;a href=\"Joey%20Leone\"&gt;Joey Leone&lt;/a&gt;. The Grove Street Families began losing power, with their enemies strengthening due to the highly lucrative drugs trade in Los Santos, and eventually lost turf to Ballas and the Vagos. The gang maintained control of their remaining territories by splitting up into three factions: the original Grove Street Families (ruling Ganton), the Seville Boulevard Families (having control of &lt;a href=\"Playa%20del%20Seville\"&gt;Playa del Seville&lt;/a&gt;) and the Temple Drive Families (mainly establishing themselves in &lt;a href=\"Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Maria%20Beach\"&gt;Santa Maria Beach&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe return of CJ.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;, the Ballas planned to assassinate Sweet to deprive the Families of their leader and take over their territories. They used a &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre%20%28car%29\"&gt;Sabre&lt;/a&gt; to perform a &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by shooting&lt;/a&gt; on the Johnson House. However, instead of Sweet, the Ballas killed Beverly. Sweet phoned Carl to inform him of their mother's death, and Carl agreed to return to Los Santos for the funeral.\nCarl arrives at the airport and takes a taxi back to his mother's house. However, he is arrested en route by &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Pulaski\"&gt;Eddie Pulaski&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Hernandez\"&gt;Jimmy Hernandez&lt;/a&gt;, police officers from a corrupt &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; unit called &lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt;. They steal his belongings and threaten to frame him for the &lt;a href=\"The%20Introduction\"&gt;murder&lt;/a&gt; of another officer, &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20Pendelbury\"&gt;Ralph Pendelbury&lt;/a&gt;, unless he works for them whenever they summon him. After C.R.A.S.H. let him go, warning Carl that they will be watching him, he makes his way to his mother's house, where he reunites with Big Smoke. After he promises CJ that they will learn who killed his mother, the pair drive to the funeral, where Carl reunites with Sweet, Kendl and Ryder. Sweet is displeased with Carl's return, claiming that Carl \"ran away\". Kendl becomes annoyed with Sweet and walks off. Suddenly, the Ballas attempt a drive-by, destroying Smoke's car. After escaping the Ballas drive-by, CJ, Sweet, Smoke and Ryder race back to Grove Street. Seeing the state of the gang, Carl decides to stay and help get Grove Street back on its feet.\nCarl begins working with Sweet, Smoke, and Ryder to restore their gang in power. At first, he does small jobs, such as &lt;a href=\"Tagging%20Up%20Turf\"&gt;spraying enemy gang tags&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cleaning%20the%20Hood\"&gt;clearing the hood of crack dealers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nines%20and%20AK%27s\"&gt;buying weapons&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Emmet\"&gt;Emmet&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Drive-By\"&gt;performing drive-bys&lt;/a&gt; in Ballas territory. Eventually, he moves on to some bigger operations, such as stealing weapons for fellow gang members &lt;a href=\"Home%20Invasion\"&gt;from&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Catalyst\"&gt;various&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Robbing%20Uncle%20Sam\"&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt; across Los Santos alongside Ryder, and accompanying Big Smoke &lt;a href=\"Running%20Dog\"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wrong%20Side%20of%20the%20Tracks\"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Just%20Business\"&gt;deals&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, CJ also reunites with another friend and occasional gang member &lt;a href=\"OG%20Loc\"&gt;OG Loc&lt;/a&gt;, who was just released from prison and asks for his help in &lt;a href=\"OG%20Loc%20%28mission%29\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; his &lt;a href=\"Freddy%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;former cellmate&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, CJ helps OG Loc make a name of himself in the rapping industry by &lt;a href=\"Life%27s%20a%20Beach\"&gt;stealing some equipment from a beach party&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%27s%20Rhymes\"&gt;rhyme book&lt;/a&gt; of famous rapper &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg\"&gt;Madd Dogg&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Management%20Issues\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; Dogg's &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Crawford\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt;. While attending a &lt;a href=\"House%20Party\"&gt;house party&lt;/a&gt; hosted by OG Loc, several Ballas attack Grove Street, but CJ and Sweet are able to fend them off.\nLater, Sweet asks CJ to &lt;a href=\"Cesar%20Vialpando%20%28mission%29\"&gt;spy&lt;/a&gt; on Kendl's new boyfriend &lt;a href=\"Cesar%20Vialpando\"&gt;Cesar Vialpando&lt;/a&gt;, who is the leader of the Hispanic gang &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Varrios Los Aztecas&lt;/a&gt;, which displeases Sweet. Despite his initial prejudices, Carl discovers that Cesar is a good man and genuinely cares about Kendl. Later, CJ competes in &lt;a href=\"High%20Stakes%2C%20Low-Rider\"&gt;a car race&lt;/a&gt; against Cesar, after which the two men become good friends. At the same time, CJ is summoned by C.R.A.S.H., who force him to help them with their shady operations, such as &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Desire\"&gt;burning down a house occupied by the Vagos&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Imports\"&gt;interrupting a meeting&lt;/a&gt; between some Ballas and the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually, CJ successfully &lt;a href=\"Doberman\"&gt;takes over&lt;/a&gt; the Ballas territory of &lt;a href=\"Glen%20Park\"&gt;Glen Park&lt;/a&gt;, and kills a former Grove Street member who joined the Ballas named &lt;a href=\"Little%20Weasel\"&gt;Little Weasel&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after, Sweet informs Carl that several high-ranking Ballas will be attending Weasel's funeral, including &lt;a href=\"Kane\"&gt;Kane&lt;/a&gt;, and the brothers use this opportunity to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Sepulcros\"&gt;kill them&lt;/a&gt;, weakening their enemy. After CJ &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Warfare%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;takes over more territories for Grove Street from their rivals&lt;/a&gt;, Sweet decides to attempt to &lt;a href=\"Reuniting%20the%20Families\"&gt;reunite the three sets of the Families&lt;/a&gt;, with CJ, Big Smoke and Ryder's help. However, the meeting is ambushed by the police and the group barely manage to escape after a long chase.\nWith the Ballas severely weakened, Sweet decides it is time for Grove Street to regain control of Los Santos and plans to &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;ambush&lt;/a&gt; a major group of Ballas under the &lt;a href=\"Mulholland%20Intersection\"&gt;Mulholland Intersection&lt;/a&gt; to end the gang war. Before he can join his brother on the attack, however, CJ is called by Cesar, who asks to meet him in &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Bluffs\"&gt;Verdant Bluffs&lt;/a&gt;. There, Cesar reveals that he had been investigating the drive-by shooting that killed Beverly and learned it was meant for Sweet. Just then, the pair spot Big Smoke, Ryder, C.R.A.S.H. and some Ballas exiting a garage containing a green &lt;a href=\"Sabre\"&gt;Sabre&lt;/a&gt;, the same car used in the drive-by. This makes CJ realize that Big Smoke and Ryder have sold out Grove Street to the Ballas and have been working with C.R.A.S.H., as well as they were the ones who organized the drive-by, in an attempt to kill Sweet and wipe out the gang. CJ then also concludes that Sweet must be headed into a trap and goes to save him, only to find him severely injured. Sweet orders Carl to leave, but Carl refuses and kills several waves of Ballas. However, the police soon arrive and arrest both Sweet and Carl. Sweet is taken to a prison hospital, whilst Carl is driven by C.R.A.S.H. outside of Los Santos, to the small town of &lt;a href=\"Angel%20Pine\"&gt;Angel Pine&lt;/a&gt;, in the countryside area of &lt;a href=\"Whetstone\"&gt;Whetstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhetstone, Flint County, &amp; Red County.\nC.R.A.S.H. warns Carl not to return to Los Santos and try to kill Big Smoke, otherwise Sweet will suffer in prison. They continue blackmailing CJ into working for them and task him with &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;killing an informant&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; protection who is threatening to reveal their corruption to the authorities. After the job is done, Carl decides to start making money and calls Cesar, who advises him to meet with his cousin &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina.&lt;/a&gt; CJ &lt;a href=\"First%20Date%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;meets&lt;/a&gt; Catalina and the pair perform &lt;a href=\"Tanker%20Commander\"&gt;various&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Local%20Liquor%20Store\"&gt;small&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"Against%20All%20Odds\"&gt;-time&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Small%20Town%20Bank\"&gt;robberies&lt;/a&gt; together, during which they enter a short-lived relationship.\nCarl is soon summoned by Tenpenny for another job and is introduced to a hippie named &lt;a href=\"The%20Truth\"&gt;The Truth&lt;/a&gt;, Tenpenny's &lt;a href=\"Weed\"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt; supplier. Tenpenny asks CJ to assist The Truth in producing a large quantity of drugs which he will be needing in the near future. The Truth requests that Carl &lt;a href=\"Body%20Harvest\"&gt;steals&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Combine%20Harvester\"&gt;Combine Harvester&lt;/a&gt; from a farm and deliver it back to him, promising to call Carl when the weed Tenpenny requires is ready. Shortly after, Carl calls Cesar and insists that he leaves Los Santos with Kendl, as the Grove Street Families and Varrios Los Aztecas are both disbanded, and their territories taken over by the Ballas and Vagos. CJ &lt;a href=\"King%20in%20Exile\"&gt;meets&lt;/a&gt; with Cesar and Kendl and rents them a trailer home in Angel Pine until he finds a better place for all of them to stay.\nLater, Carl begins competing in car races to earn money and meets &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Zi%20Mu\"&gt;Wu Zi Mu&lt;/a&gt; (\"Woozie\"), the blind leader of the &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Cloud%20Boys\"&gt;Mountain Cloud Boys&lt;/a&gt; subsection of the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Triads\"&gt;San Fierro Triads&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Zi%20Mu%20%28mission%29\"&gt;one of the races&lt;/a&gt;. Carl also competes in &lt;a href=\"Farewell%2C%20My%20Love...\"&gt;a race&lt;/a&gt; against Catalina's new boyfriend &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt;, winning the deed to a &lt;a href=\"Doherty%20Garage\"&gt;garage&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Doherty, San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;. After parting ways with Catalina, who &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; for Liberty City with Claude, CJ &lt;a href=\"Are%20You%20Going%20to%20San%20Fierro%3F\"&gt;returns&lt;/a&gt; to The Truth, who informs him that the marijuana supply for Tenpenny is ready. However, the police finds out about the weed farm after being tipped off by Tenpenny, forcing CJ and The Truth to torch the marijuana fields and destroy a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;police helicopter&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;rocket launcher&lt;/a&gt;, before driving to Carl's garage in San Fierro with the drugs.\nSan Fierro.\nCarl meets Cesar and Kendl at the garage and finds out that it is derelict. He gets angry, but his sister calms him down and tells him that they can make it into a successful chop shop. Carl &lt;a href=\"Wear%20Flowers%20in%20Your%20Hair\"&gt;recruits&lt;/a&gt; some of The Truth's acquaintances - namely mechanics &lt;a href=\"Dwaine\"&gt;Dwaine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jethro\"&gt;Jethro&lt;/a&gt;, and electronics expert &lt;a href=\"Zero\"&gt;Zero&lt;/a&gt; - to help him get the garage working. Shortly after, Tenpenny calls Carl to tell him it is time to use the marijuana acquired from The Truth and &lt;a href=\"555%20We%20Tip\"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; him to plant them in the trunk of a &lt;a href=\"District%20Attorney\"&gt;District Attorney&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Merit\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; because he has been investigating him and Pulaski. Carl does as he is told, and the Attorney is arrested. Later, Tenpenny and Pulaski pay Carl a surprise visit, this time &lt;a href=\"Snail%20Trail\"&gt;demanding&lt;/a&gt; that he follows a &lt;a href=\"The%20Reporter\"&gt;reporter&lt;/a&gt; who has been investigating them back to Los Santos, where he kills both him and a &lt;a href=\"The%20Journalist\"&gt;journalist&lt;/a&gt; he is meeting with.\nDuring his time in San Fierro, CJ purchases Zero's RC shop and &lt;a href=\"Air%20Raid\"&gt;helps him&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Supply%20Lines...\"&gt;win&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"New%20Model%20Army\"&gt;an RC model war&lt;/a&gt; against his rival &lt;a href=\"Berkley\"&gt;Berkley&lt;/a&gt;, and earns the trust and respect of Woozie and the Triads after &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Cloud%20Boys%20%28mission%29\"&gt;helping&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ran%20Fa%20Li%20%28mission%29\"&gt;them&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lure%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;win&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Amphibious%20Assault\"&gt;a gang&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Da%20Nang%20Thang\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; against a Vietnamese gang called the &lt;a href=\"Da%20Nang%20Boys\"&gt;Da Nang Boys&lt;/a&gt;. One day, Cesar calls CJ to inform him of a Ballas car seen leaving the Mulholland Intersection and heading towards the countryside. They follow it to Angel Pine, where they take photos of a meeting between Ryder and some other men. CJ and Cesar soon learn that the men - &lt;a href=\"Jizzy%20B\"&gt;Jizzy B&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"T-Bone%20Mendez\"&gt;T-Bone Mendez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno\"&gt;Mike Toreno&lt;/a&gt; - are the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Syndicate\"&gt;Loco Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;, an organization supplying &lt;a href=\"Cocaine\"&gt;crack cocaine&lt;/a&gt; to Big Smoke, Ryder and the Ballas. Deciding to eliminate the organization, Carl first infiltrates it by &lt;a href=\"Jizzy%20%28mission%29\"&gt;offering his services to Jizzy&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"T-Bone%20Mendez%20%28mission%29\"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno%20%28mission%29\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Outrider\"&gt;for the organization&lt;/a&gt;, CJ eventually earns their trust, before &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Cold%20Killa\"&gt;turning on them and killing Jizzy&lt;/a&gt;. From Jizzy's phone, CJ then learns about the Syndicate's next meeting with the Ballas, which he &lt;a href=\"Pier%2069%20%28mission%29\"&gt;ambushes with the help of Cesar and the Triads, killing both T-Bone and Ryder&lt;/a&gt;. Carl later &lt;a href=\"Toreno%27s%20Last%20Flight\"&gt;destroys&lt;/a&gt; Toreno's helicopter, seemingly killing him, &lt;a href=\"Yay%20Ka-Boom-Boom\"&gt;as well as&lt;/a&gt; the Syndicate's &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Syndicate%20Crack%20Factory\"&gt;drug factory&lt;/a&gt;, putting them out of business.\nWith the Loco Syndicate eliminated, CJ focuses on earning money through his garage business. He buys the &lt;a href=\"Wang%20Cars%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;Wang Cars&lt;/a&gt; dealership and &lt;a href=\"Driving%20School\"&gt;attends the driving school to learn some advanced driving techniques&lt;/a&gt; that later help him and Cesar &lt;a href=\"Zeroing%20In\"&gt;steal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Test%20Drive\"&gt;various&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Customs%20Fast%20Track\"&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Puncture%20Wounds\"&gt;for the dealership&lt;/a&gt;.\nTierra Robada and Bone County.\nSome time later, CJ receives a phone call from a man using a digitally distorted voice, demanding that he come to a &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno%27s%20Ranch\"&gt;ranch&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tierra%20Robada\"&gt;Tierra Robada&lt;/a&gt;. There, Carl is surprised to find Toreno still alive, who reveals himself as the caller. Toreno explains to CJ that Sweet is in a prison upstate, but is safe, and that officer Ralph Pendelbury (whose murder C.R.A.S.H. threatened to frame Carl for) was killed under Tenpenny's orders, due to threatening to bring him before the &lt;a href=\"Internal%20Affairs%20Division\"&gt;Internal Affairs&lt;/a&gt;. Toreno proceeds to explain that he is an undercover government agent and demands that CJ assists him with several shady operations in exchange for Sweet's freedom. With no other choice, Carl agrees and performs &lt;a href=\"Highjack\"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Interdiction\"&gt;jobs&lt;/a&gt; for Toreno. He is later asked to &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Meadows%20%28mission%29\"&gt;buy&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Meadows%20Airfield\"&gt;abandoned airfield&lt;/a&gt; in the desert and &lt;a href=\"Learning%20to%20Fly\"&gt;learn to fly planes and helicopters&lt;/a&gt;, which helps him with his &lt;a href=\"N.O.E.\"&gt;next set&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stowaway\"&gt;of missions&lt;/a&gt; for Toreno.\nWhile at the airstrip, CJ is visited by The Truth, who asks for his help in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Project\"&gt;stealing&lt;/a&gt; a $60 million &lt;a href=\"Jetpack\"&gt;Jetpack&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Area%2069%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Area 69&lt;/a&gt;. Carl then uses the jetpack to also &lt;a href=\"Green%20Goo\"&gt;steal&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Green%20Goo%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;mysterious green substance&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"Freight\"&gt;military train&lt;/a&gt; and deliver it to The Truth, who lets him keep the jetpack, before parting ways.\nLas Venturas.\nShortly after, CJ receives a call from Woozie, who is now a successful businessman and has opened a &lt;a href=\"The%20Four%20Dragons%20Casino\"&gt;casino&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;, telling Carl to come visit him. CJ moves to Las Venturas, only to discover that the casino business is not doing as well as intended, due to facing opposition from the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Sindacco&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mafia\"&gt;Mafia&lt;/a&gt; families of Liberty City. Carl agrees to assist and helps defend Woozie and the casino from rival mob families including &lt;a href=\"Fender%20Ketchup\"&gt;scaring&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Sindacco\"&gt;underboss&lt;/a&gt; into revealing what family he is working for, and &lt;a href=\"You%27ve%20Had%20Your%20Chips\"&gt;destroying&lt;/a&gt; a Sindacco-controlled plastics factory producing fake chips planned to be smuggled into his casino. As revenge, Carl helps Woozie plan a robbery of the rival &lt;a href=\"Caligula%27s%20Casino\"&gt;Caligula's Casino&lt;/a&gt;, which is run by the mob. He performs numerous jobs in preparation for the heist, such as &lt;a href=\"Explosive%20Situation\"&gt;stealing some dynamite&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=\"Architectural%20Espionage\"&gt;photographing the plans of the casino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Key%20to%20Her%20Heart\"&gt;stealing swipe card&lt;/a&gt; for the casino from a &lt;a href=\"Millie%20Perkins\"&gt;croupier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dam%20and%20Blast\"&gt;setting explosives at the city dam that will destroy the generators and cut off the electricity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cop%20Wheels\"&gt;stealing some HPV1000 police bikes&lt;/a&gt; for the getaway, and &lt;a href=\"Up%2C%20Up%20and%20Away%21\"&gt;highjacking an armored van&lt;/a&gt; using a &lt;a href=\"Leviathan\"&gt;Leviathan&lt;/a&gt; helicopter and respraying it with the Caligula's Casino logo.\nLater, Carl receives a call from The Truth, who reveals that the previous night he travelled into the desert with a British band called &lt;a href=\"The%20Gurning%20Chimps\"&gt;The Gurning Chimps&lt;/a&gt;, but after smoking some peyote, they all fell unconscious. Truth tells Carl he is in Los Santos with almost no memories of the night before or how he got there. He then asks CJ to &lt;a href=\"Don%20Peyote\"&gt;save&lt;/a&gt; the band's manager &lt;a href=\"Kent%20Paul\"&gt;Kent Paul&lt;/a&gt; and lead singer &lt;a href=\"Maccer\"&gt;Maccer&lt;/a&gt; from the desert, which he does, bringing them to Caligula's Casino, where Paul's old friend &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Ken Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt; is working as the manager. Seeing this as another opportunity to infiltrate, CJ begins &lt;a href=\"Intensive%20Care\"&gt;working with Ken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Meat%20Business\"&gt;in order to earn the mob's trust&lt;/a&gt;, soon learning that Ken has been chosen by each Mafia family as a neutral party to run the casino on each family's behalf, and that he is threatened with death should any war between the three Mafia families begin. Soon, a conflict begins between the Sindacco and the Leone families, which escalates into a war between all three families, prompting the Leone family's Don, &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore Leone&lt;/a&gt;, to travel to Las Venturas and take over Caligula's. CJ offers his services to Salvatore, who employs to help him in his conflict with the other two families so that he would gain more control over the casino. He first sends Carl to &lt;a href=\"Freefall\"&gt;kill several hitmen arriving in the city by plane&lt;/a&gt;, and later to travel to Liberty City to &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Mark%27s%20Bistro\"&gt;assassinate&lt;/a&gt; the Forelli Family's Don, &lt;a href=\"Marco%20Forelli\"&gt;Marco Forelli&lt;/a&gt;. During his mission to assassinate Marco, CJ also helps Ken, Paul and Maccer escape from the mob by faking their deaths and telling them to flee Las Venturas.\nHaving earned Salvatore's trust, CJ decides it is time to rob Caligula's. Aided by Woozie, Zero, and the Triads, &lt;a href=\"Breaking%20the%20Bank%20at%20Caligula%27s\"&gt;the heist is carried out successfully&lt;/a&gt;, weakening the mob and allowing the Triads to freely run their casino. Woozie &lt;a href=\"Fish%20in%20a%20Barrel\"&gt;asks&lt;/a&gt; Carl to become his business partner and he accepts, with the pair starting to run the casino together. CJ receives a threatening call from Salvatore, but ignores him, cutting all his ties with the mob.\nDuring his time in Las Venturas, CJ also meets the rapper Madd Dogg and &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%20%28mission%29\"&gt;saves him from a suicide attempt&lt;/a&gt; (having fallen into depression after Carl unwillingly destroyed his career while helping OG Loc). Carl is later summoned by Tenpenny and Pulaski for one final job and is ordered to &lt;a href=\"Misappropriation\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Drug%20Enforcement%20Administration\"&gt;DEA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Dossier%20Carrier\"&gt;agent&lt;/a&gt; and collect a dossier. Carl collects the dossier, and Tenpenny asks him to meet him in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Brujas\"&gt;a deserted village&lt;/a&gt; in the desert to hand it over. Once there, however, CJ is &lt;a href=\"High%20Noon\"&gt;betrayed&lt;/a&gt; by Tenpenny, who leaves Pulaski to kill and bury him, along with Hernandez, who secretly informed the Internal Affairs of his partners' corruption. Carl is saved by Hernandez, who is killed by Pulaski in the process, before pursuing and killing Pulaski.\nWith Woozie's casino a success, Carl finds the task of running it boring, as both he and Kendl wish to return to Los Santos. CJ is surprised when Madd Dogg, having returned from rehab, visits him and asks him to become his manager and restore his career. Carl agrees and returns to Los Santos with Kendl and Cesar, where he &lt;a href=\"A%20Home%20in%20the%20Hills\"&gt;reclaims&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%27s%20Crib\"&gt;Dogg's mansion&lt;/a&gt; from the Vagos, to whom he sold it for drugs, with the help of the Triads. He then calls Ken Rosenberg, Kent Paul and Maccer, who have also arrived in Los Santos, and recruits them to work for Madd Dogg and help him restore his career.\nReturn to Los Santos.\nCJ soon receives a surprise visit from Toreno, who demands one last favour: to &lt;a href=\"Vertical%20Bird\"&gt;steal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;a military jet&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"LHD-069\"&gt;LHD-069&lt;/a&gt; amphibious assault ship anchored at the &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Basin%20Naval%20Base\"&gt;Easter Basin Naval Base&lt;/a&gt; and use it to destroy a flotilla of &lt;a href=\"Tropic\"&gt;spy ships&lt;/a&gt;. Carl does so, and Toreno keeps his promise by having Sweet released early. Carl &lt;a href=\"Home%20Coming\"&gt;goes to pick up his brother&lt;/a&gt; and tries to impress him with all the businesses he got since he left Los Santos, telling him about his garage in San Fierro, the casino in Las Venturas, and the management of Madd Dogg. However, Sweet is not happy with Carl's new lifestyle, which has led him to neglect the gang. To prove his loyalty, Carl takes his brother back to Ganton and they work together to reclaim Grove Street from the Ballas, re-establishing the Grove Street Families. The Johnson brothers then begin to reclaim their gang's turf from their rivals and attempt to track down Big Smoke. Learning that former gang member &lt;a href=\"B-Dup\"&gt;B Dup&lt;/a&gt; is working for him, CJ and Sweet go &lt;a href=\"Beat%20Down%20on%20B%20Dup\"&gt;to confront him in the hopes of learning about Smoke's whereabouts&lt;/a&gt;, but to no avail; still, they manage to convince &lt;a href=\"Big%20Bear\"&gt;Big Bear&lt;/a&gt; to quit drugs and rejoin the gang. Later, CJ also helps Sweet &lt;a href=\"Grove%204%20Life\"&gt;take over&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Idlewood\"&gt;Idlewood&lt;/a&gt; from the Ballas, and Madd Dogg to &lt;a href=\"Cut%20Throat%20Business\"&gt;exact his revenge on OG Loc&lt;/a&gt;, who goes bankrupt whilst Dogg officially restarts his rapping career, taking almost all of Los Santos from them.\nMeanwhile, Tenpenny is arrested and put on trial for several charges but is acquitted due to lack of evidence. This angers the people of Los Santos, leading to a &lt;a href=\"Riot%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;citywide riot&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, Carl helps Cesar &lt;a href=\"Los%20Desperados\"&gt;reclaim his gang's turf&lt;/a&gt; from the Vagos, and continues taking over more territories from the Ballas and Vagos, until the Grove Street Families become powerful enough for Sweet to learn Big Smoke's whereabouts.\nThe Johnson brothers &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke%27s%20Crack%20Palace\"&gt;Smoke's crack palace&lt;/a&gt; to kill him for his betrayal of the gang, but CJ apologizes to Sweet and convinces to let him deal with Smoke on his own, to make up for all his mistakes. Fighting his way through the fortress, Carl eventually confronts Big Smoke and attempts to reason with him, but he opens fire on CJ. In the ensuing firefight, Carl fatally shoots Smoke, who admits to having betrayed the gang for money and proclaims that \"Everybody will remember my name! Big Smoke!\", before dying. As Carl laments Smoke's death, claiming it was a \"waste\", Tenpenny arrives to collect his share of Smoke's money from the drug trade and hold Carl at gunpoint to load the money into his briefcase, intending to use it to flee the city. He then attempts to kill Carl, but he survives. Tenpenny then attempts to escape in a stolen &lt;a href=\"Firetruck%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;firetruck&lt;/a&gt;, but Sweet grabs hold of the truck's ladder. Carl follows them in a &lt;a href=\"Feltzer\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; and manages to catch Sweet when he loses his grip. The brothers then pursue Tenpenny together, with Sweet taking the wheel, while Carl shoots at pursuing police officers and rioting gang members. Tenpenny soon loses control of the firetruck and crashes off the bridge over Grove Street. After claiming that he \"cleaned up the streets\", Tenpenny finally dies, as CJ, his friends and family watch. The Truth congratulates Carl on \"beating the system\", before they head into the Johnson house to celebrate.\nCarl, Sweet, Kendl and Cesar are next seen discussing what their future holds, when Madd Dogg, Ken Rosenberg, Kent Paul, and Maccer appear, with Dogg proudly showing off his first gold record. As his friends and family begin to celebrate, CJ heads outside, claiming he's \"Fittin' to hit the block, see what's happening\". With Tenpenny dead, the riots come to an end, and justice is finally restored in Los Santos."}

Once an organisation member enters the vehicle, the mission starts. The players have to go to three semi-random locations around &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; and destroy three piles of crates in each location. There are eight locations overall - three in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and five in the countryside. Each set of crates is guarded by enemies and rival players in the lobby are also encouraged to destroy the vehicle.\nThe city locations are the &lt;a href=\"Fridgit\"&gt;Fridgit Factory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cypress%20Flats\"&gt;Cypress Flats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Island\"&gt;Elysian Island&lt;/a&gt; (the enemies at these locations are &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos&lt;/a&gt;, who have blocked the area with &lt;a href=\"Contender\"&gt;Contender&lt;/a&gt;s) and the &lt;a href=\"Mile%20High%20Club\"&gt;Mile High Club&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pillbox%20Hill\"&gt;Pillbox Hill&lt;/a&gt; (this location will be protected by &lt;a href=\"Kkangpae\"&gt;Kkangpae&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;s). The countryside locations are &lt;a href=\"Ortega%27s%20Trailer\"&gt;Ortega's Trailer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stab%20City\"&gt;Stab City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Galilee\"&gt;Galilee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hookies\"&gt;Hookies&lt;/a&gt; (the enemies at these locations are &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;, who have blocked the area with &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Burrito\"&gt;Gang Burrito&lt;/a&gt;s) and the &lt;a href=\"Palmer-Taylor%20Power%20Station\"&gt;Palmer-Taylor Power Station&lt;/a&gt; (this location will be protected by Los Santos Vagos and their Contenders). The first location will always be in the half of the map the mission was started in, either in the city or the countryside, but the second and third locations can also be in the other part of the map. All locations can be seen in the gallery below.\nThe Phantom Wedge in this mission is much stronger than the regular version. \nThe player is given 15 minutes to destroy all supplies in the three locations around the map. After completing the mission, a timer will begin beeping; after 30 seconds, the Phantom Wedge will explode, but this gives the player enough time to vacate the vicinity of the final pile of crates if there are still active enemies."}

They operate within and ensure public and social order. Police appear, in some way or form, in every \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" title.\nPolice are also colloquially referred to as the babylon, cops, coppers, Five-O, flat-feet, fuz, heat, pigs, or the popo within the series and amongst various different ethnic groups, countries and regions.\nDescription.\nIn the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series, the main purpose of the police is to enforce law and order within the game's open-world environment. Their primary function is to respond to criminal activities committed by the player or NPCs (non-player characters), such as theft, assault, or other violations of the in-game law. The extent to which they respond and indeed react to crimes such as these varies depending on the title, but always remain a constant threat to players engaging in criminal activities, adding an element of challenge and risk to the gameplay experience. \nPolice in the \"GTA\" series generally operate by patrolling the streets in vehicles or on foot, and they react dynamically to criminal behavior. When a player commits a crime, such as attacking civilians, stealing vehicles, or engaging in gunfights, nearby police officers will be alerted and begin pursuing the player to apprehend or neutralize them.\nAlongside regular patrols, police are dispatched to respond to crimes committed by the player. The amount of law enforcement and the power they operate with depends on the player's &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level\"&gt;Wanted Level&lt;/a&gt;.\nWanted Level.\nThe police work upon a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level\"&gt;Wanted Level&lt;/a&gt; system against the player. If the player is noticed performing a crime, he may gain a Wanted Star (increasing his wanted level). More serious crimes will grant a higher wanted level. Police responses vary depending on the wanted level, ranging from foot chases to calling in the helicopter, the &lt;a href=\"Special%20Weapons%20and%20Tactics\"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;) or even the &lt;a href=\"Military\"&gt;armed forces&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelevant offenses include crashing into a police car, shooting pedestrians, having sex with &lt;a href=\"prostitutes\"&gt;prostitutes&lt;/a&gt; in GTA San Andreas, stealing vehicles, entering prohibited areas or occasionally unavoidable participation in certain missions (ex. bank heists). The police will not arrest the player for trespassing on private property, traffic offenses (ex. speeding, running red lights). See a comprehensive list of arrestable offenses below.\nIf the player gets &lt;a href=\"Busted\"&gt;Busted&lt;/a&gt; by the police, the player will respawn at the nearest &lt;a href=\"Police%20Stations\"&gt;Police Stations&lt;/a&gt;, but lose some &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; and all of his weapons, except in GTA San Andreas if &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;CJ&lt;/a&gt; is dating &lt;a href=\"Barbara%20Schternvart\"&gt;Barbara&lt;/a&gt; as she is an officer herself. Higher levels of law enforcement are not concerned with arresting the player, but with killing the player, although will attempt vehicular arrest if the opportunity arises. Being &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;Wasted&lt;/a&gt; is only temporary and the player will respawn at the nearest &lt;a href=\"Hospitals\"&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt; with the loss of weapons and some money (no weapons are lost in &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;). In \"\" the player can pay a $2000 bribe to get their weapons back from either the hospital or police station.\nWanted levels can be reduced by the use of a &lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;Pay 'n' Spray&lt;/a&gt;. In \"GTA III\", there may be rare occasions when police cars try to block the player's entrance to the Pay 'n' Spray, especially with higher Wanted levels. The &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;Wanted Level in GTA IV&lt;/a&gt; system allows the player to evade a wanted level by escaping from a certain radius, based on the last place they were spotted.

They all drive &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt; trucks and are armed with weapons that will make short work of the player. Their Enforcers are fast and can smash up a vehicle in a small amount of time. Their trucks also form roadblocks. They have Micro Uzis in \"GTA III\" and \"GTA San Andreas\", and Uzis in \"GTA Vice City\", \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\". SWAT teams are a real threat to the player and come in 4 men per team. Also, in \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\", undercover \"&lt;a href=\"Vice%20Squad%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice Squad&lt;/a&gt;\" officers armed with Uzis in &lt;a href=\"VCPD%20Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetahs&lt;/a&gt; will chase the player at 3 stars and above. Their cars are fast, and they come two per unit.\nThe Police AI is more advanced in \"GTA Vice City Stories\", rendering them more tenacious in pursuing the player, even at a one-star wanted level. It is nearly impossible to carjack a police vehicle with officers inside without being instantly busted, and they will also more aggressively climb on board vehicles and otherwise pursue Victor, which makes getting busted more likely.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"GTA IV\", whenever &lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;NPCs&lt;/a&gt; are arrested and escorted to the police vehicle, the police officer will usually drive the NPC criminal around the road without even making effort to transport them to the Police Station. The criminal will eventually get off if something interrupts the arrest, without even being treated as resisting arrest, probably because the officer (like &lt;a href=\"Paramedics\"&gt;Paramedics&lt;/a&gt;) weren't programmed to drive a NPC criminal to a station. NPCs arrested by hand however, are treated as resisting arrest, if the criminal is aggressive or escapes, the Police will try to stop or kill them. This mechanic can be used to the player's advantage; should the player lure an aggressive NPC towards one or more police officers, there is a decent chance the police will get the attacker off the player's back by arresting them.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn \"GTA V\", police officers now act aggressively towards NPCs, engaging in car chases and gunfights against pursuers. Like in \"GTA San Andreas\", helicopters can be found flying around South Los Santos looking for crime. They can also be found in the skies during a pursuit, whether be an NPC or a protagonist. Unlike in \"GTA IV\", they do not arrest NPCs and instead shoot on sight, whenever they are armed or not. This could be because the game may lack a \"Busted\" mechanic for NPCs. NPCs also react to Wanted Levels unlike other games, such as prostitutes not entering a player's car near law enforcers, or if a police vehicle, driven by an NPC or player goes past them, they will flee the area. Families gang members will shoot at police officers if they are pursuing Franklin on a 1 or 2 star wanted level, or if an NPC gang member is chased by law enforcers, their homies will shoot at the pursuers. Officers also tend to be shot at when patrolling a gang neighborhood. Strangely, police cars are only usually found near stations, they are rarely anywhere in the city. If a person is killed on street, the police will examine the scene before returning to patrol, however this usually happen only if the police has shot and killed the person. If the Paramedics do not arrive to treat the wounded people, the police may radio one or leave the scene instead. Sometimes, police officers might even use civilian cars to pursue the player when in pursuit, appearing on the &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt; as normal police vehicles. This happens more often when the player steals a police vehicle and abandons their previous vehicle nearby.\nOnline Multiplayer.\n\"GTA IV\"'s Multiplayer.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;GTA IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the Police in Multiplayer Mode will not arrest the player, but will shoot at them in an attempt to kill them, though they can still pull the player out of a car.\nAt 4 stars the police send in an &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt; with two assault rifle wielding NOOSE agents firing from the sides of the chopper. The police will arrive in cars containing two police officers. One will carry a &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt; while the other will (usually) carry a &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Action%20Shotgun\"&gt;Pump Action Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of what guns are allowed in the online game. NOOSE agents arrive in NOOSE Enforcers only, as the &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Cruiser\"&gt;NOOSE Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Patriot\"&gt;NOOSE Patriot&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Buffalo\"&gt;FIB Buffalo&lt;/a&gt; only appear in Race and GTA Race multiplayer modes, albeit they are only used by the players.\nNOOSE agents are equipped mainly with Carbine Rifles and SMGs, but sometimes they have a Pump Shotgun and NOOSE agents will sometimes fall back to their pistol if they lose their weapon.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; does not appear in multiplayer at all, and the Police Maverick also only appears in the Race and GTA Race modes. It is notable that Wanted Levels are usually cumulative if multiple players are riding in the same vehicle. When faced with multiple players with wanted levels, the police usually target the nearest player.\nThe player can still use a &lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;Pay 'n' Spray&lt;/a&gt; in multiplayer, though the same rules using them when police are nearby in single player apply to multiplayer as well. If the player is shot in a &lt;a href=\"Deathmatch\"&gt;Deathmatch&lt;/a&gt;, it will count as a death on purpose and will lose $100. Police can be turned off online.\n\"GTA Online\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", the police are a constant threat, and cannot be turned off, though they don't appear in some missions and game modes. At one and two stars, officers in the area will be notified and will patrol the streets searching for the player. The police will open fire at all costs. At three stars, a Police Maverick will be sent after the player, making a possible escape much more difficult. At four stars, NOOSE officers are sent after the player, as well as more helicopters. Standard police units will become much rarer, as NOOSE begin to take an advantage. NOOSE officers will be armed with Pump Shotguns and Carbine Rifles. At five stars, the presence of NOOSE increases even more, and Police Maverick units being more accurate and the fire rate increasing."}

The vehicle is generally known as the \"Police\", with the exception of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\" and ', where it is referred to as the Police Car and VCPD Cruiser, respectively.\nThey have two sirens, one default wail tone, and the yelp tone, triggered by holding the horn button. The player will receive five rounds of ammunition for any weapon in the &lt;a href=\"Shotgun\"&gt;Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; slot after entering a Police car.\nDesign.\nThe general design of the Police varies in accordance with the settings of the games, but they retain the same sedan design that is also shared with the &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt;. These renditions are based on real-life police vehicles used around their corresponding eras.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\" \u2014 \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nThe Police resembles a cross between a and a . An early &lt;a href=\"https%3A//i.imgur.com/sxHkn6D.jpeg\"&gt;pre-release concept rendering&lt;/a&gt; shows that it was also influenced by the , as the early model bears a strong resemblance to one, down to the little bumps for the headlight washers. It is the primary vehicle of the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", the Police features a black/white paintjob with \"LCPD\" and \"POLICE\" markings around it, reminiscent of most Californian police patrol vehicles such as LAPD and many Highway Patrol units. It has a red/white light bar on the roof, along with four additional red lamps and what appears to be a traffic advisor facing to the rear (though they flash red and blue lights when on). The Police was originally intended to have a blue paint scheme with white stripes, similar to 1990s/early 2000s NYPD police cars, however, this was changed shortly before the the release of the game. This was because of the 9/11 terrorist attacks that took place in New York City in September of 2001, and the designers of \"GTA III\" felt that it was insensitive to have the emergency vehicles of the game resemble those that may have been at the scene of the attacks.\nIn \"\", the vehicle retains its black and white colour scheme, however as opposed to the white doors, the entire body is now black. The \"GTA III\" livery is also replaced with the original striped livery featured on the blue police car. The red lamps from the \"GTA III\" iteration were also removed.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" \u2014 \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nThe design of the Police is a combination of the front and rear of the and the midsection of the . It is the standard vehicle of the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;VCPD&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"1984\"&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoth renditions feature a green and white livery with \"City of Vice Police\" markings on either side. The color choice appear to reflect the police cars used by the Miami-Dade Police Department (although the paint scheme seems to emulate the ones from the 1980s TV series '). The ' rendition appears with a slightly worn appearance, while the \"\" appears with a seemingly clean appearance. The lightbar is the same as the main light bar of the \"GTA III\" iteration, but featuring red, blue and white colours (though they only flash red and blue lights).\nDuring development, the vehicle was white with red and blue stripes along each side, resembling squad cars from the Miami Beach Police Department. In the PC version of \"GTA Vice City\", a rare all-white variant can be found parked at random locations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe car is based on the &lt;a href=\"Premier\"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt;. It has a black/white paint scheme reflecting LAPD police cars from the era, equipped with a red/blue light bar (again flashing red and blue lights). The side has the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Police Department&lt;/a&gt;'s initials, along with the seal of the &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas Police Department&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Advance\".\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\" rendition of the Police is designed to bear a likeness to the Police from \"GTA III\", with a generally rounded profile and a black-white paintjob. An identification number can be seen on the trunk.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThroughout all the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; games, the Police car is very fast, with excellent handling, and moderate durability. These stats make it great for drifting.\nIn \"GTA III\", the Police car has suspension which is high and quite soft, and coupled with the high speed of the vehicle, body roll is rather noticeable and can be an issue, as if the player is rammed in a police car whilst turning at speed, the car will probably roll over.\nDespite the fact that the Police car in &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt; has an AWD layout, it lacks the stability of other fast AWD vehicles in the game (namely the &lt;a href=\"Deluxo\"&gt;Deluxo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt;). This is due in part to its soft suspension and poor roll resistance, as well as to its poor tire traction even at moderate speeds. As such, the Police is prone to roll over or spin at a moment's notice, so it may be best to avoid drastic and abrupt maneuvers while driving it.\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", the police car retains the same characteristics from previous games.\nIn \"GTA Advance\", unlike other renditions, the car is substantially more speedy, with a top speed matched with that of the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\nPolice cars are usually parked in front of police stations and are often locked. They also can be seen patrolling the streets and during &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted levels&lt;/a&gt;, mainly on one and two stars."}
{"id": "27634", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=27634", "title": "Police Bike", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Western%20Motorcycle%20Company\"&gt;Western Motorcycle Company&lt;/a&gt; Police Bike is a &lt;a href=\"Motor%20Officer\"&gt;police motorcycle&lt;/a&gt; that appears in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDesign.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nThe Police Bike is seemingly based on the . It is similar to an , but is closer in design to the Road King due to the lack of a fairing.\nThe Police Bike appears to be similar to the &lt;a href=\"Wolfsbane\"&gt;Wolfsbane&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with additional framework added for protection, smaller wheels, and the necessary policing and road-cruising equipment added. The front section features a bulky fender/mudguard with amber lights on either side and mounted to the fork legs, while the upper area consist of a circular headlight pod with a silver/chrome trim around, a tall windshield/visor with white \"POLICE\" markings on the front and a set of square turn signals and emergency lights on either side of the lower triple clamp. The handlebars are supported by dual frames and connected to the base of the windshield framing, in place of a traditional upper plate.\nOn the main body, the bike features a dual main frame on the front and additional frames on the sides, with the right one mounting a horn/loudhailer. The fuel tank is relatively small and features two caps on either side and a single speedometer on the center, while a black leather seat is seen extending towards the rear and a square oil tank below it. The engine bay features an oval-shaped air filter and exhaust pipes on the right side, with the latter coming from each cylinder block and splitting towards either side of the bike. An additional pipe also comes from the rear cylinder block and merges with the right exhaust pipe. The front area also has foot pads for the rider.\nThe rear section consist of a large fender/mudguard with additional framework for the equipment and a plate holder on the end with what looks like two blue circular lights beside it that function when the engine is on. The top frame mounts a single box, dual antenna, rectangular tail lights and tall beacons, while the side frames/racks mount two larger boxes and a set of rear-facing turn signals and emergency lights. The rear wheel is connected to a dual-sided swingarm, having dual suspension springs mounted to the side frames and the corresponding chain drive and sprocket on the left. Due to the rear equipment, the Police Bike only has capacity for the rider, despite still featuring rear foot pegs for a passenger, like most conventional bikes.\nThe vehicle is only seen in a white color with &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; markings on the fenders, fuel tank and boxes, with the emblems seen on either end. It uses a set of rims similar to the &lt;a href=\"Freeway\"&gt;Freeway&lt;/a&gt; and wrapped in medium-profile tires, with the rear wheel being slightly wider.\nIn multiplayer, LCPD officers are not seen riding the bike or pursuing the player in it (like the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Stinger\"&gt;Police Stinger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser%20%28Buffalo%29\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;), unless they find it within their proximity, like most civilian vehicles.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the bike reappears with almost the exact look as in \"TBoGT\", except for a few details. The bike no longer features tall beacon lights and dual antenna, but makes use of modern LED lights on either side of the front fender, above either side boxes and behind the top box. The tail light units were moved below the top frame's height and the blue lights beside the license plate work as additional emergency lights. The windshield/visor has an unknown window tint applied by default.\nIn the enhanced version, the speedometer dial on the fuel tank uses the same \"Chopper Bike\" dial set also shared with motorcycles such as the &lt;a href=\"Bagger\"&gt;Bagger&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Daemon\"&gt;Daemon&lt;/a&gt;, and the amber lights were given a more red color to match with other &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; vehicles. It also gains an updated siren sound, being a yelp-siren and its noise is more electric.\nAgain, the bike is only available in white, but features LSPD markings on the fenders and top box, with the emblems and motto seen on either side of the fuel tank. It also retains the same wheel design as before.\nDespite having an LSPD livery on the bike, the only force to use it are the &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20Highway%20Patrol\"&gt;San Andreas Highway Patrol&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nBeing based on a Harley-Davidson Road King, the bike is somewhat heavy but high in power and torque, meaning its top speed and acceleration are average for motorcycles, but higher than most cars. However, the handling is excellent for such a heavy bike, with its powerful brakes being another positive. The bike can also withstand more damage than any other bike in the game, and takes virtually no damage when shot in the saddle bags.\nThe bike is powered by a V-Twin engine and coupled to a 5-speed gearbox. It also shares the engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Angel%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Angel&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daemon\"&gt;Daemon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Wayfarer\"&gt;Wayfarer&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nReturning to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the bike's acceleration and top speed capabilities remain unchanged. However, the response of setting off (including traction) has been greatly improved, and with GTA V's new handling physics, the bike is much more responsive for cornering and braking. Because of the bike's weight, the Police Bike is not a bike capable of successful or easy wheelies, often the bike attempts to pull itself back down when at high speed due to gravitational force, but it also tends to be sluggish at wheelies even at moderate speeds.\nAgain, the bike is powered by a V-Twin engine, but this time coupled to a 4-speed gearbox. The Police Bike uses a low-revving, odd-firing engine sound similar to the one found on the &lt;a href=\"Hexer\"&gt;Hexer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Daemon\"&gt;Daemon&lt;/a&gt;. However, it seems to emit a louder tone similar to the one found on the &lt;a href=\"Bagger\"&gt;Bagger&lt;/a&gt;."}

Police bribe locations vary widely, with some showing up in obvious locations, while others are well hidden from plain view. Some require performing a jump in an automobile to reach, as they are positioned at a slight altitude, being inaccessible on-foot.

Police cars are known by different names in different games, whilst \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;GTA IV&lt;/a&gt;\" has two models of police cars: The &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Police%20Patrol\"&gt;Police Patrol&lt;/a&gt;. Since \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;GTA III&lt;/a&gt;\", the majority of police cars in the game have shared the same body design as the &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt;.\n2D Universe.\nIn the first \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\", the police car is known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Squad%20Car\"&gt;Squad Car&lt;/a&gt;\". Three variants of the car exist, each appearing in each of game's three cities. In &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, the Squad Car is rounded vehicle with blue-white livery, appearing similar to a 1990's Chevrolet Caprice; the &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt; variants are actually adaptations of the &lt;a href=\"Portsmouth\"&gt;Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt;, with the San Andreas version bearing a black-and-white body color design and similar angular body design, and the Vice City rendition being colored blue and white but features a modified body that appears wider and rounded. In the PC version of the game, the police cars (along with the &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ambulance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Fire Truck&lt;/a&gt;) will have their radio tuned to &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn%20Underground%20FM\"&gt;Brooklyn Underground FM&lt;/a&gt;, unlike all other renditions throughout the series which only have the standard police dispatch radio.\nThe performance of the Squad Cars are identical in all three cities, and are all essentially the best in the game, with the highest top speed and acceleration among all cars in the game, highly responsive brakes and good grip. While the cars are given a very high export value of $2,000, but the cars cannot be exported, as are other emergency vehicles.\nPolice cars in ' and ' are known as \"&lt;a href=\"Copper\"&gt;Copper&lt;/a&gt;s\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\", the police car is known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Cop%20Car\"&gt;Cop Car&lt;/a&gt;\" and assumes a completely original design, looking like a retro-futuristic squad car with 1940s design cues. Like in the first \"GTA\", it is the fastest car in the game, along with the &lt;a href=\"Meteor\"&gt;Meteor&lt;/a&gt;, and features responsive cornering and brakes, making it a desirable vehicle to drive. It is also the only car in the game which gives a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Bribes\"&gt;Cop Bribe&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Crusher\"&gt;crushed&lt;/a&gt;. The police car in \"GTA 2\" was originally green-and-white, along with the &lt;a href=\"SWAT%20Van\"&gt;SWAT Van&lt;/a&gt;, but this combination is never seen in the game, it was changed to a blue-and-white combination.\n3D Universe.\nIn all the games of this era, the police car has been known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Police%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt;\", with the exception of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\" and '. In \"GTA Advance\", it is referred to as the \"Police Car\", and in \"GTA Vice City Stories\", it is called the \"VCPD Cruiser\".\nThroughout all 3D era games, police cars are very fast, with excellent handling, and moderate durability. These stats make it great for drifting. They have two sirens, one default \"long-whirl\", and the \"rotating-weep\", triggered by holding the horn button. The player will receive 5 rounds of ammunition for any weapon in the &lt;a href=\"Shotguns\"&gt;shotgun&lt;/a&gt; slot after entering a Police car.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\" \u2014 \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nThe Police Car in these two games resembles a cross between a Chevrolet Caprice and a Ford Crown Victoria.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;GTA III&lt;/a&gt;\", the Police Car was originally intended to have a blue-and-white stripes livery similar to the 1990s/early 2000s NYPD police cars, however, in the final version, they have standard black and white livery like the Los Angeles Police Department. Also, the original Police Car had a more sleek profile compared to the final which appears more angular/boxy (though hints of the aerodynamic design remain). The Police Cars in \"\" feature the stripes livery intended for \"GTA III\" cars, albeit in black-and-white rather than blue-and-white.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" \u2014 \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nIn these two games, the design of the vehicle is a combination of the front and rear of the and the midsection of the . Both feature a green and white livery, much like the Miami-Dade Police Department. During development, the vehicle was white with red and blue stripes along each side, resembling squad cars from the . Despite the differences in textures and paint, the vehicle polygon model is reused from \"GTA III\". In the PC version of \"GTA Vice City\", a rare all-white variant can be found parked at random locations.\nDespite the fact that the Police in \"GTA Vice City\" has AWD, it lacks the stability of other fast AWD vehicles in the game (namely the &lt;a href=\"Deluxo\"&gt;Deluxo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt;). This is due in part to its soft suspension and poor roll resistance as well as to its poor tire traction even at moderate speeds.\u00a0 As such, the Police is prone to roll over or spin at a moments notice, so it may be best to avoid drastic and abrupt maneuvers while driving it.\nThe same car was reused in &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Manhunt\"&gt;Manhunt&lt;/a&gt; games. They only appear as static objects, as driving is not an intended feature in Manhunt. The main difference is that the car has a black and white paintjob instead of a green and white paintjob.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThere are three variations in \"\". The &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Police Department&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Police%20Department\"&gt;San Fierro Police Department&lt;/a&gt; versions have the same build, based on the &lt;a href=\"Premier\"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt;, with the San Fierro version having slightly higher suspension most likely due to San Fierro's hilly streets with steep inclines (like its real life counterpart, San Francisco), and markings for their respective cities. The &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20Police%20Department\"&gt;Las Venturas Police Department&lt;/a&gt; version generally resembles a 1981-1990 Chevrolet Caprice, with the sides and back reminiscent of the 1980-1989 Dodge Diplomat, and the closest civilian car in the game is the &lt;a href=\"Tahoma\"&gt;Tahoma&lt;/a&gt;. All police vehicles feature a standard black and white livery.\nThe police officers in the countryside employ a large, four-by-four &lt;a href=\"Ranger\"&gt;Ranger&lt;/a&gt;, based on the &lt;a href=\"Rancher\"&gt;Rancher&lt;/a&gt;, for pursuit on rough terrain.\nAccording to handling.cfg, the Los Santos police car features a slightly lower suspension than the other two. The Los Santos police car also features perfect 50/50 traction bias, whereas the other two variants have a 2% traction bias to the rear wheels. Lastly, the San Fierro police car has its centre of mass 5 centimetres lower than the other two. In theory, this would make the San Fierro car more stable on inclines and having more manageable body roll, and the Los Santos car more suitable for high speed chasing, with the Las Venturas car being best in straight lines. However the differences are so small it is nearly unnoticeable.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Advance\".\nThe \"GTA Advance\" rendition of the Police is designed to bear a likeness to the Police from \"GTA III\", with a generally rounded profile and a black-white paintjob. Unlike other renditions, the car is substantially more speedy, with a top speed matched with the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;'s. Being a mid-sized car, crushing the Police will only award the player with a base amount of $532.\nHD Universe.\nThe HD Universe emulates common real-life modern law enforcement vehicles. The popular Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor is represented by the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Vapid Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, and is used extensively in the HD Universe games. Other in-game variants of police cars exist, like the &lt;a href=\"Merit\"&gt;Merit&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"Police%20Patrol\"&gt;Police Patrol&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA IV\" (inspired by the NYPD's use of the ), and the &lt;a href=\"Buffalo\"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser%20%28Buffalo%29\"&gt;cruiser&lt;/a&gt; in \"TBoGT\" and \"GTA V\" (inspired by the ).\n\"GTA V\" emulates the declining usage of the Crown Victoria as a general purpose cruiser, as the inspired &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser%20%28interceptor%29\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; takes that role within the LSPD. Classic Police Cruisers will spawn at police stations, however do not normally spawn on patrol or when the player is being pursued. However, the Crown Victoria inspired &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20Cruiser\"&gt;Sheriff Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; is the main patrol vehicle of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County%20Sheriff\"&gt;Los Santos County Sheriff&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", there are two police cars \u2013 the &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Merit\"&gt;Merit&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"Police%20Patrol\"&gt;Police Patrol&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vapid\"&gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stanier\"&gt;Stanier&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;. Two more police cars, a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser%20%28Buffalo%29\"&gt;Buffalo-based Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; and a high-performance &lt;a href=\"Police%20Stinger\"&gt;Police Stinger&lt;/a&gt;, are available in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\"s multiplayer.\nThe player can get in any police car and access the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Computer\"&gt;police computer&lt;/a&gt; while stationary. The computer can be used to access &lt;a href=\"Most%20Wanted\"&gt;Most Wanted&lt;/a&gt; missions, or &lt;a href=\"Vigilante\"&gt;locate and apprehend&lt;/a&gt; nearby criminals.\nThe siren on \"GTA IV\"s police cars features four variations. Tapping the horn activates a wail tone, and holding the horn activates either a yelp or hyper siren tone. Holding the horn with the siren turned off sounds the siren's air horn. Despite NPC police officers sometimes sounding the regular horn when in a police vehicle, the player is unable to do so. When exiting a police vehicle with the siren activated, the siren will turn off but the emergency lighting will remain on. The siren will then re-activate when the player enters the vehicle again.\nThe player can dial 911 to summon the police car by luring them to a false alarm. Stealing the car (while the officer searches for any incidents), will attract a one-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;Wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. In some places, a police car can be stolen from a parking lot or curbside without incurring a Wanted level.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nPolice cars in \"\" are simply dubbed \"&lt;a href=\"Police%20Patrol\"&gt;Police Patrol&lt;/a&gt;\", the same name for those seen in \"GTA IV\". While having reverted to a black and white panda body colour scheme, the car incorporates \"GTA IV\"s police computer for use in &lt;a href=\"vigilante\"&gt;vigilante&lt;/a&gt; side missions. Although the car is implied to be similar to \"GTA IV\"s Declasse-based Police Patrol, pre-rendered depictions of the Police Patrol and the Police Cruiser are used during \"&lt;a href=\"busted\"&gt;busted&lt;/a&gt;\" sequences in the game.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nFour types of police cars are seen in \"GTA V\". The first is the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, based on the second-generation &lt;a href=\"Vapid\"&gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stanier\"&gt;Stanier&lt;/a&gt;, along with a &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20Cruiser\"&gt;Sheriff variant&lt;/a&gt;. The second is the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser%20%28interceptor%29\"&gt;Vapid Interceptor&lt;/a&gt;, which is also named Police Cruiser in-game, and is the most common vehicle used by the Los Santos Police Department. The third is the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser%20%28Buffalo%29\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, which is again named Police Cruiser in game.\u00a0The fourth is the &lt;a href=\"Esperanto%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Esperanto&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"Police%20Roadcruiser\"&gt;Police Roadcruiser&lt;/a&gt;, which cannot be obtained by normal means and is only seen in the &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;Prologue&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike previous games, they are numbered randomly, varying between 00-99. These vehicles has two versions of lightbars: a modern LED lightbar, and an older rotator lightbar. The &lt;a href=\"North%20Yankton%20State%20Patrol\"&gt;North Yankton State Patrol&lt;/a&gt; Police Roadcruiser uses a second variant, a rotator lightbar that flashes side-by-side only.\nSirens in \"GTA V\" are a considerable improvement over the previous games attempts at realistic siren equipment. All police cars are equipped with four siren codes: wail, yelp and hyper, plus an air horn.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level system&lt;/a&gt; in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" is an adapted version of the one used in \"GTA V\", including the returning LSPD police vehicles used in police chases (with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser%20%28Buffalo%29\"&gt;Buffalo Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;).\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\" introduces the ability to own unique and customizable law enforcement vehicles as of update, with unique &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County\"&gt;Los Santos County&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt; liveries, which can be used to start &lt;a href=\"Dispatch%20Work\"&gt;Dispatch Work&lt;/a&gt; missions in &lt;a href=\"Free%20Mode\"&gt;Free Mode&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese vehicles are made available for purchase from &lt;a href=\"Warstock%20Cache%20%26amp%3B%20Carry\"&gt;Warstock Cache &amp; Carry&lt;/a&gt; upon completing &lt;a href=\"Slush%20Fund\"&gt;Slush Fund&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Cluckin%27%20Bell%20Farm%20Raid\"&gt;The Cluckin' Bell Farm Raid&lt;/a&gt; mission strand.\nLocations.\nPolice cars are usually parked in front of police stations and are often locked.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\n&lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", police cars can sometimes be found on stationary patrols at the &lt;a href=\"East%20Borough%20Bridge\"&gt;East Borough Bridge&lt;/a&gt; or pulling over a motorist. They can also sometimes be found pulling over a motorist on &lt;a href=\"Columbus%20Avenue\"&gt;Columbus Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, right next to &lt;a href=\"Columbus%20Cathedral\"&gt;Columbus Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "9645", "revid": "25295528", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9645", "title": "Police Cruiser", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Vapid\"&gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt; Police Cruiser is a four-door &lt;a href=\"Police%20Car\"&gt;police sedan&lt;/a&gt; appearing in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\nThe Police Cruiser is one of the two main &lt;a href=\"Police%20Car\"&gt;police cars&lt;/a&gt; used by the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City Police Department&lt;/a&gt; in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and by the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Police Department&lt;/a&gt; in \"Grand Theft Auto V\". The Police Cruiser is based on the &lt;a href=\"Vapid\"&gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stanier\"&gt;Stanier&lt;/a&gt;, the first and second-generations in \"GTA IV\" and \"GTA V\", respectively.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe first generation Police Cruiser is heavily based on the , though some aspects such as the grille more closely resemble the . Much of the design is also inspired by the , particularly in the headlight design, grille structure and some of the side profile. The dashboard instrument cluster consists of a tachometer, speedometer, fuel gauge and temperature gauge. The front and back seat are separated by a plexiglass partition, similar to taxi cabs.\nIt shares its livery design with that used on the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Patrol\"&gt;Police Patrol&lt;/a&gt; (based on that of the with its decals almost identical to those of the ). The Police Cruiser's chassis is also shared with &lt;a href=\"Vapid\"&gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Cruiser\"&gt;NOOSE Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Police Cruiser does not appear as an obtainable nor controllable car in \"\" (as the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Patrol\"&gt;Police Patrol&lt;/a&gt; is the only police car in the game), but does occasionally surface as an aesthetic element of \"&lt;a href=\"busted\"&gt;busted&lt;/a&gt;\" sequences, when a pre-rendered depiction of a modified Police Cruiser may be seen. The sequences only appears in the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20DS\"&gt;Nintendo DS&lt;/a&gt; version of the game, as in other versions, the busted cutscenes are different.\nThe vehicle also has a slick-top counterpart. While the version is only accessible with the use of mods or through the result of a spawning glitch, the model removes the external light-bar on the roof. This version lacks the lighting effects, yet still retains the siren in its usual form. The lack of its light bar makes it resemble real-life 1992 - 1997 NYPD .\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Police Cruiser returns with a modernized and lighter appearance than the \"GTA IV\" rendition, based on a 1998-2011 Crown Victoria Police Interceptor. Although the second generation is only available for police use, the first version still remains in the game as a civilian car (namely the &lt;a href=\"Stanier\"&gt;Stanier&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe Police Cruiser boasts a black and white livery with LSPD markings, and is available with either a LED emergency light bar similar to what is seen on the &lt;a href=\"Interceptor\"&gt;Interceptor&lt;/a&gt; and a rotating halogen incandescent one. The skin is modeled on the LAPD's iconic livery (obviously based on the ). The interior contains a police laptop \u201cMDT\u201d, shotgun/rifle mounts on the console, a radio, and a steel mesh partition that separates the front and back seats.\nThe vehicle may spawn with different registration and aerial identification numbers, shared with the other LSPD vehicles.\nThe second generation did not have a confirmed base name until the addition of the &lt;a href=\"Stanier%20LE%20Cruiser\"&gt;Stanier LE Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Online\", confirming this line of second generation sedans are named \"Stanier LE\". This is similar to the first generation model, which did not have a base name until the addition of the &lt;a href=\"Stanier\"&gt;Stanier&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA V\".\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Police Cruiser's high-performance engine produces an impressive amount of torque off the line, and accelerates well. It has restricted amounts of RPM, however, the RPM is still rather high for the vehicle type, considering its weight. Also, the engine feels as if it runs out of steam before the transmission switches gear. It has a higher top speed than its &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt;-branded competitor, but will not get there faster than the latest &lt;a href=\"Bravado\"&gt;Bravado&lt;/a&gt; offering.\nThe car's weakness lies in its poor suspension, as the car experiences incredible amounts of body roll and has a tendency to over steer off throttle. Stability is average at high speeds, but due to its very soft suspension the car does wallow and float about quite a bit. The car does appear to have some decent tires on it, however, which does help with improving the handling quality, if only just a bit.\nCrash deformation is also average, and the suspension does not take very long to start meandering one way or the other. The engine is not fragile, but is certainly not the toughest to destroy in the game.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\" Police Cruiser, now based on the 2nd-generation Stanier chassis, handles differently than its 1st-generation Stanier predecessor in \"GTA IV\" (the 1st-gen Stanier appears in \"GTA V\" as a civilian car). Its suspension has been heavily stiffened, making rollovers less likely on flat terrain compared to the previous generation vehicle, at the cost of some turning ability. It also seems to have slightly better acceleration than the old vehicle, but it is still nowhere near the capabilities of the new &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser%20%28interceptor%29\"&gt;Police Interceptor&lt;/a&gt; (which also goes by the in-game name \"Police Cruiser\").\nHowever, the Stanier-based Police Cruiser appears to be more strongly-built than the Police Interceptor, thanks to its body-on-frame construction affording more durability than the Interceptor's unibody monocoque. The Interceptor will take only a relative few high-speed impacts before then engine starts to smoke, and also suffers from wheel locking after a decent quarter impact. The Stanier's engine is more durable, plus it takes a much harder crash to bend the front axle to the point that the wheel locks.\nOverall, the Police Cruiser is a decent choice for a pursuit car as it is sturdy and stable enough to withstand multiple impacts while remaining controllable, and possesses good traction.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\n\"NOTE: Due to an insignificant amount of available research, the accuracy of the following locations is limited.\"\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"GTA IV\", the majority of police vehicles are fitted with &lt;a href=\"Police%20Computer\"&gt;Police Computer&lt;/a&gt;s, which can be accessed by pressing the L1 button (&lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt;), the LB button (&lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt;), or the E key (&lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;), which lets Niko perform the vigilante side-mission, hence search for the &lt;a href=\"Most%20Wanted\"&gt;most wanted criminals&lt;/a&gt;, monitor recent crimes in the area, search the police records and call for backup. Note that the latter feature is exclusive to \"GTA IV\", and as such, mini-games cannot be played in \"The Lost and Damned\" nor \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars\".\nIn \"GTA Chinatown Wars\", all police vehicles are equipped with police computers, which allow the player to access &lt;a href=\"vigilante\"&gt;vigilante&lt;/a&gt; missions."}

It is the third Buffalo-based vehicle featured, derived from the original &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Buffalo\"&gt;FIB Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe car's model remains the same as in \"TBoGT\". The livery, however, has been changed to a similar livery to most &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; vehicles to reflect its . The equipment is different as well, with a larger pushbar replacing the smaller NYPD-inspired one, and the lack of an A-pillar-mounted spotlight. The car's emergency lighting has also been updated, featuring LEDs on the grill, roof, back window and rear lights. It is unequivocally the rarest police car in the entire \"GTA\" series, since it only spawns in a certain part of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, near the &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Row%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Mission Row Police Station&lt;/a&gt;, either on patrol or in the bus stop area at night, and it is extremely rare to spawn in either circumstance.\nOriginal version.\nUnlike other LSPD vehicles, the Police Buffalo does not have a two-digit number on the roof. It is, however, the only one having a badge painted on the hood. Sometimes, a version with a low-level spoiler attached sometimes spawns as well.\nEnhanced versions.\nThe vehicle has had a makeover for the Enhanced edition of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\". Now it sports a similar livery to the older &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, including air identification numbers and the city seal on the side and a new pushbar has been added to the front bumper. However, the characteristic badge is now removed from the hood. Also, the car boasts a metallic paint finish, compared to the matte finish of the previous version. The spoiler option remains available, and the small bug with the grill-mounted blue light has been corrected (previously the housing was white).\nPerformance.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nFor performance, the Buffalo is best described as \"above average\". It will out-accelerate any other standard-issue police vehicle in the game, save for of course the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Stinger\"&gt;Police Stinger&lt;/a&gt;, which is obviously either a car or some other community-oriented policing strategy. Its top speed, engine and weight are the same as its unmarked counterpart, the &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Buffalo\"&gt;FIB Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;.\nHandling-wise, the Police Buffalo is well-balanced, and sticks to the road a bit better than the apparently aging &lt;a href=\"Vapid\"&gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt; platform that it partially replaces. Due to the RWD configuration, over-steer is very prevalent and the Buffalo's engine requires huge RPM to accommodate for it at low speeds. At high speed, the Buffalo is remarkably stable, and lift-throttle over-steer is nearly non-existent.\nCrash deformation is average. In frontal impacts, the suspension appears to be tough, but its engine only takes several good hits before it begins to smoke, making it more durable than its unmarked counterpart. It fares better than the Police Cruiser.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThere is little difference between the \"GTA IV\" variant except that the vehicle is much more durable. It does have an issue, however, in that its front axle bends easier than other Police cars, especially its Vapid competitor. It is still an excellent choice for most officers if treated right.\nLocations.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;, the Police Buffalo can be found at a majority of police stations, and is not accessible in single player.

The \"POLICE\" lettering decals on the sides of the car also resembles that of the Carbon Motors E7. The overall lighting set-up and placement of the sirens is inspired by the 2011 Ford Police Interceptor Sedan concept car, with the only exception being the main lightbar on the roof, which uses the same red &amp; blue LED light bar as other police vehicles in the game.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIt shares its siren sounds with all other LSPD police vehicles in the game, with the main tone as an edited &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Djge_BZ6CTkg\"&gt;Federal Signal PA20A&lt;/a&gt;, and the yelp and priority tone/speed wail as an edited &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D1IpZUHKASP8\"&gt;Galls Roadmaster&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe car features a black and white color scheme, with large \"POLICE\" lettering on either side and the unit number on the roof, and is equipped with a red and blue roof-mounted LED light bar. It also features a A-pillar mounted spotlight, functional with the vehicle's high-beams, which can be broken off in a collision.\nThe interior contains shotgun/rifle mounts on the console, a radio, and a steel mesh partition that separates the front and back seats. In the enhanced versions of the game, the vehicle's interior is shared with a number of sedans, such as the &lt;a href=\"Stanier\"&gt;Stanier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fugitive\"&gt;Fugitive&lt;/a&gt;.

Acceleration, braking and handling are good, but durability is poor. The engine cannot sustain as much damage as that of the Stanier-based model, and the vehicle deforms easily, especially around the front wheels. The engine sound is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Buffalo\"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser%20%28Buffalo%29\"&gt;police variant&lt;/a&gt;."}

From \"GTA V\", the Police Maverick is no longer based on the standard &lt;a href=\"Maverick%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; and assumes a more modern design. \nLike previous titles, the Police Maverick will pursue the player when they have a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level\"&gt;Wanted Level&lt;/a&gt; of three or more stars.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Police Maverick in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and its remains as an adaptation of the regular Maverick, with its design also based on that of the Bell 206. The livery is loosely based on those used on a previous generation of , but with a reversed color scheme. The Police Maverick has a searchlight on the nose and, unlike its civilian or &lt;a href=\"Helitours%20Maverick\"&gt;Helitours&lt;/a&gt; counterpart, features sidesteps on the rear bay doors. Color distribution is different to that of the regular Maverick, appearing in a white primary color for most of the fuselage and tail boom, and a secondary color for the engine compartment, part of the tail boom, and in the form of thin stripes passing on the sides. It also bears the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; markings, with \"POLICE\" text on the nose and tail boom.\nReplacing the original \"invisible\" machine gun under the fuselage, there are two Police Officers seated on both sides of the helicopter, programmed to shoot the player with &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt;s (or &lt;a href=\"Combat%20MG\"&gt;Advanced MGs&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\"), with &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tactical%20Response%20Unit\"&gt;TRU&lt;/a&gt; agents replacing police officers in Mavericks at four stars (provided that the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; does not respond). The ability to deploy units has been removed from the game and, unlike in the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, it may be replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt; from higher &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted levels&lt;/a&gt;, from five stars and above.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars\".\nThe Police Maverick has the same design as the \"GTA IV\" rendition, except that it is uncontrollable and uses a more traditional livery, being a thin blue stripe on the lower side and the \"POLICE\" text below the front door windows. It also has the same machine gun mounted as in the 3D Universe games, unlike \"GTA IV\". It is obtainable through a secret method in the mission &lt;a href=\"Payback%20%28GTA%20Chinatown%20Wars%29\"&gt;Payback&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Police Maverick has been redesigned with a modern appearance, based on the French . The livery is based on the design of the one used on the .\nThe aircraft assumes a completely different design and is no longer based on the regular Maverick, although given its name, it is implied to be a newer generation of the aforementioned vehicle (something seen with multiple vehicles in the same game). The front section is rather triangular in shape and is predominated by large windows, along with two access doors on the sides and a searchlight/camera below, similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;Frogger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;. Similar to the aforementioned aircraft, only NPC-operated Police Mavericks can use the searchlight, and players that sit on the copilot seat can use the camera to look around and tag other players.\nThe main section has a large bay with sliding doors that are always open, small side steps for access, and long skids on the underside, while the upper area has a tall engine compartment with two large exhausts, a three-bladed main rotor and two mounted winches, which can be used by either NOOSE TRU officers or other players in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\". The tail boom is relatively long and features a strike guard below, large vertical stabilizers and small horizontal stabilizers, as well as a two-bladed tail rotor on the left.\nThe interior of the aircraft is similar than that of the Maverick, being a large flight instrument panel in the center. In the enhanced version, it uses the \"Flyer\" dial set that is also used on the Maverick and the Buzzard.\nThe aircraft is only available in a white primary color with a black livery texture on the front section and tail boom, along with &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; markings on the sides and below the aircraft, with the LSPD emblem partially seen behind the sliding doors.\nAccording to its functionality and the pilot during the mission &lt;a href=\"Eye%20in%20the%20Sky\"&gt;Eye in the Sky&lt;/a&gt;, the mounted camera allows the user to identify individuals by reading RFID transmitters placed in &lt;a href=\"2012\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt; San Andreas driver licenses. It is marked with the zoom bar, the direction, the height, and the LSPD name marked in a corner. It can activate a microphone to hear distant conversations and is implemented with thermal vision (much like &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifles\"&gt;Sniper Rifles&lt;/a&gt; in missions). The limitations of the device include a signal lost when the objective is hiding behind a solid structure unless thermal vision is used. In the enhanced version of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", some missions require the player to scan license plates of vehicles.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Police Maverick appears to have a similar performance to its civilian counterpart, being easy to control, useful for navigating through the city. Its single engine provides good power output for its blades, allowing for controllable movements, at the cost of being rather slow compared to the powerplant of the &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt; or the small size of the &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, the Police Maverick performs averagely, just like the standard version.\nBecause of the rather exposed cockpit, the front occupants may get shot from enemies in tall places or armed with assault rifles, considering the lower windows may be a weak spot for them when flying above these.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Police Maverick has mediocre performance compared to other helicopters. However, as a freely available helicopter, it can be used for quick extractions or escapes. The aircraft is fairly maneuverable and has a descent airspeed. However, the Police Maverick's speed falls short of luxury helicopters such as the &lt;a href=\"Swift\"&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt; or attack helicopters like the &lt;a href=\"FH-1%20Hunter\"&gt;FH-1 Hunter&lt;/a&gt;. Its climbing rate remains average for a transport helicopter and has an average weight.\nThe helicopter is unarmored and only two shots from the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper\"&gt;Heavy Sniper&lt;/a&gt; will be enough to damage the engine, although it can fly for a little over two minutes before the engine completely fails. Just like every other unarmored helicopter, the Police Maverick will be destroyed in only one hit from a standard explosive. Against the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper Mk II&lt;/a&gt; equipped with explosive rounds, the helicopter will only take two to three hits. Because of its decent maneuverability, the Police Maverick is able to avoid standard homing missiles but, just like all helicopters without countermeasures, fails to avoid missiles with better tracking fired from the vehicles such as the: &lt;a href=\"Deluxo\"&gt;Deluxo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oppressor%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Oppressor Mk II&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Ruiner%202000\"&gt;Ruiner 2000&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the open cockpit, the front occupants are very exposed to gunfire. The tail of the helicopter can be shot to destroy it more quickly.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Police Maverick does not spawn on top of police stations like in previous games, so the only way to obtain one is by using the using one of two methods:\nIf the player manages to lure the helicopter over the pond in Middle Park, it will be easier to &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DCZakpGUpz0U\"&gt;obtain&lt;/a&gt;, although the helicopter must have an open space and the water must be shallow."}

Officers of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Police Department&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Police%20Department\"&gt;San Fierro Police Department&lt;/a&gt; wear a uniform consisting of a dark navy blue short sleeved shirt, and dark navy blue pants. Officers of the &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20Police%20Department\"&gt;Las Venturas Police Department&lt;/a&gt; wear a similar uniform, except that it consists of tan/beige clothing. The police officers in rural &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; wear a uniform consisting of a dark brown short sleeved shirt and tan/beige pants; they often wear a typical \"sheriff\" hat as well. They are armed with a nightstick and a pistol, as well as a shotgun, which they use when the player has a 3-star or higher wanted level. The &lt;a href=\"Motor%20officer\"&gt;motorcycle cops&lt;/a&gt; are always African-American, and always look the same, regardless of region. They wear white helmets, black sunglasses, a leather jacket, and black pants with a yellow stripe on the side of either leg. They are armed with a nightstick and pistol.\nHD Universe.\n\"GTA IV\", Episodes and \"GTA Chinatown Wars\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the cops have uniforms similar to those worn by NYPD officers in real life, and there is also a lot of variation in terms of clothing. The overall uniform consists of a dark blue long sleeved or short sleeved shirt, dark blue pants, and a dark blue hat. Cops will often have dark blue jackets on as well. When it is raining, police officers wear a black rain jacket over their uniforms with a yellow 'LCPD' on the back. They are armed with a pistol, although some officers will use a shotgun when the player has a higher wanted level. Officers guarding an area, such as those atop and near the &lt;a href=\"Rotterdam%20Tower\"&gt;Rotterdam Tower&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Civilization%20Committee\"&gt;Civilization Committee&lt;/a&gt; will use the &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe LSPD officers in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" wear black, tucked in, short-sleeved shirts, long black pants with a belt and a generic black police hat. They also have a badge on their shirts. For the first time in the GTA series, female police officers appear and act the same as their male counterparts, even having their own dialogue. However, they are rare, only appearing in certain locations. Common spawn places for female officers include the &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Row%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Mission Row Police Station&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Sheriff%27s%20Station\"&gt;Sandy Shores Sheriff's Station&lt;/a&gt;. The officers are more interactive and, during combat, can pull an injured officer into cover, and are more lethal than previous games."}

Like the Cruiser, the Patrol's livery is clearly based on those of the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//img223.imageshack.us/img223/805/ajmnypd1328tn6.jpg\"&gt;New York Police Department's vehicles&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Police Patrol is the police version of the &lt;a href=\"Merit\"&gt;Merit&lt;/a&gt;, featuring the same equipment as on its &lt;a href=\"Vapid\"&gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt; counterpart, the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;. Like the latter, it serves as one of the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt;'s primary patrol vehicles, and its usage may vary during the game.\nThe vehicle also features a slick-top counterpart, like the Police Cruiser. While it is unobtainable without the use of a trainer to access its relevant file, the model removes the roof-mounted light-bar, but still allowing its sirens. The lighting effect around the vehicle is also removed. The slick-top is influenced by the real-life NYPD &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.policeny.com/bui/ImpalaSTr%2520%28Custom%29.JPG\"&gt;Chevrolet Impala slick-tops&lt;/a&gt; used in New York. Both the standard and the slick-top versions, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Merit\"&gt;Merit&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"Taxi%20%28Merit%29\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt;, feature radio aerials. These aerials are more visible on the slicktop variant due to the lack of emergency lights on the roof (while on the Taxi, these can be seen with the roof sign removed by crashing onto an obstacle).\nGrand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars.\nIn \"\", the Patrol bears -style markings, rather than the LCPD-style, making the car more immediately recognizable as a police car via the DS interface; the car also incorporates GTA IV's police computer for use in vigilante side missions, and being the defacto police car in the game, it is the fastest sedan-based law-enforcement vehicle in the game, with responsive controls and good durability.\nIn cutscenes, the car in its \"GTA IV\" form may be seen (alongside the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;), but is depicted with omitted rear quarter glasses.\nThe PSP depiction of the Police Patrol in GTA CW looks more similar to its \"GTA IV\" counterpart. It differs in which \"LCPD\" is written on the roof the car, unlike the DS/iOS versions.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Patrol, as the name implies, is generally used as a patrol vehicle rather than a pursuit vehicle, due to it being slower than the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, however the acceleration is about the same and both has the same mass (1,700 kg). The Police Patrol has good handling, with minimal spin and smooth turning, but has a tendency to roll over whilst turning at high speed.\nJust like the &lt;a href=\"Merit\"&gt;Merit&lt;/a&gt;, it is powered by a modelled twin-cam inline-4 engine, positioned in a front-engine, rear wheel drive configuration.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn \"\", the Police Patrol returns with a much better overall performance. Handling is now significantly greater, thanks to an improved suspension stability system, giving the car some great, nimble handling at average speeds. Its top speed can be reached in a matter of seconds, thanks to an impressive amount of acceleration and great traction. Braking is also acceptable, and from top speed, takes only as long as acceleration to come to a complete halt.\nHandling at high speeds is still impressive, and the vehicle can easily be controlled in the hands of an expert, even despite the oversteer present at these speeds.\nOne major disadvantage is the car's durability; a few major frontal collisions is all it takes before the car begins to smoke, eventually leading to a loss in acceleration and a limit to its top speed.\nOn the whole, the performance of the Police Patrol in GTA CW is well above average, and it appears to be mislead by how the LCPD appear to use it, where they limit their ability for speed during pursuits."}

It usually only spawns when the player has a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level\"&gt;Wanted Level&lt;/a&gt; near or in water. In later games, the Police Predator can sometimes be seen patrolling coastal areas.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe \"GTA IV\" appearance of the boat strongly resembles a , seen in the hull length, cabin area and vented details on the back, as well as the radar equipment and frame positioning.\nThe vehicle retains the general layout from previous iterations, but appears to take the appearance of a small patrol watercraft, with an enlarged, wider body. The front of the boat features two cleats and hand rails. An &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; emblem is found on the trunk cabin, and on either side underneath the cabin side windows. LCPD text is found on the roof and POLICE markings along the platform coaming. The platform coaming also features hand rails. The washboard also features two aerials. Various naval accessories and a lamp are mounted onto the roof, and fenders are hung along the sides. Unlike previous renditions, the vehicle lacks any mounted weaponry. \nThe boat assigns a white primary color for most of the body, while a blue secondary color is applied on the lower hull and the gunwales.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Police Predator returns with an identical design to that of the \"GTA IV\" rendition, but slight changes were made. The \"POLICE\" markings are again found on the side, and \"Dial 911\" markings are seen along the top. The LSPD emblem is found on the trunk cabin and more \"POLICE\" text is seen on the radar. The lamp on the roof can be toggled on and off, like any watercraft.\nColor distribution is the same as in \"GTA IV\", but the secondary color is set to black.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Police Predator is rather heavy compared to other speedboats such as the &lt;a href=\"Jetmax\"&gt;Jetmax&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Squalo\"&gt;Squalo&lt;/a&gt;, but is still a good choice thanks to its acceleration, top speed and handling. While the machine guns are absent on the HD Universe version, the Police Predator seems to be less sensitive to collisions and gunfire, given the general design and purpose.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Police Predator has impressive performance thanks to its powerful engines. The boat has mild steering which often \"oversteers\" (a bad radius issue with its props). The boat has reasonable acceleration and is not slowed down dramatically by waves or general current, however its stability while stationary in the water is often loose and therefore the boat has a tendency to move around unintentionally.\nAccording to the files, the Police Predator is equipped with a radar in the manner as a mounted weapon, though does not serve any purpose and is likely made for the spin animation."}

The vehicle shares the same design and features as the regular version, but is covered in snow in the upper surfaces, bumpers and windows. The roof has two antenna and a square-shaped lightbar with six rotating halogen emergency lights on it. Like the snowy variant of the Rancher XL, the vehicle does not feature a defroster rear window, and has a rear compartment handle not present on the regular version.\nThe vehicle is only available in a white color with NYSP markings around, consisting of gold and blue stripes down the side, \"STATE PATROL\" on the front fenders and the emblem emblazoned on the front doors, as well as \"Trooper of the year &lt;a href=\"1951\"&gt;1951&lt;/a&gt;\" markings on the rearmost sections of the sides. It uses the same wheel design as the snowy variant of the Rancher XL, being a derivative of the \"Raider\" off-road rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, fitted with tire chains to improve control while driving on snowy surfaces (however, this is purely cosmetic). These tire models are shared with the Police Rancher's &lt;a href=\"Rancher%20XL%20%28snow%29\"&gt;civilian variant&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\nAlthough normally unobtainable in-game, the Police Rancher's performance is a sort of 'hybrid' between the normal Rancher XL and the game's numerous police vehicles. Despite being an off-road vehicle, the Police Rancher is surprisingly nimble.\nMost of its properties are shared with that of the normal Rancher XL, sporting an inline-4 engine with a 5-speed gearbox and an all-wheel drivetrain (30-70, front to rear). The engine's noise is different compared to the standard Rancher XL, being similar to SUVs like the &lt;a href=\"Granger\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Baller\"&gt;Baller&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is also based, to a lesser extent, on the , due to the van-style design and roof, which has some resemblance to that of the &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Stockade&lt;/a&gt;. It also takes a large amount of inspiration from the .\nDesign.\nThe Police Riot is used by the &lt;a href=\"Tactical%20Response%20Unit\"&gt;Tactical Response Unit&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;National Office of Security Enforcement&lt;/a&gt;, featuring NOOSE markings and a NOOSE seal on its sides and rear, as well as the initials \"&lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt;\" on its front and on the doors. Because of its use as a law enforcement vehicle, the Police Riot features bulletproof armor and netting; the side windows are also shatter-proof, but not completely bulletproof. It also possesses an LED lightbar and small lights on both ends of the vehicle. The rear features two small holes under the doors that seem to possess the use of riot gear like &lt;a href=\"Tear%20Gas\"&gt;tear gas&lt;/a&gt;, though these cannot be used.\nIt is likely the successor of \"GTA IV\"s &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;, since both are used by the same law enforcement agency, share similar designs, and are manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Brute\"&gt;Brute&lt;/a&gt;. They also share the same engine sounds, top speeds, acceleration times, and chassis design. Also, a glitch involving wheel textures or their inserts exists on both of the trucks, implying it was simply copied over to \"GTA V\". The only change is the square-shaped hood and the ability to carry more personnel on its sides.\nThe truck's hood cannot be opened or detached from the rest of the vehicle.\nPerformance.\nThe Police Riot possesses an average top speed for a truck or sedan, being around the 105 mph mark. Since it weighs several tons, acceleration is abysmal, as it can take up to 10 seconds to reach an average speed.\nBraking is acceptable, while needed to make quick arrests and blockades. The wide wheelbase provides good lateral stability, although it does not take corners fast enough to truly test this. The Police Riot is double-wheeled at the rear, to help hold its large capabilities of weight. The truck carries a simple front-engine, rear wheel drive layout. It otherwise shares the same capabilities as the &lt;a href=\"Stockade\"&gt;Stockade&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe main advantages for the Police Riot are its mass and overall power, being tough enough to withstand heavy gunfire and many head-on collisions. It can withstand most gunfire for sustained periods, and even a &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bomb\"&gt;sticky bomb&lt;/a&gt; won't destroy it unless it is in contact or directly underneath the vehicle. &lt;a href=\"Molotov%20Cocktails\"&gt;Molotovs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Can\"&gt;gasoline&lt;/a&gt; are ineffective against it. Only multiple &lt;a href=\"grenades\"&gt;grenades&lt;/a&gt; can deal any damage. &lt;a href=\"RPG\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt; shots and &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt; shells can instantly destroy it, however. Trying to kill occupants while they are still inside is a lost cause, as almost all windows are bulletproof from the outside, making it a great vehicle to steal and use during high wanted levels if it is available."}

This feature, however, was not carried over to \"\" and \".\" In \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\", it is\u00a0easier for the player to escape as there are laced gaps between neighboring vehicles, secured only by easy-to-be-rammed-through barriers, that even leave the player's car nearly undamaged. GTA 2 also introduced &lt;a href=\"Special%20Weapons%20and%20Tactics\"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"military\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; roadblocks.\n3D Universe.\nRoadblocks are featured in all of the games in the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, with the exception of \"GTA Liberty City Stories\". In ' and ', the police will set up &lt;a href=\"Spike%20Strip\"&gt;stingers&lt;/a&gt; and driving over them will result in bursting the players tires and the player will be unable to drive the car properly. In\u00a0\"\", in the initial cutscene of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Puncture%20Wounds\"&gt;Puncture Wounds&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0there is a reference to the police using stingers, but they never actually set them up as a part of a roadblock.\nDepending of the &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, some variations will occur during the pursuit. For a 2 stars level, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Car\"&gt;police cars&lt;/a&gt; are placed on the road and some police officers will be waiting to shoot the player. For a 3 stars level, there would be officers deploying &lt;a href=\"Spike%20Strip\"&gt;spike strips&lt;/a&gt; in order to pop the vehicle's tires. For a 4 stars level, &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;transport vans&lt;/a&gt; are used, which would be heavy for some basic cars. For a 5 stars level, &lt;a href=\"FBI%20Rancher\"&gt;undercover SUVs&lt;/a&gt; are used, which are lighter than the vans, but are still heavy for basic cars. Finally, for a 6 star level, &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;military transport trucks&lt;/a&gt; are used, being even heavier for most vehicle's classes.\n\"GTA IV\" \u2013 \"GTA Chinatown Wars\".\nThe changes from the previous games to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;GTA IV&lt;/a&gt;\"\u00a0are much of the same but the Police will set up roadblocks on main bridges (those that connects the main islands) and the &lt;a href=\"Booth%20Tunnel\"&gt;Booth Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;, on each entrance. On a locked island, they will put concrete block and a vehicle on each side preventing the player to pass through the bridge. This only occurs when the player has not unlocked all of the islands, although only the bridges to &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; are blocked because the only way to &lt;a href=\"Happiness%20Island\"&gt;Happiness Island&lt;/a&gt; is by helicopter or boat. Any attempt to cross these roadblocks will result in a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; of 6 stars.\nOn a normal gameplay, every time that the player makes a wanted level of 3 stars, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; will start deploying their vehicles to make a roadblock, which is generally composed by the vehicle that is pursuing (&lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Cruiser\"&gt;NOOSE Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Patriot\"&gt;NOOSE Patriot&lt;/a&gt;). When the same reaches 4 stars, there would be either &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Patrol\"&gt;Police Patrol&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s, which the later two are only placed if the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; is pursuing the player. As seen in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;GTA 2&lt;/a&gt;\", there are various easy-to-be-rammed-through barriers.\n\"GTA V\".\nPolice Roadblocks reappear in\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\"; however, they are slightly different.\nSometimes when the player has a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;2 star wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0will form roadblocks using their\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser%20%28interceptor%29\"&gt;Interceptors&lt;/a&gt;. They are usually made of 1 to 2 cars, with officers pointing their weapons at the player, and cones/police barriers blocking the road. On three wanted stars,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Police%20Transporter\"&gt;Police Transporter&lt;/a&gt;s will be seen\u00a0blocking two lanes of the road, with the opposite side being able to easily pass. However, when a Police Transporter is spotted blocking the road, there will usually be a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Spike%20Strip\"&gt;Spike Strip&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0after it, causing anyone to pass the van to be vulnerable to tires to been popped, losing control of the car, however, this can be avoided by fitting Bulletproof Tires to the car. In addition, if the player is close to pursuing units, the units will try and get ahead of the player and swerve in front of them, trying to slow the player down. Once the player passes the Police Transporter roadblock, the officer usually gets into the van, and begins to pursue the player. On four and five stars,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0will sometimes deploy\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Police%20Riot\"&gt;Police Riot&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0to block the road, again, up to 5 Police Riots can be seen forming roadblocks on highways. These only usually appear when the use of explosives is used as a deterrent against police. If in a different case, standard &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20Cruiser\"&gt;Sheriff Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s will continue to form road blocks.\nNote that not all roadblocks are always the same. For example, for a basic roadblock, two police cars are placed perpendicularly on the road, facing at the same orientation, while in another circumstance, a police car would be oriented straight to the road, surrounded by some traffic cones and some police officers ready to shoot the player. Unlike former games, any police officer will get in the vehicle that was set on the roadblock if the same fails to stop the player. Roadblocks on the highway are usually much larger, also dependent on the star occupied. Sometimes, up to 5 Police Cruisers can be seen blocking an entire side of a highway. These roadblocks can rarely be seen used on larger avenues within the city.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"military\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; aren't part of the &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level system&lt;/a&gt;, there are no roadblocks composed by their vehicles, even near the &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;military base&lt;/a&gt;. However, there is one exception to this (see below).\nRoadblocks during Missions.\nDuring missions and heists, roadblocks are generally weaker, or larger. In &lt;a href=\"The%20Jewel%20Store%20Job\"&gt;The Jewel Store Job&lt;/a&gt;, a road block can be seen formed in the LS River. In &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;The Big Score&lt;/a&gt;, roadblocks can be seen cornering up to three intersections in Rockford Hills, however this can only be seen apparent when the Subtle approach is chosen. In &lt;a href=\"The%20Fleeca%20Job\"&gt;The Fleeca Job&lt;/a&gt;, roadblocks are unusually made up of &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20SUV\"&gt;Sheriff SUV&lt;/a&gt;s. Also, roadblocks over the river within the &lt;a href=\"Cassidy%20Creek\"&gt;Cassidy Creek&lt;/a&gt; area can be seen made of &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Granger\"&gt;FIB Granger&lt;/a&gt;s during &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Standard%20-%20Signal\"&gt;Pacific Standard - Signal&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"The%20Pacific%20Standard%20Job\"&gt;The Pacific Standard Job&lt;/a&gt;, a road block can be seen made up of two Police Cruisers and a large ramp at one side. Also during this mission, Sheriff SUVs can be found blocking the entrance to a tunnel in the &lt;a href=\"Chiliad%20Mountain%20State%20Wilderness\"&gt;Chiliad Mountain State Wilderness&lt;/a&gt;. Also, during &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Standard%20-%20Convoy\"&gt;Pacific Standard - Convoy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt; can be seen forming military roadblocks using &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mesa%20%28off-road%29\"&gt;Mesas&lt;/a&gt;. This is the only time Military roadblocks are seen in game.\nAnother type of roadblock can be seen during &lt;a href=\"Series%20A%20-%20Bikers\"&gt;Series A - Bikers&lt;/a&gt;, they consist of gang vehicles, such as &lt;a href=\"Slamvan\"&gt;Slamvan&lt;/a&gt;s, blocking parts of the road."}

The vehicle shares the same design and features as the regular version, but features blacked-out trim, and is covered in snow in the upper surfaces, bumpers and windows. The Albany logo in the center of the trunk has been removed to make room for police markings.\nThe car features an all-white color with gold and blue stripes down the side, \"STATE PATROL\" on the fenders and trunk, and the police emblem emblazoned on the front doors. \"Trooper of the year &lt;a href=\"1951\"&gt;1951&lt;/a&gt;\" markings can be seen on the rear portions.\nThe vehicle sports a unique light bar bearing four emergency lights, spot lights mounted on the A-pillars and two antennas on the roof. It also features chains on its tires for better grip on snowy and icy streets, although they are purely cosmetic."}

{"id": "123777", "revid": "38527717", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=123777", "title": "Police Scanner", "text": "The\u00a0police scanner, also known as the\u00a0police radio, or police dispatch, is a feature in most \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" titles, with the exception of\u00a0',\u00a0', \"\", and\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\nGeneral.\nUpon gaining a wanted level, the dispatch will go off, which the player can hear. The police will announce the crime being committed, and will announce the player's location, saying something along the lines of \"We have a (codename of crime) in north, west, etc. (location)\". If the player is fleeing in a vehicle, the dispatch will say something like: \"Suspect last seen in a (color of car) (type of car)\".\nUnique to \"/\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", \"\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" is the appearance of a female dispatch operator.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the police scanner has changed dynamically. Now, the dispatch will announce how many police cars will be dispatched to the crime scene (\"Dispatch (number of units) units from (location)\", \"Dispatch air unit from (location)\"), etc. In this game, the dispatch does not use codenames (such as 10-92, 10-24, etc.), and will instead announce the actual name of the crime (reckless driver, helicopter down, shots fired, &lt;a href=\"Carjacking\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;, etc.). Debuting in this game is names for every &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Street%20Names\"&gt;street&lt;/a&gt;, which the dispatch will also identify the player on.\nSimilar to \"Grand Theft Auto III\", the dispatch may have some unique calls in certain missions. For example, in &lt;a href=\"Three%20Leaf%20Clover\"&gt;Three Leaf Clover&lt;/a&gt;, the dispatch reports the robbery at the &lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20Liberty\"&gt;Bank of Liberty&lt;/a&gt;, and how the &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;sus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McReary\"&gt;pec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"Derrick%20McReary\"&gt;ts&lt;/a&gt; are armed and dangerous.\nThe same dispatch reappears in\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\" and\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", with some new dialogue recorded exclusively for the two episodes. If &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Fernando Lopez&lt;/a&gt; causes trouble at any of the two &lt;a href=\"Hercules\"&gt;night&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"Maisonette%209\"&gt;clubs&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;, the dispatch will announce a \"disturbance at the nightclub in &lt;a href=\"Westminster\"&gt;Westminster&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Purgatory\"&gt;Purgatory&lt;/a&gt;\", and asks for units to check on the scene.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe police scanner reappears in\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", building upon the upgrades from \"GTA IV\". The dispatch once again uses codenames and the number of units dispatched to the scene.\nDebuting in this game is the ability to hear other police officers communicate with each other. The officers may ask if anybody has a visual on the suspect, and confirm with the dispatch that they have found them, to which the main dispatch may respond \"Roger that\". Helicopter pilots can also be heard, who will announce when/if the player is in their sight, and shout when their helicopter is about to be destroyed.\nThe police scanner is generally absent in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", but could be heard again during .\nVehicles.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe police scanner will identify the vehicle the player is driving when they are &lt;a href=\"Wanted\"&gt;Wanted&lt;/a&gt;. Each vehicle has a manufacturer, model and a category which the police scanner will use to identify it. They may also prefix the vehicle with its apparent color, for example, \"\"a red &lt;a href=\"Grotti\"&gt;Grotti&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Turismo\"&gt;Turismo&lt;/a&gt;\". Any two of the three parts of the vehicle's scanner information can be used interchangeably, for example, \"a Grotti sports car\", \"a Grotti Turismo\" or \"a Turismo sports car\"\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe police scanner's ability to identify a vehicle by its colour, manufacturer and model returns to \"GTA V\", largely the same, however multiple vehicles can now share other vehicles' scanner information. The scanner may also now pick, at random, between several phrases for one single term, i.e, \"Rig, semi-truck and truck\" all fit under an internal \"codice_1\" category, providing more variation. The vehicle's color may also be permanently overridden, even if the player manages to respray the vehicle, however this only applies to variants of the &lt;a href=\"Boxville\"&gt;Boxville&lt;/a&gt;, which cannot be customized.\nThe police scanner does not identify planes or bicycles. Certain vehicles may not have their model name read out, even despite being listed, due a flag in the scanner information's data. This applies to several police and military vehicles:\nAs the police scanner is not present in \"GTA Online\", vehicles exclusive to \"GTA Online\" do not have their scanner information read out, but they are still listed in the audio data and generally match up to the vehicle's in-game manufacturer and body style.\nDispatch Codes.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nThere's a 10-11 in northwest &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Campus\"&gt;Liberty Campus&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nWe got a 10-77 in central &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Downtown&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nRespond to a 10-37 in east &lt;a href=\"Juniper%20Hill\"&gt;Juniper Hill&lt;/a&gt;, suspect last seen in a red four-door.\nUnique Dispatch Calls.\nThe police scanner has several unique dispatch calls only occurring within &lt;a href=\"missions\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt; in certain games."}
