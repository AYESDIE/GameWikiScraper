The game was originally released on November 28th, &lt;a href=\"1997\"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;, for &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; and December 14th, 1997, for &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%201\"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Color\"&gt;Game Boy Color&lt;/a&gt; port developed by &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Lincoln\"&gt;Tarantula Studios&lt;/a&gt; released on November 22nd, &lt;a href=\"1999\"&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt;. It is also one of the 20 preloaded games on the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%20Classic\"&gt;PlayStation Classic&lt;/a&gt; console, released in December &lt;a href=\"2018\"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;.\n' was made as an expansion pack for \"GTA\", and ' was in turn an expansion pack for \"London 1969\". Both of these games require the original \"GTA\" disc to work.\nThe game is set in &lt;a href=\"1997\"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt; in three American cities: &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; (including its neighbouring &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20New%20Guernsey\"&gt;state of New Guernsey&lt;/a&gt; as part of the same map), &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;. The player chooses the role of one of &lt;a href=\"Protagonists%20in%20GTA%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;a group of eight silent criminals&lt;/a&gt;, four males and four females, looking to work their way up the career ladder of the cities' organized crime.\nThe project was originally named as \"&lt;a href=\"Race%27n%27Chase\"&gt;Race'n'Chase&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPlot.\nThe story revolves around a &lt;a href=\"Protagonists%20in%20GTA%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;silent criminal&lt;/a&gt; hired by the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"Vercotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Vercotti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; to assist in their &lt;a href=\"Gangsta%20Bang\"&gt;various crimes&lt;/a&gt;, as a hired goon and as a getaway driver for bank jobs. Later, they help take down the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20New%20Guernsey\"&gt;New Guernsey&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"Sonetti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Sonetti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;'s crime operation.\nEventually, after attaining too much attention from the cops, Bubby books the protagonist a flight to &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, where they are hired by a &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Fu%27s%20Crime%20Syndicate\"&gt;Chinese crime syndicate&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Fu\"&gt;Uncle Fu&lt;/a&gt;, and the protagonist helps them in expanding their crime businesses throughout the city. They are later introduced to the &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt; gangster &lt;a href=\"El%20Burro%20%28GTA%29\"&gt;El Burro&lt;/a&gt;, helping him and his &lt;a href=\"El%20Burro%27s%20Gang\"&gt;gang&lt;/a&gt; in several criminal activities and killing suspected traitors of the gang.\nThey later decide to move to &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;, where they are &lt;a href=\"Bent%20Cop%20Blues%20-%20Introduction\"&gt;blackmailed&lt;/a&gt; by the corrupt &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Squad%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice Squad&lt;/a&gt; officer &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Deever\"&gt;Samuel Deever&lt;/a&gt; to do his dirty work, claiming he's got evidence of all of the protagonist's previous crimes that would put them in jail for life. They are forced to help Deever start a war against the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Jah%20Army%20of%20Love\"&gt;Brotherhood of Jah Army of Love&lt;/a&gt; (also known as the Rastas), a &lt;a href=\"Jamaica\"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt;n gang who have been waging a campaign of terror for over 7 years. The gang's leader &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Marcus\"&gt;Brother Marcus&lt;/a&gt; eventually convinces them to join forces with the Rastas by giving them a lot of protection against Deever and his squad.\nAfter doing several jobs for Brother Marcus and helping his gang, Brother Marcus calls the protagonist one last time, asking them to meet him &lt;a href=\"Rasta%20Blasta%20-%20Ending\"&gt;to collect their retirement pay&lt;/a&gt;, implying the end of the protagonist's career as a criminal.\nGameplay.\nThe original \"Grand Theft Auto\" is made up of a series of levels each set in one of the three cities in the game. In each level, the player has a target number of points to achieve, and five lives to attain the score.\nThe score counter doubles as a money meter; the player can spend this money on paint jobs and various other things. However, any money spent is of course taken away from the score, making the goal that little bit further away.\nOn obtaining the target number of points, the player must then drive to a certain location to complete the level, which allows progress to the next one.\nApart from that, the player is free to do whatever they want. The player can just explore the city, cause death and destruction, or steal and sell cars for profit, although completing a level will almost certainly require the completion of missions. Even in missions there is still some freedom, as usually the player is free to choose the route to take, although the destination is usually fixed. This level of freedom was not found in most action-based computer games at the time. Be mindful that free roam has its limits (unlike &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;\"Grand Theft Auto III\"&lt;/a&gt; and its successors), most notable having a limited number of lives, as once the player loses lives by becoming repeatedly &lt;a href=\"wasted\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt;, they will be redirected to the results. And unlike the later games in the series, the player can be killed in one hit unless they are wearing body armor (though it only protects them from bullet fire).\nWeapons.\nThere are some burps and farts too, as specials, but have no effect on any enemy and pedestrians.\nEarning points.\nThere are various ways in which to earn the points needed to complete each level.\nSome points can be earned by committing various crimes, such as ramming cars (10 points each), and killing police (1000 each). The more serious the crime, the more points, but also the more the police will pay attention to the player. Another way to make money is to steal cars, and sell them at the many docks around each city, usually earning several thousand points.\nThese activities can give the player quite a number of points but they are not sufficient to earn the millions of points needed to complete each level (unless the player has a lot of patience), so it is necessary to take on missions to complete a level. On successful completion of a mission, the player gets 'paid', a large amount of points. A typical payment is in the region of 50,000 points.\nAlso after completing a mission, the score multiplier is increased by one. The score multiplier is multiplied by the normal score for something, to get the points actually awarded. For example a multiplier of three will mean that the player gets three time the regular amount of points, so 30 points for ramming a car, rather than the normal 10 points. This applies for anything points are awarded for, including the payment for completing a mission.\nIn the Gameboy port, score multipliers are handled differently. The player can collect floating \"X\"'s hidden in each city, that automatically add a multiplier to the score counter. The first time one is picked up it says \"\u00d72\", the second time it says \"\u00d73\", and so on. This only affects points gained after acquiring the multiplier, not the points the player already has, so it is in the player's best interests to seek the \"X\"'s as soon as possible. Multiplier does not disappear if the player is arrested in this port.\nLocations.\nThe three cities in which the game is set are modeled after certain cities, in terms of landscape and style. They are &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; () including its neighboring &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20New%20Guernsey\"&gt;State of New Guernsey&lt;/a&gt; (), &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; (), and &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt; ().\nThose three cities later became the settings for the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D era games&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD era games&lt;/a&gt;. In , San Andreas is expanded from a city to an &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;American state&lt;/a&gt;, which contains three major cities of its own: &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; (Los Angeles), &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; (San Francisco) and &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt; (Las Vegas). The state of New Guernsey later became the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;State of Alderney&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\".\nMissions.\nIn most cases, missions are started by answering telephones, although some missions are allocated on the spot, or are triggered by entering certain vehicles. Once a phone is touched, the player is stuck doing that mission until they pass or fail it, but with the cars it is different. The player is told \"I've got a new job for you, if you want it. Otherwise get the hell out of my car.\" They then have a few seconds to jump out before that mission begins.\nThe payphones all stop ringing while a player is on a phone mission, but the car missions are still available. By accepting a car mission the player can override a phone mission (failing it but without a failure notice) and do that mission instead, but a phone mission cannot override a car mission as the phones stop ringing.\nAt the start of each mission, the player will be given a series of instructions they must follow. The instructions are given in stages, so the objectives can change in a given situation.\nMany of the missions involve tasks that can be completed at the player's own pace, so the player can take a leisurely pace, and observe the traffic laws, although there is always a temptation to cut corners. However, sometimes the game imposes time limits on mission completion, or there may be people giving chase, such as enemy gangsters, or the &lt;a href=\"Police%20%28law%20enforcement%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt;, forcing the player to cut corners, to get to the destination on time and/or evade the pursuers. This means running red lights, driving on the sidewalk (risking running over pedestrians), and finding shortcuts.\nPolice.\nLaw enforcement in \"GTA\" is generally characterized as an obstacle in the game, appearing in the force of &lt;a href=\"Police%20%28law%20enforcement%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; officers who are ready to pursue, arrest, and kill the player if they have committed sufficient criminal acts. The player's wanted level is defined by the number of police heads seen on top of the screen. The more crime the player commits, the more determined the police will be to subdue them. The player can have up to four police heads, which at this point leads to very hostile officers.\nThere are only two ways to eliminate the player's wanted level: by either driving their vehicle to a &lt;a href=\"Spray%20Shop\"&gt;spray shop&lt;/a&gt;, or picking up a \"&lt;a href=\"Police%20Bribes\"&gt;cop bribe&lt;/a&gt;\" pickup in certain parts of each city.\nMultiplayer.\nDespite its age, \"GTA\" even included a multiplayer function, which allowed players to battle with human opponents. This was possible over either a LAN connection or using a null modem cable.\nConsole Ports and Demo Versions.\nThe original \"Grand Theft Auto\" was first available for , and then later ported to , &lt;a href=\"PlayStation\"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Color\"&gt;Game Boy Color&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%28Sega%20Saturn%29\"&gt;Sega Saturn version&lt;/a&gt; was also planned, but canceled early, and there are rumors that \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%2064\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 64&lt;/a&gt;\" was also a port for \"GTA\".\nShareware Demos.\nHot Bitch Teaser.\n\"Hot Bitch Teaser\" (setup tile) was the first free demonstration for the game, and can be downloaded on the official Rockstar's website for \"GTA\". There are three versions for different software: one with 3DFX compatibility, one with 8-bit compatibility, and one with 24-bit compatibility. The 8-bit has a simpler graphics set.\nIt is a demo for the game's first level, \"Gangsta Bang\", featuring &lt;a href=\"Protagonists%20in%20GTA%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;all the protagonists&lt;/a&gt; and the four phone missions from Bubby. However, there is no soundtrack or sound effects and the player is not able to play the four on the same playthrough because the demo is limited to 6 minutes of gameplay. After these 6 minutes, the game will automatically take the player to the score screen.\nOddly, if the player attempts to enter the secret vehicle missions, the game will display a different dialogue mocking the player for not being able to play those missions.\nECTS Competition.\n\"ECTS Competition\" (setup title) was the second demonstration for the game, available at an unknown time after \"Hot Bitch Teaser\" on Rockstar's website. Unlike the first demo, it has only 3DFX compatibility, making more difficult to emulate this demo on modern computers.\nThis demo features the sound effects and part of the soundtrack, and is an altered version of the mission . The demo begins with the protagonist already in southeast &lt;a href=\"Excalibur\"&gt;Excalibur&lt;/a&gt;, a Machine Gun and an Armor in crates and a &lt;a href=\"Speeder\"&gt;Speeder&lt;/a&gt; are provided nearby. Unlike the full game mission, where the player has to kill eight police officers, the demo has only five. The targets in southwest &lt;a href=\"Marina%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Marina&lt;/a&gt;, southeast &lt;a href=\"Aye%20Valley\"&gt;Aye Valley&lt;/a&gt; and east &lt;a href=\"Woodside\"&gt;Woodside&lt;/a&gt; are removed, and after killing the last target at &lt;a href=\"Sunview\"&gt;Sunview&lt;/a&gt; the demo ends. Each time the player kills one of the five cops a big letter message instead of dialogue is displayed stating the number of remaining targets, something absent on the retail versions.\nPorts.\nPlayStation.\nThe PlayStation version of the game is a very accurate recreation of the original DOS game. The soundtrack is still the same, but there are graphics downgrades: the three towns are now more colorful and less detailed. Two missions also have been removed due to hardware limitations: &lt;a href=\"Gangsta%20Bang%20-%20Counthash\"&gt;Gangsta Bang - Counthash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heist%20Almighty%20-%20Itali\"&gt;Heist Almighty - Itali&lt;/a&gt;. Both of these missions have the player entering a train, and because trains are absent in the PlayStation version, these missions have been removed.\nLater, the PlayStation version received a port of the \"\" expansion pack which shared the same graphic downgrade and requires the \"GTA\" CD to play. There is also stand-alone version (without the need for the \"GTA\" CD) of London 1969 for PlayStation, but it was only released in the UK.\nThis game was re-released in a pack in 2002 as part of the \"\" for the PlayStation and later in 2004 for PC.\nGame Boy Color.\nSurprisingly, the Game Boy Color version was unabridged, which was quite a technical achievement due to the sheer size of the cities, converted tile-for-tile from the PC original, making them many times larger than most Game Boy Color game worlds were because of the handheld's limited hardware. It is also playable on the original Game Boy system, sacrificing only the color palette for playability. To cater for the target younger generation, however, the game was heavily censored, with gore and swearing removed. This Game Boy Color version also had an exclusive character named Kelly, who could be renamed Sumner, and activate a cheat code which unlocks 15 characters, based on the games' creator. Wanted Levels were represented by a trouble bar in the Game Boy Color.\nBut the GBC port still displays technical limitations. For example, Pedestrians rarely ever spawn on the streets, unless the Protagonist is driving a vehicle, and the Police have \"notoriously\" inferior AI that can result in cars spawning and being trapped behind a building before they even come close to the player's position. These make most combat outside of missions highly impractical, and evading the police is turned into a cakewalk, even at the highest wanted level.\nThe game also features a radically different soundtrack from the PC and PS1 versions, replacing all the songs that play on the radio and menus in those versions with 8-bit instrumental tracks composed by Anthony Paton.\nSoundtrack.\nThe game features seven radio stations, all of which can be heard once the player enters a car, setting a feature that would become a mainstay in the game series. All the songs on this soundtrack are original creations produced by the DMA Design music department. All of the tracks were composed by &lt;a href=\"Colin%20Anderson\"&gt;Colin Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Craig%20Conner\"&gt;Craig Conner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grant%20Middleton\"&gt;Grant Middleton&lt;/a&gt; circa 1997.\nOn November 28th, &lt;a href=\"2022\"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;, during \"Grand Theft Auto\"s 25th Anniversary, Colin Anderson uploaded &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20-%2025th%20Anniversary%20Composer%27s%20Mixes\"&gt;definitive mixes of the tracks he wrote and recorded&lt;/a&gt; for the original game on his official YouTube channel, including \"The Ballad Of Chapped Lips Calhoun\", \"Just Do It\", \"On The Move\", \"Aori\", \"Pootang Shebang\" and \"4 Letter Love\".\nDevelopment.\nThrough interviews with the early \"GTA\" developers and staff members, we know that during the development of the first game they had the general idea of pushing the boundaries of what a game could offer at the time, and that each member could bring up any ideas they could imagine to include in the game.\nOne of the first elements that was proposed was to let the game have different radios with different music genres, an idea that at first wasn't really accepted by all the staff and had some skeptics. The general atmosphere of the company at the time needs to be understood, there was some friction between the members because the game had been stuck in \"development hell\" for years, owing to the difficulties in coding and compiling so many complex features (the mix of driving, open-city exploration and shooter genres in particular) that were proposed and that, up until then, no game had featured in such a manner. The staff was particularly worried that the public misunderstood the game as an \"inferior 2D driving game in top-view\" at a time that 3D-graphics racing-genre games were in full swing.\nThe staff had fantasized for a long time about getting the licenses to major hits and to have access to great catalogues of music, something that wouldn't truly be realized until \"\" as the music industry didn't believe in videogames as a medium at the time. Thus, they had to produce original music with mock radio stations and fictional artists. The members had freedom to come up with different ideas and to produce them. Two members in particular were crucial for producing those early tracks: &lt;a href=\"Colin%20Anderson\"&gt;Colin Anderson&lt;/a&gt; (who dealt with rock, funk and country tracks) and &lt;a href=\"Craig%20Conner\"&gt;Craig Conner&lt;/a&gt; (who dealt with electronic, pop and hip-hop tracks).\nConner, then an indie music producer who had recently been hired, was struggling to produce the hip hop tracks as he was more of an electronic music enthusiast and had never rapped, so he teamed up with Johnny Wilson (who adopted the alias \"\"&lt;a href=\"Robert%20De%20Negro\"&gt;Robert De Negro&lt;/a&gt;\"\"), which was \"a tall, black guy who was a student of Chemistry at Dundee University\", in the words of early \"GTA\" developer &lt;a href=\"David%20Jones\"&gt;David Jones&lt;/a&gt;. The objective was clear: to make a hip hop song that synthesized all what a \"Grand Theft Auto\" game was about, and thus they created the song \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%28song%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\". The track was so popular amongst the staff that it convinced them to definitely move on with having different radios, and the song itself became from then on the flag of intent into what a \"GTA\" song should be.\nAccording to \"GTA\" artist &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Reeves\"&gt;Paul Reeves&lt;/a&gt;, he and several others working on DMA Design's other game, \"Body Harvest\", suggested at the time that the original \"GTA\" game could be a 3rd person experience in a 3D world, similar to how \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" would later end up. Unfortunately for the team at the time, this fell on deaf ears.\nReception.\nPC &amp; PlayStation 1 Versions.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\" received mixed to average reviews, with mostly averaging 6s to 7s out of 10.\n\"GameSpot\" awarded the PC version a 6.4/10 while the PS1 version received a more favorable 8/10. In their review they praised the unique soundtrack and the freedom of choice, while criticizing the graphics, calling it \"a little plain\".\n\"Next Generation\" awarded the game with 4 stars out of 5; they stated in their review that \"It is quite easy to accuse \"Grand Theft Auto\" of being all style and no substance, but the charge doesn't stick. Of course, we don't condone the acts within, but there is no denying that the game itself is well-executed and quite enjoyable.\"\n\"GameRankings\" awarded the PC version with 79% and the PS1 version with 68%.\n\"GameRevolution\" awarded the game with a B rating.\n\"Computer and Video Games\" awarded the game with 7/10.\n\"The UK PlayStation Official Magazine\" awarded the PS1 version with 7/10.\n\"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" awarded the game with 6.5/10.\n\"IGN\" awarded the game with a 6/10, saying in their review that \"GTA\" is a fun game but with some major problems that could've been fixed.\n\"GamePro\" were the least favorable, awarding the game with 2 stars out of 5.\nGBC Version.\nThe Game Boy Color port of \"Grand Theft Auto\" has received less favorable reviews than the PC and PS1 versions.\n\"GameRankings\" awarded the port with a 57% out of 100%.\n\"Nintendo Power\" awarded the port with a slightly more favorable 6.2/10.\nSales.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\" went to sell over 1 million copies in &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt; and 3 million copies in its lifespan. And despite the mediocre reception, it was considered to be a commercial success.\nControversy.\nThe game, with its violent subject matter, generated a great deal of controversy. However, this was deemed to be intentional, and was the first game known to have been publicized in such a way. &lt;a href=\"Take-Two%20Interactive\"&gt;Take-Two Interactive&lt;/a&gt;, the publishers of \"Grand Theft Auto\", hired publicist to generate an aura of controversy about the game in the local media. As a result, politicians stepped into the fray. Whatever the impact on game censorship and the perception of video gaming, the publicity worked - the title was hugely successful simply because those attempting to ban the game were inadvertently generating publicity for it. This has been a known and recognized phenomenon of violent video games ever since its release. The game was banned in Brazil and, temporarily, Britain for its content."}

It was a port of the original \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" game. According to Keith Hamilton, who was the lead programmer, its engine was inspired by that of another Sega Saturn game known as \" \"and had a side 3D View and enhanced graphics. The port was cancelled early during development, supposedly because the team didn't have the necessary financial resources, so they decided to focus on the PC version.\nAfter the PC version was a sucess, the PlayStation One (Sega Saturn's direct competitor at the time) would receive a version of the game three months later, but the Sega Saturn version never came up. It's probably that the team decided to keep the Sega Saturn port cancelled because the disastrous release of the console in North America.\nThe original DOS/Windows release for the first Grand Theft Auto has an alternate graphic set for the 320x200x256 resolution, which is identical to the one at the magazine screenshots for the Sega Saturn port. This set still uses the old \"DeluxePaint\" pallete meaning it was probably done in 1995 (GTA early days), so it is arguable if this graphic set was going to be the Sega Saturn's."}

It also plays in the main menu of \"Grand Theft Auto\".\nHistory and Recording.\nThe song \"Grand Theft Auto\" has a huge part in the history of the whole \"Grand Theft Auto\" series: as we know through interviews with the early \"Grand Theft Auto\" developers and staff members, it is the song that definitely convinced them to incorporate music as a central part of the game, at a time where they were still trying to figure out what things should the game have.\nThe inclusion of diferent radios with different music styles that played depending on which car the player was driving, based on stereotypical owners of such cars, was one of the first proposals, but at first this idea wasn't really accepted by all the staff and had some skeptics, owing to a drawn-out \"development hell\" that had been going on and on for years.\nThey didn't have the resources or the support of the music industry to feature well-known mainstream hits, something they really wanted, and as such they went into recording original songs.\n&lt;a href=\"Colin%20Anderson\"&gt;Colin Anderson&lt;/a&gt; dealt with rock, funk and country tracks, meanwhile &lt;a href=\"Craig%20Conner\"&gt;Craig Conner&lt;/a&gt; dealt with electronic, pop and hip hop tracks. Conner, then indie music producer recently hired, started to draft the hip hop tracks, but soon began to struggle as he was more of an electronic music enthusiast and had never rapped, so he teamed up with Johnny Wilson (who adopted the alias \"Robert De Negro\"), who was \"a tall, black guy who was a student of Chemistry at Dundee University\", in the words of early \"GTA\" developer Dave Jones. They had one clear objective: making a hip hop track that synthesized all what a \"Grand Theft Auto\" game is. This song became \"Grand Theft Auto\". After finishing it, it was so succesful within the staff that the company was definitely convinced on making music a great element of the game and have different radios; the song itself became the blueprint for the later songs produced, showcasing all what a \"GTA\" game's song should have.\nContent.\nThe song was written by Craig Conner, one of &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar&lt;/a&gt;'s in-house musicians, and is a stereotype of 'gangsta rap', with blatant lyrics concerning (appropriately) car theft, drug use, running from the law and the possession and use of firearms. Conner also played all of the instruments in the song.\nThe track first appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\", where it is credited to the fictitious band Da Shootaz, fronted by rapper &lt;a href=\"Robert%20DeNegro\"&gt;Robert DeNegro&lt;/a&gt; (an obvious pun on actor , who starred in many of the gangster films that have been cited as inspiration for the \"GTA\" games). The song plays in the main menu of \"GTA\". It later reappeared on the soundtrack for &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt; as a nod to the original game, in the radio station &lt;a href=\"Lips%20106\"&gt;Lips 106&lt;/a&gt;. It should also be noted that in this second appearance the two uses of the profanity \"fuck\" in the song are censored through the overdubbing of Lips 106 taglines, somewhat ironic given the otherwise gratuitous and mature nature of the game.\nThe opening hook of the song also appears throughout the \"GTA\" series. In \"GTA III\", the player's &lt;a href=\"Communication%23Pagers\"&gt;pager&lt;/a&gt; plays out a primitive rendition of the hook whenever a message is received, while the -like opening of \"\" features the same hook in a more vibrant 8-bit tone. GTA III's pager ringtone is also recycled as a selectable ringtone on the player's &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;mobile phone&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", simply titled \"Pager\".\nLyrics.\nAs one would expect from a song written as a theme for \"Grand Theft Auto\", the track's lyrics make many references to the kind of criminality associated with the games, and even mentions the phrase 'GTA' specifically."}

It was released &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; on October 22, 1999, by developer &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;Rockstar North&lt;/a&gt; (then known as DMA Design), for the &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PlayStation\"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt;. A version for the &lt;a href=\"Dreamcast\"&gt;Dreamcast&lt;/a&gt; console was made available, which included PC features omitted from the PlayStation version, and later a toned-down version for &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Color\"&gt;Game Boy Color&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon release, \"GTA 2\" was met with mixed to average reaction, but was a commercial success compared to &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;the previous title in the series&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the side of some covers of the PlayStation version, the title is styled as 'GTa2'.\nSetting.\n\"GTA 2\" takes place in a large metropolis only vaguely referred to as &lt;a href=\"Anywhere%20City\"&gt;Anywhere City&lt;/a&gt;. The city is heavily stylized in a design, displaying a contrast between a vivid color palette and advanced science fiction weapons and postwar architecture and transportation. All civilian vehicles are retro-modified versions of popular cars and trucks built up until the 1960s, further reinforcing its retrofuturistic influences. The player controls &lt;a href=\"Claude%20Speed\"&gt;Claude Speed&lt;/a&gt;, an uprising criminal in the districts of Anywhere who works both with and against the many criminal syndicates of the city.\nThe year the game is set in is extremely ambiguous. There are police records on the \"Grand Theft Auto 2\" &lt;a href=\"Rockstargames.com/GTA2\"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; showing the dates of July 7, &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, and July 10, 2013, including the criminal records of characters who are killed during the events of the game, indicating the game may be set around July 2013. However, &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Riccaro\"&gt;Johnny Riccaro&lt;/a&gt;, an in-game radio host, mentions that the millennium's coming, and mentions the bug, suggesting that \"Grand Theft Auto 2\" is set in &lt;a href=\"1999\"&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt;, the year it was released. \nThe weapons in the game are futuristic, and the website says \"three weeks into the future,\" but as previously mentioned, all vehicles are distinctively old world. According to the official \"GTA 2 Design Document\" shared by the DMA Design programmer &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Dailly\"&gt;Mike Dailly&lt;/a&gt; in 2022, it is said that the game will be set slightly in the future (referencing 's infamous \"\" quote) to give more artistic freedom and scope for features.\nHowever, it is more likely that the game takes place in an unspecific year/time (anywhere from 1999\u20132013), fitting with the game's setting of \"Anywhere City, USA\".\nGameplay.\nCity.\n&lt;a href=\"Anywhere%20City\"&gt;Anywhere City&lt;/a&gt; is divided into 3 sectors: &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20District\"&gt;Downtown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Residential%20District\"&gt;Residential&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20District\"&gt;Industrial&lt;/a&gt;. In each of them are three gangs, whose bosses give the player missions via payphones. Each district also has a maximum &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%202\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; that the player can acquire, likely to make later levels more difficult:\nSaving.\nTo save the game, the player needs to find the &lt;a href=\"Jesus%20Saves\"&gt;Jesus Saves&lt;/a&gt; church. It can only be found by listening out for the organ playing or by hijacking a &lt;a href=\"TV%20Van\"&gt;TV Van&lt;/a&gt; (the antenna on top always points towards it). Once at the church, the player needs to pay $50,000 to save, so it's best not to save until turning off the game; however, completing two to three missions will easily reward the player with enough money.\nThe Game Boy Color version lacks a proper save feature, instead utilizing a password system. The password is given to the player when a mission is accomplished and entered from the main menu.\nRespect.\nEach of the three gangs within the three districts have a gang with whom they are neutral, and a gang with whom they war. The player will earn respect by killing other \"enemy\" gang members but naturally will lose respect with the gang that they attack\u2014a gang with considerably low respect will attack the player if they enter their territory. In Downtown district, the gangsters wield only pistols, but in other districts, their weaponry matches the hatred towards the player, even though there are always some of those who wield only pistols. Respect is also earned by doing missions for each of the gangs, and a high level of respect is required to unlock the harder but more rewarding missions. The player can find out which gang is hated by other gangs by going to the blue phone in each gang's territory.\nMissions.\nThere are three levels of mission difficulty: easy, taken from green payphones; medium, from yellow payphones, which pay better but require the player to have some respect; and hard, from red payphones, which pay very well, but usually are very hard, and require maximum respect. For completing a mission, the player earns money, respect and a money multiplier. Sometimes during a mission, the player is also given access to new parts of town, vehicles, or weapons. \nBonuses.\nBonus Stages.\nAfter completing each level in the PC version, the player unlocks not only the next district, but also a &lt;a href=\"Bonus%20Stages%20in%20GTA%202\"&gt;Bonus Stage&lt;/a&gt;. There are two different types, each with three arenas: Destroying &lt;a href=\"Ice-Cream%20Van\"&gt;Ice Cream Vans&lt;/a&gt;, and a time-attack mode where the player must race against the clock (killing pedestrians and gang members earns the player more time).\nBonus Missions.\nIn every city, there are some \"side\" missions. Most reward the player with an extra life or money, but the &lt;a href=\"Wang%20Cars\"&gt;Wang Cars&lt;/a&gt; side mission rewards the player with three special vehicles. \nThese missions are:\nGangs.\nThere are seven gangs in the game:\nRadio stations.\nEach area features five radio stations, from a pool of 11, to which the player listens while driving a vehicle. Changing radio stations for preference was also possible in the &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; version by using the \"F1\" function key. \"&lt;a href=\"Head%20Radio%20%282D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Head Radio&lt;/a&gt;\" was present in the original \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\". Each gang also has its own radio station that transmits within a limited area. All radio stations only play music, unlike future games, which feature a talk radio station as well as music stations.\nMultiplayer.\n\"GTA 2\" was the last PC \"GTA\" with built-in multiplayer until \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and subsequent titles. It supported up to six players and connections via Internet, LAN, serial cable or direct modem connection. There are also three small multiplayer maps designed for smaller number of players, as well as three districts with modified locations of weapons and parked cars.\nPlaying via Internet using only built-in tools is quite difficult. First, you need to choose \"tcp/ip connection\", then enter server IP and you will be able to join only if host is in hosting menu. That's why programs like &lt;a href=\"GTA2%20Game%20Hunter\"&gt;GTA2 Game Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, or GTA2 Gamer were made. They provide one-click joining without entering anybody's IP, chat and some other useful options that make playing \"GTA 2\" online as easy as any other modern game.\n\"GTA 2: The Movie\".\nThe opening of the game was pieced together from live film-material that was taken from an eight-minute \"GTA 2\" short film created for the purpose of advertising the game. This movie has since been made available to the public and is downloadable from the game's website.\nWhether the movie can be considered canonical is debatable, as it shows Claude getting killed at the end (shot by a Zaibatsu hitman while trying to break into a sports car).\nDespite the fact that \"GTA 2\" is supposed to be set in the near future, the movie was clearly shot in present-day New York City, and also featured a blue-and-white NYPD Chevrolet Caprice police car as a pursuit vehicle. Claude Speed was played by &lt;a href=\"Scott%20Maslen\"&gt;Scott Maslen&lt;/a&gt;, known for his role in the British crime show, \"The Bill\".\nDevelopment.\n\"Grand Theft Auto 2\" was developed by &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;DMA Design&lt;/a&gt;. Promo material for the game released before release described Anywhere City as \"a fully dysfunctional urban hell\" and explains that the artists modeled the city on apocalyptic visions of the future from '70s and '80s movies.\n\"GTA 2\" was the first title in the series to adopt early 3D graphics technology present on the PlayStation and some PCs. While the gameplay did not shift to the third-person perspective, as did \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" with its full &lt;a href=\"Three-Dimensional\"&gt;3D environment&lt;/a&gt;, it utilised 3D graphics hardware/software to improve the visual quality.\n\"GTA 2's\" gameplay is presented via the top-down perspective, as in all \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" titles/expansion packs, but due to the employment of early 3D tech, it exhibits smooth dynamic camera zooming, smooth rotation, and lighting effects from streetlamps, car headlamps, and emergency vehicle roof lighting. The game also included a unique gang reputation system, which remains unused in any other \"Grand Theft Auto\" game to this day.\nThe vehicles are especially stylish, taking vintage \u201950s designs\u2014all curves, chrome, and giant grills\u2014and giving them a futuristic twist. \u201cAs if Havana got transported to the 21st Century,\u201d says the game\u2019s charmingly retro Flash-based website.\nThe picture of the yellow car on the cover of \"GTA 2\" was taken from atop the - the photographer simply shot a random car.\nReception.\n\"Grand Theft Auto 2\" was met with mixed to favorable reception, with most critics praising the game for its freedom and gameplay, while a major criticism was the gameplay being too similar to the previous game.\n\"GameInformer\" awarded the game with 8.5/10.\n\"Edge\" awarded the game with 8/10.\n\"Computer and Video Games\" awarded the game with 4 stars out of 5.\n\"GamePro\" awarded the game with 7/10, stating: \"It's twisted fun for a while, but then it starts to get old\". \n\"Metacritic\" awarded the PS1 version with 70/100.\n\"GameRankings\" awarded the PC version with 71%, the Dreamcast version with 70%, the PS1 version with 69% and the GBC version with the least favorable 35%.\n\"GamesRadar+\" awarded a 6.9/10, stating \"Carefully crafted, big and sprawling and, more to the point, fun and exciting, \"GTA 2\" retains the best qualities of its predecessors, and its new gang warfare element improves upon and expands upon the original idea, giving the gameplay a little more depth.\" \n\"IGN\" gave \"GTA 2\" a 6.8/10. Tal Blevins of \"IGN\" said in his review: \"Here we have one of the few times that good gameplay has been badly hampered by control and graphic choices... Not a bad game, but essentially, it's more of the same.\"\n\"GameSpot\" gave the \"GTA 2\" the same score, and Jeff Gerstmann stated in his review that \"The graphics have been redone, the music is different, there is a slew of new weapons, the mission structure is a bit more complex, and the city feels a bit more alive. But at its core, \"GTA 2\" is the same old game.\"\n\"Next Generation\" awarded the game with 2 stars out of 5. Blake Fischer stated in his Dreamcast version review that \"A great idea that, for one reason or another, never really gets into a must-play game.\" \nSales.\n\"Grand Theft Auto 2\" sold over 2 million copies in it lifespan and was labeled as one of \"PS1 Greatest Hits\"."}

{"id": "1496", "revid": "33378340", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1496", "title": "Grand Theft Auto Advance", "text": "Grand Theft Auto Advance (also referred to as GTA Advance and marketed simply as Grand Theft Auto) is a video game created and developed by &lt;a href=\"Digital%20Eclipse\"&gt;Digital Eclipse&lt;/a&gt; under supervision of &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Studios&lt;/a&gt;, and published by &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt;, released on 26 October &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Advance\"&gt;Game Boy Advance&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe game is played from a top-down perspective, similar to the series' &lt;a href=\"2D%20Universe\"&gt;2D Universe&lt;/a&gt; games (\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\"). However, \"GTA Advance\" also borrows several aspects from the more recent &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; games (\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\"), including vehicle-based side missions (such as vigilante), the heads up display and the inclusion of new weapons. \nOriginally meant to be a &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III%20%28Game%20Boy%20Advance%29\"&gt;Game Boy Advance port of \"Grand Theft Auto III\"&lt;/a&gt; during its development, \"GTA Advance\" is set in the &lt;a href=\"Timeline%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;3D Universe timeline&lt;/a&gt; of the series, and serves as a prequel to the events of \"Grand Theft Auto III\", taking place one year prior.\nSetting.\nThe game is set in &lt;a href=\"2000\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;, one year before the events of \"GTA III\", and it is set in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, the \"GTA\" city that appeared, most prominently, in \"Grand Theft Auto III\". Indeed the earliest announcement of this game was that it would be a port of \"GTA III\", but at some point in development (it is unclear exactly when this occurred) this idea was rejected, most likely due to technical limitations and the time needed to reconstruct the previous game's missions in the new two-dimensional environment.\nThe game that was actually released is a prequel to \"GTA III\", taking place one year prior to the events in \"GTA III\". As it takes place in \"GTA III\"'s Liberty City, familiar landmarks re-appear and the overall street layout is the same. However the locations of familiar secrets such as rampages and hidden packages and jump ramps have all been changed, so players familiar with the city's corners and alleyways in \"GTA III\" will have to explore them afresh in \"GTA Advance\". The city's three islands have been noticeably changed in its conversion and elements impossible to interpret to a top-view perspective, so there are no longer any sloped surfaces, and the tunnels and train system have been removed. The city in \"GTA Advance\" is bigger than in \"GTA III\", especially &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt; (see image on the left).\nThe game's protagonist is called &lt;a href=\"Mike\"&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt;, with some of the \"GTA III\" characters re-appearing in the game, including bomb-shop owner &lt;a href=\"8-Ball\"&gt;8-Ball&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt; co-leader &lt;a href=\"Asuka%20Kasen\"&gt;Asuka Kasen&lt;/a&gt;. However, none of the &lt;a href=\"Mafia\"&gt;Mafia&lt;/a&gt; characters from \"GTA III\" appear, and entirely new characters such as &lt;a href=\"Vinnie\"&gt;Vinnie&lt;/a&gt; (Mike's friend and first employer), &lt;a href=\"Cisco\"&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt; (the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;Colombian Cartel&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Jonnie\"&gt;Jonnie&lt;/a&gt; (a bar tender) and &lt;a href=\"Yuka\"&gt;Yuka&lt;/a&gt; (Asuka's niece) have been added. Several characters which were only referenced in \"GTA III\" are now met face-to-face, such as &lt;a href=\"King%20Courtney\"&gt;King Courtney&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Yardies\"&gt;Uptown Yardies&lt;/a&gt; boss. It is also the only game in the 3D Universe that allows the player to change the plot by making choices, though they will all lead to the same ending.\nStoryline.\n&lt;a href=\"Mike\"&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; is a small-time criminal, working for the more connected &lt;a href=\"Vinnie\"&gt;Vinnie&lt;/a&gt;. They decide to leave Liberty City together and try their luck elsewhere, but Vinnie convinces Mike to do some tasks for their sometimes-employers, the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Mafia&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Momma%27s%20Restaurante\"&gt;Momma's Restaurante&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Mark%27s\"&gt;Saint Mark's&lt;/a&gt;, prior to leaving. During &lt;a href=\"Getaway\"&gt;one of these missions&lt;/a&gt;, Vinnie is apparently killed in a &lt;a href=\"Car%20Bomb\"&gt;car bomb&lt;/a&gt;, taking his and Mike's &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; with him. For this, Mike swears revenge. Mike then works for &lt;a href=\"8-Ball\"&gt;8-Ball&lt;/a&gt;, an associate of Vinnie's, who offers to help with Mike's quest. Mike does various jobs for him before 8-Ball suggests that he works for a bartender named &lt;a href=\"Jonnie\"&gt;Jonnie&lt;/a&gt;, who is also connected to the criminal underworld. Mike does some work for Jonnie including looking after his drunk girlfriend while Jonnie helps looking into Vinnie's death. Mike is slightly annoyed by Jonnie's paranoia but it later proves true when Mike finds Jonnie has been killed while Mike was on a loan shark job. Mike notices the assailants leaving the bar are members of the &lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Yardies\"&gt;Uptown Yardies&lt;/a&gt;. Mike pursues the Yardies to &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually Mike confronts Yardie leader, &lt;a href=\"King%20Courtney\"&gt;King Courtney&lt;/a&gt;. Courtney denies that he was responsible saying he is also looking for the killer because Jonnie owed the Yardies money. While Mike does some jobs for the Yardies, it becomes apparent that they are using him, this is confirmed when Courtney sends Mike to go after &lt;a href=\"Cisco\"&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;Colombian Cartel&lt;/a&gt; and rival of the Yardies. Mike, believing that Cisco is the culprit, faces off against the gang leader at a restaurant. Cisco finally warns Mike of Courtney's treachery. Mike then works for Cisco and the Cartel, and also finds himself helping the &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Asuka%20Kasen\"&gt;Asuka Kasen&lt;/a&gt; sends Mike to rescue her niece &lt;a href=\"Yuka\"&gt;Yuka&lt;/a&gt; (who, ironically, was kidnapped by Mike while working for Cisco). Mike finds himself working for the two leaders of gangs feuding with each other, but does the work regardless as both Cisco and Asuka agree to look into Vinnie's death. Mike then unexpectedly finds Cisco dead, Mike speculates that the culprit is Vinnie's and Jonnie's killer. Mike begins to pursue the assailants car, not before being temporarily beset by men hired to protect the killer. Mike eventually crashes the escaping car and the criminal behind this is revealed to be Vinnie, who faked his death and was conspiring against Mike the whole time. Vinnie and his bodyguards engage in a shootout with Mike before Vinnie is wounded. Vinnie begs for his life, but Mike refuses to listen. Before Mike kills him, Vinnie warns Mike that in the event of his death, any criminal greedy enough will definitely go after him, but Mike doesn't take heed to this and finishes him off.\nLater Mike meets 8-Ball (who failed to warn Mike about Vinnie). The two are suddenly attacked by the Colombians who blame Mike for Cisco's death. After a lengthy fight, police suddenly attack, and 8-Ball &lt;a href=\"Love%20of%20Money\"&gt;is arrested&lt;/a&gt; (setting the stage for his escape in the \"Grand Theft Auto III\" &lt;a href=\"Give%20Me%20Liberty\"&gt;intro&lt;/a&gt;), but Mike manages to escape. Mike tries to get even with Cisco's successor who tells him that King Courtney has called a hit out on Mike for his money (as the late Vinnie warned). Mike later goes across the city massacring the Yardies' hitmen. Mike meets Asuka who offers to help him kill King Courtney. Mike and several Yakuza members meet at the Yardies hideout. The Yakuza flee forcing Mike to face King Courtney and his men alone. A climactic fight ensues resulting in Mike nearly killing Courtney who surrenders and begs for his life. Suddenly, the LCPD raid the area, but Mike manages to elude them after a climatic chase. Mike then boards Cisco's plane and flees Liberty City with joy, his journey across the city complete.\nSoundtrack.\nEach time a player gets in a car, it will play a looped, instrumental version of a single song. Songs serve as the \"radios\" in this game, and (with the exception of Slumpussy's \"This Life\", from \"GTA\") they are from \"GTA 2\". The following songs are featured:\nDevelopment.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Advance\" was developed by Digital Eclipse, in collaboration with &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;Rockstar North&lt;/a&gt;. The game originally began development under Crawfish Interactive; however, this studio went defunct in November 2002, ending the possibility of a &lt;a href=\"2003\"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt; release. It was at this point that Susan Cummings, an employee at Rockstar, was tasked with finding another studio to work on the project. Through her prior relationships with &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Mika\"&gt;Mike Mika&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Ayre\"&gt;Andrew Ayre&lt;/a&gt; at Digital Eclipse, she was able to hand them the deal.\nWhere the story is concerned, Mika says Digital Eclipse initially pitched several ideas, \"but ultimately, Rockstar was like, 'Nope, this is how the story's gonna be' and it was better than anything we were coming up with. But we ended up contributing to a lot of that.\" Digital Eclipse's &lt;a href=\"James%20Stanley\"&gt;James Stanley&lt;/a&gt;, who was also a producer, accepted responsibility for fleshing out the game's story from the initial brief. His job was to create new missions and craft new dialogue.\nThe game had to be adapted to the Game Boy Advance's hardware limitations. As a result it does not have voice acting or animated cutscenes, nor does it have much-lauded pedestrian dialog of \"GTA III\". All cutscenes are text-only with line-art pictures of the characters' faces, sometimes with a thematic backdrop behind. The art style is consistent with that used for the cover and loading art of the three-dimensional releases in the series. Replacing the pedestrian dialog, some sound effects taken from \"GTA III\" are played when the player hits someone's car, but there is a limited variety, leading to much repetition.\nEven though the game is fixed in a 2D environment, the developers managed to throw in a few tricks to give the game a more 3D look and feel. Buildings that rise up into the sky actually move in perspective to the camera using a 3D shifting effect, vehicles will actually lean to the left and right as their weight shifts through a turn and Liberty City isn't just a bunch of cross-streets - there are over and underpasses, with the engine turning the car transparent when players drive it underneath a bridge. Liberty City in the Game Boy Advance version is nearly three times the size of the incarnation in the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; \"GTA III\" game. &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Shallock\"&gt;Dan Shallock&lt;/a&gt;, lead artist at Digital Eclipse, elaborated: \"\"The buildings were the only kind of fake 3D-engine thing that we did. With those, we would just render a side view square, and then &lt;a href=\"Cathryn%20Mataga\"&gt;Cathryn&lt;/a&gt; kind of 3D mapped those onto the side of buildings, but everything else was just sprite work, you know, so going back that was just classic Game Boy sprite work.\"\"\nThe game does not feature radio channels. Like the &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Color\"&gt;Game Boy Color&lt;/a&gt; ports of \"GTA\" and \"GTA 2\", each car has one fixed tune that is constantly repeated and cannot be changed. These include parts of some familiar \"GTA\" and \"GTA 2\" tunes, in instrumental versions.\nThese limitations, coupled with the game being released on the same day as its highly anticipated cousin \"\", caused the game to be widely criticized by fans. \nReception.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Advance\" received mixed to average reception, with critics praising the game for improving on the 2D formula while criticizing the gameplay and graphics.\n\"Game Chronicles\" awarded the game with 8.8; Loki of \"Game Chronicles\" gave his final thoughts on \"GTA Advance\" with the following statement: \"If you are a sucker for pretty graphics and a rich narrative then you had better stick with the console versions of \"Grand Theft Auto\", but anyone looking for an excellent handheld version of the game will delight in the complexity this title has to offer. And if you have ever played the original versions of \"GTA\", either on Dreamcast or PS1 then you can relive some of those fond memories as well.\"\n\"IGN\" awarded the game with 8.5/10; Craig Harris of \"IGN\" said that the game \"does a good job of looking like the old \"GTA\" games.\" and \"vastly improves on the originals, and fixes the game so much that it's now a great, recommended action title.\"\n\"GameInformer\" awarded the game with 7.5/10.\n\"GameSpot\" awarded the game with a less favorable 6.5/10. Jeff Gerstmann commented on his \"GameSpot\" review that \"bringing the classic \"GTA\" gameplay back is a neat idea, but the execution here is weighted down by the lame story, straight-laced dialogue and the technical issues.\"\n\"1UP.com\" were the least favorable towards \"GTA Advance\", awarding the game with a D+. They stated in their review that \"It attempts to re-create the top-down style of those antiquated games, but ends up feeling like a patchwork of redundant fetch quests tied together by an all-too-tedious story\" and ending their review with the following statement: \"If anything, \"GTA Advance\" reminds us just how far this series has come. The deep gameplay of recent entries makes a poor leap to the portable screen, with flat visuals and highly repetitive sounds.\"\n\"Metacritic\" awarded the game with 68/100, making it the lowest rated (excluding \"\") games in the series.\nSales.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Advance\" reportedly has sold less then 250,000 copies, making it one of the worst selling \"Grand Theft Auto\" game in the series."}

It was originally released for the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; console, but also saw ports for the &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20%28console%29\"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt;. It is the third main game of the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series and the fifth overall installment.\nSet in the fictional &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; in 2001, \"Grand Theft Auto III\" begins a new &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;continuity&lt;/a&gt; separated from its &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;prede&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;cessors&lt;/a&gt;. The game's narrative follows the adventures of &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt;, a silent criminal who was betrayed by his girlfriend &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt; during a bank heist. Claude begins to work for different factions in the crime-riddled Liberty City, including the &lt;a href=\"Mafia\"&gt;Mafia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt; and corrupted figures.\nSet in an open-world environment, \"Grand Theft Auto III\" is the first game in the series to be presented in a fully 3D world, shifting away from the &lt;a href=\"Top-Down%20Perspective\"&gt;top-down perspective&lt;/a&gt; that characterized previous games in the franchise. Development was handled by DMA Design, and it was the final game developed by the company before its rename into Rockstar North.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\" was universally acclaimed upon its release in October 2001. Critics praised the game for its presentation, game design, freedom, sound design and ambition, though it was a subject of controversy due to its violent nature. Multiple publications deemed it a revolutionary title for its advancements in game design and open-ended gameplay, and it was awarded a variety of end-year accolades. A commercial success, \"GTA 3\" sold over 14 million copies.\nIn 2011, the game was re-released on &lt;a href=\"Apple%20iOS\"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Android%20OS\"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; devices for its 10-year anniversary under the title \"Grand Theft Auto III: 10 Year Anniversary Edition\". It was met with positive responses, with gaming publications praising its visuals, though criticism was directed at the port's controls.\nOn November 11, &lt;a href=\"2021\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;, the game was re-released on 8th and 9th generation consoles for its 20-year anniversary under the title \"Grand Theft Auto III - The Definitive Edition\", included in the \" bundle.\nStoryline.\nChronologically following the events of \", &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt; leaves with her boyfriend &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. At the start of the game, the two are seen robbing a bank with &lt;a href=\"Miguel\"&gt;Miguel&lt;/a&gt;, a Colombian Cartel member and their getaway driver, and another unnamed man. Amidst the chase, Catalina tells Claude that she is an ambitious girl and doesn't need him anymore, shooting him, killing the unnamed man, and leaving with Miguel and the money. Claude survives, and is arrested for the robbery. While crossing the Portland Island bridge in a police convoy, the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;Colombian Cartel&lt;/a&gt; ambushes them by blowing up the &lt;a href=\"Callahan%20Bridge\"&gt;Callahan Bridge&lt;/a&gt; (isolating &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt; from the rest of the city) and then kidnap an &lt;a href=\"Old%20Oriental%20Gentleman\"&gt;Old Oriental Gentleman&lt;/a&gt;. Claude and another prisoner named &lt;a href=\"8-Ball\"&gt;8-Ball&lt;/a&gt; free themselves while the convoy is ambushed and leave.\n8-Ball introduces Claude to &lt;a href=\"Luigi%20Goterelli\"&gt;Luigi Goterelli&lt;/a&gt; and Claude works for him to prove himself useful. Luigi orders him to drive &lt;a href=\"Joey%20Leone\"&gt;Joey Leone&lt;/a&gt;'s favorite prostitute, &lt;a href=\"Misty\"&gt;Misty&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Joey%27s%20Garage\"&gt;Joey's Garage&lt;/a&gt;, and earns Joey's trust by performing missions against the Triads and the &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;. Joey introduces him to &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt;, who Claude begins working for to exact revenge on the Triads after a failed assault attempt in a laundry shop. After proving himself, Claude is introduced to Joey's father and the head of the Leone Family, &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore Leone&lt;/a&gt;. Claude is not powerful enough to stay for Joey, Toni, and Salvatore's meeting, so he is instructed to drive around Salvatore's trophy wife, &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Latore\"&gt;Maria Latore&lt;/a&gt;, and saves her from a drug raid in a warehouse party she attended.\nSalvatore begins trusting Claude, and confides in him that he believes that a bartender named &lt;a href=\"Curly%20Bob\"&gt;Curly Bob&lt;/a&gt; is selling information about the Leone's to the Cartel in exchange for SPANK, an illegal drug. Claude follows Curly Bob and finds out that Catalina and Miguel are now leaders of the Cartel. Claude kills Curly Bob, but Catalina and Miguel escape. Salvatore has Claude, with the help of 8-Ball, blow up the Cartel Ship with their supply of SPANK.\nFor his last mission, Salvatore asks Claude to get rid of a car filled with murder evidence. However, as Claude nears the car's location, Maria pages Claude, saying that the car is a trap, and to meet her at the docks. Should Claude enter the car, it will explode. At the docks, Maria admits that she lied to Salvatore and said she was having an affair with Claude, which caused his rage. Maria introduces him to a Yakuza leader &lt;a href=\"Asuka%20Kasen\"&gt;Asuka Kasen&lt;/a&gt; and they move to Staunton Island to escape the Leone's.\nAsuka wants Claude to prove that his ties with Leone's are completely broken by assassinating Salvatore as he is leaving Luigi's club. Claude works for Asuka against the Leone's and the police. She soon introduces Claude to her brother and waka-gashira &lt;a href=\"Kenji%20Kasen\"&gt;Kenji Kasen&lt;/a&gt; and a corrupt cop &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Machowski\"&gt;Ray Machowski&lt;/a&gt;. Claude works for Kenji against the &lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Yardies\"&gt;Uptown Yardies&lt;/a&gt; and the Cartel while he also works for Ray to keep his connections with the Yakuza secret by making him do his dirty work.\nRay introduces him to billionaire mogul &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt; and Claude begins working for him. He rescues the Oriental Gentleman from the Cartel, after Love tells him that they are holding him hostage for a ransom. To lower the real estate price of the city, Claude starts a war between the Yakuza and the Cartel by running over Kenji with a Cartel vehicle. He also collects the packages from a plane hangar, however, the Cartel have taken it back to their construction site headquarters, and finds Miguel and Catalina there. Miguel attempts to negotiate with Claude, but Catalina shoots him in the back and escapes. Thinking that the Cartel killed her brother, Asuka arrives to assist Claude and tortures Miguel for information. After helping Love by providing a distraction, Claude returns to the penthouse and finds that he and the Oriental Gentleman have disappeared. He returns to the construction site and finds Asuka and Miguel both dead, with a note from Catalina saying she has kidnapped Maria and will kill her unless he brings $500,000 to the Cartel Mansion.\nUpon arriving, it is revealed that the exchange was an ambush and Catalina takes Maria away in a helicopter and orders them to kill Claude. Claude escapes and follows the helicopter to the dam. Catalina flies away, leaving Maria on the dam with her men. Claude kills all the men and shoots down the helicopter, killing Catalina. Leaving the dam, Maria begins babbling, and after the screen fades to black, a gunshot is heard. It is unknown if Claude shot Maria or merely fired into the sky in order to shut her up.\nVoice Cast.\nOpen World Design.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\" is considered to be the first 3D game in the series, using Criterion Games' &lt;a href=\"RenderWare\"&gt;RenderWare&lt;/a&gt; game engine. Executive producer &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Houser\"&gt;Sam Houser&lt;/a&gt; had always wanted the series to move to 3D; the development team of \"Grand Theft Auto 2\" had performed some similar tests, and DMA Design had experimented with 3D worlds with games like \"Body Harvest\" and \"Space Station Silicon Valley\". With the release of the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt;, the team felt that a large 3D world was possible. Art director &lt;a href=\"Aaron%20Garbut\"&gt;Aaron Garbut&lt;/a&gt; felt that other video games at the time \"were a thing you played\", wanting Grand Theft Auto III to be \"a place you lived in\".\nWhen designing the game, the development team expanded upon concepts introduced in the previous \"Grand Theft Auto\" games. Benzies stated that the intention was to recreate the \"freedom and diversity\" of the previous games in a \"living, breathing 3D world\", using the power of the PlayStation 2 to do so. The console's ability to use DVDs, an improvement over the PlayStation's limit to CDs, allowed the team to store more data, such as animations, music and environments. Despite this, the team found it difficult to fit the game into the PlayStation 2's 32 megabytes of RAM, due to the scale. The game's size also created difficulties for the testers, due to the variety of options. Benzies felt that creating a living city was the \"underlying principle\" of the game's concept during development. Sam Houser felt that the game's 3D element allowed the \"chemistry of the team [to come] together perfectly for the first time\".\nA major difficulty the team encountered was converting all game elements into a fully 3D world, including the sound and radio stations, as well as designing and voicing the non-player characters, due to the amount that existed within the open world. Producer &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Houser\"&gt;Dan Houser&lt;/a&gt; said there were about 8,000 lines of recorded dialogue in the game, while audio programmer &lt;a href=\"Raymond%20Usher\"&gt;Raymond Usher&lt;/a&gt; estimated about 18,000. The basic technical elements of the game began to work together in mid-2000, with a carjacking mechanic prototype and stable streaming model. Streaming was initially intended to be reserved for music and map geometry, but other elements were eventually included when it became apparent to the team as more data was entered.\nWhen designing the game world, the team initially created a \"hybrid city\", which Dan Houser described as \"a post industrial Midwest slash east coast generic\" city. Upon developing within this game world, the team realized that basing the design on a real location meant \"you have a lot of things you can say about it\". As a result, they redesigned &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, which had been previously featured in the first \"Grand Theft Auto\", basing it loosely on New York City. DMA Design worked with a team at Rockstar in New York for cultural references; the Rockstar team would regularly work long hours for full weeks, ensuring that the references, such as in-game car manufacturers, were appropriate to the city.\nThe city is broken into three islands: an industrial section, a commercial center, and the suburbs, similar to the district separation from the previous game. The islands unlock as the story progresses; the team wanted players to \"start out feeling poor and work to being richer\". Dan Houser described Liberty City as a \"hybrid of a generic American city\", including Chicago, Pittsburgh, Detroit, New York, and Philadelphia; he felt that the parallel realism of the world allowed the team to make more social commentary than previously. Sam Houser cited films and shows like \"Heat\" (1995) and \"The Sopranos\" (1999\u20132007) as inspiration for the setting, and wanted to emulate them in the game. He also cited the influence of \"The Legend of Zelda\", \"Super Mario 64\" and the 1990 film \"Goodfellas\", describing \"Grand Theft Auto III\" as \"a cross between a gangster movie and an RPG\".\nStory and Characters.\nThe team developed the story and design simultaneously. Dan Houser said, \"we use the story to expose the mechanics, and we use the mechanics to tell the story\"; however, he found it difficult to create the narrative, as the game is so strongly focused on player freedom. He wanted the story to be more nuanced and interesting than the generic \"rise and fall and rise again of a superhero bad guy\". The game's script was also focused on mission objectives, attempting to implement high amounts of interactivity. Dan Houser felt that each mission is \"its own short story\", and part of an \"overarching story\". Dan Houser and co-writer &lt;a href=\"James%20Worrall\"&gt;James Worrall&lt;/a&gt; drew influence from mob films and the mafiosi featured in films by ; the team also \"paid a lot of attention\" to shows like \"Miami Vice\" and \"The Sopranos\". When writing the story, Dan Houser and Worrall regularly met with the designers, and filled a room with post-it notes to reconstruct the story components to shape the game.\nMany of the game characters were animated using motion capture, filmed at a rented studio at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, though this was limited by technical constraints. The character movement was also treated as being cinematic, though limited polygons heavily inhibited this. Animating non-player characters entering and driving cars proved to be difficult for the team, due to the variety of vehicle designs. \"It involved chaining together dozens of different animations and altering key frames in code\", recalled software engineer &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Campbell\"&gt;Alan Campbell&lt;/a&gt;. The team used varying camera angles when animating the game's cutscenes in order to evoke different emotions. For the voice acting, the team wanted \"natural, subtle performances\", which proved difficult as many of the actors \"had in their head the idea that because video games are animated, their performances needed to be animated\", explained motion capture director &lt;a href=\"Navid%20Khonsari\"&gt;Navid Khonsari&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe playable protagonist is unnamed in the game, and his name is not officially revealed as Claude until his appearance in \"\". He is a silent protagonist, never speaking throughout his appearances; the team decided upon this primarily because it \"did not seem like a major issue\", due to the other challenges faced during development, and also partly to allow players to identify with the character, as he would be who the players want him to be. The developers did not have \"any one single inspiration\" for Claude; they liked the idea of a \"strong, silent killer, who would be juxtaposed with all of these neurotic and verbose mobsters\".\nSound and Radio Design.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\" features about three-and-a-half hours of in-game radio material. For the music, the team sought a broad diversity to recreate the real sensation of skipping through radio stations, reflecting the gangster movie culture invoked by the game. The team used the talk radio stations to add character to the city and provide a \"unique take on American life\"; Sam Houser described it as \"a very iconoclastic look at America\". The team used real DJs to portray those on the radio. In doing so, they wrote unusual dialogue for the DJs, seeking the effect of \"high production values and absurd content\". Music director &lt;a href=\"Craig%20Conner\"&gt;Craig Conner&lt;/a&gt; assembled the assets of the radio station\u2014music, advertisements, DJ dialogue, and station imaging.\n&lt;a href=\"Chatterbox%20FM\"&gt;Chatterbox FM&lt;/a&gt;, one of the game's radio stations, is entirely talk radio hosted by &lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones\"&gt;Lazlow Jones&lt;/a&gt;, who met Rockstar's managing director &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Donovan\"&gt;Terry Donovan&lt;/a&gt; in 2001 as they were both preparing to travel to Los Angeles for E3. Donovan invited Jones to Rockstar's offices in Manhattan, where he met the development team, including Dan and Sam Houser and producer &lt;a href=\"Jamie%20King\"&gt;Jamie King&lt;/a&gt;, and they invited him to work on the game. The writing sessions took place at Dan Houser's apartment, and the entire process, including editing and recording, took around four to five months. With the station's guests and callers, the writers wanted to satirize American lifestyles, focusing on fictional stories as opposed to quickly outdated stories based on recent news. Jones found the conversations to be natural, having worked in radio for several years. The roles of the guests and callers were performed by Jones' friends and neighbors, including his father, and were recorded in New York.\nCity.\nThe game takes place in Liberty City, which is loosely based on a series of East Coast and mid-western cities, including , , , , and , but without being any one in particular There are different districts in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. It consists of three islands - &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Vale\"&gt;Shoreside Vale&lt;/a&gt;. The three islands are comparatively similar to Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Staten Island, respectively. The city was meant to feature buildings modeled after the then World Trade Center, but last minute edits were made to the game to remove them after 9/11.\nPortland.\nThis is the first area the player will interact with in the game.\nThis is the old industrial district, consisting largely of workmen in old cars, the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Island%20Triads\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Diablos\"&gt;Diablos&lt;/a&gt;.\nStaunton Island.\nStaunton Island is the second of the three districts the player will see in the game.\nThis is the business district. Lots of rich people can be found here, along with their nice cars. The resident gangs are the &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Yardies\"&gt;Yardies&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;Colombian Cartel&lt;/a&gt;.\nShoreside Vale.\nThis is where the ending of the game takes place.\nThis is the suburban area of Liberty City. The wealthy live here, along with the middle-class residents and gangs. The Francis International Airport is also located here. The local gangs are the &lt;a href=\"Southside%20Hoods\"&gt;Southside Hoods&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;Colombian Cartel&lt;/a&gt;.\nDevelopment.\nThe core development team of \"GTA III\" consisted of about 23 people at &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;DMA Design&lt;/a&gt; in Edinburgh, Scotland, who worked closely with publisher &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt; in New York City. The original prototype for the game was created on the &lt;a href=\"Dreamcast\"&gt;Dreamcast&lt;/a&gt; around the end of development on the previous game \"Grand Theft Auto 2\", which led to it being greenlit. By early &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;, the team had designed the city, cars and some weapons. An &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;online multiplayer mode&lt;/a&gt; was initially planned for the game, but was ultimately dropped due to time and resource limitations. Producer &lt;a href=\"Leslie%20Benzies\"&gt;Leslie Benzies&lt;/a&gt; described \"Grand Theft Auto III\" as a \"crime simulation game\". Rockstar originally offered it to Microsoft Game Studios as an &lt;a href=\"Xbox\"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt; exclusive, but Microsoft declined due to the game's adult nature and its poorly-performing predecessors.\nInfluence.\nIt could be said that \"Grand Theft Auto III\" has the third least amount of influences in the entire \"GTA\" series, only having two, which is the movie and the classic TV show as most of the mafia theme in the game was influenced by the both the show and the movie.\nReception.\nUpon release, \"Grand Theft Auto III\" was met with near-unanimous critical acclaim. Various critics praised the game for its story, gameplay, and the near unlimited freedom given to the player; \"GTA III\" was touted as revolutionary by several game review websites and publications.\n\"GTA III\" holds a 97/100 on \"Metacritic\", making it (along with \"\") the highest rated PlayStation 2 game on the website. The game holds a 95% on \"GameRankings\", making it the highest rated PlayStation 2 game on the website, as well the second highest rated game of its year, behind \"Halo\".\n\"Eurogamer\" gave the game a perfect 10, calling it \"A luscious, sprawling epic of a game and one of the most complete experiences I have ever encountered. If this is what I've waited a year to see on my PS2, then I would have waited ten. Magnificent\".\n\"IGN\" heavily praised the game, giving it a 9.6/10, calling it \"a massive scale operation that just gets better and better as players dig into it, even though it gets ridiculously difficult at points.\"\n\"1Up.com\" gave the game an A+, saying \"The best game of the year? Maybe the best game ever\".\n\"GameSpot\" gave the game a 9.6/10. Jeff Gerstmann of \"GameSpot\" stated in his review: \"While the violent nature of the game will surely turn some people off and kids simply shouldn't be allowed anywhere near it, GTA III is, quite simply, an incredible experience that shouldn't be missed by anyone mature enough to handle it\". \n\"Game Informer\" gave it a 9.5/10, stating \"The environments of Liberty City are stunning in scope and detail, dwarfing anything I've ever seen, and your choices are endless\". \n\"GameSpy\" awarded the game with 9.4/10 stating \"A fantastically designed and fun game that's one of the most absorbing, entertaining titles released in a while. It gets better and better with every single day, as you continue discovering new little features here and there.\"\n\"Game Revolution\" gave the game a perfect score, stating \"Just about the best game yet released on the system and one of the most impressive console titles we've ever seen. And I ain't blowing smoke up your tailpipe\". \n\"GamePro\" gave the game a 5/5, stating \"Greatly improved in GTA III is the stunning visual and sound package.\" \n\"GamesRadar\" gave the game a perfect 10, stating \"Almost immediately after your first play you'll realize that underneath the cloak of controversy that will forever shadow GTA3 sits a truly special, groundbreaking and brilliant game. You'll love it.\"\n\"Edge\" was less favorable, rating the game 8/10.\nThe PC version of the game received less positive, yet strong, reception. The PC version has been criticized for performance problems, especially in light of the much smoother performance of Vice City. This was due to technical issues. \"IGN\" gave the PC version a 9.4/10, while \"GameSpot\" gave it a 9.3/10.\nIn 2014, WatchMojo placed \"GTA III\" at the #5 spot in their \"Top 10 Grand Theft Auto Games\" list countdown, as well as in their \"Every Grand Theft Auto Game Ranked\" video over on their sister channel MojoPlays in 2021.\nSales.\n\"GTA III\" emerged with an US$49.95 price, becoming the #1 selling game of 2001 in the United States. The game was later discounted to the price of $19 after becoming one of Sony's \"Greatest Hits\". The game has become the second most best-selling game of 2002, behind its sequel, \"\". As of March 26, 2008, \"Grand Theft Auto III\" has sold 14.5 million units according to Take-Two Interactive.\n\"GTA III\" is the fifth best-selling game of the series, behind \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", \"\", and \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nEditions.\n10th Anniversary Edition.\nThe 10th Anniversary Edition was announced by &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt; during October 2011. The edition was released for mobile phones and tablets, such as iPod, iPhone and Android. The game was released in fall 2011.\nA limited edition of &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; action figure was &lt;a href=\"https%3A//warehouse.rockstargames.com/Product.aspx%3FpSKU%3DRS-FIG-GTA3-CLAUDE%26amp%3BvSKU%3DRS-FIG-GTA3-CLAUDE\"&gt;available for pre-order for $149.99&lt;/a&gt;; only 1,500 pieces were made.\nThe iOS version of \"GTA III\" has received favorable reception, with IGN rewarding it with a 7.5/10.\n\"The Definitive Edition\".\n\"The Definitive Edition\" was announced by Rockstar on October 8th, 2021, as part of the \"\" pack. The edition was released on November 11, 2021, for &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%205\"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PlayStation 4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20Series%20X%20and%20Series%20S\"&gt;Xbox Series X|S&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20Switch\"&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;; and was released on December 14, &lt;a href=\"2023\"&gt;2023&lt;/a&gt;, for &lt;a href=\"Apple%20iOS\"&gt;Apple iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Android%20OS\"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe edition features across-the-board upgrades including graphical improvements and modern gameplay enhancements, while still maintaining the classic look and feel of its original version.\nSeptember 11 Terrorist Attacks.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\" was changed significantly due to the real-world 9/11 terrorist attacks. The game was originally intended to be released on October 3, 2001, however the release was pushed back three weeks, until the 22nd, while &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar&lt;/a&gt; combed through the game's files. Dan Houser claimed that the main reason the game's release was postponed was due to how close &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt;'s head office was to the World Trade Center, and work that had to be done was made impossible due to the circumstances during that period. Dan also claims that, at the time, he came close to cancelling the game's release altogether due to the circumstances; \"This beautiful city has been attacked, and now we're making a violent crime drama set in a city that's not unlike New York City\". Despite this, he claims that it was his duty to release the game, especially considering how close they have come to releasing it.\nSeveral changes were made to the game, however Rockstar claims that the changes made to the game only make it about 1% different. For example, the &lt;a href=\"Police%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;Police car&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;'s color scheme which resembled those of the NYPD's in the early 2000s was changed to an entirely new black and white color scheme, similar to Californian-style police vehicle color schemes. Several aspects of the map were changed, including entire skyscrapers removed due to any possible resemblance of the World Trade Center buildings. The &lt;a href=\"Airtrain\"&gt;Airtrain&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt; was made un-solid, to prevent the player from firing rocket launchers at it, and aircraft flight paths that flew through the city were changed. One mission was removed from the game as it referenced terrorism. Certain radio and pedestrian dialogue was also removed.\nThe game's &lt;a href=\"Boxart\"&gt;Boxart&lt;/a&gt; was changed, too. The original artwork was replaced with an entirely new style of artwork, which is still used to this day - comprising of sections displaying individual pieces of artwork from the game, spread around the box, and the \"Grand Theft Auto\" wordmark situated in the center of the box. The original artwork was still used for the European release of the game.\nAlternate Artwork.\nIn some PAL territories, \"Grand Theft Auto III\" was released with different cover artwork, despite there being no major differences in the game itself. Below are examples of several box arts.\nGallery.\nScreenshots.\n\"The Definitive Edition\"\nOriginal Versions"}

Due to the studio's restructuring circa 2001, the \"Grand Theft Auto III\" project was assigned to New Jersey video game developer Destination Software, who had the intentions of developing a faithful adaptation of \"GTA III\" for the Game Boy Advance hardware after receiving the rights from &lt;a href=\"Take-Two%20Interactive\"&gt;Take-Two Interactive&lt;/a&gt; circa May 2001.\nCrawfish Interactive.\nFor unknown reasons, Destination Software's \"GTA III\" project was cancelled and the rights for the handheld port was given to British video game developer Crawfish Interactive, who later began working on a new version of the Game Boy Advance title under the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt;, the franchise's publisher from New York.\nFormer Crawfish developer Dave Murphy explained, \"My version was set a few months before the events of GTA3.\" and \"[the game] featured a mix of old characters from the PS2/PC version and new ones based on my colleagues.\". He reiterated, \"\"Many of the characters were based on other members of [Crawfish] staff\".\" \nContent.\nStoryline.\nSet just a few months before the events of the original \"Grand Theft Auto III\", the player assumed the role of an entirely new character (name not given) and rose through the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;local mafia&lt;/a&gt; as he chases a mafia deserter and a case full of money from the &lt;a href=\"Callahan%20Bridge\"&gt;Callahan Bridge&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Cedar%20Ridge%20Observatory\"&gt;Cedar Ridge Observatory&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe storyline's concept is similar to that of \"GTA Advance\", where the player assumes the control of &lt;a href=\"Mike\"&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; and chases the assassin of his best friend &lt;a href=\"Vinnie\"&gt;Vinnie&lt;/a&gt; and a case full of money stolen from the duo in a car bombing in the &lt;a href=\"Greasy%20Joe%27s\"&gt;diner&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Callahan%20Bridge\"&gt;Callahan Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. The story's &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Joint\"&gt;final boss fight&lt;/a&gt; also occurs in the observatory's equivalent location.\nVehicles.\nThree vehicles exclusive to the Game Boy Advance were described by Murphy as being \"a Mini, a Monster truck and a secret F1 racing car\". All three vehicles are available in \"GTA Advance\" as the &lt;a href=\"Brit\"&gt;Brit&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Truck\"&gt;Monster Truck&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"F1\"&gt;F1&lt;/a&gt;, the latter appearing as a race tournament reward.\nWeapons.\nOn the subject of weapons, Murphy explained, \"\"I only included two new weapons: &lt;a href=\"Katana\"&gt;Katana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt;. I added these to the design before I really saw anything on so I was kinda disappointed to see they were already in that.\"\" Both weapons were preserved during the studio change, and are available in \"GTA Advance\".\nGraphics.\nOn the subject of the visuals for the handheld title, Murphy explained \"I had always intended on making GTA in the original 2D style because I knew that we wouldn't be able to get it looking very good in 3D. Of course the buildings, trees, fences and pretty much all other pieces of scenery were 3D. I would have liked to make the cars 3D as it would make stunts and rolling look a lot more realistic but we didn't have time and I hoped we would be able to do something like that for a sequel.\"\nMultiplayer.\nFour multiplayer modes were originally planned for the handheld game. Dave Murphy explained, \"Yes multiplayer was planned but we probably wouldn't have got it in there, with the time the project running over.\".\nLeftovers and mentions of these gamemodes can be found in the data files for \"GTA Advance\", unused in the final release.\nCancelled and Rebooted Project.\nOn November 2002, Crawfish Interactive was closed, with the \"GTA III\" project being cancelled once again. At some point after the studio's closure, Rockstar Games employee Susan Cummings was tasked with rebooting the project somewhere else, and immediately thought of the Emeryville company &lt;a href=\"Digital%20Eclipse\"&gt;Digital Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn an interview for Time Extension in June 16, 2023, Cummings explained, \"There were a lot of things [at Rockstar] that started and never happened, like a GTA MMO. There was one in the works at one point, it\u2019s just nothing that ever came of it. [GTA on handheld] would have been one of those projects that were lurking around. I don't remember entirely when I was told we should go find a deal for this, but I had a relationship with Digital Eclipse with Mike Mika and Andrew Ayre and they had a lot of background in handheld, so that\u2019s how we ended up choosing them.\"\n\"Grand Theft Auto Advance\".\nMike Mika was tasked to create an original story that culminates into the events seen in \"GTA III\", under guidance of an unidentified Rockstar senior staff member to make it coherent with the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;established canon&lt;/a&gt; created by Rockstar North. Mike Mika explained \"We pitched a few different story approaches. [...] But ultimately, Rockstar was like, 'Nope, this is how the story's gonna be' and it was better than anything we were coming up with. But we ended up contributing to a lot of that. They weren't sharing exactly where they were going with GTA with us, but they gave us some insights and so we just started building the tech out and the way that we were gonna get the story in.\"\nDigital Eclipse's James Stanley, who was also the producer on the project, accepted the responsibility of fleshing out the story from this initial brief, which would later become Mike's storyline in \"Grand Theft Auto Advance\".\nScreenshots.\nIn July 2003, former Crawfish Interactive programmer Anders Granlund posted eight screenshots of the cancelled title on his website's portfolio. \nEarly Prototypes.\nOn December 27, 2016, \"PtoPOnline\" published a video on his YouTube account showing two different prototypes of the Crawfish Interactive project, both in the early stages of development, with the world map practically empty and only the basic features available, such as movement and top-down camera zooming. \nThe first prototype shown is said to be only 459KB in size and is dated April 12, 2002. It contains a single vehicle used for physics testing, the &lt;a href=\"Cabbie\"&gt;Cabbie&lt;/a&gt; from \"Grand Theft Auto III\". The second prototype, dated April 16, 2002, features debug functions and the automatic camera zoom while driving a vehicle.\nSoundtrack.\nOn May 2022, YouTube account \"Journal of Mysteries\" uploaded six unreleased tracks from Crawfish Interactive's version of \"GTA III\", including the Title Track, and four single-track radio stations returning from the original \"GTA III\" (also mentioned in \"GTA Advance\"s data files) \u2013 &lt;a href=\"MSX%20FM\"&gt;MSX FM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Game%20Radio\"&gt;Game Radio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flashback%20FM\"&gt;Flashback FM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"K-JAH\"&gt;K-JAH&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lips%20106\"&gt;Lips 106&lt;/a&gt;. All (unnamed) tracks were composed by Crawfish Interactive's Steve Collett and seemingly inspired by the core genre tracks of each radio station from the original game."}

The PC version was released on December 3, 2008. \"GTA IV\" and \"\" were released for &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt; via backwards compatibility on February 9, 2017.\nTheme.\nThe very first dialogue by Niko in the very first trailer for the game sets up the first notable immigrant &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt;, Niko Bellic, to enter the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt; and make more critical analysis of American culture than previous main characters have done. \"Grand Theft Auto IV's\" deeper meaning circulates around Niko's own philosophy, and his clear, blunt critiques of American culture and life in general make the deeper ideas much easier to see and understand. Niko is normally shown to be in the right, but is also proven to be overly cynical, leaving interpretation open to the viewer. The game and its very complex plot deals with several themes:\nAs read on the packaging of the game, Rockstar Games asks \"what does the American dream mean today?\". Niko is cynical about America, saying \"capitalism is a dirty business\" and only people who are extremely greedy and/or born into wealth have any opportunity. &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Faustin\"&gt;Mikhail Faustin&lt;/a&gt; also laments before he dies that \"America made him (&lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt;) greedy! ...This American greed takes everyone! It is like a disease!\". Niko mocks American stereotypes like \"strip malls and clinical obesity\" (as do the makers of the game by parodying concepts like and ). On the plus side, Roman Bellic, as well as other characters (&lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bernie%20Crane\"&gt;Bernie Crane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Bytchkov\"&gt;Ivan Bytchkov&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hossan%20Ramzy\"&gt;Hossan Ramzy&lt;/a&gt; among others) are optimistic about America and life in general, tend to do very well for themselves financially, and try in vain to encourage Niko to be more optimistic.\nThe American Dream is also shown not to be promised to anyone, not even when they already live in America. Social circles all the way from &lt;a href=\"Playboy%20X\"&gt;Playboy X&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elizabeta%20Torres\"&gt;Elizabeta Torres&lt;/a&gt; to Patrick McReary all have trouble making and responsibly saving money, not restricting it to any one nationality. Early on, &lt;a href=\"The%20Beat%20102.7\"&gt;The Beat 102.7&lt;/a&gt; explains that their listeners \"don't know how to manage their money yet!\". Gerry McReary describes his family's spending habits as \"Never any fucking focus! Never! ...Oh yeah, wine and women as quick as possible, and remain a slave forever\". Packie eventually says after &lt;a href=\"Diamonds%20Are%20a%20Girl%27s%20Best%20Friend\"&gt;a mission&lt;/a&gt; \"Well, Niko, that was a whole lot of effort for no fucking reward. Story of my life.\" to which Niko replies \"It is the story of a lot of lives, Packie. I'm getting used to hearing it\". \nGrand Theft Auto IV has an extremely complex plot with a very long list of characters. It is also the first game in the HD Universe that allows the player to change the plot by making choices, which all have consequences. This creates an atmosphere where Niko is haunted and shadowed by his past actions wherever he goes. He tells Roman: \"There is no such thing as a new beginning, Roman. With every day we live, we pick up new baggage, baggage we must carry with us for the rest of our lives. There's no dropping it and pretending we are fresh and clean, just because we get off a boat in a new place.\" Prime examples include his numerous encounters with &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt;, most of the &lt;a href=\"Random%20characters\"&gt;random characters&lt;/a&gt;, and working alongside &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt; or Patrick McReary while he had, either by not having met them yet or circumstances beyond his control, killed someone close to them. In the finale, Niko feels the coffin of Kate or Roman, depending on the player's choice, on his conscience because of his criminal lifestyle, saying they \"never should have gotten close to me\". He is deeply depressed about being trapped in the criminal lifestyle (by a need of income), telling Kate McReary and others that he wishes he could leave it behind, but often adds that he knows he can't.\nMain Characters:\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\" is heavily influenced by Russian gangster movies, such as , and its sequel, , and Niko Bellic's physical appearance is based on the character of Sasha, a Bulgarian sniper who works as a mercenary for the Bosnian-Serb Srpska paramilitary organization, from the movie .\nEpisodes.\nTwo have been released for Grand Theft Auto IV for the Xbox 360, and then released for PlayStation 3 and PC in April 2010. &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt; was released on February 17, 2009, and features biker &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt; as the player character. &lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt; was been released on October 29, 2009, with &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Fernando Lopez&lt;/a&gt; as the protagonist. It was simultaneously released with the disc version of Episodes from Liberty City, which features both games. These episodes are set in the same city and time as \"GTA IV\", and have many overlapping storylines, characters, and missions. They add new missions, characters, vehicles, weapons, and other gameplay features.\nComplete Edition.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\": Complete Edition is the latest release of \"GTA IV\" on PC platforms that replaced the original game and its episodes on , released on March 19, 2020 for Steam and &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games%20Launcher\"&gt;Rockstar Games Launcher&lt;/a&gt;. The title was revealed by &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt; on February 19th, after a month from \"GTA IV\" being removed from Steam on January 18th. Players who owned the previous version of \"GTA IV\" or its episodes automatically received \"GTA IV\": Complete Edition with both games.\nRockstar Games reasoning behind pulling the game from Steam was due to , which was what was used on the Steam release of \"GTA IV\" for DRM and online multiplayer. The Games For Windows Live platform was no longer being supported by and therefore wouldn't generate new game keys.\nWhen the Complete Edition was announced, these were the changed stated:\nOther announced details:\nTimeframe.\nAlthough nothing in the game specifically reveals the exact month the events of the game take place, most evidence suggests that it may take place between April and September.\nDevelopment.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\" was developed by &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;Rockstar North&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with several other &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar&lt;/a&gt; studios.\nPreliminary work on the game began in November &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, a month after the release of \"\". Rockstar president &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Houser\"&gt;Sam Houser&lt;/a&gt; felt that following up San Andreas was \"a nightmare\". &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;Rockstar North&lt;/a&gt;, the core 220-person team behind the game, co-opted studios owned by parent company Rockstar Games to facilitate development between a full team of over 1,000, including 50 employees at Rockstar NYC, 40 at &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Lincoln\"&gt;Rockstar Lincoln&lt;/a&gt;, 10 at &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20San%20Diego\"&gt;Rockstar San Diego&lt;/a&gt;, and around 600\u2013700 working part-time internally and externally. Some key members of the development team worked 12-hour days during production, often without holidays. The team decided to continue the numbering scheme absent from the previous two main games to represent the same leap in production as \"Grand Theft Auto 2\" to \"Grand Theft Auto III\". Development of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" ceased by 21 April 2008 when the game was submitted for manufacturing. Producer &lt;a href=\"Leslie%20Benzies\"&gt;Leslie Benzies&lt;/a&gt; estimated that the budget of the development efforts exceeded US$100 million, making \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" one of the most expensive video games ever made.\nResearch and Open World Design.\nThe game's setting, Liberty City, is based on New York City. The team did not look at the previous renditions of Liberty City as inspiration, wanting it to retain the \"general feel\" but nothing else. The map is roughly three times the size of &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; rendition. The developers originally considered using the entire state of New York, before restricting it to Manhattan, and then expanding it out again. They considered including more suburbs with woods, and would regularly vote on which areas to include. Art director &lt;a href=\"Aaron%20Garbut\"&gt;Aaron Garbut&lt;/a&gt; said that the team chose the setting because of the detail and variety it provided, describing New York as \"an amazing, diverse, vibrant, cinematic city\". Writer &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Houser\"&gt;Dan Houser&lt;/a&gt; added that the team \"wanted to be somewhere where we had a foothold\" due to the amount of research required for the world; Rockstar Games's main headquarters are located in New York. The team consciously avoided a precise recreation of New York City to allow for more enjoyable game design, selecting the areas that they felt \"characterised it the best\". Garbut wanted to capture a caricature of the city as he felt that most people were familiar with \"the highlights\" from film or literature but did not need to know the areas precisely. The city was not built with specific missions in mind; the area was created first, and missions implemented later.\nTo achieve a realistic environment, 60\u201370 employees from Rockstar North travelled to New York for research: first at the beginning of the project in March or April &lt;a href=\"2005\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt; for a week and a half, and a smaller trip in &lt;a href=\"2007\"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;. Police officers who previously worked the beat drove the team around Washington Heights. A full-time research team based in New York handled further requests for information, such as the ethnic minority of a neighbourhood or videos of traffic patterns. Videos shot in New York were played on televisions at the Rockstar North offices \"so while they worked they could look up and there was New York\". Benzies claimed that the team took over 100,000 photographs on location in New York, though Garbut estimates that they took around 250,000. They also studied architectural plans for apartments, used satellite images to determine city block layout, researched sales figures for models of cars, and read books that detailed the city's infrastructure, including its subways, sewers, and garbage disposal.\nDan Houser described Liberty City as \"the biggest character\" of the game. The \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" rendition of Liberty City is more detailed and larger in size than most earlier entries in the series; although smaller than &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, the setting of the previous main game, the developers considered it comparable in scope due to city's verticality, number of buildings, and level of detail. The team wanted less dead spots and irrelevant spaces, such as the wide open deserts in San Andreas. They wanted the game to be \"a more focused experience\" than San Andreas, and Dan Houser felt that the limited activities of New York allowed this. The team felt that the addition of Niko's mobile phone added to the immersion of the world and represented society's shifted focus on phones. The in-game brands and products are designed over several years; the billboards were implemented in the game around six months prior to release.\nStory and Character Development.\nThe game's script, written by Dan Houser and &lt;a href=\"Rupert%20Humphries\"&gt;Rupert Humphries&lt;/a&gt;, is about 1,000 pages. Approximately 660 actors provided voices for the game over 80,000 lines of dialogue. After conceiving the character and setting, Dan Houser spoke with his brother Sam Houser and Leslie Benzies to bounce story ideas before writing a rough synopsis, a six-paged, detailed document. Once the synopsis was reworked, the designers broke it into missions, represented by a large flow document demonstrating each section. The writers then work on the introductions to the missions; the gameplay dialogue comes much later. Unlike previous Grand Theft Auto games, \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" does not have cinematic influences. \"We were consciously trying to go, well, if video games are going to develop into the next stage, then the thing isn't to try and do a loving tribute or reference other stuff,\" said Dan Houser. He said that the writers wanted something \"fresh and new and not something that was obviously derived from [a] movie\". Dan Houser felt that the quality of the writing had to improve alongside the advancements in graphics and technology. He noted that the improvements in facial animation allowed for slower-paced cutscenes. The unique dialogue that plays when a mission is retried was to ensure that the gameplay felt \"less canned and less like Groundhog Day\".\nDan Houser described Niko Bellic as \"a more rounded character\" than those in previous games. He felt that his dual personality\u2014often saving innocent people, while also being a \"cold-hearted killer\"\u2014made him more relatable. He also felt that Niko's unfamiliarity with Liberty City allowed for the player to relate to him more, only driven by his vague past and relationship with Roman. When deciding on Niko's background, the writers felt that being an immigrant could lead to more dangerous situations, and therefore more enjoyable missions; after discussions with criminal experts, Dan Houser found that \"the real scary characters are not born in America anymore\". He felt that Niko's outsider view of American culture was \"fun\". The team wanted Niko to be \"more of an anti hero than a hero, capable of making positive actions within his criminal world\". They wanted his demeanour to reflect the weight of his past and choices.\nNiko's design underwent a few changes, but was finalized early in development. His outfit underwent several changes based on Eastern Europeans, particularly photographs of men fighting in winter wars in Yugoslavia and Chechnya. The primary motivation for the design was a face to convey the appropriate emotions and a body that could move nicely with the new animations. The in-game purchasable outfits were also designed to fit with the character. The team ensured that the gameplay choices presented to the player were not too extensive, as they still had to make sense to the character, who is driven by the people around him. Dan Houser felt that the missions in San Andreas had become too linear, and wanted to present choices to the player in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe writers found that Niko needed a motivation to come to America, so they created his cousin, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman Bellic&lt;/a&gt;. Dan Houser felt that the two could not be brothers as there would be a deeper level of familiarity than necessary. He described the two as a double act, with Roman's fantasist charm playing off Niko's tough cynicism. The team gave other non-playable characters (NPCs) more definable behaviours and dialogue to make them feel more alive. The writers initially considered having a smaller group of characters, but found that the story became boring and that players were less likely to explore the world. The &lt;a href=\"Random%20characters/GTA%20IV\"&gt;stranger characters&lt;/a&gt; found in the game world were based on the \"crazy people\" that populate New York, according to Dan Houser, which in previous games were only able to be captured through radio stations or mild pedestrian behaviours. The team based the ethnicities, clothing, and behaviours of the NPCs on the photographs and videos that they captured around New York, divided into different areas; they created mood boards for each location. The NPCs also converse in different languages.\nArt Design.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\" sees a shift in the series to a more realistic and detailed style and tone, partly a result of the transition to consoles which offered high-definition graphics and the new and improved capabilities of such consoles. The development team worked to represent the upgrade in quality across all design aspects while maintaining the coherence of the previous games. The team took the game's development as an opportunity to \"strip things back and start again\", refining the art style without losing the style of the series; they distanced the game from the \"cartoon-like style\" of its predecessors while creating a new style that was consistent across all aspects of the game. Garbut found the increased demand of detail brought on by the advanced technology daunting. A technique used to make the visuals look real was to avoid harsh edges, instead blending surfaces together to make the world look dirty and lived-in. The props department created multiple variations of different objects to make the world more interesting and unique. \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" was the first contemporary game in the series since 2001's Grand Theft Auto III; the team felt that enough time had passed to avoid feeling repetitive. The types of in-game vehicles were decided upon early in development, after which the vehicles department begin creating the designs. The vehicles are not based on specific real-life counterparts, but take elements from several, with some original ideas by the developers.\nTechnical and Gameplay Design.\nThe proprietary &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Advanced%20Game%20Engine\"&gt;Rockstar Advanced Game Engine&lt;/a&gt; (RAGE) was used for the game. Garbut found \"Grand Theft Auto IV'\"s technical design similar to \"Grand Theft Auto III'\"s, with both games being the first in the series to be released on their respective platforms. He claimed that an operable game engine was not finalised until late in development, at which point \"there's still plenty of guesswork\" until optimisation near release. The character's physical performances were recorded using motion capture. Up to eight actors could perform on the motion capture stage at one time, each dressed in a full suit. The camera used to capture the performance included a teleprompter for the actors to read their scripts. Over a hundred moves would be captured in each day of production. The final product was taken from different performances by different actors to make them appear seamless and appropriate. The voice work by one actor could be composited over a different actor's physical performance for a specific outcome. The in-game animations were crafted similarly, using a combination of different motion capture performances.\nFor the gameplay and animations, the team redid a lot of the work from previous games, wanting Grand Theft Auto IV to \"feel next-generation\". The role-playing elements from San Andreas were removed fairly early in development, partly due to the animation work it would have required, and because consistently needing to visit the gym felt antithetical to Niko's motivations. The game's targeting system was one of the first focuses of development due to the advanced technology; the team wanted it to feel realistic without being too technical. The cover system was a \"natural addition\" to the targeting. Benzies described the multiplayer as the hardest part of the game's development. The team wanted the multiplayer to feel like an extension of the cinematic single-player experience. Dan Houser described it as \"a section of a film rather than the whole narrative\". The developers considered adding co-operative multiplayer to the main story campaign, but decided it worked better as a single-player experience.\nWhen Sam Houser first showed interest in using the Euphoria software in the game, he was told that it would be impossible or only limited to cutscenes, but some members of the team were able to make it work. Engineers from NaturalMotion worked on-site at Rockstar North for several months at a time to incorporate Euphoria software into the game. Rockstar also worked with Image Metrics for the game's facial animations. The facial rigs had around 100 joints, with a total of 300 minutes of facial animation. The scale of the project caused some issues for the animators, forcing them to have rigs completed before animation began. They also faced difficulty in the direction of the actor's head\u2014either straight on when looking at the teleprompter, or down when looking at a script. Image Metrics head of production David Barton noted that \"having realistic eyes is 90 percent of the battle\", as it allows the player to believe the character. A head camera was used when recording to capture facial movements. SpeedTree was used for in-game environment rendering.\nMusic Production.\nWhen selecting music for the in-game radio stations, music supervisor &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Pavlovich\"&gt;Ivan Pavlovich&lt;/a&gt; said \"[we had] to pick the songs that make New York today what it is, but make sure they won't feel dated by the time the game comes out.\" The developers contacted over 2,000 people in order to obtain recording and publishing rights; they hired a private investigator to locate the relatives of late Skatt Bros. member Sean Delaney to license the band's song, \"Walk the Night\". \"Billboard\" reported that Rockstar paid as much as $5,000 per composition and another $5,000 per master recording per track. Developers originally considered letting players purchase music in an in-game record shop and for Niko to have an MP3 player, but both ideas were cut. &lt;a href=\"DJ%20Green%20Lantern\"&gt;DJ Green Lantern&lt;/a&gt; produced tracks exclusively for the game's hip-hop radio station The Beat 102.7. Record label owner and record producer Bobby Konders, who hosts the in-game radio station Massive B Soundsystem 96.9, flew to Jamaica to get dancehall artists to re-record tracks to make references to the boroughs of Liberty City. The Housers's father, jazz musician Walter Houser, provided several classical music tracks for the game.\nReception.\nUpon release, \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" was met with overwhelmingly critical acclaim and commercial success.\nXbox 360 &amp; PlayStation 3 versions.\n\"IGN\" awarded the game with a perfect 10/10, with Hilary Goldstein of \"IGN\" feeling that the game \"sets a new benchmark for open-world games\".\n\"GameSpot\" also awarded the game with a perfect 10/10; former \"GameSpot\" employee Jeff Gerstmann praised the narrative and the characters (more particularly, Niko himself) stating that he's \"the only thing that mattered to him\" as he progressed through the story, with the character becoming one of his favorite parts about \"GTA IV\".\n\"GamesRader+\" awarded the game with a perfect 5 stars out of 5, ending their long review with the statement: \"Not only does it go a long way to fixing the problems of previous games but it maintains a level of 'class' and true innovation that other game designers in this genre strive for but never quite reach.\"\n\"GameInformer\" awarded the game with a perfect 10/10. Andrew Reiner said is his review that \"\"Grand Theft Auto IV\" doesn\u2019t just raise the bar for the storied franchise; it completely changes the landscape of gaming. Once you play it, you won\u2019t look at video games the same way again.\"\n\"Eurogamer\" and Edge awarded the game with a perfect 10/10.\n\"Computer\" and Video Games awarded the game with a near-perfect 9.5/10.\n\"1UP+.com\" awarded the game with a A+ ranking.\n\"Metacritic\" awarded the game with 98/100 and it is to this day the highest rated \"Grand Theft Auto\" game in the series, and it is widely regarded by many as .\nIn 2014, WatchMojo placed \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" at the #4 spot in their \"Top 10 Grand Theft Auto Games\" list countdown, and at the #1 spot in their \"Every Grand Theft Auto Game Ranked\" video over on their sister channel MojoPlays in 2021.\nPC version.\nThe PC version of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" was met with the same critical acclaim as the consoles versions, albeit lower.\n\"Metacritic\" awarded the game with 90/100, with reviewers praising the enhanced visuals and the new features while criticizing the port inferiority.\nThe addition of the Video Editor was met with positive reactions; \"GameSpot's\" Calvert called it \"a great way to get creative\", while Kieron Gillen of \"Eurogamer\" criticized the unpredictability in its timing.\nCritics also praised the addition of the customizable &lt;a href=\"Independence%20FM\"&gt;radio station&lt;/a&gt;, which allows players to listen to their own choice of music; Tom Chick of \"1UP.com\" named it the best feature of the port, and Steven Hopper of \"GameZone\" called it a \"great touch\".\nThe port's enhanced visuals were commended by many reviewers.\" GameZone's\" Hopper considered the visuals an improvement over the original versions. Andy Robinson of \"Computer and Video Games\" called the visuals \"impressive\", while Tom Orry of \"VideoGamer.com\" called them \"superb\". Conversely, the port's system requirements, considered difficult to run with advanced settings, received criticism. \"Eurogamer's\" Gillen said that, though the Windows version is \"the most attractive version\", it's \"annoyingly fiddly to get there\". \"GameSpy's\" Tuttle was able to overlook the demanding system requirements in exchange for the game's other features.\nSales.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\" has sold over 25 millions copies, and despite selling slightly worse then \"\", it was still considered as a commercial blockbuster.\nControversy.\nThere was much controversy over \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", continuing the tradition of controversy the series has always been associated with. Figures such as George Galloway, &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Thompson\"&gt;Jack Thompson&lt;/a&gt; and Hillary Clinton harshly criticised the game; Clinton's likeness would parodied in the &lt;a href=\"Statue%20of%20Happiness\"&gt;Statue of Happiness&lt;/a&gt;. New York City officials were also perturbed by the game's New York-inspired setting, though said officials have been accused of hypocrisy as countless crime dramas and action films have taken place in the city years before \"GTA IV\" was released.\nThe initial Australian and New Zealand releases of \"GTA IV\" was pre-censored with blood and sex scenes toned down; a patch was later released which uncensored the Australian console versions.\nA number of real-world crime incidents were also blamed on \"GTA IV\", namely a crime spree perpetrated by a band of teenagers in New Hyde Park, New York in 2008, and on the same year, an attempted carjacking in Thailand where an 18-year-old student murdered a taxi driver which police captain Veerarit Pipatanasak stated that the student \"wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game\", and when a 90-year old woman in Slaughter, Louisiana was shot and killed by her eight-year old grandson after playing the game.\n&lt;a href=\"Little%20Lacy%20Surprise\"&gt;Little Lacy Surprise&lt;/a&gt; was criticized by some outlets for promoting paedophilia. Although similar mentions of sexual deviancy were alluded to in the series lore, in no way does the game encourage or put players in the role of a sex offender. Visiting the site would merely lead to an instant five-star wanted level, as a possible parody of law enforcement response and raids against suspected paedophiles.\nThe drunk driving elements also courted controversy, with Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) calling for the game to be rated Adults Only, which would have \"de facto\" banned the game (as console manufacturers do not allow AO-rated media from being published). Rockstar refuted MADD's accusations, stating \"We have a great deal of respect for MADD's mission, but we believe the mature audience for Grand Theft Auto IV is more than sophisticated enough to understand the game's content.\"\nUpdates.\nBoth the console and PC versions have had numerous updates and patches over the years.\nEnd of \"Games For Windows Live\" support.\nIn January &lt;a href=\"2020\"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;, \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and \"Episodes from Liberty City\" were temporarily removed from &lt;a href=\"Steam\"&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt; due to end of support of &lt;a href=\"Microsoft\"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Games for Windows Live\" platform. As a result, it became no longer possible to generate the additional keys needed to continue selling the PC version of the game.\nAn updated single player-only release of \"\" was released on March 16, 2020 on Steam and the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games%20Launcher\"&gt;Rockstar Games Launcher&lt;/a&gt;. Besides omitting multiplayer functionality, certain songs were also removed from the game due to expiring licenses.\nExisting versions could be optionally &lt;a href=\"Grand_Theft_Auto_IV/Title_Update_Notes/Update_2020-03-19\"&gt;patched&lt;/a&gt; to update the base \"GTA IV\" or standalone \"Episodes From Liberty City\" to the all-inclusive \"GTA IV: The Complete Edition\".\nGame Information.\nGame Content\nGame Features\nMain Articles"}

The only official information released was the four &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV/Trailers\"&gt;trailers&lt;/a&gt; and some 'teaser' updates to the GTA IV websites. Due to this, many fans attempted to extract and leak game information from various sources, which resulted in everything from maps to copies of the game being leaked onto the Internet.\nRight before release of the game on April 29th, reviews began popping up on numerous websites and magazines. Rockstar unusually insisted that the gameplay happened whilst supervised in a hotel room, rather than sending out copies of the game to reviewers. Earlier occurrences of this involved a Rockstar employee playing the game to demonstrate it to reporters, without the press being able to play it themselves. All of them were very positive, with the majority of the press giving out a score of 10/10. Examples of this are from 2 of the internet's most well-known websites, Gamespot and IGN who both gave that perfect score.\nAs a result of the largely impressive review scores for Grand Theft Auto IV, popularity heightened. Even though the game was leaked for illegal download, days before the real street release date, GTA IV experienced a great amount of sales. As stated by Take Two, first-day sales for the game was over 3.6 million, equivalent to $310 million. In its first week, Grand Theft Auto IV sold over 6 million units globally, generating income of approximately $500 million. These staggering sales easily beats out Halo 3's first day ($170 million) and week-long ($300 million) sales, the last record for largest amount of sales in this given time. As Take Two chairman, Strauss Zelnick, stated, \"Grand Theft Auto IV's first week performance represents the largest launch in the history of interactive entertainment, and we believe these retail sales levels surpass any movie or music launch to date.\"\nAccording to retailers more than 60% of all GTA games sold in the first week were the Xbox 360 version, although UK supermarket ASDA reported that their PlayStation 3 version was outselling the 360 version 3 to 1. According to retailers, roughly 40% of Xbox 360 consoles are now bought with a copy of Grand Theft Auto IV, and Xbox sales increased by 54% in the week of the GTA IV launch.\nWithin the first week, GTA IV also became the most played game on Xbox LIVE. More than 2.3 million gamers played GTA IV online in that week, and that had unlocked 12 million achievements worth 100 million gamerscore points between them. The average Xbox LIVE gamer spent 4 hours playing GTA IV online that week, meaning that Xbox LIVE hit 1 million concurrent users within the launch week of GTA IV.\nFan reception of the game, while positive, did not escape criticism. Many fans were quick to note certain features from San Andreas (haircuts, weight gain/loss, and tattoos, among others) being omitted in GTA IV. The driving physics within the game were panned by fans, as many considered the vehicles far too tough to handle, particularly during chases.\nHowever, the story was widely praised by fans, with the character of Niko being considered arguably the most popular protagonist ever in the GTA franchise."}

The changes that usher in the newest GTA are described below.\nGame Mechanics.\n&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt; is powered by Rockstar's own &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Advanced%20Game%20Engine\"&gt;RAGE&lt;/a&gt; game engine, along with the run-time animation engine developed by . Euphoria uses a procedural animation technology called Dynamic Motion Synthesis instead of pre-recorded animations to facilitate player motion, allowing more natural, unscripted movements. DMS animates fully interactive 3D characters \"on the fly\" through real-time simulations of human motor functions, giving each character a \"central nervous system.\" NPCs exhibit different actions and reactions in every scene, so each player's experience is unique and, as a result, more realistic.\nCharacters can cleanly dodge punches, limp away with gunshot wounds, and even get ejected through their vehicle's windshield, all in fluid motions with subtle transitions. Explosions send people flying further than ever before. There is also a new damage system that assesses cosmetic damage to vehicles and objects in the environment through more accurate measures of the force and location of impact. The game uses middleware for facial expressions and lip-synching.\nThe bump maps used to generate landscape topography are much more detailed than in previous GTA universes, allowing the contours of the gamespace to have more texture and depth. Also, the relative speed of in-game &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; is decreased. Every two seconds of play represents one minute of in-game time, so the time it takes to complete a full day is doubled from that of the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D universe&lt;/a&gt;, from 24 minutes to approximately 48 minutes. Load times during exterior-interior transitions in GTA IV have also been removed, adding significantly to the continuity of the game.\nGraphics.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\"s graphics largely benefit from the high-definition capability of the seventh-generation consoles it runs on and the new game engine. New sunlight and weather effects give the environment a vividly realistic appearance as the time of day progresses. Volumetric lighting effects allow sunshine to stream into dusty interiors and fog to darken distant horizons. Modern pixel shaders reflect light in the body panels of clean cars and the glass windows of skyscrapers, and water appears staggeringly wet.\nRoad and building textures are also more varied than in previous \"Grand Theft Auto\" games. Potholes, sewer plates, tar patches, and cracks in the asphalt are highly visible, and no two &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt; exteriors are the same.\nContent.\nMany fans criticized Rockstar for the omission of many features from GTA IV that made so much fun to play. Most of the complaints were about the removal of RPG-like features and customizable elements that were present in GTA San Andreas, such as building muscle or becoming fat; the variety of clothing and tattoos to wear; the modification of cars; and many of the more amusing gameplay elements like the jetpack, parachutes, highly destructive weapons, planes, bicycles, and impractical vehicles. Other gamers commended Rockstar for adding realism, saying the believability benefits the game and enables more focus on the story.\nThe following are some of the changes in content from previous games:"}

Higher settings are provided for future generations of PCs with higher specifications than were widely available at launch.\nGraphics settings are limited by system resources by default. 256MB video cards force minimum settings by default. If a user bypasses these safety measures using command line arguments and exceeds their system resources, the user's gaming experience may be compromised.\nVideo Mode.\nResolution scaling effects water, reflections, shadows, mirrors and the visible viewable distance. The resolution settings relate to the amount of available video memory. At 2560*1600 the game will require 320MB of video memory in addition to all the memory required for content. At 800*600 the game will require 32MB of video memory in addition to the content. Medium resolution settings are recommended for most users as higher settings are only usable if there is available video memory.\nTexture Quality.\nTexture quality affects the visual quality of the content of the game. High setting for textures will require 600MB of video memory at a setting of 21 View Distance in addition to the memory taken by the Video Mode. A medium texture setting is recommended for most users.\nRender Quality.\nRender quality is the texture filter quality used on most things in the world rendering. Most people would know this as anisotropic filtering. Medium settings are recommended for most users and will provide filtering beyond what the console versions can execute.\nView Distance.\nView distance scales the distance in which different objects in the world such as building and cars are seen. Raising this option increases the distance in which high quality objects must be loaded and will increase the memory it requires. Restrictions are established to ensure the game runs optimally for most users. A setting of 22 or more will provide PC users an enhanced experience over the console versions.\nDetail Distance.\nDetail distance scales aspects of the environment that the View Distance setting does not including vegetation, trash and other moveable objects. A setting of 10 would be the equivalent to the performance on a console. This setting has little effect on memory.\nVehicle Density.\nVehicle density scales the traffic density of the traffic in the game. It has no effect on the mission vehicles or difficulty of the game, but can have a significant impact on CPU performance.\nShadow Density.\nShadow Density controls the number of shadows generated for positional lights in exterior environments. These shadows are exclusive to the PC version and can have a major impact on CPU and GPU performance.\nCrossfire/SLI.\nWith the latest ATI driver (8-11 series) the game supports crossfire modes (i.e. 4870x2) SLI is currently unsupported. Support will be added through a future game patch as well as an updated Nvidia driver.\nOther Issues.\nCertain background processes can have a detrimental effect on system performance when playing \"GTA IV\", especially on systems with minimum required system memory. Users should ensure they disable their Anti-virus scans (especially \u201con-access\u201d type scans) when running the game to maximize performance.\nAlt-Tab Error.\nThere have been occasions when a player attempted to Alt-Tab out of that game and their entire computer crashes, this is a very serious error. Downloading patch 1.0.2.0 or higher fixes this problem."}

{"id": "9708", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9708", "title": "Grand Theft Auto IV/Trailers", "text": "Trailer 1: \"Things Will Be Different\".\nThe first trailer for \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", entitled &lt;a href=\"Things%20Will%20Be%20Different\"&gt;Things Will Be Different&lt;/a&gt;, was released on March 29, 2007 at 22:00 UTC. At the time the trailer was released, Rockstar's servers for the trailer's official website became almost immediately overloaded.\nThe trailer is 1:03 in length and features the main protagonist &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, who has a brief monologue: \"Life is complicated; I killed people, smuggled people, sold people. Perhaps here, things will be different.\" The trailer ends with the \"IV\" and fades out to the Rockstar logo.\nThe trailer features several New York City landmarks, including locations and structures resembling the Coney Island Cyclone (&lt;a href=\"Firefly%20Island\"&gt;Firefly Island&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Screamer\"&gt;Screamer&lt;/a&gt;), Times Square (&lt;a href=\"Star%20Junction\"&gt;Star Junction&lt;/a&gt;), the Statue of Liberty (&lt;a href=\"Statue%20of%20Happiness\"&gt;Statue of Happiness&lt;/a&gt;), the Empire State Building (&lt;a href=\"Rotterdam%20Tower\"&gt;Rotterdam Tower&lt;/a&gt;), the Chrysler Building (&lt;a href=\"Zirconium%20Building\"&gt;Zirconium Building&lt;/a&gt;) and the MetLife Building (branded as \"&lt;a href=\"GetaLife%20Building\"&gt;GetaLife&lt;/a&gt;\"). You will notice the Ferry Terminal and the way letters are missing. This shows us it isn't all pristine and still has all that GTA charm. The trailer uses a similar cinematic style to Godfrey Reggio's 1982 documentary film \"Koyaanisqatsi\" and used Philip Glass's original music from the film (the opening and closing stanzas of the track \"Pruit-Igoe\") as well as emulated time-lapsed filming from \"The Grid\".\nRockstar has stated that all the trailer's footage is in high-definition 720p, generated real-time by the game's &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Advanced%20Game%20Engine\"&gt;RAGE&lt;/a&gt; engine, running on an actual game console.\nThe music used in this trailer is \"Pruit Igoe\" by Philip Glass, which is featured on &lt;a href=\"the%20Journey\"&gt;the Journey&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrailer 2: \"Looking For That Special Someone\".\nOn June 28, 2007 at 12:00 EST, the second trailer was released, entitled &lt;a href=\"Looking%20for%20that%20Special%20Someone\"&gt;Looking for that Special Someone&lt;/a&gt;. The Trailer is 1:06 in length and begins with many aerial shots of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; before showing Niko in conversation whist in the remodeled car the \"Stallion\" who replies \"We're all looking for that special someone\". It also reveals Niko can hold on to the backs of vehicles and skids of helicopters, however it is unknown if these are user-controlled actions or are in &lt;a href=\"cutscene\"&gt;cutscene&lt;/a&gt;s only. It also displays improved particle effects, particularly on weapons, and demonstrates the increased force of the police. &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; is also partly revealed in the second trailer, and unlike Niko he does not speak with an Eastern European accent. &lt;a href=\"El%20Burro\"&gt;El Burro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"8-Ball\"&gt;8-Ball&lt;/a&gt; make cameos as their game art is depicted as graffiti on a building opposite the Bank of Liberty, motorcycle artwork is also apparent on the wall. Other recurring elements from the \"GTA\" series appear in the trailer as well; &lt;a href=\"Binco\"&gt;Binco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sprunk\"&gt;Sprunk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell&lt;/a&gt; to name a few.\nThe song played in the second trailer is \"Arm In Arm (Shy Child Remix)\" by a New York-based band, The Boggs, which is featured on &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Broker\"&gt;Radio Broker&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrailer 3: \"Move Up, Ladies\".\nThe third trailer, entitled &lt;a href=\"Move%20Up%2C%20Ladies\"&gt;Move Up, Ladies&lt;/a&gt;, was released on December 6, 2007. This video contains a variety of dialogue and action sequences. The trailer was announced along with the unveiling of the official on November 28, 2007. The song played in the trailer is \"King Ring\" by Seryoga, which is featured on the in-game radio station &lt;a href=\"Vladivostok%20FM\"&gt;Vladivostok FM&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrailer 4: \"Everyone's a Rat\".\nThe fourth and final trailer before the release of GTA IV was released on March 27, 2008. Like Trailer 3 before it, this trailer contains a lot of action sequences, and displays the game's Euphoria physics as well as the new particle effects and explosions. The song played in the trailer is \"Real Mckoy\" by Mavado, which is featured on &lt;a href=\"Massive%20B%20Soundsystem%2096.9\"&gt;Massive B Soundsystem 96.9&lt;/a&gt;.\nOfficial Grand Theft Auto IV TV Commercial.\nOfficial Grand Theft Auto IV TV Commercial is the trailer meant to be aired on television commercials. Usually parts of this videos are used in commercials and not all of it. The song used in the trailer is \"Vagabond\" by The Greenskeepers, which is featured on &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Broker\"&gt;Radio Broker&lt;/a&gt;.\nFall 2008 TV Commercial.\nFall 2008 TV Commercial is the trailer for the PC version of GTA IV. The song used in the trailer is \"Cry\" by Godley &amp; Creme, which is featured on &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Rock%20Radio\"&gt;Liberty Rock Radio&lt;/a&gt;.\nGTA IV Teaser Trailers.\nOn 8 February 2008, Rockstar Games released five teaser trailers for \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nOn 21 February 2008, two further teasers were released.\nOn 7 March 2008, another two teasers were released.\nOn 11 April 2008, two teasers were released.\nOn 25 April 2008, a teaser was released.

Unlike its &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;predecessor&lt;/a&gt;, the game was never considered as an online component/multiplayer mode for \"Grand Theft Auto V\" by the developers. The game is also Rockstar Games' most ambitious project since \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", and it is claimed the ideas for the online game had been percolating since 2001. \nEditions.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" has three distinct editions; the former original edition, for the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt;, which was shut down on December 16th, 2021; the \"enhanced\" edition, for the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PlayStation 4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; and \"Expanded &amp; Enhanced\" version for the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%205\"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20Series%20X%20and%20Series%20S\"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; which includes a standalone version that no longer requires \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" to access.\nFree access to the original versions of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" was first granted to \"Grand Theft Auto V\" players on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 with &lt;a href=\"Grand_Theft_Auto_V/Title_Update_Notes/Update-2013-10-01\"&gt;patch 1.01&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of September 10, 2018, the versions of the game for Windows Vista are no longer available.\nAs of December 16, 2021, the original versions of the game for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 are no longer available.\nThe game was made available for everyone to purchase as a standalone game for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series XS in March 2022. \nAs of January 30, 2024, the versions of the game for Windows 7 and Windows 8, Windows 8.1 are no longer available. \nSetting.\nThe game is set in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Southern San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and the island of &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico\"&gt;Cayo Perico&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;.

Unlike many other games where players can create their own character, physical appearance is not user-defined, but derived from the pre-set parent and grandparent characters that players choose. With the Collectors Edition of the game, several bonus characters from other Rockstar titles make 'cameo' appearances as a possible &lt;a href=\"Mom\"&gt;Mom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dad\"&gt;Dad&lt;/a&gt; in the character creation tool \u2014 \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" protagonist &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; can be selected as a parent, along with &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Misty\"&gt;Misty&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\". Furthermore, if the player has a &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games%20Social%20Club\"&gt;Rockstar Games Social Club&lt;/a&gt; account, &lt;a href=\"John%20Marston\"&gt;John Marston&lt;/a&gt;, the protagonist from Rockstar-made \"\", becomes a potential Dad option.\nThe enhanced version of \"GTA Online\" for &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PlayStation 4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;, features a much bigger and in-depth variety of customization options, and players who have transferred their characters from the previous gen (or from the Xbox One/PlayStation 4 in the case of the PC) will have the chance to customize their character again.\nOnce confirmed, the player's appearance can only be modified at a cost of GTA$100,000 (Enhanced Edition only), although characters can be further customized in-game by purchasing clothing, &lt;a href=\"Tattoo%20Parlors\"&gt;tattoos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barbers\"&gt;haircuts&lt;/a&gt; and masks from shops around &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;; such items can be continually changed or removed as many times as the player desires. As well as appearance, players can also select their character's typical daily activities, which will affect his/her initial skills. Players can create two characters (three other character slots were visible on 7th generation consoles but were locked and could not be used) if they so choose, and any money stored in a bank account will be shared across all characters (although money in the character's pocket and RP do not carry over). The player can also select different &lt;a href=\"Character%20Actions\"&gt;actions&lt;/a&gt; to be performed by their characters, they can be used during &lt;a href=\"Free%20Mode\"&gt;Free Roam&lt;/a&gt; and before and after any of the competitive matches.\nWhen speaking into a microphone, the player's character's mouth will move. However, they are generally regarded as very taciturn by non-playable characters. For instance, Trevor often refers to the player as, \"My favourite mute.\" Based on a quote from &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt;, it is implied that if the player calls someone then exits the call, they don't say anything, but rather simply breathes heavily into the phone. Similar comments are made about the player from &lt;a href=\"Agent%2014\"&gt;Agent 14&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"The%20Humane%20Labs%20Raid\"&gt;The Humane Lab Raid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20Heist\"&gt;The Diamond Casino Heist&lt;/a&gt;. In one instance, during the cutscene with Ron Jakowski after buying the &lt;a href=\"Hangars\"&gt;Hangar&lt;/a&gt;, Ron asks the protagonist why they took so long to come, but as soon as they try to speak they are interrupted by Ron.\nPlot.\nThe game's narrative begins in 2013, several months before \"Grand Theft Auto V\". Players take on the role of a silent protagonist who moves to Los Santos in search for new pursuits. Upon arrival, they meet with &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt;, whom they befriended on Lifeinvader. &lt;a href=\"Mall%20or%20Nothing\"&gt;After a street race against the player&lt;/a&gt;, Lamar introduces them to drug dealer &lt;a href=\"Gerald\"&gt;Gerald&lt;/a&gt; and corrupt Armenian car salesman &lt;a href=\"Simeon%20Yetarian\"&gt;Simeon Yetarian&lt;/a&gt; for work. As the player slowly builds up their reputation, they attract the attention of individuals like meth dealer &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;, the hacker &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt;, and Mexican drug lord &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin Madrazo&lt;/a&gt;, who also employ them.\nEventually, the player is offered bigger job opportunities by Lester, who recruits them to rob &lt;a href=\"Fleeca%20Job\"&gt;a branch of the Fleeca Bank&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Standard\"&gt;the main branch of the Pacific Standard Public Deposit Bank&lt;/a&gt;; a shady government agent known only as &lt;a href=\"Agent%2014\"&gt;Agent 14&lt;/a&gt;, who has them break &lt;a href=\"Prison%20Break\"&gt;a convicted spy out of prison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Raid\"&gt;raid a government-run lab&lt;/a&gt;; and Trevor, who enlists their help with a &lt;a href=\"Series%20A\"&gt;highly profitable drug deal&lt;/a&gt;. Later, Lamar also hires the player for a few jobs, which mostly consist of . However, this only leads to Lamar having a falling out with his own gang, so he attempts to win back their trust, once again with the player's help. During this time, the player slowly builds up their own criminal empire, starting with an initially small &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organization&lt;/a&gt;, which is subsequently expanded by purchasing an &lt;a href=\"Offices\"&gt;office&lt;/a&gt; and several &lt;a href=\"Warehouses\"&gt;warehouses&lt;/a&gt; to aid the player in the &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo\"&gt;theft and sale of various goods&lt;/a&gt;. Some time later, the player also starts a &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Clubs&lt;/a&gt; and begins running &lt;a href=\"The%20Open%20Road\"&gt;additional illicit businesses&lt;/a&gt; with a shady contact known as \"&lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Long John Teabag&lt;/a&gt;\". Later the player purchases a &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Warehouses\"&gt;vehicle warehouse&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;steal, store and sell expensive cars&lt;/a&gt; along with an &lt;a href=\"Underground%20Garage\"&gt;underground garage&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicle%20Work\"&gt;store modified vehicles used to do jobs for various clients.&lt;/a&gt;\nWith the 2017's update, the timeline of the events has advanced in real-life timing, and each new update events taking place in their respective release years. By this time, the protagonist continues to expand their empire by purchasing a &lt;a href=\"Bunkers\"&gt;bunker&lt;/a&gt;, from where they conduct a &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations\"&gt;gunrunning operation&lt;/a&gt; alongside Agent 14 and a &lt;a href=\"Hangars\"&gt;hangar&lt;/a&gt;, to help them &lt;a href=\"Air%20Freight%20Cargo\"&gt;run a smuggling operation&lt;/a&gt; with Trevor's former associate &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Jakowski\"&gt;Ron Jakowski&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the following years living in Southern San Andreas until the early 2020s, the player opens a new &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs\"&gt;nightclub&lt;/a&gt; in Los Santos with the help of former Liberty City nightclub entrepreneur &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt; and begins using it as a front for their &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs/Sell%20Goods\"&gt;illicit businesses&lt;/a&gt;; becomes a top competitor in a &lt;a href=\"Arenawar\"&gt;demolition derby-like TV series&lt;/a&gt; taking place at the city's &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank%20Arena\"&gt;Maze Bank Arena&lt;/a&gt;; becomes a VIP member at the newly opened &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20%26amp%3B%20Resort\"&gt;Diamond Casino &amp; Resort&lt;/a&gt; and begins assisting the staff with the various problems they are facing; helps a retired Lester Crest plan a &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20Heist\"&gt;robbery of the casino&lt;/a&gt; using an &lt;a href=\"Arcades\"&gt;arcade business&lt;/a&gt; as a front for &lt;a href=\"Georgina%20Cheng\"&gt;Georgina Cheng&lt;/a&gt; who seeks retribution against &lt;a href=\"Thornton%20Duggan\"&gt;Thornton Duggan&lt;/a&gt; for tricking her brother &lt;a href=\"Tao%20Cheng\"&gt;Tao&lt;/a&gt; into selling him the casino; conducts &lt;a href=\"Gerald%27s%20Last%20Play\"&gt;several new jobs&lt;/a&gt; for Gerald, and enters a &lt;a href=\"A%20Superyacht%20Life\"&gt;short-lived conflict with the Kkangpae&lt;/a&gt; after they raid their &lt;a href=\"Galaxy%20Super%20Yacht\"&gt;personal yacht&lt;/a&gt;, which ends with the player killing the &lt;a href=\"The%20Boss%20%28Kkangpae%29\"&gt;gang's leader&lt;/a&gt;; they are hired by Martin Madrazo's son &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Madrazo\"&gt;Miguel&lt;/a&gt; to steal some &lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Files\"&gt;incriminating files of his family&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist\"&gt;drugs, cash and gold&lt;/a&gt; from the world's most notorious drug dealer and cartel boss, &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Strickler\"&gt;Juan \"El Rubio\" Strickler&lt;/a&gt;, from his &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico\"&gt;private island&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; using a &lt;a href=\"Kosatka\"&gt;nuclear submarine&lt;/a&gt;; They later become a member of the &lt;a href=\"LS%20Car%20Meet\"&gt;LS Car Meet&lt;/a&gt;, where they are introduced to &lt;a href=\"Moodymann\"&gt;Kenny \"KDJ\" Dixon Jr.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sessanta\"&gt;Sessanta&lt;/a&gt;, who provide the player with several &lt;a href=\"Contracts\"&gt;robbery contracts&lt;/a&gt; after they purchase an &lt;a href=\"Auto%20Shops\"&gt;Auto Shop&lt;/a&gt; and prove themselves to them; begins working for the former street hustler now multi-millionaire &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, and for his &lt;a href=\"Agencies\"&gt;new business&lt;/a&gt;; is hired by &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper%20contact\"&gt;Agent ULP&lt;/a&gt; as a sworn-in IAA special agent to &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Paper%20Trail\"&gt;investigate a criminal conspiracy&lt;/a&gt; involving &lt;a href=\"Duggan%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;local petrochemical magnates&lt;/a&gt;; starts their own &lt;a href=\"Acid%20Lab\"&gt;LSD business&lt;/a&gt; with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Fooliganz\"&gt;Fooliganz&lt;/a&gt; gang; help a group of ex-military personel expose &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt;'s government contracts; runs a salvage yard business with &lt;a href=\"Jamal%20Amir\"&gt;Jamal Amir&lt;/a&gt;; performs &lt;a href=\"Dispatch%20Work\"&gt;unofficial police work&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Cluckin%27%20Bell%20Farm%20Raid\"&gt;disrupts a South American criminal operation&lt;/a&gt; with officer &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20Effenburger\"&gt;Vincent Effenburger&lt;/a&gt;; and runs a &lt;a href=\"Bottom%20Dollar%20Bail%20Enforcement\"&gt;bail enforcement agency&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Jenette%20Eccles\"&gt;Jenette Eccles&lt;/a&gt;.\nDevelopment.\nOriginally developed to be a &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;regular multiplayer mode&lt;/a&gt; for \"Grand Theft Auto V\", Rockstar North development team brought back an old idea they had since the initial development of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" of creating a living \"GTA\" massive multiplayer online world. The project was rebooted as an independent multiplayer game titled \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", sharing the same engine and certain features from \"Grand Theft Auto V\" but intended to expand over time. According to former Rockstar North president Leslie Benzies, Rockstar choose to release \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" in early October 2013, as in their own words, they \"wanted it to be known as a different entity, separate from GTA V\".\nThe game was conceived as a separate experience to be played in a continually evolving world. Up to 30 players freely roam across the game world and enter lobbies to complete jobs (story-driven competitive and cooperative modes). The &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; toolset lets players create their own parameters for custom jobs, like racetracks and deathmatch weapon spawn points. Players may band together in organised player teams called &lt;a href=\"Crews\"&gt;crews&lt;/a&gt; to complete jobs together. &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games%20Social%20Club\"&gt;Rockstar Games Social Club&lt;/a&gt; extends crews formed in \"Max Payne 3\"'s multiplayer mode to those of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\". Players may create their own crews and join up to five total. Crews win multiplayer matches to earn experience points and climb online leaderboards.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\" launched on 1 October 2013, two weeks after \"Grand Theft Auto V\"'s release. Many players reported connection difficulties and game freezes during load screens. Rockstar released a technical patch on 5 October in an effort to resolve the issues, but problems persisted the second week following launch as some players reported their character progress as having disappeared. Another technical patch was released on 10 October combating the issues, and Rockstar offered a GTA$500,000 (in-game currency) stimulus to the accounts of all players connected to \"GTA Online\" since launch as recompense. Because of the widespread technical issues present at launch, many reviewers bemoaned their Grand Theft Auto Online experience but generally recognised its open-ended exploration and dynamic content as strengths.\nPost-release content is continually added to \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" through free title updates. Some updates add new game modes and features, and others feature themed gameplay content, such as the &lt;a href=\"Independence%20Day%20Special\"&gt;Independence Day Special&lt;/a&gt; update that added patriotic-themed content on 1 July 2014. The widely anticipated update launched on 10 March 2015 and suffered some initial technical difficulties due to the increased user load. Shortly after the game's PC release, some players reported being banned from \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" for using field of view and cosmetic mods in single-player. Rockstar stated in their official blog that nobody had been banned from Online for using single-player mods, but that recent updates to the PC version had the \"unintentional effect\" of making such mods unplayable. They stated that mods are unauthorised and may cause unforeseen technical problems and instabilities.\nGameplay.\nThe game consists of open world sessions based in San Andreas. Originally, sessions were limited to 16 players on &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;Playstation 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt;. Sessions were expanded to 30 players (with 2 extra spaces for spectators) on &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PlayStation 4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers can play Online in a number of different session types:\nUntil the release of the update, most of the Online content could be played by a single player with no actual multiplayer requirement, however, subsequent content updates have included more co-operative jobs that require a minimum of 2 or 4 players and new Free Mode events and features have been limited to Public lobbies only. This was later changed with the 2020 update, which introduced the first Heist that could be played solo. The subsequent updates introduced a \"Single-Player Element\" to the game, where all of the new content can be played on Private lobbies by a solo player.\nExcept for PC and PlayStation 3 users, a PlayStation Plus (for PS4 and PS5 users) or an Xbox Live Gold Subscription is required before playing \"GTA Online\".\nPlayers may travel around and interact with the map at will and can take part in many gameplay activities, including assaults on local gangs, robbing armored trucks, and challenging other players to &lt;a href=\"Impromptu%20Races\"&gt;Impromptu Races&lt;/a&gt;. Several of these open world activities are unique to the \"GTA Online\", while others were originally from \"GTA V\". Players can also purchase property, vehicles, clothing, masks and weapons for their character.\nAside from the free roam aspect, \"GTA Online\" also includes several localized, more traditional multiplayer game modes known as &lt;a href=\"Jobs%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Jobs&lt;/a&gt; that are played in separate sessions independent from the larger open world; players partaking in these jobs will not be visible to and cannot interact with players occupying the open world, even if they inhabit the same location at the same time. These jobs include deathmatches, races, sports activities and horde-like survival games. Lastly, players can also undertake co-operative missions for various crime boss characters, most of whom also make appearances in \"GTA V's\" story. The number of players involved and the size of the area available to them in these game modes varies depending on the activity and mode itself.\nAs players progress and increase the rank of their character, more items and jobs will be unlocked for them to purchase and play. Also included in \"GTA Online\" is the &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;, a development tool that allows players to create and publish their own races, deathmatches, and other competitive gamemodes.\nAdditional rewards are given, such as free weapons and double RP, if the player is connected to &lt;a href=\"http%3A//socialclub.rockstargames.com/\"&gt;Rockstar's Social Club&lt;/a&gt; and a special event is hosted or a special offer is redeemed by the player. Special bonuses are also available for players who reach Rank 100 and beyond.\nIntroduction and Tutorial.\nWhen players first select to play \"GTA Online\" they are taken through a character creation stage where they can modify their character's appearance and basic characteristics. The game then begins with the player's newly created character arriving at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt; aboard a commercial flight. Upon leaving the airport, the player is met by &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt;, who drives the player into the city.\nLamar serves as a guide through the initial tutorial portion of the game, introducing the player to the basic gameplay mechanics of the Online world. After completing a street race and taking part in a brief mission - disrupting a drug deal - Lamar introduces the player character to &lt;a href=\"Gerald\"&gt;Gerald&lt;/a&gt;, the first of \"GTA Online\"'s mission-giving bosses. At this point, players are granted access to the entire &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; map, and are immediately tasked by Lamar with purchasing some new clothing, and then holding up a convenience store. With these tasks completed, the player is contacted by &lt;a href=\"Simeon%20Yetarian\"&gt;Simeon Yetarian&lt;/a&gt;, who guides the player through the process of stealing a car and turning it into a personal vehicle (by fitting it with a tracker and purchasing insurance at a &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; mod shop, both of which are free on this occasion). Following the completion of these mandatory activities, the player is introduced to one more job, an LTS, after which the tutorial is complete and players are free to explore the Online map as they wish.\nThe PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series XS versions feature the &lt;a href=\"Career%20Builder\"&gt;Career Builder&lt;/a&gt;, designed to give new players \u2014 or anyone who wants to reset their character and get a fresh start \u2014 a helpful leg-up in the criminal world of Southern San Andreas, giving them a business property, a vehicle, and a weapon \u2014 with room to add useful upgrades and a little extra GTA$ to begin.\nGeneral.\nCompleting virtually any activity in \"GTA Online\" rewards players with both &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt;, used for in-game purchases, and &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;Reputation Points&lt;/a&gt; (RP). As players gain RP and increase their &lt;a href=\"rank\"&gt;rank&lt;/a&gt;, new items such as weapons, hair styles, clothes and vehicle mods will be unlocked for purchase, while new missions and jobs, such as &lt;a href=\"Parachuting\"&gt;Parachuting&lt;/a&gt;, will become available to play. Some missions may however not reward the player with any money if they are played solo, particularly sport activities in \"GTA Online\". Many high rank missions offer far greater monetary and RP rewards than low rank missions. At higher ranks additional gameplay abilities will also become available through contacts on the player's &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;mobile phone&lt;/a&gt;, such as asking &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; to remove a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Wanted Level&lt;/a&gt;, set a &lt;a href=\"Bounties\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; on other players or calling &lt;a href=\"Merryweather\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt; to conduct an airstrike.\nWhen the player dies in \"GTA Online\" for the first time in Free Mode, &lt;a href=\"Cris%20Formage\"&gt;Cris Formage&lt;/a&gt; appears in a vision telling the player that he is reviving them. He goes on to explain &lt;a href=\"Passive_Mode\"&gt;Passive Mode&lt;/a&gt;, and the voyeuristic pleasure he derives from watching people without their knowledge. He appears only once, the first time the player dies.\nJobs in \"GTA Online\" can either be accessed from the open world, in the form of a blue circular marker (known as a corona) that the player simply walks into to activate the corresponding job, or selected through a list in the pause menu. Jobs have a specified number of possible players, often with an option to play it alone for smaller jobs. Players can either host the jobs themselves or elect to join a job already in progress. The player may also receive job invites from NPC characters, or other players via their phone. These invites will eventually close in real-time as players join and the player quota is reached for each invite.\nWhen a job is launched, an invite screen will launch with various options depending on whether the player initiated the job or joined from an invitation. Before almost any job, players can bet on themselves or other players in order to gain bigger payouts at the end of the job. There are options for the radio station to play during the job, purchasing ammo and armor, starting weapon, time of day and difficulty (with corresponding payout) level. At the end of each job, after gaining any points or money from the job, the player has the option to continue playing with the same players, and is given the opportunity to vote on which job to next complete with that team, a random job, or to return to free mode, leaving the current team of players.\nAlthough several activities from \"GTA V\" are available in \"GTA Online\", such as purchasing clothing and sports, there are numerous differences in the gameplay mechanics involved. For instance, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; will never attempt to arrest the player in \"GTA Online\", instead shooting to kill even at one star wanted levels. The severity of wanted levels changes depending on the players' actions, with an automatic three star wanted level for killing a police officer, or a four star wanted level for trespassing at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;tanks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"P-996%20Lazer\"&gt;fighter jets&lt;/a&gt; will be scrambled.\nMany of the characters featured in \"GTA V\" re-appear in \"GTA Online\" in the form of mission-giving bosses, with the notable exception of &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; (although &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; do appear in such a role). Several other boss characters are unique to \"GTA Online\", such as &lt;a href=\"Gerald\"&gt;Gerald&lt;/a&gt;, although he was first mentioned in \"GTA V\". Chronologically, \"GTA Online\" was originally set before the events of GTA V; for example, &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin Madrazo&lt;/a&gt; is often found at his &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo%27s%20house\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Hills\"&gt;Vinewood Hills&lt;/a&gt; which is destroyed early in GTA V by Michael, while Trevor, aside from the events in the Series A heist, is still based solely in &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, the player character in \"GTA Online\" is briefly mentioned by Lester at the start of the mission &lt;a href=\"Casing%20the%20Jewel%20Store\"&gt;Casing the Jewel Store&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA V\", although he dismisses them as \"too unpredictable\". This timeline has moved in the Enhanced editions with the addition of subsequent DLC containing anachronistic elements and dialogue confirming events were taking place in the present day.\nIf a player is seen to be creating an excessive &lt;a href=\"Mental%20State\"&gt;negative effect&lt;/a&gt; on the Online world, they will accumulate Bad Sport points. When enough of these points are either accumulated through a short period of time (or gathered up for longer periods) the offending player will be moved into a separate match-making pool which will prevent the player from playing with non bad-sport players, people in their friend list included. The player will also be forced to wear a dunce hat (which will be taken off inside vehicles or replaced by motorcycle helmets on bikes). These bad sport points are gathered and bound to a character by destroying personal vehicles belonging to other players, quitting jobs/mission early, submitting false reports and being reported. This system has proven to be a controversial mechanic as the system has several flaws to it as to just how these points are gathered as the game does not take into account whether player reports are illegitimate or not, or if the destruction of another player's vehicle was self-defense. As of title update 1.22, players who are innocently disconnected from a job due to a crash or game fault will not have Bad Sport points applied. A fair balance between players are enforced through this system. The first time the player goes into a bad-sport lobby, the time in bad-sport will be 2 days, then 4 days, then 8 days.\nMoney and Lifestyle.\nMoney. along with RP, is the core basis for the \"GTA Online\" economy. Players can purchase almost any item in game including apartments, garages, clothes, cars, aircraft and more. With regular updates to \"GTA Online\" these options will continue to change and evolve over time. Money is also required to launch jobs.\nMoney is earned through most activities in the game: Performing missions, convenience store robberies, selling cars, surviving/killing bounties, completing heists, and more. Rockstar also offers players the option to purchase in game cash using real life money in the form of Shark Cards.\nUsing their cash players can purchase garages and apartments that allows players to store purchased vehicles. These cars known as personal vehicles can then be used in &lt;a href=\"Free%20Mode\"&gt;Free Mode&lt;/a&gt;, race modes and in missions. Although the player is able to steal cars and turn them into personal vehicles, high-end vehicles must be purchased through the &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Motorsport\"&gt;Legendary Motorsport&lt;/a&gt; website.\nProperties come in four classes - Garages, ranging from $25k-$100k+, Low-end apartments, ranging from $80k-$120k, Mid-range apartments, varying from $125,000-$150,000, and High-end apartments, ranging from $205k-$400k. High-end apartments include a 10-car garage, the most expensive apartment is the Eclipse Towers Apartment 3 at $500,000, although it is worth noting that all $205k+ apartments have the same interior, and it is the view and location that add the most value. Rockstar has since added $400,000-$500,000 apartments, all of which have a redesigned interior. Since &lt;a href=\"The%20High%20Life%20Update\"&gt;The High Life Update&lt;/a&gt;, players are able to own up to two properties, and since the &lt;a href=\"Festive%20Surprise\"&gt;Festive Surprise&lt;/a&gt; players can now own a third property. The update implemented a fourth property slot, but exclusive to the enhanced version players. The update allowed players to customize high-end apartments and mansions and yachts are available for purchase, albeit for the enhanced version players only.\nCrews.\nThe game implements the Rockstar Games Social Club's &lt;a href=\"Crews\"&gt;crew system&lt;/a&gt; with two types of crews. Private crews are mainly aimed at a group of friends or associates to play online together and can hold as many as 1,000 people. Public crews are much larger and can have unlimited members. The use of crews and teamwork is heavily encouraged by Rockstar, as the player receives more money in races depending on how many players are in the game, also, the player receives a 10% bonus to RP for playing with friends and 20% for playing with crew members. On top of this, many missions (particularly from &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt;) involve the use of teamwork to succeed. The crew system in \"GTA Online\" also encourages customization and personalization, with the addition of crew emblems that can be placed on vehicles and crew colors.\nJobs.\nThere are approximately 500 jobs in \"GTA Online\" and even more are added as part of DLCs. Jobs can be encountered in many ways, including stumbling on them on the map, calling or receiving a phone call from an NPC, or choosing one of the menu. Races can be entered with modded personal vehicles. Players can also create their own race tracks and deathmatches using the &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;.\nMissions are received from various characters most of which are present in \"GTA V\". &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; are the only two of the three central characters to appear in \"GTA Online\", however &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin Madrazo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Jakowski\"&gt;Ron&lt;/a&gt; also make appearances.\nIn mission lobbies, the player can scroll through a list of players in the current lobby, or invite friends to join. While scrolling, a menu shows up showcasing the highlighted players Driving, Shooting, Flying, Sneaking, and Stamina skills.\nVehicles.\nMany new things can be done with vehicles in \"GTA Online\". As stated before, cars can be locked to prevent them being stolen, and the player can also buy car insurance just in case their car is stolen during free roam, destroyed, or lost. Once a player has insurance, the car can get destroyed an infinite number of times without ever needing to renew the insurance. However, high-end vehicles (which have a retail value over $100,000) can be stolen and driven in-game, but cannot be made into Personal Vehicles, nor can they be sold or modified at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; (they must be bought legitimately).\nSocial Club.\n Like in \"Max Payne 3\", players can form Crews using the Rockstar Games Social Club. As a reward for signing up to the Social Club, a free &lt;a href=\"Sawed-Off%20Shotgun\"&gt;Sawed-Off Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; will be available to acquire from &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Elegy%20RH8\"&gt;Elegy RH8&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Motorsport\"&gt;Legendary Motorsport&lt;/a&gt; website.\nPlayers can be in up to 5 crews at one time and perform Heists and other activities together. When players form Crews in \"GTA Online\" they can be identified via the crew colour, which would cover half of the outside of their white marker, there is a new Hierarchy system to set ranks amongst players. \nDownloadable Content (DLC).\nRockstar operates a continual update program for \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", periodically releasing free content updates that introduce new features, vehicles, weapons and game modes into the game. Several of these updates, particularly themed updates based around a particular holiday or significant date, have been time-limited updates that are automatically rendered unavailable again after the update period has expired.\nEvents.\n&lt;a href=\"Events%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Events&lt;/a&gt; are periodic occasions in which discounts and bonuses are typically offered in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nEvents first appeared after the release of the &lt;a href=\"Ill-Gotten%20Gains%20Part%202\"&gt;Ill-Gotten Gains Part 2&lt;/a&gt; update and soon became a fundamental part of \"GTA Online\" in the enhanced release of the game, particularly when content updates for &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt; versions of the game were discontinued.\nDuring events, prices of existing content, new and old, are often cut, usually by 25%. As well as this, Double GTA$ and RP is usually awarded on certain game modes. As well as weekly occurrences, events are also prominent in re-releasing exclusive content, mainly during national holidays. Occasionally, major special events are hosted to celebrate the upcoming release of an update, or a major part of \"GTA Online\", or even real-world history.\nSubscription Service.\nAvailable exclusively on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", on March 29, &lt;a href=\"2022\"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;, Rockstar Games launched &lt;a href=\"GTA%2B\"&gt;GTA+&lt;/a&gt;, a paid subscription service which promised subscribers with extra monthly benefits for membership, including a monthly deposit of GTA$500,000, free vehicles and properties, as well as discounts across the board.\nAdd-Ons.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V: Story Mode\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" is a singleplayer game title, considered a separate game by Rockstar, from which the initial access to \"GTA Online\" originated. It can be purchased separately as an add-on for the standalone versions of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\". Players can experience the interwoven stories of &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; across the sun-soaked metropolis of Los Santos and the backwoods countryside of Blaine County in greater detail than ever before with stunning all new levels of visual detail. The game shares the same &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; map, although set in 2013.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V: Story Mode\" requires a retail copy of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" to play. Alternatively, players can purchase \"Grand Theft Auto V\" as a full game, and get free access to \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" through the menus or the &lt;a href=\"Character%20Wheel\"&gt;Character Wheel&lt;/a&gt;.\nReception.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\" received mixed to positive critical reception from critics and fans alike. \nMetacritic awarded the Xbox 360 version with 83/100 and the PlayStation 3 version with 80/100.\nVideoGamer.com awarded the game with 9/10. Jon Denton thought the gameplay's \"endlessness\" made up for its broken launch and he also found progression more streamlined and balanced than before and thought the \"grind of just doing PvP until co-op Jobs arrive with regularity\" was lost. However, he noted frequent server disconnection, especially during load screens.\nGRYOnline.pl awarded \"GTA Online\" with a positive 7.5/10, declaring that \"the fun is tremendous\", but saying that the game's potential is \"not fully realized\".\nDestructoid awarded the game with 7/10, Chris Carter felt the \"messy launch\" should have been delayed, but he claimed that he had \"the most fun in a online game\". Carter concluded that \"one day \"GTA Online\" will reach its true potential with a massive map creation tool and more playable content than pretty much every genre outside of MMOs \u2014 of this [he has] no doubt, given how deep Rockstar's coffers are. But for now, it's best to tread lightly until all of the kinks are worked out.\"\nGameSpot originally awarded the game with 7/10 in 2013, but Carolyn Petit of GameSpot later changed the score to 6/10 in her updated review in 2014.\nDigital Spy awarded the game with 3 stars out of 5, Liam Martin of Digital Spy heavily criticized the terrible launch; as in his review he said that he lost his character data and considered the technical issues dwarfed his pre-launch anticipation, despite this, he praised the heists' designs as he thought the Heists update encouraged teamwork and \"pinpoint coordination\".\nIGN were the most critical towards \"GTA Online.\" Keza MacDonald of IGN panned the disastrous launch of the game, she also felt that gameplay's \"addictive rhythm\" eventually faltered as errands became a monotony. Dan Stapleton of IGN reported low player counts in matches, long wait times in lobbies, server disconnection and occasional crashes, he commented on his review: \"I can't strongly recommend... the multiplayer experience alone\". Ryan McCaffrey of IGN however praised the addictive gameplay loop of \"GTA Online\", as he found high replay value in the heists' volatile action. To this day, \"GTA Online\" hasn't been given a rating by IGN as of 2023.\nReception has improved over time. VG247's Patrick Garratt felt the \"San Andreas Flight School\" update incentivised player engagement with the oft-neglected aircraft missions by offering more liberal reward payouts. Eurogamer's Stanton enjoyed the strategic planning necessary to pull off a successful heist and thought players were required to think on their feet and adapt to changing scenarios. He further noted occasional gameplay pacing issues and technical hiccups such as mid-mission server disconnection.\nBans.\nIf a player is reported by enough players or is discovered to be using identifiable cheats (such as &lt;a href=\"Modifications%23Modifications%20on%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;a mod menu&lt;/a&gt;) by Rockstar's automated anti-cheat system, there is a chance that they may be banned from \"GTA Online\". With each ban, the player's characters are completely reset back to Level 0, deleting all progress they had in the game. All vehicles, properties, businesses and stats are also reset. All money is also reset, minus any Shark Cards (they are deposited into the player's bank).\nThe first time a player is banned, the banning period is 30 days. The second ban is permanent.\nBefore October 2016, a player could receive a first ban of 14 days, the second one of 30 days, and the third one being permanent. Players did not lose all their progress, only losing their illegitimate funds.\nThis feature is arguably one of the more controversial features of \"GTA Online\", since some players claimed to be banned innocently for using programs that hook an overlay (for example, Skype). This also includes hackers being able to easily evade bans whereas other, non-hacking players, were banned with viable evidence often being turned down."}

On September 12 the game's re-release was announced and it was released on November 18 on consoles, with a PC release delayed until April 14, 2015. The enhanced edition features ingame Special/Collector Edition content as bonus features which players can buy via in-game cash (although original owners of the special/collectors will continue to get these for free).\nFor the first time, &lt;a href=\"First-Person%20View\"&gt;First-Person View&lt;/a&gt; on foot and in vehicles is implemented and players are free to switch between this and &lt;a href=\"Third-Person%20View\"&gt;Third-Person View&lt;/a&gt; on-the-fly. \nOn April 14, 2015, the enhanced edition was released for PC, more specifically for Windows Vista and greater.\nStarting with September 10, 2018, the enhanced edition is no longer available for Windows Vista.

Plus, a new standalone version of \"GTA Online\" for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S was also made available (for free for the first three months to PlayStation 5 players).\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\" for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S features new graphics modes with up to 4K resolution, up to 60 frames per second, texture and draw distance upgrades, HDR options and ray-tracing, as well as across-the-board improvements including faster loading times, increased population and traffic variety, increased vegetation density, improved lighting quality across shadows, water reflections, and other elements.

Platform-specific features also include immersive audio using Tempest 3D positional audio on PlayStation 5 and Spatial Sound on Xbox Series X|S.\nPlayers can choose from one of three detailed new graphics settings to tailor their gameplay experience for what matters most to them, fidelity, performance, or both. \nAdditional Content.\nA new &lt;a href=\"Career%20Builder\"&gt;Career Builder&lt;/a&gt; feature designed expressly for new players \u2013 or anyone who wants to reset their character and get a fresh start \u2013 to get an introductory leg up in the criminal world of Southern San Andreas. With this system, the player gets a GTA$4,000,000 windfall to select an initial career path from: &lt;a href=\"Offices\"&gt;Executive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bunkers\"&gt;Gunrunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs\"&gt;Nightclub Owner&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Clubhouses\"&gt;Biker&lt;/a&gt; which include Business Properties with pre-set upgrade packages and optional Vehicles, and Weapons.\n&lt;a href=\"Hao%27s%20Special%20Works\"&gt;Hao's Special Works&lt;/a&gt;, a new auto shop located within the &lt;a href=\"LS%20Car%20Meet\"&gt;LS Car Meet&lt;/a&gt;, encompasses best-in-class vehicle upgrades, a new class of Races using specially modified vehicles, and a weekly rotation of Hao's Special Works Time Trials, along with a Premium Test Ride, where the player can get behind the wheel of these newly modified vehicles for free. Hao's Special Works will allow players to upgrade select vehicles (5 new vehicles and 5 existing vehicles at launch) for elite driving performance that takes full advantage of the upgraded power of new console hardware.\nFurthermore, \"GTA Online\" for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S has an assortment of new quality of life improvements, including a newly designed introduction and tutorial for new players, a new front-end &lt;a href=\"Entry%20Screen\"&gt;Main Menu&lt;/a&gt; that allows players to jump directly into Freemode, Heists, Races, Adversary Modes, the latest featured weekly event content, and more. There are changes to the &lt;a href=\"Pause%20Menu\"&gt;Pause Menu&lt;/a&gt; to allow switching to any type of Free Mode session.\nCharacter Transfer.\nPlayers could transfer their original console version progress to the \"Enhanced\" version until March 6, 2017. Players could continue to play the character(s) on either platform independently.\nFor the 9th generation console version of \"GTA Online\", PS4 and Xbox One players could also transfer both their \"GTA Online\" characters and progression to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S with a one-time migration at launch. However, this originally moved the profile rather than copying it like the previous transfer, meaning players would have to decide which platform to restart from scratch on if they wanted to continue playing them both independently. After the San Andreas Mercenaries update, this is no longer the case, instead allowing the profile to be copied and sent over to the PS5 or Xbox Series X|S versions. The profile remains the same on PS4 or Xbox One, allowing players to continue progress on both platforms. Any progress made on the PS5 or Xbox Series X|S cannot be transferred back to the older version, and any progress made on PS4 or Xbox One after the transfer cannot be copied over again."}

The music becomes more intense as certain objectives are completed or certain tasks are performed, for example, after firing weaponry at &lt;a href=\"Merryweather\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt; Units in &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Standard%20-%20Convoy\"&gt;Pacific Standard - Convoy&lt;/a&gt;, a drum beat and heavier rhythm will be introduced into the soundtrack.\nSo far, there are 8 Heist Soundtracks in \"GTA Online\". Any track can play in any heist at any appropriate moment, however, some appear in heists more common than others.\nOne soundtrack can be found in the game files, but is not featured in any of the final heist setups or finale missions.\nAlternate variants of several heist tracks were used during Rockstar Games Livestreams.

Like other mission themes, the songs intensify or de-intensify as the mission/work progresses.\nSmuggler's Run soundtracks were composed by \"Oh No\".\nNew soundtracks were added with the update. These soundtracks will play during &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Heist\"&gt;The Doomsday Heist&lt;/a&gt; series. Some of the stems are remixes from the original update soundtrack.\nThere are also several &lt;a href=\"Adversary%20Modes\"&gt;Adversary Mode&lt;/a&gt; soundtracks yet to be used.\nDoomsday Heists soundtracks were composed by \"Oh No\".\nOther Soundtracks.\nThis track is heard when loading the game at any point. Depending on how long the game takes to load (further depending on the platform), the soundtrack has different parts. The loading theme used was created by &lt;a href=\"Tangerine%20Dream\"&gt;Tangerine Dream&lt;/a&gt;, named \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D7PhxujOJ1-c\"&gt;Mona Da Vinci&lt;/a&gt;\", from 2011.\nWhen flying in a vehicle without the radio on (but the music volume on full), eventually a flying theme will play. It will become more and more intense as the player flies around. It begins to fade once the player nears the ground, or fully lands. This soundtrack was originally from \"GTA V\"s Official Score and plays in both \"GTA Online\" and \"GTA V\". Land vehicles which can fly, such as the &lt;a href=\"Deluxo\"&gt;Deluxo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oppressor\"&gt;Oppressor&lt;/a&gt;, do not activate this soundtrack.\nWanted Level Soundtrack.\nOnce the player gains 3 stars or more, a Wanted Level Soundtrack will begin to play. The soundtracks can only be heard on foot, or in a vehicle when the radio is turned off.\nPattern.\nAt 3 stars, the soundtracks will remain low pace, \"calm\" and a small beat will be heard. The soundtrack usually introduces itself with a small rhythm or a high pitched noise, in most cases, this will lead to a long, slow, low-intensity beat.\nAt 4 stars, the soundtrack will change its pace. A strong beat will be introduced, or if there already was one, it will become more intense and notable. High pitched, long electronic sound effects found on 3 stars usually fade away, to make the beat stand out.\nAt 5 stars, the soundtrack is at its most intense beast. Not much of a notable difference can be heard between the 4th and 5th star; in most cases, it takes several seconds to hear a notable difference in pace. Small, quick rhythms will become notable, and the beat of drums will vary.\nAfter 5 stars, a section known as the \"Cooldown Zone\" occurs. This happens when the player begins to lose the police. In simpler form, it reduces its pace, rhythm and returns back to its 3 star form. It will become much more intense and quiet, and if the player goes underground, for example, in the subways with a 5 star wanted level, the sound is echoed more for effect, adding a \"tip-toe\" noise effect. Once the stars are lost, a \"whisper\"-style whistle will occur, and the soundtrack will end.\nSome of the following tracks are exclusive to the player's location. For example, some may only play in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, and some may only play in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;.\nScore.\nSo far, in the original release of \"GTA Online\" and \"GTA V\", there are 11 wanted level themes. \nSeveral exclusive soundtracks were added in the enhanced release (XB1/PS4/PC) of \"GTA Online\" and \"GTA V\". Some of these are new, or are adaptions of the original scores. So far, there are 13 wanted level themes.\nTrack Names.\nThis lists the in-game file names and soundtrack titles of the soundtracks featured in \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nAdded in the Enhanced Version.\nBy &lt;a href=\"Tangerine%20Dream\"&gt;Tangerine Dream&lt;/a&gt; and Woody Jackson\nAdded in the update.\nBy &lt;a href=\"Tangerine%20Dream\"&gt;Tangerine Dream&lt;/a&gt; and Woody Jackson\nAdded in the update.\nBy &lt;a href=\"The%20Alchemist\"&gt;The Alchemist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oh%20No\"&gt;Oh No&lt;/a&gt; and Woody Jackson\nAdded in the update.\nBy \"&lt;a href=\"James%20Curd\"&gt;James Curd&lt;/a&gt;\"\nAdded in the update.\nBy \"&lt;a href=\"James%20Curd\"&gt;James Curd&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"Holy Fuck\"\nAdded in the update.\nBy \"&lt;a href=\"Take%20A%20Daytrip\"&gt;Take A Daytrip&lt;/a&gt;\"\nAdded in the update.\nBy \"&lt;a href=\"Oh%20No\"&gt;Oh No&lt;/a&gt; \"(unconfirmed) and \"Show Me The Body\"\nAdded in update.\nBy \"Oh No \"(unconfirmed)\nAdded in the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20San%20Andreas%20Super%20Sport%20Series\"&gt;Southern San Andreas Super Sport Series&lt;/a&gt; update.\nCurrently the composer for these tracks is unknown.

The state of &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; is also about five times larger than \"\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"Red Dead Redemption\". After some calculations by members of &lt;a href=\"http%3A//gawdalmighty.com/\"&gt;GawdAlmighty.com&lt;/a&gt;, that would equal to around 27.5 square miles/71.2 km2 when land and sea are put together.\nCharacters and Premise.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" features three playable protagonists: &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;.\nMichael is a retired professional bank robber, who after making a sweet deal with the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt;, is forced out of retirement back into the life of crime. \nTrevor is the loose cannon in this story and is also the long time best friend of Michael and a hothead psychopath as well. \nLastly Franklin, a younger gangbanger and repossession agent who has a large amount of experience behind the wheel, who meets Michael when undertaking a repossession.\nOther main characters include &lt;a href=\"Amanda%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Amanda&lt;/a&gt;, Michael's wife; &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Jimmy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tracey%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Tracey&lt;/a&gt;, Michael's two grown-up children; &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar&lt;/a&gt;, Franklin's closest friend; &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Jakowski\"&gt;Ron&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor's paranoid friend; and &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester&lt;/a&gt;, a long-time associate of Michael and Trevor.\nTimeframe.\nAlthough it is not specifically stated when exactly in 2013 the game takes place, the following evidence suggests August - October 2013:\nEditions.\nEnhanced and PC Versions.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/52261/Grand-Theft-Auto-V-Coming-this-Fall-to-PlayStation-4-Xbox%257Cofficial\"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; of the eighth generation consoles and PC versions, there was wide speculation and anticipation regarding an official announcement from Rockstar. On change.org, there was a petition with 728,000+ signatures asking for a PC version at the time of the announcement. Within the comments section of the Rockstar Newswire, and many other GTA related blogs, there were many comments asking for a PC/Next Gen release. After its reveal at E3 2014, the news spread like wildfire and became one of the most talked-about announcements.\nThe enhanced version of \"Grand Theft Auto V\" was released on November 18, 2014, for the PS4 and Xbox One and was released for PC on April 14, 2015. With the release, there are many improvements and changes compared to the versions released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. No major graphical changes from PS4 and Xbox One are seen in the PC version, other than further Draw Distance and 4K capable quality. The PC version also features 2 exclusive radio stations: &lt;a href=\"The%20Lab\"&gt;The Lab&lt;/a&gt; (now available for all consoles from the &lt;a href=\"Ill-Gotten%20Gains%20Part%202\"&gt;Ill-Gotten Gains Part 2&lt;/a&gt; update) and &lt;a href=\"Self%20Radio\"&gt;Self Radio&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe biggest new feature was a &lt;a href=\"first%20person%20view\"&gt;first-person view&lt;/a&gt;, which is not only available in vehicles but is also for the first time available on foot. Several other features were added. These include (see &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Editions%23Editions%20comparison%20-%20Enhanced%20editions%20vs%20Original%20editions\"&gt;edition comparison table&lt;/a&gt; for more information):\nHobbies and Pastimes.\nThese are all the hobbies and pastimes listed on the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Social%20Club\"&gt;Rockstar Social Club&lt;/a&gt; page; note that they are not all mandatory to achieve 100% completion in the game.\nDevelopment.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" was developed by &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;Rockstar North&lt;/a&gt; in collaboration with most other Rockstar studios around the world.\nRockstar North began to develop \"Grand Theft Auto V\" in &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, around \"Grand Theft Auto IV'\"s release. Development was conducted by a team of more than 1,000 people from studios around the world. The proprietary &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Advanced%20Game%20Engine\"&gt;Rockstar Advanced Game Engine&lt;/a&gt; (RAGE) was overhauled for the game to improve its draw distance rendering capabilities. The Euphoria and Bullet software handle additional animation and rendering tasks. Having become familiar with the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; hardware over time, Rockstar found they were able to push the consoles' graphical capabilities further than in previous games. Analyst estimations place the game's combined development and marketing budget at more than \u00a3170 million (US$265 million), which would make it the most expensive game ever made at that time.\nThe open world was modelled on Southern California and Los Angeles, and its design and in-game render constituted much of the game's early work. Key members of the game world production team took field research trips throughout the region and documented their research with photo and video footage. Google Maps projections of Los Angeles were used by the team to help design Los Santos' road networks. To reflect and reproduce Los Angeles' demographic spread, the developers studied census data and watched documentaries about the city. The team considered creating the open world the most technically demanding aspect of the game's production.\nA fundamental design goal from the outset was to innovate on the series core structure by giving players control of three lead protagonists instead of one. The idea was first raised during Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas' development, but contemporaneous hardware restrictions made it infeasible. Having developed two \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" episodic expansion packs featuring new protagonists in &lt;a href=\"2009\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;, the team wanted to base \"Grand Theft Auto V\" around three simultaneously controlled protagonists. The team viewed it as a spiritual successor to many of their previous games (such as \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", \"Red Dead Redemption\" and \"Max Payne 3\"), and designed it to improve upon their gameplay mechanics. They sought to improve the action gameplay by refining the shooting mechanics and cover system and reworked the driving mechanics to correct \"Grand Theft Auto IV'\"s awkward vehicle controls.\nAfter an audition process, &lt;a href=\"Ned%20Luke\"&gt;Ned Luke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shawn%20Fonteno\"&gt;Shawn Fonteno&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Steven%20Ogg\"&gt;Steven Ogg&lt;/a&gt; were selected to portray Michael, Franklin and Trevor, respectively. Their performances were mostly recorded using motion capture technology, but dialogue for scenes with characters seated in vehicles was recorded in studios instead. The game features an &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V%20Official%20Score\"&gt;original score&lt;/a&gt; composed by a team of producers collaborating over several years. Licensed music provided by an in-game radio is also used. The team licensed more than 241 tracks shared between fifteen radio stations, with an additional two stations providing talk radio. Some of the tracks were written specifically for the game, such as rapper and producer &lt;a href=\"Flying%20Lotus\"&gt;Flying Lotus&lt;/a&gt;' original work composed for the &lt;a href=\"FlyLo%20FM\"&gt;FlyLo FM&lt;/a&gt; radio station he hosts.\nGameplay.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" evolves nearly every mechanic that was in the previous \"Grand Theft Auto\" games. As far as driving goes, the vehicles have been greatly improved, with Rockstar running more complex physics on them, such as making some cars hold to the ground slightly better. The driving mechanics feel more like a racing game, particularly the ' series, compared to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\"s rocky, boat-like handling system. The shooting mechanics are better in terms of the feel of the mechanics and larger compared to the melee mechanics in the game, that being said, melee has been improved over the previous titles as well. Weapon selection has now also been changed. Instead of the old way of selecting through all the weapons sequentially, there is now a &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Wheel\"&gt;Weapon Wheel&lt;/a&gt;, which is similar to the one featured in \"Red Dead Redemption\", another game made by Rockstar Games. \"Grand Theft Auto V\" draws inspirations from many different Rockstar titles in the past, including \"&lt;a href=\"Max%20Payne\"&gt;Max Payne 3&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Midnight Club\", \"&lt;a href=\"Manhunt\"&gt;Manhunt&lt;/a&gt;\", and '.\nThere are many unique features in the game; one being that when the players are playing as one of three protagonists in the game, the other two are living their independent daily lives, and the player may be surprised by what they find the characters doing when they switch back into them. Another unique feature is that the &lt;a href=\"Character%20Wheel\"&gt;character swapping feature&lt;/a&gt; is executed in a -styled manner and was displayed during a \"Game Informer\" demo, which was shown to have run smoothly and without lag. The &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PlayStation 4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt; versions present an exclusive feature, the &lt;a href=\"First-Person%20View\"&gt;first-person mode&lt;/a&gt;, where the whole game can be played through the eyes of the protagonist. This gameplay mode presents a whole new way to play the game. Cars have detailed &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features%23Working%20Dashboards\"&gt;interiors&lt;/a&gt; different from one another; shooting is like that of a dedicated FPS game.\nNew activities have been added, such as &lt;a href=\"yoga\"&gt;yoga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Triathlon\"&gt;triathlons&lt;/a&gt;, jet skiing, &lt;a href=\"Parachute%20Jumps\"&gt;parachuting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tennis\"&gt;tennis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Scuba%20Diving\"&gt;scuba diving&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Random%20Events%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;Random events&lt;/a&gt; have also been added to the game and can appear anytime as the player explores around the map. The &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;mobile phone&lt;/a&gt; has returned from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and is used for calling the player's contacts, surfing the web, and quick saving. Giving people the middle finger is another new feature the player can use while in a vehicle. Rockstar recommended that the player do this in various locations around Los Santos to see the outcome; depending on where the player is at, they will get varied reactions from pedestrians.\nRockstar has also made changes to the pedestrian mechanics; some pedestrians can be seen at the bus stops in &lt;a href=\"East%20Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;East Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, and the same people can reappear in &lt;a href=\"Rockford%20Hills\"&gt;Rockford Hills&lt;/a&gt; working in the gardens of the opulent mansions. Some minor mechanics that help convey the environment and appearance of Los Santos occur at certain times of day, such as a sprinkler system being turned on in the morning in wealthy areas like &lt;a href=\"Morningwood\"&gt;Morningwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nVehicles.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" has more vehicles than in any other \"Grand Theft Auto\" game to date, with a variety of vehicles, including aeroplanes, helicopters, cars, utility vehicles, emergency service vehicles, motorcycles, and jet skis. Players are able to fly planes, which was a cut feature from \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" because of the limited size of the map, but the feature is now available in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" because of the much larger, open world map. There are also &lt;a href=\"Submersible\"&gt;submarines&lt;/a&gt; that players are able to use to explore the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; from previous \"GTA\" titles has returned, including a new complex aiming system and a realistic depiction of a tank. A new feature also allows the player to roll-over a vehicle when the car is flipped upside down.\nLike all previous games, a wide array of vehicles spawn driving around the map that can be stolen. To give the game a sense of realism and make the map feel more alive, various vehicles (as well as pedestrians) spawn in &lt;a href=\"Vehicles%20in%20GTA%20V/Scenarios\"&gt;scenarios&lt;/a&gt; to make them more interactive with the map, such as delivery vans pulling out of alleyways, emergency vehicles responding, or vehicles pulling in and out of driveways. This behaviour was present in \"GTA IV\" to a lesser extent and is revamped in \"GTA V\", even more so with the enhanced release of the game, where modified vehicles can spawn driving around, as well as the presence of the fully-controllable &lt;a href=\"Jet\"&gt;Jet&lt;/a&gt;, among other planes flying high above &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;.\nBusinesses.\nBusinesses from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" re-appear. New businesses also appear, such as the &lt;a href=\"Bugstars\"&gt;Bugstars&lt;/a&gt; pest control company, who specialise in fumigation and the fast-food restaurant, &lt;a href=\"Up-n-Atom%20Burger\"&gt;Up-n-Atom Burger&lt;/a&gt;. The option to eat takeaway food from outlets such as &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt; is no longer available. Instead, the player can only buy drinks from the various &lt;a href=\"Vending%20Machine\"&gt;Vending Machine&lt;/a&gt;s across the map.\nWeapons.\nThe game features a large variety of weapons, including assault rifles, machine guns, handguns, shotguns, sniper rifles and rocket launchers. There is now the option to mount &lt;a href=\"attachments\"&gt;attachments&lt;/a&gt; onto various different guns, each one affecting the performance. Melee weapons like the &lt;a href=\"nightstick\"&gt;nightstick&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"golf%20club\"&gt;golf club&lt;/a&gt; that weren't present in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" have also been introduced to \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nCharacter Customization.\nIn the game, the player has the option to customize the three protagonists' wardrobe and appearance. There is less customisation available compared to that of \"\" (e.g. changing the body mass of the 3 characters isn't available as it was with Carl Johnson in San Andreas). The availability of tattoo parlours, barber shops and the ability to apply and remove facial hair has returned from \"GTA San Andreas\" after being missing from previous titles in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nReception.\nUpon release, \"Grand Theft Auto V\" received overwhelmingly universal acclaim and commercial blockbuster worldwide. Critics enjoyed the multiple lead character formula, heist mission design and presentation, while some critics weren't fond of the story and characters.\n\"Metacritic\" awarded the game with 97/100, making it the second highest rated \"Grand Theft Auto\" game in the series and the 11th highest rated game of all time.\n\"Play\" awarded the game with a 97/100, they considered it as a \"generation-defining\" and \"exceptional\" \"Grand Theft Auto\" game in the series.\n\"Famitsu\" awarded the game with 40/40, making it the second western-developed game to received a perfect score from &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"IGN\" awarded the game with a perfect 10/10, Keza MacDonald of IGN called \"Grand Theft Auto V\" in his review as \"one of the very best video games ever made\".\n\"Edge\" awarded the game with a prefect 10/10, they wrote in their review that \"GTA V\" is a \"remarkable achievement\" in open-world design and storytelling.\n\"GameInformer \"awarded the game with a near perfect 9.75/10, Matt Bertz really enjoyed the combat in \"GTA V\", noteing that players are kept \"in the thick of the action\" during shootouts.\n\"Eurogamer\" awarded the game with 9/10, Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer wasn't keen on the protagonists (more particularly Trevor) as he found him as \"shallow and unconvincing\", and felt that his eccentricities hurt the narrative and overshadowed Michael and Franklin's character development.\n\"GameSpot\" awarded the game with 9/10, former \"GameSpot\" employee Jeff Gerstmann considered the heist missions a welcome deviation from series typical mission structure and Carolyn Petit of \"GameSpot\" cited the 1995 film as a stylistic influence on the heists mission design.\n\"GamesRadar+\" awarded the game with a perfect 5 stars out of 5, Hollander Cooper of \"GamesRadar+\" said in his review that the story and the characters was the weakest part of the game, as he thought the game negated inconsistencies in the story of previous entries, whose single lead protagonists had muddled morality.\n\"Joystiq\" awarded the game with a near perfect 4.5 stars out of 5.\n\"The Escapist\" were the least fond towards \"GTA V\", awarding the game with a 3.5 stars out of 5, Greg Tito had difficulty connecting with the characters' emotions since they acted out of greed with no sense of morality and thus gave players little reason to support them.\nIn 2014, WatchMojo placed \"GTA V\" at the #2 spot in their \"Top 10 Grand Theft Auto Games\" list countdown, and at the #3 spot in their \"Every Grand Theft Auto Game Ranked\" video over on their sister channel MojoPlays in 2021.\nSales.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" has sold over 205 million copies as of 2024, making it the best selling \"Grand Theft Auto\" game in the series and the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_games\"&gt;second best selling video game&lt;/a&gt; of all time.\nControversy and Criticism.\nLike all previous \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" games, \"Grand Theft Auto V\" has courted controversy, though has been viewed by some as significantly more controversial than its predecessors.\nControversy (missions).\nA &lt;a href=\"By%20the%20Book\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; which requires the &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; to torture a &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Kerimov\"&gt;target&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; has proven significantly controversial. The mission contains water-boarding, using a wrench on kneecaps and genitals, electrocution, and even an action where the player can perform tooth extraction using pliers.\nCriticism.\nBoth \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" received criticism. One part was missions, as only three made the player profit, and only one of them topped $1,000,000. Missions were longer, more taxing and low to non-paying. Only seven non-heist missions gave a payout; &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20and%20Lamar\"&gt;Franklin and Lamar&lt;/a&gt; gave the player $250, &lt;a href=\"Nervous%20Ron\"&gt;Nervous Ron&lt;/a&gt; gave the player $62,000 and &lt;a href=\"Lester%27s%20Assassinations\"&gt;Lester's Assassinations&lt;/a&gt; gave the player varying amounts of between $3,000 and $10,000. The &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; version of \"GTA V\" was also criticized for the lack of an adequate anti-cheat with modders becoming prevalent in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" and being dealt with very little, in addition to &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt;' lack of efficiency in dealing with an ongoing modder problem and banning legitimate, non-cheating players instead.\nThe ongoing success and continued development of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", which resulted in the game being the first to span three generations of game consoles without a subsequent \"GTA\" title being released, has been a common complaint for those anticipating announcement of a possible \"Grand Theft Auto VI\", until the announcement of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI\"&gt;the game&lt;/a&gt; on February 4th 2022.\nCopyrighting and Lawsuits.\nAfter the game was released, actress claimed that Rockstar had used her likeness without permission for in-game celebrity &lt;a href=\"Lacey%20Jonas\"&gt;Lacey Jonas&lt;/a&gt;, which Rockstar denied. On 1 September 2016, Lohan's lawsuit was dismissed.\nIn October 2013 claimed Rockstar used two songs from without permission, the songs in question being \"C-Walk\" by Kurupt and \"Nothin' But the Cavi Hit\" by Tha Dogg Pound and Mack 10. However, Dillinger was not signed to Death Row at the time and had an ongoing feud with Kurupt. The lawsuit was eventually dropped and the songs stayed in the game.\nSeptember 2022 Leaks.\nOn September 17, 2022 a user known as 'teapotuberhacker' has illegally obtained access to Rockstar's Slack channel and their internal Perforce Helix Core server, and stole, respectively, developer footage of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto VI&lt;/a&gt;\" and an unknown amount of development assets, documents, and the source code of \"Grand Theft Auto V\"; the former of which have been published by the hacker on &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI%23September%202022%20leaks\"&gt;September 18, 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Although the hacker has published snippets of the \"Grand Theft Auto V\" source code on GTAForums, no files have been publicly leaked at that time. \nNovember 2022 leak.\nOn November 15, 2022, a user on GitHub known as 'gta-source' published a repository of 53 files from the source code leak, primarily related to the documentation of the game's &lt;a href=\"https%3A//gtamods.com/wiki/Native_function\"&gt;native script commands&lt;/a&gt;. The repository has been taken down a day later following a DMCA notice by &lt;a href=\"Take-Two%20Interactive\"&gt;Take-Two Interactive&lt;/a&gt;.\nNovember 2023 leak.\nOn November 19, 2023, an executable alongside its corresponding .pdb (program database) file was leaked in a Discord server. This file originated from the files stolen in September 2022 and has later been removed from the server after the files have began to be publicly reposted.\nDecember 2023 leaks.\nOn December 24, 2023, over 16GB of internal source code was leaked online. The archive contained leaked source code for the game itself as well as &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Advanced%20Game%20Engine\"&gt;RAGE&lt;/a&gt;, source script files, and hundreds of studio tools. The leak was considered to be one of the most substantial gaming leaks, alongside &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI%23September%202022%20leaks\"&gt;\"GTA VI\"s September 2022 leaked footage&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe next day, an archive containing 14GB of various art assets, documents, and developer tutorial videos was leaked. Like the source code leak, this has also been a part of the September 2022 breach.\nAs with the \"GTA VI\" leaks, Take-Two Interactive issued a takedown notice on any redistribution of the source code, including hyperlinks to third-party websites redistributing the leak and guides to compile a working copy of the game. &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt; did not acknowledge the leaks.\nOctober 2024 leak.\nAn early prototype of &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; downloadable content (DLC) packs was accidently left unsecured on Xbox Live Arcade's PartnerNET, an internal &lt;a href=\"Microsoft\"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; platform that allowed developers to access and test upcoming downloadable content and titles. This incident occurred on July 13, 2013, just prior to the release of . Although initially ruled as fake, the files reemerged on October 21st, 2024. The leak primarily featured &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Weapons%23Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;unused weapons&lt;/a&gt;, along with an initial version of the &lt;a href=\"Atomic%20Blimp\"&gt;Atomic Blimp&lt;/a&gt;. \nEach weapon was packaged separately, and with the exception of the Atomic Blimp DLC and &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Sniper\"&gt;Assault Sniper&lt;/a&gt; DLC, they employed an older coding structure akin to that of , necessitating manual adjustments for functionality. The other prototype DLC packs included:\nThe idea was later turned into &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Editions\"&gt;Special/Collector's Edition&lt;/a&gt; bonus."}

The first main \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series entry since \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", its development was led by &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;Rockstar North&lt;/a&gt;'s core 360-person team, who collaborated with several other international Rockstar studios. The team considered the game a spiritual successor to many of their previous projects like \"Red Dead Redemption\" and \"Max Payne 3\". After its unexpected announcement in &lt;a href=\"2011\"&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;, the game was fervently promoted with press showings, cinematic trailers, viral marketing strategies and special editions. Its release date, though subject to several delays, was widely anticipated.\nThe open world setting, modelled on Los Angeles and other areas of Southern California, constituted much of the development effort. Key team members conducted field trips around Southern California to gather research and footage, and Google Maps projections of Los Angeles were used to help design the city's road networks. The proprietary &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Advanced%20Game%20Engine\"&gt;Rockstar Advanced Game Engine&lt;/a&gt; (RAGE) was overhauled to increase its draw distance rendering capabilities. For the first time in the series, players control three &lt;a href=\"Protagonist\"&gt;protagonists&lt;/a&gt; throughout the single-player mode. The team found the multiple protagonist design a fundamental change to the story and gameplay devices. They refined the shooting and driving mechanics and tightened the narrative's pacing and scope.\nThe actors selected to portray the protagonists invested much time and research into character development. Motion capture was used to record the characters' facial and body movements. Like its predecessors, the game features an in-game radio that plays a selection of licensed music tracks. An &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V%20Official%20Score\"&gt;original score&lt;/a&gt; was composed over several years by a team of five music producers. They worked in close collaboration, sampling and incorporating different influences into each other's ideas. The game's re-release added a first-person view option along with the traditional third-person view. To accommodate first-person, the game received a major visual and technical upgrade, as well as new gameplay features like a &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Editor\"&gt;replay editor&lt;/a&gt; that lets players create gameplay videos.\nHistory and Overview.\nPreliminary work on \"Grand Theft Auto V\" began around \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;'\"s release in April &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;; full development lasted approximately three years. Rockstar North's core 360-person team co-opted studios around the world owned by parent company Rockstar Games to facilitate development between a full team of over 1,000. These included Rockstar's &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Leeds\"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Lincoln\"&gt;Lincoln&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20New%20England\"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20San%20Diego\"&gt;San Diego&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; studios. Technical director Adam Fowler said that while development was shared between studios in different countries, the process involved close collaboration between the core team and others. This was necessary to avoid difficulties if studios did not communicate with each other as many game mechanics work in tandem. Technical director &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Fowler\"&gt;Adam Fowler&lt;/a&gt; said that while development was shared between studios in different countries, the process involved close collaboration between the core team and others. This was necessary to avoid difficulties if studios did not communicate with each other as many game mechanics work in tandem. Game development ceased by 25 August &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, when it was submitted for manufacturing. Media analyst Arvind Bhatia estimated the game's development budget exceeded US$137 million, and The Scotsman reporter Marty McLaughlin estimated that the combined development and marketing efforts exceeded \u00a3170 million (US$265 million), making it the most expensive video game ever made at its time.\nResearch and Open World Design.\nInitial work on \"Grand Theft Auto V\" constituted the open world creation, where preliminary models were constructed in-engine during pre-production. The game's setting is the fictional US state of &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; and city of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, based on Southern California and Los Angeles respectively. San Andreas was first used as \"'\" setting, which featured three cities separated by open countryside. The team thought that the ambition of including three cities in San Andreas was too high, as it did not emulate the cities as well as they had hoped. &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Houser\"&gt;Dan Houser&lt;/a&gt; felt that an effective portrayal of Los Angeles needs to emulate its urban sprawl, and that dividing the workforce between multiple cities would have detracted from capturing \"what L.A. is\". Art director &lt;a href=\"Aaron%20Garbut\"&gt;Aaron Garbut&lt;/a&gt; said that &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; era technology lacked the technical capabilities to capture Los Angeles adequately, such that San Andreas' rendition of Los Santos looked like a \"backdrop or a game level with pedestrians randomly milling about\". The team disregarded San Andreas as a departure point for \"Grand Theft Auto V\" because they had moved on to a new generation of consoles and wanted to build the city from scratch. According to Garbut, game hardware had \"evolved so much from San Andreas\" that using it as a model would have been redundant. The team's focus on one city instead of three meant that they could produce Los Santos in higher quality and at a grander scale than in the previous game.\nLos Angeles was extensively researched for the game. The team organised field research trips with tour guides and architectural historians, and captured around 250,000 photographs and many hours of video footage. Houser said, \"We spoke to FBI agents that have been undercover, experts in the Mafia, street gangsters who know the slang\u2014we even went to see a proper prison\". He considered the open world's research and creation the most challenging aspects of the game's production. Google Maps and Street View projections of Los Angeles were used by the team to help design Los Santos' road networks. The team studied virtual globe models, census data and documentaries to reproduce the city's geographical and demographic spread. The team opted to condense the city's spread into an area that players could comfortably traverse to capture \"the essence of what's really there in a city, but in a far smaller area\", according to Houser. \"The New Yorker'\"s Sam Sweet opined that the \"exhaustive field work... wasn't conducted to document a living space. Rather, it was collected to create an extremely realistic version of a Los Angeles that doesn't actually exist\". Garbut noted that Los Angeles was used merely as a starting point and that the team were not \"dictated by reality\" while building Los Santos.\nThe open world includes vast tracts of countryside around the city proper. Research took the team to California's rural regions; Garbut recalled a visit he took with Houser to Bombay Beach that inspired them to set Trevor's initial story against the Salton Sea. The team wanted a large world without open, empty areas and condensed Southern California's countryside into a detailed play space. The game world covers 49 square miles (130 km2)\u2014about an eightieth of Los Angeles County. Its scale is greater than Rockstar's previous open world games; Garbut estimated it is large enough to fit \"GTA San Andreas\", \"GTA IV\" and \"Red Dead Redemption'\"s worlds combined inside. To accommodate the world's size, the team overhauled the RAGE to improve its draw distance rendering capabilities. The large, open space permitted the re-introduction of fixed-wing aircraft, omitted from \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" because of its relatively smaller scale. \"We wanted somewhere big [to let players] fly properly\", Houser explained. Lead producer &lt;a href=\"Leslie%20Benzies\"&gt;Leslie Benzies&lt;/a&gt; noted that to avoid a \"hollow\" countryside area, the team populated the open world with wildlife.\nStory and Character Development.\nA single-player story revolving around three lead protagonists was one of \"Grand Theft Auto V'\"s earliest design objectives. Garbut felt that such a deviation from the gameplay's core structure was a risk, and recalled team concern that a departure from \"Grand Theft Auto'\"s traditional, single lead character set-up \"might backfire\". Early game conceptualisations would have told three separate stories through different protagonists. Later, \"Grand Theft Auto IV'\"s stories inspired the concept that story trajectories would meet throughout the game. Eventually, the concept evolved into three interconnected stories that intertwined through the missions. According to Benzies, the team made the multiple character formula \"integral to the structure of the gameplay as well as the narrative\". Houser opined that Grand Theft Auto V is their \"strongest plotted game because the characters are so intertwined\" and that the \"meeting points [between the characters' stories] are very exciting\".\nThe central story theme is the \"pursuit of the almighty dollar\". Missions follow the lead characters' efforts to plan and execute complicated heists to accrue wealth for themselves. The team focused on money as the central theme in response to the 2007\u201308 financial crisis, as its effects turn the main characters back to a life of crime. \"We wanted this post-crash feeling, because it works thematically in this game about bank robbers\", Houser explained. The positive reaction to \"Grand Theft Auto IV'\"s \"&lt;a href=\"Three%20Leaf%20Clover\"&gt;Three Leaf Clover&lt;/a&gt;\" mission\u2014an elaborate heist executed by lead protagonist &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; and accomplices\u2014encouraged the team to develop the story around the heists. Houser said that while \"Three Leaf Clover\" was well-received, the team had not captured the thrill of the robbery to their best abilities and wanted \"Grand Theft Auto V\" to achieve it. He felt that a strong bank robbery mission \"was a good device that we'd never used in the past. Repeating ourselves is a fear when we're doing games where part of the evolution is just technological\".\nThe game has players control three characters: &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;. The team wrote each character to embody a game protagonist archetype; Michael represents greed, Franklin ambition and Trevor insanity. Houser felt Michael and Trevor were written to juxtapose each other, with Michael \"like the criminal who wants to compartmentalise and be a good guy some of the time\" and Trevor \"the maniac who isn't a hypocrite\". He considered that the three lead characters helped move the game's story into more original territory than its predecessors, which traditionally followed a single protagonist rising through the ranks of a criminal underworld. &lt;a href=\"Ned%20Luke\"&gt;Ned Luke&lt;/a&gt; portrayed Michael, &lt;a href=\"Shawn%20Fonteno\"&gt;Shawn \"Solo\" Fonteno&lt;/a&gt; portrayed Franklin, and &lt;a href=\"Steven%20Ogg\"&gt;Steven Ogg&lt;/a&gt; portrayed Trevor. Fonteno first became aware of the acting job through his friend &lt;a href=\"DJ%20Pooh\"&gt;DJ Pooh&lt;/a&gt;, who worked on \"GTA San Andreas\" and was involved in \"Grand Theft Auto V'\"s music production.\nWhen Luke's agent advised him of the casting call, he initially did not want to audition for the part because it was in a video game. After reading the audition material and learning more about the project, he became interested. He reflected, \"I went immediately after reading the material from 'I'm not doing it' to 'nobody else is doing it'. It was just brilliant\". During the initial audition process, Ogg noticed on-set chemistry between him and Luke, which he felt helped secure them the roles. \"When [Luke] and I went in the room together we immediately had something\", he explained. While the actors knew their auditions were for Rockstar Games, it was not until they signed contracts that they learnt it was a \"Grand Theft Auto\" title.\nWork for the actors began in 2010. Their performances were mostly recorded using motion capture technology. Dialogue for scenes with characters seated in vehicles was recorded in studios. Because the actors had their dialogue and movements recorded on-set, they found their performances no different to film or television roles. Their dialogue was scripted such that they could not ad-lib; however, with directorial approval they sometimes made small changes to their performances. To prepare for his role as Michael, Luke gained 25 pounds and studied Rockstar's previous games, starting with \"Grand Theft Auto IV\". He considered Michael's characterisation to be an amalgamation of Hugh Beaumont's portrayal of Ward Cleaver in the American sitcom \"Leave It to Beaver\" (1957\u201363) and Al Pacino's portrayal of Tony Montana in the 1983 film \"Scarface\".\nOgg felt Trevor's characterisation developed over time. He said, \"Nuances and character traits that began to appear\u2014his walk, his manner of speech, his reactions, definitely informed his development throughout the game\". Ogg cites Tom Hardy's portrayal of English criminal Charles Bronson in the 2008 biopic \"Bronson\" as a strong stylistic influence. He opined that while Trevor embodies the violent, psychopathic \"Grand Theft Auto\" anti-hero archetype, he wanted to evoke player sympathy to Trevor's story. \"To elicit other emotions was tough, and it was the biggest challenge and it's something that meant a lot to me\", Ogg explained. Fonteno felt that growing up in South Los Angeles and being exposed to drug trafficking and gang culture authenticated his portrayal of Franklin. \"I lived his life before... He's been surrounded by drugs, the crime, living with his aunt\u2014I lived with my grandmother\u2014so there was a lot of familiarity\", Fonteno said. Having not worked as an actor since portraying Face in the 2001 film \"The Wash\", he sought counsel from Luke and Ogg to refine his acting skills.\nGameplay Design.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V'\"s multiple protagonist design was envisioned to improve the series' core mechanics. The team sought to innovate game storytelling and negate stale familiarity by not evolving the gameplay's core structure. \"We didn't want to do the same thing over again\", said Houser. The multiple protagonist idea was first raised during \"GTA San Andreas'\" development but contemporaneous hardware restrictions made it infeasible. Garbut explained, \"It didn't work from a tech point of view because the three characters need three times as much memory, three types of animation and so on\". After \"Grand Theft Auto IV'\"s release, the team developed \"The Lost and Damned\" and \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", episodic content packages that followed new protagonists. The three interwoven stories received positive remarks, so the team structured \"Grand Theft Auto V\" around this model.\nThe development team found that players experienced greater freedom when controlling three characters in missions. Lead mission designer &lt;a href=\"Imran%20Sarwar\"&gt;Imran Sarwar&lt;/a&gt; felt they opened up more strategic manoeuvres. He cited a combat scenario where Michael sets up at a sniper outpost to cover Trevor, who makes a frontal assault on the enemy position while Franklin manipulates flank points. Benzies felt that character switching streamlines the interplay between free roam and linear mission gameplay, as it eliminates \"GTA San Andreas'\" cumbersome long-distance drives to mission start points. Players may \"explore the whole map without having to worry about the long drive back\", according to Benzies. Houser noted the mechanic's use during missions negated long drives as well. The team implemented dynamic mission content throughout the open world, a feature borrowed from \"Red Dead Redemption\". Dynamic missions present themselves while players explore the open world and may be accepted or ignored. In Los Santos, for example, players may encounter an &lt;a href=\"Armored%20Trucks\"&gt;armored truck&lt;/a&gt; and try to intercept it to steal its contents.\nThe team overhauled the game's shooting and driving mechanics to match the standards of its contemporaries. Public reception to the team's previous games (such as \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", \"Red Dead Redemption\" and \"Max Payne 3\") was considered during the process. To increase the pace of shootouts, the team removed hard locking\u2014a central mechanic in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" that instantly locks onto the enemy nearest to the crosshair. Associate technical director Phil Hooker found hard locking \"too disorientating\" and immersion-breaking, \"as you didn't have to think about enemy locations\" He said that \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" players \"just rely on holding and shooting until a target is dead\", so \"Grand Theft Auto V\" introduces a timer that breaks the lock on a target after a few seconds. The team refined \"Red Dead Redemption'\"s cover system for the game, with increased fluidity moving into and out of cover. Regarding the reworked vehicle mechanics, Houser felt the game took influence from racing games and corrected \"Grand Theft Auto IV'\"s \"boat-like\" driving controls.\nMusic Production.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" is the first game in its series to use an original score. Music supervisor &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Pavlovich\"&gt;Ivan Pavlovich&lt;/a&gt; summarised the original score idea as \"daunting\", because it was unprecedented for a \"Grand Theft Auto\" game. Like most previous series entries, the game uses licensed music tracks provided by an in-game radio as well. Pavlovich hoped that the original score would enhance the licensed music use, not detract from it. He further noted the balancing act between the score's \"ambient subtext and tensions\" and the game's on-screen action. To work on the score, Rockstar engaged &lt;a href=\"The%20Alchemist\"&gt;The Alchemist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oh%20No\"&gt;Oh No&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tangerine%20Dream\"&gt;Tangerine Dream&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Woody%20Jackson\"&gt;Woody Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, who had previously worked on \"Red Dead Redemption\", \"L.A. Noire\" and \"Max Payne 3'\"s music. The team of producers collaborated over several years to create more than twenty hours of music that scores both the game's missions and dynamic gameplay throughout the single-player and multiplayer modes.\nEarly in the game's development, the music team were shown an early build before starting work on the score. Their work was mostly completed later in development, but they continued composing until its final build was submitted for manufacturing. Edgar Froese, Tangerine Dream's founding member, initially rejected the offer of producing music for a video game. After he was flown to the studio and shown the game, he was impressed by its scale and cinematic nature, and changed his mind. Froese's first eight months of work on the score produced 62 hours of music. He recorded with Tangerine Dream in &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;, but further work was conducted at Jackson's &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; studio, which The Alchemist and Oh No used as well.\nJackson's initial role was to provide the score for Trevor's missions, and he took influence from artists such as The Mars Volta and Queens of the Stone Age. When he learnt that the team would be building off each other's work, he voiced concern that the finished product could be disjointed. After sharing his work with the team, however, he was particularly impressed by Froese's contributions. \"Edgar evolved the music, made it into a whole other thing\", Jackson said. Froese had interpolated funk sounds with Jackson's hip-hop influences. Froese and Jackson then sent their work between The Alchemist and Oh No, who heavily sampled it. The Alchemist opined, \"We were sampling, taking a piece form [sic] here, a piece from there... We pitched stuff up, chopped it, tweaked it. Then we chose the tracks that worked and everyone came in and layered on that\". DJ Shadow then mixed the team's creations and matched it to the gameplay. Pavlovich considered \"how to make the hip-hop and rock score not sound like they were instrumentals of songs on the radio, but rather something unique to the score\" a challenge.\nPavlovich found that while Rockstar assigned the team missions to write music for, some of their random creations influenced other missions and sparked inspiration for further score development. He discussed a \"stem-based\" system used to make music fit dynamic game factors where the team would compose music to underscore outcomes players could make immediately after completing missions. Each of these stems, Froese reflected, included up to 62 five-minute WAV files, which were sent to Pavlovich in New York. \"He then created, very professionally, a mix down for each of the eight stems needed for a mission and sent out the material to the other artists involved\", Froese elaborated. Oh No drew from scenes within the game to make his work feel contextually pertinent with the action on-screen. The iconographic introduction of Los Santos early in the game, for example, inspired him to \"create a smooth West Coast vibe that embodied\" the city. He supplied horns, electric and bass guitars, and percussion parts to fit with the car chase scenes. \"We wanted everything to set the right tone\", he explained.\nThe Rockstar team wanted to synergise the game world's depiction of California with the radio stations by licensing tracks that imparted an appropriate \"Cali feel\". Pavlovich noted that Los Angeles' cultural saturation of pop music necessitated the &lt;a href=\"Non-Stop-Pop%20FM\"&gt;Non-Stop-Pop FM&lt;/a&gt; station; he said that \"the first time you get off an airplane in L.A. and you hear the radio and the pop just seeps out... We wanted that. It really connects you to the world\". He felt that greater discernment was required for licensed music choices than in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" because \"Grand Theft Auto V'\"s music plays a pivotal role in generating Californian atmosphere. Music \"reflects the environment in which the game is set\", he said. Initially, the team planned to license over 900 tracks for the radio, but they refined the number to 241. The tracks are shared between fifteen stations, with an additional two talk-back stations and a radio station for custom audio files on the PC version. Some tracks were written specifically for the game, such as rapper and producer &lt;a href=\"Flying%20Lotus\"&gt;Flying Lotus&lt;/a&gt;' original work composed for the &lt;a href=\"FlyLo%20FM\"&gt;FlyLo FM&lt;/a&gt; station he hosts. Pavlovich noted how the team would first develop an idea of what each station would sound like, and then select a DJ to match the station's genre, such as &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Loggins\"&gt;Kenny Loggins&lt;/a&gt; who hosts the classic rock station &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Rock%20Radio\"&gt;Los Santos Rock Radio&lt;/a&gt;. He felt that to strike a balance between the radio and the score was a meticulous process, and cited a scenario where players would drive to a mission objective while listening to the radio, with the score taking over once players left the vehicle and proceeded to the mission's next stage."}

He made his income from loan sharking and racketeering in &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;, initially targeting weak Russians to intimidate. He was the owner of &lt;a href=\"Comrades%20Bar\"&gt;Comrades Bar&lt;/a&gt;, where he often carried out orders to those he employed. Vlad was also a frequent cocaine user, which was usually supplied to him by his boss, &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Faustin\"&gt;Mikhail Faustin&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nVladimir Glebov was born in &lt;a href=\"1967\"&gt;1967&lt;/a&gt; in Russia. His early life during his childhood and adolescence is unknown, although it is stated that he has a sister. During the late-1980s, Vlad affiliated himself with two Russian mobsters: &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Faustin\"&gt;Mikhail Faustin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly served in Faustin's organization as an enforcer for a while.\nLiberty City.\nIn the late-1990s, the Faustin Bratva relocated to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt;, settling into the &lt;a href=\"Hove%20Beach\"&gt;Hove Beach&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. Vlad purchased and began operating in Comrades Bar, where he regularly held meetings with his associates. During his time in Liberty City, Vlad had become a high-ranked member of the organization, working as the Mafia's debt collector.\nHe was arrested in &lt;a href=\"2002\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt; for public nudity, again in &lt;a href=\"2003\"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt; for sexual assault, and once more in &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt; for extortion.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2005\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;, Vlad met a man named &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman Bellic&lt;/a&gt; who was in a large amount of debt from gambling. Roman borrowed money from Vlad, but was unable to pay him back for a while. Roman's girlfriend, Mallorie Bardas began having sex with Vlad to prevent Roman from being hurt for not being able to pay his debts.\nVlad and his crew protected Roman from &lt;a href=\"Dardan%20Petrela\"&gt;Dardan Petrela&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bledar%20Morina\"&gt;Bledar Morina&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Mob\"&gt;Albanian&lt;/a&gt; loan sharks that he was also indebted to.\nAt an unknown point in time, Vlad began using cocaine, eventually becoming addicted to it.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nSometime in &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, Roman's cousin &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko&lt;/a&gt; moved to Liberty City; Vlad took an interest in Niko's ability to fight and forced him into paying off Roman's debts by participating in illicit activities.\nVlad sent Niko to collect protection money from a Chinese shopkeeper, and later from a man named &lt;a href=\"Muscovski\"&gt;Muscovski&lt;/a&gt;, who owned a laundrette. Shortly after that, Niko stole a &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Compact\"&gt;Blista Compact&lt;/a&gt; from a client called &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Jimmy&lt;/a&gt;, who refused to pay off his debt to Mikhail.\n&lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Bytchkov\"&gt;Ivan Bytchkov&lt;/a&gt; somehow angered Mikhail, and Vlad was ordered to take care of the situation. Niko was sent to kill Ivan, whom he can choose to spare. The latter option causes Ivan to appear in a random encounter in &lt;a href=\"Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt; later on. Niko calls Vlad after the mission and claims to have killed Ivan, where Vlad suggests that he's had sex with Mallorie - this frustrates Niko, and he threatens to \"break\" Vlad if he said it to his face.\nDeath.\nVlad is confronted by Niko at Comrades Bar after it is confirmed that he had been having an affair with Mallorie for the past three years. Following a brief, high-speed car chase across the neighborhood, Niko corners Vlad underneath the &lt;a href=\"Algonquin%20Bridge\"&gt;Algonquin Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. Vlad curses Niko for throwing his life away over Mallorie and threatens him that his boss Mikhail Faustin will most certainly track him and Roman down. Niko ignores the threat and &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Vlad\"&gt;shoots&lt;/a&gt; Vlad in the face, killing him instantly.\nA shocked Roman argues with Niko over Vlad's killing and that they are going to be marked for death; Niko in turn talks about his experience in the war. Afterwards, Roman leaves and Niko dumps Vlad's corpse in the &lt;a href=\"Humboldt%20River\"&gt;Humboldt River&lt;/a&gt;. Although Vlad's corpse isn't recovered, the news over his death quickly spread and true to his final words, Niko and Roman are kidnapped by Faustin.\nQuite ironically, however, Mikhail decides to employ Niko and admits that he thought Vlad was an idiot, and claims that the only reason he kept Vlad employed was because he was having an affair with Vlad's sister.\nBefore Faustin and his men are &lt;a href=\"The%20Master%20and%20the%20Molotov\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; by Niko later on at the &lt;a href=\"Perestroika\"&gt;Perestroika&lt;/a&gt; Club as part of a deal between &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Petrovic\"&gt;Kenny Petrovic&lt;/a&gt; for ordering &lt;a href=\"Lenny%20Petrovic\"&gt;Lenny Petrovic&lt;/a&gt;'s death, he tells Niko that Dimitri is a treacherous rat and that he saved Niko's life because it was Dimitri, who insisted that Niko be killed for murdering Vlad in the first place.\nThe final mention of Vlad is after the events of &lt;a href=\"Weekend%20at%20Florian%27s\"&gt;Weekend at Florian's&lt;/a&gt;. Mallorie calls Niko, saying that Roman confessed to her that he killed Vlad himself, and thanks Niko for helping him get rid of Vlad's body. Niko replies saying that the story is true and that Roman is \"an old school romantic\".\nVlad's body appears to have never been found, as the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; database lists him as \"missing\". This is further backed up by Ivan if he is spared.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nVlad is a bully with a short temper who shows little respect for anyone he comes across while also demanding an unreasonable amount of respect in return. As a debt collector, he instinctively threatens those who have not repaid him with violence, although he has enough self-control to not kill his debtors. He is also rather narcissistic, as he refers to both Niko and Roman as \"serfs\" and \"yokels\" while also referring to himself as good-looking, despite being similarly overweight to Roman and clearly unattractive. \nNonetheless, he has a certain degree of charm which he uses to impress and seduce &lt;a href=\"Mallorie%20Bardas\"&gt;Mallorie Bardas&lt;/a&gt;, although this may have been due to her wanting to protect Roman from further physical harm as opposed to any liking for Vlad. Above all, Vlad is very arrogant and has an inflated sense of self-worth, as Faustin does not avenge his death, saying he only kept Vlad around so he could have sex with Vlad's sister."}

Unique in the series, the station in \"GTA IV\" plays contemporary Eastern European pop music, with a focus on Russian, Ukrainian and Belarussian artists. Originally, this consisted of music ranging from the late '80s to the present, with styles ranging from alternative rock, emo, post-punk, pop rock, dance, chanson, trance, and hip-hop. With the playlist's renewal in 2018, the styles have been narrowed down to pop/rock and hip-hop, with several tracks being anachronistic to the game's &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; setting. \nVladivostok FM is hosted by &lt;a href=\"Ruslana%20Lyzhychko\"&gt;Ruslana Lyzhychko&lt;/a&gt;, who presents as an energetic, eclectic, and upbeat personality.

Radio idents for the station may also draw such comparisons, and occasionally give cryptic statements, such as \"One day, we will run this country\". As the station is aimed towards &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City's&lt;/a&gt; Russian population, some idents are spoken in Russian, while Ruslana will sometimes mutter to herself in Ukrainian.

The new playlist can be heard inside &lt;a href=\"Bahama%20Mamas\"&gt;Bahama Mamas&lt;/a&gt; nightclub, but at the beginning of the radio track, the first advert announces that the radio is \"direct from Hove Beach\", its original broadcast location. It is hosted by &lt;a href=\"DJ%20Paul\"&gt;DJ Paul&lt;/a&gt;, who has a tendency to use the phrase \"Let's 'ave it\" repetitively. In contrast to its \"GTA IV\" depiction, it features no commercials.\nWhen \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" is updated by the downloadable version of \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", the station alternates between a program of World Beat/Eastern European pop music and one of western European dance music. Vladivostok FM is based on in New York City. In 2007, WNYZ-LP transitioned from a Russian Top 40 program to a dance music station named Pulse 87, similar to how Vladivostok changed from playing purely Russian music to house music.\nIt is one of the preferred stations of &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Karen%20Daniels\"&gt;Michelle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oleg%20Minkov\"&gt;Oleg Minkov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Glebov\"&gt;Vladimir Glebov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Faustin\"&gt;Mikhail Faustin&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Faustin%20Mafiya\"&gt;Faustin/Rascalov Mafiya&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Petrovic%20Mafiya\"&gt;Petrovic Mafiya&lt;/a&gt;.\nTracklist.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nFollowing \"GTA IV\"s &lt;a href=\"%2310th%20Anniversary\"&gt;10th anniversary&lt;/a&gt;, due to many expired licenses on songs appearing on the station, replacement tracks were added. \nDeleted Songs.\nAccording to the soundtrack disc of the station and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DUwk_Hl902-I\"&gt;an interview with Ruslana&lt;/a&gt;, the following songs were meant to appear, but were cut for reasons unknown:\nThe following two songs were requested and approved to be in \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", however for whatever reason it didn't make the cut:\n10th Anniversary.\nRockstar confirmed through the Kotaku website that some songs were going to be removed from Grand Theft Auto IV due to licensing restrictions, in particular a large portion of Vladivostok FM. However, they would be replacing some of the songs with a new set of songs. The removal of them occured on April 26, 2018. However, physical copies of the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; versions are unaffected and have not been patched.\nGallery.\nPosters can be seen exclusively in \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\"."}

The first game in the series to do so was \"GTA III\", which, despite a limited budget and the \"GTA\" series' low profile at the time, featured several notable actors from film and television. These included &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Vincent\"&gt;Frank Vincent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Madsen\"&gt;Michael Madsen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kyle%20MacLachlan\"&gt;Kyle MacLachlan&lt;/a&gt;, who all had prominent roles. At the time, it was rare for a video game to use such high-profile actors, and \"GTA III\" is considered a pioneer in doing so. The next game, \"GTA Vice City\", featured more movie actors, including &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Liotta\"&gt;Ray Liotta&lt;/a&gt; as the player character. Although the following title, \"GTA San Andreas\", also featured many notable movie actors - such as &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20L.%20Jackson\"&gt;Samuel L. Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Fonda\"&gt;Peter Fonda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"James%20Woods\"&gt;James Woods&lt;/a&gt; - it had been decided that the use of such actors should be reduced, particularly for leading roles. As a result, many of the prominent roles in \"GTA San Andreas\" were voiced by lower profile actors or rappers.\nFrom \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" through to \"GTA V\", the series has continued using lesser-known actors to voice main characters, but still uses celebrities and real-life radio personalities to voice the DJs of the many radio stations featured in each game. Some games also feature celebrities portraying themselves, such as &lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones\"&gt;Lazlow Jones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Collins\"&gt;Phil Collins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ricky%20Gervais\"&gt;Ricky Gervais&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Katt%20Williams\"&gt;Katt Williams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frankie%20Boyle\"&gt;Frankie Boyle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jesco%20White\"&gt;Jesco White&lt;/a&gt;.\nVoice Actors.\nKey"}

On the main section, the large has the main engines beside the fuselage, the inner elevators, the outer ailerons and the airbrakes located ahead of the ailerons, while the mounts a large vertical stabiliser. The underside houses the main undercarriage with a similar setup to the Titan and the Bombushka \u2013 a single-wheel nose gear and dual-wheeled main gear on the wings.\nThe interior of the aircraft is largely identical to the Bombushka, being primarily the cabin and the control room, albeit with several alterations: the cabin has a mostly carbon-plated flight deck with fewer worn green sections and a metal sheet covering the centre of the cabin (where the walkway on the Bombushka can be seen), while the control room lacks the posters and the star emblems on the computer stations.\nThe primary colour of the vehicle is applied to the fuselage, wings and turrets, while the secondary one is applied to the door latch, wing tips and inner portions of the intakes and the exhausts. It uses a set of plain industrial wheels also used on the Titan and the Bombushka.\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;armed&lt;/a&gt; with two remote turrets located below the nose and on top of the fuselage, which appear to use the same gun model from the &lt;a href=\"Technical\"&gt;Technical&lt;/a&gt; and its variants (therefore being ). The aircraft can also be equipped with bombs.\nPerformance.\nVehicle.\nThe Volatol performs similar, if not identical, to the &lt;a href=\"RM-10%20Bombushka\"&gt;RM-10 Bombushka&lt;/a&gt;, as well as other larger jet-powered planes. Although it has a high top speed, it is still one of the slowest aircraft in the game, with sluggish handling and low acceleration.\nThe aircraft is powered by four engines, which are located on the wings and produce the same sound from aircraft such as the &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;Shamal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Luxor\"&gt;Luxor&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefense.\nThe Volatol is a highly vulnerable vehicle, as the large profile, low maneuverability and lack of armor gives little to no protection against other weaponized aircraft, as well as any weaponized ground vehicle. Explosive rounds are also major threats to the aircraft, as the plane would not have enough speed and maneuverability to counter-attack. The Volatol has no missile proximity or lock on alarm, which makes evading and using counter measures difficult. It is unknown if this is intentional or not. Given its size, this makes the Volatol very vulnerable to all forms of missile attacks.\nCountermeasures.\nThe vehicle can be fitted with countermeasures to improve its defensive capabilities againsts homing missiles, each one with their own attributes:\nWeaponry.\nThe Volatol is equipped with two remote turrets that can only be operated by independent gunners: a nose turret that has a rotation angle of 360 degrees and an elevation angle of between 5 and -60 degrees, and a top turret that has a rotation angle of 360 degrees and an elevation angle of between -5 and 45 degrees. When used, the player is set in a camera view similar to the turrets of the &lt;a href=\"RM-10%20Bombushka\"&gt;RM-10 Bombushka&lt;/a&gt; and the nose-mounted guns of the &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;FH-1 Hunter&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike most aircraft, which have a capacity of 50 bombs, the Volatol carries 100 bombs, twice the amount of most bomber aircraft.\nOverview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMachine Gun=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\nWhen purchased, the Volatol comes painted in the following colors by default:"}
{"id": "163994", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=163994", "title": "Volatus", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Buckingham\"&gt;Buckingham&lt;/a&gt; Volatus is a luxury helicopter featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the update.\nInfluence.\nThe helicopter appears to take influence primarily from the and the . The H160's influence can be seen heavily in the rotor assembly and blades, tail, side profiling and windscreen.\nDesign.\nThe Volatus takes a similar shape and layout to the &lt;a href=\"Swift\"&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt;, sporting a triangular nose and a relatively tall cockpit with the corresponding doors, side steps and the nose landing undercarriage. The main section is large and features sliding doors with access steps and the main landing undercarriage, along with a tall engine compartment with black slatted intakes, rear exhausts, a large rotor hub and five long blades with angled tips. The tail assembly/empennage features a Fenestron tail similar to the &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt;, with dual fins on either side of the tail, a small lower vertical stabilizer and a tall upper vertical stabilizer. Various markings can be seen around the fuselage, displaying the manufacturer name.\nThe cockpit of the aircraft features a small instrument panel with the same \"Flyer\" dials from many basic aircraft, such as the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;Maverick&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;. Its layout is also identical to that of the Maverick and the &lt;a href=\"SuperVolito\"&gt;SuperVolito&lt;/a&gt;, but adds the green \"Gear Up/Down\" displays on the lower right corner of the panel. Similar to the &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Deluxe\"&gt;Swift Deluxe&lt;/a&gt;, the interior is fitted with luxury equipment, such as a TV screen, surround sound, leather seating and a coffee machine. Passengers can drink champagne and browse the &lt;a href=\"Internet%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt; within the helicopter, instead of using the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;Mobile Phone&lt;/a&gt;. Similar to the Deluxe vehicles, the player can also hold down \"Enter Vehicle\" button to enter the rear compartment.\nThe aircraft features a variety of colour combinations, where the primary one is applied on the nose, part of the sides, engine compartment, outline of the tail boom, the upper portions of the vertical fins and the stitches of the seats, while the secondary one is applied on the portions around the windows, rotor hub and sections of the underside. The portions on the underside, the lower sides of the fuselage and most of the tail boom, stabilizers and fins are determined by the \"pearlescent\" colour, which can be painted through the corresponding option from the primary colour (only if the player chooses a metallic/crew colour). It uses a set of wheels derived from industrial trucks like the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;, also used on many aircraft.\nPerformance.\nThe Volatus has decent performance for a helicopter. Statistically, it has the same top speed as the &lt;a href=\"Swift\"&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt; and a slightly better maneuverability, but its rather large size makes it not suitable for landing in tight spaces. The helicopter\u2019s narrow landing undercarriage makes it prone to lean on the ground, especially in steep inclines. This also causes an erratic behaviour when flipped to a side, often unable to recover and resulting in it being severely damaged or destroyed in the process.\nSince it is designed for luxurious, speedy traveling like the Swift, it is not very durable: ten seconds of continuous &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt; fire will cause the engine to stall, destroying the vehicle. Therefore, one should consider only using it to travel from place to place in quick succession in non-combat situations. The rather large windows also expose the occupants to gunfire, which is a risk for the pilot.\nThe helicopter is powered by twin turboshaft engines, evidenced by the dual intakes and exhausts on the upper compartment. It uses the same traditional sound from most basic helicopters, albeit with a slightly faster pace due to the 5-bladed rotor.\nModifications.\nUpon being converted into a personal aircraft, the Volatus can be repainted with a primary and a secondary colour. It is possible to change the tertiary colour via the pearlescent color given with the primary \"metallic\" colour. The markings cannot be removed, however."}
{"id": "76123", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=76123", "title": "Voltic", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Coil\"&gt;Coil&lt;/a&gt; Voltic is an all-electric sports car in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nInfluence.\nThe Voltic is meant to represent the ; the majority of the influence, however, is taken from both the and the , as seen in the shared front bumper, headlights, and bonnet. The roofline of the Voltic, being a Roadster, is taken from the Elise, while the rear fascia and side profile are from the Exige. The side vent, although similar to the Exige's, has a similar shape to the . The side mirror placement and shape are also similar to those of the R8. The rear diffuser is taken from the .\nDesign.\nThe Voltic is depicted as a lightweight, compact roadster with a relatively short wheelbase, where it has a low front end with a fairly tall front face, featuring three bumper grilles; the central grille spanning two-thirds of the bumper width and then a smaller one on either side. The headlights are totally ovular and finished in black, housing two circular lamps and a small turn signal on the upper side. The hood/bonnet features two large, curved-edge intakes placed in the middle, while the manufacturer emblem is located right in front of it.\nThe sides of the car are very curvy, where the main body line curves downwards between the two arches, but curves upwards for either arch, more so for the rear arch. The main lines that form the edge of the side intakes for the car are also curved, while the intake just in front of the rear wheel arch features a CFRP insert. The greenhouse shrinks in width towards the rear of the car, using black framings for the windows and two mirror shells on either door. Just behind the cabin, there is a flat section with two black vents.\nThe rear end of this car features rear lighting made up of two circular lamps on either side of a central section, while silver lettering displaying the manufacturer name is seen between the lights. The lower area of the rear bumper has a plastic insert with a small exit vent, along with the corresponding license plate above.\nThe interior of the car in the enhanced version reuses the same components as the \"Super GT\" interior found on cars like the &lt;a href=\"9F\"&gt;9F&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"F620\"&gt;F620&lt;/a&gt;. However, being an all-electric vehicle, it replaces the standard tachometer with a dial displaying \"KW\" (kilowatts) and a different scaling.\nThe Voltic may spawn with an open top, a solid roof or a carbon-fiber one. It can be painted with a primary color for the body and the interior stitching, as well as a secondary color for the hood. The wheels featured on this car are a derivative of the \"FiftyNine\" sport wheels available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, but the spokes are curved towards the outer side and slightly larger.\nCurrent Design Gallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nStandard=\nTopless=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nPerformance.\nRelative to other cars in its class, the Voltic performs poorly, barring its incredibly quick and responsive acceleration. Since it is an electric vehicle, the Voltic has a specially-tuned single-speed transmission that directly drives the rear wheels. This results in the vehicle having a very quick throttle response and can also go just as fast in reverse as it can forwards. Its powerful electric motor provides sufficient torque for the vehicle to climb steep hills with ease, and acceleration in this vehicle is easily one of the best in the game, tied with the &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20GT\"&gt;Rapid GT&lt;/a&gt; sports car and beaten only by the &lt;a href=\"Cyclone\"&gt;Cyclone&lt;/a&gt; in terms of normal vehicles.\nHowever, what holds the Voltic back is its dismal top speed. Fully upgraded, it tops out at 106 mph, slower than every other supercar, and most sports cars. Handling is sharp and responsive, thanks to its very light design and low profile, but its short wheelbase often leads to loss of control, especially at high speeds. Also, its light weight and short wheelbase makes it very easy to get pushed off the road by other heavier cars.\nThe vehicle's durability is mediocre, as its body panels are very easily deformable and detachable from collisions. The wheels also have a tendency to camber and lock-up easily. As an electric-powered vehicle, it will not explode if it catches fire, though the battery will be destroyed and render the vehicle unusable. It can still be destroyed by gunfire, heavy damage, or explosions.\nDue to it being an electric-powered vehicle, there is very little to no noise coming from the engine, even at high speeds or revving the motor with the handbrake on. In fact, it only makes an audible whine if the vehicle is moving, and is clearly heard when driven with the radio turned off and/or in a quieter area.\nSpecial Variants.\nVinewood Modded.\nPre-modified variants of the Voltic can be seen driving around &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; randomly. It mainly appears in a green body color with a yellow pearlescent color and pink-colored rims. It also features pre-installed modifications and sport suspension.\nLos Santos Customs Modded.\nLike the randomly spawning modified Voltics, two sets of Voltics may spawn outside &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, pre-modified with the same features as the previous variant. They spawn in both \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", only with a slight change in the spawn point (the one in single-player is located close to the LSC garage entrance).\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe Voltic is part of the codice_1 \"codice_2\". This allows heavily modified Voltics, among many other modified cars to spawn outside Los Santos Customs, as well at other locations. They only spawn in \"GTA V\".\nOversights.\nIf the player shoots the driver of a Voltic, then shoots one of the rear tyres and enters the vehicle without holding a gun, the Voltic will launch itself into the air while performing barrel rolls. Whether or not the glitch occurs depends on the FPS."}

The windshield is at the same height as the other windows, the rearmost pillars are wider and the circular rear-view mirrors are mounted on the doors. It remains a lowrider, but it is classified as a muscle car in-game and, according to police radio chatter, bears the &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt; brand. It uses a unique interior with white leather and brown details.\nAll Voodoos feature \"S.S.\" and \"Limited Edition\" badging, as well as a heart-shaped hood ornament. If the player looks carefully, they may notice a line through the center of the badge. This resembles a 'D', as in Declasse. Also, like many cars in the HD Universe, the Voodoo features a courtesy light which switches on when one of the doors is opened.\nThe Voodoo is seen with both mono-tone and two-tone body colors, with the primary one on the hood, pillars, roof and trunk, and a secondary one on the lower portions of the vehicle. An additional tertiary color is applied on the details of the vehicle, being bumpers, grille, mirrors, handles, trims and wheel rims.

Its weight and bulk, however, make it very resilient to accident deformation. Engine build however is somewhat poor as the Voodoo will begin smoking after 3 to 4 head on collisions. Also the Voodoo cannot perform a burnout, as attempting a burnout will cause the vehicle to slowly roll forward. Top speed is low and suspension is rather low, being a poor choice for uneven terrains. The Voodoo shares the same engine sound as the &lt;a href=\"Patriot\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe performance of the car in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" seems to have improved drastically over the \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" rendition, despite its rusty appearance, with good acceleration, top speed and cornering, and average brakes.

However, it removes the rust spots from the body, interior and details, also denoting the chrome elements around the vehicle. The original trunk radio antenna of the original Voodoo is removed, likely to make way for the \"Aerial\" modifications. Its underside is fitted with a paintable frame and has a visible driveshaft, a different, shorter exhaust setup (dual pipes instead of a single left pipe), and visible hydraulic bars connected to the suspension.\nRather than the Voodoo's two-tone color, the Voodoo Custom only features a single primary color on the body and lower frames, but makes up for it by having an interior color and a dial color. The secondary color is applied to the inner portions of the seats, the steering wheel and the sun visors. The vehicle retains the stock wheel design from the normal Voodoo, being a derivative of the \"Big Worm\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, albeit slightly smaller.\nPerformance.\nThe Voodoo Custom has overall improved performance compared to the normal &lt;a href=\"Voodoo%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Voodoo&lt;/a&gt;, with slightly higher acceleration, top speed, and braking power. However, the Voodoo Custom is still a sub-par choice for anything other than cruising, though. The low ground clearance seem to be still an issue when navigating through uneven roads, although this can be remediated with the use of Hydraulics.\nLike the regular Voodoo, the Voodoo Custom is powered by a medium displacement V8 engine with double-barrel carburetors in an FR layout, coupled to a 4-speed gearbox.

The vehicle uses a steering wheel that is connected to two rudders located on the back, giving the steering ability on it. The engine uses two exhaust pipes that seem to have no extra fixing point, therefore the player can see them wobbling while driving the vehicle.\nLike some of the vehicles in the , the Vortex is probably an original concept from &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt;. The Vortex may spawn with a two-tone paint scheme, with the secondary one as a wide stripe on the middle, as well as the large fan case and the rudders.\nPerformance.\nBeing an amphibious vehicle, is capable of moving both on land and water. The vehicle has extremely poor handling, and often slides off roads. Its acceleration and top speed are mediocre, but workable. Due to being a hovercraft, it has no grip, and it will eventually slide off an angled surface if allowed enough time at idle power. Using the handbrake allows the rudder of the Vortex to deflect beyond normal limits, sacrificing speed for extremely powerful turn forces, which allow the vehicle to rapidly rotate. The \"brakes\" of the vehicle (which can be assumed to be reverse thrust from the fan) are extremely weak, and at top speed, it is often more efficient to rotate the Vortex 180 degrees using the handbrake key, and to begin accelerating forward. The Vortex appears to be powered by a twin-cylinder engine.\nIt has a top speed of 55 mph on level ground, which, unlike other vehicles, is not affected by ground type (asphalt, grass, railroad, etc.) due to the fact that it simply floats over the ground. It has a speed hardcap at 99 mph, which is extremely difficult to achieve, normally only achievable by dropping the vehicle from an extremely high place.\nThe Vortex is also capable of gliding for short distances if the player sends the vehicle flying off a high location, leading to behaviour similar to controlling an airborne car. With some effort, it is possible to 'fly' the Vortex from the summit of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Whetstone\"&gt;Whetstone&lt;/a&gt; and beyond.\nThe rear fan of the Vortex can be damaged by a ram to the rear end, which can potentially reduce the overall performance of the vehicle greatly if the damage is great enough. The motor will also begin generating a trail of black smoke that is much thicker and more opaque than the engine smoke of a normal car.\nLocations.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Kart\"&gt;Kart&lt;/a&gt;, the Vortex will only spawn in specific locations after the mission Cut Throat Business, appearing in the following locations:"}

It has decent acceleration and a high top speed. It cannot perform wheelies or stoppies due to its weight.\nThe vehicle is powered by a pushrod V-Twin engine, evidenced by the details found next to the cylinder blocks. The same is coupled to a 4-speed gearbox and emits a mid-revving sound with a loud engine note.\nInstalling any \"Headlight\" modification will increase its traction slightly, in the same way as a spoiler."}

The jet had the exact same appearance of the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt; except with the badging saying \"V-22\" instead of the Hydra's \"H-27\", as well as the Hover Mode capability. It was also capable of firing two missiles at once, unlike the other aircraft in the game which can only fire one missile at a time.\nAs the jet was eventually re-badged and added to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; rendition of the Hydra, the Vulkan is unlikely to be added to \"GTA Online\" or \"GTA V\"."}

{"id": "27144", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=27144", "title": "WCTR News", "text": "WCTR News is a show on radio station &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20Talk%20Radio%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;West Coast Talk Radio&lt;/a&gt;. The show is hosted by studio correspondent &lt;a href=\"Lianne%20Forget\"&gt;Lianne Forget&lt;/a&gt;. Another worker for the show is field correspondent &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Burns\"&gt;Richard Burns&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe show constantly reports the current events of the game. The events it reports change as the story progresses and the player finishes more missions.\nSome of the things reported by the station are the events that take place during some of the missions that the game's protagonist, &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, performs, many of these events are either told from the perspective of the station, which fills in missing details with speculation or versions of the story which are deliberately altered to make the police look better. One example of this is that, after the mission &lt;a href=\"Yay%20Ka-Boom-Boom\"&gt;Yay Ka-Boom-Boom&lt;/a&gt;, the show attributes the dismantling of the &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Syndicate\"&gt;Loco Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; to an undercover police officer instead of attributing it to Carl.\nAnother common element of the show is \"going to the field with Richard Burns\", the field correspondent, who reports events from the scene, but who constantly makes ridiculous comments or finds himself caught in the situation. An example is that, after mission &lt;a href=\"Are%20You%20Going%20to%20San%20Fierro%3F\"&gt;Are You Going to San Fierro?&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"The%20Truth\"&gt;The Truth&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Weed\"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt; fields are burnt down, Richard Burns goes to the scene to report on how many of the animals nearby were affected by the marijuana smoke, only to get intoxicated by it himself and then proceed to get attacked by a moose high on weed.\nAnother one is after you take over rival gang territories, Richard and Lianne talk about gang violence in the streets of Ganton while Richard learns how to carjack someone and Forget mentions an undercover C.R.A.S.H member \"Getting paid to get high.\"\nAlso, sometimes the comment of local people is given on current situations, but the local people's comments find themselves either very distorted or shortened by the station. Such as when Lianne says that people in &lt;a href=\"Bone%20County\"&gt;Bone County&lt;/a&gt; have reported to have seen strange, inexplicable lights over the desert sky, a man comments that \"Yes, he sure did\", without any further details of the occurrence.\nAn additional WCTR News program is triggered after the game's final storyline mission, &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;End of the Line&lt;/a&gt;, is completed, reporting on the death of &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt; and the return of &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg\"&gt;Madd Dogg&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of this program, instead of usual negative ending phrases, &lt;a href=\"Lianne%20Forget\"&gt;Lianne&lt;/a&gt; says:\" \"This is the end. And a new beginning.\"\"\nOne early broadcast references a pop singer named &lt;a href=\"Crow\"&gt;Crow&lt;/a&gt;, who is later heard on an &lt;a href=\"LCFR\"&gt;LCFR&lt;/a&gt; program called &lt;a href=\"Breathing%20World\"&gt;Breathing World&lt;/a&gt; in .\nTranscripts.\nWCTR News #1.\nAvailable after &lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Beginning\"&gt;In the Beginning&lt;/a&gt;.\nWCTR News #2.\nAvailable after &lt;a href=\"Drive-Thru\"&gt;Drive-Thru&lt;/a&gt;.\nWCTR News #3.\nAvailable after &lt;a href=\"Management%20Issues\"&gt;Management Issues&lt;/a&gt;.\nWCTR News #4.\nAvailable after &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;The Green Sabre&lt;/a&gt;.\nWCTR News #5.\nAvailable after &lt;a href=\"555%20We%20Tip\"&gt;555 We Tip&lt;/a&gt;.\nWCTR News #6.\nAvailable after &lt;a href=\"Yay%20Ka-Boom-Boom\"&gt;Yay Ka-Boom-Boom&lt;/a&gt;.\nWCTR News #7.\nAvailable after &lt;a href=\"Fish%20in%20a%20Barrel\"&gt;Fish in a Barrel&lt;/a&gt;.\nWCTR News #8.\nAvailable after &lt;a href=\"Breaking%20the%20Bank%20at%20Caligula%27s\"&gt;Breaking the Bank at Caligula's&lt;/a&gt;; it can happen during or after the storyline.\nWCTR News #9.\nAvailable after &lt;a href=\"Vertical%20Bird\"&gt;Vertical Bird&lt;/a&gt;.\nWCTR News #10.\nAvailable after &lt;a href=\"Riot%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt;.\nWCTR News #11.\nAvailable after &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;End of the Line&lt;/a&gt;."}

Instead of actually issuing a ruling, Grady forces both litigants to participate in a deadly contest, which is chosen by the courtroom audience, to determine who wins the case.

Wade last saw his friends driving to a &lt;a href=\"Davis%20Quartz\"&gt;quarry&lt;/a&gt; with a local dealer named &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;, who likely killed them, unbeknownst to Wade, who thought his friends simply abandoned him. Trevor proceeded to look after Wade and at one point sodomized him with a hockey stick.\nIt is also mentioned by Wade's cousin Floyd that Wade had a past relationship with a woman named &lt;a href=\"Evelyn\"&gt;Evelyn&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, Wade is first seen alongside &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Jakowski\"&gt;Ron Jakowski&lt;/a&gt; trying to calm down &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt; after Trevor had sexual intercourse with Johnny's girlfriend &lt;a href=\"Ashley%20Butler\"&gt;Ashley Butler&lt;/a&gt;, which ended with Trevor killing Johnny and starting a war between him and &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;; Wade joins Trevor in his attacks against the gang.\nWade is later asked by Trevor to search for &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael Townley&lt;/a&gt;, who Wade locates in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, after several failed attempts and threats from Trevor, under the name \"Michael De Santa\". They move into the &lt;a href=\"Floyd%27s%20Apartment\"&gt;apartment&lt;/a&gt; of Wade's cousin, &lt;a href=\"Floyd\"&gt;Floyd&lt;/a&gt;, much to Floyd's dismay. Wade also assists Trevor in &lt;a href=\"Scouting%20the%20Port\"&gt;scouting the port&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href=\"The%20Merryweather%20Heist\"&gt;heist&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter an incident in Floyd's apartment, which results in the deaths of both Floyd and his girlfriend, &lt;a href=\"Debra\"&gt;Debra&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor, in an attempt to stop Wade from discovering their deaths, claims that Floyd and Debra have \"disappeared\", just like Wade's old friends, before taking over the &lt;a href=\"Vanilla%20Unicorn\"&gt;Vanilla Unicorn&lt;/a&gt; strip club and ordering two strippers to attend to Wade. Wade remains with them even after the main storyline, and even has dialogue with him claiming that each time that he tries to leave, the strippers give him another dance.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" (after \"Grand Theft Auto V\").\nIn &lt;a href=\"2022\"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;, Wade is presumably still living in Sandy Shores and appears to have reconnected with his old crew, the &lt;a href=\"Fooliganz\"&gt;Fooliganz&lt;/a&gt;, following Trevor's departure. Wade invites his cousin &lt;a href=\"Dax\"&gt;Dax&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Fooliganz, to set up shop within Trevor's former businesses, such as &lt;a href=\"Ace%20Liquor\"&gt;Ace Liquor&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"The%20Freakshop\"&gt;disused warehouse&lt;/a&gt;. Though Wade himself does not make a reappearance, he is mentioned by the gang, who seem to respect him and talk highly of him.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nWade appears to be a parody of the stereotypical Juggalo; a fan of the Insane Clown Posse, Tech N9ne and other artists that make music called \"horrorcore\" or \"the wicked shit\" originating from the Midwest. He is described by his artwork as an \"intellectual\", Wade is believed to be mentally challenged, based on his speech and dialogue. He is loyal to Trevor and will follow his every order, most likely out of fear, as Trevor often intimidates him. Part of this behavior comes from the fact that he has an inherently innocent, almost childlike mindset and considers Trevor to be a good person, believing everything he says, even when he is obviously lying. \nHowever, despite his apparent innocent and childish behavior, he doesn't seem to have moral issues regarding killing someone (as he suggested to kill &lt;a href=\"Ashley%20Butler\"&gt;Ashley Butler&lt;/a&gt; right after Trevor killed &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;) even though he actually never killed anyone during the game. It could be possible that he ails from a stunted moral compass and simply does not have a good understanding of right and wrong. Also, as part of the contrast with his goofy appearance, Wade is a resourceful person in finding people, having been able to track down &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; by knowing only his past alias as Michael Townley and the family members.\nAppearance.\nWade is a Caucasian male of average size. He has brown hair styled into dreadlocks and tied back, blue eyes, a slight goatee, and several facial piercings. Being an associate of &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt;, Wade shows physical signs of &lt;a href=\"Methamphetamine\"&gt;meth&lt;/a&gt; usage, with his face being heavily scarred. His usual outfit consists of a black and red &lt;a href=\"Fatal%20Incursion\"&gt;Fatal Incursion&lt;/a&gt; jersey over a white t-shirt, and baggy &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JNCO\"&gt;JNCO&lt;/a&gt;-style blue jeans with brown sandals and white socks. He has a brown &lt;a href=\"Harsh%20Souls\"&gt;Harsh Souls&lt;/a&gt; bracer on his right wrist and a watch on his left. His alternative outfit is composed of a red bandanna wrapped around his head, a sleeveless black-and-red Fatal Incursion hoodie over a black T-shirt, baggy black Tripp-style shorts and black sneakers with red shoelaces.\nWade often paints his face white and black. He also wears eyelet earrings in his stretched ears, which seem to be around an inch and has several tattoos on his body, most notably on his hands and neck.\nInfluence.\nWade's appearance is very likely based on of the Insane Clown Posse."}

The first job is &lt;a href=\"Torpedo%20Run\"&gt;sinking a drug boat&lt;/a&gt; belonging to &lt;a href=\"Zhou%20Ming\"&gt;Zhou Ming&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Ming%20Family\"&gt;Triad&lt;/a&gt; gang, which Huang does.\nShortly after, Heston meets Huang again, where he tells him that his contact has an \"illegal wiretap\" of the Koreans, but there's several antennas blocking it, so if they want to know about the wiretap, they need to &lt;a href=\"Scrambled\"&gt;destroy the police antennae&lt;/a&gt;, a task that Huang performs.

The brothers are involved in selling drugs and cooking meth, with Elwood serving as a leader to his brothers.\nWalton and his brothers are familiar with &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow drug dealer and the owner of &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Enterprises\"&gt;Trevor Philips Enterprises&lt;/a&gt;, whom the brothers are rivals with.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nTrevor arrives at the &lt;a href=\"Yellow%20Jack%20Inn\"&gt;Yellow Jack Inn&lt;/a&gt; and confronts &lt;a href=\"Tao%20Cheng\"&gt;Tao Cheng&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Cheng%27s%20translator\"&gt;interpreter&lt;/a&gt;. When they mention they want to pursue other jobs, Trevor threatens them to get them to reveal who they are working with, which turn out to be the O'Neil brothers. Trevor, now furious, proceeds to the &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20ranch\"&gt;O'Neil ranch&lt;/a&gt;, calling Elwood O'Neil to threaten him on the way there.\nUpon arrival, Walton is seen leaving with Elwood and Wynn on a grey &lt;a href=\"Dubsta\"&gt;Dubsta&lt;/a&gt; to meet their Triad associates. Trevor begins a heavy assault against the guards and goes to the basement where the O'Neil's meth lab is located and sets it on fire, blowing up the entire ranch.\nBrothers Elwood, Walton and Wynn eventually return to the farm, only to discover it has been destroyed and their brothers are dead. An enraged Elwood phones Trevor, who is in Los Santos, and threatens to kill him. Trevor, however, brushes the threat off and gives away his location while taunting Elwood and daring him and his brothers to come to Los Santos and kill him. Elwood, Walton and Wynn then travel with Elwood's Dubsta to Los Santos. After discovering where Trevor is being holed up, the O'Neils were going to fire anti-tank rockets at Trevor's safehouse only to learn from one of Trevor's roommates that Trevor has returned to Sandy Shores.\nElwood, Walton and Wynn travel back to Sandy Shores to find Trevor. They eventually realise that Trevor's associate &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; is tailing them, and they drive into the woods to lose him, but an &lt;a href=\"Deer\"&gt;elk&lt;/a&gt; on the road leads to their crash and subsequent escape into a forest, located somewhere in the &lt;a href=\"Raton%20Canyon\"&gt;Raton Canyon&lt;/a&gt;. Unable to find the O'Neils in the forest by himself, Franklin calls Trevor for air support. Trevor and his other associate Michael De Santa come with a helicopter to help Franklin with the O'Neils.\nUsing a rifle fitted with a thermal scope, Michael shoots Walton and Wynn dead, before Franklin locates Elwood and shoots him while he tries to escape, killing him.\nCharacter.\nAppearance.\nSimilarly to Elwood and Wynn in the same mission, the character model of Walton in the &lt;a href=\"Cutscenes\"&gt;cutscene&lt;/a&gt; is different than the one in-game. All three characters use a randomized variant of a generic Alamo Sea pedestrian (dubbed \"Alamo\" in &lt;a href=\"Director%20Mode\"&gt;Director Mode&lt;/a&gt;)."}

Vehicles will continue to spawn in the car park at the front. However, even though Carl owns the firm, he still runs the risk of getting a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;one-star wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, if seen entering these vehicles.\nThe vehicles in the showroom can be driven, but Carl needs to break a window to drive them out of the building; a kick or shotgun blast is sufficient to break the glass, other weapons need more times to break the glass.

The perfect opportunity is just up the street from the garage: the Wang Cars dealership in Downtown. Carl and Cesar set off to steal cars to put on display in the showroom in order to maintain the appearance of legitimacy. After populating the showroom's floors, Carl then begins a lucrative automobile import/export exchange at the nearby &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Basin\"&gt;Easter Basin&lt;/a&gt; docks. With all of his automotive \"businesses\" in place, Carl begins to rake in the profits, thereby establishing himself as an entrepreneurial force in San Fierro.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nAfter completing the Wang Cars mission strand, a total of five vehicles will spawn inside Wang Cars:\nOnce a mission is completed, the car(s) featured in it will become available for driving.

Weapons, however, may not be confiscated in certain circumstances such as in when &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;dating&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Barbara%20Schternvart\"&gt;Barbara Schternvart&lt;/a&gt;. In , the player is also given the option to 'buy back' his weapons. In the mobile versions of \"GTA III\", and , the player won't lose any weapons, regardless of how many times they have been busted.\nWanted Level Limit.\n\"GTA III\", \"GTA San Andreas\" and \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" implement a limit to the wanted levels early in the game; for the first part of the game, the maximum level attainable is four stars (with the exception of entering \"5-star\" no fly zones in \"GTA San Andreas\" - only 4 in the mobile versions); Later, when the player can access &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, a five-star level can be attained.\nThe \"coveted\" six-star level does not become available until much later in the game, or until the player can access &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Vale\"&gt;Shoreside Vale&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.\nIn \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\", the maximum wanted level is also limited to four stars at the beginning of the game, though the limit unlocking is not as related to gaining access to locations as in the other games. In the former game, a five-star level is obtainable when the player can access &lt;a href=\"Starfish%20Island\"&gt;Starfish Island&lt;/a&gt;, and in \"GTA Vice City Stories\" after the player can &lt;a href=\"Empire%20Building\"&gt;build an empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ultimate six-star level is only available after taking over &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz\"&gt;Diaz's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Estate\"&gt;mansion&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Vice City\", while the latter game allows attaining such a level after the player can access &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Beach\"&gt;Vice City Beach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prawn%20Island\"&gt;Prawn Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nWanted Levels.\nOne Star.\nAny &lt;a href=\"Police%20%28law%20enforcement%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Police%20Officers\"&gt;officers&lt;/a&gt;, that spot the player, will give chase in an attempt to apprehend them. In all 3D Universe games, except \"GTA Advance\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\", only one officer at a time will actually pursue the player. When having a one-star wanted level, if the player flees from the police long enough without committing any additional crimes, the police will lose interest and the player will eventually lose the wanted star on its own. \nAll other officers in the area will simply walk or stand idly until the pursuing officer is either killed and/or out of the player's range. The police will attempt to knock the player down with their fists (in \"GTA III)\" and &lt;a href=\"nightstick\"&gt;nightstick&lt;/a&gt;s (in other 3D Universe games). They also shoot if they are threatened by the player. An exception to this rule is if the protagonist is inaccessible to the police officer; for example, if the player is standing on top of a vehicle, he will pull out his gun and start shooting (in \"GTA San Andreas\", officers will shoot at Carl if he is holding a firearm or explosives). Any existing &lt;a href=\"Police%20Car\"&gt;Police cars&lt;/a&gt; will start to chase down the player, but not aggressively, however the occupants will exit their vehicle, and begin a foot chase when they get too close.\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\", &lt;a href=\"HPV-1000\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"VCPD%20WinterGreen\"&gt;bikes&lt;/a&gt; also chase the player, their &lt;a href=\"Motor%20Officer\"&gt;drivers&lt;/a&gt; shoot at the player in \"GTA San Andreas\", and &lt;a href=\"Ranger\"&gt;Ranger&lt;/a&gt;s chase the player instead of police cars/bikes when Carl is in the countryside/desert.\nA one-star wanted level originates from committing the following minor crimes. Many of these will not immediately result in a wanted level unless a police officer is physically around to witness them and/or multiple offenses are committed in quick succession:\nTwo Stars.\nAt a two-star wanted level, the police will start actively searching for the player. Officers that spawn during such a wanted level will now shoot to kill, even if the player is unarmed. Personnel in cars spawn and aggressively give chase rather than simply follow behind to overtake or spin the player out. On &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Predator\"&gt;armed police boats&lt;/a&gt; give chase. When having a wanted level of at least two stars, police will no longer lose interest as they do during a one-star wanted level. The player must actively seek to lower their wanted level. However, in \"GTA San Andreas\", when going through rural areas, one star may be lost on its own.\nTwo stars are attained by:\nThree Stars.\nAt a three-star wanted level, pursuing police vehicles become even \"more\" aggressive, driving at maximum speed and will occasionally set up armed roadblocks on main roads. &lt;a href=\"HPV-1000\"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"VCPD%20WinterGreen\"&gt;bikes&lt;/a&gt; don't chase the player anymore but a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;police helicopter&lt;/a&gt; is called in to provide air support. They will shine a light and start shooting with a machine gun; from \"GTA Vice City\" onwards, they will also &lt;a href=\"Special%20Weapons%20and%20Tactics\"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt; members down to the player's location and now join the chase. They wear full body armor and are armed with Uzi sub-machine guns.\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", if Carl is on foot and is spotted by a police car, one officer will use a &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Action%20Shotgun\"&gt;Pump Action Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, in \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\", undercover &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Squad%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice Squad&lt;/a&gt; detectives armed with Uzis and driving &lt;a href=\"VCPD%20Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetahs&lt;/a&gt; also give chase. \nIn \"GTA Vice City\", \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" (except for the mobile versions) and \"GTA Vice City Stories\", patrolling police officers will deploy &lt;a href=\"Spike%20Strip\"&gt;Spike Strip&lt;/a&gt;s from the side of the road, intent on puncturing the tires of the car the player's in.\nThree stars are attained by:\nFour Stars.\nAt a four-star wanted level, &lt;a href=\"Special%20Weapons%20and%20Tactics\"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt; teams will give chase in armored vans. Roadblocks now consist of these heavier and larger &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;SWAT vans&lt;/a&gt;, making them more difficult to ram through.\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", the police helicopter is joined by a &lt;a href=\"VCN%20Maverick\"&gt;News Chopper&lt;/a&gt; (which is replaced by another Police Maverick when shot down), and up to two &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;s that will pursue and attempt to shoot down the player if they are flying an aircraft, a helicopter, or even using a Vortex. \nFour stars are attained by:\nFive Stars.\nAt a five-star wanted level, the local police are supplanted (replaced) by &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; agents which takes over a majority of the chase (local police will still chase the player if they see them and police officers on foot endlessly spawn when the player is on foot in \"GTA San Andreas\").\nThe streets begins to clear of civilians (in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", however, there are still lots of &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt; in the area). Four-FBI teams of heavily armed and armored agents drive armored unmarked cars and SUVs and make for formidable opponents. The FBI agents are armed with &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;AK-47&lt;/a&gt;s and 9mm handguns in \"GTA III\" and &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;MP5&lt;/a&gt;s in later games.\nTheir driving is considered extremely aggressive, and they opt to ram the player's vehicle head on at high speed and then batter it to pieces before one can recover. In \"GTA III\", the pursuing police helicopter is joined by a second, and both stick to the player doggedly and fire at the protagonist whenever they get the chance. The roadblocks now consist of FBI vehicles, which are harder to ram through. Their &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;MP5&lt;/a&gt;s are accurate which means travelling on foot is dangerous and when encountering a roadblock, it will tear through most &lt;a href=\"Vehicles\"&gt;vehicles&lt;/a&gt; fairly quickly. The waters are also saturated with &lt;a href=\"Predator\"&gt;Predator&lt;/a&gt;s at this wanted level. At five stars, little to no police cars will appear on the road. \nFrom this wanted level, the police will also become aggressive and surround the player's building if the player intends to flee inside the building. \nFive stars are attained by:\nSix Stars.\nAt six stars, the FBI will refer the matter to the &lt;a href=\"military\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt;, and all civilians will be replaced with army personnel to give chase in &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;Barracks OL&lt;/a&gt; trucks and &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; tanks, making travel in ordinary vehicles extremely hazardous, if not outright impossible. Civilians have almost completely disappeared from the streets at this point (in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", however, there are still lots of pedestrians in the general vicinity).\nThe soldiers drive recklessly and bid to ram the player until their health becomes empty (or off-road if in a vehicle when it comes to Barracks OL), this is extremely dangerous with Rhinos since when the tanks ram any vehicles operated by the player (except another Rhino), they will be destroyed instantly thus &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; the player inside (in \"GTA San Andreas\", the vehicle catches on fire for a few seconds, giving the player time to get out of their vehicle before it explodes).\nRoadblocks now consist of Barracks OL trucks. Police helicopters will still appear and aggressively fly towards the player's location. Soldiers carry &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;M16s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;MP5&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;M4s&lt;/a&gt; depending on the game. In \"GTA San Andreas\", they may also carry &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;pistols&lt;/a&gt; (like in the mission &lt;a href=\"Robbing%20Uncle%20Sam\"&gt;Robbing Uncle Sam&lt;/a&gt; and its occurrence is rare) and &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Action%20Shotgun\"&gt;shotguns&lt;/a&gt; (this is somewhat strange because they never use it in a gunfight).\nUnlike in the story mode where enemies miss quite often, the soldiers are incredibly accurate where gunfights are considered suicide as they will take the player down very fast especially on foot (like the FBI at five stars).\nIt is difficult to attain a 6-star wanted level without the use of cheats, given the difficulty of surviving the 4 and 5 star wanted levels for any length of time.\nThese actions will merit six stars:\nLosing a Wanted Level.\nWanted stars can be lost by:"}
{"id": "40087", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=40087", "title": "Wanted Level in GTA (1997 game)", "text": "Whilst cities in &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;\"Grand Theft Auto\"&lt;/a&gt;, ' and ' have other emergency services, as a criminal the player is more likely to draw the attention of &lt;a href=\"Police%20%28law%20enforcement%29\"&gt;cops&lt;/a&gt;, especially after committing various crimes. Their degree of hostility and enforcement towards the player is determined by the player's wanted level, which is considerably rudimentary when originally conceived.\nDescription.\nGenerally speaking, any crime committed (including hit-and-run, firearms discharge, collisions with vehicles, vehicle theft, etc.) will eventually lead to the player attaining a wanted level, regardless of whether or not a police officer is on the scene; on occasions, police radio chatter can be heard following a crime the player commits. If the player breaks a law within earshot of a passing police officer or a moving &lt;a href=\"Police%20Car\"&gt;police car&lt;/a&gt;, they will instantaneously receive a wanted level. The more crimes the player commits, the higher the rating goes. Also, sometimes the player automatically gets noticed, if a mission leads to someone calling the police, or in the case of bank robberies that not surprisingly put the police on full alert.\nThe police's aim is in general to &lt;a href=\"Busted\"&gt;arrest&lt;/a&gt; the player, although they will not hesitate in shooting or trying to ram them off the road in the desperate attempt to stop the player, and they get more trigger happy the higher the wanted level. On arrest, the player is dropped off at the nearest police station, losing all weapons and armor and half of the score multiplier, but the wanted level is reset back to zero.\nWanted levels.\nThe player's wanted level, which reflects how much attention the police give them, is simply illustrated by one or more police heads on top of the screen (in \"GTA\", the police heads are those of generalized American cops with , while those in \"GTA London\" are distinguishable by their signature ); the heads bob in an up-and-down motion if the player is in sight of one or more police officers, but remain stationary when the player evades the police. This feature was carried over to &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;\"Grand Theft Auto 2\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the start of the game, the player has no wanted level and the player is ignored, but when the player commits a serious crime, this warrants the cops paying heightened attention to players, and the wanted level correspondingly increases, up to a maximum of four police heads. At wanted level one, the police tend only to give chase if they are in the area anyway (unlike \"GTA 2\" and its successors, even a single wanted level will not disperse on its own), whereas at four, the police set up roadblocks on major roads, shoot on sight, and send all available units to the player's location.\nEvasion.\nThere are only two ways the player can evade the police, as hiding in alleyways or other areas inaccessible by cops will not make a Wanted Level attained to disperse on its own.\nDotted around each city are a number of &lt;a href=\"Spray%20Shop\"&gt;respray shops&lt;/a&gt; (if one of the cities are large for inexperienced players, then finding it will be difficult), where the player's vehicle can be resprayed, or have the license plates changed, to disguise it. This makes the police think the player is someone else, even if they see the player enter the shop, although this does cost money (i.e. points). The higher a player's wanted level, the more points it costs to have a car re-sprayed or plates changed.\nAn alternate method is simply to locate and acquire a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Bribes\"&gt;cop bribe&lt;/a&gt;, which can be found in specific breakable crate in any city. Although the pickup is cost-free, its rarity makes this approach equally difficult as each bribe is a one time only use. Another similar pickup, the \"Get Outta Jail Free Card\", allows the player to avoid the pitfalls of being arrested by having the player retain their weapons, armor and multiplier as of the time they were arrested.

In \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\", there was only a minor difference between the first and fourth (the highest) &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;wanted levels&lt;/a&gt;. The overhauled six-star system would prove to provide much greater 'spectrum' of threat, allowing the player to easily escape when only one police \"head\" was present, and presenting them with an almost unsurvivable challenge at level six.\nWanted levels, as in \"GTA\", are displayed and measured with \"head\" icons (rather than the stars seen in later games), but new to \"GTA 2\" was the shaking of the heads when police knew the player's location, essentially a visibility indicator."}

Rather than the &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;proximity-based system&lt;/a&gt; used in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", it returns to a version more similar to &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; titles. The most notable difference to this is how stars are lost. Though over time they do lower themselves, and can still be lost at a &lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;Pay 'n' Spray&lt;/a&gt; out of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; view. Stars can also be removed by disabling police cars. Each wanted level has a corresponding number of cars to take out (ie, the first level has one car, the second has two, etc). The cars can be taken out by ramming at high speed or by forcing them to crash. Using &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20in%20GTA%20Chinatown%20Wars\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; to disable a pursuing police vehicle is considered as retaliation, and the disabled vehicle does not count towards reducing the current wanted level. There is a slight delay period after this before the rating will lower, and the player is on \"probationary\" stars for a period, as in 3D Universe games, before being clear.\nWanted Levels.\nOne star.\nA one star wanted level is obtained when the player does a \"minor crime\". Any LCPD police patrols will give chase and attempt to arrest the player on sight. Officers on foot use the nightstick against the player. Police cars follow the player at relatively low speeds. A one star wanted level can be removed by staying out of trouble and police sight for a short while, using the Pay 'n Spray, disabling one police vehicle or switching between vehicles if no police officers are nearby.\nA one-star Wanted level is attained by committing the following crimes:\nTwo stars.\nAt two stars, officers shoot to kill more often. Officers in cars now chase the player, rather than simply following behind, and often try to overtake the player or run them off-road. Additionally, if the player is swimming then they will be chased by the &lt;a href=\"Coast%20Guard%20Launch\"&gt;Coast Guard Launch&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo Wanted stars are attained by:\nThree stars.\nAt three stars, a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; chases the player. Roadblocks are also set up using &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s, and the &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tactical%20Response%20Unit\"&gt;TRU&lt;/a&gt; joins the LCPD. The NOOSE TRU uses the heavy &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;s which are harder to take out by disabling them. The NOOSE TRU teams also use the &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt; to engage the player.\nThree Wanted stars are attained by:\nFour stars.\nAt four stars, more &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;s and Police cars are dispatched. The &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; also gives chase using the &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Rancher\"&gt;FIB Rancher&lt;/a&gt;. The FIB Ranchers are slightly easier to take out than the NOOSE Enforcers, but are much faster to compensate. FIB teams come only one a vehicle and use the &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt; to engage the player.\nFour Wanted stars are attained by:\nFive stars.\nAt five stars, a greater number of &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Rancher\"&gt;FIB Rancher&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s pursue the player and become more aggressive on foot and on the road.\nFive Wanted stars are attained by\nSix stars.\nAt six stars, the army joins the fray. The army engages the player relentlessly without any regard for collateral damage. The army sends &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; tanks after the player; they are extraordinarily difficult to disable, usually only possible by luring them into water. Unlike the 3D Era soldiers, the army uses the Rhino's turret in full effect.

One star is for relatively minor offences, whereas six stars are for the most serious crimes. The wanted level serves as a scale measuring the amplitude of the police's response to the player's unlawful actions: the more stars the player gains, the more determined the police will get to track them down. Stars are cumulative, meaning that a wanted level below six stars will increase if the players repeatedly assaults police officers or civilians. \nIn-game Information.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Easy%20Fare\"&gt;Easy Fare&lt;/a&gt;, the game briefly explains how the wanted level functions: \"\u201cThe area the cops search in is represented by the flashing zone on the Radar. Cops in this zone are marked by flashing red and blue icons. To lose your wanted level escape the flashing zone and keep a low profile. If you are seen leaving the zone by the cops then they will refocus their search and a new zone will be created. If the wanted stars are grayed out then the Cops have lost sight of you. The cops are less likely to identify you if you swap vehicles or run through alleyways and side streets.\u201d\" It is true that swapping vehicles out of the cops\u2019 sight will result in their delaying to recognise the player, though only for a couple of seconds at best, making it a highly unreliable technique to escape from the cops.\nHUD.\nThe wanted level is indicated by a six-star gauge on the top-right corner of the &lt;a href=\"Heads-Up%20Display\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt;, and will always be accompanied by a flashing blue and red search radius emanating from the player\u2019s position on the &lt;a href=\"Radar\"&gt;Radar&lt;/a&gt;. Cops are represented by flashing blue and red icons. The player will remain at the centre of the search radius as long as the cops see the player. If the cops lose sight of the player, the radius will stop and remain at the last location where the player was last seen. Naturally, if the cops spot the player again, the radius will recenter on the player. If the player leaves the search radius for a sufficient amount of time, typically several seconds, the cops will abandon their search and the wanted level will dissolve.\nStars will either show in white, gray or flashing gray:\nA voice-over of a police dispatcher will be heard upon acquiring a wanted level in a voice that is less muffled and easier to understand than in the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;. The dispatcher will typically mention the crime committed by the player and the location of the incident as in the following case of reckless driving: \"\u201cControl, I need assistance for a reckless driver on Albany Avenue\u201d.\"\nImplications.\nWhen wanted by the police, the player will lose the ability to:\nAcquiring a wanted level during a taxi ride will cause the driver to leave the cab and flee. Acquiring a wanted level will also cause several &lt;a href=\"Missions%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt; to fail.\nArrestation.\nThe police can arrest the player at any wanted level, though it is likeliest with a one-star level as it is the only level that won\u2019t result in the police using their firearms. The player can get arrested while on foot (only with one star) or in a stationary vehicle. In the former case, the player can resist arrest, which will immediately spark a two-star wanted level and cause the police to shoot. After being arrested, the player will respawn at the nearest &lt;a href=\"Police%20Stations\"&gt;police station&lt;/a&gt;, stripped of &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;body armour&lt;/a&gt;.\nClearing a Wanted Level.\nA wanted level can be cleared by:\nPolice bribes no longer exist in the HD Universe.\nPolice Behavior.\nPolice in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" are well armed, smarter, more determined and more lethal than in previous \"Grand Theft Auto\" games; they can even respond to crimes committed out of their sight, as civilians can call the police on their &lt;a href=\"Cell%20Phone\"&gt;cell phones to report crimes&lt;/a&gt;. Police officers can also come to the player's aid, as long as they don't have a wanted level, intervening in fist fights to apprehend violent &lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;Pedestrians&lt;/a&gt;, and providing suppressive fire against armed threats in shoot-outs.\nThe police use their available weapons intelligently\u2014an officer with a &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Action%20Shotgun\"&gt;Pump Action Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; will move in closer to the player to compensate for the weapon's short range, while one with an &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;M4A1&lt;/a&gt; will stay back to take advantage of distance. During a chase, officers will coordinate themselves and will attempt to box the player in with several cars, drive faster, use the and try harder as the player's wanted level increases. \nPolice officers can commandeer civilian vehicles (parked or occupied) if their vehicles are destroyed, or if a police vehicle is unavailable; they may even commandeer the cars parked in front of the player's &lt;a href=\"safehouse\"&gt;safehouse&lt;/a&gt;s. Inside safehouses and other buildings with interiors, the police will continue to pursue and wound or even kill the player but cannot arrest them.\nWanted Levels.\nOne Star.\nThis is the only level where the police will not use their firearms (except in multiplayer mode as it lacks a \"&lt;a href=\"busted\"&gt;busted&lt;/a&gt;\" animation). Instead they will seek to arrest the player. &lt;a href=\"Police%20Car\"&gt;Police Car&lt;/a&gt;s will chase the player at moderate speed, trying to corral and box in rather than collide with the player's vehicle. The search radius for one star is approximately two city blocks large.\nOne star is attained by:\nTwo Stars.\nFrom two stars onwards, the police will use their firearms, which may include &lt;a href=\"Shotgun\"&gt;pump shotguns&lt;/a&gt;. During chases, they will try to overtake the player or run them off-road. They will also use their cars to try and box the player in if they crash. \nTwo stars are attained by: \nThree Stars.\nFrom three stars onwards, the player will lose the ability to board the &lt;a href=\"Subway%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;subway&lt;/a&gt;. The police will become more aggressive in their pursuit, attempting to pin the player's vehicle against buildings and run them off the road. The &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Patriotism%20and%20Immigration%20Authority\"&gt;Patriotism and Immigration Authority&lt;/a&gt; will step in, setting up roadblocks on main roads and bridges and deploying &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Cruiser\"&gt;Cruisers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Patriot\"&gt;Patriots&lt;/a&gt; to track the player down. The NOOSE Patriots will attempt to ram the player from the front, putting the player and Police Officers inside at risk of &lt;a href=\"Involuntary%20Ejection\"&gt;a windshield ejection from their vehicle&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; will also deploy a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, which will shine a spotlight on the player at night and open fire if the police officers on board get a clear shot. The helicopter will periodically break off from pursuit and retreat if the player goes underground, stays inside a large structure for a long time, or kills both riflemen on board. In \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", Police Mavericks' riflemen are equipped with &lt;a href=\"M249\"&gt;Advanced Machine Guns&lt;/a&gt; instead of &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt;s. Police &lt;a href=\"Predator\"&gt;Predator&lt;/a&gt;s are dispatched if the player is in or near water. Like the Police Maverick, they convey two riflemen armed with M4 Carbine Rifles on board.\nThree stars are attained by: \nFour Stars.\nAt four stars, the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; and/or the &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tactical%20Response%20Unit\"&gt;Tactical Response Unit&lt;/a&gt; join the fray and the player will be confronted by &lt;a href=\"Enforcer%23GTA%20IV\"&gt;Enforcers&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Buffalo\"&gt;FIB Buffaloes&lt;/a&gt; in addition to the previously mentioned forces. Tactical Response Unit Officers and FIB Agents come four to a vehicle and are armed with Carbine Rifles, although some of them carry &lt;a href=\"SMG\"&gt;SMG&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Shotgun\"&gt;Pump Action Shotguns&lt;/a&gt;, and wear &lt;a href=\"body%20armor\"&gt;body armor&lt;/a&gt; for protection. The LCPD Pilot and the LCPD riflemen in the Police Maverick will leave to allow NOOSE Tactical Response Unit Pilot and NOOSE Tactical Response Unit riflemen (if NOOSE TRU is deployed). The search area is approximately the size of &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;. In \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", all Law Enforcement Officers start firing upon the player while in pursuit at this level, and NOOSE Tactical Response Unit Officers and/or FIB Agents use &lt;a href=\"Assault%20SMG\"&gt;Assault SMG&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Explosive%20Shotgun\"&gt;Automatic Shotguns&lt;/a&gt; as well as the aforementioned weapons against the player. Meanwhile, civilian traffic through the area is heavily restricted, making finding a means of escape difficult.\nFour stars are attained by: \nFive Stars.\nAt five stars, the Police Mavericks will leave and be replaced by two &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;NOOSE Annihilators&lt;/a&gt;. In the main game and \"The Lost and Damned\", all Law Enforcement Officers &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;fire upon&lt;/a&gt; the player while in pursuit (In \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", they will do this at four stars). All Law Enforcement Officers employ more advanced driving techniques, such as the PIT Maneuver, as they try to make the player spin out of control and crash. &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; and NOOSE Tactical Response Unit cooperation is more apparent at this level, both forces spawning and pursuing the player in equal numbers. &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Cruiser\"&gt;NOOSE Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Patriot\"&gt;NOOSE Patriot&lt;/a&gt;s will now disappear and make room for more &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Buffalo\"&gt;FIB Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Patrol\"&gt;Police Patrol&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s. In areas with tall buildings, officers with &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Sniper\"&gt;Combat Sniper&lt;/a&gt; rifles will aim and shoot at the player when in their sights.\nFive stars are attained by: \nSix Stars.\nAt a six-star wanted level, the search area is approximately the size of the borough of &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;. The number of &lt;a href=\"Police%20Patrol\"&gt;Police Patrol&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s reduces so more &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Buffalo\"&gt;FIB Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;es and/or &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;NOOSE Enforcers&lt;/a&gt; can join the chase/shootout. All Law Enforcement Vehicles fire upon and ram the player relentlessly with very little regard for collateral damage. Unlike previous \"Grand Theft Auto\" games, the &lt;a href=\"Military\"&gt;Military&lt;/a&gt; is not deployed. The LCPD Officers armed with PSG-1 Sniper Rifles will continue to spawn. \nThese actions will merit six stars: \nAchievements/Trophies.\nThe player can earn two &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20and%20Trophies%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;Achievements/Trophies&lt;/a&gt; associated with the Wanted Level, however the use of specific Cheat Codes blocks the rewards."}
{"id": "270412", "revid": "25702193", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=270412", "title": "Wanted Level in GTA Online", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level\"&gt;Wanted Level&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" is a measure to determine how much a &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; is wanted by the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Police Department&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County%20Sheriff\"&gt;Los Santos County Sheriff&lt;/a&gt;, and/or the &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;National Office of Security Enforcement&lt;/a&gt;. Akin to the &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level system&lt;/a&gt; of the parent game, \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" features a five-star wanted scale. This stands in contrast to every \"Grand Theft Auto\" installment preceding \"GTA V\", all of which feature six-star scales instead.\nDescription.\nPolice officers in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" are much more aggressive and persistent in pursuing the perpetrator than in previous games. Police AI is noticeably more intelligent in comparison to \"GTA IV\"; officers are less likely to miss their targets when engaged in a gunfight, and will take better cover from an armed suspect. During vehicular pursuits, officers employ a range of tactics aimed at stopping the player's car, such as the infamous . Like in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"V\", an officer will commandeer a civilian vehicle to continue a pursuit if their own police vehicle is destroyed or becomes inaccessible; if an occupied vehicle is nearby, an officer will carjack its driver before using the vehicle. Also similar to \"IV\" and \"V\" is the ability for police to respond to crimes committed out of their sight, as civilians may call the police on their &lt;a href=\"Cell%20Phone\"&gt;cell phones&lt;/a&gt; if they witness a crime. Unlike \"GTA V\", however, civilians will never physically pull out their phone to call the police when reporting a crime.\nPolice search the player in the same style as \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\". In this manner, no search radius is deployed; instead, police will search across the entire map. Each individual officer has an arc-shaped field of sight, and will actively engage the player if they enter said field. Should the avatar enter an officer's field of sight, the player's mini-map will flash red and blue, signifying that they can be \"seen\" by the police. When not visible by police, the mini-map will display nearby officers' fields of view, which are highlighted in a translucent blue. The player must go undetected for a set amount of time in order to lose their wanted level, and the time it takes to do so increases as the player earns more stars. The player can also immediately lose their wanted level by &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;dying&lt;/a&gt; or calling &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester&lt;/a&gt; to remove it, with the latter option at the cost of two hundred in-game dollars per star attained, or by extension, a maximum of one thousand dollars for five stars.\nWanted Levels.\nOne Star.\nAt a one-star wanted level, the player is considered to have committed a \"minor\" crime. Regardless, the police will never attempt to actually arrest the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; by means of gunpoint; instead, they will immediately shoot to kill. This differs from earlier \"Grand Theft Auto\" installments, including \"GTA V\", where the player has the choice of getting &lt;a href=\"busted\"&gt;busted&lt;/a&gt; once the wanted level is attained. The lack of gunpoint is due to no busted mechanic being implemented in \"GTA Online\". When confronted, however, the player does have the choice of resisting law enforcement, either by physically fighting back or attempting to escape on foot or by car. Either option will immediately raise the player's wanted level to two stars.\nWhen wanted, police will pursue a fleeing player on foot if they exit their shooting range. Officers in police cars will also spawn and follow the player. At one star, a minimum of one police vehicle (excluding any officers pursuing on foot) will pursue the player at any given time. Any officers that are nearby, including other NPCs such as &lt;a href=\"Security%20Guards\"&gt;Security Guards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt; personnel, will attempt to kill the player when the first star is attained. &lt;a href=\"Firemen\"&gt;Firefighters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paramedics\"&gt;Paramedics&lt;/a&gt; may also become hostile towards a wanted player if nearby; however, they are likely to be scared off when police officers arrive at the scene.\nA one-star wanted level can be acquired by committing any of the following deeds:\nDuring a one-star wanted level, the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Police Department&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; will deploy the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Interceptor\"&gt;Police Cruiser (Interceptor)&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County%20Sheriff\"&gt;Los Santos County Sheriff&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt; will do the same with the &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20Cruiser\"&gt;Sheriff Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;. The LSPD and Sheriff will both operate the &lt;a href=\"Predator\"&gt;Predator&lt;/a&gt; if the player swims or drives a boat into the ocean.\nTwo Stars.\nUnlike one-star wanted levels in \"GTA Online\", wanted levels consisting of two or more stars differ little from \"GTA V\". During pursuits, officers drive very aggressively; they may now attempt to ram the back of the player's vehicle with their own in hopes of sending the player spinning out of control. Pursuits are also relatively coordinated in comparison to previous \"GTA\" installments. Police cars may wait at the side of the road to \"ambush\" the player as they drive by, and officers may also attempt to blend into civilian traffic with their lights and sirens deactivated until the player draws near. At two stars, a minimum of three police cars will chase the player. Officers will also shoot from their vehicles if shots are fired from the player or if a weapon is pointed in their direction; doing this during a one-star wanted level will immediately raise the player's wanted level to two stars.\nA two-star wanted level can be acquired by committing the following crimes:\nVehicles: &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20Cruiser\"&gt;Sheriff Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Predator\"&gt;Police Predator&lt;/a&gt; (Water Only).\nThree Stars.\nAt three stars, the police widen their range of tactics to stop the player. They will set up &lt;a href=\"Police%20Roadblocks\"&gt;roadblocks&lt;/a&gt; with their police cars and &lt;a href=\"Police%20Transporter\"&gt;police transporters&lt;/a&gt;; roadblocks may also be accompanied by sets of &lt;a href=\"Spike%20Strip\"&gt;spike strips&lt;/a&gt; on the road nearby, which are deployed as means of deflating the player's tires. All non-NOOSE officers that spawn when three or more stars are attained wear bulletproof vests. Officers will now run up to the player if they are seated in a stationary or slow-moving vehicle, drag them out, and instantly &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; them with their equipped weapon. A &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; will also be called in to follow the player and provide visibility from the air; at night, it will shine a spotlight on the player to highlight his/her location to ground units. Each Maverick also contains a team of five &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; officers, two of whom ride aboard and attempt to gun down the player from the air with their &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt;s. A minimum of four police cars and a Police Maverick will be sent after the player at any given time; when passing a roadblock, however, nearby officers will get in their parked vehicles and join the pursuit. The Police Maverick will stay on duty until its fuel runs low, at which point it will return to base; however, another will spawn and replace it in short order.\nA three-star wanted level can be acquired by committing the following crimes:\nVehicles: &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Transporter\"&gt;Police Transporter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20Cruiser\"&gt;Sheriff Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Predator\"&gt;Police Predator&lt;/a&gt; (Water Only).\nFour Stars.\nAt a four-star wanted level, ground-based &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; teams will be sent to intercept the player. They arrive in &lt;a href=\"FIB%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;FIB Grangers&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20SUV\"&gt;Sheriff SUV&lt;/a&gt;s, depending on whether the perpetrator is in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt; respectively. Three officers ride aboard each vehicle: one agent drives, and the other two hang from the sides of the vehicle, giving them a wide and unobstructed shooting range. Up to three Police Mavericks may now become involved, although typically only two will be simultaneously deployed. When the officers aboard said helicopters cannot get a clear shot at their target, they will rappel out of the helicopter's side doors and engage the player on the ground. A Police Maverick will also attempt to land if there is enough room to do so, dispatching up to four NOOSE officers directly towards the player; the fifth will remain in the helicopter and fly back to base. Armored &lt;a href=\"Police%20Riot\"&gt;Police Riot&lt;/a&gt; vans will also spawn in blockades. At this wanted level, a minimum of five police ground vehicles and two police helicopters will be sent after the player at any given time. NOOSE officers (including normal officers) will perform &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by shooting&lt;/a&gt;s at the player regardless if no shots are fired from the player first.\nA four-star wanted level can be acquired by committing the following crimes:\nVehicles: &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Transporter\"&gt;Police Transporter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FIB%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;FIB Granger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20Cruiser\"&gt;Sheriff Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20SUV\"&gt;Sheriff SUV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Riot\"&gt;Police Riot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Predator\"&gt;Police Predator&lt;/a&gt; (Water Only).\nFive Stars.\nA continued pursuit will eventually give the player a five-star wanted level, the highest possible wanted level in the game. The streets will now be filled with police personnel and feature very little, if any, civilian traffic. Numerous police and NOOSE officers will hunt the player and set up multiple roadblocks simultaneously. At five stars, an indefinite number of police vehicles, as well as up to three Police Mavericks, will chase the player.\nA five-star wanted level can be acquired by committing the following crimes:\nVehicles: &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Transporter\"&gt;Police Transporter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FIB%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;FIB Granger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20Cruiser\"&gt;Sheriff Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20SUV\"&gt;Sheriff SUV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Riot\"&gt;Police Riot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Predator\"&gt;Police Predator&lt;/a&gt; (Water Only).\nIn Missions.\nAll wanted levels will be triggered by a unique crime in certain missions listed below.\n&lt;a href=\"Restricted%20Areas\"&gt;Restricted Areas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are several restricted areas in \"GTA Online\" that are off-limits to the protagonists and will automatically grant the player a wanted level should they trespass within. While inside any of these areas, the Lower Wanted Level cheat will not function, and the player will be unable to lose their heat unless they leave the area. Restricted areas include:\nMilitary.\nWhile the military will never be called in to pursue the player, military personnel may become involved in the chase if it occurs near &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt;. Typically this involves soldiers in &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;s, who will give chase to the player and attempt to arrest them in \"GTA Online\", although they will shoot the player if they resist arrest. On the base itself, military personnel will shoot to kill. Any patrolling &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; tanks will also become involved and may exit the base to join the pursuit if the player stays too close for too long, using their cannons to try and kill the player.\nIn-game instruction.\nIn the mission &lt;a href=\"Introduction_%28GTA_Online%29%23Los_Santos_Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Introduction%20%28GTA%20Online%29\"&gt;introduction&lt;/a&gt;, when the player gets a wanted level for the first time, the following instructions will appear:\nEscaping a Wanted Level.\nTo escape a wanted level, the player must stay out of sight of the police pursuers (in the \"cone search mode\") for a period of time (the length of time depends on the severity of the wanted level). When the wanted stars in the corner of the screen are flashing, it means the player is out of sight. The slower they are flashing, the closer the player is to escaping. If a police pursuer spots the player and the chase reverts to active mode, the escape timer will reset.\nEntering some interior locations will remove the wanted level, specifically locations that involve a \"fade to black\" load to an interior (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Nightclub\"&gt;Nightclub&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Arcades\"&gt;Arcades&lt;/a&gt;, apartments, garages). There are exceptions to this, as entering one's &lt;a href=\"Terrorbyte\"&gt;Terrorbyte&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt; will not remove the wanted level, and police will proceed to attack the vehicle. \nThe player is able to call &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; after achieving &lt;a href=\"rank\"&gt;rank&lt;/a&gt; 21 to immediately remove the wanted level for a fee of $200 per star. If the player completes &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Heist\"&gt;The Doomsday Heist&lt;/a&gt;, Lester will remove the player's wanted level for free, if called.\nIf the player is flying an &lt;a href=\"Akula\"&gt;Akula&lt;/a&gt; while having a wanted level of 3 or more stars, activating its stealth mode will reduce the wanted level to 2 stars, thus making it easier for the player to lose the remaining stars.\nThe player can reduce their wanted level by one star by changing their appearance - this can be done by putting on or taking off a mask or sunglasses while the search is in \"search cone\" mode. This will mean they have less time to wait out the search.\nFailure to escape will result in the player either being &lt;a href=\"Busted\"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt;. If the player is within a block radius of their &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicle\"&gt;Personal Vehicle&lt;/a&gt;, their vehicle will be &lt;a href=\"Impound%20Garage\"&gt;impounded&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsing the railway system is perhaps the easiest way to escape because the police have a hard time following the player on rail. They will not drive on the tracks and will only follow on foot into railway tunnels (where they can be sniped before they trigger detection).\nFor each star that the player successfully evades (not removes), they will receive 100 &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;RP&lt;/a&gt;, so evading five stars rewards 500 RP.\nAchievements/Trophies.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\" shares achievements and trophies related to Wanted Level with \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nSoundtracks.\nMany different scores can play during wanted levels, most of them originally from \"Grand Theft Auto V\", with growing intensity as wanted stars are gained. These soundtracks will begin to play shortly after obtaining at least 3 wanted stars, and will play when on foot or in a vehicle without the radio on. These soundtracks only play when Music Volume is active. Some soundtracks are specific to area; wanted soundtracks in Blaine County differ from those in Los Santos County.\nThe soundtracks have several phases, including the cooldown zone, and each soundtrack has special stems which play when the player is hidden or losing their wanted level. A special sound effect also plays when the player loses their wanted level.\nWanted level soundtracks overrule the flying soundtrack, which plays while in an aircraft, but do not overrule mission soundtracks.\nThe wanted level soundtracks, like regular mission soundtracks or radio music, do not play in the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Editor\"&gt;Rockstar Editor&lt;/a&gt;. Wanted level tracks do not play in &lt;a href=\"Director%20Mode\"&gt;Director Mode&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "91938", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=91938", "title": "Wanted Level in GTA V", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level\"&gt;Wanted Level&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" is a measure to determine how much the &lt;a href=\"Protagonist\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; is wanted by the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Police Department&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County%20Sheriff\"&gt;Los Santos County Sheriff&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tactical%20Response%20Unit\"&gt;TRU&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike many previous games in the series, \"Grand Theft Auto V\" features a five-star scale rather than six.\nDescription.\nIn contrast with police in previous installments, police officers in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" are much more aggressive and persistent when it comes to chasing after the perpetrator. Like other NPCs in the game, the police AI is noticeably much more intelligent; police officers are more capable of avoiding obstacles. They will also now use a wider range of methods to &lt;a href=\"Busted\"&gt;apprehend&lt;/a&gt; the player; examples include the and attempting to corner and \"box in\" the player's vehicle. When chasing after the player in a vehicle, police officers tend to ram the back end of the player's car, which may send it spinning out of control. Like in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", any officer will also commandeer civilian vehicles to continue a pursuit if their own police vehicle is destroyed or becomes inaccessible. Also similar to \"GTA IV\" is the ability for police to respond to crimes committed out of their sight, as civilians can call the police on their &lt;a href=\"Cell%20Phone\"&gt;cell phones&lt;/a&gt; to report crimes. While having a Wanted Level, players are not able to switch between the three protagonists (except during several &lt;a href=\"Missions%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt;).\nPolice now search for the player in the same style as in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\". No search radius is deployed; instead, the police will search across the entire map. Each individual officer has a field of view, and will actively pursue the player if they enter the field. This makes it notoriously difficult when avoiding officers in &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; helicopters, as their field of view is significantly larger than a four-star search radius in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nWanted Levels.\nOne Star.\nAt a one-star wanted level, the player is considered to have committed a \"minor\" crime. The police or the army (if near &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt;) will chase the player and attempt to &lt;a href=\"Busted\"&gt;arrest&lt;/a&gt; them by holding the character at gunpoint. The player can resist arrest by fighting back or by simply running/driving away, at the cost of immediately raising the wanted level to two stars. Police cars will follow the player, but officers on &lt;a href=\"Police%20Bike\"&gt;Police Bikes&lt;/a&gt; will immediately open fire. If the player climbs a ladder, cops or soldiers will climb up as well. There will be a minimum of one police car chasing the player at this wanted level, but more cops can initially join if the player is nearby when attaining the first star. If the player enters a body of water, officers will open fire on the player. Just like in former games, officers or soldiers are able to pull the protagonist out of a stationary or slow-moving vehicle and bust them immediately.\nA one-star wanted level can be acquired by committing the following deeds:\nDuring a one-star wanted level, the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; will utilize the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Interceptor\"&gt;Police Cruiser (Interceptor)&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County%20Sheriff\"&gt;LSCS&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt; will utilize the &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20Cruiser\"&gt;Sheriff Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;. The LSPD and the sheriff will operate the &lt;a href=\"Predator\"&gt;Predator&lt;/a&gt; if the player swims or drives a boat into the ocean. Military will utilize the &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt; if near &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo Stars.\nAt a two-star wanted level, police become more aggressive and they will now shoot to kill. During pursuits, officers actively chase the player at full speed and drive much more aggressively, now attempting to ram the player off the road. Pursuits are also far more coordinated; police cars may now wait at the side of the road to \"ambush\" the player as they drive by, or blending into civilian traffic with their lights and sirens deactivated until the player draws near. Police will not attempt a vehicular arrest unless a pursuit has lasted for approximately one minute without hurting any cop and the player stops their vehicle. At two stars, a minimum of 3 police cars will be chasing the player. Officers will only shoot from their police vehicles if shots are fired from the player or if a weapon is pointed in their direction.\nA two-star wanted level can be acquired by committing the following crimes:\nVehicles: &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20Cruiser\"&gt;Sheriff Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Predator\"&gt;Police Predator&lt;/a&gt; (Water Only), &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt; (Near &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt;)\nThree Stars.\nAt three stars, the police widen their range of tactics to stop the player. They will set up &lt;a href=\"Police%20Roadblocks\"&gt;roadblocks&lt;/a&gt; with their police cars and &lt;a href=\"Police%20Transporter\"&gt;police transporters&lt;/a&gt;, which may also set out a &lt;a href=\"Spike%20Strip\"&gt;spike strip&lt;/a&gt; on the road behind them. All officers that spawn when three or more stars are attained will be wearing bulletproof vests. Officers will run up to the player if they are stationary in a vehicle, drag them out, and instantly &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; them with their weapon. A &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; helicopter will be called in to shadow the player and provide air support in the form of &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tactical%20Response%20Unit\"&gt;TRU&lt;/a&gt; officers that ride on board. At night, the helicopter will shine a spotlight on the player to highlight their location to ground units. Police will not attempt a vehicular arrest, unless a pursuit has lasted for approximately one minute without hurting any cop and the player stops their vehicle; however, the police AI will likely kill the player by mindlessly shooting them instead. A minimum of four police cars and a police helicopter will be sent after the player at any given time, but when passing a roadblock, officers may get in their vehicles in order to join the chase. The Police helicopter will always stay on station until all riflemen on board are killed, at which point it will return to base; however, it will be replaced by another in short order. \nA three-star wanted level can be acquired by committing the following crimes:\nVehicles: &lt;a href=\"Interceptor\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Transporter\"&gt;Police Transporter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20Cruiser\"&gt;Sheriff Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Predator\"&gt;Police Predator&lt;/a&gt; (Water Only), &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt; (Near &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt;)\nFour Stars.\nAt a four-star wanted level, NOOSE TRU teams will be sent to eliminate the player. They will arrive in &lt;a href=\"FIB%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;FIB Grangers&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20SUV\"&gt;Sheriff SUV&lt;/a&gt;s, depending on whether they are in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;. Each vehicle contains three NOOSE TRU officers - one driving, and other two hanging on the sides as they fire their weapons at the player. NOOSE TRU will also try to gun the player down from &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;s overhead with their &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;Carbine Rifle&lt;/a&gt;s; up to three Police Mavericks may now become involved, although only two will be typically deployed at any one time. If the player is in an open spot, they may rappel out of the helicopter and engage the player on the ground. On rare occasions, a Police Maverick will also attempt to land if there is enough room to do so, deploying a team of four NOOSE TRU officers directly towards the player. Armored NOOSE TRU &lt;a href=\"Police%20Riot\"&gt;riot vans&lt;/a&gt; will also be deployed to set up roadblocks. Police will not attempt a vehicular arrest unless a pursuit has lasted for approximately one minute without hurting any cop and the player stops their vehicle. At this wanted level, a minimum of five police and military ground vehicles and two police helicopters will be sent after the player at any given time, though officers in roadblocks will also get in their cars and chase the player. Unlike a three-star wanted level, police (mainly NOOSE TRU and soldiers) will now actively shoot the player from inside their vehicles, even if no shots are fired from the player first. Like NOOSE TRU officers, normal police officers will now begin to fire at the player from their vehicles (however, on the PS3/Xbox 360 versions, they will only open fire when shot at first).\nA four-star wanted level can be acquired by committing the following crimes:\nVehicles: &lt;a href=\"Interceptor\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Transporter\"&gt;Police Transporter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FIB%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;FIB Granger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20Cruiser\"&gt;Sheriff Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20SUV\"&gt;Sheriff SUV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Riot\"&gt;Police Riot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Predator\"&gt;Police Predator&lt;/a&gt; (Water Only), &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt; (Fort Zancudo)\nFive Stars.\nA continued pursuit with four stars will eventually give the player a five-star wanted level, the highest wanted level in the game. The streets will now be filled with police personnel and feature almost no, if any, civilian traffic; numerous police cars and NOOSE TRU vehicles will hunt for the player and set up multiple roadblocks at a time. At five stars, an indefinite number of police and military vehicles, as well as up to three Police Mavericks, will be chasing the player, although usually only two will be deployed at any one time. Police or military will not attempt a vehicular arrest unless a pursuit has lasted for approximately one minute without hurting any cop or soldier and the player stops their vehicle. A significantly higher proportion of NOOSE TRU units will be involved when compared to four stars.\nA five-star wanted level can be acquired by committing the following crimes:\nVehicles: &lt;a href=\"Interceptor\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Transporter\"&gt;Police Transporter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FIB%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;FIB Granger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20Cruiser\"&gt;Sheriff Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20SUV\"&gt;Sheriff SUV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Riot\"&gt;Police Riot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Predator\"&gt;Police Predator&lt;/a&gt; (Water Only), &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt; (Fort Zancudo), &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; (If in Fort Zancudo)\nIn Missions.\nAll wanted levels will be triggered by a unique crime in certain missions listed below.\n&lt;a href=\"Restricted%20Areas\"&gt;Restricted Areas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are several restricted areas in \"GTA V\" that are off-limits to the protagonists and will automatically grant the player a wanted level should they trespass within. While inside any of these areas, the Lower Wanted Level &lt;a href=\"Cheats%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;cheat&lt;/a&gt; will not function, and the player will be unable to lose their heat unless they leave the area. Restricted areas include:\nMilitary.\nWhile the military will never be called in to pursue the player, military personnel may become involved in the chase if it occurs near &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt;. Typically this involves soldiers in &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt;, who will give chase to the player and attempt to arrest them in \"GTA V\", although they will shoot the player if they resist arrest. On the base itself, military personnel will shoot to kill. If an aircraft is hijacked in base or the player is flying one of them, any soldiers will fire a &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt; at the aircraft. Any patrolling &lt;a href=\"Rhino\"&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt; tanks will also become involved and may exit the base to join the pursuit if the player stays too close for too long, using their cannons to try and quickly kill the player.\nIn-game instruction.\nIn the mission &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20and%20Lamar\"&gt;Franklin and Lamar&lt;/a&gt;, when the player gets a wanted level for the first time, the following instructions will appear:\nEscaping a Wanted Level.\nTo escape a wanted level, the player must stay out of sight of the police pursuers (in the \"cone search mode\") for a period of time (the length of time depends on the severity of the wanted level). When the wanted stars in the corner of the screen are flashing, it means the player is out of sight. The slower they are flashing, the closer the player is to escaping. If a police pursuer spots the player and the chase reverts to active mode, the escape timer will reset.\nThe player can reduce their wanted level by one star by changing their appearance - this can be done by putting on or taking off a mask or sunglasses while the search is in \"search cone\" mode. This will mean they have less time to wait out the search.\nFailure to escape will result in the player either being &lt;a href=\"Busted\"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt;. If the player is within a block radius of their &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicle\"&gt;Personal Vehicle&lt;/a&gt;, their vehicle will be &lt;a href=\"Impound%20Garage\"&gt;impounded&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsing the railway system is perhaps the easiest way to escape because the police have a hard time following the player on rail. They will not drive on the tracks and will only follow on foot into railway tunnels (where they can be sniped before they trigger detection).\nSoundtracks.\nMany different scores, at random, can play during wanted levels, with growing intensity as wanted stars are gained. These soundtracks will begin to play shortly after obtaining at least 3 wanted stars, and will play when on foot or in a vehicle without the radio on. These soundtracks only play when Music Volume is active. Some soundtracks are specific to the area; wanted soundtracks in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt; differ from those in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County\"&gt;Los Santos County&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe soundtracks have several phases, including the cooldown zone, and each soundtrack has special stems which play when the player is hidden or losing their wanted level. A special sound effect also plays when the player loses their wanted level.\nWanted level soundtracks overrule the flying soundtrack, which plays while in an aircraft, but do not overrule mission soundtracks.\nThe wanted level soundtracks, like regular mission soundtracks or radio music, do not play in the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Editor\"&gt;Rockstar Editor&lt;/a&gt;. Wanted level tracks also do not play in &lt;a href=\"Director%20Mode\"&gt;Director Mode&lt;/a&gt;."}

Huang was invited by his uncle, Wu \"Kenny\" Lee, to Liberty City, to help deliver a family 'heirloom', the Yu Jian Sword, and secure the family's claim to the leadership of the Liberty City Triads. In reality, Kenny planned to give away the sword to Hsin Jaoming in exchange for Hsin's approval as the next leader.\nHowever, as soon as Huang arrives at the &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Aiport&lt;/a&gt;, he is attacked by a group of &lt;a href=\"North%20Korea\"&gt;North Korean&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wonsu%20Nodong\"&gt;assassins&lt;/a&gt;, who shoots him unconscious, steals his sword and dumps him in the &lt;a href=\"Humboldt%20River\"&gt;Humboldt River&lt;/a&gt; assuming he was dead. Huang manages to escape the car before it hits the sea floor and drives to Kenny's restaurant &lt;a href=\"Sum%20Yung%20Gai\"&gt;Sum Yung Gai&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cerveza%20Heights\"&gt;Cerveza Heights&lt;/a&gt; to give him the bad news.\nAfter informing Hsin about the incident, Kenny has been dishonored by the sword's loss, leaving Huang and Kenny to work to keep their business afloat. With Kenny out of the race to succeed Hsin after he retires, Chan and Zhou are the only Triad bosses disputing the leadership of the Triads.\nWorking for Chan and Zhou.\nChan Jaoming, Hsin's incompetent son and the first in the line of succession.

However, it causes the Irish gang to &lt;a href=\"Jackin%27%20Chan\"&gt;kidnap Chan&lt;/a&gt; after discovering he cheated on the race, but Huang manages to save him. Instead of thanking him for saving his life, Chan blames Huang for his own incompetence.\nInvestigating the Spanish Lords.\nKenny acquires a &lt;a href=\"Kenny%27s%20Warehouse\"&gt;warehouse&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"East%20Island%20City\"&gt;East Island City&lt;/a&gt; with the Huang's &lt;a href=\"Drug%20Dealing\"&gt;drug dealing&lt;/a&gt; profits. They use the warehouse as a base of operations while investigating the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Lords\"&gt;Spanish Lords&lt;/a&gt; for a clue about the Yu Jian Sword, as a renowed art dealer is affiliated to them and might have been interested in the item.\nWonsu Nodong.\nChan sets up a deal with the Spanish Lords, a gang who has been enemies of the Triads for years, in order to impress the Tongs. While driving to the meeting place, Chan is &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Deal\"&gt;ambushed by the Spanish Lords&lt;/a&gt;, but is saved once again by Huang and taken to Hsin's &lt;a href=\"Linen%20Lounge\"&gt;Linen Lounge&lt;/a&gt; club safely.\nShortly after dropping Chan off at Linen Lounge, a &lt;a href=\"Heston%20Squad\"&gt;police squad&lt;/a&gt; corners at the club. But the leader, &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Heston\"&gt;Wade Heston&lt;/a&gt;, who is actually an undercover cop, says that he's trying to help Huang recover the Yu Jian sword and avenge Huang's father. Heston has been in search for the Wonsu Nodong boss for a while, and wants to solve this case in order to clear things with the Internal Affairs.\nWhile working with Heston, they find out that the Yu Jian sword was stolen by the boss of the &lt;a href=\"Wonsu%20Nodong\"&gt;Wonsu Nodong&lt;/a&gt;, a inner circle within the Korean &lt;a href=\"Midtown%20Gangsters\"&gt;Midtown Gangsters&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;.\nChan Jaoming's Arrest.\nAfter acquiring one of Kenny's territories, Chan invites Huang to celebrate the acquisition by &lt;a href=\"Sa-Boat-Age\"&gt;racing Huang in his new speedboat&lt;/a&gt;, that he acquired from the Spanish Lords. Shortly after, Chan's boat starts to smoke and he slows down. It is revealed that the Spanish Lords sabotaged it to attack and kill Chan. So until help arrives, Huang protects Chan from the attacking gang members.\nA &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; arrives and picks up Chan. Soon after, it is revealed through e-mails that Chan has been arrested.\nHowever, Chan is released after a while, which leads Zhou and Huang to suspect that he's been talking inside.\nInvestigating Zhou Ming and his Triad gang.\nAfter hearing about Chan being quickly released, Kenny tells Huang to watch out for Chan or Zhou, as he suspects that they might be informants. Shortly after, Zhou messages Huang telling him to meet him at his residence at &lt;a href=\"The%20Hotel%20on%20Luddite%20East\"&gt;The Hotel on Luddite East&lt;/a&gt;.\nZhou masterminds a &lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20Liberty\"&gt;Bank of Liberty&lt;/a&gt; robbery in Chinatown, which was &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Haul%20Z\"&gt;covered up by the Chinese festivities&lt;/a&gt; occurring at the same time in the neighborhood. Unlike the &lt;a href=\"McReary%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;gangsters&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Leaf%20Clover\"&gt;previous bank robbery in Chinatown&lt;/a&gt;, Zhou and his Triad gang managed to successfully escape wihtout being identified or being pursued by the law.\nSoon after, Heston e-mails Huang about a &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Heston%27s%20FIB%20Contact\"&gt;FIB contact&lt;/a&gt; of his who will give a file revealing the Triad rat's identity if they help him with a job - &lt;a href=\"Torpedo%20Run\"&gt;sinking Zhou Ming's contraband boat&lt;/a&gt;. Huang manages to do that using a stolen &lt;a href=\"Destroyer\"&gt;police boat&lt;/a&gt;, as well as killing any Triad who witnessed the attack before they warn Zhou.\nZhou eventually asks Huang to &lt;a href=\"So%20Near%2C%20Yet%20Sonar\"&gt;retrieve the sunken cargo using a sonar&lt;/a&gt; and deliver to his &lt;a href=\"RS%20Haul%20Depot%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Triad-owned warehouse&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Fishmarket%20North\"&gt;Fishmarket North&lt;/a&gt;, not knowing he was the one who sank his contraband. \nJaoming Family Triad Rats.\nHsin informs Huang that Chan was released from prison and now is under bail conditions. He discovered that one of the members of Chan's entourage is a FIB informant and a key witness against Chan. He orders Huang to go &lt;a href=\"One%20Shot%2C%20One%20Kill\"&gt;assassinate the informant&lt;/a&gt;, but to do it from a safe distance to not compromise the Triads. He assassinates the informant outside the &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Gardens%20Hotel\"&gt;Castle Gardens Hotel&lt;/a&gt; using a &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;sniper rifle&lt;/a&gt;.\nHuang meets Chan again on the roof of the &lt;a href=\"Videogeddon\"&gt;Videogeddon&lt;/a&gt; arcade roof, where he informs him about the informant he killed earlier. Chan is aware of the fact and says that his entourage are all rats and deserve to die, and arranges for all his entourage to meet him on &lt;a href=\"Happiness%20Island\"&gt;Happiness Island&lt;/a&gt;. Arriving at the island, Huang &lt;a href=\"Slaying%20With%20Fire\"&gt;burns down several of Chan's own entourage alive&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Molotov%20Cocktails\"&gt;Molotov Cocktails&lt;/a&gt;.\nInvestigating the Midtown Gangsters.\nUnder orders of Hsin, Huang &lt;a href=\"A%20Shadow%20of%20Doubt\"&gt;tracks down&lt;/a&gt; the Midtown Gangsters &lt;a href=\"Midtown%20Gangsters%20Safehouse\"&gt;safehouse&lt;/a&gt; in order to find out if they are still truly loyal to the Triads and confirm his suspicions about Huang being the Triad rat.\nThe Jaoming Family Triad eventually &lt;a href=\"Friend%20or%20Foe%3F\"&gt;raids their safehouse and steal their files&lt;/a&gt;, although none of the files mentions Huang, much to Hsin's disapointment. However, two Triad traitors are mentioned in the files, which Hsin orders Huang to &lt;a href=\"By%20Myriads%20of%20Swords\"&gt;behead both of them using a sword&lt;/a&gt; and deliver their IDs to Hsin as proof of their deaths.\nInvestigating the Angels of Death.\nAfter the attack on the Triad traitors, Hsin sends an e-mail to Huang asking him to help an associate private investigator of his, &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Leroc\"&gt;Lester Leroc&lt;/a&gt;, to infiltrate the &lt;a href=\"Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt;, a biker gang which the Jaoming Family supplies with drugs, in order to investigate the gang and find a possible informant there.\nHuang helps Lester &lt;a href=\"Double%20Trouble\"&gt;pass the initiation&lt;/a&gt; of the Angels of Death, by killing several &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; bikers while posing as Lester. During the investigation, he eventually has an affair with &lt;a href=\"Meredith\"&gt;Meredith&lt;/a&gt;, the girlfriend of the biker gang's leader &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Arnold\"&gt;Arnie&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the bikers eventually finds out and attempts to kill Lester, but he is protected by Huang while trying to get information from Meredith. The investigation ends up with no FIB informants found within the Angels of Death.\nInvestigating the Messina Crime Family.\nAt this point, an Italian mobster &lt;a href=\"Rudy%20D%27Avanzo\"&gt;Rudy D'Avanzo&lt;/a&gt; suddenly contacts Huang, claiming the true informant is &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Capra\"&gt;Jimmy Capra&lt;/a&gt;, a made man of the &lt;a href=\"Messina%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Messina Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, one of the five Mafia families in Liberty City who has a truce with the Triads. Rudy tells Huang to steal Capra's car from a &lt;a href=\"Messina%27s%20Compound\"&gt;Messina-owned parking lot&lt;/a&gt; in Bohan so he can put a recorder inside in order to investigate Capra.\nSoon after, Rudy claims he has a recording of Capra talking to the feds. He asks Huang for other favors in exchange of a copy of that recording - &lt;a href=\"The%20World%27s%20a%20Stooge\"&gt;kill several of Capra's men&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oversights\"&gt;helping him kill Capra during a \"peace talk\"&lt;/a&gt;. However, the meeting with Jimmy Capra ends up being an ambush to kill Rudy. Both Capra and Rudy escapes alive during the ambush, with several Messina mobsters killed by Huang.\nThis causes the end of the truce between the Messinas and the Triads. After informing Hsin about Rudy's recording proving that Capra is a fed rat, Huang finds out that he has been tricked by D'Avanzo, and is &lt;a href=\"A%20Rude%20Awakening\"&gt;ordered by Hsin to kill him&lt;/a&gt;.\nTriad Rat's Identity and Hsin's Retirement.\nAfter getting rid of Rudy, Wade Heston tells Huang that his FIB contact has the Triad rat's ID on a encrypted file on the FIB mainframe, and can still be acquired by &lt;a href=\"Wi-Find\"&gt;hacking the network and taking the file&lt;/a&gt;. After downloading and decoding the file, it reveals that both Chan and Zhou are listed as fed rats, who have been ratting out Hsin and each other to the feds. Huang realizes that one of them must be the Wonsu Nodong boss and his father's killer.\nHuang and Kenny &lt;a href=\"Rat%20Race\"&gt;delivers the file to Hsin&lt;/a&gt;, who is devastated by their betrayal and decides to turn Kenny into the new head of the Triads. Kenny's first decision as the new boss of the Triads is to get rid of Chan and Zhou.\nHuang &lt;a href=\"Hit%20from%20the%20Tong\"&gt;eliminates Zhou Ming and his Triad gang&lt;/a&gt; in a construction site in Castle Gardens. Kenny sends some of his men to help Huang &lt;a href=\"Clear%20the%20Pier\"&gt;take down Chan Joaming and his bodyguards&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"East%20Hook\"&gt;East Hook&lt;/a&gt;.\nTruth Revealed.\nAfter killing Zhou and Chan for Kenny, Heston contacts Huang saying that he found out that the file was fake all along. His FIB contact works for the true Triad rat, who is also the Wonsu boss.\nHuang and Heston drives to Charge Island where the FIB contact is &lt;a href=\"Salt%20in%20the%20Wound\"&gt;meeting the Wonsu boss&lt;/a&gt;, who is revealed to be Kenny - all of the previous \"legally sensitive jobs\" given by the FIB contact were Kenny's orders to disrupt the other Triad families so he could move up.\nAfter discovering that Kenny had the Yu Jian sword all along and being the Wonsu boss and the Triad's FIB informant at the same time, a massive shootout happens between Huang and the Triads at the desalinization plant. Kenny manages to escape to Hsin's &lt;a href=\"Hsin%20Jaoming%27s%20Penthouse\"&gt;penthouse&lt;/a&gt; in the border of Chinatown, where he blames Hsin for everything - also revealing that Hsin is indirectly responsable for the death of Huang's father and the sword theft.\nAs soon as Huang and Heston arrives at the penthouse, Kenny stabs Hsin with the Yu Jian, but survives the injuries. Huang kills his uncle Kenny to avenge his father's death, leaving no Triad bosses alive or possible known successors for the Triad's leadership. Shortly before being arrested by Heston, Hsin suggests Huang to be the new leader, but he does not respond. The fate of the Triads leadership is unknown after Kenny's death."}

Prior to \"GTA San Andreas\", specifically in \"&lt;a href=\"Clothing%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City\"&gt;GTA Vice City&lt;/a&gt;\", clothing pickups were scattered all over the city, as opposed to being available in one spot.\nDescription.\n\"GTA San Andreas\".\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", wardrobes are contained only within safehouses, and appear as a separate room with a yellow entrance icon (the same showing up on the exterior doors of accessible buildings). Upon entering the room, the player must walk into the red destination icon, which causes &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; to enter a walk-in closet. Once inside, &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt; options will become available, including adding and removing items. The only clothing options available are the clothes Carl is wearing at the beginning of the game, any items the player purchases from clothing retailers, and special outfits the player unlocks as the story progresses. Changing clothes allows the player to evade a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. Clothes can be changed back immediately afterward without reinstating the wanted level. In the console versions, committing suicide in the wardrobe will respawn the player at the hospital in Los Santos, regardless of where the wardrobe is.\nIf the player removes clothing in the wardrobe, it does not deduct the stats for the clothing, so they can remove an item, put it on, remove it again, etc. and pad the sex appeal as high as they'd like.\n\"GTA Liberty City Stories\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\".\nThe wardrobe system in both \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\" is significantly simplified to support preset outfits. Wardrobes are typically identifiable by spinning clothing pickups (whose design is carried over from \"GTA Vice City\") situated in front of non-interactive closets; once the player is in contact with the pickup, they enter a clothes selection interface where they can cycle through the available outfits and select any of them to wear.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe wardrobe system in \"GTA IV\" is a direct decedent of the wardrobe systems implemented in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\". As opposed to simply cycling through preset attires, the wardrobe in \"GTA IV\" allows the player to cycle through available &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;tops, pants, footwear, glasses and headgears&lt;/a&gt; (the left and right commands cycle through the available clothing within the category, while up or down commands cycle between clothing categories), before settling with any desired combination.\nThe wardrobe system in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\" is more alike those in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\", only allowing the player to cycle between preset outfits.\nIn both \"GTA IV\" and \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", access to the wardrobe is identifiable by a yellow marker (similar used to represent contact points for missions) inside the safehouse, which will only be activated once the player stands in the marker and accepts to enter the wardrobe interface.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nApproaching the wardrobe of a &lt;a href=\"Safehouses%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;safehouse&lt;/a&gt; will prompt the player to press a command in order to check clothing options. The wardrobe divides articles of clothing into separate categories. Once a category is the chosen the player can preview the clothing and decide on whether or not to wear said clothing."}

{"id": "164628", "revid": "43760701", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=164628", "title": "Warehouses", "text": "Warehouses are purchasable properties featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" added as part of the update. They are available to buy once the player registers as a CEO and buys an &lt;a href=\"Office\"&gt;Office&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nWarehouses are used to safely store Special Cargo acquired by the player during Buy missons ordered from the CEO via the executive terminal in their office. There are three different types of Warehouses: small, medium and large. Small Warehouses can store a total of 16 crates, medium Warehouses can store 42 crates, and large Warehouses can store 111 crates. The maximum amount of Warehouses a player can purchase is five.\nBuying a certain size of warehouse for the first time will also unlock a vehicle in the Organization Vehicle list with a request fee, or for free if the player owns one:\nGetting Started.\nIn order to start buying and selling contraband via the Special Cargo Network, the player must buy an Office, and then enter the Office and access the executive terminal in a public session. After doing so, the player must buy a Warehouse. Once the player has a Warehouse, they are able to initiate Buy and Sell missions. Initiating buy missions cost a certain amount of money based on how many crates the player wants to collect in one mission. This varies from $2,000 for one crate, $8,000 for two crates, and $18,000 for three crates.\nFor vehicle missions getting the vehicle is as simple as clicking the green \"Source Vehicle\" button which will find a vehicle for the player to retrieve.\nAfter the player delivers crates to the warehouse, they must decide when to sell. The longer the warehouse sits with crates in it, the more likely it is to be attacked by a gang of NPCs. However, the player gets more profit when they sell more crates at one point in time. There is a short cool down on Buy missions, so doing them for three crates is recommended but isn't the best option at a financial standpoint, as it takes away from the profit from the sale price. The best way to relieve this is to do &lt;a href=\"VIP%20Work\"&gt;VIP Work&lt;/a&gt; in between, specifically &lt;a href=\"Sightseer\"&gt;Sightseer&lt;/a&gt;, where $24,000 is common and represents the lowest chance of dying in an empty lobby. This can increase your overall profit and make up for the decrease.\nLayout.\nThe layout of a Warehouse's interior depends on the size of the Warehouse that has been purchased. Small Warehouses only have one row of platforms to hold cargo, with the rest being left on the floor. In the medium-sized Warehouses, three rows of platforms are present to hold the cargo. The large Warehouses have four rows, but the platforms are much taller than the ones found in the small or medium Warehouses.\nDaily Fees.\nEach warehouse size category has a different daily fee, namely being $50 per day for small, $100 per day for medium, and $200 for large. With up to five different warehouses available to the player, one could choose to buy a single small one, five large ones or a mix of any size in-between to create a combined daily fee that is manageable for their personal playstyle or preference.\nStaff.\nWith effect from &lt;a href=\"The%20Criminal%20Enterprises\"&gt;The Criminal Enterprises&lt;/a&gt; update, each warehouse is staffed. The player's first warehouse is staffed by &lt;a href=\"Lupe\"&gt;Lupe&lt;/a&gt; and each of the other four warehouses are occupied by unnamed &lt;a href=\"Warehouse%20Staff\"&gt;Warehouse Staff&lt;/a&gt;.\nBuy Missions.\nBuy missions are the missions the player does to get crates. Buy missions have a cool down on them, so doing the mission that gets the player the most amount of crates, three, is recommended. Buy missions are initiated in the player's office at the Securoserv terminal. An important thing to note is that a player can only pick up one crate, meaning they can't pick up two crates at the same time. However, one person can deliver a crate and then go back to grab another one until all the crates are gone. Buy missions must take place in a public session, so it is recommended to find a small session or make sure no one is going to try and destroy the crates or kill the player.\nNote: Having more than one warehouse is one method of bypassing the cooldown timer on buy missions.\nBuying 1 crate at a time is more cost effective than 3 crates at a time, though 3 crates is more time effective. 1 crate = $2,000, 2 crates = $8,000 ($4,000 per crate), 3 crates = $18,000 ($6,000 per crate)\nA Large WH takes 37 three crate missions to fill costing $666,000 and sells for $2,220,000 (or $1,554,000 total profit) at $42,000 profit per buy mission. A Large WH takes 111 single crate missions to fill costing $222,000 and sells for $2,220,000 (or $1,998,000 total profit) at $18,000 profit per buy mission. Meaning you make roughly 28% more money total profit but spend 3x longer to make it, though the more crates you purchase at once generally the harder the retrieval mission is and the larger the risk you take. Still at a profit margin of 18k per mission one could make more money with no risk at all by simply doing VIP missions instead.\nAfter The Criminal Enterprises update, players can also send their warehouse staff member to source random cargo for $7,500 each trip.\nSelling Cargo.\nOnce the player has obtained at least 1 item of special cargo, the player can sell it by using a laptop connected to the &lt;a href=\"Ad-Hawk\"&gt;Ad-Hawk&lt;/a&gt; website located on a table near the warehouse's entrance. The CEO will sell the crates using one of three different approaches \u2014 by air, using either a &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20800\"&gt;Cuban 800&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; (dependent on the volume of stock being sold), by sea, using a &lt;a href=\"Tug%20Boat\"&gt;Tug Boat&lt;/a&gt;, or by land, using from one to three &lt;a href=\"Brickade\"&gt;Brickade&lt;/a&gt;s (again dependent on the volume of stock being sold). The more crates being sold, the more players are required to help sell the cargo.\nSelling a full warehouse has the benefit of earning more money per crate than selling an otherwise not full warehouse, but full warehouses comes with a risk of being raided by NPCs which causes crates to be lost. Also in lobbies with more people a percentage bonus is added for the risk over otherwise empty lobbies. Having more associates also gives extra bonus profit compared to selling stock solo with no associates.\nSmall 16/16 is $240,000 for $15,000 per crate.\nMedium 42/42 is $735,000 for $17,500 per crate.\nLarge 111/111 is $2,220,000 for $20,000 per crate.\nThe special item sells 5x of its costs, and unlike the normal products, the special items will not increase the value as the item number increases.\nAssociates do not currently get a share of this profit, instead they earn money on a time basis similar to VIP missions. Every time associates help to retrieve crates their pay is raised by $500, starting at $5,000 and maxing out at $10,000 every interval. They also get paid this amount after helping complete a delivery mission.\nSell missions involving aircraft can have a player as the copilot using the jammer that will detour incoming missiles.\nDelivery Vehicle Upgrades.\nUpon starting the \"Selling Cargo\" mission from a warehouse, the player have the option to upgrade all the vehicle's attributes to a certain extent using the blueprints in the warehouse. The following upgrades are:\nThe total amount of money for every upgrade is $1,250,000.\nRaids.\nYour warehouse may occasionally be raided by NPCs. The raid mission types are Warehouse Assault and Recover Warehouse's content.\nExport Mixed Goods.\nWith update, players who own at least 1 Warehouse and have sourced special cargo via &lt;a href=\"Lupe\"&gt;Lupe&lt;/a&gt; or other &lt;a href=\"Warehouse%20Staff\"&gt;Warehouse Staff&lt;/a&gt; at least once are able to start an Export Mixed Goods mission, by speaking to the &lt;a href=\"Assistant\"&gt;Assistant&lt;/a&gt; at the Office. Export Mixed Goods is an independent mission from Special Cargo business; it is not necessary for the player to actively source cargo, send staff to source cargo, or stockpile cargo in their Warehouse(s) in order for Export Mixed Goods to be available. Each Mixed Goods delivery rewards the player with $50,000."}

The Warrener is heavily based on the Japanese designs of the , (Bluebird), and the first year of the . It also seems to draw some inspiration from the 1960's-70's . The car's front fascia is a heavy mix of those from the and Nissan Skyline C10. The chassis brings a mixed resemblance from the Datsun 510 and , while the sideview mirror placement bears resemblance from the , and as well as the headlamps taking cues from the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//i.pinimg.com/originals/a3/e8/58/a3e8589b5327a0bc775e8adf22983599.jpg\"&gt;pre-facelift&lt;/a&gt; .\nDesign.\nThe Warrener assumes a traditional sedan layout with a somewhat sporty appearance, where the front features a chrome bumper with two plastic vertical sections and a central license plate, while the upper area features dual open vents and a chrome detail surrounding the black grille and the headlamps. The grille has a smaller chrome surrounding and bears the Vulcar logo on the centre and a \"2600lx\" badge on the lower driver-side corner, while the headlamp housings are finished in chrome and have dual circular main lamps. The bonnet has impressed areas starting from above the grille and lead towards the small vents near the windscreen, which opens to reveal the engine bay and a strut brace over it.\nOn the sides, the car has flared wheel arches and chrome horizontal door handles, as well as black mirror shells mounted over the front fenders. The cabin area also features chrome trim around the windows, having coloured B-pillars and wide C-pillars. The roof is flat in appearance and has a small boot lid on the rear section.\nThe rear end of the car has a rectangular section bearing a central license plate, two chrome sections beside it for the plate lights, black sections and dual red square lamps with chrome details surrounding them. The bumper is also finished in chrome and has two black vertical details on it, while the exhaust tube can be seen on the driver side, just below the bumper. The car bears the Vulcar logo on the centre and the \"Warrener\" lettering on the right-hand side of boot lid end, along with \"5 Speed\" lettering on the left-hand side, just above the bumper.\nIts interior and dials are shared with that of the &lt;a href=\"Monroe\"&gt;Monroe&lt;/a&gt;, being also a derivative of the one from muscle cars like the &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt;. By default, the Warrener spawns in a variety of single-tone colours. However, via customization, its secondary colour is represented as a wide stripe passing through the bonnet, roof, boot and rear end. It uses a set of wheels similar to the &lt;a href=\"Futo\"&gt;Futo&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Youga\"&gt;Youga&lt;/a&gt;, being the \"Fujiwara\" tuner rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in medium-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\nThe Warrener has high acceleration and a good top speed for the class. Its potent 6-cylinder engine has the second-highest torque in the class, just behind the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Diamond\"&gt;Super Diamond&lt;/a&gt;, but unfortunately this results in the car being prone to spinouts, requiring careful driving to maintain traction. Otherwise, the handling is responsive and quick due to the car's light weight and excellent braking. Still, addition of the spoiler mod is recommended to keep the car planted. Crash deformation is poor but the engine can take several direct hits before failing.\nThe vehicle is powered by a 6-cylinder engine in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. True to what the badge suggests, a 5-speed gearbox is fitted, while the interior features an automatic transmission gear lever. With the \"Intercooler\" modifications installed, two turbochargers are fitted on a side of the engine, though they are just an aesthetic feature and do not improve the performance of the vehicle, unless the actual \"Turbo\" upgrade is installed. It shares the engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Rat-Loader\"&gt;Rat-Loader&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rusty%20Rebel\"&gt;Rusty Rebel&lt;/a&gt;, but with a cleaner tone.\nIn the Expanded &amp; Enhanced versions of the game, the Warrener\u2019s engine sound was changed to that used on the &lt;a href=\"JB%20700\"&gt;JB 700&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Albany\"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt; in the .\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nDepictions of the Washington in , and is primarily based on the , while also sharing styling elements with other contemporary luxury sedans, such as the , , and .\nThe Washington features a generally boxy yet contemporary design, resulting in the car being one of the newest cars at the time of &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;'s 1980s settings. For \"GTA San Andreas\", the car remains largely similar, except for a 90's facelift, with the exception of wider headlight clusters, a modified front grille and rear light clusters that light up as a whole at night or during braking. While similar to the \"GTA Vice City\" rendition, the \"GTA Vice City Stories\" Washington sports additional side trims derived from the &lt;a href=\"FBI%20Washington\"&gt;FBI Washington&lt;/a&gt;, implying the FBI Washington's vehicle model was used in place of the original Washington model from \"GTA Vice City\".\nThe car normally spawns in a variety of single body colors. The \"Vice City Stories\" version of the Washington also spawns in white, which is not available in \"GTA Vice City\" except for the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20%28console%29\"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt; version.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn , the &lt;a href=\"Albany\"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt; Washington is based on the , with a few cues on the front from the . It features \"Executive\" badging, akin to the Executive Series trimmed Town Cars, and its wheels are also very similar to those found on 1998\u20132002 Executive Series Town Cars.\nThe overall design of the car is way less boxy than the 3D Universe renditions, having a rounded front bumper with a grilled section on the center, a black trim at the bottom and a license plate. The upper area of the car features the main grille and a set of wide headlights with small turn signals. An Albany ornament can be seen on the front of the hood.\nThe side have a similar profile to the 3D Universe iterations, having fender flares and chrome lines passing through the doors, along with black sections at the bottom. The greenhouse area features black, plastic-like trim around the windows, as well as rounded mirror wings near the A-pillars and \"Executive\" badges on the rearmost pillars. A small aerial mount can be seen on the passenger side, on the top part of the trunk.\nThe rear of the car bears an Albany badge on the end of the trunk, while the rear end has an inset area containing the license plate and silver lettering displaying the car's name, embossed on the passenger side. The outer edges of the car has large tail light clusters, each one consisting of large red outer lights and small, vertical inner lights, with black trim around the whole clusters. The rear bumper follows a similar profile to the front one, with a black detail at the bottom and two mouldings for the twin exhaust pipes.\nThe Washington can spawn in a variety of single colors on the body. It uses a set of rims consisting of a large dish with various small spokes around it.\nThe Washington is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; system with a female voice, but only if the player leaves the \"selected cars\" (default) option in the audio menu. It will also make an audible \"door ajar\" dinging noise if the player exits the vehicle but leaves the door open. It can be heard clearly in quiet areas with the volume turned up.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn and , the overall design of the Washington remains unchanged from \"GTA IV\". The \"Washington\" badge on the rear of the vehicle in \"GTA IV\" is removed, as well as the aerial mount on the trunk. The LED strips along the inset of its taillight clusters are more clearly defined when its lights are turned on. \nIn the enhanced version, the vehicle's interior is the Police/Taxi archetype used in vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Fugitive\"&gt;Fugitive&lt;/a&gt; and Premier, as well other vehicles analogous to the real-life Panther platform such as the Stanier-based &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt;. The Washington's interior is distinguished by additional wood (or wood veneer) paneling on the doors, furthering its Town Car references. \nAgain, the Washington can spawn in a variety of single body colors, and retains its wheel design.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nPre-\"GTA IV\" Washingtons are generally regarded as having only moderate performance, having an inline-6 engine coupled to a five-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive configuration (however, the Washington featured in \"GTA Vice City Stories\" has a front-wheel-drive configuration), which is largely attributed to its bulky design. Its longer wheelbase and weight often results in under-steer and poor cornering, while its size may also be a factor in its moderate acceleration, and its top speed is also estimated to be moderate. So getting it to top speed and good acceleration takes longer than sports cars. Nevertheless, its superior size and weight allows the Washington to ram aside other sedans more easily.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe rendition of the Washington performs largely the same as cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Admiral&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"PMP%20600\"&gt;PMP 600&lt;/a&gt;. Acceleration is slightly below average and top speed is slightly below average, but makes up for its braking, which is very good. The suspension is very soft, designed to flatten out bumps in a road, not for high speed cornering, leaving the Washington fishtailing and spinning out of control when cornering at speed. Accident deformation is superb, making the Washington ideal for ramming vehicles. The engine build quality is also above average, and will sustain multiple direct impacts before smoking, or being set ablaze.\nThe car appears to be powered by a V8 engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear-wheel drive layout. It uses the same low-revving, smooth engine sound from luxury cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Cognoscenti\"&gt;Cognoscenti&lt;/a&gt;, the PMP 600 and the Admiral.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe and Washington performs largely the same as the \"GTA IV\" rendition, aside from a slightly higher top speed and slightly better handling. The car is, however, prone to damage, as it cannot sustain too much gunfire or crashes. Still, the Washington performs much like average sedans like the &lt;a href=\"Stanier\"&gt;Stanier&lt;/a&gt;.\nAgain, the car appears to be powered by a V8 engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear-wheel drive layout. Its engine sound is generally low-revving and smooth, appearing to be similar, if not identical, to most standard sedans.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIt can only be modified at &lt;a href=\"TransFender\"&gt;TransFender&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpecial Variants.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nTwo unique black Washingtons may be seen driven by the &lt;a href=\"GIGN%20and%20DGSE\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; during the mission &lt;a href=\"All%20Hands%20On%20Deck%21\"&gt;All Hands On Deck!&lt;/a&gt;, in \"GTA Vice City\". While it is possible to reach the cars and enter them, it is impossible to drive them (as the mission immediately ends and the car is lost). It is also impossible to push the cars to a garage as an alternative, as the player is only given a brief window of time before &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Cortez\"&gt;Juan Cortez&lt;/a&gt; is killed, leading to mission failure which warps the player back to the nearby mission trigger with the cars vanished. This variant is often confused as the FBI version, but closer inspections reveals that the details are completely different.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nA Washington is requested as part of &lt;a href=\"Stevie%27s%20Car%20Thefts\"&gt;Stevie's Car Thefts&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike most vehicles in the side mission, the Washington appears with a black body color that is not unique, as many black Washingtons can be seen around Algonquin. The car will still spawn in the same location until is delivered.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nScientists.\nIn the enhanced version of the game, a white Washington alongside a white &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt; may spawn at the &lt;a href=\"Satellite%20Relay%20Station\"&gt;Satellite Relay Station&lt;/a&gt; with several scientists inspecting the area. These vehicles replace the &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Buffalo\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; Buffalo and &lt;a href=\"FIB%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; Granger that spawned in the same location in the original release of the game, not obtainable in the enhanced version.\nThe vehicles only spawn at this location between 10:00 am and 12:00 pm and appear in both \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\".\nThis version cannot be recreated in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; as it sports a Classic Pure White primary and pearl color, and can spawn with any of the available extras (coffee cup holders, cigarette holder, etc)."}

They plan to run in the front of the warehouse, wipe out anyone in their way, take the money, then run out back to commandeer a &lt;a href=\"Dinghy%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt; near the docks on recommendation of &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst Shootout: Junkyard.\nWhen the player arrives at the warehouse, they must follow the crew on foot to a small junkyard beside the warehouse. There will be several goons patroling outside, so after the player jumps the fence, they must eliminate the targets and make sure to protect Packie and the others.\nPackie tends to rush into battle and therefore gets killed fairly quickly. The door to the warehouse will not be unlocked until the targets have been eliminated.\nSecond Shootout: Warehouse.\nWhen the player reaches the warehouse door facing the street, they must run in and eliminate everyone inside. The player must then run up the stairs, across the catwalk to the overhead office to grab the &lt;a href=\"Backpacks\"&gt;bag of cash&lt;/a&gt;. Three targets are above the ground floor (the office &amp; the catwalk) and are immune to NPC attacks (Packie, Michael, Gordon, even &lt;a href=\"Dwayne%20Forge\"&gt;Dwayne&lt;/a&gt;'s backups), to being killed by falling, and to Niko's trample.\nThird Shootout: Third party attacks &amp; the escape.\nAt this point, some &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; mobsters, who are also planning on stealing the money, come into the warehouse and start firing at Packie and his group. The player must kill the mobsters and head down the stairs. Packie will tell Niko to follow him to a getaway boat. The player must ignore any mobsters after this point and run, Gordon and Michael will stay behind to eliminate them.\nAfter Niko steals the money and the Italian mobsters come in, they spawn indefinitely.\nThe player must exit the warehouse and follow Packie to the docks. They will have to swim to the boat. Once Niko and Packie are in the boat, the player must head to the yellow marker. Once they are there, the mission is passed."}

The truck's design is mainly composed of exposed frames with welded panels on them.\nThe front end is predominated by a front defense with four rectangular lamps on it, while the upper section of the cab is protected by a meshed screen with four additional lamps on the roof. The sides of the cab lacks any sort of doors, instead being accessed directly.\nThe rear section is predominated by the large bed with metal bars and panels on the sides. A set of winch cables derived from the &lt;a href=\"Flatbed\"&gt;Flatbed&lt;/a&gt; can be seen over it, which does not serve any purpose outside of scripted missions. Below the bed and between the wheels, some of the vital components, such as the oil tanks and the fuel tanks, can be seen, along with articulated bars and suspension springs for the axles.\nThe interior of the cab is devoid of any standard interior elements, other than a set of dials, switches, race seats and other components derived from race-style interior.\nThe truck only comes in a dark green primary color for the chassis and external frames of the vehicle, along with a matte desert brown/tan secondary color for the flat surfaces of the truck. This color set is fixed for the truck and cannot be changes through mod shops (unless recoloring it through the &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;). It uses large industrial wheels similar to the \"Spooner\" muscle rims (although more concave and having more bolts around the center), wrapped in high-profile tires with rugged tread patterns, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Brickade\"&gt;Brickade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dune\"&gt;Dune&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\nFor travelling, the Wastelander proves to be very efficient, as the raised suspension and all wheel drive layout allows to sort uneven terrain with ease and to easily ford most rivers. The lightweight construction and the relatively short wheelbase makes the Wastelander able to achieve high speeds and be highly maneuverable. Also, as expected for a truck with large wheels and great suspension, the Wastelander can withstand a great amount of water depth; it can go as deep as its platform before the engine cuts off.\nIts only downsides, however, are that the truck lacks ramming capabilities; due to the lightweight construction and high suspension, the truck may drive over small cars and lose control in the process, while larger cars may be pushed slightly, opposed to trucks like the Brickade or the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;. Because of the lack of doors, the occupants would be highly susceptible to gunfire and being hijacked by other players.\nIt is noted that the Wastelander can carry six occupants, with four of them standing on the railings of the back section. As with a &lt;a href=\"Granger\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roosevelt\"&gt;Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt; or Brickade, these occupants can make use of &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Rifles\"&gt;Assault Rifles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Light%20Machine%20Guns\"&gt;Light Machine Guns&lt;/a&gt;, making the Wastelander a great transport/defense truck. They can also jump on the truck and be able to use any weapons without turning into a ragdoll, while able to take cover on the railings or metal plates.\nDespite having no weaponry attached to the vehicle, the use of Passive Mode is not allowed while in the Wastelander."}

After \"GTA III\", Rockstar decided they did not like having inaccessible landmasses visible, so in-game worlds surrounded by infinite oceans on all sides even if lore dictates the world is land-locked \u2013 by implementing large bodies of water, the boundaries of the in-game world can be effectively hidden.\n2D Universe.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2D%20Universe\"&gt;2D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, water is limited in interaction. In \"GTA 1\" it is possible to walk into water on their level and &lt;a href=\"Swimming\"&gt;paddle&lt;/a&gt; for a handful of seconds before &lt;a href=\"Game%20Over\"&gt;drowning&lt;/a&gt;. If the player falls into the water from a height, or tries to sail a boat, they will instantly drown however. If the player falls into water at all in \"GTA 2\", they will instantly die.\n3D Universe.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nThe first game of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;GTA III's&lt;/a&gt;\" water is opaque, polluted and toxic. If the player completely submerges himself inside water by walking or driving into it, the player's &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; will begin to decrease rapidly, and his body will slowly float to the surface. An article for the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt; explains that this is due to an oil spill that had coated the city's harbor in a thick hazardous film, a direct result of deregulation of the harbor. It is also disclosed that a similar disaster of worse magnitude occurred in &lt;a href=\"1988\"&gt;1988&lt;/a&gt;. This is similar to the real-world , while the \"occasional flash fires\" mentioned to occur are similar to those of the ; both rivers were infamous for their high industrial pollution. &lt;a href=\"Fish\"&gt;Fish&lt;/a&gt; are seen in &lt;a href=\"Gone%20Fishing\"&gt;Gone Fishing&lt;/a&gt;, but are never seen before or after.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nIn \"\" more boats are available to drive, although the player will still die if fully submerged in sea water, the result of rip tides in the ocean currents. Compared to \"GTA III\", the water is transparent and featured sea floors (although \"deep water\" still had no bottom), sunken wrecks, fish, &lt;a href=\"Sharks%20%28animal%29\"&gt;sharks&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"dolphins\"&gt;dolphins&lt;/a&gt;, although they are not solid and do not respond to interaction.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn \"\" the player is for the first time able to swim in the water and even dive and swim underwater, as well as drive a large variety of boats. When underneath the water, CJ will slowly lose oxygen and eventually die if he stayed under water for too long. The water in \"GTA San Andreas\" is mostly transparent and has a better overall look than the water in \"GTA Vice City\". There are many sea creatures in this game such as jellyfish and dolphins, although animals are still not solid and do not interact with the player.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Advance\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;GTA Advance&lt;/a&gt;\", water is not accessible by foot no more than the shore as invisible barriers surround all pools of water in the game. However, the player can freely drive any vehicle into water, though it will quickly sink. If the players vehicle is between land and water, splash effects will be seen as a warning that going any further in will sink the vehicle and &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;lead to a fatal result&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nIn \"\", as in the games before \"GTA San Andreas\", the player can't swim, though they can drive\u00a0some boats. The water is deep blue-colored and non-transparent, but not as polluted as it was in \"GTA III\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nIn ', after many complaints because swimming was impossible in the previous game ('), &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0made swimming possible again, albeit without the diving function. It only permits swimming for a limited amount of time, determined by a stamina bar which decreases as the player remains in the water. When the bar runs out, the player's health decreases,\u00a0as the player will\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;drown to death&lt;/a&gt;. Completing the &lt;a href=\"Beach%20Patrol\"&gt;Beach Patrol&lt;/a&gt; side mission, however, will stop the player's stamina from depleting. The water is turquoise and slightly transparent.\nHD Universe.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV &amp; Episodes from Liberty City\".\nThe water in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;GTA IV&lt;/a&gt;\"\u00a0and the \"\" is partially transparent and highly reflective. The player can not go underwater, being restricted to swimming on the surface of the water, non-player characters can also swim for a short period of time. The only actual advantage of water in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0is that it creates a quicker route between islands if the player finds a boat. Although Liberty City is described as land-locked to the North and West, it is surrounded by water in-game.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nIn\u00a0\"\", like in the previous\u00a0&lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0games, the player can only swim on the surface. The boats are similar as well, except for the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Wet%20Ski\"&gt;Wet Ski&lt;/a&gt;. There are no fish. The water looks rather transparent, so some radioactive waste, as well as some underwater dunes and four \"Here Be Dragons!\" &lt;a href=\"Secrets\"&gt;Easter Egg&lt;/a&gt; messages (one in the north-east, one in the north-west, one in the south-east and one in the south-west) can be found.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn \"GTA V\", swimming returns with major upgrades. Just like in \"\", the player can swim in and under water, albeit with some changes. To swim underwater, the player can use a &lt;a href=\"Scuba%20Suit\"&gt;scuba suit&lt;/a&gt; or drive a &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;. Underwater is much more detailed, and for the first time, there are &lt;a href=\"Sharks%20%28animal%29\"&gt;sharks&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0that can be interacted with. There are multiple vehicles the player may use to traverse the waters with. There are shipwrecks, hidden underwater that have hidden &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Packages\"&gt;treasures&lt;/a&gt; inside, that the player can retrieve for &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;Weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; can also be found underwater. A dead whale's skeleton and a crashed &lt;a href=\"UFOs\"&gt;UFO&lt;/a&gt; can also be found in specific locations underwater. Another new feature into \"GTA V\" is if the player dives too deep, the submarine will be destroyed by the water pressure, &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; them. Like Liberty City, San Andreas is described as land-locked to the North and East, with the ocean only serving as a gameplay barrier."}

The vehicle also features updated carbon fiber wheel arches and four LEDs, with one located above each wheel, as well as a small red light behind the turret. Beyond these additions, the vehicle is largely identical to the stock version, with identical modification parts as well. If the Weaponized Ignus is given the &lt;a href=\"Hao%27s%20Special%20Works\"&gt;Hao's Special Works&lt;/a&gt; Performance Upgrade in the &lt;a href=\"LS%20Car%20Meet\"&gt;LS Car Meet&lt;/a&gt;, the car will gain a Hao's Special Works badge on the rear end, above the license plate.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on most of the bodywork, details around the engine, the interior stitching and the mounted gun, while the secondary colour is applied on the details beside the headlamp housings and on the fender vents, and the outlines of the front end, side skirts, wheel arches, rear diffuser, and rear fins. Although not accessible, a trim colour is also available for the dashboard, horn cap and part of the doors, which is always set to black on purchased examples. It uses a set of 10-spoke dual rims, alternating between larger spokes with a painted finish and smaller ones with a black finish. The outer lines and large spokes can support a dedicated colour, although only naturally-generated examples may have one.\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with a roof-mounted, three-barreled minigun turret that seems to resemble a gatling gun.\nPerformance.\nArmour/Defense.\nThe Weaponized Ignus lacks armour and can be destroyed with a single explosive, making it less of an ideal choice against vehicles with heavier armor and/or weaponry. However, the rear provides slight protection for the occupants, ideal for evading enemy pursuers and police vehicles during &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted levels&lt;/a&gt;. It also has bullet-resistant windows, which are able to withstand 15 rounds from most firearms before being shattered.\nThe Weaponized Ignus, along with selected vehicles from update, can be modified with a Missile Lock-on Jammer, which prevents the lock-on system of the &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Launcher\"&gt;Homing Launcher&lt;/a&gt; and other weaponized vehicles to target it. This option is installed by default when purchased.\nWeaponry.\nMinigun: The driver has access to a remote minigun turret, which has the same offensive capabilities as any mounted minigun found on vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Tampa\"&gt;Weaponized Tampa&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Speedo%20Custom\"&gt;Speedo Custom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up%20Custom\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up Custom&lt;/a&gt;. This weapon also retains the characteristic of destroying vehicles instantly upon being damaged enough, contrary to mounted machine guns that can only set the vehicles aflame before exploding. Unlike most land vehicles that have fixed weaponry, the Weaponized Ignus' minigun has limited motion range towards the front, allowing for small aim adjustments without having to move the car as one would do with most weaponized land vehicles. However, the camera does not have the free-aim functionality of most remote turrets and has a tendency to move back to the centre at high speeds, limiting its potential to take out targets."}

It can also be modified to equip four front missile launchers, a swiveling dual-gun remote turret and dual rear mortar launchers that appear to be an altered .\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Weaponized Tampa is one of the fastest weaponized vehicles, performing slightly better than its normal counterpart, thanks to its higher speed. Handling remains average compared to the standard model, but has better response on bumpy roads, curbs and uneven terrain due to the all-wheel drivetrain, at the cost of oversteer at medium speeds. Its increased weight means a slightly better ramming power against cars with similar or lower mass.\nLike the regular Tampa, the vehicle is powered by a 310 cubic inches (5.1 liter) V8, positioned in a front-engine, all wheel drive configuration (1/4 of the engine power to the front wheels and the rest to the rear wheels) and coupled to a 4-speed gearbox. The engine also has a mounted cylindrical air filter by default. It shares the same engine sound as the regular Tampa, being a variation of the one from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20%28car%29\"&gt;Blade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nightshade\"&gt;Nightshade&lt;/a&gt;, also featuring a supercharged sound effect that is amplified when the \"Turbo\" upgrade is equipped.\nArmor.\nThe armor upgrades add armor plated panels and bullbars to the vehicle, although the occupants are still exposed to gunfire and the car can still explode with a single explosive. However, it can withstand other vehicles exploding next to it when shot by the minigun, giving the occupants some time to leave the vehicle before it explodes.\nWeaponry.\nThe Weaponized Tampa makes up for its weak armor in having several weapons, all of them operated by the driver:\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nWeaponized Tampa=\nFixed Minigun=\nDual Minigun=\nMissiles=\nRear Mortar=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Weaponized Tampa can only be modified at a &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;Vehicle Workshop&lt;/a&gt; inside a &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt;."}

The weapons are virtually identical in nature in the London expansion packs but feature different graphical designs to reflect the era of the games.\nWeapons in \"GTA\" are typically obtained by breaking crates scattered around the game's three cities, regardless whether or not the player is in a vehicle; weapons may also be picked up from deceased individuals who were armed. The amount of ammunition for all weapons is measured by single units, and as such, is considerably simple when compared to its more modern counterparts in the \"GTA\" series.\nThe weapon system in \"GTA\" served as the basis for improved and expanded versions in many of its successors, as all of the weapons have been present in nearly all \"GTA\" games, with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Flamethrower\"&gt;Flamethrower&lt;/a&gt;, which is not available in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

Another feature of this improvement is the targeting lock that changes color as the target's &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; decreases. Green progresses to orange, which progresses to red, and finally black upon the target's death.\nThe Auto-aim also seems to bear a strong resemblance to the execution system in &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;Rockstar North&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Manhunt\"&gt;Manhunt&lt;/a&gt;\", where the darker the color or the target, the more gruesome the execution; in \"GTA San Andreas\", the darker the color of the target, the less health of the target.\nWeapon Skill.\nAnother notable feature is a weapon skill system; where it determines the general proficiency of the player with the weapons. This increases when the player shoots accurately. Getting a high Weapon Skill increases the ability with weapons and grants more versatility when used. There are three levels of skill: \"Poor\", \"Gangster\", and \"Hitman\".\nOne can view the weapon skills two ways:\nGangster.\nGangster level is reached when the meter is 20% to 50% filled.\nWhen Gangster is reached with certain weapons, you're able to move while aiming, and your lock-on range, accuracy, rate of fire, and strafe speed increase:\nHitman.\nHitman level is reached when the meter is 100% filled.\nWhen Hitman is reached with certain weapons, your lock-on range, accuracy, rate of fire, and strafe speed increase further, and you're able to fire these weapons while moving:\nDouble Weapon Hitman.\nOne new feature is the ability to duel-wield certain weapons after reaching Hitman weapon skill level. These weapons are light enough and feature reloading that is compatible with holding one in each hand. This allows the player to inflict twice the amount of damage per reload cycle. For weapons that have Double Weapon Hitman, it takes longer to reach 100% weapon skill opposed to other weapons that can only be wielded with both hands.\nWhen you reach Double Weapon Hitman, you can wield two of the below weapons simultaneously, and your lock-on range increases:\nTypes.\nHere is a list of the available weapon slots, and the weapons that can be used in those slots.

However, subsequently after the release of the original \"GTA Vice City\" for the PlayStation 2, Rockstar dropped the real names of the guns, probably due to trademark reasons likely being approached by , the manufacturer of the MP5 and PSG1. Therefore some weapons on the list have two names, the first coming from the original PS2 version while the second coming from subsequent PS2 versions and the &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20%28console%29\"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt; versions.

It clearly isn't a garage, but Kendl is determined to make it into a garage. It would take a lot of hard work, but she manages to persuade Carl and they decide to give it a try. She also says if Carl is going to make that place into a garage, he'll need a few workmen. The Truth knows of a few acquaintances who can help turn the garage into a successful chop shop and has Carl drive to specific locations in the city to meet them.\nCarl and The Truth first go meet &lt;a href=\"Jethro\"&gt;Jethro&lt;/a&gt; at a gas station in Easter Basin. After Jethro gets in, The Truth asks Carl to make a few seemingly random stops to monitor the activities of some mysterious vans. One of the stops he asks Carl to make is directly in front of &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;San Fierro Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;, where The Truth admonishes the other passengers to \"think about a yellow rubber duck\" as a van emerges from the hospital's car park. Without explanation, The Truth urges Carl on to the next stop. Next, he asks Carl to pay a visit to &lt;a href=\"Dwaine\"&gt;Dwaine&lt;/a&gt; at his hot dog van. Then, he asks Carl to go to the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Police%20Headquarters\"&gt;San Fierro Police Headquarters&lt;/a&gt; to see the van again. Lastly, he asks Carl to pick up &lt;a href=\"Zero\"&gt;Zero&lt;/a&gt; in front of &lt;a href=\"Zero%20RC\"&gt;his shop&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, the four return to the Doherty Garage together. Carl then introduces the new members of staff to Cesar, and Kendl suggests about the property business.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nReward.\nThere is no reward for this mission, but the mission &lt;a href=\"555%20We%20Tip\"&gt;555 We Tip&lt;/a&gt; is unlocked. Also, Zero calls the player and says that his landlord is selling &lt;a href=\"Zero%20RC\"&gt;his shop&lt;/a&gt;. If Carl buys it later (for &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;30,000), the mission &lt;a href=\"Air%20Raid\"&gt;Air Raid&lt;/a&gt; is unlocked after another phone call from Zero."}

For example; it may be cloudy, then a slight drizzle may fall, followed by rain and then a thunderstorm. This is a perfect example of the wide varieties of weather mixtures the game is capable of doing. The games can also simulate wind, which can realistically result in trees swaying back and forth and increased turbulence while flying aircraft. &lt;a href=\"Rainbow\"&gt;Rainbows&lt;/a&gt; can also appear in , and \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nBroadcasters on some &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations\"&gt;Radio Stations&lt;/a&gt; often comment on the current weather or announce the weather forecasts in the local area. The &lt;a href=\"Internet%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; in also has weather forecasts. &lt;a href=\"Eyefind.info\"&gt;Eyefind.info&lt;/a&gt; in displays the current weather in the top right corner.\nThe first weather report was in \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", where it was used to implement the &lt;a href=\"Island%20Restrictions\"&gt;Island Restrictions&lt;/a&gt;, announcing the closure of the bridges in Vice City due to the threat of Hurricane Hermoine.\nIn the HD Universe, weather will impact the behaviour of &lt;a href=\"Pedestrians\"&gt;Pedestrians&lt;/a&gt;, with the onset of rainfall seeing them running for cover or attempting to shelter their heads with held objects and the density of pedestrians on the streets reducing rapidly. In \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\", street gang presence will be significantly reduced during rainstorms.\nWeather in \"GTA Online\".\nIn , the weather is defined by a pseudo-random schedule consisting of 55 weather changes spanning 384 in-game hours. In other words, the weather cycle in \"GTA Online\" repeats every 12.8 real-life hours, and it changes 55 times in this interval \u2014 or rather, 54 times, because the cycle starts and ends with the same weather type, \"Partly Cloudy\". These weather events can last between 120 real seconds and one real hour. \nIt never rains at night in &lt;a href=\"Free%20Mode\"&gt;Free Mode&lt;/a&gt;; however, rain at night can be seen in some jobs (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Raid%20-%20Deliver%20EMP\"&gt;Humane Raid - Deliver EMP&lt;/a&gt;) and during special events (e.g. Halloween, Alien Egg mission). Rain at night in Free Mode may have been disabled because old consoles' performance was too poor to render the reflections of the standing water in a 30-player lobby.\nRain at nighttime is one of the two possible weather types (the other being snow) required for the Alien Tattoo event to spawn. \"GTA Online\" players could mostly only get the special &lt;a href=\"UFO%20Tattoo\"&gt;UFO Tattoo&lt;/a&gt; legitimately during snowy weather, specifically because rain at night is a near-impossible event.

Sunny weather creates a \"cheerful\" atmosphere, especially in locations such as &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt; and most areas in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;. Sunny weather is also commonly seen in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;. The tropical &lt;a href=\"Caribbean\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt; island of &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico\"&gt;Cayo Perico&lt;/a&gt; is almost always depicted as a sunny paradise.\nOvercast.\nCloudy, Broken Cloud and Overcast weather is one of the most common weather states in \"GTA\", and it has featured in every game of the franchise. Cloudy weather does not create a particular atmosphere and is considered a \"default\" weather state due to how often it occurs. Cloudy weather can be seen pretty much everyday at some point, except in some places such as the desert, where overcast conditions may never take place. Cloudy weather does not have much of a visual difference, as the sky is still brightly lit during daytime, unlike foggy or rainy conditions, and visibility is still high. It generally occurs before or after rainfall. \nHazy.\nThe 3D Universe first introduced players to visual shimmering heatwaves when the temperature reaches blazing highs, though this does not affect the player's health in any way.\nSandstorm.\nA sandstorm is a weather pattern first seen in \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\". They arise when a gust front blows loose sand and dust from a dry surface. It occurs regularly only in &lt;a href=\"Bone%20County\"&gt;Bone County&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt; as it suits the climate. When sandstorms occur, visibility is severely restricted. Clouds of dust can be seen blowing and the sky's color changes to a dull brown. Sandstorms also have a physical impact on aircraft, increasing turbulence, blowing them fiercely in random directions, which can make flying treacherous. Pursuing &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"VCN%20Maverick\"&gt;News Chopper&lt;/a&gt;s will fly away when sandstorms occur and aircraft will never spawn in the sky. Minor dust storms can also occur in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Senora%20Desert\"&gt;Grand Senora Desert&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA V\", but are not as intense as previous.\nFog.\nFog and mist is common in both renditions of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, and the countryside of &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, and very rarely in &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;. This can range from a light fog to a thick impenetrable \"pea soup\" effect where visibility is severely reduced. Foggy/misty weather can create an \"eerie\" atmosphere, especially in locations such as the remote San Andreas countryside.\nSmog.\nSmog is often present in Los Santos in both \"GTA: San Andreas\" and \"GTA V\". Radio stations based in that city will have DJs comment about the smog. A &lt;a href=\"Redwood%20Cigarettes\"&gt;Redwood Cigarettes&lt;/a&gt; commercial mentions of a man hinting the amount of pollution within the areas.\nThe presence of smog within the city suggests that Los Santos is very polluted. This does not adversely impact the player's health though.\nRain.\nRain or Drizzle occurs in most \"GTA\" games every three to five days, though this can vary depending on the climate. For example, in \"GTA: San Andreas\", rain mainly occurs in Los Santos, San Fierro, and the surrounding countryside. Rain can also occur in Las Venturas and Bone County, but very rarely. \"GTA: Vice City\" first introduced realistic rain drops forming on the player's screen as if they were literally in the protagonist's shoes. The 3D Universe introduced car's headlights reflecting the rain on the road which instantly resulted in senses of realism, making the game more \"alive\" and increasing the atmosphere. The rainfall can vary depending on how clear the skies are. Rain also affects the performance of many road vehicles, and can degrade handling and braking power due to slippery roads. \"GTA IV\" introduces new variable forms of rainfall including drizzle. In \"GTA V\" this is enhanced even further, with different intensity of rainfall being featured. It ranges from drizzle and sun-showers, to torrential downpours.\nThunderstorm.\nThunderstorms are a less common occurrence. Heavy rainfall results in occasional thunder and lightning, which, if supported, causes controller vibration, to increase the sense of realism. \"GTA V\" also introduced rendered forked lightning bolts in the sky during thunderstorms, as opposed to the sky simply \"lighting up\" as sheet lightning in previous games. During severe storms, the yellow light on traffic lights will continuously flash, indicating that the power has been switched off. \nSnow.\n&lt;a href=\"Snow\"&gt;Snow&lt;/a&gt; is first introduced in \"GTA: San Andreas\", during the mission &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Mark%27s%20Bistro\"&gt;Saint Mark's Bistro&lt;/a&gt;, while the player is in Liberty City. The snow was also slightly featured in the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%20Portable\"&gt;PlayStation Portable&lt;/a&gt; version of while doing the &lt;a href=\"Car%20Salesman\"&gt;Car Salesman&lt;/a&gt; side missions. Snow reappears in \"GTA V\", where it is always present in the midwest &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20North%20Yankton\"&gt;State of North Yankton&lt;/a&gt; during the events of &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;Prologue&lt;/a&gt;, and later in &lt;a href=\"Bury%20the%20Hatchet\"&gt;Bury the Hatchet&lt;/a&gt; which takes place during a light snowstorm.\nSnow makes regular appearances in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", usually as &lt;a href=\"Holiday%20Gifts\"&gt;Holiday Gifts&lt;/a&gt; in late December, where the entire southern San Andreas area is blanketed in snow and light snow showers are common. Vehicle traction is significantly reduced (more so than during rainfall) when snow is present. \nThe player can turn snowfall on in Los Santos and Blaine County in Director Mode, however this snow does not settle and will not provide a \"blanket of snow\" effect. \nVehicles that are present during snowfall will have their external surfaces covered in large patches of snow. Unlike the vehicles in North Yankton, which have the patches of snow present on the models themselves, the snow which accumulates on vehicles in \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\" appears to be mostly dynamic decals.\nMission Scripted Weather.\nWhile most missions in the games take place in the standard timecycle and therefore have random weather possibilities, some missions may have their weather pre-scripted for dramatic effect, or in some cases, increased or reduced difficulty. e.g. During the &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist/Finale\"&gt;Cayo Perico Heist&lt;/a&gt;, a thunderstorm may be present and &lt;a href=\"Pavel\"&gt;Pavel&lt;/a&gt; will advise that it will reduce the enemy effectiveness as their vision and hearing will be impaired."}

It is in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", however, when its prominence was elevated, reporting events of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; and the exploits of the &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;, Weazel News is a massive news network with three news divisions including Weazel Sports. \nIn \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", Niko can visit the &lt;a href=\"weazelnews.com\"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, watch it on &lt;a href=\"TV%20Shows%20in%20GTA%20IV%23Weazel\"&gt;television&lt;/a&gt;, or most commonly, listen to it on the &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;radio&lt;/a&gt;. Weazel News also operates a program known as \"The Weazel News Morning Show\", most likely a parody of \"\". \nAs of &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, a significant portion of its programming, particularly internet articles, is radically right-wing. This is evident in their endorsement of draconian anti-terrorism measures that seize Americans' freedom, such as the &lt;a href=\"Jingoism%20Act\"&gt;Jingoism Act&lt;/a&gt; and the closure of Liberty City's bridges. Following the collapse of an &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; construction crane, they also attempt to establish connections between labor unions and terrorism. Additionally, they dismiss concerns about the economic recession as \"liberal lies and depression,\" falsely claiming that President &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Lawton\"&gt;Joe Lawton&lt;/a&gt; and conservative members of Congress ended the country's financial woes.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\", the &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News%20Building\"&gt;main broadcasting building&lt;/a&gt; for the network can be found in &lt;a href=\"Little%20Seoul\"&gt;Little Seoul&lt;/a&gt;, and its &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20Plaza\"&gt;corporate headquarters&lt;/a&gt;, based on the , is located in &lt;a href=\"Rockford%20Hills\"&gt;Rockford Hills&lt;/a&gt;.

Some of its internet articles seem level-headed in comparison to 2008. However, much hypocrisy and chaos remain in the news network. For example, &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Kelly\"&gt;Karl Kelly&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Cynthia%20Kelly\"&gt;ex-wife&lt;/a&gt;, both Weazel journalists, frequently slander each other in their reporting. There seem to be no consequences for their inappropriate conduct.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", not much is known or seen about Weazel News after 2013. However, in the summer of &lt;a href=\"2022\"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;, a news report surrounding update can be heard by the player.\nIn the mid-2020s, during the narrative of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto VI&lt;/a&gt;\", Weazel reports on incidents such as an overturned vehicle crash and \"thugs\" causing chaos on motorbikes. There is an additional report about a &lt;a href=\"Leonida%20Man\"&gt;Leonida Man&lt;/a&gt;.\nRadio Stories.\n The news on the radio will update itself as the player progresses through the story.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\n\"The Lost and Damned\" feature stories unique to &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;'s storyline but also includes references events from the \"GTA IV\" storyline: \n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" features stories unique to &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Fernando Lopez'&lt;/a&gt; storyline, but references events in the other plots as well.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\" features only one news segment from Weazel News during the &lt;a href=\"Credits%20in%20GTA%20Chinatown%20Wars\"&gt;credits&lt;/a&gt; of the game as part of the \"Chinatown Wars (Remix)\" song, making reference to some of &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Heston\"&gt;Wade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hsin%20Jaoming\"&gt;Hsin\u2019s&lt;/a&gt; missions and references to the &lt;a href=\"Salt%20in%20the%20Wound\"&gt;final mission of the game&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", the player can &lt;a href=\"Television%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;watch&lt;/a&gt; a dedicated Weazel News channel constantly showing &lt;a href=\"Police%20Maverick\"&gt;Police Maverick&lt;/a&gt; and cinematic footage of other random players in the &lt;a href=\"Free%20Mode\"&gt;Free Mode&lt;/a&gt; lobby, prioritizing those players with &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted levels&lt;/a&gt;.

Outside, the body features tube metal caging, with two lights mounted at the front. There are two large ballast pontoons on the underside of the vehicle. There are also multiple black tanks and pipes connected to the sides. There is a controllable vertical rudder above and below the propeller. There are many pipes and valves on the internal walls. \nIn the enhanced version of the game, it now has several lime-green bands around the front section and the two pontoons, as well as extra lamps on the sides for better visibility on its surrounding.\nBy entering the Submersible, the player equips a &lt;a href=\"Scuba%20Suit\"&gt;Scuba Suit&lt;/a&gt; upon exiting it. When exiting the Submersible, a submarine icon will remain on the map while the player is within a certain radius of it.\nPerformance.\nThe submersible is powered by an electric motor, which powers a single at the rear end.\nThe maximum dive depth of the Submersible is at around 492 ft. Diving deeper will result in a warning about the pressure being too high, additionally the sounds of bending/cracking steel can be heard. Diving beyond 550 ft will display a second warning, telling the player that the pressure is at a dangerously high level. The Submersible will implode a short while after, &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; the occupant inside in the process. The Submersible will run out of oxygen after approximately 24 in game hours, however exiting the Submersible and allowing it to climb to the surface allows it to be reused.\nIt is important to note that the Submersible will drift in the sea over time while it is unmanned."}

The Subway Car is only featured in games that are set in the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;3D&lt;/a&gt; (named \"&lt;a href=\"Train%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;Train&lt;/a&gt;\" in-game) and &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;HD&lt;/a&gt; renditions of Liberty City, reflecting its usage in .\nBoth renditions are undrivable, but the player can ride the subway for a small fee, dependent on distance travelled.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the subway car is a single carriage train based on the subway cars, with influences from the older and newer cars. The bulkheads of the cars feature route signs (roll signs) and additional lights seen only on pre-rebuilt R38s (rebuilt R32s and R38s featured only a digital flipdot sign), including \"EXP\" (\"express\") marker light, even though no express lines are present in the game. Only two or three subway cars will be connected to each other at random.\nThe subway cars are poorly maintained, as their interiors are quite dirty and the cars are covered with graffiti inside and out. By using the camera on the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;Mobile Phone&lt;/a&gt;, one can see the interior of the subway car while inside the vehicle. The interior textures appears to be rather undetailed and only a few in-game ads (&lt;a href=\"ECola\"&gt;ECola&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell&lt;/a&gt; and others) are visible.\nThe roll signs on the subway car are the same every time, and do not reflect the line. The route symbol sign states \"K - Happiness Island\", even though &lt;a href=\"Happiness%20Island\"&gt;Happiness Island&lt;/a&gt; is completely inaccessible by trains. The roll sign states \"Sundance St., Sth. Slopes\" - this most likely refers to Schottler Station in Broker (it is on the border of the South Slops neighborhood, and it has a Sundance St. exit) - but Schottler is not served by K trains, only 3 and 8.\nThe subway car has four doors on either side of the train, all of which slide open when arriving at a station. The trains have unique door-ajar-chimes, which can be heard when a train leaves at any station. The trains have small brake lights which operate under braking in tight corners, as well as headlights used inside tunnels and during night time. The cars produce bright blue sparks from their wheels when cornering.\nThe subway cars cannot be driven by the player, but are considered vehicles. They can be entered to go on &lt;a href=\"Subway%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;subway rides&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. The train will not stop at stations when the player has a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;three star or higher wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. If the player is on the train with a three star or higher level, it will stop when it reaches the next station and will refuse to go on until the player exits or loses their wanted level.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe subway car and train tracks appear in \"\". However, the trains cannot be ridden, and the player cannot enter the stations. When close to straight tracks, the train will speed past in a split second (due to limited movement algorithm, the trains won't spawn if the player is standing near curved tracks). It is impossible to follow the train for more than a few seconds, as it despawns as soon as it is off the screen.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe train will operate at a constant-but-moderate speed and doesn't slow down for corners. The train will not stop if the player blocks its path, attempts to stop the train or using any other method of blocking it.\nFalling under the train will instantly result in the player getting &lt;a href=\"Wasted\"&gt;wasted&lt;/a&gt;. Outside of scripted events, the player cannot destroy a subway car, nor being able to intercept it with another car, as the subway car will practically push the player's vehicle effortlessly. If the player's vehicle is stuck on an obstacle while being pushed by the train, the vehicle will simply be crushed."}

It encompasses two ring lines, one elevated and one underground, which serves various portions of the city. As of \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\", the three elevated station names are revealed.\nDue to hardware constraints, the rail networks are absent in the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\" rendition of the city.\nOverview.\nThe network composes of two rail lines, one completely elevated and confined within &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;, and one completely underground and connected to all three islands, or boroughs, of Liberty City. The Portland El and the subway are two separate, independent systems; as a result, there is no physical or official connection between the two services.\nThe systems themselves are simply lines with two train tracks, but trains only travel counterclockwise along the inner lane with two out of three stations having only one platform for the functional side of the tracks. This may suggest that there was originally two trains running in opposite directions, or may just have been put in for possible use by the player only.\nInfluence.\nThe elevated train system of Portland, known as the Portland El, is inspired by the serving the city of , . \nThe systems' trains, known simply as &lt;a href=\"Train%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;Train&lt;/a&gt;s, resemble those of the .\nLines.\nPortland El.\nThe Portland El (Portland Elevated Railroad; sometimes written as \"L\" or \"el\", short for \"elevated\"), also referred to as the Overhead Station, is a that runs across &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Portland El was completed in &lt;a href=\"1930\"&gt;1930&lt;/a&gt;, and continued to run until at least &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt; (when \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" takes place). Much of the system, obviously, runs on elevated tracks, although a very short stretch of the line at &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Mark%27s\"&gt;Saint Mark's&lt;/a&gt; levels itself to a near at-grade configuration against the district's slope.\nWhile non-functional, a segment of the Portland El's tracks at Saint Mark's is briefly seen in \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", during \"&lt;a href=\"Saint%20Mark%27s%20Bistro\"&gt;Saint Mark's Bistro&lt;/a&gt;\".\nStations.\nThe Portland El has stations in &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Mark%27s\"&gt;Saint Mark's&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hepburn%20Heights\"&gt;Hepburn Heights&lt;/a&gt;, and on the edge of &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt;. Initially unnamed in \"GTA III\", the stations are retroactively named in \"GTA Liberty City\" Stories after &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;Rockstar North&lt;/a&gt; developers who worked on \"GTA III\", as listed below. The three districts served by the Portland El network, in \"Grand Theft Auto III\", belong to the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Diablos\"&gt;Diablos&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt;. This is likely by design, and after leaving Portland in \"Grand Theft Auto III\" it becomes extremely dangerous to use the Portland El, as each gang is out to kill the player character.\nLiberty City Subway.\nThe Liberty City Subway is a fully underground rail line dispersed throughout all three of Liberty City's boroughs, serving as an inter-borough link. It provides convenient access to &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt; with a subway station at the complex.\nStations.\nStations along the subway line share close to the same entrance, concourse and platform designs, although there are a few distinctions due to the system using only one track for operational trains. Much like the Portland El, the stations along the line are not named in \"GTA III\", but are in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\". All in all, there are four stations; one in &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;, two in &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;, and one in &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Vale\"&gt;Shoreside Vale&lt;/a&gt;:\nDisused lines.\nIn \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", it is revealed in \"&lt;a href=\"Bringing%20the%20House%20Down\"&gt;Bringing the House Down&lt;/a&gt;\" that a disused portion of subway exists underneath &lt;a href=\"Rockford\"&gt;Rockford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Staunton\"&gt;Fort Staunton&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;. The system, cut off from the rest of the active subway system, consists of two lines, two antiqued subway stations, and two old subway train wrecks (one at the first station and the other at the last station).\nDuring \"Bringing the House Down\", the player is required to drive their explosive-loaded van to the abandoned tracks via a hole from the unfinished Staunton stretch of the &lt;a href=\"Porter%20Tunnel\"&gt;Porter Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;, and plant multiple bombs in the tunnel system directly underneath Fort Staunton to destroy the entire district. The player escapes the explosion through Fort Staunton's subway exit, which is locked outside the mission.\nThe subway system is not accessible otherwise, even with the use of the Porter Tunnel glitch, as the subway does not materialize at the access point from the Porter Tunnel; players who attempt to walk into the void fall indefinitely, while players who drive into the hole will also fall but eventually land back at the Porter Tunnel."}

With 26 stations and eight routes, it is the largest and most complex rapid transit system to appear in the .\nThe system is operated by the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Transport%20Authority\"&gt;Liberty Transport Authority&lt;/a&gt; (LTA). The subway also appears in ; it is inaccessible to the player, yet &lt;a href=\"Subway%20Car\"&gt;trains&lt;/a&gt; still run. About 65% of the network is underground, with the remaining 35% being overground. No platforms on the entire system are staggered and there are also no ground-level stations or tracks, except for the depot. There is no equivalent subway system in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nAll stations in &lt;a href=\"Broker\"&gt;Broker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt; are located above ground; stations in &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;, aside from &lt;a href=\"Frankfort%20High%20Station\"&gt;Frankfort High Station&lt;/a&gt;, are underground, and their entrances are distinguishable by their green iron fencing and attached globe lamps. All stations in the system are operational except one, referred to as &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20Boulevard%20Station\"&gt;Dukes Boulevard station&lt;/a&gt; by a construction notice sign on the station's entrance, along a short stub branch of the Broker Line in &lt;a href=\"East%20Island%20City\"&gt;East Island City&lt;/a&gt;; the line is also connected to the &lt;a href=\"Firefly%20Projects%20Rail%20Yard\"&gt;Firefly Projects Rail Yard&lt;/a&gt;. The cost of using the subway is deducted after the trip (with fares increasing based on the length of the ride, unlike the NYC MTA's single base fare), as the ticket machines and turnstiles are not operable. Subway lines can be seen on the &lt;a href=\"Radar\"&gt;Radar&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HUD\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; as semi-transparent gray lines, with stations marked as square lozenges. If a station is underground, multiple access points will be available from street level, typically depicted in the form of a stairway leading underground surrounded by cast iron grills with lampposts attached in the corners. Some of the city's &lt;a href=\"Tramps\"&gt;homeless&lt;/a&gt; can be found taking shelter in the large junction tunnel under Lancet. Sometimes, the homeless will \"commit suicide\" and wander on the tracks, only to be hit by an oncoming train. These incidents can also happen at stations if a homeless person is on the platform. Normally this happens at &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Station\"&gt;Emerald&lt;/a&gt; subway station.\nThe subway lines in Broker/Dukes and Bohan are available and may be used from the beginning of the game, however as long as Algonquin is locked, only partial use of the train is possible (the Bohan line allowing only a short hop between two stations, for example), even though the trains are still travelling towards Algonquin. Full access to the subway system is granted following the mission &lt;a href=\"Blow%20Your%20Cover\"&gt;Blow Your Cover&lt;/a&gt; when Algonquin is unlocked.\nThe subway is a good way to escape from the police at any &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted levels&lt;/a&gt;. At lower levels, players may still use the train; as the AI is confused by the player entering the train, it may take them outside the wanted zone. However, the use of the subway trains is impossible when the player has a three-star wanted level or more, as the trains will either stop at stations indefinitely, bypass any station the player is in, or are halted wherever they are. This deliberately occurs to prevent the player from either escaping the police or easily unlocking achievements and trophies such as \"One Man Army\".\nAlternatively, the subway tunnels themselves may be effectively used by the player to escape on foot as police officers do not venture into the tunnels unless they spot the player earlier and pursue them into the tunnels. The player may receive a one-star wanted level if they enter the train without sufficient funds to travel.\nSubway trains are not operational, or even available, on &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;. However, access to the tracks is still available and is a useful way to escape the police. Trains\u00a0run on a \"rail\", i.e. they cannot move from their set route, and will not stop for any reason whatsoever unless coded to, even when their path is blocked (e.g. by a vehicle). The coded coordinates of the tracks can be altered with specific programs, by editing the path files.\nDesign.\nLike their real-life counterparts, the stations feature turnstiles and do not accept cash or coinage. Instead of or tokens, the system uses paper tickets sold from ticket machines. The ticket machines resemble their real-life counterpart . The turnstiles, meanwhile, strongly resemble the High Entrance Turnstiles of the MTA, but instead of a rotating arm they use a push bar more commonly found in libraries. The stations also have metal service entry gates (usually open), though only &lt;a href=\"Lynch%20Street%20Station\"&gt;one station is wheelchair accessible&lt;/a&gt;. Token booths are absent, replaced by the ticket machines and an unusually large police presence.\nWhile the real-life subway is powered by electricity, third rail power delivery is only present at the &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20Station\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt; station and in the &lt;a href=\"Firefly%20Projects%20Rail%20Yard\"&gt;Firefly Projects Rail Yard&lt;/a&gt;. This may imply that the trains are equipped with batteries, or it could just be an oversight by the developers. A sign at &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20Station\"&gt;Francis International Airport Station&lt;/a&gt; contains the warning \"Avoid third rail track, or you'll get zapped\", indicating that at least some trains run on electricity. However, stepping on the third rail will not electrify the player.\nUnderground.\nThe underground stations feature tiled walls and platform pillars, similar to the style of the BMT and IRT divisions of the New York City Subway. Stations are identified with dark blue signs with white text of the station name. While the tunnels between stations have very low clearance, the stations have very high ceilings (with the mezzanines visible from platform level).\nThe entrance stairs bear a strong resemblance to their real-life counterparts, including the dark green metal design and distinctive globe entrance lamps.\nElevated.\nThe elevated lines are very similar to their real-life counterparts, except that they are noticeably wide. Each line has two tracks, but have a third middle trackway unoccupied, while the structures are wide enough to fit at least two additional tracks (for an express service). Most stations resemble typical elevated stations, except for &lt;a href=\"Lynch%20Street%20Station\"&gt;Lynch Street&lt;/a&gt; (which is based on the Forest Hills Long Island Rail Road Station) and &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20Station\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt; (based on the stations of the JFK AirTrain).\nTrains.\nThe subway trains consist of either two or three heavily graffitied cars and have black and white internal CCTV cameras which the player automatically views while on the train.\nLike in and , it is impossible to destroy trains during gameplay. Trains are scripted to be decoupled in the mission &lt;a href=\"For%20the%20Man%20Who%20Has%20Everything\"&gt;For the Man Who Has Everything&lt;/a&gt;, derailed in &lt;a href=\"No%20Way%20on%20the%20Subway\"&gt;No Way on the Subway&lt;/a&gt;, and destroyed in &lt;a href=\"Bang%20Bang\"&gt;Bang Bang&lt;/a&gt;. There are no visible drivers on the trains, and trains cannot be commandeered by the player unless done so via game modifications. Like other games, trains will not stop for the player if they are on the tracks.\nTrain Conductors.\nIt is possible that there were actual train conductors controlling the trains in the early beta of the game, theoretically allowing them to be stolen and operated by the player and disproving the fact that trains would run in a scripted method.\nIn the game files, there is a model named M_M_TRAIN_01, which is accessible and controllable by certain trainers. The model even has variations for clothes and accessories (hats and glasses).\nThere are also recordings for the unused model. There are exactly 113 files. \"Walkie Talkie\" recorded files also exist. During one of these recordings, he says that he saw \"a rat the size of a pitbull in the tunnels\". The train conductor model also seems to have a slightly similar appearance to overweight LCPD officers.\nThe train conductors have been scrapped and the developers textured the train's cab windows with black tint, but remains can be found in the train models too; a seat and dashboard in the driver's cab.\nLines.\nThe subway system has four main lines, in pairs:\nThese four lines serve all the boroughs of Liberty City, but do not serve the state of &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbandoned Railway Lines.\nIt is possible that the Liberty City Subway may have shared the tracks with (now defunct) freight trains in the past, as well as having a completely different route (possibly reserved for the freight trains).\n&lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn western &lt;a href=\"East%20Island%20City\"&gt;East Island City&lt;/a&gt;, exists a section of railway that leads from a bricked up tunnel west toward Algonquin, and stops facing that &lt;a href=\"Humboldt%20River\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting a bridge (possibly a replica, since it heads towards to &lt;a href=\"Charge%20Island\"&gt;Charge Island&lt;/a&gt; and is part of the subway) or waterside ferry/train transfer terminal may have at one point existed.\n&lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is an &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20Disused%20Subway%20Spur\"&gt;abandoned portion of an old railway&lt;/a&gt; in the west along &lt;a href=\"Westminster\"&gt;Westminster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Meat%20Quarter\"&gt;The Meat Quarter&lt;/a&gt;, running\u00a0from the plaza of a new building (blocked off by construction barricades) through several buildings before splitting up. One section runs into a garage in a building (supporting the fact that it may have been used for freight), and the other leads to a broken-off edge forming a ramp. This stretch references the real-life freight railway in New York City, which ran in the corresponding areas of Manhattan (Meatpacking District, Greenwich Village, Chelsea, and Hell's Kitchen) from the 1930s to the 1980s and in real life has become a park.\n&lt;a href=\"Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral disused tracks and railcars also dot industrial areas in &lt;a href=\"Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;. These include two abandoned rail depots (one that has been almost completely torn down), several sections of track (mostly running through old alleyways), a section of track running by the old &lt;a href=\"Sprunk%20Factory\"&gt;Sprunk Factory&lt;/a&gt; that splits up, with one side leading into a bricked-up tunnel. There is also a rail line running from a bricked-up tunnel running from southern &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20City\"&gt;Alderney City&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Normandy\"&gt;Normandy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Port%20Tudor\"&gt;Port Tudor&lt;/a&gt;, finally ending on an incline with several old pillars present on the other end (suggesting a bridge or elevated line) near northern &lt;a href=\"Acter%20Industrial%20Park\"&gt;Acter Industrial Park&lt;/a&gt;. A section of this track also runs onto one of the piers in Port Tudor. This track is mostly intact, though several newer structures (roads, buildings) have been built over it.\nOther.\nThere also are two unused subway tunnels in the &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt; side of the network that form connections between two other lines, but are not part of regular subway routes: These include the tunnel which connects North Park Station to West Park Station and one which connects West Park Station to Frankfort High Station. Also, within the junction tunnel under Lancet, there are tracks that connect Easton Station to Manganese East Station. These tunnels would technically be used for alternative routes or for maintenance work, though there is no such in-game activity.\nDialogue.\nOn every station and train, the intercom voice is a pleasant woman:\n\"\"This is the J train. The Next Stop is: Manganese West Station.\" Heard when the train is about to depart a station.\nAlthough, if the player attracts a 3 star Wanted Level and the vehicle is stopped by the police, a man will say:\n\"This train terminates here, all change.\"\nThis is an example of an approach announcement, spoken by the woman:\n\"The Train is approaching Castle Gardens station.\" \nWhen a train is approaching a station, the following line is spoken by the woman:\n\"The train approaching is the 3 train, bound for Schottler Station.\"\"\nWhen approaching Easton Station:\n\"\"The Train is approaching Easton station...\" 1.) \"...Transfer is available to the B,C,E &amp; K Train.\" \"(if riding on the Algonquin outer line)\" 2.) \" ...Transfer is available to the 3,8,A &amp; J Train.\" \"(if riding on the Algonquin Inner Line)\nWhen the train stops at the current station:\n\"This is Easton Station\""}

Asuka wants Mike to bring back the truck driver so she can punish him and the truck full of bad blowfish for evidence. She warns Mike, however, that he can only punch the truck drivers to 'persuade' them to co-operate, as their union would sue her also. Mike leaves Asuka's and drives to a location in Bedford Point. He damages a delivery truck and confronts the driver, beating him until he relents after having his jaw broke by Mike.

The truck driver initially refuses to come with Mike to Asuka's, knowing he'll likely be punished. After being beaten up he reluctantly agrees to go with Mike, although Mike can kill the truck driver. Mike drives the delivery truck, and the truck driver if he is spared, to Asuka's. If the truck driver is delivered to Asuka's alive, she tells Mike that she will show 'mercy' by plucking his eyes out of his sockets before she feeds him to the blowfish.

You in a pantsuit. An everywoman. A hard-working single mother of two with a nanny, of course, and a well-meaning pillar of her community. Someone who sees the injustice and inequality all around her and wants to do something about it. A politician. A liberal who knows what conservatives want. She wears pants because she's too busy to shave. She's also going to start talking in the first person.\"\n\"I spent 15 hard, happy years working as a teacher in the San Andreas school system, an experience that improved me in so many ways, I treat everyone like children in my class. I interrupt. I speak way too loudly. I patronize, speaking slowly like you have the brain of a fourth grader. I liked being surrounded by uneducated juveniles who despised and feared me. So I got into politics. A school classroom is a microcosm of society. There is the bully. There is the girl who is developing faster than she should and making everyone uncomfortable. There's the nerd. And the whole thing descends into a shit-flinging rat's nest of greed, sexual frustration, bullying and prejudice. Just like Congress. That's where I come in.\"\n\"I'm just a normal middle class girl who married an obscenely rich man and stood up for what she deserved in divorce court. Do I feel guilty sometimes? Of course, that's what motivates me. Would I pay an additional 30% in taxes if I could? In a heartbeat, and I'm committed to investing an equivalent amount in a campaign that supports the necessary fiscal reforms to make that happen. 30% means nothing to me - and it shouldn't to you either. If you love something, you give it money. I told my ex-husband that all the time. And then I caught him with the housekeeper. Like any woman, I turned off the faucet of sex after the contract was signed. And now I'm ready to sign a contract with our great state and be your next governor.\""}

However, as of the &lt;a href=\"Valentine%27s%20Day%202020\"&gt;Valentine's Day 2020&lt;/a&gt; event, it became available for purchase.\nInfluence.\nThe Sugoi is based on the , with a lot of influence taken from the as seen in the bonnet, front bumper, and side view. The diffuser and the exhausts might have been inspired by the . The shape of the tail lights seems to be reminiscent of the .\nDesign.\nThe Sugoi is distinguished by featuring sporty elements and aggressive looks in a rather conventional design, having a black splitter at the bottom with small fins on the outer edges, and a set of mesh intakes above, with the outer ones having horizontal separations with light strips on them. The grille and headlamp arrangement on the upper area gives the car a strong similarity to the &lt;a href=\"Jester\"&gt;Jester&lt;/a&gt; (a sportscar also manufactured by Dinka) and has a black detail surrounding them, with the manufacturer emblem on the centre of the grille. The bonnet has a wide intake and opens to reveal the engine bay with a black detail around it.\nThe sides of the car have concave formations running through the lower sides and a set of black skirts, which have a coloured detail across the whole component and small fins on the rearmost portions, as well as vertical exit vents just beside the front doors. The wheel arches are generally wide with a flat around the wheel, with the rear ones slightly protruding from the rest of the car. The cabin area has black window trim and inner pillars and coloured mirror wings mounted near the A-pillars, which have a black horizontal detail on them. The roof features a single vortex generator and two black strips separating the same roof panel from the rest of the car.\nOn the rear end, the boot is relatively bulky and features a lip spoiler on top, along with the central license plate on the dedicated section and the Dinka emblem above the plate. Said boot has a large compartment that opens to reveal a black luggage cover. A set of stylised C-shaped tail lights can be seen on the outer sides, with the turning signals and reverse lights located in a triangle shape. On the lower area, the rear bumper extends a bit further and features a set of rear exit vents on either side, as well as a black section encompassing the lower rear and part of the underside, with four small blades and the twin exhaust tubes centred on the car.\nThe interior of the car is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Jugular\"&gt;Jugular&lt;/a&gt;, which is a derivative of the interior used in cars like the &lt;a href=\"Nero\"&gt;Nero&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"XA-21\"&gt;XA-21&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"V-STR\"&gt;V-STR&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Revolter\"&gt;Revolter&lt;/a&gt;, with rear seats similar to cars like the &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Diamond\"&gt;Super Diamond&lt;/a&gt; (albeit having head rests). However, it uses the same dial set from the &lt;a href=\"Komoda\"&gt;Komoda&lt;/a&gt;, which is also a derivative of the ones used in cars like the &lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe car's bodywork and the interior stitching is painted in a primary colour, while the details on the side skirts are painted in a secondary colour. A trim colour is also available for the interior, being applied to the dashboard, the horn cap, part of the doors and the seats. It uses ten-spoke rims with a circular detail on the centre, wrapped in low-profile tyres. The rims can also support a dedicated colour, although only naturally-generated examples from &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; or the one rewarded in the &lt;a href=\"Lucky%20Wheel\"&gt;Lucky Wheel&lt;/a&gt; may have a black colour.\nPerformance.\nThe Sugoi has a fair amount of wheelspin before it can take off, though while it does have a good amount of acceleration and top speed, it tends to fishtail uncontrollably when turning at fast speeds despite its FWD feature, unless brakes or a handbrake is applied. Its durability is average at best and is overall still relatively outmatched by other Sports cars with much better performance, especially in terms of tackling corners.\nThe Sugoi is powered by a V8 engine, as suggested by the cover, powering the front wheels through a 6-speed gearbox. Its engine sound is identical to the one from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Bifta\"&gt;Bifta&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;."}

It also has 5-spoke rims with a pentagon-shaped centre.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nNow manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Karin\"&gt;Karin&lt;/a&gt;, the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" Sultan draws upon the Japanese import styling of the previous Sultan. Its general body shape is partly based on the (Toyota Altezza), but its prevalence of sharper characteristics lends it a much more striking form. Certain elements such as the rear lamp units are inspired by the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution V. Other elements (such as the bonnet and spoiler of the Korean Mob variant) bear resemblance to the . Interestingly, ordinary Sultans come with blued exhaust tips, similar to the titanium tips on the &lt;a href=\"Futo\"&gt;Futo GT&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"GTA IV\", the Sultan has the most variety in spawning colours, including wheel colours. The car is prominently painted with the primary colour, while the lower sides of it is painted in a secondary colour (prominently painted black or in some cases, grey of light grey). The wheels have 5-spoke rims and are prominently painted white, except for a set with a gold colour.\nThe Sultan is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; system with a male voice, but only if the player leaves the \"selected cars\" (default) option in the audio menu.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars\".\nThe Sultan's body is resembled as a . Compared to other \"GTA\" games, the Sultan carries the &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20RS\"&gt;Sultan RS&lt;/a&gt;'s speed, and spoiler from \"GTA IV\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Sultan reappears in \"GTA V\", mostly unchanged in terms of appearance. The only difference is that its colour distribution changed, as the secondary colour is applied on the bonnet, roof and boot, as well as on the sides in the form of thin stripes. Its interior is also decorated with stitching on the seats and steering wheel, which matches with the primary colour. The car features black wheels by default (which actually gives a darker tone).\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe Sultan has a small, yet powerful turbocharged engine, and a four wheel drive drivetrain. Its performance is relatively strong in comparison with all of the sports coup\u00e9s and super-cars in the game, whilst its grippy four wheel drive system makes it particularly controllable; it is less prone to spinning out than the rear wheel drive cars, making it a good car for Gymkhana or cross-country road trip. The Sultan is the fastest four-door car in the game.\nMuch like its real-life counterpart, the Sultan makes for an excellent offroad vehicle as well. Its low ground clearance can be an hinderance offroad, but this can be rectified by adding &lt;a href=\"Hydraulics\"&gt;Hydraulics&lt;/a&gt;. The only drawback of the Sultan is its poor build quality. The Sultan's front or back can be deformed even in low speed collisions with other vehicles.\nPlayers favor the Sultan for drive-by attacks, due to its four seat capacity and its ability to outrun rival gang or police vehicles, as it has supreme handling.\nIt weighs 1400 kg like some 2-door rivals.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Sultan remains fast, grippy, engaging and easy to drive. Like all past Sultan models (and most Subarus) the \"GTA IV\" Sultan is AWD (40% front/ 60% rear torque distribution), providing superior traction and handling over other cars of the same class. While many similarly sized sedans offer similar straight line performance, the added stability of the Sultan allows fast cornering and easy power sliding, making it a good choice for races or getaways (and one of the best 4-door cars in the game). The soft suspension makes it roll over easily when turning. Under-steer is a factor, but the powerful engine and quick handling make it sporty and fun to drive. Although the engine is not the most durable, considering its speed, body deformation is average. Non-tuned Sultans come with alarms, the most popular forms being the horn and beep versions.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars\".\nThe Sultan in similarity to \"GTA IV\" carries the same speed and steering, but mostly based of traits from the &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20RS\"&gt;Sultan RS&lt;/a&gt;. Also compared to other sedans, the Sultan can do burnouts more easily.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nReturning to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", the car remains one of the best 4-door cars in the game. It is a very good all-around car with above-average speed, acceleration, traction and handling and because of its AWD nature, the Sultan can easily surpass most off-road vehicles, especially when upgraded. The car suffers from a small amount of understeer when taking corners at high speed. Its durability is average. Braking, however, is this vehicle's weakness, taking a long time to slow or fully stop the vehicle. Additionally, the car does not handle particularly well when braking through a corner.\nThe Sultan is an extremely close competitor to the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;, being able to compete very closely with one in a race (though both are rather off the pace in the sports class as a whole).\nThe engine is modeled as a twin-cam inline-6. With the \"Roll Cage and Chassis Upgrade\" modification installed, two turbochargers are fitted on one side of the engine.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nBeing classified as a \"tuner\" car, the Sultan can only be modified at &lt;a href=\"Wheel%20Arch%20Angels\"&gt;Wheel Arch Angels&lt;/a&gt;; and like all cars of its class, the range of body kits, rims and spoilers are the same, the only distinction being its three unique customized body paint schemes.\nIt is interesting to note that while Paintjob 1 and Paintjob 3 of the customized body paint schemes are of original designs, Paintjob 2 is a blue and yellow rally-like scheme similar to that of the ."}

However, as of the &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20Classic%20Week\"&gt;Sultan Classic Week&lt;/a&gt; event, it became available for purchase.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Sultan Classic acts as a classic predecessor of the original &lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt; and, at the same time, an &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; equivalent to its &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; rendition. It is primarily based on the , with major influence from the , seen primarily in the front fascia. The front bumper somewhat resembles the one found on the , although with smaller side vents and with additional fog lights. The tail light layout is similar to the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle assumes a more traditional design compared to the original Sultan, but it keeps the four-door layout and sporty appearance from its successor. The front bumper of the car features a rectangular mesh intake spanning about half the car's width and a central number plate mounted in front of it, while the outer sections have smaller intakes with unusable circular fog lamps. On the upper area, the car has a trapezium-shaped grille bearing the manufacturer logo on the centre, followed by silver/chrome housings with rectangular headlamps and small amber indicators. The bonnet is relatively simple, featuring two elevated lines starting from each side of the grille, slightly curving outwards as they approach the windscreen. The same also opens to reveal the engine bay and a strut brace.\nOn the sides, the car has concave shapes above the side skirts, as well as thin ridges passing through the doors, painted door handles, and rectangular marker lamps on the front fenders, near the front doors. The cabin area makes use of frameless doors with black fittings around the windows and painted mirror wings near the A-pillars, along with black lines separating the roof panel from the rest of the car.\nOn the rear, the car has a simple boot lid with silver lettering on each side and a spoiler mounted on top, while the outer sections have rectangular tail lamps with slight transparency, each one consisting of upper red lamps, lower white lamps and outer amber indicators. The bumper has ridged detail on the upper side and a dedicated section on the centre intended for the number plate, while a single titanium exhaust can be seen on the driver side, below the bumper. Its interior is the same used primarily on the Sultan, but featuring the Karin logo on the horn cap.\nThe vehicle's bodywork, engine cover and interior stitching are painted in a primary colour, while the mirror wings are painted in secondary. The stock wheels are identical to the \"Apex\" tuner wheels seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nAcceleration and top speed are very good like any sports sedan car, but in terms of top speed, it is outclassed by most high end sports cars in the game, especially the &lt;a href=\"Pariah\"&gt;Pariah&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Itali%20GTO\"&gt;Itali GTO&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20900R\"&gt;Banshee 900R&lt;/a&gt;. Lowering the suspension makes the car prone to wheelspin, subsequently making it hard to control. Being an AWD car, it can do well in off-roading if the suspension is not upgraded.\nThe Sultan Classic is powered by a 6-cylinder, twin-cam engine fitted with twin turbochargers, which is stated to be a 3.5L engine. This engine is coupled to a 5-speed gearbox and powers all four wheels with equal torque distribution. Its engine sound is similar to that of the Sultan RS, with a slightly different pitch.

{"id": "9843", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9843", "title": "Sultan RS", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Karin\"&gt;Karin&lt;/a&gt; Sultan RS is a rally sports car featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the &lt;a href=\"January%202016%20Update\"&gt;January 2016 Update&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe vehicle itself is based on the (also known as the Toyota Altezza), with a few minor influences drawn from a range of (notably the Impreza 2.5RS coupe). Although the Lexus IS never received a two-door coup\u00e9 configuration, its influence remains obvious in the Sultan RS. The front and the overall shape of the car closely resembles that of a 2001 Lexus IS with a body kit and side exhaust system. The massive rear spoiler is usually a stock feature on the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution and Subaru Impreza WRX STI models. The rear of the car is highly reminiscent of the , inluding said spoiler.\nThe Sultan RS is a high-performance two-door coup\u00e9 variant of the &lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt;. The letters RS stand for \"Rally Sport\", which usually designates that the car is a highly-tuned, rally-sports version of the stock model. The car comes with a carbon-fibre bonnet, roll cage, side exit large-bore exhaust, front-mounted intercooler, rear diffuser, racing wheels, and low-profile tyres. Some variants also have a carbon fibre boot lid, bonnet scoop, and metallic paint. By default, it has an exposed intercooler manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Endo\"&gt;Endo&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe is usually set to spawn with a primary colour on the body, with the side stripes painted by the secondary colour, and the roof, boot and spoiler in a tertiary colour, usually resulting in a single-tone variation with stripes or a two-tone variation with stripes, with the exception of a single colour set that gives it a full-black colour with no stripes. Its wheels always have a black colour.\nThe vehicle is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; system with a female voice, but only if the player leaves the \"selected cars\" (default) option in the audio menu.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Sultan RS returns in the enhanced version of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the &lt;a href=\"January%202016%20Update\"&gt;January 2016 Update&lt;/a&gt;, as an optional modification for the &lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Benny%27s%20Original%20Motor%20Works\"&gt;Benny's Original Motor Works&lt;/a&gt;. It holds the same design as in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", albeit with some cosmetic changes (notably the bumpers and the grille) and a few omissions, which can be fitted in Benny's Original Motor Works.\nIts colour distribution seemed to be changed over the \"GTA IV\" iteration. The primary one is set to the bodywork and interior stitching, while the secondary one is applied on the bonnet, roof and boot. A trim colour is also present for part of the door panels and seats, along with a dial colour. The stock wheels retained the same rim design as before, which are identical to the \"Gruppe Z\" tuner rims available at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle has access to a variety of tuning modifications, as well as unique liveries and vinyls, which also allows the player to recreate the \"GTA IV\" iteration.\nAs of the update, the timing belt and cam pulleys of the \"Vernier Pulleys\" options are fully-animated, and rotate accordingly when idle or revving up the engine.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe car's top speed is one of the highest due to the mighty power of its turbocharged engine. The car also accelerates like no other car in the game. As shown on the rocker cover badging and the model marque on the boot, it has a 3.5-litre engine according to the badges, with the model of a turbocharged DOHC straight-4 engine. The badges state that the car is twin turbocharged, however the in-game model only features one turbo.\nThe Sultan RS utilizes an all-wheel drive system (30% front, 70% rear torque distribution balance, according to files), to which the extraordinary off-the-line acceleration owes itself. The Sultan RS has a much lower ground clearance than the &lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt;, which aids the superb cornering ability on the road. The car drives very well on asphalt, although a bit slippery and at times hard to control at high speeds. It is also great on dirt and sand, as should be expected for a car drawing inspiration from rally cars designed for such conditions. The car, as with most vehicles, features an anti-lock braking system, however the Sultan RS is one the select few that does tend to lock-up on occasions, particularly under constant brake pressure, meaning the player should avoid holding the brakes to ensure efficient braking times and to retain steering control.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buffalo\"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"F620\"&gt;F620&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bullet%20GT\"&gt;Bullet GT&lt;/a&gt;, the exhaust system of the Sultan RS is prone to letting unburnt fuel explode in flames from the sidepipe during throttle liftoff after high revving. The RS is also equipped with a dump (blowoff) valve on the turbo which causes a whipping/hissing sound when the throttle is released.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Sultan RS improves upon the original with vastly superior acceleration and a slightly higher top speed, while retaining the all-wheel drive system (25% front, 75% rear torque distribution balance, according to files). Braking power is significantly improved as well, enough so it is on par with other Supers. It handles very similarly to the standard counterpart, being grippy and engaging - yet unlike the normal version, it's also easier to spin out. Off-road, the Sultan RS performs excellently, with next to no speed or handling loss while driving off-road. In fact, due to its lightweight construction and powerful all-wheel-drive system, the Sultan RS is highly adept at climbing steep slopes, and can even summit Mount Chiliad with ease. Crash deformation is poor, however, given the lighter build.\nUnlike its \"GTA IV\" counterpart, the engine is modeled as a twin-cam inline-6, lacking the turbocharger by default (though it can be fitted in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;). It emits a unique, aggressive engine noise, similar to the tune used in \"GTA IV\". It produces a large amount of torque sent through a 6-speed transmission to all four wheels. Just like in \"GTA IV\", the dump valve sound is present, but to a lesser extent until upgraded. The exhaust arrangement is the same as in \"GTA IV\" by default, being single side-exit, but now in a 6-1 (6 to 1) exhaust manifold organisation rather than a 4-1. Its extreme valve timing causes a large amount of back firing, and when upgraded further it will produce a large amount of dump-valve sound with an increased rate of back firing.\nSpecial Variants.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", the Sultan RS is a frequently used car to transport/protect drugs in the &lt;a href=\"Drug%20Wars\"&gt;Drug Wars&lt;/a&gt;. Many of these have a unique paint-job, which may include two-tone roofs and boot/trunk lids.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", a regular &lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt; can be modified to resemble the Sultan RS, however the modifications are purely cosmetic.\n\"GTA Online\": Import/Export.\n3 heavily modified variants of the Sultan RS may appear in &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt; source missions. Each variant has a unique license plate number, colour combination and different set of bodywork modifications.\n\"GTA Online\": Steal Vehicle Cargo - Race Bet.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", Sultan RS's and &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20900R\"&gt;Banshee 900R&lt;/a&gt;s spawn after the \"&lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo/Steal%20Missions%23Race%20Bet\"&gt;Race Bet&lt;/a&gt;\" Steal &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt; mission. These custom cars will tail the player after they steal the vehicle. They spawn in these specific colors with these specific modifications. The cars will spawn in pairs. Whether they spawn with extras (the roof and the seat bars for the Banshee 900R) is completely random. There is two variations of each car."}

The interior can be also modified to feature additional analog gauges, digital displays and numerous switches, in a similar manner to race-type cars such as the &lt;a href=\"RE-7B\"&gt;RE-7B&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ETR1\"&gt;ETR1&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike the regular version, the vehicle's bodywork, engine cover and interior stitching are painted in a primary colour, while the mirror wings are painted in secondary. A trim colour is also available for part of the interior, as well as a dial colour.

Said engine is also coupled to a 5-speed gearbox and powers all four wheels, albeit with a torque distribution of 40% to the front and 60% to the rear (different to the four-door variant or its modern counterpart, but identical to the regular &lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt;). Its engine sound is identical to the one from its four-door variant, being similar to that of its modern iteration, with a slightly different pitch.\nOverall, its handling and speed are comparable with the &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20Classic\"&gt;Sultan Classic&lt;/a&gt;, having the same competitive prowess in racing, both on and off-road, with its tight turning radius, 4WD capability, and excellent acceleration."}

Construction of the new dealership was done by &lt;a href=\"T.U.M.E.%20Construction\"&gt;T.U.M.E. Construction&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy 1986, the new showroom has been completed, with the old dealership demolished and being replaced by a vacant lot, with the adjacent trailer park also being cleared and replaced by a vacant lot. The dealership is bought by retired footballer &lt;a href=\"BJ%20Smith%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;BJ Smith&lt;/a&gt; and renamed BJ's Used Autos. However, Smith quickly runs into financial difficulties and the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; begin to monitor his activities, so he sells the dealership to &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt; for $50,000. Once purchased by Vercetti, the dealership reverts to its original name. Vercetti uses the showroom to sell stolen cars from four lists. Once all the requested vehicles have been retrieved, the business generates an income of $9,000.\nLandscape Features.\nIn 1986, Sunshine Autos features a modern two-floor showroom.

The car also takes design elements from the , as seen in the headlights, tail lights, vertical grille bar design, and side profile. Unlike its real-life counterpart, the Super Diamond does not feature rear suicide doors.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\", the wheels are based on the .\nDesign.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nThe Super Diamond features a rather boxy design with luxury features and ample room. In the front fascia, the car sports a large 10 element rectangular grille finished in chrome. On the top of the grille is a sculpture meant to replicate the bonnet ornament found mounted on the grille of many Rolls-Royce cars. From the grille, the initial bonnet is raised with chrome lining representing this clear bulge; these lines run diagonally along the bonnet to the A-pillars of the car. The Super Diamond has square headlamp units with twin circular main beams. Underneath the units are the LED indicator strips matching the width of the headlamp units. Under the grille, three air flow grilles are found, with the center matching the width of the initial radiator cooling grille. These are fitted with a mesh pattern unlike the main grille. The license plate is mounted directly in the center.\nThe side of the vehicle allows the chrome line from the bonnet to proceed to the very last pillar of the car where it meets with a small window channel. Being a luxury 4-door saloon, the car sports a long wheelbase, and as such offers a large amount of room for passengers. As a result of the wheelbase, the side profiling features large windows. The vehicle sports a chrome B-pillar along with the chrome finishing around the window channels.\nIn the rear fascia, the vehicle sports a large boot with an additional un-retracted aerial found to the right hand side of the boot. The boot itself features a chrome panel, possibly acting as a handle, directly above the license plate which is recessed. Like the front headlamps, the rear lights consist of the unit with twin circular lights. Underneath, again, are the LED indicator strips. At the base of the car are the twin-exit square exhaust tips.\nThe car features an interior similar to the &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt;'s, but is covered by tan leather and has no logo on the steering wheel. Super Diamonds are seen in a variety of single colours, and uses a set of wheels identical to the ones of the &lt;a href=\"Oracle%20XS\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Super Diamond is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; system with a female voice, but only if the player leaves the \"selected cars\" (default) option in the audio menu.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nReturning to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", the car retains its original luxury style and brown leather interior, thus remains to be based on the Rolls-Royce Phantom. In the enhanced version, however, it gains a restored interior, sporting a luxury beige leather finish based on the one used in the &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt;, also found on the &lt;a href=\"Carbonizzare\"&gt;Carbonizzare&lt;/a&gt;.\nAgain, the car can spawn with a variety of primary colours for the body and the stitches on the interior. It also uses six-spoke alloy rims with medium-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nThe Super Diamond has a considerable top speed, and is also capable of accelerating rather fast considering its weight. The handling is fairly good for a vehicle when taking short turns. Longer turns will result in the car starting to drift, and its continuation will eventually result in the car spinning out of control. Crash deformation is good, lasting for about 3 to 4 direct hits before the vehicle starts to smoke or ignites. Overall body and engine integrity is on par with the &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20%28car%29\"&gt;Dukes (car)&lt;/a&gt;. Braking while turning will often lead to understeer, then possible oversteer. However, unlike the vast majority of vehicles in \"GTA IV\", the Super Diamond in \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" lacks the characteristics of an anti-lock braking system; under braking power at high speeds, steering the vehicle has no effect, unlike where many other cars would gradually steer to the left/right when steering under braking. This also applies to its &lt;a href=\"Super%20Drop%20Diamond\"&gt;Drop&lt;/a&gt; variant.\nThe Super Diamond has a modeled twin-cam turbocharged inline-4 engine, which powers the rear wheels in an FR drivetrain layout and a 6-speed gearbox configuration. Its engine sound is generally smooth and low-revving like most luxury cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Admiral&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cognoscenti\"&gt;Cognoscenti&lt;/a&gt;. However, its has a unique engine tone, also shared with the Drop variant.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Super Diamond is a powerful car, with very high acceleration and top speed for the class. It is very good in a straight line, to such a point it challenges some Sports cars in drag races. However, the Super Diamond's massive weight and long wheelbase provides for a very lethargic, understeer-heavy car. This is only worsened by being in a class which has very good handling standard, that makes the Super Diamond vastly inferior to most other Sedans from a practical standpoint. Braking is meager because of its heavy weight. Crash deformation is remarkably strong, and can take several direct hits without failing or causing the wheels to camber negatively. The Super Diamond's gearbox is somewhat downgraded from its previous rendition, becoming only a 5-speed gearbox, lacking the 6th gear available in \"TBoGT\". Still, the bulk and weight of the Super Diamond is strong enough to detach the wheels of other cars upon impact.\nIn the previous gen version, the Super Diamond shares its engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Oracle\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oracle%20XS\"&gt;Oracle XS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Schwartzer\"&gt;Schwartzer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Intruder\"&gt;Intruder&lt;/a&gt;, while in the enhanced version, the engine sound is shared with the &lt;a href=\"FQ%202\"&gt;FQ 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Surano\"&gt;Surano&lt;/a&gt;. It sounds rather flat and underpowered, yet actually delivers a great amount of power to what is a very heavy vehicle. However, this is consistent with its body design, as Rolls-Royce makes vehicles that, for the sake of luxury, are famously quiet even at high speeds and high engine loads.\nNPC-Modified Variants.\nModded.\nModified Super Diamonds may spawn with specific colors and custom High End \"Split Ten\" rims, as well as with unique window tint. It occasionally spawns at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Golf%20Club\"&gt;Los Santos Golf Club&lt;/a&gt; in both \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\". It will always spawn in the same parking spot. As there are three variants, there is a 1 in 3 chance of each variant spawning.\nThe vehicle can spawn at any time of day. The player can seed the other variants to spawn if they are already driving one of the variants.\nLocations.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nThe Super Diamond only begins to spawn in traffic after completing all of the storyline missions. It still is in fact a very rare sight, but tends to spawns in a select few places:"}

The car is, however, marginally longer than the hardtop, necessitated by the car retaining all four seats (the front seats are roomier than those of the Super Diamond), though the car can only seat two passengers in-game due to the lack of a third and fourth door. It also features some minor changes compared to the hardtop version, seen in the lack of chrome detailing along the bonnet, different door handles, and different side mirror placement, caused by the reinforcement of the A-pillar. It also now shares the wheel design with the &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt;. The premium interior is identical to its four-door counterpart, which in turn is very similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Benefactor\"&gt;Benefactor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe car spawns exclusively with a golden chrome finish, complementing its gloss beige bonnet and an optional black vinyl roof, the latter often being deployed when raining or at night. Like many vehicles in the game, the car has no reverse lights.\nThe Super Drop Diamond is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; system with a female voice, but only if the player leaves the \"selected cars\" (default) option in the audio menu.\nCurrent Design Gallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nTop Up=\nTop Down=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nPerformance.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nMuch like the Super Diamond, the 'Drop' version features a modeled twin-cam inline 4 with a large turbocharger engine driving the rear wheels, but this engine has a higher power/torque output to compensate for the aerodynamic hindrances which naturally occur when turning a hardtop car into a convertible.\nThis vehicle is exceedingly rapid and surprisingly agile for a vehicle of these dimensions, feeling impossibly superior in terms of performance to most other cars in \"GTA IV\". The top speed and acceleration performance is identical to the Super Diamond. The exceptionally wide and grippy tyres result in this leviathan being able to out-maneuver even the sportiest of cars.\nUnlike the vast majority of vehicles in \"GTA IV\", the Super Drop Diamond in \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" lacks the characteristics of an anti-lock braking system; under braking power at high speeds, steering the vehicle has no effect, unlike where many other cars would gradually steer to the left/right when steering under braking. This also applies to its standard variant."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Dewbauchee\"&gt;Dewbauchee&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA IV\".\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\", the Super GT is one of the more original designs that combines various influences. One particular car, the , a homologated version of the , which is a race modified , appears to have served as the primary inspiration for this vehicle. The Super GT's front bumper and spoiler seem to have been borrowed from the . Additionally, the body of the Super GT takes some inspiration from the . The bonnet seems to be taken from the , while the tail lights are similar to those of the .\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"GTA IV\", the SuperGT is a grand tourer largely based on the , as seen in the front fascia and side profile, boot, and wheel design. The front bumper intake is similar to the , while the grille's shape, bonnet, and some additional elements are taken from the . The front headlights seem to be inspired by the . The side vents and rear fascia appear to bear a resemblance to those of the ; however, the size of the side vents is closer to that of the X150.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Super GT can be modified at &lt;a href=\"TransFender\"&gt;TransFender&lt;/a&gt; garages. There are two versions of this car; a hardtop and a targa top. Unlike the similar &lt;a href=\"ZR-350\"&gt;ZR-350&lt;/a&gt;, the Super GT does not have a no-spoiler variant. It is also one of the most expensive cars to import in \"GTA San Andreas\", along with the &lt;a href=\"Bullet\"&gt;Bullet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;, cashing in at $84,000. However, the player is awarded $105,000 when the car is exported in mint condition.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Super GT is available with differing hood designs, either featuring a relatively smooth hood, or one with a low U-shaped ridge. The interior features black leather and carpeting with bucket sports seats. The center console is finished in aluminum trim and features an analog timepiece. \nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Super GT is potentially one of the best racing vehicles, having both excellent acceleration and top speed, as well as a tight turning circle and great responsiveness. However it is held back, as this responsiveness is the vehicle's main significant downside. Combining high responsiveness, a powerful rear-wheel-drive engine, and a 2% front traction bias (according to handling.cfg), makes the vehicle extremely unstable, with a trend for wild fishtailing and dangerous spinouts. The vehicle must be driven with care, as any turn slightly too tight will send it spinning into a wall. One should take care not to use the handbrake, as it will almost immediately lock the rear wheels and break their traction, again causing a spin-out. However, the most experienced players can use its tendency to spinout to drift around corners, albeit with difficulty and a lot of opposite lock.\nThe Super GT is below average for a sports car of its class. It weights 1400 kg according to the handling files, similar to cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ZR350\"&gt;ZR350&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turismo\"&gt;Turismo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"GTA IV\", the SuperGT has a high top speed. The acceleration and speed of the SuperGT are superior to many other cars in the game. The distinct sound of a supercharger can be heard at higher RPMs, which separates it from the other supercars. Also, because of its high horsepower to torque ratio, the car can easily be slid into a drift by a single tap of the e-brake (at moderate enough speeds), making the SuperGT a great choice for drifting.\nIn the hands of a capable driver it makes an ideal getaway car. However, if not handled correctly, the drifts in the corners and the sheer power of the engine while in the heat of the moment can lead to spin outs, loss of control and crashes. This is because of the position of the engine, it is located in front of the driver rather than just in front of the rear axle. As the result, it puts more weight at the front, resulting in massive oversteer. The rather aggressive power distribution is also the factor resulting the oversteer. Because of the front engine, rear-wheel drive layout, stability is also pretty much inferior compared to the other sports cars.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe SuperGT in \"GTA IV\" is notably rare, being mostly available in specific missions, although it can be obtained via a cheat code:"}

When supplies are obtained, staff will begin to strip down the supplies obtained, and create new weapons and projects which will then be sold on. Supplies can also be used as &lt;a href=\"research\"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;; research allows the player to modify new weaponized vehicles added with the Gunrunning update, such as new weaponry, exclusive liveries and bodywork modifications for these vehicles.\nCompleting resupply missions is required to start &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations\"&gt;Mobile Operations&lt;/a&gt;, assuming the player owns a &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt;, in a similar manner to &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt; does to &lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicle%20Work\"&gt;Special Vehicle Work&lt;/a&gt;. There is no way to check how many resupplies have been made, although a percentile rate of success is displayed on the Disruption Logistics computer.\nWhen supplies are brought into the bunker, the level of supplies indicated at the bottom right of the HUD will go up. When the supplies level is full, it can take up to 2 hours for all supplies to be used, and even less time if further upgrades to the Bunker are made.\nSupply missions, along with everything else Gunrunning-related, can be carried out and collected as either a &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Club&lt;/a&gt; member/president, or as a &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organization&lt;/a&gt; associate/CEO.\nSupplies will only be used up, and by consequence, manufacturing/research will not advance while the player is offline. It will continue the next time the player logs into a session.\nBuy Supplies.\nBuying supplies is a simple way of obtaining supplies, and only requires the player to click a button on the web page. The player simply makes the purchase and is free to leave and do other activities, and the stock will be delivered in 10 minutes.\nBuying supplies varies in price but is never free of charge, and can vary between $15,000 and $75,000. The amount purchased is one full bar, or 100 units. The convenience will result in less profit, but arguably can be offset by the time saved for the player.\nSteal Supplies.\nThe other way of obtaining supplies is by stealing them. Stealing supplies is free of charge, but often requires lengthy drives and carefulness upon delivering. A resupply mission can be started in the Resupply menu of Disruption Logistics. Once selected, the player will immediately spawn outside the bunker with their active personal vehicle nearby. Agent 14 will regularly call the player informing them on the situation. Once the phone call has been initiated, a GPS marker indicating the primary location will be marked on the map. Resupply missions can often be as far as 8 miles away, depending on the bunker location, but the first mission will always be relatively easy.\nThe first mission will consist of the player stealing a parked &lt;a href=\"Duneloader\"&gt;Duneloader&lt;/a&gt; loaded with ammunition supplies outside an &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt;. The player can choose to drive the vehicle back, which can take up to 6 minutes depending on the route chosen and the bunker's location, or alternatively use a Cargobob to transport it back. Enemies can sometimes spawn in pairs along the journey back, similar to Vehicle Cargo missions, every once in a while. For this instance and only this instance will the supply bar be completely filled up from one mission.\nStealing supplies is free of charge, like &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt;. The player will always be given 30 minutes to obtain the supplies and bring them back to the bunker. In most circumstances, the player can die as many times as they want, but must note that dying may jeopardize the mission, especially on long journeys back, or during a shootout. There are circumstances where dying will cause the mission to be failed, such as the use of the &lt;a href=\"Railgun\"&gt;Railgun&lt;/a&gt;, where the player's death will result in the supplies being destroyed, and thus the mission failing.\nThere is also the consideration that most resupply missions only fill the supply bar by 1/5th, or 20 units, while a few give 2/5ths, or 40 units\u2014it can take up to five missions to get one full supply bar of 100 units\u2014and assuming the bunker is set to manufacturing only, will convert it into 4 and 8 units of stock. Not only that but while a resupply mission is active, production on stock is paused until the supplies from that mission is brought back to the bunker.\nUnlike &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo\"&gt;Special Cargo&lt;/a&gt; supply missions, Gunrunning Supplies have no cooldown timer after delivery, although the player cannot start another resupply mission if the supply bar is full.\nCompleting a certain amount of steal supply missions will unlock &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations\"&gt;Mobile Operations&lt;/a&gt;, missions launched from the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt;. Even if the player does not own a MOC, completed resupply missions will retroactively unlock the corresponding missions if a MOC is bought in the future.\nSell Supplies.\nOnce the player has created stock from gathered supplies, they are able to export it to buyers. The sell missions work very similar to &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Club&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Business\"&gt;Business&lt;/a&gt; sell missions, while the structure is essentially the same as &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo\"&gt;Special Cargo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ad-Hawk\"&gt;sell missions&lt;/a&gt;. The missions vary in structure, however they all involve dropping and delivering packages across Blaine County and/or Los Santos. "}

The sell missions work very similar to &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Club&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Business\"&gt;Business&lt;/a&gt; sell missions, while the structure is essentially the same as &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo\"&gt;Special Cargo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ad-Hawk\"&gt;sell missions&lt;/a&gt;. The missions vary in structure, however, they all involve dropping and delivering packages across Blaine County and/or Los Santos. In all but one scenario, the player is given 15 minutes to deliver all stock. 30 minutes are given in the exception. \nThe difficulty and length of the mission is dependent on the amount of stock sold, as the player is free to sell all of the stock they have at any time. If the player sells $175,000 or less (base selling amount, fully upgraded bunker. 125,000 when not upgraded at all.) worth of stock, which is 25 units or 25% of the 100 unit stock bar, they will be able to complete the mission on their own. If they sell more than $175,000, more players will be required, similar to other organisation selling missions. Another factor in having other players assist is that they can help protect the shipment from being destroyed by aggressive players. When selling more than $175,000, the player will have to click through a confirmation warning that they may get a mission with multiple vehicles, and should hire additional members beforehand.\nShould a player wish to 'min/max' their stock to the maximum solo sale point of 25%, they could buy a full bar of supplies, wait for $35,000 (5 units worth) of stock to build up, then buy more supplies to top up the supply bar again. An easier 'set and forget' method which would max out at a 24% stock bar would be to complete one steal supply mission for 20 units of supplies/4 units of stock, then once those suppiles are used up, to buy a full bar of supplies.\nThe shipment will be masked from the session for one minute, then afterward the game will announce the shipment is available to be destroyed; other bunker owners will also be texted about 'unsanctioned gun runners' and encouraged to target it.\nPlayers that do destroy it are not given any money from the shipment itself, but instead rewarded $2,000: a minuscule fraction of what most weapon stocks are potentially worth to the seller.\nThe player is able to sell stock to either &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; - as Los Santos is further away, the amount of money made is 50% higher than that of the base (Blaine County) amount (for example, $100,000 worth of stock will sell for $150,000 in Los Santos), although the mission may take slightly longer, \"especially\" if multiple vehicles are given, or if multiple drops are required. \nThe amount of money made depends on the amount of stock created. Cash will still be rewarded if some, but not all, stock is delivered, and an additional 'High Demand' cash bonus will apply if all stock is delivered in busy \"GTA Online\" sessions. This is calculated out as an extra 2.5% of the stock's worth for each rival player that was in the session when delivery is completed.\nSell Missions.\nPhantom Wedge.\nThe stock for delivery is contained in a semi-&lt;a href=\"Trailer%20%28large%29\"&gt;trailer&lt;/a&gt; attached to a &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Wedge\"&gt;Phantom Wedge&lt;/a&gt;, which must reach a drop-off point in 15 minutes.\nWhile the mission has no initial threats, once the global signal ends, the player will be given a 3-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;, and police will quickly begin to give chase.\nThis wanted level cannot be removed and the driver of the truck must use its ability wisely. The police will give up when near the delivery location. The Phantom Wedge is much stronger than regular gameplay, being immune to at least 2 explosions, giving the player a slight advantage against tailing enemies, \"however\", the collision resistance remains the same, and once the engine begins to emit white smoke, the driver will be given a reminder on how to detach the trailer in case the truck is destroyed completely. Also, the trailer has a limited amount of health, and can be destroyed by explosions or if it drowns.\nThe mission is not limited to the Phantom Wedge and the player is able to use a different truck if preferred, even a MOC cab. They are also able to use a &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; to transport the trailer, and it will not despawn unless time runs out. Using a Cargobob, if owned, is heavily recommended if the truck is destroyed, as the need to find another semi cab may waste time. \nUpon dropping off at the location, a cutscene showing a Cargobob descending and collecting the trailer from the truck will be shown. An alternative version of the cutscene without the attached semi-truck plays if the trailer is delivered without the truck attached. \nThis mission is typically given when low levels of stock are sold and usually doesn't require the assistance of another player. However, at higher levels, two trucks will be provided.\nAfter the Arena War update, the Phantom Wedge no longer takes damage from ramming vehicles, hence the difficulty is much lower.\nInsurgent Pick-Up Customs ambushed by Merryweather.\nUp to three &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up%20Custom\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up Custom&lt;/a&gt;s with Medium Armor Plating will be provided to deliver weaponry in 30 minutes to five points, where after a drop is made at each site, will be attacked by &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt; troops with Sanchez bikes, Mesas, Insurgent Pick-Ups, and in locations 4-5, Buzzard Attack Choppers. Each of the Insurgent Pick-Up sale vehicles must make it to the drop-off point given and each Merryweather unit eliminated, or the next point won't be given. Global Signal jammers are provided at each point, as long as none of the trucks leave the area of effect.\nThe Merryweather vehicles cannot be used by the player, but once the NPCs stop and exit the ground vehicles (except for turret gunners), they have a chance to drop cash when killed.\nThere are certain drop-off areas in which there are gangs of one type or another that can become aggroed when firing weapons in their presence, or surrounding property becomes damaged. Although not actually part of the mission, these will likely have to be dealt with.\nIf a player is doing this alone with one Insurgent, they will have to climb up onto the roof and enter the turret gun at each drop in order to use it. As the vehicle can be moved once the drop is made, it is best to maneuver it so the driver side is sheltered by an impenetrable wall or some such to get as much cover as possible while getting out of the driver's seat to make the transition. The player should also learn about how to switch seats for their platform, so that they may 'duck down' into the armored Insurgent for more cover to replenish their health with snacks and put on new &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Body Armor&lt;/a&gt; as necessary. As the windows can be fired through, the player can also choose to use a drive by weapon instead.\nA good strategy is moving the vehicles to the next drop (Check the map below) after dropping off at the current drop and if playing with other players, you split to transport the vehicles while the other kill merryweather.\nDuring the final ambush, the vehicles are locked, the player(s) forced to exit them and only the turret is usable, but there is no longer any timer to worry about, so the players can take their time. Note that it is possible that the final position of the players' Insurgents ends up being disadvantageous locations for the turrets to have a clear line of fire of the Buzzards (such as surrounding objects like trees) which the pilots will take advantage of. Once all enemies are defeated, everyone must leave the area to conclude the sale.\nEach location will have 5 enemy vehicles, as listed below:\n&lt;br&gt;\nInsurgent Pick-Up Customs.\nAn easy mission. Up to three vehicles will be provided, and the players must simply drive the vehicles to the destination in 15 minutes to complete the sale. Unlike the Merryweather ambush, each Insurgent can have a different drop-off point. Once all Insurgents are delivered, the sale ends. Each Insurgent only needs to be delivered to one location. The sale is similar to the Phantom Wedge example otherwise.\nThe players may encounter three circumstance shortly after entering one of the Insurgents.\nDune FAV.\nThe player is provided with a &lt;a href=\"Dune%20FAV\"&gt;Dune FAV&lt;/a&gt; that has been modified with a passenger operated 7.62 mm Minigun and Proximity Mines, and 15 minutes to complete the sale. The same four drop-off points are given to each vehicle, free to tackle in any order the players like. Each point is at an off-road location, so even if the player marks them with a waypoint, one should be aware that there could be impassable obstacles that the system will ignore in order to use the roadways to get the player as close to the point as possible, such as concrete barriers, or guiding the player to a highway that can't be entered or left, or even on the other side of an impassable highway.\nOnce arriving at the first drop-off and dropping off the weapons, the vehicle will be chased by &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Triads\"&gt;Los Santos Triads&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dubsta\"&gt;codice_1&lt;/a&gt;s, if signed as a CEO/VIP, or the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20MC\"&gt;Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; on motorcycles if the mission is played as a Motorcycle Club President. When following the player from behind they can be easy to take out since they are unlikely to avoid the proximity mines, but the player must ensure that there is a good amount of distance between the FAV and the exploding vehicles, as it can be enough to kill the player and damage the FAV. Once triggered, a total of four groups of enemies will spawn as the player makes their way to the drops. If doubling back the player must be mindful of not running over their own unexploded proxy mines.\nEach group that spawns should be taken out before moving on, even if an enemy gets stuck in the environment, or could be despawned by out-distancing them with the Dune FAV. If not taken out, they can and will suddenly respawn a full group of enemies around the player while en route to the next point, including directly in front of a speeding FAV and cause a head-on collision, where the player is already quite vulnerable to weapons fire. With a less than three-minute window for travel time, dropping off a shipment, and eliminating enemies, even one death for a solo player can make a complete sale virtually impossible.\nWhen a vehicle's four drop-offs have been reached and the product dropped, a 5th drop-off will be revealed. Once arrived at the final drop-off, the players must leave the area before time runs out to conclude the sale.\nWith the NPCs' unerring aim, no protection on the front and sides of the FAV and the short window to complete it in, many players consider this mission the most frustrating sale to do, and may choose to outright leave the session (and take a hit on losing a fraction of the sale) to join another session to likely get an easier sale mission and the likelihood of completing the sale at all.\nMarshall.\nThe player is provided up to three &lt;a href=\"Marshall\"&gt;Marshall&lt;/a&gt; monster trucks to make five weapon drops in 15 minutes in the steep hills of the country. With the vehicle's extensive off-road abilities, this should prove extremely easy. After the first drop, two Buzzards with side gunners will attack the trucks, although the pilots won't use any vehicle-mounted weapons like miniguns or missiles. Should a chopper be disabled or destroyed, another one will spawn after the next drop to replace it. While it is possible to kill the gunners thus 'disarming' a chopper, the time taken to do this is probably better spent focusing on driving, replenishing body armor, and healing up with snacks. Without gunners, the chopper will continue to chase the player for a time before the pilot attempts to land, and if successful will pursue the player with a pistol. If the player has access to heavy weapons like the &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Widowmaker\"&gt;Widowmaker&lt;/a&gt;, they could choose to get out of the Marshall the moment the Buzzards appear and destroy their vulnerable tail rotors, sending them into a lethal tailspin. At the last drop, a Cargobob will take the truck in a cutscene. With the mission complete, the players will be spawned on Sanchezs for their convenience, such as being able to get to the nearest road to spawn a personal vehicle. These bikes cannot be kept.\nInsurgent (Multiplayer Co-Op Exclusive).\nStock will be held by 2-3 unarmed &lt;a href=\"Insurgent\"&gt;Insurgent&lt;/a&gt;s, which must all reach the same drop off point in 15 minutes. This means that it will only happen if selling a medium level of stock. The Insurgents come equipped with a signal jammer, which will activate in 35 seconds after the call ends, preventing NPC enemies from showing up and will disrupt the global signal of other players, as long as the Insurgents stick together within a certain radius. No matter how many Insurgents, the area for the signal jammer to work seems to be the same, increasing difficulty for more vehicles in one sale. A strength bar designated 'Global Signal Jammer' is provided to help maintain the jammer radius.\nFailing to stay in the convoy will make &lt;a href=\"Kkangpae\"&gt;Kkangpae&lt;/a&gt; enemies spawn and activate the global signal as long as the player stay out of the convoy.\nOnce all the vehicles reach the drop off point, all players must leave the area for the sale to be completed."}
