The two exchange quips. Soon, Trevor also arrives. It is revealed that &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0is transporting precious cargo via\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Freight%20Train\"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt;. Trevor wants Michael's help to steal the payload.\nThe player, as Trevor, takes a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;Sanchez&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to the tracks east of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;. Trevor uses some rocky cliffs and outcrops alongside the tracks to jump on top of the train's container cars. He then rides the bike across the train cars and hopping over the gaps in the containers, eventually reaching the locomotive. He enters the locomotive's cab, says \"howdy\" to the driver, and then proceeds to knock him out by hitting his head against the dashboard. Trevor bypasses the Merryweather unit waiting at the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt; station, where the train was intended to stop.\nThe player is shifted to Michael, who is wearing a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Scuba%20Suit\"&gt;scuba suit&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and is sailing a &lt;a href=\"Dinghy%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Dinghy&lt;/a&gt; up &lt;a href=\"Cassidy%20Creek\"&gt;Cassidy Creek&lt;/a&gt;. When Michael reaches a spot near the creek's &lt;a href=\"Raton%20Canyon%20Bridge\"&gt;train bridge&lt;/a&gt;, he looks up to see Trevor drive the Merryweather train head-on into another locomotive, causing a terrible accident. Cargo and train cars fall off the bridge and into the river below. Moments before the crash, however, Trevor had jumped free from the train, and he fell through the air and into\u00a0the water below, which is now filled with cargo containers. Michael blows the doors off the target container in order to get the payload located inside.\nOnce the doors have been destroyed, the player is shifted back to Trevor, who must fend off oncoming Merryweather boats, &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;helicopters&lt;/a&gt;, and snipers while Michael unloads the payload. When Michael has the payload, Trevor jumps into the Dinghy and the two rush down the creek towards the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt;. All the while, the player, as Trevor, must continue to fend off waves of Merryweather troops, using a &lt;a href=\"Thermal%20Vision\"&gt;thermal scope&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;sniper rifle&lt;/a&gt;. The two eventually reach open water and beach the craft near two separate getaway vehicles. They open the briefcase Michael obtained from the shipping container. The briefcase contains an ancient artifact.\nMichael wants to give the artifact to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin Madrazo&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0as a method of apology for Trevor's &lt;a href=\"Caida%20Libre\"&gt;kidnapping&lt;/a&gt; of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Patricia%20Madrazo\"&gt;Patricia Madrazo&lt;/a&gt;, Martin's wife. Trevor refuses.

Trevor is skeptical, but Michael insists that with\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin's&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0help, they can do it. Trevor agrees. Michael takes the artifact and leaves, ending the mission.\nAftermath.\n&lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; Newspaper.\n\"Train derails Merryweather profits.\"\n\"Rick Simpson - Weazel News\"\n\"\"The future of Merryweather's high-value courier service, which was pitched to clients as guaranteed safe transportation of sensitive or precious cargo, lies in jeopardy today after one of their trains was derailed and robbed in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Raton%20Canyon\"&gt;Raton Canyon&lt;/a&gt;.

At this point, it is possible to go to the mansion and retrieve it, however, at this point in the game, Michael is still subject to attack from the &lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Cartel\"&gt;Madrazo Cartel&lt;/a&gt; if he re-enters &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; as he's still exiled from the city. Hereafter, however, the &lt;a href=\"Premier\"&gt;vehicle&lt;/a&gt; Michael has been using no longer becomes available to him as a default, requiring him to use Trevor's &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;vehicle&lt;/a&gt; until Martin allows the two to re-enter Los Santos after the mission &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20Business\"&gt;Monkey Business&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhonecall.\n&lt;a href=\"Steve%20Haines\"&gt;Steve Haines&lt;/a&gt; phones both Michael and Trevor in a conference call and tells them to meet at &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Catfish\"&gt;Cape Catfish&lt;/a&gt;.

In &lt;a href=\"1985\"&gt;1985&lt;/a&gt;, the last of his American criminal record was him getting caught carrying explosives.\nAccording to Packie, Derrick left for &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; in the late-1980s when he was depressed, and Francis allegedly threw him a farewell dinner in &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt;. Derrick, Bucky and &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20O%27Malley\"&gt;Aiden O'Malley&lt;/a&gt; (all people with Irish backgrounds) fought in the against the UK Government during , once fighting in heavily-armed combat in Belfast, Northern Ireland (according to Derrick during &lt;a href=\"Three%20Leaf%20Clover\"&gt;Three Leaf Clover&lt;/a&gt;). Their combat ended in &lt;a href=\"1995\"&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt;, when the trio were arrested in the United States for a string of extremely violent robberies (they robbed the Mafia, according to Francis) Derrick snitched on Aiden and Bucky. Aiden was sentenced to twenty years in prison, but Bucky was found innocent at his trial. Derrick returned to &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and worked for some time with the North Korean thug &lt;a href=\"Park%20Young-Guk\"&gt;Park Young-Guk&lt;/a&gt;, buying his counterfeit banknotes in order to exchange them to the current rate. He returned to &lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nReturn and The Bank Heist.\nDerrick returned from Ireland in &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, and met via his little brother, Packie. &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;. During the bank heist at the &lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20Liberty%20%28Chinatown%29\"&gt;Chinatown branch&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20Liberty\"&gt;Bank of Liberty&lt;/a&gt;, Derrick and Patrick argued about how to treat the hostages in the bank. &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Keane\"&gt;Michael Keane&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20American%20Killers\"&gt;Irish Mob&lt;/a&gt; who was also partaking in the bank heist was shot dead by &lt;a href=\"Eugene%20Reaper\"&gt;Eugene Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, who was then killed by Derrick and Packie in retaliation. Packie and Derrick, along with Niko, escaped the Bank of Liberty with $1,000,000.\nDerrick wanted the money from the bank heist to be sent back to &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; in order to help with the \"cause\" (which was most likely going to be given to the ); however, Packie refused to let him do so, saying that the cause was over.\nJobs for Niko Bellic.\nFollowing the bank heist, Derrick took up residence in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;, where Niko helped him with some problems at Packie's request.\nDuring their first meeting since the bank heist, Derrick tells Niko that &lt;a href=\"Bucky%20Sligo\"&gt;Bucky Sligo&lt;/a&gt;, a former associate and friend of his, wants Derrick and his family dead. Derrick asks Niko to take a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Police%20Patrol\"&gt;Car&lt;/a&gt; and use the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Computer\"&gt;police computer&lt;/a&gt; to find Bucky and then kill him and his gang. Niko finds Bucky, and chases him to Bucky's hideout. Niko then kills him and his gang.\nLater, Derrick asks Niko to help him in protecting &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Young-Guk\"&gt;Kim Young-Guk&lt;/a&gt;, a North Korean mobster who came to trade counterfeit U.S. Dollars, from the LCPD.\nIn Derrick's final mission, Derrick asks Niko to kill &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20O%27Malley\"&gt;Aiden O'Malley&lt;/a&gt;, who'd been trying to sell the police information about Derrick in exchange for a reduced prison sentence. Niko and Packie ambush the prison convoy transporting Aiden to the &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20State%20Correctional%20Facility\"&gt;Alderney State Correctional Facility&lt;/a&gt; by blocking the vehicle's path, killing the police officers and then carjacking the vehicle Aiden was being transported in. They evade the police, and later change vehicle to a more inconspicuous &lt;a href=\"Presidente\"&gt;Presidente&lt;/a&gt;. After freeing Aiden from incarceration, Packie tells him they'll be taking him to the cliffs in &lt;a href=\"Leftwood\"&gt;Leftwood&lt;/a&gt;, tricking him into believing he'd be leaving the country on a boat.\nWhen they arrive at the cliffs, Packie reveals the truth behind why they rescued him and leaves Niko to finish off Aiden alone. In his final moments, Aiden reveals that Derrick had sold him out to avoid prison, suggesting Derrick had not been the innocent victim that he had made himself out to be, but instead was just as crooked and disloyal as Aiden and Bucky were. Ultimately though, Niko executes Aiden, whose body falls into the sea.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood%20Brothers\"&gt;Blood Brothers&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Derrick's younger brother, Francis, discovers that his elder brother has returned to Liberty City, Francis worries that Derrick will reveal Francis' corruption to the press for money. He &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Brothers\"&gt;talks with Derrick in a park&lt;/a&gt;, in an attempt to have Niko assassinate him. Niko has a choice of who to kill. The player does not receive anything from Derrick for killing Francis. If spared, the last time you will see him is during the funeral, bringing the family and everyone else into the church while Niko and Packie shoot at the Albanian gangsters who crashed the funeral. If killed, Derrick is buried at the &lt;a href=\"Dukes%20Cemetery\"&gt;Dukes cemetery&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Events of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\n&lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McReary\"&gt;Patrick McReary&lt;/a&gt; can be found in a random encounter in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", and if he is helped in his predicament he will be available as a gunman for any &lt;a href=\"Heists%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;heists&lt;/a&gt; that take place after his encounter. If recruited for &lt;a href=\"The%20Paleto%20Score\"&gt;The Paleto Score&lt;/a&gt;, Packie will talk about his involvement in the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Leaf%20Clover\"&gt;Bank of Liberty heist&lt;/a&gt; and names his accomplices including Michael, Niko and Derrick. During the conversation, he reveals that Derrick is in fact dead. This could mean that Niko killing Derrick in &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Brothers\"&gt;Blood Brothers&lt;/a&gt; was the &lt;a href=\"canon\"&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt; choice in the story, or that he was spared but later died between the events of both games.\nThe latter seems likely, as after &lt;a href=\"Out%20of%20Commission\"&gt;Out of Commission&lt;/a&gt; if Derrick was spared Packie will say he's all his mother has left, but it is unknown why he says this when Francis is spared, most likely because he tried to avoid his family at all costs.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nDerrick seems to be the most compassionate of all the McReary brothers, as is shown in the way he tries to calm down and negotiate with the bank staff and customers during the heist. However, he is shown to be rash and violent when intoxicated or high, as seen when he hires Niko to kill both Bucky and later Aiden.\nDerrick initially appears to be the most honest of the McReary brothers, claiming that he always fought for what he believed was right (referring to his time in the IRA) and only did what he did to help his cause. However, it is eventually shown that Derrick is not as loyal to his cause as he made himself out to be. When faced with severe criminal charges due to his participation in robberies in the late-1990s, he betrayed his two former IRA colleagues Aiden and Bucky in order to avoid prison, resulting in a twenty-year prison sentence for Aiden."}

It is a bonus to those who have either the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Editions\"&gt;Special/Collector's Edition&lt;/a&gt;, or for all players owning the Enhanced Edition. In the former case it is free, while in the latter case it costs in-game &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; to purchase. However, the players who bought the Special/Collector's edition of the original game will still get it for free.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Desert Eagle takes the form of the , specifically modeled after the .50 AE caliber version, given the seven rounds. The weapon also appears in some cutscenes of \"\", but it is never available in normal gameplay.\nThe gun is evidently larger than the &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt; and appears to replace the &lt;a href=\"Python\"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; from the previous game, given the similar usage and larger cartridge.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nReferred to as the Combat Pistol, the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" rendition is still modeled after the .50 AE variant of the Desert Eagle (as evidenced by the lack of a fluted barrel) and features a more detailed appearance. However, the nine-round magazine appears to be derived from the .357 Magnum variant.\nThe gun is a bit larger than the &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt; and features a slightly longer barrel with \"DEAGLE 47, LIBERTY CITY ARMS\" etched into it. Due to how the texture is designed and mapped, the text is mirrored on the left-hand side of the weapon.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nReferred to as the Pistol .50, the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" rendition retains the form of the Desert Eagle, but with a multitude of changes made to the design: besides the removal of the famous \"Beaver Tail\", the slide-mounted safety has been removed, the frame mounted slide release is missing, the cocking serrations on the gun are chunkier, an underbarrel rail has been added, the barrel lock has been omitted, a sliding safety has been added in place of the slide release and the trigger guard has been redesigned. In addition, the muzzle has been shifted downwards towards the middle of the barrel, and is noticeably larger in diameter. It has tritium-illuminated iron sights (like the &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Pistol\"&gt;Combat Pistol&lt;/a&gt;) that are based on other modern pistols such as the .\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Desert Eagle is more powerful than the &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;, but holds less rounds than the former in a single magazine. Despite its small size, it is able to decapitate NPCs like &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Rifles\"&gt;Assault Rifles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shotguns\"&gt;Shotguns&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifles\"&gt;Sniper Rifles&lt;/a&gt;.\nDepending of the weapon skill, some of the weapon's attributes change:\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the Combat Pistol is more powerful than the standard &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;, but sacrifices ammunition capacity for it, holding only nine rounds in the magazine as opposed to seventeen rounds for the Pistol. While it can be used for &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-bys&lt;/a&gt;, its semi-automatic capabilities and the 9-round magazine makes it hard to use at neutralizing targets in car chases, meaning that it is at its best in gunfights on foot.\nThe Combat Pistol takes about 3\u20134 body shots to take down unarmored NPCs, and has a much higher fire rate than the \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition (it is the same as the Glock).\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Pistol .50 has very high damage per shot of pistols, at the cost a slightly reduced, semi-automatic rate of fire coupled with notable recoil. Capacity is lower than that of the Pistol but it can be freely improved to be on par with it. The Pistol .50 lacks the damage falloff of the &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Pistol\"&gt;Combat Pistol&lt;/a&gt;, increasing its usefulness at medium range. The main weakness of the Pistol .50 is its accuracy, which makes it ineffective for drive-by shooting and of reduced efficiency at a long distance while on foot. However, this handgun remains effective against NPCs in close quarters, making it a viable pistol for use in hectic battles.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", the properties of the Pistol .50 make it a good weapon for quickly finishing the first waves of a Survival, as a single shot to the chest is able to kill enemies at lower survival waves. Also, with the introduction of vehicles with bullet-resistant glass, the Pistol .50 can be a good alternative against these vehicles, requiring ten rounds to shatter bullet-resistant glass in contrast with the usual 16 rounds for most firearms (although it is outclassed by most revolvers, sniper rifles and any MK II weapon with FMJ rounds).\nTrue to its name and the markings, it is chambered in .50 Caliber, which is a very large and powerful cartridge that gives the pistol such power.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nGeneral\n&lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Whetstone\"&gt;Whetstone&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Tierra%20Robada\"&gt;Tierra Robada&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Bone%20County\"&gt;Bone County&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nGeneral\n&lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt;"}

The roof intake, flat bonnet, and rear vents and cooling system are taken from both the and the , with some additional details likely derived from the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Desert Raid features a bulky, yet aerodynamic body, where the front has a very thin design with no obvious signs of a front bumper, although there is still the inclusion of a manufacturer badge on the hood, as well as two rectangular headlights. The hood shape follows the sharp raised arches, also covering the truck's large V8 engine, surrounded by the roll-caging.\nThe cabin area is fully enclosed with glass panes, being relatively thinner in comparison to the rest of the car, while each side of the vehicle has side-mounted, aluminium exhausts which run almost under the doors. The windshield features a sponsor banner by default, which cannot be removed. On the roof, a large intake can be seen leading into the rear bed of the vehicle, into the rear radiator which features two radiator fans. A roll cage is partially seen through the windows.\nThe rear area of the vehicle is very bulky, featuring extended wide body panels, with small intakes on the side of the body directly after the cabin. The rear of the vehicle serves as a storage unit for two spare wheels, which are seen held by green ratchet straps down onto the framework. The rear features basic rectangular lights at either side of the vehicle, on the ends of the wide-body panels and above a set of back mudguards. On top of these panels are multiple vents designed to divert airflow for aerodynamic purposes.\nThe underside of the vehicle uses quad-shock absorbers on each axle, dampening impact to its extreme ride height, together with springs with internal shocks and additional hydraulic shocks. The front axle is protected by a diff cover formed from the underside sump guard, as well as protective layers on the A-frame suspension. The rear axle sports semi-elliptical leaf springs and additional hinged shock absorbers running from the chassis to the axle itself.\nThe interior reuses gauges from the &lt;a href=\"The%20Liberator\"&gt;Liberator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marshall\"&gt;Marshall&lt;/a&gt;, as well as includes a very similar internal rollcage. Like the &lt;a href=\"Trophy%20Truck\"&gt;Trophy Truck&lt;/a&gt;, the Desert Raid includes many switches and buttons across the interior, and features a knob reading F/R, likely indicating a rear/four wheel drive locking diff. The steering wheel itself includes multiple buttons, and directly behind that are two paddles for an apparent semi-automatic paddle-shift gearbox. A large extended gear-shifter is centralized between the carbon-fiber racing seats. Also, a radio is seen located under the carbon-fiber dashboard.\nThe vehicle's bodywork, tubular frames, engine cam covers and the stitches on the steering wheel are painted in a primary color, while the roof intake is painted in a secondary color. Although not accessible, a tertiary color is applied on the cage paddings, which is only available in black upon purchasing it, and are only painted in the corresponding color sets available in &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;. It uses a set of five-spoke rims similar to the \"Ruff Weld\" sport rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in &lt;a href=\"Atomic\"&gt;Atomic&lt;/a&gt; high-profile, all-terrain radial tires with detailed tread patterns. Both the stock wheel rims and the spare wheel rims on the rear end are painted with the \"Wheel\" color.\nBoth liveries have the same sponsors, although a few of them are present on a single livery, not present on the other:\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle is similar in performance to its &lt;a href=\"Trophy%20Truck\"&gt;trophy&lt;/a&gt; counterpart, having excellent suspension as a main feature. It also has great acceleration, but not as impressive as the Trophy Truck. The truck has good traction thanks to its all wheel drive layout, as well as the off-road tires it sports. The large shock absorbers and raised suspension give the truck a large amount of leeway without resulting in damage to the vehicle when landing from jumps, giving it more potential than other off-road trucks with raised suspension. The vehicle also feels light thanks to the lack of extra bodywork, but the large rear makes the vehicle very prone to fishtail, similar to the Trophy Truck. Its resistance to collisions is generally good, but may lose body part and the spare tires in the process (though not as many parts as the Trophy Truck due to the unique construction).\nThe engine sounds to be turbocharged, and appears to be a large V8 with two square air-filters centralized on the block. The valve covers can be seen colored along with the roll-cage color. Two exhausts are seen coming from the engine, running down the side of the vehicle. In front of the engine, a large radiator with radiator fans is seen, placed directly in front of the camshaft cogs. The engine has a single cam configuration."}

CLEO 3/4 is needed for this modification to Save/Load missions.\nMod Popularity.\nThe mod is considered to be very popular among modders. Currently there are over 40000 user-made missions.\nThe mod popularity had given its authors the idea of making a contest the goal of which is to create the best mission using Design Your Own Mission mod. Each contest lasts for a certain period of time, then the jury consisting of the mod authors and the winner of the previous contest choose the best missions from the ones that were submitted. After that the members of GTAForums.com and GTAForum.nl vote for the winner.\nSince the second the contests have a specific theme the missions should be made on."}

The shape of the headlights seems to be inspired by the . Opposed to the butterfly doors from its real-life equivalent, the Deveste Eight uses gull-wing doors.\nDesign.\nThe Deveste Eight is clearly distinguished by its smooth design with various exotic curves around it. The front end is largely dominated by the dual carbon-fibre splitters on either side and large open ducts, along with dual mesh intakes that curve upwards and having plastic surroundings. Within each intake, there is a set of carbon-fibre curved housings with circular headlamps on the upper side and numerous light strips spanning most of the housing, down to almost the centre of the car. The bonnet area smoothly contorts inward and bears a golden Principe emblem on the front end, along with frontal ducts with plastic finish and rear exit vents within inset sections of the bonnet, intended to direct air to flow through the bonnet and passing on each side of the windscreen.\nThe sides of the car are distinctive by the protruding front arches and the upswept body shape, which reaches to the top of the rear wheel area before curving downwards on the rear end. Large concave sections can be seen coming from small front exit vents and reaching towards large mesh intakes intended to direct airflow into the rear brakes and the engine bay. The cabin area is distinctively rounded and long, featuring black trim around the windows, gull-wing doors with sleek mirror wings and rear-quarter inset panels with small vents, intended to direct airflow into the engine bay. The rear section has a large rounded window with plastic trim for the cabin, and a narrow, triangle-shaped glass pane with black trim, intended for visibility of the engine. The central narrow area is relatively flat in comparison to the sides and features six slatted vents beside the rear glass pane.\nThe rear of the car is very unique, with the most prominent feature being the two enormous cylindrical openings that house the exhausts of the vehicle. Large triangle-shaped vents can be seen between the openings and the rear fender arches, containing V-shaped red tail lamps partially surrounding the outer part of the vents. The name \u2018Deveste\u2019 and \u2018Eight\u2019 is badged in gold on both the right and left rear vents, along with a small Principe logo onto the lower-middle section of the rear, between the openings. The vehicle\u2019s rear splitters curve round and back into the body, and is also where the vehicle\u2019s brake and reverse lamps are located, including an F1-style brake lamp on the centre. Its underside is fully covered with a carbon-fibre plate, with the front section having a small separation from the front splitters and the rear one having various separations for the rear splitters, including a wide central separation.\nThe interior is similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"X80%20Proto\"&gt;X80 Proto&lt;/a&gt;, except for the paddle shifters on the steering wheel and the Principe badge on the horn cap.\nMost of its bodywork is painted in a primary colour, while the rear-view mirrors and the interior stitching are painted in a secondary colour. A trim colour is also available for the dashboard, part of the door panels, seats and engine cover. The car uses a unique set of rims, consisting of 14 spokes and having bolt details on the outer surrounding, wrapped in low-profile tyres. These rims can also support a dedicated colour, although only naturally-generated examples from &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; may have a black colour instead of the default alloy colour.\nPerformance.\nThe Deveste Eight has overall moderate acceleration but an excellent top speed. It features a long wheel base, and, when coupled with its average traction, means that the vehicle loses time to grippier Supers in races with many corners. Its straight line speed is excellent; it tops out as the second fastest car in the Supers class, only behind the &lt;a href=\"811\"&gt;811.&lt;/a&gt; Despite this, it is only the 4th fastest regular car in the game, as both the &lt;a href=\"Pariah\"&gt;Pariah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Itali%20RSX\"&gt;Itali RSX&lt;/a&gt; in the Sports class are faster than it and any of the Supers. As a result, it is one of the best Supers in the game for Stunt Races; in a regular race consisting of actual corners, the Deveste Eight will almost always be beaten by cars with good cornering capabilities, such as the &lt;a href=\"Emerus\"&gt;Emerus&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Krieger\"&gt;Krieger&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn the Expanded and Enhanced version of GTA Online, the Deveste Eight can be upgraded with &lt;a href=\"Hao%27s%20Special%20Works\"&gt;HSW&lt;/a&gt; performances, further increasing it's top speed to 151.7 MPH (244.2 KPH). \nThe vehicle's weight is significantly heavy, capable of ramming through traffic with only some speed lost. As of , the Deveste Eight's weight has been increased from 2.3 to 3 tonnes. \nThough the Deveste Eight has excellent durability, it is extremely vulnerable to gunfire from behind, as it can be destroyed easily by shooting its huge exhausts with the Minigun or any vehicle that can be equipped with machine guns. The large rear windows mean the driver and passenger can be exposed to enemy gunfire.\nWhile the engine bay itself cannot be opened, a unique V16 engine can be partially seen through the glass hood, and by clipping the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Editor\"&gt;Rockstar Editor&lt;/a&gt; camera inside of it, one can see four turbochargers on either side of the engine like its real-life inspiration. It also has a mixed engine sound similar to both the &lt;a href=\"X80%20Proto\"&gt;X80 Proto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vagner\"&gt;Vagner&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "207209", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=207209", "title": "Deviant", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Schyster\"&gt;Schyster&lt;/a&gt; Deviant is a muscle car featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the continuation of the update, released on February 7, 2019, during the &lt;a href=\"Deviant%20Week\"&gt;Deviant Week&lt;/a&gt; event.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Deviant is based on , itself a customized . The taillights, grille and lower grille seem to resemble the ones found in the .\nThe Deviant is distinguished by the elongated body and the sporty modifications installed on. On the front, the lower area features a colored chin spoiler partially covered by a black, plastic-like splitter, both spanning the whole width of the car. On the upper area, the car has a large grille with a separation on the middle, while the circular panels on the edges house the twin circular headlights and small rectangular turning signals. The hood sports a bulky section with a small cutout on the front, intended for thea front intake. A silver manufacturer emblem can be seen just in front of the small intake.\nThe sides of the car are denoted by the discreet fender flares around the wheels, as well as dual exit vents on the front fenders and the dual side-mounted exhausts on the rear ones, just next to the rear wheels. The greenhouse area makes use of a permanent black section around the windshield and door windows, with squared rear-view mirror wings near the A-pillars.\nThe rear section features a large trunk with a large ducktail spoiler on the end, with four strakes on the concave portion of the same. The car features a black panel that houses the tail lights and the license plate, along with silver lettering above the driver-side tail light set, displaying the manufacturer name. On the underside, a black detail spans the entire width of the car and features two concave portions, apparently to support rear-exit exhaust options.\nThe interior of the car is reused from the &lt;a href=\"Savestra\"&gt;Savestra&lt;/a&gt;, using the same dials and details for the dashboard. It uses race seats with red safety belts.\nThe primary color of the vehicle is applied on the bodywork and the lower front chin spoiler, while the secondary color is applied on the portion surrounding the front, the headlight housings, the chin spoiler beams hidden behind the black splitter, the engine cam covers, the door handles, the rear bumper and the interior stitching, along with the trimmings found around the windows, the rear-view mirrors, the rear plate and the tail lights. A trim color is also available for the seats. The rims appear to be identical to the ones from the Savestra, being a variation of the \"Fujiwara\" tuner rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;. The rims can also support a dedicated color, although only examples generated in the &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;, or the one appearing in the mission &lt;a href=\"Repo%20-%20Sasquashed\"&gt;Repo - Sasquashed&lt;/a&gt; may have a black color.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nStatistically, the Deviant handles like any other muscle car, but its heaviness makes it difficult for it to oversteer easily. Handling-wise, it is not quite punishing and can be corrected in an event of a spin-out, and can easily tackle hard corners with handbrake usage. Its speed is great and is quite a competitive vehicle for races. In addition, it can take on collisions relatively easy due to its heavy weight and having a good amount of durability; while the Deviant can be given full suspension upgrades, it does not make much difference in terms of corners. One point to take note of is its very poor turning radius at low speeds, which can make sharp hairpins difficult.\nThe Deviant is powered by a single-cam V8 coupled to a 4-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. Part of the engine bay is occupied by an intake manifold connected to the aforementioned intake, and a supercharger fitted as standard. The engine sound seems to be an edited version of the &lt;a href=\"Imperator\"&gt;Imperator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt; ones, slightly higher-pitched."}

Moore killed two policemen, Arnold Strickland and James Crump, and a dispatcher, Leslie Mealer, after being booked on suspicion of stealing a car. He then fled in a patrol car. According to the \"Associated Press\", after his recapture he said, \"Life is a video game. Everybody's got to die sometime.\"\nThe controversy involving his relation to Grand Theft Auto was revealed during an episode of 60 Minutes in March 2005. In the episode a student demonstrated the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto games&lt;/a&gt; to them, explaining that in one of the games there is a mission that depicts exactly what Moore did: escape a police station, kill officers and escape in a police cruiser.\nMoore faced trial in 2005. In August 2005, Moore was convicted as charged and on October 9, 2005 he was sentenced to death by lethal injection.

He is also shown to have influence within law enforcement, as evidenced by his relationship with &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Haines\"&gt;Steve Haines&lt;/a&gt; and his ability to procure a police escort for his lawyer and second-in-command, &lt;a href=\"Molly%20Schultz\"&gt;Molly Schultz&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\n&lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; first meet Weston after he has had a meeting with his friend and cohort, Steve Haines, during the mission &lt;a href=\"By%20the%20Book\"&gt;By the Book&lt;/a&gt;, where he was given permission to torture &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Kerimov\"&gt;Ferdinand Kerimov&lt;/a&gt;. However, they are not properly introduced until after they &lt;a href=\"Blitz%20Play\"&gt;rob an armored truck for him at the behest of Haines&lt;/a&gt;. Weston offers the trio special business opportunities: He offers Michael the possibility of making a &lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28film%29\"&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt; with his idol, &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; producer &lt;a href=\"Solomon%20Richards\"&gt;Solomon Richards&lt;/a&gt;, in order to raise the value of &lt;a href=\"Richards%20Majestic%20Productions\"&gt;Richards' studio&lt;/a&gt; and he offers Trevor and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; a contract to steal five luxury cars for him so he can sell them to high ranking &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; government officials.\nTrevor and Franklin acquire the five cars, with the assistance of &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt;, and transport them to Weston's drop-off point, but Weston backs out on their payment, promising to \"invest\" it for them on his own company. Simultaneously, he attempts to shut down the production of Michael and Solomon's movie so that he can claim an insurance pay out since the studio has achieved its probable peak value. Since the insurance policy requires the inability to complete the film, he has his lawyer, Molly Schultz, take the print copy of the film with her and keep it stashed until Weston sees fit to destroy it. Upon discovering this, Michael races to the airport to recover the prints from Molly, but when she sees him coming, she becomes terrified and attempts to flee, &lt;a href=\"Legal%20Trouble\"&gt;only to accidentally end up getting killed when she is sucked into a plane's turbines&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnraged by Molly's death, Weston &lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;sends a platoon of Merryweather soldiers to Michael's home in an attempt to murder his wife and daughter&lt;/a&gt;. Alerted of this by Weston's gloating at the premiere for \"&lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28film%29\"&gt;Meltdown&lt;/a&gt;\", Michael and his son, &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Jimmy&lt;/a&gt;, rush to their home and arrive just in time to save &lt;a href=\"Amanda%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Amanda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tracey%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Tracey&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnding.\nAfter his failure to have Michael's family killed, Weston visits Franklin and asks him to kill Michael, but Franklin tries to refuse, telling him that Agent Haines told him to kill Trevor. It is at this point that Franklin can choose whether to kill Michael at Weston's request, kill Trevor at Haines' request, or spare them and team up with them both to kill all their enemies.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nEnding C=\nThe Third Way.\nFranklin contacts Lester and asks him for help on figuring out what to do. Lester initially suggests killing both Trevor and Michael, but eventually comes up with a better way to solve the problem. &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;He lures Haines' corrupt FIB allies and Weston's private Merryweather battalion to a foundry&lt;/a&gt; where the three protagonists ambush and kill all of them, stripping both Haines and Weston of their brute force power. Afterwards, Lester acquires the locations of all of the protagonists' enemies.\nWeston gets kidnapped by Trevor after the protagonists have killed Haines, &lt;a href=\"Wei%20Cheng\"&gt;Wei Cheng&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Harold%20%22Stretch%22%20Joseph\"&gt;Stretch&lt;/a&gt;. As Trevor assaults his mansion, Weston attempts to hide in a crate, but is found by Trevor and knocked out. Trevor stuffs Weston into the trunk of his own &lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; and drives it to the edge of a cliff in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;, where he meets up with Michael and Franklin.\nAfter gloating about their victory to a terrified Weston, the three protagonists push the car off the edge of the cliff. The car crashes repeatedly into several rocks along the way, until it finally hits the shallow waters and explodes, killing Weston.\nEnding A=\nSomething Sensible.\nIf Franklin chooses &lt;a href=\"Something%20Sensible\"&gt;to follow Haines's request&lt;/a&gt;, he kills Trevor with Michael's assistance. Afterwards, Franklin calls Haines to inform him that he has done as requested and also to ask him to persuade Weston not to go after him for sparing Michael. Haines tells Franklin that he will handle Weston, because Merryweather has lost its licence to operate in the state, but also tells him never to contact him again.\nEnding B=\nThe Time's Come.\nIf Franklin chooses &lt;a href=\"The%20Time%27s%20Come\"&gt;to follow Weston's request&lt;/a&gt;, Franklin will chase and kill Michael. After the deed is done, Franklin will call Weston and to inform him, asking him to ensure that Steve Haines will not come after him for refusing to kill Trevor, to which Weston informs Franklin that he has already contacted Haines' superiors and ensured that he would back down. Franklin also asks if Weston has any more jobs for him, but the billionaire sardonically tells Franklin that he did do his last job for him, and that he is no further use to him. Before hanging up, he mockingly advises Franklin to \"go to business school, because clown school ain't worked out so good.\"\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nAftermath of The Third Way.\n&lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt; Newspaper \"\"Billionaire investor and life style guru Devin Weston has disappeared. Police suspect foul play, but no body has been recovered. Mr. Weston, &lt;a href=\"1962\"&gt;51&lt;/a&gt;, who rose to fame in the tech bubble and subsequently made more money in a host of other industries, including entertainment, the &lt;a href=\"Internet%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;, currency trading and luxury travel, recently caused controversy when he invested heavily in Merryweather, the notorious and discredited private security firm run by &lt;a href=\"Don%20Percival\"&gt;Don Percival&lt;/a&gt;. Police responded to sounds of gunfire at &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston%27s%20Mansion\"&gt;Mr. Weston's villas&lt;/a&gt; in the hills above &lt;a href=\"Chumash\"&gt;Chumash&lt;/a&gt;, but despite signs of violence and several dead security guards, Mr. Weston himself was not found, dead or alive. Also missing was &lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;one of Mr. Weston's collection of luxury cars&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nWeston is considerably pompous, egotistical, narcissistic, arrogant, greedy, charismatic, temperamental, and being a giant conartist. He enjoys constantly reminding the protagonists that he is far wealthier than they are, and that his affluence allows him to do as he pleases; he even brags about his sexual conquests, both on his website and his &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader\"&gt;Lifeinvader&lt;/a&gt; page. Along with that, he has a rather sadistic and cynical sense of humor, joking around and making crude jokes at others' expense. All the protagonists at some point or another agree that Weston can best be described as a douchebag: overbearing, prone to showing-off and with the irritating habit of pretending that he is their friend, despite his absolute scorn for them.\nIt is very obvious that it has been a long time since he has not had everything he wanted handed to him, to the point that it does not even occur to him that anyone would actually stand up to him, and when they do he responds with temper tantrums. This can be seen in the Deathwish ending, when Weston starts screaming and crying \"I never lose\" after he fails to bribe Trevor into sparing his life.\nHowever, it is implied by the \"Deathwish\" ending that while Weston may have many connections, he is not well-liked, even hated, at least by most of his associates and acquaintances, since none of the protagonists ever face repercussions for their obvious role in his death. His death, if not a convenience to the people he claimed connected to, is at least not a negative impact on their lives and businesses. The police and FIB list him as \"missing\" when his body is not found, and Merryweather CEO &lt;a href=\"Don%20Percival\"&gt;Don Percival&lt;/a&gt; emails Michael and Trevor thanking them for killing Weston as it allowed him to buy Weston's shares in the company at a reduced price, making him a lot of money in the process.\nHe gives the appearance of living a healthy life and a clear, peaceful mindset by practicing yoga (even having his &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader\"&gt;Lifeinvader&lt;/a&gt; profile picture in a \"namaste\" greeting pose), but in reality he uses this image in a passive aggressive stance, still looking down at others. Even Molly, the only person in the game who genuinely likes Weston, is treated with disdain by him, with him dismissively labeling her as \"highly-strung\". However, her death does anger Weston, but only to the extent that Michael \"made a fool\" of him.\nWeston, according to Trevor, \"fancies himself a liberal\" and thus engages in several stereotypical \"upper class liberal\" activities, such as practicing yoga and drinking fancy lattes. However, it becomes clear during the game that these supposed liberal sensitivities are only a ruse to maintain a positive public image. When Lester discovers that Weston owns 11% of Merryweather Security, he will comment on how \"good\" it is that a \"pseudo-liberal\" like Weston would be a shareholder in a private military corporation. However, Weston proclaims that he thinks like a libertarian, stating on his website, \"Vote Conservative, Live Liberal.\" Weston himself states that he is a Darwinist--an obvious opposite to his peaceful, positive, liberal image.\nWeston also has the habit of calling any of the protagonists by the moniker \"slick,\" which he uses alternately to pretend he is their friend or to belittle them, as the situation sees fit. This is likely a reference to the character of Michael Cerrito from the 1995 movie ."}

There are two variants of Diablos - one with a red bandana, light blue jeans, and a dark blue jacket, and another one with a blue bandana, a dark blue jacket, and olive cargo pants. The leader of the Diablos is the adult movie star &lt;a href=\"El%20Burro%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;El Burro&lt;/a&gt; (who has been under observation by &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; since &lt;a href=\"1997\"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;, as mentioned on \"GTA III\"s official website). The only activities known to be associated with the Diablos are street violence and pornography. They also appear to be having spats with the &lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Yardies\"&gt;Uptown Yardies&lt;/a&gt; for dissing &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Lizzy\"&gt;Queen Lizzy&lt;/a&gt;. They lost a lot of members during the attempted Turf War battle with the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hepburn%20Heights\"&gt;Hepburn Heights&lt;/a&gt; and with the &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt; for trying to steal some protection money.\nIn \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", Diablos members don fishnets or red skullcaps on their heads, red shirts, and black or brown pants. They drive Diablo Stallions in all of the games they are featured in.\nThe favourite radio stations of the Diablos are the following: &lt;a href=\"Game%20Radio\"&gt;Game Radio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Head%20Radio%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Head Radio&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA III\" and &lt;a href=\"The%20Liberty%20Jam\"&gt;The Liberty Jam&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\".\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nThe Diablos play an important role in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" being one of the gangs used by the &lt;a href=\"Sicilian%20Mafia\"&gt;Sicilian Mafia&lt;/a&gt; to attack interests of the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;. They are first seen when &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt; is enlisted to &lt;a href=\"Calm%20Before%20the%20Storm\"&gt;follow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Massimo%20Torini\"&gt;Massimo Torini&lt;/a&gt;, the Sicilian Mafia's right hand man. Massimo meets with a group of Diablos at &lt;a href=\"Hepburn%20Heights\"&gt;Hepburn Heights&lt;/a&gt; and tells them that if they worked with his associates (later revealed to be the Sicilian Mafia) Hepburn Heights would belong to them. The Diablos then &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Sabotage\"&gt;attacked&lt;/a&gt; the Leone Family goons in a large scale battle that takes place in Hepburn Heights, where the Leones are overwhelmed by a large quantity of Diablos armed with &lt;a href=\"MAC-10\"&gt;MAC-10&lt;/a&gt; submachine guns. The fight was won by the Leone Family, but Toni says that the Leone's wouldn't be able to hold on to Hepburn Heights much longer. This would be true, as the Diablos have control of Hepburn Heights in &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;, the setting of \"GTA III\".\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Advance\".\nThe Diablos didn't have a big role in the storyline. They appear in &lt;a href=\"Droppin%27%20Bombs\"&gt;Droppin' Bombs&lt;/a&gt; if the player delivers the shipment to the client very fast, &lt;a href=\"8-Ball\"&gt;8-Ball&lt;/a&gt; will page &lt;a href=\"Mike\"&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; to steal three &lt;a href=\"Diablo%20Stallion\"&gt;Diablo Stallion&lt;/a&gt;s and bring them to &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%27s%20Gentlemen%27s%20Club\"&gt;Salvatore's Gentlemen's Club&lt;/a&gt;. During this, Mike monologues to himself that he \"Better head over to Harwood and get this over quick. The Diablos aren't exactly the type you want holding a grudge against you.\" Apart from that, their cars appear in some missions, owned by &lt;a href=\"Scorelli\"&gt;Scorelli&lt;/a&gt;, who seems to be affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Southside%20Hoods\"&gt;Southside Hoods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cisco\"&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt; and by &lt;a href=\"Vinnie\"&gt;Vinnie&lt;/a&gt;. Hepburn Heights is under control of the &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt;, while the Diablos reside in &lt;a href=\"Harwood\"&gt;Harwood&lt;/a&gt;. They can also be found in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Campus\"&gt;Liberty Campus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cochrane%20Dam\"&gt;Cochrane Dam&lt;/a&gt;. They are dressed up in yellow jumpsuits and have long red hair (these might be red caps). They appear frequently in &lt;a href=\"rampages\"&gt;rampages&lt;/a&gt; and are armed with baseball bats in &lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;, but in the later districts, like other gangs, they use &lt;a href=\"Molotov%20Cocktail\"&gt;Molotov Cocktail&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Shotgun\"&gt;Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;AK-47&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nHepburn Heights is now completely under Diablos' control. Differently from \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", they are poorly armed and use only baseball bats (guns in missions only). At the beginning of the game they are involved with prostitution businesses by some rival &lt;a href=\"Luigi%20Goterelli\"&gt;Luigi's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pimp\"&gt;pimp&lt;/a&gt;s. Later on, &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; starts working for the Diablos' leader &lt;a href=\"El%20Burro%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;El Burro&lt;/a&gt;, the Diablos never appear in one of the missions. After Claude moves to &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;, Claude starts working for the arch-rival &lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Yardies\"&gt;Yardies&lt;/a&gt; and their leader &lt;a href=\"King%20Courtney\"&gt;King Courtney&lt;/a&gt;. In the mission &lt;a href=\"Uzi%20Rider\"&gt;Uzi Rider&lt;/a&gt;, Claude and two Yardies members went to Hepburn Heights and committed a massacre on the Diablos via &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by&lt;/a&gt;, the Diablos become hostile to Claude. They still steal protection money from the Yakuza and Claude needs to get this money back, as depicted in the mission &lt;a href=\"Shima\"&gt;Shima&lt;/a&gt;."}

At the end of the mission, the crew is seen rappelling down a broken elevator shaft, where a elevator cabin can be seen. Another one is used in the Subtle option of &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;The Big Score&lt;/a&gt;, where\u00a0Michael, &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Casey\"&gt;Casey&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0use it to carry two carts of gold.\u00a0A construction site elevator may be used by &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; during \"&lt;a href=\"Architect%27s%20Plans\"&gt;Architect's Plans&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Construction%20Assassination\"&gt;The Construction Assassination&lt;/a&gt;\".\nOutside of missions, they cannot be used. If the player glitches into either the Labs or the FIB building and approaches the elevator, it will open, and even close if going as deep as possible. They won't be able to be used however. There is actually more than one elevator interior in a single shaft, as the player is able to open the elevator in both the 47th and 49th floors of the FIB tower. The elevator in the &lt;a href=\"Mile%20High%20Club\"&gt;Mile High Club&lt;/a&gt; can be accessed, but remains unusable.\nThere are also two unused elevators in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt;. One is in the control tower and may be opened from both the ground and the top floors. There is also another one in an underground bunker (that cannot be opened without a glitch). Both cannot be used.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe elevators in \"GTA Online\" are still in the same locations as those in \"GTA V\", and likewise they cannot be used in gameplay.

Franklin collects Alonzo at the university and takes him to where Liz's &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet\"&gt;Gauntlet&lt;/a&gt; broke down. When Franklin compliments Liz's attractive appearance, Alonzo's simple response will be to pull Franklin out of the &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt; and fight him, enraged at his comments towards her.\nAfter Alonzo is dealt with, Liz will ask Franklin to take her to her friend's apartment on &lt;a href=\"Palomino%20Avenue\"&gt;Palomino Avenue&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Little%20Seoul\"&gt;Little Seoul&lt;/a&gt;.

She then states she never saw anyone stand up to him like Franklin. After arriving at her friend's place, she thanks Franklin for his actions and gives him her phone number, asking him to call her some time.

In &lt;a href=\"Marta%20Full%20of%20Grace\"&gt;Marta Full of Grace&lt;/a&gt;, Elizabeta tells &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt; that when she was fourteen years old, she was almost raped by a man in Puerto Rico. In her words, she \"fed him his balls\". Killing him earned her a dangerous reputation in Puerto Rico and she became feared despite her young age.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1991\"&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;, aged fourteen, Elizabeta moved to &lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, presumably with her parents.\u00a0Immediately, Elizabeta started her drug dealing business, and with her contacts in Puerto Rico she became a successful drug baroness. Growing up in Bohan, Elizabeta met\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Manny%20Escuela\"&gt;Manny Escuela&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and possibly\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Mallorie%20Bardas\"&gt;Mallorie Bardas&lt;/a&gt;, whom she may have known prior since they were both born in Puerto Rico. It is likely that Manny and Elizabeta drifted apart soon after, as Manny gained his own reputation as a pacifist and \"street cleaner,\" taking down drug dealers in Bohan, and Elizabeta being exactly what he sought to eradicate, probably led to them going their separate paths.\nBetween &lt;a href=\"1991\"&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"2002\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;, Elizabeta\u00a0was arrested six times, twice for possession of crack cocaine (in 1991 and &lt;a href=\"1993\"&gt;1993&lt;/a&gt; respectively), once in &lt;a href=\"1994\"&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt; for assault and three more times for possession of heroin in &lt;a href=\"1996\"&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;, weapons possession in &lt;a href=\"2000\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt; and a minor criminal sexual act in &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;. At some point prior to &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; she established her drug empire.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and \"The Lost and Damned\".\nElizabeta is asked by &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Grey\"&gt;Billy Grey&lt;/a&gt; to help find buyers for a \"big pile of heroin\". Around the same time, Elizabeta sends &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Luck%20of%20the%20Irish\"&gt;protect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McReary\"&gt;Patrick McReary&lt;/a&gt; during a drug deal. The deal goes sour, forcing Niko to kill the attackers with a sniper rifle.\nThe Lost M.C. Vice President, &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;, arrives at Elizabeta's home during a house party while she's dancing with &lt;a href=\"Carmen%20Ortiz\"&gt;Carmen Ortiz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kay%20Hartman\"&gt;Kay Hartman&lt;/a&gt;. She informs Johnny that she found him a buyer and is going to send a new guy from \"Eastern Europe somewheres\" along with him. Johnny takes a seat and waits for Niko. When Niko arrives she introduces him to Johnny and &lt;a href=\"Playboy%20X\"&gt;Playboy X&lt;/a&gt; and sends them to &lt;a href=\"Blow%20Your%20Cover\"&gt;oversee&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Buyer%27s%20Market\"&gt;heroin deal&lt;/a&gt; with Johnny.\nLater, after arguing with &lt;a href=\"Little%20Jacob\"&gt;Little Jacob&lt;/a&gt; over some crooks who stole her cocaine, Elizabeta asks Niko Bellic to &lt;a href=\"The%20Snow%20Storm\"&gt;retrieve it&lt;/a&gt;. Afterward, the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; begin a crackdown on Elizabeta's illicit activities for her, which causes her to become increasingly edgy, restless, and paranoid.\nDuring Niko's last visit to Elizabeta, she explains to Niko that she can feel the cops on her, that her bodyguard\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Jorge%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Jorge&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0turned states, and that everyone's a rat. In her disturbed state, she shoots and kills\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Manny%20Escuela\"&gt;Manny Escuela&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Jay%20Hamilton\"&gt;Jay Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0when Manny tries to film her as a part of his documentary about cleaning up the streets of Bohan and requests that Niko &lt;a href=\"Have%20a%20Heart\"&gt;get rid of the bodies&lt;/a&gt;. She then warns Niko to stay away from her, as the LCPD is rapidly closing in on her operation. Niko either gets the bodies to the doctor, destroys the car or dumps it in the water.\nJohnny Klebitz later works with Elizabeta, by &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Toll\"&gt;stealing&lt;/a&gt; a van full of cocaine from &lt;a href=\"The%20Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;The Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt;. To do this, she also employed\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Malc\"&gt;Malc&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"DeSean\"&gt;DeSean&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Riders\"&gt;Uptown Riders&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to ambush the convoy at the tollbooth to Bohan. They were successful, and made away with the drugs. She employs Klebitz again a few days later to &lt;a href=\"Marta%20Full%20of%20Grace\"&gt;pick up&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Marta\"&gt;Marta&lt;/a&gt;, a friend and drug mule from Puerto Rico. She was being arrested by an airport official, but escaped when Klebitz knees the custom's agent in his groin.\nShe employs Klebitz and the Uptown Riders one last time to &lt;a href=\"Shifting%20Weight\"&gt;sell coke&lt;/a&gt; to a couple in Bohan, but the deal goes wrong, with one of the couple shooting Klebitz' &lt;a href=\"Hexer\"&gt;Hexer&lt;/a&gt;, forcing him to ride with Malc. The police saw this as a terrorist attack, and sent many officers to chase down Klebitz and Malc. They all escape, and Klebitz takes a disabled police cruiser to suffice for a new vehicle. After this, she warns Johnny to stay away from her, as the heat is closing in.\u00a0\nJohnny can call Elizabeta later on and hear her in a frantic state, shouting at Marta to flush some drugs down the toilet, as police are about to raid her home; She tells Johnny that they're alright, laughs somewhat hysterically, and hangs up. Mallorie also calls Niko and tells him about her being arrested.\nShortly afterwards, Elizabeta enters police custody. According to &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt; reports, and radio news, she is sentenced to &lt;a href=\"2308\"&gt;three hundred years&lt;/a&gt; (effectively a life sentence) of imprisonment for thirty charges (ten years each) of cocaine distribution, a new record in the Liberty City crime society.

While the Ellie has the GT500's overall body shape, it includes multiple design cues from other Mustangs, such as the front fascia of a , with the additional fog lights from the GT500. The front bumper's valance is based on that of the . The rear panel and tail lights are from a . The side-vents and chrome side-skirts are inspired by a , while the centred rear-exhaust is somewhat loosely based on that of the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Ellie features a long body with a narrow profile, where the center of the front bumper features a large moulding for a lower grille, along with a small bottom lip spanning the width of the car. The upper area features chrome trimmings around the main grille, the main circular lamps on the edges and the high-beam circular lamps on the center, as well as small intakes beside the main lights. The hood features a large ram-air scoop and two safety pins.\nOn the sides, the car features distinctive formations passing through the doors and reaching to a set of dual intakes intended for ventilation of the rear brakes, while the skirting area features chrome details on it. The greenhouse area features chrome trim around the windows, the windshield wipers, cone-shaped mirrors and door handles, while the rear quarter sections feature small intakes. A chrome fuel cap can be seen on the driver-side rear section.\nThe rear section consists of a small trunk with a lip spoiler, followed by a black panel on the rear end featuring a chrome trimming around it. The same panel holds the license plate on the center, a small manufacturer badge on the passenger side and a set of rectangular tail lights. There is a small bumper and twin exhausts below.\nThe interior of the car is mostly unique, consisting of a grey backing with a chrome trim around it, holding a set of circular aircon units on the left and the radio set on the right, centered to the entire dashboard. The dials themselves are the same ones used on the &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt;, although enclosed by chrome surroundings and small caps on the center, together with red warning lights below the central gauge. The dashboard features a chrome detail below, with a passenger glove compartment and another circular aircon unit. The central column also has a grey backing with two gauges near the dashboard and the gear stick. The steering wheel has a wooden finish with a chrome detail, bearing the manufacturer emblem on the center. The area behind the seats seem to feature a frame on the roof.\nThe vehicle is only painted with a primary color for the bodywork and the frame on the interior. Although not accessible, an interior color is available for the dashboard, the doors and the interior stitching. Its wheels share the same rim design as the &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20Turbo\"&gt;Sabre Turbo&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20GT%20Classic\"&gt;Rapid GT Classic&lt;/a&gt;, being a derivative of the \"Muscle Freak\" muscle wheels available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith suspension upgrades, the vehicle's wheels will camber positively slightly.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Ellie has good performance overall but does not compete with other top muscle cars in the game. It has decent top speed, moderate acceleration and great traction, though it can spin out very easily if turning a corner too hard and its brakes are fairly good, but still not enough to keep up with faster Muscle cars.\nThe Ellie has all four advanced flags enabled:\nThe Ellie is powered by a single-cam V8 engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. The engine sound is shared with muscle cars like the &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ruiner\"&gt;Ruiner&lt;/a&gt;, though edited with a louder noise that is more apparent when idle."}

On the way to the farm, Elwood calls Trevor, who tells him it was business and Trevor can come to discuss the partnership at the farm, where all of the O'Neils are at the moment. But Trevor violently dismisses the offer and tells Elwood of his intentions to attack the farm.\nFearing of Trevor's attack, Elwood informs his brothers of the psychotic drug dealer's arrival and tells his family to protect the meth lab from Trevor at all costs, after which he drives away with his brothers Walton and Wynn to meet up with the Cheng family.\nHowever, despite their best efforts, all of the brothers (except for Elwood, Walton and Wynn) are slaughtered by Trevor, who finishes his rampage against them by pouring gasoline in-and-outside the lab before blowing up the farm, destroying their home and meth lab.\nQuest for vengeance.\nElwood and his two brothers eventually returned to the farm, only to discover it has been destroyed and their brothers dead.

Trevor, however brushed away the threat and gave away his location, while taunting Elwood and daring him and his brothers to come to Los Santos and kill him. Elwood, Walton and Wynn then traveled with Elwood's &lt;a href=\"Dubsta\"&gt;Dubsta&lt;/a&gt; to Los Santos.

It also possesses similar LED light strips placed under the headlights. The car also resembles the by the inclusion of multiple carbon elements, such as the carbon strip present on the bonnet from stock. The front of the Emerus is also reminiscent of the as both have thin slit-like headlights and a parallelogram shape front intake. The rear of the car seems to be inspired by the , while the wing is taken from .\nDesign.\nThe Emerus is distinguished by its aggressive styling and aerodynamic profile, where the front end features a carbon-fibre splitter, a large central intake and two smaller ones besides it. A set of circular headlamps and LED strips can be found on the outer edges, along with an intake on the bonnet area that is finished in black and the manufacturer emblem.\nOn the sides, the car employs black panels on the front fender area and a set of body-coloured fins in the middle section, mounted over a wide formation that leads towards a rear fender vent. The skirts have a concave shape, with an open front end and a curved rear end. On the cabin area, the roof and pillars are entirely finished in black, along with a small roof scoop. The doors contain fitted panes inside them as well, and will also match with the currently-applied window tint.\nThe rear end is largely dominated by the rear-mounted spoiler and the tail light strips on it, along with silver lettering between the spoiler supports that displays the manufacturer name. The lower side is mostly composed of square-shaped formations that separate the circular exhaust tubes from the rest of the carbon-fibre rear, together with a plate holder on the centre. The engine bay area features a V8 engine similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Jester\"&gt;Jester&lt;/a&gt;, with a set of vents in black finish. Its underside is mostly plated in sectioned black panels, with the central one finished in carbon-fibre, but leaving the rear axle exposed.\nThe interior of the car reuses the same textures and dials from the &lt;a href=\"FMJ\"&gt;FMJ&lt;/a&gt;, with the only difference being the paddle shifts behind the steering wheel and the corresponding manufacturer badge on the horn cap.\nThe primary colour of the vehicle is applied on the bodywork and the fins on the stock spoiler, while a trim colour is available for the interior stitching. The secondary colour does not seem to be applied on the car, unless a secondary-coloured modification is installed. The rims are identical to the \"S Racer\" sport rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, although only those generated examples from the &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;, appearing in a mission or given as a &lt;a href=\"Lucky%20Wheel\"&gt;Lucky Wheel&lt;/a&gt; reward may have a black colour rather than the default alloy.\nPerformance.\nThe Emerus performs similarly to the &lt;a href=\"T20\"&gt;T20&lt;/a&gt;, having a high acceleration and top speed. Handling is rather difficult to get used to, as it is very floaty over uneven roads and corners, alongside the low suspension. This can be used as an advantage, however, as its traction is good and can take rather sharp turns.\nThe Emerus has one (the eleventh) Advanced Flag enabled. The purpose of this flag is unknown, but it appears to have little impact on performance.\nThe Emerus sports a V8 engine in a rear-mid mounted position powering the rear wheels through a 7-speed gearbox. The engine sound is an edited version of the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vacca\"&gt;Vacca&lt;/a&gt; engine sounds."}

Emmet, who has been selling guns since at least &lt;a href=\"1962\"&gt;1962&lt;/a&gt;, supplies not only the Seville Boulevard Families but the Temple Drive Families and Grove Street Families as well.\nEmmet is known to the Johnson Family (in particular &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sean%20Johnson\"&gt;Sweet&lt;/a&gt;) along with &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt;. However, they stopped buying guns from Emmet as his stock was antiquated and relatively weak. Emmet, during the mission &lt;a href=\"Nines%20and%20AK%27s\"&gt;Nines and AK's&lt;/a&gt;, mistakes Carl for his deceased younger brother &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Johnson\"&gt;Brian&lt;/a&gt;, which could possibly mean Brian and Carl looked alike. Emmet also appears to have known Carl's mother &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Johnson\"&gt;Beverly Johnson&lt;/a&gt; and says that he is sorry about her death and that he knows that she would be proud of Carl.\nWhile it is unknown exactly where Emmet lives, it is most likely he resides in the house closest to his gun lot, as the lot is referred to as his \"yard\" and the directions from the mission state, \"Go to Emmet's house\" \u2013 the red marker is just outside the house.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nEmmet provides basic target practice for Carl and Big Smoke with old pistols he had in storage; the targets being glass beer bottles and an old &lt;a href=\"Tampa\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt;.

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Albany\"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Emperor made its first appearance in \"GTA San Andreas\", being based on a .\nHD Universe.\nIn the HD Universe, the Emperor is based on the and the . The headlights might have been inspired by the . The interior is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Esperanto%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Esperanto&lt;/a&gt;, being based on that of a .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe car represents contemporary full-sized luxury sedan, with a lean design and somewhat rounded profile. It also looks somewhat like the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, but sleeker and more profiled.\nThe vehicle spawns in a variety of single colors.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"GTA IV\", the Emperor has become a boxy 1980s American luxury sedan, while its previous contemporary Japanese look is given to the &lt;a href=\"Intruder\"&gt;Intruder&lt;/a&gt;.\nManufactured by &lt;a href=\"Albany\"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt;, the Emperor is much more traditional and luxurious in design, having a small grille with four square headlamps on the front, with a large and bulky bumper featuring a small grille beneath and a license plate. Chrome letterings can be seen above the grille, displaying its name. The sides make use of chrome lines passing through the doors and going towards the rear end, while the greenhouse area is predominated by chrome trims around the windows and chrome door handles, as well as square rear-view mirrors. The rear is slightly larger than its previous iteration and part of the rear wheels are covered by its bodywork.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Emperor returns to \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\" with an identical overall profile and design, but with slight deviations, such as a black \"eggcrate\" grille replacing the chrome mesh, a wider bottom grille, more pronounced detailing, different windshield wipers, a black finish on the side mirrors, and the removal of white-wall tires, giving the Emperor a somewhat less luxurious appearance than its previous iteration.\nColor distribution is the same as in \"GTA IV\" for both variants, as well as retaining the same wheel design.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nAcceleration and speed of \"GTA San Andreas\"' Emperor are somewhat disappointing, as are handling and braking. The engine sounds as though it is relatively large and powerful, but is apparently incapable of delivering substantial power to the bulky, rear-drive vehicle. Using the E-brake around corners almost guarantees fishtailing, making this car almost useless when driving at high speeds. It is, however, a sturdy vehicle with low chances of roll overs, and does a fairly good job of absorbing damage.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\n\"GTA IV\"'s Emperor is powered by a high-displacement, but low-output V8 engine, mated to a 4 speed gearbox in a RWD configuration. Due to its weight and low-power engine, the Emperor is quite slow off the line, its top speed leaves much to be desired. The car feels very heavy around corners and loses much speed around them. Its soft suspension often results in its rear swinging out of control and subtle fishtailing. Braking is very poor. Crash deformation is below average, and build quality is surprisingly low, as the Emperor cannot sustain much damage before failing or catching fire.\nThe base model, alongside the &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20%28beater%29\"&gt;beater variant&lt;/a&gt;, share the same engine sound as the &lt;a href=\"Stanier\"&gt;Stanier&lt;/a&gt;-based sedans, being the &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Cruiser\"&gt;NOOSE Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe handling system introduced in \"GTA V\" has led to some marked improvements to the Emperor compared to its appearance in \"GTA IV\". The Emperor again seems to be powered by a high displacement but low-revving V8 engine. The engine offers low power and only decent torque. Because of this, the Emperor's acceleration and overall top speed is unspectacular.\nThe handling of the Emperor is decent, especially when a more performance oriented suspension is added to the car. However, due to the car's low ride height, this does cause the car to scrape against the ground in areas where the terrain is more dynamic and road clearance is necessary. This low ride height will also sometimes cause the Emperor to become stuck in areas where smaller and \"shorter\" cars can escape from. At speed, the handling of the Emperor can become inconsistent and is prone to fishtailing due to the overall design of the car. Nevertheless, the long wheelbase of the car does aid the driver in these situations, as the driver can countersteer out of the slide and regain control of the car.\nThe normal Emperor can take multiple impacts to the engine, chassis, suspension, and tires without taking significant damage that will disable the car, and it is considered one of the most underestimated and under-rated cars in terms of overall durability. The engine, as stated before, is unspectacular, but does have decent torque, which allows the large and bulky car to accelerate very quickly and also enables it to take on off-road courses that some other cars in the same class may have issues with (such as climbing &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Chiliad%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Mount Chiliad&lt;/a&gt;). The car is fairly large and has one of the largest trunks in the game. It seats four occupants. The car's torque, combined with its weight, durability, and apparent body on frame design allows it to obtain an impressive amount of momentum at full speed, and the Emperor is easily capable of barrelling through &lt;a href=\"Police%20Roadblocks\"&gt;Police Roadblocks&lt;/a&gt;, and is also rarely affected by other cars slamming into it or ramming it. It is one of the most durable cars in the game.\nOverall, the Emperor is a solid, heavy car, with handling that isn't proportional to its straight line speed. For the price and availability of the car, it should be considered by anyone looking for a beginner's sedan that can haul a small group around, especially in areas where a durable and capable sedan is needed.\nUnlike in \"GTA IV\", all variants of the Emperor in \"GTA V\" perform identically, as they share the same handling files, and share an engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt;."}

All beater Emperors feature a worn interior used in other \"beater\" models in the game, featuring dirty and rusted interior detailing, ripped upholstery, and a removed head unit.\nColor distribution is the same as in \"GTA IV\" for both variants, as well as retaining the same wheel design.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\n\"GTA IV\"'s beater Emperor features noticeably worsened performance compared to the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;standard model&lt;/a&gt;, having slower acceleration. Besides this downgrade, other performance and damage statistics are identical to its clean variant.\nAs with its clean variant, this vehicle is powered by a high-displacement, but low-output V8 engine, mated to a 4 speed gearbox in a RWD configuration. Both vehicles also share the same engine sound as the &lt;a href=\"Stanier\"&gt;Stanier&lt;/a&gt;-based sedans, being the &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Cruiser\"&gt;NOOSE Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn contrast with its performance in \"GTA IV\", the beater Emperor in \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\" is identical to the standard model, as both vehicles share the same handling data. However, is not as physically durable as the standard model, and will most likely cease to work after a few direct impacts, and can sometimes fail to start at all. \nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe beater variant of the Emperor shares the same modification options as its &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;clean model&lt;/a&gt;."}

In the mission, Victor raids each of &lt;a href=\"Marty%20Jay%20Williams\"&gt;Marty Jay Williams&lt;/a&gt;'s businesses and eliminates the remnants of his &lt;a href=\"Trailer%20Park%20Mafia\"&gt;Trailer Park Mafia&lt;/a&gt; gang before taking their properties for himself. After that, the player will be able to attack other gang's Empire Buildings around the city. \nThe Empire Buildings are managed by the &lt;a href=\"Ionic%20Real%20Estate\"&gt;Ionic Real Estate&lt;/a&gt; and constructed by &lt;a href=\"T.U.M.E.%20Construction\"&gt;T.U.M.E. Construction&lt;/a&gt;.\nBuilding icons on the map represent empire building sites (such icons are absent during storyline missions, in order to reduce clutter). There are various types of such icons:\nAttacking a Business.\nTo make profit throughout the game, the player may conquer enemy businesses. There are also &lt;a href=\"Blitzkrieg\"&gt;storyline&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blitzkrieg%20Strikes%20Again\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt; that may not be available if a certain amount of empire sites is not owned.\nThe player must first destroy the rivals' vehicle parked outside the building. Next, gang members will come out to defend their turf. Once defeated, the player must handle the interior of the building, by killing the remaining members (who attack the player only with their fists or baseball bats) and trashing the assets of the business (which are specific to the business, such as beds for prostitution sites, or printers for loan sharking sites). Once that is completed, the business is put up for sale, and can be turned into any business venture once purchased.\nAfter attacking and seizing an enemy business, the gang that previously owned it may either attempt to seize a business that the player owns or send even more enemies after him, making it hard to keep on taking over sites.\nBuilding a Business.\nThere are three levels that each business site can go through: Small-time, Medium Venture and High-Roller. The larger the business, the larger the profit. Obviously, the cost for establishing a larger business is also higher. Upon first creating a High Roller empire site for a business, Vic unlocks a new &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20in%20GTA%20Vice%20City%20Stories\"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt; item that is related in some sort of way to the type of business that unlocked that particular item.\nOnce the business is built, the Vance Crime Family will use it as a base of operations for multiple criminal activities, some of them being disguised as legal front businesses. Unlike other gangs, Victor's gang will never spawn if no businesses are owned by it.\nWhen a business improves its corresponding type missions level, then its profits can be doubled, up to three times.\nBusiness Types.\nThere are six available businesses to construct. They are identified as:\nLegal business: They are operated by weak goons, who make use of Baseball Bats and Pistols.\nIllegal business: They are operated by strong goons, who make use of MAC-10s and AK-47s. These businesses are unavailable at first, and become unlocked by attacking and successfully taking over a site that has one of the three illegal businesses, but only after completing the mission &lt;a href=\"From%20Zero%20to%20Hero\"&gt;From Zero to Hero&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\nThere are, in total, 30 Empire Buildings available around the city. The map below shows the location of each business and their default owners and types after the mission &lt;a href=\"To%20Victor%2C%20the%20Spoils\"&gt;To Victor, the Spoils&lt;/a&gt;:\nFeatures.\nThese business sites, when entered, have members of Vic's gang inside. Some of them are indicated by a blue arrow, and when approached, can trigger specific missions by pressing the (&lt;a href=\"PSP\"&gt;PSP&lt;/a&gt;) / (&lt;a href=\"PS2\"&gt;PS2&lt;/a&gt;) button. These missions are based around the business of the operation, so smuggling businesses yield smuggling missions, for example. They may be cancelled by pressing the same button twice. Workers may also be found inside. Additional gang members can be found on the street right outside of the site. These gang members can be recruited to assist Victor in taking over other gang businesses, and will also immediately attack any enemy gang members that come close to a Vance property, similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Gang\"&gt;Vercetti Gang&lt;/a&gt; in \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\". To recruit them, they must be targeted and then the (PSP) / (PS2) button must be pressed. However, gang members cannot be recruited during storyline missions.\nDaily Income.\nThe daily income is paid every day at 16:00, unless the player is on a &lt;a href=\"Missions\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; (in which case it is paid after the mission ends). If the played mission happens to be an empire building mission, then the player will get increased income for that type of business, depending on how many levels of that mission have been passed (passing just the first level will lead to a small increase of the income, while passing all the levels of such a mission will lead to a noticeably higher income). Therefore, passing such missions leads to increased respect for a specific type of business.\nRival Gang Attacks.\nThe empire sites may come under attack from rival gangs, because to gain new sites, the player must seize them from other gangs and they will try the same in return. However, empires will only come under attack if Vance starts a war with the rival gang, which is activated when taking over one of their empire businesses. If the rival gang succeeds in damaging the site, its daily income will drop, or rarely, it can even be seized by the other gang. In order to return a damaged site to full capacity, Vic will need to pay a repair fee of &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;500 or $1,500. In order to avoid such scenarios, the player may just resort to maintaining sites obtained during the storyline and/or acquiring business sites that are put up for sale. Some of them may be put up for sale by default, while others can be put up for sale once they are lost in a gang war. Just like Victor and certain gangs can have a rivalry, other gangs can have a rivalry between them as well. They may be found randomly fighting in the streets around empire sites, such as the Bikers fighting the Cholos, or the Sharks fighting the Bikers.\nIntact empire sites have 4 health points. Once a rival gang attacks Victor's empire sites (and Victor does not reach the area of the attack in due time), or two rival gangs attack one another's empire sites, the attacked empire site loses one health point. Such an attack on one of Victor's empire sites is announced by a message notifying the player that a business in a certain area is under attack, as well as a damage bar appearing on the screen and filling up over time. Furthermore, a special, distress empire icon will appear on the radar. If the attacked site is not repaired and is subject to further gang attacks, it will keep on losing one health point during each attack. Eventually, once it reaches 0 health points, it will be put up for sale. This rule does not apply when Victor takes over sites, because the player only needs to successfully attack a business site once in order for it to come up for sale. Not only do damaged sites appear as such on the map, but they are also visibly damaged when driven by. For example, soot stains can be seen, as though the site had been set on fire, and some walls of the building may also appear to have been peeled off. (For further information regarding these aspects, please check the gallery).\nAs an added bonus, sites controlled by Victor also act as safehouses, with a save point being located somewhere within the premises. No garage, health or wardrobe services are available, however all business sites have a specific vehicle parked outside. Also, on the inside, there is a notice board, which is used for either developing or repairing a site. Once all thirty empire sites are taken over by the player, the vehicles that spawn outside of them will become bulletproof and pop-proof. In addition, much like gang warfare in \"GTA: San Andreas\", attacks on properties and random attacks on Vic will also completely cease (for the most part; occasional random attacks by &lt;a href=\"Cholos\"&gt;Cholos&lt;/a&gt; members on foot may still happen, due to the events of &lt;a href=\"O%2C%20Brothel%2C%20Where%20Art%20Thou%3F\"&gt;O, Brothel, Where Art Thou?&lt;/a&gt;, but they will not attack business sites once all 30 are purchased).\nStatus in \"GTA Vice City\".\nBy 1986, two years after the events of \"GTA Vice City Stories\", it is assumed that the Vance Crime Family has lost control of all of the empire sites after they were completely wiped out, as they are no longer there and have either become an entirely new building or just an empty lot. From north to south, on each side of the city, the locations of the former sites have become:"}

Carl convinces Sweet to allow him to go by himself, saying that Smoke and &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt; played him, and also wanted to atone for letting their brother, &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Johnson\"&gt;Brian&lt;/a&gt;, die &lt;a href=\"1987\"&gt;five years prior&lt;/a&gt;. Carl finds a &lt;a href=\"S.W.A.T.%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;S.W.A.T. tank&lt;/a&gt; nearby and steals it while being attacked by &lt;a href=\"Special%20Weapons%20and%20Tactics\"&gt;S.W.A.T.&lt;/a&gt; officers and &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; gang members. He successfully smashes the wall and enters the crack palace.\nUpon entering, Carl makes his way through three floors while killing Ballas, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Rifa\"&gt;San Fierro Rifa&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Russian Mafia&lt;/a&gt; gang members, as well as workers, whom all carry &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle\"&gt;M4s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;AK-47&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Shotgun\"&gt;Combat Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;MP5&lt;/a&gt;s amongst other strong weapons. Carl manages to find Big Smoke, who claims that he doesn't feel any regrets over betraying the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt;, and takes out a gun ready to battle Carl. During a shootout, Carl manages to kill Smoke, and after a brief conversation questioning Smoke's decision, he says he had no choice and saw the opportunity for power and money before dying. With his dying breath, Smoke claims that \"everyone will remember his name\", ensuring his legacy. As soon as he dies, Carl sadly laments Smoke's end, muttering \"Damn, man. What a waste...\"\nFrank Tenpenny, who had been watching the whole thing, arrives and orders Carl to put all of Smoke's money in his bag. Tenpenny threatens Carl with a Combat Shotgun, and sarcastically congratulates Carl on &lt;a href=\"High%20Noon\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Pulaski\"&gt;Eddie Pulaski&lt;/a&gt; and, now, Big Smoke. Tenpenny then states his next move, boarding a plane to flee from Los Santos to avoid the rioters. As Tenpenny prepares to kill Carl, Carl manages to distract Tenpenny by shouting Sweet's name, and as Tenpenny quickly turns around, Carl manages to dive out of the way as Tenpenny quickly brings his attention back to Carl and shoots at him, albeit missing, and flees from the room. After that, Tenpenny runs to the second floor and sets the whole building on fire by shooting a generator, causing it to explode. Carl leaves the crack palace the same way he came in, killing anyone in his way.\nAfter successfully escaping, Tenpenny attempts to drive away in his &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Truck%20%28ladder%29\"&gt;fire truck&lt;/a&gt;, but Sweet jumps on his &lt;a href=\"Greenwood%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Greenwood&lt;/a&gt; and then leaps at the ladder on the back of the truck, and hangs on from it. Carl enters a parked &lt;a href=\"Feltzer\"&gt;Feltzer&lt;/a&gt; and starts to chase Tenpenny. During a long chase throughout Los Santos with Vagos and Ballas on the road throwing &lt;a href=\"Molotov%20Cocktail\"&gt;molotovs&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; chasing the trio, a &lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.%20Rookies\"&gt;police officer&lt;/a&gt; in the truck gets out and starts stomping on Sweet's fingers. Carl gets the Feltzer under the ladder and Sweet drops onto the hood and then climbs over into the passenger seat.\nOn Carl's order, Sweet then takes control of the car with Carl acting as the shooter using his &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt; with unlimited ammo. The chase continues throughout the city with Carl destroying &lt;a href=\"Police%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;Police Cars&lt;/a&gt;, as well as Vagos rioters chasing them in &lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt;s and on &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;bikes&lt;/a&gt;. The chase comes to an end on &lt;a href=\"Ganton%20Bridge\"&gt;the bridge&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=\"Ganton\"&gt;Ganton&lt;/a&gt; where Tenpenny crashes his truck off the bridge. Tenpenny climbs out of the fire truck and deliriously shouts about how he had kept the neighborhood clean with his deeds and would \"do it all again\" before dying in the middle of Grove Street, where the story began and now where it ends.\nHaving witnessed this, Carl, &lt;a href=\"Cesar%20Vialpando\"&gt;Cesar&lt;/a&gt;, Sweet, and &lt;a href=\"Kendl%20Johnson\"&gt;Kendl&lt;/a&gt; walk towards Tenpenny, and Carl prepares to shoot Tenpenny with a &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Eagle\"&gt;Desert Eagle&lt;/a&gt; \"to make sure it's over\". Sweet lowers Carl's gun however, instead deciding that Tenpenny \"killed himself in a traffic accident, no one to blame\", possibly so that nobody can link any of them or Grove Street Families to Tenpenny's demise. &lt;a href=\"The%20Truth\"&gt;The Truth&lt;/a&gt; then appears, congratulating Carl for \"beating the system\", a feat which Truth claims would take ages for himself to achieve. Carl informs the others about Big Smoke's death, with Kendl remarking about how Smoke was only out for himself, a statement that The Truth agrees with, referring to it as the \"surest path to Hell\" (\"That or forty pounds of mescaline\"). As Truth, Sweet, Cesar, and Kendl walk away, Carl checks Tenpenny's corpse, before swiftly kicking it and mocking by mimicking Tenpenny's usual greetings towards him with: \"See you around... Officer\".\nWith that, the group reconvene inside the &lt;a href=\"Johnson%20House\"&gt;Johnson House&lt;/a&gt; to talk about their future, with Kendl discussing their ventures in &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;, remarking on how \"shit never ends\". &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Ken Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg\"&gt;Madd Dogg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kent%20Paul\"&gt;Kent Paul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maccer\"&gt;Maccer&lt;/a&gt; enter the house, causing the rather paranoid group to ready their guns, then lower them upon seeing who it is. Madd Dogg announces his first gold record, and they all celebrate their success, and Maccer gleefully announces that he will be getting breast implants before Carl heads out of the house \"fittin' to hit the block, see what's happening\". Outside, &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt; calls for the last time while having sex with her boyfriend &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt;, in a failed attempt to make Carl jealous. Carl expresses his annoyance and disgust at Catalina, telling her to get help.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nPost-Mission Phone Call Script.\nCarl Johnson: \"Eh, whassup?\"\nCatalina: (Heavy breathing)\nCarl Johnson: \"Hello?\"\nCatalina: \"Yes, Claude, faster, harder, DEEPER! Oh, yes, yes, YES!\"\nCarl Johnson: \"Catalina! You sick! Get help!\"\nCatalina: \"And you, Carl, you are jealous!\"\nAftermath.\nAlthough this is the final mission of the game, the game itself does not actually end upon its conclusion. Following the closing &lt;a href=\"cutscene\"&gt;cutscene&lt;/a&gt; and credits, Carl is back on Grove Street. The &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Riots\"&gt;riots&lt;/a&gt; subside, and a final &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20Talk%20Radio%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;WCTR&lt;/a&gt; news report is broadcast detailing the aftermath of the riots. One last phone call from Catalina is received, after which Carl is free to roam about San Andreas as the game enters pure sandbox mode. Any leftover non-storyline missions such as the Zero, Wang Cars, and Casino strands can still be played out, as can street races, etc.\nIn sandbox mode, certain aspects of the San Andreas universe continue to play out. Progress with the various &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;girlfriends&lt;/a&gt; will still go up and down depending on whether Carl continues to date them or not; Carl's physical condition will still change depending on actions like working out and eating; enemy gang members may still randomly shoot at Carl when he passes.\nAlso, &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Warfare%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;Gang Warfare&lt;/a&gt; conditions still apply, meaning Carl will still need to defend territory in Los Santos should any neighboring enemy gang areas remain.\nFinally, if &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;100% Completion&lt;/a&gt; has been attained by this point, the various rewards will become available after the closing credits."}

{"id": "42898", "revid": "4255233", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=42898", "title": "End of the Line/Walkthrough", "text": "The following is a walkthrough of the &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;End of the Line&lt;/a&gt; mission in .\nWalkthrough.\nBring strong weapons, because many enemies also carry strong weapons too. It's recommended to bring the AK-47 at first, as there are enemies holding M4, which should be picked up later to clear up far enemies. A minigun may be a good choice to clear the rooms. Dating &lt;a href=\"Katie%20Zhan\"&gt;Katie Zhan&lt;/a&gt; is highly recommended, as &lt;a href=\"CJ\"&gt;CJ&lt;/a&gt; will not lose his weapons after &lt;a href=\"wasted\"&gt;dying&lt;/a&gt;. Also, it is recommended for the player to complete the &lt;a href=\"Paramedic%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;Paramedic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vigilante%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;Vigilante&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Firefighter%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;Firefighter&lt;/a&gt; side missions, as doing so will increase CJ's maximum &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, and he will also become fire-proof.\nWhen starting the mission get in the car with Sweet and driver to the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke%27s%20Crack%20Palace\"&gt;crack fortress&lt;/a&gt;. Once you arrive, take the bicycle or just walk to the &lt;a href=\"S.W.A.T.%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;SWAT Tank&lt;/a&gt; and steal it. If you have to, kill the gangsters first and then take the SWAT. Now drive the SWAT Tank back to the crack fortress and ram its front wall to break a hole in it. The tank cannot be saved without failing the mission. You enter the building on the ground floor and must work up to floor 3. Crouch to improve your accuracy, as it is very useful. Take cover when fighting in big rooms and carefully take out all enemies since there is no time limit. Repeat this process until you reach &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Big Smoke&lt;/a&gt;. After the cutscene use your assault rifle to fight Big Smoke, if you have one, use a &lt;a href=\"flamethrower\"&gt;flamethrower&lt;/a&gt; and burn Smoke when getting close enough, as Smoke will not attack you and will run around the room, better still, he loses health when burning so you can easily take him out. You can also use a minigun to kill him in 2 seconds, because it deals massive damage.\nAfter the next cutscene, &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Tenpenny\"&gt;Frank Tenpenny&lt;/a&gt; will shoot a generator, causing it to explode. Use your &lt;a href=\"Night%20Vision\"&gt;night vision goggles&lt;/a&gt; to help your way through the dark. Upon reaching a burning floor, just use the fire extinguisher to put out the flames, if you beat the firefighter side-mission, just walk through it as you're fireproof. On the PC version, crouching and aiming the camera upwards from the ground up will significantly improve visibility. The time limit is generous and it is still possible to kill all enemies without panicking or being fireproof.\nWhen you escape the fire, Tenpenny will drive away in his &lt;a href=\"Firetruck%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;firetruck&lt;/a&gt; with Sweet hanging off the ladder, when entering the parked &lt;a href=\"Feltzer\"&gt;Feltzer&lt;/a&gt; just simply do what the game says; Follow Tenpenny and make sure Sweet is safe, stay close to the firetruck and DO NOT lose Tenpenny. Do not attempt to damge the firetruck or you may injure Sweet. Be careful of traffic in this mission as Tenpenny's route never changes and he isn't programmed to crash, Tenpenny's firetruck is &lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicles\"&gt;indestructable&lt;/a&gt;, so don't bother trying to destroy it. Also watch out for a train when going down the tracks. You don't actually need to follow the truck up on the Mexican-inhabited hills in Las Colinas, nor on the rail track in Willowfield. Stay on the paved road within the closest possible direct distance from Tenpenny's truck, and it will be enough not to \"lose\" it. Driving unusually slowly is normal while taking this approach.\nOnce reaching &lt;a href=\"East%20Beach\"&gt;East Beach&lt;/a&gt;, a cop will attempt to kill Sweet by stamping on his fingers. It is important that you are very close to the truck before this happens. Driving on the opposite lane helps avoid some scripted collisions. Once you have caught Sweet, he takes the wheel and you have to shoot. Kill Tenpenny's goons and take out any cop cars or Vagos following you, keep doing this until Tenpenny finally crashes off a bridge onto &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt;. After the final cutscene the &lt;a href=\"Credits%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;Credits&lt;/a&gt; will commence. Once they are over &lt;a href=\"CJ\"&gt;CJ&lt;/a&gt; will walk out the house and the mission will be passed."}

There, Pegorino asks him to conduct a heroin deal with &lt;a href=\"Dimitri%20Rascalov\"&gt;Dimitri Rascalov&lt;/a&gt;, which Pegorino will pay Niko $250,000 for. Niko, however, is reluctant to do so because of the animosity between him and Rascalov. After Pegorino leaves, Niko phones his cousin &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; and friend &lt;a href=\"Kate%20McReary\"&gt;Kate McReary&lt;/a&gt;. Roman encourages Niko to conduct the deal, claiming Rascalov has changed and that Roman can use the money to take himself and Niko on holiday. Kate, however, urges Niko not to do the deal, claiming that he should not sacrifice his principles for money or take his chances with Rascalov.\nAfter this phone call is made, a green dollar sign icon appears on the map for the Deal option, and a red dagger icon appears on the map for the Revenge option. To make their choice, the player simply enters that icon to start the first mission of the chosen ending route.\nDeal.\n&lt;a href=\"If%20the%20Price%20is%20Right\"&gt;If the Price is Right&lt;/a&gt; ($250,000).\nIf the player chooses Deal, Niko meets &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Bell\"&gt;Phil Bell&lt;/a&gt; in a townhouse in &lt;a href=\"Tudor\"&gt;Tudor&lt;/a&gt;. They drive to &lt;a href=\"Port%20Tudor\"&gt;Port Tudor&lt;/a&gt; where the deal is to take place. It turns out however that Rascalov is after \"his\" revenge. He killed the people who Niko was supposed to make the deal with. Niko and Phil, in the third-parties compound, decide to steal the money, with Niko planning to kill Rascalov later.\nThey enter the warehouse from the roof, and find themselves in a gunfight. After killing most of the men, they make their way to the room with the money, only to see someone else escaping with it. They chase the thief down, killing him and collect their money. Niko takes Phil back to Tudor and both of them declare themselves \"out\" of the crime business.\n&lt;a href=\"Mr.%20%26amp%3B%20Mrs.%20Bellic\"&gt;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bellic&lt;/a&gt; (No Reward).\nThe day before Roman's wedding to &lt;a href=\"Mallorie%20Bardas\"&gt;Mallorie Bardas&lt;/a&gt;, Niko phones Kate and informs her that he chose to do the deal with Rascalov. Kate becomes angry at Niko for sacrificing his principles and refuses to come to the wedding.\nThe next day, Niko goes to the wedding alone and witnesses Roman and Mallorie get married. During the celebrations outside the church, a &lt;a href=\"Wedding%20Assassin\"&gt;man&lt;/a&gt; walks up behind Niko and points a gun at him, claiming it is \"a gift from Dimitri Rascalov\". Niko wrestles with the man, and after a stray shot is fired, succeeds in forcing the pistol back and shooting the man in the head. The stray shot, however, had hit Roman in the chest and killed him. Enraged at his cousin's death, Niko shoots the man's body until the gun runs out of ammunition and then starts kicking it. Niko's friend &lt;a href=\"Little%20Jacob\"&gt;Jacob&lt;/a&gt; restrains him and tells him to go home, promising Niko that he will find Rascalov.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Revenger%27s%20Tragedy\"&gt;A Revenger's Tragedy&lt;/a&gt; (No Reward).\nThe following morning, Niko receives a phone call from Jacob who explains that he has found some of Rascalov's men. Niko meets Jacob in Alderney and they chase the men to an &lt;a href=\"Alderney%20Casino\"&gt;abandoned casino&lt;/a&gt;. Despite Jacob wanting to aid Niko in the fight, Niko insists he 'must do this alone'. Niko tells Jacob that if he really wants to help, he should find a way to help him escape. After fighting through Rascalov's men, Niko fights his way into the casino.\nInside the casino, Niko witnesses Rascalov execute Jimmy Pegorino, with Rascalov claiming he wants to keep the money for himself.\nRascalov spots Niko and flees to the casino's roof. On the roof, Rascalov boards a helicopter. Niko grabs hold of the helicopter but one of Rascalov's men stomps on one of Niko's hands, causing him to fall off.\nNiko lands in the ocean and jumps into a nearby boat and resumes chase. In the middle of the chase, Jacob arrives in a helicopter and tells Niko to get in. Niko stands up on the boat and pulls himself up into Jacob's &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt;, where he takes the wheel.\nAfter a brief chase, both helicopters crash on &lt;a href=\"Happiness%20Island\"&gt;Happiness Island&lt;/a&gt;, where Niko chases and kills Rascalov for his betrayal and for orchestrating Roman's death. Jacob arrives and congratulates Niko for \"winning\", before both men walk away from Rascalov's body and leave the Island.\nFollowing this, Niko receives a call from Mallorie, who informs Niko that she is pregnant with Roman's child. Niko promises Mallorie that her child \"will never have to worry about anything\". Niko later receives a call from Kate, who laments Roman's death, and states that she'll be there for Niko if he ever needs her.\nRevenge.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Dish%20Served%20Cold\"&gt;A Dish Served Cold&lt;/a&gt; (No Reward).\nIf the player chooses Revenge, Niko betrays Pegorino and confronts Rascalov alone on the &lt;a href=\"Platypus\"&gt;Platypus&lt;/a&gt; ship docked in &lt;a href=\"East%20Hook\"&gt;East Hook&lt;/a&gt;, which the heroin is being unloaded from. After fighting his way onto the ship, Niko confronts Rascalov in the ship's cargo hold. After a brief gunfight in which Niko kills Rascalov's guards, Niko confronts a severely-injured Rascalov. Rascalov claims that killing him would be a \"big mistake\", but Niko ignores this and executes Rascalov.\nNiko disembarks from the ship and phones Roman when he is back on the docks, claiming \"it ended where it began\" (the Platypus was the ship that brought Niko to Liberty City). Roman expresses his disappointment at not getting the money, but appreciates that Rascalov will not bother them any more. Phil Bell also phones Niko, telling him that he made the right decision and that Phil didn't trust Rascalov either. However, Jimmy Pegorino and the Pegorinos are \"falling apart\" due to the deal not going through, and because of this, Phil and Niko cannot speak to each other anymore. Both men part on good terms.\n&lt;a href=\"Mr.%20%26amp%3B%20Mrs.%20Bellic\"&gt;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bellic&lt;/a&gt; (No Reward).\nOn the morning of Roman's wedding to Mallorie Bardas, Niko phones Kate and tells her that he \"cut his ties\" with Rascalov. Kate congratulates Niko for this and tells him that she will be coming to the wedding. Niko picks Kate up from her mother's house and they drive to the church. During the journey, Niko expresses his desire to leave his criminal lifestyle behind, and that he also wants to get to know Kate better.\nNiko and Kate arrive at the church and witness Roman and Mallorie get married. During the celebrations outside, a black car drives past and an enraged Jimmy Pegorino fires at the crowd whilst shouting \"You fucking double-crossing immigrant shit!\" at Niko. The car speeds off and during the chaos, Niko reveals that Kate has been killed. Roman tells Niko not to blame himself, but Niko lashes out and claims he is responsible. Jacob Hughes and Roman calm Niko down, promising they will find Pegorino. Niko flees the scene and off-screen returns to the &lt;a href=\"South%20Bohan%20Safehouse\"&gt;South Bohan Safehouse&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Out%20of%20Commission\"&gt;Out of Commission&lt;/a&gt; ($250,000).\nThe following day, Niko receives a phone call from Jacob and Roman, who explain that they have found some of Pegorino's men. After meeting the duo, they chase the men through Alderney to an abandoned casino. Niko tells Jacob to lead Roman to safety, before fighting his way through the casino and chasing Pegorino out of the building.\nOutside, Pegorino boards a &lt;a href=\"Squalo\"&gt;speedboat&lt;/a&gt; and escapes on the water. Niko steals a &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;dirtbike&lt;/a&gt; and chases the boat on land, before jumping onto an &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt; piloted by Jacob and Roman.\nAfter a brief chase, Niko disables Pegorino's speedboat with the Annihilator's miniguns, while an RPG shot damages the helicopter's engines and forces it to land, both parties now ending up on &lt;a href=\"Happiness%20Island\"&gt;Happiness Island&lt;/a&gt;. Niko chases and kills Pegorino for killing Kate. Roman and Jacob tell Niko that it is \"over\" and Niko has \"won\".

Steve orders Franklin to kill Trevor, due to the latter's uncontrollable temper making him a liability for the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt;. Later, &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt; appears and orders Franklin to kill Michael, due to Michael interfering in Devin's business ventures, with Devin also holding Michael responsible for the &lt;a href=\"Legal%20Trouble\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Molly%20Schultz\"&gt;his lawyer&lt;/a&gt;. Franklin (the player) then has to choose which of the two he is going to kill. Alternatively, Franklin can ignore both Steve and Devin, and team up with Michael and Trevor to eliminate all their enemies.\nChoice A: \"Kill Trevor\".\nShould the player choose to kill Trevor, the mission &lt;a href=\"Something%20Sensible\"&gt;Something Sensible&lt;/a&gt; commences. Franklin sets up a meeting with Trevor, where he begins discussing the problems they are facing, but Trevor thinks this is about Michael and laments how he had been backstabbing towards him.\nFranklin pulls a gun on Trevor, claiming that Trevor was the \"crazy one\", not Michael, and he would most likely end up getting all three of them killed.

During chase, Franklin receives a call from Michael for help. Michael then appears in a stolen &lt;a href=\"Premier\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; and rams into the side of Trevor's truck, causing the latter to crash into a gas tanker.\nA battered and broken Trevor angrily denounces Franklin and Michael as \"Judases\", ordering Franklin to \"take the shot\". Franklin shoots the fuel, igniting it and burning Trevor to death, before the fuel tanker explodes (If Franklin takes too long and doesn't shoot Trevor, Michael will instead).\nMichael and Franklin reflect on their journey and go their separate ways. Michael still considers Franklin as a close friend of his, but Trevor's death has affected him deeply and says he needs time from Franklin. After the credits, the player can only choose to play as Michael and Franklin, and Trevor's cut from the &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Union Depository bank job&lt;/a&gt; is split between them.\nCredit soundtrack: Yeasayer - Don't Come Close\nChoice B: \"Kill Michael\".\nShould the player choose to kill Michael, the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Time%27s%20Come\"&gt;The Time's Come&lt;/a&gt; commences. Franklin sets up a meeting with Michael and calls Trevor for assistance, but Trevor refuses and claims he's \"done with traitors\".\nFranklin confronts Michael wishing to discuss their present situation. Michael meets Franklin and is seen taking a phone call from his &lt;a href=\"Amanda%20De%20Santa\"&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt;. She tells him that &lt;a href=\"Tracey%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Tracey&lt;/a&gt; will be attending college, which Michael replies to positively. Franklin feels anguished after hearing this, but overcomes it and talks suspiciously, causing Michael to figure out that Franklin is sent to kill him.\nMichael then drives away, with Franklin chasing him to the &lt;a href=\"Palmer-Taylor%20Power%20Station\"&gt;Palmer-Taylor Power Station&lt;/a&gt;. Michael climbs to the top of a generator tower, where Franklin overpowers him. Michael then laments how he was the only person who gave Franklin a chance. Franklin pushes Michael off the edge before grabbing him, clearly starting to regret his decision. Michael refuses to forgive Franklin and claims he should have killed him when he &lt;a href=\"Complications\"&gt;broke into Michael's house&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe game gives the player a choice to hoist Michael up or drop him. Regardless of what the player decides, Michael's fate will be the same, since if he's spared, he will headbutt Franklin, losing his grip and fall to his death. Franklin walks away and calls &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar&lt;/a&gt; on the phone to make amends.\nAfter the credits, the player can only choose to play as Franklin and Trevor and Michael's cut of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Union Depository bank job&lt;/a&gt; is given to his family. Trevor finds out about Michael's death, and warns Franklin to stay away from him, claiming that Franklin is \"dead\" to him. Amanda also finds out about Franklin's involvement and messages him, claiming that she knows that he killed her husband, before warning him to stay away from her and her family, and wishing that Franklin \"rots in hell\". &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Jimmy&lt;/a&gt; discovers that his father suddenly disappeared, and after finding out about his death he calls both Trevor and Franklin, seeking consolation with the former and cursing the latter.\nCredit soundtrack: The Chain Gang of 1974 - Sleepwalking\nChoice C: Deathwish.\nShould the player choose \"Deathwish,\" the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;The Third Way&lt;/a&gt; commences. In this mission, Franklin goes to &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester&lt;/a&gt; for help. Franklin and Lester, at first, seem to not have any hope of thinking of a way for both Trevor and Michael to survive. But after a brainstorm, Lester comes up with a plan. They lead the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Merryweather\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt; into a trap at the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Banks%20Steel%20Foundry\"&gt;foundry&lt;/a&gt; under the pretense of melting down the gold acquired from the Union Depository heist. \nFranklin, Michael, Lamar, and Trevor fight both the FIB\u2019s strike team and Merryweather mercenaries. Once the FIB and Merryweather teams have all been defeated, the trio set out plans for taking down their enemies, and manage to locate them with help from Lester. \nTrevor volunteers to kill &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Haines\"&gt;Steve Haines&lt;/a&gt;, Michael sets out to kill &lt;a href=\"Harold%20Joseph\"&gt;Harold \"Stretch\" Joseph&lt;/a&gt;, and Franklin sets out to kill &lt;a href=\"Wei%20Cheng\"&gt;Wei Cheng&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce Stretch, Haines and Cheng have been killed, Trevor heads to Devin Weston's heavily guarded &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston%27s%20Mansion\"&gt;mansion&lt;/a&gt;, killing Devin's security guards. He locates Devin in a chest and knocks him out, carrying him to his &lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; and throwing him in the trunk. He phones Michael and Franklin, suggesting they take Weston to the countryside and \"make him disappear\".\nThe trio reunite at the &lt;a href=\"Chiliad%20Mountain%20State%20Wilderness\"&gt;Chiliad Mountain State Wilderness&lt;/a&gt;, where they taunt a battered and beaten Devin, before pushing the car off the cliff into the sea. The car explodes in a fireball, killing Devin instantly. The three bring an end to their criminal careers, but remain as \"flawed, awful, totally uncomfortable and poorly matched\" friends. The three then drive off to their respective homes, before Lester sends their cuts from the Union Depository heist into their bank accounts.\nCredit soundtrack: Favored Nations - The Setup"}

The front area consist of chrome front forks with black triple clamps, black fork legs with rubber covers, a colored mudguard below the lower clamp and a circular headlight between the clamps. The handlebars have dual supports and feature small circular turn signals on either side.\nThe main body of the bike features a split lower frame and a lower cover for the engine bay. The fuel tank has a small fuel cap offset to the right side and bears a set of badges displaying the name and the manufacturer emblems. The main seat is finished in black and uses a plastic strap attaching it to the main body, while two large side cover can be seen with \"CR 250\" badges on them. The engine features a chrome frame on the right side, intended to keep the rider's right leg away from the heat of the right exhaust pipe.\nThe rear area features a long rear fender with a single rectangular tail light and two cupircular turn signals attached to it, while the double-sided swingarm features dual suspension springs. The chain drive is seen on the left side of the swingarm, while the exhaust muffler is seen on the right side of the rear fender. The bike uses a single analog speedometer dial, which is the same \"Sports Bike\" speedometer seen on many sport bikes.\nThe Enduro can only be painted with a single color for the fenders, fuel tank, lower front cover and side panels. It uses the same wheel design as the &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;Sanchez&lt;/a&gt;, being an off-road derivative of the \"Wires\" rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.

Its engine sound is the same from the Sanchez.\nSpecial Variants.\nMoving Target.\nPre-modified variants of the Enduro can appear as a random Moving Target vehicle in the &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events\"&gt;Freemode Event&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moving%20Target\"&gt;Moving Target&lt;/a&gt;, as part of the &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events%20Update\"&gt;Freemode Events Update&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nEnhanced version"}

{"id": "2131", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2131", "title": "Enforcer", "text": "The Enforcer is a law enforcement vehicle featured in both the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;. It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Brute\"&gt;Brute&lt;/a&gt; in the HD Universe.\nDesign.\nIn all of its appearances, the Enforcer is depicted as a large armored transport van used by the law enforcement (specifically, elite paramilitary tactical units). The Enforcer is an excellent choice, as its heavy weight makes it suitable for ramming power and also serves as a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Roadblocks\"&gt;roadblock&lt;/a&gt; vehicle when needed. One of the noticeable features is that the player will gain &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Body Armor&lt;/a&gt; upon entry of the vehicle.\n3D Universe.\nBetween \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\", the Enforcer is designed as a truck-based, long chassis emergency response vehicle, apparently based on a 1980s-1990s NYPD Freightliner \"E33\" Emergency Service Unit truck &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.flickr.com/photos/34444432%40N04/3420254530/sizes/o/\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.flickr.com/photos/av8pix/2574479475/sizes/l/\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, similar in body construction, livery design and minor details and also on the Ford L-Series; differences were negligible between games.\nThe Enforcer usually bears \"POLICE\" markings, except in ' and ', where it has \"SWAT\" markings (as some forces ceased to officially use the term SWAT over time, this may be seen as a nod to historical accuracy). Police liveries of the Enforcer depend largely on those found on local &lt;a href=\"Police%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;Police cars&lt;/a&gt;, although for \"GTA Vice City Stories\", the game's Enforcer features a black-and-white livery, contrary to the \"VCPD Cruiser\"'s green-and-white livery. Much like the \"Police\" car, the Enforcer in \"GTA III\" is revealed in a pre-release screenshot to originally feature a blue-and-white livery; it can be assumed that the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City may have prompted the same recoloring that gave the vehicle its present black-and-white color.\nAs with all emergency/police vehicles, the Enforcer is equipped with sirens and lights which will cause other traffic to move out of the way when active. Although supposedly heavily armored, the truck is not bulletproof, although it is relatively resilient. It has seating for up to four people, including the driver.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;, the Enforcer is now based on an armored , with the front turning signals omitted (which, in-game, shares the same chassis with the &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Securicar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Stockade\"&gt;Police Stockade&lt;/a&gt;).\nIt bears the &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; livery and \"Liberty City &lt;a href=\"Tactical%20Response%20Unit\"&gt;Tactical Response Unit&lt;/a&gt;\" markings. It comes with a black finish and cannot be washed at a car wash like every other emergency vehicle. Like the &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Cruiser\"&gt;NOOSE Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Patriot\"&gt;NOOSE Patriot&lt;/a&gt;, the Enforcer is equipped with an LED light bar that does not make a distorted sound after being crushed or shot with a weapon.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe overall performance of the vehicle is average-to-good. While large and heavy, the powerful engine of the Enforcer allows it to accelerate well and reach high top speeds, while its cornering can be properly negotiated via the use of the handbrake. Its low clearance, small wheels and heavy weight, however, make it unsuited on rough terrain, where it may roll easily.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the Enforcer returns with a decreased top speed and less power than its 3D Universe counterpart. The vehicle still has a high top speed, however the acceleration minimizes the potential of the truck reaching it. The handling was also restricted; the truck now makes very slow turns, and the truck tends to tilt heavily upon cornering. Deformation is a rarity, unless the truck is faced with a explosive such as a &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"APC\"&gt;APC&lt;/a&gt;'s cannon. The truck is also very heavy, being on par with the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;, whereby the truck makes good use of crashing or pushing other road users out of the way, with only scratches on the truck. Braking is also acceptable, beating trucks like the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;, however its weight still prevents additional braking power.\nThe vehicle is heavily armored with \"impregnable armor\", rendering it almost completely bulletproof; while most vehicles can be destroyed by a shotgun shell to the fuel tank in front of the rear wheels, this does not apply to the Enforcer. The vehicle is still vulnerable to explosive damage, and while a steel mesh covers the windshield and protects the driver and front passenger from frontal assault, the cabin's side windows are not armored. It takes at least 10 &lt;a href=\"APC\"&gt;APC&lt;/a&gt; cannon rounds or &lt;a href=\"Explosive%20Shotgun\"&gt;Explosive Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; rounds to trigger the Enforcer to burn and explode.\nThe rear axle of this vehicle is also unique as compared to most of the heavy vehicles in \"GTA IV\", as instead of having double wheel for each side of the rear axle, this vehicle has only one wheel for each side of the rear axle which is uncommon for most heavy vehicles. It is stated by the badges to have an 8000cc (8 liter) turbocharged engine, true to its engine model, a turbocharged Inline-4. According to the fuel unit on the side of the truck, the vehicle uses unleaded fuel.\nLocations.\nIn all of its appearances, the Enforcer is called out once the player has reached a four-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; (three in \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\"), containing &lt;a href=\"Special%20Weapons%20and%20Tactics\"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt; Officers (or, in the case of the HD Universe, &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tactical%20Response%20Unit\"&gt;Tactical Response Unit&lt;/a&gt; officers)."}

It\u2019s evident that he still uses, as he commonly offers Tony the drug when setting up the Player\u2019s nightclub.\nDave is very difficult to anger, and has only a few lines of dialogue where he is actually aggressive: If the player\u2019s Nightclub popularity dips below 50%, the player will eventually receive a call from English Dave, wherein he will be very annoyed to how they have been mistreating his services and suggests that they do some club promotions immediately.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nAfter Hours.\n&lt;br&gt;\nDave is an associate of &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt; who is enlisted by Tony and the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;\"GTA Online\" Protagonist&lt;/a&gt; to help with setting up a successful &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs\"&gt;nightclub&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2018\"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter introducing himself to the player and dismissing &lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones\"&gt;Lazlow Jones&lt;/a&gt;, Tony introduces Dave who recommends European DJ talent to make the new club successful. After completing some basic setup alone, the player travels to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSIA&lt;/a&gt; with Dave to pick up &lt;a href=\"Solomun\"&gt;Solomun&lt;/a&gt;, the first DJ he has booked. They then have to chase Solomun's private &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;jet&lt;/a&gt; until it crash-lands at &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores%20Airfield\"&gt;Sandy Shores Airfield&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf the player chooses to &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs/Resident%20DJ\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tale%20of%20Us\"&gt;Tale of Us&lt;/a&gt;, Dave will call them and tell them that they need to use an &lt;a href=\"Enus\"&gt;Enus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stafford\"&gt;Stafford&lt;/a&gt; to collect them at &lt;a href=\"LSIA\"&gt;LSIA&lt;/a&gt;. Since they cannot hire one, the player is required to steal one from a transporter. Once the player steals the car, they meet Dave at the airport waiting for Tale of Us to arrive. They then drive Dave and the DJs to the club in the Stafford when it is revealed that there was no such rider and any car would have sufficed, a mix-up Dave blames on &lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones\"&gt;Lazlow Jones&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the player books &lt;a href=\"Dixon\"&gt;Dixon&lt;/a&gt; they are called by Dave and told to meet the pair at &lt;a href=\"The%20Richman%20Hotel\"&gt;The Richman Hotel&lt;/a&gt;. When the player arrives it is revealed that Dave has just been robbed of Dixon's backpack but he spots the thief hurrying past before he can leave with his accomplice waiting on a motorbike. While Dave distracts the unaware Dixon, the player has to follow and kill the thief to retrieve the stolen bag, return to the hotel and drive Dave and Dixon back to the club.\nOnce the player books the fourth and final DJ, &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Madonna\"&gt;The Black Madonna&lt;/a&gt;, they receive a call from Dave informing them that she has been arrested at a rave and needs to be airlifted out via a &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt;. Once the player rescues her (and indirectly a police officer) and returns to the helipad near Vespucci beach they proceed to drive back to club.\nWhen the player is not otherwise engaged in free roam activities, Dave may call them to ask if they can help out with the DJ's. These include collecting or rescuing the DJ's friends, recovering stolen vinyl, or stealing sound equipment from &lt;a href=\"AKAN%20Records\"&gt;AKAN Records&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cayo Perico Heist.\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn &lt;a href=\"2020\"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;, English Dave appears in the introductory cutscene when entering the VIP table area of &lt;a href=\"The%20Music%20Locker\"&gt;The Music Locker&lt;/a&gt; nightclub, seemingly well acquainted with the &lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Cartel\"&gt;Madrazo family&lt;/a&gt; as he converses and engages in activities such as drinking and even smoking drugs. English Dave will expand on some details about &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Strickler\"&gt;Juan Strickler&lt;/a&gt; on top of other ramblings. He then goes to the dance floor and leaves the protagonist to speak with &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Madrazo\"&gt;Miguel Madrazo&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnglish Dave is seen once again when the player initiates their first scope-out mission, appearing at LSIA with two other female partygoers. He will explain and encourage the player before handing them a camera to take pictures with the two girls as he continues to explain the plan. His photoshoot is cut short when &lt;a href=\"Keinemusik\"&gt;Keinemusik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Dre\"&gt;Dr. Dre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"DJ%20Pooh\"&gt;DJ Pooh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Iovine\"&gt;Jimmy Iovine&lt;/a&gt; arrive to the airport to join them in going to &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico\"&gt;Cayo Perico&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;. His brief interactions show he is well acquainted and good friends with all the respective DJs.\nUpon the group's arrival to Cayo Perico, English Dave converses with Juan Strickler as he welcomes them, before joining him in a &lt;a href=\"Winky\"&gt;Winky&lt;/a&gt;, with the protagonist driving, going to the &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico%20Beach%20Party\"&gt;Cayo Perico Beach Party&lt;/a&gt;. On the way, he offers up a USB stick containing a mix to \"get them in the mood\" which Juan throws away. After Juan's speech and shoutout at the party, English Dave will instruct the player to blend in a bit and look for an opportunity to slip past security in order to begin scoping out the island before returning to Los Santos.\nWhen the player is done , English Dave will meet the player back at the &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico%20Airstrip\"&gt;airstrip&lt;/a&gt; but decides against returning to Los Santos, stating that he'll find his own way back. He continues to reside at Cayo Perico, usually at the beach party, either dancing or meditating at the water's edge.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist\"&gt;The Cayo Perico Heist&lt;/a&gt;, English Dave can be found in a locked cage next to Juan Strickler's &lt;a href=\"Panther%20%28animal%29\"&gt;panther cage&lt;/a&gt;, seemingly high and unaware of his surroundings. He will be shirtless and wearing a bandanna. If the player raises the alarm, English Dave will cower in fear in the corner of his cage, but if stealth has yet to be broken, he will wander aimlessly in his cage, making random comments and other non-sense. He may also be seen sitting on the floor, meditating.\nEnglish Dave is not rescued by the protagonist, but he will send a text message informing the player that he remembers some of the events that unfolded and is now back at Los Santos after being released by Juan Strickler. Despite being previously released from captivity, he may randomly appear in the cage in subsequent heist repeats. \nAfter the Heist, he will return to the beach party and &lt;a href=\"DJ%20Requests\"&gt;enlist the help&lt;/a&gt; of the player to run errands for Keinemusik. He will be seen once again at the water's edge or on the dance floor. Upon completion of Keinemusik's errands, Dave will gift his &lt;a href=\"Weevil\"&gt;Weevil&lt;/a&gt; to the player. Dave will also maintain his association with the Nightclub and will continue to ask the protagonist to do side jobs for the various DJs and participate in DJ-recruitment missions."}

{"id": "2015", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2015", "title": "Entertainment Software Rating Board", "text": "The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) are a self-regulatory organization that applies and enforces ratings, advertising guidelines, and online privacy principles for computer and video games and other entertainment software in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; (officially adopted by individual provinces 2004-2005). It was established in 1994 by the . By early &lt;a href=\"2003\"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;, it had rated over 8,000 titles submitted by 350 video game publishers. Many believe that the ESRB may promote media restriction, while others think that it is necessary for software to have content ratings. The decision to found the ESRB was influenced by the graphic \"fatality\" killing moves of \"\" and other controversial video games depicting violent or sexual situations at the time, and by pressure from the United States government.\nOverview.\nThe ESRB applies ratings to games based on their content, similar to the motion picture rating systems used in many countries. Their aim is to aid consumers in determining a game's content and suitability. A game's rating is displayed on its box, the media, in advertisements and on game web sites.\nThe rating system is voluntary, and companies do not have to submit a game for rating before selling it. However, almost all game publishers in the United States use the system.\nThe rating has two parts: \"rating symbols\" and \"content descriptors\". The rating symbols are usually found on the lower right or the lower left hand corner on the front of the box, they suggest what age group the game is best suited for. The content descriptors are found on the back of the box, usually in the lower left or right hand corner, they describe particular content elements that may be of interest or concern.\nSymbols.\nThe symbols the ESRB uses are stylized depictions of alphabetical letters meant to convey at a glance a game's suitability. Although they were originally white with a black outline (as seen in the K-A rating logo), the rating letters have been displayed as entirely black letters (in order to be more legible) since the later part of 1999. Historic criticism of this ratings system has centered on its vague definitions of age groups and reliance on seemingly arbitrary lettering systems. Below is a table explaining the ESRB ratings system, with descriptions of what each letter represents.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\" Game Ratings.\nThe ESRB have rated \"GTA\" games ranging from T (Teen) to AO (Adults only), though the majority of games in the series have been given a rating of M (Mature). \"\" was famously re-rated following the &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Coffee\"&gt;Hot Coffee&lt;/a&gt; incident, where its M rating was removed and changed to AO. A 2nd edition of the game was released shortly after, and the game regained its M rating.\nThe \"GTA\" series is rated as follows:\nContent Descriptors.\nPlease note that the content descriptors are not always printed as shown below, they may have additional words added to further clarify the highlighted content such as \"\"Mild\" Blood\" and \"\"Mild\" Suggestive Themes\".\nDiscontinued Content Descriptors.\nThe following content descriptors have been updated and are no longer used, but they may appear on games published previously."}

It also borrows some design cues from the , such as on the lower front fascia and the side vents. The headlights are taken from the , while the bonnet seems to be borrowed from the .\nDesign.\nThe Entity MT shares a similar profile to the &lt;a href=\"Entity%20XF\"&gt;Entity XF&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Entity%20XXR\"&gt;Entity XXR&lt;/a&gt;, but assumes a more aggressive styling and a more rounded profile. The front bumper features a large splitter at its base and three inset front ducts, the central one spanning half the car's width and having a central separation. Around the upper area, the headlight units are placed in a more parallel positioning relative to the car, featuring L-shaped modern strips as the main units and small square-shaped lamps as the high-beam units, along with inner strips as the indicators. The car's bonnet features an impression on the centre that parallel to the seams of the lid and the manufacturer emblem.\nThe side profile bears similarities to the XXR, where it features a CFRP skirt at its base and small amber marker lamps on the front fender areas, as well as the presence of dual impressions that allow airflow to the main engine air ducts and exit from the front brakes. Behind the lower impression, the body features a CF body accent bearing silver \"ENTITY\" lettering, similar to the XF and XXR models. The body assumes a slanted profile up to the rear arches, where painted wing mirrors are seen on the doors. The main section of the car's greenhouse is more or less identical to the XF's and the XXR's; it features a bold C-shaped arrangement for its windscreen, side windows and roof, the latter having a glass pane and plastic separation on top. Behind the cabin area are two smaller intakes leading to the engine bay and a larger glass pane exposing the engine, along with two large CF fins running parallel to the rear glass and silver \"MT\" badges near the side windows. This section acts a large clamp that hinges from behind the cabin area, and opens to reveal the engine bay with various CF panels around.\nThe rear of the car is rather curved in comparison to the XF and the XXR model, with a deep ridge on the centre and two small openings on the edges, together with small red tail lamps above the same openings. The lower area houses a wide vented area with two horizontal dividers, the upper one leaving a small gap for the twin circular exhaust tips, and the lower one leaving a gap for the number plate. Either side of the car are two small CF panels with reverse lamps just below the lower divider and two large diffusers with three fins each, as well as the silver \"MT\" badge on the passenger side, between the dividers. Should the player opt to upgrade the Entity MT in Hao\u2019s Special Works, a HSW badge will be present on the rear of the car, next to the \"MT\" badging. The underside of the car is mostly carbon plated, leaving the axle sections and part of the engine bay exposed.\nThe interior is reused from the Entity XXR, being the same one from the &lt;a href=\"X80%20Proto\"&gt;X80 Proto&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Visione\"&gt;Visione&lt;/a&gt;. The manufacturer emblem can be seen on the horn cap, as well as a small window behind the seats that provide view to the engine bay.\nThe car is prominently painted in a primary colour, with the central separation on the front, the mirror wings, the grooves on the rims, the brake calipers and the interior stitching being painted with a secondary colour. A trim colour is also available for most of the interior, being the dashboard, part of the doors and the seats. The rims are a carbon-fibre variation of the \"Lozspeed Mk.V\" sports rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, wrapped in low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\nThe engine model appears to be a single-overhead camshaft V8, evidently by the exhaust manifolds seen when the rear bonnet is removed, and features intercoolers located directly after the side-intakes, suggesting the car is turbocharged. The exact same engine model is found in the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20R\"&gt;Turismo R&lt;/a&gt;. It uses a similar engine sound to the &lt;a href=\"Emerus\"&gt;Emerus&lt;/a&gt;, itself being an edited version of the Cheetah and &lt;a href=\"Vacca\"&gt;Vacca&lt;/a&gt; engine sounds.\nEvents.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Entity%20MT\"&gt;Entity MT&lt;/a&gt; has been featured in the following events:\nChange History.\nReleased in ."}

The tail lamp shape is similar to that of the , with the inner design being almost identical to the one found on the . The rear bumper as well as the exhausts might have been inspired by the . The front bumper and headlight layout feature some resemblance to those from the ; however, the headlight shape seems to be closer to the .\nDesign.\nThe Entity XF's front end features fairly simple styling. The front bumper is elevated for the regions on either side of the central area, featuring a small splitter at its base and three inset front ducts, the central one spanning two-thirds of the car's width. Like its inspiration, the car features large ducts on the sides of the front bumper. Around the upper area, the headlight units have edges parallel to a number of the car's body lines and feature four clear, circular lamps, with CFRP details around them. The car's bonnet/hood features two levels of impression, the first creating a central area that runs from the base of the windscreen to the bottom of the front bumper. The second level of impression is contoured to the base of the windscreen and the side boundaries of the central region. A small manufacturer emblem is seen on the front of the bonnet/hood.\nThe sides of the XF are very bold in terms of styling. The wheelbase features a CFRP lip at its base. The sides of the car are dominated by the presence of a wedge-shaped impression that allows airflow to the main engine air ducts. Behind the impression, the body features a CF body accent bearing silver lettering displaying the car's name. The body then curves until a flat, horizontal section of the body is reached, upon which aerodynamic wing mirrors are mounted at the front of the doors. The main section of the car's greenhouse is unique; it features a bold C-shaped arrangement for its windscreen, side windows and roof. Behind the C-shaped section's seats are two large bulges that sit in an impressed area of the rear, with grated sections over the engine bay and a carbon-fibre area with a small glass pane on the centre. Said rear glass pane also leaves an open duct, and the rearmost area bears the manufacturer emblem.\nThe rear of the car is mostly dominated by meshed vents placed on various separations and housings for the tail lamps, with CFRP elements on the separations and the housings, with the upper central one partially covered by the license plate. The tail lamps consist of red arrow-shaped lights and amber/while light strips below. The lower side comes standard with two large exhausts, which can be modified into a three exhaust triangular arrangement (one above and two below) on each side, giving six exhausts in total. Smaller vents can be seen between the exhausts.\nThe car's interior is the same \"Super GT\" one from cars like the &lt;a href=\"9F\"&gt;9F&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20GT\"&gt;Rapid GT&lt;/a&gt;, sharing the same details on the dashboard and the dial set. A small manufacturer logo can be seen on the horn cap, as well as a silver \"ENTITY\" badge on the passenger side of the dashboard.\nThe Entity XF comes in a single colour, which also applies to the interior stitching. The car uses a set of \"Blade\" high-end rims that are also available at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\nThe car is able to reach very high speeds, much faster than many other super cars, only having a slightly slower top speed than the &lt;a href=\"Adder\"&gt;Adder&lt;/a&gt;. It is capable of burning excess fuel from its exhaust, similar to cars like the &lt;a href=\"Infernus\"&gt;Infernus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buffalo\"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"F620\"&gt;F620&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt; and other cars like the &lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt; when modified. It has relatively high acceleration for its class. It also has very high traction due to its all wheel drive system and excellent weight distribution.\nThe Entity XF is powered by a V8 engine, which is supported by the website claiming it is a 4.5 liter engine delivering 800hp. The engine is coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a rear-mid engine, all wheel drive (20% front and 80% rear distribution) layout. This car emits a high-revving sound and also happens to be supercharged by default. When accelerating, the supercharger can faintly be heard whining.\nPrior to the update, the website claimed that the car can reach over 200 mph and takes 3.5 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph. However, the in-game speedometer shows that the car reaches a maximum speed of 193 mph and takes 5.6 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph.\nSpecial Variants.\n\"GTA Online\": Import/Export.\n3 heavily modified variants of the Entity XF may appear in &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt; source missions. Each variant has a unique license plate number, colour combination and different set of bodywork modifications."}
{"id": "189457", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=189457", "title": "Entity XXR", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"%C3%96verfl%C3%B6d\"&gt;\u00d6verfl\u00f6d&lt;/a&gt; Entity XXR is a hypercar featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the update.\nInfluence.\nThe Entity XXR is primarily based on the , with influences from the , as seen in the side skirts and mirrors, and the , as seen in the side vents. The engine cover and roof vents are possibly inspired by the ones found on the .\nDesign.\nThe Entity XXR shares a similar profile to the &lt;a href=\"Entity%20XF\"&gt;Entity XF&lt;/a&gt;, but assumes a more aggressive styling. The front bumper is more slanted, featuring a large splitter at its base and three inset front ducts, the central one spanning two-thirds of the car's width. Like the XF equivalent, the car features discreet ducts on the sides of the front bumper. Around the upper area, the headlight units are placed in a more parallel positioning relative to the car, featuring dual inner lamps over a circular section and small turn signals on the upper edges, with plastic details around them. The car's bonnet/hood features two levels of impression, the first creating dual sections that run from the area ahead of the windscreen's base to the central area of the bonnet/hood, almost reaching the front end and aligned with the central intake. The second level of impression is contoured to the side boundaries of the dual sections, reaching to the area next to the headlight units.\nThe sides of the XXR are more aerodynamic in comparison to the XF in terms of styling. The wheelbase features a CFRP skirt at its base, with a protruding lip that slightly juts out of the car. The sides of the car are dominated by the presence of dual impressions that allow airflow to the main engine air ducts and exit from the front brakes. Behind the lower impression, the body features a CF body accent bearing silver lettering displaying the car's name, similar to the XF model. The body then curves until a flat, horizontal section of the body is reached, upon which aerodynamic wing mirrors are mounted on the doors. The main section of the car's greenhouse is more or less identical to the XF's; it features a bold C-shaped arrangement for its windscreen, side windows and roof, being slightly more inclined and narrower. Behind the C-shaped section's seats are two large CF intake bulges that sit in an elevated area of the rear, with a large glass pane between these. A rear spoiler is fitted as standard.\nThe rear of the car is mostly simplistic in comparison to the Entity XF, with CFRP elements on the middle section and diffuser. A trapezium-shaped meshed vent is seen below the carbon-fibre strip, as well as C-shaped tail lights above it, consisting of dual red strips and a small white light. The vehicle comes standard with twin central exhausts, which can be modified to have a single exhaust or triple exhausts. The underside of the car is mostly carbon plated, leaving the axle sections and part of the engine bay exposed.\nThe interior of the car is shared with the &lt;a href=\"X80%20Proto\"&gt;X80 Proto&lt;/a&gt;, using the same details and dial cluster. However, it bears the manufacturer emblem on the horn cap.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork and the interior stitching, while the secondary colour is applied on the rear stock spoiler. A trim colour is also available for the interior, being applied to the dashboard, doors and seats. It uses \"Chromatic Z\" high-end rims that are also available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, able to support a dedicated colour (a feature only seen in naturally-generated examples such as in &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;).\nPerformance.\nMuch like the original Entity, the XXR has a very smooth turning radius and can handle most corners with ease, however the sheer power and acceleration is surprisingly worse than the XF, despite having a good top speed, more advanced design and higher price.\nThe vehicle is powered by a V8 engine positioned in a rear-mid configuration. This powers the rear wheels. The exact same engine model is found in the &lt;a href=\"FMJ\"&gt;FMJ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"T20\"&gt;T20&lt;/a&gt;. Its sound is generally high revving and loud, appearing to be a high-pitched variation of the ones used in most supercars.\nOne of the reasons this vehicle has such impressive straight-line performance is down to its very high maximum velocity, surpassing any other car before it, however the use of a large DownforceModifier value of 175.0 causes it to be significantly reduced - but still superior to most cars. The downforce value gives the vehicle extra downforce, more so than the &lt;a href=\"Tezeract\"&gt;Tezeract&lt;/a&gt; but much less than the &lt;a href=\"Taipan\"&gt;Taipan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Autarch\"&gt;Autarch&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Entity XXR's statistical stock top speed is 117 mph / 188.3 km/h.\nThis gives the vehicle, in stock condition, the second highest speed in the game, beaten only by the &lt;a href=\"Tezeract\"&gt;Tezeract&lt;/a&gt;, but on par with several other super cars, including the &lt;a href=\"X80%20Proto\"&gt;X80 Proto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nero%20Custom\"&gt;Nero Custom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taipan\"&gt;Taipan&lt;/a&gt;. When fully upgraded, the vehicle is surpassed by a fully-upgraded &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20900R\"&gt;Banshee 900R&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pariah\"&gt;Pariah&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Entity XXR has all four advanced flags enabled:"}

The cult is an obvious scam, intended to gain &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; by brainwashing its followers into paying large sums of money, parodying the real life . In Formage's own words, it is \"a fellowship of like-minded adults who tithe money in exchange for salvation and merit badges\".\nThe Epsilon Program apparently existed as early as &lt;a href=\"1984\"&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Tina%20Jane\"&gt;Tina Jane&lt;/a&gt;, a DJ for &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20For%20Lovers\"&gt;VCFL&lt;/a&gt; in \"\" references the program on her radio show, indicating that a friend was trying to get her to join. Their influence seems to have continued as late as &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;, as shown when a man calls into &lt;a href=\"Chatterbox%20FM\"&gt;Chatterbox FM&lt;/a&gt; to say: \"That last guy was so full of crap; Everyone knows women are made from sand!\", only for Lazlow to quickly hang up on him, dismissing the caller as \"another lunatic\".\nReligious beliefs.\nThe main ideals of the Epsilon Program are established on their website. The religions main deity is Kifflom, and members follow his twelve tenets:\nTheir site contains a page about the Tract, which is expected to hold the truth about Epsilon. However, the site states that the tract has not yet been written. There is an address in Grand Canaria to send a cheque to, from which you would supposedly be sent a copy of the Tract. Grand Canaria is located in the , which is well known as a tax haven and offshore location for many dubious companies. Unlike most places outside the USA that are mentioned in the GTA universe, Grand Canaria is a fictional place based on . Alternatively, it could be possible that &lt;a href=\"Rockstar\"&gt;Rockstar&lt;/a&gt; got Grand Canaria confused up with the &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; island of .\nMembers.\nThe cult's founder and leader is Cris Formage. In \"GTA San Andreas\", he can be heard on &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20Talk%20Radio\"&gt;the radio&lt;/a&gt; arguing with &lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Lazlow Jones&lt;/a&gt; and fellow con-artist &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Fontaine\"&gt;Darius Fontaine&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe cult attracts many celebrities, including musicians &lt;a href=\"Jezz%20Torrent%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Jezz Torrent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maccer\"&gt;Maccer&lt;/a&gt;, who both claim the cult helped them with their drug addictions. &lt;a href=\"WCTR\"&gt;WCTR&lt;/a&gt; host &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Dexter\"&gt;Billy Dexter&lt;/a&gt; is also believed to be a member of the cult, as he occasionally says \"Kifflom\" during &lt;a href=\"Entertaining%20America\"&gt;his show&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther followers are listed on the cult website under \"testimonials\":\nThe cult is mentioned in small talk by pedestrians in &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;; a certain kind of pedestrian commonly found around &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Bluffs\"&gt;Verdant Bluffs&lt;/a&gt; (identifiable by his rucksack) and some &lt;a href=\"Barbers\"&gt;Barbers&lt;/a&gt; (excluding &lt;a href=\"Old%20Reece\"&gt;Old Reece&lt;/a&gt;) claim to be followers. Additionally, the barber from &lt;a href=\"Marina\"&gt;Marina&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; will sometimes say \"Epsilon smiles on you, uncle brother\" or \"Let Epsilon tame your follicles\".\nHowever, &lt;a href=\"Katie%20Zhan\"&gt;Katie Zhan&lt;/a&gt;, one of &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Girlfriends%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;girlfriends&lt;/a&gt;, is not impressed with the cult and will occasionally refer to them as \"nutjobs\" during a date."}

Its adherents are known as Epsilonists. They believe that there are several paradigms, although only the 4th, 9th, and 10th are mentioned.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nSeveral references to Epsilon Program, both direct and indirect, exist in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThere are &lt;a href=\"hobos\"&gt;hobos&lt;/a&gt; who believe &lt;a href=\"aliens\"&gt;aliens&lt;/a&gt; are trying to take their sperm, pedestrians who cry \"Oh no! They've killed another truth seeker!\" and &lt;a href=\"soapboxers\"&gt;soapboxers&lt;/a&gt; who rant about the paradise and how all others are slaves and damned. &lt;a href=\"Bluesy%20St.%20John\"&gt;Bluesy St. John&lt;/a&gt; claims she once ended up spending her Thursday nights in a group that prayed to Kifflom. &lt;a href=\"Brandan%20Roberts\"&gt;Brandan Roberts&lt;/a&gt; suggests that he is a member of the cult; for example, he says \"Kifflom\" at the end of his interview on Intelligent Agenda on &lt;a href=\"Public%20Liberty%20Radio\"&gt;Public Liberty Radio&lt;/a&gt;. The cult sponsors &lt;a href=\"Chiropracticovernight.com\"&gt;Chiropracticovernight.com&lt;/a&gt;, and is mentioned by the MyRoomOnline user RavenVamp11 on her profile.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\", there's a website called Morningwoodspa.com. The description of therapist Betty \"Mama Bear\" Wiffleton says that \"Betty ran a cult with her ex-husband, who also happens to be her brother and uncle\" (Uncle-Brother reference). It also says, \"She trained for three days as the certified shaman in the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;state of San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;\", where the Epsilon Program is based.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe Epsilon Program plays a much more prominent role in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\". The &lt;a href=\"Epsilon%20Center\"&gt;program's headquarters&lt;/a&gt; appear on &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Avenue\"&gt;Spanish Avenue&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rockford%20Hills\"&gt;Rockford Hills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, near the &lt;a href=\"Michael%27s%20mansion\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly on in the game, the player can hear a &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; broadcast stating that the Epsilon Program was denied religious status by the United States government and so can now be taxed. Weazel News also states that Cris Formage was seen crying on the steps of the court house upon this movement. This may be the reason why the cult asks for large sums of money from Michael when their missions begin. \nMoreover, Michael can become a member of the Epsilon Program. These missions are initiated by going to the Epsilon website as Michael and answering a short survey. After the survey has been completed, Michael has the opportunity to complete the following tasks:\nOnce all of these missions have been completed, Michael will be contacted by &lt;a href=\"Marnie%20Allen\"&gt;Marnie Allen&lt;/a&gt;, who will tell him that he needs to find all &lt;a href=\"Epsilon%20Tract\"&gt;10 Epsilon Tracts&lt;/a&gt; in order to write the Epsilon Tract of the 9th Paradigm, which according to her, is already written. The 10 Epsilon Tracts must be collected in a specific order and cannot be found without her help. At the end of each text message Michael receives from her, he will see a small riddle, which gives information regarding the location of the next Epsilon Tract.\nAs a reward for finding all of the tracts, Michael will be able to read The Epsilon Tract of the 9th Paradigm, Year 157 by visiting the &lt;a href=\"Epsilonprogram.com\"&gt;Epsilon website&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player can access the website as Trevor and Franklin, but cannot view any of the pages. The site will read, \"Access Denied! Your IP has been logged as that of an Unsaveable!\" &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; will remark things such as, \"only dumb people join cults\" and, \"If I wanted to be in a cult, I would have created one\". The same thing applies to &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt;, who will call the concept of Kifflom \"stupid\", or say it isn't for him and he isn't there yet.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;player's&lt;/a&gt; first death, they will have a vision of the cult's leader, &lt;a href=\"Cris%20Formage%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Cris Formage&lt;/a&gt;, who explains the concept of &lt;a href=\"Passive%20Mode\"&gt;Passive Mode&lt;/a&gt; and revives the player.\nRandomly, after the player drinks a Macbeth Whisky Shot and passes out in a &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs\"&gt;nightclub&lt;/a&gt;, they may wake up in Epsilon Temple wearing a &lt;a href=\"Kifflom%20T-Shirt\"&gt;Kifflom T-Shirt&lt;/a&gt;. Also in the nightclubs, a restroom attendant says 'Kifflom' sometimes when tipped. If this attendant is tipped enough times, the player will unlock the Epsilon Robes as a special outfit.\nLike Trevor and Franklin, the \"GTA Online\" player can access the website, but again the site will read, \"Access Denied! Your IP has been logged as that of an Unsaveable!\", and the pages cannot be viewed.\n&lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; encounter &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Boston\"&gt;Jimmy Boston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marnie%20Allen\"&gt;Marnie Allen&lt;/a&gt; who are acting for the program and looking to enter the legal marijuana business through Lamar's &lt;a href=\"LD%20Organics\"&gt;LD Organics&lt;/a&gt;, re-branding it as \"Boston Bakes\", but the &lt;a href=\"Short%20Trip%20-%20OG%20Kush\"&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt; is interrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt;.\nin &lt;a href=\"2022\"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Fooliganz\"&gt;Fooliganz&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Dax\"&gt;Dax&lt;/a&gt;, order the player to poison the Epsilon Program's \"mind control\" herbal botanicals farm, using a failed batch of &lt;a href=\"Acid\"&gt;LSD&lt;/a&gt; that was literally acid. On arrival, the farm is being operated by seven armed \"Cultstoppers\" Epsilonists with their &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20XS\"&gt;Sentinel XS&lt;/a&gt; parked outside. There are also four security guards present, with their black &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt; parked outside.\nBeliefs.\nThe main ideals of the Epsilon Program are stated on their website. The religion's main deity is Kifflom, and members follow his twelve tenets.\nThese tenets were established in the 3D Universe have been kept in the HD Universe, but new Goals and Pledges have been created. The cult also uses the same &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.epsilonprogram.com/\"&gt;site&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Rockstar\"&gt;Rockstar&lt;/a&gt; has explained why those beliefs remained unchanged: \"The Epsilon Program does not exist in just one time or place.\"\n1. The world is 157 years old - FACT!\n2. Dinosaurs are a lie that people believe because they are weak - FACT!\n3. You are happy, you just don\u2019t know it - FACT!\n4. We all come from the same tree - FACT!\n5. Everyone is related to everyone else, except for people with red hair - FACT!\n6. Sperm does not exist - it is a lie spread by biology teachers - along with everything else you have ever been told - FACT!\n7. Men are supposed to lie with nine new partners a week. Women are supposed to lie with six, except for in July, when they must lie with five men a day - FACT!\n8. Aliens exist and are present on earth. If you have a birth mark, you may be descended from Kraff, the famous Emperor of the 4th Paradigm - FACT!\n9. Trees talk, but only some people hear them - FACT!\n10. People who believe in something live much longer than atheists, and they have eternal life thrown in for good measure - FACT!\n11. If you believe this and turn your hands and wallet over to EPSILONISM, you\u2019ll live a happy life. Otherwise you are doomed - FACT!\n12. KIFFLOM - HAPPINESS IS YOURS! KIFFLOM!\nI. We are making an assault on happiness.\nII. We will be generous, in ways that are upwards and ways that are manifest.\nIII. We will live by the proven scientific truth of the metaphors.\nIV. We will fight superstition, limited thinking and dogma wherever we find it.\nV. We will be clear thinking, independent minded and do exactly what we are told.\nVI. We will practice science by not doubting.\nVII. We will display infinite power by closing out those with doubt with our life choices.\nVIII. We will practice kindness and mercy by a relentless assault on insavables, always reminding them of what awaits.\nIX. We will be everywhere, all at once, but also right here, right now.\nX. We will invest in a structured study program, because we know that knowledge is not free.\nXI. We will be open minded to new experiences apart from those that are wrong, insavable, or against teachings.\nXII. We will promote epsilonism in everything we do, while we await both the writing of the &lt;a href=\"Epsilon%20Tract\"&gt;tract&lt;/a&gt; and the ending of the 9th paradigm.\nAll good things come from Kraff, that is the fact on which Epsilonism is built.\nEpsilonism is a science as well as a Religion - in fact, we are the only religion that is also a science and which is concerned with seeking the truth.\nAs real truth seekers, we are willing to pay to make the search go better. In this way we are investing in our future.\nThe Pledge will continue to be revealed in due time. KIFFLOM.\nUnsaveables.\nIn the Epsilonism, \"Unsaveables\" refer to people who are strictly prohibited to be linked to the Epsilon Program.\nThe Epsilon Tract of the 9th Paradigm makes clear that Unsaveables cannot be related to Kraff nor the Epsilonism in any form \u2013 \"Unsaveables\" include antithesis, people of Science, and mainly people with red hair (ginger people) or anything distinctively red in their appearance. \nInfluence.\nVarious elements of the program are a combination of two real-life religions, and a fictitious one:\nPromotional Material.\nStarting 2012, people could buy &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.rockstarwarehouse.com/store/tk2rstar/en_US/pd/productID.306572100\"&gt;Kifflom Tees&lt;/a&gt; from the Rockstar Warehouse, which hinted at the cult's appearance in \"GTA V\".\nOn April 23, 2013, a screensaver which included all Epsilonism's beliefs appeared on Rockstar Newswire.\nCasting.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nInformation=\nStarting on 29th April, and ending on 27th May 2013, anyone could apply to be cast as one of the five Epsilon characters in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;.\" \nTerms=\nYOU MUST ACCEPT THESE TERMS IN ORDER FOR YOUR APPLICATION TO BE SUBMITTED\nRockstar Games is holding a \u201ccasting call\u201d event giving Grand Theft Auto fans an opportunity to be cast as one of five Epsilon Program members in Grand Theft Auto V.

{"id": "141934", "revid": "53469177", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=141934", "title": "Epsilon Tract/The Complete Tract", "text": "The Epsilon Tract of the 9th Paradigm. Year 157\nChapter 1 Verse 1: Omega.\nFrom Omega to Alpha and back again, and from Z to A. We as a people have consistently got things backwards. I know that now. I am not alive. I am dead. I am not rich, I am poor. I am not from Earth at all.\nContrary to what you know, life is not life at all. It is all an illusion. You are being controlled by lots of powerful forces you do not understand - like gravity. Just as an apple sometimes flies up from a tree and becomes a great Eagle, so what seems like greed can in its own way be the most selfless act of all.\nThe act of loving only one, the god head, is the act of loving all, the people as god head. That is clear to those who seek, and seek we must and pay we must. Seeking without paying is not living, it is living on the cheap.\nEpsilonism is an expensive religion. Only for those with the wisdom to afford it. Wisdom is our most valuable commodity and that is why we pay highly for it.\nChapter 1 Verse 2.\nTo be an Epsilonist is to be rich in powerful tools. Tools are held in the belt by some and in the mind of others. The most powerful tool of all is the tool of manifest generosity towards ideas, and towards the upward. That is, sometimes a peach tree issues forth fire and a great dove becomes born.\nThat dove is money and the money should be spent by all to achieve manifest generosity, as each paradigm has shown those who understood. And manifest generosity is the god head and being the god head is the movement towards truth form. Truth form is important but it is difficult for the wrong to understand, so ask yourself, am I the right?\nAnd I prove that through my adherence to manifest generosity and by the Eagle and the dove and the peach tree and upward gravity and by understanding, above all, this manifest truth form? Yea, to some this will seem hard to understand but it will be revealed, and to some it will seem hard to understand and it will not be revealed because they did not seek truly because they were the wrong form of bird or topiary. If you seek wisdom, you will pay for it and seeking and paying are the same thing as is understanding, if you want it to be.\nChapter 1 Verse 3.\nUpwards flows the truth form, and so upward flows manifest generosity, and this is how we become rich. That is, to be generous to those who know the truth form, who truly understand it, and to be upward in our manifest generosity, yes, or yea as &lt;a href=\"Kraff\"&gt;Kraff&lt;/a&gt; sometimes says meaning much the same, those or those who are truly blessed, who are the right and are known as not just of Kraff, but by Kraff and true to that which Kraff understood. So let yourself know those upwards of you, and be known by them. There is Kifflom and there is Krant, and both be praised through manifest generosity.\nChapter 2 Verse 1: Psi.\nIf you undestand this, you know all things, and if you know all things you are of Kraff, just as Kraff took the form of an Eagle or a peach tree, as the literature has shown and as the tract now makes manifest, likens its generosity, which should be upwards and manifest and like it in truth form, which should be understood.\nIf you're confused you are wrong, as Kraff made clear, confusion was not merely confusion, but a proof of all that is wrong and if you believe, then nothing is greater than believing completely and believing completly makes you into the peach tree that flows upwards or the apple tree that becomes a dove or the other way around.\nChapter 2 Verse 2.\nNothing shows truth form more than upwards generosity and nothing shows wrongness more than doubt. No one is weaker than the questioner. Not one person. Not even a really weak person, without any strength at all. Or a lettuce. Yes, I want to be clear, as clear as the lake in which truth lives, which is another metaphor I will come back to, as Kraff came back for us across Paradigms in this 9th Paradigm, year 157. Hear them speak, oh lovers of arboreal wisdom! Hold on to the peach tree and the apple tree and give all that you have in faith and watch fruits flow upward to a bountiful harvest. He who hungers while others are rich shall someday be rich himself.\nChapter 2 Verse 3.\nThe lake in which truth lives is very clean and clear, but not as clean or clear as it clean and clear that those who have been shown our truth form and have questioned, and have doubted and have not understood are themselves, not in fact the weak, but the Unsaveables. By even thinking a question, you are likening yourself to the volcano that sucks lava into itself and explodes down, causing the entire Paradigm to implode and a mighty race of super beings to be cast adrift into space, as happened once and must never happen again.\nChapter 2 Verse 4.\nCast off the cane. Not only does questioning kill you, it also kills everyone you love. It means you do not love them and you wish them to die. That is clear now. To doubt is to wish death on everyone, and that is all the proof you need that the world, the apple tree, the peach tree, the dove and the Eagle are good things, and of Kraff, but there are also many bad things. And those bad things are doubt. And also upwards generosity, is the most bounteous thing of all. And bounteousness is a mirror. A mirror in a lake where truth lives. Drink from this lake and also water the peach tree but do not quench the fire that brings the dove, and do not pick the apple that may one day become an Eagle, a great Eagle who feeds from the lake.\nChapter 3 Verse 1: Chi.\nGive and you shall receive. As someone else said, but whomever said that was themselves a brilliant man and a friend of &lt;a href=\"Cris%20Formage\"&gt;Cris&lt;/a&gt;, as all brilliant men are, and a fantastic Epsilonist like all the greater thinkers and philosophers and celebrities. The literature has been clear on that, and now the tract makes clear. Indeed, there is a lake where truth lives and in this lake an egg lived and out of that egg came forth a whole world. And that world was this world and this metaphor now ends, and a new one begins. The new metaphor is the tract and the tract is truth and truth form and a few ideas laid down and many left out.\nChapter 3 Verse 2.\nNo seed is wasted, for seeds of man or tree are a lie. The apple tree and the peach tree lie together in the same orchard, yet there are many trees, just as a man of Epsilon must lie with nine new partners a week lest he wither at the vine.\nChapter 3 Verse 3.\nLand left unplowed goes fallow, for in all things there is an agrarian analogy, for the world was created before television. If a woman does not lie with five upward men of Epsilon a day on the seventh month, the harvest will surely be meager.\nChapter 3 Verse 4.\nTo understand completely is to be complete. That is the central maxim of our knowledge. And knowledge requires no faith. We are not a religion. We are a science and a way of understanding everything. And to know everything is to know that money is your greatest transience and all money should not tie you in a place but free you to give upwards and to not doubt that doing so is the most complete thing you can do and that those who doubt you are death dealers and haters of the Eagle and the dove and the peach tree and the lake of truth and they wish you dead. Cast them from your lives, and cast a line into the lake, for it will feed you.\nChapter 3 Verse 5.\nEverything was will be and has a cycle, just as a fool who saves his fruit sees it rot, a wise man sends his fruit towards the upwards. You have it in you to be happy, but you are not happy because you are surrounded by people who want you dead because they doubt and in doubting they prove they are Unsaveable, so if you cannot kill them, let them go, and move towards the blue light and the lake and the apple and the other metaphors and away from the empty place in which objection and death unite as one.\nChapter 3 Verse 6.\nDoubters shall be spaded under and given a chance to serve as a garden for descendants of Kraff. I shall not weep. For tears of salt poison the garden and this is our time of joy.\nChapter 3 Verse 7.\nNegativity is a double and a single. It is always negative. The point of life is smiling. And nothing makes you smile more than knowing the truth form and the truth form is 157 years old and the great battle between Kraff and the Unsaveables that exists in this paradigm, the 9th paradigm and all preceding paradigms back to the 4th paradigm. This is a battle we must win, just like the end of a movie, including those made by and starring many top celebrities who are themselves Epsilonists, just like most top philosophers and thinkers are. This is a battle we can win.\nChapter 4 Verse 1: Upsilon.\nUpward generosity and acknowledgment of the truth form are to us as truth is to the lake and gravity is to the apple tree and fire is to water and doubt is to the Unsaveable. Previous ideas have been spoken by all of the great men of carbon who were often secret Epsilonists, although unrevealed until this moment. None are dead. They sit with Cris in physical or cerebral form and the space travel is complete, both across paradigms and withim your Earth time, year 157. This is the tract. It was always written. It was never written.\nChapter 4 Verse 2.\nWe are all from the same tree. Yet no one shall believe that a winged lizard could fly or a man with hair the color of a rose does not bring doom with lies. This is a true as the evil of doubt.\nChapter 4 Verse 3.\nJust as a man and a woman make water differently, they shall not do it in the marital bed or on one another unless they that are upwards within the hierarchy demands it, and even then not often. Hierarchy is all and upwards generosity is all. Look upwards and see the stars. This is a kingdom, the kingdom of Kraff, ruled by Cris, and there are servants and disciples, and the Unsaveables who become fertilizer. That is a new metaphor that will carry into the next Paradigm, wherever it shall lie, even onto bumper stickers. For that which has higher meaning must be told in all manner possible, by oracles, by brother to brother, and condensed into phrases that others need understand while trapped in traffic and seeking escape.\nChapter 4 Verse 4.\nThose who doubt do not get to lie with new partners, instead they will ne cooked in the death they bring upon themselves. Indeed the worst they imagine through doubt is what they will get. Like being raped by a bull-form or a being the last station in a nasty prison train, or watching everyone they know have a joyful orgy and they are not invited nor have you been invited.\nThat is what doubters get. Nothing but bad things, including being raped by animals and not going to orgies. There should be no need to repeat that a third time. The peach tree talks and the apple tree talks, you hear them and you know. You do not hear them and you know you are a doubter and an Unsaveable.\nChapter 4 Verse 5.\nYour earth partner is to be cherished and therefore shared with the utmost generosity upwards like all things. And what is upward generosity? That we shall come to, once we have once more focused upon the work of the Unsaveables, and that work is questioning and doubting. It is not the scientific way to doubt. Let that be made clear. It is the way of the thorn bush or cactus. They are not trees. They do not speak. Not even a little bit.\nChapter 4 Verse 6.\nThe cactus only grows from sand. Sand makes an earth partner, for from sand comes glass that forms the pitcher of truth from the lake that holds a cutting from the peach tree. And once the earth partner becomes like the cactus they must be cast out and a newer younger earth partner shall take their place.\nChapter 5 Verse 1: Tau.\nOnly the apple tree and the peach tree speak. These are the trees we came from and they are the same tree. Peaches are in fact apples and they are the tree that was in the lake that was in the egg that was near the Eagle that I mentioned up above.\nChapter 5 Verse 2.\nThe mark of Kraff adorns many who are blessed. Some descendants of Kraff have a mark of birth that adorns the elbow, or buttocks, but he who has the stain of wine on his head or face - they drink with Kraff in the 4th Paradigm.\nChapter 5 Verse 3.\nDo not forget about the dove. The dove is the dove of love and of truth that is an old metaphor and one that unites all knowledge under Epsilonism, and like all who pursue truth and love he does so not just by manifesting upward generosity but also by killing Unsaveables in the great fight between Kraff and his enemies that has gone on for paradigms. In the 4th paradigm it was energy. In the fifth paradigm it was fire. In the 6th paradigm it was the love of ignorance and the Eagle.\nIn the 7th it was the great dispute in which Unsaveables learnt to take the form of conflicted reason. In the 8th, it was amnesia. In the 9th it is within the being form - that is the red, and he with red and of red in the hair form is not of Kraff and he is the embodiment of that which is Unsaveable. All of these paradigms will be revealed to you through upwards generosity. Their meaning shall be made clear as your role in the great battles will be made clear. Nothing is truer to the dove of love than killing Unsaveables.\nChapter 5 Verse 4.\nAnd what is this thing of which you speak? What is this upwards generosity? It is the most precious thing, the giving to those who do not need, so cannot be challenged for greed, who have so much they do not need any more and therefore can receive your gift kindly and with the truth form and with understanding that is everything.\nIt is the gift towards Cris, to Cris, or to any senior Epsilonists who are his form in your life as all senior Epsilonists are the same spirit and mind form in this aradigm, as the Eagle is the peach tree and the other metaphors also become blurred. It is by asking Cris to receive that we ourselves get the most. That is the clearest thing.\nChapter 5 Verse 5.\nAnd if not Cris then the program itself for the program knows truth and by paying for truth we guarantee its veracity. Just like the top celebrities and great thinkers who are open Epsilonists and many others whom you do not know are Epsilonists but happily triple tithe their upward generosity as they owe everything to the Program and acknowledge this. Triple tithing makes a truth form more true.\nChapter 5 Verse 6.\nNothing is more than giving all that you have including that which you do not yet have, like loans or mortgages or indeed that which has been taken by Unsaveables and must be taken from them. The world of this paradigm belongs to us, and so return it to us. By giving it to Cris, he will save it for all of us. By knowing us, he knows all. By saving us, he saves all who can be saved. Here ends the first part of the tract of the 9th paradigm. Kifflom."}

He was additionally caught with child pornography, although charges were later dropped, and was the central figure in a &lt;a href=\"2006\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt; doping scandal involving the Liberty Swingers.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nAsaltacunas is mentioned on &lt;a href=\"Our-own-reality.com\"&gt;Our-own-reality.com&lt;/a&gt; in the opening story about Jill Von Crastenburg's sex tape, and later, after \"&lt;a href=\"Actions%20Speak%20Louder%20than%20Words\"&gt;Actions Speak Louder than Words&lt;/a&gt;\", a story about him going out for dinner with his mother appears on the site.\nCharacter.\nInfluence.\nAsaltacunas is likely a parody of former baseball player , who was also accused of steroid use and was a high-profile, well-paid player, befitting Asaltacunas' status. Asaltacunas might also partially parody twin brothers and , both Cuban baseball players who were once implicated in steroid use."}

Ernesto dislikes Luis, believing that he is \"drug dealing trash\". This can be seen at one point when Ernesto sends Luis an &lt;a href=\"Mail.eyefind.info\"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; insulting him and saying that he should come back to &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; to deal with him. If Luis replies negatively to the email, he will respond saying that he'd love for Ernesto to come back and deal with him, and then asks why he doesn't try to send money to their mother.\nErnesto moved out of the city and started a family, and a job as an accountant. His siblings dislike him, believing he is a \"prick\" and an \"asshole\", as he apparently never sends &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; to his mother and only calls her twice a year. Luis makes fun of his wife as well. During &lt;a href=\"Drug%20Wars\"&gt;Drug Wars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Henrique%20Bardas\"&gt;Henrique Bardas&lt;/a&gt; will sometimes question Luis on Ernesto's whereabouts, to which Luis answers that he doesn't know where Ernesto is and \"doesn't give a fuck\".\nThere are numerous pictures of Ernesto in his mother's house that are rather hard to view as they are only featured in cutscenes. If the player should look at this pictures in his mother's house, it can be seen that they feature different characters. One wears a beige suit, a fedora, and has extremely dark skin, implying he is African-American, which is obviously untrue. Another picture shows another version of Ernesto wearing a blue jacket, sporting corn rows, and having rather light, tanned skin. The same goes for his sister, Leta."}

When &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; enters, &lt;a href=\"Mallorie%20Bardas\"&gt;Mallorie Bardas&lt;/a&gt; scurries over to kiss him and introduces him to Manny. Manny tries to persuade Niko on camera to help him \"clean the streets\", a euphemism he uses often for eliminating local drug dealers. Niko, shying away from the camera during Manny's monologue, grows exasperated by it and orders Jay to turn the camera off. Then, he seizes the camera by force and sends it crashing to the ground. Manny sends the dancers home and scolds Niko. Then, he entreats Niko to help him in his endeavour to \"clean the streets\" in exchange for money. Niko acccedes to his proposition.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nWalkthrough.\nAfter the cutscene, the player must get in a vehicle with Manny and drive to the dealer's place on &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Boulevard\"&gt;Grand Boulevard&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arriving, a cutscene will play showing a &lt;a href=\"Hustler%20Drug%20Dealer\"&gt;dealer&lt;/a&gt; getting into a &lt;a href=\"Stallion\"&gt;Stallion&lt;/a&gt; and driving off. After the cutscene, the player must tail the dealer to the meetup at the &lt;a href=\"Chase%20Point%20Warehouse\"&gt;Chase Point Warehouse&lt;/a&gt;. The player must be careful to not get too close to the dealer's car, or he will be alarmed. Manny will warn Niko (if not insult him) if the player gets too close. After he warns Niko a certain amount of times, the player will spook the dealer, and he will abort his trip to the meetup, therefore failing the mission. If the player blows the horn while following the dealer, Manny will say something like \"Not cool, man!\", and if the player continues to blow the horn they will spook the dealer, causing the mission to fail.\nThe drive will end at the &lt;a href=\"Chase%20Point%20Warehouse\"&gt;Sprunk warehouse&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chase%20Point\"&gt;Chase Point&lt;/a&gt;, Bohan. The player must park behind the dealer's car once they get there. After a short cutscene, Manny tells Niko to follow the dealers into the warehouse and eliminate them, and then drives away to pick up his cameraman. The player will soon realize that the front door is locked. At this point, they have several options for getting into the warehouse:\nOnce inside, the player must eliminate all the gangsters. When the player leaves the warehouse, Manny and his cameraman will meet him outside. However, if the cops have been alerted, the player will need to lose their wanted level first."}

{"id": "389166", "revid": "38527717", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=389166", "title": "Esperanto (3D Universe)", "text": "The Esperanto is a vehicle appearing in the .\nDesign.\nThe Esperanto made its first appearance in . Its design became more boxy in and , and appeared alongside a similar classic coupe, the &lt;a href=\"Remington\"&gt;Remington&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the Remington being a lowrider, the Esperanto was not. The rounded design returned for . However, it returned to the boxy design in .\nThe Esperanto is based on a , more specifically the 1975 and 1976 models judging by the taillights. However, the vehicle has received significant changes throughout its appearances in these games.\nWhen introduced in \"GTA III\" (and, later, in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\"), the Esperanto features a slightly curvy profile and flatter details. The \"GTA Vice City\" rendition (as well as the \"GTA Vice City Stories\" rendition) received a major retouch with the vehicle featuring a more angular body design, detailed fascia and rear fin that slant forward. The \"GTA San Andreas\" Esperanto is essentially similar in design as that of \"GTA Vice City\", but noticeably sports differences in the rear, with its tailfin-based taillights reduced in height (implying they are now part of the rear bumper) and its rear license plate relocated from the trunk lid to the bumper. Similarly, the \"GTA Advance\" rendition maintains much of the physical traits of previous Esperanto's as seen from the top down.\nOne of the earliest known names of the car is the \"Esparanto\", revealed during &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;development of \"GTA III\"&lt;/a&gt; and depicted in the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20Autos\"&gt;Capital Autos&lt;/a&gt; website. Very early models of the possible Esparanto was more detailed, it had a brown vinyl roof and there were bigger resemblance to a real Cadillac from the seventies. The beta Esperanto was also intended to feature hydraulics, but the feature was dropped in the final release. This feature was passed to the &lt;a href=\"Yardie%20Lobo\"&gt;Yardie Lobo&lt;/a&gt;, however.\nPerformance.\nAlthough performance aspects vary slightly between games for this vehicle, acceleration and speed are generally quite satisfying with the rear-drive V8 or I6 (depending on the game) powertrain. The one common problem with the Esperanto, however, is its notoriously bad brakes - a problem that is only exacerbated by the weight of the vehicle. When traveling at high speed, it takes some time to bring the vehicle to a stop which, besides often causing minor accidents, becomes a potentially fatal problem in \"GTA III\", where &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; is unable to jump from a moving vehicle, exposing him to serious danger in a fast-moving Esperanto about to explode. The handling of the car is highly responsive, but again, the size and weight of the vehicle cause problems, predisposing it to two-wheeling and loss of control when overcompensating for a swerve at high speeds. However, its huge mass absorbs damage quite well, making it a good vehicle for ramming smaller ones (and even comparably sized ones) off the road. Usually using the handbrake with this car is more effective than using the main braking system.\nThe \"GTA San Andreas\" rendition has the same engine sound as the &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Compact\"&gt;Blista Compact&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Club\"&gt;Club&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feltzer\"&gt;Feltzer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flash\"&gt;Flash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jester\"&gt;Jester&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Majestic\"&gt;Majestic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tahoma\"&gt;Tahoma&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpecial Variants.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto III\", there is a unique navy blue variant found in the &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Town\"&gt;Ghost Town&lt;/a&gt;. It appears to have bigger wheels and darker windows compared to the normal Esperanto, although it lacks an interior. However, it is simply a mere prop and it cannot be driven by the player."}

Rather than being a large two-door coupe, the new car is a mid-sized four-door sedan. Its styling inspiration appears to be a pastiche of common early-80s mid-size American car styling. The bumpers, sides (especially the wheel arches, side cladding, the slight kink behind the rear window, and the shape of the rear window) and bustle-back styling are based on the . The front fascia is based on the , while the tail lights are extremely similar to those on a . The interior, which is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, is also derived from the Bonneville.\nPerformance.\nThe Esperanto is powered by a relatively lazy-feeling V6 engine, which is paired with a 5 speed gearbox in a RWD configuration. Overall, it is rather slow and dreary, in that acceleration is very poor and top speed is not very high. Handling is fairly acceptable, though some understeer can be felt. The suspension can be described as moderately firm, yet soft enough to cope with the rough streets of Liberty City. Braking has improved significantly over the 3D Universe Esperanto, though ABS is still not available. When crashed, this car appears to cope rather well. However, it is easy for the engine to become damaged."}

The general atmosphere is one of capitalistic fervor and a sort of disdain for the area by the city's locals. Similar to Fisherman's Wharf, the occasional food retailer can be spotted in this area, as well as a mothballed submarine.\nEsplanade North is also a stronghold for the &lt;a href=\"Da%20Nang%20Boys\"&gt;Da Nang Boys&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\n&lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson's&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0arrival in San Fierro is met with an enormous amount of work for him to do in this new city. In addition to renovating the derelict garage he won in a &lt;a href=\"Farewell%2C%20My%20Love...\"&gt;street race&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt;, Carl begins to establish himself as an entrepreneur in San Fierro by acquiring numerous properties and businesses throughout the city, including &lt;a href=\"Wang%20Cars%20%28GTA%20San%20Andreas%29\"&gt;Wang Cars&lt;/a&gt;, a dealership in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20San%20Fierro\"&gt;Downtown&lt;/a&gt; that he uses as a front for the new chop-shop in &lt;a href=\"Doherty\"&gt;Doherty&lt;/a&gt;. But this is only the beginning of Carl's work in San Fierro. He has just been informed that the entity responsible for the events leading up to this point, the &lt;a href=\"Loco%20Syndicate\"&gt;Loco Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;, is largely based in this new city, with its leaders close by. In order to infiltrate the syndicate, Carl begins working for the syndicate's main San Fierro muscle, the &lt;a href=\"pimp\"&gt;pimp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jizzy%20B.\"&gt;Jizzy B.&lt;/a&gt;, who resides in the &lt;a href=\"Jizzy%27s%20Pleasure%20Domes\"&gt;Pleasure Domes&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"Gant%20Bridge\"&gt;Gant Bridge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Battery%20Point\"&gt;Battery Point&lt;/a&gt;. After working for Jizzy and gaining his trust, Carl meets another head of the Loco Syndicate, &lt;a href=\"T-Bone%20Mendez\"&gt;T-Bone Mendez&lt;/a&gt;. After the three men &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno%20%28mission%29\"&gt;locate and rescue&lt;/a&gt; a kidnapped &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno\"&gt;Mike Toreno&lt;/a&gt;, the one pulling all the strings, the pieces begin falling into place.\nCarl begins his take-down of the Loco Syndicate by paying Jizzy an unexpected visit at the Pleasure Domes, after which he is forced to chase Jizzy when he runs out the front door and drives away in panic. After &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Cold%20Killa\"&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; Jizzy, Cesar informs Carl of a meeting taking place at Pier 69 in Esplanade North. Carl heads out there to find T-Bone Mendez and Carl's old associate from &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Grove Street&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt;, about to meet with Toreno. After blowing his cover, Carl is then forced to &lt;a href=\"Pier%2069%20%28mission%29\"&gt;chase down&lt;/a&gt; Mendez and Ryder on the pier's pedestrian mall. After shooting Mendez off the side of the guard rail, and into &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Bay\"&gt;San Fierro Bay&lt;/a&gt;, Carl then has to swim through part of the bay to a boat in order to chase down Ryder, who had jumped into the bay in an attempt to escape. After killing Ryder, Carl &lt;a href=\"Toreno%27s%20Last%20Flight\"&gt;locates and shoots down&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;chopper&lt;/a&gt; that was presumably carrying Toreno to the meeting, ending the Loco Syndicate."}

It has a small front mudguard on the fork legs, a circular headlamp with two turn signals beside it and a small rounded fairing above the headlamp. The handlebars are connected to the upper triple clamp by two supports and has two rear-view mirrors near the grips, as well as two pods using the \"Sports Bike\" dials from motorcycles such as the &lt;a href=\"Akuma\"&gt;Akuma&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bati%20800\"&gt;Bati 801&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe main body uses protective frames over the engine bay area, a large fuel tank and a long seat over the whole rear fender. The engine bay is mostly exposed and features a rounded air filter and two exhaust tubes, which merge into a single tube on the right side.\nThe rear section features a single red light on the end of the rear fender and a small black frame, which holds the license plate, the turn signals and a rectangular lamp below.

The brakes are also very poor, taking a long time to bring to a stop. Finally, the car's handling is mediocre. It is a heavy car with very soft suspension, leading it to sway a lot during hard driving, and it leans significantly to the side while cornering. It also has a tendency to swing its tail out into oversteer when cornering hard, so drivers need to be careful as to not turn too hard and lose the rear. Overall, it drives quite similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt;, but feels significantly heavier and more sluggish.\nThe vehicle is powered by a single-cam V8 with a cylindrical air filter, delivering power to the rear wheels through a 3-speed gearbox.

Euphoria covers nearly all in-game animated behaviors, including firearm usage, hand-to-hand combat, jumps and climbs, recoveries and interactions with in-world objects.\nIn addition to enhanced animation cycles, Euphoria is also designed to perform more life-like animations and an underlying sense of self-preservation giving each character unprecedented interactivity and realism.\nFor example, pedestrians who are knocked off-balance by a player will stumble around dynamically and grab onto objects (or other people) in the game world for support themselves. Characters who are falling, heavily injured, ejected from a car, etc. will also enter an \"intelligent ragdoll\" state -- rather than simply going limp -- which will cause them to protect their heads while rolling, reach out to break a fall with their hands, grab injured body parts and otherwise practice realistic self-preservation in a way that would be almost impossible to replicate with canned animation.\nEuphoria is optimized to run on &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; and PC\u00a0and is powering on most Rockstar games such as\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", ' and '."}

The front central intake, as well the shape of the front side intakes, takes inspiration from the . The main red tail lights are taken from the , albeit rectangular in shape.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Euros is a sleek and contemporary &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese sports car, appearing as one of the most modern vehicles at the time of the game's &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt; setting, featuring a wide intake and small fog lights with turn signals on the front, along with dual square lights above. The fuel cap can be seen on the rear left fender just near the door, while the cabin area features a panoramic sunroof (the only car with this feature). The rear of the car has a small lip spoiler, wide tail lights on either side, a central license plate on the bumper and dual exhaust pipes below. The vehicle spawns in a variety of single colors.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle bears many similarities with the &lt;a href=\"ZR380\"&gt;ZR380&lt;/a&gt; as they all share the same inspiration sources. The front of the car features a carbon-fiber splitter at the bottom and a large mesh intake on the center, along with smaller intakes with LED-like lights beside it and a black detail above the central one. On the upper area, the car has vertical housings with dual circular headlights and inner amber indicators, while the center bears the Annis emblem. The hood has two protruding lines that curve as they approach to the windshield, and opens to reveal the engine bay and a strut brace.\nOn the sides, the car has flat profiling on the wheel arches and small side skirts, as well as thin body lines passing through the doors and vertical handles with a discreet circular shape. The greenhouse area has black trim around the windows, black inner separations and large mirror wings with black supports near the A-pillars and silver horizontal details over them, along with triangle-shaped rear-quarter windows and a slanted hatch with a large rear window.\nThe rear of the car is very slanted, featuring the corresponding badges on the hatch/trunk lid and a dedicated section below, intended for the license plate. The sections beside the plate are occupied by large red tail lights with dual inner reverse/turning lights, while additional red strips can be seen below. The lower area of the bumper features thin vertical exit vents on the outer edges and a black section on the center with additional vents and moldings for the exhaust pipes.\nThe interior and dial set are shared from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Coquette\"&gt;Coquette&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Kanjo\"&gt;Blista Kanjo&lt;/a&gt;, with the former being a white/paintable variation of the one from the aforementioned cars. The Annis logo can be seen on the horn cap.\nThe primary color of the car is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary color is applied on the headlight casings, the skirts and the brake calipers. A trim color is also available for part of the doorcards and the inner portions of the seats, as well as a dial color. It uses a unique set of five-spoke rims with a triangular pattern on the end, wrapped in medium-profile tires. These rims can also support a dedicated color, although only naturally-generated examples from &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; may have one.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nDespite its suggestive designs, the Euros is one of the slowest sports cars in the game, as its acceleration and speed are far inferior to all other sports cars in the game. Nevertheless, the Euros still has better speed and acceleration than most other cars in the game. Handling and braking are also fairly good.\nThe Euros is a front-engined, all wheel drive car, with a five-speed gearbox and a mass of 1,400 kgs.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe car is slightly on the heavy side, as it has a slow acceleration pace against some vehicles in its class, but a good top speed. Cornering ability is pretty good too, as it does not lose much of its traction upon corner entry and feels smooth and planted when pressing on the accelerator on corner exits, though it still has bouts of oversteer when turning too hard. Brakes are strong considering the weight, as it is able to stop the vehicle rather quickly into a corner despite the weight penalties it suffers. Despite that, the car is easy to control in drifting, being that it is easy to initiate using the handbrake and responsive enough to hold its angles. \nThe Euros also performs pretty well off-road too despite being rear wheel drive, as the weight keeps it planted to the ground when approaching a jump as it keeps it down to the ground instead of rotating or losing control of its own chassis upon mid-air, which makes it slightly better than the other vehicles from the same update like the &lt;a href=\"Jester%20RR\"&gt;Jester RR&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ZR-350\"&gt;ZR350&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Euros is powered by a single-cam V6 engine, coupled to a 7-speed gearbox in a front-engine, rear wheel drive layout. It shares the high-revving sound from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Jester\"&gt;Jester&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"ETR1\"&gt;ETR1&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ZR380\"&gt;ZR380&lt;/a&gt;.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nBeing a conventional sports car, the Euros can only be modified to a limited extent at any &lt;a href=\"TransFender\"&gt;TransFender&lt;/a&gt; garage.\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Euros is considered one of the rarest vehicles in \"\", being seen on rare or special circumstances:"}

After moving to Liberty City he became a male model before meeting and entering a relationship with nightclub owner &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt;. Evan and Tony's relationship is very fraught and they have broken up and reconciled several times. &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Lopez&lt;/a&gt;, Tony's bodyguard and business partner, strongly dislikes Evan, viewing him as a selfish \"parasite\" who is only interested in Tony's money and for getting Tony addicted to drugs.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City\".\nDating Tony.\nEvan is first seen in the mission &lt;a href=\"Bang%20Bang\"&gt;Bang Bang&lt;/a&gt;, dancing and singing to the Hall &amp; Oates song \"\" in Tony's apartment. As Luis walks in looking for Tony, he playfully stands in his way until Luis cuts the record off. Evan taunts Luis as he asks for Tony, instigating a brief argument. Evan brushes Luis' insults off and tells him Tony is passed out in the bedroom.\nAs they leave, Evan asks to come along. Luis responds by headbutting Evan, breaking his nose. Angered at Evan for giving Tony drugs, Luis tells him to leave before they get back. As Luis heads out the door, Evan calls him a \"fucking hetero.\"\nDeath.\nThe next time Evan is seen is in the mission &lt;a href=\"Frosting%20on%20the%20Cake\"&gt;Frosting on the Cake&lt;/a&gt;, attending a coke party in Tony's apartment along with &lt;a href=\"Rocco%20Pelosi\"&gt;Rocco Pelosi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gracie%20Ancelotti\"&gt;Gracie Ancelotti&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sharon%20Morton\"&gt;Sharon Morton&lt;/a&gt;.

Eventually, Johnny destroys the limo, and Evan attempts to escape on foot, only to be gunned down by Klebitz. His last known words, delivered by Bleeter, were \"Cornered by bikerz. Eugh. Eugh. Eugh. 2 young 2 die\".\nSometime after the mission, a &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt; article reports Evan's death. Tony Prince later calls Luis confirming Evan's death, much to Luis's annoyance and riddance, alongside blaming Evan for losing the diamonds.\nCharacter.\nAppearance.\nEvan Moss appears as an athletic white male in his early 20s, with white-dyed hair, white shoes, stone-washed jeans, white shirt with an unidentified logo (absent in \"TLAD\") and a beige bomber jacket."}

As well as this, Double GTA$ and RP is usually awarded on certain game modes. The &lt;a href=\"Import/Export\"&gt;Import/Export&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Executives%20and%20Other%20Criminals\"&gt;Executives and Other Criminals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Further%20Adventures%20in%20Finance%20and%20Felony\"&gt;Further Adventures in Finance and Felony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gunrunning\"&gt;Gunrunning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Smuggler%27s%20Run\"&gt;Smuggler's Run&lt;/a&gt; updates are prime examples of updates that had weekly events released continually after the update. These weekly events release vehicles that were added in the update but not officially available, or not purchasable (mission-restricted, for example). During the release of these vehicles, discounts to existing vehicles and double GTA$ and RP is offered to a new &lt;a href=\"Adversary%20Modes\"&gt;Adversary Mode&lt;/a&gt; released alongside the vehicle. Discounts usually applies for the vehicles and standard modifications (sometimes selected modifications such as aircraft weaponry), as well as selected properties and its features.\nIn addition to discounts, business-type features, such as &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Cargo\"&gt;Vehicle Cargo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Supplies\"&gt;Supplies&lt;/a&gt;, receives bonuses as well, usually offering increased payouts over their standard values. Premium Races and &lt;a href=\"Time%20Trials\"&gt;Time Trials&lt;/a&gt; lists are often updated on weekly events, having a new track for a selected vehicle class to compete or a new time trial to be completed under par time, awarding the player with the corresponding payouts. Occasionally, a new clothing item is awarded to players when they log to the game within the current weekly event.\nAs expected from its name, weekly events generally start from Thursdays and last for one week, though in rare cases, they may last for up to two weeks.\nHoliday/Themed Events.\nAs well as weekly occurrences, events are also prominent in re-releasing exclusive content, mainly themed content such as that added in &lt;a href=\"Halloween%20Surprise\"&gt;Halloween Surprise&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Independence%20Day%20Special\"&gt;Independence Day Special&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Festive%20Surprise\"&gt;Festive Surprise&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valentine%27s%20Day%20Massacre%20Special\"&gt;Valentine's Day Massacre Special&lt;/a&gt;. These re-release all content available only during this holiday event.\nSpecial Events.\nOccasionally, major special events are hosted to celebrate the upcoming release of an update, or a major part of \"GTA Online\", or even real-world history. Examples include the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Bonuses\"&gt;\"GTA Online\" Bonuses&lt;/a&gt; event which commonly slashes prices of many vehicles, properties, clothing and more by up to 89%. &lt;a href=\"Anniversary%20Specials%202017\"&gt;Anniversary Specials 2017&lt;/a&gt; was an event which occurred around the time of &lt;a href=\"Halloween%20Surprise\"&gt;Halloween Specials 2017&lt;/a&gt; and celebrated the &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;4th year&lt;/a&gt; of \"GTA Online\". This saw a plentiful award of GTA$400,000 to all players who logged on during the event.\nDLC Content Release.\nMany vehicles have been released in weekly updates consequent to the initial DLC's release, including the &lt;a href=\"Itali%20GTB\"&gt;Itali GTB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Itali%20GTB%20Custom\"&gt;Itali GTB Custom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Comet%20Retro%20Custom\"&gt;Comet Retro Custom&lt;/a&gt;, weaponized vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Ardent\"&gt;Ardent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vigilante\"&gt;Vigilante&lt;/a&gt;, and classic cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20Classic\"&gt;Turismo Classic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cheetah%20Classic\"&gt;Cheetah Classic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Torero\"&gt;Torero&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20GT%20Classic\"&gt;Rapid GT Classic&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Adversary%20Modes\"&gt;Adversary Modes&lt;/a&gt; became increasingly common around the time Events became a key part of the online experience. Plenty of Adversary Modes were released in these events, such as &lt;a href=\"Dogfight\"&gt;Dogfight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Condemned\"&gt;Condemned&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tiny%20Racers\"&gt;Tiny Racers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stockpile\"&gt;Stockpile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Vendetta\"&gt;Vehicle Vendetta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Entourage\"&gt;Entourage&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvent Vehicles.\nMany vehicles have been released over Event periods following the release of a &lt;a href=\"Updates%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;DLC&lt;/a&gt;. While some events are officially titled, the vast majority are not and because one of the first events introducing a new vehicle, the &lt;a href=\"Pfister%20811%20Week\"&gt;Pfister 811 Week&lt;/a&gt; event was officially titled \"Pfister 811 Week\", all consequent events are simply named after the vehicle that was introduced as part of the event."}

{"id": "237445", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=237445", "title": "Everon", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Karin\"&gt;Karin&lt;/a&gt; Everon is a four-door all-terrain truck featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of update.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nJudging by its appearance, the Everon is an imitation of the , one re-engineered from a by , as seen by its extended fender flares and 37-inch tires as per its description. The Everon's front fascia also takes influence from the ; however, the front bumper seems to be influenced by the . The headlights seem to be a mix of the Isuzu and the , while the taillights may have been inspired by the ones found on the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Everon is depicted with a large and bulky profile similar to the &lt;a href=\"Caracara%204x4\"&gt;Caracara 4x4&lt;/a&gt;, featuring a large bumper with a trapezium intake spanning about two thirds of the truck's width, along with two small sections with silver surrounding and unusable circular fog lamps. On the upper area, the truck has a silver grille with three horizontal elements and the manufacturer emblem on the centre, while the sections beside it have large headlamp housings with dual circular units, horizontal strips above and small turn signals on the outer edges. The bonnet is relatively simple and has small elevations starting from either side of the grille, leading almost towards the lower corners of the windscreen.\nThe sides of the truck are clearly distinguished by the bulky arches and the silver side steps, as well as the silver door handles and the badging on the front doors. The cabin area is rather tall and features black trim around the windows, mirror shells with coloured upper halves and a small aerial on the rear area of the roof.\nThe rear of the truck is occupied by the load bed with silver trim on the upper borders and the corresponding tailgate, which has a central handle and badges on the upper corners. The outer edges of the truck are occupied by vertical tail lamps, each one consisting of upper main/turning lamps, middle brake lamps and lower reverse lamps. The bumper is mostly finished in silver, featuring a black upper surface and a dedicated section on the centre for the number plate. The underside features an exposed black chassis frame with a small hook on the rear end, red suspension springs and two parallel trailing arms connected to the front axle, as well as a single exhaust tube on the passenger side, with the exhaust tip pointing downwards.\nThe primary colour of the truck is applied on the body, while the secondary one seems to be only applied on the secondary-coloured modifications installed by the player. The rims appear to be a smaller and bolted-on variation of the one used in the &lt;a href=\"Rebel\"&gt;Rebel&lt;/a&gt; and its variants, fitted with high-profile tyres. The rims can also support a dedicated colour, although only naturally-generated examples from &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; or appearing in &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20Heist\"&gt;The Diamond Casino Heist&lt;/a&gt; may have a black colour.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Everon sports a powerful engine that gives it relatively good straight-line speed and power to climb gradients. Traction on road is wavy, as expected of a lifted truck. Its high-profile offroad tyres and ground clearance allow it to crawl rocks efficiently.\nHowever, its lifted suspension and thick tyres ultimately lead to a vehicle with a high center of gravity, resulting in unfavourable tipsiness, especially with its engine power on very steep cliffs. One must take caution when engaging such cliffs with the Everon. In addition, its large tyres make an easy target from gunfire and bulletproof tyres are recommended when engaging in a gunfight.\nThe vehicle is powered by a V8 engine based on the model, with the badges claiming to be a 5.4L engine. Said engine is coupled to a 6-speed gearbox and powers all wheels in an equal torque distribution. It uses a loud diesel engine sound similar to the &lt;a href=\"Barrage\"&gt;Barrage&lt;/a&gt;."}

Dr. Friedlander will not call this time, an icon will simply appear over his office. The mission can be completed at any time and will be available until &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Richards\"&gt;Mr. Richards&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nMichael will go very nervous to the session this time and will almost give up and get out, but ends up staying anyway. Dr. Friedlander will ask Michael what's been going on and Michael's response will depend on the last mission that the player did before the session:\nDr. Friedlander then asks if Michael has anything else that he wants to tell him. Michael's response will depend on the player's actions in the game. Sometimes Michael will say that he feels like two different people and that he does not like either of them, and he can also say that he hurts other people without thinking and then feels bad about what he did. Other times he might say that he killed someone on the way to the clinic and that he is a sick hypocrite, and he may also say he is making progress, that no major acting or too much happened, and that he's feeling better overall. Regardless of what Michael will say, Dr. Friedlander will say denial is the cornerstone of relapses, and gives advice that the player can accept or reject.\nFriedlander then asks Michael about his sexual behavior, again Michael's response depends on the player's actions: if the player did not sleep with any &lt;a href=\"Prostitute\"&gt;prostitute&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Call\"&gt;booty call&lt;/a&gt;, Michael will say that he had thoughts but didn't have any problems or he may say that he has been a good boy and didn't have any problems at all. On the other hand, if the player slept with a prostitute or booty call, Michael will say that he got lonely and called a girl. Friedlander will repress Michael if he confesses this.\nThe session continues with Dr. Friedlander saying that Michael might be a fascinating rare combination of a sociopath and a deluded psychopath or just a classic case of a weak pup who was weaned too soon by an angry mother. The doctor then ends the session, telling Michael to think about the person that he wants to be, and become obsessed about it and that in the next session, he would tell Michael how to become that person.\nThe session ends and Michael pays &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;1,000 dollars to Dr. Friedlander. Although it is not technically considered an award as it's usually parked outside even before triggering the mission, there is usually an unlocked &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;high-end vehicle&lt;/a&gt; parked in Friedlander's driveway that can be taken at will (in compensation for the $1,000)."}

They may also become visible on the radar for a brief moment when killing players.\nThe VIP will complete the mission if and when they survive the 10 minute duration of remaining hidden in the allocated area. Leaving the area will warn the VIP to remain in the boundaries, otherwise the mission will fail.\nTypical payouts from the mission are $25,000 if playing alone. Having active associates in the session may influx the reward and will pay all associates the same reward. If the associate enters the area, they will be rewarded an additional $500, regardless of how long they remained in the area. If the associate successfully protects the VIP from at least 1 player, rewards of $2,000 are given to all associates and the VIP themselves. Associates who are in the same crew as the VIP may be rewarded further RP.\nOther players whose objective is to kill the VIP will also be given $500 for entering the area, regardless of their success. Killing the VIP will also reward the player up to $30,000, dependent on time taken and amount of resilience provided.\nExecutive Search Locations.\nThe location of the search area is fixed but is chosen based on the VIP's current location. There are a total of 25 locations around the state of San Andreas and are all the same diameter. The locations are strictly based on land to avoid players going out to sea, although numerous boundaries do cover the coastal range of San Andreas. Locations are based in, but not limited to:"}

In one clip, the car is seen parked up in a yard in &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle's design is largely similar to its \"GTA IV\" design, however changes have been made to the car's rim design, wing mirrors and side trims.\nInfluence.\nThis car seems to be rather unique in design, but as a midsize Imponte sedan, generally represents the (general silhouette and the bottom of the front clip) and the (the greenhouse/roof and shape of the back doors).

The rear end is somewhat anachronistic, with a much squarer design than the front end, seemingly inspired by the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//static.cargurus.com/images/site/2014/08/24/19/54/1994_pontiac_grand_prix_4_dr_se_sedan-pic-1650625126036576756-640x480.jpeg\"&gt;1990-1996 Pontiac Grand Prix sedan&lt;/a&gt; and .

Each one is identifiable by the presence of a spoiler or the type of spoilers used, and their badges on the trunk lid:\nThe DF8-90 is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; system with a female voice, but only if the player leaves the \"selected cars\" (default) option in the audio menu.\nThe vehicle shares its interior with the &lt;a href=\"Feroci\"&gt;Feroci&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Intruder\"&gt;Intruder&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nAcceleration is respectable and is among the best in its class (RWD 4-door sedans). The high-output engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox with a smooth powerband gives the DF8-90 a high top speed. The powerful engines on all models make this car easy to slide/oversteer, and as a result can drift and powerslide very easily while being controllable.\nHandling wise, although it sacrifices ride, it makes up for it by being very good with avoidance manoeuvres and scores above average, not far in top speed to far more expensive vehicles. Accident deformation is good, considering its rather sporty nature, but it is not the best. The cabin holds up well and the same goes for the roof. The DF8-90 can sustain multiple frontal impacts before becoming immobilised or catching fire."}

The sides of the cab have small access steps and large doors with the corresponding rear-view mirrors, along with large windows on each side and the fuel cap on the driver side. As with most trucks in the game, the DFT-30 is only capable of seating two occupants.\nThe rear section is predominated by the flatbed with a tall wall behind the cabin, where the chassis also has large fuel tanks and guard rails. The rear end features large mudguards and a license plate on the driver-side one, while a set of red circular tail lights are seen below the bed.\nThe truck only spawns in a white color, which is applied to the cabin and front bumper.\nPerformance.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Flatbed\"&gt;Flatbed&lt;/a&gt;, the DFT-30's size makes it slow and less maneuverable; the length of the truck also makes for difficult driving on narrow roadways, and the stiff suspension leaves the truck unstable and susceptible to tipping over when traveling on uneven terrain. The ground clearance, however, provides some degree of versatility for traveling over bumpy roads\nThe truck's flatbed is of little use for transporting vehicles (as the load usually slides to the back whenever the truck moves forward, like the &lt;a href=\"Packer\"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt;). However, it is possible to ride on the back of the truck without the player floating backwards or falling off/over, serving as a steady gunning platform.\nThe truck is powered by a diesel engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. It shares the engine sound with the &lt;a href=\"Bus%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Bus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Coach\"&gt;Coach&lt;/a&gt;, being of a high-revving two-stroke diesel."}

They agree, and jump in a golf cart to begin a pursuit, ending up with one of the golfers being beat down with a golf club by the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist until he agrees to resign his own membership and drop any action against Dre, and Dre hiring F. Clinton &amp; Partner to search for his lost cell phone.\nAfter a while, the agency hacker &lt;a href=\"Imani\"&gt;Imani&lt;/a&gt; finds out that &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Guns\"&gt;Johnny Guns&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"WesLos%20Records\"&gt;WesLos Records&lt;/a&gt; is the one resposable for stealing Dre's phone and all the unreleased music leaks that happened. Soon after, Johnny Guns and his men had broken into Dr. Dre's &lt;a href=\"Record%20A%20Studios\"&gt;recording studio&lt;/a&gt; and sieged Dre inside his central studio. The protagonist kills all of the enemies outside the building before entering and doing the same inside. Once the fighting is over, DJ Pooh hides all the dead bodies.\nAfter Dre and the protagonist &lt;a href=\"Don%27t%20Fuck%20With%20Dre\"&gt;deals with Johnny Guns&lt;/a&gt;, DJ Pooh invites the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist (and an associate), Franklin Clinton and &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt; for a tour inside Dr. Dre's recording studios. Lamar attempts to make his own rap with a beat DJ Pooh provides him, while the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist and his associate takes a smoke in the room next door. Before Franklin is about to smoke, Lamar refers to &lt;a href=\"Tanisha%20Jackson\"&gt;Tanisha&lt;/a&gt; getting annoyed if he gets high, implying that they are married. When Franklin and Lamar checks out on their partners however, they become so high that they \"experienced an out-of-body experience\". They leave the recording studio to &lt;a href=\"Short%20Trips\"&gt;attend business&lt;/a&gt; and asks DJ Pooh to look after the protagonists while they are high on Lamar's weed.\nIn Real Life.\nJordan was born in June 29, 1969, in Los Angeles, California. His career dates back to 1986. He is known for being the writer of the 1995 film \"Friday\". He usually collaborates with the rapper &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Cube\"&gt;Ice Cube&lt;/a&gt;.\nDJ Pooh is credited as co-producer and writer of &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt;'s 2004 game, \"\". He is also the one who brought the rapper &lt;a href=\"Young%20Maylay\"&gt;Young Maylay&lt;/a&gt; to voice the lead character, &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;. Pooh returns as the host of the &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20Classics\"&gt;West Coast Classics&lt;/a&gt; radio station in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nDJ Pooh has always been good friends with the voice actor of \"GTA V\" protagonist &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shawn%20Fonteno\"&gt;Shawn Fonteno&lt;/a&gt;, appearing in the films \"The Wash\" and \"3 Strikes\" with him. DJ Pooh called Fonteno one day asking him to audition for a videogame he was working on with &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt;. Fonteno hesitated, but agreed based on how good Pooh's word had been in the past. Fonteno would pass the audition and go on to star as Franklin Clinton in \"GTA V\" and later \"GTA Online\".\nDJ Pooh has since been called Rockstar's \"go to guy when dealing with urban or black characters\" in their games by Shawn Fonteno.\nMission Appearances.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Contract.\nThe Contract: Dr. Dre"}

Several liveries are available to replicate the design of IndyCar teams and specific drivers, including 's #12 livery.\nJust like other , the engine model is reused from the &lt;a href=\"PR4\"&gt;PR4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"R88\"&gt;R88&lt;/a&gt; and is based on the . \nDesign.\nThe DR1 features a narrow, low-profile design, where the front has a distinctive long nose with large dual wings and black/carbon fins, as well as control arms for the front wheels and black narrow ducts for the front brakes. The middle section features rounded intakes beside the nose and curved panels near the rear wheels, while the center features an open driver compartment with two rectangular mirrors beside it and a tall compartment with a loop/roll bar on top and a long fin running towards the rear.\nThe rear end features a single square tail light and a diffuser with four blades, as well as two upwards-facing exhausts near the rear axle and the corresponding control arms and brake ducts. The rear wing is mounted on two support frames and is made up of a large surface at the bottom, along with two riveted fins with their lower halves angled towards the vehicle. The entire underside of the vehicle is carbon plated, separated into narrow panels for the nose/cabin area and a wider panel for the main body and diffuser.\nIts interior uses a unique and modernized steering wheel with a digital display above and numerous buttons around, which is shared with the &lt;a href=\"BR8\"&gt;BR8&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle is prominently painted with the primary colour, with the rearmost horizontal surfaces of the wings painted in a secondary colour. The DR1 uses its own custom \"Race\" wheels with racing slicks similar to vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Drift%20Tampa\"&gt;Drift Tampa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hotring%20Sabre\"&gt;Hotring Sabre&lt;/a&gt;, being a silver variation of the \"Classic Five\" rims fitted with \"Atomic Logo\" tires.\nPerformance.\nVehicle.\nThe DR1 is a surprisingly well rounded vehicle, having fair handling and excellent braking, although lower acceleration than the &lt;a href=\"PR4\"&gt;PR4&lt;/a&gt;. At high speeds, the vehicle will get a slight understeer when attempting tight turns but this is mitigated through simple use of brakes. The downside of using this vehicle, however, is that the driver will be unable to use their weapons at all, risking the player getting attacked and not being able to return fire.\nUnlike other vehicles, the DR1 damage absorption will not result in deformation but instead the body kit falling off, exposing the engine and base frame. This can result in more understeer as the car loses more traction because of the missing parts, especially if the spoiler is gone.\nDue to the immense downforce, the DR1 can also drive on walls, even ones that are slightly curved outwards, and even ceilings if the player angles the car correctly, especially in the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Storm%20Drain%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Storm Drain&lt;/a&gt;, where there are inclines.\nThe DR1 is powered by a V10 engine fitted with what appears to be double-barrel carburetors/throttle bodies. Its sound is a higher-pitched variation of the engine sound from the &lt;a href=\"Turismo%20R\"&gt;Turismo R&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"PR4\"&gt;PR4&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"R88\"&gt;R88&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"BR8\"&gt;BR8&lt;/a&gt;, the DR1 is known to have different downforce values in Freemode. Depending of the front and rear wing setups, one is able to provide either lower downforce to increase speed or higher downforce to provide better cornering abilities. These will carry over in &lt;a href=\"Open%20Wheel%20Races\"&gt;Open Wheel Races&lt;/a&gt;.\nFeatures.\nIn addition to its already impressive speed, the DR1 also has KERS, allowing the driver to increase their speed even further by activating the boost, in a similar manner to the &lt;a href=\"Lectro\"&gt;Lectro&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vindicator\"&gt;Vindicator&lt;/a&gt;. The boost lasts for four seconds and it takes about six seconds to recharge to its full capacity, but it does not have to be full to activate it. In order for the boost to recharge, the vehicle needs to begin slowing down to let it charge. Stopping the vehicle, accelerating, or reversing will prevent the boost from recharging."}

The Da Nang Boys are mentioned as preparing a move to the United States, which could explain the attack on the Blood Feathers.

There the two chat, which again turns into an argument. To distract his father, Jimmy tells Michael that &lt;a href=\"Tracey%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Tracey&lt;/a&gt; also causes trouble; in fact, at the very moment, she is on a &lt;a href=\"Dignity\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt; with famous people, trying to get on TV. Michael takes off his shirt and shoes, jumps off the pier and swims to the boat. Upon getting to the boat, he sees Tracey dancing with various men. Michael confronts his daughter and the men she is with, eventually throwing a stereo into the ocean and tells his daughter to come with him. They steal a &lt;a href=\"Seashark\"&gt;Seashark&lt;/a&gt; and speed off, but the boat's owner, &lt;a href=\"Freddy%20Slade\"&gt;Freddy Slade&lt;/a&gt;, and some of his friends chase after Michael and Tracey and try to shoot them. After losing or killing their pursuers, Tracey and Michael land the Seashark near where Michael left Jimmy. Tracey starts to attack Jimmy, but he defends himself by blaming their father. They both soon leave in a &lt;a href=\"taxi\"&gt;taxi&lt;/a&gt; and Michael stays to smoke."}

{"id": "18532", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=18532", "title": "Daemon", "text": "&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; variant of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Motorcycle%20Company\"&gt;Western Motorcycle Company&lt;/a&gt; Daemon is a motorcycle in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDesign.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nThe Daemon is designed as a cruiser motorcycle based on a customized Harley Davidson FXDB Sturgis.\nThe front section of the bike features an inverted set of chromed forks with black finish on the end of the fork legs and the triple tree clamps. The lower clamp holds a single circular headlight above and two smaller bullet-style turn signals beside it, while the upper tree holds apehanger handlebars with short risers.\nThe main body of the bike features a dual lower frame finished in black, forward foot controls, a fuel tank on the front, a square-shaped battery box and a small black leather seat for the rider. The engine bay features an air filter and a set of two-into-two exhaust pipes on the right side, while a transmission cover is seen on the left.\nThe rear section consist of a curved fender and chromed fender struts on either side, mounting a black pillion pad for the passenger, an oval-shaped red taillight and license plate on the end of the rear fender, and turning lights on either side frame. The rear wheel is connected to the rest of the bike by a swingarm with a grey finish, having dual suspension springs attached to the side struts and the corresponding chain drive, cover and sprocket on the left. Two additional foot pegs are seen above the swingarm, intended for the passenger.\nThe Daemon can be seen in two different variations: The first one features a circular air filter and two silver independent exhaust pipes, while the second one features a teardrop-shaped air filter and black shotgun-style exhaust pipes. The Daemon is commonly seen with a ghost flame decal that is determined by the primary color, with the fuel tank, oil tank and rear fender painted with the secondary color (always set to black). It uses the same wire rims also shared with bikes like the &lt;a href=\"Freeway\"&gt;Freeway&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Wolfsbane\"&gt;Wolfsbane&lt;/a&gt; and is fitted with medium-profile tires, with the rear one being slightly wider.\nThe Daemon was originally meant to appear as the Deamon in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", as it is featured in the game's screen shots and a beta version of its file exists in the &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; version of the original game. The bike assumes a more standard paint scheme with no decal, and features a small front fender, a smaller headlight and more curved handlebars with handbrakes. The fuel tank was smaller and has the corresponding WMC logos, while the oil tank was finished in silver and features \"Daemon\" badges on it. The rear light and license plate are mounted on the end of the rear fender rather than behind the pillion pad. Interestingly, the rear sprocket is missing.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe Daemon returned in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" with the same design as in \"TLAD\", this time featuring fully-chromed fork legs and triple clamps, dark tan handlebar grips, dark tan seats embroidered with the &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;Lost MC&lt;/a&gt; insignia and yellow springs, as well as a teardrop-shaped air filter and silver independent exhaust pipes. The rear fender, brake calipers, tail light and license plate appear to be reused from the \"TLAD\" iteration of the &lt;a href=\"Wayfarer\"&gt;Wayfarer&lt;/a&gt;, as well as several components available as modifications, being the Chrome Mirror, Custom Tank &amp; Speedo, Seat Tassels, Rear Seat and Sissy Bar. The stock exhaust matches the dual exhaust pipes sometimes seen on the Wayfarer; though the Wayfarer's single exhaust is omitted. The vehicle also incorporates a single \"Chopper Bike\" speedometer dial in the enhanced version, also used on bikes like the &lt;a href=\"Bagger\"&gt;Bagger&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Bike\"&gt;Police Bike&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe primary color of the bike is applied on the ghost flame decals of the fuel tank, while the secondary color is applied on the ones from the rear area. It uses a set of black rims similar to the \"Bobber\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and medium-profile tires, with the rear one being slightly wider.\nPerformance.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nThe Daemon is a rather heavy motorcycle with moderately good speed and having a further stopping distance similar to the &lt;a href=\"Angel%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Angel&lt;/a&gt;. However, it has higher acceleration rate, at the cost of high degree of oversteer, so players should he careful when driving at high speeds.\nThe Daemon uses a chain-driven, V-twin internal combustion engine with a 5-speed manual transmission, as evidenced by the foot-actuated gear shifter. The engine sound is very low revving and odd-firing, possibly attributed to being either completely or partially unrestricted.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Daemon has similar statistics to the &lt;a href=\"Hexer\"&gt;Hexer&lt;/a&gt; in terms of acceleration and top speed. However, it has great steering capabilities, able to take corners easily with no sights of oversteer compared to its \"TLAD\" rendition, although it may suffer from slight understeer at higher speeds. Braking is average.\nAgain, the Daemon uses a chain-driven, V-twin internal combustion engine with a 4-speed manual transmission, as evidenced by the foot-actuated gear shifter. It has a low-revving, odd-firing engine sound that is also shared with the &lt;a href=\"Hexer\"&gt;Hexer&lt;/a&gt;.\nInstalling the \"Rear Seat\" modification will increase its traction slightly, in the same way as a spoiler.\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nDuring the course of \"GTA IV\" and \"The Lost and Damned\", it is one of the main motorcycles (along with the &lt;a href=\"Angel%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Angel&lt;/a&gt;) used by &lt;a href=\"The%20Angels%20of%20Death\"&gt;The Angels of Death&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nDuring the course of \"GTA V\", it has become one of the primary bikes used by the Los Santos chapter of &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost MC&lt;/a&gt;."}

The ends of the fork legs and the triple clamps are finished in the same color as the rest of the front forks, the fuel tank having no side caps, the seats being black leather with no insignias and the exhaust pipes being black. Like most motorcycles featured in the update, it features a protruding primary drive with an &lt;a href=\"Atomic\"&gt;Atomic&lt;/a&gt;-branded belt, as well as a chain drive, which are fully animated.\nColor distribution is changed in comparison to the standard Daemon, where the primary color is applied on the fuel tank, oil tank and rear fender, while the secondary color is applied on the forks, frames, swingarm and chain cover. It uses the same wheel design as the standard Daemon, but the rims can support a dedicated color, which can be painted by selecting a custom rear wheel, applying a color and change back to the stock wheel (as it won't reset to the default alloy color). \nPerformance.\nThe Daemon appears to retain most of the qualities from its &lt;a href=\"Daemon\"&gt;Lost MC counterpart&lt;/a&gt;, although seems to be slightly slower in terms of acceleration, but makes up for the slightly higher top speed.\nLike the Lost MC version, the Daemon uses a chain-driven, V-twin internal combustion engine with a 5-speed manual transmission, as evidenced by the foot-actuated gear shifter. It has a mid-revving and odd-firing engine sound that is quite loud compared to the Lost MC version and the Hexer, which is also shared with the &lt;a href=\"Chimera\"&gt;Chimera&lt;/a&gt; added in the same update.\nInstalling any \"Belt Drive Cover\" modification will increase its traction slightly, in the same way as a spoiler."}

Her father is a wealthy businessman with a (a highly prestigious honorary title in the United Kingdom) who spent &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;\u00a3&lt;/a&gt;200,000 on her education.

She is a parody of rich celebrities in general, forgetting minor characters in their lives (Daisy continually calls Luis other names such as Dave or Leslie despite him correcting her) and trying to keep her reputation intact.\nEvents of \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nDaisy reunited with Luis in &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"Random%20characters\"&gt;random character&lt;/a&gt; in Maisonette 9.

There are a pair of green deck-mounted loading cranes.\nIt has a large superstructure with five levels above the deck with the bridge topmost. There is a radio and radar mast at the top of the superstructure and another radio mast at the bow. The exhaust stack is marked with a green and white striped livery with the home port painted on the top green band and identification as a Toli-Bean class freighter with 100,000 DWT (deadweight tonnage) marked on the bottom stripe. There are two six-man lifeboats mounted, one on each side of the second deck and two life raft containers mounted at the stern. A series of external stairways and ladders provide access between decks of the superstructure.\nThe hull is painted green with red below the Plimsoll Line. The superstructure is painted white with rust-red decks. The main deck is painted red. The bow is marked with the name of the ship painted in white on either side and it is also on the hull amidships and is painted in red on the stern. The home port of registration of Pumpherston is marked on the stern along with the numbers 45789 in black paint.\nThe ship has pipes on the deck that, when shot, will leak gas and do damage to anyone nearby as if it was &lt;a href=\"Tear%20Gas\"&gt;Tear Gas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe interior is completely inaccessible to the player. Other than during the missions where it is featured, there are no guards at all on the ship, and the player is free to explore it without taking risk.\nIt uses the same model as the \"&lt;a href=\"SS%20Bulker\"&gt;SS Bulker&lt;/a&gt;\", with minor cosmetic differences. The reduced draft and fewer containers on deck may indicate the \"Daisy Lee\" has a lower laden capacity than the \"SS Bulker\".

In an attempt to prevent Dale from drugging the women, Franklin himself is drugged by Dale, who quickly attempts to escape the scene.

The brothers are involved in selling drugs and cooking meth, with Elwood serving as a leader to his brothers.\nDale and his brothers are familiar with &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow drug dealer and the owner of &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Enterprises\"&gt;Trevor Philips Enterprises&lt;/a&gt;, whom the brothers are rivals with.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nTrevor arrives at the &lt;a href=\"Yellow%20Jack%20Inn\"&gt;Yellow Jack Inn&lt;/a&gt; and confronts &lt;a href=\"Tao%20Cheng\"&gt;Tao Cheng&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Cheng%27s%20translator\"&gt;interpreter&lt;/a&gt;. When they mention they want to pursue other jobs, Trevor threatens them to get them to tell him who they are working with, which turn out to be the O'Neil brothers. Trevor, now furious, proceeds to the &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20ranch\"&gt;O'Neil ranch&lt;/a&gt;, calling to threaten Elwood O'Neil on the way there. Upon arrival, Trevor begins a heavy assault against the guards and goes to the basement where the O'Neil's meth lab is located. Dale will be down in the basement begging for his life; if he is not killed, he will pull out a &lt;a href=\"Sawed-Off%20Shotgun\"&gt;sawed-off shotgun&lt;/a&gt; and start shooting, so therefore has to be killed. Trevor then picks up a &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Can\"&gt;Jerry can&lt;/a&gt; and pours a trail of petrol leading throughout the house and outside, and then ignites the trail, causing the house to explode in a blazing inferno. He then proceeds to leave the area.\nCharacter.\nAppearance.\nSimilarly to Elwood, &lt;a href=\"Walton%20O%27Neil\"&gt;Walton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wynn%20O%27Neil\"&gt;Wynn&lt;/a&gt;, the character model of Dale in the &lt;a href=\"Cutscenes\"&gt;cutscene&lt;/a&gt; is different than the one in-game.

His next step is to establish a means of temporarily cutting the power supply to Las Venturas in order to provide himself and &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Zi%20Mu\"&gt;Wu Zi Mu&lt;/a&gt;'s men with the cover of darkness and the resulting confusion while robbing the safe. To do this, Carl heads out to &lt;a href=\"Sherman%20Dam\"&gt;Sherman Dam&lt;/a&gt;, which supplies Las Venturas with hydroelectric power, to plant remotely detonated explosives on the main generators. After sneaking into the dam's facilities and planting the explosives, Carl escapes to the roof, only to be trapped by the guards. With &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20Sheriff\"&gt;deputies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Special%20Weapons%20and%20Tactics\"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt; closing in with their &lt;a href=\"Ranger\"&gt;Ranger&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;s from the dam's roadway below, CJ narrowly escapes capture by performing a swan-dive from one of the dam's control towers into the outlet channel to the south (erroneously labeled as &lt;a href=\"Sherman%20Reservoir\"&gt;Sherman Reservoir&lt;/a&gt; by the game).\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nReward.\nThe reward for completing the mission is an increase in &lt;a href=\"respect\"&gt;respect&lt;/a&gt;. The mission &lt;a href=\"Cop%20Wheels\"&gt;Cop Wheels&lt;/a&gt; is unlocked.\nGlitches.\nSome online walkthroughs for this mission, such as that posted on this website, indicate that Carl loses his weapons after parachuting out of the plane. In the PS2, iOS, and Xbox 360 versions, at least, Carl keeps all his weapons for the mission. In the PC version, if Carl lands on the red marker, he can keep his weapons; if he \"loses\" his weapons, he will be forced to use the knife, and won't even be able to use fists.\nIt's unclear whether this is a glitch, or the loss of weapons reported in the walkthroughs is a glitch; the BradyGames \"Official Strategy Guide\" makes no reference to losing weapons (and neither do either of the video walkthroughs on this page). The player regains his weapons at the end of the mission, other than any &lt;a href=\"Brass%20Knuckles\"&gt;Brass Knuckles&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Parachute\"&gt;Parachute&lt;/a&gt;s he had.\nIf the player loses their weapons, it is possible to regain them by purchasing at &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt;. All ammunition will be restored by a single purchase of that weapon type. However, the keyboard commands to change weapons will be rendered inoperative until CJ lands in the water, meaning the player will be forced to use the last weapon purchased."}

He was intended to be voiced by the late &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Fiore\"&gt;Bill Fiore&lt;/a&gt;, of \"Tales from the Darkside\" fame.\nDespite being taken out, Darkel remains listed in the \"GTA III\" manual credits and the character texture remains in the game's data files.\nHistory.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nDarkel was originally used both as a payphone mission giver contact, as well as a replacement for the &lt;a href=\"Rampages\"&gt;Kill Frenzies&lt;/a&gt; from the previous games. None of his missions were intended to have an impact on the storyline, serving only as secondary missions, including \"special jobs\" used to unlock unique items and unlock previously inaccessible areas.\nHis role was similar to the &lt;a href=\"Guider\"&gt;Guider&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\", an omnipresent fourth-wall-breaking character who gives the player the instructions for the &lt;a href=\"Kill%20Frenzies%20in%20GTA%202\"&gt;Kill Frenzies&lt;/a&gt;, introduces the player to each area of the city, and gives the final mission of each area.\nIt is assumed that Darkel may have been removed during the game's development after August 2001, when the game's &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt; promotional website was updated with an in-universe newspaper article titled \"&lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree/Strange%20Tramps%20Seen%20All%20Over%20Liberty%20City\"&gt;Strange Tramps Seen All Over Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;\".\nKill Frenzies.\nAs a Kill Frenzy replacement and a \"collectible\" type of character, Darkel was originally meant to be found hidden in many different areas of Liberty City, including alleys. When interacting with him, Darkel would give the Kill Frenzy objective, telling the player to kill a certain number of specific pedestrians (e.g. businessmen) in a specific time.\nThe player would identify Darkel's random positions through pedestrian reactions. They would originally hold their breath and comment about the bad smell whenever they were close to Darkel's Kill Frenzy contact areas.\nDarkel was also set to be invincible, so the game could trigger the Kill Frenzy regardless if he was run over by a vehicle. If a Kill Frenzy given by him in a specific area was failed, Darkel would move that specific failed mission trigger to another area of the city.\nPayphone Missions.\nIn addition to Kill Frenzies, Darkel was originally meant to give the player five missions via payphone, and they were slowly all cut during development. Some of the missions were later adapted to be given by the other payphone mission bosses. The only confirmed Darkel payphone mission that \"survived\" the game changes was &lt;a href=\"I%20Scream%2C%20You%20Scream\"&gt;I Scream, You Scream&lt;/a&gt;, given by &lt;a href=\"El%20Burro%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;El Burro&lt;/a&gt; in the final version.\nRemoval from \"Grand Theft Auto III\".\nIt was originally speculated that he was removed due to the . However, in a Rockstar Newswire Q&amp;A post about \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" in 2011, &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt; revealed that Darkel was removed simply due to the fact that his character felt out of place alongside the other characters \u2013 pedestrians are \"never\" targeted by that type of missions in the final version of the game.\nIn the final game, the Kill Frenzies are rebranded as \"&lt;a href=\"Rampages%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;Rampages&lt;/a&gt;\", and the targets are always armed gang members. They kept the same form as the previous Kill Frenzies, being triggered by collecting a hidden \"skull\" pickup. The mission fail system that moves the pickup to another area is kept in the game, but is dropped in subsequent titles, where the Rampages are always set to spawn in a specific area regardless if the player fails the mission.\nDebunked Myths.\nAll of the previous speculations over deleted terrorist missions are debunked as simply rumours after the 2021 release by GTA Series Videos of the information contained in \"GTA III: The Game Design Document\", a &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20North\"&gt;DMA Design/Rockstar North&lt;/a&gt; document dated from &lt;a href=\"2000\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;, confirming Rockstar's statement about Darkel being true.\nThe document also debunks Darkel's speculated mission &lt;a href=\"Love%20Hurts\"&gt;Love Hurts&lt;/a&gt;, which supposedly had the player being tasked with crashing a &lt;a href=\"Dodo\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Love%20Media%20Building\"&gt;Love Media Building&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a mission involving destroying a school bus with children \u2013 the Dodo (referred to as \"Wingless cessna\" in the 2000 document) was indeed never meant to be flown by the player, there were never any missions involving school buses, and Donald Love did not exist as a character until several months after Darkel was cut."}

He then served alongside them in the same &lt;a href=\"Fifteen%20Man%20Squad\"&gt;squad&lt;/a&gt; - which included twelve other boys from the village - during the . Darko developed a drug addiction and betrayed the squad for $1,000. The squad was ambushed by enemy forces and twelve of the fifteen members were killed. Darko, Niko and Florian survived and fled the scene separately.\nDarko left the country shortly afterwards. Niko and Florian both separately heard he had fled to &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nAfter a series of missions, one of Niko's &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper%20Contact\"&gt;contacts&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper\"&gt;United Liberty Paper&lt;/a&gt; agency locates Darko in , &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;. Darko is kidnapped and smuggled to &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, where he is left in the cargo bay of &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt; to Niko's mercy. Niko arrives at the airport with his cousin &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt;, and interrogates Darko.\nDarko admits to the betrayal, but reminds Niko that their squad was far from innocent: one of their squad mates, &lt;a href=\"Goran\"&gt;Goran&lt;/a&gt;, along with several others who followed him, were responsible for the deaths of some of Darko's own friends and neighbours. Darko thus became disillusioned with the war, and decided to sell out his squad for $1,000 to feed his drug addiction. Niko is horrified that he and his friends were sold out over such a paltry sum; in response, Darko asks how much Niko has charged for all the murders he has committed, pointing out his hypocrisy. He then falls to his knees and begs to be killed, telling Niko that he would be doing him a favor. He breaks down in tears, and Roman attempts to coax Niko away, observing that Darko \"doesn't look like he enjoys life too much.\"\nFate.\nThe player can then &lt;a href=\"That%20Special%20Someone\"&gt;decide&lt;/a&gt; whether or not to kill Darko. If Darko is spared, Niko initially questions his decision but decides that killing Darko would not bring him the closure he seeks. As Niko walks away, Darko runs away screaming, never to be seen again. Roman, Florian and the &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper%20Contact\"&gt;United Liberty Paper Contact&lt;/a&gt; congratulate Niko on finally letting go of his desire for revenge.\nShould the player choose to kill Darko, Niko will shoot him twelve times, one shot for each of his lost friends. Darko thanks Niko as he dies, and Niko walks away feeling, as he later says to Roman, \"empty\".\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nFor the majority of the game, the only knowledge of Darko's personality was in loose reference via Niko's personal thoughts on the then-unidentified traitor. Niko believed him to be a corrupt man entirely devoid of morals and only out to further his own survival. Naturally, this leads to the inference that Darko was a truly evil and heartless being who will think nothing of stabbing his own friends in the back if it benefitted him. Due to this, it is impossible to accurately presume Darko's pre-war personality.\nUpon actually meeting Darko, one realizes that this is only partially true. Darko's backstory reveals him to be a deeply troubled man who had been dealt some very bad cards in life. Darko was angered by the conflict he served in and the consequences it resulted in for those he was close with. His admittance in his decision to betray his squad revealed that he did not do it out of pure malice, but rather as a misguided vengeance for the friends and neighbors killed by his own comrades. This is the most likely cause for his severe drug addiction; though hoping for vengeance, the unconscious guilt in knowing he became responsible for even more of his friends' deaths spiraled him hopelessly further into his addiction. By 2008, the guilt from his actions has evidently long eaten him alive, leaving him an irreparably bitter, broken, and miserable man, whose only solace comes from drug intoxication and the eventual promise of death.\nAppearance.\nDarko is a Caucasian male of presumably similar age to Niko and Bernie; around 30 years old in 2008. He appears loosely similar to Niko physically, having a similar short haircut and five o'clock shadow; he also has notable sores and scratches on his face, presumably from his severe drug habits. He only has a single outfit, composed of a brown puffer jacket with a yellow stripe, a green checkered shirt worn over a black undershirt, blue jeans, and black shoes."}

Several of Lester's workers could be found working at the several rows of sewing machines inside the factory, whilst also providing Lester with the various materials he uses to prepare his heists. The factory's design suggests it was built during the 1920s. The radio station playing inside is &lt;a href=\"East%20Los%20FM\"&gt;East Los FM 106.2&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\nIt is based on the former Southwestern Bag Co. warehouse, which is located at 635 Mateo St., .\nEvents.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" in 2013.\nThe factory served as a meeting point for the and &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; to discuss plans for the &lt;a href=\"Fleeca%20Job\"&gt;Fleeca Job&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a drop-off point for several heist materials and equipment for both the Fleeca Job and the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Standard\"&gt;Pacific Standard&lt;/a&gt; heist. &lt;a href=\"Paige%20Harris\"&gt;Paige Harris&lt;/a&gt; would also wait within the factory to collect dropped-off equipment and bring it inside. \nThe original &lt;a href=\"Heists%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Heists&lt;/a&gt;, along with all pre- update content, are still available to be played post timeline advance in \"GTA Online\".

All of these original Heist missions set in the garment factory are still set in their original setting of 2013, shortly prior to being torched.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe factory acts as the main base of operations for some of the game's heists. Here, Lester and &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt; plan a &lt;a href=\"The%20Jewel%20Store%20Job\"&gt;robbery on the high-end jewelry store&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vangelico\"&gt;Vangelico&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;a raid&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Headquarters\"&gt;FIB Headquarters&lt;/a&gt; to steal sensitive information.\nIn the opening cutscene of &lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;The Bureau Raid&lt;/a&gt;, Lester and Michael burn down the factory, both to cover any evidence of them planning the heist and for Lester to claim the insurance on the factory. If the Roof approach was chosen, the player can fly the Maverick close to the factory to witness it going up in flames, which will prompt Franklin and Michael to comment on the spectacle. Following the mission, the factory doors will be blocked off by police tape, while the outer walls of the building will be scorched from the fire.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" after 2013.\nDuring the events of the update in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", set in &lt;a href=\"2024\"&gt;2024&lt;/a&gt;, Lester has put the building up for sale on &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank%20Foreclosures\"&gt;Maze Bank Foreclosures&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Pavel\"&gt;Pavel&lt;/a&gt; contacts the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist and suggests that they buy it, insisting he has a new opportunity for them if he does.

He is a character &lt;a href=\"Protagonist\"&gt;the player&lt;/a&gt; can employ as a to help out with &lt;a href=\"Heists\"&gt;Heists&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe is voiced by &lt;a href=\"Benton%20Greene\"&gt;Benton Greene&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nCalling himself a \"prodigy\", Daryl dropped out of school at an early age when he came up with an idea to rob banks: he would make a note, give it to a banker and get out of the bank, netting a few thousand dollars. He managed to rob the bank four times using this method, however, in the fifth time he was caught and sentenced to prison for 10 years.\nHe used his time in prison to study sociology, psychology and animal behavior. He claims that he transformed his brain into a \"super weapon\" in the process. Retrospectively, he calls his arrest the \"best thing that could have happened to him\".\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIf he is chosen for \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Paleto%20Score\"&gt;The Paleto Score&lt;/a&gt;\", Daryl will be killed during the escape when a police car will crush him against a wall. He will struggle for his life, shouting that he has lost all feeling in his legs and demanding Michael and Trevor pull the car off him, but will end up dying. His bag, with the money from the score can be collected near his body.\nIf he is chosen in the covert approach of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;The Bureau Raid&lt;/a&gt;\", he will die while fleeing the building, unless he is chosen along with &lt;a href=\"Hugh%20Welsh\"&gt;Hugh Welsh&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Norm%20Richards\"&gt;Norm Richards&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, he or the other gunman will randomly die in the explosion during the escape. So if Daryl dies, just repeat the mission until he is the one who survives. In the roof approach, he will survive unless he is killed (unscripted) during the shootout; his low hit points are a liability.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;The Big Score&lt;/a&gt;\", subtle approach, if chosen as the first gunman, Daryl will drop some gold bars while loading the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet\"&gt;Gauntlet&lt;/a&gt;, causing a $18 million loss for the crew, even if he has previous experience from the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; heist, he will still drop the gold. If chosen as the second gunman, there will be no consequences at all for the crew.\nIn the obvious approach, Daryl does a decent job being either the first or second gunman. It's important to know that, if he is the second gunman and doesn't have previous experience, there will be more chances of him dying during the shootout against the police. The player needs to protect him, so the heist doesn't fail.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nDaryl considers his brain to be his biggest weapon. He is also full of himself and is always scolding the other crew members. His skills in firearms are very low, making his cut the lowest of all the gunmen: 6%. Because of this, he is the worst gunman in the game.\nHe is extremely cocky, to the point of calling Michael and Trevor amateurs and saying that he should plan the scores. In \"The Paleto Score\", he claims that he is able to \"optimize the efficiency of the score\". After his death in that particular mission, Trevor even says that he would take fighting the &lt;a href=\"Military\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; alone over enduring \"another few minutes of [Daryl's] shitty attitude any day\". Michael responds by saying that while he knew Daryl wasn't that good of a gunman, he didn't know he was a dick.\nDaryl will use the &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt; in the Roof entry approach of \"The Bureau Raid\".\u00a0Franklin comments on it, asking him why he brought a weak weapon. Daryl will then state that the crew is lucky that he brought anything at all on his low salary.\nSkills.\nDaryl's skills includes:"}

The characteristic quad-tail light setup is very reminiscent of the , albeit circular.

It contains truck wheels from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", different lights and a \"California\" placeholder number plate.\nAs both the unused \"dach\" textures and the final version's &lt;a href=\"Bus%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Bus&lt;/a&gt; use the prefix \"dash\" for their texture images, it confirms that these are simply scrapped early textures for the regular Bus rather than a separate vehicle.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nAn unnamed vehicle similar to the &lt;a href=\"Coach\"&gt;Coach&lt;/a&gt; was cut from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" before release. The bus is seen in a commercial about &lt;a href=\"Higgins%20Helitours\"&gt;Higgins Helitours&lt;/a&gt; on the in-game TV programming (immediately after the end of &lt;a href=\"The%20Serrated%20Edge\"&gt;The Serrated Edge&lt;/a&gt;) of \"GTA IV\", but it is not available to ride or drive in the game. Both the model and the handling files are absent.\nThe design has been re-adopted into another vehicle in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" called the &lt;a href=\"Dashound\"&gt;Dashound&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Dashound is depicted with a triple-axle design and reuses the beta unnamed coach bus design found in a &lt;a href=\"Television%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;TV&lt;/a&gt; advertisement, with the exception of a smaller wheelbase and shorter rear overhang, and lacks the black-out side windows found on the \"GTA IV\" model.\nThe front assumes a sleek design with a curved split windscreen. Non-functional fog lamps are found on the bumper. Compared to other buses, the Dashound features a conventional front-facing hinge door, on which its mirror is mounted (although the mirror becomes detached once opened, see &lt;a href=\"%23Bugs/Glitches\"&gt;#Bugs/Glitches&lt;/a&gt;). Along the sides are numerous luggage compartment doors, all of which are non-functional. The rear engine bay door can also be opened in a collision.\nThe rear end includes turn signals and reversing lights, tail lights on the outer sides and brake lights on the inner sides. Numerous marker lights are found around the roof and illuminate at night.\nInside the vehicle are 8 sets of 2-seater chairs along either side of the bus. The blue patterned fabric used on the seats is shared with that of the &lt;a href=\"Bus%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Bus&lt;/a&gt;, although used on a different seat design. Roof lighting runs above the aisle. The dashboard consists of a conventional truck interior, which, in the enhanced versions of the game, features functional, analog truck dials.\nIn the enhanced versions of the game, the Dashound has additional horn variations of varying pitch. The horn choice is randomized when the vehicle is spawned.\nThe coach only appears in a permanent white and blue &lt;a href=\"Dashound%20%28company%29\"&gt;Dashound&lt;/a&gt; livery. It sports standard industrial wheels present on other trucks, such as the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bus%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Bus&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nBeing a large vehicle, its speed leaves much to be desired, and, with its heavy weight and rear engine, it also leaves a slow acceleration time of 0 to 60 in more than 12 seconds. Its top speed is better than the ordinary bus. The powerful inline 4-modeled engine makes a large engine sound, sounding even louder than the Bus. However, on the down side, its large height makes it prone to tipping over, even on the slightest of corners, so care must be taken when approaching corners, slowing down is advised to make a safe corner. If it does tip over, it can be nearly impossible to get back onto its wheels, the only way possible is to use props and land relief as a 'grip', wheel-spinning on a prop will result on the coach pulling itself onto its wheels. The player can also stand on top of a moving Dashound without the risk of falling off."}

At another unknown point in time, Dave married an unnamed woman, though they have since divorced. According to &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt;, Dave's career with the FIB had been \"unremarkable\" until &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, when he discovered the whereabouts of bank robber &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael Townley&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ludendorff\"&gt;Ludendorff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20North%20Yankton\"&gt;North Yankton&lt;/a&gt;. Dave made a deal with Michael to surrender his accomplices to the FIB, let them shoot &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; and arrest &lt;a href=\"Brad%20Snider\"&gt;Brad Snider&lt;/a&gt;, whilst Michael would fake his death after being \"shot\" by Dave, in turn boosting Dave's career for taking down the \"most wanted man in America\".\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nPrologue.\nIn 2004, during the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;Prologue&lt;/a&gt;,\" Dave ambushes the heist team as they make their escape. Using a &lt;a href=\"sniper%20rifle\"&gt;sniper rifle&lt;/a&gt;, he attempts to shoot Trevor but accidentally shoots Brad instead, and feigns a shot at Michael. Trevor manages to escape and Brad later dies, and Norton allows Michael to provide information to the Bureau in exchange for a new identity, a pension and a relocation to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. To aid this, Brad is buried in Michael's grave.\nPost-Prologue.\nSome time later, Dave intercepts a letter to Brad who is believed by the public to be incarcerated. The letter is unnamed but was sent from &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;, and Norton deduces that it was written by Trevor. Assuming Brad's identity, Norton begins corresponding with Trevor as a means to keep track of him.\nFor the next nine years Michael has been living in Los Santos under the surname De Santa, with Dave keeping in contact with him. Norton arrives at &lt;a href=\"Michael%27s%20mansion\"&gt;Michael's mansion&lt;/a&gt; after Michael and his protege, &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Jewel%20Store%20Job\"&gt;robbed&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Vangelico\"&gt;jewel store&lt;/a&gt;, warning the former that this act will attract Trevor.\nWorking with Michael.\nAs a result of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Jewel%20Store%20Job\"&gt;Vangelico's store robbery&lt;/a&gt;, Norton's boss, &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Haines\"&gt;Steve Haines&lt;/a&gt;, starts looking into Norton's old case files and, upon learning of the deal he made with Michael and seeing this as an opportunity, uses his position as Norton's superior to coerce him into persuading Michael, Franklin and Trevor to work for the FIB in their battle against the &lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;International Affairs Agency&lt;/a&gt; to secure more government funding. Norton begrudgingly accepts and goes off alone to explain the situation to Michael. After convincing him that him helping is the only way to keep both of them out of jail, Norton has Michael &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Man%20Walking\"&gt;infiltrate&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County%20Coroner%20Office\"&gt;IAA controlled morgue&lt;/a&gt; in order to ascertain the status of &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Kerimov\"&gt;Ferdinand Kerimov&lt;/a&gt;, providing assistance along the way. After discerning that Kerimov is alive and is currently being tortured by IAA agents at their headquarters, Norton, along with Haines and fellow corrupt agent &lt;a href=\"Andreas%20Sanchez\"&gt;Andreas Sanchez&lt;/a&gt;, force Michael, Franklin, and, to Michael's fury, Trevor to perform &lt;a href=\"Three%27s%20Company\"&gt;a mid-air extraction of him&lt;/a&gt;. However, despite rescuing him, Haines &lt;a href=\"By%20the%20Book\"&gt;immediately starts torturing Kerimov&lt;/a&gt;, bringing Trevor in to do the physical stuff while Michael, under Norton's escort, head out to assassinate &lt;a href=\"Tahir%20Javan\"&gt;Tahir Javan&lt;/a&gt;, a suspected &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijan\"&gt;Azerbaijani&lt;/a&gt; terrorist. However, a complication occurs when, upon situating themselves outside Tahir's house, they discover that he's throwing a lavish party, forcing Norton to make several calls to Haines in order to get a better description of him in order for Michael to make the shot without hitting the wrong target. Norton is then forced to accompany Haines while he briefs the trio about their assignments, starting with the robbery of a &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;armored Securicar&lt;/a&gt; containing funds the IAA collected from perpetuating the drug trade.\nUpon discovering that Michael and Trevor are hiding out at Trevor's trailer in Sandy Shores (due to Trevor attacking Mexican cartel kingpin &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin Madrazo&lt;/a&gt; and kidnapping his &lt;a href=\"Patricia%20Madrazo\"&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Caida%20Libre\"&gt;a job went south&lt;/a&gt;) Haines and Norton arrive at the meth lab used as the base for Trevor's &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips%20Enterprises\"&gt;drug and arms-smuggling business&lt;/a&gt; to inform them of their next assignment: &lt;a href=\"The%20Paleto%20Score\"&gt;providing funds&lt;/a&gt; for them to supply the resources necessary to &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20Business\"&gt;stage a raid&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Labs%20and%20Research\"&gt;Humane Lab and Research&lt;/a&gt;, an IAA controlled research lab when Haines claims they're developing a nerve toxin that they intend to use in a staged terrorist attack on a major city in order to increase their funding, leaving them to get in contact with Franklin and &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; so they can &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Score%20Setup\"&gt;plan&lt;/a&gt;, steal the necessary equipment, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Paleto%20Score\"&gt;execute the robbery&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County%20Savings%20Bank\"&gt;Blaine County Savings Bank&lt;/a&gt;, a front used by corrupt deputies from the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County%20Sheriff\"&gt;Los Santos County Sheriff's Department&lt;/a&gt; to store the money they extorted from the local weed farms and meth labs. However, upon arriving at a dock used as the staging area for the raid, Haines is furious that the trio didn't get the extra manpower necessary to help with the heist (a fact he forgot about as Norton claimed that he intended to have Sanchez inform them of this) forcing him and Norton to join Michael for the infiltration while Franklin and Trevor are on vehicle duty. The raid is ultimately successful, but Haines is forced to shoot himself in the leg in order to, in Norton's words, make himself look like a double agent. As he waits for Haines to return, Norton gets a call from Michael stating that Trevor has finally deduced what went down during the Ludendorff job and is &lt;a href=\"Bury%20the%20Hatchet\"&gt;on his way to his 'grave' to try and get him to calm down&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs their work against the IAA progresses, Haines becomes increasingly paranoid at the prospect of failing to cover his tracks. Haines and Norton coerce Michael and Franklin into &lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;breaking into&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Headquarters\"&gt;FIB Headquarters&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester&lt;/a&gt;'s assistance to eliminate incriminating files against Haines, promising to 'clear' Michael's record and release them from their indenture servitude toward them, should they succeed. After the raid, Michael calls Norton to make him honor his end of the deal, but Norton refuses to comply, having found out about Michael's complicity in Trevor's recent attacks against &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt;, and demands that he meet him, Haines and Sanchez at the &lt;a href=\"Kortz%20Center\"&gt;Kortz Center&lt;/a&gt; to discuss where they stand. Upon Michael's arrival, Haines, scared that the FIB have deduced that he backed the raid against them, betrays Michael and Norton and attempts to have Andreas Sanchez arrest them, but he is interrupted when they are all &lt;a href=\"The%20Wrap%20Up\"&gt;surrounded by a crew of IAA agents, a rival FIB team run by Sanchez and a battalion of Merryweather soldiers&lt;/a&gt;. Haines kills Sanchez and leaves Michael and Norton to die, but they manage to shoot their way out with Trevor's help. After clearing their way to escape, Dave takes a car and drives off and escapes. Norton is later called by a furious Michael, and he states that, by convincing the FIB that Sanchez was the party responsible for their recent actions and that he, Haines, and Michael's crew were forced to be complicit, he can get Haines under control for the time being.\nDave later meets with Haines, who wants to have all three protagonists killed, but Dave manages to dissuade him from having Michael and Franklin killed, but he insists that Trevor must die. Dave and Haines meet with Franklin, who is ordered by Haines to &lt;a href=\"Something%20Sensible\"&gt;kill Trevor&lt;/a&gt;, while Haines' associate &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt; tells Franklin to &lt;a href=\"The%20Time%27s%20Come\"&gt;assassinate Michael&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnding.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nOption C=\nIf Franklin chooses to &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;alert both Michael and Trevor&lt;/a&gt;, the trio will kill all of their major enemies: Haines, Weston, &lt;a href=\"Wei%20Cheng\"&gt;Wei Cheng&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stretch%20%28character%29\"&gt;Stretch&lt;/a&gt;. Although Trevor suggests killing Dave, Michael convinces Trevor to spare him so that no one comes after them later. After the mission, Dave emails Trevor and Michael. He informs Trevor that he wrote all the letters and emails from Brad. He assures Trevor that his secrets are safe, but warns him to stop causing trouble and to never contact him again. He asks Michael to stay out of trouble and also informs him that he has replaced Haines as host of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Underbelly%20Of%20Paradise\"&gt;The Underbelly Of Paradise&lt;/a&gt;\". He later phones Michael and asks about his family, before informing him that his work is \"good\" and that he has had a few \"lucky breaks\". Both men tell each other to look after themselves and part on good terms.\nOption A=\nIf Franklin chooses to &lt;a href=\"Something%20Sensible\"&gt;kill Trevor&lt;/a&gt;, he phones Haines after the mission to inform him of Trevor's death. During the phone call, Haines claims that Norton is close to being fired without his pension.\nOption B=\nIf Franklin chooses to &lt;a href=\"The%20Time%27s%20Come\"&gt;kill Michael&lt;/a&gt;, Dave emails Trevor informing him that he wrote all the letters and emails from Brad. He assures Trevor that his secrets are safe, but warns him to stop causing trouble and to never contact him again.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nNorton is a corrupt FIB agent, though not to the extent of his boss &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Haines\"&gt;Steve Haines&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike Haines, he is portrayed as a reasonable and polite man, preferring to solve problems amicably instead of using violence. However, he is more than capable of breaking the law if it means maintaining or advancing his career."}

DMA created a third game in &lt;a href=\"1991\"&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;, \"Lemmings\", which was commercially and critically successful, resulting in awards including winning European Game of the Year twice. Over the next two years \"Lemmings\" sold over 2 million copies,\nAfter the release of \"Syndicate Wars\" in &lt;a href=\"1996\"&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;, the company revised the concept to set it in a \"living city\" and cross it with a driving game, resulting in the successful and controversial \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\". In &lt;a href=\"2012\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt; Jones revealed that much of the controversy surrounding \"Grand Theft Auto\" was engineered by their publicist.\nDMA Design was soon after acquired by Gremlin Interactive, starting a chain of purchases that resulted in the studio becoming Rockstar North. Jones stayed with the company through &lt;a href=\"1999\"&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt; and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\" before leaving.\nOver the years after leaving, Jones founded several more video game studios which he mostly staffed with ex-DMA Design employees.

In &lt;a href=\"1921\"&gt;1921&lt;/a&gt;, he founded &lt;a href=\"Richards%20Majestic%20Productions\"&gt;Richards Majestic Productions&lt;/a&gt;, which he ran until &lt;a href=\"1978\"&gt;1978&lt;/a&gt;, when his son &lt;a href=\"Solomon%20Richards\"&gt;Solomon&lt;/a&gt; took over the business. According to the &lt;a href=\"WhokilledLeonoraJohnson.com\"&gt;WhokilledLeonoraJohnson.com&lt;/a&gt; website, David was well-known in the industry for his good heart and generosity, though Solomon refers to his father as a \"delusional man\". In Peter Dreyfuss' confession letter, it is implied that David's wife was called Rachel.\nDavid was a close friend of &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Dreyfuss\"&gt;Peter Dreyfuss&lt;/a&gt;, although how they met is unknown. During one night in &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, Richards and an inebriated Dreyfuss paid two &lt;a href=\"prostitutes\"&gt;prostitutes&lt;/a&gt; to stab each other to death. In &lt;a href=\"1975\"&gt;1975&lt;/a&gt;, when Dreyfuss murdered actress &lt;a href=\"Leonora%20Johnson\"&gt;Leonora Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, he wrote a &lt;a href=\"Letter%20Scrap\"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to David confessing to the murder. David destroyed the letter but decades later ended up confessing its existence while drunk to his grandson, &lt;a href=\"Ira%20Richards\"&gt;Ira Richards&lt;/a&gt;, before he died.\nRichards Majestic Productions was known for action movies, but sometime around the 1940s, likely under David's direction, began focusing on artistic films. Perhaps coupled with the effects of World War II, this may also be why the company began running into some financial difficulty.\nDavid also had a friendship with &lt;a href=\"Fred%20Quincy\"&gt;Fred Quincy&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Fred%27s%20Pictures\"&gt;Fred's Pictures&lt;/a&gt;, who wrote David a letter in &lt;a href=\"1949\"&gt;1949&lt;/a&gt; confessing to the &lt;a href=\"Murder%20Mystery\"&gt;murders&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Isaac&lt;/a&gt; and an unnamed woman, possibly Quincy's secretary. Quincy had his company buy a 5% market share of Richards Majestic at a significant over market rate to help them out, and while not telling David to stop making artistic films, he did urge him to go back to what he did best and what audiences expected of Richards Majestic, namely action movies.\nAccording to an internet article after the mission &lt;a href=\"Repossession\"&gt;Repossession&lt;/a&gt;, David died in &lt;a href=\"2012\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 103.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIf the player chooses, it is possible that they can find the 50 &lt;a href=\"Letter%20Scrap\"&gt;pieces&lt;/a&gt; of Dreyfuss' confession letter to Richards. In the letter, dated March 15, 1975, Dreyfuss confesses to the torture and murder of &lt;a href=\"Leonora%20Johnson\"&gt;Leonora Johnson&lt;/a&gt;. Once the letter is pieced together, Dreyfuss is confronted by &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; about the murder and, if the player chooses, Franklin can kill Dreyfuss."}

The only flaw of the gun is its poor accuracy, although as a drive-by weapon it is quite effective to puncture tires.\nA major advantage to this compared to other SMGs is that the light recoil can allow one to shoot accurately for an extended period of time, somewhat bypassing its main weakness."}

The presence of a driving range and skateboard park is also similar.\nLike most buildings in the game, the Golden Pier's size is significantly smaller than that of Chelsea Piers', being shorter in width. Whereas the main Chelsea Piers complex building branches its structural form out to two piers, the Golden Pier building only branches out to one; the wing containing the Chelsea Piers lighthouse is absent in the game."}

', \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\" episodic game for \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" feature golfing as an actual minigame.\nGolf Facilities.\nThe first depictions of golf in the GTA series appear in the form of golf courses in the city. They include:\nWith the exception of the Golden Pier Swingers Golf Course (which is merely a driving range), these golf courses tend to be depicted with open lawn areas, sand traps, water hazards, putting greens (complete with flag poles pinpointing golf holes) and the country club building itself; (non-interactive) &lt;a href=\"Tennis\"&gt;tennis courts&lt;/a&gt; are also present within the Leaf Links and Avispa Country Club. It is also common for the player to spot &lt;a href=\"Leaf%20Link%20Golfers\"&gt;golfer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Caddy\"&gt;Caddy&lt;/a&gt; golf carts in and around the courses.\nGolf as a minigame.\n\"GTA Vice City Stories\".\nIn \"GTA Vice City Stories\" the player can use the Leaf Links driving range.\nThe game mechanics of the minigame require the player to time their swings as accurately as possible by plotting an oscillating cursor on a \"power\" bar as close as possible to a designated point, thereby resulting in a more accurate shot. \nGolfing is first introduced during \"&lt;a href=\"Home%27s%20on%20the%20Range\"&gt;Home's on the Range&lt;/a&gt;\", which also unlocks the &lt;a href=\"Swinger%27s%20Club\"&gt;Swinger's Club&lt;/a&gt; golfing side mission.\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nIn \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\", the player is given the opportunity to tee off at the Swingers Golf Club driving range.\nThe game mechanics are similar to those used in Vice City Stories but in the Ballad of Gay Tony, the shooting mechanics are slightly improved to allow the player to point at the spot where they want the ball to land, while increasing the challenge of gameplay; the further the target which the ball must go, the higher the point which the cursor must be plotted at it is.\nGolfing is available after completing \"&lt;a href=\"Practice%20Swing\"&gt;Practice Swing&lt;/a&gt;\", after which it can be activated by accessing the front entrance of the Golden Pier's Swingers Golf Course; players can choose to play with an anonymous competitor, or play with any of &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Lopez's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Friendships%20in%20The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;friends&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto V\", golfing returns as a proper minigame, with much improved mechanics and gameplay. Playing Golf can be unlocked by completing Franklin\u2019s mission, &lt;a href=\"Complications\"&gt;Complications&lt;/a&gt;. To play a round of golf, the player must walk up to the entrance of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Golf%20Club\"&gt;Los Santos Golf Club&lt;/a&gt; and pay an entrance fee of $100. The golfing minigame consists of hitting the golf ball towards the green and then putting it into the hole in the least number of strokes possible. Between strokes, the player is allowed to drive the &lt;a href=\"Caddy\"&gt;Caddy&lt;/a&gt; to the next shot (this step can be skipped). \nGameplay now closely approximates a real game of golf with a full set of clubs at the players disposal. Players are able to change club and stroke type and adjust their aim and preset their desired power before attempting a swing. Putting greens include a slope indicator grid. Weather conditions directly impact the difficulty including wind strength and direction and rain slowing the greens and fairways. Hazards like water and out of bounds incur proper penalties and the rough and sand traps influence the release path and speed of the ball. Players can impart spin on the ball immediately after contact to attempt to achieve advanced strokes such as fades and draws.\nStatistics such as longest drive per hole, fairways and greens in regulation, and closest to the pin are all kept and a message will appear on screen whenever the player improves upon their personal best in a particular statistic.\nAll three &lt;a href=\"Protagonist\"&gt;protagonists&lt;/a&gt; can play golf with each other as a &lt;a href=\"Friendships%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;friend activity&lt;/a&gt;, though the character who instigates the game has to pay for both rounds. If the instigating protagonist owns the golf club, they will all play for free. \nIf the player begins a game of golf alone, they will be able to compete against up to three &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; players. Todd is available immediately, while the next three NPCs will become progressively available as opponents after completing a round with the easier level opponent. \nAll five opponents will be available to all three protagonists once any character unlocks them. \nThe NPC difficulty level not only relates to their individual skill but increases the chances of a more difficult round, with adverse weather more likely with the hard level characters. \nThe world clock is paused while the player participates in a round of golf.\nAn even par or below par complete round of 9 holes is required for &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;100% Completion in GTA V&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;GTA Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the player is able to play golf with other online players in the same session. The game mechanics for golf remain the same as in \"GTA V\", however now the player is able to wager &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; when they play against \"real\" opponents and their win statistics and number of holes in one are recorded on the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games%20Social%20Club\"&gt;Rockstar Games Social Club&lt;/a&gt;. \nPlaying golf will increase the character's &lt;a href=\"Statistics%23GTA_V.2FOnline_Statistics\"&gt;strength stat&lt;/a&gt;, and higher strength will result in longer drives in golf."}

It can be swung whilst stationary, or running.\nThe Golf Club is a very useful weapon to use on victims on the ground, as it is used very quickly once a person falls down.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nAlthough the Golf Club is not the fastest weapon in combat (as the &lt;a href=\"Knife\"&gt;Knife&lt;/a&gt; hits faster), it seems to be the fastest weapon to hit whilst running.

At an unknown time, Gonzalez and Colonel &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Cortez\"&gt;Juan Cortez&lt;/a&gt; became friends and allies, both gaining entry and diplomatic immunity to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, and both settling in &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;, with Gonzalez moving to the city first.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nGonzalez becomes Cortez's right hand, although in &lt;a href=\"1984\"&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt; he is shown to be stealing some of Cortez' &lt;a href=\"cocaine\"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt; to make a small profit for himself.\nHe later allies himself with &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;Victor Vance&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href=\"Home%27s%20on%20the%20Range\"&gt;testing him through a game of golf&lt;/a&gt;, asking Victor to &lt;a href=\"Purple%20Haze\"&gt;transport some cocaine, which was almost stolen by others looking for a profit&lt;/a&gt;.\nGonzalez later has a number of meetings with &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz\"&gt;Ricardo Diaz&lt;/a&gt;, who also employs Victor, who is aware of his actions behind Cortez' back. He later blackmails Gonzalez into giving him secrets about Cortez' drug shipments, as Diaz plans on becoming the city's drug baron, and in return he agrees to spare his life. \nGonzalez later manages to &lt;a href=\"Farewell%20To%20Arms\"&gt;flee the city&lt;/a&gt;, catching a flight from &lt;a href=\"Escobar%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Escobar International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, although he is attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Streetwannabe%27s\"&gt;Sharks&lt;/a&gt; en-route.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nAt some point between 1984 and 1986, Gonzalez moves back to the city alongside Cortez. The &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;Vice City Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt; (VCBI), already aware of his former underground work, see him as a way to learn more about Cortez' operation, and are suspicious of his relations with Diaz.\nHe later informs Ricardo Diaz of a planned drug deal between the &lt;a href=\"Vance%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Vance Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, which is ambushed by &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz%27s%20Hitmen\"&gt;Diaz's hitmen&lt;/a&gt;. Cortez, seemingly aware of Gonzalez' treachery, begins to look into the &lt;a href=\"In%20The%20Beginning...\"&gt;ambushed drug deal&lt;/a&gt;, that he had helped to set up, and looks closely at Gonzalez. Cortez discovers his secret business relationship with Diaz, even openly suggesting to &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt; that Diaz may have been involved in the ambushed drug deal, although he doesn't accuse Diaz.\nCortez has the 'incompetent' Gonzalez &lt;a href=\"Treacherous%20Swine\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; by Vercetti, who had been present at the ambushed drug deal. Gonzalez was killed whilst fleeing his penthouse in &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Point\"&gt;Vice Point&lt;/a&gt;. His killing attracts the attention of the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;VCPD&lt;/a&gt;, due to Gonzalez having diplomatic immunity, although Tommy manages to escape.\nCharacter.\nInfluence.\nGonzalez' appearance was partially based on that of infamous drug baron , according to the character's artist, &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Bliss\"&gt;Stephen Bliss&lt;/a&gt;, on Twitter."}

Gracie tells &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; during his test drive of her Feltzer that she was close to her father but avoided his mafia associates. Giovanni also seems permissive of her party-girl lifestyle, as she is spoiled by him and she has freedom to date and go home with any man she pleases.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2003\"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;, she was arrested for being in possession of &lt;a href=\"Cocaine\"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt;. Her father later bought her a pink &lt;a href=\"Feltzer\"&gt;Feltzer&lt;/a&gt; and she befriended &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt;, who granted her a membership to &lt;a href=\"Maisonette%209\"&gt;Maisonette 9&lt;/a&gt; as she had failed to get in before. The &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; believe her not to be involved in running the family, however they were suspicious of her friendship with Tony. During \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\", Gracie is seen with Tony, &lt;a href=\"Evan%20Moss\"&gt;Evan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rocco%20Pelosi\"&gt;Rocco Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; taking substantial amounts of cocaine. When Luis takes Tony to deal with some business, Gracie calls him a \"buzzkiller\".\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nKidnapping.\nIn 2007, she was arrested for driving while intoxicated, which prompted her to sell the pink &lt;a href=\"Feltzer\"&gt;Feltzer&lt;/a&gt; within the year. The following year, &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"I%27ll%20Take%20Her\"&gt;kidnapped&lt;/a&gt; Gracie for &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McReary\"&gt;Patrick McReary&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"McReary%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Irish Mob&lt;/a&gt;, who held her hostage in a &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Street%20Apartment%20Building\"&gt;safehouse&lt;/a&gt; to extort Giovanni Ancelotti. Later, they discover Giovanni's friend Gay Tony has the &lt;a href=\"Diamonds\"&gt;missing diamonds&lt;/a&gt;, and decide to exchange her for them instead.\nGiovanni did not believe them at first, thinking Gracie was at a man's house on a date, until they sent him a picture of her tied up and gagged in a chair. Giovanni then told Gay Tony and &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Lopez&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ladies%27%20Night\"&gt;follow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McReary\"&gt;one of the kidnappers&lt;/a&gt; to find out where Gracie was being held. After Gracie was moved to a new location, Giovanni agreed to surrender the diamonds. Once again, he sent Tony and Luis to do &lt;a href=\"Ladies%20Half%20Price\"&gt;the trade&lt;/a&gt; with Niko and Packie. Despite the deal being ambushed by &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt;, Gracie was returned to safety, and she, Luis and Tony fled the scene, while Niko and Packie were left to fight off Bulgarin's men.\nRandom characters.\nAfter several days had passed, Niko &lt;a href=\"Random%20characters\"&gt;encountered her again&lt;/a&gt; standing in front of her &lt;a href=\"Gracie%20Ancelotti%27s%20House\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt;. She is under tight security and likely paranoid, but still feels comfortable enough to stand just outside. She also has a new car, a pearl-white &lt;a href=\"Cognoscenti\"&gt;Cognoscenti&lt;/a&gt; (it's notable that the car is not a convertible and is built to be chauffeured, adding to the theory that she feels too paranoid to be alone or in the open too long). She recognizes Niko walking in front of her house and panics. Niko, wanting to avoid any trouble, pretends to not know her but she sends her guards to attack him (named &lt;a href=\"Anthony\"&gt;Anthony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mark\"&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tony%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Tony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Benny%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Benny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sal\"&gt;Sal&lt;/a&gt;), so Niko kills them all.\nCharacter.\nPersonality.\nGracie's voice and demeanor considerably change between \"GTA IV\" and \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\nIn \"GTA IV\" she has a much thicker Italian-American accent and her voice is deeper, with a nasally whine. However, her accent is very slight in \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" and her voice has a much higher pitch. In \"GTA IV\" during the car ride before Niko makes his intentions clear, she appears very friendly towards him, if not naive, easily trusting him with her concerns and views on relationships. This obviously changes dramatically as she realizes Niko is intending to take her hostage, quickly resorting to screaming, cursing and insulting. During further interactions in the game she remains hostile and uptight towards Niko, and during her random encounter she appears to suffer from paranoia and anxiety, easily recognizing Niko and panicking in fear.\nIn \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" she is portrayed as very sweet, caring and kind, especially towards Tony, defending him when &lt;a href=\"Rocco%20Pelosi\"&gt;Rocco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Evan%20Moss\"&gt;Evan&lt;/a&gt; say he \"holds everyone back\", and seems genuinely concerned when she realizes he's passed out, affectionately saying \"Tony get up baby\". In a similar fashion as in the main game, she flirts with Luis and is visibly annoyed at him rejecting her advances. As Luis and Tony rescue her, she is visibly distraught and fearful, frantically ordering Luis to murder Niko and Packie for kidnapping her."}

It is regarded as a freeway by Rockstar Games as the name is capitalized in the map. \nInfluence.\nIt is based on in , .\nExits and Entrances.\nNo exits or entrances are numbered in the game, so they will be listed in order from where it begins after the junction of &lt;a href=\"Frankfort%20Avenue\"&gt;Frankfort Avenue&lt;/a&gt; and Exeter Avenue to where it ends at the intersection of &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Expressway\"&gt;Northern Expressway&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leavenworth%20Avenue\"&gt;Leavenworth Avenue&lt;/a&gt;.\n1. &lt;a href=\"Northwood\"&gt;Northwood&lt;/a&gt; E, F Avenue Junction\nGrand Boulevard starts at the Exeter and Frankfort Avenue junction in &lt;a href=\"Northwood\"&gt;Northwood&lt;/a&gt;, and is the continuation of &lt;a href=\"Frankfort%20Avenue\"&gt;Frankfort Avenue&lt;/a&gt;. This part of Grand Boulevard consists of &lt;a href=\"Northwood%20Heights%20Bridge\"&gt;Northwood Heights Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and it is very busy as it is the most direct and fastest way to / from &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt; and northern, western &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;.\n2. &lt;a href=\"San%20Quentin%20Avenue\"&gt;San Quentin Avenue&lt;/a&gt; and Butterfly Street Intersection\nAfter the Boulevard lands on the island of Bohan, the traffic from Grand Boulevard, &lt;a href=\"San%20Quentin%20Avenue\"&gt;San Quentin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Butterfly%20Street\"&gt;Butterfly&lt;/a&gt; meets together. This junction carries busy traffic because San Quentin Avenue is the most straightforward road which connects &lt;a href=\"South%20Bohan\"&gt;South Bohan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fortside\"&gt;Fortside&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"East%20Borough%20Bridge\"&gt;East Borough Bridge&lt;/a&gt; to Grand Boulevard. Thus, the populated Fortside Housing Projects has its address on San Quentin Avenue. The Butterfly Street at the north continues at Greene Avenue, which provides fast access to the &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Industrial&lt;/a&gt; district.\n3. &lt;a href=\"Folsom%20Way\"&gt;Folsom Way&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Uprock%20Street\"&gt;Uprock Street&lt;/a&gt; Intersection\nNot far from San Quentin is the Folsom Way and Uprock Street junction. This junction is less busy than San Quentin but is very busy, too. It is because Folsom Way is the major shopping and leisure hub of the borough of Bohan. Thus, Folsom Way is the most direct way from &lt;a href=\"Boulevard\"&gt;Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Chase%20Point\"&gt;Chase Point&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Industrial&lt;/a&gt;.\n4. &lt;a href=\"Elbow%20Street\"&gt;Elbow Street&lt;/a&gt; Intersection\nApparently Elbow Street Intersection is less busy than its western intersections. Elbow Street serves the less popular side of Folsom Way (the hub) and some private residential buildings along the Grand Boulevard. Moreover, Folsom Way offers a more direct access to its southern neighborhoods like &lt;a href=\"Chase%20Point\"&gt;Chase Point&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Industrial&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Elbow Street intersection, the pedestrian pavement elevates and the boulevard merges into an one-lane traffic. Pedestrian footbridges, Elbow Street and Greene Avenue flyover can be seen above the boulevard.\nBeing one of the two ways to travel from West Bohan to East Bohan without leaving the borough, Grand Boulevard carries busy traffic from Elbow Street to &lt;a href=\"Leavenworth%20Avenue\"&gt;Leavenworth Avenue&lt;/a&gt;.\n5. &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Expressway\"&gt;Northern Expressway&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leavenworth%20Avenue\"&gt;Leavenworth Avenue&lt;/a&gt; Intersection\nAfter the junction of &lt;a href=\"Leavenworth%20Avenue\"&gt;Leavenworth Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, the Grand Boulevard continuation is named as &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Expressway\"&gt;Northern Expressway&lt;/a&gt;. Northern Expressway offers two-lane traffic and brings some traffic from &lt;a href=\"Little%20Bay\"&gt;Little Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Industrial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Gardens\"&gt;Northern Gardens&lt;/a&gt; to Grand Boulevard. Thus, Leavenworth Avenue serves as a major north-south thoroughfare of eastern Bohan, bringing traffic from &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Gardens\"&gt;Northern Gardens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Industrial&lt;/a&gt;. This makes this intersection to quite busy.\nGrand Boulevard ends here and &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Expressway\"&gt;Northern Expressway&lt;/a&gt; continues its span."}

Donald states that the authorities had intercepted the plane, however he has managed to bribe them.\nClaude drives to Donald's hangar at &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Vale\"&gt;Shoreside Vale&lt;/a&gt;. However the Liberty City Port Authority officers have all been killed, and six &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;Colombian Cartel&lt;/a&gt; gang members are waiting inside. Claude kills them and enters the Dodo, but realizes the package has gone. Noticing a &lt;a href=\"Panlantic\"&gt;Panlantic&lt;/a&gt; van in front of the hangar, he drives to the &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Plaza\"&gt;Panlantic construction site&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Staunton\"&gt;Fort Staunton&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce at the construction site, he kills more Colombian Cartel gang members and uses the elevator to get to the upper levels. There, he sees &lt;a href=\"Miguel\"&gt;Miguel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt;, who have Love's package. When Claude challenges them, Miguel hands him the package, which leads to Catalina shooting Miguel out of anger before she leaps out of the building and lands in a garbage bin to escape.\nA little later, &lt;a href=\"Asuka%20Kasen\"&gt;Asuka Kasen&lt;/a&gt; and the Yakuza arrive to take over the area from the Cartel. Still thinking that the Cartel &lt;a href=\"Waka-Gashira%20Wipeout%21\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; her &lt;a href=\"Kenji%20Kasen\"&gt;brother&lt;/a&gt;, she begins to torture Miguel. Claude then goes to Love Media to deliver the package.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nReward.\nThe reward for completing this mission is &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;50,000. Members of the &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt; will now be present in the area around the construction yard, engaging in shooting with the Colombians (who will also still be there). The missions &lt;a href=\"Escort%20Service\"&gt;Escort Service&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bait\"&gt;Bait&lt;/a&gt; are unlocked, the latter of which will permanently disable &lt;a href=\"Asuka%20Kasen\"&gt;Asuka Kasen&lt;/a&gt;'s first strand of missions, making &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;100% completion&lt;/a&gt; impossible if not completed."}

The \"Grand Theft Auto\" series has also been ranked 5 in the best-selling video game franchises of all time.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI/Trailers\"&gt;first trailer&lt;/a&gt; for \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto VI&lt;/a&gt;\" on December 4, 2023, broke three previous for most viewed videogame reveal on YouTube in 24 hours (at 90,421,491 views), most liked videogame trailer on YouTube (with 8.9 million likes in the first 24 hours) and most viewed YouTube video in 24 hours (non-music) (surpassing 's \"Every Country On Earth Fights For $250,000\").\nAs of August &lt;a href=\"2023\"&gt;2023&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series had sold over 405 million copies worldwide.\nThe next entry in the series, \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto VI&lt;/a&gt;\", is scheduled for release in 2025, and is due to be the most immersive title in the series.\nOverview.\nThe \"Grand Theft Auto\" series, belonging to, and to some extent &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Clone\"&gt;defining&lt;/a&gt; the genre of free-roaming video games called \"sandbox games\", grants a large amount of freedom to the player in deciding what to do and how to do it through multiple methods of transport and weapons. Unlike most traditional action games, which are structured as a single-track series of levels with linear gameplay, in \"GTA\" the player can determine the missions they want to undertake, and their relationships with various characters are changed based on these choices. The cities of the games can also be roamed freely at any point in the game, offering many accessible buildings and minor missions. There are exceptions: missions follow a linear, overarching plot, and some city areas must be unlocked over the course of the game.\nThe plot of the games generally allows the player to take on the role of a criminal in a big city, typically an individual who rises through the ranks of organised crime through the course of the game. Various missions are set for completion by the figureheads of the city underworld, generally criminal, which must be completed to progress through the storyline. Assassinations and other crimes feature regularly. Other activities like taxi driving, firefighting, pimping, street racing, or learning to fly fixed-wing aircraft are also involved as alternate adventures, which can be done at any time during the game, with the exception of the periods performing main missions.\nSetting.\nWith the exception of the &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; expansion/mission packs for the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;original game&lt;/a&gt; and update for \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the games are set in a fictional, heavily satirical recreation of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt; with references made to the rest of the world. Gameplay takes place in settings ranging from the largest cities in the country to small towns and remote wilderness and desert areas.\nUniverses.\nIndividual games in the series have been categorized into three distinct , officially named by Rockstar Games as the \"&lt;a href=\"2D%20Universe\"&gt;2D Universe&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;\" and the \"&lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;\". Each universe is designed to be completely separate to each other so that no physically appearing characters or storylines would overlap. Different variants of existing brands and in-game media personalities exist across these universes, as completely different characters.\nThe 2D Universe follows the independent storylines of DMA Design's original top-down titles, following the stories of various criminal organizations surrounding the silent male and female protagonists doing freelance work for each group. The 2D Universe consists of \"Grand Theft Auto\", \"Grand Theft Auto: London\" and \"Grand Theft Auto 2\".\nThe 3D Universe started in 2001 with the release of \"Grand Theft Auto III\", a reboot of the series, introducing full 3D graphics during gameplay using the &lt;a href=\"RenderWare\"&gt;RenderWare&lt;/a&gt; engine. The universe's other games are prequels of the canon established in \"Grand Theft Auto III\", loosely connected to the game's events. The canon of this universe consists of \"Grand Theft Auto III\", \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", \"Grand Theft Auto Advance\", \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\" and \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nIn addition, this universe is shared with Rockstar North's survival horror duology \"&lt;a href=\"Manhunt\"&gt;Manhunt&lt;/a&gt;\", including its brands and certain celebrity characters.\nIn 2006, Rockstar Games developed its proprietary game engine &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Advanced%20Game%20Engine\"&gt;Rockstar Advanced Game Engine&lt;/a&gt; (RAGE), which had its debut in \"\", a sports game developed by &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20San%20Diego\"&gt;Rockstar San Diego&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first use of the RAGE engine in the \"Grand Theft Auto\" was in 2008, with the second and latest reboot in the series, officially named the HD Universe, which consists of all titles following the new canon established in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\". This includes \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", \"Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City\", \"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\", \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nGame List.\nThere are currently sixteen games in the series, including two expansion packs for the original game, two expansions for \"GTA IV\", and a dedicated multiplayer title. The games have been released for various platforms, including the &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%201\"&gt;PSX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%202\"&gt;PS2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20%28console%29\"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PS3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PS4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Color\"&gt;GBC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dreamcast\"&gt;DC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Advance\"&gt;GBA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%20Portable\"&gt;PSP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20DS\"&gt;DS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Apple%20iOS\"&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Android%20OS\"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; with all but two of the games released on multiple platforms.\n2D Universe.\nThe following games are set in the same universe and continuity established by the original \"Grand Theft Auto\".\n3D Universe.\nThe following games are set in the same universe and continuity established by \"Grand Theft Auto III\", and their stories are loosely connected.\nHD Universe.\nThe following games are set in the same universe and continuity established by \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", and their stories are loosely connected.\nGame Overview.\n2D Universe.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2D%20Universe\"&gt;2D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, the graphics engines provided \"top-down\" gameplay in two dimensions with missions counting towards a score to unlock the next set of missions.\n3D Universe.\nThe &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; featured the first blockbuster \"GTA\" title, \"Grand Theft Auto III\", and introduced a 3D game world and third-person perspective. The entire era contains interlocking storylines, and many characters appear across multiple games. Notably, games in this era were not released in &lt;a href=\"Timeline%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;chronological order&lt;/a&gt;, with the first game released being the last chronologically, and the last game released being the first chronologically.\nHD Universe.\nThe &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; featured Rockstar's &lt;a href=\"RAGE\"&gt;RAGE&lt;/a&gt; engine, also used in . The gameplay did not change dramatically from the successful 3D Universe formula. This era features:\nThe Fan Base.\n\"Grand Theft Auto\" has one of the largest fan bases of any game franchise. There are many unofficial fansites about \"GTA\" games, providing the latest news, download databases, and often an online forum for the \"GTA\" community. Thousands of \"GTA\" fansites exist, ranging from small one-person news blogs to community-edited wikis (like this one) to massive download databases to forums with hundreds of thousands of members.\nThis is a list of some of the most popular fan sites, some of which were even acknowledged by Rockstar:\nAn activity popular with fans is &lt;a href=\"Modifications\"&gt;modding&lt;/a&gt; - creating new vehicle models, skins, re-texturing objects, and tweaking settings in the games' configuration files. These modifications are made freely available on fansites for anyone to download and install into their game.\nAnother popular pastime (since \"GTA III\") is &lt;a href=\"stunting\"&gt;stunting&lt;/a&gt; - the act of performing wild stunts with vehicles, which are produced into compilation videos.\nAnother activity popular with members of the community is writing &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Agtafanon\"&gt;Fan Fiction&lt;/a&gt; - stories based on events which follow on from, or are based around events which happen in the games, but these are not to be considered canon.\nNote that modified games and fan-fiction are not to be documented here on the GTA Wiki."}
