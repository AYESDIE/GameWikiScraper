Further spoiler customisation can be applied to resemble the Pikes Peak version. The rear fascia features inspiration from the , while the frontal area in particular takes influence from the , such as the front indicators, bonnet, and lower grille. \nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle is depicted as a compact car with extensive rally modifications around it. The front features a wide splitter with two open sections, with the driver-side one sporting a racing hook. The area above it is occupied by the flat bumper and a set of lower intakes and white/amber lamps, which feature four rally lights and a small identification plaque that acts as the license plate. The upper area features a plastic, lightweight grille/front with twin circular headlamps on the edges and the Obey logo on the centre. Its bonnet sports a central intake, bolt-on vents on the sides and thin intakes near the windscreen, along with safety pins.\nOn the sides, the fender and skirting area is occupied by a wide-body kit that also includes the aforementioned front splitter, where the front fenders have a front curvature, plastic fins and single exit vents on the rear, while the rear fenders have dual bolt-on front intakes and rear exit vents. The cabin area features plastic trim around the windows and bolt-on side and rear window frames. The windscreen features a banner with \"OBEY TEAM\" marked on it, while the driver-side window appears to incorporate a slider kit (a smaller, openable compartment within the same wibdow), though only as a cosmetic feature. The rearmost pillars seem to have small vented sections near the rear fenders.\nThe rear area of the car is mostly occupied by the large racing wing, while the rear end is occupied by a bolt-on central vented section, a traditional license plate and rectangular tail lamps with plastic trimmings around these. What appears to be safety pins can be seen near the rear window and below the tail lamps, hinting at an apparent openable boot that is fixed due to the large wing. The bumper is relatively small, with a small single exit exhaust tube placed on the passenger side.\nOn the underside, the car uses a multi-link suspension system, with each of the four axle shafts having parallel trailing arms, plus a third arm connecting to the wheelbase of the vehicle, parallel to the wheels. Part of the exhaust system of the car, especially the exhaust silencer/muffler, appears to be protected by a small cage, in order to avoid damage to said component in the event of a rough landing. A set of plastic mudguards with the Obey marking can be seen behind each wheel.\nThe interior of the car makes use of steel foot rests and sport seats with race seatbelts, along with door pull straps. The Omnis includes many switches and buttons across the interior, as well as an RPM indicator placed in the gauge cluster, below the analog dials. The steering wheel features the manufacturer emblem on the centre, while a large extended gear-shifter is centralized between the seats. Also, a radio is seen located under the dashboard.\nThe vehicle's bodywork and the stitches on the steering wheel are painted in a primary colour, while the interior, cabin roll cage and brake calipers are painted in a secondary colour. Although not accessible, it has a tertiary colour for the cage paddings and a dial colour, which are set to black in purchased examples and white in those generated in &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;. Its wheels are a derivative of the \"Five Star\" rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in &lt;a href=\"Atomic\"&gt;Atomic&lt;/a&gt; Rally high-profile, all-terrain tyres with detailed tread patterns. The stock wheel rims are painted with the \"Wheel\" color.\nThe liveries have the following sponsors:\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle, as expected, performs well on paved surfaces. The car also has great, nimble steering, allowing quick maneuvers to be carried out instantly. The compact design gives it good ability to avoid attackers.\nOff-road, the vehicle behaves almost as one with knowledge of Group B rally cars would expect. The car's engine is able to propel it to a good top speed, though not quite as high a top speed as the other Group B/ Group A rally cars in the sports class. The cornering ability of the car on loose gravel and dirt surfaces is very good, thanks to the car's fairly short wheelbase and AWD powertrain. Despite the Omnis' relatively high weight, it does have good grip off-road, though there is a slight tendency for the rear end to loosen up if throttle control if improperly managed. The car's relatively low centre of mass allows a driver to attack banks and bumps without having to worry too much about the car tipping onto two wheels or rolling over.\nThe engine sound is very high revving similar to the &lt;a href=\"Bifta\"&gt;Bifta&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;, and its in-game model appears to be a twin-cam 4-cylinder engine, labeled with the Obey logo. The car also sports a gentle turbo hiss, along with a blow-off valve occasionally heard. As expected, the vehicle also sports a 5-speed gearbox and an all wheel drive layout with equal torque distribution."}

On the upper area, the central portion is surrounded by a black detail and features a split lower grille, a painted section with the number plate, and an upper grille with a plastic detail, while the portions beside the black separation have large arrow-shaped intakes and smaller ducts with a CFRP detail. Beside the upper grille, there are modern headlamps consisting of small LED-like main units on the lower side and modern strips above, together with indicators on top. The front boot has an impressed area with an elevated section in the centre and the manufacturer logo on the front end, which opens to reveal a small luggage compartment finished in black.\nOn the sides, the car features exit vents on the front fenders, distinctive lines angled slightly upwards towards the rear and flared rear arches, along with black side skirts and numerous formations above, consisting of flat lines passing through the door handles and curved ones over the wheel arches, reaching towards both ends but leaving a small gap in the middle. The glasshouse area makes use of painted mirror shells with black supports on the front, and a black/plastic finish for the trims around the windows and the inner pillars, while the roof panel is separated by two black/plastic trims. The rear area features a small boot lid with a black/plastic panel adjacent to the rear window and an active aero rear wing that is activated at moderate speeds, in a similar way to cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Comet%20S2\"&gt;Comet S2&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Comet%20S2%20Cabrio\"&gt;convertible variant&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the rear end, the boot lid bears the manufacturer logo on the upper area, a black section in the middle, and the central number plate with the silver \"OBEY\" lettering at the bottom. The car houses upper main/brake lamps and lower indicators on the outer edges, while the boot lid houses the narrow third brake lamp and small reverse lamps beside the aforementioned indicators. The rear bumper houses a large diffuser with a narrow exit vent above and a larger central vent below. The underside is mostly generic, albeit featuring black panelling in the middle.\nThe interior of the vehicle is derived from cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Revolter\"&gt;Revolter&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"V-STR\"&gt;V-STR&lt;/a&gt;, with the analogue dials derived from cars such as the &lt;a href=\"FMJ\"&gt;FMJ&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tempesta\"&gt;Tempesta&lt;/a&gt;. The Obey logo can be seen on the horn cap.\nMost of the bodywork is painted with the primary colour, while the mirror shells and the interior stitching are painted with the secondary colour. The rims appear to be a variation of the \"Ice Storm\" Track rims available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, but most of the rim is finished in black and lacks the rivet details on the outer portion.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Omnis e-GT\u2019s acceleration is great for a sports electric vehicle, reaching 62 mph/100 kph in 2.5 seconds. However, like other electric vehicles, its top speed is underwhelming, only reaching 111.5 mph/179.4 kph. On the other hand, the vehicle is quite heavy for a sports car, as it can ram through traffic with only losing some speed. Due to its weight, it has poor braking capabilities, and will likely spin out when crashing into traffic. At high speeds, the Omnis e-GT handles rather unresponsive, and it suffers from oversteer.\nIt is stated to be powered by two electric motors, powering all wheels. It has the same electric sound as other similar vehicles, such as the &lt;a href=\"Voltic\"&gt;Voltic&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Neon\"&gt;Neon&lt;/a&gt;.\nFeatures.\nThe Omnis e-GT, along with the &lt;a href=\"Greenwood%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Greenwood&lt;/a&gt; and selected vehicles from update, can be modified with a Remote Control Unit, which allows the ability to drive the vehicle remotely, similar to the &lt;a href=\"RC%20Bandito\"&gt;RC Bandito&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Invade%20and%20Persuade%20Tank\"&gt;Invade and Persuade Tank&lt;/a&gt;. Note that this feature cannot be kept if the Missile Lock-on Jammer is installed, and that the camera is always set to first-person view.\nArmour/Defense.\nWith 100% Armor upgrade and a player inside, the Omnis e-GT can withstand two regular explosives, or six Explosive rounds from the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper Mk II&lt;/a&gt; (blowing up on the next round). Unlike the vehicles from update, it lacks bulletproof windows, but it does not appear with a unique radar blip (features also present on the Greenwood and &lt;a href=\"300R\"&gt;300R&lt;/a&gt;).\nWhen the Armor Plating upgrade is equipped, the vehicle is given armour padding on the sides in a similar manner to the armoured vehicles featured in the update. However, it gives even higher resistance to explosives than any Imani tech vehicles, resisting 11 &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RPGs&lt;/a&gt;/missiles, or 29 &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper MK II&lt;/a&gt; explosive rounds (The amount of explosives is halved if not occupied or remote controlled by a player).\nThe Omnis e-GT, along with the Greenwood and selected vehicles from The Contract update, can be modified with a Missile Lock-on Jammer, which prevents the lock-on system of the &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Launcher\"&gt;Homing Launcher&lt;/a&gt; and other weaponised vehicles to lock onto it. Note that it cannot be kept if the Remote Control Unit is installed.\nWeapons.\nThe vehicle has the option to install Slick Proximity Mines (green flashing light), which burst a large amount of oil on the surface, causing vehicles passing over it to lose control. This deals no damage to either vehicles or players.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe vehicle can be customised in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, although special upgrades (tagged with ) are only available at the vehicle workshop inside &lt;a href=\"Agencies\"&gt;Agencies&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Omnis%20e-GT\"&gt;Omnis e-GT&lt;/a&gt; has been featured in the following events:\nChange History.\nReleased in ."}

{"id": "30432", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=30432", "title": "On-Foot Abilities", "text": "Besides &lt;a href=\"driving\"&gt;driving&lt;/a&gt;, one of GTA's core gameplay features is the ability for the player to control the action of their &lt;a href=\"Protagonist\"&gt;player characters&lt;/a&gt; on foot. Originally, on foot action as seen in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" simply encompassed basic movement and operation of weaponry in \"GTA\", but was significantly improved from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" onwards to include additional features and capabilities.\nRunning, Jumping, Climbing, etc..\nIn \"GTA\", the player only possesses the ability to run and jump, the latter allowing the player character to basically \"fly\" over vehicles, which can be used to hide behind cover of a vehicle or cut corners while running on foot. \"GTA\" introduced a comedic feature of \"burping\" and \"farting\" that was never reintroduced in any other games besides \"GTA 2\".\nFor \"GTA III\", the player possesses the ability to walk, run and sprint. Walking is only possible via the use of a game pad's analog control, while sprinting, essentially accelerated running, is executed by the press of a button or key, but is limited in that the player character will go tired after an extended amount of sprinting. Sub-missions allow the player to infinitely sprint, while players may alternatively tap the sprint command instead to maximize the sprint command's effectiveness if they have yet to acquire infinite sprint. For \"\", tapping the sprint command will allow the player character to run faster than holding it. Walking is also made possible as a readily available command to slow down runs in \"San Andreas\", and is the default movement in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", which in turn requires the player hold the sprint command to run and tap to sprint.\nThe jump command was further refined in \"GTA III\" to allow the player to better jump up vehicles and solid objects in the environment, although that too has its limitations: The player must stand at an optimum distance from the target which they want to jump up to or the player character will instead back up in a \"dodging\" stance if they are too close to the targeted location. The jump command was complemented with the ability to climb in \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\"; by jumping in front of a fence, wall or an environmental object, the player can climb up if they can reach the edge of the object and grab hold. These changes were not adopted in ', which used pre-GTA San Andreas player movement, but were utilized to a limited extent in ' to allow the player to climb out of water. For \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", \"San Andreas\" jump-climb abilities were reintroduced and the player character is given the additional ability to shimmy along a straight ledge after jumping and grabbing hold; players are also able to scale ladders (which, until \"GTA IV\", were non-interactive), allowing for access to places that will otherwise require the use of an aircraft. In addition to ladders, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Escape\"&gt;fire escapes&lt;/a&gt; which were also non-interactive in the \"GTA III\" era, were implemented in \"GTA IV\", though many of them require the player to jump onto a vehicle in order to access one by street level rather than the actual use of one by access via roof.\nCombat and Firearms.\nAnother core aspect while on foot is the ability to wield and use weapons. Whereas the first \"GTA\" game began with only five weapons, the series has since expanded selections of weapons to include hand-to-hand combat (including melee weapons), firearms and explosives. Other unconventional items that are classified as \"weapons\" include &lt;a href=\"camera\"&gt;camera&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dildo\"&gt;dildo&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"vibrator\"&gt;vibrator&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"flowers\"&gt;flowers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Night%20Vision\"&gt;night vision&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thermal%20Vision\"&gt;thermal vision&lt;/a&gt; goggles, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Extinguisher\"&gt;fire extinguishers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"parachute\"&gt;parachute&lt;/a&gt;s and others seemingly non-lethal objects.\nSwimming.\nSwimming was introduced in \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" to allow the player to travel on water or underwater without the aid of a vehicle. The feature has since enjoyed some use, with ', \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;IV&lt;/a&gt;\",\u00a0'\u00a0and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;V&lt;/a&gt;\" adopting the feature. For games without this ability, contact with deep water can lead to a quick death."}

As they walk across the golf course, Franklin explains the club is where all the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood\"&gt;Vinewood&lt;/a&gt; deals get made, but one has to play golf for the important stuff. On the way to the fourth hole, he points out their contact &lt;a href=\"DJ%20Pooh\"&gt;DJ Pooh&lt;/a&gt;, who walks over partway to greet Franklin and is introduced to the Protagonist, his business associate. On the way back to the tee-off area, Franklin assures Pooh that the agency is set up and ready to go and Pooh points out that his own reputation will be on the line if the pair doesn't deliver. He then introduces Franklin and the player to rapper &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Dre\"&gt;Dr. Dre&lt;/a&gt;, who has dragged out record executive and friend &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Iovine\"&gt;Jimmy Iovine&lt;/a&gt; to play golf.\nJust as introductions are made, the group is interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Eugene%20%28GTA%20Online%29\"&gt;Eugene&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Raymond%20%28GTA%20Online%29\"&gt;Raymond&lt;/a&gt; asking to play through, as they are blocking the fourth hole. Dre refuses to allow them through, which causes the two golfers to threaten Dre and the group with a golf course ban, as Raymond's wife is \"having an affair with the owner\" and therefore has connections.\nOnce the two storms off, Dre asks Franklin and the player to prove themselves by dealing with the two golfers: if they're good enough to find his property, this should be easy for them. He briefly explains that his cell phone was in fact not lost, but stolen &lt;a href=\"2020\"&gt;a year ago&lt;/a&gt;, and it contained unreleased music he was working on. He is adamant that he get his work secured, as he will not release any music to the public before he decides it's ready. They agree, and when Franklin confronts the golfers, they flee in their golf carts. Franklin and the player jump in a &lt;a href=\"Caddy\"&gt;Caddy&lt;/a&gt; to begin a pursuit with the player at the wheel.\nThe player chases the two golf carts through &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro\"&gt;Del Perro&lt;/a&gt;, ramming them until an intimidation meter is filled and Raymond gives up. Once the second cart is damaged enough, the player and Franklin tail Eugene to &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro%20Pier\"&gt;Del Perro Pier&lt;/a&gt;, where his Caddy breaks down with him getting out and running in fear for a short length when he trips and falls on the boardwalk. The player then intimidates Eugene by beating him with a &lt;a href=\"Golf%20Club\"&gt;golf club&lt;/a&gt;, until he ends it by telling them that he'll resign his own membership and drop any action against Dre.\nOnce the intimidation is over, Franklin calls Dr. Dre and lets him know that the matter has been dealt with.

A client has commissioned them to perform a third-party test on the F-160 Raiju fighter jet before signing a procurement contract.\nAfter taking off and disabling the VTOL system of the aircraft, the first test of the list consists of enabling the aircraft's stealth mode before crossing &lt;a href=\"Raton%20Canyon\"&gt;Raton Canyon&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Merryweather\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt; has set up batteries of air defenses. Failing to activate the stealth mode when flying through the air defenses will lead to them firing at the Raiju, likely destroying it instantly. \nOnce this test has been successfully passed, the player is directed towards Sandy Shores to start the next test; the client has sent a checklist of flight maneuver (rolls, knife flight, loops and inverted flight) the player must perform with a point system. Each maneuver performed grants a certain number of points on a total of 15. The test concludes once the player earns 15 points.\nThe next and last test consists of an AR shooting training; several virtual targets will appear above &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;, each worth a certain number of points depending on their color. The player has three minutes to destroy as many targets as they can. During this test, Charlie comments on how the client usually approaches Merryweather for such tests, but has since lost trust in them due to their recent debacle at the &lt;a href=\"Davis%20Quartz\"&gt;Davis Quartz&lt;/a&gt; quarry during &lt;a href=\"Reporting%20for%20Duty\"&gt;Reporting for Duty&lt;/a&gt;. \nAfter this test concludes, the player is tasked with returning the F-160 Raiju to the Fort Zancudo Hangar. However, Merryweather agents suddenly appear on the radar in &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzards Attack Choppers&lt;/a&gt;, determined to ruin the contract that was poached from them. The player is then tasked with eliminating them. As the player fends off more of their agents, additional reinforcements will arrive in Buzzard Attack Choppers followed by &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt;s before culminating in one or two &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avengers&lt;/a&gt; depending on the mission's selected difficulty.\nOnce the player has defeated all Merryweather aircraft, Charlie instructs them to return the F-160 Raiju to Fort Zancudo while he thinks of a way to make the client believe this incident was intended all along, concluding the mission."}

Only one of these containers is carrying the slot machines and it must be found, its code texted to the player by Agatha. The code itself is not always the same, but it is always two letters and two numbers. The area is being patrolled by numerous &lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Cartel\"&gt;Madrazo Cartel&lt;/a&gt; enemies on foot, a few standing on high stacked containers with sniper rifles and long cones of visibility, and in two &lt;a href=\"Caracara\"&gt;Caracara&lt;/a&gt;s; the vehicles cannot be used by the player. The player can choose to complete this portion of the mission stealthily from the air, as long as they keep out of the cones of the snipers.\nOnce the player can see a container's code, its icon will disappear from the map if it is an incorrect one. When the casino's shipment is found, its map icon will turn green and the player is instructed to take a photo of the code printed on it and send it to Agatha for confirmation, of whom the game will auto scroll down their phone's contact list for selection. She will call the protagonist back to inform them that the delivery helicopter was apparently sabotaged ahead of time by the cartel, but they should have one of their own nearby in preparation for taking the container themselves.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Skylift\"&gt;Skylift&lt;/a&gt; is marked at the southwest part of Terminal and is guarded by four enemies - if enemies have not been alerted to this point. Confronting them however will aggro at least most of the cartel members nearest to the player. A player confident in their flying skills may wish to try to collect the container while under fire and quickly fly away, while others may find killing the attackers to be more prudent.\nOnce the player steals the helicopter, they must collect the container by descending down onto it until the Skylift's electromagnet can pick it up and deliver it to the roadside parking area on &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Park%20Drive\"&gt;Vinewood Park Drive&lt;/a&gt; in front of the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Racetrack\"&gt;Vinewood Racetrack&lt;/a&gt;. All that is needed is to release the shipping container from the magnet, once prompted within a certain minimum height above the delivery corona to end the mission.\nHidden Texts.\nRather than sending the photo to Ms. Baker, the player can send it to a select few other contacts to receive a reply unique to each of the characters:"}

Kenji's second mission strand was entirely scrapped (with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Escort%20Service\"&gt;Escort Service&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Decoy\"&gt;Decoy&lt;/a&gt;, also adapted for Donald Love), rendering Kenji as an optional/missable mission boss in the final version.\n\"One of the gang\" was a mission intended to be unlocked after retrieving counterfeit plates stolen by &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Miguel\"&gt;Miguel&lt;/a&gt; in Toshiro's mission &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Aero\"&gt;Grand Theft Aero&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 in the final game adapted for Donald Love's mysterious package being stolen instead.\nOne of the gang.\nAfter liberating the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Oriental%20Gentleman\"&gt;Old Oriental Gentleman&lt;/a&gt; (originally a Yakuza plate engraver in the early script) and retrieving the stolen counterfeit plates from &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt;, Toshiro contacts &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; telling him to pick him up and drive him to &lt;a href=\"Kenji%27s%20Casino\"&gt;Kenji's Casino&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate the completion of the counterfeit operation.\nAccording to the mission flowchart available in the Design Document, Toshiro was meant to be found betting at an illegal fight at an underground parking lot, where the player would have the opportunity to bet on a fighter, a gambling feature never implemented in the final game.\nAfter watching the fight, Claude would drive Toshiro to Kenji's Casino, where the party is being held at the terrace garden. During the party, the Yakuza members are attacked from a nearby rooftop and Toshiro is killed by a sniper. The player was meant to collect a &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Sniper Rifle&lt;/a&gt; an eliminate the sniper while the others are taking cover.\nFollowing this event, Kenji replaces Toshiro as the new leader of the Yakuza, and inherits Toshiro's counterfeit operation.\nLeftovers.\nUnlike other missions given by Toshiro (&lt;a href=\"A%20Drop%20in%20the%20Ocean\"&gt;A Drop in the Ocean&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Aero\"&gt;Grand Theft Aero&lt;/a&gt;), the mission \"One of the gang\" was never rewritten for any other existing mission boss in the game after Donald Love's addition to the storyline. However, some of the locations used in the mission can be identified in-game.\nUnderground Parking Lot Location.\nThe mission flowchart in the Design Document mentions that the illegal fight took place at an underground parking lot. In the final game, there are two underground parking lots in southern Staunton Island, in close proximity to Kenji's Casino.\nThe first underground parking lot is located in &lt;a href=\"Bedford%20Point\"&gt;Bedford Point&lt;/a&gt;, near the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree%20Offices\"&gt;Liberty Tree Offices&lt;/a&gt;. The second underground parking lot is located in the &lt;a href=\"AMCo.%20Headquarters\"&gt;AMCo. Headquarters&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Torrington\"&gt;Torrington&lt;/a&gt;, where a &lt;a href=\"Yakuza%20Stinger\"&gt;Yakuza Stinger&lt;/a&gt; is always defined to spawn. The fact that Torrington is a territory controlled by the Yakuza makes the location more likely to have been used for the mission.\nSniper Building.\nAccording to the mission flowchart in the Design Document, the mission ended at Kenji's Casino terrace with the player being tasked to identify a sniper in a nearby building.\nThe most suitable location for the sniper's original location is an unnamed and detailed building across the street from the casino, used in the final game in the mission &lt;a href=\"Under%20Surveillance\"&gt;Under Surveillance&lt;/a&gt;. As its model file name \"codice_1\" suggests, this building was designed specifically for enemy snipers placements in missions."}

It also supports several other &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt; titles, including ', ' and \"\".\nDescription.\nOpenIV is a closed-source application allowing user to browse, extract and modify game files in several \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" titles.\nThe latest official release is version 4.1.0, which released on January 18, 2022. The software and all of its features are available to use for free. Development is largely funded by donations on OpenIV's &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.patreon.com/OpenIV\"&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt; as well as via PayPal.\nHistory.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIt was first released in August 2008 with support for the then-newly released \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" for &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt;. The very first modification using the software was a &lt;a href=\"SuperGT\"&gt;SuperGT&lt;/a&gt; with edited handling, showing OpenIV's ability to browse \"GTA IV\" disc image files and edit data files.\nOpenIV was formed under the \"RAGE research project\", code named \"codice_1\". The main goal was to research into file formats used by the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Advanced%20Game%20Engine\"&gt;Rockstar Advanced Game Engine&lt;/a&gt; (RAGE), many of which were developed and used by &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt; themselves.\nIn November 2008, the software received a version 0.6 update, showcasing a new UI layout and design which is still largely used to this day. The ability to browse \"GTA IV\" texture dictionary files (codice_2) was also introduced. \nIn April 2009, a \"Liberty Eye\" tool was introduced. This added the ability to roam around &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; within the software, rendering the game's environment models and textures. Support for the PC version of \"GTA IV\" was also introduced later in the same year. \nIn February 2011, \"OpenFormats\" was added in the 0.9.1 update. OpenFormats allowed several game file types to be exported and reimported to an OpenFormats file format (such as \"codice_3\" for codice_4 and codice_5 texture dictionary files). The update also added the \"Select game\" menu, supporting \"\" alongside \"GTA IV\".\nBy February 2012, OpenIV allows animation files to be rendered. An improved audio file player was also added, allowing codice_6 files (audio wave container) to be played through. Later that year, the second major version of software, 1.0, was released, and included support for \"Max Payne 3\". The 1.0 version included the addition of an \"edit mode\" which enabled the ability to edit game files (including adding, replacing and deleting files or their contents).\nIn 2013, the package installer was introduced, allowing file replacement and additions to be installed with a single click. The package installer includes a metadata file in codice_7 format which lists file paths to be replaced or added, alongside a zip file with the new files themselves. A title and short description of the modification package can also be added. An improved texture file browser and editor was also implemented in the same year; the ability to add, replace and delete textures was massively improved and supports numerous levels of texture compression, and the generation of mipmaps was included.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\": PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.\nOn September 17, 2013, OpenIV published a video showcasing the \"first look\" of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\"s files, the very day the game was released for the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt;. Although the tool did not, at the time, officially support the title, many of the game's file formats were shared with previous titles, allowing them to be browsed and opened.\nBy May 2014, OpenIV had released support for \"GTA V\" in the second major version, 2.0. The update supported browsing of the file structure and opening and previewing several game formats shared with \"GTA IV\", including drawable objects (such as environment/structures, weapons and static props), drawable dictionaries (such as pedestrians) and all basic xml, meta and data files. The following month, updates to open and preview fragment objects, such as vehicles and props, was implemented. \nIn April 2015, a 2.5 update supporting the &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; version of \"GTA V\" was released. The following month, the 2.6 update added support for editing codice_8 packages and viewing some of the PC \"GTA V\" model files, including drawable, collisions and navmesh support.\n\"GTA V\": Mods folder.\nIn June 2015, the 2.6.4 update added the ability to create and utilise a \"mods\" folder for \"GTA V\". The mods folder allows users to copy base \"GTA V\" folders and archives over and make changes to them, without affecting the base game installation. The mods folder can be disabled or deleted at any time without corrupting the game file integrity. The \"mods\" folder requires the appended codice_9 file to work. The folder appears as a purple folder within the \"Grand Theft Auto V\" main directory. As of the later 2.7 update, when in edit mode, a banner will appear at the top of archives prompting the user to copy the archive over to the mods folder to prevent making changes to base game files. The 2.6.4 update also added the ability to play back sounds within audio codice_10 files, as well as exporting and reimporting them using the openFormats feature.\nThroughout 2016, various smaller updates brought new features and improvements to existing features. OpenIV 2.8 brought the ability to export certain drawable model files and edit them in .\nLiberty City in \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn November 2016, OpenIV teased an upcoming &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;-themed modification. Two months later in January 2017, a \"Liberty City in \"Grand Theft Auto V\"\" teaser trailer was released by OpenIV on YouTube, teasing a full-scale conversion of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\"s Liberty City to \"GTA V\". Several weeks later, 13 screenshots depicting the city in the alpha version of the mod were released.\nTools.\nList of tools available in OpenIV 4.1.0.\nControversy &amp; Legal Issues.\nIn May 2017, OpenIV's lead developer \"GooD-NTS\" received an email from the legal counsel for Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar Games' parent company, requesting that work and distribution of OpenIV, and in particular their \"&lt;a href=\"OpenIV%23Liberty_City_in_Grand_Theft_Auto_V\"&gt;Liberty City in \"GTA V\"&lt;/a&gt;\" project, was to be halted immediately. In belief that he had not violated any laws, he responded, asking T2 to provide more details regarding their take-down request.\nOn June 5, 2017, over 2 weeks after the initial request email, the OpenIV team received an official cease and desist notice from &lt;a href=\"Take-Two%20Interactive\"&gt;Take-Two Interactive&lt;/a&gt;. The lead developer of OpenIV claimed that Take-Two had been notified that the software allowed third-parties (i.e., \"GTA\" fans and modders) to modify the game, breaching the game's security features (such as file encryption).\nOn June 14, 2017, OpenIV made the difficult decision to stop further updates and take down the software from their website. The website remained live, and a post regarding the decision was also made. Attempting to download the software would redirect users to the \"GTA Forums\" statement from lead developer \"GooD-NTS\". Several days later, the download button was removed entirely.\nOn June 20, 2017, several weeks after the C&amp;D notice, Rockstar Games made a statement:\nRockstar had also contacted the developers of OpenIV, in an effort to resolve the then-ongoing dispute. The details of the exchange are unknown\nOn June 23, 2017, just 3 days after Rockstar Games' initial statement, a \"PC Single-Player Mods\" statement was published by Rockstar Support. \nOn the same day, OpenIV was made available to download once again, and received an update (version 2.9.0, build 907). The update added a notice regarding using mods in \"GTA Online\" when users attempt to edit base game files without using a \"mods\" folder. \nImpact.\nThe dispute between OpenIV and Take-Two Interactive, dubbed \"T2 vs modding\" by much of the \"GTA\" modding fanbase, lead to outrage amongst the community. Users took to , where they hit \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" with . The review-bombing reduced \"GTA V\"s overall rating from \"positive\" to \"mixed\", the lowest rating any Rockstar Games game had received. Other review sites saw the game drop to an \"overwhelmingly negative\" rating.\nA \"Save OpenIV\" petition was set up at on June 14, 2017, by \"t0y is cool\", in efforts to encourage Take-Two to reevaluate their decision. The petition received over 50,000 signatures in just 5 days. By June 23, 2017, it had surpassed 75,000 signatures.\n\"GTA Forums\", the largest \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series forum, provided comment following the software's closure, expressing that \"\"there is a bigger picture to see\" regarding the impact this causes, and that \"single-player modders and machinima creators [are] losing out the most.\"\"\nOpenIV.com.\nOpenIV can be downloaded for free at &lt;a href=\"http%3A//openiv.com/\"&gt;openiv.com&lt;/a&gt;. Posts regarding updates to the software are made frequently, typically accompanied with videos posted on the OpenIV Team's &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/%40Openiv\"&gt;YouTube account&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn late March 2023, OpenIV's website went offline. On April 1, 2023, OpenIV team posted an update on Twitter, claiming they were working on restoring their server. Service was later restored on August 5, 2023."}

At each, walk into the marker and reply positively when the trainer asks if CJ wants to learn some new moves. The training takes a tutorial-type approach, with tips on-screen to tell the player how to execute the moves and when. Carl must defeat the trainer to learn the new moves. Each teaches the player a new Running Attack, Ground Attack, and Combo Attack.\nIf the player forfeits a sparring match at any gym, they will lose all weapons they are carrying and will be unable to recover them. This is more likely to happen at the Cobra Marital Arts Gym, where the player simply has to step off the floor mat to end the match.\nLearning all fighting styles is required to complete &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;100% Completiton&lt;/a&gt;.\nOversights.\nThere is a glitch that prevents the player from using any equipment, where the game notifies them that they have trained enough, even if they haven't exercised at all after a lengthy period of time. It may be caused by any of the following:\nMadd Dogg's Mansion.\nThe glitch occurs most commonly by saving at Madd Dogg's mansion. It is unknown what exactly triggers this glitch, but it can be attributed to the existence of gym equipment in the mansion, making the game treat it as a gym.\nQuick Saving.\nThe glitch has also been found to happen if saving in two different slots, in a very short time. For example: Slot one save time is 16:13, and slot number five is 16:18, then nine times out of ten, the glitch will occur.\nNew Year's Eve Glitch.\nIt has been recently discovered that the glitch can also occur if CJ reaches his limit on December 31 (in-game time; the game actually tracks days and months of the year, but this is never used in actual gameplay). In this case, CJ will be unable to work out indefinitely.\nThe reason this occurs is because when CJ reaches his limit on a particular day, he is not allowed to work out until the next day. Since the game does not track years, there is no such day that exists after December 31, as the game's internal calendar rolls back to January 1 after December 31.\nTheoretically, the probability of this glitch occurring when CJ reaches his limit is 0.3%."}

The song is later included in the \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" official soundtrack as part of the &lt;a href=\"Endings%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;story finale&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href=\"The%20Journey\"&gt;The Journey&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Stations%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;radio station&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe HD Universe officially started out in April 2008 with the release of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\". The game was followed by \"\", featuring two episodic content packs \u2013 \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\" \u2013 both of which occur at the same time as \"GTA IV\".\nIn 2009, Rockstar Games released \"\", a &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20DS\"&gt;Nintendo DS&lt;/a&gt; handheld title set one year after \"GTA IV\", set in a full 3D cel-shaded 2009's Liberty City in isometric 3D perspective and featuring comic-style cutscenes.\nThe generation was known as the \"GTA IV\" era until the announcement of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" in 2011, which officially revealed that games within the series are set in different universes based on their graphics (2D, 3D and HD), contrary to the previous belief that each numbered title started a new era. \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" was released two weeks after \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and it is currently the latest entry in the series.\nNew Lore and Canonical Changes.\nWith the HD Universe reboot of the series, previous in-game branding (e.g. Sprunk, Majestic Hotel, 24/7, etc.) and media celebrities (e.g. OG Loc, Lazlow, other radio DJs, etc.) are kept in the new lore as complete different characters with complete different backstories (Lazlow born in the Midwest and Lazlow born in Upstate Liberty, for example), and major characters from the previous world are simply wiped out from existence, only referenced via story-unrelated &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Eggs\"&gt;Easter Eggs&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe three major settings (Liberty City, San Andreas and Vice City) are once again recreated as part of the series' tradition, now completely rebooted with different historical events, making previous 3D Universe events impossible to have happened in the current canon (e.g. the &lt;a href=\"Harwood%20Incident\"&gt;Harwood Incident&lt;/a&gt;, as Harwood has never existed in Liberty City's history).\nSimilar events referencing the previous world are mentioned to have happened, such as the Los Santos Riots, a factory explosion by the Triads and a weed farm burning in Flint County \u2013 all inspired by the events of the previous world but completely unrelated.\nSetting.\nThe HD Universe storyline is mainly set in the city of &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; (and the neighboring &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;State of Alderney&lt;/a&gt;), the southern part of the state of &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;, and the state of &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Leonida\"&gt;Leonida&lt;/a&gt;, all of which are located in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States of America&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis universe also includes the island of &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico\"&gt;Cayo Perico&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; and, briefly, the town of &lt;a href=\"Ludendorff\"&gt;Ludendorff&lt;/a&gt; in the state of &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20North%20Yankton\"&gt;North Yankton&lt;/a&gt;, located south from the Canadian border region of the United States of America.\nHD Universe counterparts of &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Red%20County%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Red County&lt;/a&gt; (including &lt;a href=\"Montgomery%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Montgomery&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Flint%20County%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Flint County&lt;/a&gt; are also mentioned to exist. However, these locations are yet to physically appear in the HD Universe titles.\nWidely detailed, its locations are much more similar to their real-life counterparts than those of the previous universes. Its protagonists are &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Huang%20Lee\"&gt;Huang Lee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Fernando Lopez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;\"GTA Online\" Protagonist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lucia\"&gt;Lucia&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20GTA%20VI%20male%20accomplice\"&gt;unnamed accomplice&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost of the games are set in their respective years of release, with exception of \"Episodes from Liberty City\" which crosses over with \"GTA IV\"s story in 2008, and the early \"GTA Online\" DLCs which were set shortly before the events of \"GTA V\" in 2013, until the release of .\nRelation with Other Rockstar North Series.\n\"Agent\" (Cancelled Project).\n\"Agent\" was a -inspired stealth action game being developed in tandem with \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" by Rockstar North, originally expected to release in 2010. The project was eventually cancelled.\nApart from sharing the exact same art style and assets used in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", leftovers from the \"Jimmy\" project (internal name of \"Agent\", a diminutive of James Bond's first name) found in the codice_1 file for \"&lt;a href=\"Max%20Payne\"&gt;Max Payne 3&lt;/a&gt;\" (developed as a Rockstar Studios collaboration) and sensitive leaked information and screenshots included in the 2022/2023 \"Grand Theft Auto V\" leaks reveal a list of vehicles shared between both \"GTA\" and \"Agent\" \u2013 including their shared names and design (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Dinghy%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Dinghy&lt;/a&gt;, returning from \"GTA IV\") \u2013 and other 1970s and pre-1970s vehicles made for \"Agent\" that would later debut in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"GTA Online\" (&lt;a href=\"Cuban%20800\"&gt;Cuban 800&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Casco\"&gt;Casco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Enduro\"&gt;Enduro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Winky\"&gt;Winky&lt;/a&gt;, etc).\nDespite the project being cancelled, there are multiple instances of \"Agent\" code and assets reused in \"Grand Theft Auto V\", and \"Agent\" mission themes are heavily implied in-game in certain missions.\nChronological Plot List.\nNote: Some of the \"GTA Online\" updates are simply focused on the multiplayer aspects of the game (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Races%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Races&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adversary%20Modes\"&gt;Adversary Modes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deathmatches%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Deathmatches&lt;/a&gt;) and story-unrelated Holiday cosmetic upgrades (i.e. yearly &lt;a href=\"Festive%20Surprise\"&gt;Festive Surprise&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Halloween%20Surprise\"&gt;Halloween Surprise&lt;/a&gt; content updates) and are not listed above, as they don't relate to the narrative of \"GTA Online\". Only the \"GTA Online\" Story DLCs are listed above, including Businesses, Contact Missions, Heists, and other story-related missions.\nThe only exception are the character-commented \"&lt;a href=\"Arena%20War\"&gt;Arena War&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Adversary%20Modes\"&gt;Adversary Modes&lt;/a&gt; introduced in \"GTA Online: Arena War\", depicting an in-universe destruction derby-like internet show.\nGames in the HD Universe.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" (released in &lt;a href=\"2008\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;) is set in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; in 2008. It was the first \"GTA\" game to be released simultaneously for the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; consoles, and was released on 29 April 2008. In August 2008, Rockstar announced that a &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; version of \"GTA IV\" would be released later in the year, and the PC version was released on 3 December 2008.

The game takes place in a redesigned Liberty City, which bears a much closer resemblance to New York City than its 3D counterparts. The &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, a 30-year-old Yugoslavian war veteran.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto: The Lost and Damned\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\" (released in &lt;a href=\"2009\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;) is the first of the two episodes for \"GTA IV\". The DLC version of TLAD requires the original \"GTA IV\" to play and is also available on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC. It is included in \"Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City\", which does not require \"GTA IV\". TLAD's storyline runs alongside the main \"GTA IV\" storyline and ties in with the main story on a number of occasions. The protagonist is &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;, the 34-year-old Vice President of the Alderney Chapter of &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost Motorcycle Club&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: The Ballad of Gay Tony\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony\"&gt;The Ballad of Gay Tony&lt;/a&gt;\" (released in &lt;a href=\"2009\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;) is the second episode released for \"GTA IV\". Like TLAD, the DLC version requires the original \"GTA IV\" to play, but it is also included in the standalone Episodes From Liberty City. TBoGT's storyline also ties in with both the main GTA IV storyline and TLaD's storyline. The protagonist is &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Fernando Lopez&lt;/a&gt;, the 25-year-old personal bodyguard of nightclub impresario &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis is the final game of the \"GTA IV\" trilogy.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\n\"\" (released in &lt;a href=\"2009\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;) is set in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; in the year 2009. It is the first \"Grand Theft Auto\" game to be released on the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20DS\"&gt;Nintendo DS&lt;/a&gt;, and was announced at the E3 Nintendo Press Conference on July 15, 2008. This game has several new features, such as touch screen mini-games. It is also available on the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%20Portable\"&gt;PSP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Apple%20iOS\"&gt;Apple iPhone/iPod Touch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Android%20OS\"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;. The PSP version features drastically improved graphics.\nThe game focuses on the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City Triads&lt;/a&gt;, and protagonist &lt;a href=\"Huang%20Lee\"&gt;Huang Lee&lt;/a&gt;, the 26-year-old nephew of &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Family\"&gt;Lee Family&lt;/a&gt; head &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Lee\"&gt;Wu \"Kenny\" Lee&lt;/a&gt;. The State of Alderney is absent from the game due to lack of Triad presence in the state, making it irrelevant to the storyline.\nThe game is set one year after all of the events seen in \"GTA IV\" and \"Episodes from Liberty City\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" (released in &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;) is set in southern &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;. It is the first game in the HD Universe not to be set in Liberty City. For the first time in a single \"Grand Theft Auto\" game, \"Grand Theft Auto V\" features three protagonists: &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;. \"GTA V\" was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on 17 September 2013.

An expanded and enhanced version was released for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on 15 March 2022.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" (released in &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;) is set in southern &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; in the United States and the island of &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico\"&gt;Cayo Perico&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;. The game's storyline originally took place several months before the \"Grand Theft Auto V\" storyline. However, as the &lt;a href=\"Updates%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;game released updates&lt;/a&gt;, the game's setting advanced in real-life timing, with characters later mentioning past events that took place in \"GTA V\".\nThe game is included on the original retail versions of \"GTA V\" and was released on 1 October 2013, two weeks after \"GTA V\" however, it can purchased separately as of &lt;a href=\"2022\"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;. For the first time in the series, \"GTA Online\" allows the player to create their own playable &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;GTA IV's multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;, \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" is considered a standalone title by Rockstar Games and is treated as such.\n\"Grand Theft Auto VI\".\nExpected to be part of the HD Universe, \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20VI\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto VI&lt;/a&gt;\" is set in several counties in the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Leonida\"&gt;State of Leonida&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Vice-Dale%20County\"&gt;Vice-Dale County&lt;/a&gt; (home to the neon-soaked streets of &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;). The game features two protagonists: &lt;a href=\"Lucia\"&gt;Lucia&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20GTA%20VI%20male%20accomplice\"&gt;unnamed male accomplice&lt;/a&gt;. \"GTA VI\" is scheduled to release in 2025 for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S."}

Although its siren is no longer effective in prompting oncoming vehicles to move out of the way, its compact motorcycle design allows it to navigate around traffic far better than full-sized cars.\nOverall, the HPV-1000 is a well balanced vehicle to use, as well as one of the few bikes available from the start of the game.\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\nThe HPV-1000 makes an important appearance in \"&lt;a href=\"Cop%20Wheels\"&gt;Cop Wheels&lt;/a&gt;\", in where &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt; needs to steal four HPV-1000s in various places around &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Breaking%20the%20Bank%20at%20Caligula%27s\"&gt;heist&lt;/a&gt; and needs to deliver it to a moving &lt;a href=\"Packer\"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt;. During the mission, no HPV-1000 appear in traffic, forcing CJ to jack the scripted bikes. HPV-1000s also appear in the mission &lt;a href=\"Reuniting%20the%20Families\"&gt;Reuniting the Families&lt;/a&gt;, chasing the gang's &lt;a href=\"Greenwood%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Greenwood|car&lt;/a&gt;. In the mission \"&lt;a href=\"Small%20Town%20Bank\"&gt;Small Town Bank&lt;/a&gt;\" CJ and &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt; flee from the bikes, but use them afterwards to reach the hideout."}

The headlights are derived from the . Unlike the RX, the rear license plate is mounted on the rear bumper, rather than the tailgate. The tail light shape is identical to the RX, but they feature red and amber lenses rather than the RX's clear ones, possibly inspired by the and .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Habanero assumes a rather long body with ample room for four occupants, where the front bumper features a wide open intake and a flat section on the center intended for the license plate, while the upper area houses a silver chrome grille with numerous horizontal dividers and the manufacturer emblem. The sections beside the grille house large silver housings with black trimming around, each one having dual circular main lamps on the upper side and rectangle-shaped turning signals below. The bonnet area features a slightly bulged profile starting from around the grille and curves towards either side of the windscreen.\nThe sides of the car are defined by the protruding arches, the bottom steps and the rectangular details on the doors, as well as the body lines starting from beside each headlight and going towards the outermost side of the tail lights, passing between the silver/chrome horizontal handles and the cabin windows. The same cabin makes use of black trim around each window pane and colored rear-view mirror wings near the A-pillars, while the roof area features black lines separating the panel from the rest of the car, a single aerial on the back section and a roof spoiler above the rear window. Silver \"HABANERO\" badges can be seen over the rectangular details of the front doors.\nThe rear of the car is predominated by the large compartment door, having a black panel below the window that bears the manufacturer emblem on the center, and silver lettering on the lower corners that display the names of the car and the manufacturer. The car uses sectioned tail lights beside the aforementioned black panel, with the outer ones having upper brake lights and lower turn signals and the inner ones the main red lights and lower reverse lights, placed directly at the rear compartment door. The bumper also has a flat central section for the license plate, while the area below it houses a black section with a wide meshed vent on the center and two circular exhaust pipes on the outer portions. The interior of the vehicle is shared with the &lt;a href=\"DF8-90\"&gt;DF8-90&lt;/a&gt;, retaining the &lt;a href=\"Imponte\"&gt;Imponte&lt;/a&gt; badges on the head rests, floor mats, and steering wheel.\nThe vehicle spawns in a variety of single-tone colors for the body and uses large 5-spoke wheels, fitted with medium-profile tires.\nThe Habanero is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; system with a male voice, but only if the player leaves the \"selected cars\" (default) option in the audio menu.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Habanero assumes the same design as in \"GTA IV\", but the on the rear quarter window has been straightened out. It also gains a mesh pattern on the front bumper intake (in a similar manner to the rear bumper), and has fewer separations on the grille, allowing the player to see the radiator. In the enhanced version, the car uses the same \"Feroci\" interior as vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Ingot\"&gt;Ingot&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Serrano\"&gt;Serrano&lt;/a&gt;.\nAgain, the car spawns in a variety of single-tone colors for the body, as well as the stitches of the interior. It also retains the same wheel design as before, being identical to the \"Bippu\" SUV wheels available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nBorrowing its specifications from the Lexus RX, the Habanero focuses more on stability and luxury rather than performance, leaving acceleration below average, with a decent top speed. Although it sports an AWD configuration, off-roading in this vehicle leaves much to be desired, as sliding and spin-outs are common, and the ground clearance is minimal at best. Braking is below average, due in part to constant front wheel lockup. Handling at high speeds is fair, though the suspension does not perform as well as what would be expected. At slow speeds, it is far too soft leading to body roll, while at high speeds it is far too firm and unforgiving. Its durability also has much to be desired from a vehicle of its size, and the engine will begin smoking after about three to five severe frontal crashes. With this said, the Habanero is one of the least desirable vehicles to drive in \"GTA IV\". It lacks the durability of trucks and certain other SUVs, as well as the speed of any sedan or two-door.\nThe Habanero is powered by a numb-feeling Inline-4 with a modeled Turbocharger, paired to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, all wheel drive configuration (50% front, 50% rear). It shares the mid-revving and smooth engine sound with vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Landstalker\"&gt;Landstalker&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rebla\"&gt;Rebla&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nAgain, the Habanero performs the same as in \"GTA IV\", having almost the same performance. Top speed and handling is slightly increased, but it is still outclassed by most AWD vehicles and resistance is the same. The vehicle has a tendency to lift the inside wheels under high speed cornering.\nThe player may notice that the Habanero is fitted with a modeled Turbocharger by default (similar to vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Seminole\"&gt;Seminole&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Huntley%20S\"&gt;Huntley S&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dubsta%206x6\"&gt;Dubsta 6x6&lt;/a&gt;), paired to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, all wheel drive configuration (40% front, 60% rear). It also has a mid-revving engine sound with an apparent supercharged whine, also shared with the &lt;a href=\"Issi\"&gt;Issi&lt;/a&gt;."}

An interface is presented and the player must navigate to their \"external device\".\nThere are multiple hacking minigames depending on the device being hacked:\nHackConnect.exe.\nEstablishes a connection \u2013 consists of matching an octet of numbers from a constantly horizontally scrolling 8x10 grid of numbers (presumably intended to represent the IP address of the &lt;a href=\"Computers\"&gt;computer&lt;/a&gt;).\nBruteForce.exe.\nA password cracker \u2013 consists of 8 vertically scrolling letters with a single highlighted red letter in each column. Stopping each column on its highlighted letter reveals the password of the computer. When using BruteForce, several eight-letter words are used for passwords. Some of them are sexual references made by &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar&lt;/a&gt;. Examples are:\nDown&amp;Out.exe.\nRuns &lt;a href=\"Down%20%26amp%3B%20Out\"&gt;Down &amp; Out&lt;/a&gt; Backup and Erase software. Non interactive, presumably just downloads the information.\nEach of the above applications has a time limit to be successfully completed. Failure to complete each step within the allocated time will either result in failure or a return to the beginning of the process.\nTraffic Light Control.\nIn the \"Subtle approach\" of &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;The Big Score&lt;/a&gt;, the player has to hack &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Transport%20Traffic%20Control%20System\"&gt;Los Santos Transport Traffic Control System&lt;/a&gt; to switch traffic lights for the &lt;a href=\"Securicar\"&gt;Stockade&lt;/a&gt; drivers. The player also has to watch out for &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt;, which also appears in the scene. It depends on the hacker how good the connection is, there is lag varying through none, 2 and 4 seconds.\nVLSI Circuit Breaker 2.0.\nCircuit Breaker 2.0 is a hacking minigame written by Lester Crest and is used in the &lt;a href=\"Fleeca%20Job\"&gt;Fleeca Job&lt;/a&gt; Heist. It is a smartphone app which pops up taking most of the screen. The game consists of 2D top-down maze that looks like a circutboard. The player must guide a constantly moving line from a start point to an end point. If it touches anything but the exit it fails and has to be restarted. There are 3 levels with each one increasing the difficulty of the maze. Continued failure slows down the speed of the point but reduces the achievement level. It is recommended to use the D-Pad rather than the analog stick. After successfully hacking the system a pixelated face of Lester appears and bounces around and you can hear a laughing sound. After getting to the bank the player triggers the unlock by activating it with their phone.\nData Crack.\nA data cracker in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", used to hack the garage door at &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Labs%20and%20Research\"&gt;Humane Labs&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Online\". It consists of 8 white blocks moving vertically over a horizontal red line in the center. To hack it, the player has to align a gap in the blocks when they are placed exactly over the red line. Each block moves progressively faster and any mistake will displace the previous one, and require these to be placed again. This minigame is also featured in certain &lt;a href=\"Freemode\"&gt;Freemode&lt;/a&gt; events such as &lt;a href=\"Sightseer\"&gt;Sightseer&lt;/a&gt; as of the update.\nServer hack.\nThis hack needs to be completed four times during . The player has four attempts and 4:00 minutes to connect 4 nodes on one side, to 4 nodes on the other side using lines. The hack can only be completed by trial and error, as there are no hints as to which nodes should be connected. However after confirming, any correct connections will persist, leaving less possibilities for any remaining connections. There are \"P(4,2)\"=12 possible combinations to start with, however after guessing one of the four correctly, this is down to 6, then down to 2 for two remaining connections.\nMotherboard hack.\nThis hack is encountered during the &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Scenario\"&gt;the Act 3 finale of the Doomsday Heist&lt;/a&gt;. It is an adaptation of a lazer puzzle game. The player has to guide a lazer beam on a motherboard maze using mirrors to burn through blue Packets, while avoiding red Firewalls. The hack has a timer of 5:00 minutes.\nThe motherboard is engraved with the text \"TOS PI Model X V1.35\", and also bears visual similarity to the .\nCasino Hacking Minigames.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Heist\"&gt;finale&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20Heist\"&gt;The Diamond Casino Heist&lt;/a&gt;, the protagonists may need to hack into systems, such as doors and elevators. There are two minigames for these hacks; the first is a memory game where the player must memorize a pattern of six dots along six columns of five dots. The second requires the user to use a large image of a fingerprint to find which of four smaller scans (out of a series of eight) are part of it.\nVOLTlab.\nTo hack this software, the player needs to connect the numbers on the left side of the screen to the modifiers on the right so that the number at the top, i.e. Target Voltage, matches with the number on the counter at the bottom, i.e. the Result. Each modifier multiplies the number with a multiplier of one, two, or ten. All multiplication results add up together and give the final result.\nPrint Cloner VR1.0.\nWhile at a fingerprint scanner, the software will show the fragments from the previous scans; the player just has to cycle through each of them to match the target fingerprint.\nOnce the arranged components match with the target fingerprint, the system automatically processes and bypasses the target lock, and a message stating \"Clone match\" is seen on the screen.\nHeist Hackers.\nHackers are also employed as &lt;a href=\"Heist%20Crew%20Members%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;crew members&lt;/a&gt; in Story Mode &lt;a href=\"Heists\"&gt;Heists&lt;/a&gt; but there is no player controlled interaction of their role until\u00a0the subtle option of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;The Big Score&lt;/a&gt;, when there is a unique hacking program that makes the player take control of traffic lights.\nMissions Involving Hacking.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nFreemode Event\nFreemode missions"}

They are the main rivals of the &lt;a href=\"Cubans\"&gt;Cubans&lt;/a&gt;, and they vie for control of the poorer neighborhoods of &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Little%20Haiti%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Little Haiti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Little%20Havana%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Little Havana&lt;/a&gt;).\nDescription.\nThe gang is exclusively composed of Haitian immigrants/descendants, and are mainly active in the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Mainland\"&gt;Vice City Mainland&lt;/a&gt;, with their home turf being Little Haiti. Prior to the mission &lt;a href=\"Trojan%20Voodoo\"&gt;Trojan Voodoo&lt;/a&gt;, they will also spawn in Little Havana, often engaging the rival &lt;a href=\"Cubans\"&gt;Cubans&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cuban-Haitian%20Gang%20War\"&gt;gun fights&lt;/a&gt; which leave casualties on both sides.\nThe Haitians are primarily involved in minor street crime, such as robbery, gun crime, and petty theft, but seem to have larger ambitions, as they appear to be engaging in both arms and narcotics trafficking. By &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;, the Haitians are operating a &lt;a href=\"Haitian%20Drugs%20Factory\"&gt;large drug manufacturing plant&lt;/a&gt; out of the ghettos of Little Haiti. The gang is unique in their practice of a corrupted form of , where it is implied they curse their enemies, as well as speaking in , , and English in heavy Haitian accents.\n&lt;a href=\"Auntie%20Poulet\"&gt;Auntie Poulet&lt;/a&gt;, the leader, gives &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt; mysterious mind-altering drugs to make him use less-than-honest tactics in their war against the Cubans. Vercetti spurred by his friendship with the Cubans, massacres members of the Haitian gang and &lt;a href=\"Trojan%20Voodoo\"&gt;completely destroys&lt;/a&gt; their drugs factory (killing many more members in the process), thereby severing all ties with Poulet and the gang. After this, the Haitians become openly hostile to Vercetti and later his &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Gang\"&gt;gang members&lt;/a&gt;. The Haitians do not appear (nor are mentioned) in \"\", meaning that they became active in the city sometime between &lt;a href=\"1984\"&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;.\nHaitian gang members are seen wearing either blue shirts (reading RELAX), white pants and baseball caps, silver sunglasses, or light purple sleeveless shirts, jeans and blue bandanas.\nTheir favorite radio stations are &lt;a href=\"Flash%20FM\"&gt;Flash FM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fever%20105\"&gt;Fever 105&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\nThe Haitians are loosely inspired by the\u00a0, an active Haitian gang that primarily operates in Miami; both gangs (in-game and real life) practice , though the Zoe Pound did not form until 1992.\nThe outfit worn by Haitian gang members is another of \"GTA Vice City\"s numerous references to the TV series \"\". Their clothes are based on a prominent extra seen in the show's , in the scene where first arrives at . The clothing worn by the Haitian's rivals, the &lt;a href=\"Cubans\"&gt;Cubans&lt;/a&gt;, is based on another extra walking alongside the first.\nThe \"RELAX\" t-shirt might be also a reference to 1983 song \"\" by the English band , who were also known for their sloganed t-shirts. The song was later featured in \"GTA Vice City Stories\" on the &lt;a href=\"Wave%20103\"&gt;Wave 103&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0radio station.\nHaitian-American Discrimination Controversy.\nThe third version of \"GTA Vice City\" had all references to the Haitian people removed, (along with a number of other trademarks), in response to Cuban and Haitian groups in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, who threatened to use action against &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt;, on the basis that they were being discriminated against. A Haitian organization in the US against racism was highly offended by the comments used in the game, such as when Vercetti is ordered to \"shoot the Haitian dickheads\" along with the highly-inflammatory mission objective \"KILL ALL THE HAITIANS!!\". Because of this, the word \"Haitians\" was replaced with \"gangsters\" in the game's subtitles in subsequent releases.\nIt is very likely that the Haitians were replaced with the Mexican &lt;a href=\"Cholos\"&gt;Cholos&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Vice City Stories\" due to the racial controversies stated above, considering the Cubans were renamed as Los Cabrones. This creates a minor anomaly as Little Haiti retains its original name but with no Haitians present.\nThere was another centering around Auntie Poulet; however, this centered purely around her imagery being too similar to that of Miss Cleo, an American TV psychic persona (which is ironic, as the real life Miss Cleo voiced Auntie Poulet).\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Steam\"&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt; re-release of the game, all original dialogue and gameplay is retained."}

The portions beside the centre are occupied by thin vertical intakes next to the mudguards, triangular amber indicators and triangular mirror wings on top of the fairing. The area inside the fairing is mostly finished in carbon fibre and houses two analogue dials, while the upper clamp/plate holds two independent handlebars.\nOn the main body, the engine bay is mostly covered by the fairing, having an open frontal section, side exit vents, carbon-fibre upper surfaces and side markings displaying the bike's name, followed by a silver/chrome basic frame. The fuel tank is relatively large and has a circular cap on top, as well as side markings displaying the manufacturer name.\nThe rear area is occupied by a black seat with room for two occupants, a small red tail lamp on the rear end and a plate holder below, with the corresponding license plate and amber indicators. The rear wheel is connected to the rest of the bike by a dual-sided swing-arm finished in silver/chrome, having a single suspension spring and the corresponding chain drive and sprocket on the left. There are foot pegs for both occupants and silver/chrome exhaust tubes with carbon-fibre finish on the wide portions.\nThe bike is mostly painted with a primary colour on the front mudguard, fairing, mirror wings, fuel tank and rear section, while the secondary colour is applied on the frontal portion of the fairing, in the form of dual stripes on the sides, the lower fairing and the rims. It uses five-spoke dual rims and medium-profile tyres, with the rear one being wider.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Hakuchou returns with the same design as the \"Episodes from Liberty City\" rendition, albeit with updated light textures.

Even though files list the bike with either default alloy or red wheel colour, they are not applied on the rims at all due to the secondary paint, and will only be shown on custom rims. It also retains the same five-spoke dual rim design.\nPerformance.\n\"Episodes from Liberty City\".\nThe Hakuchou is a very well performing motorcycle with excellent speed and acceleration. The bike immediately gains speed thanks to its powerful engine, and good traction results in no loss of control when accelerating in a straight line. The bike leans very well thanks to its light weight, but tends to lose control when cornering at high speeds. The bike is also very good at \"drifting\", somewhat too much, causing the bike to lose control. Although the turning radius is quite high, it still manages to oversteer, and cornering into 2-lane roads often requires the player to slow the bike down significantly to avoid this oversteer.\nThe Hakuchou is stated by the &lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Riders\"&gt;Uptown Riders&lt;/a&gt; website to use a 1300cc (1.3L) engine pushing 200bph, yet the in-game model is not very clear to define. It sports a 5-speed gearbox and a high-revving engine, appearing to be a higher-pitched and heavily-edited variation of the one used on the &lt;a href=\"PCJ%20600\"&gt;PCJ-600&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Hakuchou is a power-house motorcycle with a beefy body shell that contains a strong, powerful engine. It is more powerful than the &lt;a href=\"Bati%20800\"&gt;Bati 801&lt;/a&gt;, and bears a longer wheelbase compared to other sport bikes. The bike can, however, be misleading for inexperienced drivers, as its steadiness and bulkiness implies superior crash resistance compared to other bikes, when in actual fact it is the same as some much lighter ones.\nWhile the Hakuchou's acceleration is unremarkable without upgrades, its top speed is one of the its most defining traits, being able to keep up with the &lt;a href=\"Akuma\"&gt;Akuma&lt;/a&gt; and outrun the &lt;a href=\"Bati%20801\"&gt;Bati 801&lt;/a&gt; on the straights. The Hakuchou's top speed can be boosted even further by its excellent ability to perform wheelies at top speed, increasing its already impressive velocity by a noticeable margin. The handling is, however, the Achilles' heel of this motorcycle, as its long wheelbase means that the Hakuchou possesses a wide turning circle and, when combined with its 250kg weight, leaves a lot to be desired in terms of response when turning. As such, the Hakuchou is a good choice for someone that values speed over handling, or for highway riding because of its straight line power.\nWhile one is able to go considerably faster than normal top speed while doing a wheelie, one can also push forward on the left thumb stick (controller), also known as \"Leaning Forward,\" which also greatly increases acceleration. However, while leaning forward on the Hakuchou, it is more difficult to make minor steering adjustments.\nAgain, the Hakuchou sports an engine whose model is not clear to define, and is coupled to a 6-speed gearbox. It uses the same engine sound as the &lt;a href=\"Akuma\"&gt;Akuma&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Double%20T\"&gt;Double T&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "20079", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=20079", "title": "Hakuchou Custom", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Shitzu\"&gt;Shitzu&lt;/a&gt; Hakuchou Drag (formerly named Hakuchou Custom) is a drag bike featured in the downloadable episodic pack \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20and%20Damned\"&gt;The Lost and Damned&lt;/a&gt;\", and added to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the update.\nDesign.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nThe Hakuchou Custom is a modified variant of the &lt;a href=\"Hakuchou\"&gt;Hakuchou&lt;/a&gt;, having shaved mirrors, short exhausts, custom chrome wheels and frame, and a stretched swing-arm. The rear plate holder, rear turn signals and passenger foot pegs are also removed.\nThe bike features a custom paintwork resembling stitched skin, which is actually a livery texture wrapping the entire vehicle (as files indicate it spawns in white and when taking it to a &lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;Pay 'n' Spray&lt;/a&gt;, white fumes come from the shop as if it was painted white). It also uses 3-spoke rims and are wrapped in medium-profile tyres, with the rear wheel having a bolted-on detail on the surrounding of the rim and a wider tyre.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nReturning to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the bike remains relatively the same, although the front mudguard is smaller, the exhaust tubes are finished in silver/chrome instead of titanium, and the rear swing-arm is extended even further, as well as having foot pegs for the passenger. The original livery is no longer present and uses a regular painted bodywork, but different liveries can be applied at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; or any other mod shop. Furthermore, it also has visual modifications not present on the regular Hakuchou. The bike uses the same \"Sports Bike\" dial set as the regular Hakuchou and various sports motorcycles.\nCompared to its previous iteration, as well as the regular Hakuchou, the bike is painted with a primary colour on the frontal portion of the fairing, most of the side fairing, the fuel tank and the rear section, while the secondary colour, is applied on the outer portions of the fairing, the lower fairing, the basic frame, the portion below the fuel tank and the swing-arm. The rims use a dedicated wheel colour, which can be painted by selecting a custom rear wheel, applying a colour and change back to the stock wheel (as it won't reset to the default alloy color). The rim design is the same as the regular Hakuchou, being five-spoke dual rims with medium-profile tyres, with the rear one being much wider than most regular sports bikes. In &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, one can find a rim design similar to the rear rim of the \"TLAD\" rendition, named \"Trident\".\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online/Editions\"&gt;Expanded &amp; Enhanced&lt;/a&gt; version, the bike is featured as one of the HSW performance-supported vehicles of &lt;a href=\"Hao%27s%20Special%20Works\"&gt;Hao's Special Works&lt;/a&gt;, and an HSW badge will appear on the upper plate when converted.\nPerformance.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nThe Hakuchou Custom is capable of reaching a high top speed and has similar, if not identical, handling to the regular Hakuchou. Be aware that this high amount of power makes it very sensitive to hard throttle, and prone to wheelspin.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Riders\"&gt;Uptown Riders&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Uptownriders.net\"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, the Hakuchou Custom is exclusively tuned for drag races with modifications, including a prepped up 1300cc engine producing around 250bhp, a lowered ride and a lighter front 330mm brake disc. The in-game model of the engine, however, is not very clear due to it being mostly covered by the fairing. It also has a 5-speed gearbox and uses the same engine sound as the regular Hakuchou, albeit with a slightly higher pitch.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe bike retains its tremendous speed, but suffers from understeer at high speeds. The bike has a top speed of 209 kph/129.9 mph while leaning forward without a passenger, and has excellent acceleration, going from 0 to 100 kph/62 mph in 2.2 seconds. It also has very good braking, going from full speed to a complete stop in 1.3 seconds. The suspension is relatively susceptible to bumps in the roads. Its handling and speed is vastly improved from its \"TLaD\" counterpart, though it cannot perform wheelies on a flat surface due to its extended swingarm. Furthermore, its back wheel is exposed to gunfire so it is highly advised that the player equips bulletproof tires if they plan to use it in freemode. The driver should softly accelerate the bike to avoid wheelspin so that they can maximise acceleration. All in all, it is proven to be a worthy competitor for races that can compete against other faster bikes.\nWhen given &lt;a href=\"Hao%27s%20Special%20Works\"&gt;HSW&lt;/a&gt; performance upgrades, the Hakuchou Drag can reach 260.5 kph/161.9 mph, and can accelerate from 0 to 100 kph/62 mph in 1.7 seconds.\nThe Hakuchou Drag is powered by an inline-4 engine, evidenced by the four exhaust pipes coming from the engine itself. It is coupled to a 6-speed gearbox and has a similar engine sound to the regular Hakuchou, the &lt;a href=\"Akuma\"&gt;Akuma&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Double%20T\"&gt;Double T&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with a slightly higher pitch.\nLocations.\n\"The Lost and Damned\".\nThe Hakuchou Custom is hard to find, as it does not appear commonly on the streets."}

{"id": "20664", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=20664", "title": "Hakumai", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Dinka\"&gt;Dinka&lt;/a&gt; Hakumai is a compact four-door sedan featured exclusively in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\".\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nWith Dinka being the in-game parody of Honda, the Hakumai's exterior is appropriately an amalgamation of different late-80s Hondas, mainly the , with elements from the , as seen in the lower roofline compared to the Accord, the C-pillar, and the rear bumper, and with aspects from the sedan version of the , mainly at the side profile. The rear bumper and additional elements may also be taken from the . The front bumper and the grille seem to be taken from the . The tail lights seem to be inspired by the ones found on the , albeit flipped upside down. The wheels of the Hakumai may have been modeled after the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIt is the only car in \"GTA IV\" to feature functioning hidden headlights, although there is no actual animation for them popping out, and as such, they appear to \"spring\" out instantly when turned on. It also uses a unique horn, not present on other car, whose tone is similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Manana\"&gt;Manana&lt;/a&gt;, but with a lower, partially-muffled sound.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Hakumai is quite fast, as it shares the high-power four-cylinder engine with the &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Compact\"&gt;Blista Compact&lt;/a&gt;. Its steering is heavy due to its size and weight, but it is fairly capable of maintaining traction after a sharp turn. It avoids spinning out after heavy cornering due to its . The car's weight \"can\" be put to an advantage; its weight can make it somewhat easy to put into powerslides or minor drifts. Its suspension system is like many Hondas: Its ride has an underlying firmness, but is still nice. Its handling is good, especially considering its size and ride. It has a top speed of 94 mph.\nIts greatest strengths lie in proper usage of its weight to execute drifts/powerslides or to ram smaller cars out of the way, as well as its ability to seat four. One of its \"weaknesses\" is not truly weak: its speed. While the Hakumai can overtake many vehicles on the street, it cannot outrun its direct competitor, the &lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt;, which like the Hakumai, also has four doors. The Sultan is also easier to execute drifts/powerslides on, and simply accelerates faster and has a higher top speed. However, aside from the Sultan and most other sports or supercars in the game, the Hakumai is very clearly superior. Its second main weakness is its durability. The car's engine will begin smoking after three or four serious collisions. Its braking is also not the best, and struggles to turn properly under braking pressure, as the wheels are often locked with the brakes and tends to lose control easily.\nAll in all, the Hakumai is a very good choice for getaways, but not the best (although its four-seating capability may lend it some favors). Players may think of the Hakumai as a car similar to the Sultan, but with a higher skill floor to drive.\nSpecial Variants.\nA modded Hakumai with a red paint job, spoiler, side skirts, custom front lip, and aftermarket exhaust is driven by the &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Mob\"&gt;Albanian Mob&lt;/a&gt; and can usually be found late at night in &lt;a href=\"Little%20Bay\"&gt;Little Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The gang variant can be resprayed to any default color. Hakumais may also appear with added fog lights, but they aren't functional."}

{"id": "177894", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=177894", "title": "Half-track", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Bravado\"&gt;Bravado&lt;/a&gt; Half-track is a military truck featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the update.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe truck appears to be inspired by the due to the rear tracks, with the armored cab options reminiscent of the cab armors often used in half-tracks like the .\nThe vehicle is essentially a half-track and armed variant of the &lt;a href=\"Duneloader\"&gt;Duneloader&lt;/a&gt;, where the front section retains the same cabin design and features from the regular Duneloader, but adds what appears to be an (albeit non-functional). The rear section, however, uses a larger truck bed with tall walls around, carrying several items on the sides and behind the cabin. The rear end features an unusable door on the center, a set of circular tail lights derived from the Duneloader and several semi-trucks, and a tow hitch on the back that allows it to tow another player's &lt;a href=\"Anti-Aircraft%20Trailer\"&gt;Anti-Aircraft Trailer&lt;/a&gt;. The interior is the same as the Duneloader, being a worn variation of the one from vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Bobcat%20XL\"&gt;Bobcat XL&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Rat-Truck\"&gt;Rat-Truck&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Slamvan\"&gt;Slamvan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe bodywork and turret are painted with a primary color, while the unditching roller, fenders, bottom side, wheels and track wheels are painted with a secondary color. The front section retains the same wheels as the regular Duneloader, but the rear one uses continuous tracks, each one consisting of a front drive , a rear and a return roller. Four road wheels are supported by pivoting arms that are sprung with mounted in a center box housing, allowing the vehicle to drive smoothly over uneven terrain. A differential provides connection between the engine driveshaft and the drive sprockets.\nThe vehicle is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with a dual machine gun turret resembling , but can be replaced with a quad autocannon turret resembling . Both weapons are manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Vom%20Feuer\"&gt;Vom Feuer&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nAlthough the Half-track possess average top speed due to its weight and the tracks, it has great acceleration and good mobility, allowing to move quicker than its standard version. The tracks provide great traction on any surface, allowing the vehicle to climb very steep hills with ease, even nearly vertical hills when going in a straight line. Its handling is also great, despite being a bit larger than its normal version, possibly due to the limited top speed.\nNot only is the Half-track great at handling off-road conditions, it can also tolerate deep water. While not amphibious, the Half-track can be submerged up until the snorkel on the left side of the cab is drowned. This is because exhausts in \"GTA V\" determine when the vehicle should cut out under water, and the Half-track's snorkel is considered an exhaust by the game - moreover, small amounts of exhaust fumes can be seen coming out of the snorkel. Since the snorkel (\"exhaust\") is raised above the cab, the player can drive the Half-track underwater so long as the tip of the snorkel remains above the water surface. This trait is shared with its standard variant, the &lt;a href=\"Duneloader\"&gt;Duneloader&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike the Duneloader, the Half-track is powered by a diesel engine which, due to the low texture details, does not reveal its exact configuration. The engine is coupled to a 4-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear-wheel drive layout. Its engine sound is shared with that of the &lt;a href=\"APC\"&gt;APC&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor.\nThe Half-track has excellent tolerance against gunfire and explosions, being the most armored &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicles\"&gt;Personal Vehicle&lt;/a&gt; in the game, along with the &lt;a href=\"Nightshark\"&gt;Nightshark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up%20Custom\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up Custom&lt;/a&gt;. When Armor Upgrade 100% is installed, it takes 27 &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Launcher\"&gt;Homing missiles&lt;/a&gt;, 9 &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RPGs&lt;/a&gt;, 9 &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bombs\"&gt;sticky bombs&lt;/a&gt; or 5 tank cannon shots to destroy the vehicle (the amount of explosives taken is halved if the vehicle is not occupied by a player). The gunner is also safe from the front thanks to the turret shields and the bed walls, and they are able to attack enemies with little to no risk of being shot. However, one should be careful when dealing with multiple enemies, as one can be easily shot from other angles and from a higher level than the vehicle. The gunner is fully protected from explosives, as long as there is a driver or passenger inside the vehicle, otherwise it will be easy to disarm.\nThe Half-track can be equipped with additional Armor Plating that will primarily affect the windows. Adding any Armor Plating will take away the ability for occupants to use throwable weapons, and the Heavy Armor Plating upgrade removes the occupants' ability to use any drive-by weapon. Strangely, even if no Armor Plating is installed, the windshield is completely bulletproof (in a similar way to the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Transporter\"&gt;Police Transporter&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Police%20Riot\"&gt;Police Riot&lt;/a&gt;), and even a Mk II weapon with Full Metal Jacket rounds cannot shoot through it. The side windows, however, do not provide any protection, even with Armor Plating installed. The driver and passenger are also fully protected from firearms from the back of the vehicle.\nWeaponry.\nThe Half-track is equipped with a turret on the back that can be used by another player, offering a 360 degree coverage and a maximum upper elevation angle of 35 degrees. Both turrets have similar statistics, with a damage per shot of 75 and a range of 500 meters. They also have a \u00d71.5 modifier against vehicles (inflicting 112.5) and the ability to destroy them upon being damaged enough, similar to Minigun turrets.\nTrailer.\nTowing an &lt;a href=\"Anti-Aircraft%20Trailer\"&gt;Anti-Aircraft Trailer&lt;/a&gt; in collaboration with another player gives the vehicle increased potential, as the trailer turret can provide additional defense when the main vehicle is supressing enemies. Caution should be taken when carrying the AA trailer, as it is possible to trigger a proximity mine that the Half-track has placed, destroying the trailer. The lack of armor often makes the trailer the first vehicle to lose during a combat. \n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nHalf-track=\nDual MG=\nQuad Autocannon=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Half-track can only be modified at a &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;Vehicle Workshop&lt;/a&gt; inside a &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt;."}

If swung from the correct range, the Hammer may connect with the victim's face, knocking them out instantly or even killing them. It is also capable of denting and removing parts of vehicles, and, if swung enough times, has the ability to damage a vehicle to the point of it igniting.\nBeing a single-handed weapon, it can be used while on a motorcycle, albeit only in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nThe Hammer, along with the &lt;a href=\"Screwdriver\"&gt;Screwdriver&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;MP5&lt;/a&gt;, are the only weapons that do not have a spawn point in the city and have to be purchased.\nBeta Content.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Hammer was intended to return in \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\", and had three defined spawn points on the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; map at some point in development, which are mentioned in the developer notes in the uncompiled codice_1 script file accidentally left in the files for \"\": \nWhile the model itself is no longer found in the files, the texture image used for the Hammer is still present in the codice_2 texture image shared between multiple melee weapons, also reused from \"GTA Vice City\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nThe Hammer was intended to return in \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\", reusing the same model from \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", although using the textures from the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20Axe\"&gt;Hand Axe&lt;/a&gt;.

In the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;, the file is known as handling.dat (in \"GTA IV\") and handling.meta (in \"GTA V\" and \"Online\") and calculates more factors.\nBeing relatively simple to edit, many gamers tweak vehicle settings in order to change a vehicle's handling properties, such as acceleration, mass, center of mass, ride height and braking force. The file is often edited when installing &lt;a href=\"Modifications\"&gt;vehicle mods&lt;/a&gt;.\nCriticisms.\nIt is a generally held opinion that vehicles tend to have an unrealistic amount of traction, and hence have an exaggerated capacity to take corners at speed. This also renders sustained drifting almost impossible. In all GTA III era games (except for San Andreas), the game engine calculates a vehicle's maximum speed based on its 'acceleration' value and its 'mass' value. This led the heavy duty trucks and buses in these games to have higher top speeds than the sports cars. The default brake force values on almost all vehicles are so high that any use of the brakes causes all four wheels to lock up, making it difficult to slow for corners. Those who seek a more realistic driving experience may tweak these settings.\nIronically, GTA IV's vehicle's handling has been argued by some to be too realistic/unrealistic due to heavily decreased traction, subtle oversteer, and how the car handles when doing turns.\nOriginal Files.\nThese subpages contain the original handling.cfg/handling.dat files from their respective GTA games:"}

Trevor barges into the apartment, where he startles &lt;a href=\"Debra\"&gt;Debra&lt;/a&gt;, Floyd's girlfriend, who has just returned from a business trip. As Trevor rants incoherently, an infuriated Debra repeatedly demands that Trevor leave. Eventually, Debra demands that Floyd leave as well, blaming him for Trevor's presence and stating that \"&lt;a href=\"Bob%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Bob&lt;/a&gt;\" (presumably Debra's lover) was right about him, and Floyd is \"not a man at all\". Having had enough, Debra grabs a pistol and holds both men at gunpoint, while Floyd angrily grabs a knife in response, before Trevor condemns them for their behavior, as the screen cuts to black.\nFloyd and Debra are then killed off-screen, and the scene shifts to the exterior of the apartment. Trevor, now covered in blood, staggers out of the front door. &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Hebert\"&gt;Wade&lt;/a&gt; arrives, wanting to visit Floyd, but Trevor, not wanting Wade to hear of his cousin's death, takes him to the &lt;a href=\"Vanilla%20Unicorn\"&gt;Vanilla Unicorn&lt;/a&gt; instead. On their way, Trevor explains that Floyd and Debra have \"disappeared\" and will probably not return.

It overlooks the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, with clear views of the beach.\nThe store is a 2-storey building, with a grill diner on ground level and a surf shop above it. In front of the main building is outdoor seating with shelter, on the front of which is the Hang Ten logo. A &lt;a href=\"Flies\"&gt;fly zapper&lt;/a&gt; is found hung from the sheltering. Advertising for &lt;a href=\"Sprunk\"&gt;Sprunk&lt;/a&gt; appears on the window above the main door.

They may be customized with several additions, similar to Underground &lt;a href=\"Bunkers\"&gt;Bunkers&lt;/a&gt;, Motorcycle &lt;a href=\"Clubhouses\"&gt;Clubhouses&lt;/a&gt; and CEO &lt;a href=\"Offices\"&gt;Offices&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are five hangars available to purchase from &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank%20Foreclosures\"&gt;Maze Bank Foreclosures&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce a hangar is purchased, an introduction cutscene is played upon first entry. The &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; discovers two corpses near an unoccupied &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20800\"&gt;Cuban 800&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Jakowski\"&gt;Ron Jakowski&lt;/a&gt;, using an intercom speaker in the hangar, warns the player that he has a space weapon (Russian). The protagonist eventually finds him behind a stack of boxes, speaking through a microphone and watching through a small CCTV monitor. Ron gets scared of the protagonist, before realizing that it is his new partner. Ron describes how he is alone and was supposed to be protected forever by &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;his best friend&lt;/a&gt; who has \"gone Vinewood\" on him. He thinks he has screwed up by shooting two (assumed) government agents in the head. Eventually, &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Reed\"&gt;Charlie Reed&lt;/a&gt;, the mechanic, appears from a room of the hangar with a &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt; bag and a thermos flask in his hands, and he is briefly introduced by Ron and is immediately sent back to work. From there, Ron make a full tour of the hangar with the player, explaining how the facility works, showing the office, the living quarters (if purchased), the supply storage and the mechanic, who is able to modify aircraft. After the tour, both Ron and the player load the corpses into Ron's plane, while he states he will be in touch with the player once they start the business after taking care of some &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County%20Radio%20Community%20Hour\"&gt;radio work&lt;/a&gt;.\nFunctionality.\nThe office provides the player with access to &lt;a href=\"Free%20Trade%20Shipping%20Co\"&gt;Free Trade Shipping Co&lt;/a&gt; to run their &lt;a href=\"Air%20Freight%20Cargo\"&gt;smuggling business&lt;/a&gt;. However the player can simply use the hangar and workshop to store and modify aircraft without undertaking any smuggling operations.\nIf the player has purchased a hangar at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt;, then they receive low-level access pass clearance into the base, whereby they will be allowed to drive or fly into the base without incurring a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, all members of &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organizations&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Clubs&lt;/a&gt; will receive the clearance if the CEO or President owns a Zancudo hangar, though it will be revoked if the player leaves or are removed from the MC or Organization.\nA complimentary &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20800\"&gt;Cuban 800&lt;/a&gt; is supplied with every hangar.\nExisting owned (Pegasus) aircraft can be converted to &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Aircraft\"&gt;Personal Aircraft&lt;/a&gt; by ordering them from Pegasus and parking them in the hangar. They can then be personalized (resprayed). \nOwnership of a hangar provides the player with an additional &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt; option to call a personal aircraft from their hangar (floor or storage), in addition to any &lt;a href=\"personal%20vehicle\"&gt;personal vehicle&lt;/a&gt;, CEO or MC Club vehicle or &lt;a href=\"Pegasus%20Lifestyle%20Management\"&gt;Pegasus&lt;/a&gt; vehicles they may already have active. Personal Aircraft deliveries are not instantaneous and are subject to mechanic delivery cool-downs. Personal Aircraft may spawn on open areas and different from Pegasus ones.\nPersonal Aircraft are automatically insured by &lt;a href=\"Mors%20Mutual%20Insurance\"&gt;Mors Mutual Insurance&lt;/a&gt; and when destroyed, can be claimed back, subject to a $1,000 deductible.\nStorable Vehicles.\nBelow is a list of every available aircraft that the player can store in their hangar. At the rear of the hangar is a Personal Aircraft Management menu, which can be used to move and display the aircraft on the floor of the hangar and move them to and from an unseen storage location.\nAircraft are as small, medium, large or extra large and this classification dictates how many can be stored on the floor of the hangar. There is on-floor capacity for twelve small, five medium, two large and one extra large aircraft, or various combinations of sizes (except for the extra large category). Attempting to bring in a new aircraft with no spare parking on the floor for that size will move it to storage immediately. Hangar capacity including the unseen storage facility is 20 total aircraft, regardless of their size.\nThe player cannot store stolen aircraft, CEO/VIP helicopters or aircraft provided in missions. In addition, the player cannot store the &lt;a href=\"Thruster\"&gt;Thruster&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sparrow\"&gt;Sparrow&lt;/a&gt;, as they belong to dedicated properties."}

The mode is available only in ranked matches.\nOnce the players spawn, the armored police begin to surround the area in a four to six star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Enforcer\"&gt;Armored trucks&lt;/a&gt; containing about three NOOSE officers begin to arrive if the player remains in the starting point. The players make a minimum of &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;4500 if they complete Hangman's NOOSE on the Hard difficulty.\nObjective/Rules.\nThe objective of Hangman's NOOSE is to get &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Petrovic\"&gt;Petrovic&lt;/a&gt; and all live players to the extraction point, a baseball field in &lt;a href=\"Charge%20Island\"&gt;Charge Island&lt;/a&gt;, before Petrovic or all the players are killed. Each player has three to five lives, depending on the difficulty, before they are taken out of the game to leave the surviving players a chance to win.\nThere are some exceptions, though. For instance, Petrovic will keep himself housed in the jet until the area is mostly neutralized. The &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt;s at the other side of the runway will help greatly to the other players on the ground, if any. Also, all players must get to the extraction point, so it is wise to use one four-door vehicle such as the Annihilators to get \"everyone \"to the diamond at once.\nAlso remember that Petrovic \"can \"die, so defend him and your team-mates at all costs!\nWalkthrough.\nFour players.\nTwo players gain cover behind a box or row of boxes and begin shooting the NOOSE officers closing in on Petrovic's &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;private jet&lt;/a&gt;. The other two sprint to a &lt;a href=\"Airtug\"&gt;baggage carrier&lt;/a&gt; to the east of the starting point and floor it to the helicopters at the other side of the . Both players should get into separate helicopters, as there is insufficient room in a single chopper for all four players plus Petrovic. At this point, one of the airborne players can simply fly directly to the rally point, or, if they are accurate with the &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt;'s miniguns, can head to the jet to help clear out the NOOSE officers. Meanwhile the second player returns to the jet and collects Petrovic and the remaining players on the ground, before the entire group flies speedily to the rally point.\nThree players or fewer.\nOne player grabs the &lt;a href=\"Airtug\"&gt;baggage carrier&lt;/a&gt; and makes their way to the &lt;a href=\"Annihilator\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt; helicopters while the remaining player or players shoot down all forces approaching Petrovic. The player at the helicopters ditches the Airtug for the Annihilator and provides overhead cover back at the jets. The other ground infantry players neutralize the area with the minigun's help and then climb into the Annihilator Heli with Petrovic. Then land at the baseball diamond and Petrovic rewards them with money and a future tip to visit a &lt;a href=\"bar\"&gt;bar&lt;/a&gt;.\nRewards and Risks.\n\"A minimum of;\"\n\"More money can be collected by taking the NOOSE officers' money when they die.\"\nThis is the QUICKEST way to rank up. No other game mode can compare to this in terms of ease, speed, and money made. If you pick up 500 extra dollars every time you play hard, then you make $5000 for about 5 minutes of work. You could easily make 500,000 in a matter of hours, and perhaps $1,000,000 in a day, already making you rank 8. That leaves you only $4 million more to get to rank 10. This money can be earned over the course of 2 weeks easily, compared to many people who spent months getting to rank 10 through regular means.\nProblems can arise, however, when playing with a team of inexperienced players who are either unaware of the presence of Annihilators or simply wish to reach the rally point by road. In this case you will often find yourself waiting at the goal for slower players to catch up. In this case, rather than standing around doing nothing, find the small pedestrian pathway that runs around the baseball field where you land and start killing the pedestrians there. Many of them carry substantial sums of money, and depending on how long the slower players take to reach the rally point you can add a further $2000-3000 to your cash winnings, increasing the rate at which you will rank up.\nFurther problems include playing with people who intentionally kill Petrovic, themselves, or in Friendly Fire:ON matches, teammates. One very common group that cause problems are players on rank 10 who play Hangman's NOOSE simply to destroy the baggage cart, team kill, take Petrovic for a joy ride, or destroy the helicopter as it is flying towards the baseball field with a hand grenade. All of this may ruin the game. Players may get bugged and as a result, will make it harder to earn money and to rank up. Some players may have to send invites to the game for the trust of their friend(s) in order to complete Hangman's NOOSE without the above problem(s).\nIt is recommended that the game is set to Friendly Fire:OFF so there is no team killing.\nAchievement.\nTo get the \"Fly the Co-Op\" &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20and%20Trophies%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;, players must beat the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt; developers' time of 2:32 as one of three requirements (&lt;a href=\"Bomb%20Da%20Base%20II\"&gt;Bomb Da Base II&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deal%20Breaker%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Deal Breaker&lt;/a&gt; must also be completed within similar time restrictions)."}

Upon purchasing another player-owned vehicle, both the owner and the buyer get a voucher for HSW modification to the vehicle, which can be redeemed for any HSW vehicle modification to get it for free.\nLimited-time vehicles are also valid for players to buy from, even if the vehicle itself is not currently listed for sale on in-game websites, or it requires additional unmet unlock requirements.\nA variant of the HSW Specification Service, dubbed the \"Car Meet Specification Service\", was added to platforms (&lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PS4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;) with update in December 2023. This service operates largely identically to the HSW service, but lacks the HSW branding.\nHao's Special Works Race Series.\nA collection of races for HSW-tuned vehicles only. Every track in this series is an identical duplicate of already existing Land Race tracks, such as &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Underground\"&gt;Downtown Underground&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cutting%20Coroners\"&gt;Cutting Coroners&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Greenwich%20Meantime\"&gt;Greenwich Meantime&lt;/a&gt;.\nHao's Special Works Time Trials.\nA &lt;a href=\"Time%20Trials\"&gt;Time Trials&lt;/a&gt; race similar to existing Time Trials, but exclusive to HSW-tuned vehicles. The par time will be different based on what vehicle is used. The featured trial is changed to a new course with each &lt;a href=\"Events\"&gt;event week&lt;/a&gt;. The weekly HSW Time Trial will be marked on the map with the icon. Completing all eight HSW Time Trials unlocks the ability to purchase the \"HSW Elite\" livery for all HSW-tuned vehicles.\nPremium Test Ride.\nA Hao-modified ride that can be used on the &lt;a href=\"LS%20Car%20Meet%23Test_Track\"&gt;Test Track&lt;/a&gt; parked at the test track end of the workshop space."}

After a quarrel with his mother regarding his crude language, Packie sets off with Niko, revealing that they need to \"take care of some business\" out at the docks in &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;. A slew of illegal meds are being smuggled into the country from the east by the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Triads&lt;/a&gt;, and Packie wants to steal the truckload of drugs while it's being conveyed. He reveals that &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boccino\"&gt;Ray Boccino&lt;/a&gt; asked him to steal the meds and deliver them to his lockup in &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Westminster&lt;/a&gt; and, although Packie is mistrustful of him, he believes it's worth the money.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nWalkthrough.\nThe player must drive Packie to the docks in &lt;a href=\"Fishmarket%20North\"&gt;Fishmarket North&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, the player must follow Packie all the way to the top of the &lt;a href=\"RS%20Haul%20Depot%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;RS Haul Depot&lt;/a&gt; near the docks where the meds are being delivered. The game will introduce the player to climbing and shimmying as Niko and Packie scale the warehouse to access the roof. When the player reaches the top, a cutscene will follow, showing a boat pull up with the meds, which get loaded into a &lt;a href=\"Yankee\"&gt;Yankee&lt;/a&gt; truck. Packie will then instruct Niko to climb down the small mini-cabin on the side of the building next to the river and start shooting the Triads. The best course of action is to eliminate the Triads from the roof before climbing down the cabin, as the player will have a better vantage point from the top of the warehouse. Packie will give the player support from the roof with his &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;AK-47&lt;/a&gt; and draw some of their attention, but they will still mainly target the player.\nWhen everyone outside has been killed (including the Triad on the boat), the player must proceed to the warehouse where the truck is being held and watch out for more Triads hidden inside, two on each side of the truck. The player must avoid damaging the truck too much during the shootout. There will be a &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;first aid kit&lt;/a&gt; in the office at the left if the player needs some health. After all the Triads have been eliminated, the player must get into the truck with the meds and wait for Packie. Packie will follow Niko into the truck, and instruct Niko to drive the truck to a lockup in &lt;a href=\"Union%20Drive%20West\"&gt;Union Drive West&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Westminster\"&gt;Westminster&lt;/a&gt;. When the plater starts driving to the lockup, some Triads in cars will start following and shooting at the truck. Niko will find a box full of &lt;a href=\"grenades\"&gt;grenades&lt;/a&gt; in the truck, and the player can drop them out the window to blow up the cars (Be careful; the truck is slow and it might not clear the blast radius if the player holds the grenade for too long). If the player cannot get there without the engine catching fire and the truck blowing up, they may choose to pull over and eliminate the Triads using the truck as cover.\nThe player must park the truck in the lockup. Ray will pull up and pick up Packie to talk. He will also take Niko's number for more work.\nAftermath.\nMedia.\n&lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Tree\"&gt;Liberty Tree&lt;/a&gt; Newspaper.\n\"\"The bodies of several men have been found at the docks in &lt;a href=\"Fishmarket%20South\"&gt;Fishmarket South&lt;/a&gt;. Authorities believe they may have been members of a &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Triads%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;\"triad\"&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ming%20Family\"&gt;street gang&lt;/a&gt; smuggling contraband into &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;. Last year's prosecution of several members of the Dockworker's Union led to allegations of widespread corruption amongst the stevedores. A spokesperson for the &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;National Office of Security Enforcement&lt;/a&gt; stated that the docks in Liberty City are the gateway through which the majority of drugs, sex slaves and counterfeit goods come into the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, \"It is only a matter of time before a terrorist smuggles a nuclear weapon through our docks. If the union do not clean their act up and agree to serious salary cuts and concessions, this is a very real danger.\"\"\n\"City Councilor &lt;a href=\"Doris%20Fung\"&gt;Doris Fung&lt;/a&gt;, long accused of having links with several &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20IV%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt; gangs made a statement to the press, \"Those who died on the docks were the victims of this crime, not the perpetrators. We shouldn't be asking who they were working for, why they had weapons or why they were on the docks in the first place. We should be asking who killed these young men.\" Authorities are searching for two suspects, both white males.\"\""}

Cartwright is the first person to provide the &lt;a href=\"Protagonists%20in%20GTA%20London\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; with jobs.

His missions include wiping out two small-time gangs under the orders of &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Caukenbolls\"&gt;Mr. Caukenbolls&lt;/a&gt;, by blowing up their hideouts and killing their members in a shoot-out, chauffeuring Caukenbolls and defending him from rival gangsters, then rescuing him from them.\nAfter those events, the rival thugs are wiped out and Mr. Caukenbolls is taken to a safe place. Soon afterwards, Harold tells the protagonist to try and discredit &lt;a href=\"Gene%20White\"&gt;Gene White&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of a rival gang, but in the end, the player kills him and recruits his &lt;a href=\"Prostitutes\"&gt;girls&lt;/a&gt;.

Another time, he tasks the player with delivering dolls for his little nephew, &lt;a href=\"Ashley\"&gt;Ashley&lt;/a&gt;. The last job for him involves killing a guy who is blackmailing Harold.

The protagonist later disrupts one of the Mods' drug deals on the rooftop of a building in Westminster and &lt;a href=\"Mods%20and%20Sods%20-%20Phonebox%202\"&gt;steals their Mod Scooter&lt;/a&gt; containing stashed drugs for Harold and Pretty Charlie, and also helps them win a bet on a football game after &lt;a href=\"Mods%20and%20Sods%20-%20Phonebox%203\"&gt;kidnapping the football team for them&lt;/a&gt; so they can persuade them.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Noles%20Brothers\"&gt;Noles Brothers&lt;/a&gt;, one of Harold's rivals, began taxing &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;\u00a3&lt;/a&gt;5000 and drugs from Harold and his gang, and the protagonist is hired by Pretty Charlie to &lt;a href=\"Mods%20and%20Sods%20-%20Phonebox%204\"&gt;wipe out the rival gang&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some later point, Albert Crisp's personal stash of drugs is stolen and he blames Harold for stealing them after he disappeared. In order to find out where Harold is, the protagonist is told to go and meet &lt;a href=\"Cyprus%20Phil\"&gt;Cyprus Phil&lt;/a&gt; in northeast City. Phil will deny knowing where Harold is, however, and Albert himself will order the protagonist to kill him. After killing Phil, Albert will tell the protagonist to go and find Harold's sister &lt;a href=\"Beryl%20Cartwright\"&gt;Beryl&lt;/a&gt; in central &lt;a href=\"Soho\"&gt;Soho&lt;/a&gt; and talk to her. She will deny knowing where Harold is too and Albert will angrily tell the protagonist to kill her as well.\nOnce Beryl is dead, the protagonist will be told that Archie Crisp has found out that Harold is trying to leave London in the back of his mate's green &lt;a href=\"Myni\"&gt;Myni&lt;/a&gt;, which will be driving around in south &lt;a href=\"Hyde%20Park\"&gt;Hyde Park&lt;/a&gt;. After , the protagonist will need to go and fetch his red &lt;a href=\"Locust\"&gt;Locust&lt;/a&gt; which is parked behind his flat in east City, as Albert assumes the drugs are hidden in it. The car needs to be taken back to the garage in east &lt;a href=\"Mile%20End\"&gt;Mile End&lt;/a&gt; where it is discovered that there were no drugs in the car or in Harold's flat, which means he did not steal them after all. Albert does not care, however, as Harold \"was a useless prat anyway\"."}

Another interesting landmark in Harwood is a disused train yard containing abandoned flatcars; the yard is connected to a tunnel that cuts underneath Saint Mark's, originally intending to connect to &lt;a href=\"Portland%20View\"&gt;Portland View&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Harbor\"&gt;Portland Harbor&lt;/a&gt;.\nHarwood is also a major location in Liberty City's transportation system in both \"GTA III\" and \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", housing the Portland entrance into the &lt;a href=\"Porter%20Tunnel\"&gt;Porter Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; and the Portland end of the &lt;a href=\"Ferry\"&gt;Portland-Staunton Ferry link&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.\nEvents.\nHarwood &lt;a href=\"Harwood%20Incident\"&gt;became infamous&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1971\"&gt;1971&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; hitman &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt; was sent to assassinate a rival gang member on the orders of his boss, &lt;a href=\"Sonny%20Forelli\"&gt;Sonny Forelli&lt;/a&gt;. However, Forelli had set up an ambush in an attempt to assassinate Vercetti, and when Vercetti arrived in Harwood he found that eleven hitmen had been sent to kill him. Vercetti survived the ambush and killed all eleven men, landing a &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;fifteen-year&lt;/a&gt; prison sentence and gaining the nickname of \"The Harwood Butcher\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;, during the events of \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Daniel%20O%27Toole\"&gt;Joseph Daniel O'Toole&lt;/a&gt; switches allegiance to the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Sindacco Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;. O'Toole is driven by &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt; to the junkyard in Harwood to be \"made\", but is instead &lt;a href=\"The%20Made%20Man\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Mickey%20Hamfists\"&gt;Mickey Hamfists&lt;/a&gt; on the orders of &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore Leone&lt;/a&gt;."}

At that time, Sonny became a powerful Mafia boss in Liberty City at a young age. Sonny and his brothers formed the &lt;a href=\"Forelli%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Forelli Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, who from the 1960s to the mid-1980s were the dominant crime family in Liberty City.\nLeaving his father's legitimate business behind, Tommy joined the Forelli family and eventually became a soldier in the family's hierachy, mostly working as a personal hitman and henchman from Sonny, alongside &lt;a href=\"Harry\"&gt;Harry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lee\"&gt;Lee&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Harwood Incident.\nIn 1971, Sonny sends Tommy to kill a man in the neighborhood of &lt;a href=\"Harwood\"&gt;Harwood&lt;/a&gt;. The background of the hit target is not given. \nArriving at the location, Tommy is ambushed by a group of unidentified gang members. Tommy manages to survive the ambush, killing the eleven men that were sent to assassinate him. Little information is given to how exactly the ambush happened, or who the ambushers were. It is widely speculated that Sonny himself orchestrated the ambush, but this was never confirmed. \nHowever, the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;LCPD&lt;/a&gt; quickly arrived at the crime scene, &lt;a href=\"Busted\"&gt;arresting&lt;/a&gt; Tommy shortly after the killings. He was convicted of eleven counts of murder. Honoring the Italian Mafia's , Tommy refused to divulge any Forelli Family secrets to the LCPD or cooperate with authorities against the family.\nTommy was initially sentenced to death for the murders, but his sentence was commuted. Tommy remained in prison for &lt;a href=\"1986\"&gt;fifteen years&lt;/a&gt;. This case would later become infamous, with the press giving Tommy the nickname of \"the Harwood Butcher\". \nAfter the Incident.\nInterested in entering the narcotics trade, traditionally a no go area for Mafia families in Liberty City, Sonny decides to start a drug operation down south in the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Florida\"&gt;State of Florida&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a way to get rid of Tommy (believing his presence in the city would hamper the family's business), and expanding their business at the same time, Sonny sends Tommy to &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt;, Florida, to setup the Forelli's narcotics business, to allow the family to get rich off Florida's notoriously profitable drug trade. \n&lt;a href=\"Ken%20Rosenberg\"&gt;Ken Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt;, a Vice City-based lawyer who had worked for the Forellis for &lt;a href=\"1978\"&gt;eight years&lt;/a&gt;, began representing them down in Florida, serving as their main contact and informant. With the assistance of retired colonel &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Cortez\"&gt;Juan Cortez&lt;/a&gt;, Rosenberg organizes a &lt;a href=\"Cocaine\"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"In%20The%20Beginning...\"&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Viceport\"&gt;Viceport&lt;/a&gt; between the Forellis and the &lt;a href=\"Vance%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Vance Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, a formerly large narcotics gang who operated largely in the city &lt;a href=\"1984\"&gt;a couple of years prior&lt;/a&gt;, who were trying to get rid of twenty kilos of cocaine that had been stashed since they &lt;a href=\"Last%20Stand\"&gt;left the town&lt;/a&gt;. \nHowever, the drug deal goes terribly wrong as a &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz%27s%20Hitmen\"&gt;third-party group&lt;/a&gt; ambushes the Forellis and the Vance brothers, stealing the Vance brothers' drugs, the Forellis' money and killing Harry, Lee and &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;Victor Vance&lt;/a&gt; in the process.\nTommy &lt;a href=\"An%20Old%20Friend\"&gt;informs&lt;/a&gt; Sonny that the deal was ambushed and that both Harry and Lee, who had accompanied him and Ken, were killed. Sonny asks if he still has the money, which Tommy does not. An irate Sonny reminds Tommy that he is \"not a man to be screwed with\" and that Tommy will have to get his money back. Tommy reassures Sonny that he will get him his money and the drugs back. Sonny tells Tommy he will be in touch before hanging up.\nTommy &lt;a href=\"The%20Party\"&gt;begins investigating&lt;/a&gt; the drug deal ambush with the help of the the people who organized the deal - Ken Rosenberg and Juan Cortez. Eventually, Tommy teams up with &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Vance\"&gt;Lance Vance&lt;/a&gt;, the brother of Victor who was killed in the same ambush. In the end, they &lt;a href=\"Treacherous%20Swine\"&gt;discover&lt;/a&gt; that the deal was leaked by Cortez' right-hand man &lt;a href=\"Gonzalez\"&gt;Gonzalez&lt;/a&gt; under orders of the city's cocaine baron &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz\"&gt;Ricardo Diaz&lt;/a&gt;. \nAfter &lt;a href=\"Rub%20Out\"&gt;taking over&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Diaz%27s%20Gang\"&gt;Ricardo Diaz's empire&lt;/a&gt; with the help of Lance, Tommy builds himself a &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Gang\"&gt;bigger empire&lt;/a&gt;, making good connections with other Vice City organizations including &lt;a href=\"Umberto%20Robina\"&gt;Umberto Robina&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Cubans\"&gt;Cuban&lt;/a&gt; gang, &lt;a href=\"Mitch%20Baker\"&gt;Big Mitch Baker's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20Bikers\"&gt;Biker&lt;/a&gt; gang, and &lt;a href=\"Shakedown%20%28GTA%20Vice%20City%29\"&gt;expanding&lt;/a&gt; his business to various areas of Vice City. Tommy also develops a soft spot for &lt;a href=\"Earnest%20Kelly\"&gt;Earnest Kelly&lt;/a&gt;, an old man running the &lt;a href=\"Print%20Works\"&gt;Print Works&lt;/a&gt; business bought by Tommy, due to his own father working in a print works when Tommy was a child, and he begins to view Kelly as a father figure.\nShowdown.\nEventually, Tommy receives a phone call from Sonny, demanding not only the lost money and drugs, but also a cut of Tommy's profits. Tommy does not respond and proceeds to ignore Sonny's calls. \nSonny sends six Forelli henchmen to Vice City to forcibly tax Tommy's businesses, one of whom beats up Earnest Kelly at the Print Works. Furious at the attack on Kelly, Tommy orders some of the print workers to take him to the hospital, before going after the Forellis and &lt;a href=\"Cap%20the%20Collector\"&gt;killing them one by one&lt;/a&gt;. Tommy makes clear to the collectors that his ties with Sonny Forelli are over, before murdering them. \nSonny hears about the death of his henchmen, and takes a flight to Vice City with his men to personally demand his cut of Tommy's profits. After hearing that Sonny is coming, Tommy orders Rosenberg to collect a large sum of counterfeit cash in an attempt to fool Sonny. Sonny arrives at &lt;a href=\"Vercetti%20Estate\"&gt;Tommy's mansion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Starfish%20Island\"&gt;Starfish Island&lt;/a&gt; along with several Forelli Family members. \nWhen Tommy and Sonny finally meet, Sonny begins to mock Tommy about him needlessly killing so many people in Harwood. Tommy angrily accuses Sonny of setting up that ambush, which Sonny denies, calling it \"an unfortunate set of circumstances\". As Tommy prepares to give Sonny the counterfeit cash, Lance openly betrays Tommy, citing \"business\" as his motivation. Sonny confronts Tommy over his attempt to placate him with counterfeit cash. Tommy, still reeling from Lance's betrayal, replies that he just wanted to piss Sonny off before he kills him. This results in a &lt;a href=\"Keep%20Your%20Friends%20Close...\"&gt;massive gunfight&lt;/a&gt; inside Tommy's mansion. \nAfter killing Lance, Tommy confronts Sonny, saying that he took fifteen years from him. Sonny replies that he owned Tommy and the fifteen years also belonged to him. Tommy then kills Sonny's guards before finally killing Sonny.\nLegacy.\nAfter the death of Sonny Forelli and several of his henchmen in Vice City, the Forelli family is severely weakened. The other Mafia families in Liberty City, the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leones&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Sindaccos&lt;/a&gt;, began to take over Sonny's rackets, ultimately leading to the events of the &lt;a href=\"Caligula%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Caligula's Palace&lt;/a&gt; arc between the three families in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Venturas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Las Venturas&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;, and subsequently the events of \"\" in &lt;a href=\"1998\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwelve years after Sonny's death, a is advertised in Liberty City, starring film actors Enzo Nardi and Gino Tanzilo. Oddly, the movie poster states that it is set in \"Vice City, 1971\" despite the actual events having taken place in Liberty City, and Sonny Forelli's surname is misspelled. This is likely an oversight by the developers.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"2002\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;, Tommy Vercetti is still a powerful Florida crime kingpin. He is mentioned by &lt;a href=\"Kent%20Paul\"&gt;Kent Paul&lt;/a&gt; on his &lt;a href=\"Kent%20Paul%27s%2080%27s%20Nostalgia%20Zone%21\"&gt;personal blog&lt;/a&gt; about the 1980s, in a small citation in the \"Social Problems\" section. The Forellis never retaliated against Tommy following the death of Sonny. The Forelli Crime Family would eventually be weakened to the point of being reduced to a small-time Italian gang referred to as \"the Forelli brothers\" and being occasionally attacked by the Leones over their debts."}

It can be used by any &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Associate or Bodyguard&lt;/a&gt; to assist the driver of the truck.\nWhen the trailer is connected to the trailer, it must be transported and delivered to another location far away. A successful delivery will reward the CEO/VIP and all associates with cash and RP.\nIf the player is killed, they will be able to re-enter the truck cab and continue to transport the trailer. If the truck is destroyed, they will have to obtain another truck cab and reattach the trailer. Other available &lt;a href=\"Hauler\"&gt;Hauler&lt;/a&gt;s are scattered around the map for the player to obtain and use, which roughly follow the route to the destination; however, any truck cab capable of towing can be used. The trailer itself is indestructible to fire, collision and explosives, and if it becomes turned over or otherwise difficult to obtain, it will be relocated to a suitable position. The mission will fail if the trailer become fully submerged in water. Once the trailer is delivered, the player is forced out of the truck and the mission is completed.\nVehicles which can tow the trailer are:\nThe trailer can be:\nIt should be noted that the player must use truck cabs and cannot use the &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt;'s grappling hook to transport the trailer, as the trailer will become disconnected seconds after connecting.\nTraffic on the main highways, such as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Ocean%20Highway\"&gt;Great Ocean Highway&lt;/a&gt;, is greatly reduced during delivery, to the point where only one or two cars are onscreen.

At this point, the trailer becomes visible on the radar along with the same available truck cabs around the map. They are instructed to steal the trailer and deliver it to the drop-off location. They are able to kill the player by the means of weaponry or by exploding the truck cab, killing the driver.

The front bumper is mounted in a slightly lower height than the one on the Packer and comes equipped with a large ram-bar, along with a license plate. The bolt details around the lower areas and over the grille are absent in this model, and the grille appears to be slightly narrower than the one on the Packer and bears the cursive \"Jobuilt\" logo above. The roof area features a different set of marker lights and dual trumpet horns, while the sides have additional frames with mounted antenna.\nThe rear section follows the same layout from the other semi-trailer trucks in the game, having the corresponding , large fuel tanks on the sides, curved mudguards in front of the rear wheels and the same rear end, bearing the license plate on the center and the mudflaps on the outer sides. The Hauler shares the tail light arrangement with the Packer and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;, including reverse lights, main lights and brake lights. Like many other cars and trucks in \"GTA V\", the turning signals are part of the rear lights, therefore appearing to be slightly orange.\nThe Hauler uses the same interior as most industrial vehicles, using analog dials and gauges. The Hauler is also fitted with a CB radio, and occasional trucker chatter can be heard regardless of whether the main radio is turned on or off. The chatter will only play if playing as &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe truck may spawn either with a flat roof or with a tall air deflector bearing additional marker lights on the front and a small extension behind the cabin. The primary color of the vehicle is applied on the upper area of the cabin and the front mudguards of the rear section, while the secondary color is applied on the lower areas of both the cabin and the rear extension of the air deflector. It uses the same industrial wheels from trucks like the Packer and the Phantom.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe performance the truck is average, able to maintain an average speed and is considerably good, even if it is the slowest tractor trailer in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\". Acceleration, however, is rather slow, and gear change is among the slowest in the class. The weight of the truck does not support how slow the truck is, but other factors such as its front weight and flat nose design force the truck to slow down. With no weight distribution at all, the truck is not a good pick for speeding or crashing, and is not a good choice for off-road environments, leaving its only purpose as a road vehicle. Handling is generally good, given the short wheelbase and limited speed.\nThe Hauler has no visible engine model due to its cab-over body design. However, the engine sound is somewhat similar to a diesel engine, which revs moderately high (yet still lower than other trucks, such as the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Police%20Riot\"&gt;Police Riot&lt;/a&gt;), and provides a significantly smooth engine sound, yet the roar produced from the engine can still be heard unlike the aforementioned vehicles, the Benson and Police Riot. The engine sound is shared with many of the trucks in the game, such as the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rubble\"&gt;Rubble&lt;/a&gt;."}

It also takes design cues from the UniSol truck used in the 1992 film , mainly for the barred windows, sloped roof and ridged details on the sides.\nDesign.\nThe Hauler Custom is a customizable variant of the &lt;a href=\"Hauler\"&gt;Hauler&lt;/a&gt;, which retains the general layout from the regular version. However, it features a large razor-sharp grille guard that sports numerous spikes along the bottom, a criss-cross designed grille shield and bolts around the sides attaching it to the bodywork, while the actual front of the truck is more of less identical to the Hauler, only with smaller headlights and no turning signals.\nThe cabin of the truck is longer in appearance and features various storage compartments on the rearmost sides, as well as ladder-style steps and grab handles for access. On the upper area, the windows are protected by black horizontal frames, while ridged details can be seen next to the door windows. The roof has a sloped air deflector with open sections on the front, and two circular auxiliary lamps (though they do not function).\nThe rear section is largely the same as the Hauler and many industrial trucks, having the corresponding , large fuel tanks on the sides, curved mudguards in front of the rear wheels and the same square-shaped rear end, with the license plate on the center and the mudflaps on the outer sides. The Hauler Custom shares the tail light arrangement with the Hauler, the &lt;a href=\"Packer\"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;, including reverse lights, main lights and brake lights. Like many other cars and trucks in \"GTA V\", the turning signals are part of the rear lights, therefore appearing to be slightly orange. Behind the cabin there are the same upper ridged details as on the sides, as well as the large exhaust stacks.\nThe primary color of the truck is applied on the cabin, the fuel tanks and the front mudguards of the rear section, while the secondary color is applied on the supports of the window bars, the side steps and grab handles, the support frames of the rear-view mirrors, the upper frames on the sides of the cabin, the handles of the storage compartments, the outer details of the exhaust heat shields, the straps of the fuel tanks and the rear end. It uses the same wheel design as the Hauler and many industrial vehicles, but has spiked details in place of the regular bolt details.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Hauler Custom is vastly quicker than most of the vehicles in the commercial class. It has great acceleration, comparable to that of the &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Wedge\"&gt;Phantom Wedge&lt;/a&gt;, being able to go from a standstill to approaching top speed very quickly. However, the truck lacks traction on the back wheels, making the truck drift around corners and sometimes struggling to push other cars. This is also a problem when attempting to take the truck off road, as the truck will wheelspin if the terrain is too steep. The brakes of the vehicle are somewhat lacking compared to other performance stats, requiring long distances before stopping the vehicle completely. When going on a downhill, the truck may take too much distance to stop, therefore it is advised to take great care when going downhill with the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt; attached.\nOverall, it performs similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Custom\"&gt;Phantom Custom&lt;/a&gt;, but has better steering capabilities due to the short wheelbase, at the cost of having limited traction and pushing capabilities. Due to the barred windows, the occupants are unable to use &lt;a href=\"Thrown%20Weapons\"&gt;thrown weapons&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bombs\"&gt;Sticky Bombs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Proximity%20Mines\"&gt;Proximity Mines&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Hauler Custom has no visible engine model due to its cab-over body design. The engine sound is very different from other trucks, being a low-revving diesel engine also shared with the Phantom Custom.\nArmor.\nAs with the Phantom Custom, the vehicle is incredibly durable, able to take multiple explosions before being destroyed. The cabin also offers limited protection to the occupants thanks to its bullet-resistant windows, which can withstand up to 15 rounds from most firearms before being shattered.

The main section of the aircraft consists of a partially exposed engine bay with small vents on each side, black thin landing skids with tall struts on the underside, and a two-bladed main rotor on top, along with small steps on the frontal struts and vertical handles near the canopy. The rear section mostly consists of a lightweight tail boom with steel tube supports below it, small fins on the upper vertical stabilizer, and a small strike guard on the lower one, as well as the corresponding two-bladed tail rotor on the left. The interior of the aircraft features a small flight instrument with the \"Flyer\" dials on it, the pedals, the control stick and the main seat, along with a single handle on top of the canopy to open/close it. The canopy is shatterproof, though it is not bulletproof.\nThe primary color is applied on the aircraft's body, part of the skid struts, the engine fuel cells and the rotor blades, while the secondary color is applied on the frames around the engine bay, the side vents, the engine cam covers, the tail boom, and the stick, pedals, seat and stitching of the interior.\nThe vehicle can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with a three-barreled .50 caliber &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt; beneath the cabin, which resembles a gatling gun.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Havok has very nimble handling and good speed thanks to its lightweight, compact design. Its size allows it to fly through tight spaces, being similar to the &lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Attack variant&lt;/a&gt;. One major drawback of the vehicle is that the narrow skids cause it to lean erratically upon a fast landing, often requiring immediate input to counter the leaning effect, or taking off again to level the aircraft. The rotor blades do not seem to keep the vehicle away from the hard surface either, which causes the Havok to lean to a side and therefore being very difficult to recover. In addition, the tail rotor is not very resilient to collision damage, only taking a couple of seconds to break and disable the helicopter.\nThe aircraft is powered by what seems to be a Flat-4 engine with similar details to the ones from the &lt;a href=\"FCR%201000\"&gt;FCR 1000&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"FCR%201000%20Custom\"&gt;Custom variant&lt;/a&gt;. Its sound is similar to most regular helicopters, albeit with an additional effect that is barely heard in first person view, due to the rotor sound.\nArmor.\nSince the Havok is built primarily for personal transport, it is not intended to be used in heavy combat. The large windshield makes the pilot vulnerable to gunfire, in a similar way to helicopters such as the Buzzard or the &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;Frogger&lt;/a&gt;. It is also quite fragile to hits, although one can mitigate this issue with armor upgrades.\nCountermeasures.\nThe vehicle can be fitted with countermeasures to improve its defensive capabilities against homing missiles, each one with their own attributes:\nWeaponry.\nMinigun: The Havok has the option to equip a .50 caliber &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt;, which offers similar statistics to most Minigun turrets, with a base damage of 30, a high fire rate of 1,200 rounds per minute and a maximum range of 200 meters, as well as the ability to destroy vehicles instantly upon being damaged enough, ideal for aerial offensive and self-defensive situations. However, the helicopter's poor pitch angle makes it difficult to fight against ground targets.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMinigun=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

These two cars are then seen as props, located outside underneath cloth. Its next appearance is at the end of &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Inside\"&gt;Deep Inside&lt;/a&gt; after Franklin steals a &lt;a href=\"JB%20700\"&gt;JB 700&lt;/a&gt;. The final appearance doesn't involve entering the garage itself, but rather delivering a &lt;a href=\"Monroe\"&gt;Monroe&lt;/a&gt; outside and loading it onto a &lt;a href=\"Trailer%20%28car%20carrier%29\"&gt;car carrier trailer&lt;/a&gt; along with the rest of the cars.\nBetween the first and third appearances, &lt;a href=\"Franklin\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; may be encountered inside the garage during a &lt;a href=\"Switch%20Scenes\"&gt;switch scene&lt;/a&gt;.

In both games it is inaccessible to either &lt;a href=\"Claude\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0\nThe building houses a large ground car park, with two vehicles normally parked on opposite sides. An enclosed path leads to the front doors of the headquarters and the Head Radio logo is placed above the door. The colour of the building in \"Grand Theft Auto III\" varies to the colour used in Liberty City Stories. The picture to the right is the Liberty City Stories building, coloured in a light green shade, but the \"Grand Theft Auto III\" colour is grey, most likely because of aging. Although the colour varies between the two games, the shape of the offices stay the same.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto III\", the building also transmits &lt;a href=\"Chatterbox%20FM\"&gt;Chatterbox FM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Double%20Clef%20FM\"&gt;Double Clef FM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flashback%20FM\"&gt;Flashback FM&lt;/a&gt;. This is likely because those three radio stations are sister stations owned by &lt;a href=\"Love%20Media\"&gt;Love Media&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nAt the beginning of GTA Liberty City, a strike of the &lt;a href=\"ferry\"&gt;ferry&lt;/a&gt; workers (led by &lt;a href=\"Jane%20Hopper\"&gt;Jane Hopper&lt;/a&gt;) is taking place; Hopper and the workers debunk the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Callahan%20Bridge\"&gt;Callahan Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Porter%20Tunnel\"&gt;Porter Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;, since it will put the ferry workers out of work. &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Leone\"&gt;Salvatore Leone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Leaders\"&gt;Don&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone Crime Family&lt;/a&gt;, tries to appease Hopper and make her call off the strike; Hopper, however, was still not convinced. She even snubbed Salvatore once more during a radio interview. This apparently angers Salvatore, who &lt;a href=\"Rollercoaster%20Ride\"&gt;sends&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt; to send a message to Hopper.\nToni makes his way to the Head Radio Headquarters, apparently where Hopper is. He poses as Hopper's &lt;a href=\"Stretch\"&gt;limo&lt;/a&gt; driver by killing the actual driver and getting his clothes. Toni then scares her off by maniacally driving around Portland Island until she says that she would call off the strike."}

{"id": "164720", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=164720", "title": "Headhunter", "text": "Headhunter is a &lt;a href=\"Organization%20Work\"&gt;CEO/VIP Work&lt;/a&gt; mission featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the update, released on July 7, 2016.\nDescription.\nWhen activated by a VIP, four targets will be marked on the map around San Andreas for the organization to kill. Once started, they are marked for all players in the session. The player can earn a maximum of &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;30,000 depending on how many targets they kill and depending on time spent. The location of the targets is based on the location of the player at the time of activation; if playing in the countryside, the targets will be much more spread out.\nAssociates in different locations and counties may affect the location of the targets. It is possible, however, to still get a set of countryside targets if the mission is triggered too close to the north edge of Los Santos (specifically the dividing line between the city and &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Hills\"&gt;Vinewood Hills&lt;/a&gt;). If left alone long enough, countryside mobile targets may eventually go into Los Santos, while Los Santos mobile targets may leave the city.\nTargets will either be stationary or moving in an armored vehicle. They will be heavily protected with bodyguards, who are equipped with heavy fire-power weaponry and armor; their accuracy is also buffed, allowing them to cause damage to vehicles and players flying several blocks away. The VIP wears a suit and equips less armor, as well as a handgun. With mobile targets, the driver of the vehicle is the VIP. Three bodyguards are found within the car equipping &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt; to shoot the player. The vehicle can be either a &lt;a href=\"Baller%20LE%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;Baller LE (Armored)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Cognoscenti%2055%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;Cognoscenti 55 (Armored)&lt;/a&gt;. The vehicles and targets are much more durable than in regular gameplay. The vehicles can withstand multiple hits by homing missiles and bodyguards can survive two missile hits and multiple sniper headshots. The actual target, however, can be killed with a single missile or a headshot from any gun.\nAll other players in the lobby are alerted once Headhunter has started and are tasked with protecting the targets marked on the map with blue figures while the enemy organization members are marked with crosshairs. Defenders can work with the target's bodyguards and/or police to defend them. Defending players cannot kill the bodyguards or the target, and friendly fire between players is also turned off; this means players who are defending won't be able to harm one another. Protecting individuals will earn cash and RP if they can successfully protect at least one surviving target from the enemy organization until time runs out.\nHeadhunter Target Locations.\nIn total, there is 39 possible spawn locations for Headhunter Targets across &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;. There is a total of 19 possible stationary target spawn locations; 10 for &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County\"&gt;Los Santos County&lt;/a&gt; and 9 for the countryside. There is a total of 20 possible moving target spawn locations, 10 for each county. The set of possible locations is determined by choice on whether or not the player is within the same region, i.e. 4 targets within Los Santos County will be chosen if the player is already in Los Santos County. The chosen locations within each county is chosen at random, however, and do not depend on the position of the organization members. \nFor each game, there will always be two stationary and two moving targets. The moving targets tend to stay in the area in which they spawned, but there appears to be no scripted route, as they may venture far away from their initial position, even to the opposite end of the map (i.e., a target starting in &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt; could travel down into Los Santos if left alone). The stationary targets will shoot at the attacking organization members as soon as they get near, but moving targets will only become hostile once they are threatened by the player. The stationary targets will not attempt to escape their location, but the moving targets will attempt to flee, including on foot if their vehicle is disabled but they are not killed outright.\nDestroying a target invariably results in a two-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;; the player can continue to attack targets (the level won't go up so long as a police vehicle is not struck), and if not already lost due to time elapsed, the wanted level is automatically removed once the final target is killed.\nMap.\n[[File:Headhunter-GTAO-LocationsMap.gif|thumb|center|400px|Locations of Headhunter targets.

When the player increases in maximum health in \"GTA San Andreas\", the bar is extended and a pop up stating the health increase is shown, whereas in \"Liberty City Stories\" and \"Vice City Stories\", the bar will be marked with a \"+\" symbol on its left. Health increase is no longer possible in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt; games.\nIn , its , and , the health bar comes in the form of a green semi-circular bar, rather than a straight bar, surrounding the left half of the &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt; (in the right half, it is surrounded by the blue &lt;a href=\"body%20armor\"&gt;body armor&lt;/a&gt; bar).\nIn and , the health bar is now a straight bar located below the radar, occupying the left half of the bottom's width (the right half is reserved for either a full blue bar of body armor or split into said blue bar and a yellow bar reserved for the character's &lt;a href=\"Special%20Ability\"&gt;Special Ability&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA V\" or specialized vehicle's functions in \"GTA Online\"). A new mechanic not seen in any previous games is automatic health regeneration. Whenever the player takes damage and health drops below 50%, then they can automatically replenish lost health up to the halfway point but this can only be done if the player's character stands still on the spot and doesn't walk or run. In \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", max health of the character slowly increases every &lt;a href=\"rank\"&gt;rank&lt;/a&gt;, up to rank 100. However, the skill progress indicator is only visible every 20 ranks, similar to other skills. There is no visible indicator though in regards to the health bar, assuming it has the same damage-reducing effect that increasing Strength provides.\nHealth points as a numerical stat are hidden in normal gameplay, but are shown within the game files. For example, a standard &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s base damage is 26 per shot, which subtracts 26 health points from the target. Rank 1-19 players start with a health value of 238, so it would take 10 shots to kill them in the chest with a pistol.\nHealth pickups.\nHealth &lt;a href=\"pickups\"&gt;pickups&lt;/a&gt; scattered around the map can restore the player's health to the maximum level. Between \"Grand Theft Auto 2\" and \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", health pickups are generally shaped as rotating health icon with the symbol of a heart. In \"GTA IV\", health pickups are shaped as medical kits. Health can be also replenished by up to 20% when entering &lt;a href=\"Ambulance\"&gt;Ambulance&lt;/a&gt;s or 40% when entering the &lt;a href=\"Hotdog\"&gt;Hotdog&lt;/a&gt; van in \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nMany things can damage the player's health: being shot, stabbed, or beaten, fire (unless the &lt;a href=\"Firefighter\"&gt;Firefighter&lt;/a&gt; side mission is completed in \"GTA Vice City\", \"GTA San Andreas\", \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\"), explosives, being struck by a vehicle, drowning, being thrown from a &lt;a href=\"vehicle\"&gt;vehicle&lt;/a&gt;, falling from heights, consuming &lt;a href=\"drugs\"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt; or smoking, tumbling, and several other methods not included in this list. When the player's health is completely depleted, the protagonist is considered \"&lt;a href=\"wasted\"&gt;wasted&lt;/a&gt;\", and is then transported to the nearest &lt;a href=\"hospital\"&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt;, after which a fee for healthcare will be assessed, and all weapons will be confiscated in the 2D and 3D Universes. Any mission that may have been in progress at the time is considered as failed.\nHealth can be replenished by picking up a health pickup, employing the services of a &lt;a href=\"prostitute\"&gt;prostitute&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href=\"eating\"&gt;eating&lt;/a&gt; food (in \"GTA Vice City\", \"GTA San Andreas\", \"GTA IV\" and its episodes, \"GTA V\" and \"GTA Online\") or by visiting a &lt;a href=\"Save%20Point\"&gt;save point&lt;/a&gt; to save the game (in all &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; titles, save for \"GTA III\" and , and in all HD Universe titles).\nAccessibility of health pickups varies between games:\nPickup Locations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto III\".\n&lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Vale\"&gt;Shoreside Vale&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\n&lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Beach\"&gt;Ocean Beach&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Washington%20Beach\"&gt;Washington Beach&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Vice%20Point\"&gt;Vice Point&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"North%20Point%20Mall\"&gt;North Point Mall&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Prawn%20Island\"&gt;Prawn Island&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Leaf%20Links\"&gt;Leaf Links&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Starfish%20Island\"&gt;Starfish Island&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vice%20City\"&gt;Downtown&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Little%20Haiti%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Little Haiti&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Little%20Havana%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Little Havana&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Viceport\"&gt;Viceport&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Escobar%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Escobar International Airport&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\n&lt;a href=\"Portland\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Quays\"&gt;Atlantic Quays&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Saint%20Mark%27s\"&gt;Saint Mark's&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Portland%20View\"&gt;Portland View&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Callahan%20Point\"&gt;Callahan Point&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Red%20Light%20District\"&gt;Red Light District&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Chinatown%20%28GTA%20III%29\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Island\"&gt;Staunton Island&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Newport\"&gt;Newport&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Rockford\"&gt;Rockford&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Campus\"&gt;Liberty Campus&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Aspatria\"&gt;Aspatria&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Fort%20Staunton\"&gt;Fort Staunton&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Belleville%20Park\"&gt;Belleville Park&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Bedford%20Point\"&gt;Bedford Point&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Torrington\"&gt;Torrington&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Vale\"&gt;Shoreside Vale&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Francis Intl.

The PlayStation 3 and PC versions were later released on April 13, 2010 in North America and on April 16, 2010 in Europe.\nThe &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fernando%20Lopez\"&gt;Luis Fernando Lopez&lt;/a&gt;, a part-time hoodlum and full-time assistant to legendary nightclub impresario &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Tony Prince&lt;/a&gt;.

All three stories run alongside each other and intertwine at various points.\nSynopsis.\nThe game features Luis Fernando Lopez as the protagonist.\nAt the beginning of the game, we are again taken to the bank heist committed by Niko Bellic, and his henchmen, Derrick and Patrick McReary, and \"Saint\" Michael Keane. However, he is released from the crime scene and starts talking to his boss, Tony \"Gay Tony\" Prince, as he walks almost getting run over by Niko, and soon after, Johnny Klebitz.\nWhen he arrives at Tony's apartment, he meets Rocco Pelosi, who is taking a considerable amount of money from Tony's previous \"loans\" to save Maisonette 9 and Hercules nightclubs. To try to please Rocco, Luis and Tony go to a neighborhood located in Chinatown to negotiate with an oriental criminal. In the same building, Billy Grey, president of The Lost Motorcycle Club, is trying to set a trap for Vice President Johnny Klebitz and Jim Fitzgerald when Luis and Tony enter the room. Negotiations get extremely tense, and Luis eliminates several people in an attempt to save Tony.\nSoon after, we are introduced to Luis' mother, Adriana Yanira \"Mama\" Lopez, who has financial problems and dreams of Luis going to college, his friends Armando Torres and Henrique Bardas, involved in drug trafficking, and his \"boss\", Yusuf Amir, the son of a wealthy real estate businessman based in the UAE, who abuses his father's money and loves to extravagantly show it off. While Luis is carrying out his tasks, Tony comes up with the idea of \u200b\u200bbuying diamonds worth two million dollars, being resold by the cook of the ship Platypus, which Niko arrived on to Liberty City. However, the deal fails because of The Lost MC, during which Johnny kills Evan.\nShortly after the loss of Evan, and the diamonds, Tony introduces Luis to one of the men Tony owes money to, Mori Kibbutz, who constantly ridicules his brother, Brucie. Soon after Luis does his chores for Mori, Tony's debts are forgiven and Brucie finally stands up to his brother punching him in the face. Shortly thereafter, Brucie appears at Maisonette 9 along with Roman Bellic, thanking Luis and tries to kiss him as Luis leaves.\nLuis soon meets Ray Bulgarin, and his partner Timur, who offer a chance for financial aid, in which Luis must perform various tasks, such as killing corrupt federal agents and breaking into buildings, and soon, Ray buys Liberty City Rampage, a local hockey team. Meanwhile, Luis and Tony's friend Grace Ancelotti is kidnapped by Niko and Patrick. The Ancelotti family blames Luis and Tony for her kidnapping, the fact that the diamonds could be in anyone's hands and are in high demand, prompting Luis in desperation to use a helicopter to go to the Libertonian, where he retrieves the diamonds from an unknown person and leaves the scene using the Golden Buzzard, which belongs to Yusuf.\nLater, Bulgarin turns against Luis, believing he was in fact the cook's accomplice, and with Luis then finding the cook's head on the terrace of the building, where Luis has to kill several men.\nGiovanni Ancelotti, Grace's father, soon appears, demanding that the diamonds be exchanged for his daughter and be the payment of her ransom. Luis and Tony rescue her, however, Niko and Patrick are nearly killed by Bulgarin's men, and the diamonds end up in a dump truck because of Bulgarin's oversight, who flees the scene. Tony fails to pay taxes for Maisonette 9 and Hercules, and both are shut down by Liberty City Hall, and Rocco, and his partner Vince, believe Luis should kill Tony, as the Russians and Ancelottis will likely kill them both if he doesn't.\nLuis gives Tony a scare, who thinks he would be killed in front of the mobsters, however, Luis kills the mobsters at Maisonette 9 instead. Luis then goes to Firefly Island to kill Bulgarin and Timur, and soon after, to Francis International Airport, where Yusuf helps by killing several of Bulgarin's men before arriving at the airport.\nWhen he gets there, Bulgarin's plane is about to take off, and Luis chases him on a motorcycle, jumping on the plane's door. The plane takes off, and Luis kills several of Bulgarin's men and himself, however, Bulgarin had a grenade that would be activated if Luis shot him, causing the plane to destroy itself in midair and turn into a \"fireball\".\nIn the final scenes, Luis and Tony talk, where Luis inadvertently drops the diamonds when he bumps into a homeless man, with the same homeless man then appearing in a mansion full of girls in the post-credit scenes.\nAnother important set of characters, though they do not affect the main storyline, are the fictional celebrities met in the &lt;a href=\"Club%20Management\"&gt;Club Management&lt;/a&gt; missions. Luis and Tony are made the peers and trusted confidants of extremely powerful celebrities. Beyond the comic value of pop culture, it is meant to portray opportunity raining from the sky for Tony and Luis, some of which might lure them to abandon or endanger each other.\nStory.\nLuis Fernando Lopez is being &lt;a href=\"Three%20Leaf%20Clover\"&gt;held hostage at the Bank of Liberty&lt;/a&gt;, during &lt;a href=\"Three%20Leaf%20Clover\"&gt;a robbery&lt;/a&gt; involving &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Bellic\"&gt;Niko Bellic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20McReary\"&gt;Patrick McReary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Derrick%20McReary\"&gt;Derrick McReary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Keane\"&gt;Michael Keane&lt;/a&gt;. A local gun club member lying next to him, &lt;a href=\"Eugene%20Reaper\"&gt;Eugene Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, shoots and kills Keane and is then killed by the McReary brothers in retaliation. The scene cuts to the aftermath of the robbery; Luis is being questioned by the police about the incident before proceeding to Gay Tony's loft. On the way, he is nearly run over by Niko Bellic (returning from the robbery) and &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;, who rides past him. &lt;a href=\"Rocco%20Pelosi\"&gt;Rocco Pelosi&lt;/a&gt;, a senior &lt;a href=\"Ancelotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Ancelotti&lt;/a&gt; mobster, and his accomplice &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Vince\"&gt;Vince&lt;/a&gt; enter the loft and collect Tony's club income for the week as interest repayment on an outstanding loan. Tony then discusses with Luis his dire financial situation with his two clubs, &lt;a href=\"Maisonette%209\"&gt;Maisonette 9&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hercules\"&gt;Hercules&lt;/a&gt;. In an attempt to curry favor with Rocco, Tony and Luis go &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Takeout\"&gt;to Chinatown to negotiate a deal with a senior Triad&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Grey\"&gt;Billy Grey&lt;/a&gt;, President of The Lost Motorcycle Gang is seen &lt;a href=\"This%20Shit%27s%20Cursed\"&gt;arranging an ambush&lt;/a&gt; on Johnny Klebitz and &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;Jim Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; with the Triad as Tony and Luis enter the room. The negotiations with the Triad soon turn awry, and Luis protects Tony as they escape Chinatown.\nLuis visits &lt;a href=\"Adriana%20Yanira%20Lopez\"&gt;his mother&lt;/a&gt;, who also has financial issues, and his childhood friends &lt;a href=\"Henrique%20Bardas\"&gt;Henrique Bardas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Armando%20Torres\"&gt;Armando Torres&lt;/a&gt;. Luis' mother does not approve of his lifestyle and would like him to attend to college. Henrique and Armando are Luis' friends who are heavily involved with the narcotics distribution trade. Luis soon becomes acquainted with &lt;a href=\"Yusuf%20Amir\"&gt;Yusuf Amir&lt;/a&gt;, a real estate developer in Liberty City. Luis helps Yusuf acquire several vehicles, &lt;a href=\"Sexy%20Time\"&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; an experimental military grade chopper called the \"&lt;a href=\"Buzzard\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt;\", an &lt;a href=\"APC\"&gt;APC&lt;/a&gt; used by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"For%20the%20Man%20Who%20Has%20Everything\"&gt;even a subway carriage&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeanwhile, Tony is headed in a downward spiral due to substance abuse, supplied by his boyfriend &lt;a href=\"Evan%20Moss\"&gt;Evan Moss&lt;/a&gt;. Luis, Tony and Evan &lt;a href=\"Frosting%20on%20the%20Cake\"&gt;head to the docks to buy $2 million worth of diamonds&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"The%20Cook\"&gt;cook&lt;/a&gt; coming in on a tanker called the \"&lt;a href=\"Platypus\"&gt;Platypus&lt;/a&gt;\". During the exchange, members of The Lost (now led by &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Klebitz\"&gt;Johnny Klebitz&lt;/a&gt;, formerly Billy Grey) &lt;a href=\"Diamonds%20in%20the%20Rough\"&gt;attack and kill Evan and acquire the diamonds&lt;/a&gt;. Tony promises Luis that he will quit the substance abuse and introduces Luis to &lt;a href=\"Mori%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Mori Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt;, and his younger brother &lt;a href=\"Brucie%20Kibbutz\"&gt;Brucie&lt;/a&gt;. Mori is highly egotistical, constantly bullies and belittles Brucie and is a source of irritation to Luis, who repeatedly stands up for Brucie. Through entering &lt;a href=\"Triathlon%20%28The%20Ballad%20of%20Gay%20Tony%29\"&gt;Triathlons&lt;/a&gt; and undertaking &lt;a href=\"No.%203\"&gt;dangerous police chases&lt;/a&gt;, Luis eventually managed to cancel Tony's debt to Mori. After Brucie finally retaliates and punches Mori, he later shows up at Maisonette 9 to thank Luis. Brucie leans in towards Luis after a series of compliments, strongly implying an attempt to hit on him. Luis strongly declines, and Brucie awkwardly attempts to convince Luis that he was just testing him to see if he was gay.\nTony and Luis meet &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Bulgarin\"&gt;Ray Bulgarin&lt;/a&gt; and his associate &lt;a href=\"Timur\"&gt;Timur&lt;/a&gt; at Maisonette 9, who offer Luis some work in exchange for financial help. Luis helps Bulgarin &lt;a href=\"Going%20Deep\"&gt;eliminate some corrupt federal agents&lt;/a&gt; and acquire the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Rampage\"&gt;Liberty City Rampage&lt;/a&gt; hockey team. Gracie Ancelotti gets Tony back on the drugs and is later &lt;a href=\"I%27ll%20Take%20Her\"&gt;kidnapped&lt;/a&gt; by unknown assailants. The Ancelottis establish that Gracie has been kidnapped because of the &lt;a href=\"diamonds\"&gt;diamonds&lt;/a&gt; and are pointing the blame at Tony and Luis. Tony learns that the diamonds are &lt;a href=\"Museum%20Piece\"&gt;being exchanged&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"The%20Libertonian\"&gt;The Libertonian&lt;/a&gt; and sends Luis to &lt;a href=\"Not%20So%20Fast\"&gt;retrieve them&lt;/a&gt;. Luis ambushes the exchange (involving Niko Bellic and Johnny Klebitz) and escapes in the Buzzard, which has since been gold plated.\nBulgarin phones Luis, telling him to go to the roof of a building in midtown Algonquin. As Luis uncovers the severed head of the cook from the \"Platypus\", Bulgarin explains that the diamonds belong to him and accuses the cook, Luis and Tony of colluding to steal them. It emerges that Bulgarin has led Luis &lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Crosshairs\"&gt;to an ambush on the rooftop&lt;/a&gt;, and he escapes alive. Gracie\u2019s father, Giovanni Ancelotti, then orders Luis and Tony to &lt;a href=\"Ladies%20Half%20Price\"&gt;trade the diamonds with the kidnappers and get Gracie back&lt;/a&gt;. At the exchange, Bulgarin shows up and orders his men to attack the assailants, Packie McReary and Niko Bellic. Bulgarin flees the scene and amidst the chaos the diamonds fall into a dump truck heading in the opposite direction. Luis, Tony and Gracie escape in a speedboat.\nBecause of being preoccupied with recent events, Tony defaults on his debts and the city closes down all of his clubs as a result. Luis meets Rocco and Vince in the restrooms in Middle Park, and they explain &lt;a href=\"Party%27s%20Over\"&gt;to him that he must kill Tony, or the Ancelottis and Russians will team up and kill Tony, Luis and all of their friends and family&lt;/a&gt;. Luis shows up at Maisonette 9 and contemplates shooting Tony, before pointing the gun at Vince and shooting him in the head. Tony warns Luis not to shoot Rocco, as he is a \"made man\". Rocco escapes and the Russians show up ensuing in a huge gunfight within the club. Tony blames Luis for contemplating killing him and flees to his apartment to pack and move to the desert. Luis convinces Tony that he chose not to kill him because it is them against the world, and that they need to resolve their situation. Luis ventures to Firefly Island &lt;a href=\"Departure%20Time\"&gt;to ambush a Russian heroin exchange&lt;/a&gt;, telling Tony to hide out by &lt;a href=\"the%20Monoglobe\"&gt;the Monoglobe&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Meadows%20Park\"&gt;Meadows Park&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the fairground, Luis destroys the heroin and kills Timur, who mentions that Bulgarin is fleeing the city by plane within two hours. After an opportune phone conversation, Yusuf shows up in the Buzzard and eliminates the pursuing Russians while Luis drives to the airport. Luis manages to board the plane and kills all of the henchmen on board. A vengeful Bulgarin emerges from the cockpit holding a grenade, threatening to blow the plane up if Luis kills him. Luis takes the risk and shoots Bulgarin, who drops the grenade, which becomes live and explodes. Luis parachutes out of the burning wreckage of the plane to safety, and heads to Meadows Park where Tony is waiting. Once there, they both tell Yusuf that they will not franchise the clubs since they prefer to keep it a \"family business\".\nAs for the diamonds, they in the end are found by &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Kapowitz\"&gt;a homeless man&lt;/a&gt; next to a trash can after Luis accidentally runs into him on his way to meet Tony in Meadows Park.\nDevelopment.\n\"The Lost and Damned\" and \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" were first announced during Microsoft's 2006 E3 press conference on 9 May 2006. Peter Moore, then head of Microsoft's Interactive Entertainment Business division, described downloadable content as \"epic episode packs\", and not just an extra car or character. A press release during the conference said that the expansion packs, both \"The Lost and Damned\" and \"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" would add \"hours of entirely new gameplay\" to the game, with &lt;a href=\"Jeronimo%20Barrera\"&gt;Jeronimo Barrera&lt;/a&gt;, Vice-President of Product Development for &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt;, explaining that the episodes were experiments because they were not sure that there were enough users with access to online content on the Xbox 360. &lt;a href=\"Take-Two%20Interactive\"&gt;Take-Two Interactive&lt;/a&gt;'s chief financial officer, Lainie Goldstein, revealed that Microsoft was paying a total of $50 million for the first two episodes.\nReception.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: The Ballad of Gay Tony\" received positive reviews from critics and fans alike.\n\"Metacritic\" awarded the Xbox 360 version with 89/100, while the PlayStation 3 version received a slightly lower 87/100.\n\"IGN\" awarded the expansion pack with 9.2/10.\n\"Eurogamer\" awarded the expansion pack with 8/10. Tom Bramwell of \"Eurogamer\" praised the characters, the new vehicles and weapons, and the mission design. However, he criticized the racism in the first few hours of the game and the shotty controls, ending his review with the statement: \"Perhaps Tony Prince does nothing to drag the series forward - somewhat fittingly for a man with his head stuck in the eighties - but the episode Rockstar has named in his honour is a colourful and pleasingly unpredictable adventure that gets better throughout and ends on a high note.\"\n\"The Ballad of Gay Tony\" was awarded the Best DLC award at the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards.\n\"Complex\" awarded &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Prince\"&gt;Anthony \"Gay Tony\" Prince&lt;/a&gt; as the coolest LGBT video game character in their 2013 list, referring to him as \"the hot mess of the \"GTA\" series\""}

The player can hit them in any order they choose, however, in order to maximize efficiency, it is generally recommended to hit the banks in this order:\nIf signal jammers were planted at the first and second bank during and are robbed by the player first, the player will have two minutes before they receive a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. The process of robbing a Fleeca branch is rather straightforward: the player is directed to walk into the bank, equip their chosen mask, head for the vault in the back, place a thermal charge on the vault door, and gather the marked bills sitting out on the center counter into a duffel bag.\nThe player's mask can only be equipped inside the bank. Once placed, the thermal charge will take about 15 seconds to burn through the lock, after which the player can just push through the door. Taking the bills uses the same function as clearing items from a cart in &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20Heist\"&gt;The Diamond Casino Heist&lt;/a&gt; or a table in &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist\"&gt;The Cayo Perico Heist&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the player is at the second bank or leaving it, they will gain a three-star wanted level and the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County%20Sheriff\"&gt;LSSD&lt;/a&gt; will start to pursue the player and surround Fleeca branches each time the player goes into a new branch. The player can repeat the process they were doing before; however, each time they exit the bank, they will have to take out the police surrounding the bank before advancing onto the next Fleeca branch.\nUpon robbing the sixth &amp; final branch, the player will gain a five-star wanted level. The player must lose the cops before showing up at the drop-off point with the client, which will be located either at &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo%27s%20Lock-up\"&gt;Martin Madrazo's Lock-up&lt;/a&gt; or at the &lt;a href=\"Route%2068\"&gt;Route 68&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ammu-Nation\"&gt;Ammu-Nation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Discount%20Store\"&gt;Discount Store&lt;/a&gt;.

It is also the penultimate mission in the storyline.\nThe player steals a total of &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;201,600,000 for the Obvious, or $201,300,000 for the Subtle.\nPreparation.\nIn order to perform the heist, the protagonists must perform a couple of side-missions (&lt;a href=\"Heist%20Setups\"&gt;Heist Setups&lt;/a&gt;) to get the necessary equipment. The preparation missions varies based on the chosen approach in &lt;a href=\"Planning%20the%20Big%20Score\"&gt;Planning the Big Score&lt;/a&gt;.\nSubtle.\nThe subtle approach consists of four preparation missions:\nObvious.\nThree preparation missions:\nMission.\nThe mission can be carried out in two ways - a subtle approach, consisting of disguising as Gruppe Sechs guards, loading trucks with the gold and fleeing the city in tuned muscle cars, or an obvious approach, requiring the team to drill into the vault, break out with the gold, and fly it out of the city with helicopters to meet a train.\nSubtle.\nGet in the car after the cutscenes. Drive to the &lt;a href=\"Integrity%20Way\"&gt;tunnel&lt;/a&gt; before 8:00 am. The time is shown on the lower right corner of the screen. After getting to the tunnel, wait for two &lt;a href=\"Stockade\"&gt;Stockade&lt;/a&gt;s to enter the tunnel. Drop a &lt;a href=\"Spike%20Strip\"&gt;Spike Strip&lt;/a&gt; or Stinger before the vans leave, then drive away and wait for them to hit the spikes.\nThe vans' tires have deflated and stopped. Get out of the car and start aiming at the windows of the vans. The occupants will be forced to get out of their vans as hostages. Another van will appear, and requested to change the tires. &lt;a href=\"Gruppe%20Sechs\"&gt;Gruppe Sechs&lt;/a&gt; officer &lt;a href=\"Casey\"&gt;Casey&lt;/a&gt; will be forced to ride in the vans in order to support them. Drive to the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Depository\"&gt;Union Depository&lt;/a&gt; building's underground garage, and they will park the Securicars in reverse. A cutscene will show the &lt;a href=\"Bank%20Manager\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; requesting an authorization ID. It was successful, now follow the manager to an elevator going down to the carts containing the gold. Trevor and Casey will push the carts back to the Securicars. \nGet in the second van and follow Trevor as he gets out of the Depository. However, when Michael calls Franklin, it turns out that &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt; had witnessed them stealing the gold. The player is switched to Franklin, who is using a laptop to control the traffic lights of the district to help Michael and Trevor escape from the Merryweather troops. Control the traffic lights using the assigned buttons and stop Merryweather from spotting them by turning the lights to red. The mission will fail if the Merryweather vans catch them. Depending on the &lt;a href=\"Hacking\"&gt;hacker&lt;/a&gt; skill, there either won't be lag on the changes (if &lt;a href=\"Paige%20Harris\"&gt;Paige Harris&lt;/a&gt; is chosen) or there will be 2 seconds (if &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Feltz\"&gt;Christian Feltz&lt;/a&gt; is chosen) or 4 seconds of lag (if &lt;a href=\"Rickie%20Lukens\"&gt;Rickie Lukens&lt;/a&gt; is chosen). However, should Christian or Rickie have any past experience, the lag will be decreased (2 seconds per experience). Change them less than 10 times to get closer to a gold medal.\nNow they have parked the Securicars. They will open the doors to transfer the packs of gold to four modified &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet\"&gt;Gauntlet&lt;/a&gt;s. The crew also decides on what to do with Casey, and ultimately decides to bribe him with a gold bar, making the take $300,000 less, but it ensures he doesn't speak. However, the Merryweather troops show up. This engages a massive shootout. The protagonists will have to protect the crew while they transfer the gold from the Securicars to the Gauntlets, depending of the experience of the first gunman and the first driver, they may let some of the gold bars drop while loading the cars (if &lt;a href=\"Karim%20Denz\"&gt;Karim Denz&lt;/a&gt; is chosen as the first driver), making the crew lose almost $18 million of the total score. This can be avoided by working with Karim in any previous heist. Keep focused on cover and try switching characters in order for a better shootout. Choose the best weapons, because there are many of them. Keep in mind that the security outfits that Michael and Trevor have on from the beginning will have a full &lt;a href=\"body%20armor\"&gt;body armor&lt;/a&gt; bar, making it somewhat easier. Be careful if switching to Franklin - he'll have no armor unless the player bought some for him ahead of time and haven't done anything to damage it.\nOnce all the Merryweather mercenaries have been killed, the player is again switched to Franklin, who will be driving one of the Gauntlets. The player must now follow the rest of the crew. Focus on the route and ignore the LSPD. The mission will fail if Franklin falls too far behind and loses the others. After driving onto &lt;a href=\"Rockford%20Plaza\"&gt;Rockford Plaza&lt;/a&gt;, the scene will slow down, showing a tanker truck in the verge of explosion after a &lt;a href=\"Vapid\"&gt;Vapid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Interceptor\"&gt;Interceptor&lt;/a&gt; rolls over and crashes the tank (at this very point if an inexperienced Karim is chosen to drive the fourth Gauntlet, he ends up crashing his Gauntlet thus pulled out by the police and ending up incarcerated, losing a quarter of the gold, however Franklin can save him by killing the police officers who blocked the driver's path and the driver will continue by himself). After going to the freeway, a LSPD Maverick shows up. Ignore it and focus on the road. Drive to two trailers waiting for the four Gauntlets. Depending on the driver for Franklin's trailer, it could swerve side to side, making it harder to get in if their skill is poor but Franklin's special ability can help with this. The mission fails if the player doesn't get in before the end of the tunnel. The LSPD failed to arrest them thanks to the two trailers. \nThe three will enter a &lt;a href=\"Cavalcade\"&gt;Cavalcade&lt;/a&gt;. Drive to &lt;a href=\"De%20Santa%20Residence\"&gt;Michael's house&lt;/a&gt;. Mission complete. Regardless of the outcome all three enter a massive argument that supposedly leaves them on bitter terms despite the victory.\nObvious.\nDrive the &lt;a href=\"Oracle\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; to the Union Depository with the gunman assigned. The player then takes control of Franklin, who is outside the underground vault in an &lt;a href=\"HVY\"&gt;HVY&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cutter\"&gt;Cutter&lt;/a&gt;. Michael and the other gunman will come at the front door and distract the cops. Use the drills by pressing a button to create a huge opening on the bank vault. When the hole is created, park the Cutter an ample distance away. Plant explosive charges (such as &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Bombs\"&gt;Sticky Bombs&lt;/a&gt;) on the two vault doors, then stand back and detonate them. A &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tactical%20Response%20Unit\"&gt;TRU&lt;/a&gt; team arrives and starts abseiling into the tunnel. Defend the gunman assigned against the NOOSE team by shooting at them while the gunman pushes the gold carts. Focus on the officers, and use a good gun like an &lt;a href=\"Advanced%20Rifle\"&gt;Advanced Rifle&lt;/a&gt; with extended ammo to eliminate the enemies faster. A &lt;a href=\"minigun\"&gt;minigun&lt;/a&gt; may be helpful as well due to its rapid-fire damage and no need for reloading. After the gunman pushes the second cart into position, the player is switched to Trevor. Fly north of Los Santos to Blaine County, the gunman with Franklin will find his own way out, and the game will prompt the player to switch to Michael. Michael is in a heavy shootout against the cops. Focus on health and ammo, as there are too many officers to fight, and may take 10 minutes of gunfighting. Keep on killing them, as Franklin will become available again when Michael arrives at the foot bridge. While advancing, a &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt; will appear. Destroy it quickly with the RPG or minigun, as it will use the rockets to kill the team. After destroying it, advance to the underground parking lot where the getaway vehicle was stashed while fending off the police. (Note: the police spawn infinitely, so the player cannot kill every police officer they see; listen to audio cues from Franklin or Michael (depending on who the player is \"not\" controlling at the time) to know when the player is able to move on.)\nIn the parking lot, a NOOSE team will appear, in their &lt;a href=\"FIB%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;Grangers&lt;/a&gt;. Destroy the vehicles quickly with an RPG, grenades or sticky bombs (be careful not to hit the getaway vehicle). After killing them, get in the car (it's recommended to switch to Franklin first, to take advantage of his driving ability) and lose the police. If the player followed Lester's advice and modified the vehicle, it should take quite a bit of punishment. A 5-star wanted level may take about 1-2 minutes of cooling down, so hiding underground in places such as the sewers or subways would probably work best. \nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt; is cleared, the scene switches to Trevor, who is piloting his helicopter. Follow the pilot assigned. However, Merryweather Security appears in helicopters, and Lester must destroy them. Keep the helicopter steady for Lester to get a clean shot but be careful not to let both gold carts under the helicopters detach, or have Trevor &lt;a href=\"wasted\"&gt;wasted&lt;/a&gt;, or else the mission will fail and be careful going through the &lt;a href=\"RON%20Alternates%20Wind%20Farm\"&gt;wind farm&lt;/a&gt;. The other gold helicopter will speed up considerably so the player will need to do this while maintaining speed and altitude. Destroy the choppers too late, and the pilot of the other gold helicopter will crash and the mission will fail (an inexperienced Karim Denz will crash even if you manage to destroy the choppers, so work with Karim beforehand to prevent him from crashing or have him drive the train.) After destroying the helicopters, locate the train on the radar and detach the gold cart in the train car. Finally, fly to &lt;a href=\"McKenzie%20Field%20Hangar\"&gt;McKenzie Field Hangar&lt;/a&gt; to complete the mission.\nIf Karim crashes, the mission can still be completed losing half of the score provided that the Merryweather helicopters were destroyed; the mission only fails if Trevor is &lt;a href=\"wasted\"&gt;wasted&lt;/a&gt; or if his own gold cart is dropped by accident or if he crashes or if the other pilot crashes due to the presence of the undestroyed enemy helicopters. However, if the final gold tally is important, the player may need to reload a save prior to \"&lt;a href=\"Planning%20the%20Big%20Score\"&gt;Planning the Big Score&lt;/a&gt;\" and choose an alternate pilot instead of Karim. \nAfter the gold has been dropped off, both Trevor and Lester will fly to the McKenzie Field Hangar to meet with the rest of the crew for a debrief. Lester is in good spirits for the entire ride and has obviously never been so thrilled his entire life. For the debrief everyone else is in good spirits as well contrary to the meeting in the Subtle Method. Michael then proceeds to break the mood and soon after tells the crew to avoid spending large amounts of cash until the gold is sold with Trevor restating in a more aggressive matter. The cutscene ends with Michael, Trevor and Lester flying away to the new location of the gold; Franklin departing in his new getaway vehicle and the hired crew members flying away in the second helicopter.\nHowever, should the pilot crew member die, and half the gold is lost, a different ending cutscene will play instead. While Michael, Franklin and the gunman are initially jovial at the success of their heist, they become sullen upon being notified by Trevor of the death of their second pilot and the loss of half the stolen gold. The crew becomes disappointed and angry with their loss. The cutscene then ends with Michael, Trevor and Lester flying away to the gold's new location, while Franklin and the gunman drive away in the new getaway vehicle.\nAfter the Heist.\nRegardless of which option is chosen, or the outcome (loot-wise), after the mission, a mission trigger point is placed over Franklin's home. Once there, Franklin is visited by &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt;, who orders him to kill Michael. Franklin refuses, telling him &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Haines\"&gt;Steve Haines&lt;/a&gt; has already ordered him to kill Trevor and that he cannot kill both. Devin reiterates his order to kill Michael and leaves. The player, as Franklin, then has the option to choose which option they want, beginning one of the final missions: &lt;a href=\"Something%20Sensible\"&gt;Something Sensible&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Time%27s%20Come\"&gt;The Time's Come&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;The Third Way&lt;/a&gt;. Note that Lester will not pay the protagonists the proceeds of this heist until after the final mission is completed.\nWarning.\nBefore going to the last mission trigger, it is advisable to complete any remaining side-missions, etc. that may be required for &lt;a href=\"100%25%20Completion%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;100% completion&lt;/a&gt; first as, depending on the player's choice, Michael or Trevor may no longer be available beyond this point, thereby rendering any activities/side missions specific to them inaccessible (however, their missions are not required for 100% completion). If Michael or Trevor possess any rare vehicle the player doesn't wish to lose, cars should also be exchanged before starting the final mission. Unless the player has already completed everything else (except Lester's assassination missions and other Franklin-specific side-quests that may be saved until after the storyline and still count towards 100% completion), they must be careful not to take Franklin to his safehouse so as not to trigger the endgame.\nRevenue.\nThe take from this score dwarfs everything else in the game, potentially rewarding over 40 million dollars for each protagonist, so it is essential here more than in any other heist to make the correct choices at the planning stage; poor choices may reduce the profits of each protagonist by as much as ~75%.\nMaximum Revenue.\nThe Obvious approach is significantly more lucrative, able to net ~$6 million more per protagonist, as it requires a smaller and less expensive crew. Use Taliana Martinez (5%) and Karim Denz (8%) as the drivers; if Karim is inexperienced, he must be chosen as Driver 2, or else he'll be responsible for losing 50% of the take and cause a casualty. Then go cheap on the gunmen, with Daryl Johns (6%) and either Norm Richards or Hugh Welsh (7%); if one of them gained experience from &lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;The Bureau Raid&lt;/a&gt;, they should be chosen as Gunman 2 in order to accompany Michael.\nHowever, the Subtle approach is still viable, despite inherent higher costs such as &lt;a href=\"Casey\"&gt;Casey&lt;/a&gt;'s bribe and potentially ~$70k spent on the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet%20%28mission%29\"&gt;getaway vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. Again, use Taliana Martinez (5%) and Karim Denz (8%) as the drivers; if Karim is inexperienced, he must be chosen as Driver 2, or else he'll be responsible for losing ~30% of the total take and cause a casualty. For gunmen, use Packie/Chef (12%) and Daryl Johns (6%); Gunman 1 could instead be a poor gunman, which leads to a 9% forfeiture of the take, though also saves 5% in crew cut, which nearly equalizes profits. Lastly, a hacker is required, with Rickie Lukens (4%) being suitable, even if he's inexperienced.\nMinimum Revenue.\nRegarding the Obvious approach, a successful failure comes down to the first helicopter crashing after fleeing the city (50% lost). This is guaranteed to happen simply by utilizing a poor Driver 1, no matter who else is selected; using (inexperienced) Karim, Eddie, Gus, and Packie/Chef.\nAlternatively, one potential successful failure in regards to the Subtle approach involves inefficient loading of the Guantlets (poor Driver 1 and Gunman 1; 9%/ea. lost), as well as one of the Gauntlets later crashing (poor Driver 1; 25% lost), even if the rest of the crew are capable. However, choosing a good Gunman 1, in order to save 9% of the take, actually costs the protagonists more, by increasing the crew cut by at least 4%; using (inexperienced) Karim, Eddie, Gus, Packie/Chef, and Paige.\nAftermath.\nWeazel News (Radio).\n\"\"Gold prices spike as U.S. reserves take another hit.

It is the heist finale of the Act 2 of &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Heist\"&gt;The Doomsday Heist&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nAfter collecting the necessary data and the corresponding vehicles, the crew is ready to get into the &lt;a href=\"Ramius\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt; and eliminate &lt;a href=\"Bogdan\"&gt;Bogdan&lt;/a&gt;.\nMission.\nThe crew splits into two teams: Submarine Team, which uses the &lt;a href=\"Stromberg%20%28car%29\"&gt;Stromberg&lt;/a&gt; submersible car and the Air Support team, which assists them in the &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt; tilt-rotor aircraft.\nThe Air Support have to get into the Avenger and fly above the location of the submarine. The gunners must stay alert for any enemy &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt; once the submarine team gets into the vessel. At times, &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;FH-1 Hunter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Savage\"&gt;Savage&lt;/a&gt; attack choppers may also spawn.\nThe Submarine Team have to get into the Stromberg and move to the submarine' aft access hatch to get inside. They have to find the contact who is in the brig, while fighting off the enemy agents. Through the radio, the vessel commander, &lt;a href=\"Bogdan\"&gt;Bogdan&lt;/a&gt;, reveals himself, warning that they are making a terrible mistake and that they are a rogue unit operating outside State sanction, claiming they are \"fighting for humanity\".\nOnce the team find him, they have to make him talk to get the information, which he tells the network runs through point on the center console of the bridge (main control room). &lt;a href=\"Avon%20Hertz\"&gt;Avon&lt;/a&gt; orders the team to document everything with the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;Mobile Phone&lt;/a&gt; and then plugging &lt;a href=\"Cliffford\"&gt;Cliffford&lt;/a&gt; into the console.\nAfter plugging Cliffford into the console, a cutscene is triggered for the Submarine Team, where Bogdan shows up demanding a minute to speak about his intentions, even while being held gunpoint by the crew and &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester&lt;/a&gt; ordering them to kill him. Bogdan explains that he is here to help solve \"the real problem\", accusing the crew of doing dirty work for Avon and his AI, wanting to kill each other to \"play god\". Suddenly, Avon speaks through the radio, which reveals his true intentions and betrays everyone, while Cliffford activates a self-destruct sequence on the submarine, forcing Bogdan and the crew to leave the submarine before it explodes.\nThe Air Support team only hears the conversation through the radio, while still defending the area from enemy aircraft.\nBack to control, the submarine team have to leave the sub while the Air Support team needs to pick them up, as the Stromberg went down with the submarine. A lot of &lt;a href=\"Cliffford%20Mercenaries\"&gt;mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dubsta%206x6\"&gt;Dubsta 6x6&lt;/a&gt; SUVs will appear on the nearest beach and &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie%20MOD.0\"&gt;Valkyrie MOD.0&lt;/a&gt; gunships, forcing the Air Support team to get rid of them. Lester, utterly angered, figures out &lt;a href=\"Bogdan%27s%20Crew\"&gt;the Russians&lt;/a&gt; were after the AI and that he is worried how Avon got such a large army. He is more worried that Cliffford got the IAA's network, stating he will do a lot with it. On the mission, more Buzzard Attack Choppers will arrive to take out the Avenger, but the team manages to escape. The crew have to fly to the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt; and land on &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt;'s hangar to complete the mission.\nEnding.\nAfter the crew leaves the Avenger, Lester arrived at the hangar, still irritated by the situation, admitting he hated successful people and that the person who he just wanted to be nice ended up with him wanting to destroy humanity. &lt;a href=\"Agent%2014\"&gt;Agent 14&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Phoenicia%20Rackman\"&gt;Phoenicia Rackman&lt;/a&gt; shows up, with Agent 14 angered by having his career ruined, but Rackman says that the planet will be in ruins if they do not do something, alleging full authority. Lester asks if they can get paid with an excuse of pension contributions, which Rackman replies promising \"significant ones\". After the conversation ends, Lester says to the crew that \"between them they are completely fucked\" and that makes him angry again. He then tells that they have to meet at the facility for a plan, before getting into his &lt;a href=\"Asea\"&gt;Asea&lt;/a&gt;, ending the cutscene and finishing Act 2."}

Michael poses as the janitor and places bombs in two rooms. Two preparation missions have to be completed:\nRoof.\nThere are no heist setup missions required for this approach. The crew land on the building from a chopper and escape after shooting several agents.\nMission.\nIf playing as Michael, the player\u00a0arrives at the garment factory in time to see &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; preparing to torch the place, having decided that completing the upcoming FIB raid will result in the need to find a new base of operations.\nDepending on the chosen approach in Architect's Plans, the mission will play out in either of two ways:\nCovert (Fire Crew).\nAs Michael, the player drives to the FIB Building on\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Pillbox%20Hill\"&gt;Pillbox Hill&lt;/a&gt;. While driving, Michael will call Franklin to prepare a fire truck and the assigned crew members. After arriving at the headquarters, Michael enters the building and shows the security guard &lt;a href=\"Harvey%20Molina\"&gt;Harvey Molina&lt;/a&gt;'s ID. He is granted entry and heads up to the 49th floor.\nOn the 49th floor, the player must reach the maintenance room, pick up the mop and bucket of water, and clean the office. The spots to be cleaned are indicated in red on the map. For a Gold medal, this section must be completed within 3 minutes. After that, Michael plants a bomb in an open locker. He heads to the next room and mops the floor. There are 4 dirty sections. It will take quite a while, especially on the far side of the room. Then, another bomb is planted in the restroom. Michael picks up the mop and bucket, and returns them to the maintenance room. Michael leaves the building.\nMichael will call Franklin, who is now in a fire truck, and will inform him that the charges are set. Pick him up from Pillbox Hill. Before driving, open up the cellphone, then in Contacts select \"Detonate\".\nAfter a &lt;a href=\"cutscene\"&gt;cutscene&lt;/a&gt; shows the top floors of the building exploding, the player, as Franklin, drives the fire truck to the FIB building. The crew will be in firemen gear when they get out. Enter the building, ignoring the people standing there. Upon disembarking on the 47th floor, the player will\u00a0have a limited supply of oxygen, so they should run fast and carefully. The player should then follow their\u00a0crew up to the 53rd floor, which contains the target: a hard drive. The player should then move to the server room, which they\u00a0will find locked. The player will be prompted to plant explosives on the door and blow it up, then to\u00a0approach the mainframe and steal the hard drive.\nAs Franklin, the player should follow Michael and the rest of the crew out of the building. Focus on running, ignoring the falling glass. As the crew go downstairs, the building behind shall collapse. Follow the crew to an alternate route by a locked door. Just after your crew breaks the door, a backdraft is opened and results in an explosion; if you selected two unskilled gunmen in your crew, the former dies and the latter survives. if there's one unskilled and one skilled in your crew, the unskilled will die.\u00a0However, if both of the gunmen are skilled, the explosion will just knock one unconscious. Help him up or confirm his death and keep moving, watching your oxygen supply as you go. The player must ignore the breaking pieces of stones and keep running. An opening is seen- go down and be careful not to fall. While running, a sudden explosion knocks Franklin unconscious. After waking up, the crew is a floor below him, with some FIB agents after Franklin. The agents are aware that the crew aren't firemen. They will start shooting at Franklin with pistols and should be killed.\u00a0\nThe player must now run to the elevator shaft and rappel down. The game will instruct the player\u00a0on how to do this. The player should watch out for falling objects as they rappel down. After rappelling, the player needs to leave the building and get inside the fire truck. For a Gold medal, the elevator shaft must be crossed within 30 seconds. Also, the player must have at least 40% of oxygen in the tank.\nOnce outside the building, several &lt;a href=\"Police%20Cruiser\"&gt;Police Cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s will be surrounding the area, along with several &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ambulances&lt;/a&gt;. A crowd of pedestrians will also be outside the building. Unlike the Roof approach, regular ambient traffic spawns. The crew quickly change to their original clothes to avoid being suspected later for the incident.\nThe crew then leaves to the getaway location (the location where the getaway vehicle was parked during the heist setup mission).\nThe player needs to destroy the fire truck after getting out and flee the scene. Finally, the player is instructed to go to Lester's house, avoiding the police or Michael's \"dear friend\" &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;. The crew reach Lester's house, while the gunmen (or gunman) leave. Lester comments that he did not expect to see the \"clowns\" again. Lester, Michael and Franklin celebrate with alcohol, while Michael leaves after few minutes.\nRoof.\nFranklin arrives during Michael and Lester's discussion, and Michael and Franklin soon depart for the &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Headquarters\"&gt;NOOSE Headquarters&lt;/a&gt; (government facility) near\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Tataviam%20Mountains\"&gt;Tataviam Mountains&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and off &lt;a href=\"Palomino%20Freeway\"&gt;Palomino Freeway&lt;/a&gt;. After heading to the NOOSE building, time advances to late midnight. The &lt;a href=\"Haines%27%20pilot\"&gt;pilot&lt;/a&gt;, gunman and Franklin get in the helicopter, while the player controls Michael as he flies to the jump zone in the form of a corona.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Haines%27%20pilot\"&gt;pilot&lt;/a&gt; takes control of the helicopter, Michael and the others then jump out. Michael parachutes onto the FIB building and cuts out of of the glass panes to let the crew to infiltrate the building. Once the crew is inside the building, Michael has to blow up the server room's door.\nMichael hacks the server terminal. The programs are on the cellphone, so Michael connects it to the machine. The player is given control of the computer. The hacker will guide the player through the process, or be clueless depending on their skill. Here are the steps:\nAfter hacking, a security team has been deployed. Michael or Franklin must shoot the team until the download completes. Press the button assigned to see a glance of the download process. During the process, the chopper is brought in, but a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0shows up and fires a rocket, destroying it and hitting a couple of floors. Next, a team with smoke bombs start attacking the crew. Use Michael's \"Bullet-time\" &lt;a href=\"Special%20Ability\"&gt;ability&lt;/a&gt; for greater precision and a perfect shot.\nOnce the download completes, Michael will take the connected cellphone back and the crew flees. Kill FIB agents along the way, as the crew escapes the FIB building. The sprinkler system reduces visibility; depending on the hacker, they will or cannot shut down the fire suppression system. A cutscene will show the wrecked helicopter as it falls to the ground. Continue fending off the agents.\nAfter going down, the player must rappel outside the building. All opposing units, both on the ground and in the air are on the scene, waiting for the crew. During the descent, the hacker will warn the player that an air unit is on sight. It is another Buzzard, which will have miniguns. Use Michael's ability to shoot the pilot's head (an RPG or minigun are other good options). Now advance and rappel again. Kill the last group of units on the ground.\u00a0\nHead over to the meeting spot to get out. The escape varies based on the driver chosen. If an experienced driver is chosen, they'll be already there in an &lt;a href=\"Ambulance%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;ambulance&lt;/a&gt;, thus fooling the cops and escape clean. But if an inexperienced driver is chosen they won't be at the pickup spot on time, forcing the crew to fend off more cops and will show up late in a &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;Burrito&lt;/a&gt; and the player will have to escape a 4 star wanted level. As Franklin, the player gets in the vehicle, and escapes the cops if any, and drives to \"Franklin's\" house in &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Hills%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Vinewood Hills&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0for a debrief. The driver will drop off the gunman and dispose of the getaway vehicle after arriving at Franklin's house.\nPost-mission.\nAfter either approach, Michael will exit the dwelling with the intent to call &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Norton\"&gt;Dave Norton&lt;/a&gt;. The total take is constant at $331,985. Of this, Lester takes his standard 12% ($39,839), while Michael uncharacteristically turns down his share. The crew is then left with their respective cut, leaving Franklin with anywhere between $150,000 - $240,000. In addition, the doors to the garment factory will be blocked off by police tape due to the fire, and the outer walls will be scorched as well.\nMaximum Revenue.\nThe Roof Entry approach is slightly more profitable because although the player has\u00a0to hire three crew members, nobody will die and they\u00a0will not incur casualty costs. Use &lt;a href=\"Rickie%20Lukens\"&gt;Rickie Lukens&lt;/a&gt; (4%) as the hacker, &lt;a href=\"Daryl%20Johns\"&gt;Daryl Johns&lt;/a&gt; (6%) as the gunman and &lt;a href=\"Taliana%20Martinez\"&gt;Taliana Martinez&lt;/a&gt; (5%) as the driver.\nAftermath.\n&lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; (Radio).\nCovert.\n\"\"Fire in the FIB building linked to data theft.\" \"Several floors of the FIB headquarters in Downtown Los Santos were gutted by a fire yesterday.

This morning the FIB is dealing with the effects of the fire, and pertinent questions about how the security system allowed such a breach. Following the incident celebrity Special Agent &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Haines\"&gt;Steve Haines&lt;/a&gt; gave a press conference vowing to bring whoever was responsible to justice.\"\"\nPost-Mission Phone Call.\nMichael: We hit the Bureau for you, Dave. I'm done.\nDave: Yes, I saw that. Meet me at the Kortz Center and I'll debrief you.\nMichael: I'm OUT, Davey. From now on, done.\nDave: I appreciate that. I'm trying my best for you, but, but you and Trevor attacking Merryweather... repeatedly... It doesn't help.\nMichael: That's Trevor's thing.\nDave: Whoever's \"thing\" it is, it's unauthorized and it's dumb - they've been sniffing around my office. We REALLY need to talk!\nMichael: Really? *sighs* Alright, alright, I'll come to the Kortz Center. Fuck!!!\nWalkthrough.\nVideo Walkthrough.\nRoof Entry.\nThe heist features multiple different soundtracks throughout gameplay:\nOnce piloting the helicopter, Burning Bar (also called No Happy Endings) by Tangerine Dream will play. The backing strings and percussive beat will play, but the soundtrack will not enter the initial melody seen during &lt;a href=\"Bury%20the%20Hatchet\"&gt;Bury the Hatchet&lt;/a&gt;. This will gradually fade out once the team land on the roof.\nOnce inside the building, Dragoner by Tangerine Dream will play. While completing the hack, only the initial background strings and quiet melody will play. Once the team are ambushed by the NOOSE operatives, the beat, bass and drums will kick in as seen during &lt;a href=\"Legal%20Trouble\"&gt;Legal Trouble&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen all the NOOSE operatives are killed, the soundtrack will seemingly morph into the next track, City by Tangerine Dream, as the team make their way down the building to the destroyed floors, fighting through security units. This will play the duration of this sequence, until the team get ready to rappel down the building.\nAfter rappelling down to the base of the building, Dragoner will once again play, kicking straight into the main beat as Franklin and Michael make their way to the getaway vehicle.\nOnly one soundtrack plays throughout the entire mission; Diamond Diary Fake by Tangerine Dream. This, for the majority of the mission, remains with low intensity and the beat only kicks in towards the escape sequence of the mission."}

The heist's story focuses on the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; being contacted by the &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Madrazo\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;crime boss&lt;/a&gt; they worked with before, in order to steal &lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Files\"&gt;problematic documents&lt;/a&gt; being held by a prominent &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Strickler\"&gt;drug lord&lt;/a&gt; from their &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico\"&gt;island&lt;/a&gt; stronghold in the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20Sea\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt;. The heist focuses on players scoping out the island for points of interest, entry points both to the island and the victim's &lt;a href=\"El%20Rubio%27s%20Compound\"&gt;compound&lt;/a&gt;, and any additional lucrative targets for them to steal.\nUnlike other &lt;a href=\"Heists%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;heist missions&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;GTA Online&lt;/a&gt;\", The Cayo Perico Heist allows players to approach the heist either in the planned method or doing it differently than intended, as well as handling the mission on their own although securing less of a payout, or working with others, requiring co-ordination between all players, but providing a greater payday for all involved.\nDescription.\nThe Cayo Perico Heist focuses on players conducting a major heist against &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Strickler\"&gt;Juan Strickler&lt;/a&gt;, a notorious drug lord known to many as El Rubio, who maintains an &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico\"&gt;island compound&lt;/a&gt; in the Caribbean which houses a collection of valuables, is home to a major part of his drug operations, and maintains tight security measures and heavily armed guards, including gunboats, an attack helicopter, and surface-to-air missile turrets. The focus of the heist is to secure a major target being held in a vault beneath Strickler's secure compound and escape with it, using any methods to reach the island and breach into the vault. This includes going in aggressive, using stealth to neutralize hostiles, or conducting subterfuge by using disguises to get around guards. In addition to this, players can also steal additional valuables from secure storage sites, which increase the overall payout of the heist. \nThe heist may only be initiated when a player is operating as a &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;CEO or VIP Organization&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Club&lt;/a&gt;, with the first time playthrough focused on the protagonist conducting the heist to secure documents for &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Madrazo\"&gt;Miguel Madrazo&lt;/a&gt;, the son of &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin Madrazo&lt;/a&gt;, being held by Strickler. The initial job focuses on the players meeting Miguel at the newly opened nightclub, &lt;a href=\"The%20Music%20Locker\"&gt;The Music Locker&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player is directed to purchase a &lt;a href=\"Kosatka\"&gt;Kosatka&lt;/a&gt; submarine from &lt;a href=\"Warstock%20Cache%20%26amp%3B%20Carry\"&gt;Warstock Cache &amp; Carry&lt;/a&gt; as a base of operation for the heist, with the intial setup cost and fencing fees covered for the first time, and making use of a beach party organized by Strickler to go undercover to plan the heist. After the first playthrough, the player must pay an upfront fee of $100,000 (as of 27/09/2023) when initiating another playthrough of the heist, but will focus on stealing valuables being held by Strickler in his vault, using a drug smuggling plane to return to scope out the island. \nThe heist is divided between three separate strands of missions: Intel, which focuses on scoping out points of interests, the primary target, and any potential secondary loot targets; Prep, which focuses on acquiring the needed equipment to pull off the heist (following on from the idea used in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Heist\"&gt;Doomsday Heist&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20Heist\"&gt;Diamond Casino Heist&lt;/a&gt;; and the Finale, which focuses on conducting the heist in any arrangement the player decides upon, regardless of how they chose the heist to proceed as upon the planning screen. The Cayo Perico Heist can be completed solo by players, not only in scoping and prep work, but the finale of the heist itself; however, the payout for doing it solo is reduced as a result, as certain secondary targets are held behind locked doors within the compound that require another player to open, limiting access to valuable goods such as gold and paintings unless the heist is played with other players.\nIntel.\nThe Gather Intel mission is a freemode mission that begins the Cayo Perico Heist, and focuses on scoping out the island for heist by locating a key target, several optional loot items, and important points of interest. To do so, players must visit the island undercover - their first playthrough sees them acting as the tour manager for a prominent DJ who is set to provide music for a beach party, while subsequent playthroughs see players visit the island while disguised as one of its regular drug smugglers.\nThe mission may be completed entirely solo, and during Invite Only, Friend, and Solo sessions. The mission allows for full exploration of most of the island, though prohibiting players from conducting outright conflict, instead using stealth to avoid detection by guards and security cameras while seeking out important intel and any potential opportunities for the heist. Like the Diamond Casino Heist, the mission is repeatable after the initial run, allowing players to return and scope out any additional points of interest or targets that they missed.\nPreparations.\nPrep missions are freemode missions that may be completed at any time through the Kosatka's planning screen. These tasks consist of acquiring and preparing equipment necessary for the heist, such as approach vehicles, weapons, and tools. Optional prep missions provide players with the opportunity to sabotage the guards before the heist and make the heist significantly easier, though these may only be done once. Players also have the option to steal the equipment from rival Organizations and Motorcycle Clubs, should they be performing a prep mission.\nPrep missions may be completed entirely solo. They may also be completed in Invite Only sessions, Friend sessions, and Solo sessions. No prep missions require taking multiple vehicles or items, eliminating the need to backtrack when playing solo.\nLike the Diamond Casino Heist, support crew is available, but instead of taking a cut, they simply require an upfront payment to be used during the heist itself. Instead of supports such as gunmen or hackers, the support crew available in the Cayo Perico Heist provides assistance such as snipers, airstrikes, or reconnaissance drones. Certain supports can only be executed if certain conditions are met, such as disabling air defenses or infiltrating using a specific vehicle.\nThe Cayo Perico Heist.\nUnlike previous heists, players are free to complete the Cayo Perico Heist however they please, with de facto \"Aggressive\", \"Big Con\", and \"Silent and Sneaky\" options available to players during the heist. Prep missions may also affect the approach and events of the heist.\nThe host can make different choices to change the approach vehicles, the entrance and escape points, and the time of day. Unlike previous heists, most of the choices are not locked in and players are free to take any approaches they like on the go, such as choosing a different infiltration or exit point than what's selected."}
{"id": "272591", "revid": "2163805", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=272591", "title": "The Cayo Perico Heist/Finale", "text": "The Cayo Perico Heist finale is a heist mission featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of update. It is the final mission of &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist\"&gt;The Cayo Perico Heist&lt;/a&gt; strand.\nDescription.\nThe mission focuses on players visiting &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico\"&gt;Cayo Perico&lt;/a&gt; after completing all mandatory preparation missions that unlocks the finale, in order to steal their primary target from within &lt;a href=\"El%20Rubio%27s%20Compound\"&gt;El Rubio's Compound&lt;/a&gt;. Although the plan for the heist must be designated when beginning it, only the approach method and weapon loadout are locked in. Once the players arrive on the island they have freedom to tackle the heist in a variety of manners, similar to the Aggressive, Stealth, or Big Con approaches of &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20Heist\"&gt;The Diamond Casino Heist&lt;/a&gt;. Once the mission begins, the protagonist's main objectives are to enter the compound, reach the basement beneath the office, steal the primary target, escape the compound, and then escape from the island.\nWhen players initiate the heist, they can choose to complete the mission solo, or be joined by up to three other players - the latter option increases the maximum potential payout when seeking out secondary targets. All equipment found during the mission will be marked on the players maps, and any undiscovered items can still be found, allowing every member of the crew to pick up an individual item if required. Players can also secure additional items in the compound that provide access to new opportunities or some of the secondary targets available in the mission. Once the primary target is found, players will face increased difficulty in securing additional loot items, as they will face additional guards and will be sought out by Strickler manning the minigun in his &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie%20MOD.0\"&gt;Valkyrie MOD.0&lt;/a&gt; upon leaving the compound, until the crew makes for their opted escape route. \n&lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Wheel\"&gt;Weapon Wheel&lt;/a&gt; access is limited to the chosen loadout, with the additional heavy weapon Supply Drop adding to it. While undiscovered, killed guards may drop ammunition and snacks, but their weapons will not be able to be looted. If the alarm is raised and the guards are using their weapons, their weapons can be looted and will be added to the player's weapon wheel for selection. Up to three additional weapons can also be collected within the compound.\nThe final payout of the heist is determined by the Primary Target (which increases by 10% on Hard Mode), but on the value of the secondary targets that the crew secured. Secondary loot is dropped if players are shot by guards or have to respawn after being killed (with the exception of the safe cash), and the primary target will be dropped if the player carrying it is killed.\nFinale Screen.\nPlayers access the heist from the planning screen in the &lt;a href=\"Kosatka\"&gt;Kosatka&lt;/a&gt;. The finale is available once the mandatory &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist/Preparations\"&gt;preparations&lt;/a&gt; are completed, but players can opt to continue performing optional set-ups or another before initiating the finale.\nOn the finale screen, the player is required to make selections on the following:\nApproach Vehicle.\nLists all vehicles they have secured during the preparation missions, provided they meet the requirements.\nInfiltration Point.\nWhich point of entry to the island, may be restricted depending on which approach vehicle was selected, some can be over-ridden once on approach.\nCompound Entry Point.\nAvailable entry points at the start - can be changed on the fly when additional equipment is collected on the island.\nEscape Point.\nAvailable exit points - can be changed on the fly during the heist.\nTime of Day.\nSets the time of day.\nWeapon Loadout.\nThe weapon loadout is pre-selected based on what preparation option was picked, but the player is now given the option to purchase suppressors for $5,000.\nHire Support Crew.\nSupport crew provides additional assistance to players during the heist. These can only be chosen for the heist when the player completes all the mandatory prep missions to activate the Finale, and require an upfront fee be paid for their services; some also require the player owns certain businesses before they can be used (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Hangars\"&gt;Hangars&lt;/a&gt; for Airstrikes, &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs\"&gt;Nightclubs&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Terrorbyte\"&gt;Terrorbyte&lt;/a&gt; for Recon Drones). All but the Weapon Stash are available for use on the island via the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt;, but require the player to first disable the island's air defenses for them to be available. The Weapon Stash is only available if the player chooses the Velum approach vehicle, and will have already completed their job when the player lands.\nAssign Crew Cuts.\nIf there is more than one player in the heist, the leader must assign a specific cut to each participant (set to 15%, the minimum cut).\nContinue.\nOnce the setup is complete, and all other players have marked themselves as ready, indicating acceptance of their cut, the leader can start the heist, at which point the mission begins.\nMission Walkthrough.\nIsland Infiltration and Compound Entry.\nOnce the heist begins, the crew approaches &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico\"&gt;Cayo Perico&lt;/a&gt; via the vehicle chosen by the leader. Infiltration points can be limited based on the approach vehicle selected.\nOnce on the island, their first objective is to reach the &lt;a href=\"El%20Rubio%27s%20Compound\"&gt;compound&lt;/a&gt; and gain entry, though they are free to explore the island for any Secondary Targets, secure any additional equipment, and perform some sabotage tasks.\nEntering the compound must be done via one of six entry points; how many are available to the players depends on what equipment they have collected up to this point. How the entry point is used dictates the de-facto style of approach the crew can use to complete the rest of the mission:\nPrimary Target.\nOnce inside the compound, players next objective is to gain access to the basement vault, reaching one of two entrances from their chosen entry point: Strickler's office; or an underground tunnel accessed by two separate locked gates. During this time, the crew can acquire two keycards, which are needed to enter the storage areas that hold the more valuable secondary targets, as well as a set of keys, which unlock the underground gates as well as two shortcut gates between the Main Gate courtyard and the mansion tower providing additional paths. Regardless of which entrance into the vault the crew go for, both require the player to hack a fingerprint scanner - one member must correctly reconstruct fingerprints within a time-limit or be forced to start over again; the others must protect this member during that time. If accessing via the elevator from the office, three (four in Hard Mode) prints must be matched, while accessing through the underground gates requires a single print match (two in Hard Mode) at the additional scanner found there.\nUpon entering the basement, the crew must get through a locked gate before they can reach the primary target, at which point, one member must tackle the task of acquiring the item, depending on its location, while the others protect them from the guards (if alerted):\nRegardless of whether their loot bag is full of secondary targets or not, any crew member can carry the Primary Target, but will drop it if they are killed by the guards, forcing them or another crew member to retrieve it, otherwise they cannot complete the mission.\nSecondary Targets.\nAlthough the crew is free to go after every optional loot item that was located during the mission, each member can only carry a limited amount in their loot bag; even if they go after one category, they can only secure a set amount before the bag is full and will not accept additional loot. Thus the total amount of all located secondary targets is unachievable by a crew of four players, forcing members to decide on which targets to acquire during the heist. However, the difficulty level of the mission does not impact the value of each category of secondary targets.\nIf a player conducts the Finale mission solo, they are restricted to stealing secondary targets from lock-ups around the island - cash and drugs. Most require the player to destroy the gate to these with , explosives, or by shooting its lock with a gun, which will alert nearby guards (particularly if guns are not equipped with suppressors). The lock-ups can be opened silently by using a pair of bolt cutters or the . However, two of the lock-ups have steel shutters which require two players to deal with them: one to keep the door open with a nearby lever, and the other to enter and collect the targets inside. All secondary targets within the compound are behind a dual keycard access door, requiring two players to have a keycard: one will be dropped by a guard, and the other will be on Strickler's desk in the office. To open the doors, players must simultaneously enter their keycard. These sites will hold gold, paintings, or additional stacks of cash. A solo run does have the opportunity for players to steal one or two paintings, provided the paintings spawn in the office; otherwise, they are limited to looting the lock-ups around the island.\nWhile players can determine how much they take from any stack of cash, drugs and gold, paintings can only be taken when fully removed from their frame.\nAlthough not marked on the map, nor considered a secondary target, a random amount of cash is available in the hidden safe in the office; like the primary target, this does not take up room in the loot bag. This bonus is available to both solo and team players.\nEscape.\nOnce the primary target is acquired, the crew's next objective is to escape from the compound, though they can freely track down any secondary targets they missed during this time. However, upon leaving the basement, a new shift of guards will spawn around the compound and the island. The crew will only be able to leave the compound via five routes: \nThe crew must use one of these routes, as they cannot use the Drainage Tunnel or the Supply Truck if these were used to enter the compound. Attempting to jump off the compound balcony to swim away will result in instant death.\nAfter leaving the compound, the crew's final objective is to leave Cayo Perico via one of the available escape routes they can use, though they have time to seek out any secondary targets they missed. However, the latter decision is made tougher when they are a certain distance from the compound, as all the island's guards will be assisted by Strickler, who will begin seeking out the crew with a &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie%20MOD.0\"&gt;Valkyrie MOD.0&lt;/a&gt; attack helicopter, while the dock entry points will be patrolled by &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Dinghy\"&gt;Weaponized Dinghies&lt;/a&gt; (albeit no gunners present). If the crew were detected by the guards by this point, the Valkyrie will pursue and attack them, leaving members to either evade or attempt to disable the helicopter. Strickler is invincible and his helicopter cannot be destroyed either; after enough damage he will simply fly away. If the crew has remained undetected, the Valkyrie will search across the island for them, and only attack if it or the guards detect them. In addition, crew members will not be able to avoid detection with guard uniforms, as these become useless at this point.\nAlthough the crew may use the escape route chosen by the leader, they can change this if required. Each route will require the player to do the following: \nGuard Behavior.\nGuards and their cones of vision will be shown on the players map/radar in Normal Mode but in Hard Mode they will only appear at close distances. The Recon Drone is required to show guards further away. During the mission, the guards will initially be unaware of the crew's presence, but will detect them if they should enter their line of sight or make noise near them. If a player gets detected by a guard and is not taken care of quickly, the guard will shoot at the player, often alerting other guards. When this happens, an alarm is given, and the crew is forced to conduct an Aggressive approach for the heist, as guards will continuously pursue crew members throughout the mission, with new ones spawning to replace those evaded or killed. Some guards will not detect the crew at all, depending on how they approach the heist: if they use the &lt;a href=\"Longfin\"&gt;Longfin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Velum%205-Seater\"&gt;Velum 5-Seater&lt;/a&gt;, certain guards at each vehicle's respective entry point will not raise the alarm; if the crew finds Guard Uniforms, they will not be detected by cameras, and have limited protection from detection by guards across the island, while those in the courtyard of the compound will not raise the alarm. Being spotted by the Personal Bodyguards or Heavy Gunner inside the compound (marked with red cones of vision) will render the disguise ineffective. However, using disguises will only work if the crew avoids acting aggressive to the guards, while they cannot remain disguised inside the compound upon going beyond the courtyard.\nAs an added difficulty, guards will also detect dead bodies and raise the alarm should they see one. This will occur even if the body itself has physically despawned; the game registers the location where the victim has been killed and alert the guards upon seeing it. The alert may also be raised upon the guard shift change after taking the primary loot should one of the newly-arrived guards see a body killed previously. This difficulty may force players to completely change tactics, closely observe guard patrols and plan out their route/kills accordingly as leaving a trail of dead guards behind runs the very high risk of raising the alarm prematurely. \nThe players can encounter a Heavy Gunner within the compound who will be wearing heavy armor and wielding a &lt;a href=\"minigun\"&gt;minigun&lt;/a&gt;, marked by a red skull on the minimap. This guard is one of El Rubio's personal bodyguards and always has an extended narrow cone of vision. He takes little damage to the body and requires multiple shots to the head to be killed, and he cannot be killed by a melee attack.\nThe time of day that the crew leader chooses for the mission impacts the vision range of guards: during the day, their line of sight is extended; while at night, it is reduced. If the crew chooses to disable the power station, all cameras on the island will deactivate until the players enter the compound, and guards will have their vision range reduced further if this is done during a night-time playthrough of the mission.\nGuards are further impacted in how they deal with the crew, depending on which Disruption missions that were completed successfully by the crew during the &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist/Preparations\"&gt;Preparations&lt;/a&gt; missions: disrupting supplies of weapons restricts guards from using higher powered weapons; disrupting armor prevents guards from having any &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;Body Armor&lt;/a&gt;, although the Heavy Gunner is not impacted; and disrupting air support prevents the guards using &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Choppers&lt;/a&gt; when the crew is detected. In addition, if players managed to find and use cutting powder during the Gather Intel mission, guards will have reduced firing accuracy during the Finale mission.\nCollectible Weapons.\nDuring the mission, it is possible for players to acquire three weapons from within the compound:\nAftermath.\nUpon escaping the island, a cutscene will play.\nMadrazo Files.\nThe player will arrive at &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Madrazo%27s%20Mansion\"&gt;Miguel Madrazo's Mansion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Hills\"&gt;Vinewood Hills&lt;/a&gt; where they will be met at the gate by a &lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Cartel\"&gt;guard&lt;/a&gt;. He will let them in and &lt;a href=\"Jorge%20%28GTA%20Online%29\"&gt;Jorge&lt;/a&gt; will lead them through to a party where &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20Madrazo\"&gt;Miguel Madrazo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Patricia%20Madrazo\"&gt;Patricia Madrazo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kaylee\"&gt;Kaylee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Evan\"&gt;Evan&lt;/a&gt; will be seen, along with other party guests. The player will give Miguel the document canister. Jorge then pays the player. Miguel calls &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin Madrazo&lt;/a&gt; to announce the success, only for his father to hang up on him when he suggests this success should allow him to re-open discussions on a crypto deal or a condo project. Miguel suggests the player continue to rob Strickler repeatedly and that Jorge will act as a fence for any future heists.\nMiguel then opens the document canister and expresses disgust at the content, throwing them onto the fire pit. The player can see a &lt;a href=\"Union%20Depository\"&gt;Union Depository&lt;/a&gt; memo and a salacious photo of Patricia and &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe heist will then be complete and a short cutscene of the player and Miguel doing a tequila shot on the courtyard balcony, the latter throwing away his lime. If there were multiple players taking part in the heist, Miguel will not be present for the tequila scene. The player(s) will spawn back into free mode at the gate of Miguel's mansion with the payment in their cash ready to be banked.\nRepeat Heists.\nThe player will hand over the loot bag to Jorge and be handed an envelope in payment. The tequila shot cutscene is then replayed and the player will spawn back into free mode outside the mansion gate.\nReplay Heists.\nOnce the player spawns back into free mode, Pavel will send a text explaining that he will message the player when it is safe to try the heist again. Heist owner will have to wait 3 game days (144 real minutes) if playing solo or 1 game day (48 real minutes) if playing as a group after completion of the previous heist to trigger a new heist to replay. Note that exiting the game does not freeze the timer. \nAfter the cooldown, Pavel will send another text stating that the player can start another heist, after which they have a 48-minute time window to reach the sub and pay the $100,000 set-up fee to trigger Hard Mode. After 48 minutes, the player can only play the Heist in Normal Mode. \nRewards.\nAfter the mission is completed, the final payout is calculated based on the value of the primary target, the total amount of secondary targets each participating crew member brought back - gradually reduced if the member takes damage during the mission, or greatly reduced if they are forced to respawn with a team life. A bonus is added to the total, if the mission's Elite Challenges are successfully completed, which is modified by the difficulty the mission was conducted under. After the first playthrough, the payout is further reduced by costs - Pavel's 2% cut, and the Madrazo Cartel's 10% fee for fencing the loot.\nPrimary Target.\nThe difficulty of the heist impacts only the value of the primary target. With the exception of the first playthrough, each target in subsequent runs has a set value for completing the heist on normal difficulty, but an increased value if the player undertakes the heist on hard difficulty.\n\"*\" denotes the target for the first playthrough, cannot be encountered on subsequent playthroughs.&lt;br&gt;\n denotes the target is only available during certain &lt;a href=\"Events%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Events&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;\n denotes the target will be locked in the safe.&lt;br&gt;\n denotes the target will be inside the glass case.&lt;br&gt;\nSecondary Targets.\nThe following table denotes the total value of each secondary target (most per stack), and the amount that each player can carry of each in their loot bag:\n\"\"\nTotal loot.\nThe theoretical maximum loot on the island would total over $7,119,000, however the 4-player carry limit means the maximum payout would be significantly less:\nAwards.\nIn addition to the loot payout, several awards grant additional monetary rewards the first time they are achieved.\nChanges.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nPatch 1.63=\nWith the update, several changes were made to the Cayo Perico Heist finale:\nPatch 1.62=\nWith the update, several changes were made to the Cayo Perico Heist finale:\nPatch 1.61=\nWith update, several changes were made to the Cayo Perico Heist finale:\nPatch 1.57=\nWith the release of the update, several fixes were made to the Cayo Perico Heist finale:\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

All of these missions can be viewed and started from the prep screen on the bridge of the &lt;a href=\"Kosatka\"&gt;Kosatka&lt;/a&gt;, and become available after the player has completed the minimum requirements for scoping out the heist during the . Missions must be initiated as a CEO or MC Club President, but are available in any lobby type (i.e. they are not restricted to public free roam sessions).\nAlthough the player must complete a set of mandatory missions in order to activate the Finale setup screen, some are optional but can provide additional options for the player to have available when finalizing the setup for the heist, some of which are one-offs for each playthrough but confer advantages during the heist itself. An additional amount of prepwork becomes available when the Finale is active, which determines if the player will have a support crew on standby to assist during the heist.\nAll the missions can be completed in an invite-only session. When a prep mission is done in a public lobby and the player(s) has secured the main objective, once the global signal ends, other players will receive a text alert from 'their' Pavel.\nPrep Screen.\nThe prep screen contains several preparation missions that can be conducted. Each falls into one of four categories: Approach Vehicle; Equipment; Weapon Loadout; and Disruption. All are mandatory for activating the Heist Finale, except for the Disruption missions which are optional.\nPreparations must be repeated every time the heist is run.

However, opting for other approaches will require them to be done nonetheless:\nEquipment.\nThree of the equipment missions in this category are mandatory for activating the Finale. While both the Primary Target equipment and Basement entry equipment have to be completed, only one of the Compound Entry equipment missions needs to be completed; the other becomes optional.\nWeapon Loadout.\nAlthough five setups are available for the player to chose from for the finale, all follow the same prep mission structure:\nSuppressors do not have a prep mission, but are optional addition for the heist nonetheless. The player can opt to use these in the Finale, but must purchase them first for an upfront cost of $5,000.\nDisruption.\nThese missions are entirely optional, but serve to make the heist easier to complete by decreasing the effectiveness of the guards on the island. However, players have less than 10 minutes to complete each mission's objectives, and can only conduct the mission on each playthrough of the heist strand:\nFinale Screen.\nThe finale screen becomes accessible when the minimum mandatory prep missions have been completed, and provides a list of the approach vehicles, infiltration points, compound entry points, escape points, time of day, and weapon loadout available to the player. In addition, it provides tips on how the time of day will affect the heist, and provides access to hiring Support Crew members."}

This prompts him to write a new review apologising to Tony and praising Maisonette 9 as \"the hottest club in the city\", followed by a negative review of the Statue of Happiness, describing it as a \"cold slab of stone\".\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nHe is mentioned by &lt;a href=\"Danny%20Brown\"&gt;Danny Brown&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"IFruit%20Radio\"&gt;IFruit Radio&lt;/a&gt;, saying that the Celebinator has spoken about the embarrassing photos of &lt;a href=\"Yung%20Ancestor\"&gt;Yung Ancestor&lt;/a&gt; that had been leaked.

It is also the final assassination mission in the game.\nDescription.\nThe mission is received by telephone like the previous Lester missions. The target now is a corrupt businessman called &lt;a href=\"Enzo%20Bonelli\"&gt;Enzo Bonelli&lt;/a&gt;; he is running a &lt;a href=\"Mile%20High%20Club\"&gt;construction site&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Downtown Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. Bonelli has been involved in extortion, murder and labor racketeering and is rumored to retain some connections with the mafia. Lester wants him eliminated so that his own stock in a separate construction company, &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20Development\"&gt;Gold Coast Development&lt;/a&gt;, will increase do to the increase in work. However, Lester mentions that the informant who tipped him off to Bonelli's location squealed, meaning Franklin will need to get some extra firepower to deal with the increased protection. Franklin needs to kill all the bodyguards who are protecting Bonelli in the unfinished building's lower floors. As soon as all they are dead, Franklin enters a construction elevator which takes him to the roof. More guards are protecting Bonelli. He tries to escape in a &lt;a href=\"Maverick\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt;, but Franklin has to quickly take the helicopter down. A &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;Rocket Launcher&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best choices, but if the player acts quickly enough, he can dispatch the helicopter's pilot, resulting in the helicopter losing control and crashing. Franklin then has to leave the area. Franklin will use either the elevator or a &lt;a href=\"parachute\"&gt;parachute&lt;/a&gt; provided nearby. When Franklin is far enough away, Lester will call him to congratulate him for doing a good job but states that any future hits are off the board until the heat from Bonelli's death has died down.\nAftermath.\n&lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; (Radio).\n\"A shootout at a construction site claims the life of rumored mafia boss Enzo Bonelli.\" \"The murder of real estate developer Enzo Bonelli in a shootout at a construction site in the Pillbox Hill area of Los Santos is being investigated by police.

It remains unclear whether there was a motive behind the killings, or whether this was just more mindless violence for the sake of it.

It is the Heist Finale of the Act I of &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Heist\"&gt;The Doomsday Heist&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nIntroduction.\nThe crew reunites with &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Avon%20Hertz\"&gt;Avon&lt;/a&gt;, where the latter states that &lt;a href=\"Cliffford\"&gt;Cliffford&lt;/a&gt; has analyzed the data. Avon then calls &lt;a href=\"Agent%2014\"&gt;Agent 14&lt;/a&gt;, where he complains that Avon should have returned to the civilian life, which Avon replies it was \"a setup\". Even though Avon is convinced of his conspiracy of an imminent war, Agent 14 is not interested in hearing his story and that he is late for a departmental potluck, leaving the call.\nAvon later suspects the potluck and that the data clearly states it is happening right now. He states that \"the department is out sharing meat loaf and potato salad, so their base can be permanently shut down\", to which Lester responds that given the circumstances, nobody is going to believe it, so they have to do something. Everyone leaves the planning room and the crew is ready to start the heist finale.\nMission.\nThe crew are instructed to go to the &lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;IAA&lt;/a&gt; base on the &lt;a href=\"Satellite%20Relay%20Station\"&gt;Satellite Relay Station&lt;/a&gt; to stop whatever is attacking the facility. Once the team is there, several &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt; agents, along with &lt;a href=\"Mesa%20Grande\"&gt;Mesa&lt;/a&gt; SUVs and &lt;a href=\"Brickade\"&gt;Brickade&lt;/a&gt; trucks, are seen around the entrance, which the crew have to take out to get into the base.\nOnce down there, the crew have to move all the way through the IAA base while taking out more enemies, spotted on multiple places. The crew have to reach to the lowest level of the base where the enemies are attempting to hack the servers. Once the crew have cleared out the area, they must return to the war room, eliminate the enemies and take control of the base turrets.\nEnemies may arrive to the base from multiple directions, in more Mesa SUVs and &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;s. The crew can use the machine gun and the fast-firing cannon from the turret to eliminate them. With enough defense, the threat level is decreased and enemies will try to flee from the area, which the crew can optionally kill. With the enemies taken out, the crew leaves the gun turrets and the mission ends.\nEnding.\nFrom the same entrance to the War Room, &lt;a href=\"Agent%2014\"&gt;Agent 14&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Phoenicia%20Rackman\"&gt;Phoenicia Rackman&lt;/a&gt; show up with a &lt;a href=\"Carbine%20Rifle%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Carbine Rifle Mk II&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. However, Agent 14 says he knows the group and everything is fine, while Phoenicia calls on the phone to an unknown employee to lock down the facility, asking where \"that buffoon\" was, \"the one who caused the assault by the museum,\" presumably referring to &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper%20contact\"&gt;Agent ULP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Wrap%20Up\"&gt;The Wrap Up&lt;/a&gt;. Suddenly, Avon shows up and tells everyone they should have listened to him. He later logs onto Cliffford to get information about who is responsible for the attacks, which Rackman suspects of the &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;ns. Avon states that it is \"some Russians\" and that the information leads to a Russian agitator, hitman and war mongerer identified as &lt;a href=\"Bogdan\"&gt;Bogdan&lt;/a&gt;. Agent 14 does not believe that, but Avon specifies that the data foot print tracks back to him.\nWith the meeting finished, Avon says he will be in touch to the crew and gets in his blue &lt;a href=\"Cyclone\"&gt;Cyclone&lt;/a&gt;, ending the cutscene and the act is completed."}

It is situated on the site of the original &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Casino\"&gt;Vinewood Casino&lt;/a&gt; (also known as Be Lucky: Los Santos). It is comprised of the casino, the &lt;a href=\"Master%20Penthouse\"&gt;Master Penthouse&lt;/a&gt;, a hotel, a penthouse garage, and a parking garage.\nAs part of the update, players receive an email ad when logging into a session.\nAs part of update and the addition of The Music Locker, the email was updated.\nInterior.\nThe interior of the casino includes the main lobby, the &lt;a href=\"Inside%20Track\"&gt;Inside Track&lt;/a&gt; betting area, two small VIP-only lounge areas, a gambling area, two bathrooms, and Agatha's office. The main lobby is located at the entrance of the casino and includes the reception area, vehicle podium, the &lt;a href=\"Lucky%20Wheel\"&gt;Lucky Wheel&lt;/a&gt;, cashier booth, bar, the &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Store\"&gt;Casino Store&lt;/a&gt;, and many slot machines. Visitors with a standard membership can play roulette, blackjack, and Three Card Poker in the &lt;a href=\"Gambling\"&gt;gambling&lt;/a&gt; area at the back of the casino.\nMain Lobby.\nThe reception is a small area to the left of the entrance. Here, &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Connors\"&gt;Tom Connors&lt;/a&gt; can offer various services to the player. A standard membership can be purchased for &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;500, which will allow the player to use slot machines, spin the Lucky Wheel, play table games, and bet on horses at the Inside Track betting area, as well as give access to valet services. If the player owns the Master Penthouse, they are upgraded to VIP membership and get access to three more options: Cleaning Service (sends a maid to clean the penthouse after a party), &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Limousine%20Service\"&gt;Limousine Services&lt;/a&gt; (basically a fast travel taxi), and Aircraft Concierge (the player can request a helicopter). An elevator is also located here, which can take players to their penthouse, the penthouse garage, parking garage, roof terrace, rooftop, or The Music Locker.\nThe Lucky Wheel is positioned near the center of the main lobby; the player can spin it once per 24 real-life hours to have a chance at winning various amounts of money, &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;RP&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Chips\"&gt;Chips&lt;/a&gt;; any clothing item from the Casino Store, a 10% vehicle discount from a random vehicle website, the current podium vehicle, or a mystery prize. The prize vehicle is showcased on a slowly rotating platform to the left of the wheel, sometimes already having a livery applied.\nOn the right side of the lobby, there are the cashier booth, bar, and Casino Store. The player can trade money for chips and vice versa \u2013 up to a maximum of $50,000 for VIP members - each in-game day. Every 24 real-life hours, members can also claim a visitor bonus of 1,000 chips. At the bar, named The Solitaire, players can order drinks; the same selection is available as in the Master Penthouse and &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs\"&gt;Nightclubs&lt;/a&gt;. Also similarly to nightclubs, penthouse owners can order the first five drink types for free. In the Casino Store, players can browse through and purchase a large selection of clothing items; penthouse owners also have the option of purchasing &lt;a href=\"Master%20Penthouse/Decorations\"&gt;Penthouse Decorations&lt;/a&gt;. Some items are only available during select weeks, as they rotate after every &lt;a href=\"Events\"&gt;event week&lt;/a&gt;, requiring four weeks to rotate through the entire selection.\nAt the back of the main lobby, near the hallways to the other areas, are many slot machines of different themes. The type of machine dictates the possible betting amount and the payout for different matching items; the available machine themes are: \"&lt;a href=\"Fame%20or%20Shame\"&gt;Fame or Shame&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Evacuator\"&gt;Evacuator&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Diamond Miner\", \"&lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Knife\"&gt;Twilight Knife&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Deity of the Sun\", \"&lt;a href=\"Republican%20Space%20Rangers\"&gt;Republican Space Rangers&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Angel%20and%20the%20Knight\"&gt;Angel and the Knight&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Impotent%20Rage\"&gt;Impotent Rage&lt;/a&gt;\". The \"Fame or Shame\" and \"Evacuator\" slot machines have the lowest betting amount and payouts, while the \"Deity of the Sun\" and \"Diamond Miner\" slot machines have the highest.\nWhen entering the casino floor for the first time in a new week, there will be a PA reminder that there is a new podium vehicle prize.\nIf a player wins a significant prize from the Lucky Wheel, such as the podium vehicle, gets a slot machine jackpot, or wins with a straight flush at Three Card Poker, congratulations are announced over the casino floor's PA system. An announcement will also be made when a player purchases a bottle of &lt;a href=\"Bl%C3%AAuter%27d\"&gt;Bl\u00eauter'd&lt;/a&gt; Champagne Diamond at The Solitaire.\nCasino Limousine Service.\nWith the acquisition of the Casino Penthouse comes access to the &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Limousine%20Service\"&gt;Casino Limousine Service.&lt;/a&gt; The casino owns two &lt;a href=\"Albany\"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stretch\"&gt;Stretch&lt;/a&gt; limos, the white \"DIAMOND1\" and the black \"DIAMOND2\". This free service takes you to multiple locations on a map similar to a taxi, but with the added benefit of fast travel. Speak to &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Connors\"&gt;Tom Connors&lt;/a&gt; in the lobby to choose a teleport location from the menu.\nTeleport locations are LSIA, Terminal, Legion Square, Chumash, Paleto Bay, Grapeseed, Sandy Shores, Del Perro Pier, Tongva Hills, and Observatory.\nInside Track Betting.\nDown the left hallway leading from the main lobby, there is the Inside Track betting area, which includes a large LCD screen displaying the horse races. Numerous IBT machines can be seen, enough for at least 16 participants (though NPCs may be seen participating in the game).\nPlayers can choose to participate in either the single event, where the player can bet on their own, and the races last for around 30 seconds; or the main event, where the player can bet against other players, and the races last longer, for a minute. This type of race is triggered automatically every five minutes. In both event types, the player can bet on any of six horses, each with a different winning probability, with a minimum of $100 and a maximum of $10,000.\nTable Games.\nMany roulette, blackjack, and Three Card Poker tables can be found here, as well as two separate \"high limit\" areas available only to penthouse owners, where they can bet up to $50,000.\nVIP Lounge.\nThere are two circular VIP-only lounge areas located towards the back of the casino. Here, players can sit and smoke cigarettes, and drink either vodka or beer. Players with no membership or only the standard one cannot enter this area and will be turned around if they try doing so.\nAgatha's Office.\nAt the back, to the left of the Table Games area, is the \"management\" area; only penthouse owners can pass through the door. There are stairs leading up to a waiting room where &lt;a href=\"Debbie\"&gt;Debbie&lt;/a&gt;, Agatha's assistant, works and if the player continues, they can visit Agatha in the General Manager's office. In this room, drinks can also be drunk and there are large sound-proof windows behind Agatha's desk, through which the player can see a large portion of the main lobby. These windows can be spotted from the lobby floor. To the right of the windows, there is a private elevator that is known to at least reach the Basement (B1).\nRoof Terrace.\nAlso called the 'Roof Deck', this area is where guests can sit and socialize, overlooking the front of the casino. On the east end is a closed bar, public washrooms, and a private stairwell for penthouse owners. There are three square, usable hot tubs running down the length of the terrace, and a usable mid-sized infinity pool makes up the west end. Some lounges along the length are available for sunbathing, but they cannot be used by players. There are stairs going down to a lower patio area with seating for larger groups, and a raised firepit. To the west is a small pathway and garden area below the infinity pool, the overflow acting as a small 'waterfall'. Behind the bar is an employee pathway to a guarded door back into the casino, on the same lower level, but there is also room to go around to the utility area around the back for the building's air conditioning units and the like. On the east side of this area is a ladder going directly to the helicopter pad on the roof.\nTaking the elevator to the terrace for the first time will always trigger the optional cutscene that is meant to introduce &lt;a href=\"Yung%20Ancestor\"&gt;Yung Ancestor&lt;/a&gt; during (along with the subsequent call from &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt;), even if the player has not purchased the Master Penthouse.\nMaster Penthouse.\nThe Diamond offers &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;the player&lt;/a&gt; a purchasable penthouse condominium that comes in several different packages, with each consecutive one granting additional rooms within the penthouse. The player may also choose to \"build their own\" penthouse, where they pay a base price of $1,500,000 and can then add rooms for an additional fee.\nA selection of decorations for the penthouse can be purchased with Chips in the Casino Store. The available items rotate each week, needing four weeks to rotate through the entire selection. Once in their penthouse, the player can use the \"Place Decorations\" option in the \"Penthouse Management\" section of the &lt;a href=\"Interaction%20Menu\"&gt;Interaction Menu&lt;/a&gt; to place them. In this menu, players can also purchase them if they haven't done so in the store.\nThere are at least four known penthouse owners: the Online Protagonist, Yung Ancestor, &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Strickler\"&gt;Juan \"El Rubio\" Strickler&lt;/a&gt;, and a recipient of a copy of &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Dre\"&gt;Dr. Dre&lt;/a&gt;'s phone.\nParking Garage.\nThe Diamond offers a valet service which allows players to store their cars in the casino's parking garage. The garage is not a permanent car housing akin to the paid garages that the player may obtain. Upon retrieving a different vehicle, the previous vehicle stored inside of the garage will return to its previous permanent storage location. Similar to the purchasable yacht being placeable in 32 different locations around the map, this garage offers 32 parking spaces; one parking space for every player in a completely filled lobby, although some spots will be taken by NPC vehicles (see &lt;a href=\"%23Guests\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;). Only personal vehicles can be entered and the valet will place the vehicle in the public garage even if the penthouse garage is owned.\nThis space may be used to safely hold vehicles whilst players visit the casino without worrying about them being damaged, and may also be used as a place to hold car meets. However, the parking garage does not allow any weaponized vehicles to be stored inside, even if said weapons are an added purchase that has not been applied to the vehicle.\nPlayers can also enter the garage directly from the south vehicular entry and they can enter the casino and return via the elevators once in the garage. The valet can be requested to retrieve the vehicle, or the player can enter the garage themselves to get it.\nMission-Only Areas.\nIn update, it is revealed that the Casino features additional areas, which are only accessed during the &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20Heist\"&gt;Casino Heist&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are two known entrance points: the staff lobby at the rear of the building and the \"high limit\" gambling area inside of it.\nMain Floor (G).\nFrom the staff door, there is a surveillance room right in front of it, guarded by metal detectors and security cameras. Inside of it, there is a switch that a player can press and hold to open a door that contains a small amount of money that has not yet been taken to the vault downstairs.\nA locker room can be seen on this level, which the crew can use to switch clothes in \"&lt;a href=\"Casino%20Heist%20-%20The%20Big%20Con\"&gt;The Big Con&lt;/a&gt;\" approach if undetected.\nLoading Bay (LL).\nAccessed in \"The Big Con\" approach through the \"Gruppe Sechs\" method, the garage door seen in the &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Racetrack\"&gt;Vinewood Racetrack&lt;/a&gt; serves as the entrance to a loading bay, where vehicles go through a security tunnel leading to a large area with six doors and the access points to the upper floors. A security checkpoint is seen on the left side of the tunnel, enclosed in a small room protected by sliding doors. This area is where the casino normally receives its deliveries of cash, chips, and supplies like alcohol. The Protagonist is once requested to deliver champagne to the underground garage, but this was likely due to the urgency with which the stock was needed.\nBasement (B1).\nThe Basement is a large area comprised of a storage area with various numbered metallic doors. Past the double doors, there is the security checkpoint where the guards are situated at the center of the room. There are two extra rooms on either side, where the left one can be used as a direct entrance in the \"&lt;a href=\"Casino%20Heist%20-%20Aggressive\"&gt;Aggressive&lt;/a&gt;\" approach through the sewer tunnel (if the prep mission is completed).\nFrom there, there is a mantrap accessed with two keycards that have to be used at the same time. This mantrap curves to the right and leads to a vault security checkpoint, where a manager takes control of the vault door with a panel on it. Said manager only appears on \"The Big Con\" approach if undetected.\nThe Vault is a circular room containing the loot required to steal. There are seven sections guarded by steel grating doors accessed with keycards (that must be hacked) and accessed through three entry points. Several safety deposit boxes can be seen there, where a player can optionally drill their locks to steal a small amount of cash. If the crew remains in the vault after the time limit is up, a nerve agent is released, emitting a green toxic cloud that will suffocate anyone if they stay for too long.\nOffices (1).\nPast the set of doors near the elevator in the main room, there is a set of stairs going to the offices, consisting of various sectioned areas with glass panes around. The brown door on the left side near the end of the room leads to the waiting room, where Debbie is normally seen. This section can be only used in \"The Big Con\" approach (choosing either the \"Bugstars\" option or the \"Yung Ancestor\" option).\nHotel Floors (2, 3, and 4).\nRegular room floors, with entrances to service rooms for staff, particularly housekeeping. In the stairwell between the offices and floor 2, and between floors 3 and 4, a fire hose rack is available for emergencies. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standpipe_%28firefighting%29\"&gt;Standpipes&lt;/a&gt; for firefighter hoses can also be seen. There is a room 237, so there are likely to be at least 37 rooms on these three floors.\nPenthouse/Hotel Floor (5).\nThe penthouse/hotel floor is accessible through the stairs or the doors on the roof terrace (if the Roof Terrace option in the &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Heist%20-%20Silent%20%26amp%3B%20Sneaky\"&gt;Silent &amp; Sneaky&lt;/a&gt; approach is chosen). This area consists of hallways with blue flooring and various neon-like lighting on the walls. There are numerous doors leading to different penthouses, which are distributed into five sections using the four poker symbols (heart, diamond, club, and spade), plus a fifth section with a money symbol ($). A waiting area with pink double-side sofas can be seen at the entrance from the elevators.\nA service room is also located between the hallways, which consists of a large storage room with piles of white clean sheets around the area, as well as a smaller section with blue boxes and used sheets and pillows, presumably sent through laundry chutes (long tubes running down through the hotel floors with hatches at each room floor to feed used sheets into) down to the laundry room.\nThe same penthouse floor can be accessed during the \"\" prep for &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist\"&gt;The Cayo Perico Heist&lt;/a&gt;, though other doors are locked during the mission (except for the service room).\nHotel Floors (6 and 7) and Service/generator room (5-8).\nA restricted service/generator area is accessed from the \"EXIT\" door on the penthouse floor and has a set of stairs going towards the upper floors.\nFloors 6 and 7 are more regular room floors, though are likely nicer/bigger than the rooms on Floors 2, 3, and 4. They most likely have staff service rooms as well, but these are not located in this restricted stairwell.\nOn the sixth floor, there is an open door leading to a small room with various electrical boxes around (though it is not clear why it's open only on this floor) while the eighth floor leads to the generators and the elevator motors, accessed through two doors (either taking a right turn or a U-turn from the stairs). The crew can choose to rappel down through elevator shaft 1 during the Silent &amp; Sneaky approach (only if the prep mission is completed).\nThe helipad access door can be found here as well, which can be used as an entrance in the Silent &amp; Sneaky approach (choosing the Helipad option), or as an exit point after robbing the vault.\nThe Music Locker.\nThe Music Locker is a nightclub introduced as part of update, located directly underneath The Diamond Casino &amp; Resort, and it is accessible to all players, however, owners of a Master Penthouse will have no entry fee, exclusive access to table service in the club's VIP section, and the only ones allowed direct entry into the club through The Diamond's elevator. \nGuests.\nSeveral unique named &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt; are present in the casino. They will re-spawn and possibly re-position every time the player enters and exits the casino, even by just taking the elevator to a different part of the casino and back again.\nVehicles.\nVarious NPC vehicles can spawn in the parking garage, including several with &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Custom%20Vehicle%20License%20Plates\"&gt;custom plates&lt;/a&gt; indicating they are owned by some of the named guests. Like the NPCs themselves, the vehicles will re-spawn every time the player enters the garage. Most of these vehicles are DLC models that do not spawn naturally in &lt;a href=\"Free%20Mode\"&gt;Free Mode&lt;/a&gt;. All vehicles are locked and cannot be stolen by the player.\nWith the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Furia\"&gt;Furia&lt;/a&gt;, all these vehicles are unmodified and using the first set of their respective traffic-default colors.\nMission Specific.\nWhen the player enters the garage to retrieve the security key card, the garage will be populated by some of the usual scripted vehicles plus several generic traffic spawns, along with an additional vehicle:\n&lt;a href=\"Nightlife%20Leak/Finale\"&gt;Nightlife Leak/Finale&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the player enters the garage on the way to the Master Penthouse there may be one or two of the normal scripted NPC cars (e.g. the &lt;a href=\"Windsor%20Drop\"&gt;Windsor Drop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pariah\"&gt;Pariah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Super%20Diamond\"&gt;Super Diamond&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Tempesta\"&gt;Tempesta&lt;/a&gt; without the USH1 plate), along with several additional vehicles with more randomized colors (i.e. not always the first traffic default) and the colors and roof configuration may change each time the player enters the garage during the mission:\nOn the way to the Master Penthouse, these vehicles are all locked and inaccessible as usual, but on return from &lt;a href=\"the%20Music%20Locker\"&gt;the Music Locker&lt;/a&gt; with the backpack, they can all be broken into and driven out of the garage, but not kept after the player returns to their &lt;a href=\"Agencies\"&gt;Agency&lt;/a&gt;."}

Each Crew Member has a minimum cut of 15% of the Heist's earnings during the Finale.\nFollowing the idea of the Doomsday Heist, Prep Jobs are featured in each approach of the Casino Heist: These are required in order to progress to the Finale. Prep Jobs are completed seamlessly in public Freemode sessions and players have the option to do the mission, steal the equipment from rival CEO/VIP Organizations and Motorcycle Clubs, or buy the equipment; however, these missions can be completed by the CEO/VIP/MC President themselves without any other member in the Organization/MC, though it is not recommended, as there could be PvP action.\nUnlike previous heists, all setup and prep missions for the heist are done in Freemode, with mandatory and optional ones that can be completed to make the heist easier. Another big change is that Prep Jobs can now be performed in Invite Only/Friend/Crew sessions, eliminating the risk of any unwanted PvP action.\nSimilar to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" heists, &lt;a href=\"Heist%20Crew%20Members%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;support crew members&lt;/a&gt; take part during the preparations; some familiar faces and other new members that can help to the crew with the approaches, with a range of equipment that affects the progression of the heist.\nPreliminary Setup.\nIn order to start the heist planning, the player has to first complete a setup mission from the Arcade property. Once this setup is done, the Arcade is operational and the player can begin the Casino Heist.\nSetup.\nThe first of the three stages of the heist is outlined on the Setup Board, where the player will be scoping out the casino and the vault.\nThe first task is scoping out the casino, where the player will need to take pictures of security features and send them to Lester. The minimum features are a security guard, door keypad, and security camera. Afterwards, the player may continue to scope out a total of 6 access points, or leave the area to quit. This mission may be replayed to scope any undiscovered features or access points in the future.\nThe second task is scoping out the vault contents. The player will need to go to the casino and hack into the security camera feed using the Sightseer app. Once the vault contents are found, the player may continue browsing the security cameras to discover up to 10 additional points of interest.\nAfter discovering the contents of the vault, the player will be able to choose one of three approaches to the heist: Silent &amp; Sneaky, The Big Con, or Aggressive.\nOn the Setup Board, the player may optionally purchase three extras to practice for the finale in the arcade. These are a casino model, door security, and vault door. The vault door is only available if the player discovered the vault blueprints on &lt;a href=\"Agatha%20Baker\"&gt;Ms. Baker's&lt;/a&gt; desk when scoping the casino.\nPreparations.\nPreparations are Freemode jobs that can be completed at any time. These tasks contribute to preparing the equipment for the specific approach, ranging from standard equipments to getaway vehicles.\nSupport crew members have different choices and percentage cuts they receive at the end of the heist, so players have to select what suits better. Higher cuts usually means better effectiveness.\nCasino Heist.\nThe Casino Heist can be completed in three different approaches, all with different equipments and methods. The host can make different choices to change the outcome of the approach and the getaway, as well as the payment by selecting the buyer (high level buyers can be far away, but the payout is bigger)."}

They can be viewed and started from the basement of &lt;a href=\"Arcades\"&gt;Arcades&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are two types of preparation missions \u2013 required and optional. The former must be completed in order to carry out the heist, while the latter type of missions can be done to significantly lower the difficulty of the heist, but can be skipped if the heist leader wishes to do so. There are three planning boards inside the basement.\nSetup Board.\nThe first board allows the player to view access points that they have photographed during the mission. On this board, the player can also start the previously mentioned mission, as well as . The player does not have to scope out the &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20%26amp%3B%20Resort\"&gt;Casino&lt;/a&gt; for every heist, but can do it as many times as they wish. However, the Vault Contents mission must be completed with every heist.\nAfter the vault contents are identified, the player gains the option of choosing one of the three possible approaches for the heist \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Heist%20-%20Silent%20%26amp%3B%20Sneaky\"&gt;Silent &amp; Sneaky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Heist%20-%20The%20Big%20Con\"&gt;The Big Con&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Heist%20-%20Aggressive\"&gt;Aggressive&lt;/a&gt;. The same approach cannot be chosen twice in a row, so the player must alternate between them. If the same approach is chosen after only one other approach, the Casino will have tougher security, but there will be more valuable rewards.\nAfter the approach is chosen, the player can move onto the second planning board.\nPrep Board.\nOn the second board are listed all the main prep work missions the player can start. On the top left, the player must first choose the gunman, driver, and hacker they wish to employ for the heist. The higher their skill, the higher cut of the total money they take. A better gunman can provide the player with better weapons, a better driver can provide them with better vehicles, and the better the hacker, the more time the players will have inside the vault before they are detected. Only after the player chooses a gunman and driver can they access other missions.\nOnce the player chooses a gunman, they can start the mission, in which they need to source weapons to use for the heist. When a driver is chosen, the mission can be started, where the player needs to obtain vehicles to use after robbing the Casino. Once a hacker is chosen, can be started, in which they need to steal the hacking technology from either the &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Building\"&gt;FIB Building&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pillbox%20Hill\"&gt;Pillbox Hill&lt;/a&gt; or the server farm at &lt;a href=\"NOOSE%20Headquarters\"&gt;NOOSE Headquarters&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeneral Prep Work.\nMost of these missions are listed at the bottom of the board. These are the same for every approach, and most are optional. These are:\nApproach Specific Prep Work.\nThe Big Con.\nFor this approach, at least one type of the following disguises must be obtained, the others then being optional if the leader desires to have multiple choices when choosing an entry tactic.\nIf the heist leader triggered the cutscene introducing &lt;a href=\"Yung%20Ancestor\"&gt;Yung Ancestor&lt;/a&gt; during the \"Setup: Casino Scoping\" mission, they have an additional option for an entry approach which can be chosen after two mission are completed for Yung:\nThe player also must complete the mandatory mission, in which two vault drills must be stolen so the heist crew can access the vault during the heist.\nThe heist leader can also choose to obtain two exit disguises for use after robbing the Casino by completing the optional and missions.\nIf the player has collected all 54 &lt;a href=\"Collectibles\"&gt;collectible&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Playing%20Cards\"&gt;Playing Cards&lt;/a&gt; in Freeroam, the player can choose the \"High Roller\" exit disguise when starting the heist.\nFinale Board.\nThe final board allows the player to start the heist, which will bring up a lobby waiting screen. Once 2-4 players are present, the heist leader can press start, which will put them back on the third planning board.\nHere, the leader can choose the entry and exit points, as well as entry and exit disguises if doing the appropriate approach. They also need to choose from three different buyers. Optionally, the leader can also purchase the \"Clean Vehicle\" and \"Gunman Decoy\" options. The former will place a clean vehicle on the map, which can be used by the crew if their starting vehicles are damaged during the getaway, and to help lose the cops. The latter option will make the gunman act as a decoy during the getaway, lowering the wanted level over time.\nSimilar to other heists in the game, the leader must distribute the money between all players. Every member of the team must get at least 15% of the final payout."}

There are four tiers that players can achieve through various means - these are the Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond tier. As each tier is harder to achieve than the previous, there are more rewards for each tier.\nFirst Qualification Period.\nThe first qualification period started as soon as the update was released, on July 23, and lasted until August 7. All rewards were given away between August 8 and August 13.\nPurchasing the Master Penthouse (or receiving one for free with Twitch Prime) granted players Silver Status. These members later received the \"She's Loaded\" Wall Art and the Diamond Classic Tee.\nSilver Status members who completed the second casino mission, &lt;a href=\"Casino%20-%20House%20Keeping\"&gt;Casino - House Keeping&lt;/a&gt;, were granted the Gold Status. These players later received an &lt;a href=\"Ink%20Inc.\"&gt;Ink Inc.&lt;/a&gt; livery for the &lt;a href=\"Truffade\"&gt;Truffade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrax\"&gt;Thrax&lt;/a&gt; and the Truffade Tee, as well as all Silver Status rewards.\nGold Status members who completed five &lt;a href=\"Casino%20Work\"&gt;Casino Work&lt;/a&gt; missions for &lt;a href=\"Agatha%20Baker\"&gt;Agatha Baker&lt;/a&gt; were granted the Platinum Status. These players later received the Lucky 7s Tattoo and the Kronos \u00c4ra Watch, as well as all previous rewards.\nPlatinum Status members who completed all six casino missions were granted the highest tier possible; the Diamond Status. These members later received two exclusive vehicle liveries - &lt;a href=\"Yeti\"&gt;Yeti Camo&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Enus\"&gt;Enus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Paragon%20R%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;Paragon R (Armored)&lt;/a&gt; for the leader, and &lt;a href=\"eCola\"&gt;eCola&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Annis\"&gt;Annis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"S80RR\"&gt;S80RR&lt;/a&gt; for the crew member, as well as all other rewards given to lower tiers.\nSecond Qualification Period.\nThe second qualification period started on August 15, 2019 and ended on August 21. It was announced alongside the &lt;a href=\"Emerus%20Week\"&gt;Emerus Week&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Events\"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;. The same four tiers are available, which carry over from the first qualification period. This means players retain their status, but can increase it to a higher tier if they wish to - the prerequisites for each tier remain the same.\nRegardless of the status, players still need to log in to \"GTA Online\" to be eligible for the rewards, which will be given away by August 28."}

The soundtrack was created by &lt;a href=\"Oh%20No\"&gt;Oh No&lt;/a&gt; and features stems reused and remixed from the original update to reflect the heists in operation. Three different variations appear, each of which have 2 separate alternative versions which play exclusively during setup work."}

However, prep jobs are restricted to public lobbies.\nIf there is a rival organization/motorcycle club stealing the equipment for the same act, the player will be notified by &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester&lt;/a&gt; and a heist prep icon will be displayed on the map, so the player and their crew can take it for their own. Similarly, if the player is stealing the equipment, they will expect a possible competition from rival Heist crews to take said equipment.\nEach consecutive purchase is more expensive. The first purchase costs $94,500. The cost of outsourcing all preparations is around a half of each heist finale reward on normal difficulty and around 40% on hard difficulty. Purchasing equipment will prevent the leader from progressing The Doomsday Heist challenges."}

It is the heist finale of the Act 3 of &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Heist\"&gt;The Doomsday Heist&lt;/a&gt; and the final mission of the same mission strand.\nDescription.\nThe crew is instructed to go to a lot in &lt;a href=\"Grapeseed\"&gt;Grapeseed&lt;/a&gt; to pick either the &lt;a href=\"Barrage\"&gt;Barrage&lt;/a&gt; ATV or the &lt;a href=\"TM-02%20Khanjali\"&gt;TM-02 Khanjali&lt;/a&gt; tank. &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester&lt;/a&gt; will tell the crew that the vehicle not used by them will be sold for an additional profit for the crew member who set up the operation.\nWith the vehicle picked, the crew is ready to go to the facility's secret entrance in the Mt. Chilliad tunnel. Once close to it, Lester manages to hack the secret entrance door behind a set of electrical boxes so the crew has an opportunity to get inside.\nOnce inside, the crew is instructed to go to the end of the tunnel while dealing with &lt;a href=\"Avon%20Hertz\"&gt;Avon's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cliffford%20Mercenaries\"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt;, who will try to stop the crew with barricades consisting of barrels and &lt;a href=\"Mesa%20Grande\"&gt;Mesas&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up&lt;/a&gt;s. Once the crew reaches the end of the tunnel, they must abandon their vehicle and continue on foot, clearing four Juggernauts armed with &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt;s before moving through the facility. The crew must fight more of Avon's army and an additional Juggernaut before &lt;a href=\"Phoenicia%20Rackman\"&gt;Phoenicia Rackman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Agent%2014\"&gt;Agent 14&lt;/a&gt; instruct the crew to split up and destroy five of Avon's supply boxes which may contain &lt;a href=\"Cliffford\"&gt;Cliffford&lt;/a&gt;'s code. Splitting up is not necessary as both tunnels can be accessed from each other. When this is complete, they are instructed to go to the blast doors. However, Cliffford is able to initiate the launch sequence for the facility. The crew must then fight through two additional Juggernauts and a few more foot soldiers before reaching the blast doors.\nOutside the blast doors, a cutscene plays where the crew is unable to open them as they are hacked shut by Cliffford. Lester, however, tricks Cliffford by saying he has not hacked the door since he never opened it in the first place, and he should prove he can hack it by opening it, after which Cliffford opens the door, allowing the players to progress. Lester will taunt Cliffford for being 'vain and insecure'.\nInside the control room, the crew is instructed to hack four consoles on the second floor to shut down the launch sequence. This must be done within 20 minutes and by one player, whilst the rest of the team defends them from endlessly spawning enemies. The hacking player will be set into a \"minigame\" where they have to rotate a set of pivot points to guide a beam and burst packets (blue nodes) while avoiding the firewalls (red nodes) within a five-minute limit on each console. If the player successfully manages to burst the blue nodes, the hacking will be successful and the team can move on. If over two red firewalls are destroyed, or the player runs out of time, the hacking will fail (the hacker does not need to worry about getting shot to death, as enemies will not target them until they complete each minigame).\nOnce the four consoles are hacked, the launch protocol will shut down, and the rest of Avon's goons can be finished off. After clearing the room, the crew must head to the &lt;a href=\"Orbital%20Cannon\"&gt;Orbital Cannon&lt;/a&gt; controls upstairs to destroy four mobile cloud servers around the state, these taking the form of &lt;a href=\"Brickade\"&gt;Brickade&lt;/a&gt; trucks. Each crew member can use their own terminal, and destroying a truck severely affects Cliffford's functionality to the point that it \"dies\" once all four trucks are destroyed. Avon, however, claims that he will bring the AI back with the original code he still has on his person. Rackman instructs the crew to go to the silo to stop Avon, again while fighting off more mercenaries on the way. The path to this is through close quarter tunnels and a control room.\nOnce the crew arrives, a cutscene plays where Avon takes a Thruster and escapes through the launch chamber. The crew fails to stop him with their &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;s and Lester orders them to take the other Thrusters and chase him. As the cutscene ends, the crew is instructed to chase and kill Avon while taking care of enemies in &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Akula\"&gt;Akula&lt;/a&gt;s. The crew then manages to take out the defense group and ultimately kill Avon. Once the task is done, Agent 14 instructs the crew to regroup at the &lt;a href=\"Galileo%20Observatory\"&gt;Galileo Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, after which the mission is completed.\nAfter delivering the vehicles, a cutscene plays where Mrs. Rackman will thank the team for their efforts, awarding them with a large sum of money before leaving with &lt;a href=\"Agent%2014\"&gt;Agent 14&lt;/a&gt;. Lester then thanks the team as well before parting ways, with the crew members also celebrating."}

The area is characterized by multiple narrow streets lined with towering skyscrapers, most likely office buildings, a handful of cobblestone roads visible in portions of the city, and few green spaces. In comparison to midtown Algonquin, the Exchange's commercial occupants are presumed to lean towards more conservative corporate organizations and big business, and as a result the district is commonly depicted with pedestrians donning suits and other formal attires.\nTransportation.\nPublic transportation.\nThe Exchange is served by the &lt;a href=\"Algonquin%20Outer%20Line\"&gt;Algonquin Outer Line&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Algonquin%20Inner%20Line\"&gt;Algonquin Inner Line&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Subway%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;Liberty City Subway&lt;/a&gt; which pass by &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Gardens%20Station\"&gt;Castle Gardens Station&lt;/a&gt; and by &lt;a href=\"City%20Hall%20Station\"&gt;City Hall Station&lt;/a&gt; respectively."}

They hold a bitter rivalry with the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; gang and the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos&lt;/a&gt; gang on the southeast side in Rancho. Their signature green attire mainly comes from the support of the colours of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Corkers%20Baseball%20Team\"&gt;Los Santos Corkers Baseball Team&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Feud%20Baseball%20Team\"&gt;Feud Baseball Team&lt;/a&gt;.

Also it is clear that the \"Davis Neighborhood Families\" also support the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Dust%20Devils\"&gt;Los Santos Dust Devils&lt;/a&gt; hockey team due to the members of this set seen wearing Dust Devils attire with their logo.\nInfluence.\nThe Families are possibly based upon the gang in , as they control the west side of South LS, just like Crips in real life. They also wear clothing with C's on them, and wear green because of Rockstar switching secondary colors of Crips and . The name of the gang however, appears to be a loose reference to the Bloods (\"family\" and \"blood\").\nThe Families control the entire neighborhoods of &lt;a href=\"Chamberlain%20Hills\"&gt;Chamberlain Hills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strawberry\"&gt;Strawberry&lt;/a&gt;, and also the northwest side of &lt;a href=\"Davis\"&gt;Davis&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href=\"Forum%20Drive\"&gt;Forum Drive&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Heights\"&gt;Crystal Heights&lt;/a&gt; projects are particular hotspots for activity. Families have slightly more territory than Ballas. Members are often seen drinking, driving vehicles, walking dogs, engaging in illegal races, standing on the sidewalks and also battling the police or other gangs if they happen to shoot a gun in their turf. They usually stand in groups of 2-10. Their weapons of choice include &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"SMG\"&gt;SMG&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Action%20Shotgun\"&gt;Pump Action Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;Assault Rifles&lt;/a&gt; (rarely), &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Knife\"&gt;knives&lt;/a&gt;. They are often seen drinking &lt;a href=\"Pi%C3%9Fwasser\"&gt;Pi\u00dfwasser&lt;/a&gt; lager and smoking cigarettes or &lt;a href=\"Weed\"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt;, while chatting about their gang lives and such.\nApparel.\nFranklin and the \"GTA Online\" protagonist can buy some Families apparels, tattoos and hairstyles in \"GTA V\" and \"Online\".\n\"GTA V\".\n&lt;a href=\"Clothing%20in%20GTA%20V/Franklin\"&gt;Clothing&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Tattoo%20Parlors/GTA%20V\"&gt;Tattoos&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Barbers\"&gt;Hairstyles&lt;/a&gt;\n\"GTA Online\".\n&lt;a href=\"Clothing%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Clothing&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Tattoo%20Parlors/GTA%20Online\"&gt;Tattoos&lt;/a&gt;\nSets.\nThere are at least five distinct sets of the Families in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\".\nChamberlain Gangster Families (CGF).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Chamberlain%20Gangster%20Families\"&gt;Chamberlain Gangster Families&lt;/a&gt; are the largest set. Their territory consists of the entire &lt;a href=\"Chamberlain%20Hills\"&gt;Chamberlain Hills&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood. They are also referred to as \"The Hills\", \"Killer Hills\" and the \"26 Set\". They hang around the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Heights\"&gt;Crystal Heights&lt;/a&gt; project buildings. They normally wear black, white, or green track jackets with the Feud or Corkers logo in front as well as green, white or black caps. Other members wear black and white tank tops. CGF is most likely based on the in (which Strawberry is based on), as they are the largest set of Families within Strawberry and the Rollin 60's are the largest Crip set in southwestern Los Angeles. This gang district was mentioned at the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Long%20Stretch\"&gt;The Long Stretch&lt;/a&gt;. While shooting some Ballas, Lamar will shout \"CGF for Life!\". Stretch will also proclaim \"This Chamberlain Gangster Families here!\"\nForum Drive Families (FDF).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Forum%20Drive%20Families\"&gt;Forum Drive Families&lt;/a&gt;, more commonly referred to as the \"Forum Gangsters\" are the secondary set of the Chamberlain Gangster Families and also the set of &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt;. Ironically, they both founded this set at some point before the beginning of the events of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;. Lamar and Franklin proceed with growing their set who are also known as the \"88 Set\".\nCarson Avenue Families (CAF).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Carson%20Avenue%20Families\"&gt;Carson Avenue Families&lt;/a&gt; are hostile to the Chamberlain Gangsters and presumably other sets, and are led by someone known only as &lt;a href=\"The%20Boss%20%28Families%29\"&gt;\"The Boss\"&lt;/a&gt;. Their territory consists of the &lt;a href=\"Strawberry\"&gt;Strawberry&lt;/a&gt; section of &lt;a href=\"Carson%20Avenue\"&gt;Carson Avenue&lt;/a&gt; though they sometimes appear in &lt;a href=\"Chamberlain%20Hills\"&gt;Chamberlain Hills&lt;/a&gt;. Members of this set often sport varsity jacket attire with the letter \"C\" for Chamberlain, which also stands for \"Corkers\", the baseball team supported by the gang. Other members wear green, black or white shirts with either the Feud or Corkers logo. Possibly based on Eight Tray Gangster Crips, As they are hostile to CGF, who is based on Rollin 60s Neighborhood Crips.\nDavis Neighborhood Families (DNF).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Davis%20Neighborhood%20Families\"&gt;Davis Neighborhood Families&lt;/a&gt; territory consists of the northwest part of &lt;a href=\"Davis\"&gt;Davis&lt;/a&gt;. They currently are at war with the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD_Universe%29\"&gt;East Side Ballas&lt;/a&gt; set, due to proximity of the territories. &lt;a href=\"Vernon\"&gt;Vernon&lt;/a&gt; is the only known members of this set. They are known as \"Dirty Davis Devils\" or \"Davis Devils\". They can often be seen around Chamberlain Set territories (mainly &lt;a href=\"Forum%20Drive\"&gt;Forum Drive&lt;/a&gt;) and sometimes on south and northwest of Davis. Members can be identified by their white, grey, and black sport clothes, many with the word \"Davis\" on the back. The fronts will have one of three or four &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Dust%20Devils\"&gt;Los Santos Dust Devils&lt;/a&gt; designs. Some members have a dust tornado in the front of their shirt which is one of the logos for the team. Others wear the normal Families outfits of green plaid shirts, beanie hats, green, black feud caps. Sometimes, when starting a fight with someone from the set, they can be heard screaming: \"Davis Gang, bitch!\" or \"DNFG\". Davis Neighborhood Families could be based on the Neighbor Hood Crip Card, as the Families are based on the Crips and Davis is based on The Neighborhood Card.\nGrove Street Families (GSF).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families%20%28The%20Families%20set%29\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt; was the most famous set of The Families in the 1990s.

The gang disbanded after the 1990s, and their current whereabouts are unknown. It is suggested that many of them became wealthy CEOs. The Grove Street set seems to be regarded as the most famous set of all, with &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Jimmy De Santa&lt;/a&gt; asking Franklin if he is from the Grove Street Families set or whether it is a myth during a friendship activity.

The usage of the term \"collection\", which here denotes a group of things, may be a pun exploiting another sense of the term, which denotes the process of collecting something \u2013 namely menstrual blood.\nThis is likely a mockery of the crude and contemptible nature of contemporary art, a style of visual art infamous for its trope which consists in splattering paint haphazardly.

In order to get access to &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Trotman\"&gt;Ray Trotman&lt;/a&gt;'s penthouse, the player must hack the service room door keypad through a hacking minigame. Once inside, the player must plant EMP charges on electrical units to be used to cut the power off the building and disable the alarms.\nAfter the player locates the hatch and triggers the EMP, they are instructed to access Trotman's penthouse via the emergency hatch downstairs.

The player must find the hidden switch to open the secret room using the signal strength indicator displayed on the HUD.\nFlipping the switch will reveal Trotman's secret room. In order to get access, the player must hack the door through the Print Cloner v1.0 hacking minigame. The hack completion is followed by a scene of the player bypassing the face recognition security measures by scanning a recreation of Trotman's face and retina using their phone.\nInside Trotman's collection of art, the player can collect any valuables from inside the display cases. Stealing the main target piece of art in the middle display case will activate a pressure plate trap, releasing a hazardous security measure on the room after approximately 10 seconds, which will drain away the player's &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; quickly as long as they remain in the affected area.\nWith the target item collected, the player is free to escape through the elevator, leading to the parking garage. The player must escape Trotman's security and deliver the item to the buyer, completing the mission.\nBonus Reward.\nThe player will receive an additional bonus reward of $50,000 (&lt;a href=\"GTA%2B\"&gt;GTA+&lt;/a&gt; members will have 3 times the reward for the challenge bonus) for the completion of The Black Box File with the following requirements:\nOversights.\nThe thumbnail for the Ornamental Egg variant of the The Fine Art File finale is a duplicate of the Tiki Statue thumbnail.

Subsequent replays incur 10% of the base total payout, $11,500.\nDescription.\nThe crew of two players will be tasked by Lester to steal bonds from safety deposit box 167 at the &lt;a href=\"Fleeca\"&gt;Fleeca&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Ocean%20Highway\"&gt;Great Ocean Highway&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Banham%20Canyon\"&gt;Banham Canyon&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter completing the set-up missions, the finale sees the two players take up the role of Driver and Driller. By default, the host is assigned as Driller with a 60% take and the crew member as Driver with a 40% take, but this can all be changed once the game finishes introducing the heist board.\nThe Driver takes control of the &lt;a href=\"Fleeca%20Job%20-%20Kuruma\"&gt;stolen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kuruma%20%28Armored%29\"&gt;armored Kuruma&lt;/a&gt; and drives to the Fleeca Bank with the Driller on board. If the Driller has not completed the hacking minigame yet, the Driver must wait until the other player completes said hacking. After arriving at the destination, they both equip &lt;a href=\"Masks%20%28clothing%29\"&gt;masks&lt;/a&gt; and go into the bank.\nThe Driver controls the &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; witnesses and shoots out the four ceiling-mounted security cameras; the crew is provided &lt;a href=\"Pump%20Shotgun\"&gt;Pump Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;s for this. The Driver must destroy the cameras quickly. An on-screen indicator shows the driver the level of intimidation. They must not kill any of the witnesses but if the intimidation level drops to the minimum, the teller will trip the alarm to alert the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt;. Once the Driller secures the deposit box, the alarm will go off and the Driver is free to run for the Kuruma and wait for the Driller to get in.\nThe Driller boards the armored Kuruma as a passenger. While the Driver gets to the bank, the Driller hacks their security system with the same &lt;a href=\"Hacking\"&gt;hacking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hacking%23VLSI%20Circuit%20Breaker%202.0\"&gt;minigame&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Fleeca%20Job%20-%20Scope%20Out\"&gt;previous mission&lt;/a&gt;. Just like before, the minigame consists of the player moving a constantly moving line from a start point to an end point. If it touches anything but the exit it fails and has to be restarted. There are 3 levels with each one increasing the difficulty of the maze. Continued failure slows down the speed of the point but reduces the achievement level. After completing the minigame, the player is directed to use the cellphone to unlock the bank's vault and equip the given mask to go into the bank.\nWhile the Driver controls the witnesses, the Driller goes to the safety deposit boxes at the rear of the bank and plays a &lt;a href=\"Heists%20Update%23Drilling\"&gt;drilling minigame&lt;/a&gt; to open up the box and take the contents. The Driller's goal is to drill through the lock of Safety Deposit Box 167 (represented on the &lt;a href=\"HUD\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; as a 2D lock mechanism with four pins). If the drill is pushed too hard, it overheats, turning the bit red and taking a few seconds for the bit to cool down. The Driller controls the speed the bit turns using the controller trigger (or the assigned \"Fire\" button/key on the &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;), and how hard the bit is pushed into lock using the left analog stick for controllers/pushing the mouse forward to push in or drawing it backwards to back off on PC.\nAfter opening the deposit box, the crew will receive a three-star &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;wanted level&lt;/a&gt;. They return to the Kuruma and Lester will say that he has paid a &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Toh\"&gt;getaway guy&lt;/a&gt;, who is waiting for the crew at the &lt;a href=\"Zancudo%20Bridge\"&gt;Zancudo Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. There will be multiple police roadblocks along the way, consisting of &lt;a href=\"Interceptor\"&gt;Police Cruisers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20SUV\"&gt;Sheriff SUV&lt;/a&gt;s. The \"getaway guy\", Eddie Toh, will be piloting a &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; with an electromagnet. The players, matching speed with the Cargobob, drive below the magnet before being picked up and promptly escaping.\nAfter the getaway, a cutscene is triggered where the crew arrives at the factory, with Lester stepping outside and receiving the deposit box from the driller. He congratulates the crew, stating that he will call them up again \"if the thing that they talked about comes up\", but warns them to \"not get clingy\".\nAfter the cutscene, the mission is completed.

Designed in a distinctively East Asian theme, the casino serves as the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20Triads\"&gt;Triad&lt;/a&gt;'s hub of operation in Las Venturas (although no group of Triads can be seen outside the casino) and thus serves as a contact point for &lt;a href=\"Wu%20Zi%20Mu\"&gt;Wu Zi Mu&lt;/a&gt; in the city and later, the organization point for the casino heist mission strand.\nBeing an accessible casino, the casino's interior is also decked in oriental styling, and offers &lt;a href=\"CJ\"&gt;CJ&lt;/a&gt; access to various &lt;a href=\"Gambling\"&gt;playable gambling facilities&lt;/a&gt;, including blackjack and roulette tables, video poker, slot machines, as well as various wheels of fortune; security personnel in suits are also numerous in the casino floor, being programmed to attack the player if they choose to behave violently in the casino. Other accessible features within the casino are non-interactive, including a central bar (where female bartenders dressed in cheongsam-like minidresses work), the dining area of its restaurant, and a golden statue of Buddha with reels from a slot machine resting on a pile of coins.\nThe casino additionally provides the player with a &lt;a href=\"Save%20Points%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;save point&lt;/a&gt; outside the entrance available after &lt;a href=\"Learning%20to%20Fly\"&gt;Learning to Fly&lt;/a&gt;; weapons also spawn in front of the entrance as a reward for collecting all &lt;a href=\"horseshoes\"&gt;horseshoes&lt;/a&gt; in and around the city.\nIn a similar fashion to the other two accessible casinos, three songs from &lt;a href=\"Master%20Sounds%2098.3\"&gt;Master Sounds 98.3&lt;/a&gt; can be heard while inside:\nInfluence.\nThe Four Dragons Casino is suggestively based on the in , , which operated from 1979 to 2012 under said name. In 2014, it was renamed The Linq. The casino might also be inspired by (a Chinese themed casino also set in Las Vegas) from the 2001 film \"\".\nThe casino is named after the , sometimes named the Four Asian Dragons, the four highly developed Asian economies (&lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong\"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;, , &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Taiwan\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;) which began their rise during the 1980s.\nInaccessible Interiors.\nThere are two interiors in The Four Dragons Casino that are normally inaccessible to the player. These interiors are seen only during cutscenes. The first is a management room only seen during the cutscenes for the missions &lt;a href=\"Fender%20Ketchup\"&gt;Fender Ketchup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Explosive%20Situation\"&gt;Explosive Situation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"You%27ve%20Had%20Your%20Chips\"&gt;You've Had Your Chips&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fish%20in%20a%20Barrel\"&gt;Fish in a Barrel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"A%20Home%20in%20the%20Hills\"&gt;A Home in the Hills&lt;/a&gt;, comprising a large room with a desk, fish tank, and CCTV screens. The other is a custodian closet in the basement of the casino, containing a broken slot machine, a generator, and an air vent; it is seen in several missions, specifically being used for planning in the heist missions.\nThe interiors can be accessed through the use of &lt;a href=\"Cheats%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;cheats&lt;/a&gt; (allowing access into the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Interiors%20Universe\"&gt;interior realm&lt;/a&gt;) or &lt;a href=\"modifications\"&gt;modifications&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nFollowing the mission &lt;a href=\"Learning%20to%20Fly\"&gt;Learning to Fly&lt;/a&gt;, Woozie informs CJ that he has opened a new casino in Las Venturas, which turns out to be The Four Dragons. After CJ meets him at the casino, Woozie explains that the &lt;a href=\"Sindacco%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Sindacco Family&lt;/a&gt; are causing problems to his casino. CJ helps Woozie and his casino by taking down the Sindaccos for good. As a reward, Woozie offers CJ a one-third co-ownership of the casino along with &lt;a href=\"Ran%20Fa%20Li\"&gt;Ran Fa Li&lt;/a&gt;, which CJ accepts.\nThe casino also serves as a base for planning a &lt;a href=\"Breaking%20the%20Bank%20at%20Caligula%27s\"&gt;heist&lt;/a&gt; on a rival casino, &lt;a href=\"Caligula%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Caligula's&lt;/a&gt;.\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\nThe casino serves as a starting point for the following missions:"}
