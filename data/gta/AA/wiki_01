Without suspicion, Lamar comes to his friend, &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Clinton%20Residence\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; to persuade him to do the deal together, which incidentally ends up having &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; taking part as well, when he shows up and decides to join them, much to Lamar's annoyance.\nThe trio, along with Lamar's dog &lt;a href=\"Chop\"&gt;Chop&lt;/a&gt;, come to the dealer's house and, upon Lamar showing him the &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt;, the dealer presents the three men with a white block wrapped in plastic. He cuts it open and lets Lamar smell the &lt;a href=\"knife\"&gt;knife&lt;/a&gt; he used. Lamar, extremely eager, is ready to hand over the cash for it, but Trevor is skeptical. He asks if they can take a sample from the other side of the brick, but the dealer refuses to do so and tells them to leave. As Trevor grows frustrated, he snatches the block from out of the dealer's hands, and snaps it in half, proving his skepticism to be correct after all and that it was just drywall filler with only a small bag of actual drugs inside it.\nThe dealer reacts by calling the aid of his fellow gang members and immediately shuts the door, making Trevor, Franklin and Lamar &lt;a href=\"Hood%20Safari\"&gt;fight their way out of Grove Street&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacter.\nAppearance.\nThe drug dealer looks similar to the other Ballas in terms of facial features. Despite his association with the gang, he doesn't wear purple. He wears a grey open hoodie, with a blue \"Guadalupe\" t-shirt underneath, which is similar to the ones worn by the &lt;a href=\"Marabunta%20Grande\"&gt;Marabunta Grande&lt;/a&gt;. He also wears light blue shorts with white sneakers."}

It is the protagonistic group in the game, as the game's main &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;) is among its leaders.\nDescription.\nThe Grove Street Families is an African-American street gang and one of the oldest street gangs in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;. They are also the native gang of protagonist &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;. They are the sworn enemy of the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt;, an intense and ongoing rivalry as part of the &lt;a href=\"Ballas-Grove%20Street%20gang%20war%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas-Grove Street War&lt;/a&gt;. The Families also maintain rivalries with the two Mexican gangs in Los Santos \u2013 the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos Vagos&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Varrios Los Aztecas&lt;/a&gt;. Their rivalry with the Varrios Los Aztecas is not nearly as intense as it is with the Ballas and Vagos. However, both gangs will still commonly fight. &lt;a href=\"Kendl%20Johnson\"&gt;Kendl&lt;/a&gt; (sister of Grove Street Leader Sweet and CJ) ends up dating &lt;a href=\"Cesar%20Vialpando\"&gt;a high-ranking member of the Aztecas&lt;/a&gt; while CJ befriends him \u2013 much to Sweet's disapproval.\nMost of their territory can be found in the poorer/run-down neighborhoods in the far east of the city, though they also have small pockets of territory elsewhere \u2013 including the rich area of &lt;a href=\"Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; and the popular tourist destination of &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Maria%20Beach\"&gt;Santa Maria Beach&lt;/a&gt;. They are easily identifiable by their green gang color.\nThey are headed by &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Johnson\"&gt;Sean \"Sweet\" Johnson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;Carl Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, as well as former lieutenants and OGs, &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Lance \"Ryder\" Wilson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke\"&gt;Melvin \"Big Smoke\" Harris&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs far as street gangs in \"GTA San Andreas\" go, the GSF are depicted as more honorable than their rival gangs. Coming from a background of older traditions, they are against hard &lt;a href=\"drugs\"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt; being sold on their turf as opposed to the Ballas and Vagos. They are very stubborn and Sweet refuses to adapt to changes in the Los Santos criminal underworld. They \"are\" well known, however, for committing numerous other crimes and violent acts including gun running/arms-trafficking, gang-banging, gang warfare, murder, robbery, burglary/theft, gang-related homicide, vandalism, and street violence.\nGSF members drive the &lt;a href=\"Greenwood%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Greenwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Voodoo%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Voodoo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Savanna\"&gt;Savanna&lt;/a&gt;. Their favorite radio station is the &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Radio Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. They also have three different skins that will walk and drive around their territories.\nInitially, in the beginning of the game, Grove Street members are mostly unarmed, with some carrying &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;pistols&lt;/a&gt;, and they will start carrying &lt;a href=\"Tec-9\"&gt;Tec-9&lt;/a&gt;s after the completion of &lt;a href=\"Robbing%20Uncle%20Sam\"&gt;Robbing Uncle Sam&lt;/a&gt;. If the player sprays over all &lt;a href=\"tags\"&gt;tags&lt;/a&gt; in Los Santos, they will wield &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Eagle\"&gt;Desert Eagles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;SMGs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"knife\"&gt;knives&lt;/a&gt; instead. They can occasionally be seen smoking &lt;a href=\"Weed\"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt; and drinking malt liquor while talking and hanging around in groups. Green clothing is a dead give-away and members will often flash their gang handsigns. Upon spotting a &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Balla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vago&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Azteca gang member&lt;/a&gt;, they will often engage in a violent confrontation (especially Ballas). Members of the families, like other &lt;a href=\"pedestrians\"&gt;pedestrians&lt;/a&gt;, will often comment on CJ's attire, physical looks, or his vehicle.\nTheir territory includes:\nApparel.\nCarl can buy some GSF apparels in many clothing retailers.\nHistory.\nThe Grove Street Families were formed in &lt;a href=\"Ganton\"&gt;Ganton&lt;/a&gt; (initially in Grove Street) before spreading to the rest of Ganton and other neighborhoods. History before this time period (late 80s) is unknown, and much of what happened to the Families during the late 80s is also unknown. However, what is known is that the Families are one of the oldest gangs in Los Santos \u2013 this possibly means that they are older than the Ballas (who formed during the 1970s) \u2013 giving the possibility that the Families evolved from the 1960s, or possibly even earlier.\nThe Families also have a history of a traditional, intense, and bloody rivalry with the Ballas. Specifically when the gang war started is unknown, but the rivalry between the two gangs was in full swing as early as &lt;a href=\"1987\"&gt;1987&lt;/a&gt;. The start and reason of their rivalry with the Los Santos Mexican gangs is unknown, though their rivalry with the Vagos has most likely developed due to their expansion and growth around their territory along with their heavy crack-cocaine influence. Despite being divided into different sets, the Families were much more united before the early 1990s.\nWhile Sweet is adamantly anti-narcotic, Smoke believes that the GSF have fallen from power because of his refusal to sell drugs. Their unwillingness to enter the drug trade has dragged the Grove Street Families out of prominence in the years leading up to the game's storyline. The fact that Sweet insists the gang shouldn't deal in narcotics, the deaths of OGs such as &lt;a href=\"Tony%20%28GSF%29\"&gt;Tony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Big%20Devil\"&gt;Big Devil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Little%20Devil\"&gt;Little Devil&lt;/a&gt;, and the abandonment of OGs such as &lt;a href=\"Big%20Bear\"&gt;Big Bear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"B%20Dup\"&gt;B Dup&lt;/a&gt; has largely weakened them from their previous dominant position in Los Santos. Likewise, the splitting of the Grove Families into different enemy sets \u2013 the Temple Drive Families and the Seville Boulevard Families has massively increased violence from within the families and further weakened them. The fact that the Ballas are extremely successful at spreading crack cocaine into their territory to weaken the Families (also in-part due to Big Smoke's involvement) has led to the sorry state of the GSF upon CJ's &lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Beginning\"&gt;return&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1992\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrior to 1992, the Families also controlled the southern portion of &lt;a href=\"East%20Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;East Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Idlewood\"&gt;Idlewood&lt;/a&gt; (although they lost Idlewood before 1987, as during the mission &lt;a href=\"Cleaning%20the%20Hood\"&gt;Cleaning the Hood&lt;/a&gt;, Carl seems to know it is Ballas turf). They likely also controlled &lt;a href=\"Willowfield\"&gt;Willowfield&lt;/a&gt; due to &lt;a href=\"Emmet%27s\"&gt;Emmet's&lt;/a&gt; presence there; specifically the Seville Boulevard Families.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nDuring the beginning of the game, and upon Carl Johnson's return from &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, the Grove Street Families are the smallest, least powerful, and least influential gang in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;. A variety of problems has led to their demise \u2013 including the deaths of many high-ranking members/OGs (&lt;a href=\"Little%20Devil\"&gt;Little Devil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Big%20Devil\"&gt;Big Devil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tony%20%28GSF%29\"&gt;Tony&lt;/a&gt;) along with the death of Sweet's (leader of the Grove Street Families) family members (&lt;a href=\"Brian%20Johnson\"&gt;Brian Johnson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Johnson\"&gt;Beverly Johnson&lt;/a&gt;). On top of this, the Grove Street Families have split up into different warring sets (Temple Drive Families and the Seville Boulevard Families) \u2013 causing inter-hostilities.\nFurther, their refusal to enter the drugs trade (especially crack &lt;a href=\"cocaine\"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt;) has put them at a severe disadvantage to the other gangs (such as the Ballas), who are able to make much profit from this. The GSF also face the major problem of crack-cocaine spread throughout their territory (largely due to the Ballas and Big Smoke). Crack-cocaine turns members into weak and hopeless addicts and influences high-ranking members with the money that can be made from the drugs trade (as is the case with &lt;a href=\"B-Dup\"&gt;B-Dup&lt;/a&gt;); thus, drawing them away from gang-banging.\nThe Ballas &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20%26amp%3B%20Kendl\"&gt;attempt to finish off the remaining OGs in a drive-by shooting&lt;/a&gt; as they are leaving the funeral of Beverly Johnson. However, they are only successful at destroying Big Smoke's &lt;a href=\"Perennial\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt;. The remaining OGs escape to Grove Street on bicycle while avoiding the Ballas car.\nThe Grove Street Families then &lt;a href=\"Cleaning%20the%20Hood\"&gt;attempt to decrease the influence of crack-cocaine in their territory&lt;/a&gt; by killing some Ballas members at a crack house in Idlewood. Sweet orders CJ and Ryder for the mission, and they successfully kill the Ballas inside the house. This gradually decreases the influence of crack-cocaine in GSF territory, and drug dealers become less prevalent on the streets in &lt;a href=\"Ganton\"&gt;Ganton&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn retaliation for the events of the previous mission, &lt;a href=\"Drive-Thru\"&gt;the Kilo Tray Ballas attempt a drive-by on Grove Street&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily, Sweet, CJ, Ryder, and Big Smoke are able to catch them on the way to Grove Street while pulling out of a &lt;a href=\"Cluckin%27%20Bell%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell&lt;/a&gt; drive-thru in Willowfield. A car chase follows, and the OGs are able to destroy the car and kill the Ballas.\nThe Grove Street Families then gain a substantial victory of the Ballas when &lt;a href=\"Drive-By\"&gt;CJ, Ryder, Sweet, and Big Smoke went into the Ballas' territories and killed more than a dozen of the Rollin' Heights Ballas and the Kilo Tray Ballas in a drive-by shooting&lt;/a&gt;.\nSweet then goes to &lt;a href=\"Sweet%27s%20Girlfriend\"&gt;his girlfriend's&lt;/a&gt; house in Playa del Seville, but unfortunately, &lt;a href=\"Sweet%27s%20Girl\"&gt;he is caught by the Seville Boulevard Families&lt;/a&gt; (an enemy Grove set). CJ then killed every Seville Boulevard Families member who was attacking Sweet. Sweet states that there needs to be an end to \"green-on-green\" violence if the GSF are ever able to become strong again.\nCJ and Ryder stole various weaponry and ammunition in Los Santos in the missions &lt;a href=\"Home%20Invasion\"&gt;Home Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Catalyst\"&gt;Catalyst&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Robbing%20Uncle%20Sam\"&gt;Robbing Uncle Sam&lt;/a&gt;. In doing so, the Grove Street Families become better equipped and start carrying Tec-9 submachine guns.\nSweet then gets word that a former unnamed member of the Grove Street Families (now a Balla) has been selling drugs, and is now in-hiding with the Ballas at Glen Park. &lt;a href=\"Doberman\"&gt;Sweet orders CJ to kill him&lt;/a&gt;. CJ then kills the traitor and many other Ballas at Glen Park during a gang war. Following the gang war, the Grove Street Families gain the territory of Glen Park from the Ballas. At this point, the GSF are now much stronger and are on a more equal footing with the Ballas.\nThe Ballas, in retaliation for the previous attacks, &lt;a href=\"House%20Party\"&gt;attempt to start a gang war right on Grove Street&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily, a member of the Families is able to catch the Ballas on the way and warn Sweet and the OGs, who are then able to prepare. They block off Grove Street and prepare themselves. CJ, Sweet, and other members of the GSF are then able to successfully defend their territory.\n&lt;a href=\"Los%20Sepulcros\"&gt;The Ballas then hold a funeral for Little Weasel&lt;/a&gt;, a Ballas member whom CJ and Smoke previously &lt;a href=\"Drive-By\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; in a drive-by shooting. Many Ballas OGs are attending the funeral (including &lt;a href=\"Kane\"&gt;Kane&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Front%20Yard%20Ballas\"&gt;Front Yard Ballas&lt;/a&gt;). CJ, Sweet, and members of the GSF are able to crash the funeral and kill many high-ranking Ballas members (including Kane).\nIn an attempt to fully bring the Grove Street Families back to their full power, &lt;a href=\"Reuniting%20the%20Families\"&gt;a meeting is organized between the three different Family sets&lt;/a&gt; (Ganton, Playa de Seville, and Temple) at the &lt;a href=\"Jefferson%20Motel\"&gt;Jefferson Motel&lt;/a&gt;. Sweet, CJ, Big Smoke, and Ryder attend the meeting, and Sweet is voted the representative for the Grove Street Families. However, the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Special%20Weapons%20and%20Tactics\"&gt;S.W.A.T.&lt;/a&gt; raids and breaks-up the meeting, and a battle ensues inside the motel between Families gang members and S.W.A.T. officers. Luckily, CJ managed to rescue Sweet, and they are able to escape with the help of Big Smoke and Ryder.\nIn an attempt to fully finish the Ballas, &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Sabre\"&gt;a large gang war is organized between the Ballas and the Families&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"Mulholland%20Intersection\"&gt;Mulholland Intersection&lt;/a&gt;. However, Sweet is shot and injured, and the police manage to break up the gang war. Sweet is then arrested and sent to a prison hospital upstate, while CJ is captured by &lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt; and warned to stay away from Big Smoke. At this point, both Ryder and Big Smoke have completely defected from the Grove Street Families and into the crack-cocaine business, aligning themselves with C.R.A.S.H. and the Ballas, as well as handing over the green &lt;a href=\"Sabre\"&gt;Sabre&lt;/a&gt; involved in &lt;a href=\"The%20Introduction\"&gt;the murder of Carl's mother&lt;/a&gt; to C.R.A.S.H. officers.\nThis leaves the GSF with no leaders or OGs. They soon fall from power again and become subservient to the Ballas and Vagos. Remaining GSF members are either dead, imprisoned, addicted to drugs, go into hiding, left the gang, defect to the Ballas, or become employed by Big Smoke and his drug organization (as seen in the drug courier missions). The Ballas resume spreading crack-cocaine through their territory again to control them. Soon enough, the Ballas manage to control the entirety of what had been GSF territory \u2013 including Ganton and Grove Street, Playa del Seville, Temple, the Vinewood Cemetery, and Santa Maria Beach. They also recapture back Glen Park. The Families and their allies, the &lt;a href=\"Varrios%20Los%20Aztecas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Varrios Los Aztecas&lt;/a&gt; (who begin to suffer the same fate), essentially become nearly defunct and inactive and the Ballas and Vagos control the streets of Los Santos. Carl is forced to continue working for &lt;a href=\"C.R.A.S.H.\"&gt;C.R.A.S.H.&lt;/a&gt; away from the city in exile.\nThe Grove Street Families then have no more significance throughout the rest of the middle-game, apart for some who work with Big Smoke and Ryder while CJ becomes enveloped in a new lifestyle away from gang-banging and \"hood life\" while Sweet is incarcerated.\nHowever, Sweet's release from prison, courtesy of &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Toreno\"&gt;Mike Toreno&lt;/a&gt;, and CJ's second return to Los Santos with Sweet allows the gang to rise and reform again (now co-headed by Carl and Sweet Johnson) and regain most of their lost turf from the &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; while destroying the crack-cocaine influence again during the missions &lt;a href=\"Home%20Coming\"&gt;Home Coming&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Beat%20Down%20on%20B%20Dup\"&gt;Beat Down on B Dup&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Grove%204%20Life\"&gt;Grove 4 Life&lt;/a&gt;. That same year, &lt;a href=\"Big%20Smoke%27s%20Crack%20Palace\"&gt;Big Smoke's Crack Palace&lt;/a&gt; is destroyed by Frank Tenpenny by shooting a generator during &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20the%20Line\"&gt;the final mission&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 greatly diminishing the crack-cocaine trade in Los Santos and further strengthening the position of the Families.\nDepending on the player's actions, it is possible to take some or all of the Ballas' and Vagos' turf for the GSF as part of the &lt;a href=\"Gang%20Warfare%20in%20GTA%20San%20Andreas\"&gt;gang warfare feature&lt;/a&gt;, causing the GSF to potentially become the largest and most powerful gang in Los Santos with no major threats anymore. If the player successfully takes over the entire turf in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, then their turfs will no longer come under attack.\nFurther Notes.\nIn , it is mentioned that a street gang named \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Families\"&gt;The Families&lt;/a&gt;\" originally had a set known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20Families%20%28The%20Families%20set%29\"&gt;Grove Street Families&lt;/a&gt;\", which was named after a &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;street&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Davis\"&gt;Davis&lt;/a&gt;, rather than the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Street%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ganton\"&gt;Ganton&lt;/a&gt; from \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\". The gang set existed in the 1990s and disbanded at some point before 2013.\nHowever, as confirmed by Rockstar Games several times, the timeline of &lt;a href=\"Universes\"&gt;each \"Grand Theft Auto\" universe&lt;/a&gt; is designed to be completely separate to each other so that no physically appearing characters or storylines would overlap, therefore the events of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" (set in the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;) have never happened in the \"Grand Theft Auto V\"s timeline (set in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;), the characters from \"GTA San Andreas\" have never existed in \"GTA V\"s &lt;a href=\"Canon\"&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt; and, according to former VP of Creativity for Rockstar Games &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Houser\"&gt;Dan Houser&lt;/a&gt;, previous universe characters are treated as \"mythical characters from a bygone era\", except in-game radio station personalities and celebrities. \nAn easter egg in , the game that started the HD Universe canon, suggests that Carl Johnson, along with the other 3D Universe protagonists, are dead. However, this is simply to commemorate the game being the beginning of a new era and it is not considered canon. Rockstar Games have stated in a Q&amp;A on Rockstar Newswire that this was just \"a little joke to our fans\". \nSets.\nThere are three distinct sets of the Grove Street Families:\nThe sets get their name from their territory. For example, the Grove Street Families get their name from their formation in Grove Street, Ganton. The Seville Boulevard Families get their name from their territory \u2013 Playa del Seville, and the Temple Drive Families get their name from their main turf \u2013 Temple. All sets are part of the \"Family\" banner, and all wear green. The differences are based on different territories/neighborhoods, and possibly a different approach to the drugs trade. It is known the Grove Street Families are heavily against drug trafficking, but it is possible that the Seville Boulevard and Temple Drive Families are involved with narcotics due to them splitting from the Grove Street Families, though this is never mentioned in the game. Either way, they eventually reunite as allied sets with the Grove Street Families resuming the position of the most dominant, active, and powerful set, meaning that any narcotics business the other family sets were involved with would have ended.\nHistorically, all sets were originally one with the Grove Street Families, but split up from the GSF during the five years of Carl's absence. Earlier in the game, they are not on good terms with each other, primarily because of Grove Street's opposition to drug trafficking, which is one reason for why the gang has weakened, but as stated, they are later allied and reunited again.\nInterestingly, the Family-on-Family violence is only referenced in the games storyline. If the player actually walks into Playa del Seville or Temple, the families there will react exactly the same as they would in Ganton and Grove Street. CJ can even recruit members in these areas.

It takes certain styling cues from the , such as the headlights, the hood, and smoke stacks. It also has a much larger version of the grille seen on the &lt;a href=\"Speedo\"&gt;Speedo&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn is based on the .\nThe Guardian is characterized by its large size and tall profile, featuring a front end mostly dominated by the mesh grille with seven horizontal separations on it, with the middle one being wider and bearing the manufacturer badge on the center. The outer edges of the truck features dual square headlights and small turn signals, while the bottom side features a small bumper with rectangular open sections. The front compartment hinges from the front and features a small intake on the upper side, as well as bulky fenders.\nThe sides of the truck denote the bulky appearance, with a large cabin, black mirror wings, rear handle bars and large truck-style exhaust pipes fitted with heat shields around the same height as the cab. On the bottom side, a set of mudguards can be seen behind the wheels and a \"Black Extended Fuel Tanks\" options derived from the &lt;a href=\"Sandking%20XL\"&gt;Sandking XL&lt;/a&gt; (albeit featuring bolted-on details around it and replacing the rear storage boxes with small ladder steps for the truck bed).\nThe rear of the vehicle consists of a truck bed with wide fenders, rear bumper, rectangle tail lights and an exposed section of the chassis. The tailgate bears the manufacturer emblem on the center and two toolboxes are seen on the bed, serving as the additional seats for the passengers.\nThe underside of the Guardian is unique, in that it features a driveshaft loop similar to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Liberator\"&gt;Liberator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marshall\"&gt;Marshall&lt;/a&gt;, which protects the driveshaft from damage on its underside if was to fall off in the event of a U-joint (Universal Joint) failure, as in normal circumstances it would continue to spin in an aggressive rotation without the loop. It also has a set of impact struts and shock absorbers derived from the aforementioned monster trucks. Its interior uses the same digital dials as the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent\"&gt;Insurgent&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe primary color of the vehicle is applied on the body and the driveshaft loops, while the secondary color is applied on the grille, bumpers and extended fuel tanks. The wheels appear to be similar to the ones on the &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;, although featuring painted rims with grey centercaps.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Guardian has excellent speed and maneuverability for such a heavy vehicle with its turbo diesel engine, 6-speed transmission and all-wheel-drive layout (35% front, 65% rear). Durability is reasonable against traffic collisions and gunshots, although fishtailing can be a problem at medium speeds. The Guardian may not be able to push certain cars out of the way, but with good speed and durability, that is considered unnecessary. The Guardian is also competent at off-roading, and its elevated ground clearance means that it can ford areas of shallow water without suffering from a decrease in speed. Any players that stand on the back of the vehicle won't fall off when the vehicle moves, allowing them to use any weapon.\nDespite the engine appearing to be a 3-cylinder from the exterior, using the &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Editor\"&gt;Rockstar Editor&lt;/a&gt;, if the player positions the camera inside the engine bay, an extra inlet and exhaust pipe on the manifolds can be found behind the wall column separating the interior from the engine bay, making the engine a 4-cylinder. It shares the same engine sound as vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Granger\"&gt;Granger&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bison\"&gt;Bison&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpecial Variants.\nMoving Target.\nPre-modified variants of the Guardian can appear as a random Moving Target vehicle in the &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events\"&gt;Freemode Event&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moving%20Target\"&gt;Moving Target&lt;/a&gt;, as part of the &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events%20Update\"&gt;Freemode Events Update&lt;/a&gt;. The first set cannot be recreated in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; or any other mod shop as it has a unique primary color."}

Get one of the Uzis that the dead Haitians drop and then get on the dead guy's bike and chase the other guy. The objective in this section is to kill the Haitian, do it in any way, as long as he doesn't escape, except by making his bike explode while he is riding it: this torches the money, failing the mission.\nOnce he is killed, grab the briefcase he drops with Diaz's money in it and go back to where Diaz is, give him the money, and the mission is complete.\nMission Objectives.\nIn order to complete the mission the player must:\nReward.\nThe reward for completing this mission is &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;1000 and the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Chase\"&gt;The Chase&lt;/a&gt; is unlocked.

The name of the weapon is a parody to The Trench Broom and the Chicago Typewriter, two informal names of the Thompson Submachine Gun. The stock is derived from the later M1 &amp; M1A1 Thompson, used during World War II. The Gusenberg Sweeper in-game is fitted with a drum magazine (that holds 30 rounds by default), which is also a common trope in mobster culture. The wooden handguard and stock are noticeably discolored due to wear and tear.\nEven though it is a submachine gun, it is classified as a &lt;a href=\"Light%20Machine%20Guns\"&gt;light machine gun&lt;/a&gt; and such, it is placed with the &lt;a href=\"MG\"&gt;MG&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Combat%20MG\"&gt;Combat MG&lt;/a&gt;, possibly due to its sheer size (much even larger than the &lt;a href=\"MP5\"&gt;SMG&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PlayStation 4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; versions, the Sweeper's firing and reload sound effects sound lower in pitch when using the first person camera mode.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe Gusenberg Sweeper's biggest advantages are its fire rate and damage per shot. It fires at 555 RPM, which is close to the fire rate of the &lt;a href=\"AP%20Pistol\"&gt;AP Pistol&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Combat%20MG\"&gt;Combat MG&lt;/a&gt;, and deals 34 damage per shot, being on par with &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Rifles\"&gt;assault rifles&lt;/a&gt;. It outclasses all other SMGs in damage per shot and fire rate. This puts the weapon in terms of damage-per-second among the best submachine guns to use.\nAccuracy is exceptional in short bursts, and the range is shorter, comparable to that of other SMGs. It has a larger spread than other submachine guns. This makes the Gusenberg Sweeper ineffective at long range, however, single shots or short bursts cut down on recoil and make it a very accurate weapon.\nA bizarre trait for the weapon is the ammo capacity. A stock magazine only holds 30 rounds, and it can be upgraded to 50 rounds. This capacity is mediocre for an LMG, and due to the high fire rate, it is not uncommon to be caught in reloads during a firefight.\nAnother downside of the weapon is the attachment selection. It can only mount the Extended Clip, unlike other SMGs/MGs. This means the player cannot upgrade its stats, limiting its effectiveness.\nCompared to other MGs, besides the ammo capacity, it has a better fire rate but lower damage than the standard &lt;a href=\"MG\"&gt;MG&lt;/a&gt;. The Combat MG completely outclasses it, having higher damage per shot, accuracy and ammo capacity.\nIn conclusion, the Gusenberg Sweeper should be treated as a submachine gun more than a light machine gun. It is ineffective at long range, and its low ammo capacity makes it impractical to use, but this can be disregarded if not fired fully automatic. However, at medium and close ranges, it is a very effective weapon, having a high damage per shot, akin to assault rifles, and a high fire rate.\nDespite being chambered in .45 ACP, it ejects bottlenecked rifle casings, most likely due to reused assets with other LMGs."}

A guy photographing a girl in the passenger seat of a tailing &lt;a href=\"Zorrusso\"&gt;Zorrusso&lt;/a&gt; can be seen leaning out of the Furia's passenger window.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Furia appears to be based primarily on the . The front intakes and side skirts have a strong resemblance to those from the . It also derives certain hints from the , such as the headlights and rear fascia. The headlights might've also been inspired by the . The rear diffuser seems to be taken from the . The car makes use of , which are a common sight on cars.\nThe car is distinctive by its rather large body and aerodynamic features around it, where the front end is largely dominated by a set of intakes on the centre and the outer sides, along with black details on the lower side and around the lower central intake. The upper area features a long light strip that spans the whole car's width and lights up when the engine is on, while the outer sides feature plastic housings containing three circular headlamps and outer vertical vents. On the bonnet area, there is the Grotti emblem on the front and an openable front trunk, with a plastic inset section near the windscreen and a vented section inside. A carbon-fibre strip can be also seen at the base of the windscreen, where the single wiper is located.\nOn the sides, the car features curved shapes around the rear area and is fitted with plastic skirts, along with lower intakes intended for the air to flow through the rear brakes and silver \"FURIA\" badges near the rear wheels. The doors slightly moves away of the car when opened and have carbon-fibre mirror shells with small fins on the inner sides, mounted over plastic supports near the A-pillars. The greenhouse area features plastic trim around the windows and a triangle-shaped rear section with a plastic detail on the end, having an openable glass pane on the centre and two intakes beside it, intended for the air to flow through the engine bay. The engine is placed between two carbon-fibre sections and bears the corresponding \"FURIA\" badges on the cam covers and the Grotti badge on the rearmost side of the centre. Like the &lt;a href=\"T20\"&gt;T20&lt;/a&gt;, the Furia features a mechanical spoiler that is typically hidden and blends into the rear end of the car, which will raise on high speeds and stay active until the car comes to a stop.\nThe rear of the car makes use of a single red light strip spanning the whole car's width, placed over a rear exit vent that bears a silver \"FURIA\" badge on the centre. Both the license plate and the small reverse lamp are seen on a flat central section, while the lower area is predominated by a plastic overhang that surrounds another exit vent, with the corresponding sections for the two small red lamps and the dual-exit exhaust tips. The underside of the car is fully carbon plated, surrounded by the aforementioned plastic details on the front and sides, together with a rear diffuser that is mostly finished in plastic.\nThe interior of the car is the same as in the &lt;a href=\"FMJ\"&gt;FMJ&lt;/a&gt;, though it uses the carbon paddle shifts from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Tempesta\"&gt;Tempesta&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Toros\"&gt;Toros&lt;/a&gt;. A Grotti badge can be seen in the horn cap, while a rectangular window can be also seen behind the seats, which allows the occupant/s to see the engine.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the body and part of the rear diffusser, while the secondary colour is applied on the cabin area, the details of the engine and the centre of the wheels. A trim colour is also available for the interior stitching. It uses a unique set of ten-spoke angled rims with a star-shaped centre. These rims can also support a dedicated colour, although only examples generated in &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; or the one appearing in the parking lot of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20%26amp%3B%20Resort\"&gt;Diamond Casino &amp; Resort&lt;/a&gt; may have one.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Furia is a good all-around car. Because of the car's drivetrain configuration, it therefore has excellent traction, coupled with good, albeit understeer-happy handling at high speeds. Acceleration is good due to the Furia being an all-wheel-drive vehicle, but has a very mediocre top speed. When fully upgraded, the Furia reaches a respectable 122mph (196.3km/h), but is still slower than many cars in its class.\nDespite being of a similar size and shape to most generic supercars, the Furia is surprisingly resistant; it is heavy enough to spin out most vehicles found in traffic, and its body is resistant to crashes and overturns, especially if upgraded with armour from &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Furia is powered by a V12 engine similar to the &lt;a href=\"Infernus%20Classic\"&gt;Infernus Classic&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Toros\"&gt;Toros&lt;/a&gt;, powering all four wheels through a 6-speed gearbox. Its engine sound appears to be a lower-pitched variation of the ones used in cars like the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah\"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable Owners.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\n&lt;a href=\"Yung%20Ancestor\"&gt;Yung Ancestor&lt;/a&gt; - can be found locked in the underground parking garage of &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20%26amp%3B%20Resort\"&gt;The Diamond Casino &amp; Resort&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Custom%20Vehicle%20License%20Plates\"&gt;custom licence plate&lt;/a&gt; reading \"ANCESTOR\". This instance flickered in and out of view but stopped doing so once the vehicle became available to purchase, and, unlike other vehicles in the parking lot, does not allow the player to even attempt to enter it (no \"locked door\" animation will play)."}

The car is very wide at the front and has curved profiles. The car may have a stripe on the middle.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", the Furore GT is based on the , most evident in its front bumper, grille, and overall body style.\u00a0The front fascia layout also resembles the . The headlights are directly taken from the , while the diffuser as well as the exhausts are taken from the .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Furore GT retains the general layout from its previous iteration, but assumes a more modern design. On the front, the car has a central carbon-fibre insert that is about half the car's width, while the area above is predominated by two small i takes and a large central grille, the latter being about two-thirds of the car's width and placed on a slightly higher height than the side intakes, also bearing the Lampadati logo on the centre. On the upper area, the car has black triangle-shaped housings on the outer edges, each one consisting of circular main units and vertical turn signals on the outer sides, while the bonnet has an elevated profile that is more prominent as it approaches to the base of the windscreen, along with a narrow impressed area on the centre.\nOn the sides, the car has distinctive formations that follow the shape of the doors and have exit vents on the front fenders, while the doors themselves have carbon-fibre mirror wings mounted near the cabin A-pillars of the vehicle. The rear fenders are more prominent than the rest of the bodywork and curves upwards from where the doors end, before becoming flat on top and slightly going down as they approach to the rear end. The cabin area is relatively simple, featuring black trimming around the windows and small rear-quarter windows, while the roof has an impressed area on the centre.\nThe rear of the car is defined by the curvature of the boot area that somewhat forms a lip spoiler and the inset curves on the outer sides, also featuring wide tail lamps on the upper sections and the cursive \"Lampadati\" badge on the centre. On the bumper area, the car bears the license plate on the centre and a carbon-fibre section at the bottom, with dual-exit, dual exhaust tubes housed on either side.\nThe interior of the car is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Comet\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt;, featuring the same dial set and interior details from the aforementioned car. However, the horn cap bears the corresponding Lampadati logo.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork and the interior stitching, while the secondary colour is applied on the portion surrounding the central grille intake, most of the bonnet, the cabin area and a portion of the rear bumper that separates it from the upper area. The car uses a set of wheels similar to the \"Sinthetic Z\" sport rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, but the detail in the centre is slightly larger. They also appear to apply a darker shade if a custom wheel colour is set (though it is only possible in &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; through the colour option). It also uses low-profile tyres, with the rear ones being wider than the front ones.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto 2\".\nThe Furore GT possesses good acceleration and brake strength, and excellent top speed. However, its noticeable drawback is its tendency to fishtail whenever it makes a turn. The car's durability is similar as other sports cars in general.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Furore GT is powered by a large engine which outputs a large amount of torque to the rear wheels through a 6-speed gearbox. Its acceleration is relatively average for a Sports car, falling into the middle of the pack. However, the top speed is very high, both for a Sports car and in general. Handling is lacking, while being responsive, it lacks the cornering radius and stability of other Sports cars in the corners, causing it to regularly spin out when attempting to carry too much speed. Crash deformation is meager, and will start smoking after just a few hits at reasonable speed. Brakes are acceptable but otherwise lacking. Overall, the Furore has power in a straight line, at the cost of being borderline for the class in everything else.\nThe engine model is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Exemplar\"&gt;Exemplar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20GT\"&gt;Rapid GT&lt;/a&gt;, and appears to be directly based on the real-life Ferrari DOHC engines, particularly the V8 models. It features red rocker covers and has large cold-air ram intake pipes coming from the front grille. Its engine sound is almost identical to that of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Monroe\"&gt;Monroe&lt;/a&gt;; being slightly lower in pitch and volume."}

Unlike the real Crossfire, there is no convertible variant of the Fusilade, suggesting that it is based on the SRT-6 model. It also influences the German styling of the , as seen in the roof line and rear shape.

The front end features a rectangular chrome grille with three horizontal bars and a \"V6\" badge, along with twin circular headlights located in chrome housings. The hood features various lines above and bears the manufacturer's emblem on the front.\nThe sides denote its sportier design, featuring vertical vents on the front fenders with a chrome separation running towards the doors, and small \"V6 3.0i\" badges embossed above the separation. The skirts have a slightly concave shape and ends slightly upwards, adopting a fin-like appearance. The greenhouse area features black trim around the windows and two painted mirror shells can be seen on either side.\nThe rear end is distinctive by the curved portion on the trunk assimilating a ducktail spoiler, also featuring a thin brake light. The corresponding badges can be seen above the license plate and the lower corners of the trunk. The outer edges have rounded tail lights, with the middle ones being the turn signals and the reverse lights. The rear bumper slightly protrudes from the rest of the car's rear, having a moulding on the center for the twin exhaust pipes.\nThe car is only painted with a single color, which also affects the stitching on the interior. The rim design is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Feltzer\"&gt;Feltzer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, being identical to the \"Organic Type D\" sport wheels available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe car is capable of providing excellent acceleration and a decent top speed. Its light weight and good weight distribution makes it very nimble, allowing it to be able to carve into corners at high speeds with minimal oversteer. However, durability could be better, as the vehicle can withstand only a few frontal hits before its engine fails. Its front wheels are prone to getting bent and locked after hard landings and frontal crashes.\nThe engine model appears to be a double overhead camshaft inline-4, although the badges suggests a different one (a 3.0 liter fuel injected V6). The engine cover contradicts the model underneath, wherein the cover appears to be loosely based on that of a typical V8 engine cover, taking into consideration the valve cover bolts and spark-plug inlet impressions.\nThe Fusilade is one of the best vehicle choices for players who do not want to spend money on purchasing cars from the in-game Internet, but still want a well-performing car. If the player wishes to carry more than one passenger however, the &lt;a href=\"Oracle\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Felon\"&gt;Felon&lt;/a&gt; are other good choices in the same respects."}

The dashboard distinctively uses white dial markings, with the speedometer having a smaller orange scale.\nThe car spawns in a large variety of colors, with the primary one applied on the upper side and the secondary one on the lower side. An additional color is applied on the rims, which alternate between white (the most common color), black and gold (the rarest ones). It uses a set of eight-spoke rims wrapped in medium-profile tires. Being possibly tuned for asphalt racing and drifting, these tires are similar to those found on much higher end cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel \"XS\"&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Super%20GT\"&gt;Super GT&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Futo returns to \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" with the same design as before, although it may spawn with a black lip spoiler on the trunk. In the enhanced version, it sports a high-quality interior based on the one seen in \"GTA IV\", clearly denoting its influence from the Corolla Levin AE86.\nColor distribution is similar to the \"GTA IV\" iteration, where the primary one is applied on the upper side and the stitches of the steering wheel, while the secondary one is applied on the lower side. Its wheels are the same as in \"GTA IV\", and can be also found in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; in the \"Tuners\" category, under the name \"Fujiwara\".\nThe Futo was later changed in the update, where the decals on the lower sides and the emblem on the hood were removed. This was done so the decals would not conflict with the new liveries, although the liveries are only available for \"GTA Online\". The original decal set can be found under the Classic Decals livery in mod shops.\nCurrent Design Gallery.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nCurrent Version=\nPrevious Version=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Futo is quite a good performer for a car of this stature, as its top speed is astonishing and acceleration is phenomenal. The chassis is rigid and taut, giving the Futo stability at high speeds. The suspension is firm but not too much, keeping the Futo flat in banked corners and stable in the S-curves, while still giving a stiff, yet enjoyable ride. Couple the excellent suspension setup with the short wheelbase and one get a fantastically chuckable little pocket rocket, capable of competing with full-on sports cars. The brakes are sensitive and effective, and front-wheel lock-up is not a big issue compared to other vehicles. Braking can be extremely dangerous in the rain. The Futo handles well off-road and can reach about 75% of its top speed on dirt roads and beaches, and grip is impressive even with rear wheel drive, while others of the same drive may fishtail easily. Crash deformation is above average, though build quality is sub-par, often leaving the Futo disabled after just a few accidents.\nAll in all, the Futo is great fun to drive, and makes an excellent escape or pursuit vehicle in missions. It is also an ideal car to drift since it is a lightweight, front engine, rear-wheel-drive car. The only possible disadvantages during a pursuit or escape is that the vehicle is small, lacking the power to ram or hit other vehicles out of the way, and the fact that it only has space for two occupants.\nThe Futo is powered by an inline-4 engine with four throttle bodies, coupled to a 5-speed manual gearbox and a rear-wheel-drive configuration. The markings on the sides indicate it has a naturally-aspirated 20-valve (16 valves, plus the four individual throttle bodies) engine with high-performance injection, a rear-wheel-drive configuration with limited slip differential. It uses a high-revving and rather smooth sound that is also shared with the &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Compact\"&gt;Blista Compact&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hakumai\"&gt;Hakumai&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Futo seems to be improved with higher top speed and acceleration, yet it retains most of the qualities seen in the \"GTA IV\" version. However, its improvements have not been sufficient enough to compete with most sports cars in the game, as their top speeds and accelerations have been raised further. It is utterly outclassed by supercars in terms of speed. However, the Futo is still an excellent choice to go around and as a getaway vehicle. The Futo's mass has been drastically decreased as well, giving it poor ramming power. Despite this dismal outlook for the Futo, its retained stats from \"GTA IV\" have still left it with incredible potential, and a skilled driver can make the Futo as capable as any other sports car with a higher price tag. On racetracks, it is more useful on courses with more turns than straights, as the Futo has more responsive braking compared to other sports cars, and its speed is not enough to pull itself to the lead on straights. Wet conditions, however, seem to impact the Futo heavily, as the rear end is prone to swinging outwards in such conditions. Regardless, it is still a small, potent and fun-to-drive sports car.\nAgain, the Futo is powered by the same 4-cylinder engine bearing four throttle bodies. The badging still indicate that it bears a 20-valve (16 valves, plus the four individual throttle bodies) Inline-4 engine with high-performance injection, with rear wheel drive and a limited slip differential. The engine sound is high-revving and rather loud, although still smoother compared to most cars of its class.\nAfter update for the enhanced version, applying each of the suspension modifications will incrementally apply small amounts of negative camber to the wheels in both \"GTA Online\" and \"GTA V\".\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nLivery modifications were added for the Futo in the update for \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", which are not available in \"GTA V\"."}

The interior is also retained from the original model, also having the \"FUTO GT\" doorcards and the vehicle's name on the tachometer.\nSimilar to the regular version, the primary color of the car is applied on the upper side and the stitches of the steering wheel, while the secondary one is applied on the lower side. A trim color option is also available for the doorcards and inner portions of the seats, as well as a dial color that also affects some of the custom exhaust options. It shares the same wheel design as the original model, being a derivative of the \"Fujiwara\" tuner rims seen in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, fitted with medium-profile tires.

The engine sound is high-revving and loud, more so than the one from the original Futo.\nThe Futo GTX has good speed and acceleration, but its strong suit is being able to drift around corners with ease. Like its original counterpart, however, it has weak resistance against hard collisions, and its wheels can bend from repeated collisions, which can greatly affect its handling. Competition-wise, it doesn't fare well in races due to its tendency in wanting to drift upon turning and is easily outclassed by vehicles with more grip, and its body roll is also noticeable when turning hard."}

Some details, like the overrides on the lower bumper and the three frames on the top part of the rear cage structure, are omitted from this model, with the latter likely intended to make way for the \"Spare Wheel\" modifications.\nThe primary colour of the vehicle is applied on the bodywork, extra bumpers, side steps, fuel/oil tanks and rims, while the secondary colour is applied on the details of the upper bumper, the bumpers of the bodywork, the details of the vehicle's bodywork, the exhaust stacks, the rear cage and the outer details of the rims. An accent colour is also available for the details found on the side steps and the inner details of the rims. The vehicle uses a unique set of concave rims with five details around the centre, wrapped in high-profile tyres. When switching to custom rims, it is revealed that the wheel colour is set to yellow upon conversion.\nThe vehicle can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with two side-mounted guns on the fenders, being either machine guns resembling or short-barreled machine guns, or futuristic plasma/laser guns.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nFor a large six-wheeled vehicle, the Bruiser handles remarkably well. Its acceleration is above average and easily outclasses other vehicles of its size such as the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Barracks\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt;. Top speed is acceptable, at around 100 miles per hour before redlining. Braking, however, leaves much to be desired, as it is slow to come to a complete stop but is manageable if caution is used.\nDue to the vehicle's incredibly long wheelbase, it struggles a bit when navigating streets or the arena and tends to suffer from understeer and when accelerating, fishtailing. Furthermore, it can be pushed off quite easily by other, heavier vehicles, often resulting it in being rolled over, in addition to driving through steep slopes that can also result in it rolling over.\nDespite the Bruiser having a front differential and a transfer case visible, it does not have AWD characteristics. This makes it very tough to climb steep hills. Even on flat rough terrain, it struggles to sort small obstacles like barriers or rocks, due to its front bumper having extremely low clearance. The rear end, on the other part, has no obstruction, allowing to sort these obstacles easily.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Glendale%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Glendale&lt;/a&gt; and the other Bruisers, the vehicle is powered by the same engine fitted to the &lt;a href=\"Regina\"&gt;Regina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt;, being a single-overhead camshaft V8 fitted with a cylindrical air filter. Said engine is coupled to a 5-speed gearbox and powers the four rear wheels. Its sound is also smoother and mid-revving, similar to the one used on vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Ramp%20Buggy\"&gt;Ramp Buggy&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dune%20FAV\"&gt;Dune FAV&lt;/a&gt;.\nIts traction can be slightly increased with any \"Spoiler\" modification, even though they are not technically spoilers.\nArmor.\nThe Bruiser excels in an enforcer. Due to its large size and optional ram modification, it is capable of pushing all but the largest vehicles out of its way with no effort. Only large vehicles like &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Utility%20Truck\"&gt;Utility Truck&lt;/a&gt;s will not be pushed out of the way and will slow the Bruiser down. Furthermore, owing to its large, exposed wheels, they are vulnerable to gunfire or being pierced by spike strips if not fitted with bulletproof tires; the tires can cause the wheels to camber if burst, which greatly affects its handling.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nDual .50 Cal=\nDual Lasers=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Future Shock Bruiser can be modified at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beeker%27s%20Garage\"&gt;Beeker's Garage&lt;/a&gt;, although special upgrades are only available at the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Workshop\"&gt;Arena Workshop&lt;/a&gt;."}

Unlike the &lt;a href=\"Apocalypse%20Impaler\"&gt;Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Impaler\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; equivalents, the vehicle retains all of the features from the regular Impaler, although the cabin only adds protective bars on the windshield and the rear window. Unique to this vehicle, the car has Declasse logos on the front and rear ends and the Declasse lettering use a different font, all of them with a gold texture.\nThe primary color of the vehicle is applied on the bodywork and the interior stitching, while the secondary one is applied on the bumpers, the details on the front and rear ends, the surrounding of the hood intakes, the details on the sides, the handles, the mirrors, the window trims and the fuel tank. An accent color is also available for the outer surroundings of the outer lights, the details on the hood, the upper details of the side windows, the upper and lower lines of the rear end and the central details of the rims. It uses concave rims with five spiked bolt details around the center, which are wrapped in medium-profile tires, having slightly wider track than the stock wheels of the regular Impaler. These rims can also support a dedicated color, which is set to yellow upon conversion.\nThe vehicle can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with two top-mounted guns on the hood, being either machine guns resembling or futuristic plasma/laser guns.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nAlthough appearing to be similar to the regular Impaler, its performance is more or less identical to the &lt;a href=\"Apocalypse%20Impaler\"&gt;Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Impaler\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; variants, having an increased top speed and acceleration due to the weight reduction, and it also has slightly improved braking. However, it still suffers from losing control when steering too sharply, a flaw that is carried from the standard Impaler.\nLike its stock counterpart, the vehicle is powered by a single-cam V8 engine, this time coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. It retains the same engine sound from the regular Impaler, which is derived from the &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor.\nThe Impaler, like most Arena vehicles, has decent resistance, able to take a single explosive without being destroyed. However, the protective bars on the windows do not offer actual protection to the occupants, rendering them vulnerable to gunfire. This issue can be mitigated with the Heavy Armor upgrade, as it adds an armor plate on the windshield with smaller open spots, and armor plates on the rear-quarter and rear windows that give higher protection against enemy pursuers (though not that much compared to the Apocalypse and the Nightmare variants). The rear wheels are also protected with small plates, but the front ones are still exposed to get punctured by gunfire, unless the \"Bulletproof Tires\" upgrade is installed.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nDual .50 Cal=\nDual Lasers=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Future Shock Impaler can be modified at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, although special upgrades are only available at the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Workshop\"&gt;Arena Workshop&lt;/a&gt;."}

Most of the vehicle's components can support different colour combinations, while the black rear louvres were replaced by paintable ones.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork and the engine cam covers, while the secondary one is applied on the bottom extender, the front bumper, the surrounding of the headlamp housings, the engine scoop/intake, the linear details on the sides, the wheel arches, the trimmings around the cabin area, the mirrors, the door handles, the rear louvres, the lip spoiler, the rear bumper, the exhaust tips and the interior stitching. An accent colour is also available for the details found on the rims. It uses a unique set of plain rims with various linear details around, wrapped with what appear to be s. These rims can also support a dedicated colour, which is set to yellow on purchased examples.\nThe vehicle can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with two top-mounted guns on the bonnet, being either machine guns resembling or short-barreled machine guns, or futuristic plasma/laser guns. It can be also equipped with two rear-facing mortar cannons on the boot that are identical to the ones available on the &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Tampa\"&gt;Weaponized Tampa&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nVehicle.\nThe Imperator possesses excellent acceleration and decent speed thanks to its single-cam V8 engine, but has relatively low braking capabilities. The vehicle also has a tendency to slide out when turning at certain speeds and can spin out if the driver is not careful, most of these shortfalls can be mitigated by upgrading the brakes at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and through skillful driving. Also despite the high acceleration, the vehicle's rear wheels spin before the vehicle can take off due to the high torque, unless the player slightly presses the accelerator button.\nDuring certain events in the &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank%20Arena\"&gt;Maze Bank Arena&lt;/a&gt;, the vehicle stats change. In race events such as \"Wreck It\", the acceleration is high, while the braking is low and the vehicle's habit of spinning out is also increased, but in the events such as \"Bomb Ball\", the acceleration is greatly decreased while the braking becomes more effective. However, this doesn't seem to be the case for custom variations of the vehicle, as the stats will be the same as they are in free mode.\nThe vehicle is powered by a single-cam V8 engine that can be modified with a supercharger/bug catcher, coupled to a 4-speed gearbox in a front engine, rear wheel drive layout. The same engine has fully-animated timing belt and pulleys, and appears to use an edited variation of the engine sound from cars like the &lt;a href=\"Drift%20Tampa\"&gt;Drift Tampa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hotring%20Sabre\"&gt;Hotring Sabre&lt;/a&gt;, with a supercharged sound effect also used on the &lt;a href=\"Tampa\"&gt;Tampa&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Tampa\"&gt;Weaponized variant&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor.\nLike other similar Arena vehicles, the occupants are vulnerable to gunfire due to the exposed cabin. However, this issue can be reduced with the Heavy Armor upgrade installed, as it adds armour plating around the vehicle, having the windshield partially protected by metal bars and the sides with window plating with a small weak spot. The rear remains unarmoured in that aspect, due to the rear louvres on it. Depending on the armour level, it can take at least three missiles from an &lt;a href=\"Oppressor\"&gt;Oppressor&lt;/a&gt; before being destroyed by a fourth, making it one of the more decent weaponized vehicles due to its balance between weapons, abilities and durability.\nUnlike its other versions, any armour upgrade adds wide coverings that protect the wheels, effectively reducing chances of puncturing wheels by gunfire and giving the car a wider profile. Bulletproof Tires are still recommended, though, as it sorts &lt;a href=\"Spike%20Strip\"&gt;Spike Strip&lt;/a&gt;s and enemy Spike mines.\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nDual .50 Cal=\nDual Lasers=\nKinetic Mortar=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Future Shock Imperator can be modified at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; and other mod shops, although special upgrades are only available at the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Workshop\"&gt;Arena Workshop&lt;/a&gt;."}

The headlamps are a bit smaller compared to the Issi Classic and the other Arena variants, while the exhaust tubes on the front left fender are slightly enlarged and angled to the rear. The rear axle beam appears to have a carbon-fibre appearance.\nThe primary colour of the vehicle is applied on the bodywork, the bumpers, the boot detail above the license plate, the engine guard plate, the base structure of the cage, part of the rear axle, the interior floor, the centre and the stitches of the steering wheel, the wheel hubs and the rims, while the secondary one is applied on the details of the lamps, front and rear ends, window trims, engine cover, exhaust details, protective cage, the lower front guard plate, part of the suspension links, the surroundings of the dials, the surroundings of the circular vents and the outlines of the centre of the steering wheel.

However, it has a higher top speed and higher suspension, but the increased weight means it has a rather lower acceleration. The high suspension allows the car to sort out obstacles better than the stock version, but because of the RWD layout, it struggles to climb steep hills in comparison to dedicated off-road vehicles.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Arena%20War\"&gt;Arena War&lt;/a&gt; modes, the Issi is generally inferior to most Arena contenders due to its size, being easily pushed away by heavier vehicles. However, it works better on modes such as &lt;a href=\"Flag%20War\"&gt;Flag War&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Games%20Masters\"&gt;Games Masters&lt;/a&gt;, as it can squeeze through narrow areas where most cars cannot. While not as nimble and agile as the &lt;a href=\"Deathbike\"&gt;Deathbike&lt;/a&gt;s, it can still offer protection to the driver against collisions and kinetic mines. It is also a mandatory vehicle in &lt;a href=\"Here%20Come%20The%20Monsters\"&gt;Here Come The Monsters&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike the Issi Classic, the vehicle is powered by a very high-revving single-cam, transversely laid inline-4 with a mounted air filter and functioning timing belt. It has a 4-speed gearbox, an FR layout and the same engine sound used on the regular version and the &lt;a href=\"Cheburek\"&gt;Cheburek&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmour.\nLike various Arena vehicles, it can withstand a single explosive without being destroyed, though its size may cause the vehicle to get easily flipped by the knockback. It can be also upgraded with armour upgrades to partially protect the occupants with metal bars and window plates, but the side windows remain with no protection at all.

The lower front section has an interlinked barrier partially replacing the front grille and the headlights have a futuristic look, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Future%20Shock%20Deathbike\"&gt;Future Shock Deathbike&lt;/a&gt;, while the hood has linear details passing through it. The fenders and the surroundings of the windows also have linear details, while the original dual exhaust stacks have been replaced with quad exhaust stacks, acquiring a trumpet-like design as well.\nThe primary color of the vehicle is applied on the bodywork, the stitches of the steering wheel, the center of the wheels and the ring-like details on the inner sections of the tires, while the secondary one is applied on the tube-frame chassis, the roll bars, the details around the body, the exhaust stacks, the driveshaft loops, the surroundings of the center of the wheel and the support frames. An accent color is also available for the surroundings of the headlights, the details beside the hood compartment, the details of the center of the wheels and the detail passing around the tires. The wheels have a low-profile design with a rugged pattern and connected to the center by four curved frames, giving the impression of s. When switching to custom rims, it is revealed that the wheel color is set to yellow upon conversion.\nThe vehicle can be &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with two side-mounted grenade launchers on the hood, appearing to use the receiver of a , but altered with larger barrels.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Sasquatch performs very similar to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Liberator\"&gt;Liberator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marshall\"&gt;Marshall&lt;/a&gt;, but has a higher top speed and better acceleration, taking only a few seconds to reach 60 miles per hour. Braking is also very good for a vehicle of this size, only taking a few seconds to come to a complete stop. However, the relatively light mass makes it unable to push other vehicles out of the way without slowing down like the &lt;a href=\"Bruiser\"&gt;Bruiser&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cerberus\"&gt;Cerberus&lt;/a&gt;, and attempting to run over smaller vehicles at higher speeds will often launch itself up in the air and topple over haphazardly and juggle around, which can make recovery a challenge. Installing a ram weapon may reduce chances of rollovers, but may affect the way it handles bumpy roads and obstacles on the front.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Arena%20War\"&gt;Arena War&lt;/a&gt; modes, the Sasquatch can be an easy target due to its large size, and the slow speed and handling may render it easily outmaneuvered by vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"ZR380\"&gt;ZR380&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Deathbike\"&gt;Deathbike&lt;/a&gt;. However, it can be a serious threat due to its large wheels; any smaller vehicle stuck between the two wheels of a side may be either instantly destroyed or severely damaged, being an ideal choice for modes such as &lt;a href=\"Carnage\"&gt;Carnage&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Tag%20Team\"&gt;Tag Team&lt;/a&gt;, but caution should be taken for any &lt;a href=\"Drones\"&gt;drone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"RC%20Bandito\"&gt;RC Bandito&lt;/a&gt; or guided missile used by spectators.\nLike the Liberator and the Marshall, the Sasquatch uses a high-power V8 engine, coupled to a 3-speed gearbox in a mid-engine, all wheel drive layout. It also shares the same loud engine sound from the aforementioned monster trucks.\nLike other Arena vehicles, it can withstand a single explosive without being destroyed. However, the cabin leaves no protection for the occupants and the engine is partially exposed on the rear, rendering them vulnerable to gunfire. This issue can be mitigated with the addition of armor upgrades, as it installs a grilled defense for the windows and large metal plates behind the cabin and over the engine bay. The side windows, however, leave no protection at all.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Future Shock Sasquatch can only be modified at the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Workshop\"&gt;Arena Workshop&lt;/a&gt;."}

The top frame of the front bumper is finished in carbon fiber and most of the vehicle's details are painted, such as the side vents and the panels between the body frames. The rusty bed floor from the Apocalypse variant is replaced by a clean one with an hexagonal pattern on it, while the rear wall has a carbon-fiber finish.

The vehicle can push away vehicles with ease and is difficult to be pushed by other light cars, making it an excellent choice for transportation around the map.\nThe vehicle is powered by a diesel engine located around the middle section, given the location of the vents. It shares the same engine sound with vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Custom\"&gt;Phantom Custom&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hauler%20Custom\"&gt;Hauler Custom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Chernobog\"&gt;Chernobog&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor.\nCompared to other Arena vehicles, the Scarab excels in armor resistance, able to take up to six rockets before being destroyed. However, its windshield is pretty large, leaving the front occupants vulnerable to gunfire, with little to no protection for the rear passengers. The Full Armor plate solves the issue with the front occupants, which leaves a smaller weak spot on the windshield.

However, the player may experience fishtailing upon initial acceleration due to the high amount of engine power delivered to the rear wheels, and some degree of understeer at high speeds. The unequal weight distribution, short wheelbase and wide rear axle means it can easily lose control if the vehicle hits an obstacle. Because of this, the Slamvan can be very difficult to use in &lt;a href=\"Arena%20War\"&gt;Arena War&lt;/a&gt; modes due to the narrow spaces and short roads of the arena maps.\nThe vehicle is powered by a big-block V8 engine similar to vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Fr%C3%A4nken%20Stange\"&gt;Fr\u00e4nken Stange&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tornado%20Rat%20Rod\"&gt;Tornado Rat Rod&lt;/a&gt;, coupled to a 4-speed gearbox in a rear-mid engine, rear wheel drive layout.

It also takes elements from the , most notably the headlights and grille.\nDepicted as a small rally-oriented sports car, the GB200 is easily distinguished by its lightweight and aerodynamic bodywork. The front bumper of the car has a plastic extender at the bottom that spans the entire car's width, a rectangular mesh intake with a license plate over it and two sections holding circular fog lights. The upper area has a thin meshed grille that has the same width as the bumper intake and bears the Vapid logo on the center, while the outer edges have the main circular headlights. The hood area has a curved profile and has two protruding sections for the headlights and two small intakes around the center, which hinges from the front and opens to reveal a storage for a spare wheel, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Monroe\"&gt;Monroe&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tropos%20Rallye\"&gt;Tropos Rallye&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the sides, the car makes use of flared fender arches, whose upper halves are part of the front spare wheel compartment and the rear engine compartment. Large skirts can be seen on the lower sides, which are defined by the seams that are aligned with the lower door line. The lower halves of the rear fenders have small intakes intended to cool off the rear brakes, while the colored ridges define the separation between the main body and the front/rear compartments. The cabin area features black trim around the windows, colored mirror shells and a wide roof scoop.\nThe rear section mainly consist of large intakes behind the cabin intended to direct airflow to the engine bay, an elevated section forming a ducktail spoiler at the end and a rear window exposing the roll cage and engine bay. The rear end has a black panel housing the license plate on the center and the reactangular tail lights on either side, along with the Vapid emblem and the \"GB200\" badhing on the passenger side. The lower area is mainly predominated by the twin exit vents and the two-element plastic diffuser at the bottom. This entire section also serves as a rear clam for the engine, which hinges from behind the cabin and opens to reveal two red air filters on either side, a turbocharger on the driver side and the hoses connected to the radiator on the roof. Part of the exhaust pipe is also seen behind the turbocharger, going towards the bottom of the engine bay.\nThe underside of the car is mostly traditional in design. However, it reveals the complex suspension setup, featuring articulated arms on the front and axke shafts with parallel trailing arms on the rear, in a similar manner to the &lt;a href=\"Omnis\"&gt;Omnis&lt;/a&gt;. The exhaust pipe exits from the driver side and leads towards the rear end, just below the diffuser.\nThe interior of the car reuses elements from the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Classic\"&gt;Sentinel Classic&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Deluxo\"&gt;Deluxo&lt;/a&gt;, being the dials marked over green grid patterns, the rectangular aircon units and the gear stick. However, it uses race-style steering wheel and seats.\nThe primary color of the car is applied on the bodywork, the mirror shells and the rear cage, while the secondary color is applied on the ridged details on the sides, the cam covers, the exhaust pipe beside the engine bay and the interior stitching. A trim color is also available for the interior, being applied on the dashboard, central section and seats. It uses a set of 12-spoke dual rims with bolt details on the outer surrounding, which can also support a dedicated color (although only examples generated in &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; may have a gold color).\nThe fog lights are not functional, but the rally lamps are. They are enabled alongside high beams, and are extremely bright.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe GB200 shows excellent traction both on and off-road, along with very good braking, agile handling and very good acceleration. However, being mid-engined, it suffers from lift-off oversteer (more commonly known as snap-oversteer), meaning the rear of the car will easily lose traction when the driver lifts off the throttle during cornering. Additionally, due to the high engine resistance, the GB200 suffers from a relatively low top speed compared to other cars in its class.\nOn loose gravel and dirt trails, however, the GB200 is incredibly stable and composed, aided in part by its relatively smooth power delivery. The car exhibits very good grip, but has a slight tendency to understeer, most likely due to the even front/ rear torque distribution and relatively light front end of the car. The car does have a relatively low centre of mass and is therefore less susceptible to tipping onto two wheels and eventually rolling over when attacking banks off-road.\nThe GB200 is powered by a single-cam turbocharged V6, connected to a 6-speed gearbox in a mid engine, all wheel drive layout (with equal torque distribution). The vehicle features animated pulleys, which rotate at various speeds under throttle, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Tornado%20Rat%20Rod\"&gt;Tornado Rat Rod&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Wedge\"&gt;Phantom Wedge&lt;/a&gt;. Its engine sound appears to be a higher-pitched variation of the one from the &lt;a href=\"Elegy%20Retro%20Custom\"&gt;Elegy Retro Custom&lt;/a&gt;."}

The missions, which are given by &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Cortez\"&gt;Colonel Juan Garcia Cortez&lt;/a&gt;, relate to Cortez's conflict with French authorities over the illegal purchase of chips (which are properties of the French government presumably to be used for military equipment). The situation escalates to the point when Cortez is forced to flee &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vice City&lt;/a&gt; to an unknown country.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Mall%20Shootout\"&gt;Mall Shootout&lt;/a&gt;, GIGN units intervene in a deal between &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20La%20Ponce\"&gt;Pierre La Ponce&lt;/a&gt;, forcing the dealers to flee from a hail of gunfire from the GIGN.

The front bumper seems to be inspired by the , while the diffuser and the exhaust seem to be taken from the . The rear fascia might have been inspired by the . The dash cluster and white dials are also based on the F1, although the GP1 does not feature a central driving position. \nSome of the modifications were taken from the or the , both motorsport variants of the F1. The GP1 can be considered a production version of the &lt;a href=\"Tyrus\"&gt;Tyrus&lt;/a&gt;, since the is a derivative of the original McLaren F1, although the GP1 features a fully redesigned car model, not sharing any components with the Tyrus's body.\nDesign.\nThe GP1 features a small bumper with a large intake on the centre and two smaller ones beside it, followed by a wedge-shaped upper area that houses the headlamps and the vented bonnet. The headlamps themselves are located in black housings with glass casings and plastic trim, each one consisting of twin circular main lamps, a smaller white light on the outer side and a small turn signal just above it. A modern Progen logo is featured on the front.\nAlong the side profiling, the vehicle sports heavy strakes embedded into the door panels, along with small intakes leading to the rear brakes. The cabin area makes use of plastic trimmings around the windows, a single windscreen wiper, body-coloured mirror shells and upper door handles. Like the Tyrus, the vehicle features butterfly doors, as seen by the roof hinge, while the central area is occupied by a roof scoop. The rear area is occupied by an engine compartment with a central vented cover, which hinges from the front and revealing to have inner windows separating the interior from the engine bay.\nThe rear of the car consists of a vented panel presumably for the gearbox/diff, while a rectangular section can be seen next to it. The rear end features dual circular tail lamps with smaller units within them, a rectangular black vent holding the license plate, a rounded open vent below it and vertical vents below the tail lamps. The lower area is occupied by the twin exhausts on the outer edges and the carbon-fibre diffusers on the centre. The classic Progen logo and the GP1\u2019s badging is featured on the rear, both of which are also featured on the engine.\nThe GP1\u2019s interior is unique, featuring a combination of leather finish with carbon-fibre details. The dial cluster uses unique dials and gauges with a white base colour, with the gauges on the left side and the main ones on the centre and the right side, together with the warning lights. The console next to the dial cluster features various switches for the basic vehicle functions, while the steering wheel uses a carbon-fibre steering column and a bolted-on, carbon-fibre circular panel with the Progen logo on it. The central column between the seats have carbon-fibre sections with a dedicated space for the gearbox and the additional switches. The doors have a carbon-fibre detail with speakers on them, while the seats have a unique curved design, bearing the Progen logo on the outer sides.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the body, while the secondary colour is applied on the panels above the headlamps, a detail above each headlamp set, the trimmings of the mirror shells, the details of the key holes and a rear frame on the engine bay. A trim colour is also available for the interior stitching, lower half of dashboard, part of the doors, the details on the central column, the borders of the seat emblems and the seat belts. The stock rims are of a unique design, consisting of six spokes with rounded spaces and the GP1 badge on the centre. The details inside the grooves and the central bolt support an additional wheel colour, although only examples spawned in the &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt; have coloured rims.\nThough the GP1 does not come with a spoiler as stock, one can be added at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; that resembles the McLaren F1's stock active spoiler; however, the spoiler is shown in the &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Motorsport\"&gt;Legendary Motorsport&lt;/a&gt; gallery.\nPerformance.\nBeing a production version of the Tyrus, the vehicle shares many aspects, including the overall handling. The vehicle possesses quick acceleration thanks to the powerful engine; however, its mediocre top speed of 114 mph means it'll be beaten by most supercars, and even some sports cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Schlagen%20GT\"&gt;Schlagen GT&lt;/a&gt;, down a straight.\nThe GP1 suffers from considerable amounts of understeer, but has a quick steering response and is extremely stable, as it rarely spins out even when taking corners at high speed. Unlike most cars, custom spoilers do not increase the GP1's downforce.\nOverall, the GP1's low top speed compared to other supercars and heavy understeer make it unsuitable for racing. However, its stability still makes it a decent vehicle to drive around the streets.\nThe GP1 is powered by a V12 engine, supported by the intake manifolds having six inlets per row, coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a rear-mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. The engine sound is shared with the Tyrus, albeit with an edited tone."}

The front end of the car is slanted in shape and features a small bumper with a chrome finish. Above the same bumper, there is a dual meshed grille spanning about two-thirds of the car's width, which bears a chrome finish on the surroundings and the central divider, while the outer edges house circular lamps with chrome detail around the units, with the upper ones being larger and placed above the smaller lamps. The bonnet area is relatively curved around the front and has a central long intake on the engine compartment, as well as the Grotti emblem ahead of the same.\nThe sides of the car are relatively simple, featuring a set of amber indicators near the front quarters and small vents between the front wheel arches and the doors, fitted with dual horizontal separations finished in chrome. The doors have horizontal door handles and classic circular rear-view mirrors, both of them also finished in chrome. The greenhouse area assumes a tall design with a sloped rear, featuring chrome trim around the windows, leaving thin coloured portions on the A-pillars.\nOn the rear end, the boot lid houses a dedicated section for the license plate, as well as silver \"GROTTI\" lettering above. The outer edges house circular tail lamps with chrome detail around the units, which consist of small amber indicators located within the red main/brake lamps. A small bumper with a chrome finish protects the rear end and the rear quarters of the vehicle, while dual-exit, dual chrome exhaust tips are seen below the car's body.\nThe vehicle features a classic wooden interior similar to the Stinger.

The Grotti emblem can be seen on the centre of the steering wheel.\nThe vehicle only has access to a primary colour, which is applied on the bodywork, the uncovered sections of the dashboard and the steering column.

{"id": "4440", "revid": "27660974", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4440", "title": "GTA Clone", "text": "A Grand Theft Auto\" clone, also known as a GTA\" clone, is a term used by gamers and video game critics for a game that emulates, or has gameplay elements similar to the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" series, following the success of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" in 2001.\nDescription.\nSpecifically, a \"GTA\" clone is typically an action crime-drama open-world video game that usually contains driving and shooting mechanics, with a non-linear set of storyline missions and a great number of side-missions and activities displayed on a &lt;a href=\"Heads%20Up%20Display\"&gt;mini-map&lt;/a&gt; for the player. \n\"**\" Some critics have extended the \"GTA\" Clone label to the , despite that series starting in 1999, two years before the release of \"Grand Theft Auto III\". While \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\" used a top-down perspective, \"Driver\" started as a 3D series. But since technology advances, \"GTA III\" could have been released as a 3D game without the influence of the \"Driver\" series.\nThe term has also been applied to games that, although they do not involve violence or wielding &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s, still have elements similar or otherwise lifted from the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt;, such as ' (2002), ' (2003), ' (2003), ' (2004), ' (2005) (which one of the reviews even called \"\"GTA\" for girls\", and, coincidentally, uses the same &lt;a href=\"RenderWare\"&gt;RenderWare&lt;/a&gt; engine as the 3D Universe), ' (2006) and \"\" (2006) (which is sometimes referred to as \"Grand Theft Shark\").\nOrigins.\nOpen-world, 3D action-adventure games existed as a predominantly European genre for many years prior to the release of any similar game from &lt;a href=\"DMA%20Design\"&gt;DMA Design&lt;/a&gt;. \"Mercenary\" (1985) featured an open-world, non-linear quest in which the player could steal vehicles, shoot, and explore freely, including conflicts with the authorities. \"The Terminator\", released in 1990, was a free-form, open-world game that set its action in a modern-day city that extended for miles, and included the ability to fire at civilians and steal cars. This game was also notable for being among the first American-developed games to feature these elements. \"Hunter\" continued the evolution into something more closely resembling the \"GTA\" series, with full 3D, third-person graphics and the ability to steal many different vehicle types.\nDMA Design began pursuing open-world game design with the first \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20%281997%20game%29\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\", which allowed players to commandeer various automobiles and shoot various weapons within a mission-based structure. Unlike later games in the series, and indeed many earlier influences, the first two \"GTA\" games were 2D. In 1998, DMA moved many of these design concepts into a 3D world with '. \"Grand Theft Auto III\" took the gameplay foundation of the first two \"Grand Theft Auto\" games and expanded it into a 3D world, and offered an unprecedented variety of minigames and side-missions. The title was a much greater commercial success than its direct precursors, and its influence was profound. As such, \"Grand Theft Auto III\" is credited with popularizing this genre, let alone inventing it. Its release is sometimes treated as a revolutionary event in the history of video games, much like the release of ' nearly a decade earlier. GamePro called it the most important game of all time, and claimed that every genre was influenced to rethink their conventional level design.\nDefinition.\nCalling a game a \"\"Grand Theft Auto\" clone\" is sometimes considered unfair or insulting. This is because reviewers sometimes use this term to suggest that the \"clone\" is a mere imitation, designed for the sole purpose of capitalizing on the success of the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series. However, this term can also be used as a neutral description of a game, which can range from good to bad. Reviewers have used \"Grand Theft Auto clone\" to describe games that rest on their own merits, and do not necessarily dismiss the entire class of games as mere imitators.\nGames of this type are sometimes defined under the broader terminology \"open-world games\" or \"sandbox games\". However, many games that predate \"Grand Theft Auto III\", such as ' from 1986, are also called open-world games, while games like ' have been called \"sandbox games\". Conflictingly games such as \"Grand Theft Auto III\" and \"Body Harvest\" are credited with inventing this genre more than a decade later. Furthermore, reviewers have stated that this genre does not include every game with a freely explorable world and that this genre is much more specific, thus excluding the free-roaming titles that take place on foot such as \"Spider-Man 2\" and \"\" from this class of games. The terminology is inconsistent, sometimes including any game with open level design, while other times focusing on a specific genre created at the turn of the century.\nWithout clear classifications to describe the genre popularized by \"Grand Theft Auto\", reviewers have created a number of alternate names for this genre. Some reviewers have focused on the pervasive criminal themes and content in the genre, using terminology such as \"crime games\", \"crime-based action games\", and \"gangsta genre\". Other journalists have emphasized gameplay by describing the genre as \"free-roaming action-adventure games\", \"driving-and-shooting games\", and \"driving-action hybrids\".\nSome games that are considered \"Grand Theft Auto\" clones or share many similar gameplay features (such as the ' series or the ' series) should not be considered a complete copy of the game. For example, despite being an open-world action game with vehicle hijacking, conflicts with police, and missions from criminal factions, \"Just Cause\" is more styled like an action movie with an emphasis on stunts, gadgets, and explosions. \"Saints Row\", despite being almost exactly like \"Grand Theft Auto\" in gameplay, is extremely comedic, outlandish and much less realistic than the \"GTA\" series.\nRockstar's Response.\nAs a result of such similarities, &lt;a href=\"Rockstar%20Games\"&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/a&gt; has placed several Easter eggs to mock the competition.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto III\", the player is tasked with the mission &lt;a href=\"Two-Faced%20Tanner\"&gt;Two-Faced Tanner&lt;/a&gt;, where they must kill a \"strangely animated\" undercover cop. The \"Tanner\" character is described as being \"totally useless outside of his car\", a reference to the lack of on-foot action in \"Driver 2\". Rockstar even went so far as to give Tanner a female walking animation.\nIn \"\", during the mission \"&lt;a href=\"Autocide\"&gt;Autocide&lt;/a&gt;\", the targets that &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Vercetti\"&gt;Tommy Vercetti&lt;/a&gt; must kill are subtle references to the main characters of \"Driver 2\" (Dick Tanner, after Tanner) and \"The Getaway\" (Marcus Hammond and Franco Carter, after Mark Hammond and Frank Carter). \"Driver 3\" responded by including ten hidden enemies named \"Timmy Vermicelli\" (after \"Vice City\" protagonist Tommy Vercetti), who wore waterwings (referencing the lack of &lt;a href=\"swimming\"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA III\" and \"VC\").\nAs a mockery of \"Driver 3\", \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" included a mission where, while &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%27s%20Rhymes\"&gt;breaking into&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg\"&gt;Madd Dogg&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Madd%20Dogg%27s%20Crib\"&gt;mansion&lt;/a&gt;, there is a man playing an (unseen) video game and making fun of the way the main character walks (Tanner's walking animations were often criticized) and asking how \"Refractions\" (A spoof of Reflections Interactive, the designers of the \"Driver\" series) could \"mess up so bad\".\nLuxoflux, the developer of \"True Crime: Streets of LA\", also responded by putting up billboards in their game mocking the Rockstar Games logo used to advertise jockstraps around Los Angeles, California. In response to the \"Jockstrap\" billboard, another \"San Andreas\" Easter egg mocks \"True Crime\". This is in the form of the &lt;a href=\"True%20Grime%20Street%20Cleaners\"&gt;True Grime Street Cleaners&lt;/a&gt; company which is widely advertised on billboards around the state. There is also a vehicle cheat code on the PC version, \"TRUEGRIME\", that spawns a &lt;a href=\"Trashmaster\"&gt;garbage truck&lt;/a&gt; on input, mocking \"True Crime\". &lt;a href=\"Home%20Invasion\"&gt;One mission&lt;/a&gt; features &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt;, before entering and robbing a house, crying \"Yeah, yeah, we gotta do it ninja style.\", a coin phrase for the \"True Crime\" protagonist, Nick Kang. And in a &lt;a href=\"Opposition%20Memorial\"&gt;cemetery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, gravestones with \"R.I.P. Opposition, 1997-2004\" can be seen, as Rockstar implies that \"San Andreas\" has \"killed\" the competition. Luxoflux again referenced \"GTA\" and its use of remote-controlled vehicles in the \"GTA III\" era in \"True Crime: New York City\", by having the protagonist, Det. Marcus Reed, say at the start of a mission: \"Now I gotta be a cab driver for this fool? Next thing you know I'll be flying remote controlled toys and shit.\" Another reference in \"True Crime: NYC\" has a driver yelling \"what the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Hell\"&gt;Blue Hell&lt;/a&gt; are you doing?!\" when Marcus hits his car, mocking the Blue Hell glitch in the \"GTA\" games.\nWhen \"Saints Row 2\" was released in 2008, Rockstar did not have time to respond as THQ ran a television commercial that mocked \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\" for some of its features, mainly &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Bellic\"&gt;Roman Bellic&lt;/a&gt;'s phone calls. No controversy came of this, and no actual footage of \"GTA IV\" was shown, but the ad did feature the &lt;a href=\"Pricedown\"&gt;Pricedown&lt;/a&gt; font, which is the font used on all \"GTA\" logos since \"GTA III\".\nSome time after both \"Saints Row IV\" and \"Grand Theft Auto V\" were released, there was a DLC for \"Saints Row IV\" on PC named \"GAT V\" which mocked \"GTA V\" for its absence on that platform at the time."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Cbermacht\"&gt;\u00dcbermacht&lt;/a&gt; in the HD Universe.\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nThroughout the 3D Universe, the Sentinel is depicted as a mid-size luxury four-door sedan based on various sedans, with differences in design cues reflecting the game's respective time periods.\n&lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;At one point of \"GTA III\"'s development&lt;/a&gt;, the Sentinel was named the \"Beamer\" (Beamer, or Beemer, is a common slang term given to BMW cars, especially the modified ones). &lt;a href=\"Beamer\"&gt;A car of this name&lt;/a&gt; was previously featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%202\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto 2&lt;/a&gt;\", and was also based on a BMW. Meanwhile, a \"&lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Sentinal&lt;/a&gt;\" was also in the process of development, appearing as a modern mid-size car that would go on to become the &lt;a href=\"Kuruma\"&gt;Kuruma&lt;/a&gt;. Both beta cars can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20Autos\"&gt;Capital Autos&lt;/a&gt; website.\n&lt;a href=\"Beta%20Releases%23Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Cbermacht\"&gt;\u00dcbermacht&lt;/a&gt; Sentinel in is redesigned into a compact two-door sports coupe, heavily based on the . The front fascia is similar to the , as seen in the headlight shape and front bumper. The tail light layout, as well as the hood scoop/vents and large rear wing of the XS variant, is derived from the .\nThe Sentinel assumes a more rounded design, with a detailed bumper, flat grille and single headlamps. Two small intakes can be seen on either side of the bonnet. The sides have long vertical vents on the front fenders, angled side skirts and a detail running towards the rear. Also visible are miniscule &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Tuning%20Division\"&gt;STD&lt;/a&gt; badges in front of the doors, near the side skirts and front wheel wells. The rear end features a standard set of tail lamps on either, and a detailed boot, featuring chrome letterings displaying the car's manufacturer and name on the lower sides, a chrome strip above the license plate, and the manufacturer's emblem above.\nThe Sentinel spawns in a variety of primary colours on the body and usually with silver or black secondary painted alloy rims, except for one set with gold rims. The vehicle uses 12-spoke rims with a chrome lip around, as well as low-profile tyres.\nIt is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; system with a female voice, but only if the player leaves the \"selected cars\" (default) option in the audio menu.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Sentinel is redesigned once again in and into a hard-top convertible, inspired by the , although the grille is a single unit as opposed to the trademark \"kidney\" grille found on BMW models. This gives the car a front facia appearance somewhat akin to the , with the tail light shape akin to that of the . The exhausts are housed within the painted section of the rear bumper and comprised of a single oval-shaped tip per side, as opposed to the 2-per-side circular tips of the M3 which this model is primarily based upon. The wheels featured on this model bear a striking resemblance to Volk Racing GT30 or Volk Racing RE30 wheels.\nThe overall design of the car remains largely similar to its previous iteration, but the front end is largely dominated by the front intakes, with the central one adopting a small curvature on the lower side. The edges of the car have chrome curved housings with dual circular lamps. The greenhouse area remains similar, although the front seats are moved slightly backwards and the doors are a bit longer, resulting in a vehicle with ample room. The rear end received numerous changes in terms of details, with the tail lamps being larger, the boot having a lip above the license plate and the exhaust located within the rear end. A black portion can be seen below, housing two square reverse lamps.\nThe car is prominently painted in a primary colour, with the lower portions of the front and the sides, the rear-view mirrors and the retractable roof painted in a secondary colour. The stitches found in the interior matches with the primary colour. The rim design is shared with the &lt;a href=\"Feltzer\"&gt;Feltzer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fusilade\"&gt;Fusilade&lt;/a&gt;, being identical to the \"Organic Type D\" sport wheels available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nWith a sturdy engine in all its appearances, the Sentinel has a decent top speed and acceleration despite its heavy weight. The car handles well, although it suffers from body roll in \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\". It comes with good drifting properties, although its RWD layout sometimes leads to oversteer and tailspins; these problems are more apparent in the case of the \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" rendition, due to its lighter weight distribution and softer suspension. In the very same game, the Sentinel is the second fastest four-door car in the game. Also, the Sentinel in all games is known to be durable due to its luxury build and heavy weight, which can withstand large amounts of damage before it is destroyed, making it a suitable choice for street racing, pursuits, getaways and as a cover in shootouts.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nAs a sport compact executive coupe, the Sentinel reaches a superb top speed, but not far from the fastest vehicles in the game. It has above-average acceleration, and reaches its top speed fairly quickly as well. The Sentinel's suspension is rather soft, and it tends to roll when going around tight bends at high speed; the rear of the car also tends to bounce about when travelling on uneven roads. Its handling is above average, but at high speeds it loses a lot of grip and easily spins out of control due to the lack of weight in the rear. But if controlled right, its speed and grip can be combined to produce almost-professional like drifts that can be used to slide into sharp turns and back alleyways to evade the police without difficulty. Nonetheless, it is arguably the best choice in the modern category in multiplayer &lt;a href=\"Races%20in%20GTA%20IV\"&gt;racing&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sentinel is powered by a twin-cam, four-cylinder engine fitted with a turbocharger, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. Its engine sound is similar to vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Chavos\"&gt;Chavos&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Sentinel received massive improvements, such as increases in top speed and acceleration, braking distance and gear shifting. Crash deformation is acceptable, and can take multiple crashes to even deform the front end. The engine is strangely exposed to gun-fire, taking the most damage from gun-fire, which is strange to say as it is completely covered. Crash deformation at higher speeds is high (quarter panels of the car may look to be \"glitched\" into the wheel wells if hit hard enough), and it is not hard with this car to make the wheels jam in crashes, but the car can withstand a surprising amount of frontal impacts without failing. The Sentinel is a decent car to use in online races and is even better in &lt;a href=\"Freemode\"&gt;Freemode&lt;/a&gt; sessions, thanks to its very smooth and precise driving which compensates for its (relatively) low acceleration compared to other cars.\nAgain, the Sentinel is powered by a twin-cam, four-cylinder engine fitted with a turbocharger, this time coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. Its engine sound is similar to vehicles like the &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"FQ%202\"&gt;FQ 2&lt;/a&gt;.\nGallery.\nDesign.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nSecond Generation (GTA V) (Hard Top)=\nSecond Generation (Topless)=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nProminent Appearances in Gameplay.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\".\nThe Sentinel is prominently featured multiple times in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\", all of which are depicted with a dark gray/black body color:\nLocations.\nSentinels are generally found throughout the business districts of all the cities; some can be seen driving in the suburbs and wealthy parts of town as well."}

The front fascia is inspired by the , with the headlamps taken from the .\nThe design of the car is reminiscent of the \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\" renditions of the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, although it is designed as a 2-door coup\u00e9 rather than a 4-door sedan. The front of the car is predominated by the front bumper, which features thin intakes on the centre, the rectangular fog lamps on the outer sides and the lip/splitter at the bottom. The upper area features plastic trim around the grille and the headlamps, along with the classic \u00dcbermacht logo on the bonnet and the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Tuning%20Division\"&gt;Sentinel Tuning Division&lt;/a&gt; badge on the grille. The sides feature slightly wider fenders and skirts compared to the rest of the body, as well as sectioned ridges on the fenders and the doors. The cabin features plastic trim around the windows and body-coloured mirror wings. The rear end features a plastic panel that houses the rectangular tail lamps and the license plate, while the boot features a small lip, the classic \u00dcbermacht logo on the centre and the \"UM\" badge below the passenger-side tail lamp. The rear bumper is relatively bulky and has two mouldings for the exhaust tubes. The vehicle has a unique 1980s style dashboard model and interior textures named after the vehicle itself, and has its own steering wheel with a \u2018Turbo\u2019 badging onto the horn cap.\nThe primary colour of the car is applied on the bodywork, while the secondary colour is applied on the grille and the ridges found on the bumper and the sides. A trim colour is also available for the dashboard, doors, seats, and also the pads on the roll cage (can be seen when \"Padded Dash Dodger Cage\" or \"Padded Full Roll Cage\" applies on the vehicle). Its wheels are shared with the &lt;a href=\"Cheetah%20Classic\"&gt;Cheetah Classic&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nDespite the Sentinel's statistics, it performs better than advertised. Acceleration is unbelievably quick, despite the car's acceleration bar, which are telling a different story. Brakes are quite strong, but their effectiveness when driving at high speeds is severely decreased. The Sentinel shares some handling traits with the &lt;a href=\"Futo\"&gt;Futo&lt;/a&gt;, such as its light back end that makes it prone to oversteer. Fitting the Sentinel Classic with off-road tires gives it performance benefits when driving around dirt road, making it a potential vehicle for off-road races.\nLike the Futo, the Sentinel Classic is powered by an inline-4 engine with throttle bodies, which is coupled to a 5-speed gearbox and powering the rear wheels. The engine sound seems to be a lower-pitched variation of the one used in the &lt;a href=\"Stinger%20GT\"&gt;Stinger GT&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Issi%20Classic\"&gt;Issi Classic&lt;/a&gt;. True to the badging and despite there being no turbocharger on the engine model, the vehicle\u2019s stock engine can be clearly heard utilising a turbocharger, evidenced by the blow-off valve sound. It should also be noted that this sound has a much higher pitch than other vehicles equipped with turbo, and is unique to this vehicle. "}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Cbermacht\"&gt;\u00dcbermacht&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n3D Universe.\nThe Sentinel XS is a modified version of the regular &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, being suggestively based on the and , the high-performance luxury version of the BMW E23 7 Series and E24 6 Series, respectively.\nThe Sentinel XS in ' shares many characteristics from its standard counterpart, but features a small hood scoop, rear louvers and a small spoiler. In ', the regular Sentinel is not given the same lower body extensions as the game's Sentinel XS, resulting in the latter appearing more distinctive in the game.\nThe car is related to the &lt;a href=\"Mafia%20Sentinel\"&gt;Mafia/Leone Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, gang car of the &lt;a href=\"Leone%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Leone Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\". In \"GTA Vice City Stories\", the Sentinel XS is the preferred gang car of the &lt;a href=\"Mendez%20Cartel\"&gt;Mendez Cartel&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Sentinel XS in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" is based on the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, but features a fixed roof in place of the folding hard top, and the lower portions of the front and sides, the rear-view mirrors and the roof panel were finished in .\nThe car is prominently painted in a primary colour for the body and the interior stitching. The car also uses a different set of wheels, being identical to the \"Cosmo\" wheels available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the , all of the carbon-fibre components are replaced by secondary-coloured parts.\nThe Sentinel XS model was later updated in update in December 2021. Although the model didn't receive any visual changes in the design, the model was updated to fix a graphical glitch which caused the passenger side window to slightly glow as an emissive light. The model also received liveries, with two additional liveries added later when converted to the &lt;a href=\"Hao%27s%20Special%20Works\"&gt;Hao's Special Works&lt;/a&gt; variant, exclusive to the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online/Editions\"&gt;Expanded &amp; Enhanced&lt;/a&gt; edition.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nThe Sentinel XS in \"\" possesses superior acceleration, braking, and handling abilities compared with the normal Sentinel. Like the normal Sentinel, it is a RWD vehicle, but it is also far more stable in turns than the normal Sentinel and other RWD cars, and is far less prone to oversteer (though oversteer will still occur if the Sentinel XS is drifted too heavily via handbrake). This stability may be attributed to the spoiler-induced downforce that keeps its rear wheels from losing traction, which in turn may be the reason behind the slight-to-moderate understeer experienced in the Sentinel XS at corners. This understeer can be corrected by tapping the brakes to induce the front end to rotate better. The powerful engine of the car is coupled up to a five-speed gearbox.\nIt is possible that the Sentinel XS has a supercharged engine, due to the fact that other supercharged cars in the \"GTA\" series have the same engine noise, like the &lt;a href=\"Windsor\"&gt;Windsor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Phoenix\"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; in ', the &lt;a href=\"Mafia%20Sentinel\"&gt;Leone Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Vehicles\"&gt;beta&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Cruiser\"&gt;Cartel Cruiser&lt;/a&gt; in ', and the &lt;a href=\"Washington\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; in \"\".\nOverall, its combination of speed and good stability make the Sentinel XS a fine vehicle to go &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Street%20Racer\"&gt;racing&lt;/a&gt; with.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nPerformance-wise, the Sentinel XS is identical to the regular model, being a good performing vehicle with good top speed and acceleration. While it is generally good at withstanding several collisions, its body is rather weak, and can be easily deformed at high speeds, increasing the chances of jamming the front wheels.\nAgain, the Sentinel is powered by a twin-cam, four-cylinder engine fitted with a turbocharger, this time coupled to a 6-speed gearbox in a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. Its engine sound is the same as the regular Sentinel.\nSpecial Variants.\nEpsilon.\nA unique colored variant of the Sentinel XS spawns in the mission &lt;a href=\"Unknowing%20the%20Truth\"&gt;Unknowing the Truth&lt;/a&gt;. It appears in Epsilon colors, but unlike other cars, does not appear with a Kifflom license plate."}

Later when approaching the warehouse, Trevor informs the crew that two of them will be positioned at the north end of the warehouse and two at the south end. The crew will have to defend Trevor and the trucks, before moving the trucks to the buyer's meeting place at a house by &lt;a href=\"El%20Gordo%20Lighthouse\"&gt;El Gordo Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;. Ron also sends a text message warning the players they must deliver the product quickly, or the buyer will \"walk\" and fail the heist.\nWith the initial attacks at the warehouse fended off, the crew will have to transport the trucks to the lighthouse, with two players in &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;s and two players defending the trucks using the &lt;a href=\"Technical\"&gt;Technical&lt;/a&gt; or their personal vehicles. Along the delivery route, the attackers will continue to pursue the convoy, with &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Ballas&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Baller\"&gt;Baller&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20MC\"&gt;The Lost&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Slamvan\"&gt;Slamvans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daemon\"&gt;Daemon&lt;/a&gt;s, and the frat boys in &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;Frogger&lt;/a&gt;s (if they are not taken out at the initial part of the getaway). The heist concludes when the Mules converge at the Lighthouse. Trevor thanks the crew for successfully moving the product to its destination, and gives a garbage bag of &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;cash&lt;/a&gt; to the crew, telling them to disperse before more attention arrives.\nIn the cutscene after the heist, the &lt;a href=\"Phil%20%28DOA%20Agent%29\"&gt;buyer&lt;/a&gt; asks Trevor, \"by name,\" where the &lt;a href=\"cocaine\"&gt;\"cocaine\"&lt;/a&gt; is, which makes Trevor grow suspicious, as he never revealed his name to the buyer and neither that he was selling cocaine. It turns out that the drug deal is actually a sting operation, and the buyer is a &lt;a href=\"Drug%20Observation%20Agency\"&gt;DOA&lt;/a&gt; agent in disguise. The agent tries to make the arrest, but Trevor dives off of a cliff into the water and stays submerged while being fired upon by the agent and the LSPD. Trevor manages to elude the authorities and swims to shore.\nA short cutscene follows directly after this, featuring Trevor hitting his head repeatedly on a tree and then leaning on it afterwards, sobbing over the unsuccessful deal, with only a small &lt;a href=\"Impotent%20Rage\"&gt;Impotent Rage&lt;/a&gt; statue as his consolation.\nThe crew is shown outside of the &lt;a href=\"Park%20View%20Diner\"&gt;Park View Diner&lt;/a&gt;."}

The bi-xenon headlights are much like that of the , but with added LED turning signals.\nThe Serrano is depicted as a small SUV with a similar size as the &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Cbermacht\"&gt;\u00dcbermacht&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rebla\"&gt;Rebla&lt;/a&gt;. The bumper features a small bottom lip/extender and a set of meshed intakes, where the central one spans about half the car's width and bears a black horizontal divider on the middle, while the outer ones house non-functional fog lamps. On the upper area, the central section features a silver/chrome grille of about the same width as the central intake and bears the manufacturer logo on the centre, while the outer sections have large headlamp housings with black trim around, each one having dual circular main lamps on the upper side and wide turn signals on the lower side. The bonnet has a slight elevation starting from the grille and going towards either A-pillar of the cabin, fitted with small intakes near the windscreen.\nThe sides of the car are predominated by the bulky wheel arches, the small exit vents on the front fenders and the small side steps at the bottom. There are impressed areas passing through the doors, with the upper lines being angled upwards and almost reaching the top of the rear tail lamps. The cabin area makes use of black trim around the windows and on the pillars, only leaving coloured portions on the A-pillars and the upper borders of the roof area, as well as coloured mirror wings with black supports. The roof panel has two black long strips on the sides that separate it from the rest of the car.\nThe rear of the SUV is somewhat curved in appearance and features a large compartment door, which has a small top lip, a dedicated central section for the license plate and the corresponding badges above and beside it. The outer sections have large tail lamps with a black detail around them, each one consisting of large main/brake lamps, lower reverse lamps and upper, smaller turn signals. The bumper is relatively large and also has a small bottom lip/extender, while two exhaust tubes can be seen below it.\nThe interior is similar to &lt;a href=\"Habanero\"&gt;Habanero&lt;/a&gt;'s, but the steering wheel bears a &lt;a href=\"Benefactor\"&gt;Benefactor&lt;/a&gt; logo instead of &lt;a href=\"Albany\"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt;'s or &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20%28manufacturer%29\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;'s.\nThe Serrano assigns a primary colour for the body and the secondary colour for the surrounding of the grille, the bonnet and the roof panel, although the car does not have different secondary colours set. The vehicle shares the same five-spoke wide rims with the Habanero, but they appear to have more depth than the former's.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Serrano returns in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" and is mostly unchanged from its first appearance.

In terms of handling, the Serrano's cornering performance is average due to its excess weight, and the Serrano tends to suffer from understeer around tight bends. It is, however, easy to drive when used properly.\nThe Serrano is stated to be fitted with a supercharged V12 engine similar to the &lt;a href=\"Schafter\"&gt;Schafter&lt;/a&gt;. However, it is actually modeled as a turbocharged twin-cam inline-4 engine and coupled to a 5-speed gearbox, which is laid in a front engine, all wheel drive layout (50% front, 50% rear torque distribution). The engine sound appears to be a higher-revving variation of the one used in cars like the &lt;a href=\"Rebla\"&gt;Rebla&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Habanero\"&gt;Habanero&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Landstalker\"&gt;Landstalker&lt;/a&gt;, unique to this vehicle.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Serrano produces a moderate amount of torque, and achieves an just above average top speed. Its four-wheel drive setup allows the car to operate exceptionally well off-road.\nOnce again, the side badges states that the Serrano features a V12 engine. However, the engine is actually modeled as a turbocharged twin-cam Inline-4 engine with a 6-speed gearbox. It is laid in a front engine, all wheel drive layout (60% front, 40% rear torque distribution). The car has a mid-revving engine sound shared with the &lt;a href=\"Blista\"&gt;Blista&lt;/a&gt;."}

The car also takes a large amount of influence from the in the front fascia, particularly in the front grille and central bonnet vent; its element design is also visible in its headlights (though the Seven-70's headlights are smaller) and the unique side vents, which link airflow from the bonnet along the flanks of the car. The C-pillar is similar to the , while the rear bumper, diffuser, and exhausts resemble those of the . \nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nIn the front profiling, the car features many grille elements, with a significant curve running from the wings of the car down to the base of the front, supporting two vertical elements of the main grille. Below this is a carbon-fibre splitter, and beside the grille and splitter are dual intakes that direct airflow through the front brakes. The upper area of the Seven-70 has LED headlamps on the outer sides, with carbon-fibre bezel interior and LED strips running down the outer side of the lamp. In its stock configuration, the vehicle has three grilles positioned on the bonnet: one centralised at the front directly behind the car emblem and two just above the car's front wings.\nOn the side profiling, the car's belt line down the side of the car remains straight until reaching the B-pillar, where it splits to form a character line which results in the large curved boot of the car. The Seven-70 has a simple sharp groove down the side, which is similar to that found on the F12berlinetta. This groove forms as part of a fender vent/gill which runs inline with the curvature of the front wing, directly behind the front wheels, together with silver/chrome trim above, cut in half by the front door line. The line formed as part of the door pillar is also based on the One-77's. Behind the side window, there is a small window channel, followed by a much smaller window which ignores the typical curved shape found on other sports cars. The vehicle has a carbon-fibre roof and silver side door trim, as well as sleek mirror wings near the A-pillar. The rear window is rather small and resembles the One-77's.\nThe rear fascia is slightly different from those of most other Dewbauchee vehicles, omitting the signature C-shaped rear lights. Instead, the Seven-70 features much smaller rear lights that are predominantly red, with the lowermost being the reverse lights. The top area curves upwards and extends a bit towards the rear to form a lip spoiler, which has a flat profile on the centre, where the boot lid is located. On the lower area, the Seven-70 has twin-exit twin exhausts with chrome circular exhaust tips and carbon-fibre-grille exhaust housing, all positioned behind the rear wheels. Also on the rear is a large six-element, carbon-fibre diffuser, with a central grille splitting the diffuser in half below the rear number plate in an inset body panel. The Dewbauchee logo is placed on top, over the rear portion of the boot lid. The interior of the car is the same as that found in the &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20GT\"&gt;Rapid GT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"9F\"&gt;9F&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle only has a single colour, which is applied on the bodywork, mirror wings and interior stitching. The wheels have a unique rim design, consisting of six spokes with a rather concave portion around the centre, fitted with low-profile tyres.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe car is a high-performing car for its class, falling short of the power and acceleration required of a supercar, although the Seven-70 has a very high top speed. The car has a relatively heavy weight, a fact that, along with its RWD drivetrain, means it lags behind other sports cars in terms of acceleration. It also suffers from poor traction. It is slightly heavier than the &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20GT\"&gt;Rapid GT&lt;/a&gt;, but it is still lighter than the 4-door &lt;a href=\"Exemplar\"&gt;Exemplar&lt;/a&gt; and the 2-door &lt;a href=\"Massacro\"&gt;Massacro&lt;/a&gt;. The car has a six-speed gearbox that gives it much more potential in speed, whereas a few other sports cars have only five-speed gearboxes.\nThe engine sound is a variation on the &lt;a href=\"Massacro\"&gt;Massacro&lt;/a&gt;'s and &lt;a href=\"F620\"&gt;F620&lt;/a&gt;'s, being a high-revving engine, with smoother timing and louder combustion. The engine cover appears to be a V8 with cold-air intakes from the grilles."}

Both the Seville Boulevard Families and the Temple Drive Families were split due to disagreements with the main Grove Street Families gang, who didn't allow distribution of powerful drugs in their territory through Sweet's leadership (particularly crack cocaine).\nShortly before 1992, Seville Boulevard Families became enemies of Temple Drive Families, starting a small scale three-way war between the three sets. By 1992, Grove Street Families is referred to as the \"OG Family set\" by the members of the original gang after the split, in order to differentiate the main gang from the enemy sets.\nDue to bad leadership of both enemy sets, the Ballas gang managed to \"take control\" of both sets by selling crack cocaine to the members, making them weak and allowing them to use both former Grove Street Families turfs for crack distribution.\nThe Families' gun supplier &lt;a href=\"Emmet\"&gt;Emmet&lt;/a&gt; became a member of Seville Boulevard Families set after the gang split, although he never shows hostility to the original Grove Street Families. &lt;a href=\"Ryder\"&gt;Ryder&lt;/a&gt;'s contact &lt;a href=\"LB\"&gt;LB&lt;/a&gt; is implied to be a friendly Seville Boulevard Families member.\nHistory.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nIn 1992, Sweet's mother &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Johnson\"&gt;Beverly Johnson&lt;/a&gt; is killed in a drive-by shooting by the Ballas, prompting his brother Carl Johnson to return to Los Santos from Liberty City since Brian's death in 1987.\nUnaware of the gang split, Carl Johnson briefly visits the former Grove Street Families territory in &lt;a href=\"Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt;, now run by the enemy Temple Drive Families set, and realizes the bad situation within the main gang. Sweet explains the situation through a phone call after Beverly's funeral, and begins working to help Grove Street Families get back in the map.\nPlaya del Seville Ambush.\nAt one point, Sweet starts a relationship with a girl from the Seville Boulevard Families, and in one of his visits, Sweet is targeted by the enemy set.

{"id": "1769", "revid": "28170099", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1769", "title": "Shamal", "text": "The Shamal is a multi-role &lt;a href=\"Airplanes\"&gt;jet-plane&lt;/a&gt; in \"\" and a regional jet in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\". It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Buckingham\"&gt;Buckingham&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nSimilar business jets also makes multiple appearances in other \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/a&gt;\" games, although they are uncontrollable and are only used as props.\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe aircraft is seemingly based on the , although the nose is considerably longer than most Learjets, resembling later models. The Shamal bears characteristic features from most conventional planes, being the left-side access door/ladder, the and the . The aircraft is only seen in a light gray colour similar to the &lt;a href=\"Hydra\"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt; (though not listed in the car color files).\nThe Shamal's interior can be seen during &lt;a href=\"Freefall\"&gt;Freefall&lt;/a&gt;. The size of the interior appears larger than usual for an aircraft with a relatively small fuselage, and the interior incongruously features 16 windows (nine on the left and seven on the right) when the plane features only eight outside. Despite this, the plane has a very limited passenger capacity.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Shamal appears in the first trailer and later in one of the screenshots for \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", implying that it would most likely return as a functional plane. This was eventually confirmed by the gameplay trailer, that showed the Shamal being flown over the &lt;a href=\"Land%20Act%20Dam\"&gt;Land Act Dam&lt;/a&gt;. The Shamal is based on the , with influences from the and , especially around the cockpit.\nThe vehicle is largely similar to the \"GTA San Andreas\" iteration, albeit with improved details, such as the addition of extra wheels and taxi lights on the main landing undercarriage, windows on either side of the fuselage (having eight windows on each side), and a fully-rendered interior with a brown/tan leather finish and additional seats. The role of the aircraft is different though \u2014 instead of being a business jet, like in \"GTA San Andreas\", it is a commuter jet, being owned by multiple airliners for short regional flights. The role of a private jet is attributed to the &lt;a href=\"Luxor\"&gt;Luxor&lt;/a&gt;, a variant of the Shamal with a black paint scheme.\nThe Shamal is only available in an Ice White colour with an airliner livery applied to it, being: &lt;a href=\"MyFly\"&gt;MyFly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Air%20Emu\"&gt;Air Emu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Air%20Herler\"&gt;Air Herler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FlyUS\"&gt;FlyUS&lt;/a&gt;. These liveries are applied on the sides as two-tone stripes, the winglets, the engines, and the tail. It also has one window on either side that are marked with red outlines, indicating the cut-out zone in event of emergency.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Shamal is available to the player at the beginning of \"\", in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, acquirable by trespassing over the security booth if the player still hasn't got the pilot's licence. It is a considerably fast jet, being on par with the &lt;a href=\"Rustler\"&gt;Rustler&lt;/a&gt;, and due to its availability, the Shamal is a good choice for players who are just learning to fly jets, as its handling is balanced and it is easy to land on runways. Also, despite it visually having a large passenger capacity, it can transport only the player. The Shamal is somewhat decently agile in terms of manoeuvrability, and its availability to the player early in the game provides an easy way to grind their Flying Skill stat before even reaching &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Meadows%20Airfield\"&gt;Verdant Meadows Airfield&lt;/a&gt; much later in the storyline.\nThe Shamal is powered by twin engines, sharing the engine sound with most jet-powered aircraft.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Shamal remains a great plane for learning to pilot, as it has great and responsive handling, as well as being a generally fast aircraft, beating most propeller-powered planes. Similar to \"GTA San Andreas\", it is also available from the start in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, and players can easily evade police attention if they did not purchase a hangar yet. In the hands of a moderately skilled pilot, it can easily win any \"GTA Online\" races. Thanks to the speed and handling of the aircraft, it also has a great capability for performing stunts, being able to steer and perform aileron rolls extremely fast.\nAgain, the Shamal is powered by twin engines, with a rather loud sound (though still quieter and low-pitched compared to the one on the &lt;a href=\"Jet\"&gt;Jet&lt;/a&gt;).\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nUpon being converted into a personal aircraft, the Shamal can have one of the four livery sets mentioned above. However, there is no way to change its base colour."}

Even though not as common as most sea creatures, they can be spotted everywhere in the &lt;a href=\"Water\"&gt;waters&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;the city&lt;/a&gt; and, due to the slightly similar body, they can sometimes be mistaken as &lt;a href=\"dolphins\"&gt;dolphins&lt;/a&gt;. Sharks do not take damage when shot at, and like other marine animals in \"GTA Vice City\", don't have any movement animation when swimming. The easiest way to spot a shark is to just search the water for it, preferably through a &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Sniper Rifle&lt;/a&gt;. The player can also kill a shark by throwing &lt;a href=\"grenades\"&gt;grenades&lt;/a&gt; at it.\nSharks are also mentioned in the 10th page of the \"GTA Vice City\" manual: \"Shark attacks off Vice City happen a few times a year and there are more sharks out there than you would like to think \u2013 Best advice: Stay out of the water!\". This might suggest that sharks could have been used as an excuse for the player's inability to &lt;a href=\"Swimming\"&gt;swim&lt;/a&gt; in \"GTA Vice City\".\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nSharks appear in \"GTA San Andreas\", but are very rare and are not hostile towards the player. Given the somewhat murky waters in some areas of San Andreas, in particular &lt;a href=\"San%20Fierro%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Fierro&lt;/a&gt;, the species in the game is most likely the , which is similar in appearance to the .\nHD Universe.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nSharks appear in varying depths of ocean around &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt; and, unlike their &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; versions, are fast and dangerous predators that often attack the player on sight. In the regular &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PS3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; versions of the game, the only present sharks are modeled after a hybrid of the and the . In the , while playing as one of these sharks after eating a &lt;a href=\"Peyote%20Plants%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;Peyote plant&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt;, he states that they are Tiger Sharks.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Abigail%20Mathers\"&gt;Abigail Mathers&lt;/a&gt; in the \"&lt;a href=\"Death%20at%20Sea\"&gt;Death at Sea&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Strangers%20and%20Freaks\"&gt;stranger&lt;/a&gt; mission, the sharks in San Andreas are bordering on extinction, explaining how they seldom appear in-game. Getting killed by a shark unlocks the \"Out of Your Depth\" &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20and%20Trophies%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;Achievement/Trophy&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpawning more frequently at night, sharks appear on the &lt;a href=\"Radar\"&gt;minimap&lt;/a&gt; as a red dot (enemy) and will stalk and circle the player for a while before attacking. Sometimes, they will appear in pairs. If the player reaches the end of the map (where &lt;a href=\"Vehicles%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;vehicles&lt;/a&gt; will no longer function), a shark is scripted to appear and kill the player in order to prevent them from venturing any further. Sharks attack once, killing on the first attack (even if the player has full &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Body%20Armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;), by grabbing &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt; with their teeth and then shaking their bodies. If the player is on the surface they can sometimes see the shark's fin sticking out the water as it circles.\nSharks can be killed if the player is on a boat and shoots one, which only takes one shot. It is, therefore, recommended to look out for sharks and kill them from the surface before diving into the water. They can also be killed in the water by repeatedly attacking with a &lt;a href=\"knife\"&gt;knife&lt;/a&gt; (although this is extremely difficult), or running into them in a &lt;a href=\"Boats\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Submersible\"&gt;Submersible&lt;/a&gt;. If the player is in the water and is too deep down/far out to return to their boat or the shore in the event of a shark encounter, swimming into sunken plane and ship ruins will often cause the shark to swim away. Like other animals in the game, live sharks are only present in \"GTA V\".\nHammerhead Sharks.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204\"&gt;PlayStation 4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One\"&gt;Xbox One&lt;/a&gt; versions of \"GTA V\" have, in addition to the existing Tiger Sharks, as part of the fauna. However, unlike the Tiger Sharks, they never attack the player."}

The car also has an unknown window tint applied by default.\nThe vehicle comes in a black/white paint scheme with yellow \"SHERIFF\" markings around, as well as aerial roof numbers alternating between the following combinations: 05, 32, 76, 84. Like several other marked police vehicles, the SUV features a number on the rear fascia that always end in the two digits of the aerial roof number. Files indicate that the vehicle spawns in white, which is actually applied on the doors and the roof (although only one example spawns in black with a white portion for the roof number). Its rims are also different compared to the regular Granger, being similar to the industrial rims seen in industrial vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Benson\"&gt;Benson&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with a black finish.\nIn the enhanced versions of the game, the vehicle uses a different siren set, with its primary wail and secondary yelp tones being higher-pitched variations of the ones used on the &lt;a href=\"FIB%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Buffalo\"&gt;vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, while the auxiliary/phaser tone remains the same as other police vehicles.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Sheriff SUV, along with the &lt;a href=\"FIB%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Park%20Ranger\"&gt;Park Ranger&lt;/a&gt;, is easily the best performing SUV in the game. It improves on the civilian vehicle in every way, with good acceleration (about on par with the &lt;a href=\"Interceptor\"&gt;Interceptor&lt;/a&gt;), and stiff suspension, which prevents it from rolling over in high speed turns. It also has a high top speed, great off-road performance, and decent brakes. It shares the same handling line with its FIB equivalent.\nThe Sheriff SUV is a large vehicle, and because of this, can hold up to eight passengers (four inside and four outside), which makes it one of the largest capacity vehicles in the game in this regard. The Sheriff SUV, due to its great torque and weight, is able to barrel through most cars on the road, including roadblocks, fences, and even larger cars. The passengers hanging onto the outside are able to use &lt;a href=\"Assault%20Rifles\"&gt;Assault Rifles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Light%20Machine%20Guns\"&gt;Light Machine Guns&lt;/a&gt; while being driven, making this car excellent for &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-by's&lt;/a&gt; and assaulting other cars. Care must be taken by the driver of the vehicle when players are riding on the running boards since they can be knocked off and killed in collisions.\nThe Sheriff SUV is powered by a turbocharged twin-cam Inline-4 coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, all-wheel drive layout (60% front, 40% rear). However, the cover of the engine is more like that of a V8. It supplies enough power for each wheel to gain large amounts of traction and maintains it firm on the ground, which rarely loses speed when going through dirt or sand. Its engine sound is the same one from the regular version, the &lt;a href=\"BeeJay%20XL\"&gt;BeeJay XL&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bodhi\"&gt;Bodhi&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\nJust like the FIB Granger, the Sheriff SUV is much more challenging to obtain than other police vehicles."}

Once there, Carl sneaks past security guards and plant technicians in order to place the explosive charges.

The government sets up a deal with the Los Santos Angels to recover said resources in exchange for a large amount of cash. &lt;a href=\"Avi%20Schwartzman\"&gt;Avi Schwartzman&lt;/a&gt; also makes an appearance in the mission, supplying the player with his keycard which will gain them access to the control room.\nUpon reaching the HQ at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Naval%20Port\"&gt;Los Santos Naval Port&lt;/a&gt;, Charlie shows up in an &lt;a href=\"F-160%20Raiju\"&gt;F-160 Raiju&lt;/a&gt; fighter jet he has borrowed from the client in &lt;a href=\"On%20Parade\"&gt;On Parade&lt;/a&gt;, and uses it to wipe out several helicopters on the helipad, allowing the player to land their Avenger safely.

{"id": "1972", "revid": "27953473", "url": "https://gta.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1972", "title": "Shoreside Vale", "text": "Shoreside Vale is a borough in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Advance\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Advance&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\". It is the third and last borough the player encounters in all the three 3D Universe games based in Liberty City.\nDescription.\nShoreside Vale is primarily residential, but also features the &lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt; to the south, a light commercial and industrial estate (&lt;a href=\"Pike%20Creek\"&gt;Pike Creek&lt;/a&gt;) on the western edge, and the &lt;a href=\"Cochrane%20Dam\"&gt;Cochrane Dam&lt;/a&gt; in the northwestern corner. Shoreside Vale is the only part of the city situated on the mainland and is considerably hillier than the other two boroughs, with a mountain range along the northern edge of the borough.\nWith steep elevation changes, a river dividing the main residential area from the industrial estate and the airport, and roads, bridges and tunnels criss-crossing each other at different elevations, Shoreside Vale is notoriously tricky to navigate. For this reason, Shoreside Vale is a very poor choice for the &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Missions\"&gt;vehicle missions&lt;/a&gt;.\nShoreside Vale was internally named as the 'Suburban' area during development, and, according to beta maps, the southern part of Shoreside Vale was going to consist of roads and possibly more suburbs, until the airport was moved towards Shoreside Vale instead. It is mainly based on the various suburbs in Weschester County in Upstate New York, the Bronx, and parts of north-east New Jersey.\nNeighborhoods, districts and areas.\nCedar Grove.\n&lt;a href=\"Cedar%20Grove\"&gt;Cedar Grove&lt;/a&gt; is an upper-class residential neighborhood which takes its name directly from a New Jersey suburb. It is based on White Plains, New York and Cedar Grove New Jersey. It is controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Colombian%20Cartel\"&gt;Colombian Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, and is home to some of the more wealthy residents of Liberty City. It consists of lavish mansions with swimming pools and fast sports cars on the drive-ways. &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Love\"&gt;Donald Love&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Mansion\"&gt;mansion&lt;/a&gt; (later taken over by &lt;a href=\"Catalina\"&gt;Catalina&lt;/a&gt; and the Colombian Cartel) and one of &lt;a href=\"Toni%20Cipriani\"&gt;Toni Cipriani&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Vale%20Safehouse%20%28GTA%20LCS%29\"&gt;safehouses&lt;/a&gt; in also lie within this area.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Upstate%20Tunnel\"&gt;tunnel&lt;/a&gt; that leads from one side of Cedar Grove to the other seems to have another road that leads to another part of Liberty City. The tunnel is unavailable to the player in GTA III, but in \"GTA Liberty City Stories\" the player is allowed to use it to get to points around Cedar Grove. There seems to be another road that leads to a northern part of Shoreside Vale, but is blocked off and cannot be driven on. The sign above the road reads \"&lt;a href=\"Upstate%20Liberty\"&gt;upstate&lt;/a&gt;\". Rockstar stated there was never meant to be anything on the other side of the tunnel, but was used to give the player a feeling that Liberty City was larger than just the areas the player could explore. In \"GTA III\" the player can fly a &lt;a href=\"Dodo\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt; around the \"upstate\" part of Liberty City and will only find more hills. It could possibly be outside Liberty City since the maps of Shoreside Vale show it is part of the mainland.\nFrancis International Airport.\n&lt;a href=\"Francis%20International%20Airport%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Francis International Airport&lt;/a&gt; is Liberty City's airport is situated on the southern half of Shoreside Vale, just off the main road coming into the area. Other features in this district include a long-term parking lot, a &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20Fire%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;fire station&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Subway%20in%20GTA%20III\"&gt;subway&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shoreside%20Terminal%20LCS\"&gt;station&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Car\"&gt;police car&lt;/a&gt; parked. There is a lot of airplanes and helicopters around the airport, however, none of them are accessible, with exception of the &lt;a href=\"Dodo\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt;.\nPike Creek.\n&lt;a href=\"Pike%20Creek\"&gt;Pike Creek&lt;/a&gt; is a light commercial and industrial district located in the western section of Shoreside Vale and is very similar to industrial areas on the outskirts of Yonkers, New York and Newark, New Jersey. It is home to the offices of several businesses, including &lt;a href=\"Punk%20Noodles\"&gt;Punk Noodles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turtle%20Head%20Fishing%20Co.\"&gt;Turtle Head Fishing Co.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AMCo.%20Petroleum%20Company\"&gt;AMCo. Petroleum Company&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Pharmaceuticals\"&gt;Liberty Pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt;. Services include the local police station, the &lt;a href=\"Hope%20Medical%20College\"&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pay%20%27n%27%20Spray\"&gt;Pay 'n' Spray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"8-Ball\"&gt;8-Ball's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"8-Ball%20Autos\"&gt;bomb shop&lt;/a&gt;.

Franklin questions why they don't just let the police handle it as &lt;a href=\"LD%20Organics\"&gt;LD Organics&lt;/a&gt; is a legal business that got robbed, but Lamar accuses him of acting like a snitch and that they never used to depend on the cops for such things. Lamar is determined to take back the cannabis scene from corruption and gangsters, comparing himself to &lt;a href=\"Impotent%20Rage\"&gt;Impotent Rage&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey race each other to the first facility, Franklin on his &lt;a href=\"Bagger\"&gt;Bagger&lt;/a&gt; and Lamar in his &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20%28car%29\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, which has now been upgraded by &lt;a href=\"Benny%27s%20Original%20Motor%20Works\"&gt;Benny's Original Motor Works&lt;/a&gt;. On the way, they make multiple references to the missions &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20and%20Lamar\"&gt;Franklin and Lamar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Repossession\"&gt;Repossession&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", with Lamar warning Franklin not to use his &lt;a href=\"Special%20Ability\"&gt;Special Ability&lt;/a&gt; (though he incapable of using it in these missions). Franklin denies having any such ability (nor that he makes a weird face like he is attempting to go to the bathroom as Lamar claims). On reaching the destination, a different cutscene plays out depending on who wins the race. \nThey reach the Vagos' first &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Hardware%20Store\"&gt;weed warehouse&lt;/a&gt; in western &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt; and fight off the Vagos. It is possible to do this either stealthily without being seen, or aggressively, in which case the Vagos will start shooting back. If seen, the Vagos inside the warehouse are alerted when they enter, otherwise, they can also be taken down stealthily. After defeating them, on Lamar's instructions they pick up &lt;a href=\"Fertilizer%20Can\"&gt;Fertilizer Can&lt;/a&gt;s that they pour over the weed and set on fire to burn it all down and exit the first warehouse. Lamar bemoans the destruction of the plants, even if they are substandard.\nIf done stealthily, it is only now that Vagos realize that they are under attack, and two gangsters guarding a nearby &lt;a href=\"Technical%20Custom\"&gt;Technical Custom&lt;/a&gt; start shooting. If done aggressively, more Vagos arrive on the scene using the Technical instead, and the two escape and can fight them off using the mounted .50 calibre gun on the Technical while being chased by Vagos in lowrider &lt;a href=\"Manana%20Custom\"&gt;Manana Custom&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Custom\"&gt;Faction Custom&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer%20Custom\"&gt;Buccaneer Custom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; motorcycles, and a &lt;a href=\"Buzzard%20Attack%20Chopper\"&gt;Buzzard Attack Chopper&lt;/a&gt;. They eventually reach the Vagos' second warehouse on &lt;a href=\"Union%20Road\"&gt;Union Road&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Chianski%20Passage\"&gt;Chianski Passage&lt;/a&gt;, while dealing with more Vagos members and roadblocks consisting of a Manana Custom, a &lt;a href=\"Peyote%20Custom\"&gt;Peyote Custom&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Pounder%20Custom\"&gt;Pounder Custom&lt;/a&gt;. Inside, they repeat the process, with a stash of weed located away from the rest of the stashes.\nThey then take the Vagos' &lt;a href=\"Youga%20Classic\"&gt;Youga Classic&lt;/a&gt; that they find parked in the warehouse as it is still loaded with supplies that Lamar can use back at his business, and Lamar drives to Franklin's &lt;a href=\"3671%20Whispymound%20Drive\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; to drop him off, again while fighting off Vagos along the way, now in &lt;a href=\"Baller%20ST\"&gt;Baller ST&lt;/a&gt;s and Faction Customs. Back in the city, Lamar has Franklin admit that he had fun and gets a laugh out of him with a joke.\nOn arrival, a cutscene plays, where Franklin does not let Lamar inside his house because his kids are home this time, referencing the final cutscene of the Franklin and Lamar mission. Franklin sprays himself with a can of air freshener to mask the smell of the burning cannabis plants before going inside."}

He explains that it is entirely made of \"LD Organics patented marijuana bioplastic\" and unlike his destroyed &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt;, will be empty if someone attempts to break into it to steal his stock, as the weed \"is\" the van. Franklin questions Lamar how he's planning to put it in a blunt if it's a part of the van itself, to which Lamar tells him not to worry about it. He was able to make a connection with a celebrity investor for LD Organics and cajoles Franklin to come with him to the meeting at the &lt;a href=\"Redwood%20Lights%20Track\"&gt;Redwood Lights Track&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt; because he's the only person Lamar can really trust with this.\nAs Lamar drives, he explains that he wants Franklin to oversee the deal from high above in a nearby construction crane to back him up, just in case. He reveals the celebrity to be \"America's lifeguard\", actor &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Boston\"&gt;Jimmy Boston&lt;/a&gt;, and believes that his celebrity endorsement would definitely make the LD Organics brand into a big thing, but Franklin also points out that Jimmy is also a prominent member of the &lt;a href=\"Epsilon%20Program%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Epsilon Program&lt;/a&gt;. Franklin warns Lamar of the risks of dealing with such famous people and tells him to be careful of \"them Kifflom freaks\" but Lamar downplays it. As they are about to reach the construction site, to Franklins' incredulity, Lamar reveals that for self-promotion he posted a selfie of himself at the meeting point as his \"top-secret location\" on &lt;a href=\"Snapmatic\"&gt;Snapmatic&lt;/a&gt;.\nLamar drops off Franklin before reaching the meeting point and a grumbling Franklin climbs the crane and pulls out a scoped &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper\"&gt;Heavy Sniper&lt;/a&gt; rifle, while Lamar meets up with Jimmy and his assistant, &lt;a href=\"Marnie%20Allen\"&gt;Marnie Allen&lt;/a&gt;. The Epsilonists are pleased with the commercial potential of Lamar's business and compliment him on it, but they propose something they believe will make it even better. Marnie shows Lamar a photoshopped concept image of the van on a tablet: instead of just endorsing LD Organics, Jimmy wants to promote Lamar's weed as \"Boston Bakes\" with Jimmy's face on it instead, to effectively be Jimmy's own brand of weed. Lamar is annoyed at seeing this as he obviously wanted to spread his own brand name and the fact that the two Epsilonists thought he would be fine with it. Lamar argues that it's his brand as without his product there's nothing to promote, but Jimmy is certain that without his name recognition, Lamar's business is \"dead in the water\". Watching the conversation through the rifle scope as he listens in through Lamar's headset, Franklin calls Lamar aside and warns him not to go through with this deal as the Vinewood elite always try to take away all the recognition. He either accepts Jimmy's money and \"Boston Bakes\" or tells him where to shove it and keep his own brand name; he can't have it both ways.\nAt this point, Franklin suddenly notices a pair of &lt;a href=\"Primo%20Custom\"&gt;Primo Custom&lt;/a&gt;s headed towards the meeting point, identifying the occupants through the scope as &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt; and warns him about it. Lamar immediately tells Jimmy and Marnie to flee while Franklin and Lamar clear the area of incoming Vagos. On wondering how the gang found them again, Franklin irritably realizes that Lamar must have unwittingly tagged his location in the \"top-secret location\" selfie and calls him an idiot. When Franklin notes Jimmy and Marnie getting away safely in the car they came in, Lamar now agrees with him that it was a bad deal and that he refuses to rebrand. The Vagos will arrive first in the aforementioned Primo Customs, and for subsequent waves, they arrive in various &lt;a href=\"Sanchez\"&gt;Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; bikes, two &lt;a href=\"Baller%20LE\"&gt;Baller LE&lt;/a&gt;s with a &lt;a href=\"Technical%20Custom\"&gt;Technical Custom&lt;/a&gt;, and finally in a &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;Frogger&lt;/a&gt; helicopter.\nOnce the area is cleared, Lamar has Franklin return to his van and starts driving back to LD Organics. Franklin questions if they're going to talk about what just happened, but Lamar defends that the Snapmatic selfie was him simply trying to get the word out for his business and that he's learned now how celebs are selfish, and that an illegal business doesn't just turn legal overnight.\nAlong the way they encounter the rest of the Vagos in several Primo Customs, &lt;a href=\"Voodoo%20Custom\"&gt;Voodoo Custom&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Moonbeam%20Custom\"&gt;Moonbeam Custom&lt;/a&gt;s, while the van starts burning, causing both of them to get high while driving. Initially, they assume that the smell is coming from someone smoking nearby and that the entire city has the smell, but Franklin then realises that it's the van's bodywork on fire. They manage to fight off the Vagos while initially trying to get back to Lamar's warehouse, however, it becomes clear to Lamar that the van won't make it that far.\nLamar, seeing an opportunity, decides to drive the van down &lt;a href=\"Eclipse%20Boulevard\"&gt;Eclipse Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; and park beside &lt;a href=\"Tequi-la-la\"&gt;Tequi-la-la&lt;/a&gt;, where the billboards for &lt;a href=\"ROSAL%C3%8DA\"&gt;ROSAL\u00cdA&lt;/a&gt; are concentrated and let the van continue burning, salvaging the situation as a publicity stunt and let the resulting crowds experience for themselves how great his product is. However, as Lamar is high at the wheel, he can't stop the van in time and ends up crashing it against the corner wall of the club. As people start coming out to see what the noise was and Franklin checks that Lamar is okay, they start feeling the effects of the burning weed and the gathering crowd starts enjoying it. At one onlooker's question of what the van is made of, Lamar introduces the LD Organics brand and starts recommending people pick some up from the city's dispensaries, but then instead invites the crowd to enjoy the high from his burning van for free. A lot of people start taking pictures and Lamar gets the crowd chanting for LD Organics. Lamar then celebrates with Franklin as they both promote the brand.\nFranklin then mentions that he needs to get &lt;a href=\"3671%20Whispymound%20Drive\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Tanisha%20Jackson\"&gt;Tanisha&lt;/a&gt; for a family activity, and after a short banter with Lamar offering Franklin an \"internship\" at LD Organics should he ever need it, Franklin walks away down the street in style as a firetruck and ambulance arrive on the scene, ending the mission."}

Lamar attempts to make his own rap using the backing track from \"Cutie Pie\" by One Way that DJ Pooh provides him, then the five of them take a smoke of some of Lamar's premium product in the lounge. Before Franklin is about to smoke, Lamar refers to Tanisha getting annoyed if he gets high. Franklin assures that she's cool with such things, but neither does she have to know if it's not necessary. When Franklin and Lamar checks out on their partners however, they become so high that they are \"experiencing an out-of-body experience\".\nLamar then pulls Franklin out to deal with some business and they ask DJ Pooh to look after his partners for them. Franklin and Lamar travel with &lt;a href=\"Chop\"&gt;Chop&lt;/a&gt; in Lamar's green &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20%28car%29\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"LD%20Organics\"&gt;LD Organics&lt;/a&gt; to restock his weed supply. When they reach the warehouse, Lamar realizes that the warehouse is being raided by the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos&lt;/a&gt; and both fight the gang. Franklin is armed with a &lt;a href=\"Pistol\"&gt;Pistol&lt;/a&gt; and Lamar has a &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Pistol\"&gt;Combat Pistol&lt;/a&gt;. Both players are able to pick up &lt;a href=\"Micro%20SMG\"&gt;Micro SMG&lt;/a&gt;s dropped by the Vagos. Chop chases down and bites the last Vago outside and leads the two to enter the warehouse where a few more Vagos are encountered. After dealing with them, there will be additional ammo, a Micro SMG and a &lt;a href=\"Tec-9\"&gt;Machine Pistol&lt;/a&gt;,\nThey go outside to check on Lamar's delivery &lt;a href=\"Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; as it is loaded with half of his current stock, only just in time to see it being driven off but as it was following the stop signs and traffic lights, they're able to catch up to it on foot. At Lamar's suggestion, they climb in the back of the truck with the &lt;a href=\"Vagos%20Driver\"&gt;Vagos Driver&lt;/a&gt; being none the wiser. However, both of them start bickering, alerting the driver to their presence and he calls in a Vagos hit squad to shoot at them as it travels north. Realizing they have been discovered, the pair throw open the back doors and fire back with automatic weapons that Lamar had kept stashed in the truck, against stationary Vagos members near &lt;a href=\"Voodoo%20Custom\"&gt;Voodoo Custom&lt;/a&gt;s, and pursuing Vagos members in &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer%20Custom\"&gt;Buccaneer Custom&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"BF-400\"&gt;BF400s&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Speedo%20Custom\"&gt;Speedo Custom&lt;/a&gt; armed with a remote .50 Cal machine gun. Eventually, the truck reaches an alleyway behind &lt;a href=\"Blarneys%20World%20of%20Awesome\"&gt;Blarneys World of Awesome&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vinewood\"&gt;Downtown Vinewood&lt;/a&gt;, which the duo leave the truck and go after the Vagos driver.\nMore Vagos members are encountered here, but the players are now armed with &lt;a href=\"AK-47\"&gt;Assault Rifle&lt;/a&gt;s and submachine guns along with their pistols, and after the Vagos are defeated, the driver, who had climbed up to the rooftops, is killed and the players take back the keys to the truck. They return to the truck: Franklin is concerned with the truck's condition as the engine is smoking, but Lamar believes it should be fine and insists on sharing a free blunt with Franklin before he needs to get home. Just then, Franklin's concern is validated when the truck violently explodes due to the gunfire it has sustained along the way, right in front of them. As Franklin gives his condolences and simply notes they'll have to smoke some other day, Lamar, furious with the loss of his stock, walks off with Franklin to end the mission."}

This is evident by the standard neon body kit, low-profile design and wheels of identical size. Furthermore, as implied by its name, some design influences are also derived from the futuristic bike owned by Shotaro Kaneda in the Japanese manga and film, \"\"; these influences include the circular panelling over the center of the wheels and fully exposed tires, if the mudguards have been removed.\nThe vehicle is depicted as a high-end sports bike with a seemingly rounded bodywork. The front section features a large mudguard with circular hubs attached to the forks, while the upper area has a small rounded fairing with a single circular headlight and two independent handlebars mounted on the upper plate, but lacks any form of dials. The main body is relatively large, featuring a mostly-covered engine bay with a tall intake on the front and a large fuel tank, as well as foot pegs for the rider and a single short exhaust on the right. The rear section consist of a small tail with a grey seat above and a small tail light on the end. The rear wheel is connected to the rest of the vehicle by a dual-sided swingarm, also featuring a large mudguard with circular hubs and dual suspension springs with shock reservoirs. Unlike most motorcycles, the Shotaro does not have any visible primary drive.\nThe Shotaro features a secondary color that glows, being much more visible at night. The glow behaves similarly to neon lights, albeit on the body of the vehicle instead of underneath it. When the bike moves, dark lines can be seen moving under the glowing secondary color over each mudguard, creating a pulsing effect that increases in speed with the bike's acceleration. Although mostly covered, the portions around the wheel hubs can support a dedicated wheel color, which can be painted by selecting a custom rear wheel, applying a color and change back to the stock wheel (as it won't reset to the default alloy color).\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Shotaro boasts an incredible overall performance befitting its price tag, making it competitive with several other high-end sports bikes. It has an extremely high top speed, marginally surpassing the &lt;a href=\"Hakuchou%20Custom\"&gt;Hakuchou Drag&lt;/a&gt;, while its acceleration and brakes are also lightning fast, as the user can easily take off just as fast as coming to a full stop. Its high acceleration and traction also allow it to hug the ground while driving at high speeds, and lets the bike climb steep hills very easily, though this makes the Shotaro poor for stunt jumps since it will not gain much air time. \nHandling wise, the Shotaro has sharp handling at low speeds, great handling around curves, and is able to temporarily perform wheelies at low speeds, though it is very ineffective for lengthy wheelies due to its high speed. It loses some maximum speed while offroad, but otherwise still handles very well, though its high speed and low air time means it is prone to getting shunted by small bumps offroad and causing the user to crash.\nFor all its perks, the Shotaro does have one notable drawback: it is terrible at handling bodies of water, as it will cease to function if it drives into water as shallow as that of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Storm%20Drain\"&gt;Los Santos Storm Drain&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shotaro is powered by an engine whose model is similar to bikes like the &lt;a href=\"PCJ%20600\"&gt;PCJ 600&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ruffian\"&gt;Ruffian&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nemesis\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;. However, it lacks any indication of its exact configuration. It is coupled to a 6-speed gearbox and its sound is relatively mid-revving and loud, also shared with the &lt;a href=\"Vortex%20%28motorcycle%29\"&gt;Vortex&lt;/a&gt;.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nWhen purchasing a Shotaro, the default color options available on &lt;a href=\"Legendary%20Motorsport\"&gt;Legendary Motorsport&lt;/a&gt; will apply slightly different colors compared to regular vehicles, due to the bike's lighting design."}

It is simply referred to as the Shotgun in the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; titles. It is manufactured by in and by &lt;a href=\"Shrewsbury\"&gt;Shrewsbury&lt;/a&gt; in and .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto 2\".\nThe shotgun in \"Grand Theft Auto 2\" is used by &lt;a href=\"Special%20Agents\"&gt;Special Agents&lt;/a&gt; and members of the &lt;a href=\"Zaibatsu%20Corporation\"&gt;Zaibatsu Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (in the &lt;a href=\"Residential%20District\"&gt;Residential District&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Mafia%20%28GTA%202%29\"&gt;Russians&lt;/a&gt; if their hatred towards the player is high enough. The shotgun bears some resemblance to a Mossberg 500 with a pistol grip and no stock.\n3D Universe.\nIn \"Grand Theft Auto III\", the shotgun's in-game model is a , with a Police Folding Stock. While obscured in , the shotgun icon from\"GTA III\" was reused for \"GTA Advance\", implying that the shotgun in \"GTA Advance\" is similar to that of \"GTA III\". For (where it is known as the \"Chrome Shotgun\") and , it resembles a wooden Ithaca 37. For and , it appears to be a break-action double-barreled shotgun. However, it functions like a normal pump shotgun.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn , the Pump Action Shotgun is an Ithaca Model 37 Stakeout, though is based on the Auto Hardball Model 870 Airsoft variant. Its design is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Stubby%20Shotgun\"&gt;Stubby Shotgun&lt;/a&gt;. The shotgun holds eight shells, despite the real-life inspiration only capable of holding four, due to the tube's length.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\".\nThe Shotgun, based on its &lt;a href=\"Heads-Up%20Display\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; icon, combines the general appearance of the \"GTA IV\" iteration, with the wooden detailings of the 3D Universe ones.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Pump Action Shotgun in and is modeled after the , with several modified parts such as the pistol grip housing that accepts AR-15 pistol grips, and the stock that accepts M4-styled stocks, which in this case, is the Magpul MOE stock.\nThe weapon is reminiscent of the &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Shotgun\"&gt;Combat Shotgun&lt;/a&gt; from , as both have pistol grips and features M4-styled stocks. Its pump handle features Picatinny rails on the sides for &lt;a href=\"attachments\"&gt;attachments&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nA unique quality attributed to the shotgun is that it fires several projectiles at once, and at close range two accurate spreads will destroy most non-bulletproof vehicles. The shotgun pellets can also knock down enemies. A large disadvantage with this shotgun is that the player cannot run with it (however, that is not the case in the \"Stories\" games). Also, the pump mechanism has a rather slow rate of fire, so it cannot be used effectively against multiple enemies.\nBeing a powerful weapon yet easy to obtain, it is one of the best weapons as a start-up.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Pump Shotgun is generally slower to use compared to the Combat Shotgun and takes some time for pumping the weapon (roughly 1.5 seconds). However, it is more powerful than the former; it can kill any target with one shot (even fully healthy, fully armored ones at point blank). This is a one-hit kill at close range on any part of the body. Its range is slightly lower than the Combat Shotgun and holds eight shells.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nBeing a standard-issue weapon for the law enforcement, the Pump Shotgun has balanced stats to make it ideal for close-quarter encounters, having good damage, decent accuracy and low fire rate, as well as short range. The weapon performs very good at early stages of the game, but it is easily outclassed by other shotguns, especially in terms of firepower.\nBeing a standard shotgun, it has fewer attachment options; a flashlight that provides illumination over dark areas and a suppressor, which reduces noise at the expense of lower damage.\nLocations.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"3D%20Universe\"&gt;3D Universe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Police%20Car\"&gt;Police Car&lt;/a&gt;s will have a shotgun with five rounds in them, which is added to the player's arsenal once they enter the vehicle. In \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", Police Cars will instead contain a Combat Shotgun.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and \"Episodes from Liberty City\".\nGeneral\n&lt;a href=\"Dukes\"&gt;Dukes&lt;/a&gt; \n&lt;a href=\"Bohan\"&gt;Bohan&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Alderney\"&gt;Alderney&lt;/a&gt; "}

Usually, shotguns are fed with s, which contains various spherical pellets, creating the effect of dispersion in every shot.\nMost shotguns are firearms, which are characterized by the pump handle/forend and the sound they make after each shot, as they eject the spent shell and chamber a new one in the barrel.

To retaliate, the Sicilians attempted to intimidate the &lt;a href=\"Miles%20O%27Donovan\"&gt;mayor&lt;/a&gt; into convicting Leone on racketeering charges. This strategy was never fully executed due to the fact that Cipriani, under orders from Salvatore, &lt;a href=\"The%20Sicilian%20Gambit\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Massimo%20Torini\"&gt;Massimo Torini&lt;/a&gt;.

During the event, the player can encounter one or multiple UFOs appearing in the sky between 10 PM and 4 AM in-game time around various locations in the state of &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe locations and amount of UFOs change every day. Player can photograph &lt;a href=\"UFOs\"&gt;UFOs&lt;/a&gt; every in-game day and send them to &lt;a href=\"Omega\"&gt;Omega&lt;/a&gt; to earn &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;15,000 and 1000&lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;RP&lt;/a&gt;. An additional bonus of $100,000 will be given upon collecting 26 normal UFOs photographs. This will also unlock three variants of the Believe Cap. \nThe event consists of three Stages. The first stage will last for the first twelve real-life days. During the first stage of the event, a single UFO can be seen in the skies of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt;, with the only exception being the 9th day that features two UFOs, one of them being the Zancudo model of UFO near &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt;. Collecting a photograph of a Zancudo model of a UFO will reward $50,000 instead of $15,000.\nThe second stage will last for four real-life days. In the second stage of the event, multiple UFOs can be seen in the skies of Los Santos or Blaine County.\nDuring both Stage 1 and 2 (and to a degree in Stage 3), If the player gets too close to the UFO, thunder accompanied by a lightning bolt will light up the sky and the UFO will disappear. If the player is inside a vehicle, the engine will turn off for a moment and the radio will receive static interference (sometimes also randomly switching between stations). Prior to the start of Stage 3, the first twelve UFO locations will all appear at least twice \u2013 with the exception of Location 4 (over &lt;a href=\"El%20Gordo%20Lighthouse\"&gt;El Gordo Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;) which occurs only once.\nIn the third stage, the last of the event, fourteen more UFOs can be seen in the skies of Los Santos (the first twelve no longer spawn). A few hours before the spawn of the UFOs, the entire state of San Andreas will also be tinted a different color (the effect is also visible within buildings). The UFOs also arrive earlier and depart later than the previous stages. Differently from the previous stages, if the player gets too close to a UFO, it won't disappear; instead, if the player sets foot in the beam of light, they will be abducted, then wake up somewhere else wearing only the UFO Boxer Shorts (plus bra if a female character), which will be unlocked in both green and white. However, this primarily appears to happen when the player is on foot; driving or flying near the UFO can still be hazardous, making air travel around Los Santos a danger during this stage. Entering the beam may require climbing to/landing on rooftops in some cases. The abduction sequence can be repeated, but the player will actually be wasted in the process, though they will still respawn in another location wearing the shorts.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Halloween%202023%20%28Week%202%29\"&gt;2023 event&lt;/a&gt;, the player could unlock the same rewards from the 2022 event plus a new reward, and there is a 25% chance the player can get abducted to the secret &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zancudo\"&gt;Fort Zancudo&lt;/a&gt; Bunker, waking up on a research table during the 3rd and final stage.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Halloween%202024%20%28Week%202%29\"&gt;2024 event&lt;/a&gt;, the player can unlock the same rewards from the 2023 event plus a new reward, and there is a 50% change they can get abducted to the secret Fort Zancudo Bunker, waking up on a research table during the 3rd and final stage, only this time they can move around inside and need to find a way to escape. To unlock the reward the player has to find the crowbar and look for a crate. When the player opens it the first time, they will find &lt;a href=\"The%20Shocker\"&gt;The Shocker&lt;/a&gt; inside. Every subsequent time, there will be $25,000 (or $2,000 if the player opens it again within 60 minutes) and 1,000 RP. To escape from the lab they must pull four levers in the right order \u2013 this is random. Each lever is marked with its unique symbol. The order is determined by the number of times these symbols appear in the lab; they can show up on crates, laptops, televisions or weapons. Escaping will be rewarded with $25,000 and 1,000 RP. After ten minutes or three failed attempts with the levers, the lab will be filled with gas and the player will pass out and spawn outside at a random location.\nLocations.\nCalendar.\nEnable Desktop View to see the calendar.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nNovember 2024=\nOctober 2024=\nOctober 2023=\nOctober 2022=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

They will be marked for a short period again after collecting the second package and/or if they idle for too long.\nOnly the VIP/CEO of the &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organization&lt;/a&gt; can complete the hack and see the location of each package, meaning Bodyguards/Associates can only provide defense for the VIP/CEO. If the leader is killed by another player (killing themselves does not count), the mission is failed.\nCollecting the final package when the timer shows less than 5 minutes will award the player, and any bodyguards in the organization, the highest amount obtainable, $25,000.\nPackage Locations.\nThere are 78 different package locations scattered around the map, and a random three will be chosen during the mission. There is no minimum distance which these must be apart, so they can potentially spawn near each other.\nHowever, the three locations will always be located either in &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County&lt;/a&gt; or in the city of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;; unlike &lt;a href=\"Headhunter\"&gt;Headhunter&lt;/a&gt;, it doesn't appear to matter where the player is located when the mission is triggered.

However, pointing the gun at innocent pedestrians will cause them to raise their arms in surrender, as normal, and then to run away. Additionally, aiming the weapon near or in front of an &lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20Police%20Department%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;police officer&lt;/a&gt; will still attract their attention, and will immediately gain a &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20Level%20in%203D%20Universe\"&gt;wanted star level&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\nThe Silenced Pistol is visually a Colt M1911A1 with an attached suppressor, but functions overall like a Glock 17. It uses special 9mm rounds of which it holds 17 per magazine similar to the regular Pistol.\nPerformance.\nThe weapon is fired from a proper two-handed stance to improve accuracy, eliminating the ability to dual-wield this weapon. Rounds also do more damage to targets taking about two to three shots to kill regular pedestrians, beat cops and most in-mission targets, while the usual pistol takes four shots for the same, which is accurate based on real suppressors, as they increase bullet velocity and hence kinetic energy, albeit not to a significant extent.\nFire rate is also decreased to increase the accuracy of the weapon. The weapon can also replace the &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Eagle\"&gt;Desert Eagle&lt;/a&gt; in many situations with 10 extra rounds, increased fire rate, and slightly weaker damage compensated through stealth. The damage per shot is 40, which proportionizes the slower reload of the Desert Eagle.\nDepending on the weapon skill, some of the weapon's attributes change:"}

The player still needs to deal with the wanted level, but will then have a choice of taking the vehicle to Simeon's warehouse or the drop-off point for Exotic Exports; the vehicle must still be resprayed for Simeon, but does not need to be for Exotic Exports.\nVehicles.\nThe vehicles on the list and process for respraying will differ depending on the version of the game the player is using.\nEnhanced Version and later (PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S).\nThe (v1.51) in August 2020 changed both the vehicle lists and the respray process. Prior to this, the lists and process were the same as shown below for the previous version of the game.\nThe lists only contain one or two cars that are normally able to be kept, and higher value vehicles that are normally \"too hot\" to take into &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt; are now included, but these can still not be kept as &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicles\"&gt;Personal Vehicles&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon taking a vehicle to respray, players are required to repair any damage, however any repair costs incurred will be reimbursed on successful delivery. Players are then only given the option to respray the vehicle and the respray cost is free, no matter what paint options are selected.\nRewards.\nSuccessful delivery is rewarded with a cash payment of 15% of the retail value of the vehicle up to a maximum limit of $20,000, plus reimbursement for any repair costs incurred at Los Santos Customs prior to getting the vehicle resprayed, less any damage incurred between Los Santos Customs and the garage at Terminal. If additional (co-operative) players who have an active list containing the same model vehicle are in the vehicle when it is delivered, the payout will be split evenly between each occupant and their lists will be deemed completed.\nSome of the vehicles may be found in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs%23Pre-modified\"&gt;pre-modified form&lt;/a&gt; (e.g. Surano, Comet, Infernus and Super Diamond. Note: The pre-modified Dubsta2 does not count as a Dubsta for the order), and these pre-modified examples can now be taken into Los Santos Customs to be resprayed and exported. However, the pre-modified Comet and Surano do not pay any more than a stock version, and the stock Infernus and Super Diamond both already exceed the $20,000 limit.\nOriginal Version (PlayStation 3, Xbox 360).\nThis list and process was removed from the &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Version\"&gt;Enhanced Version&lt;/a&gt; in the update in August 2020 and replaced by the list above. It remained applicable to the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt; platforms until their access to \"GTA Online\" was removed in December &lt;a href=\"2021\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;. Information is retained for historical reference.\nMost of the vehicles will be able to be found driving around in traffic but a few of the less common (e.g. the &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;Tailgater&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bagger\"&gt;Bagger&lt;/a&gt;) will be more commonly found parked in one of the specific spawn points used by the High Priority Vehicle job described below. The player can not use a &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicle\"&gt;Personal Vehicle&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. one fitted with a tracker) to fulfill a Simeon order, however a requested vehicle can be kept as a Personal Vehicle by taking it into the player's own garage instead of delivering it. Prior to title updates adding some of rarely spawning vehicles to the websites for purchase, Simeon's list was the only method to obtain vehicles like the Tailgater as a Personal Vehicle.\nAny damage incurred prior to the respray will have to be repaired but will be reimbursed to the player on delivery.\nPlayers only need to respray the primary color. There is no need to respray a secondary color if the vehicle has that option. Modifying parts or performance of the vehicle at LSC will not result in an increased payout over the amount spent and will normally result in a net loss. Expensive paint will not return more than the cheapest paint, so players should spend no more than $780 (excluding any initial repair costs). The value does not increase if the stolen vehicle was pre-modified (e.g. gang variant &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer%23Gang%20Variants\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt;, and two pre-modified vehicles: &lt;a href=\"Dominator\"&gt;Dominator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20XS\"&gt;Sentinel XS&lt;/a&gt;) when that model is requested.\nHigh Priority Vehicle Requests.\nNote: High Priority Vehicle events were removed from the in the &lt;a href=\"Freemode%20Events%20Update\"&gt;Freemode Events Update&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring Free Mode sessions, occasionally all players will be advised that there is a special \"High Priority\" vehicle wanted at the import/export dock.\nThe vehicle will be one from the same list of possible import/export vehicles above. This vehicle will be parked in one of 10 specific spawn spots:\nThe spot will be marked on every player's map with a green vehicle shaped icon and will be able to be selected on the player's &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe process of retrieval, police evasion, respray and delivery of the High Priority Vehicle follows exactly the same as the normal export vehicles.\nHowever, whenever any player enters the vehicle, every other online player in the session will receive a notification message advising them that the player has taken the High Priority Export vehicle. The green icon continues to display on every players' map until it is successfully delivered. As a result, every player is able to compete for the delivery of the vehicle to the garage.\nA High Priority vehicle attracts a higher premium than if it were found on the normal export list, which in turn commands a higher premium than the price offered at Los Santos Customs.\nUnlike the normal export list vehicles, the High Priority Export vehicles are unable to be kept by the player as a &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Vehicles\"&gt;personal vehicle&lt;/a&gt;."}

His car dealership business, however, is crooked. He sells cars to people who cannot afford them and then repossesses them via shady finance schemes and other unorthodox methods. He seems to be employing certain management strategies to make the repossession scheme more efficient, such as cutting the cost from the employee's paychecks if the repossessed car is damaged or naming a successful associate employee of the month.\nIn the liberal atmosphere of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt;, he has learned to use his ethnicity to his advantage and accuse anyone who gives him any sort of bother of being racist.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" in 2013.\nSimeon makes an appearance at the beginning of the events of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" in &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, and gives the &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;\"GTA Online\" Protagonist&lt;/a&gt; a few repossession jobs to do as he considers them to be in his debt after giving them free upgrades to their car at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;. The player can get messages about &lt;a href=\"Simeon%27s%20Export%20Requests\"&gt;vehicle thefts to order&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Free%20Mode\"&gt;Free Mode&lt;/a&gt;, requiring the player to deliver certain vehicles to his &lt;a href=\"Simeon%27s%20Delivery%20Garage\"&gt;garage&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nAt some point in 2013, Simeon has employed &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt; as repo men (his only employees alongside his unseen nephew, &lt;a href=\"Sacha%20Yetarian\"&gt;Sacha&lt;/a&gt; and his two security guards). He is first seen making a sale to &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Jimmy De Santa&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0After naming Franklin \"Employee of the Month\", he sends Franklin and Lamar into &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Vagos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Vagos-controlled&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Beach\"&gt;territory&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Repossession\"&gt;repossess&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Bagger\"&gt;motorbike&lt;/a&gt;. After a shootout with Vagos gang members, Lamar decides to keep the bike. Simeon subsequently accuses Franklin of having stolen it, and orders him to &lt;a href=\"Complications\"&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"BeeJay%20XL\"&gt;yellow SUV&lt;/a&gt; that had been sold to Jimmy.\nAlthough Franklin recovers the SUV, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Michael De Santa&lt;/a&gt;, who saw him coming and hid in the back seat, ambushes him and holds him at gunpoint. Michael informs Franklin that Jimmy couldn't have problems yet since he only just got the car and accuses Simeon of running credit fraud. He forces Franklin to drive the SUV through the window of Simeon's dealership at gunpoint; Michael reimburses Franklin and assaults Simeon. Following this, Simeon fires both Franklin and Lamar.\nSimeon will appear one last time in the storyline, during his own &lt;a href=\"Random%20Events%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;random event&lt;/a&gt;, Simeon Yetarian. The random encounter will happen if either Michael or Franklin enter his shop in the time between \"&lt;a href=\"Friend%20Request\"&gt;Friend Request&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Philips\"&gt;Mr. Philips&lt;/a&gt;\". If either of them do this, they will be treated as hostiles and two men will try to execute them, prompting Michael/Franklin to kill the guards in order to survive. Simeon can be killed during this event. After setting his guards on either Franklin or Michael, he will either run out of the shop or cower and hide in his office, where he can be confronted and killed or let go, though he still posts &lt;a href=\"Bleeter\"&gt;Bleeter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader\"&gt;Lifeinvader&lt;/a&gt; messages until the end of the main storyline, which means that the &lt;a href=\"canon\"&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt; choice is to spare him. This random encounter will be his final physical appearance in the storyline.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nAfter Hours.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2018\"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, Simeon appears during a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Business%20Battles\"&gt;Business Battle&lt;/a&gt;, cowering within the office after the player breaks entry, although the room doesn't have to be visited. A grey &lt;a href=\"Ellie\"&gt;Ellie&lt;/a&gt; is stolen by the protagonist. This also confirms that his \"optional death\" in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" was not &lt;a href=\"canon\"&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt;.\nArena War.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2019\"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;, Simeon has &lt;a href=\"Premium%20Deluxe%20Repo%20Work\"&gt;new jobs&lt;/a&gt; for the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist in April/May &lt;a href=\"2019\"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;, and tells them that he will be the new employee of the month, and later, when the protagonist &lt;a href=\"Repo%20-%20Do%20You%20Even%20Lift%3F\"&gt;delivers multiple vehicles&lt;/a&gt; to him with the use of a &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt;, that they are employee of the year.\nThe Contract.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2021\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;, Simeon is referenced by &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt; while he and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt; are smoking in the &lt;a href=\"Record%20A%20Studios\"&gt;Record A Studios&lt;/a&gt;'s smoking room and Lamar asks Franklin if he'd spoken with Simeon recently.

Theodore Bickford is not actually present though and his part is being filled by an understudy dressed in black to be digitally edited out. Solomon posts on Bleeter about the filming.\n&lt;a href=\"Legal%20Trouble\"&gt;Later&lt;/a&gt;, Michael is surprised to find &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt; and his assistant &lt;a href=\"Molly%20Schultz\"&gt;Molly Schultz&lt;/a&gt; in Solomon's office. Devin proceeds to explain that, being one of the two shareholders (the other being Solomon Richards' \"idiot\" son) in Richards Majestic Productions, he plans to pull the plug on the movie in order to receive a massive insurance payout. With that money, he will pay off Solomon's son to agree to tear the film lot down in order for Devin to build condos, tax free. Solomon feigns to protect a physical movie reel print of the film which is then snatched by Molly who escapes with it, pursued by Michael. They reach &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;the airport&lt;/a&gt; where Molly runs into a jet engine in her panic, drops the film canister and is killed. Michael retrieves it and escapes the police attention, later learning from Solomon that the entire episode was needless as the film was shot digitally and there was no such thing as a master print of it.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;film's premiere&lt;/a&gt;, sponsored by &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank\"&gt;Maze Bank&lt;/a&gt; and covered by &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt;, Michael is cryptically informed by Devin that he has sent &lt;a href=\"Merryweather\"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/a&gt; to attempt to murder &lt;a href=\"Amanda%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Amanda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tracey%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Tracey&lt;/a&gt; in retaliation for the death of Molly Schultz. Michael and &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Jimmy&lt;/a&gt; arrive just in time to save the women. If Michael calls Solomon after the conclusion of this mission, Solomon will quote a line from the film: \"Capitalism depends on one thing and one thing only: a steady supply of idiots.\" For the first time, Michael does not recognize the movie quote as he never got to watch Meltdown at the premiere due to Devin Weston\u2019s actions.\nIf the player chooses option C (the &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;Deathwish ending&lt;/a&gt;), Michael receives a phone call after the mission during which Solomon thanks Michael for his assistance and tells him that the film received mixed reviews but that it has become the biggest box office hit of his career. Solomon will also post to Bleeter that he would like to make a sequel.\nMuch of the film uses footage from \"GTA IV\". The graphics remain similar; however, the render distance, lighting and reflections have seemingly been tweaked to replicate those of \"GTA V\".\nOne scene of the movie, where the main character is inside his high-rise office in &lt;a href=\"Algonquin\"&gt;Algonquin&lt;/a&gt;, is clearly filmed inside the &lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;IAA&lt;/a&gt; office interior, with the Algonquin backdrop edited in. Several other scenes are green-screened footage of driving through Algonquin, with a Banshee edited on top, to give the impression they are driving around.\nAvailability.\nAfter the premiere and its associated &lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt;, the movie will be &lt;a href=\"Movies\"&gt;available to view&lt;/a&gt; in any of the three cinemas between 6 pm and 10 pm.

Not much is known about him, other than he was due to be a major part of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Pacific%20Standard%20Job\"&gt;The Pacific Standard Job&lt;/a&gt;. A texture of Melvin exists in the game files, where he wears a sweater, supporting Lester's description of him, \"he likes sweaters\".\nBeta audio files of a mission involving Melvin exist, under the name \"codice_1\". Lester tells the players they need to find him, as the \"whole operation depends on him\". Melvin uses an encryption device which throws out some phantom readings. As Lester tells the players he doesn't socialise, he tells them they \"might be able to smell him before you can see him\". \nDuring the search for Melvin, Lester attempts to reach out for coordinates of his whereabouts. At one point, Melvin is on a call, making is easier for Lester to track his location. He then sends the players coordinates of the potential spot. Lester pings 3 sets of coordinates, with the third set being the charm.\nAudio files from Melvin himself also exist in the files. These reveal Melvin has the same voice over as &lt;a href=\"Avi%20Schwartzman\"&gt;Avi Schwartzman&lt;/a&gt;, making it clear Melvin was replaced by Avi in-game. These additional audio files mostly consist of himself talking about lab experiments, such as \"Monkey samples\". Others consist of him worrying, very similar to the manners of Avi and his reaction to the player's capturing him.\nPersonality.\nLester describes him as \"paranoid\", claims he doesn't get out much and doesn't socialise much, and that he is very protective of his privacy. Lester likes to think of him as \"like me, but with a hard on for torturing lab rats\", referring to his occupation as a scientist. "}

The upper side of the front, judging by the grille and the rounded lamps, seems to take elements from the aforementioned Hummer H1.\nDesign.\nThe Menacer is distinctive by its boxy design and bulky profile, where the whole front is covered by a black reinforced structure. The lower side of the structure consists of a heavy-duty bumper with angled outer edges, featuring a winch In the center, two small hooks beside the winch, and ridged details near the edges. Right above the outer edges are two large housings, containing the main set of circular headlights and square lamps, the latter stacked in a vertical positioning. The upper side of the structure does not extend further compared to the lower side, which features two rectangular strips, a grille with circular vents, and two smaller high-beam lights. The hood area features an upper reinforced structure with a rectangular vent, which features chrome trim around it, while the rest of it is flat, with elevated borders on the sides and near the windshield.\nOn the sides, the truck features bulky arches and side skirts/steps, together with marker lights and black strips. The doors are relatively thicker in comparison to most cars and feature riveted hinges and black handles. The cabin area makes use of a triangle-shaped windshield that extends further towards the hood area, rectangle-shaped side windows with black trim around them, and black rear-view mirror wings. On the roof, several non-functional lamps can be seen above the windshield, along with an elevated compartment that features additional windows and the corresponding turret section similar to the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up&lt;/a&gt;. The angled sections of the roof are partially occupied by the doors and the exhaust pipes, while the rear angled section of the elevated compartment features a red light strip split into three sections.\nThe rear of the car features an unopenable flat rear compartment with a rectangular window and a single handle, while the outer edges have additional marker lights. Similar to the front end, a black reinforced structure protects the rear end, where the lower section houses a winch in the center, two hooks beside it and a license plate on the passenger side, while the upper section houses circular main tail lights on the edges and the ridged details next to these. The interior of the truck is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent\"&gt;Insurgent&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up\"&gt;armed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up%20Custom\"&gt;variants&lt;/a&gt;, featuring the digital truck dials also derived from various industrial vehicles.\nThe primary color of the vehicle is applied to the main body, while the secondary color is applied to the winch details, front hooks and the rectangular strips on the front structure. The wheels are the same as those from the Insurgent, which also support a color (although only possible in examples spawned in the &lt;a href=\"Content%20Creator\"&gt;Content Creator&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe Menacer is &lt;a href=\"Vehicle%20Features/Mounted%20Weapons\"&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with a set of machine guns mounted next to the rectangular details on the front end, as well as a machine gun turret that resembles a , the latter able to be replaced by a three-barreled .50 caliber &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;Minigun&lt;/a&gt; resembling a gatling gun.\nPerformance.\nVehicle.\nThe Menacer is relatively slow in comparison to the &lt;a href=\"Nightshark\"&gt;Nightshark&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up%20Custom\"&gt;Insurgent Pick-Up Custom&lt;/a&gt;, often struggling to push other vehicles or run them over. The low profile also means it is very limited to drive over small obstacles in comparison to the Insurgent. However, it has enough torque and inital acceleration to propel the driver up on steep hills, and the strong chassis prevents most type of physical collision damage. The wide profile and wheelbase often means it has less chances of flipping over like the Insurgent or the &lt;a href=\"Barrage\"&gt;Barrage&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe vehicle is powered by a diesel engine that is coupled to a 6-speed gearbox and powers all four wheels (with a torque distribution of 40% front and 60% rear), having the same engine sound as the Insurgent. Due to the nature of the vehicle, the hood cannot be opened and there is no engine model whatsoever.\nDefense.\nThe Menacer has fairly strong armor like the &lt;a href=\"Insurgent\"&gt;Insurgent&lt;/a&gt;, as it is able to survive up to seven &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Launcher\"&gt;RPGs&lt;/a&gt;, 22 &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Launcher\"&gt;Homing Missiles&lt;/a&gt; or 19 explosive rounds from the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Sniper%20Mk%20II\"&gt;Heavy Sniper Mk II&lt;/a&gt; before being destroyed with a player inside, and full armor upgrades. However, the armor is still inferior compared to the Insurgent Pick-Up Custom. Its major weak spot is the large frontal windshield; it is not particularly bullet-resistant and so the driver is quite vulnerable to incoming fire, especially when attempting to use the fixed machine guns to attack. The sides and rear are significantly better protected from small arms fire, but with fairly narrow slits in the doors. The gunner is very exposed, having only the turret hatch as a protection against targets from the back and below the gunner's level; the lack of a gunshield means they are quite vulnerable to return fire from their current target. However, similar to the Insurgent Pick-Up and the Custom variant, the gunner is immune to nearby explosions.\nWeaponry.\nThe Menacer is equipped with a set of weapons separated into primary (driver-operated) and secondary (gunner-operated).\n\"GTA Online\" Overview.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nVehicle=\nMachine Gun (front)=\nMachine Gun=\nMinigun=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto Online\".\nThe Menacer can only be modified at a &lt;a href=\"Weaponized%20Vehicle%20Workshop\"&gt;vehicle workshop&lt;/a&gt; inside a &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations%20Center\"&gt;Mobile Operations Center&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen purchased, the Menacer comes painted in the following colors by default:"}

They are featured as the main group of &lt;a href=\"Antagonist\"&gt;antagonists&lt;/a&gt; in \"\".\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThe cartel is led by brothers &lt;a href=\"Diego%20Mendez\"&gt;Diego&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Armando%20Mendez\"&gt;Armando Mendez&lt;/a&gt;, who are of &lt;a href=\"Bolivia\"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt;n descent.\nThe Mendez Cartel members are depicted as wearing suits with light colored shirts underneath, as well as having either a noticeable mustache or ponytail.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories\".\nDuring the storyline, the Mendez Cartel have a big shipment coming in which is stolen by the &lt;a href=\"Vance%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Vance Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; leaders, &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Vance\"&gt;Victor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Vance\"&gt;Lance Vance&lt;/a&gt;. The two mistake the drugs as belonging to &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Martinez\"&gt;Jerry Martinez&lt;/a&gt;, Victor's former sergeant from his brief stint in the army. After learning that the drugs belonged to the Mendez Cartel, the Vance brothers attempt to \"explain themselves\" to Diego and Armando Mendez; Victor and Lance lie by claiming that Martinez stole the drugs, using photos that depict Martinez talking to the feds in order to implicate him.\nAfter successfully completing a number of favors for the Mendez brothers, Victor is put into contact with &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Diaz\"&gt;Ricardo Diaz&lt;/a&gt;, a rival drug baron in the city, through &lt;a href=\"Reni%20Wassulmaier\"&gt;Reni Wassulmaier&lt;/a&gt;, who apparently is an 'item' with Diego Mendez. When the Vance brothers are called over to the Mendez mansion, they are rewarded with a death trap led by Mendez full of explosives. Victor and Lance manage to escape, declaring war on the Mendez Cartel.\nAfter several failed attempts, Armando Mendez &lt;a href=\"Light%20My%20Pyre\"&gt;kidnaps&lt;/a&gt; both Lance and &lt;a href=\"Louise%20Cassidy-Williams\"&gt;Louise Cassidy-Williams&lt;/a&gt;; Armando mortally wounds Louise as Victor makes his way inside the Mendez mansion, confronting and killing a &lt;a href=\"Flamethrower\"&gt;flamethrower&lt;/a&gt;-wielding Armando before attending to Louise during her final moments. Meanwhile, Diego Mendez escapes to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Mendez%20Building\"&gt;Mendez Foundation Building&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Vice%20City%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Downtown&lt;/a&gt;. Victor, with the help of Louise's brother, &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Cassidy\"&gt;Phil Cassidy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Over%20the%20Top\"&gt;breaks into Fort Baxter military base and steals a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;. Later on, he uses it to confront and &lt;a href=\"Last%20Stand\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; the remaining head of the cartel, Diego, along with his men.\nAfter a long and fierce battle, the Hunter is eventually shot down, but Victor manages to crash land it on the roof and survives the ensuing explosion. Forced to search for Diego, he sweeps through the building floor by floor, encountering and killing many of Diego's men before finally reaching his target. In a final confrontation on the roof, Victor Vance, Diego Mendez, and Jerry Martinez find themselves in a Mexican standoff before erupting into a three-way gunfight in which Victor emerges victorious by shooting and killing the other two men. The deaths of Mendez and Martinez creates a power vacuum in the city's drug trade, now open for a new kingpin to establish their own dominance.\nAfterward, the Mendez Cartel quickly crumbles and is non-existent by 1986. The Mendez Cartel's &lt;a href=\"Mendez%20Mansion\"&gt;mansion&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Prawn%20Island\"&gt;Prawn Island&lt;/a&gt; is eventually taken over by the &lt;a href=\"Sharks\"&gt;Sharks&lt;/a&gt; (now known as the Streetwannabe's) sometime between 1984 and 1986, and during that interval the Mendez Building is demolished and replaced by a much smaller building.\nDuring its time of operation, it was the most powerful criminal organization in Vice City. However, when its leaders were killed, the Diaz Cartel quickly seized control of most of the drug trade within the city. The Mendez Cartel members cannot be found on the streets outside of missions."}

Killing a player with a white blip increases the player's mental state more than if the player kills a player with a red blip, however killing a full-red player will not increase the player's mental state. The player receives more &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;RP&lt;/a&gt; for killing players with redder blips.\nThe Mental State has 5 levels/bars just like &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt; with their own designation as listed below:\nMental State\n0-19%: Normal (White to Light pink player blip)\n20-39%:\u00a0Unstable (Light pink to Pink player blip)\n40-59%:\u00a0Deranged (Pink to Light red player blip)\n60-79%:\u00a0Maniac (Light red to Red player blip)\n80-100%: Psychopath (Red to Blood-red player blip)\nDoing a series of &lt;a href=\"Jobs%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;jobs&lt;/a&gt; will lower the player's Mental State, which may be reset to 0 if it falls into the Normal range."}

It is manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Declasse\"&gt;Declasse&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"HD%20Universe\"&gt;HD Universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Merit appears to be based on the with some traits of the .\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20IV\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;\", the Merit is redesigned with a similar look to the , particularly the 2004-2005 SS package (evidenced by the fog lights, wheels and the spoiler), with the back seemingly inspired by the fifth generation , and the tail lights being identical to the ones found on the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/BMW_E36_rear_20070816.jpg/1024px-BMW_E36_rear_20070816.jpg\"&gt;E36 BMW 3 Series&lt;/a&gt;. The front bumper could be derived from a variety of cars, but the headlights and front grille are reminiscent of a .\nDesign.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Merit in \"\" is depicted as a full-sized sedan with a rounded body design. It has medium-sized bumpers, a rectangular grille and wide main lights with small turning lights, in conjunction with silver trim around the windows, square-shaped mirrors and a single exhaust pipe with dual exits on the passenger side. The Merit can spawn in a variety of single colors for the bodywork.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe Merit assumes a modernized design compared to its previous iteration, but retains the overall shape and four-door layout. The front bumper of the car is quite dominated by a rectangular mesh grille, which spans about two-third of the car's width and is partially covered by the license plate on the driver-side half. On each side of the lower grille is an unusable circular fog light, which are almost of the same distance between the upper and lower edges of the bumper, but are closer to the outer edges than to the lower grille. A black/plastic strip runs almost through the whole upper edge of the bumper, leaving a small gap near the front wheel arches. The upper section of the car houses the main grille in the center, which has a curved shape on the lower and side edges. This main grille bears three painted horizontal dividers over a mesh, and a single silver central separation, bearing the Declasse logo. Right beside the main grille are the black headlight units, each one containing dual circular main units and small turn indicators on the outer edges. The hood lid is quite basic in design, but bears two distinctive lines, one starting from each side of the main grille and running towards each edge of the windshield.\nThe sides of the car are relatively basic, featuring flared arches and rectangular skirting areas. Black/plastic strips can be seen running through the doors, which have the same height as the one on the front bumper, while thin accent lines are seen starting near the headlights and running towards the tail lights, passing between the black door handles and the waist lines. The greenhouse area makes use of black trim around the windows and inner separations, together with painted mirror shells on the front doors and rounded rear-quarter windows. A single aerial can be seen on the rear portion of the roof. The trunk lid mounts a small spoiler by default.\nOn the rear, the car makes use of a dedicated section for the license plate and a black/plastic strip above, while additional badges are seen above the aforementioned section and the lower edges of the trunk lid. On the sides of the rear end are large tail lights that are divided into four slots: the upper indicators and lower main units located on the outer edges of the car, and the upper reverse and lower brake units located within the trunk lid. The rear bumper is rather basic in design and bears a black/plastic strip located at the same height as the front and side strips, also leaving small gaps near the rear wheel arches, and a small moulding for the driver-side exhaust.\nThe Merit is seen in a variety of single colors applied to the body, and uses a set of five-spoke rims with thin grooves on each spoke (which seem to be based on American Racing's line of chrome IROC-Z wheel replicas). It is fitted with medium-profile tires with regular tread pattern.\nThe vehicle is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; system with a female voice, but only if the player leaves the \"selected cars\" (default) option in the audio menu.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThis rendition of the Merit is designed as a balanced out performance, having average brake response and cornering, and good acceleration and speed. Coupled with its four-seat capacity, the Merit is practically a good choice for &lt;a href=\"Drive-By%20Shooting\"&gt;drive-bys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Police%20%28law%20enforcement%29\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; evasion, although crash deformation is not impressive. The Merit is a good starting car for new street racers, as it can compare with cars like the &lt;a href=\"Euros\"&gt;Euros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alpha\"&gt;Alpha&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne noticeable trait is that when pushing maximum gas from a standstill, the Merit will wheelspin considerably, for almost the entirety of 1st gear. This trait makes it a reasonable car for drifting.\nThe car is powered by a petrol engine, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in an FR layout. it uses a relatively smooth and mid-revving sound, similar to cars such as the &lt;a href=\"Bravura\"&gt;Bravura&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nebula\"&gt;Nebula&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ZR-350\"&gt;ZR-350&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grand Theft Auto IV\".\nThe \"GTA IV\" rendition of the Merit is powered by a twin-cam Inline-4, mated to a 5-speed transmission in a RWD layout (in contrast with the real-life Chevrolet Impala, which is a FWD car). Acceleration is good, but nothing special, and in line with the Merit's vanilla, everyday sedan image. Braking is very good. The suspension is very firm, keeping the Merit flat through corners, and enabling it to corner effectively at speed. Accident deformation is acceptable, as the Merit will survive a few frontal impacts before being rendered unusable. The Merit seems suited towards any situation; it is capable of high speeds and it seems able to survive a serious car chase, making it a versatile addition to any parking space.\nThe Merit uses a mid-revving engine sound also present on its service variants, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer\"&gt;Buccaneer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Virgo%20Classic\"&gt;Virgo&lt;/a&gt;.\nModifications.\n\"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe Merit can be upgraded at &lt;a href=\"TransFender\"&gt;TransFender&lt;/a&gt;."}

Inside the house, there are various messages left by him. Among them is a message scrawled on a wall. \nThere are further clues, with a mountain shape with what looks like 4 clouds above it, and the repeated pattern of black and white number 8s. A pair of shoes are hanging from the ceiling in the back room and there are what appear to be body parts in preserving jars on a shelf unit.\nAnti-Abrahams graffiti is sprayed on the north wall of the house.\nSome barrels and trash cans around Sandy Shores can be seen with an 8 painted on them in blood.\nOn two rocks in the &lt;a href=\"Senora%20National%20Park\"&gt;Senora National Park&lt;/a&gt;, there are short rhymes left by Abrahams which tell about the 8 people he killed, as well as saying he'll leave a clue where the bodies are. \nInside &lt;a href=\"Bolingbroke%20Penitentiary\"&gt;Bolingbroke Penitentiary&lt;/a&gt;, on the wall of a recreation yard, another phrase can be found written in black ink. \nBelow this message is an improved version of the mountain and \"clouds\" drawing.

The monochrome 8s on the walls in his house correlate to the way the corpses are bound, with the five black 8s relating to the five bound with their hands behind their back, while the three marked with white reflect the 3 corpses bound with their hands in front of them. Note that the &lt;a href=\"Enhanced%20Version\"&gt;Enhanced Version&lt;/a&gt; of \"GTA V\" significantly increases the seabed flora and makes at least two of the corpses very difficult to see compared to the original version on &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt;.\nEight more female bodies appear in the southern waters of &lt;a href=\"Cayo%20Perico\"&gt;Cayo Perico&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" in update, but it is not revealed whether they were the work of Abrahams, a copycat, or are simply an &lt;a href=\"Secrets%20and%20Easter%20Eggs%20in%20GTA%20Online\"&gt;Easter Egg&lt;/a&gt; to the Infinity Killer mystery in \"GTA V\".\nCharacter.\nInfluence.\nAbrahams is similar to , the antagonist of the \"\" slasher film series, in two ways:\nAbrahams use of the infinity sign is reminiscent of the 's sign."}

According to their &lt;a href=\"Websites%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, Merryweather is shown to be operating around the world, including the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, Asia, Africa, &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, South America, and the Middle East.\nMerryweather appears to have several divisions, which are determined by the uniform and equipment they carry:\nThere exists a service announced by Merryweather around the events of the mission &lt;a href=\"Friend%20Request\"&gt;Friend Request&lt;/a&gt;. The service transports art, artifacts, and perishables for museums and collectors. A train belonging to such is attacked by Michael De Santa and Trevor Philips and &lt;a href=\"Derailed\"&gt;derailed&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs for their employees, Merryweather appears to primarily recruit ex-&lt;a href=\"Military\"&gt;Military&lt;/a&gt; operators, ensuring well-skilled mercenaries. They are portrayed as incredibly aggressive and devoid of morals and ethics, happily committing wanton abuse against civilians they deem as a threat, &lt;a href=\"Floyd%20Hebert\"&gt;Floyd&lt;/a&gt; being one notable example.\nInfluence.\nMerryweather is a parody of , formerly known as Blackwater and Xe Services, a private military company infamous for alleged human rights violations during the &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; . Like Academi, Merryweather had changed its name following an incident that resulted in negative public relations. The styling of the name is also derived from Academi's former Blackwater logo.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" (pre-\"GTA V\").\nSometime before the game's start, Merryweather is cleared by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; government to begin operating on U.S. soil, both in service of the government and of other organizations in the private sector. However, it begins experiencing setbacks and problems almost immediately after their clearance.\nDuring the story of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\", Lester instructs &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;the player&lt;/a&gt; to steal &lt;a href=\"A%20Titan%20of%20a%20Job\"&gt;a Titan plane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"By%20Land%2C%20Sea%20and%20Air\"&gt;two Buzzard Attack Choppers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Teaser%20Trailer\"&gt;a secretly-developed electromagnetic weapon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Docks%20to%20Stock\"&gt;a container full of weapons&lt;/a&gt; from Merryweather, to be used for his other, undisclosed projects. Lester also sends the player to steal documentation and cargo guarded by Merryweather on numerous occasions. Underground crime lord &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin Madrazo&lt;/a&gt; has also hired the player to destroy Merryweather equipment.\nHeists Update.\nDuring the events of the &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Raid\"&gt;Humane Raid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Heists\"&gt;Heist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Agent%2014\"&gt;Agent 14&lt;/a&gt; informs the crew that &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Labs%20and%20Research\"&gt;Humane Labs and Research&lt;/a&gt;, which used to be &lt;a href=\"Maxim%20Rashkovsky\"&gt;Maxim Rashkovsky&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dima%20Popov\"&gt;Dima Popov&lt;/a&gt;'s pharma company, was leased to a shadow company a few years ago, run in part by Don Percival. According to his intel, the lab is being used to develop nerve agents, presumably to be used by Merryweather.\nFrom there, the crew &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Raid%20-%20Insurgents\"&gt;is instructed to steal&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=\"Insurgent\"&gt;armored&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Insurgent%20Pick-Up\"&gt;LAPVs&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Davis%20Quartz\"&gt;Davis Quartz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Raid%20-%20Valkyrie\"&gt;take&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;a gunship helicopter&lt;/a&gt; from their &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Naval%20Port\"&gt;headquarters&lt;/a&gt;. The crew also manages to &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Raid%20-%20Deliver%20EMP\"&gt;kill a Merryweather group stealthily to place the EMP in the lab&lt;/a&gt;, to be later triggered in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Humane%20Labs%20Raid\"&gt;heist finale&lt;/a&gt;, only to kill more Merryweather mercenaries to get the data and escape in their stolen gunship (which was later destroyed to get rid off from any evidence).\nThe crew would later encounter Merryweather in one of the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Standard\"&gt;Pacific Standard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Standard%20-%20Convoy\"&gt;setup&lt;/a&gt;, where they have to steal a &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20OL\"&gt;truck&lt;/a&gt; containing the &lt;a href=\"Thermite%20Bomb\"&gt;thermal charges&lt;/a&gt;, evading any of their reinforcements on the way.\nFurther Adventures in Finance and Felony.\nMerryweather is seen again during &lt;a href=\"Special%20Cargo/Steal%20Missions\"&gt;Special Cargo missions&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organizations&lt;/a&gt; steal numerous crates of supplies and weaponry particularly through convoys of &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;helicopters&lt;/a&gt; and hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of damage caused to pursuing &lt;a href=\"Mesa%20Grande\"&gt;units&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Special%20Vehicle%20Work\"&gt;Special Vehicle Work&lt;/a&gt; mission &lt;a href=\"End%20of%20Transmission\"&gt;End of Transmission&lt;/a&gt;, Merryweather was hired by a &lt;a href=\"SecuroServ\"&gt;SecuroServ&lt;/a&gt; client's business partner to get a dark ops transmitter located at the &lt;a href=\"Palmer-Taylor%20Power%20Station\"&gt;Palmer-Taylor Power Station&lt;/a&gt;. However, the client has hired the crew for the same objective, which ultimately managed to defeat Merryweather using a SecuroServ &lt;a href=\"Armored%20Boxville\"&gt;Armored Boxville&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nLater, during the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/a&gt;\", Merryweather suffers many problematic setbacks at the hands of the game's main protagonists, particularly those of &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;. During the game, Merryweather has one of the experimental weapons they were guarding for the U.S. government &lt;a href=\"The%20Merryweather%20Heist\"&gt;stolen&lt;/a&gt;; one of their planes, which was carrying millions of dollars in weaponry, &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Turbulence\"&gt;hijacked and taken down&lt;/a&gt;; one of their courier trains, carrying millions of dollars worth of priceless artifacts, &lt;a href=\"derailed\"&gt;derailed&lt;/a&gt;; dozens of their men killed at a &lt;a href=\"The%20Wrap%20Up\"&gt;massive shootout in the Kortz Center&lt;/a&gt;, dozens of their men killed after an unsuccessful &lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;house invasion&lt;/a&gt;, dozens of their men killed while unsuccessfully attempting to stop a &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;heist at the Union Depository Building&lt;/a&gt; and dozens of their men killed in a &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Banks%20Steel%20Foundry\"&gt;foundry&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;attempting to kill Franklin Clinton, Michael De Santa and Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt;, and major shareholder/chief board member &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt; kidnapped, stuffed into a &lt;a href=\"Tornado\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt;, and rolled off a cliff.\nBy the end of the main storyline, Merryweather's reputation is in shambles after so many catastrophic failures, causing several of their regular clients to drop them from their payroll, including the U.S. government. After losing the government contract, Merryweather loses clearance to operate on American soil and is forced to shut down several operations they'd started in the country, costing them millions of dollars. Don Percival also buys out the majority of Weston's 11% stock in the company after his death.\nIn \"GTA V\", the player can visit their official website, Merryweathersecurity.com. They can also buy their stocks in the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20National%20Exchange\"&gt;Lcn-exchange.com&lt;/a&gt; website.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\" (post-\"GTA V\").\nDespite all the negative setbacks suffered in the past, Merryweather continues to maintain operations in the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20San%20Andreas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;State of San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;. Despite \"GTA V\"s endings stating that Merryweather has lost its license to operate in the United States, they can still be found at the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Naval%20Port\"&gt;Los Santos Naval Port&lt;/a&gt;, and continue to have a major presence in San Andreas in \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20Online\"&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online&lt;/a&gt;\" post-&lt;a href=\"2017\"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;. This may be the result of corruption and bribery from Merryweather to continue operations on American soil, or Merryweather may continue unauthorized operations there regardless. Alternatively, this may simply be an developer oversight. \nAfter the events of the update, Merryweather experiences their original fate, as the US government finally ends their relationship. However, this again seemingly makes no impact on Merryweather's presence in Los Santos, as the organization makes several appearances as enemies in later \"GTA Online\" updates, notably and . As a result, more trouble befalls them at the hands of the player, &lt;a href=\"Organizations\"&gt;Organizations&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Motorcycle%20Clubs\"&gt;Motorcycle Clubs&lt;/a&gt;.\nGunrunning.\nMerryweather again takes a prominent role, where they are seen in most of the &lt;a href=\"Supplies/Steal%20Missions\"&gt;Steal Supplies&lt;/a&gt; missions. The Organizations and Motorcycle Clubs have to steal much of their equipment, so they will be broken down in &lt;a href=\"Bunkers\"&gt;Bunkers&lt;/a&gt; and sold off for profit. They may show off again during &lt;a href=\"Supplies/Sell%20Missions\"&gt;Sell Supplies&lt;/a&gt; missions, where they will attempt to take out the groups for gaining profit with their stolen equipment.\nMerryweather also takes a prominent role on most of the &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Operations\"&gt;Mobile Operations&lt;/a&gt; led by Agent 14, where again they suffer various setbacks, as &lt;a href=\"Severe%20Weather%20Patterns\"&gt;most of their supplies were destroyed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Offshore%20Assets\"&gt;their salvage team on a downed freighter were killed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cover%20Blown\"&gt;failed to destroy a target truck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mole%20Hunt\"&gt;got their signal jammers destroyed and failed to protect an important agent&lt;/a&gt;, and lastly, &lt;a href=\"Data%20Breach\"&gt;failed to secure superbikes with important data&lt;/a&gt;.\nSmuggler's Run.\nMerryweather is seen again during &lt;a href=\"Air%20Freight%20Cargo\"&gt;Air Freight Cargo&lt;/a&gt; missions. Organizations and Motorcycle Clubs continuously thwart their plans by destroying signal jammers, eliminating a bunch of guards on patrol at Humane Labs, or by destroying numerous Merryweather &lt;a href=\"Cargo%20Plane\"&gt;Cargo Plane&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"P-996%20LAZER\"&gt;P-996 LAZER&lt;/a&gt;s in aerial dogfights.\nThe Doomsday Heist.\nMerryweather makes yet another appearance in &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomsday%20Heist\"&gt;The Doomsday Heist&lt;/a&gt;, conducting training and storing high-grade military vehicles such as the &lt;a href=\"Avenger%20%28plane%29\"&gt;Avenger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chernobog\"&gt;Chernobog&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the latter are stolen at the behest of (and later for stopping) &lt;a href=\"Avon%20Hertz\"&gt;Avon Hertz&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey are first encountered during &lt;a href=\"The%20Data%20Breaches\"&gt;The Data Breaches&lt;/a&gt;, assaulting the &lt;a href=\"Satellite%20Relay%20Station\"&gt;Satellite Relay Station&lt;/a&gt;. It is revealed at the end of the mission they were evidently paid off by &lt;a href=\"Bogdan%27s%20Crew\"&gt;Bogdan's Crew&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Act III, they are shown committing more illegal activities, kidnapping &lt;a href=\"Agent%2014\"&gt;Agent 14&lt;/a&gt; and ransoming him off to Avon and then later the &lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;International Affairs Agency&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Hours.\nMerryweather makes a few minor appearances during the &lt;a href=\"Nightclubs/Sell%20Goods\"&gt;Sell Goods&lt;/a&gt; missions where they will attempt to intercept Organizations and Motorcycle Clubs attempting to sell from their &lt;a href=\"nightclubs\"&gt;nightclubs&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Diamond Casino Heist.\nMerryweather appears frequently during the &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20Heist/Preparations\"&gt;preparation missions&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Casino%20Heist\"&gt;The Diamond Casino Heist&lt;/a&gt;, where the player typically has no alternative but to steal items from them to use during the heist.\n&lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; points out that Merryweather , has possession of or , or seeks .\nThe Cayo Perico Heist.\nMerryweather appears frequently during the &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist/Preparations\"&gt;preparation missions&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"The%20Cayo%20Perico%20Heist\"&gt;The Cayo Perico Heist&lt;/a&gt;, where the player can choose to steal items or vehicles from them to use during the heist.\nIt is possible for the player to acquire an approach method from Merryweather by , , or or from their headquarters.\nOne of the preparations also has the player follow a Merryweather &lt;a href=\"Valkyrie\"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt; from their headquarters to a group of Merryweather operatives and an Avenger. The player must kill the operatives, steal the weapons from the Avenger, then parachute out of the Avenger as it lifts off.\nLos Santos Tuners.\nMerryweather makes multiple appearances in the Los Santos Tuners update, specifically in &lt;a href=\"The%20Data%20Contract\"&gt;The Data Contract&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20E.C.U%20Job\"&gt;The E.C.U Job&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the events of The Data Contract, a &lt;a href=\"Avi%20Schwartzman\"&gt;hacker&lt;/a&gt; contacts &lt;a href=\"Moodymann\"&gt;KDJ&lt;/a&gt; to steal some valuable hard drives from Don Percival's &lt;a href=\"Bunkers\"&gt;bunker&lt;/a&gt;. The player first tails a Merryweather &lt;a href=\"Skylift\"&gt;Skylift&lt;/a&gt; leaving the &lt;a href=\"Palmer-Taylor%20Power%20Station\"&gt;Palmer-Taylor Power Station&lt;/a&gt; making a delivery to the bunker. Once at the base, the players take a photo of the bunker entrance before sending it to &lt;a href=\"Sessanta\"&gt;Sessanta&lt;/a&gt;, who will then tell the player to hijack a &lt;a href=\"Barrage\"&gt;Barrage&lt;/a&gt; from Merryweather guards leaving the bunker as it will contain a transponder which will allow for ease of access into the bunker. \nTo defend the hacker while he uploads the hard drives, the player will need to steal as many armaments from Merryweather scattered around Los Santos that they can use to fight back.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"The%20Data%20Contract/Finale\"&gt;finale&lt;/a&gt;, using the equipment salvaged from the previous planning works, the player breaks into the Merryweather bunker and engages in a shootout with multiple operatives while stealing the hard drives. Upon exiting the bunker, the player drives to &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Island\"&gt;Elysian Island&lt;/a&gt; where Avi is holed up. Upon arriving, the player protects Avi as he uploads the hard drives from waves of Merryweather. Upon all the operatives being taken out, Avi and the player will part ways.\nMerryweather will once more become a target during The E.C.U Job, as KDJ has the player steal an engine control unit from a Merryweather &lt;a href=\"Freight%20Train\"&gt;Freight Train&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst, the player must board a Merryweather guarded cargo ship at the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Port of Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; to steal a container manifest and a cutting saw to be used during the heist. \nFollowing this, the player will need to go to the location of the Merryweather freight train at either &lt;a href=\"Palmer-Taylor%20Power%20Station\"&gt;Palmer-Taylor Power Station&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Davis%20Quartz\"&gt;Davis Quartz&lt;/a&gt; in orde to survey it for any vulnerabilities while staying clear of the guards, taking photos of the brake cylinders. Afterwards, the player will be instructed to look for the train schedule located inside a control tower which is heavily guarded by Merryweather operatives.\nUpon completing all of the planning works, the player arrives at the train tracks where the freight train is scheduled to be headed through before destroying the brake cylinders to halt the train in its tracks. The player will then need to board the train, steal the engine control units while fighting off Merryweather, and evade them before delivering it to KDJ.\nThe Contract.\nBy December 2021, Merryweather's stock was still available on the stock market, but it was at an all-time low, along with the company's reputation. A stock insider comes up with a plan to artificially inflate their newly-bought shares in the company to make themselves money.\nThe insider contracts the &lt;a href=\"F.%20Clinton%20and%20Partner\"&gt;F. Clinton and Partner&lt;/a&gt; agency to take care of a group of drug dealers that are selling bad product across Los Santos and making headlines. After the dealers are dealt with in a professional manner, agency co-founder &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; spams &lt;a href=\"Snapmatic\"&gt;Snapmatic&lt;/a&gt; with viral posts claiming he witnessed Merryweather taking down the drug dealers, which increases the company's reputation and thus their stock price. The agency is subsequently paid through the money made from the inflated shares by the insider.\nMerryweather are also planning to commission a new surveillance camera system in Los Santos and the F. Clinton and Partner agency are .\nLos Santos Drug Wars.\nIn 2022, Merryweather forces responded to a break-in at Humane Labs by criminals hired by the &lt;a href=\"Fooliganz\"&gt;Fooliganz&lt;/a&gt; to steal precursor chemicals for an illegal acid ring. The fighting moved out of the Lab and to a derailed Humane Labs train near the &lt;a href=\"Palmer-Taylor%20Power%20Station\"&gt;Palmer-Taylor Power Station&lt;/a&gt;, where Merryweather failed to stop them from stealing even more chemicals and a state of the art &lt;a href=\"Brickade%206x6\"&gt;Brickade 6x6&lt;/a&gt;.\nSan Andreas Mercenaries.\nAs of 2023, private military organizations have regained prominence in San Andreas, and Merryweather seizes the opportunity to enhance their public image. They actively organize large-scale recruitment campaigns, secure government contracts, and engage in illicit activities on the side. In response to this, &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Reed\"&gt;Charlie Reed&lt;/a&gt; unites a diverse group comprising former military personnel, outcasts, mercenaries, and traditional criminals. Together, they form the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Angels\"&gt;Los Santos Angels&lt;/a&gt;, with Charlie selecting the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist as their Team Leader. Charlie declares that their main goal is &lt;a href=\"Project%20Overthrow\"&gt;Project Overthrow&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to eliminate Merryweather.\nDuring the mission &lt;a href=\"Shock%20%26amp%3B%20Awe\"&gt;Shock &amp; Awe&lt;/a&gt;, Charlie reveals that the Los Santos Angels have been contracted by the US government to address the consequences of Merryweather's significant failures. Following the \"GTA Online\" Protagonist's successful capture of &lt;a href=\"Avi%20Schwartzman\"&gt;Avi Schwartzman&lt;/a&gt; from Merryweather forces, Charlie also says, \"Uncle Sam no longer sees Merryweather as a viable business partner.\" In order for the government to maintain plausible deniability, the Angels' objective is to recover the research and development materials the United States had outsourced to Merryweather. Once the classified cargo is retrieved from Merryweather's naval base, it is promptly transported to Fort Zancudo.\nOnce the player has completed the final mission, Charlie will call them with good news. The player is informed by Charlie that the divorce papers between Merryweather and the United States are finalized. A &lt;a href=\"2023\"&gt;decade&lt;/a&gt; after Congress approved their operations on American soil, they are no longer contracted by the government.\nThe Chop Shop.\nDespite their fate, they are shown to still be active as of December 2023. During &lt;a href=\"The%20Duggan%20Robbery\"&gt;The Duggan Robbery&lt;/a&gt;, Jamal informs the Protagonist that Merryweather is developing a , which is required to immobilize and steal the target vehicle. \nDuring &lt;a href=\"The%20Cargo%20Ship%20Robbery\"&gt;The Cargo Ship Robbery&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Skylift\"&gt;Skylift&lt;/a&gt; is required to lift the container. Jamal informs the Protagonist that Merryweather has one and has to fight through them to steal it.\nIn early 2024, an unnamed militia is a potential robbery target for &lt;a href=\"Concealed%20Weapons\"&gt;equipment&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hit%20and%20Run\"&gt;a getaway vehicle&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Scene%20of%20the%20Crime\"&gt;Cluckin' Bell factory raid&lt;/a&gt;. While no overt connections to Merryweather are made, the militia reuse the same members and vehicles as Merryweather.\nServices (\"GTA Online\").\nDespite being adversaries, Merryweather offers multiple services to the \"GTA Online\" protagonist.

This variant features various off-road enhancements such as reinforced bumpers, skid plates, a winch, separate side steps and a full tubular exo-skeleton with a roof rack and high-power lamps on the roof, and the extra front bull bar. The SUV also has sections of the body and wheel arches removed to provide capacity for larger wheels &amp; tires and to allow for greater lateral suspension travel. To afford the SUV water-wading capability, a snorkel has been fitted. Like the regular Mesa, it may spawn with or without a solid roof, although this component is paintable, along with a permanent spare tire over the tailgate.\nThe primary color of the vehicle is applied on the body and the solid roof extra, while the secondary color is applied to the external exo-skeleton, bumpers and the spare wheel's rim. The vehicle shares the wheel design with the &lt;a href=\"Sandking%20XL\"&gt;Sandking XL&lt;/a&gt;, sharing the rim design with the \"Six Gun\" muscle wheels available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerformance.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Merryweather variant is slightly inferior in terms of performance to the standard variant, but makes up for the shortcoming with its improved off-roading capabilities and durability. It is capable of reaching decent top speeds, but its high center of gravity could make it prone to tipping over quite easily, an issue which can easily be rectified by lowering the suspension at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;. It is fairly hard to damage a large amount, due to its protective tubular exoskeleton. Performance-wise, it is equipped with impressive torque, allowing it to climb near-vertical hills, giving it much ability to surpass the standard Mesa.\nDespite featuring a mounted snorkel, the Merryweather variant cannot be submerged in deep water. This is because the exhaust, the game's way of determining whether a vehicle should cut out or not when submerged in water, is beneath the body of the truck and as such, the truck has a very low tolerance of water. The &lt;a href=\"Duneloader\"&gt;Duneloader&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Half-track\"&gt;Half-track&lt;/a&gt; can traverse deep water as the snorkel is considered an exhaust by the game, allowing it to travel deep water without cutting out.\nIt appears to be powered by a V8 engine (as suggested by the engine cover), coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, all wheel drive layout (10%-90%, front to rear torque distribution).\nLocations.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nThe Merryweather variant is only obtainable from the following four missions, and otherwise it never appears during the course of the entire game.

A plastic bumper spans the width of the car, holding a license plate on the center. Chrome \"CANIS\" letterings can be seen embossed above the grille.\nOn the sides, wide arches can be seen above the wheels, protruding from the narrow bodywork of the vehicle. The bottom of the car is fitted with chrome stepsides and two plastic rear-view mirror shells can be seen directly mounted on the front doors, near the A-pillars.\nThe rear of the car is mostly generic, featuring a set of circular tail lights and a rear tailgate that opens toward the passenger side, bearing the same \"CANIS\" chrome lettering and emblem on the center and the black handle on the driver side.

Its stock wheels bear the same rim pattern as the \"Mudslinger\" offroad wheels available in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Customs\"&gt;Los Santos Customs&lt;/a&gt;, but the detail on the center is slightly larger and has more bolt details on the surrounding.\nPerformance.\n3D Universe.\nIn \"GTA Vice City\" and \"GTA San Andreas\", its performance is similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Blista%20Compact\"&gt;Blista Compact&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, due to its light weight and short wheelbase, and it is significantly nimble and possesses above average pickup and torque than speed.

It is powered by a diesel engine, which is large and powerful. The engine has been an inline throughout the 3D universe.\nHowever, in \"GTA Vice City Stories\", the vehicle is now a bit different. It weights a bit more, it has a higher top speed, and is powered by a petrol engine.\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"Online\".\nThe Mesa has an average top speed and good acceleration due to its light weight. However, it has a wide turning radius and needs to be driven moderately. The vehicle performs well off-road due to its full 4WD drivetrain and light weight, and it has excellent torque which allows it to climb very steep hills. Durability is excellent, as the vehicle is able to take considerable abuse from gunfire and collisions before the engine fails. The Mesa is also capable of an impressive amount of momentum once it gathers speed, rivalling larger cars like the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; in its ability to force its way through obstacles and roadblocks.\nIt appears to be powered by a V6, coupled to a 5-speed gearbox in a front engine, all wheel drive layout (10%-90%, front to rear torque distribution).\nVariants.\nSpecial Variants.\nMilitary.\nIn \"GTA San Andreas\" and \"GTA Vice City Stories\", a Mesa depicted to be part of the &lt;a href=\"Military%20%283D%20Universe%29\"&gt;Military&lt;/a&gt; is seen in specific moments in both games:\nLocations.\nWhile more common in ' and ', the Mesa is a rather rare vehicle in \"\", as it does not spawn much, and only has prominent appearances in missions and when wanted in the &lt;a href=\"Exports%20and%20Imports\"&gt;Exports and Imports&lt;/a&gt; side-mission."}

He is the husband of &lt;a href=\"Amanda%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Amanda&lt;/a&gt; and the father of &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Jimmy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tracey%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Tracey&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nMichael was born in either , possibly in the . As a child, he did not have the luxuries and privileges that his own children have, and he grew up in the deprived environment of a trailer park with his parents. Like &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin&lt;/a&gt;, Michael had a tough upbringing due to his alcoholic and physically abusive father, who later abandoned him. Michael's mother, who also abandoned him, was told numerous versions of why his father left, which included, but were not limited to, him skipping town, being run over by a train and joining the navy. In his high school years, Michael was an acclaimed quarterback for an all-state football team, even putting an amazing performance during his games and occasionally had his picture in the local newspaper. Still, his temperament issues and constant injuries ultimately forced him to quit.\nAs a young adult, Michael began a life of crime. According to himself, he was imprisoned twice by the time he was twenty. While in prison, he learned many skills, including how to use a tattoo gun by tattooing his name on his cellmate's buttocks. He committed his first robbery in &lt;a href=\"1988\"&gt;1988&lt;/a&gt;, where he managed to steal &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;10,000 from a small business on the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Carcer%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Carcer City&lt;/a&gt;. Despite his failures and shortcomings, Michael perfected his criminal skills to become an expert marksman and efficient heist leader. During this period, he associated himself with &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt;, an exquisite planner who would later assist Michael in arranging heists and other tasks.\nMichael met &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; while escorting cargo across the border. While Trevor waited to meet his unknown employer, he noticed not one but two dust trails coming up the road, although he was told there would only be one person meeting him with the cargo. Michael exited the first vehicle while an older civilian exited the second. As it turned out, the more senior civilian had been carjacked by Michael. As Michael tried to make a hasty escape on foot, the older civilian attempted to get Trevor's attention on what had happened. Trevor approached the civilian and fired a flare gun into the man's eye, brutally killing him. He and Michael dumped the body into a lake afterward, which Trevor later described as horrible as the flare was still burning inside the man's skull. Trevor and Michael both threw up since the stench from the burning corpse remained. After noticing how well they worked together, Michael brought an aimless Trevor under his wing as a partner for various crimes he would commit. They were both somewhat successful in their profession. Still, Michael claims they were always impecunious and constantly on the run from the law, as Trevor's rage issues would cause him to murder someone in broad daylight, while Michael's circumspection, foresight, and distinctive style of quoting from &lt;a href=\"Solomon%20Richards\"&gt;Solomon Richards&lt;/a&gt;' films drew attention, causing him and Trevor to quickly leave town after completing a job. The duo, along with Lester and a &lt;a href=\"Moses\"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; other accomplices, committed robberies across the Midwest for a while.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1991\"&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;, Michael, Trevor, and one of their associates went to a strip club where they met a stripper named &lt;a href=\"Amanda%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Amanda&lt;/a&gt;. Though she initially took a liking to the third man, she eventually came onto Michael. After flirting with each other, the couple started a romantic relationship. Using money earned from illicit activities, Michael bought Amanda breast implants, which would help with her stripping and prostitution career. This led to Michael creating his own prostitution racket. After a few months of dating, Michael married Amanda and had two children, &lt;a href=\"Tracey%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Tracey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Jimmy&lt;/a&gt;, and lived at a trailer park in the Midwest. Eventually, Trevor began to consider Michael \"soft\" as he started questioning his criminal lifestyle, fearing for his family. As a result, Michael began to dislike Trevor and his mentally unstable antics, feeling that he might one day hurt his wife and kids. \nLater, Trevor met a fellow crook named &lt;a href=\"Brad%20Snider\"&gt;Brad Snider&lt;/a&gt; and introduced him to Michael. Michael and Brad never showed empathy for each other and often expressed mutual distaste and distrust when working together. According to Trevor, Brad planned at one point to cut off Michael and work solely with Trevor, but Trevor refused out of loyalty to the man who gave his life purpose. \nAt some point in &lt;a href=\"2004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, Michael met corrupt &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Investigation%20Bureau\"&gt;FIB&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Norton\"&gt;Dave Norton&lt;/a&gt; and made a clandestine agreement to cut ties with Trevor and Brad in exchange for the ability to disappear and start a new life. By paying Dave a monthly five-figure amount, he would relocate Michael and his family to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; and provide them with new identities to start over. As a result of this corrupt deal, Michael informed Dave of their upcoming robbery at a &lt;a href=\"Bobcat%20Security%20Depot\"&gt;cash storage facility&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ludendorff\"&gt;Ludendorff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20North%20Yankton\"&gt;North Yankton&lt;/a&gt;. The two devised a plan in which Norton would wait for the trio near their getaway site with a &lt;a href=\"Sniper%20Rifle\"&gt;Sniper Rifle&lt;/a&gt; and kill Trevor, due to his borderline insanity and whom Michael believed would come after him and his family should he find out about his role in the plan; shoot Michael, who, while actually wearing a bulletproof vest, would pretend to bleed out; and arrest Brad. The plan would benefit both Michael and Dave, as the former would walk away with a clean slate, while the latter would be given a career boost for taking down the supposed \"Most Wanted Man in America\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Prologue\"&gt;staged robbery&lt;/a&gt;, however, was a disaster in execution after the &lt;a href=\"Alex%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;guard&lt;/a&gt; at the front gate was shot in the head and killed; Trevor murdered a &lt;a href=\"Jaspers\"&gt;guard&lt;/a&gt; who snuck up on Michael, pulled off his balaclava, and held him at gunpoint; and when Michael, Brad, and Trevor were ambushed by over a dozen &lt;a href=\"North%20Yankton%20State%20Patrol\"&gt;police officers&lt;/a&gt; ready to apprehend them, giving the robbers no choice but to shoot their way out. During the getaway, their &lt;a href=\"Getaway%20Driver\"&gt;driver&lt;/a&gt; was killed by pursuing police, forcing Michael to take the wheel and drive the crew to the ambush point he and Norton had agreed on, where he claimed there was a helicopter waiting for their arrival. The plan almost failed after their &lt;a href=\"Rancher%20XL\"&gt;vehicle&lt;/a&gt; was hit by a &lt;a href=\"Freight%20Train\"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt; at a railroad crossing as they attempted to avoid a &lt;a href=\"Police%20Roadblocks\"&gt;roadblock&lt;/a&gt; of North Yankton State Patrol &lt;a href=\"Police%20Roadcruiser\"&gt;vehicles&lt;/a&gt;.\nThings further deviated from the original plan when Norton accidentally shot Brad instead of Trevor due to him walking into the line of fire. Norton then proceeded to shoot Michael as planned, and as he pretended to bleed out, Michael begged Trevor to leave him behind. Enraged beyond sense, Trevor proceeded to shoot numerous arriving police officers and briefly take a woman passing by hostage before barely escaping the ambush with his life. Trevor was never caught by the police and eventually went into hiding.\nAfter the incident, Michael Townley was declared dead, \"buried\" in the &lt;a href=\"Ludendorff%20Church%20and%20Cemetery\"&gt;Ludendorff cemetary&lt;/a&gt;, and given a funeral. In actuality, it was Brad who was buried in Michael's grave, having died from his gunshot wound. Norton and Michael both attended the funeral, with the latter watching from a distance. News reports stated that Michael had been killed, Brad had been imprisoned, and that Trevor remained at large. Michael eventually concluded that Trevor had ended up getting himself killed, but never received confirmation of this assumption.\nUpon their relocation to Los Santos, Michael and his family moved into a &lt;a href=\"De%20Santa%20Residence\"&gt;mansion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rockford%20Hills\"&gt;Rockford Hills&lt;/a&gt;, using the new surname \"De Santa\", which had been a long-term alias of Michael's.\nLiving the Vinewood Dream.\nMichael's life in Los Santos slowly deteriorated. He began to grow increasingly unhappy over leaving his criminal escapades behind for the family life he believed he desired, spending most of his days numbing his depression by either getting drunk, miserably lounging by his pool, or cheating on Amanda with another stripper, which Amanda eventually caught in the act. Michael's neglect and narcissism, along with his cheating, caused Amanda to spend much of their savings on plastic surgery and begin cheating as well, in order to get back at her husband. Their marriage eventually became a pseudo-open relationship, with unwritten rules that the other wouldn't find out about anyone they slept with, it wouldn't be on the other's dime, and it wouldn't be done in the house. At the same time, Tracey and Jimmy stopped showing their father any respect due to his disapproval for their less-than-ideal lifestyle choices: Jimmy for being a lazy, video game-obsessed stoner and Tracey for being a diva willing to do anything to become famous.\nSuffering from a midlife crisis and a failing marriage, Michael began visiting &lt;a href=\"Isiah%20Friedlander\"&gt;Isiah Friedlander&lt;/a&gt;, an overpriced psychologist caring very little for Michael's problems. At some point, Friedlander prescribed medication to Michael that caused him to cry, wet his pants, sleep at the dinner table, and howl in the middle of the night. Figuring he got the doses wrong, he took Michael off them.\nEvents of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"2013\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, nine years after Michael faked his death, and after another therapy session with Dr. Friedlander, Michael has a &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20and%20Lamar\"&gt;chance encounter&lt;/a&gt; with his future partner-in-crime, &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, when he unknowingly points Franklin and his friend, &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Davis\"&gt;Lamar Davis&lt;/a&gt;, in the direction of the &lt;a href=\"Bertolt%20Beach%20House\"&gt;location&lt;/a&gt; for their repossession job. A short while later, Jimmy buys an &lt;a href=\"BeeJay%20XL\"&gt;SUV&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Simeon%20Yetarian\"&gt;Simeon Yetarian&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Armenia\"&gt;Armenian&lt;/a&gt; car salesman (and Franklin's boss), who runs a credit fraud scam, selling the car to Jimmy on the agreement of him paying monthly installments of $5,000. After \"defaulting\" on a payment, Simeon has Franklin &lt;a href=\"Complications\"&gt;repossess&lt;/a&gt; the car from the De Santa Residence. He sneaks into the property and finds Jimmy's SUV parked in the garage, however, as he commandeers the vehicle and drives away from the property, Michael emerges from under some blankets in the back seat and points a &lt;a href=\"pistol\"&gt;pistol&lt;/a&gt; at Franklin's skull. The older man instructs Franklin to continue driving to the car dealership so he can meet the man who ordered the false repo job. During the trip, he sarcastically offers to buy Franklin a drink later. Upon arrival, Michael, still holding Franklin at gunpoint, demands that he drive through the front window of the dealership, which Franklin reluctantly does. Michael pays Franklin to leave before assaulting Yetarian, threatening him with more violence if he tries to rip off Michael or his family again.\nA few days later, during a heated argument between Tracey and Amanda, Michael escapes to his backyard with a glass of whisky in his hand and lies in a lawn chair while listening to \"I Don't Care Anymore\" on his &lt;a href=\"iFruit\"&gt;iFruit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Phone\"&gt;smartphone&lt;/a&gt;. As he relaxes, he is suddenly interrupted by Franklin, who took up Michael's earlier \"offer\" of a drink. Surprised that Franklin took it literally, Michael agrees to bring him to a nearby bar. On the way, however, Jimmy phones Michael and informs him that he tried to sell Michael's &lt;a href=\"Marquis\"&gt;yacht&lt;/a&gt;, but the \"&lt;a href=\"Marabunta%20Grande\"&gt;buyers&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Father/Son\"&gt;hijacked&lt;/a&gt; the truck carrying it with him still on board. A furious Michael, with Franklin in tow, gives chase to the hijackers in Amanda's &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; and manages to rescue Jimmy but cannot recover the yacht as the car's engine stalls, having sustained damage during the chase. Michael is furious with Jimmy but is also impressed by Franklin's actions during the event, having climbed onto the boat and rescued Jimmy while fighting off the attackers.\nLater on, Michael returns home to &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20Counseling\"&gt;discover&lt;/a&gt; Amanda sleeping with her &lt;a href=\"Kyle%20Chavis\"&gt;tennis coach&lt;/a&gt;, who escapes wearing just his underwear. Franklin shows up, and the duo chase after the coach in a &lt;a href=\"Bison\"&gt;truck&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo%27s%20house\"&gt;stilt house&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vinewood%20Hills\"&gt;Vinewood Hills&lt;/a&gt;, where Michael, fueled with rage and adrenaline, commands Franklin to hook the truck's winch around the supports of the house's deck. Using the power of the truck's engine, Michael loosens the supports, causing most of the deck to collapse and crumble down the hillside, which shocks Franklin but also leaves Michael feeling satisfied with himself. During the drive back to Michael's house, he receives a call from the tennis coach and learns that the house does not belong to him, but rather to the &lt;a href=\"Natalia%20Zverovna\"&gt;mistress&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Martin Madrazo&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Madrazo%20Cartel\"&gt;cartel&lt;/a&gt; leader. She sends a hit squad after Michael and Franklin for their actions, and the pair manage to fend the attackers off, but Madrazo and some of his associates soon arrive at Michael's house to confront them. Franklin informs Michael of the latter's reputation as Madrazo orders his &lt;a href=\"Javier%20Madrazo\"&gt;cousin&lt;/a&gt; to hand him a &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Bat\"&gt;baseball bat&lt;/a&gt;, which he immediately uses to bludgeon Michael lightly. Madrazo orders Michael to pay for the rebuilding of the house at the cost of $2,500,000 - money which Michael does not have - and threatens further violence upon him if he does not provide the funds before leaving. Michael realizes that to get the money, he will have to re-enter a life of crime and calls his old contact, Lester.\nLater, Michael is watching a noir-style movie, but Jimmy's loud swearing through his headset while playing video games distracts Michael from enjoying it, so he decides to venture upstairs to chastise his son. After Jimmy insults and tells him to leave, Michael throws a chair at the television. This riles Jimmy up, furthering Michael's rage to the point where he eventually dares Jimmy to hit him. However, the heat quickly dies, and Michael apologizes, but tells Jimmy he's wasting his life by doing nothing productive. Michael convinces a reluctant and still angry Jimmy to drive to &lt;a href=\"Vespucci%20Beach\"&gt;Vespucci Beach&lt;/a&gt; with him for some father and son time; however, even in the &lt;a href=\"Tailgater\"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt;, Jimmy still argues with and about Michael and his poor mental health, going as far as to blame his father for his own problems. At the beach, they have a short &lt;a href=\"Bicycles\"&gt;bicycle&lt;/a&gt; race and finish at the &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro%20Pier\"&gt;Del Perro Pier&lt;/a&gt;. Still mad at Michael for breaking his TV and bringing him outside, Jimmy decides to upset his father by pointing out a luxurious and large &lt;a href=\"Dignity\"&gt;yacht&lt;/a&gt; in the distance and explaining how Tracey is on board, hanging out with porn producers and potentially having sex with them. Furious that Jimmy only agreed to hang out with him under ulterior motives and enraged at the thought of his daughter hanging around with strange, perverted men, Michael takes his shirt off and dives into the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;sea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daddy%27s%20Little%20Girl\"&gt;swimming to the yacht&lt;/a&gt;. He eventually climbs aboard and very quickly begins to cause drama by throwing a portable speaker overboard and pushing a man off the side. He takes Tracey back ashore against her will on a &lt;a href=\"Seashark\"&gt;Seashark&lt;/a&gt;, but not before &lt;a href=\"Freddy%20Slade\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Porndude\"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; the producers give chase after him, leading to a shootout. Michael ultimately escapes and finally returns to dry land. Upon reaching the beach, Tracey and Jimmy leave, the former being angry at Michael.\nMichael eventually meets with Lester, who agrees to help Michael get the money needed to pay off Madrazo, but only if he decides to &lt;a href=\"Friend%20Request\"&gt;sabotage&lt;/a&gt; a prototype &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader%20Phone\"&gt;phone&lt;/a&gt; due to be unveiled at an event keynote by &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Norris\"&gt;Jay Norris&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the social networking site &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader\"&gt;Lifeinvader&lt;/a&gt;. Michael infiltrates the &lt;a href=\"Lifeinvader%20Office\"&gt;Lifeinvader Office&lt;/a&gt; and meets a computer programmer named &lt;a href=\"Rickie%20Lukens\"&gt;Rickie Lukens&lt;/a&gt;, who mistakes Michael for an IT technician. Rickie invites him upstairs to fix his computer, where Michael has to close dozens of pop-ups and run &lt;a href=\"AntEater\"&gt;antivirus software&lt;/a&gt; to rid the computer of the viruses. Afterwards, Michael then finds the prototype phone and swaps the battery for an explosive device given to him by Lester. He returns home and watches the live &lt;a href=\"Weazel%20News\"&gt;Weazel News&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Television%20in%20GTA%20V\"&gt;broadcast&lt;/a&gt; of the keynote. During the broadcast, Norris reveals the phone, prompting Michael to call him on it, as per Lester's request. Norris answers the call, and the phone detonates next to his head, killing him instantly and cutting the broadcast short. With Lester satisfied, he helps Michael &lt;a href=\"Casing%20the%20Jewel%20Store\"&gt;collect information&lt;/a&gt; about the contents of a &lt;a href=\"Vangelico\"&gt;high-end jewelry store&lt;/a&gt;, and makes preparations to &lt;a href=\"The%20Jewel%20Store%20Job\"&gt;rob it&lt;/a&gt;. During the planning process, Michael insists that his new friend Franklin be involved, believing the latter will find the experience beneficial.\nThe heist goes smoothly, though during it, Michael throws a &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Stalley\"&gt;traffic cop&lt;/a&gt; to the ground and quotes one of Solomon Richards' movies. The debt owed to Martin Madrazo is paid off, with Michael and Franklin recieving a small cut of the takings for themselves. Meanwhile, out in &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Shores\"&gt;Sandy Shores&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor Philips, who has been still alive since the cash deposit heist, &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Philips\"&gt;watches a news report of the jewel store robbery&lt;/a&gt;, during which the traffic cop is interviewed and tells the reporter the quote Michael said, which catches Trevor's attention. Believing that either someone else was pretending to be his old partner-in-crime or that said famous bank robber didn't actually die, he sends his friend &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Hebert\"&gt;Wade&lt;/a&gt; to find Michael's whereabouts. Eventually, Wade informs Trevor that a man matching Michael's description was living in Los Santos. Trevor deduces that this man and Michael were the same individual after all and &lt;a href=\"Friends%20Reunited\"&gt;travels&lt;/a&gt; to Los Santos to find him.\nAfter several days of laying low from the jewelry store heist, Michael finds &lt;a href=\"Weed\"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt; in the fridge and correctly assumes it is Jimmy's. He and Amanda begin to argue, and tensions further flare up by the sudden arrival of Amanda's &lt;a href=\"yoga\"&gt;yoga&lt;/a&gt; instructor, &lt;a href=\"Fabien%20LaRouche\"&gt;Fabien LaRouche&lt;/a&gt;, whom Michael promptly insults. Jimmy then arrives to get his weed, causing Michael to taunt him with it. Trevor then unexpectedly walks in, much to everyone's shock and horror. As Trevor inspects Michael and his family, he asks where Tracey is, to which Jimmy breaks the tension by revealing she has gone to audition for the TV show \"&lt;a href=\"Fame%20or%20Shame\"&gt;Fame or Shame&lt;/a&gt;\" as a dancer. Realizing that Tracey will embarrass herself in front of the nation due to her \"horrible\" dancing, Michael and Trevor rush to the &lt;a href=\"Maze%20Bank%20Arena\"&gt;Maze Bank Arena&lt;/a&gt;, where the audition is. The two find Tracey and watch as she performs a sexually seductive dance while the show's host, &lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones\"&gt;Lazlow Jones&lt;/a&gt;, begins to join in, angering both Michael and Trevor. The pair &lt;a href=\"Fame%20or%20Shame%20%28mission%29\"&gt;give chase&lt;/a&gt; to a terrified Lazlow in a hijacked &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt; truck, pursuing him to the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20River%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Los Santos River&lt;/a&gt;, where Lazlow's &lt;a href=\"Dilettante\"&gt;Dilettante&lt;/a&gt; ultimately breaks down. Trevor forces Lazlow to remove his pants and dance for him as he films it on his phone, amusing Michael. In the aftermath, Tracey is even more angry at Michael, which doesn't seem to bother him, further straining his relationship with his daughter.\nMichael is contacted by Dave Norton, who knows he was the one who committed the jewelry store robbery and requests that they meet at the &lt;a href=\"Galileo%20Observatory\"&gt;Galileo Observatory&lt;/a&gt;. Norton explains that Michael's decision to rob the store has spotlighted him in the FIB and that if his superiors read his files and discover his deal with Michael, it could cause serious repercussions for the pair. Michael reluctantly agrees to do tasks for Norton to help keep his job with the FIB, in exchange for the continued coverup of Michael's past life. Michael's &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Man%20Walking\"&gt;first task&lt;/a&gt; is to locate &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Kerimov\"&gt;Ferdinand Kerimov&lt;/a&gt;, a suspected terrorist whom the FIB's rival, the &lt;a href=\"International%20Affairs%20Agency\"&gt;IAA&lt;/a&gt;, has declared to be dead. To do so, Norton knocks Michael unconscious to allow him to infiltrate the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County%20Coroner%20Office\"&gt;morgue&lt;/a&gt;. Michael regains consciousness during his \"autopsy\" and incapacitates one of the coroners. After searching the mortuary, Michael discovers Kerimov's identity tag attached to the foot of a different person's body, and calls Norton to let him know. Michael later escapes the morgue and phones Franklin, requesting that they meet. Michael informs him of his past with the FIB and advises Franklin to leave the city for his own safety, but Franklin tells him that he will stay and help, so as to repay Michael for his faith in him.\n&lt;a href=\"Steve%20Haines\"&gt;Steve Haines&lt;/a&gt;, a decorated but highly corrupt FIB agent and Norton's superior, meets with Michael and further ropes him into the FIB's bidding. Haines informs him that Kerimov is being held in the downtown &lt;a href=\"IAA%20Headquarters\"&gt;IAA Headquarters&lt;/a&gt; and that he needs to help &lt;a href=\"Three%27s%20Company\"&gt;extract&lt;/a&gt; him, after which Norton explains that he will be working alongside Trevor and Franklin. Michael introduces the latter two to each other before he and Trevor fly to the IAA building in a &lt;a href=\"Frogger\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt;. With Trevor piloting and Franklin proving sniper cover from a &lt;a href=\"Arcadius%20Business%20Center\"&gt;nearby building&lt;/a&gt;, Michael repels down the side of the skyscraper and successfully rescues Kerimov, who is taken into FIB custody.\nMichael and Trevor are later summoned to a warehouse at the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Los%20Santos\"&gt;Port of Los Santos&lt;/a&gt; where Michael is briefed that he will accompany Norton to assassinate a suspected &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijan\"&gt;Azerbaijani&lt;/a&gt; terrorist, &lt;a href=\"Tahir%20Javan\"&gt;Tahir Javan&lt;/a&gt;, while Trevor and Haines &lt;a href=\"By%20the%20Book\"&gt;torture&lt;/a&gt; Kerimov for information on Javan's whereabouts and appearance. Kerimov provides information on Javan, who is shot dead by Michael.\nLater, as Michael is smoking on the couch and watching a movie, he is confronted by Amanda for smoking inside and his general attitude, starting yet another argument. Fabian arrives and invites Michael to participate in his and Amanda's yoga session, much to her irritation. The &lt;a href=\"Did%20Somebody%20Say%20Yoga%3F\"&gt;session&lt;/a&gt; passes relatively smoothly until Fabien performs a sexual pose on Amanda. Angry, Michael lunges at Fabian, who simply sidesteps him, causing Michael to fall into the pool. Angered by her husband's behavior, Amanda leaves with Fabien. Michael goes upstairs and asks Jimmy to hang out with him, wanting to leave the house for a while. They meet &lt;a href=\"Ahron%20Ward\"&gt;a friend of Jimmy's&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Burger%20Shot%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Burger Shot&lt;/a&gt;, who gives Jimmy some cannabis and a drink. On the way home, Jimmy pressures Michael into sipping the drink, which causes him to feel drowsy. Jimmy reveals that he had the drink spiked with ketamine before pushing Michael out of the car, informing him that he's taking it and some of the money from his bank account, and that he is moving out. Michael has hallucinations of being abducted by &lt;a href=\"aliens\"&gt;aliens&lt;/a&gt; and falling from the sky before waking up in his underwear a few blocks away from his home. When he gets to the house, he finds a note from Amanda saying that she and the rest of the family are leaving due to his poor behavior.\nTrevor later contacts Michael and Franklin to partake in a &lt;a href=\"The%20Merryweather%20Heist\"&gt;heist he is planning&lt;/a&gt;, which involves stealing unknown cargo from a mercenary group called &lt;a href=\"Merryweather%20Security\"&gt;Merryweather Security&lt;/a&gt;. The heist goes as planned, and Trevor finds that he has stolen a superweapon. Shortly after, Lester arrives and reveals that the weapon is highly dangerous, especially in the hands of someone like Trevor, and explains to him that if it isn't returned, they will all be relentlessly hunted down. Michael and Franklin agree, and Trevor, while furious that he cannot keep the loot, reluctantly allows it to be put back.\nAfter the heist, Michael, along with Franklin and Trevor, are called upon by Haines and Norton. This time, they &lt;a href=\"Blitz%20Play\"&gt;must rob an armored truck&lt;/a&gt; filled with funds that the IAA has received from drug sales. Unable to get any assistance from the corrupt agents, Michael decides they will approach the job with a \"classic blitz play\". Despite being faced with some mild &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Police%20Department%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;LSPD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"National%20Office%20of%20Security%20Enforcement\"&gt;NOOSE&lt;/a&gt; resistance, the heist is executed smoothly. Michael then proceeds to deliver the funds to billionaire &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt;, who offers him a partnership with his idol, movie producer Solomon Richards. To get this partnership, however, he has to participate in one of several robberies that involve stealing several rare cars for Weston, alongside Trevor and Franklin. Michael eagerly &lt;a href=\"I%20Fought%20the%20Law...\"&gt;agrees and fulfills&lt;/a&gt; his end of the bargain. Thrilled, he meet Richards who hires him as an assistant. Richards explains that while filming his latest movie, \"&lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28film%29\"&gt;Meltdown&lt;/a&gt;\", actor &lt;a href=\"Milton%20McIlroy\"&gt;Milton McIlroy&lt;/a&gt; and his agent, &lt;a href=\"Ancelotti%20Crime%20Family\"&gt;Ancelotti Crime Family&lt;/a&gt; made man &lt;a href=\"Rocco%20Pelosi\"&gt;Rocco Pelosi&lt;/a&gt;, demanded that they renegotiate McIlroy's deal, which Richards refused, prompting the two to convince director &lt;a href=\"Anton%20Beaudelaire\"&gt;Anton Beaudelaire&lt;/a&gt; to cease production until their demands are met. &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Richards\"&gt;Michael confronts Rocco&lt;/a&gt; and assaults him before climbing into a helicopter containing McIlroy and Beaudelaire, where he then performs dangerous maneuvers with it to scare the two into submission. This gets Michael on Richards' good side, and he is promised the role of associate producer for the upcoming film if he continues his good work.\nMartin Madrazo later summons Michael and Trevor to his &lt;a href=\"La%20Fuente%20Blanca\"&gt;ranch&lt;/a&gt;, offering them a job. The crime boss, who now sees Michael as a friend, explains that his cousin is planning to fly out to &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt; to testify against him. He asks Michael and Trevor to &lt;a href=\"Caida%20Libre\"&gt;shoot down&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Shamal\"&gt;private jet&lt;/a&gt; carrying him and recover some sensitive documents onboard. Michael does his part by bringing it down with a &lt;a href=\"Remote%20Sniper\"&gt;remote sniper&lt;/a&gt; inside a &lt;a href=\"Burrito\"&gt;van&lt;/a&gt;, while Trevor makes it to the crash site and recovers the files, before returning to Madrazo to give them to him. After destroying the van, Michael finds out, to his horror, that Madrazo refused to pay the pair, causing Trevor to attack him and kidnap Madrazo's wife, &lt;a href=\"Patricia%20Madrazo\"&gt;Patricia&lt;/a&gt;, after he witnessed her husband mistreating her. Knowing what Madrazo might do to them if he catches them, Michael agrees to hide in Sandy Shores with Trevor in his &lt;a href=\"Trevor%27s%20Trailer\"&gt;trailer&lt;/a&gt;, alongside Patricia. Later on, Haines and Norton summon Michael, Franklin, and Trevor for another mission against the IAA. This time, the two agents plot to raid the &lt;a href=\"Humane%20Labs%20and%20Research\"&gt;Humane Labs and Research&lt;/a&gt; to steal a dangerous neurotoxin they claim the agency is developing there. To carry out this operation, the trio must secure funds to purchase a &lt;a href=\"Cargobob\"&gt;Cargobob&lt;/a&gt; and other required equipment for the heist. Ultimately, they, along with Lester, settle on robbing the &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County%20Savings%20Bank\"&gt;Blaine County Savings Bank&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Bay\"&gt;Paleto Bay&lt;/a&gt;, as it, according to Trevor, contains millions of dollars deposited there by &lt;a href=\"Blaine%20County\"&gt;Blaine County's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20County%20Sheriff\"&gt;corrupt law enforcement department&lt;/a&gt; who extort money from the local cannabis farms and meth labs.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Score%20Setup\"&gt;planning the robbery&lt;/a&gt;, Michael and Trevor receive a call from Franklin, where they discover he is tailing the remaining &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20brothers\"&gt;O'Neil brothers&lt;/a&gt; - inbred, redneck meth dealers who are vengeful due to an earlier &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Maze\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; by Trevor on their &lt;a href=\"O%27Neil%20Ranch\"&gt;ranch&lt;/a&gt; that resulted in the murders of most of the O'Neil family and the destruction of their cookhouse. While Michael and Trevor fly to Franklin's location, the O'Neils crash in the forest. Using a rifle fitted with a &lt;a href=\"Thermal%20Vision\"&gt;thermal scope&lt;/a&gt;, Michael shoots two of the brothers, while Franklin locates and kills the final O'Neil with the help of Lamar's dog, &lt;a href=\"Chop\"&gt;Chop&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsing &lt;a href=\"Military%20Hardware\"&gt;stolen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"military\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; body armor and &lt;a href=\"Minigun\"&gt;machine guns&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor, Michael, Franklin, and a gunman &lt;a href=\"The%20Paleto%20Score\"&gt;successfully rob the Paleto Bay bank&lt;/a&gt;, taking a small cut each and giving the largest profit to Haines and Norton so they can purchase the equipment for the &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20Business\"&gt;Humane Labs robbery&lt;/a&gt;, much to the team's irritation. While awaiting this operation, Michael and Trevor carry out another job, &lt;a href=\"Derailed\"&gt;raiding&lt;/a&gt; a Merryweather &lt;a href=\"Freight%20Train\"&gt;courier train&lt;/a&gt; that carries gold and priceless artifacts so that they can pay off Martin Madrazo. Trevor derails the train over a &lt;a href=\"Raton%20Canyon%20Bridge\"&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Raton%20Canyon\"&gt;Raton Canyon&lt;/a&gt;, after which Michael dives into the river below to retrieve the merchandise, taking an ancient Aztec fertility statue that Madrazo would value. Trevor is dissatisfied with Michael's choice of loot, though he calms down when Michael proposes that, once they get the FIB off their cases, they can carry out a heist they've dreamed about doing for years - stealing millions of dollars worth of gold bullion from the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Depository\"&gt;Union Depository&lt;/a&gt;. Initially, Trevor states that it can't be done, verging suicidal almost, but mutually accepts when Michael challenges him on that being a line he's afraid to cross.\nWhen Michael, Trevor, and Franklin meet with Haines and Norton for the Humane Labs robbery, Haines verbally berates them for not bringing in three more men for the operation - a fact they were left in the dark about when he forgot to let them know. With no other choice, Haines and Norton are forced to join Michael in extracting the neurotoxin, while Trevor and Franklin are on vehicle detail. They successfully retrieve the neurotoxin, but when the Cargobob takes too long to escape, Haines shoots himself in the leg to pass as a double agent and distract the oncoming IAA personnel while Michael and Norton to escape.\nAfter safely returning to Los Santos with Madrazo being taken care of, Michael receives an unexpected visit from Trevor at his house, who pitches him with the idea of busting Brad out of jail. Michael's reluctance to go ahead with the plan leads to a debate, during which Trevor finally realizes that Brad is, in fact, dead and buried at Michael's supposed grave in North Yankton. He hastily &lt;a href=\"Bury%20the%20Hatchet\"&gt;travels to Ludendorff&lt;/a&gt; with Michael in pursuit, where he confirms his suspicions. After a standoff at the grave, they are attacked by &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20Triads\"&gt;Triad henchmen&lt;/a&gt; on orders of leader &lt;a href=\"Wei%20Cheng\"&gt;Wei Cheng&lt;/a&gt;, who wanted to meet with Trevor for his role in wiping out the O'Neil brothers, who the Triads were planning to work with. The Triads incorrectly assumed that Michael and Trevor were gay lovers while surveying them during their exile to Sandy Shores. Trevor flees, leaving Michael to fend off the henchmen, causing him to be captured and brought back to Los Santos, where he is held within a &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Slaughterhouse\"&gt;slaughterhouse&lt;/a&gt;. Cheng later calls Trevor and reveals that they will kill Michael unless Trevor agrees to meet with him. Angry at Michael for his betrayal, Trevor sarcastically tells Cheng that he \"loves [Michael] dearly\" and hangs up the phone, refusing to accept the demands.\nWhen Cheng realizes that Trevor won't meet him, he orders that Michael be put into one of the slaughterhouse's meat grinders. With the help of Lester, Michael is &lt;a href=\"Fresh%20Meat%20%28mission%29\"&gt;rescued&lt;/a&gt; by Franklin, who afterwards presses him about what happened in Ludendorff. Michael opens up about his past decision to betray Trevor and defends that he had to do it for his family. He attempts to keep Franklin from prying further by reminding him of Weston's car job, but Franklin informs him that he, Trevor, and his friend Lamar had already completed it, only for Weston &lt;a href=\"Pack%20Man\"&gt;to stiff them on the payment&lt;/a&gt;. Confused, Michael assures him that he will speak with Weston the next time he heads to the studio.\nMichael returns to the &lt;a href=\"Richards%20Majestic%20Productions\"&gt;movie studio&lt;/a&gt; to resume work with Solomon. After witnessing Pelosi and his associate &lt;a href=\"Gianni\"&gt;Gianni&lt;/a&gt; assault Solomon, Michael &lt;a href=\"The%20Ballad%20of%20Rocco\"&gt;chases&lt;/a&gt; the two and ends up killing both of them. In return, Solomon keeps his word and credits Michael as an associate producer in his upcoming film, much to Michael's overwhelming joy. As he exits the studio, he leaves a voicemail message on Amanda's phone to convince her that he is finally doing something good with his life.\nMichael and Franklin are called up once again by Haines for one more job: to &lt;a href=\"Cleaning%20out%20the%20Bureau\"&gt;break&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;into&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"FIB%20Headquarters\"&gt;FIB Headquarters&lt;/a&gt; and remove incriminating evidence against Haines, as his ploy as a double agent caused Haines' superiors to start looking into his recent activities. This goes according to plan, except that while deleting the files on Steve, Michael also deletes the files the FIB had on himself, removing Steve's leverage over him. When Michael meets Haines, Norton, and fellow FIB agent &lt;a href=\"Andreas%20Sanchez\"&gt;Andreas Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Kortz%20Center\"&gt;Kortz Center&lt;/a&gt; for debriefing, Haines attempts to arrest him. However, this drastically turns into a Mexican standoff when the men all pull guns on each other. The situation further escalates with the arrival of an IAA team led by the &lt;a href=\"United%20Liberty%20Paper%20Contact\"&gt;U.L. Paper Contact&lt;/a&gt;, a rogue FIB team working alongside Sanchez, and a Merryweather team. Haines is shot in the leg by an FIB operative, but manages to escape, killing Sanchez in the process. Norton and Michael proceed to &lt;a href=\"The%20Wrap%20Up\"&gt;fight their way&lt;/a&gt; through the Merryweather mercenaries, FIB, and IAA agents and escape with the help of Trevor. Despite not forgiving Michael, he promises not to kill him if they succeed in their upcoming Union Depository robbery.\nHaving had enough of being alone, Michael, with the help of Jimmy, finally seeks out and &lt;a href=\"Reuniting%20the%20Family\"&gt;reunites&lt;/a&gt; his family. With them back in the house and his involvement in Solomon Richards' upcoming film, things start to look positive for him until Devin Weston announces his intentions to exploit the movie studio's insurance policy by destroying the completed film so he can claim the insurance money, ultimately closing the studio which he will promptly buy and demolish to build condos on the site. Infuriated upon learning of Weston's intentions, Michael &lt;a href=\"Legal%20Trouble\"&gt;chases&lt;/a&gt; the former's &lt;a href=\"Molly%20Schultz\"&gt;lawyer&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Santos%20International%20Airport%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt; to try and retrieve the film's master copy. During the chase, she is accidentally killed after being sucked into a jet engine. Michael recovers the film, and Solomon arranges a premiere so that it cannot be tampered with further.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Meltdown%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;premiere&lt;/a&gt; for \"Meltdown\", Weston, furious over his lawyer's death, unexpectedly appears and cryptically reveals his plans to kill Michael's family in revenge for his lawyer's death. Michael rushes home to find Merryweather operatives assaulting his house. He kills the intruders and protects his family from oncoming mercenaries until the coast is clear. Afterwards, his family temporarily leaves again, this time upon Michael's request, for their own protection. The next morning, Michael calls Lester from the &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro%20Pier\"&gt;Del Perro Pier&lt;/a&gt; and angrily informs him about Merryweather's attack. Despite this incident, Michael is still confident in performing their heist on the Union Depository. After helping Franklin deal with an incident where his friend Lamar is &lt;a href=\"Lamar%20Down\"&gt;kidnapped&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Ballas%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;a rival gang&lt;/a&gt;, they pull off &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;the heist&lt;/a&gt;, which ends up successful. Michael, Franklin, Trevor, Lester, and their crew manage to steal over $200 million worth of gold bullion. Around this time, Michael goes to a &lt;a href=\"Abandonment%20Issues\"&gt;therapy session&lt;/a&gt; with Dr. Friedlander, where he learns, to his fury, that his psychiatrist has been using details from their sessions to make himself famous without his knowledge. Sensing Michael's anger, Friedlander flees, though later sends an apology email which Michael rebukes. \nEnding.\nFollowing the heist, both Steve Haines and Devin Weston visit Franklin. Haines wants Franklin to &lt;a href=\"Something%20Sensible\"&gt;kill Trevor&lt;/a&gt; due to his unpredictable nature, while Weston asks that Franklin &lt;a href=\"The%20Time%27s%20Come\"&gt;kill Michael&lt;/a&gt; instead, because Weston still wants revenge on him. Franklin can either choose one of these options or &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;team up with Michael and Trevor once more and, with the help of Lester, take down their enemies once and for all&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, Franklin chooses the latter.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nOption C=\nThe Third Way.\nLester falsely leaks to Haines and Weston that the stolen gold is being melted down at a &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Banks%20Steel%20Foundry\"&gt;local foundry&lt;/a&gt;, to bait them into sending their men with the intention that they would be wiped out, leaving the two with nothing to throw back. As Lester predicted, Haines sends FIB teams while Weston sends Merryweather operatives, who are all promptly ambushed by Michael, Trevor, Franklin, and Lamar. Once all of the mercenaries and agents are taken out, Michael has Trevor and Franklin kill Steve Haines and Wei Cheng, respectively. Meanwhile, he kills a gang member rival to Franklin named &lt;a href=\"Stretch%20%28character%29\"&gt;Stretch&lt;/a&gt;, so as not to implicate Franklin as a potential suspect. Afterwards, Michael meets Franklin and Trevor, the latter having kidnapped Weston, locked him in the trunk of his car, and brought him to a cliff overlooking the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean%20%28HD%20Universe%29\"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Chiliad%20Mountain%20State%20Wilderness\"&gt;Chiliad Mountain State Wilderness&lt;/a&gt;. After taunting Weston about their apparent victory, the trio push the car off the cliff, sending it into the ocean where it promptly explodes, killing Weston. After making peace with Trevor, Michael realizes he is getting too old to be a criminal. Just before leaving, Michael, Franklin, and Trevor agree to end their criminal partnership, but still remain friends.\nAfterward, Michael receives an email from &lt;a href=\"Don%20Percival\"&gt;Don Percival&lt;/a&gt;, the CEO of Merryweather, thanking him for taking out Devin, as he was able to buy back Devin's company shares at a reduced price. He tells Michael that no reply is necessary and that he should not interfere with his business ventures again.\nIf Michael and Trevor hang out, Michael will sincerely apologize for everything and offer Trevor his share of the Union Depository money. Trevor declines the money but accepts Michael's apology, officially ending their feud.\nOption A=\nSomething Sensible.\nFranklin calls Michael, informing him of his intent to kill Trevor. While Michael says this sounds like something Franklin should handle himself, he agrees to help if he can. Franklin pulls a gun on Trevor at the &lt;a href=\"Murrieta%20Oil%20Field\"&gt;Murrieta Oilfields&lt;/a&gt;, who flees, resulting in a car chase between the two, during which Franklin again calls Michael for help. He arrives in a &lt;a href=\"Premier\"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt; and t-bones Trevor's truck, causing him to crash into a gas tanker and soaking him in gasoline. As Trevor crawls out of his vehicle, he curses Michael and Franklin for betraying him, as they were two of his closest friends and some of the very few people he trusted. One of the two shoots the gas, igniting it and incinerating Trevor. As they walk away, Michael and Franklin reflect on Trevor's psychotic nature. They split up and are about to leave before Franklin sarcastically remarks on the event as an \"illuminating experience\", which Michael counters by telling him to survive and that everything else is \"bullshit\". \nAfterward, Michael and Franklin frequently reassure each other and those who ask that they made the right choice and chose the necessary option due to Trevor's dangerous nature. Michael and Franklin are no longer able to hang out, as if they meet in person Michael will decide that he needs time away. Michael receives a call from Jimmy, asking what happened to Trevor, to which Michael implies that he was involved in his death, upsetting Jimmy, who can also no longer hang out with him. Michael later receives an email from Trevor's friend &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Jakowski\"&gt;Ron Jakowski&lt;/a&gt;, who is angry at Michael for killing him and ruining the business they grew together. Michael considers the email \"spam\" and tells Ron not to contact him again. Additionally, Trevor's cut from the Union Depository heist is split between Michael and Franklin.\nOption B=\nThe Time's Come.\nFranklin calls Michael and asks to meet in a secluded location in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Senora%20Desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; to talk, which Michael obliges. Shortly after Michael arrives, he receives a call from Amanda, who informs him that Tracey has been accepted into college. After Michael finishes the call, the duo reflect on their partnership. However, Michael realizes that Franklin led him out to the desert to kill him, and escapes in his car with Franklin following close behind, eventually ending up at the &lt;a href=\"Palmer-Taylor%20Power%20Station\"&gt;Palmer-Taylor Power Station&lt;/a&gt;. Franklin chases Michael onto one of the chimney walkways and pushes Michael over the rail after a minor scuffle. Before he can fall, however, Franklin grabs Michael's arm, leaving him hanging precariously over the side. Franklin either drops him or has second thoughts and attempts to save him. If the latter is chosen, he will try to pull Michael up, only for him to headbutt Franklin, causing him to let go and drop Michael to his death. \nAfterward, Trevor, Amanda, and Jimmy deduce that Franklin is responsible for Michael's death and will no longer speak to him. Furthermore, Michael's family puts their house up for sale and receives his Union Depository cut.\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nAfter \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"2021\"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;, Michael still works at Richards Majestic Studios. While &lt;a href=\"On%20Course\"&gt;chasing&lt;/a&gt; two &lt;a href=\"Caddy\"&gt;golf carts&lt;/a&gt; that happen to drive through the studio complex, Franklin will remark to &lt;a href=\"GTA%20Online%20Protagonist\"&gt;his associate&lt;/a&gt; that he hopes Michael isn't working that day.\nCharacters murdered by Michael De Santa.\nCharacters murdered by Michael De Santa in the storyline of \"Grand Theft Auto V\". \nOptional murders.\nCharacters optionally murdered by Michael De Santa, depending on the player's choice. \nStrangers and Freaks murders.\nCharacters optionally murdered by Michael De Santa during the Strangers and Freaks missions, depending on the player's choice.\nNon-canon murders.\nCharacters optionally murdered by Michael De Santa in \"Grand Theft Auto V\", although not intended to be killed. These characters are still alive regardless of the player's choice, and some physically appear in the post-2013 events of \"Grand Theft Auto Online\". \nDescription.\nPhysical appearance.\nMichael is a Caucasian male, aged either 45 or 48, with grayish-black hair and light green eyes. Michael is of heavy build and is 6' 2\" (1.88 m) tall and weighs 210 lbs (95 kg).\nMedical examiners in &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Man%20Walking\"&gt;Dead Man Walking&lt;/a&gt; describe Michael as overweight, with fat deposits on his abdomen suggesting a \"fondness\" for Bleeder Burgers, leading them to suspect his \"death\" as a result of coronary failure. They and Trevor in &lt;a href=\"Derailed\"&gt;Derailed&lt;/a&gt; have noted his poor hygiene due to his drinking and smoking cigarettes, giving him discolored teeth and fingers, with the examiners estimating he smoked approximately a pack of cigarettes a day with cigars. The medical examiners also noticed broken capillaries around his nose to indicate his alcoholism and deduced he had an unhealthy liver.\nIn official artwork, he is shown to have blue eyes and dark brown hair. His default appearance is a cleft chin with a Lexington hairstyle and short stubble around his face. Michael's physique is thicker and more heavily built than the likes of Trevor and Franklin, having burly, veiny arms and legs. This most certainly comes from his time as a quarterback and his stint in prison. Although Michael isn't obese or out of shape, many people around him will occasionally make fun of his rather large midsection, such as Jimmy and Trevor or even Michael himself at many times. Michael's movement is also much slower than Franklin and Trevor's, as he's much older. On top of that, his ten-year retirement from crime means he is not as physically active as the other two. During &lt;a href=\"Pack%20Man\"&gt;Pack Man&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor tells Lamar that when he met Michael, he was \"kinda fat, but strong underneath\".\nMichael's initial wardrobe sets him with a gray two-piece suit without a tie and casual attires like beach shorts with sandals or polo shirts. His gray suit is his default outfit used in most of his artwork and concept art. He shows approval as he's trying out outfits at Ponsonby's, as opposed to the clear disdain of buying items from Suburban or Binco. His Prologue appearance has him with shorter, shaven hair. It is between his default Lexington and The Wood hairstyle, somewhat similar to the Cesar haircut of &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Johnson\"&gt;CJ&lt;/a&gt;. His facial features are still the same.\nMichael's beta appearance can be seen in &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V/Trailers\"&gt;Trailers&lt;/a&gt; one and two, where he is seen with green eyes and an older look. This was changed later in the character's development to make him look like he wasn't too old to perform some of his actions during gameplay.\nPersonality.\nMichael is muddled, even confused, by his \"good and evil\" personalities. He spends an unusual amount of time in his head, where he can comfortably think or reminisce about certain things or aspects that give him a brief moment of nostalgia for his glory days. Nevertheless, it also constrains him into a world of wistfulness and bewilderment as he ponders why things aren't going in the direction he planned. Michael is obsessed with materialistic appearance and images, so he dreams of living out his \"Vinewood Dream\" with his family. He claims to Franklin that he has lived a repeated pattern of \"Chase things, get em', hate em'.\"\nMichael holds a deep-seated amount of self-hatred due to him wanting to live a false lifestyle rather than coming to the conclusion that his troubling mistakes have brought a great deal of misfortune upon himself, his family, and old friends and associates (his agreement with the FIB is a prime example). The self-hatred gives him an exceptionally short temper that he does not know how to control, which fills him with rage and causes him to not think at times. One example is when he caught Amanda having an affair with her tennis coach, Kyle Chavis. He chases Kyle to a mansion and pulls it down a hillside, believing it belonged to him, despite Chavis stating that it was far too expensive for him to own on his tennis coach salary. Sarcasm is something that Michael firmly grasps because of his self-hatred, as he does not know how to respond to his family or friends properly at times without it. He indicates this in the mission &lt;a href=\"Paleto%20Score%20Setup\"&gt;Paleto Score Setup&lt;/a&gt;, where he proclaims that sarcasm is one of the only things he has left in this world that cannot be taken away from him.\nMichael is a highly egotistical and narcissistic person. He only shows concern about the issues he is being pulled through instead of the situations he constantly puts his family or friends through. He will often get unfairly defensive when someone rightfully criticizes him. A case in point of this wrongdoing is shown in one of his many heated arguments with his wife, Amanda. At the start of the mission &lt;a href=\"Fame%20or%20Shame%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Fame or Shame&lt;/a&gt;, she castigates him for not giving her any support in raising their children and only wanting to cater to himself by \"Getting drunk, or you're staring miserably at the clouds, or you're out there doing God only knows what\". He responds with the fact that he, \"Pulled you out of a midwestern trailer park, got you a big mansion in Rockford Hills\", and that the only thing she'll have to worry about is \"What part of your body you want to have chopped off or sucked out again\". Another instance is in the same mission, where Trevor chides him for letting Tracey humiliate herself on public television the way she did and labeling it as \"Poor parenting.\" Michael responds defensively, \"Yeah, thanks for the fucking feedback. It means a lot coming from you.\" The same goes for Lester and Franklin as well. During &lt;a href=\"Predator%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Predator&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor criticizes Michael for instantly thinking about himself, claiming it is \"typical\" of him. During &lt;a href=\"The%20Paleto%20Score\"&gt;The Paleto Score&lt;/a&gt;, Michael argues with Trevor over the latter's kidnapping of &lt;a href=\"Patricia%20Madrazo\"&gt;Patricia Madrazo&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in their exile in Sandy Shores to avoid the wrath of her husband, Martin. Michael complains that Trevor is not making his situation any easier, and Trevor again criticizes Michael for only thinking about himself. At the beginning of &lt;a href=\"The%20Bureau%20Raid\"&gt;The Bureau Raid&lt;/a&gt; (Fire Crew entry), when Lester is explaining the plan to Michael, Michael describes it as \"a bit idiotic\". Lester explains that he tried his best and that Michael chose this method. He then claims that Trevor \"has a point\" about Michael \"whining too much\", to which Michael responds by giving Lester . At the beginning of the Roof Entry setup for the same mission, Lester continuously reproaches Michael for his constant bickering about the former, managing to still stay calm and collected as they prepare to pull off a dangerous raid on one of the most secure buildings in the country. Michael gets so annoyed that he refuses to return Lester's &lt;a href=\"cane\"&gt;cane&lt;/a&gt; to him unless he retracts everything he stated. Lester does so reluctantly. When Michael tries to pull the same bickering move on Franklin, the latter fires back at him with irritation, leaving Michael apologizing for not noticing how self-absorbed he's been.\nAnother of Michael's negative traits is his hypocrisy. He frequently scolds the people around him for their mistakes and bad habits but refuses to acknowledge his own. At the start of the mission \"Daddy's Little Girl\", he criticizes Jimmy for slouching all day in front of the TV, playing video games, and eating profusely, despite the fact he does almost the exact same thing. With Tracey, he denies her the opportunity to become famous by intervening against her wishes while actively currying favor with Solomon Richards to be a renowned movie producer by working with unsavory individuals. With Amanda, he claims she is \"wasteful\" with his money even though she notices that Michael's day trading is hurting the family finances during \"The Good Husband\" on their way home. He does the same thing towards Trevor, openly judging his will to maim, kill, and steal with ease and pleasure while not showing any signs of remorse, even though Michael himself displays little to no remorse for the various people he kills. At the same time, he actively provokes trouble with &lt;a href=\"Simeon%20Yetarian\"&gt;Simeon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blake\"&gt;Blake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lazlow%20Jones\"&gt;Lazlow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Madrazo\"&gt;Madrazo&lt;/a&gt; over petty issues his family has. During &lt;a href=\"The%20Paleto%20Score\"&gt;The Paleto Score&lt;/a&gt;, Michael complains to Trevor that he misses his family. Trevor angrily retorts that Michael never paid attention to them and only misses them now that they've left him. Although he openly claims to his therapist that he does the same thing, he hides it underneath multiple lies, a few of them being that he does not enjoy the \"thrill of the action\" or that he does not hold a \"plain yet wilfully strong addiction to chaos\".\nThe see-through hypocrisy can simultaneously show how easily and massively dishonest he is. Regardless of whether it is himself, his family, or friends, Michael displays difficulty when trying to convey the truth. For instance, whenever Trevor brings up a subject involving Brad, Michael will immediately yet vaguely change the topic. Once Trevor realizes that Brad is dead, Michael continues to lie about his grave being empty instead of it actually containing Brad's corpse. Even after Brad's corpse is exhumed, Michael unwittingly lies about his death instead of coming out with the truth about the staged robbery nine years ago, which causes Trevor to grow irritated and angry. At the end of the mission &lt;a href=\"Surveying%20the%20Score\"&gt;Surveying the Score&lt;/a&gt;, Franklin questions Michael's past relationship with Trevor to the point where Michael has to steadily ask him to stop in hopes of covering his tracks and not letting Franklin catch wind of his deal with the FIB nine years ago and quite possibly letting Trevor know in the process.\nHis judgment calls will also cause negative repercussions. After being \"green lit\" by Martin Madrazo, he brushes it off, telling Franklin that he's known worse human beings. He then begins to take it back after receiving an astringent blow to his midsection with a baseball bat delivered by Madrazo himself. He even declares Martin a \"terrifying psychopath.\" With Devin Weston, he wanted no part in Weston's plans to highjack several high-end vehicles, that is, until Weston promised to arrange a meeting with Michael's idol, Solomon Richards. After this, he keeps Devin in a positive mood to ensure that none of his business ventures are ruined, even if that means making Franklin work for Devin continuously without payment.\nDespite all the negatives, Michael does possess a good side to his personality. He is a very considerate individual, as he pays Franklin for doing what he is forced to do: driving through the front of his boss' business, even though the latter broke into Michael's mansion. Despite all the problems he has in his family, he dearly loves them. Still, he is frequently angered by Tracey's social life, Jimmy being jobless, lazy, and a video game addict and Amanda spending most of his money and cheating on him. However, Michael's family issues slowly started to dissolve after their reunion.\nIt should also be noted that it is very clear that Michael cares for his friends more than he shows. If Franklin chooses to kill Trevor in the end, Michael will stop hanging out with Franklin for a while because he is devastated by Trevor's death. However, he later apologizes to Franklin and reassures him they are still friends. If the player chooses to kill Michael, his extremely aggressive behavior towards Franklin shows that he loved him as a friend and can't believe Franklin did not feel the same.\nBeing the opposite of Trevor, Michael is thorough and rational regarding crime. This makes others leave him to plan and lead robberies and missions, as he is usually the one to devise a plan for a heist alongside Lester. He also shows consideration for people caught up in robberies. An example is that if you choose to pose as guards for the &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;Union Depository heist&lt;/a&gt;, Michael will give the guard he blackmailed a bar of gold to help them get past security.\nMichael will also always put his family's safety above anything else, going as far as to make a moral compromise with the FIB to ensure his family is not in danger. When Trevor first comes back to find Michael in his house, Michael immediately puts himself in front of Jimmy, not knowing what Trevor is going to do. When Devin Weston sent Merryweather to Michael's house to kill his family, Michael instantly abandoned his movie premiere to engage the hostile forces, rescue his family, and subsequently move them to a new location. Michael's care about his family is finally reciprocated by Amanda towards the end of the game, at which time she makes him promise not to get killed.\nTowards the end of the game, Michael starts to accept his borderline-sociopath personality, stating in the final cutscene of the Deathwish ending that he still hates himself, but \"at least he knows the words for it\". Michael has also started to work on his anger issues when his family comes back and can be seen expressing a great amount of regret for the decisions he has made, becoming more truthful and open. This is evident when he hangs out with Franklin; he expresses great distaste for his decision to betray Trevor with the help of Dave to secure a future for himself, seeing as the decision itself was \"hollow\" and only created more problems as well as causing much more resentment for not only for himself but the people around him as well.\nRelationships with other characters.\nFamily.\nWhile living in North Yankton, Michael had a stronger bond with his loved ones, and they could get along with each other. But after relocating to Los Santos, Michael's obsession with living the \"Vinewood Dream\", along with his depression about having to abandon his criminal lifestyle and betraying his criminal accomplices, made him neglect and alienate his family. At the same time, he became egocentric, selfish, and conceited. Early in the storyline, Michael is constantly seen fussing, bickering, and arguing with his family until the mission &lt;a href=\"Did%20Somebody%20Say%20Yoga%3F\"&gt;Did Somebody Say Yoga?&lt;/a&gt;, where they abandon him in search of a more peaceful living. After Michael reunites with his family in the mission Reuniting the Family, Michael will be seen bonding with them much more often than before, as they all promise to fix their relationship before things become disastrous. While hanging out with Amanda, Michael admits that he thought he lost his family for good once they left him, making him eager to change his ways.\n&lt;a href=\"Amanda%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Amanda De Santa&lt;/a&gt; - Amanda's relationship with Michael began in a strip club where she was a stripper. The two fell in love, had two children, and eventually married. Amanda devoted so much to Michael that she even left everything she had in North Yankton to move to Los Santos and their children to begin their lives away from Michael's past crimes. During the events of the game, Amanda can barely tolerate him anymore due to his arrogant and hypocritical personality and verbally abusive behavior towards her. After catching Michael in bed with another stripper, Amanda began to have affairs with multiple men, including her tennis coach, which further strained their marriage, with Michael implied to be reciprocating this infidelity by calling up hookers at motels and allowing her to have affairs on the condition of not having sex with other men in his home. Amanda finally hits her breaking point when Fabien does a sexual pose on her, which angers Michael, who then attempts to punch Fabien. Fabien reacts by sidestepping and makes Michael land in the swimming pool. Amanda then berates Michael for his attempted action, calling him \"a pathetic psychopath\", and leaves him with Tracey while Jimmy moves out on his own (according to him).\nMichael later suffers from depression after his wife and kids leave him. However, Jimmy reveals to Franklin that Amanda very much misses Michael, frequently asking about him and even telling Franklin at one point to let her know if he's doing well. It turns out that Amanda and their kids were even more miserable living with Fabien than with Michael. After Jimmy reveals that Fabien is starting to bore Amanda and is only interested in the sexual aspect of the relationship and being a mooch, he tells Michael about the couple's hangout spot. Amanda was then seen hanging out with Fabien at a local &lt;a href=\"Bean%20Machine\"&gt;Bean Machine&lt;/a&gt; coffee shop, getting berated by Fabien and later being told to pay for a custom-made unitard. Michael steps in angrily in defense of Amanda, and she allows Michael to hit him in the face with a laptop. Michael then agrees to arrange a therapy session with Dr. Friedlander, bringing Jimmy and Tracey along. During the session, Michael and Amanda had a screaming match in front of their kids (during which he threatened to kill Amanda if she ever had him put in jail) to clear up the situation that would ultimately keep their marriage in ruins. Amanda and the kids move back in with Michael afterward, and their feelings are rekindled by the end of the story, brought closer together by various events. Certain random switch-ups with Michael involving Amanda will also be altered. For example, whereas in the past, when dropping Amanda off at a mall or something of the sort, they would be rude to each other, they now kindly bid each other goodbye. Another example would be Michael getting out of bed after a sexual night with Amanda, to which she'll even smack him on his buttocks as he leaves the room. He also expresses generosity afterward, whereas before, he was stingy with his money.\n&lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Jimmy De Santa&lt;/a&gt; - Jimmy's relationship with his father is also rocky; even though Michael is far from perfect, he loves his son but does not know how to display it. His son is not very moral either, as he often takes drugs and attempts to sell his father's boat without him knowing, ending with the boat being stolen. They have a confused and strained relationship with each other. Michael tries to improve their relationship by spending time with his son, but to no avail, as he lacks any form of respect for his father. At one point, he even drugs Michael, takes money from his bank account, and steals his car. However, Jimmy soon regrets his actions and visits his father, saying he does love him and promises to get a job and not be a lazy, pot-smoking, video game addict, which can be seen in-game. His relationship with his father seems to improve after the mission Reuniting the Family, as shown in the cutscenes when switching characters to Michael. Examples of this are both arriving home from a &lt;a href=\"Bicycles\"&gt;bicycle&lt;/a&gt; ride or playing video games in Jimmy's room, with Michael always losing.\n&lt;a href=\"Tracey%20De%20Santa\"&gt;Tracey De Santa&lt;/a&gt; - Michael's relationship with his daughter is also considered frail. Despite this, Michael does love Tracey but is often angry at her loose behavior and social life, such as her hanging out with drug dealers and porn stars, and &lt;a href=\"Friends%20Reunited\"&gt;embarrasses her by interrupting her audition for \" Fame or Shame \" by chasing Lazlow out of the building for performing a sexual pose on her&lt;/a&gt;. Once Tracey leaves her father, she gives him a phone call, claiming that he needs help. Like Jimmy, however, Tracey continues to grow tiresome of Fabien throughout the storyline. She'll even email Michael once to explain that she misses him. After Michael's family returns home, Tracey seems to develop a better relationship with her father, which starts improving once Michael humiliates Lazlow in the tattoo parlor and demands that Lazlow put Tracey on \"Fame or Shame\" by doing whatever she wants in the show. Michael even helps Tracey deal with a creepy old man stalking her. However, Tracey still continues trying to be a celebrity, but somewhere after the story ends, she believes that people need to stop sending her sex toys because she doesn't do that on camera.\nFriends.\nMichael has had a rather difficult time making friends. The friends that he surrounded himself with in his previous life were, in his words, not the type to associate with since they either ended up missing or dead. Even after becoming semi-retired, he still doesn't have many friends. This is mostly caused by his antisocial personality, which keeps him inside his head.\n&lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Philips\"&gt;Trevor Philips&lt;/a&gt; - Trevor's relationship with Michael started around the late 1980s, over twenty years prior to the game's events, where he and Trevor were escorting cargo across the border. Trevor claims that Michael's victim came after him, so Trevor shot a &lt;a href=\"Flare%20Gun\"&gt;flare&lt;/a&gt; into the other man's head and dumped the body using his &lt;a href=\"Beagle\"&gt;plane&lt;/a&gt; (which Trevor claimed \"Never smelled the same again.\"), and as soon as they left the plane, they both threw up and became friends. Michael convinced Trevor to join him to commit further robberies, seeing as they worked well as a team. Thus, they started a long partnership. While Trevor viewed Michael as a friend and possibly a spiritual brother who could understand him and his psychotic ways, Michael viewed Trevor as an insane liability with special uses. Their alleged companionship was okay until Michael met his future wife, Amanda, causing their friendship to strain since Trevor and Amanda didn't see eye to eye. After the botched heist, Michael and Trevor assumed one another was dead. After Michael's relapse into crime, Trevor discovers that he is alive and concludes that he faked his death. While viewing Michael as a friend, Trevor starts to treat him with derision as he feels betrayed by Michael, but both still get on well enough. Their friendship is even further strained when Trevor &lt;a href=\"Bury%20the%20Hatchet\"&gt;begins to piece together the truth&lt;/a&gt; about Michael's survival and Brad's death, leading to a standoff between the two. From this point on, Trevor vowed to kill Michael but still needed the man alive so they could team up again to pull off one big job. Michael sees in Trevor everything he despises about himself, so he'd try to pin everything on him or think of betraying him again. This is highlighted during the mission &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Score%20%28GTA%20V%29\"&gt;The Big Score&lt;/a&gt;. As Michael and his crew are escaping from the cops, he'd say things like, \"If we are caught, it's all Trevor's idea\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"Something%20Sensible\"&gt;Something Sensible&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor won't become friends with Michael again, as he caused him to crash while he was being chased by Franklin. He will state, \"I thought I was with one Judas! I'm surrounded by them\". If Franklin doesn't kill Trevor, then Michael will shoot him instead. He will tell Franklin weeks later that he regrets his actions and doesn't want to know him anymore. In &lt;a href=\"The%20Time%27s%20Come\"&gt;The Time's Come&lt;/a&gt;, Trevor is not directly involved, but works out that Franklin is responsible. It seems that Trevor wanted to forgive Michael, but didn't have a chance to apologize. He will call Franklin a \"Judas\", a \"backstabber\" and a traitor. In &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;The Third Way&lt;/a&gt;, Michael and Trevor have one last standoff before Franklin explains that both men have two options: kill each other right now or work together to kill Devin Weston, Steve Haines and the rest of their enemies. Trevor ends up picking the second choice, with the outcome being successful. As the incident ends, Michael and Trevor finally manage to rekindle their friendship, with Trevor considering Michael as a friend, albeit one that he hates, which Michael accepts. After this, while hanging out with each other, Michael offers Trevor a part of his share of the big score (which Trevor rejects) and apologizes again; this time, Trevor accepts the apology. The next time they hang out, Trevor will apologize to Michael, and he admits he shouldn't have reacted the way he did.\n&lt;a href=\"Franklin%20Clinton\"&gt;Franklin Clinton&lt;/a&gt; - Franklin meets Michael after stealing a car from the latter's house. Michael then has Franklin take him to whoever tasked Franklin with stealing his son's car. From the start, Franklin was impressed with Michael's professional criminality, and after his firing from &lt;a href=\"Premium%20Deluxe%20Motorsport\"&gt;Premium Deluxe Motorsport&lt;/a&gt;, he sought out Michael for possible work. After Franklin saves Jimmy, Michael sees much potential in the young man. After Franklin's help with the jewelry store heist, Michael refers to Franklin as a true friend and the \"son I always wanted\". Franklin, in turn, seems to respect Michael, is grateful for improving his life, and is loyal to him. He even helps Michael out with his government issue. After meeting Trevor, Franklin starts to see many arguments between the two rather than siding with one of them. Franklin tries to calm them down, hoping it won't escalate into something more violent and unnecessary. Franklin also notices Michael's personality and sometimes confronts him about it. If the player chooses to &lt;a href=\"The%20Time%27s%20Come\"&gt;kill Michael&lt;/a&gt;, Franklin can be shown to deeply regret his decision, being unable to face his family or Trevor. If the player chooses to &lt;a href=\"Something%20Sensible\"&gt;kill Trevor&lt;/a&gt;, they remain friends, although their friendship is greatly strained, and if they cross paths on the street, Michael will cut all ties with him. If the player chooses the &lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20Way\"&gt;Deathwish ending&lt;/a&gt;, if Michael and Franklin are hanging out, they'll talk about how they can't believe they pulled it off and that Franklin is extremely grateful to Michael for the experience. Also, in an email, Michael will tell Franklin, \"he's a friend for life\". However, unbeknownst to Franklin, Michael was also the source of Franklin's problems. The former's actions led to the latter being fired, involved with federal crimes, and hung out to dry after he killed Michael under pressure.\n&lt;a href=\"Lester%20Crest\"&gt;Lester Crest&lt;/a&gt; - Lester first meets Michael at an unknown period and seems to be a mastermind in Michael's robberies many years prior. Michael stated that he wasn't much of a friend to Lester, and after they've encountered one another during the game, Michael decides to make up for that. He can often be seen sticking up for Lester when he can't defend himself from much stronger people, such as Trevor. However, that won't stop Michael from bullying Lester if he criticizes the former for his hypocrisy.\n&lt;a href=\"Dave%20Norton\"&gt;Dave Norton&lt;/a&gt; - Years before the events of the game, Michael arranged a deal for him to hand over Trevor and Brad to the FIB by faking his death so that Dave would gain fame and respect for supposedly \"killing\" Michael during the North Yankton heist. After the event, Dave managed to keep his promise by having Michael and his family move to a luxurious mansion in Rockford Hills, Los Santos. Michael would also pay Dave hush money monthly to keep their business deal a secret. Their relationship was fine until Michael performed a heist at the Vangelico Jewelry Store. Michael would then perform several jobs for Dave and his boss, Steve Haines. Dave will admit that even though he was a bank robber, he always did \"like\" Michael. They would occasionally defend each other in hostile situations, like what was shown in the mission The Wrap Up, when he threatened Steve with a gun to prevent him from arresting Michael. In the Deathwish ending, Dave calls Michael and tells him that he replaced Haines in his TV show, and then thanks Michael for doing jobs for him before saying farewell, with the two parting on good terms. However, in the case that Michael aids Franklin in killing Trevor, Dave can no longer maintain ties with Michael as he is kept under strict surveillance and eventually dishonorably discharged by Haines.\n&lt;a href=\"Solomon%20Richards\"&gt;Solomon Richards&lt;/a&gt; - Solomon and Michael are introduced to each other through Devin Weston. Michael is a big fan of the film producer and views him as his idol, even doubting at first that Devin could arrange their meeting. The two get along well. Solomon often recites a quote from one of his movies, and Michael easily names which one. He accepts Michael's assistance in the production of the film Meltdown and goes on to name him the associate producer. This offers more meaning and joy to Michael's life, and if he were to call Solomon after the mission Meltdown, he'd declare that working with the film producer was ultimately the best thing that could ever happen to him.\nEnemies.\n&lt;a href=\"Steve%20Haines\"&gt;Steve Haines&lt;/a&gt; - Michael meets Haines during a job to extract &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Kerimov\"&gt;Ferdinand Kerimov&lt;/a&gt; (aka Mr. K) from the IAA headquarters. He forces him, Trevor, and Franklin into his operations and tortures Mr. K into retrieving information about assassinating an unspecified target. He also gets the protagonists to perform several heists for him. However, more and more suspicion from the Bureau falls on Haines, causing him to become extremely paranoid. He and Agent Sanchez confront Michael and Agent Norton as he attempts to have them framed and arrested for ruining his career. After an ambush consisting of the IAA, Merryweather, and rival FIB forces, Haines attempts to have Michael killed, along with Trevor and Franklin. Fortunately, he decides to spare him and Franklin. However, he wants Trevor dead and tasks Franklin with killing Trevor. In the \"Deathwish\" ending, if Franklin chooses Option C, Trevor kills Steve while he is shooting an episode of his show at &lt;a href=\"Del%20Perro%20Pier\"&gt;Del Perro Pier&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, Michael kills Stretch, an enemy of Franklin and Lamar Davis, at the &lt;a href=\"BJ%20Smith%20Recreational%20Center\"&gt;BJ Smith Recreational Center&lt;/a&gt;. If Franklin kills Trevor, Haines will congratulate him and break all ties with him, obeying one final wish that Weston backs off from wanting Michael dead. Weston will do the same with Franklin about Haines wanting Trevor dead if he kills Michael.\n&lt;a href=\"Devin%20Weston\"&gt;Devin Weston&lt;/a&gt; - Michael meets Devin during a meeting with Steve Haines. He first offers the former a deal to produce a film after a heist. During this meeting at Devin's mansion, Michael is annoyed by Devin's intentionally rude and condescending demeanor. Devin soon refuses to pay Michael, along with Trevor and Franklin for their jobs. After Michael refuses to terminate the Meltdown film's production and accidentally gets Devin's lawyer killed, Devin sends a platoon of Merryweather men to kill Michael's family. However, Michael manages to save his family, and he furiously tells Lester over the phone that he wants to devise a plan to murder Devin and get back at Merryweather, effectively starting a personal war between the two men. This incident leads Devin to hire Franklin to murder Michael. If \"Deathwish\" is chosen, Michael happily accepts Franklin's offer to help him and Trevor. Trevor kills Devin's Merryweather guards, kidnaps Devin from his mansion, and shoves him inside the trunk of one of his cars. The three protagonists meet up to taunt a beaten and bloodied Devin for their victory before pushing him (with him inside the car trunk) off the cliff into the ocean, killing him.\nSpecial Ability.\nMichael's &lt;a href=\"Special%20Ability\"&gt;Special Ability&lt;/a&gt; is called \"Area Kill.\" While active, Michael enters a bullet-time-like effect, allowing him to slow time and gain the advantage in shootouts. By enhancing this skill, you increase its maximum storage capacity, which directly affects its duration. Michael's Special Ability lasts 30 seconds when the Stat Bar for Special Abilities has been maxed out.\nReception.\nLike Franklin and Trevor, Michael has received a very positive response from critics and fans of the series, as he was the first protagonist in the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series to have a family.\nDan Houser's Description of Michael.\n\"\"Michael, to me, is... Who is he? I know who he is. I'm just trying to... He's the person who is trying to ignore some rather large mistakes that they have made. The person who's trying to forget about certain practical but still selfish decisions that they took. He's a man, also obsessed by images and by appearances, and who, when the world doesn't live up to those images and appearances, doesn't know what to do. He just retreats into his head. What he also is, when we started out... What he kind of evolved into as we began thinking about him and developing him... He was the first character we came up with. He began as the idea of what happens to a regular GTA protagonist after they retire? Then you think, what would make him retire? He's a man with a big ego and plenty of good values and plenty of bad values.\"\n\"A guy who's in his mid-40s and on the cusp of middle age who doesn't know what to do, but made a bunch of money and does not know what to do with it. He's theoretically won, but the spoils of victory aren't necessarily what he imagined. For us, that's a very interesting character, unlike what we've done in the past or what we've seen in much entertainment in general, let alone any video games. That was interesting.\""}
